[00:00.000 --> 00:11.800]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.800 --> 00:18.680]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you've got one!
[00:18.680 --> 00:24.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.600]  This will be a day long remember.
[00:29.600 --> 00:35.000]  It got released on Alamo Day, the fall of the Alamo, on the birth of Texas.
[00:35.000 --> 00:40.280]  It released yesterday evening, but it's breaking in the news today.
[00:40.280 --> 00:49.760]  On Tuesday, March 7th, 2017, WikiLeaks unveils Vault 7, the largest ever publication of confidential
[00:49.760 --> 00:52.360]  CIA documents.
[00:52.360 --> 00:53.360]  Another Snowden emerges.
[00:53.360 --> 00:56.040]  Yes, let me be specific.
[00:56.040 --> 01:00.960]  This has been leaked by patriots inside the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:00.960 --> 01:07.840]  Show was all the information that you saw unfold during the campaign, none of it came
[01:07.840 --> 01:08.840]  from the Russians.
[01:08.840 --> 01:13.760]  The Russians hacked in to the East Anglia facility that was running over a thousand universities,
[01:13.760 --> 01:18.120]  false thermometer, temperature, readout data scam.
[01:18.120 --> 01:21.400]  The Russians admitted that, that was six years ago.
[01:21.400 --> 01:24.960]  That affected the Russians in an attempt to make them have carbon taxes, and I salute
[01:24.960 --> 01:29.080]  them standing up against the fraud that is the carbon tax.
[01:29.080 --> 01:33.720]  And the Russians have done other successful hacks, but almost all of what you've seen
[01:33.720 --> 01:35.440]  has been leaked by US intelligence.
[01:35.440 --> 01:40.240]  I was told this by people high up, still in the government, but also outside the government.
[01:40.240 --> 01:41.640]  You're never really out of it.
[01:41.640 --> 01:44.480]  That this was all coming two years ago, I told you it was coming.
[01:44.480 --> 01:48.760]  I've also said probably a hundred times since the election, if the globalists don't back
[01:48.760 --> 01:53.040]  off and leave Trump alone and the American people, that new WikiLeaks are coming even
[01:53.040 --> 01:56.120]  more damning that will destroy Obama.
[01:56.120 --> 01:58.840]  Now, everybody's freaking out right now.
[01:58.840 --> 02:03.000]  It's that your TVs are watching you, your cell phones are watching you, how it wires
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  into all these private corporations, how these private banks are able to manipulate the stock
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.080]  market and control it, how they're blackmailing the media, how they're blackmailing Congress.
[02:11.080 --> 02:16.120]  Why do you think Trump came out three days ago and said, you're wiretapping me?
[02:16.120 --> 02:18.160]  Well, they admitted they were doing it.
[02:18.160 --> 02:21.120]  Remember, oh, we have the communiques of Flynn and the Russians.
[02:21.120 --> 02:22.120]  That was a bluff.
[02:22.120 --> 02:26.840]  And there, the head of the Intelligence Committee and the House, Nunez, says there's nothing
[02:26.840 --> 02:27.840]  there.
[02:27.840 --> 02:31.520]  And all these other top-level people are saying, watch out, Trump was being illegally
[02:31.520 --> 02:32.640]  spied on.
[02:32.640 --> 02:42.200]  And now, this massive treasure trove of tens of thousands of documents, a nightmare for
[02:42.200 --> 02:43.960]  the New World Order is here.
[02:43.960 --> 02:48.400]  And I've warned Hillary and I've warned all of them, and I don't say this from a position
[02:48.400 --> 02:49.400]  of a power trip.
[02:49.400 --> 02:53.640]  I'm just a messenger, but somebody who's willing to do it, and go through the things
[02:53.640 --> 02:56.120]  that happen to a messenger who delivers this information.
[02:56.120 --> 03:00.160]  But I am very honored to be a major messenger, and Trump's a much bigger messenger now and
[03:00.160 --> 03:01.560]  others are coming as well.
[03:01.560 --> 03:05.840]  Now, Snowden's a big messenger, but make no mistake, this is only the beginning.
[03:05.840 --> 03:08.760]  The pedophile rings, everybody are going to be exposed.
[03:08.760 --> 03:11.600]  That's why they're completely panicking.
[03:11.600 --> 03:14.800]  That's why they're completely going crazy right now.
[03:14.800 --> 03:19.080]  It's why their minions have been activated to yell and scream and all over the country,
[03:19.080 --> 03:26.640]  they tasered, they beat, they shot, they pepper sprayed men, women and children viciously.
[03:26.640 --> 03:31.120]  They're calling for civil war, they're calling for death, they're calling for destruction.
[03:31.120 --> 03:34.280]  Then they had some media matters piece that I'm calling for Trump to be violent.
[03:34.280 --> 03:38.600]  I said that they try to organize violence in the streets, as Newsweek has done, a case
[03:38.600 --> 03:43.840]  for rioting, a case for civil unrest, and if they call for Trump's death, that's illegal.
[03:43.840 --> 03:48.160]  You're trying to organize violence, we don't want to be violent, we're going to destroy
[03:48.160 --> 03:49.720]  you with the information.
[03:49.720 --> 03:53.640]  And by the way, that means weaponized info, the truth.
[03:53.640 --> 04:00.360]  But yes, if you really want a physical fight, I would advise you to back off right now.
[04:00.360 --> 04:05.280]  I want stability, I want a good stock market, I want jobs, I want freedom.
[04:05.280 --> 04:11.840]  I want the 1 trillion, 400 plus billion in new infrastructure that's been announced by
[04:11.840 --> 04:16.120]  the government and private interest in just the last three months since president was
[04:16.120 --> 04:21.240]  president-elect, the return of a real president, 45.
[04:21.240 --> 04:25.240]  If he's successful, it will dwarf anything George Washington ever did and we're all doing
[04:25.240 --> 04:26.240]  this together.
[04:26.240 --> 04:33.760]  Trump cheers Exxon's plan to create 45,000 new jobs in just the next four years, dealing
[04:33.760 --> 04:39.960]  with hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in Texas and Louisiana
[04:39.960 --> 04:41.440]  alone.
[04:41.440 --> 04:44.360]  Yes, absolutely.
[04:44.360 --> 04:45.360]  It's happening now.
[04:45.360 --> 04:48.000]  We think Rex Tillerson in there was all about.
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.000]  Total delivery.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.920]  That's just the latest in the last five minutes.
[04:51.920 --> 04:56.440]  This is the beginning of the end of David Rockefeller's new world order.
[04:56.440 --> 04:57.440]  Stand by.
[04:57.440 --> 05:00.440]  We'll return.
[05:00.440 --> 05:05.000]  I'm beginning to think Mexico's border policy and immigration policy is whatever goes against
[05:05.000 --> 05:06.000]  Trump.
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.680]  In an unprecedented move, the Mexican government is now paying $50 million to give legal support
[05:10.680 --> 05:13.440]  to Mexican nationals living in the U.S. illegally.
[05:13.440 --> 05:17.120]  Though Mexico won't pay for a wall, but they will pay for people who leave Mexico for the
[05:17.120 --> 05:19.440]  United States, I guess because it's better.
[05:19.440 --> 05:22.320]  If you do so legally, though, they have no funding for you.
[05:22.320 --> 05:26.160]  All 50 Mexican consulates to the U.S. are launching legal assistance centers for Mexican
[05:26.160 --> 05:29.520]  nationals living in the U.S. illegally who are fearing deportation.
[05:29.520 --> 05:33.600]  In contrast, however, I cannot go to Mexico and have the U.S. government pay any legal
[05:33.600 --> 05:36.160]  fees I may incur for migrating illegally.
[05:36.160 --> 05:39.240]  And why would Mexico pay people who left their country?
[05:39.240 --> 05:43.920]  Is Mexico that bad they just refuse to go back, or are the people that left Mexico that
[05:43.920 --> 05:46.120]  bad they're paying to keep them out?
[05:46.120 --> 05:51.640]  No, I think any anti-Trump politicians from anywhere on Earth have now abandoned all logic,
[05:51.640 --> 05:56.600]  all common sense, all true policy and diplomacy, an attempt to go against anything President
[05:56.600 --> 05:57.680]  Trump tries to do.
[05:57.680 --> 06:00.640]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[06:00.640 --> 06:05.600]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[06:05.600 --> 06:08.960]  before it became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk.
[06:08.960 --> 06:14.200]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLive.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[06:14.200 --> 06:20.400]  bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[06:20.400 --> 06:21.760]  great tasting formula.
[06:21.760 --> 06:22.760]  Caveman.
[06:22.760 --> 06:26.760]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[06:26.760 --> 06:27.760]  superior ancestors.
[06:27.760 --> 06:30.720]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[06:30.720 --> 06:33.400]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[06:33.400 --> 06:38.440]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength
[06:38.440 --> 06:42.840]  from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces
[06:42.840 --> 06:43.960]  the blood for the body.
[06:43.960 --> 06:46.480]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[06:46.480 --> 06:50.840]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[06:50.840 --> 06:54.440]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[06:54.440 --> 06:57.920]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself

[07:21.000 --> 07:25.600]  The reality is it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our
[07:25.600 --> 07:27.040]  modern diets.
[07:27.040 --> 07:32.160]  Secret 12 by InfowarsLive is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake

[07:55.920 --> 08:20.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:20.600 --> 08:50.160]  I'm Elemental, my site is clean, I keep the country free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free,
[08:50.160 --> 08:51.160]  I'm free.
[08:51.160 --> 08:57.240]  Alright, I think it's time to go ahead and announce some things here on air so that
[08:57.240 --> 09:02.000]  the globalists and their minions understand exactly what they're facing.
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.520]  Their higher-ups have known this for a long time, but their minions don't know.
[09:07.520 --> 09:13.360]  Globalist forces, dysfunctional saboteur types that want to bring this country down, that
[09:13.360 --> 09:17.040]  want to enslave humanity and be social engineers.
[09:17.040 --> 09:21.240]  You have been undermined for decades, and the patriots inside our government and others
[09:21.240 --> 09:25.280]  have been quietly preparing for your absolute and complete defeat.
[09:25.280 --> 09:30.520]  Not your overthrow, but your legitimate defeat.
[09:30.520 --> 09:33.680]  Because you can't overthrow something that's illegitimate.
[09:33.680 --> 09:35.880]  You're just being removed.
[09:35.880 --> 09:40.400]  A lot of people are freaking out right now because they know this is the broadcast that
[09:40.400 --> 09:44.080]  told you they have kill switches and remote control and all the airplanes for at least
[09:44.080 --> 09:45.200]  25 years.
[09:45.200 --> 09:46.200]  All the modern airplanes.
[09:46.200 --> 09:50.120]  We're the ones that told you they can remote control your car right off a bridge and gave
[09:50.120 --> 09:51.120]  you the documents.
[09:51.120 --> 09:54.800]  We're the one that told you over 20 years ago that television sets were watching and
[09:54.800 --> 09:56.120]  listening to you.
[09:56.120 --> 10:02.200]  We told you they could switch on the microphone in your regular landline, not just your smartphone.
[10:02.200 --> 10:05.360]  We told you everything.
[10:05.360 --> 10:11.320]  And because patriots inside the different agencies were unable to speak out, my show
[10:11.320 --> 10:18.560]  was early adopted, not officially, as a place to dump information.
[10:18.560 --> 10:22.520]  And so I had NSA whistleblowers, corporate engineer whistleblowers, you name it.
[10:22.520 --> 10:26.360]  I mean, you've seen for many years the Thomas Drake's, the William Benny's, the technical
[10:26.360 --> 10:31.280]  head of the NSA, come on the show, the former NSA folks from 20 years ago blowing the whistle
[10:31.280 --> 10:35.720]  as well, like Wayne Madsen, I mean, there's countless great people out there.
[10:35.720 --> 10:39.600]  So it's not about us getting credit, it's about people understanding we've been absolutely
[10:39.600 --> 10:41.080]  on target.
[10:41.080 --> 10:48.040]  And that's why I was told many years ago that in large divisional groups, in the Defense
[10:48.040 --> 10:54.440]  Department, in Defense Intelligence, in the CIA, in the NSA, in the geospatial group,
[10:54.440 --> 11:00.800]  in all of them, they would call people in and entire meeting rooms and say, this guy's
[11:00.800 --> 11:05.840]  young, he's wild, but he's done the research and has the sources, he's dead on.
[11:05.840 --> 11:08.240]  This is the voice of America right here.
[11:08.240 --> 11:12.160]  Alex Jones, we don't know how he came up with Info War, the way to counter it, why?
[11:12.160 --> 11:13.840]  We don't have that website, we don't know.
[11:13.840 --> 11:16.200]  This guy's doing it all, he's reverse engineered it.
[11:16.200 --> 11:18.000]  This is the guy to listen to.
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.560]  And I obviously didn't want to tell you that, even though I knew that 15 years ago.
[11:22.560 --> 11:26.160]  And this morning, some folks I know got calls and they were like, yeah, we got ordered 12
[11:26.160 --> 11:31.000]  years ago to listen to Alex Jones, SEAL Team 6, you name it.
[11:31.000 --> 11:36.160]  That's because we did it, we resisted, we stood up.
[11:36.160 --> 11:40.040]  Info War is on target and people want to know some of the conversations I've had with Trump.
[11:40.040 --> 11:41.680]  It's been about that.
[11:41.680 --> 11:42.680]  It's amazing.
[11:42.680 --> 11:44.600]  I can't believe the intelligence community loves you so much.
[11:44.600 --> 11:48.960]  You've been dead on for 20 years, wow, yeah, I'm just now learning about all this.
[11:48.960 --> 11:52.840]  I mean, people want to know, Trump's learning about all this right now, about how they can
[11:52.840 --> 11:56.480]  remote control planes, how they can crash cars, how they can turn on microphones and
[11:56.480 --> 11:58.000]  cameras, all of it.
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.880]  And people were asking, how did I know this 18, 19 years ago?
[12:00.880 --> 12:05.120]  It was because there were a lot of engineers in Austin that were very wealthy that had been
[12:05.120 --> 12:12.200]  part of this, that saw me on air talking about it and gave me even more intel.
[12:12.200 --> 12:16.320]  And Bill Clinton ordered people to surveil me, he ordered from our intel people to beat
[12:16.320 --> 12:21.520]  me up, to break into my house, to do a lot of really nasty stuff, try to set us up.
[12:21.520 --> 12:24.960]  And then all of a sudden, the decision was made before Bill Clinton even left, the military
[12:24.960 --> 12:27.000]  said, we're not doing this to Alex Jones.
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.760]  So they persecuted me up front and then decided, this is a patriot.
[12:30.760 --> 12:31.760]  What the hell are we doing?
[12:31.760 --> 12:33.840]  Because they were surveilling me and turned me loose.
[12:33.840 --> 12:40.320]  So I've been in the jaws of this system by the grace of God.
[12:40.320 --> 12:44.800]  And it's just the right place, the right time, family background, being from Texas, people
[12:44.800 --> 12:50.960]  knowing I'm for real, that we've been leaders for at least 15, 16 years, hardcore, inside
[12:50.960 --> 12:54.080]  the government because other people couldn't talk about this stuff.
[12:54.080 --> 12:57.920]  And they would say, you listen to Alex Jones and you're ordered to listen to this.
[12:57.920 --> 12:58.920]  They'd be what?
[12:58.920 --> 12:59.920]  The conspiracy guy?
[12:59.920 --> 13:01.920]  And they're like, it's not a conspiracy, he's dead on.
[13:01.920 --> 13:05.600]  This is the intel on the whole program, listen to Jones, he's got it all.
[13:05.600 --> 13:06.600]  Because I've done the research.
[13:06.600 --> 13:07.680]  I've read the globalist books.
[13:07.680 --> 13:09.080]  I'm not that special, folks.
[13:09.080 --> 13:13.400]  You go read Carol Quigley's books and you go read Bertrand Russell's books and you go
[13:13.400 --> 13:16.360]  read Brazilian Brzezinski's books and you read Galton's books.
[13:16.360 --> 13:21.400]  Some of the stuff's 170 years old, most of it's 67 years old, 30, 40 years old.
[13:21.400 --> 13:23.360]  It's all there.
[13:23.360 --> 13:25.840]  I just read all the books.
[13:25.840 --> 13:29.440]  People act like they're professors, they act like they're intel analysts, they act like
[13:29.440 --> 13:30.440]  they're researching.
[13:30.440 --> 13:31.440]  They're not.
[13:31.440 --> 13:32.640]  They act cool.
[13:32.640 --> 13:33.640]  I did it.
[13:33.640 --> 13:35.400]  And I'm not bragging.
[13:35.400 --> 13:38.840]  So I told you, big leaks are coming.
[13:38.840 --> 13:41.360]  Giant leaks are coming.
[13:41.360 --> 13:45.560]  And I said, Trump doesn't want to have to release all this because it can really hurt the country
[13:45.560 --> 13:48.120]  and hurt our intelligence gathering capabilities overseas.
[13:48.120 --> 13:53.520]  But it's all being done illegally by rogue groups to enslave the country, to blackmail,
[13:53.520 --> 13:57.960]  to have servers acting like they're in Russia, attacking things, which the intel community
[13:57.960 --> 14:05.400]  knows because they've got systems above that that watch it.
[14:05.400 --> 14:09.680]  And they know they've been trying to set Trump up with Russians and that's all come
[14:09.680 --> 14:10.680]  out in the news.
[14:10.680 --> 14:17.000]  It's up on infowars.com right now, Dr. Corsi, Vault 7 CIA can stage fake Russian hacking
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.000]  to undermine Trump.
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.320]  CIA kept Russian cyber attack techniques handy for false flags and they did it to Trump.
[14:24.320 --> 14:28.160]  But the intel community then looked in Congress at the claims and they were fake.
[14:28.160 --> 14:29.760]  So they kept saying Trump's got a secret server.
[14:29.760 --> 14:35.600]  Yeah, they were running one right out of the van outside the Trump Tower trying to spoof
[14:35.600 --> 14:39.200]  his IPs and they rolled the whole thing up, folks.
[14:39.200 --> 14:41.480]  That's why Trump is so pissed right now.
[14:41.480 --> 14:45.120]  He didn't even realize how bad it was.
[14:45.120 --> 14:53.440]  So I told you, CIA stole Russian malware, use it to misdirect attribution of cyber attacks.
[14:53.440 --> 14:56.520]  So it's all going to come out, ladies and gentlemen, everything we told you is in the
[14:56.520 --> 15:00.120]  new docs, tens of thousands of them, how they break in your phones, how they, how they
[15:00.120 --> 15:04.040]  compromise Congress, how they run sex operatives against Congress.
[15:04.040 --> 15:06.560]  And we always keep saying, why is the CIA do this?
[15:06.560 --> 15:08.200]  Why is the NSA do this?
[15:08.200 --> 15:11.560]  Because the American people have been in the dark because of the media.
[15:11.560 --> 15:16.640]  The media is the enemy, they're owned by the foreign assets, they're the problem.
[15:16.640 --> 15:19.560]  It's not the FBI, it's not the CIA.
[15:19.560 --> 15:23.880]  You think the CIA mainly met up out of soldiers that went and dedicated their lives to this
[15:23.880 --> 15:28.000]  country, really want to bankrupt the nation and really want to end the family and really
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.880]  want to put cancer, viruses and vaccines?
[15:29.880 --> 15:35.720]  They all know it's true now and they're pissed.
[15:35.720 --> 15:42.200]  So I always knew in my heart, if we reverse engineered this thing, exposed it, that strong
[15:42.200 --> 15:46.080]  men and women in government and corporations would come together and that we would beat
[15:46.080 --> 15:47.080]  the new order.
[15:47.080 --> 15:49.520]  I want to declare to the globalist, there's nothing you can do.
[15:49.520 --> 15:54.600]  Now, you can kill Trump, you can kill me, you can kill Ron Paul, you can kill Rand Paul,
[15:54.600 --> 15:55.600]  you can do whatever you want.
[15:55.600 --> 15:58.960]  You can shut the internet off, nothing will stop this now.
[15:58.960 --> 16:01.920]  You are completely surrounded.
[16:01.920 --> 16:04.480]  That's why Brendan said, you better watch your mouth for the president.
[16:04.480 --> 16:09.000]  It's all bravada, it's all arrogant crap.
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.680]  So I'll say it for the thousand time, I don't work for any intelligence agency.
[16:12.680 --> 16:15.800]  I don't sit there and have meetings with these people.
[16:15.800 --> 16:20.800]  I went out separately and did what only an independent journalist and freedom fighter
[16:20.800 --> 16:22.960]  could do with you, the listeners.
[16:22.960 --> 16:27.920]  So the credit for what's happening goes to the listeners, it goes to the whistleblowers,
[16:27.920 --> 16:31.960]  it goes to the supporters of this broadcast first, because without you, there's nothing.
[16:31.960 --> 16:34.960]  It's not I'm just giving you credit up front because I want to patronize you.
[16:34.960 --> 16:37.000]  You are the resistance.
[16:37.000 --> 16:38.360]  You think we're playing games here?
[16:38.360 --> 16:40.120]  You think I risk my life to lose?
[16:40.120 --> 16:44.600]  We're going to win.
[16:44.600 --> 16:48.280]  Nothing's going to stop that unless we stand down and we're not standing down in the battle
[16:48.280 --> 16:49.280]  for the republic.
[16:49.280 --> 16:51.080]  I am so honored to be part of this.
[16:51.080 --> 16:54.560]  All of you should be honored if you be thanking God on your knees right now, that you're alive
[16:54.560 --> 16:58.040]  right now and to be part of the defense of this republic and the return of justice into
[16:58.040 --> 16:59.040]  the world.
[16:59.040 --> 17:03.520]  Because if America falls, my God, their plans were horrible and we'd almost fallen.
[17:03.520 --> 17:05.440]  They planned to finish the job with Hillary.
[17:05.440 --> 17:10.440]  They were so arrogant, they ran that corpse as if we would go along with that.
[17:10.440 --> 17:14.040]  Their arrogance has been our greatest asset.
[17:14.040 --> 17:20.480]  But only now do they understand exactly what they're facing and what they're dealing with.
[17:20.480 --> 17:25.280]  Only now, and I'm going to warn all of them, I'm going to warn the fake media.
[17:25.280 --> 17:28.680]  You think there's not WikiLeaks and documents on how you're getting your orders from the
[17:28.680 --> 17:34.880]  foundations, what websites are being paid, who's getting money from who?
[17:34.880 --> 17:37.920]  You don't think it's not known.
[17:37.920 --> 17:43.760]  You don't think that the New York Times can be destroyed with one mouse being punched.
[17:43.760 --> 17:47.760]  You don't think the Washington Post can be destroyed.
[17:47.760 --> 17:48.760]  Just like that.
[17:48.760 --> 17:50.600]  And you're going to make us destroy you.
[17:50.600 --> 17:51.600]  I understand that.
[17:51.600 --> 17:56.240]  I don't take any pleasure in that because you're already such scum, hurting the country to
[17:56.240 --> 18:00.800]  bring you down is very, but if it's got to be done, it's going to be done.
[18:00.800 --> 18:03.480]  You arrogant Obama.
[18:03.480 --> 18:08.200]  You had the whole country in your control and hated it and tried to run on the ground.
[18:08.200 --> 18:20.280]  All of you, Chuck Schumer, all of you are grasping low, evil, anti-human piles of trash.
[18:20.280 --> 18:21.840]  So what are you going to do now?
[18:21.840 --> 18:23.600]  Everybody knows.
[18:23.600 --> 18:28.720]  What do you think Chris Carter, who admits he gets advised by the CIA for his TV show
[18:28.720 --> 18:33.280]  for 20 years, said, I'm basing the whole new show on Alex Jones, not just the character.
[18:33.280 --> 18:34.880]  Alex Jones is a patriot.
[18:34.880 --> 18:36.280]  Alex Jones is right.
[18:36.280 --> 18:38.600]  Alex Jones is the model of the future.
[18:38.600 --> 18:44.800]  He told Vanity Fair that he told Hollywood Reporter, I'm not bragging about that.
[18:44.800 --> 18:51.080]  Who do you think told Chris Carter which way the world's going?
[18:51.080 --> 18:56.360]  Seven months ago when the show came out, a year plus when he started production.
[18:56.360 --> 19:00.480]  Why would he be allowed to put a show out where Alex Jones is the hero and then say
[19:00.480 --> 19:02.880]  Alex Jones isn't racist in the real world?
[19:02.880 --> 19:08.200]  Alex Jones cares about humanity because the CIA is almost completely converted back to
[19:08.200 --> 19:09.200]  the Republic.
[19:09.200 --> 19:11.440]  In fact, most of them were never away from the Republic.
[19:11.440 --> 19:15.560]  They were controlled by scum and they were waiting for the people to create alternative
[19:15.560 --> 19:18.520]  systems to open up a wedge against the globalist.
[19:18.520 --> 19:20.120]  And now it's happening.
[19:20.120 --> 19:24.240]  You think the CIA wants war for Russia with no reason?
[19:24.240 --> 19:28.400]  We should be allies with Russia and dominate the planet, defeat all the tyrants?
[19:28.400 --> 19:30.520]  It's a natural alliance.
[19:30.520 --> 19:34.960]  Those real thinkers now taking control of our government that actually want prosperity
[19:34.960 --> 19:36.520]  and justice and peace.
[19:36.520 --> 19:38.280]  What's got to be dealt with?
[19:38.280 --> 19:43.160]  The last communist strongholds Cuba, Venezuela, China, and the Islamists.
[19:43.160 --> 19:44.520]  You deal with them.
[19:44.520 --> 19:48.440]  The sky and the stars are the limit.
[19:48.440 --> 19:50.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back on the other side.
[19:50.880 --> 19:52.400]  But this is the Info War.
[19:52.400 --> 19:57.880]  I'm Alex Jones from the Central Texas Command Center, broadcasting worldwide in defense
[19:57.880 --> 20:00.880]  of the Republic.

[22:01.000 --> 22:04.400]  I am a former congressman, physician, and presidential candidate.
[22:04.400 --> 22:06.040]  The world is in turmoil.
[22:06.040 --> 22:10.480]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars, and famines are commonplace.
[22:10.480 --> 22:13.440]  As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events.
[22:13.440 --> 22:17.560]  However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[22:17.560 --> 22:22.000]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.840]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[22:24.840 --> 22:28.600]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.
[22:28.600 --> 22:31.160]  It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.

[22:39.840 --> 22:41.920]  Who knows what the future will bring?

[24:21.840 --> 24:25.840]  Judge that's over the wiretapping says investigation into Obama spying on Trump would reveal mass
[24:25.840 --> 24:28.280]  surveillance of all Americans.
[24:28.280 --> 24:31.240]  Deep State petrified a pervasive spying being exposed.
[24:31.240 --> 24:32.240]  It's funny.
[24:32.240 --> 24:36.880]  Trump just got in and said that he's been spied on and Obama and everybody lied and said
[24:36.880 --> 24:41.200]  they hadn't and then all the documents got released today.
[24:41.200 --> 24:48.400]  It's good to have somebody ready to punch you scum right in your filthy noses, isn't
[24:48.400 --> 24:49.400]  it?
[24:49.400 --> 24:50.800]  Been bullying this country long enough.
[24:50.800 --> 24:53.880]  Now you're going to get your guts kicked in scum metaphysically.
[24:53.880 --> 24:59.800]  I told you, you want to fight, you got one, that's not bravada like you filth sit there
[24:59.800 --> 25:00.800]  and spew all day.
[25:00.800 --> 25:06.120]  You want an actual war, you're about to get a hundred times as you ever imagined.
[25:06.120 --> 25:12.720]  Oh look at media matters, Alex Jones tells Trump to use violence against his opponents.
[25:12.720 --> 25:17.400]  No, that's not what I said, I said they're using violence against us, they beat people
[25:17.400 --> 25:21.520]  up all over the country this weekend at the Trump rallies, tasered people, pepper spray
[25:21.520 --> 25:26.280]  them and the police did nothing in the towns, the globalist control and they're trying
[25:26.280 --> 25:27.280]  to kill the president.
[25:27.280 --> 25:30.920]  They're calling for his murder.
[25:30.920 --> 25:35.280]  Have the grand juries and die every piece of filth that's calling for the president's
[25:35.280 --> 25:36.280]  murder.
[25:36.280 --> 25:41.640]  It's called the law.
[25:41.640 --> 25:46.320]  You people don't get to go around using violence and organizing it without being met.
[25:46.320 --> 25:49.720]  See, you attack us, you get attacked back.
[25:49.720 --> 25:53.960]  See how that works, understand how that works, get that through your mind that you've taken
[25:53.960 --> 26:01.200]  our kindness, our restraint is weakness, you have no idea.
[26:01.200 --> 26:07.440]  So there it is in FullWars.com, it's all right there and the judges have all been involved
[26:07.440 --> 26:11.560]  but it's federal judges coming out, not just Judge Napolitano pointing that out, it's
[26:11.560 --> 26:15.480]  the head of the intelligence committee, it's former attorney general under George W. Bush
[26:15.480 --> 26:19.520]  saying, oh absolutely, they're surveilling everything but here's the thousands of pages
[26:19.520 --> 26:26.880]  of documents released last night on Alamo Day, just crazy, I called for the military
[26:26.880 --> 26:31.840]  to stand up yesterday and tweet and Facebook out articles and photos yourself saying you
[26:31.840 --> 26:42.560]  support the president, Vault 7, CIA can stage fake Russian hacking to undermine Trump.
[26:42.560 --> 26:48.360]  And Russian communications part of inquiry into Trump's associates, New York Times, remember
[26:48.360 --> 26:55.840]  they said that over a month ago but now they say they never spied on anybody and it turns
[26:55.840 --> 27:02.480]  out they were spying on the attorney general then a senator when he met with the Russian
[27:02.480 --> 27:07.360]  ambassador that was totally normal.
[27:07.360 --> 27:12.720]  Mickey Leakes unveils Vault 7, the largest ever publication of confidential CIA documents,
[27:12.720 --> 27:20.720]  another Snowden emergence, it's not Snowden, Snowden was part of a larger operation and
[27:20.720 --> 27:24.120]  we've told you there's more Snowden's and William Benny and Thomas Drake have told
[27:24.120 --> 27:27.320]  you there's more Snowden's and they're getting ready to release things even bigger and they
[27:27.320 --> 27:33.960]  released all the stuff on the Democrats you saw which is only the literal tip of the iceberg.
[27:33.960 --> 27:39.080]  Below that tip is 99% of the stuff and it's everything, oh you want them to release how
[27:39.080 --> 27:52.240]  Obama had Michael Hastings blown up, they all witnessed his car out of control explode,
[27:52.240 --> 27:55.880]  the engines shot down the road hundreds of yards but oh nothing happened, let me tell
[27:55.880 --> 28:05.520]  you my car blows up in the middle of the street, it's a bomb.
[28:05.520 --> 28:10.440]  What did Hastings know, Hastings found out about all this and more and he said we're
[28:10.440 --> 28:14.640]  at war with the government and most of the media is bought off there at war with the
[28:14.640 --> 28:18.280]  people and I'm going to be exposing it all soon, it's unbelievable and he had learned
[28:18.280 --> 28:24.600]  it all but see how was that wife of his, the head person, the only aide allowed into the
[28:24.600 --> 28:28.800]  meetings of the National Security Council, she was at the funeral, I talked to people
[28:28.800 --> 28:33.840]  that were there and she said oh yeah they murdered him but then she went on CNN a few
[28:33.840 --> 28:39.000]  months later and said oh nothing happened, it was all completely normal, Michael Hastings
[28:39.000 --> 28:47.720]  was a government agent, he was with an agency and he decided that things were so horrible
[28:47.720 --> 28:54.600]  he learned about it, he's going to go public, what could that be, what could be so horrible
[28:54.600 --> 28:58.320]  that people that are not death and killing all the time say it's too much, well it's
[28:58.320 --> 29:09.840]  called the abuse of children and so you already see the procurers of children being arrested
[29:09.840 --> 29:14.240]  by the thousands all over the country caught, they'll catch them with 30 plus kids in a
[29:14.240 --> 29:21.280]  dungeon and it's in one news article in LA or one article in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia,
[29:21.280 --> 29:26.520]  normally that'd be all to the news wouldn't it, let's see oh it gets, the police do their
[29:26.520 --> 29:33.240]  job it comes out but then it gets shut down, so there's a civil war going on against the
[29:33.240 --> 29:36.600]  white hats and the black hats in the government, let me give you the news, the white hats have
[29:36.600 --> 29:41.160]  the initiative, the numbers, the bad guys are on top but Trump is in a civil war trying
[29:41.160 --> 29:45.280]  to clean them out right now, so we got the guy on top, we're all below, we're going
[29:45.280 --> 29:49.840]  to meet in the middle of a pincer attack and we're unstoppable if we pray to God.
[29:49.840 --> 30:00.360]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.360 --> 30:05.920]  The story is up on infowars.com aggregated by the Daily Caller, New York Times columnist
[30:05.920 --> 30:12.800]  encourages IRS agents to commit felony by leaking Trump's tax returns to his newspaper.
[30:12.800 --> 30:18.040]  He tweets, if you're in the IRS and have a certain president's tax return that you'd
[30:18.040 --> 30:23.480]  like to leak, my address is, and he lists the address of the New York Times, this is
[30:23.480 --> 30:29.120]  Nicholas Kristoff tweeting, a liberal who writes about global affairs was responding
[30:29.120 --> 30:36.000]  to a tweet by Vox.com editor Matt Iglesias who marveled that the IRS rarely leaks tax
[30:36.000 --> 30:37.000]  information.
[30:37.000 --> 30:42.600]  One reason for that is because doing so constitutes a felony, folks, the unauthorized release
[30:42.600 --> 30:49.400]  of an individual's tax returns is punishable by a fine of $5,000 and up to five years in
[30:49.400 --> 30:50.400]  prison.
[30:50.400 --> 30:54.840]  Leakers would also likely face a series of professional sanctions.
[30:54.840 --> 30:59.840]  This is Ashley Beckford reporting for infowars.com.

[32:00.480 --> 32:05.420]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[32:05.420 --> 32:08.760]  before it became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk.
[32:08.760 --> 32:11.920]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com.
[32:11.920 --> 32:17.240]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom and
[32:17.240 --> 32:21.640]  seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[32:21.640 --> 32:22.640]  Caveman.
[32:22.640 --> 32:26.520]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[32:26.520 --> 32:30.520]  superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[32:30.520 --> 32:33.160]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[32:33.160 --> 32:38.360]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength,
[32:38.360 --> 32:42.640]  for the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces
[32:42.640 --> 32:43.760]  the blood for the body.
[32:43.760 --> 32:46.320]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[32:46.320 --> 32:50.640]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[32:50.640 --> 32:54.280]  to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[32:54.280 --> 32:58.720]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at infowarslife.com
[32:58.720 --> 33:02.720]  today.

[33:05.400 --> 33:16.240]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[33:16.240 --> 33:23.040]  We're building the new new world order one based on nation states and based on industry
[33:23.040 --> 33:26.920]  and ideas and based on innovation.
[33:26.920 --> 33:32.280]  We're building the new new world order on the ashes of the parasitic corporate world
[33:32.280 --> 33:37.000]  government that wanted to create a monopoly over humanity and merge with machines claiming
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.240]  we were obsolete.
[33:39.240 --> 33:46.720]  The humans against the psychopaths and their machines are now beginning to strike back.
[33:46.720 --> 33:49.360]  Roger stones coming up here in a few minutes with big news.
[33:49.360 --> 33:53.360]  I talked to him last week and he said watch you're going to see massive stuff unraveling
[33:53.360 --> 33:58.320]  this Russia situation very, very quickly and I had the same Intel and now Trump is struck
[33:58.320 --> 33:59.320]  back.
[33:59.320 --> 34:04.840]  The intelligence agencies have struck back this huge data dump vault seven the largest
[34:04.840 --> 34:08.040]  ever publication of confidential CIA documents.
[34:08.040 --> 34:12.960]  Everything we told you is in there because everything we told you was either reverse
[34:12.960 --> 34:18.320]  engineered in government documents from whistleblowers you name it we studied the big picture integrated
[34:18.320 --> 34:23.800]  the Intel what the globalist said they were building.
[34:23.800 --> 34:28.720]  Now we have the short report that I'm going to our guest it's about three minutes long
[34:28.720 --> 34:35.960]  it's called zombified and it deals with real videos no matter where we go around the country
[34:35.960 --> 34:39.760]  the majority of the anti Trump people are violent they're hateful they're screaming
[34:39.760 --> 34:44.520]  they're yelling and they are tasering people attacking you name it this weekend it's all
[34:44.520 --> 34:48.720]  over the news just tasering old ladies you name it they seem to attack the weakest people
[34:48.720 --> 34:58.400]  too it's like a total coward instinct a predator instinct the anti sheepdog instinct and I'm
[34:58.400 --> 35:04.120]  really concerned because with the Prozac the drugs the TVs the lowered IQs the mesmerized
[35:04.120 --> 35:09.920]  state the weakest amongst us have been turned into literal zombies because they have low
[35:09.920 --> 35:13.320]  brain waves they're in a near sleep state and they all have their tongue hanging out
[35:13.320 --> 35:18.200]  they go like body statues it's like at the end of the body statues she's running around
[35:18.200 --> 35:23.240]  Washington you know the remake of the 70s she goes oh it's you and he goes I mean that's
[35:23.240 --> 35:26.960]  what they've turned into thank God we're not these people here's Paul Watson's report then
[35:26.960 --> 35:34.200]  we're going to Roger Stone with what's the biggest news ever vault seven then this is
[35:34.200 --> 35:40.000]  only the beginning biggest yet more is coming here it is and now for something completely
[35:40.000 --> 36:09.840]  different when there's no more room in hell the dead will walk here
[36:09.840 --> 36:26.960]  see her even the black people look like they're like zombies wait give her a chance when she
[36:26.960 --> 36:40.800]  calms down she might have an actual argument I know what you're thinking this is just one
[36:40.800 --> 36:57.280]  individual this isn't an accurate portrayal of the reasoned credible legitimate anti-trump
[36:57.280 --> 37:11.120]  this is what they teach the colleges they didn't bring them in they put a play-doh
[37:11.120 --> 37:21.680]  this is what they do these are the nicer ones that don't attack the yuppies go f you get
[37:21.680 --> 37:38.760]  in your face bring your kids I mean they're just entitled hate filled scum joking aside
[37:38.760 --> 37:43.360]  this is the effect that the mainstream media is having on people this is what happens when
[37:43.360 --> 37:48.240]  you tell people over and over again that Trump is going to bring about the apocalypse this
[37:48.240 --> 37:54.360]  is what mass hysteria looks like this is what happens when collective insanity is legitimized
[37:54.360 --> 38:19.520]  by the darem race three trillion and it's sweeping America there's no more room in hell the dead
[38:19.520 --> 38:25.000]  should know it's actually worse to watch info wars.com for my show video list if you want
[38:25.000 --> 38:28.560]  to see the feed regardless spread that link folks we're in info war here I want to take
[38:28.560 --> 38:33.760]  the country back this is it America wasn't going to be easy to take down by the globalist
[38:33.760 --> 38:38.920]  that one up last night only has 347,000 views that sounds good a lot of polls videos get
[38:38.920 --> 38:44.880]  five 10 million 15 million 20 million 30 million views so again I really I think this video
[38:44.880 --> 38:49.520]  is zombified anti-Trump protestor goes nuts but you understand this is the attitude it's
[38:49.520 --> 38:53.800]  total selfishness I'm in charge I'm your God by the way at the end of that video there's
[38:53.800 --> 38:56.680]  an ad for Roger Stone's book which they've been censoring all over not living on the
[38:56.680 --> 39:02.920]  New York Times bestselling list it's the making of the president 2016 available at info wars
[39:02.920 --> 39:07.560]  store.com that also helps our broadcast by the way I saw it last night and tweeted it
[39:07.560 --> 39:12.320]  Roger Stone has had his Twitter account taken for 24 hours and they say there's more work
[39:12.320 --> 39:17.760]  you may need to do to give us value and build us up you know you're the reason Twitter exists
[39:17.760 --> 39:23.280]  but he's tweeting about what's happening he's a major political player he can't exist well
[39:23.280 --> 39:27.640]  let's go to my Twitter and show a screenshot this Twitter is gone right now of what he
[39:27.640 --> 39:30.920]  was told on his Twitter dashboard that you've done something bad we're not going to tell
[39:30.920 --> 39:36.160]  you what it's very Kafka-esque beyond 1984 we're not going to tell you what's happened
[39:36.160 --> 39:40.360]  and you're banned for 24 hours and they're quote maybe more work you've got to do that's
[39:40.360 --> 39:43.960]  on real Alex Jones on Twitter if you want to see that that's why it's more important
[39:43.960 --> 39:47.720]  than ever I was so focused yesterday with all that was about to come out you know it's
[39:47.720 --> 39:53.280]  not even plugged yesterday but one time that's right let's do a screenshot of that there's
[39:53.280 --> 39:57.320]  a screenshot I tweeted out I know that that's it you have been determined that has violated
[39:57.320 --> 40:01.080]  the Twitter rules so you will need to wait some time before using Twitter again won't
[40:01.080 --> 40:05.280]  tell you what you did you will be able to unlock your account 11 hours 57 minutes that's
[40:05.280 --> 40:09.000]  the time we got a screenshot notice you may need to complete some additional tasks to
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.560]  resume using Twitter and they also don't let it most of his tweets be seen by people on
[40:13.560 --> 40:17.080]  Twitter it's all about being game you say well why are we on Twitter and Facebook because
[40:17.080 --> 40:22.080]  that's where the zombies are and we're desperately trying to reach in to find out who may still
[40:22.080 --> 40:29.320]  be partly awake so follow him at Roger Stone Junior follow him follow us at real Alex Jones

[43:09.440 --> 43:13.720]  then you later learn they're a real person senior in it and that they really gave you
[43:13.720 --> 43:16.520]  real information you're like what the hell happened there I'm being set up you're like
[43:16.520 --> 43:21.680]  shredding the info this kind of stuff happened like 18 years ago in SA you name it but it's
[43:21.680 --> 43:27.480]  happened so much now and we built the info war to fight it and I was never involved with
[43:27.480 --> 43:32.240]  intelligence agencies I didn't realize that I had people that had been involved in them
[43:32.240 --> 43:37.000]  that didn't like what was happening leading me helping me mentoring me people like Vic
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.600]  Vreeland who was in Air Force intelligence and saw a lot of action in Vietnam said you're
[43:41.600 --> 43:45.160]  going to be the info war that's what you do let's let's get this site here it's yours
[43:45.160 --> 43:50.640]  he was a fire department chief here in Austin Deputy Fire Chief great guy won't come on
[43:50.640 --> 43:54.080]  the show he lives out in Mass Drop and says I am really old now great job Alex I'm done
[43:54.080 --> 43:59.080]  fighting but it was like I was given all the intel just constantly by Patriots and like
[43:59.080 --> 44:03.080]  what was happening so then all these other people were like who is this guy what government
[44:03.080 --> 44:06.440]  has he worked for so they investigated me looked at and said no this guy's a natural
[44:06.440 --> 44:10.800]  and then we built the info war we did all this and we've kicked their ass and so going
[44:10.800 --> 44:14.440]  back more than 15 years all these major intelligence agencies I'ma skip the brakes we have more
[44:14.440 --> 44:19.200]  time with Roger we're told the Patriot group said listen Alex Jones that's the channel
[44:19.200 --> 44:23.720]  so we became the real voice of America despite all our problems and I'm not perfect and so
[44:23.720 --> 44:28.520]  now most of the intelligence agencies are aware they're involved they were already aware
[44:28.520 --> 44:34.360]  but our show crystallized it all organized people and now the globalists are in trouble
[44:34.360 --> 44:38.360]  and they Trump comes out I'm being spied on knowing they'd lie then all the data comes
[44:38.360 --> 44:42.720]  out that he was spied on that they were having servers pinging him trying to set him and
[44:42.720 --> 44:47.520]  stone up it's all coming out folks this is the counter strike by Trump and the Patriots
[44:47.520 --> 44:54.200]  this is so legend Roger is this not incredible my friend Alex I think we are on the cusp
[44:54.200 --> 45:01.280]  of the greatest single political scandal in American history I think it is a scandal
[45:01.280 --> 45:08.960]  that will hasten and accelerate the realignment going on in this country the deep state has
[45:08.960 --> 45:15.440]  been hit with a double whammy they have gotten caught spying on the nominee of one of the
[45:15.440 --> 45:22.800]  two major parties and their rationale their phony rationale for that spying has now been
[45:22.800 --> 45:31.720]  disproved we now know indisputably despite the claims of Barack Obama and the disinformation
[45:31.720 --> 45:39.120]  pumped out by James Clapper that the Obama administration on the basis of no evidence
[45:39.120 --> 45:47.640]  whatsoever and no probable cause went to the FISA court the secret super secret FISA court
[45:47.640 --> 45:54.800]  first in June requesting that Donald Trump and his associates including yours truly we
[45:54.800 --> 46:01.680]  put under surveillance and they were we believe denied we now know that they went back in
[46:01.680 --> 46:09.400]  October with something more narrowly drawn as far as the candidate Trump is concerned
[46:09.400 --> 46:18.720]  and this secret warrant to spy on the Republican nominee for president was approved it is unclear
[46:18.720 --> 46:25.320]  whether the monitoring of my own email my own text messages my own cell phone calls
[46:25.320 --> 46:35.920]  beat was approved in June or in October but it was indeed approved so this this is the
[46:35.920 --> 46:43.400]  naked political manipulation of the system of the government system Richard Nixon went
[46:43.400 --> 46:49.920]  down for Watergate he didn't know about Watergate in advance he didn't approve it it did not
[46:49.920 --> 46:55.360]  utilize government agents other than perhaps the CIA agents sent to Roger this is exactly
[46:55.360 --> 47:02.120]  and you were involved in all this is 50 times bigger here it is Catherine Herdige top level
[47:02.120 --> 47:06.720]  state operatives leak Flynn phone call transcripts we already know that but when she goes on Fox
[47:06.720 --> 47:11.680]  News she's heavily embedded with the CIA and defense intelligence you name it when that
[47:11.680 --> 47:15.880]  lady I got a spy chief gets on there and says that you know they're totally turning on him
[47:15.880 --> 47:20.240]  and didn't Trump set him up having him deny it for three days before all this comes out
[47:20.240 --> 47:25.080]  let's be clear this didn't come from the Russians this came from the central intelligence agency
[47:25.080 --> 47:30.160]  and I was told a week ago get ready for the next hammer to drop next week relax Alex Trump's
[47:30.160 --> 47:33.880]  on it and so they won a war with Trump man that is showing he knows what he's doing
[47:33.880 --> 47:39.240]  yeah no it's quite extraordinary look at the president Obama's carefully parsed response
[47:39.240 --> 47:45.240]  he didn't order the surveillance he's going to try to lay this off on Loretta Lynch says
[47:45.240 --> 47:51.320]  if his attorney general ordering is not him the buck stops with him Nixon bore responsible
[47:51.320 --> 47:56.120]  ability for what happened on his watch and he went down this went down on Obama's watch
[47:56.120 --> 48:01.760]  there is no doubt whatsoever that you would spy on one of the two major party candidates
[48:01.760 --> 48:06.920]  for president without solid evidence of a need to do so of a criminal nature without the
[48:06.920 --> 48:14.960]  president doing so they this is was a puff of air this was a Clinton campaign press release
[48:14.960 --> 48:19.280]  there still are according to the House Intelligence Committee and I'm going to give you this tape
[48:19.280 --> 48:26.560]  shortly no evidence whatsoever of a contact between the campaign associates of down from
[48:26.560 --> 48:30.600]  those would include your sure that's all old news let Roger I don't know if you had chances
[48:30.600 --> 48:35.520]  last night when this came out I've got as many people as I can on this vault seven is
[48:35.520 --> 48:40.400]  the whole map how they could kill airplanes how they could kill cars how they were trying
[48:40.400 --> 48:47.640]  to set Trump up with false flags with Russian servers how they were planning all of this
[48:47.640 --> 48:53.200]  how they were putting out this info how they how they were bribing and blackmailing Congress
[48:53.200 --> 48:57.280]  I mean this makes the original WikiLeaks and the stuff that came out during the campaign
[48:57.280 --> 49:02.720]  look like child's play this is a hydrogen bomb dropped on the criminal deep state by
[49:02.720 --> 49:07.920]  the patriots in the deep state this is the biggest scandal ever this this is mega massive
[49:07.920 --> 49:11.960]  I don't know what they can do and you see even the Fox News analysts that had been kind
[49:11.960 --> 49:18.000]  of stabbing Trump in the back all suddenly turning against Obama and and Holder and Lynch
[49:18.000 --> 49:25.200]  and Clapper and Brennan I mean this is amazing now the dirty tricks and the tactics of the
[49:25.200 --> 49:30.960]  deep state have now been you know exposed for everybody to see these these criminals
[49:30.960 --> 49:36.520]  have to be dragged in front of a grand jury one by one in all honesty I don't think a
[49:36.520 --> 49:41.760]  congressional inquiry is the way to go I don't we need indictments under national security
[49:41.760 --> 49:45.640]  for illegal spying and sabotage for private corporate interests against the United States
[49:45.640 --> 49:50.280]  of America it's espionage it's a new talk though it's corporate espionage against the
[49:50.280 --> 49:57.760]  republic that's what globalism is it is it is not wise to go to congress for a totally
[49:57.760 --> 50:04.680]  politicized investigation in which mattering the bobs of negativism like Elijah Cummings
[50:04.680 --> 50:10.640]  lather on and on about the CIA and these allegations without a shred of they've all called for
[50:10.640 --> 50:14.600]  the president to be overthrown the media is called for him to be killed I'm not the one
[50:14.600 --> 50:19.520]  calling for violence they're the ones I think they're very close to really getting in some
[50:19.520 --> 50:25.320]  big trouble this is why I think AG session should unrequise himself yes last year is
[50:25.320 --> 50:29.400]  very clear the president hits it out of the park with the state of the union he's got
[50:29.400 --> 50:33.600]  a head of wind for his agenda that's right Trump was already planning all this but he's
[50:33.600 --> 50:38.640]  not telling the subgroups and that's why whoever do you have word on who told sessions to recuse
[50:38.640 --> 50:44.200]  himself and why Trump blew up Thursday I have no I have no information on this but here's
[50:44.200 --> 50:48.240]  what I know here's the sequence Trump's knocks it out of the park the deep state leaks the
[50:48.240 --> 50:52.480]  session stuff to try to take the wind out of the president's sails Trump comes right back
[50:52.480 --> 50:58.240]  with the with the wire capping at Trump tower upping the knowing this was about to be released
[50:58.240 --> 51:05.960]  by the master keep going so in my view here sessions should not recuse himself or better
[51:05.960 --> 51:13.240]  yet let's appoint a hard-nosed lawman special prosecutor and give him a grand jury ash Carter
[51:13.240 --> 51:17.920]  James Clapper John Brennan these men need to be in front of a grand jury let's find
[51:17.920 --> 51:22.720]  out what they knew and when they know it there let's find out who the leakers are let's drag
[51:22.720 --> 51:28.760]  the whole first and second level of the Obama State Department and sure Roger Roger gets
[51:28.760 --> 51:33.440]  in to the bottom of this it's in the CIA data dump that they were trying to set up Trump
[51:33.440 --> 51:39.760]  in his confidants with fake servers from Russia and fake cyber attacks so we now know we have
[51:39.760 --> 51:43.440]  the head of the intelligence committee in the house saying no evidence no phone calls no
[51:43.440 --> 51:47.880]  nothing so they've been caught with a bluff of surveillance they did the surveillance
[51:47.880 --> 51:50.560]  now they're trying to say they didn't do it even though a month ago they bragged they
[51:50.560 --> 51:54.720]  do it they are up the creek without a paddle yeah it's very interesting the way had they
[51:54.720 --> 52:00.040]  have inadvertently blurted out their game Hillary Clinton tweets just days before the
[52:00.040 --> 52:05.840]  election that computer scientists have located a server in connection with Russia at Trump
[52:05.840 --> 52:11.760]  Tower clearly is that a confection do you think computer scientists who work where the central
[52:11.760 --> 52:17.920]  intelligence agency busted busted she knew the whole thing in advance they were all in
[52:17.920 --> 52:21.760]  on it well here's their problem it's all here now it's all here that they were running fake
[52:21.760 --> 52:25.800]  servers trying to spoof the IP addresses of Trump Tower the intelligence community saw
[52:25.800 --> 52:30.400]  through it these traders they put the CIA we probably outnumber them you know just in
[52:30.400 --> 52:34.000]  the Liberty Movement also in government five to one is the number I'm getting from good
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.280]  sources don't they get they're sitting right next to people that know they're the enemy
[52:38.280 --> 52:43.640]  Roger it is it is quite extraordinary but as I told you earlier Alex today the most
[52:43.640 --> 52:49.440]  amazing thing to me is the extent to which the president is hard driving on policy not
[52:49.440 --> 52:54.560]  deviating on any of the policies that he pledged whether it's restoration of Glass-Steagall
[52:54.560 --> 53:02.040]  breakup of Dodd Frank building the wall cutting tax Obamacare's about to get deep six Obamacare's
[53:02.040 --> 53:07.880]  in deep trouble they ban the tranny bathroom crap there but I mean just all of it's happening
[53:07.880 --> 53:12.520]  at the same time however he is filling a government with quizzling this is my deepest
[53:12.520 --> 53:19.000]  concern for him Anthony Scaramucci widely respected and even revered by conservatives
[53:19.000 --> 53:25.000]  a man who did yeoman service to the Trump campaign by raising money and in providing
[53:25.000 --> 53:30.880]  wise counsel a man who is a personal friend of the president essentially squeezed out
[53:30.880 --> 53:35.560]  of a white let me stop you that's from suddenly problem a bush guy I understand that we'll
[53:35.560 --> 53:41.120]  do a whole other show on the appointments but it's true that he's still doing his agenda
[53:41.120 --> 53:45.480]  but it's previous and others that admittedly are the ones telling people to resign tell
[53:45.480 --> 53:49.120]  people to recuse themselves and Trump's blowing up he needs to get rid of those people Roger
[53:49.120 --> 53:52.400]  we'll talk to you again soon Paul Watson's in the fourth hour today but if you want to
[53:52.400 --> 53:56.280]  come on the nightly news tonight to get a 20 30 minutes without any breaks to really lay
[53:56.280 --> 54:00.480]  all this out we'll do it and talk about the bad side of what's happening with Trump he's
[54:00.480 --> 54:04.120]  doing great in his agenda he's got great people in the intelligence agencies but he's got
[54:04.120 --> 54:08.280]  a lot of politicos I guess as a business guy you bring in the folks that used to run stuff
[54:08.280 --> 54:11.480]  you think they'll follow your orders they don't and so I think that's just one blind
[54:11.480 --> 54:14.680]  spot but maybe he knows something I don't know thank you so much Roger we'll talk to
[54:14.680 --> 54:18.960]  you soon let's definitely do the news tonight because there is so much breaking news between
[54:18.960 --> 54:22.600]  now and then I will learn much that are let them know when you want to take it or come
[54:22.600 --> 54:25.880]  on live thank you all right joining us in this segment of the next and a little bit more
[54:25.880 --> 54:31.320]  than we got a bunch of other guests joining us we are learning so much now Dr. Steve Pacinic
[54:31.320 --> 54:35.720]  of course was at the State Department's head of psychological operations and other agencies
[54:35.720 --> 54:41.200]  and of course with involvement with Delta Force the founding of that he has a lot of
[54:41.200 --> 54:46.520]  great sources he's been spot on I certainly have all my sources separate from his but
[54:46.520 --> 54:53.280]  there so I don't know his view yet on vault seven I just know it comes out of the CIA
[54:53.280 --> 54:58.200]  as in it as to show what criminal elements the deep state are doing as a direct counter
[54:58.200 --> 55:02.360]  to the criminal deep state trying to block this America agenda and our president and
[55:02.360 --> 55:05.720]  the fact they tried to set the president up as a Russian that's all in here that they're
[55:05.720 --> 55:10.560]  the ones doing it and literally in trucks outside trying to spoof from side peas and
[55:10.560 --> 55:15.800]  so Congress has seen through it Fox News has seen through it I think we're seeing a collapse
[55:15.800 --> 55:20.920]  of the old establishment this this criminal globalist system right now I'm very euphoric
[55:20.920 --> 55:24.720]  but but we'll see if Pachinic incurs not a Pachinic thanks for joining us Steve Pachinic
[55:24.720 --> 55:30.080]  dot com co-author of Tom Clancy of course as well what do you make of all this well
[55:30.080 --> 55:36.360]  as I told you before and for some time now we've had we have had a civilian military
[55:36.360 --> 55:42.040]  confrontation in the intelligence community much of what you're seeing now in vault seven
[55:42.040 --> 55:50.640]  which is a release of over 9000 pieces of information was forewarned several months ago to me I knew
[55:50.640 --> 55:56.040]  this would be a continuation of you said more big leaks are coming if they don't back off
[55:56.040 --> 56:01.680]  excuse me you said more big leaks are coming if they don't back off it's not just a leak
[56:01.680 --> 56:07.120]  let me put it this way Alex we have a far more serious issue as I told you before when
[56:07.120 --> 56:13.480]  we initiated a counter coup against Hillary this is once again an attempt to get rid of
[56:13.480 --> 56:19.560]  all those people who are impairing and this and distracting from Trump's agendas Roger
[56:19.560 --> 56:25.960]  said but it's far more serious this time around the reason why these leaks were given
[56:25.960 --> 56:33.160]  was to simply take down the CIA the CIA as I've said for the 30 years since 9 11 and
[56:33.160 --> 56:37.880]  elsewhere has been out of control it has been out of control this why are there so many
[56:37.880 --> 56:43.560]  people in the CIA that are for this for why are there so many people in the CIA that are
[56:43.560 --> 56:48.960]  for this for what for vault seven for all this coming out well because they're good
[56:48.960 --> 56:54.880]  people the CIA is not monolithic what happened under John Brennan what happened under Obama
[56:54.880 --> 57:00.600]  this is a strict indictment of Obama and what happened with the increased surveillance of
[57:00.600 --> 57:07.000]  the CIA during the past eight years and the previous eight years under Bush Jr. and what
[57:07.000 --> 57:13.400]  happened about the honorable people within the CIA realized that this was a mandate that
[57:13.400 --> 57:20.440]  had been exceeded in other words this is criminal action for the CIA to go into cyber communications
[57:20.440 --> 57:27.040]  to put in literally leftist globalist using the CIA and NSA power to subvert the republic
[57:27.040 --> 57:32.280]  well let me be a little bit more expansive than that this is not just the leftist and
[57:32.280 --> 57:39.080]  the globalist this involves John D Rockefeller who was head of the Senate Intelligence Committee
[57:39.080 --> 57:45.160]  this involves Susan Collins this involves Mark Rubio this involves Diana Feinstein this
[57:45.160 --> 57:51.280]  involves many people who are over the Senate Intelligence Committee who were aware of this
[57:51.280 --> 57:56.760]  for over eight to twelve years and did nothing they allowed this criminal action that there
[57:56.760 --> 58:02.040]  is no question this is a criminal action the reason this was released by my people and
[58:02.040 --> 58:09.120]  others who are literally caring for the republic and use Alex Jones as a means to get to the
[58:09.120 --> 58:15.440]  people of the United States was a simple fact that we can no longer maintain covert aspects
[58:15.440 --> 58:21.240]  to the CIA and cyber communication one of the most important things that was released
[58:21.240 --> 58:27.680]  very many several months ago and nobody realized it was zero day which was a film on Netflix
[58:27.680 --> 58:32.680]  and Michael Flint and now Gerald Michael Hayden was in it and a bunch of others stay there

[1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:10.160]  all coming out the data dump has begun now let's go back to dr steve pacenek you were
[1:01:10.160 --> 1:01:15.480]  getting into the fact that major things are happening go ahead what this is is a game changer
[1:01:15.480 --> 1:01:20.960]  what's happening in effect is that our community in the intelligence community both civilian
[1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:26.240]  and military what they're interested in is warning the american public and the world
[1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:35.240]  that the so-called smart appliances let's say a phone smart tv samsung sony even your
[1:01:35.240 --> 1:01:43.080]  smart car is totally vulnerable to the nsa and in particular the cia now the nsa always
[1:01:43.080 --> 1:01:49.040]  had the mandate for cyber command and cyber warfare the individual and the institution
[1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:56.240]  that never had the command or the mandate was the cia it has to release its mandate
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:02.040]  or it will be prosecuted for crimes against the state and it is already committed crimes
[1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:06.720]  against the state remember when you and i first started one of the reasons why i was
[1:02:06.720 --> 1:02:12.040]  so pleased to come on your show and to continue to be on the show was the fact that you represented
[1:02:12.040 --> 1:02:17.400]  the american public and you were not in any way influenced by mainstream media the nine
[1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:23.440]  eleven issue was so embarrassing to our military where they were literally bushwhacked into
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:30.000]  a war and they were bushwhacked into a war by none other than the civilian cia and john
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  brandon was a major element george tenon peter goss a whole group of congressmen and senators
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:44.320]  who eventually became honorable or whatever else they did they were criminals in return
[1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:49.840]  that the intelligence community said we no longer want to be part of a republic which
[1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:55.880]  dukes the american public and that was why i was used as the mouthpiece and the individual
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:03:01.480]  to relate it to the american public as long as you and i and the american people understood
[1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:06.920]  that the republic had to be paramount and that the individual was supreme in this republic
[1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:10.120]  well by the way i don't want to brag because i've known this for a long time that's crazy
[1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:13.640]  i'm not part of the intelligence agency i just was an american patriot resisting this
[1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:19.000]  tyranny but going back eighteen years ago fifteen years ago than twelve years ago i've
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:23.920]  now confirmed with all these folks in seal team six and dealt the force of special operations
[1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:27.440]  their commanders would come in and say you're to listen to alex jones we can't tell you
[1:03:27.440 --> 1:03:31.280]  all this but he's figured it out i can legally tell you you're ordered to listen to that
[1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:36.040]  and from deep inside all these agencies they back i would even that good fifteen years
[1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:39.440]  ago but you were coming on then they were ordered to listen to me so it's not the whole
[1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:44.480]  agencies but what was this ordering them to listen to me fifteen years ago what's that
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:49.600]  well what did happen and with all due respect to you i know you're quite modest but the
[1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:57.280]  issue was that you were able to stand forth as a fighter you were a fighter within the
[1:03:57.280 --> 1:04:03.760]  business of news now at that time nobody understood what the alternative media was no one could
[1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:10.320]  understand how could a young man from austin texas garner such a reputation and garner
[1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:17.240]  i a huge audience of over eighteen million when you and i kept talking and it started
[1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:23.040]  with angazi it started with nine eleven it was with a nonsense of osama ben laden the
[1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:28.840]  credibility that you created within the audience and within your own narrative was so important
[1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:34.760]  to our intelligence community that they understood this was a venue to talk to the public they
[1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:40.240]  don't need david singer they don't need any of their david ignatius of the washington
[1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:44.720]  post they don't need any of these reporters that's why what you're seeing in the in the
[1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:49.200]  press and on tv is the death and i've said it for a while let's talk about how we come
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:52.640]  back in seventy seconds we'll have the floor to talk about where we go from here what we
[1:04:52.640 --> 1:04:57.280]  expect next how the criminal elements the deep space deep state will strike back but
[1:04:57.280 --> 1:05:02.800]  dr steve pochennick stay with us i'm alex shuns supreme court scraps obama's tyranny
[1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:08.080]  bathroom policy the supreme court stepped away from an obama administration policy
[1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:14.320]  allowing public school students to use whatever bathroom fits their self-described so-called
[1:05:14.320 --> 1:05:20.320]  quote gender identity the court rejected a challenge from a transgender student gavin
[1:05:20.320 --> 1:05:26.080]  grim who with the help from the aclu sued a school board which restricted bathroom use
[1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:32.560]  to biological genders only the fourth circuit court of appeals had ruled in favor of grim
[1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:38.480]  because the obama administration told schools to consider a student's quote gender identity
[1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:43.680]  when deciding bathroom policies in a quote guidance letter the administration issued
[1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:49.600]  through the department of education however the trump administration has since rescinded that policy
[1:05:49.600 --> 1:05:54.880]  stating that states rights need to be respected which lead to the supreme court blocking the
[1:05:54.880 --> 1:06:02.560]  fourth circuits ruling this is ashleigh beckford for info wars dot com this is alex jones i want

[1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:20.000]  scientists and the answer is clear iodine is key is paramount and there's still so much new
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:25.680]  information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it in our quest for the purest iodine
[1:07:25.680 --> 1:07:31.760]  we drill down more than 7000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals to extract the ultra pure
[1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:37.360]  iodine on top of that we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling it is the purest
[1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:42.400]  cleanest strongest out there quite frankly i'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield
[1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:46.880]  nasa and iodine that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors
[1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:51.600]  to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we
[1:07:51.600 --> 1:08:09.520]  have it is exclusive to info wars life dot com and the info wars life family of incredible products
[1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:22.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-up you want to stop tyranny well so does he live

[1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:35.200]  shotgun when this is the bottom of the hour columnist read by millions a week the economic
[1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:39.760]  collapse blog dot com hopefully we can stop that you know but trump's able to turn the jobs back on
[1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:43.680]  which he's doing a pretty good job of but a lot of the globalist operations like goldman's action
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:47.280]  jp Morgan admit they're trying to actually implode the economy consolidated despite the fact
[1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:53.360]  they've seen record profits under trump best small business numbers since the 1984 recovery of reagan
[1:08:53.360 --> 1:08:58.640]  that's official news exxon mobile announcing hundreds of billions of dollars of investment
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:04.320]  the next six years six four years on the texas and Louisiana coast i mean it's just daily these huge
[1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:08.480]  announcements that we're open for business again that we won't prohibit you coming here and doing
[1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:14.080]  things that's what globalism is was selling off american assets selling off the fact that we had
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:18.800]  more than half the world's wealth 30 years ago dr c pochenix rodin shotgun with us as well
[1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:24.880]  co-author with tom clancy filmmaker of course involved in a lot of different agencies and
[1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:28.960]  helped broker the camp david accords founder of delta force with general boykin and schumacher
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:33.280]  and others and he can seriously come on and tells you there's been a major war inside the government
[1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:37.760]  a civil war a deep state war he's been saying that for several years and now it's all over the news
[1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:44.720]  today so really what's happened is what happens now that 9 000 documents come out or 9 000 pages
[1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:49.920]  vault 7 the largest ever publication of confidential cia documents that's released today massive
[1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:54.800]  coverage in four wars dot com and they admit we're remote controlling people's cars and blowing them
[1:09:54.800 --> 1:10:01.440]  up uh they admit uh yeah we're breaking into your phones in your and watching and listening to you
[1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:05.760]  and your smart tv's well that was all the terms and service we told you about that 15 years ago
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:12.560]  but it's all here now so what happens is what we've covered here becomes so mainstream and even
[1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:17.760]  fox news and cnr force reported and obama's dumb enough to say we're not surveilling president
[1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:25.040]  trump or general flinn when a month ago they said they were in the news so you're seeing that these
[1:10:25.040 --> 1:10:30.960]  losers are so arrogant they think they're invincible obama set up this office two miles away from
[1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:37.360]  trump saying he's going to overthrow it and holder says he's coming he's coming like he's christ i mean
[1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:43.920]  i'm not a psychiatrist like dr pacinic but i mean this is delusional crap and i don't want us to be
[1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:48.640]  delusional either we're in the fight of our lives but we're getting the initiative trump isn't a coward
[1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:52.800]  he knows what he's doing and so this is an amazing time to be alive right now dr pacinic i want to
[1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:57.120]  go to our guests and have you go back and forth but i mean what would you say this time is we're
[1:10:57.120 --> 1:11:01.680]  alive in right now that last night or the same question i mean is this not one of the most
[1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:07.600]  important times in u.s history so from the very beginning since 9 11 and the fact that we
[1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:14.160]  continue this is a second american revolution this is as clear as it becomes when the entire
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:21.680]  regime was changed legally and it was changed thanks to you the internet alternative media
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:28.960]  social media and it was a new type of revolution by the press doesn't understand it and economically
[1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:36.240]  we are changing because brexit is breaking up germany is now coming to see uh trump china has
[1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:42.240]  to deal with trump japan had to deal with trump and your guests will explain why the economic
[1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:48.400]  dimensions are even more serious but the reason why this was dumped out again if you want to call it
[1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:54.400]  another counter coup on our behalf where we did it against illy we did it against obama now we're
[1:11:54.400 --> 1:12:01.040]  doing it so that we can bring into the forefront the issue of cyberspace and cyber command and
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:06.080]  cyber warfare that's what my people both civilian and military said three years ago snowden was a
[1:12:06.080 --> 1:12:10.320]  deep state deal to cut the wings of these out of control agencies you've been proven right
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:15.280]  correct well i don't want to be right i just want to protect the republic i want to make
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:18.960]  sure i know you can't talk about a lot of secret stuff i have a lot of sources too but i mean give
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:23.840]  us the feeling of how you knew three years ago that snowden was actually doing this with a patriot
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:30.640]  group and where this is going because when you hear a story that's concocted as follows snowden
[1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:37.120]  broke his leg in special forces then he was hired by the cia then he was fired by the cia and then
[1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:43.280]  he was a contract officer for the cia then he was a contract officer for buzelle and then he i mean
[1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:51.120]  it's so cockamamie it's so convoluted this is typical cia nonsense so when you hear a convoluted
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:57.840]  story like osama ben lond was killed when in fact he was already dead and he had a uh renal
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:13:03.520]  dialysis machine and he couldn't move and but he they killed him in pakistan in the center of the
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:09.920]  most secure area in pakistan that was absurd and so people like mac raven the seal teams and all the
[1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:16.320]  special forces general demsey they were all compromised by a stupid narrative which couldn't
[1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:22.640]  be corrected and that's why the cia has had a real problem i said stupidity arrogance and
[1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:28.560]  incompetence has been the triad of the cia for years whereas in military intelligence if you
[1:13:28.560 --> 1:13:33.920]  come up with that kind of nonsensical story you would have been fired in court marshal and you saw
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:39.040]  that with manning and you saw that with others so from our perspective the more convoluted the
[1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:46.480]  story the more nonsensical it is obama was the candidate who was the most lethal of all everybody
[1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:52.560]  thought he was sweet intelligent and didn't do very much you saw how lethal he was to the entire
[1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:59.200]  country and i said it from the beginning when you have a black individual mulatto whose mother
[1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:05.040]  was in the cia whose grandfather and grandmother went to cia and they worked for the east west
[1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:11.760]  center under what i control then you know you have a cia operative who really doesn't know strategy
[1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:17.840]  and instead functions on tactics on lies and so to simplify it we have patriots from all the
[1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:23.760]  agencies but mainly the army and the military saying no the cia and the globalists because
[1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:30.240]  we're trained when we go into the military we're trained to pledge allegiance to one thing the
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:34.960]  republic we're trained to pledge allegiance to the constitution and the republic cia is full of
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:41.200]  a bunch of leftists now since the 70s well the cia was full of yet leftists universalists
[1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:48.400]  lesbians gays transgender they don't care their only interest is to increase their capabilities
[1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:54.400]  and to violate the laws of the constitutional power grab it's more than a power grab it's a
[1:14:54.400 --> 1:15:01.440]  stupid self-destructive entity which came out of a brilliant uh group of individuals who are white
[1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:06.800]  anglo-saxon protestants they came from the elite schools they knew exactly what they were doing
[1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:11.760]  they had served in world war two and then in return what we had was catholics in action who
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:16.560]  were not the brightest in the world who were totally incompetent who never really fought in
[1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:22.240]  wars who really never understood the strategy and tactics of where they the republic had to go
[1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:30.400]  and instead created problems as general eisenhower said the cia has left the legacy of ashes and this
[1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:37.040]  is the destruction now you see the punishment that's coming back again and again and again that's my
[1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:40.000]  next question then we're going to snider and then pop in i'ma skip the breaks we have more time this
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:45.120]  is such an epic time to be alive uh that's what i've been told by my sources not just you is that
[1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:50.800]  if they keep pushing exponential each data dump will become more devastating this dwarfs anything
[1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:56.400]  we've seen so far by them by a power of one or two the next thing is going to be even more
[1:15:56.400 --> 1:16:02.400]  devastating can the globalists and other groups give up because they seem so desperate i think
[1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:05.760]  they know they're in deep trouble don't they understand that they just give up they can go
[1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:09.280]  into abstention are going to be left alone but if they keep pushing they're going to be totally
[1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:14.960]  destroyed they they understand what you're saying but that's not the reality of what's
[1:16:14.960 --> 1:16:19.920]  happening your guests can reaffirm this number one i predicted years ago europe would break up
[1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:24.560]  the simple reason wasn't that you were on six years ago about de-evolution how it was all
[1:16:24.560 --> 1:16:29.040]  going to happen how we get a nationalist president go back to the south be the new king base
[1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:35.280]  oh everything and all happened yes the reason i could say that there was structural inconsistencies
[1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:42.000]  in the EU when you have a very weak incompetent country like france trying to block that rise
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:47.280]  of germany which by national character will always be the most powerful country in europe
[1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:51.120]  you know then it's a self-destructive move because they're not even doing it for the EU
[1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:55.120]  they're all fighting with each other in a power grab well not only that there's going to be a
[1:16:55.120 --> 1:17:00.080]  disillusion there's going to be currency changes as your as your guests will say you know britain
[1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:05.280]  is pulling out but they have the pound which you know how much trouble is george w bushes
[1:17:05.280 --> 1:17:09.760]  or georgia herbert walker bushes or john d rockefeller the third or whatever how much
[1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:15.120]  troubles their new world order in their new world order does not exist anymore for as a matter of
[1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:21.040]  fact that's already gone they just haven't figured out well the rockefeller children who might know
[1:17:21.040 --> 1:17:25.600]  the great great great children they couldn't care less they're really not involved in money
[1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:30.960]  most of soros is really irrelevant all of the people that we're talking about are irrelevant
[1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:37.040]  the people who are relevant are merkel from germany the pan a woman from france abbey from
[1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:44.240]  japan and president gg pong from china who knows that he is an economic problem he knows that very
[1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:50.480]  soon if he does not act appropriately we can make certain that china will have a very severe
[1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:55.040]  economic we can i mean that i mean from what i've been read i mean in a month couldn't we put
[1:17:55.680 --> 1:18:02.960]  china into a depression well china actually you know you're hitting right on the head i didn't
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:09.600]  want to say but china is technically technically insolvent most of their company's right now a
[1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:13.920]  bankrupt and that's why they're trying to throw their weight around is just bravado it's it's also
[1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:19.440]  bravado it's a distraction from the the major concern that president let's come back to that
[1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:23.040]  let's come back to that stay there dr steve pacenic steve pacenic dot com let's bring in michael
[1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:27.440]  schneider the economic collapse blog millions of readers a day and tributes info wars dot com
[1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:31.920]  you're hearing all this what a historic time to see trump striking back are they smart enough to
[1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:37.920]  back off now or will they have to release the next data dump well alex i believe the globalists
[1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:41.360]  are not going to give up in fact they know they're in a life or death struggle and that's what we
[1:18:41.360 --> 1:18:44.960]  need to understand because a lot of people out there they thought well trump got elected now we
[1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:50.160]  have a good government no we still have a bad government and just donald trump has taken the
[1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:54.560]  most important position in the government but now the deep state is rebelling against this foreign
[1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:59.360]  entity which has invaded their domain and they want to get rid of him you know in the past when
[1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:04.320]  republicans lost an election they said well we'll try again in four years for the deep state for
[1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:08.720]  the demonstrators coming back into our government and they're and the and the globalists are pissed
[1:19:09.680 --> 1:19:13.600]  yeah they're freaking out and so they have no intention of waiting four years
[1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:19.680]  to get rid of trump they plan to do it immediately the daily mail said hey obama his sole goal is
[1:19:19.680 --> 1:19:24.080]  to remove donald trump from office not four years from now but as quickly as possible and that's
[1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:27.840]  what the deep state is trying to do and that's called a coup i mean i'm not a guy that calls for
[1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:31.920]  violence but at some point pacenic used to call for uprisings five years ago i say don't do that
[1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:36.080]  we're doing info war but if we have a president he has good approval he's doing good things
[1:19:36.080 --> 1:19:40.560]  they're lying about him trying to kill him at some point not a pacenic just briefly at some
[1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:44.560]  point when do we i mean obviously we're winning the info war now but they keep calling for violence
[1:19:44.560 --> 1:19:50.480]  is there any teeth in that no the reason we don't need violence at this particular point in time
[1:19:50.480 --> 1:19:55.520]  is because we are exceedingly good we in the military and the civilian intelligence community
[1:19:55.520 --> 1:20:01.040]  were very good at psychological warfare which is what you saw coup counter coup and once again
[1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:04.640]  this block seven the dump sure back to michael real quick as i interrupt you go ahead michael
[1:20:06.080 --> 1:20:10.720]  oh everything you guys are saying is true we've got this struggle within the government
[1:20:10.720 --> 1:20:14.160]  and donald trump you know he got elected and he went to work right away trying to do the things
[1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:19.200]  he was elected to do but he needs to realize that the trump is not going to last long unless he wins
[1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:23.840]  this battle against the deep state because the deep state they have the initiative right now
[1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:28.640]  they're just going to keep lobbing grenades and scandals at trump i agree but isn't this a giant
[1:20:28.640 --> 1:20:34.880]  counter strike with this with this vault seven yeah and i'm so thankful for that because now
[1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:39.600]  we're getting a little light on the cia and nsa because up till now they've had the initiative
[1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:43.920]  because no light was being shed on them so they could just anonymously do their work and lobbing
[1:20:43.920 --> 1:20:47.440]  sure but i mean trump is the president now has stuff that will completely destroy them if he wants
[1:20:47.440 --> 1:20:54.000]  i mean i just i just it's crazy yeah the problem is there's there's just not one or two individuals
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:58.160]  you're talking about thousands of individuals spread throughout the government the deep state
[1:20:58.160 --> 1:21:02.960]  that need to be rooted out so donald and you know unfortunately he just can't go in and shut down
[1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:09.200]  the nsa or the cia you know without the help of congress and so you know there needs to be mass
[1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:13.920]  firings there need he needs a clean house because until he gets rid of these people he's going to
[1:21:13.920 --> 1:21:18.080]  be dealing with it the entire time he's in the white house and eventually they're going to find
[1:21:18.080 --> 1:21:22.880]  something on him that's going to stick so donald trump needs to make this his top priority and
[1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:28.160]  i'm so thankful that he's upset that they were wiretapping him that they're listening to his calls
[1:21:28.160 --> 1:21:32.640]  because finally now something may be done about all this unconstitutional surveillance i agree
[1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:36.320]  because that's one thing trump was wrong on was going along with surveillance and i said wait till
[1:21:36.320 --> 1:21:40.160]  he realizes they've been surveilling him like three months ago it was like biblical because
[1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:44.960]  now trump's all pissed realizing he's thinking we use this against like al qaeda or russia or
[1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:50.000]  china no the real powers here domestically by criminal groups it's got to be curtailed about
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:57.760]  dr pacenic the key here let me go at it's not that he's going to weed out everybody i i i appreciate
[1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:03.440]  what the gentleman said the reality is what's happening is the christian majority of this
[1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:11.120]  country is moving forward it is consumed the notion of patriotism within trump's administration we
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:18.160]  were already prepared through general madis general kelly mcnist and mcmaster flinn and other
[1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:23.920]  generals we knew exactly what to expect the issue at hand is no longer that you want to eliminate
[1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:29.520]  your enemy you want to expose them as vault seven is doing you want to prosecute then go through a
[1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:35.120]  due process a fully discredit the ideology not make a martyrs correct not only the ideology but
[1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:40.720]  you want to be prepared you want to impugn the integrity of the legislatures who were looking
[1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:48.000]  over this particularly diane diane feinstein particularly widen particularly all the republicans
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:54.480]  mccain and lindsey graham and schumer all of those who were involved in overseeing the intelligence
[1:22:54.480 --> 1:23:01.040]  this is far more important to us than eliminating anyone but that's gone there will be no violence
[1:23:01.040 --> 1:23:06.720]  the other issue at hand and this is what michael can address is that uh trump has brought in
[1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:14.240]  mnuchin as i said before mnuchin's job is to realign the currencies of united states which is at
[1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:20.960]  two great a height right now with the other currencies of the world so that we can export
[1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:26.320]  at a favorable rate for ourselves they'll turn our economy on like nothing else well he's going to
[1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:31.520]  turn it on but at the same time he has to work with international currencies in order for us not
[1:23:31.520 --> 1:23:37.520]  to be the supreme currency which it is we have to lower our rates so that we can compete with the
[1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:43.120]  french the japanese the mexicans what we're doing now instead of going into multilateral
[1:23:43.120 --> 1:23:49.120]  relationships we're going to buy lateral so mexico has a favorable outlook now because
[1:23:49.120 --> 1:23:54.800]  wilber ross the head of commerce who understands restructuring said look we're going to give mexico
[1:23:54.800 --> 1:23:59.360]  a very favorable rate on the pesos but we're going to do business with them let's be clear
[1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:03.600]  and then the media spends it that trump hates mexicans when he's actually trying to lift everybody
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:10.480]  up no he doesn't hate anybody all he wants to do is do business and it's apolitical in that way
[1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:15.200]  he's going to do business with canada we've realigned our currencies according to the canadian
[1:24:15.200 --> 1:24:19.600]  dollar we're going to do business with england we're going to realign our currency i was reading
[1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:23.920]  all that the media spends it mexico ought to literally be kissing his butt right now he's
[1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:31.520]  actually trying to like equalize the media doesn't understand any of this alan you're way beyond
[1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:37.360]  what's happening here don't the alternative media has gone way beyond anything in the media
[1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:40.640]  you can't expect i'm not bragging but let's say this what's it like for shiner and then you
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:45.680]  dr pacinic everything you cover michael everything pacinic covers what drudge covers the world that
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:51.360]  daily covers now suddenly you watch fox and cnn they're they're being forced to use the terms
[1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:54.800]  senator rand paul just called wants to come on and that's no big deal he calls sometimes
[1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:59.280]  but it's like they're starting to realize we've been dead on this is an amazing moment go ahead michael
[1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:04.480]  oh it's very true and you hear terms like globalists in the mainstream media versus
[1:25:04.480 --> 1:25:09.040]  nationalists which is they what they call people like us that don't want the globalist system
[1:25:09.040 --> 1:25:12.720]  and so that's become to the forefront all these things are coming to the forefront which is a
[1:25:12.720 --> 1:25:18.400]  wonderful thing but but trump is at a very dangerous time because there's this deep state war
[1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:22.640]  within the government but then outside the government people you know there's not going to
[1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:28.560]  be any violence on the right as as your guest mentioned but on the left they're becoming
[1:25:28.560 --> 1:25:33.520]  violent there's calls for violent in fact former attorney general loretta lynch just made a video
[1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:37.200]  i don't know if you guys have seen it where she said hey there were blood in the streets in the
[1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:42.960]  past and we're gonna have to do it again people are gonna have to die this this woman was just
[1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:46.880]  very recently the attorney general of the united states oh i know they and by the way they're the
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:50.960]  news saying i'm calling for violence i'm not i'm saying they well they're trying to get violent
[1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:55.040]  they're tasering people they're beating them just this week in all over the country beating up women
[1:25:55.040 --> 1:25:59.600]  i'm saying how long do we put up with their crap but i get it i think we're winning by letting them
[1:25:59.600 --> 1:26:05.520]  like gondy did or martin Luther king beat us up and show they're the scum well basically what's yeah
[1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:11.840]  i agree with michael but what's really happening is university of vermont which is a liberal school
[1:26:11.840 --> 1:26:17.360]  but nevertheless they don't want to admit that they provide language studies for the cia in
[1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:22.560]  other words they better get their act together before we stop funding university of vermont
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:28.000]  and their nonsensical behavior because they know they receive an incredible amount of dollars as
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:33.920]  there's a university of berkeley what's happening is you're getting the exposure points of the left
[1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:39.920]  but it's 60 years too late in other words these kids who are not studying they're not doing anything
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:45.680]  have never served will never serve our government are going out and protesting is this the equivalent
[1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:51.920]  of the protest in the 1960s with abby hoffman where people were killed no is this in fact just an
[1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:58.080]  eruption of a bunch of entitled little babies and the left wing and all yes what we have to be serious
[1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:06.560]  about is to address it diane feinstein get her out nancy pelosi out mark rubio out uh uh all of
[1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:12.480]  these people susan collin out we don't need violence to this we are way beyond that now
[1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:17.840]  the left is lost they have no idea what to do they're trying to mimic what you did what i do
[1:27:17.840 --> 1:27:23.120]  what others have done and it's lost they're calling themselves the resistance for the entire dirty
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:28.160]  power structure is is is trying to prop them up and it's it's it's crazy in fact they've got these
[1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:33.360]  new white papers out saying jones hijack the liberal movement that was against the wto no
[1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:38.080]  no just because i'm a patriot or more right wing which i'm even right wing i'm a patriot it doesn't
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:42.880]  mean that i don't want national sovereignty it's the left pushing for globalism and corporate
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:46.800]  control outside of free market they're the tyrants i mean what's going to happen dr
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:52.560]  pritchett is a psychiatrist or just a citizen studying this when the leftist crybabies i mean
[1:27:52.560 --> 1:27:57.760]  they're literally crybabies finally find out they that they were part of the establishment well not
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:03.200]  only are they part of the establishment they are the nurtured little orphans of the establishment
[1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:10.080]  but that they're finished the real issue is even the corporations we thought that they could get
[1:28:10.080 --> 1:28:16.000]  away from a trump made a very big mistake for example caterpillar a major american company
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:21.520]  did an inversion what we call a financial inversion in switzerland and refused to pay
[1:28:21.520 --> 1:28:28.080]  billions of dollars in taxes trump picked it up the guy our administration picked it up very quickly
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:34.960]  and then the irs came in on caterpillar to say guys you've had falsified accounting now you will
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:40.480]  play billions of dollars and you will come into criminal action that's what's happening at a much
[1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:46.400]  greater level but left doesn't understand that not even the right but when caterpillar tries to avoid
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:54.560]  paying taxes by doing a stupid inversion into switzerland which is a haven for corrupt money
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:28:58.880]  then you know you've got cooperation simple trump rule is this we're open for business we have low
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:03.200]  taxes low regulations you're not going to just suck off the country and get laws passed that
[1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:07.440]  screw us when you're going to end up hurting the population we're going to have give and take two
[1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:15.360]  way streets that's correct and but that reasonableness is not really understood by the left at point
[1:29:15.360 --> 1:29:20.880]  the corporations are still trying like little babies to get away and they're trying to act out
[1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:24.960]  when a trump to get i mean to get a hundred percent profit even though it burns down the world
[1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:31.120]  well the point is they they've gotten away literally not with murder but in some cases
[1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:36.960]  with murder but this time around when we brought in all the goman sax boys all the economic experts
[1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:40.320]  they find i'm gonna let you have two minutes to finish up the other side where this is going
[1:29:40.320 --> 1:29:44.000]  then i'm gonna give snotter about five minutes we'll be cutting his time today and then aran paul
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:48.080]  senator wants to come on with some big news he's going to be joining us and we've got uh
[1:29:48.080 --> 1:29:54.560]  other folks come on breaking news we'll be back on the march the empires on the run alex jones and
[1:29:54.560 --> 1:30:04.320]  the gcn radio network the story is up on info wars dot com aggregated by the daily caller new
[1:30:04.320 --> 1:30:11.120]  york times columnist encourages irs agents to commit felony by leaking trumps tax returns
[1:30:11.120 --> 1:30:17.680]  to his newspaper he tweets if you're in the irs and have a certain president's tax return that
[1:30:17.680 --> 1:30:23.920]  you'd like to leak my address is and he lists the address of the new york times this is nicholas
[1:30:23.920 --> 1:30:31.360]  christoph tweeting a liberal who writes about global affairs was responding to a tweet by vox.com
[1:30:31.360 --> 1:30:37.680]  editor matt iglesias who marveled that the irs rarely leaks tax information one reason for that
[1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:43.440]  is because doing so constitutes a felony folks the unauthorized release of an individual's
[1:30:43.440 --> 1:30:49.920]  tax returns is punishable by a fine of five thousand dollars and up to five years in prison
[1:30:49.920 --> 1:30:55.920]  leakers would also likely face a series of professional sanctions this is ashley beckford

[1:32:54.400 --> 1:33:02.960]  that's info wars life dot com and vitamin mineral fusion take action now before we sell out crashing
[1:33:02.960 --> 1:33:10.320]  through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[1:33:10.320 --> 1:33:28.080]  like steven benn says all the outside loveless constructs will be burned down
[1:33:29.920 --> 1:33:33.760]  this is a real revolution against tyranny you're seeing 21st century war
[1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:38.640]  dr. cp cheney's gonna finish up steve cheney dot com former spy chief hooked into everything
[1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:42.160]  everything he's talked about really come true he's been one of the most accurate guess we've had in
[1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:48.080]  decades 22 years now on air it's been 22 years as of april i forgot to announce that on air i keep
[1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:53.440]  saying 21 years i get older and older here 43 years old now but on air since i was 21 then of
[1:33:53.440 --> 1:33:57.040]  course we have michael snider uh great to brain all this i'm gonna give him about five minutes
[1:33:57.040 --> 1:34:02.640]  in a moment to finish up uh his comments but the media is not going to tell you though they're
[1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:08.240]  starting to how big a deal this latest data dump is just exposing the cia the deep state how it's
[1:34:08.240 --> 1:34:13.520]  been used to blackmail congress try to set up trump it's all coming out and yes this is the
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:18.640]  counter strike i don't even know the president knew about this but he was told you're being wired
[1:34:18.640 --> 1:34:25.280]  tapped by the agencies he knew it was accurate and so now this is just backing it all up uh and
[1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:28.560]  there's even more i'm told so about him should let me ask you this other points you want to make
[1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:33.760]  but then how does the establishment that's left because they're so damn delusional and arrogant
[1:34:33.760 --> 1:34:40.080]  how do they counter strike or is the delusion i see is the bravada and the hubris fake is all this
[1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:46.720]  puts the fake or or or is it real and how do you as a guy that predicted this six seven years ago
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:51.360]  in the air how does all this layout how do you see the the breaks happening
[1:34:53.840 --> 1:35:00.240]  happen uh this is the third coup and counter coup that you know i we haven't been involved with i
[1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:06.800]  told you weeks ago we would do this we would do it again basically what's happening is the deep
[1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:13.360]  state or as you call it the cia and others will be cleaned out Pompeo's job is to clean them out
[1:35:13.360 --> 1:35:19.120]  Mattis's job is to clean it out we will clean out the 16 different intelligence organizations
[1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:25.680]  but what we need and we're fortunate to have dr rand paul i i have to thank dr rand paul and his
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:32.480]  father ron paul for having stood up against the neocons who tried to come back into the administration
[1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:37.840]  particularly the worst and the scum of them all elliott abron's and john bolton if it wasn't
[1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:46.000]  for dr rand paul we would still have a huge influx of neocons but he stood up he wrote an
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:52.960]  incredible accurate letter and he defied and he led the fight exposing how obama and the neocons
[1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:58.720]  were backing al qaeda in syria he was the leader of that i mean he's really done a great job well
[1:35:58.720 --> 1:36:04.480]  yes and and i think the audience should really appreciate what dr rand paul has done is a singleton
[1:36:04.480 --> 1:36:10.640]  literally working alone and and really going up against paul ryan going up against the whatever
[1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:16.960]  week need republicans and he stood for what we wanted which was the revolution peaceful at the
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:24.000]  same time making sure we clean out every piece of a flotsam and jetsam that the obama the bush
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:30.400]  administration had so he becomes important other congressmen and senators will become important
[1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:35.200]  but again i'm very proud that he's a physician he's a great ophthalmologist and he's a great
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:40.240]  american i want to thank you your audience oh please yeah for having been the only thank you
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:44.000]  and everybody's awake here but i mean it's a big time how do they counter strike then i mean
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:51.280]  this is a football game or a war how we doing we basically want it i'm gonna say you know when we
[1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:56.480]  are the victors let us be a little bit gracious and back off and and continue to do what we do
[1:36:56.480 --> 1:37:02.320]  quietly we don't have to gloat we don't have to say anything they will act out like children
[1:37:02.320 --> 1:37:07.040]  in a pamper in fact doctor i almost this morning i'm going to come on here and say we have won it
[1:37:07.040 --> 1:37:10.880]  may take him a while to figure it out but this i can feel it there's still a lot of fights to come
[1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:14.160]  they can still try to kill the president but even though they do that it turns them into a martyr
[1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:18.560]  i've looked down every avenue they've got i don't see any way they can reconstitute themselves
[1:37:19.200 --> 1:37:26.240]  they're finished when you have 79 year old polosi 82 year diane feinstein you're already
[1:37:26.240 --> 1:37:31.920]  in the cemetery the left is in the cemetery all we've done is to put flowers on their graves
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:36.480]  and walk away you need not say anything else have you seen the footage where they don't they think
[1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:42.320]  russia attacked korea they don't say no they think that bush is still in office and that's the kind
[1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:47.440]  of stupidity you'll have when you have affirmative action we had a president on affirmative action
[1:37:47.440 --> 1:37:53.920]  obama he was a disaster we cleaned out his record in seven days that's it no more affirmative action
[1:37:53.920 --> 1:38:00.400]  what we need is our entrepreneurial skills and may the best win and that's what america's about
[1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:05.440]  thank you very much and thank your audience and thank dr rand paul all right thank you so much dr
[1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:09.840]  pacenic my pleasure there you go uh i don't think they're gonna give up though i think it's gonna
[1:38:09.840 --> 1:38:15.280]  have to really be bad i think they're gonna have to bring all the pedophile stuff out and uh i know
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:20.880]  trump wants to measure all this coming out but uh i just don't think they understand what they're
[1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:24.400]  up against because everything we've talked about warned about coming through all right michael
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:28.880]  steiner economic collapse blog dot com great brain thanks for sharing your time with us today
[1:38:28.880 --> 1:38:33.280]  to take five minutes you've got the floor to relay what your biggest concerns are see if you
[1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:40.000]  concur with pacenic yeah alex what we have just witnessed is a critical moment in american history
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:46.320]  when donald trump learned that the government had been listening to his conversations wiretapping him
[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:50.960]  and he got extremely upset about it that was an extremely good thing because now what donald
[1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:54.960]  trump can do is he can start asking questions and if he starts asking questions what he's
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:39:00.800]  gonna find out is is that the nsa is tapping directly into the central servers of every
[1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:05.440]  major technology company i'm talking about google i'm talking about facebook apple etc etc it's all
[1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:11.280]  declassified it's all declassified we it's all been documented we it's also been documented
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:18.800]  that the nsa has secret electronic monitoring rooms in every us telecom company where they tap
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:25.840]  directly into eight years ago out of uh san francisco at 18 and t yeah but that was just one
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:30.240]  example is about you know at one point it was 20 around the nation is probably much more than that
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:35.440]  now but all that information from the telecom companies from the internet is fed back to a
[1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:42.160]  giant data center out in utah they they built it just be clear it's so huge it parallels the size of
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:47.680]  the regular telecom that's how big it is because everything's passed through yeah it's got a million
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:54.880]  square feet of storage space there it costs two billion dollars to build it takes 40 million dollars
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:40:01.120]  a year just for the energy bill to keep that place running and it can store five you tell the bytes of
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:06.720]  information now what's a zeta bite at one zeta bite of information that that amount of storage space
[1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:12.720]  would require a stack of iPhones from here to the moon so when you're talking about five zeta
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:17.200]  bites of information you're talking about amount of information that's absolutely incomprehensible
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:22.000]  so what's stored there basically people have to assume that all of their phone calls everything
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:26.960]  that they do on the internet all the embarrassing selfies that they take whatever they get whatever
[1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:32.160]  goes through the pipes the government grabs and then they keep and they store away now they don't
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:36.320]  have enough people to sit there and listen to them all what they do they grab it they store it then
[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:41.200]  if they need it they call it up so if they're targeting a specific organization let's not forget
[1:40:41.200 --> 1:40:47.120]  they can plant things on it that's in the wiki leaks and the newest vault seven is they were in
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:51.600]  there trying to frame trump that's what they've been caught in is with fake servers trying to
[1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:58.800]  say it was him yeah and also in this new data dump it's come out that they can spoof attacks from
[1:40:58.800 --> 1:41:03.600]  other nations like they can do a false flag cyber attack make it look like the russians did it
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:07.440]  that's what i kept saying they claim this stuff's coming from russia because you have russian malware
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:13.600]  i can get that and do that yeah absolutely and so and in this new revelation we learned that the
[1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:19.600]  ci can use it can tap into just about any device even use samsung televisions and use them as a
[1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:24.160]  microphone so you're sitting in there in your home and you're just watching television and the
[1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:28.720]  government can literally be listening to your conversations and so and the same thing is true
[1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:34.480]  with cell phones where it's been documented that the nsa the cia they have the capability of listening
[1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:39.040]  to you through your cell phone even if you think it's turned off they can spoof it where it's still
[1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:43.680]  actually on they can use it as a microphone to listen to your conversation which we told people
[1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:48.320]  20 years ago now it's all over so what happens is all this comes out what happens to our credibility
[1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:52.880]  well our credibility goes way up because we've been warning about this forever we've been writing
[1:41:52.880 --> 1:41:56.320]  about i've been writing about these things for years you've been warning about these things for
[1:41:56.320 --> 1:42:00.480]  well over a decade and so people are saying hey they were actually right about these things but
[1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:05.680]  donald this is why donald trump and his team need to be so so very careful because literally wherever
[1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:10.160]  they go whatever they're doing the spooks could be listening whether it's through a cell phone
[1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:14.720]  whether it's through a television any electronic device and you know how are we gonna get away
[1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:19.440]  from all electronic devices some people listen i mean just to the point of privacy you know i'm
[1:42:19.440 --> 1:42:23.680]  gonna have time with my wife i go put the phone in the other room just because i mean i know they
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:27.840]  do it i've been there before when the damn thing turns on people are typing on my phone calling
[1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:31.440]  people and stuff i mean i don't ever talk about that on air but i've experienced it a decade ago
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:38.240]  where your phone boots up people are typing they're calling people yeah even cb of former cbs reporter
[1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:43.120]  sharyl akison her computers would come on in the middle of the night and the government would hack
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:48.240]  into them and and she got computer experts to come in and they actually planted classified documents
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:53.040]  on her computers so they have something to frame her try the same thing with drake and others but
[1:42:53.040 --> 1:42:58.320]  he got warned by people inside the agency saying they're doing this so that's the good news is
[1:42:58.320 --> 1:43:02.960]  there's people inside these boardrooms like let's shut up william benning and thomas trink
[1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:06.640]  let's go plant something on their computer put them in prison people like and they they literally
[1:43:06.640 --> 1:43:11.600]  put it in their mailbox and warn them hey they're coming with a swat team i mean oxys man evil
[1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:17.440]  man yeah and so this is so critical because now trump is in a position to do something about it
[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:21.440]  for so long we've known about this we've been screaming about this but nothing has been done
[1:43:21.440 --> 1:43:25.600]  but now trump i don't say this to be addictive but this is uh some of these people need to get
[1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:30.000]  tried they need to be put in prison some of this is punishable by death i mean we need some public
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:34.800]  hangings i don't say that meanly i don't want to kill anybody i want due process but i mean people
[1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:40.000]  need to get hung over this so folks are scared to do this again yeah and it's not just about
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:44.880]  going after the individuals but it's about taking away one of the most powerful weapons of the new
[1:43:44.880 --> 1:43:50.160]  world order and it's this surveillance it's this monitoring people it's this information gathering
[1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:55.920]  if you take that completely away from them then they're greatly disarmed so the key thing is to
[1:43:55.920 --> 1:44:00.480]  end the surveillance now trump goes through this yeah it's a foreign power a person of interest
[1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:05.040]  spy the hell out of them but here's another thing build all these kill switches into everything
[1:44:05.040 --> 1:44:10.240]  where they can take over planes all hackers can do it now they've left everybody wide open all these
[1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:14.320]  other governments power plants reactors because they built this and of course they've caught the
[1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:20.080]  chinese who make most our chips they're putting them in ours i mean this is freaking nuts man
[1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:24.480]  and then the nsa doesn't want to talk about it because oh they'll know about our back doors
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:29.520]  if we know about the chinese back doors how about death penalty for putting back doors and people's
[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:36.080]  stuff yeah and people don't understand what's going on out there you know when and when we hear
[1:44:36.080 --> 1:44:40.320]  about someone dying in a car crash well did they die in a car crash or did the government cause it
[1:44:40.320 --> 1:44:45.680]  to happen when a plane crashes well you know and and and donald trump's plane almost crashed
[1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:50.320]  you know a couple times there the hell driver just died like 20 something top russians just died
[1:44:50.960 --> 1:44:55.920]  oh it's yeah and and so this is the kind of stuff that our government is doing our government has
[1:44:55.920 --> 1:45:00.640]  behaved very very badly so donald trump needs to put an end to that he can't just get upset but
[1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:05.280]  action needs to be taken we need to stop the surveillance we need to stop the assassinations
[1:45:05.280 --> 1:45:09.680]  we need to stop let me ask you this what do you think's gonna happen when the establishment
[1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:13.520]  doesn't back off and keeps going because i was told a long time ago they get ready for this
[1:45:13.520 --> 1:45:17.200]  that they're gonna bring down the real data next they're gonna arrest the whole pedophile ring
[1:45:17.200 --> 1:45:20.640]  they've already rolled up the procurers i mean they're ready people say well go ahead and do it
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:26.480]  it'll hurt the country so bad we kind of i mean i they need to be arrested but my god this is crazy
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:31.680]  what do you think yeah well what we're seeing is an escalation on both sides and eventually it could
[1:45:31.680 --> 1:45:37.040]  go nuclear on both sides and i think they'll try to nuke trump they're scum they think they're invincible
[1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:42.240]  trash always thinks it's invincible yeah and so they they they're they're gonna go to whatever level
[1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:46.640]  they need to do to take down trump and then now trump and his side could keep escalating things
[1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:52.080]  against the deep state which they need to do but literally we are in a civil war we're in a struggle
[1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:57.600]  for the way that's not rhetoric i keep telling people this is not rhetoric no it's not rhetoric at
[1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:02.720]  all because the the the deep state the globalist they're not going to roll over and play dead and
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:07.840]  give up they're gonna fight for for their lives because they know they're in a the biggest struggle
[1:46:07.840 --> 1:46:13.360]  they've they faced yet and and and so uh the people need to understand just because trump's
[1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:18.800]  president it's not over but it oh the game's only done and it's a game for our entire family
[1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:23.520]  here's your mic let me ask you this in closing i've got to say i've i've been ashamed of the
[1:46:23.520 --> 1:46:27.760]  stuff that happens in america i've gotten upset at some of my fellow country people but i'm really
[1:46:27.760 --> 1:46:32.480]  actually proud right now to realize what's been going on the last few decades and always have
[1:46:32.480 --> 1:46:37.520]  known this but i've personally been humble about it because i've been mission oriented but i'm telling
[1:46:37.520 --> 1:46:43.520]  this this is history this is so incredible it's happening so complex so big and we really are
[1:46:43.520 --> 1:46:48.000]  getting the upper hand we're having big victories and it just really makes me proud to be an american
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:51.760]  i've always been proud of our history i'm so proud of our country i love my fellow country people
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:55.520]  no matter what color they are where they came from people that love liberty i love them and it makes
[1:46:55.520 --> 1:47:01.680]  me so proud right now to see that the country's coming back and it makes me only want to work
[1:47:01.680 --> 1:47:08.880]  harder to make sure we succeed against these people yeah it the second american civil war
[1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:14.320]  has already started now it's not involving shooting or or yet or that much violence although we've
[1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:17.680]  seen the riots and protests and they're going to i believe they're going to get a lot worse
[1:47:17.680 --> 1:47:22.640]  but it's a struggle between two ideologies the ideology of the globalist and the ideology of
[1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:27.280]  freedom and liberty and the values of our founding fathers and one of those ideologies is eventually
[1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:32.960]  going to win and vanquish the others and up until now the globalist they've had control of the
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:38.960]  entertainment system the the news the education system the political system most of our politicians
[1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:44.000]  but now with trump we're seeing an uprising now the battle's not one it could go either way or
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:48.400]  there's a third alternative where we destroy each other and bring the nation down in the process
[1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:53.840]  so that it's that's better than the globalist all anti-family pro-death people that'd be better
[1:47:53.840 --> 1:47:58.720]  than the country we bring down and then we run because them in control is humanity being brought
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:04.640]  down that's more important than the country oh it's true and so people need to realize
[1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:09.520]  this civil war is going to take time to play out and it's not clear which side is going to
[1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:14.800]  ultimately reign and that's why the maximum effort now of every man woman and child is critical
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:20.320]  at maximum effort more than ever before and now donald trump has given us a beach head
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:25.520]  a foothold in the political realm to start making major changes but we've got to actually make those
[1:48:25.520 --> 1:48:29.440]  changes we got to keep trump in office that's why they're trying so hard to topple him because
[1:48:29.440 --> 1:48:33.520]  they know they're in danger and so it's the struggle it's the fight of our lives and people
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:37.840]  have got a fight for america and the future of humanity is happening now folks it's really
[1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:43.200]  happening that's not hype it's beyond any hype i have this is it be involved pray be politically
[1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:49.120]  involved call and talk radio c-span support broadcast like this call congress just whatever
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:53.920]  get aggressive because the enemy media is not going to tell you what's happening michael

[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:09.040]  Zach Drucker is one of our great producers and also runs the board in there and post articles
[1:54:09.040 --> 1:54:14.080]  when you see him live on air he kind of cases behind me as I mentioned things he tries to google
[1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:20.400]  him and show that I'm not making it up and he was just reading over 7000 plus pages of vault
[1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:25.280]  seven the largest ever publication of confidential cia documents that almost now I was watching
[1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:29.840]  mainstream media Fox seeing in there in the brakes are basically not even covering I mean
[1:54:29.840 --> 1:54:34.640]  it's all the remote control cars and breaking into your phone and getting all the hacker groups
[1:54:34.640 --> 1:54:38.800]  taken over and all their exploits and putting out the malware that we always knew to break in
[1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:43.120]  everybody's phones and causing the internet outages it's just sick criminal behavior
[1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:49.120]  against the American people and others just a rogue out of control power tripping nobodies
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:53.040]  that hijacked our government and Trump and the good people in the government are exposing it
[1:54:53.040 --> 1:54:59.760]  we're exposing it it's so exciting uh so uh Zach you were uh making some of these uh Zach Drucker
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:03.280]  was making some of these points sounds like a superhero name doesn't it uh Zach tell folks
[1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:07.040]  I'll be just reading over this this is incredible I know that Mikhail Thelon's one of our great
[1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:12.160]  hacker experts he's done amazing things expose stingray you name it uh with his great work uh
[1:55:12.160 --> 1:55:17.440]  he's hooked into all the groups out there uh DC leaks you name it and he talks to him but
[1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:22.720]  I mean it's amazing and we knew big stuff was coming soon but he's just speechless right now
[1:55:22.720 --> 1:55:26.960]  this is the the holy grail the keys of the kingdom it just shows what they were doing
[1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:32.080]  and of course this comes from people inside the CIA exposing it uh wow what do you make of this
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:37.520]  well I was looking into uh the vault seven files because you know like you said there's
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:44.720]  seven thousand pages worth of documentation here uh or seven nine but yeah is a very powerful
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:51.520]  project within the CIA within their uh hacking development what they do is they acquire assets
[1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:56.160]  they try to pick up everything that they could find one thing that they did grab was the hacking
[1:55:56.160 --> 1:56:02.880]  team's dump uh hacking team was a swiss company one of the biggest um anti piracy kind of hacking
[1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:08.800]  enforcers had a whole source code dump of everything that they had exploits for hacks for things like
[1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:15.920]  that so any operating system you can think of under the sun wireless systems your home appliances
[1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:23.840]  everything full control over access and source codes to kits where they can basically create
[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:28.720]  backdoor access to any operating system on any computer platform and they're waiting in a car
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:32.720]  michael hasis is getting in his car they have an exploit system they launch it they get control
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:38.560]  the car he doesn't even know it they hit the button the acceleration 120 boom yep detonate the bomb
[1:56:38.560 --> 1:56:44.480]  I mean they've got it all yep full control over any type of computerized system if I mean this is
[1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:49.600]  and this is only one layer this is one company they took information from this is the keys to
[1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:56.480]  the trojan horse takeover system that endangers the entire planet yep yeah it's it's it's unreal
[1:56:56.480 --> 1:57:00.720]  why would you allow this to be put into everything knowing other governments individuals again even
[1:57:00.720 --> 1:57:05.680]  if you were evil you wouldn't want something like this well it's what's incredible is the fact that
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:12.240]  they have the capability of not just taking this information but re-implementing all of it into
[1:57:12.240 --> 1:57:18.000]  the whatever they like whatever whatever type of of service or program that they want there's
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:23.760]  even documents in here of devices with hacking software built into it that are already out
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:27.760]  being deployed oh yeah they get the big telecoms and big producers to put it in them and they got
[1:57:27.760 --> 1:57:34.640]  chips you can remote access everything yep yeah it's it's a it's it's a total breakaway civilization
[1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:41.120]  industrial level rewrite of the entire cultural system for surveillance and social engineering
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:47.040]  control and zuckerberg and and uh schmidt all of them have been given the keys to it that's the next
[1:57:47.040 --> 1:57:51.760]  level yep and what's important too is that these FISA courts basically enable them to have full
[1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:56.560]  access to all of these tools anytime they say anyone is a russian agent anytime they say there's
[1:57:56.560 --> 1:58:01.360]  any type of and that means a million people connected to them in a sphere yeah and it goes
[1:58:01.360 --> 1:58:07.600]  deep the the map of all the departments there's 36 departments under the the cyber there's no
[1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:12.240]  oversight you're giving a bunch of control freaks when you show the map the folks of the cia flow
[1:58:12.240 --> 1:58:17.280]  char we can pull that up i was showing that or keep going yep as you can see on the chart here
[1:58:17.280 --> 1:58:21.760]  there's the center for cyber intelligence and if you look at the breakdown of just the center
[1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:29.360]  for cyber intelligence the cci that whole branch below it is all tied to it and that's mainly
[1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:35.440]  leftist control freaks that they literally put in charge of everything yep it's 36 separate departments
[1:58:35.440 --> 1:58:39.200]  i've talked to folks there at the cia and they say when trump came in those guys were hopping around
[1:58:39.200 --> 1:58:42.800]  with hatred game out there that couldn't even control themselves thank you i mean it was just
[1:58:42.800 --> 1:58:47.520]  like i'm not saying hackers are wimps i'm saying what type of leftist they hired great point sack
[1:58:47.520 --> 1:58:52.560]  we'll be back straight ahead with senator rand paul and more there was a mighty nation blessed

[2:00:06.400 --> 2:00:17.040]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:00:17.040 --> 2:00:38.560]  all right i want to go to a john bound report right now dealing with the criminal underground
[2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:43.040]  of the u.s president the criminal undermining of the u.s president we won't get to all the report
[2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:46.480]  right now we'll get to part of it and then senator rand paul's coming up in the next segment with
[2:00:46.480 --> 2:00:51.120]  big breaking news he's doing a great job in the senate as of late especially let's go to this
[2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:57.840]  report from john bound deep state gate a criminal enterprise utilizing a barrage of
[2:00:57.840 --> 2:01:04.960]  intelligence leaks propaganda spinning politicians and an overreaching surveillance state seeking to
[2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:11.040]  undermine the newly elected populist president of the united states donald j trump brightbart reports
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:17.280]  former nsa official now whistleblower william bennie when asked whether he believes the nsa is
[2:01:17.280 --> 2:01:23.360]  tapping trump bennie replied absolutely how did they get the phone call between the president and
[2:01:23.360 --> 2:01:29.440]  the president of australia or the one that he made with mexico indeed remember when obama tapped
[2:01:29.440 --> 2:01:35.520]  the phones of brazilian president rusev and german chancellor merkel while former bush attorney general
[2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:41.360]  michael mukasey speaks from experience until congress comes out and says here's the proof that we
[2:01:41.360 --> 2:01:45.760]  now see that there was connections between the trump campaign and russians known to us intelligence
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:51.040]  if and then and only then then you would say because that would be possibly a criminal act right
[2:01:51.040 --> 2:01:56.160]  no it wouldn't even if they had regular contact talking about working together the only standard
[2:01:56.160 --> 2:02:03.920]  i know that that conceivably violates is the logan act which hasn't been prosecuted in 1793 i think
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:10.800]  the president was not correct certainly in saying that president obama ordered uh a tap on a server
[2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:17.760]  in in trump tower however i think he's right in that there was surveillance and that it was
[2:02:17.760 --> 2:02:22.400]  conducted at the behest of the justice department through the physical they tried to get apparently
[2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:26.800]  tried to get a wiretap based on their criminal investigation function in june that was turned
[2:02:26.800 --> 2:02:32.800]  down they then tried to get and got an order permitting them to conduct electronic surveillance
[2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:39.040]  in october this is october of 2016 so that's when apparently that's when that's when they get your
[2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:44.640]  basing of the sun on news reports as well and on adam schitton adam schitton of course a sycophantic
[2:02:44.640 --> 2:02:50.800]  horde of globalist representatives continue to exploit the media president obama has flatly
[2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:57.920]  denied that he has done this and either way uh chuck the president's in trouble if he
[2:02:57.920 --> 2:03:05.600]  falsely spread this kind of misinformation i don't know if any president uh democrat or republican
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:10.000]  in the past has done this it shows this president doesn't know how to conduct himself i can tell
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:16.240]  you that is just ridiculous for the president president trump to say that president obama
[2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:23.120]  would ever order uh any wire type of an american citizen any president that's just not we don't
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:28.640]  do that i can't speak officially anymore but uh i will say that for the part of the national
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:36.800]  security apparatus that i oversaw as dmi there was no such wiretap activity mounted against uh the
[2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:42.400]  president the president elect at the time or as a candidate or against his campaign if you could
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:50.480]  give me a yes or no answer to the question does the nsa collect any type of data at all on millions
[2:03:50.480 --> 2:04:01.600]  or hundreds of millions of americans no sir it does not not wittingly why is your agency about the
[2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:09.600]  law sir why can you lie to the senate about mass surveillance presuming the entire globe
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:17.760]  to be subject to pervasive collection the entire debacle hinges on whether or not the second
[2:04:17.760 --> 2:04:23.200]  fizer request was granted an investigation that was confirmed by the media back in november of
[2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:29.600]  2016 if anything president trump's reaction is long overdue this is a major priority for the
[2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:34.240]  president united states he directed his intelligence community and national security officials um to
[2:04:34.240 --> 2:04:40.800]  take this on he expects that report to be issued uh to him uh before he leaves office the question is
[2:04:40.800 --> 2:04:48.560]  how will his successor react in january of 2017 buzz feed and cnn cooked up the trump dossier fake
[2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:53.440]  news nonsense all right meanwhile obama senator rand polis said the whole russia thing is hysteria
[2:04:53.440 --> 2:04:59.360]  that's being proven accurate now as we learn more and as the new cia data vault seven is released
[2:04:59.360 --> 2:05:04.400]  we'll talk to senators right out the supreme court scraps obama's tyranny bathroom policy the supreme
[2:05:04.400 --> 2:05:10.240]  court stepped away from an obama administration policy allowing public school students to use
[2:05:10.240 --> 2:05:17.520]  whatever bathroom fits their self-described so-called quote gender identity the court rejected a
[2:05:17.520 --> 2:05:23.920]  challenge from a transgender student gavin grimm who with the help from the aclu sued a school
[2:05:23.920 --> 2:05:30.480]  board which restricted bathroom use to biological genders only the fourth circuit court of appeals
[2:05:30.480 --> 2:05:36.560]  had ruled in favor of grimm because the obama administration told schools to consider a student's
[2:05:36.560 --> 2:05:43.120]  quote gender identity when deciding bathroom policies in a quote guidance letter the administration
[2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:48.720]  issued through the department of education however the trump administration has since rescinded that
[2:05:48.720 --> 2:05:54.480]  policy stating that states rights need to be respected which lead to the supreme court blocking
[2:05:54.480 --> 2:06:01.840]  the fourth circuits ruling this is ashley beckford for info wars dot com today we call it bone broth
[2:06:01.840 --> 2:06:06.880]  and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern

[2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:25.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:08:36.080 --> 2:08:40.640]  all right senator ran poll joins us for this segment i gotta tell you i've been really proud
[2:08:40.640 --> 2:08:44.880]  of the work he's been doing trying to get a copy of obama care last week when the republicans had
[2:08:44.880 --> 2:08:49.200]  it in secret uh exposed this whole russia thing it's a bunch of red herrings he's been exposing
[2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:54.800]  the whole nsa spy grid obviously before he was even in the senate and so i think we've got the
[2:08:54.800 --> 2:08:59.440]  senator on the line well this senator are you there i am alex thanks for having me well it's
[2:08:59.440 --> 2:09:04.080]  good to have you here wow uh so much going on uh where should we start with obama care
[2:09:05.200 --> 2:09:10.080]  yeah i mean it really disturbs me that for six years we've been running to repeal obama care
[2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:16.880]  the american public elected the house majority republican in 2010 the republican senate 2014
[2:09:16.880 --> 2:09:21.760]  and then the white house in 2016 they elected us to repeal it and now what the house leadership's
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:28.480]  putting forward is simply obama care life now i saw obviously quotes for you this morning on
[2:09:28.480 --> 2:09:32.240]  fox and i agreed with it i'd like to have something you know really good so perhaps you can propose
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:36.800]  i know you have had some proposals but overall just to be able to get rid of the force mandate
[2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:40.560]  the five thousand dollar fines that would be a good thing but let's i mean let's walk through this
[2:09:41.840 --> 2:09:46.640]  well what we can do is you know about a year ago we tried to get rid of it much of it as we could
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:51.520]  so we had to vote a little bit over a year ago and every republican in the house and every republican
[2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:55.840]  in the senate except for one voted to repeal the whole thing and i think that's where we ought to
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:10:03.120]  start is there instead people are saying oh we should replace it with uh some government programs
[2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:08.960]  we should replace it with obama care light and there's agreement on repeal but we're really just
[2:10:08.960 --> 2:10:13.920]  not agreed on the replacement i have a free market replacement bill which sort of gives people more
[2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:20.480]  choices but the house leadership has put forward obama care subsidies and they call them refundable
[2:10:20.480 --> 2:10:26.320]  tax credits they've put toward obama care taxes in fact for the next year they leave all of the
[2:10:26.320 --> 2:10:32.400]  obama care taxes in place wow and they leave the cadillac tax the tax on really good insurance
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:37.680]  stays in place forever and here's the other interesting thing and not many people know this
[2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:43.360]  there is an individual mandate in their bill you don't pay the mandate to the to the government you
[2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:48.880]  don't have to pay a tax if you don't buy insurance but you pay a penalty to the insurance company
[2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:54.480]  the insurance companies have their fingers into this bill and the insurance companies also have
[2:10:54.480 --> 2:10:59.920]  bailouts built into them if someone's insurance becomes expensive if someone gets really sick
[2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:05.680]  instead of the insurance company taking the risk they're paunting the risk off on the taxpayer so
[2:11:05.680 --> 2:11:10.240]  i think there are enough votes enough conservatives in the house freedom caucus and enough conservatives
[2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:16.720]  in the senate to stop this thing and then our hope is that we'll vote on a clean repeal let's just
[2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:22.880]  repeal obama care and forget trying to start new government programs well this is obviously
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:27.040]  trump central with our audience and i love a lot of what trump's doing trying to cut taxes and get
[2:11:27.040 --> 2:11:31.440]  jobs backs but i was watching you this morning what you said i went and googled it and sure enough
[2:11:31.440 --> 2:11:35.600]  there it was that there's a mandate to the insurance company a private corporate tax i get
[2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:40.240]  it's better than obama care but you're right if you have the votes to just get rid of the damn thing
[2:11:40.240 --> 2:11:44.320]  let's get rid of it we know it was the republican establishment helped write it with mitt romney
[2:11:44.320 --> 2:11:48.960]  a decade ago when he was governor of massachusetts so senator paul again i want to just commend you
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:54.080]  as the only major republican i've seen so far to come out and point out this is not as good a deal
[2:11:54.080 --> 2:11:59.360]  uh as the republican leadership saying and trump saying hey you know a good start i like it it's a
[2:11:59.360 --> 2:12:04.320]  good negotiation point so maybe he doesn't know how bad it is maybe he needs to hear from the
[2:12:04.320 --> 2:12:09.760]  listeners and you well i talked to him yesterday he called me up and we had a great conversation
[2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:14.640]  he and i are getting along just well and just very fine and in that conversation he said he
[2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:20.160]  wanted to hear other ideas and that really i think he understands the legislative process
[2:12:20.160 --> 2:12:24.320]  and the republican party is not monolithic they're conservatives they're moderates they're a big
[2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:29.760]  government republicans and there's the establishment and he more than anybody else knows that you
[2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:34.240]  got to fight the establishment the status quo and he understands that there are a lot of people
[2:12:34.240 --> 2:12:40.640]  whispering in his ear uh from washington that have been here forever that really i guess just
[2:12:40.640 --> 2:12:44.640]  aren't intent as much on repealing the whole thing they want to replace it with another program
[2:12:45.200 --> 2:12:49.920]  but i think he's open and open to listening he asked for my ideas on this and i think he truly
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:55.120]  did want to hear uh from from some members who aren't happy with what's coming forward
[2:12:55.120 --> 2:12:59.520]  and i think you'll notice if you look at his pronouncements his wasn't taken or leave it he
[2:12:59.520 --> 2:13:04.320]  didn't say what some are saying that this is the holy grail and this is the end of the debate
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:09.760]  no he said let's start a negotiation exactly and i take him at his word on that and i told him i was
[2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:15.280]  willing to work with him to try to find a repeal in a way and but i did tell him what i've been
[2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:19.920]  telling everybody in the press and that's it i think we the only way we get this through is to
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:25.600]  separate repeal from replace i think we agree on repeal most republicans have been campaigning on
[2:13:25.600 --> 2:13:32.560]  repeal for six years but the replacement part some people want to continue obama care programs
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:38.640]  the taxes the subsidies uh the mandates they want to continue that the insurance company bailouts
[2:13:38.640 --> 2:13:43.600]  well i'm sure paul ryan is on the soros payroll he's all behind this we know that most of this
[2:13:43.600 --> 2:13:48.720]  bill is republican that's what's so shameful so i you know i've seen you break down your legislation
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:52.400]  that i think would be actually a great way to repeal it and then replace i mean let's talk
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:56.880]  about your legislation where people find it how we get your legislation out there front and center
[2:13:57.920 --> 2:14:02.000]  my replacement bill we have two different bills one is the complete repeal from a year ago and
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:06.800]  we're going to introduce that this afternoon with congressman jim jordan and then the second thing
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:10.640]  we're going to do is a replacement bill we've already done it about a month ago it's called senate
[2:14:10.640 --> 2:14:16.880]  bill 222 and in it there's something really exciting and i i've met a lot of your listeners a lot of
[2:14:16.880 --> 2:14:23.280]  them are small business owners independent minded people people who work for themselves and my bill
[2:14:23.280 --> 2:14:29.040]  allows them to join an association what does that mean i'll give you an example in kentucky 700 000
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:33.600]  people have their money in our in a credit union their members of a credit union we would let all
[2:14:33.600 --> 2:14:39.040]  700 000 of them join a health association and then that makes perfect sense let's small businesses
[2:14:39.040 --> 2:14:45.040]  pool and free association across state lines even that brings real free market same for the farm
[2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:50.160]  bureau we have 30 000 people in the farm bureau but they buy individual insurance the problem with
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:54.800]  individual insurance is your husband or your spouse gets sick it's a devastating we need to pull
[2:14:55.520 --> 2:14:59.040]  yeah the insurance companies have all the power and here's what i've been saying
[2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:04.720]  right now if i want to buy insurance i've got to go kiss the boots of the insurance company
[2:15:04.720 --> 2:15:09.200]  what i want to do is change it i want so many people in association that when i go to buy
[2:15:09.200 --> 2:15:15.600]  insurance the insurance company executive comes and bows down and says sir what can i do to provide
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:20.560]  exactly product because you have the power so i'm trying to transfer the power from the man
[2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:25.440]  which is the insurance companies to the people which is the consumer and the average ordinary
[2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:29.840]  american that needs to buy insurance we can do it through an association if you're in a large
[2:15:29.840 --> 2:15:34.960]  association you have the power to demand a good price you have the power to demand they can't
[2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:39.600]  drop you when you get sick but you do it all through the market by the leverage of the marketplace
[2:15:39.600 --> 2:15:43.120]  the fuck your dad always said common sense americana well then the minutes we have left
[2:15:43.120 --> 2:15:47.440]  with senator rand paul what's the best place your senate dot gov side of rand paul dot com
[2:15:48.240 --> 2:15:52.880]  i think rand paul dot com is the easiest one to go to and they can look at our bill we've got it
[2:15:52.880 --> 2:15:57.440]  online we haven't been trying to hide ours ours has been out for a month and later on today
[2:15:57.440 --> 2:16:02.240]  we'll have up the complete repeal so we're gonna have two bills complete repeal and replace but
[2:16:02.240 --> 2:16:06.480]  as separate bills well i'm firmly behind what you're doing and i'm glad the president's just
[2:16:06.480 --> 2:16:11.120]  saying it's an opening a debate in salvo the man in the time we have left i mean i love when you
[2:16:11.120 --> 2:16:15.360]  ran for senate obviously backed you did great job once you got in you're in the campaign stuff kind
[2:16:15.360 --> 2:16:20.080]  of all went wild but overall lately and i'm not just sentences you're on the show now you have
[2:16:20.080 --> 2:16:24.880]  been saying this on air you are really like the leading liberty light and then trump seems to be
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:28.480]  responding and listening and i see in press conferences with him and him taking your lead
[2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:33.040]  and everything so it's very exciting you know for me to see you more and more working with the
[2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:37.760]  president and and you know seeing him pretty much aligning with you more and more so i'm glad to see
[2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:42.320]  you guys are friends again well the interesting thing is is while we had our disagreements politics
[2:16:42.320 --> 2:16:47.280]  is a rough and tumble sport for adults uh we had our disagreements but the interesting thing is when
[2:16:47.280 --> 2:16:52.800]  you look at some of his ideas you can see some resemblance he loves your dad loves you he was
[2:16:52.800 --> 2:16:57.760]  he was opposed to the iraq war he thought that nation building was wasting a lot of money overseas
[2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:01.760]  and we ought to spend that money at home you know we got to rebuild our own country before we think
[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:06.880]  about you know rebuilding other countries uh he has thought regime change in the middle east has
[2:17:06.880 --> 2:17:14.000]  led to more war and less stability so really on some major issues like the iraq war nation building
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:19.840]  regime change we've been on the same page i think on the intelligence communities the fact that
[2:17:19.840 --> 2:17:25.680]  we are sort of spying on foreigners but then trapping americans in that spy game they've trapped
[2:17:25.680 --> 2:17:31.440]  the president in this they are now and here's something that most people don't know the nsa spies
[2:17:31.440 --> 2:17:36.320]  on the president all the time not only this president they spied on president obama 1500
[2:17:36.320 --> 2:17:41.840]  times in one year and what they did is they say they minimize his name so they know he's talking
[2:17:41.840 --> 2:17:46.240]  to a foreign leader they're spying on the foreign leader they record the whole phone call but here's
[2:17:46.240 --> 2:17:53.200]  the rub you're dependent on honest people in the nsa and in the intelligence apparatus to not reveal
[2:17:53.200 --> 2:17:58.800]  that conversation but we've already found out they revealed they revealed the mic uh the michael
[2:17:58.800 --> 2:18:04.400]  flim conversation which is illegal now to go to jail for well that's my next question senator while
[2:18:04.400 --> 2:18:07.840]  you've got since you're bringing this up we've got a former attorney general bush saying of course
[2:18:07.840 --> 2:18:11.760]  they taped him we have the intelligence committee had in the house saying oh yeah we looked at it
[2:18:11.760 --> 2:18:16.480]  you know there's no you know there's no traitorous stuff they did talk to him to line up phone conversations
[2:18:16.480 --> 2:18:20.560]  so they try to say oh we're spying now they say they never did it it looks like obama
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:26.000]  and then we're in big trouble now and now we have this new vault seven total dossier of how they can
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:32.400]  remote control planes cars takeover any device power plants spying on us via iphones can you
[2:18:32.400 --> 2:18:35.760]  speak to that i mean i know you're in high level intelligence committees but can you speak to that
[2:18:35.760 --> 2:18:41.440]  senator rand paul well i think the most important thing to remember is the mainstream media is
[2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:48.000]  misleading everyone they're saying oh president obama didn't have the power to do to order a wire
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  tap on uh trump that's probably not the way it worked probably the justice department ordered it
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:58.640]  but their ultimate boss is the president or was president obama but also they probably didn't order
[2:18:58.640 --> 2:19:03.840]  the tap on trump they probably ordered the tap on a foreigner who might have been making phone
[2:19:03.840 --> 2:19:08.640]  calls so if they tap a foreign ambassador that ambassador calls and the ambassadors actually
[2:19:08.640 --> 2:19:13.120]  call and talk to both campaigns the ambassadors talk to all the senators so they're playing a
[2:19:13.120 --> 2:19:19.200]  semantical game exactly basically it sounds like it happened i don't know if it happened or not but
[2:19:19.200 --> 2:19:25.120]  i think it's going to be explosive if somehow we get to see the documents that actually say that
[2:19:25.120 --> 2:19:30.640]  this was done and the thing is is they're saying oh if trump wasn't the target of it it wasn't done
[2:19:30.640 --> 2:19:35.600]  they can still listen to your phone calls anytime you talk to a foreigner if the foreigner has been
[2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:41.040]  targeted by any of our intelligence agencies they listen to the phone call but then you must trust
[2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:46.880]  them to minimize you and mask you so your your name is not revealed to the public plus it's
[2:19:46.880 --> 2:19:51.040]  illegal for them to be leaking i mean they've been leaking now they're denying it in closing then
[2:19:52.560 --> 2:19:56.560]  i mean this seems like this new vault seven i was told this was coming out a few weeks ago
[2:19:56.560 --> 2:20:00.480]  a devastating blow against the deep state that you know thinks it's bigger than congress
[2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:04.800]  bigger than the president bigger than the people it seems like this is a major strike back
[2:20:04.800 --> 2:20:08.640]  against the deep state with what they've been doing to everybody not just uh president trump
[2:20:08.640 --> 2:20:12.560]  what's your what's your take on that and what are you hearing inside uh congress in the halls
[2:20:12.560 --> 2:20:17.520]  the senate is the next shoe to drop senator rand paul i think the most important thing i'm hearing
[2:20:17.520 --> 2:20:22.560]  and that i'm worried about is that private conversations between our officials our president
[2:20:22.560 --> 2:20:28.800]  nsa are being monitored and then leaked and this is not the same as a leak like you say something
[2:20:28.800 --> 2:20:33.280]  personal about what the president or their wife is wearing in the white house that's a leak
[2:20:33.280 --> 2:20:39.680]  but if you reveal classified conversations that are being tapped by the intelligence community
[2:20:39.680 --> 2:20:45.680]  this is a a crime that should be punishable by jail and it it lets the deep state have so much
[2:20:45.680 --> 2:20:52.480]  power that every american will ultimately live in fear of their phone conversations being listened to
[2:20:52.480 --> 2:20:57.840]  and so this is very very dangerous and if there is any kind of investigation it needs to be of
[2:20:57.840 --> 2:21:03.680]  those in the intelligence community who are committing felonies by revealing secretly recorded
[2:21:03.680 --> 2:21:07.360]  conversations well exactly we always think of a russian threat or a chinese threat certainly
[2:21:07.360 --> 2:21:11.760]  those are threats but what about our own bureaucrats anybody knows with their own business your biggest
[2:21:11.760 --> 2:21:17.680]  threats a rogue employee i mean his problems inside jobs i mean this is crazy that they would go this
[2:21:17.680 --> 2:21:22.960]  far and be this arrogant uh it seems like the democrats have gone from being very arrogant
[2:21:22.960 --> 2:21:27.760]  just a week ago to running scared i'm not seeing a lot of this in msm but the number one story
[2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:32.240]  on the internet which is the real media is uh vault seven so i know you're a busy man for our
[2:21:32.240 --> 2:21:37.120]  country but i hope you can also talk talk more about that because it seems like good people in
[2:21:37.120 --> 2:21:41.360]  the intelligence agencies this didn't come from the russians obviously i'm told comes from the cia
[2:21:41.360 --> 2:21:46.240]  are leaking about their own agencies because they see these agencies sabotaging a president that's
[2:21:46.240 --> 2:21:50.480]  only trying to turn our economy back on senator rand paul anytime you want to come on thank you
[2:21:50.480 --> 2:21:54.640]  for coming on the broadcast we'll be looking for your two new bills you already had a year ago
[2:21:54.640 --> 2:21:59.600]  reintroduced today at rand paul.com we'll certainly get behind those thank you so much thanks alex
[2:21:59.600 --> 2:22:03.760]  all right there goes senator rand paul and it's good you know the media always talks about rand paul
[2:22:03.760 --> 2:22:07.360]  and oh where's rand paul on your show he doesn't like you i'm like no the last time he came on
[2:22:07.360 --> 2:22:12.000]  he called us few years ago we should i told the crew though call rand paul more he's a great guy we
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:16.800]  should have him on you know he got in that big fight with trump nasty stuff was said back and
[2:22:16.800 --> 2:22:22.640]  forth whatever i don't care that's politics rand paul cares about this country and he's smart
[2:22:22.640 --> 2:22:27.920]  i was gonna say damn smart but christian audience i just did it didn't uh him and his dad like
[2:22:29.440 --> 2:22:34.480]  they read all day long i mean i've sat there with rand paul at lunch before and he's sitting there
[2:22:34.480 --> 2:22:39.120]  going uh-huh just reading newspapers i'm like can you just talk to me for a minute i mean they
[2:22:39.120 --> 2:22:45.120]  constantly and like legislation and everything else they actually care and i'm telling you i
[2:22:45.120 --> 2:22:48.240]  remember he introduced his bill a year ago i read at dinner scanned over i haven't seen the you know
[2:22:48.240 --> 2:22:52.240]  the latest version it's the same thing it's a new day we need to get behind that and i love the
[2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:57.360]  fact that most trump says hey great bill at least it starts the repeal let's have a debate about it
[2:22:57.360 --> 2:23:03.200]  make it better and so you learn he talked to the president the president uh from our logo he knows
[2:23:03.200 --> 2:23:07.120]  you're not being surveilled there he has to leave the white house that whole damn thing's got wires
[2:23:07.120 --> 2:23:22.640]  up the wasu uh i can't believe we're in a war this big right now and what's crazy is in the last 48 hours
[2:23:22.880 --> 2:23:27.840]  now the president is commanding the intelligence agencies the patriots and the intelligence
[2:23:27.840 --> 2:23:35.360]  agencies can speak out more because the country is in such dire straits and so now things already
[2:23:35.360 --> 2:23:41.360]  new before i'd already sussed out our sources now it's like the floodgates opened up and
[2:23:41.360 --> 2:23:46.160]  there has just been this long war inside the government and we're getting the initiative
[2:23:46.160 --> 2:23:51.680]  right now but let's be clear we're not dealing with people that have weapons like they had 100
[2:23:51.680 --> 2:23:57.440]  years ago whether it's political or cyber or whatever normal people wouldn't use weapons
[2:23:57.440 --> 2:24:02.560]  like this we wouldn't create them all these backdoors all these kill switches all this stuff
[2:24:02.560 --> 2:24:09.840]  that's why i say when you read newsweek and daily beast and time magazine calling for rioting calling
[2:24:09.840 --> 2:24:14.640]  to kill trump and the washington post the new york times and the la times and just so many
[2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:20.080]  publications a week i can't keep track of it you you've all seen it it's not me calling for violence
[2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:27.360]  i'm saying listen man do not attack us anymore we're not afraid to fight god almighty i love to
[2:24:27.360 --> 2:24:37.840]  fight you keep pushing we're going to bust you up and they they never listen though i i i i i
[2:24:37.840 --> 2:24:41.840]  experienced this in my life with bullies where they get in your face and threaten you and they take
[2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:49.280]  the fact that you don't want to trouble of of of of hurting them and they think you're weak and
[2:24:49.280 --> 2:24:53.680]  they just finally push you too far or they finally take a swing at you and
[2:24:53.680 --> 2:24:57.200]  and they can never believe
[2:24:59.840 --> 2:25:01.040]  they can never believe it
[2:25:04.080 --> 2:25:05.520]  when you attack them back
[2:25:08.160 --> 2:25:14.240]  because wimps have this image of strength that isn't strength they think running around messing
[2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:18.240]  with people is powerful it's not that any self-respect they wouldn't do it
[2:25:18.240 --> 2:25:24.240]  about a dream course he's got huge news he's just on fire you notice nothing he writes it info wars
[2:25:24.240 --> 2:25:30.320]  gets picked up anywhere info wars you read it millions read it but you know we put some little
[2:25:30.320 --> 2:25:34.480]  side thing out they can attack it's emotional or whatever it's all over the news they won't touch
[2:25:34.480 --> 2:25:39.200]  anything he's doing and that's because it's all directly from the white house and none of it's
[2:25:39.200 --> 2:25:43.600]  leaked none of it's illegal none of its intelligence it's all top researchers in there that are now
[2:25:43.600 --> 2:25:48.800]  aware of what obama did almost 200 billion stolen out of fanny may freddy mag trying to bankrupt
[2:25:48.800 --> 2:25:54.080]  the housing market to hurt middle-class people admitting it all sorts of crimes i mean it's
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:26:01.920]  just the trump people are in there going my god who would do stuff like this i mean obama was
[2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:07.280]  you heard pacinic on earlier a wrecking ball to hurt this country he doesn't care if you're black
[2:26:07.280 --> 2:26:13.840]  why do you are there's this instinct and scum where they want to make people poor they want to hurt
[2:26:13.840 --> 2:26:24.240]  people as if that's dominance and the the opposite of shoveling just think honor dishonor strength
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:37.760]  weakness will anti-will there's there's a there's a sliminess that you've got to get your mind around
[2:26:37.760 --> 2:26:42.080]  and when you get your mind around it you just say to yourself we need to be separated from these people
[2:26:44.080 --> 2:26:48.240]  we do not need to be around whatever animates tucky schumer or
[2:26:48.240 --> 2:26:55.120]  or Nancy Pelosi or any of these people they are they know they shouldn't be in power they know
[2:26:55.120 --> 2:26:59.200]  they're frauds they know they're cowardly they know they're weak they know they're driven by fear
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:03.360]  so they try to control us by fear that's why they always misjudge they thought i was always saying
[2:27:03.360 --> 2:27:08.880]  all the scary stuff to scare people no no no no you tell me somebody's breaking in downstairs
[2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:12.640]  i'm going to go shoot them you call me as a neighbor and say somebody's breaking in your
[2:27:12.640 --> 2:27:17.040]  back door i'm going to go attack them i'm going to say bob why are you trying to scare me i'm
[2:27:17.040 --> 2:27:24.720]  going to say thank you bob but see you got to get in their mindset of cowards
[2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:33.440]  but i tell you there's a god in this world there's a god in this universe and these people that
[2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:40.960]  think we're here is their dormance need to come back with johnny cash you can run on for a long
[2:27:40.960 --> 2:27:45.760]  time you can hide your hand you can hide what you're doing in the dark it's your fellow man
[2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:50.080]  and just as soon as that sun comes up in the morning you're going to fail
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:56.880]  but good people are too prideful to even seek power
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:07.440]  but if we don't do it we're going to be completely overrun and ruled by a bunch of trash
[2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:16.080]  the decision has been made under eugenics and globalism and social engineering
[2:28:16.640 --> 2:28:20.240]  to end humanity as we know it to not have any advances to kill the space program
[2:28:20.800 --> 2:28:25.200]  to not deploy all the life and social technologies and to end the species as we know it
[2:28:26.960 --> 2:28:34.160]  that's a giant satanic sacrifice because they know humanity's powerful and whatever influences them
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:40.880]  whether it's genetic disorders or some intergalactic attack whatever the hell it is it's an attack
[2:28:40.880 --> 2:28:47.120]  and so there's no fear but failure there's no personal fear what your neighbors think of you
[2:28:47.120 --> 2:28:50.960]  there's no personal fear what they say about you on the news there's no personal fear of what they
[2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:58.480]  do to you physically the only fear is letting these people hurt our children and their children
[2:28:58.480 --> 2:29:03.360]  and everything we're going to be into the future all the hopes all the dreams all the love all the
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:10.560]  passion all the building all the striving all the wars all the fights are our fights just like our
[2:29:10.560 --> 2:29:17.760]  ancestors aren't us we're not dying we're not giving up the planet we're not giving up the future
[2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:25.840]  we've decided we want god's providence we want the covenant we want the future we want the destiny
[2:29:26.400 --> 2:29:30.960]  we're deciding that we want the destiny we're bowing before the creator of the universe and
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:36.560]  saying we're like dirty rags god we see you but we want this and we love you give it to us
[2:29:37.360 --> 2:29:43.360]  and the moment you open that dimensional gate god comes in against the enemy and the enemy that
[2:29:43.360 --> 2:29:49.280]  howls in fear and their zombie spirit is announced because their failure was already prepared before
[2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:56.160]  the earth we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:29:56.160 --> 2:30:05.760]  this story is up on info wars dot com aggregated by the daily caller new york times columnist
[2:30:05.760 --> 2:30:13.120]  encourages irs agents to commit felony by leaking trump's tax returns to his newspaper he tweets
[2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:20.000]  if you're in the irs and have a certain president's tax return that you'd like to leak my address is
[2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:26.080]  and he lists the address of the new york times this is nicolas christoff tweeting a liberal who
[2:30:26.080 --> 2:30:33.600]  writes about global affairs was responding to a tweet by vox.com editor matt eglacius who marveled
[2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:40.320]  that the irs rarely leaks tax information one reason for that is because doing so constitutes a felony

[2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:40.400]  community has a way to go after him well this is the intelligence agencies right now and i was
[2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:45.920]  told this weeks ago and the last week they said relax alex we're about to drop the hammer on him
[2:34:45.920 --> 2:34:50.000]  we're going to blow up the criminals at the cia that's why trump came out and said i'm being
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:55.680]  spied on knowing all this was about to come out proving him right he set them up it's so good
[2:34:55.680 --> 2:35:02.080]  to have donald trump isn't it here is the club of schumer but he's he's taking these shots as
[2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:07.840]  antagonism taunting to the intelligence you take on the intelligence community they have six ways
[2:35:07.840 --> 2:35:14.000]  from sunday at getting back at you so even for a practical supposedly hard-nosed businessman
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:18.240]  he's being really dumb to do this what do you think the intelligence community would do if they
[2:35:18.240 --> 2:35:23.680]  were i don't know but i from what stop right there let's go ahead and go to dr um coursey who's an
[2:35:23.680 --> 2:35:28.400]  expert in banking international finance obviously work with donald trump for 40 years work with the
[2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:33.200]  state department in the in classified areas of course three times number one new york times best
[2:35:33.200 --> 2:35:37.760]  seller he sent me a lot of economic data to get into today we've got a bunch of numbers on this
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:42.480]  just the scandals that he's getting tipped off from by certain sources in the executive branch
[2:35:43.120 --> 2:35:47.200]  exclusive docs obama destroyed middle-class mortgages to prop up obama care looting scheme
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:52.800]  we've got lawsuit obama rob private investors to fund obama care he's got a new article out today
[2:35:52.800 --> 2:35:58.000]  but i tell you that of course he how big is vault seven everything we talked about the remote
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:03.600]  watching the remote control cars the planes the trying to set trump up with with spoofed
[2:36:03.600 --> 2:36:09.120]  eyepiece of the russians uh this is a devastating blow three days after trump came out and said
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:14.080]  they're illegally spying on me on sunday uh did they figure it out yet that they don't have the
[2:36:14.080 --> 2:36:19.760]  quote deep state they claim that the american people do i think you're exactly right alex the
[2:36:19.760 --> 2:36:25.680]  uh trump could his timing couldn't have been better with these wiki leak dumps and this dump
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:35.520]  and this vault seven proves uh is that the cia has gone rogue the cia could tap and hack in a way
[2:36:35.520 --> 2:36:40.400]  that it really emulated russia i mean you could be for all intents and purposes you would think
[2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:47.120]  that russia was the one doing the hacking and that's probably the way the cia rogue agents
[2:36:47.120 --> 2:36:55.360]  internally could easily have put on the nsa on the trail of supposed russians that were
[2:36:55.360 --> 2:37:00.800]  working colluding with uh trump on the election when actually it was a cia all the time in a setup
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:08.240]  i mean it's really astounding cia has created a rogue organization within the cia no one knew
[2:37:08.240 --> 2:37:15.360]  about its secret uh that was larger in scope and capability than the nsa and was really a counter
[2:37:15.360 --> 2:37:21.440]  agency to the nsa completely unaccountable to congress i mean where is the nsa was careful
[2:37:21.440 --> 2:37:28.960]  on spy on congress yes the cia was openly doing the nsa is filing on congress the cia is feeding
[2:37:28.960 --> 2:37:35.440]  information into the system emulating the russians or emulating anyone they want no one knows the cia
[2:37:35.440 --> 2:37:40.800]  has these hacking capabilities in fact that's the news they're attacking america blaming the russians
[2:37:40.800 --> 2:37:46.480]  and they admit their own documents they're doing it that this is all espionage it is in
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:52.000]  effect it's espionage and counter espionage it's the through the looking glass that we've talked
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:58.560]  about i mean this is the cia which i think has become the most dangerous agency in the united
[2:37:58.560 --> 2:38:04.160]  states is not the world completely out of control john the russians aren't the threat it's the cia
[2:38:04.160 --> 2:38:12.160]  cia is the threat the cia is the threat uh we don't have control over the cia but let's be clear
[2:38:12.160 --> 2:38:17.040]  i know for a fact high level folks in the cia decades ago were telling their people listen to
[2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:21.840]  the show or aware so there's a lot of patriots in it it's the upper echelon's gotta be removed
[2:38:21.840 --> 2:38:26.640]  why can't trump remove him i know he's trying well he i think trump's gonna do the best job
[2:38:26.640 --> 2:38:35.760]  anyone's ever done i think trump is gonna massively remove people from the cia state department i mean
[2:38:35.760 --> 2:38:43.440]  you know these the percentages of contributions in campaign contributions in 2016 of 96 percent
[2:38:43.440 --> 2:38:48.960]  of contributions to the state department whatever it is for the cia all of these days obama completely
[2:38:48.960 --> 2:38:56.160]  infiltrated by obama and clinton and uh try how could we ever let such scum run everything i mean
[2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:02.000]  well it's it you know this is the problem with the bureaucracy the bureaucracy
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:08.320]  tends to be left as out of it elite education out of universities and there's an inbred culture
[2:39:08.320 --> 2:39:14.160]  in washington dc and don trump is taking it on but it's not going to be easy it's going to be a
[2:39:14.160 --> 2:39:20.480]  war because these intelligence agencies the estate department are not going to go down quiet sure
[2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:25.120]  that's my question don't they know that what what just got leaked got leaked from internally by
[2:39:25.120 --> 2:39:29.200]  patriots understand trump's under attack and the word is as i said months ago their stuff 10 times
[2:39:29.200 --> 2:39:34.400]  worse than this if they don't back off they're going to individually all be burned with their own
[2:39:34.400 --> 2:39:41.520]  system they used against us what hillary was referring to when she knew that if they didn't
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:47.920]  win the election that they all could all be hanging at the end of a noose i mean the i think the crimes
[2:39:47.920 --> 2:39:52.080]  committed by the obama administration are legion the american people are going to be startled
[2:39:52.080 --> 2:39:55.920]  that's why they're fighting so hard even though trump tried to let him go out gracefully is because
[2:39:55.920 --> 2:40:01.840]  they understand they've committed such crimes yeah and this is a fight to the death i mean once
[2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:06.640]  trump i think he's going to do it the right way he's going to get congress to investigate uh trump
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:13.200]  now has control of the justice department all of this nonsense about obama didn't order the fight
[2:40:13.200 --> 2:40:18.480]  saw electronic surveillance well you know obama didn't have to order it the watergate defense
[2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:23.840]  doesn't work sure well plus i mean the democrats call it a death battle i mean that that's why
[2:40:23.840 --> 2:40:28.000]  they say it's a death battle so if we already know about all these crimes and this is nothing
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:31.200]  because obviously trump doesn't want to damage the country of the world bringing all this out
[2:40:31.200 --> 2:40:34.880]  i mean i want to bring it out but i agree some of this is so horrible you should just be stopped
[2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:39.760]  but if they force him he's going to bring stuff out they consider a death battle i mean this is
[2:40:39.760 --> 2:40:45.520]  amazing well it's just beginning this is the very beginning and what you're going to see now from
[2:40:45.520 --> 2:40:50.960]  osanj and wiki leaks the drip drip group of information and by the way on the the things
[2:40:50.960 --> 2:40:56.720]  we're revealing on fanny and freddy are reaching the highest level of government i mean i've gotten
[2:40:56.720 --> 2:41:00.320]  confirmation we're gonna get to that the moment by the way i was told years ago leave osanj alone
[2:41:00.320 --> 2:41:05.440]  when i wasn't sure about him they say he's a super patriot for humanity he allows himself to be the
[2:41:05.440 --> 2:41:09.600]  the figurehead of all this because he's seen all the horrible stuff that's going on as a
[2:41:09.600 --> 2:41:13.520]  changed person that's why he supports trump even though he's a big liberal he's a real liberal
[2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:19.280]  uh i mean i guess snowden and these guys all really are deep state heroes of america that did
[2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:25.360]  what they had to to get this out well you know traditionally or by the you would think the congress
[2:41:25.360 --> 2:41:31.040]  would be investigating you think we'd have a press that was capable of investigating but the new york
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:35.840]  times washington post is not going to investigate barack obama or hillary clinton they're just not
[2:41:35.840 --> 2:41:43.200]  going to do it and the congress with the elite gop leadership from washington ryan mcconnell the
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:48.720]  whole bunch of them bainer before aren't going to investigate the democrats so you you have the
[2:41:48.720 --> 2:41:54.240]  investigative agencies will power in congress and this should have been recognized and brought out
[2:41:54.240 --> 2:42:01.200]  it takes julien assange who has the courage to reveal documents from within these agencies
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:09.600]  the cia never intended anyone to see so this is the this is the whole point is that these
[2:42:09.600 --> 2:42:17.120]  it was a secret rogue operation hidden even from congress you know i gotta ask where did the funding
[2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:23.280]  for this come more massive than the nsa did it come from the cia drug running operations where did
[2:42:23.280 --> 2:42:29.520]  the cia get the money to put this operation together why is the modern cia so arrogant
[2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:36.080]  i think the cia has always been a rogue organization ever since john kennedy and presidents who have
[2:42:36.080 --> 2:42:43.120]  not controlled the cia of john kennedy uh richard nixon have fared well shouldn't sit into trump
[2:42:43.120 --> 2:42:48.480]  just fire even some people are good and rehire them later like the top 40 percent of the cia
[2:42:48.480 --> 2:42:53.440]  just claim the damn thing out we don't even need it and and just you know call people up on espionage
[2:42:53.440 --> 2:42:57.840]  you know they're selling secrets and stuff just a rogue group selling to corporations and just you
[2:42:57.840 --> 2:43:02.560]  know have some public prosecutions and we got to break this right now i think so too i i think
[2:43:02.560 --> 2:43:07.520]  that's important to have immediately let's get some indictments and investigations from the
[2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:11.840]  department of justice but you know john kennedy's mistake was he said he was going to break up the
[2:43:11.840 --> 2:43:17.360]  cia into a thousand pieces and he didn't do it that day you know i'd be happy to see president
[2:43:17.360 --> 2:43:23.280]  trump just issue with an executive order and close down the cia just close it all down confiscate all
[2:43:23.280 --> 2:43:28.480]  of its internal records lock the doors and send in the department of justice find out what's going
[2:43:28.480 --> 2:43:33.200]  on in no no let me shift gears i don't even go to your sources but i know who they are uh you've
[2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:37.920]  got obviously high level executive sources that are like they give us the rest of press too they
[2:43:37.920 --> 2:43:41.600]  won't run with it they're so controlled so they're like info or is more and more like ram paul said
[2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:45.040]  no we know you'll go with this everybody else tries to censor him coming on earlier that they
[2:43:45.040 --> 2:43:48.800]  come here i mean i don't even say that is a good thing i'm ashamed of the media that they try to
[2:43:48.800 --> 2:43:52.640]  cut paul off when he says these things about how he's friends with trump things are going well
[2:43:52.640 --> 2:43:56.560]  none of that's on the news they cut him off uh we're sitting here talking about all this
[2:43:58.080 --> 2:44:04.080]  what do we need to do as listeners uh i mean take all your fanny may you know freddy mac all that
[2:44:04.080 --> 2:44:09.680]  stuff normally that'd be all over the news now our listeners see it millions see it still you're
[2:44:09.680 --> 2:44:13.600]  getting original documents the white house is pointing out places for you to go look on court
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:18.080]  cases that no one's covered you're getting the data mine on obama's crimes all these are felonies
[2:44:18.640 --> 2:44:23.440]  and then you cover it and normally they'd attack us on something they are just zero it's like crickets
[2:44:23.440 --> 2:44:27.680]  on the articles like we're in your fourth of your series now on all this let's talk about what they
[2:44:27.680 --> 2:44:32.160]  don't want people to be aware of well in the article that we're not being attacked because
[2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:36.960]  this the documents i've got are all legitimate no i agree if it's some goofy thing i do or some
[2:44:36.960 --> 2:44:41.840]  social thing they can just disagree when i know when something's powerful they will not touch it
[2:44:41.840 --> 2:44:47.840]  well that what's being exposed here is that obama had decided that we did not need to be a
[2:44:47.840 --> 2:44:53.280]  nation of middle-class homeowners and they were going to take freddy and fanny and they robbed
[2:44:53.280 --> 2:44:59.920]  it they stole you know 260 billion dollars of dividends from the private investors and in freddy
[2:44:59.920 --> 2:45:06.640]  and fanny and put it into obama care to fund insurance subsidies that congress had refused
[2:45:06.640 --> 2:45:10.080]  to appropriate and people think oh that's poor people know it's the damn insurance companies
[2:45:10.080 --> 2:45:16.240]  again that ran paul just talked about who are the enemy what they wanted to do was fund the what
[2:45:16.240 --> 2:45:22.000]  obama wanted to do was fund the insurance companies to take all these losses on the you know people
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:28.320]  who had illnesses that were you know nondisclosed would when the insurance was bought and all kinds
[2:45:28.320 --> 2:45:37.680]  of just cover inappropriate coverages in policies written for older people to have maternal care and
[2:45:37.680 --> 2:45:46.400]  you know child child care etc all of this was a scheme by obama that was going to cost the
[2:45:46.400 --> 2:45:51.920]  taxpayers billions of dollars and by the way uh zealomannual admitted later years after he wrote
[2:45:51.920 --> 2:45:54.640]  about i remember the first i'm not giving you credit remember you write about it world on daily
[2:45:55.760 --> 2:46:00.560]  debt zeal came out and said we want to bankrupt healthcare that's our plan so they admitted they
[2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:06.640]  wanted to wreck it the whole time yes and and the they wanted to wreck fanny and freddy in the process
[2:46:06.640 --> 2:46:12.640]  because you see the turning over the mortgage market to the big banks into they want to kill
[2:46:12.640 --> 2:46:17.280]  wealth and low interest loans just truck wants low interest loans he's ordering the fellow reserve
[2:46:17.280 --> 2:46:22.800]  to do it they hate again it's just it's total jerk behavior the only homeowners that there
[2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:28.560]  would have been the only one subsidized by the government would have been low income buyers
[2:46:28.560 --> 2:46:32.080]  the middle class who never ended up paying it off so it was another group they could use
[2:46:32.080 --> 2:46:37.360]  yeah and the low the middle class would have lost the 30-year fixed rate mortgage we would have lost
[2:46:37.360 --> 2:46:43.200]  the liquidity needed to get reasonably priced mortgages you know they were getting rid of the
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:48.800]  only thing america had left was the real estate bubble they were trying to blow up the final real
[2:46:48.800 --> 2:46:53.600]  estate power america has the final thing we got rid of our industry got rid of all of our everything
[2:46:53.600 --> 2:46:57.520]  they were trying to get rid of the final thing we had and the real estate bubble was caused by the
[2:46:57.520 --> 2:47:02.720]  democrats too because they packed fanny and freddy with all these subprime low and very summers
[2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:09.920]  yeah and then when that exploded what happened was that the they put money into fanny and freddy
[2:47:09.920 --> 2:47:14.320]  with the conservatorship treasury did which would have been fine sure and i know you're a banking
[2:47:14.320 --> 2:47:18.880]  expert that's your real thing from harvard right somebody asked you this why are the democrats
[2:47:18.880 --> 2:47:24.160]  such jerks why would they want to make a middle-class family black white whatever is spanish poor
[2:47:24.160 --> 2:47:32.160]  why are they such jerks obama always was a solansky communist let's face it it wasn't even a socialist
[2:47:32.160 --> 2:47:37.200]  and there's a resentment of the middle class wealth wanting to read it was watching lower classes
[2:47:37.760 --> 2:47:44.320]  any anyone in the middle class who achieves anything economically of the obama mentality
[2:47:44.320 --> 2:47:50.880]  solansky mentality resented and you know went back to racism and sure in east austin it's
[2:47:50.880 --> 2:47:55.520]  gentrifying with hispanics whites blacks you name it building small little nice homes restaurants
[2:47:55.520 --> 2:48:00.720]  moving in and they have the little comic groups coming like attack cat sanctuaries restaurants
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:06.880]  owned by minorities they don't want any wealth they're just total scum right they want to redistribute
[2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:11.920]  wealth to the low income they want to reduce everything to the lower income status so everyone's
[2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:17.440]  dependent on the government home ownership is very threatening to socialists because it allows a
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:22.800]  person to have a sanctuary a place that is there and the bankers above it they want a culture of
[2:48:22.800 --> 2:48:28.720]  renters well the bankers wall street just wants to control the securitization process because then
[2:48:28.720 --> 2:48:34.960]  it would have only big lenders who wanted to build rental properties would be the ones favored in
[2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:41.120]  wall street securitization of mortgages people are so cool and and what's revealed in these
[2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:47.040]  documents is that here's treasury openly discussing the fact that this is going to increase the
[2:48:47.040 --> 2:48:52.400]  cost of mortgages for the middle class it's going to end the 30-year fixed rate mortgage it's going
[2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:56.960]  to undermine the mortgage market for the middle class and they don't care because they think the
[2:48:56.960 --> 2:49:02.400]  united states needs to be a nation of renters like europe and the only ones who they would subsidize
[2:49:02.400 --> 2:49:10.240]  would be low income even around you know the federal uh fha or the va uh these are they can't
[2:49:10.240 --> 2:49:14.720]  compete with three markets so they want to blow it up and they would not come out to tell the
[2:49:14.720 --> 2:49:19.520]  american people this is what they were doing it was all a behind you know they lied to say
[2:49:19.520 --> 2:49:24.160]  that fanny and freddy were sure let's be clear you've got the court cases already adjudicated
[2:49:24.160 --> 2:49:29.920]  this is criminal fraud so who cares if trump looks vindictive laws have been violated sessions
[2:49:29.920 --> 2:49:35.520]  should be recusing himself he should be on their butts well said this is a major issue for sessions

[2:54:54.400 --> 2:55:00.000]  coming up from london dr. coursey i've got an article here on info wars.com by cliford cuttingham
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:04.160]  report us troops deployed to syria in response to turkish threat that was prevent attack on
[2:55:04.160 --> 2:55:08.880]  Kurdish forces by turkey ices a lot of good stuff's happening a lot of evil against the
[2:55:08.880 --> 2:55:14.320]  america's coming out but what are wildcards are you concerned about i think the globalists are so
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:20.640]  desperate they're openly hyping it they might try to kill trump plunge the economy do anything to
[2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:25.520]  try to stop this western recovery that i mean obviously they want a consolidation they want
[2:55:25.520 --> 2:55:29.520]  a world of renters what else is on your radar screen you're a smart guy what else are you worried
[2:55:29.520 --> 2:55:36.640]  about well i i think you're gonna see a couple things first of all trump is very always been
[2:55:36.640 --> 2:55:44.240]  very lucky all of his life he needs to have top top security right now especially when we know for
[2:55:44.240 --> 2:55:52.000]  a fact the cia is rogue and is packed with john brennan i think basically traitors of the united
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:59.280]  states john brenner sleeper cells exactly and and and president trump needs to take threat from the
[2:55:59.280 --> 2:56:06.480]  cia seriously it's it's a dangerous organization and um if it were my choice uh the middle of
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:10.640]  night at issue an executive order when they all showed up to work tomorrow the doors would be locked
[2:56:10.640 --> 2:56:16.560]  and i'd seize the agency i agree i think he's the agency and if people want to resist that and we're
[2:56:16.560 --> 2:56:20.800]  not looking for trouble but they're the ones pushing violence in the news i mean the president has a
[2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:25.440]  lot of power against espionage and i don't care if it's corporate espionage it's the same thing as
[2:56:25.440 --> 2:56:31.520]  if the russians did it yeah i'd also do undertake a major investigation of george soros and i'd shut
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:38.400]  him down he's um completely running counter to the united states interests his funding he's got more
[2:56:38.400 --> 2:56:43.600]  more power as an individual over national policy than maybe any individuals had in the history of
[2:56:43.600 --> 2:56:49.520]  the world and it's rogue as well he thinks he's president and third i would the federal reserve
[2:56:49.520 --> 2:56:54.960]  is going to raise rates they held rates at zero throughout the obama administration can't the
[2:56:54.960 --> 2:56:58.160]  president order them to do something they claim they're under the president's order what can you
[2:56:58.160 --> 2:57:02.080]  order that oh they can they're independent though they know i know they're i know they're a fraud
[2:57:02.080 --> 2:57:07.840]  that they claim they're not so what does he do to block that well you can't i mean janet yon was
[2:57:07.840 --> 2:57:13.920]  completely in obama's corner she allowed obama do you know basically add a trillion dollar sure
[2:57:13.920 --> 2:57:18.560]  she's trying to kill the trump recovery so what does he do about that well trump's gonna i think
[2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:24.960]  trump will be smart enough to take the rate increase and to turn up the heat on congress to pass a
[2:57:24.960 --> 2:57:30.560]  massive tax cut exactly so all of these things if trump is allowed he's going to boomerang and
[2:57:30.560 --> 2:57:33.680]  you're an economist you know that the public doesn't briefly explain if they're going to
[2:57:33.680 --> 2:57:38.720]  raise rates we've got to cut taxes explain that metric well if they raise rates it's going to
[2:57:38.720 --> 2:57:43.600]  slow down the economy because everything's going to cost more it's going to cost more even to
[2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:48.560]  to service the federal debt at two trillion dollars uh mortgage rates are going to go up everything
[2:57:48.560 --> 2:57:54.080]  interest rate based is going to cost more what you do to counter that is you essentially lower
[2:57:54.080 --> 2:57:59.520]  taxes in order to stimulate economic growth and that helps the power of the presidency
[2:57:59.520 --> 2:58:04.240]  take control of fed i know it's a private group but they always claim it's not can't he politically
[2:58:04.240 --> 2:58:11.040]  dominate that group he needs to get janet yon to resign and to appoint someone in there who's not
[2:58:11.040 --> 2:58:16.880]  so politically motivated for the democrats uh the federal reserve's been under the much
[2:58:16.880 --> 2:58:21.840]  good to nominate i mean he listens you know you who would you nominate who's good oh well
[2:58:21.840 --> 2:58:25.200]  i think several people that would be very good i mean i have to think through a list to come up
[2:58:25.200 --> 2:58:33.280]  with with a name but the point is under obama obama politicized the federal reserve he politicized
[2:58:33.280 --> 2:58:39.200]  the treasury he politicized income tax in the irs he politicized the department of justice in the
[2:58:39.200 --> 2:58:46.240]  fbi he politicized the uh state department so the president can do that dr coursey your articles

[3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:43.040]  begun flagging fake news or as facebook calls it disputed news a warning label is being slapped
[3:08:43.040 --> 3:08:48.240]  on articles that clearly have no basis in fact or reality what you mean the entire front page of cnn
[3:08:48.800 --> 3:08:53.200]  or at least some of them the giant social network first promised to roll out a disputed tag in
[3:08:53.200 --> 3:08:58.480]  december of course you've got governments across europe uh threatening by the way paul just in a rub
[3:08:58.480 --> 3:09:03.680]  and let you take over this new certification of fake news is a certification everybody should
[3:09:03.680 --> 3:09:09.600]  spread it and read it this is going to backfire we take action against us go ahead and here i've
[3:09:09.600 --> 3:09:15.120]  just found another example of it now alex i just scrolled down my facebook page this is a story
[3:09:15.120 --> 3:09:21.520]  that i published on info wars dot com yesterday morning posted it on the alex jones facebook page
[3:09:21.520 --> 3:09:25.440]  got probably about 3000 tell the crew how to pull it up i want to show viewers this
[3:09:26.480 --> 3:09:31.680]  yeah if you go to my facebook page if you if they're just typing my name into facebook go to the
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:38.080]  page where it's the sepia profile pic image scroll down until you get to an article if you can even
[3:09:38.080 --> 3:09:42.880]  see it they might not even be able to see it it's called former cia analyst obama gave green light
[3:09:42.880 --> 3:09:50.640]  for nsa cia cia to sabotage trump that article on your facebook page alex got about 4 000 shares
[3:09:50.640 --> 3:09:57.440]  so it was going viral on your page on my page i posted the same link the same text it's a genuine
[3:09:57.440 --> 3:10:04.000]  article a former cia analyst got up on arty and said that it was correct that obama had spied on
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:09.200]  trump that he gave the green light for the nsa and the cia to do it completely legitimate news
[3:10:09.200 --> 3:10:15.920]  article now on facebook on my facebook page it says did you post this it looks like it might be spam
[3:10:15.920 --> 3:10:20.720]  if you didn't post this yourself will help to secure your account i have seen this message
[3:10:20.720 --> 3:10:27.040]  on literally every other info so this is cyber war as we protect the president as we expose
[3:10:27.040 --> 3:10:32.000]  this really happening as congress says it's fake we're not allowed to tell the public they want
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:36.400]  their lie to work it's not going to work we're just going to leak more stuff dumbasses zuckerberg
[3:10:37.440 --> 3:10:42.880]  yes strident effect but now people can't comment on this post they can't share it it's
[3:10:42.880 --> 3:10:48.000]  basically defunct and dead on facebook and i'm seeing this for every other info wasling i've
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:52.960]  posted over the last four or five days and as i said it's because we're completely kicking
[3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:58.720]  their butts you had cnn last night on stelter's show and we're going to play the clip later
[3:10:58.720 --> 3:11:04.800]  they get up and say basically this fake news thing that we created it's backfires now everyone's
[3:11:04.800 --> 3:11:10.480]  calling us fake news of course trump pioneered that so they've come up with a new term for it
[3:11:10.480 --> 3:11:17.280]  which is vd viral deception which also of course sounds like a sexually transmitted disease
[3:11:17.280 --> 3:11:24.560]  so last night we start the hashtag cnn has has vd on twitter that started going viral
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:28.720]  and that's going to blow up in their face but you know that doesn't really affect them as much as
[3:11:28.720 --> 3:11:35.360]  fake news would affect them because very few few things that cnn does actually go viral so it kind
[3:11:35.360 --> 3:11:40.800]  of works in their favor they regurgitate the common narrative on every issue that's how they maintain
[3:11:40.800 --> 3:11:46.240]  power individually they're not going viral with certain articles so now again the empire is
[3:11:46.240 --> 3:11:52.400]  striking back they're trying to redefine fake news this term has failed the stanford university
[3:11:52.400 --> 3:11:58.720]  study found that quote fake news which does exist and is people deliberately putting out false
[3:11:58.720 --> 3:12:04.240]  information to make advertising money which is not what we do it's not people who have a different
[3:12:04.240 --> 3:12:09.280]  opinion which is what they're treating it at treating it as to censor everyone else so now
[3:12:09.280 --> 3:12:15.920]  that's happening stanford university study comes out and concludes quote fake news had no impact
[3:12:15.920 --> 3:12:21.120]  on the u.s presidential election and complete hope by the way paul i've got a whole team in there
[3:12:21.120 --> 3:12:25.520]  and and there's there's one facebook that has your normal face on that has a sepia face
[3:12:25.520 --> 3:12:28.880]  you're talking about i just spent time in there we're just gonna shut the whole show down till
[3:12:28.880 --> 3:12:32.960]  this happens we're gonna shut the whole show down till this happens walk us through or turn your
[3:12:32.960 --> 3:12:38.160]  webcam around and show everybody this is one of my little ocd things i go through because i don't

[3:12:44.240 --> 3:12:47.680]  of what's been banned on facebook because we don't make a big enough deal about all this yeah just

[3:12:51.200 --> 3:12:54.480]  everybody right here that's what folks want to see right it's what you don't want you to see folks
[3:12:55.200 --> 3:13:00.480]  because again they're a total war against us did you post this it looks like it might be spam
[3:13:00.480 --> 3:13:05.200]  did you post this yourself okay let's see the actual article in your controller they
[3:13:05.200 --> 3:13:10.320]  don't want you to see paul watson former ci analyst larry c johnson says that according
[3:13:10.320 --> 3:13:14.880]  to his sources that was on national tv the obama administration worked with the nsa
[3:13:14.880 --> 3:13:21.520]  ci and british ghc hq to just submit information to Donald trump that was illegally obtained
[3:13:21.520 --> 3:13:26.080]  via surveillance now we have congress saying this is totally credible this is why they're
[3:13:26.080 --> 3:13:30.960]  banning it it's former ci analyst shared there's there's no share option there's no option to

[3:14:26.480 --> 3:14:31.760]  see any of this they do not want you to know that they set trump up is they're so scared this is the
[3:14:31.760 --> 3:14:39.040]  cia with facebook doing this wow they don't want you keep going keep going keep going down it should

[3:14:59.840 --> 3:15:04.240]  because it's so credible and it's former cia should be above there exposing the illegalness
[3:15:04.240 --> 3:15:09.600]  they've just deeply deleted nobody else can see it so they don't even want you to know that former
[3:15:09.600 --> 3:15:14.800]  top cia folks are going on tv sainz real but guess what obama and zuckerberg it's all coming on
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:18.880]  anyways criminals so it doesn't matter what you do paul back to you i'll quit bugging you go great
[3:15:18.880 --> 3:15:24.000]  job chris i want to show that and then you see i've just clicked not spam and it's it it's still the
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:29.920]  same it's still deleted even when you tell them it's not spam it's still completely censored for
[3:15:29.920 --> 3:15:36.080]  everybody else so this is how they're doing it and i've seen it on every other info wars link that
[3:15:36.080 --> 3:15:42.400]  i've posted over the past five days so basically half of the info wars links are now completely
[3:15:42.400 --> 3:15:47.280]  censored off of my facebook and i've seen it on your facebook as well alex where they do exactly
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:53.360]  the same thing so you know we this wasn't any penny the sky is falling you've just seen an
[3:15:53.360 --> 3:15:58.480]  example of how they're wiping content off the internet people say well why don't you just
[3:15:58.480 --> 3:16:02.720]  build your own facebook well we don't have like a billion people on it so it would be completely
[3:16:02.720 --> 3:16:07.760]  pointless you have to fight them on their own battleground so again that's that's just an example
[3:16:07.760 --> 3:16:12.880]  of how they're coming after us now we're gonna have to have to get around it but we will win now
[3:16:12.880 --> 3:16:19.200]  of course the the big news today is bolt seven they're calling it bigger than edward snowden you
[3:16:19.200 --> 3:16:25.040]  wouldn't know that from looking on the front page of cnn as of about an hour ago because
[3:16:25.040 --> 3:16:32.320]  there's nothing whatsoever about the story the biggest news story in america today the biggest
[3:16:32.320 --> 3:16:38.720]  surveillance story people are saying for probably a decade or more bigger than edward snowden what
[3:16:38.720 --> 3:16:45.200]  was that four years ago not a single story about this on the front page of cnn that's right paul
[3:16:45.200 --> 3:16:49.680]  let me just jump in because this is so important to all of us we have the info wars dot com article
[3:16:49.680 --> 3:16:54.800]  you wrote and others we can put up on screen former ceo analyst obama gave green life for nsa
[3:16:54.800 --> 3:17:00.000]  ceo to sabotage trump we use facebook and twitter to get this out but folks don't just count on that
[3:17:00.000 --> 3:17:07.440]  shin the actual url to everyone you know saying this is censored they don't want you to know
[3:17:07.440 --> 3:17:13.680]  that the government rogue is targeting our president trying to stop him they are so scared of you
[3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:19.440]  when i say spread these links this is a war people so there it is info wars dot com that's
[3:17:19.440 --> 3:17:23.680]  why we jump around on facebook google twitter youtube all of it because we're constantly
[3:17:23.680 --> 3:17:28.560]  being censored people say well why don't you leave it we are saying leave to info wars dot com
[3:17:28.560 --> 3:17:33.440]  president planet dot com but they're after those they cut off our sponsorship on google ads banned
[3:17:33.440 --> 3:17:39.280]  last week roger stoneman everybody's they're after us it's a war with criminals that hijacked the
[3:17:39.280 --> 3:17:45.360]  government and we're going to kick zuckerberg and eric schmitz goddamn asses go ahead paul
[3:17:46.080 --> 3:17:50.720]  spread the links they're not going to win these pieces of trash think they own us in our families
[3:17:50.720 --> 3:17:58.640]  while they run slave camps all over the world and suicide factories in china apple scum go ahead it's
[3:17:58.640 --> 3:18:04.400]  absolutely incredible because again they're the big they're the biggest progenitors of fake right
[3:18:04.400 --> 3:18:09.840]  the most the most harmful fake news imaginable they're always behind it and we saw another example
[3:18:10.560 --> 3:18:15.920]  just last week with trump's big speech in front of congress you had during the two minutes of
[3:18:15.920 --> 3:18:21.920]  the plow run chinese death camps they hate us in our families zuckerberg hates everyone so to schmit
[3:18:21.920 --> 3:18:29.280]  they're the enemy so's obama god people so you had karen owens the um widow of the military
[3:18:29.280 --> 3:18:35.360]  uh veteran who was killed you know she got the two-minute standing ovation who wasn't standing
[3:18:35.360 --> 3:18:41.200]  for that ovation well it was debbie wassenman schultz and uh ellison the vice dnc chair
[3:18:41.200 --> 3:18:47.360]  there was a journalist there at trump's congressional speech who was constantly watching the democrats
[3:18:47.360 --> 3:18:53.280]  their reaction the fact that they didn't clap anything basically he tweeted when this happened
[3:18:53.280 --> 3:19:00.400]  debbie wassenman schultz and ellison did not stand for the elongated two-minute applause of karen owens
[3:19:00.400 --> 3:19:08.000]  the military widow fake news came out basically an hour or two after he tweeted that this called him
[3:19:08.000 --> 3:19:15.120]  a liar set the inside it set the entire twitter sick mob the witch hunt specialist on this journalist
[3:19:15.120 --> 3:19:20.880]  because he tweeted that wassenman schultz and ellison did not stand for the two-minute applause
[3:19:20.880 --> 3:19:28.880]  of karen owens they said they did stand that was the first instance where she was applauded briefly
[3:19:28.880 --> 3:19:36.000]  so she was applauded twice the first one they stood the second elongated applause where you had
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:42.000]  karen owens standing up crying that was the big news story debbie wassenman schultz and ellison
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:49.840]  did not stand yet the media the fake news media went after this journalist claiming he was putting
[3:19:49.840 --> 3:19:55.600]  out fake news when he was completely accurate you can read all about it is the story i reported
[3:19:55.600 --> 3:20:02.000]  facts from trump's address to congress people who didn't like those facts called it fake news
[3:20:02.000 --> 3:20:08.240]  news so again he goes through there were two applauses the first one yes they stood the second
[3:20:08.240 --> 3:20:14.400]  elongated applause for karen owens the military widow the fallen navy seal ryan owens they did
[3:20:14.400 --> 3:20:21.520]  not stand for that at any point that's shocking that's a news story he tweeted it out they came
[3:20:21.520 --> 3:20:27.600]  after him within hours saying that he was putting out fake news and that they did stand for this
[3:20:27.600 --> 3:20:34.720]  two minutes applause complete bs once again mainstream media court putting out fake news
[3:20:34.720 --> 3:20:42.160]  while they call us fake news while facebook now directly censors our articles as you've just seen
[3:20:43.200 --> 3:20:50.480]  so you've got fake news across the board you now have cnn and this is happening probably at once
[3:20:50.480 --> 3:20:57.600]  every two weeks now at what point does it stop being a coincidence you had someone get on cnn
[3:20:57.600 --> 3:21:02.800]  talking about the link between terrorism and refugees the link between terror attacks and
[3:21:02.800 --> 3:21:09.920]  migrants the fact that the fbi says 30 of their domestic terrorism cases are that they're investigating
[3:21:09.920 --> 3:21:17.280]  have links to refugees somebody gets up on cnn and says this and they're cut off within seconds
[3:21:17.280 --> 3:21:21.600]  just a coincidence in fact we've got this clip if we can go to it right now
[3:21:25.200 --> 3:21:29.680]  congress now investigating president trump's explosive claims of being wiretapped by the
[3:21:29.680 --> 3:21:35.600]  obama no it's not poletano we need to go to the cnn yeah we'll get the right clip in a second this
[3:21:35.600 --> 3:21:42.880]  is um american mirror the headline is cnn cuts feed right after guest sites refugee crime stats
[3:21:42.880 --> 3:21:47.440]  during a segment on donald trump's travel ban from terror prone countries the news network
[3:21:47.440 --> 3:21:53.680]  mysteriously lost its guests as he made a point about refugees this is the clip we have it right
[3:21:53.680 --> 3:21:58.800]  now important for our security and i think the people overwhelmingly in the country want that
[3:21:58.800 --> 3:22:05.120]  as well too because again just today the fbi comes out and says that 30 30 percent of their
[3:22:05.120 --> 3:22:10.800]  domestic terrorism cases that they're investigating are from folks who are refugees it's important
[3:22:10.800 --> 3:22:18.880]  not to label all refugees bad people that's not why i'm here but i was just gonna say congressman
[3:22:18.880 --> 3:22:23.760]  it's time to go but i think the tv gremlins did that for us thank you very much to the congressman
[3:22:23.760 --> 3:22:30.640]  for joining us that hey whoops now if it happened in isolation if it only happened that on time
[3:22:30.640 --> 3:22:35.440]  maybe a couple of other times over the course of you know three or four years you would say that's
[3:22:35.440 --> 3:22:43.920]  just a coincidence this has happened on cnn probably about five times in the past what four
[3:22:43.920 --> 3:22:49.120]  or five months you had the instance where the reporter was talking about you know hillary clinton
[3:22:49.120 --> 3:22:54.880]  super predator common that was cut you had bernie sanders go up there just the two or three weeks
[3:22:54.880 --> 3:23:01.040]  ago you start talking about fake news he got caught you had i think it was a congressman talking
[3:23:01.040 --> 3:23:08.000]  about the wiki leaks revelations right before the election he was on with chris komo he got cut
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:13.280]  there are other examples in this american mirror article they go through them every time somebody
[3:23:13.280 --> 3:23:18.960]  starts to get onto a talking point which crushes their narrative like the link between terrorism
[3:23:18.960 --> 3:23:24.800]  and refugees again the fbi says 30 percent of their domestic terrorism cases are related to
[3:23:24.800 --> 3:23:33.600]  migrants to refugees he suddenly goes bye bye just a coincidence and cnn as i discussed earlier
[3:23:34.560 --> 3:23:40.320]  has now come out and completely disavowed this fake news term they're saying it doesn't work
[3:23:40.320 --> 3:23:46.080]  of course months ago we featured the stories i think it was in the washington post where they
[3:23:46.080 --> 3:23:54.240]  admitted this fake news term has been appropriated by the people who were accusing of being fake news
[3:23:54.240 --> 3:24:00.960]  and it's being used against us and of course the pioneer of that was donald trump himself so probably
[3:24:00.960 --> 3:24:07.120]  two or three months ago now they realized that this was only damaging them the fake news was
[3:24:07.120 --> 3:24:13.360]  becoming a synonym for the mainstream media so now they're having to change the term this is upon
[3:24:13.360 --> 3:24:19.520]  milo unopolis's website cnn invents new phrase for fake news promptly gets accused of that too
[3:24:19.520 --> 3:24:25.920]  now you see the washington post talking about fake news but cnn has apparently abandoned
[3:24:25.920 --> 3:24:31.360]  the fake news slur after it blew up in their face horrendously the reliable sources twitter account
[3:24:31.360 --> 3:24:36.080]  tweeted the following video earlier today explaining the flaws of fake of the fake news slur
[3:24:36.640 --> 3:24:41.440]  following that video's release which we're going to play here in a second twitter users began
[3:24:41.440 --> 3:24:48.720]  proclaiming hashtag cnn has bd which i'm proud to say that i started no word yet on whether
[3:24:48.720 --> 3:24:54.080]  president donald trump will recognize cnn's news status as a viral deception platform so they've
[3:24:54.080 --> 3:25:01.680]  renamed cnn has renamed fake news as viral deception as vd literally sounds like a sexual
[3:25:01.680 --> 3:25:09.040]  disease again because they acknowledge this fake news slur only boomeranged and blew up in their
[3:25:09.040 --> 3:25:15.440]  own faces not just because we used it against them in an ad hominem manner like they did against us
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:21.280]  but because you had the stanford university study which again showed that quote fake news
[3:25:21.840 --> 3:25:30.400]  had no impact on the us presidential election no noticeable impact so whereas you know it's a back
[3:25:30.400 --> 3:25:35.600]  and forth between the alternative media and the mainstream media calling each other fake news you
[3:25:35.600 --> 3:25:42.080]  actually dig down underneath this narrative and you realize it's completely phony to begin with
[3:25:42.080 --> 3:25:48.400]  their whole narrative was that donald trump won the election because of russian hacking no evidence
[3:25:48.400 --> 3:25:56.800]  for that and because of fake news manipulating american voters stanford university study not
[3:25:56.800 --> 3:26:04.640]  exactly a right wing outfit found that quote fake news had no impact on the us presidential election
[3:26:04.640 --> 3:26:11.920]  narrative debunked now they're having to disavow the term altogether they've renamed it vd
[3:26:11.920 --> 3:26:22.240]  let's go to this cnn clip do we have the clip all right we'll try and get that in a minute
[3:26:22.240 --> 3:26:28.480]  but again it just shows you the absolute desperation that's taking hold again as of an hour ago
[3:26:29.040 --> 3:26:35.120]  bolt seven what they're calling the biggest a bigger story than the edward snowden revelations
[3:26:35.120 --> 3:26:41.600]  and cnn on their front page again maybe different now but as of an hour ago after this story had
[3:26:41.600 --> 3:26:49.840]  already been out for hours they did not have one single story on vault seven absolutely
[3:26:49.840 --> 3:26:55.600]  incredible is it any wonder that they get called fake news is it any wonder that they're having to
[3:26:55.600 --> 3:27:03.360]  change terms change definitions and now as you saw facebook just outright censoring info wars
[3:27:03.360 --> 3:27:08.720]  dot com articles altogether you know we had it before where i think it was on twitter or facebook
[3:27:08.720 --> 3:27:16.240]  where we would post a picture of an isis fighter to illustrate a news article about isis and they
[3:27:16.240 --> 3:27:22.880]  would delete the article claiming that it was isis propaganda you know similar to how they're now
[3:27:22.880 --> 3:27:28.560]  opening up charges for marina le pen they remove protection so charges could happen
[3:27:28.560 --> 3:27:36.160]  where she posts isis photos of them for example killing burning the geordanian pilot in the cage
[3:27:36.160 --> 3:27:42.640]  as evidence that isis is a threat and now they say that that is spreading isis propaganda she
[3:27:42.640 --> 3:27:47.920]  could be charged for that absolutely ridiculous but they've done that on social media for years
[3:27:47.920 --> 3:27:54.480]  now they're bypassing that all together and just censoring info wars links as soon as you post them
[3:27:54.480 --> 3:27:59.920]  by declaring them spam no one can share them no one can comment on them again that was going viral
[3:27:59.920 --> 3:28:05.680]  that particular article on the alex jones facebook page it got through there i have to check back see
[3:28:05.680 --> 3:28:12.640]  if they've deleted it there as well but on my page which you know has another 450 000 followers gone
[3:28:13.440 --> 3:28:22.800]  memory hold this is the fake news war that is now heating up and of course it's to target
[3:28:22.800 --> 3:28:28.080]  not just news organizations but people like wiki leaks remember we had that whole narrative about
[3:28:28.080 --> 3:28:33.680]  how they wanted to define wiki leaks as fake news they wanted to suggest that the uh
[3:28:33.680 --> 3:28:39.440]  the pedestrian emails were fake that they weren't real they tried that that failed now we have bolt
[3:28:39.440 --> 3:28:49.360]  seven massive revelations coming out particularly about the cia cia exploring ways to hack vehicles
[3:28:49.360 --> 3:28:56.320]  in order to carry out undetectable assassinations this is up on info wars dot com new newly released
[3:28:56.320 --> 3:29:00.640]  documents by wiki leaks revealed that the cia explored hacking the control systems of modern
[3:29:00.640 --> 3:29:06.880]  vehicles potentially to carry out undetectable assassinations so the quote from wiki leaks as
[3:29:06.880 --> 3:29:12.320]  of october 2014 the cia was looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by cars and
[3:29:12.320 --> 3:29:19.520]  trucks again to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations well what happened to michael
[3:29:19.520 --> 3:29:27.760]  hastings he wrote an article 11 days before a mysterious car crash entitled why democrats
[3:29:27.760 --> 3:29:35.120]  love to spy on americans 11 days before his car crash isn't that interesting isn't it interesting
[3:29:35.120 --> 3:29:41.200]  that michael hastings was working on a big expose of the cia was receiving death threats
[3:29:41.200 --> 3:29:47.280]  basically running away from government agents days before his car crash will be back on the
[3:29:47.280 --> 3:29:55.120]  alex jones show live don't go away we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn
[3:29:55.120 --> 3:30:06.320]  radio network a previously debunked claim alleging then candidate donald trump ran a secret server
[3:30:06.320 --> 3:30:13.040]  to communicate with russia during the 2016 presidential race has resurfaced the establishment
[3:30:13.040 --> 3:30:19.120]  mainstream media is now rehashing this story which has already been debunked after president
[3:30:19.120 --> 3:30:25.760]  donald trump on saturday accused his predecessor brock obama of illegally wiretapping phone
[3:30:25.760 --> 3:30:31.520]  calls at new york's trump tower mainstream media outlets began to list possible surveillance
[3:30:31.520 --> 3:30:38.800]  targets including trump's so-called secret server to talk with the russians and look who's spreading
[3:30:38.800 --> 3:30:45.840]  the fake news hillary clinton posted on twitter that it's time for trump to answer serious questions
[3:30:45.840 --> 3:30:52.560]  about his ties to russia and she included a link to the original slate article that started the

[3:33:16.800 --> 3:33:26.720]  we are back live and as you saw before the breaks
[3:33:26.720 --> 3:33:32.240]  facebook is now directly censoring info wars dot com articles we've complained about this
[3:33:32.240 --> 3:33:39.280]  for many years sometimes it's been redressed after pressure now they're just censoring right at the
[3:33:39.280 --> 3:33:45.440]  source this is the only way they can try and defeat us because they're losing when it comes to having
[3:33:45.440 --> 3:33:53.040]  an actual fair argument on a level playing field we're kicking their butts over and over again on
[3:33:53.040 --> 3:33:59.680]  every single issue so they have to play dirty and you know liberals will say oh it's private
[3:33:59.680 --> 3:34:04.800]  company they can yeah it's funny that isn't it that liberals are only for the rights of private
[3:34:04.800 --> 3:34:11.920]  company when those private companies are censoring conservatives they don't have that same zeal
[3:34:11.920 --> 3:34:17.840]  for supporting the private rights of private companies you know when for example a bakery
[3:34:17.840 --> 3:34:23.920]  refuses to bake a gay wedding cake oh then private companies have no rights whatsoever
[3:34:23.920 --> 3:34:29.360]  they have to do whatever they're told but not when it comes to censoring conservatives that one
[3:34:29.360 --> 3:34:36.320]  little facet in isolation then they're really for the private rights of companies interesting that
[3:34:36.320 --> 3:34:42.400]  isn't it very interesting and given that twitter now facebook as well they want to be considered as
[3:34:42.400 --> 3:34:48.240]  public utilities it's basically coming to the point where you know it would be akin to them
[3:34:48.240 --> 3:34:53.920]  shutting off your landline phone because you posted things on the internet which the government
[3:34:53.920 --> 3:34:59.360]  didn't like that's the level that it's coming to if they want to be considered public utilities then
[3:34:59.360 --> 3:35:07.440]  fine will treat you as one you can't censor people for posting articles about ex CIA analysts who
[3:35:07.440 --> 3:35:14.000]  come out and say that trumps right that obama did order the spying that it was ordered for the CIA
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:21.200]  and the NSA to sabotage trumps embryonic administration perfectly legitimate news story
[3:35:21.200 --> 3:35:28.080]  not intended to deceive not created uh you know under false pretenses simply to get advertising

[3:37:11.120 --> 3:37:17.200]  about how their fake news narrative has been completely overturned boomerang back on them
[3:37:17.200 --> 3:37:23.360]  blew up in their face so now they're having to redefine it let's go to the clip talk a lot
[3:37:23.360 --> 3:37:28.400]  on this part about fake news and i know that's a term that you detest uh why is that what what
[3:37:28.400 --> 3:37:33.760]  should we be calling made up stories instead i'd like to call them viral deception and i'd like to
[3:37:33.760 --> 3:37:40.480]  use the the vd acronym because i'd like to associate it with venereal venereal disease we don't want
[3:37:40.480 --> 3:37:44.880]  to get venereal disease if you find someone who's got it you want to quarantine and cure them you
[3:37:44.880 --> 3:37:49.920]  don't want to transmit it by virtue of saying fake news we ask the question well what is real news
[3:37:49.920 --> 3:37:55.040]  and you invite people to label everything they disapprove of fake news as a result it's not a
[3:37:55.040 --> 3:38:00.000]  useful concept what are we really concerned about deception and deception of a certain sort that
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:05.040]  goes viral right much of that deception isn't actually imitating news it's imitating news
[3:38:05.040 --> 3:38:09.840]  like structures it's narrative inform but nonetheless if we say we're only concerned with
[3:38:09.840 --> 3:38:14.640]  fake news we may be missing a lot of things that are going viral that are deceptive and many things
[3:38:14.640 --> 3:38:19.520]  that are found in quasi fake news sites that is they're appropriate in the credibility of news
[3:38:19.520 --> 3:38:23.920]  trying to look like the cnn website for example aren't only found there sometimes are
[3:38:26.320 --> 3:38:33.920]  so there you have it hashtag cnn has vd hashtag cnn has vd that actually somebody told me it
[3:38:33.920 --> 3:38:38.880]  started trending last night on twitter i don't know i was in bed at the time but let's turn this one
[3:38:38.880 --> 3:38:44.720]  back on them as well if they want to play more games we'll play more games of course what's really
[3:38:44.720 --> 3:38:50.960]  fake news is when the fake news mainstream media went after this reporter and claimed he was lying
[3:38:50.960 --> 3:38:57.280]  when he tweeted out that wasman shulks and keith ellison didn't stand for the two minute applause
[3:38:57.280 --> 3:39:03.840]  of the military widow during trump's speech that was completely true they didn't stand but the fake
[3:39:03.840 --> 3:39:10.320]  news mainstream media came out and attacked this journalist they sacked the twitter outrage mob on
[3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:16.320]  him when he was completely accurate you know what's fake news it's fake news when the media comes out
[3:39:16.320 --> 3:39:24.000]  and says that trump supporters were waving russian flags at cpac a lot of fake news journalists came
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:29.840]  out and said that it was completely inaccurate they were given these flags by a leftist organization
[3:39:29.840 --> 3:39:34.320]  that had crashed the event then they instantly took a picture of them they didn't include that in the
[3:39:34.320 --> 3:39:40.080]  article because they were progenitor they were putting out fake news it was fake news when the
[3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:48.320]  mainstream media said that 300 000 people attended an anti-trump protest in london that didn't happen
[3:39:48.320 --> 3:39:53.920]  only around 2000 people attended that protest a couple of weekends ago again fake news
[3:39:53.920 --> 3:40:00.960]  bus feed came out a few weeks ago and said that the deep state doesn't exist literally said it was a
[3:40:00.960 --> 3:40:06.480]  conspiracy theory that there were elements within the nsa and cia that were trying to sabotage trump
[3:40:07.120 --> 3:40:14.160]  said the deep state itself was a conspiracy theory okay that's fake news you have cnn coming out
[3:40:14.160 --> 3:40:20.000]  about a month ago saying that le penne is winning in france because rusher is interfering in the
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:28.160]  french election again completely fake news you know the trump piss gate dossier completely
[3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:34.480]  fake news they get caught in the most egregious damaging fake news over and over again so yes
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:42.640]  they've earned the moniker fake news and now they don't like it so they're trying to change it into vd
[3:40:42.640 --> 3:40:51.840]  cnn has vd hashtag cnn has vd let's make that blow up in their face as well absolutely incredible
[3:40:52.720 --> 3:40:59.840]  of course another thing they would have labeled fake news back in 2006 when we first reported on it
[3:41:00.400 --> 3:41:06.160]  is the fact that the government was using microphones in mobile phones in computers
[3:41:06.160 --> 3:41:13.120]  in smart televisions to spy on people's conversations they would have called that fake news when we put
[3:41:13.120 --> 3:41:19.040]  it out in fact they did call this conspiracy theorists when we published that 11 years ago
[3:41:20.160 --> 3:41:26.800]  11 years before this current controversy with vault seven and wiki leaks and i posted
[3:41:26.800 --> 3:41:33.920]  the original article from 2006 up on twitter today this was written 11 years ago okay government
[3:41:33.920 --> 3:41:40.240]  industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million americans private industry and eventually
[3:41:40.240 --> 3:41:46.000]  government it's planning to use microphones in the computers of an estimated 150 million plus
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:52.240]  internet active americans to spy on their lifestyle choices build psychological profiles which will
[3:41:52.240 --> 3:41:59.520]  be used for surveillance and minority report style invasive advertising advertising and data mining
[3:41:59.520 --> 3:42:08.640]  so again september 2006 we put out what wiki leaks is now reporting on from these leaked cia documents
[3:42:08.640 --> 3:42:14.560]  that they were planning to and in fact did use smart televisions cell phones and computers
[3:42:15.120 --> 3:42:20.480]  use the microphones to spy on people's conversations they would have called us conspiracy theorists
[3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:25.520]  fake news outlets for reporting on that 11 years ago and then you saw you just flashed up there
[3:42:25.520 --> 3:42:33.440]  briefly back in 2012 and this gets even more specific we put out the article with the headline
[3:42:33.440 --> 3:42:42.400]  samsung tvs can be hacked to spy on viewers december 14 2012 what for four and a bit years
[3:42:42.400 --> 3:42:50.560]  before this came out today with the exact same information the cia using samsung smart tvs
[3:42:50.560 --> 3:42:57.200]  to spy on people's conversations via the microphone embedded in the tv with people
[3:42:57.200 --> 3:43:03.280]  thinking that they've turned them off and they're not even turned off so over four years ago
[3:43:03.920 --> 3:43:11.120]  info wars dot com reported on that specifically samsung tvs being used to spy on people's
[3:43:11.120 --> 3:43:19.600]  conversations we reported on it again in november 2014 with this headline samsung smart tv records
[3:43:19.600 --> 3:43:26.160]  personal conversations and sends them to third parties they admitted in their own privacy policy
[3:43:26.160 --> 3:43:33.280]  a 46 page document that all newly purchased samsung smart tvs had voice recognition recognition
[3:43:33.280 --> 3:43:38.240]  technology that quote may capture voice commands and associated text in order to improve the features
[3:43:38.240 --> 3:43:46.400]  of the system they go on to state again we report this in 2014 they go on to state spoken words
[3:43:46.400 --> 3:43:51.280]  including personal or other sensitive information that information will be among the data captured
[3:43:51.280 --> 3:43:57.360]  and transmitted to a third party through your use of voice recognition turns out that one of
[3:43:57.360 --> 3:44:04.720]  those third parties was the central intelligence agency at least that's implied and suggested
[3:44:04.720 --> 3:44:11.920]  by this vault seven wiki leaks release today so again we would have been called conspiracy
[3:44:11.920 --> 3:44:18.320]  theorists and fake news for reporting on samsung recording people's personal conversations via
[3:44:18.320 --> 3:44:25.440]  microphones embedded in smart tvs we reported on it in 2012 we reported on it in 2014 and in fact
[3:44:25.440 --> 3:44:34.480]  you can go back 11 years to 2006 when we reported that government was going to use these microphones
[3:44:34.480 --> 3:44:40.080]  that would then be connected to the internet via the internet of things to record people's
[3:44:40.080 --> 3:44:47.280]  conversations because as we know and we've known it since the late 90s echelon the nsa has been
[3:44:47.280 --> 3:44:53.680]  storing all this information we've known about it the whole time and in fact we've got a clip
[3:44:53.680 --> 3:45:00.400]  from judge napolitano talking about that he was on fox and friends this morning napolitano
[3:45:00.400 --> 3:45:05.920]  basically laid it out he said that the intelligence community the deep state which buzzfeed says
[3:45:05.920 --> 3:45:12.640]  doesn't exist they're terrified of an investigation into obama spying on trump
[3:45:12.640 --> 3:45:17.680]  not really because of the the current concerns over that the contemporary concerns over that
[3:45:17.680 --> 3:45:24.480]  but because it would reveal the fact that mass surveillance of americans has been taking place
[3:45:25.120 --> 3:45:32.320]  basically for decades now that every single text message every single conversation every
[3:45:32.320 --> 3:45:38.320]  single email is being digitally recorded are they being listened to in real time well william
[3:45:38.320 --> 3:45:42.560]  binney says yes they probably don't have the capability to do that for absolutely everyone
[3:45:42.560 --> 3:45:48.880]  but they're being digitally recorded keywords will flag the system if you say one of the keywords
[3:45:48.880 --> 3:45:55.120]  one of the naughty words they will flag your file and your personal conversations will be
[3:45:55.120 --> 3:46:00.560]  spied on will be cataloged and that's what napolitano was talking about on fox news today
[3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:06.560]  let's go to this clip congress now investigating president trump's explosive claims of being
[3:46:06.560 --> 3:46:11.040]  wiretapped by the obama administration during the race for the white house yep the shocking
[3:46:11.040 --> 3:46:15.440]  allegations sparing hasty denials from the former president and intel officials but
[3:46:15.440 --> 3:46:20.960]  if true what sort of legal trouble could they face we have called in fox news senior judicial
[3:46:20.960 --> 3:46:25.360]  analyst judge andrew napolitano who's got a headline and the headline is the president
[3:46:25.360 --> 3:46:30.400]  united states if he wanted to barack obama he could order a wiretap absolutely if donald
[3:46:30.400 --> 3:46:36.960]  trump wanted to he could surveil anybody that's directly in the fiza statute which after laying
[3:46:36.960 --> 3:46:42.320]  out a lot of detailed procedures about what the nsa is supposed to do says literally not with
[3:46:42.320 --> 3:46:48.960]  standing all of the above the president of the united states may on his own conduct surveillance
[3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:53.920]  or order surveillance of any person in the united states upon the filing of a certification with
[3:46:53.920 --> 3:47:00.320]  the attorney general of course works for the president so the idea that it was illegal for
[3:47:00.320 --> 3:47:06.320]  barack obama to listen to the phone calls and in-person conversations of don trump is wrong
[3:47:06.320 --> 3:47:11.920]  in my view is immoral and profoundly unconstitutional and utterly wrong but it's lawful because
[3:47:11.920 --> 3:47:17.680]  congress has said it is lawful this is power that was given to every president from jimmy carter
[3:47:17.680 --> 3:47:22.880]  up to and including don trump it's still i don't think the power was intended to spy on your political
[3:47:22.880 --> 3:47:27.520]  and well of course not of course not but the language is so broad that it would that it would
[3:47:27.520 --> 3:47:34.080]  authorize it so the last thing in the world the intelligence community wants is an investigation
[3:47:34.080 --> 3:47:41.680]  by the congress which will expose how truly pervasive spying is how the intelligence community
[3:47:41.680 --> 3:47:48.160]  captures everything we say on our uh they keep mobile devices every every time we we touch a key
[3:47:48.160 --> 3:47:52.960]  on our mobile devices on our desktops every conversation on the landline every piece of
[3:47:52.960 --> 3:47:58.560]  data that goes across any fiber in the united states into or out of the united states is captured
[3:47:58.560 --> 3:48:04.720]  digitally by the nsa the nsa is in the military so the president tells the military i need the
[3:48:04.720 --> 3:48:10.560]  conversation trump had with killmeat in the in trump tower he'll have it in a few minutes well
[3:48:10.560 --> 3:48:14.720]  let me ask you this when james clapper came out says i'm national intelligence director if somebody
[3:48:14.720 --> 3:48:20.640]  wiretapped uh the trump tower i would know about it and it didn't happen he actually didn't say it
[3:48:20.640 --> 3:48:27.040]  that way he chose his words very carefully he said if somebody got a faiza warrant for this i would
[3:48:27.040 --> 3:48:34.000]  know about it the president doesn't need a faiza warrant because the statute authorizes the president
[3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:41.600]  to bypass faiza so there you have it and of course yesterday a bunch of people came out including
[3:48:41.600 --> 3:48:46.640]  bob beckel one of the most lonesome individuals out there on fox news and said this is just a
[3:48:46.640 --> 3:48:52.240]  massive conspiracy theory how dare trump say that obama spied on him why doesn't he produce the
[3:48:52.240 --> 3:48:57.280]  evidence all he needs to do is get the faiza record because he would have had to put it through
[3:48:57.280 --> 3:49:03.760]  that process to spy on donald trump well as judge napolitano explained there now he didn't
[3:49:03.760 --> 3:49:09.360]  obama can directly order his attorney general to spy on donald trump directly we know they
[3:49:09.360 --> 3:49:15.200]  spied on general flinn that's completely admitted we know they were spying on trump tower when it
[3:49:15.200 --> 3:49:20.400]  came to paul manifor and his supposed business dealings with the russians so we know they were
[3:49:20.400 --> 3:49:26.800]  spying on trump tower in those two separate instances but it's a massive fake news conspiracy
[3:49:26.800 --> 3:49:33.680]  theory to even suggest that obama may have ordered donald trump himself to be surveilled
[3:49:33.680 --> 3:49:39.280]  they're literally trying to make that argument as if it's you know completely out of the ordinary
[3:49:39.280 --> 3:49:44.880]  that anyone could even suggest this even though they've done it to manifor they did it to general
[3:49:44.880 --> 3:49:51.200]  flinn so now it's not out of the ordinary and in fact later on in that clip judge napolitano went
[3:49:51.200 --> 3:49:56.080]  on to say that you know he does think that obama ordered donald trump to be spied on
[3:49:57.120 --> 3:50:03.280]  and we know that they're keeping all the information anyway that's the point all of our records
[3:50:03.280 --> 3:50:10.480]  are being documented are being cataloged are being warehouse in giant facilities by the nsa not just
[3:50:10.480 --> 3:50:16.640]  the metadata but actual details of emails and conversations and you can go to this article
[3:50:16.640 --> 3:50:22.080]  on inforwards.com investigation into obama spying on trump would reveal mass surveillance of all
[3:50:22.080 --> 3:50:30.000]  americans you can go there and link through i've linked directly to the bbc article from 1999
[3:50:30.000 --> 3:50:36.560]  what 18 years ago where the australian government admits they were part of an nsa-led global
[3:50:36.560 --> 3:50:41.760]  interceptance surveillance program called echelon that could listen to quote every international
[3:50:41.760 --> 3:50:50.480]  telephone call fax email or radio transmission on the planet that was bbc in 1999 and we're
[3:50:50.480 --> 3:50:55.680]  still having this argument about mass surveillance it's incredible we'll be back with the final

[3:55:56.880 --> 3:56:02.640]  very good for their narrative now recall that for the past few weeks they've been spinning these
[3:56:02.640 --> 3:56:07.680]  bomb threats aimed against jewish community centers suggesting that donald trump and his
[3:56:07.680 --> 3:56:12.960]  supporters were to blame for it that kind of died a death on friday when it emerged that
[3:56:13.600 --> 3:56:20.160]  a party's and left wing anti-trump weirdo was responsible for at least some of those threats
[3:56:20.880 --> 3:56:27.040]  huan thompson he in fact had been busy just a couple of days before as i mentioned in the
[3:56:27.040 --> 3:56:33.360]  article about it retweeting hate about me so it's particularly enjoyable to be loathed by such
[3:56:33.360 --> 3:56:43.280]  horrible individuals talk about a narrative fail you had a islam convert anti-trump hysterical
[3:56:43.280 --> 3:56:49.280]  left-wing journalist being exposed as being responsible for the bomb threats against jewish
[3:56:49.280 --> 3:56:54.880]  community centers now it turns out that some of the headstones at jewish cemeteries that are now
[3:56:54.880 --> 3:57:01.440]  being turned over apparently vandalized were in fact that way because of environmental conditions
[3:57:01.440 --> 3:57:08.720]  and poor maintenance so again another narrative fail american mirror reports trump executive order
[3:57:08.720 --> 3:57:13.920]  requires published reports on migrant honor killings president donald trump's new executive
