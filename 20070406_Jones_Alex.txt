[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.320]  Kevin Ryan of Underriding Laboratories went public a few years ago about internal studies
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.240]  that Underriding Laboratories had underwrote, the World Trade Center complex and Building 7,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.720]  internal reports that showed that fire really couldn't have brought down those buildings the
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.080]  way they felt. He got fired. Professor Stephen Jones, award-winning, seen as one of the leaders
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.720]  in the field of different types of fusion. I mean, you talk about right up there at the marquee level,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.200]  just many published papers in the most prestigious journals. He's been public now for a few years on
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.800]  the fact that Building 7 and Tower 1 and 2 are clearly inside jobs and has pioneered amazing
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.080]  research. And he's been attacked by a lot of the disinfo operatives and their fellow travelers and
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.040]  useful idiots and court jesters. But the point is, now Rosie O'Donnell is under massive sustained
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.520]  attack. And they're openly saying on Fox, MSNBC, CNN that she needs to be ruined publicly
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.040]  for questioning the government, that that's un-American, that she hates the troops,
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.360]  she hates America. In truth, we know from behind-the-scenes sources that Rosie is completely
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.960]  freaked out that Rosie is very upset that she's done massive research. The postings,
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.480]  now there's like 10 of them she's done on her blog about 9-11, about Building 7, with links to sites
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.840]  that Professor Jones is involved with and sites that we're involved with. And she's quoted Terror
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:45.040]  Storm on her blog, I mean word for word, on false flag. We know she's done her research.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.720]  I know some things that I'm not at liberty to talk about until she's ready to go public,
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.000]  but so much has happened. And they're trying to fire her, they're trying to get her removed,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.360]  and then this will cause a chilling effect to shut down literally hundreds and hundreds of other
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.520]  prominent scientists, high-level brass in the military. They had two weeks ago a huge secret
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.400]  Hollywood meeting with some top Hollywood people, country singers, TV people. I mean,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.720]  a lot of them at the very highest level about how they should go public. So the battle is joined,
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.920]  and this is one of the top news. This is bigger than Anna Nicole Smith diversion right now.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.200]  This is real news. So we've started DefendRosie.com with a petition there that's gotten so many it
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.240]  crashed today. We're re-uploading it, so you can also send your name to be added to the petition
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.120]  to DefendRosie at InfoWars.com, and we'll get it posted up there. But somebody who knows about
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.640]  persecution is Professor Stephen Jones, and I know he's a winner, so he doesn't like to get
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.560]  into all the things he went with and how he was, and then they didn't claim any academic dishonesty
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.360]  or anything he'd done or any problems. They just said, hey, we'd like to pay you to leave,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.160]  and he did that. And since I brought that up, you've been persecuted, but it hasn't worked,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.480]  and that's a lesson here. You're a hero to this country. Can you just briefly tell us about
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.400]  Professor Stephen E. Jones, your history, recapping for stations that just joined us,
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.160]  and then what happened to you, and then now you've been contacted by Rosie's people.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.240]  And of course, you're such a gentleman, they wanted you on the show, and so you gave them the
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.400]  names of other physicists that have now gone public. Hopefully they'll have you and some of
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.240]  the other physicists on. But Professor, just first off, tell us about yourself and what you've been
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.720]  through, your trials, your tribulations, kind of the Job Chronicle that you went through.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:52.240]  Well, I appreciate that, Alex. Yeah, it's been an interesting life. I just turned 58, so I look back
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:01.680]  over the years, and my career really got started with muon catalyzed fusion as regards research.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:10.480]  And right off the bat, we had an experimental result that defied the theory of muon catalyzed
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.880]  fusion. So then our experimental results were suspect, and I remember being roundly criticized
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:26.400]  by a professor at UC Berkeley, actually. I won't name him, but anyway, it turns out we were right.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.760]  But it took other work and experimenters coming forward and saying, look, these muon catalyzed
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.680]  fusion results are correct. And so I've been... And I mean, now even mainline encyclopedias cite
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.560]  you as the pioneer of that. Now let's be clear. Right after you broke that, the Dish Info came
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.280]  out with more blown up results by others that couldn't be duplicated. You showed very small
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.480]  energy increases, but the point is you proved it's real. It's now confirmed that it's real.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.520]  The problem is just capturing it. And small, right. Now that gets us over into metal catalyzed fusion,
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.440]  which both of these areas are called cold fusion. That's why there's a confusion there,
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.880]  con fusion. But yeah, in the metal catalyzed fusion, again, we had controversial results
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.480]  as far as the scientific community, but they have... Our results have been verified.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.480]  And the problem, as you mentioned, is that it's just small. The effect is a small one,
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.520]  but it's very real. And we are working on some experiments to beef up, to increase the yield.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.720]  I'm very interested in, of course, energy in general, getting us off the oil as much as we
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.800]  possibly can for various reasons. But fusion is very promising in that regard. It's just also
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.240]  very difficult to control fusion in terms of energy. You've also pioneered some other areas
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.480]  of science. Well, the metal catalyzed fusion and the muon catalyzed fusion, I was a principal
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.520]  investigator for the Department of Energy, actually, because I wrote the proposal and
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.360]  people joined me. By the way, there's a little... Well, there's some stories. There's always
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:18.080]  stories. There was a group that tried to take away from me. That is, they wanted to be the leader.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:25.040]  And this was actually a fellow at Los Alamos National Lab who's now become a friend. But at
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.800]  the time, he was trying to take the... He said, you know, we would like to lead this project.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.840]  And I talked to... I was at the Idaho National Engineering Lab at the time, and they said,
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:45.040]  no, you wrote the proposal. You don't have to let them take the lead on it. You have that
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:53.600]  right as having originated the research. So it worked out in the end. I did retain the leadership.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.960]  Well, I would say that, I mean, despite your pioneering energy developments,
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.600]  I think you're pioneering on exposing 9-11. Well, that's been quite an experience there.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.680]  That is just amazing, the amount of flak I've had. I mean, I had some flak on muon and then metal
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.480]  catalyzed fusion, but nothing like the flak I've had on 9-11 research. But, you know, again, it's
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:22.880]  the same thing. I have these observations. I'm not just going to deny them just because somebody
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:31.520]  thinks they're unpopular. I'm not a US hater. I love the United States. And, gosh, that's offensive
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.800]  to me when people say you must be a US hater to talk about these things. Well, in fact, it's the
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.440]  very people destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution that is the heart and soul of this
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:47.440]  republic. They're the ones that carried out 9-11. Well, that's the problem. Yeah, that's surely the
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:53.520]  indication I get from these data. And, you know, my area, Alex, is looking primarily at the hard
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.720]  physical evidence. And I would like to talk about some of that, which I will be talking also at the
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.720]  meeting there in Austin. That's right. I can't wait for you to get to meet my wife, hopefully,
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.520]  sometime on Saturday and Sunday while you're here. I can take you out to dinner. There's going to be
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.680]  a big event that we haven't even talked about yet, folks, next weekend, not this weekend,
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.560]  but next weekend in Austin. But before we run out of time, because I'm sitting down rabbit
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.600]  trails, Professor, let's go back now. And you gave me some interesting news. I know a few weeks
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.520]  ago we had tried to give your info to Rosie's people. I'm not saying that's what triggered
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:34.320]  this, but you did get contacted. Tell us about this exciting development. Well, sure. So a person
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:42.560]  from Rosie's team contacted me by email. And, of course, I had heard just that very morning that
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.400]  Rosie had gone public. It was on a blog or something. But anyway, she had talked about her
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:56.880]  concerns about 9-11 and voiced this interest in having a physicist on her show. Well, there are a
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:03.360]  few of us now physicists that have come out and studied and written and talked about 9-11 as an
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.920]  inside job based on evidence. And so I wrote back to them and said, I would be glad to appear. And
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:19.120]  I named two other physicists who I trust now who could also appear. And tell folks the names of
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.680]  those individuals. You bet. The other physicists, and both of these have written in the journal of
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.440]  911studies.com. So I'll put a plug in for that journal, because it represents solid research.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:39.280]  And these are Professor David Griscombe, G-R-I-S-T-O-M. He's a fellow of the American
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.520]  Physical Society. I was so pleased to see him. We're not going to find the Marvin Martian
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:56.640]  proponents over there. No, no, you won't. Oh, dear. The other one is Greg Jenkins, a young PhD,
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.680]  lives out in the Washington, DC area, part of the DC 9-11 truth group out there. Very,
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:10.080]  very good scientist as well. So they contacted you and she's been back from vacation in a week
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.800]  and a half. And they're saying that they want to get you on the show? That's what they said. Now,
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.320]  of course, they said something like, we need to get permission from the, I don't know,
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.840]  broadcast or ABC or something like that. So it's still tentative. Well, exactly. And that's where
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.080]  I can bring in some new information. But I almost talked about this yesterday, but I got to be
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.560]  careful. I can't let out too much. Yeah, sure. But I'm going to think about it and try to form my
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.440]  words. When we get back from break, I'm going to add a little bit more to this, just a little bit
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.640]  more. And I'm just going to leave it at that, because I don't want to endanger some of the
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.840]  other big things that are going to be happening. If somebody would have told me 10, 15 years ago,
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.320]  I'd be doing this now, I'd tell them they were nuts. Do you ever feel the same way? Me too. I'm
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.360]  just amazed too. But to me, it's the data. Oh, man, we got some data this week, Alex, that just
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.080]  blew me away. And the student I was working with was sitting there, wow.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.240]  I'll talk to you about that. I don't mind talking to them about that. Well, I guarantee you that
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.600]  they don't want to have an award-winning physicist like yourself or other physicists up there. Tell
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:22.240]  us a little bit about these other two physicists. Well, let's see. Greg Jenkins is a young PhD,
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:32.160]  University of Maryland, as I recall, at College Park out there. And he's written a paper. Actually,
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:38.320]  he took on this, what do you call it, Star Wars beams idea. And he went through and did calculations
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:45.280]  and showed that that idea just won't work in terms of energy balance. In other words,
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:53.440]  it takes too much energy and power to just run. Well, also, you would visually see the event.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.200]  Stay there. We'll be right back.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.520]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:11.040]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere,
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.720]  which are then readily absorbed into the body. Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.840]  complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.280]  poisoning. Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.680]  good iodine. This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.120]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:45.920]  stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets. Order the official potassium iodate for only

[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:06.240]  Hi, Ted Anderson for Midas Resources. It's April 3rd, 2007. Gold is at 662.80 and one ounce gold
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:13.840]  coins can be purchased for 686.25, 345.68 for half ounce, and 172.84 for quarter ounce coins.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:21.760]  That's 686.25, 345.68, and 172.84. We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.920]  than tax collections. Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.680]  That's right. The United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.400]  the long-term fiscal outlook document clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.840]  out of control. This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to ensure
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:45.280]  bank deposits. Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S. dollar are inevitable pressures facing
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:52.560]  the economy. Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237. The U.S. GAO has spelled it out

[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.400]  if you will not keep my commandments by violating my covenant, I will bring upon you sudden terror.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:15.840]  Just as prophesized, the judgments upon America have begun. Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.800]  Revelation's first seal. In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white

[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:03.760]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.240]  a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.880]  It affects about 50 million Americans. That's one in four adults. Because many people have
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.200]  high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.880]  silent killer. At researchherbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being. As your online

[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.560]  Don't worry. This show is documented. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.400]  You know, I hate to give attention to this, but it has to be addressed occasionally. We're
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.680]  only going to spend a minute or two more on it. Then we're going to get into the new hard data
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.880]  that's come out. This is a novice, kind of a hobby. You know, since I was a kid, I looked into
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.160]  Star Wars program, SDI lasers. My dad worked on it in college. I've interviewed Bowman, who headed
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:42.160]  up the program, and many others. And a laser that could even, you know, say shoot through 10 feet of
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.040]  steel, that would be so bright it would blind you. It'd be like the sun suddenly, you know,
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:53.600]  huge bright flash. Something that would destroy those steel buildings. Well, the calculations have
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:02.320]  been done, and you're talking about the solar-type eruption power. And again, no planes at the towers.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:09.040]  I have friends and family that saw the first plane. This is the type of disinfo that the
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.520]  government and their minions are putting out to discredit real hard research. And we expect them
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.680]  to do this. You know, it's come out now in the Kennedy assassination that they had all those CIA
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:24.160]  and FBI people inside Garrison's deal feeding him with disinfo. This is gonna happen. Professor
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.480]  Jones is the real McCoy, and that's why he's being attacked. Finish up with Marvin the Martian
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:35.600]  space beam, and then let's get into the new real data. Okay. Thanks, Alex. Yeah, so if you look at
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.800]  the Journal of 9-11 Studies, I always encourage people as they get into these questions to go to
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:48.560]  the journal, because there we have peer-reviewed papers. And Greg Jenkins in the February issue
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:56.160]  has a paper entitled, The Overwhelming Implausibility of Using Directed Energy Beams to
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:02.320]  Demolish the World Trade Center. And he goes through the fundamental reasons using physics
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:09.840]  arguments to demolish this theory that, you know, Star Wars beams would be used. And he did a good
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.640]  job. It's thorough, and it could be answered if anybody wanted to, but boy, they'd have to
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.640]  come up with some very good explanations. For instance, he points out that the power
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:28.640]  required to knock down a tower would be at least five times the total power output of the entire
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:36.960]  Earth. And you just can't, there's just absolutely no way. You know, with a power requirement like
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:42.800]  that, you can't drive any type of weapon. Plus, from space, you've got the atmosphere to go
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:50.640]  through. You've got diffraction problems, clouds, all sorts of things that would tend to interrupt
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.360]  the beam. Plus, it would be at the tippy top that it would start. Now, I think we've all seen the
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:02.320]  towers. They do not start disintegrating at the tippy top. It's down several floors, you know,
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.440]  15 floors for the North Tower, about 30 floors down for the South Tower. So, you know, there
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.240]  wouldn't be a disintegration. The whole thing, if there was enough power, if they had a Death Star
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:18.400]  out there with Darth Vader piloting it, I mean, it would simply melt and then ooze down. And that's
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:24.880]  another point. Yeah, there's so many, as you look at these, the physics of it, again, and of course,
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:30.400]  that's what we did with the official conspiracy theory too, Alex, is we looked at their arguments
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:36.560]  and, you know, we can quite easily say, no, the buildings will not collapse like that
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.680]  because you have to conserve energy, you have to conserve momentum, and frankly, you've got a lot
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.880]  of, well, hundreds of thousands of tons of steel and concrete in the way. You can't get them to just
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.320]  fall at free fall speed without getting that material out of the way. So, you know, these are
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:20:01.360]  fundamental physics arguments, and we apply the laws of physics to various hypotheses. And if
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.920]  something comes along, you know, a Star Wars hypothesis, we'll apply the laws of physics,
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:12.880]  as Greg Jenkins did in detail in his paper, photographs and so on. He did a very thorough
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:18.800]  job, I'd say. And we do the same thing with the official conspiracy theory. We demolish these
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.920]  theories because they don't stand up to the laws of physics. It's really quite straightforward.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:32.560]  Dr. Griscombe did a paper like that too. He wrote, Manuel Garcia in Counterpunch,
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:41.680]  you may have heard about that, wrote a pro-official story paper in Counterpunch, and David Griscombe
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.920]  just got tired of it, and he said, look, this paper's full of holes. And so he went through,
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:52.640]  and that, of course, was in response to another physicist. So this is good. David Griscombe then
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:21:00.960]  has joined our side, our way of approaching and applying science to the study of the
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.640]  destruction of the World Trade Center. 9-11 is, and we'll get back on,
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.560]  talk about some of the new data that you've discovered, but 9-11 is just getting bigger
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.440]  and bigger. It is becoming a central issue because we've continued to push it, and because
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:20.720]  the enemies continue to use it as the pretext for wars and domestic police states. Where do you see
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:28.400]  it going? Well, you know, I see this taking off as more and more people join us, Alex, yourself,
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:34.320]  and people out there handing out DVDs and literature. They're doing a lot too. This
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.880]  is spreading, like I say, I think it's spreading like wildfire at the grassroots level. I agree.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.160]  Professor Stephen Jones. Dr. Jones, stay with us. We're going to come back, get into some of
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:48.320]  the new data you've gotten on the controlled demolition, and then we'll take calls at 1-800-2599-231.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:56.800]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:09.600]  is not liberalism or conservatism but globalism. Globalists are concerned with what's good for
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.480]  big business and the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people. The only
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.920]  antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism. Start reading the Nationalist Times each month.

[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:12.560]  has proven itself time-tested. Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardavide.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.440]  In our mind there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore. This basic tenet of yeast in
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.520]  the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80 percent of the diseases that we see. When
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.760]  we do our program you know herbal formulas like Cardavide and you see someone who could barely
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:31.120]  walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later we know we're doing something right.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:36.160]  It's a well thought out formula. I mean the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:41.280]  time and liver function is dead on. You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on on
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.600]  heart problems and circulation problems it'll work on other problems as well. For more information

[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.760]  All right we did get the petition back up and working. There's thousands and thousands
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:34.480]  of people that have signed. This went up late last night and we started the website defendrosy.com.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:39.280]  It's going absolutely gangbusters. Keep pushing it. Get it out to everybody. Get that url out to
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.280]  everybody. Get the article Paul Watson wrote out to everybody. This is a call to action. You're
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:51.200]  doing a fabulous job. Let's redouble our efforts. At the same time O'Reilly has been plugging this
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:57.360]  abc news poll we learned against uh rosie and he was winning it but now people learned of it
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.560]  and it's neck and neck it's like seven thousand something votes for rosie seven thousand something
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.520]  for o'reilly and the neocon websites are all linked to it saying vote her down that you know
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:13.680]  that she you know that she's bad and that bill o'reilly's good we need to defeat it bill has seven
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:20.240]  thousand two hundred and sixty six she has seven thousand ninety five um two thousand one hundred
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:26.240]  and twenty five so they find her annoying get up there and vote now we and you get well how do you
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:32.080]  find the link prison planet dot com and again we we never talked about anna nicole smith we never
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.320]  talked about oj simpson we never talked about michael jackson we don't talk about hollywood
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:42.080]  stars and these people we're talking about this because she's got courage she's gone public
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.440]  we know behind the scenes and i'll go ahead and talk about this and go back to professor steven
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:54.560]  jones and your calls we know behind the scenes she's very upset she's done her research and uh
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:00.080]  she has i'm just going to say this been meeting with 9-11 victims and she's been reaching out to
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.520]  experts and she's known about this for a while and she's been doing her homework just like charlie
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:12.000]  sheen did and she just can't keep her mouth shut if you've got any soul and please don't judge her
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.800]  for some of the things in her personal life none of us are perfect she's silly and she's been
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.800]  ignorant in the past but she's got guts and guts is enough and i mean how many of you have done
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.440]  things that aren't too good how many of you been wrong about politics and issues
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:31.360]  she knows about the new world order now she knows about globalism she's gotten the big picture okay
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.400]  i actually have talked to three different people that know her that have met with her
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.920]  she's been given my material she knew about my material last week she quoted terror storm folks
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.880]  you know the part about false flags she quotes the script the voiceover of terror storm for a
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:55.440]  full paragraph i i'm not going to say too much about it it's just that i know some of the really
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.680]  riveting and important stuff but this is such an important fight they're trying to set this
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.840]  chilling effect professor jones can you speak in defense of rosie or add your point because you've
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.480]  gone through being blackballed being attacked being demonized how important it is to stand
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.080]  up for whistleblowers or for people that have the type of courage that rosie's had
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:19.600]  it's very important alex and you know i've been on i voted on those polls myself and i get to
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:28.240]  support rosie of course and i'd be glad to be on her show if i whatever i can do to help bring out
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:35.840]  these uh truth i had a professor yesterday actually here tell me that my being well put on
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.960]  leave was it had a chilling effect that was his word too a chilling effect on some of the people
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:47.840]  around here who've been interested in the same subject so yeah it there's that it does seem to
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:54.960]  be uh definitely a concerted effort when somebody stands out and speaks out they're knocking them
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.840]  down well at least they have charlie sheen too exactly i mean at least they haven't locked you
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:07.120]  up like they did galileo for seven years sorry go back to uh to charlie no no you're right there
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:13.680]  i'm i'm really glad that i'm able to keep researching and publishing and uh it's
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.880]  it's what i like to do of course is to study things to get to the bottom of
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:24.480]  of uh matters using hard physical evidence wherever possible well you know now they're
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:30.080]  talking about outlawing saying global warming isn't real because the the majority of the real
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.520]  climatologist and ice court specialist and uh folks that study the arctic are saying that this
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:41.120]  isn't true that carbon dioxide and that this conclusive comes after the warming and that
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:46.960]  plants breathe more of it and it creates more oxygen more plankton more fish and that actually
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:52.640]  we are in an oxygen poor environment compared to what we've been previously in that carbon dioxide
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:59.760]  is not a pollutant yeah yeah that's another issue it's uh you know it's it's time for scientists to
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:05.600]  realize that when they speak out it's going to make a difference but we've we've got to stand
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:11.520]  up and speak out even if we get some uh opposition you have to expect that i mean my my greatest hero
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:20.720]  alex is is jesus you know he had a lot of opposition and uh uh this quick story comes
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.280]  to mind if i could have a friend of mine was talking about jesus saying well once you scribes
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.360]  Pharisees hypocrites and someone in class raised their hand and said wait a minute that's not
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:34.960]  christian that's not christian to attack uh you know these are the nation's leaders how could
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:40.800]  how could anybody do that and the teacher pausing he said well this is jesus christ himself he
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:49.760]  defines what is christian you know so um i feel amazing yeah so you know we do need to speak out
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:55.440]  and it's time for scientists uh to and we're realizing that you know there's been some
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:02.720]  stifling and i'm so glad to see people speaking out like rosie and like professor griscombe and
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:08.560]  jenkins and others now kevin ryan and so on speaking out on 9-11 you know there's hundreds
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.360]  now well look at how they put charlie sheen through the ringer uh they've called for mark cuban
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:19.520]  funding loose change final cut uh to be sent to prison uh in fact on msnbc on scarborough country
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:24.640]  they said they wanted rosie to be murdered yeah wasn't that something that guy and live i don't
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:32.240]  know why they didn't uh get him prosecuted you know he had to have to have some accountability
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.880]  for i bet money if you or i went on national tv and said somebody needs to be killed we'd get a
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:44.160]  visit from the cops oh yeah we'd be right away putting the lock up absolutely now now you've got
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:50.560]  some new developments uh here yeah i want i would like to talk about these a bit um i alluded in
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:55.520]  back in february to some of these then at the arizona conference but so these are the medic
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:03.040]  metal getting my tongue twisted here a little bit my uh metal spheres that are found in the world
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:09.920]  trade center dust now others have noticed this in particular usgs talks about these metal spheres but
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:16.240]  i found one uh back in january that was a millimeter it's about a sixteenth of an inch
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:25.040]  with my naked eye now we have gone in um got some cooperation of a lab with an electron microscope
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:31.600]  to look at these spheres and to look at the elements inside of these spheres this is uh
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:39.440]  just amazing first of all to form a droplet alex it requires a liquid i mean these these are
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.600]  many of these are nearly perfect spheres as you look i'm looking at them here on my screen
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:51.040]  from the electron microscope so you form a liquid and then surface tension pulls it into a sphere
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:57.280]  and then as this material travels through the air metal it's hardened and retains that spherical
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:03.920]  shape so the shape alone is telling us with the metal content so you're finding previously molten
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:10.960]  spheres that's exactly right but you've got the point previously molten metal and we're looking
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:19.600]  inside comparing the contents with world trade center steel with aluminum alloy and with uh
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:27.520]  thermate residues thermate also produces these uh spheres i have electron micro photographs of those
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:34.320]  as well so that in other words photos with an electron microscope so you have these spheres
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.960]  formed you know of course we've talked about thermate and a lot of people have looked at
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:45.680]  that interview you and i had by the way alex on thermate well this adds to it so in the dust itself
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:52.960]  we have this information and you know i just have to thank janette mckinley for saving that dust and
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:34:02.880]  letting me have a sample of it because the origin of these spheres i mean it's like locked up
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:09.280]  information how did these form where did you come from well you you interrogate them using what's
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:15.680]  called edx you look at an individual sphere you say what are you made of what's your composition
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:24.480]  where did you come from and using x-ray methods then it tells you and it's hard to explain over
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:30.880]  the radio i think maybe it's better if i reserve the actual content doesn't it just create a
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:36.480]  spectrum of a graph of the different elements and combinations that it's made up of exactly
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:44.240]  okay what do we what did you find then okay i'll tell you some but i want to i want to hold most
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:49.760]  of this for the uh you know ut austin i understand you also want to have it all
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.240]  published and put it out correctly but just just just go okay all right i'll give you the bottom
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:35:02.880]  line in these spheres uh we are seeing of course iron we expect that but but already though you
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:10.080]  know that's over 2700 fahrenheit to melt this iron in addition alex we see aluminum
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:20.160]  um significant quantities of aluminum and sulfur and you know when i saw this uh these data i just
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:26.800]  thought man that's just what we expected we see the same elements in the spheres from thermate
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:33.280]  by the way uh a little unbelievable so this is i mean you again you look at what can cause
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:41.520]  uh the steel to melt and the right and the clear 45 degree angle cuts then you find thermate then
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:48.880]  you find out that there is the uh the explosive type used for cutting patented then you get
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:54.320]  multiple samples from different sites around the country uh and and you do have the custody chain
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:36:01.840]  on that then that matches uh what your hypothesis was in other words it's all just dovetailing and
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.960]  it just continues and and then and then you get the video from multiple choppers and on the ground
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:15.440]  of molten metal pouring out like water out of the towers and then meanwhile fox news says
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:20.400]  that fire melts steel they don't say what degrees well well they can say it weakens it
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:27.920]  but it certainly doesn't turn it into aerosolized globules that's exactly right these are tiny
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:37.120]  droplets of the order of 10 uh 50 microns of course the one i saw was a thousand microns a
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:44.160]  millimeter across so you get all sizes doesn't that tend to take some type of gaseous injection
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.320]  during the formation that's spewing these out i mean i mean even if you saw steel brought to
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:54.880]  a melting point uh you know in a founder you normally don't see huge spews of uh of little
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:00.880]  circular uh goblets flying out i mean does that fit in with the explosive reaction well it does
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:08.320]  let me point this out with thermate you can tailor this stuff ultra fine is explosive and then you
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:15.440]  get lots of little droplets what we found is we used uh fine powders of aluminum and iron oxide
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:23.520]  we added potassium permanganate and that gave us a lot of droplets in the air too so let me mention
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.720]  one of the things we did recently alex and you know things are just coming along so rapidly if
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:37.280]  you take ordinary thermite uh then the you get molten steel at a white hot temperature over 2700
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:44.320]  fahrenheit and it flows and i've got a picture of this and then it if you uh let it drop on
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:49.760]  fan typically is what we do in our demos here you can pick up the white yellow white hot
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:59.200]  iron the residue with tongs because i mean it solidifies at at around 2700 fahrenheit
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:06.880]  now the next thing we did then is to add sulfur i said let's uh add a lot of silver we put about
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:14.320]  15 sulfur in with the thermite now it becomes thermate and just as expected
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:22.480]  um this stuff stays liquid so even at orange hot temperature it's still liquid now that's a very
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:28.160]  important point because i've had well for instance judy wood you know so well how could you get the
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:35.520]  iron to flow at orange hot the answer is with sulfur added it's a good question but but you
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:41.600]  know there is an answer and the answer is that when sulfur is added to iron it makes a eutectic
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:47.920]  and it flows and by the way you have this confirmed by fema in this report saying we had
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:55.040]  very unusual sulfidation that's exactly right good point alex i like to bring that in too wpi
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.600]  did a measurement on the steel they found sulfidation high temperature sulfidation and
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:04.320]  they couldn't explain where that sulfur came from in their paper you know they published that and
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:10.640]  said well here it is but we do not explain these high temperatures and them the sulfur attacking
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:15.360]  the steel in this way and doing sulfidation which weakens the steel of course and melts it
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:21.120]  and so all of these all of these facts are confirming very strongly the use of
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:28.960]  thermite the other point there is that nift you know should have looked for high temperature
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:34.960]  accelerants this is a crime scene it involved fire the code the nspa 921 code requires that
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:40.720]  they look for a thermite it spelled out thermite look for it well they didn't they said well we
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:45.360]  didn't look for thermite residues in the steel and i'm saying well you know that's part of the
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:53.040]  requirement that's the code and hopefully they will correct their inaction on that i shouldn't
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:40:00.480]  be the only one that has to not that i'm the only one but i mean it should be nist and fbi doing
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:07.360]  this setting this it's a crime scene and and there's definitely now evidence for for the use
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:14.000]  of uh alumino thermics as we call it so the science continues to concur and and stack up
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.360]  this is a matter and of course you'll obviously have video photo slides and be able to show
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:25.760]  photographs and that's coming up next weekend april 14th and 15th not this weekend and two days
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:31.360]  but uh the week after here in austin texas the last time we had just a three-hour event
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:38.960]  uh that i spoke at at the university of texas a few months ago and a thousand people showed up
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.840]  they had to turn away hundreds i've been asking how many this holds and i believe
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:51.920]  we're going to have uh the gentleman on from pnac project for new american citizens dot org
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:41:00.080]  that is a takeoff on pnac project for new american uh century and this is going to be
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:08.320]  starting next saturday at 11 a.m going until uh in the evening and then it's going to be on sunday
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:16.720]  from uh 10 a.m until the evening and i've been asked to emcee it but i already had to do
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.720]  interviews with mbc news that's coming then for two-hour documentary they're going to kill two
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:25.040]  bars of one stone also interview jones and so there'll be a few emcees and i don't like to hog
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:29.680]  things and so i'll be speaking saturday night uh have they told you when you're speaking professor
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:37.760]  jones uh yeah saturday evening also in fact i think i follow you which is uh i i did that in
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.600]  chicago you remember you're gonna do a great job what are you talking about well thanks it's hard
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:47.760]  it's hard to follow i'm done at 7 10 then so you'll be on at uh right after seven probably
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:55.600]  7 30 or so right after and uh folks this is the university of texas rm um birdine 106 dean
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:01.120]  keaton university we're going to get a banner up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:09.360]  with this uh it's pnac citizens you know just pna citizens dot org and it's sponsored by brave
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:17.520]  new books of austin protest the empire 5 p.m at the uh main mall ut tower so i guess it goes late
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:23.600]  on saturday ends early on on sunday uh and i'm going to scurry off and do my sunday syndicated
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:29.280]  radio show so it's going to be jam-packed come all and uh please especially come for the protest
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:34.160]  demonstration uh that's going to be on sunday even if you can't make it into the hall i don't
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:39.600]  know how many of this hall holds but i've got a sneaking suspicion with even really no promotion
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:45.040]  that it's going to be gangbusters so i can't wait to see professor jones here in austin texas deep
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.360]  in the heart of the resistance coming up next week we're going to jam in some phone calls for
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:53.040]  the professor on the other side maybe keep them five minutes the next hour then we got william
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:43:05.520]  rodriguez joining us and the pnac boys as well it's here after a year in production and traveling

[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:41.920]  go ahead hello alex a couple of things one i wanted to mention that on the john stewart show
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:49.040]  on comedy central earlier this week um he spent a very serious possibly two minutes uh going through
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:55.840]  a false flag terrorism and saying that it's clear that these false flag events have taken place
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.240]  in the middle east and that makes me wonder what else has gone on that is wait a minute wait a
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:06.960]  minute see that's another huge giant headline what day did john stewart say this i'm pretty
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:13.040]  sure it was monday night alex monday night hold on that's another massive see folks that we're
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:18.320]  missing everything and he was serious that's a comedy show but he didn't crack a smile during
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:22.560]  that and it was like two minutes long so it was like during his little comment section yes see
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:27.120]  that's a massive headline john stewart goes public on government sponsored terror or on false flag i'm
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:31.760]  getting paul watson on right now we did this with the building seven when a listener alerted us the
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:36.560]  bbc had to report it paul uh we've got a caller and he sounds credible just like last time a caller
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:41.360]  told us about bbc reporting building seven and fallen before it did we just got a call saying
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:46.880]  john stewart did two minutes on false flag terror monday night you gotta find that uh paul what's
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.480]  your what's the main email for folks who can help find it and get it to you
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:57.520]  watson at prison planet dot com or they can post it in the general comment section to help
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:02.880]  you okay get on it right now launch launch the operation i'll see you okay sorry go ahead
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:07.920]  what one other thing just uh hello yeah yeah professor jones was commenting would you like
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:13.520]  to comment on this sir i think it's great there's all these revelations it's hard to keep up with
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:20.240]  go ahead one other quick thing alex there has been some pictures posted about a week ago roughly on
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:26.320]  the rents website that showed cars and and fire trucks and all that sort of thing along fdr drive
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:31.040]  which is quite a distance from the world trade center complex and these things were melted and
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:36.000]  melted in weir's ways and i'm not trying to promote any kind of a bean technology but i'm wondering if
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.320]  you guys have seen that in any comment yeah i've seen that and and i've seen explanations for it
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:46.880]  professor jones excellent question and there is a paper that two papers in the journal of 911
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:53.440]  studies that talk about this and show that this is consistent with thermate damage to cars and
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:59.040]  then later these cars being towed to fdr drive because that's where they were going to be put on
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:04.880]  a yeah that's the intel i've seen is this is days after and the streets obviously for months had
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:11.280]  dust and they've hauled them out you can see that and but then again there's a lot of disinfo
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.760]  going on yeah be careful about that but there's some good papers that discuss that thoroughly
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:23.200]  in the journal look for james gwerley and uh what's the name david or no greg jenkins those
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:27.600]  two papers talk about professor jones is going to be here in austin texas next week we've got the
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:31.920]  young men coming on right now they'll talk to professor jones and then i don't want to twist
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:36.320]  his arm too bad i almost want to keep him on willy rodriguez so we can take calls then but

[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:39.200]  joining us the big event coming up next week at ut austin which we're going to find out how many
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.960]  people it really seats they better try to get a bigger room i mean you could probably get 3000
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:46.480]  people in there i mean if i don't even promote something and a thousand show up and they turn
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.240]  away a couple hundred this is going to be a three-ring circus but i don't want that to
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.600]  discourage you from coming because they got a bunch of other rooms i'm told and we'll give you
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:57.680]  the tales william rodriguez will be with us for the rest of the hour we're almost out of time
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:03.200]  uh but uh real fast let's get to kyle in iowa you're on with professor stephen jones go ahead
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:12.000]  go ahead uh am i on the air yes you are oh good okay um wow okay uh i just want to make one um
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.720]  point uh and i don't know if i've ever heard you uh make this point before but for a lot of people
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:24.160]  who doubt that um fire could have melted these things i want to point out one thing these engines
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:30.240]  that are in these uh airplanes if they're made out of steel how do they make these transcontinental
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:36.160]  flights over and over with little or no maintenance that's a good point and also even
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:43.920]  your wood-burning stove and uh kerosene stove jet fuel is a type of kerosene i have a kerosene stove
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:49.120]  and it's a steel and i'm not worried about that puppy melting you know anytime soon so i know you
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:55.280]  raise a good point even jet engines don't don't melt okay right well um i i've been doing some
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:00.240]  research on this myself and i noticed that uh that it was saying that on an open air burn
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:06.560]  actually of uh or an uncontrolled burn of jet fuel it's roughly going to be uh between five
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:13.840]  and 600 degrees fahrenheit yeah when we say 1800 that is the maximum with air injected in a turbo
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:19.600]  condition okay or like liquid oxygen or something like that professor you want to comment on that
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:26.640]  yeah those numbers are reasonable and remember to melt steel would require uh right around
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:33.120]  2800 fahrenheit fahrenheit 1538 centigrade is typical for structural steel so you're nowhere
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:39.120]  near the temperatures and nist to their credit does point that out but then how do they explain
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:43.280]  this molten metal seem pouring out of the south tower just minutes before it's collapsed well
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:48.880]  they're hard put they do talk about aluminum and i've shown that aluminum is silvery
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:54.480]  i and others and but now it also curls quickly and flakes and turns white this stuff staying
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:01.200]  yellow for its own drop down a long drop absolutely yellow and red and then also now
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:09.120]  we've got these droplets uh in in the dust mingled in with the dust these spherical metal droplets
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:14.720]  that have solidified man that that just contains so much information it's like because it proves
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:20.960]  it is an aluminum you've got the you've got the steel droplets it is yeah now it's not i wouldn't
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:26.000]  call it steel either although i understand the term alex but these are it's a mixture it's an
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:32.560]  alloy it's it's what you see in thermate residue which gives you droplets also so that's what i'll
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:36.880]  be showing at ut is well it's alloy the proper term i mean it's a mixture of things it's a
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:42.560]  mixture of metals it's fairly uh it's what you it's what you get with thermate you get these
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:47.840]  droplets that form and i'm talking about thermate with potassium permanganate at it i'll show you why
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:55.920]  later in ut austin but anyway the point is you get these droplets and they contain the information
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:02.880]  of where they came from as you look at these then and interrogate with x-rays well this is
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:08.400]  unbelievable i can't wait to videotape your presentation and get it up on the web immediately
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:13.360]  once you get to town and give the presentation next saturday night professor god bless you and

[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:30.880]  i would uh invite physicists to come and see this i mean i'd look at this as a scientific uh
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:35.280]  colloquium i'll be a little more technical on this one than i have at least in part
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:40.240]  because i want to get into these data and show the spectra well you won't have me interrupting

[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:24.880]  shotgun with him for this segment gonna be matt daten another amazing individual who heads up
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:31.520]  a student group on ut that's had i don't know 10 20 big demonstrations with hundreds of people
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:36.000]  had an event that i was hit that had over a thousand nine hundred in there hundreds that
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.600]  tried to get in uh and got covered by the newspapers and tv and stuff they've had other
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:46.160]  events with 400 500 people they've got one coming up next week with steven jones webster tarpley
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:52.560]  myself and others i'm gonna be emceeing part of it and speaking that's all coming up i was thinking
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:59.680]  i'm trying to get william but he's so busy uh my big concern is that i'm told the hall only holds
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:05.760]  550 people at their side rooms next to it that i guess they might be able to put tvs in um matt
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.080]  i'm going to tell you right now and i know you guys got this hall book before you have the other
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.480]  events so you didn't know how big this would get not tooting my horn but if this show is promoting
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.120]  it with all our great listeners out there that really do the promoting uh matt daten with uh
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.080]  project for new american citizens uh what are we going to do here because if we do promote this
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.840]  it's going to go supernova but then if we say oh it's going to go supernova then people won't
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.920]  come because they think they won't be able to get in regardless someday there's the demonstration
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:38.400]  down uh town so everybody should come to that bottom line and there's gonna be some other
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:43.360]  events around town but matt fill us in on what's happening okay well uh thanks for having me on
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:50.480]  alex and yeah i mean the biggest room that we could get um was this was this uh berdyne 106
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:56.960]  room um the room that we had you in which was uh the the ballroom we could not get that booked
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:02.640]  that that gets booked way in advance we just lucked out when we got you in there um so what
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.640]  we're going to try and do is you know we're going to have the conference is going to be two days
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.600]  i have a feeling people aren't going to want to stay the entire day for both days so that's going
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:16.880]  to hopefully help us out with uh the numbers and then we're going to have a you know some spillover
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.720]  rooms in order to um either try and broadcast live what's happening in the main room or if
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:28.640]  we have some of our speakers who are willing to maybe give a another lecture in that um those
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:34.480]  other rooms or in that other room that we have so how big is the other room um it'll be probably
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:43.040]  around another hundred or a couple hundred okay so i mean you know what's going to happen always
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.800]  people are going to show up and ut is pretty nice at least their staff are they're probably

[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:37.440]  presentation he gave at the 9-11 neocon agenda symposium in june of last year shot with i believe
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:43.440]  five cameras two of its our shots than three other cameras he had and uh just an amazing
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:49.920]  presentation in fact i meant to edit it together and put it out never had time i'm glad he did
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:54.560]  we're now carrying that and it's available uh on the online shopping cart at info wars
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:06:01.840]  dot com he is the last uh civilian survivor uh of uh the towers he went up with the key
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:07.040]  to open the uh different uh landings and doorways with the police and firemen
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:12.640]  and uh he's just an amazing individual and oh i meant to send this to the network for when he came
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:17.440]  on i forgot to send the clip i'll go find the youtube youtube club and i get it up to the
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:21.920]  network because this is an example all over tv where he goes when he gets ready to say and then
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:27.920]  there were explosions with bombs going off they cut it and go there were explosions and then they
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:34.560]  cut and say then the plane caused explosion very deceptive and um again just an amazing
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:40.160]  individual and we're honored to have him uh william thanks for coming on thank you for having
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:44.960]  me uh that's very important that you mentioned that because i i found that clip because of the
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:51.040]  amount of uh presentations that i did on september 11th last year i haven't been able to digitize
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:56.160]  everything and when i saw that i was like so appalled by the manipulation and the editing of
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:03.600]  the content uh just to feed what what their views are you see how uh cleverly they cut on
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:09.440]  the right moment and everybody knows the story out there and they're just going to uh uh establishing
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:14.880]  that it was a plane what i heard first it's just so funny because they cut the whole sentence out
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:22.880]  and you see even though they did a nice profile in the general um uh clip uh you see that it did
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:29.600]  feed what whatever they wanted to put out there but the real story was never out it's incredible
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:37.200]  and this is abc news and that shows you how they choose and pick whatever they want we posted a
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:42.800]  club a few days ago on prison planet dot com when you should yeah they can go to youtube and type
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:48.320]  william rodriguez abc and they will get it okay then let me just tell the network william rodriguez
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:53.520]  abc and it just starts with willie at ground zero and he's sitting there going and then there
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:59.600]  was a big explosion and they cut and go and the plane hit what did you really say i said there
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:06.160]  was a huge explosion that pushes upwards and at that moment i felt it was a uh a bomb or something
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.200]  explosive like that blew up under the basement and then when i went to verbalize it i heard the
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.840]  impact of the plane all the way on the top they cut all that part
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:23.680]  they're they they just use whatever they want just to put out you see has been uh an experience
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:29.840]  for the last five years have they have taken my story and they have manipulated actually i am
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.640]  putting together hours and hours we're talking about hundreds of hours of interviews that i've
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:40.640]  done and digitizing them all at once to be able to put it out there so people will see that you
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:46.000]  know i've been telling the same story from the very beginning and people keep manipulating the
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.200]  whole thing well some folks will go get the news that's cut you up and then say oh well willie
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:56.080]  didn't say in fact the neocons do that they have done that they have done that will you set a plane
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:02.320]  hit it and then no it's the reporter they believe that constantly yes oh he didn't say this or he
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:08.080]  didn't mention that or or he said one thing and then he said another thing you know they manipulate
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:14.080]  that uh for their own needs just to um debate me but they don't debate me directly say if you
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:19.680]  want to get the real stuff get the real raw footage from the networks you will never get it i
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:23.520]  want to get back into this we're going to get the clip we're going to play it coming up today in
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.360]  about 10 minutes or so we'll have it we'll play it but before we go to break willie let's get
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:32.640]  into 9 11 truth itself i know you can't say too much but rosie o'donnell all the things that are
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:37.040]  happening uh where do you see this going i mean are you seeing the same thing i'm seeing this is
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.760]  make it or break it we're exploding exponentially but they're trying to set the precedent by getting
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:49.600]  her fired they are trying to make her uh not only an icon of the negativity that is out there
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:55.200]  they are attacking her they are calling for her death basically on national television and these
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:01.440]  people are not being prosecuted uh they are hypocrites because uh they have attacked this
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:10.240]  woman for just asking questions all she did was ask questions i definitely 100 uh support rosie
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:16.480]  o'donnell i have written directly to the producers of uh the o'reilly uh factor they have not called
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:23.120]  me back they won't want me to be on the show because you know how do you get a survivor a
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:30.560]  person that was inside the building to support rosie the show will be amazingly on our favor
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.520]  you see they don't want that they don't need that they want to attack they want they are so nervous
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:41.520]  they are so uh they are shaking you can see the fear you can see the fear can't you oh yes
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:47.040]  definitely i'm seeing fear in their eyes aren't you oh well you know what i've seen here from the
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:53.440]  very beginning is what i have been seeing for the last four four and a half years but now i feel that
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.320]  they are so nervous that the truth is coming out that they want to attack anybody that comes out
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:04.720]  you see the people that have been out like you me uh other survivors uh uh firemen they don't
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:09.440]  attack them they don't even acknowledge our existence because we're being added from the
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:14.560]  very beginning but it's also your people it's also the key to them to keep the illusion going
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:20.240]  at the firemen and police and heroes like william rodriguez are all buying into the al qaeda did it
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:25.600]  story does it ever make you sick and i want your answers after the break uh willie because it makes
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.800]  me sick and i'm not a hero like you are on 9-11 uh it makes me sick to see them wrap themselves
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:35.360]  in the dead wrap themselves in the people that the military industrial complex killed
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:40.480]  and then claim that all the victims agree with them when bill doyle who lost his son joey
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:45.200]  says the majority of his group the biggest group he's the head of it believe it's an inside job
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:49.760]  we'll get william rodriguez's take on that because i never asked him this even publicly or privately
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:54.560]  what is it like i mean we've actually got a hero a victim here what what is it like to see the
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:04.560]  killers using people like him we'll be right back now you can enjoy the most delicious freshest and

[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:12.960]  happening so much is going on in the next segment i'm going to play a few minutes of that clip where
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:18.320]  they misrepresent you continually and let you comment on that but the point i raised before we
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:24.720]  hit the last break to see how they expropriate the dead expropriate the heroes how they use the troops
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:30.400]  how they use all of the courage of the american people and people like yourself and then totally
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:35.120]  ignore you and they gave you the big medals and awards and wanted you to run for congress and had
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.840]  you at the white house but as you said no there there were explosions there were bombs they'd
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:43.840]  offered you all this money and you said no i'm going to tell the truth because again you're that
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:49.920]  type of person uh what is it like to see them continue to use the victims and the heroes
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:56.320]  thickening actually it just makes you realize how low these people will go these are the lowest form
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:03.840]  of life and not only that alex just open your eyes this is going to be the big issue on this election
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:11.520]  why because you have this uh giuliani guy trying to run for president when not even the farmers
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:17.520]  are supporting him not even the family members are supporting him this guy created this whole
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:24.720]  illusion and persona of mysticism about 9 11 that he was his huge hero when in reality most of the
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:30.560]  problems that happened during that day was due to his lack of support for the farmers during the
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:39.760]  time prior to 9 11 so you see these uh election upcoming election will be marred constantly by
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:46.400]  the 9 11 issue on top of that you have the first responders dying constantly you have a hundred
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:53.280]  first responders that have died since 9 11 all the rescue dogs have died you have close to 60
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.720]  000 people sick because of the environmental effect and they don't want to recognize that
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:05.040]  because of course it's going to be the biggest liability uh lawsuit ever presented to the city
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:10.560]  so you have uh the mayor of new york mayor bloomberg a billionaire who really doesn't care
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:15.360]  about the families he is calling the shots of everything that is being built on on on ground
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:22.960]  zero here you had yesterday uh the day before yesterday diane horning the president of families
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:30.080]  for proper burial and she has told you directly how her group has been in constant fight with the
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:37.520]  city of new york to try to get a respectful and dignified memorial to have the action remains of
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:43.040]  the people that died on 9 11 be placed on ground zero and the city don't want to do that they
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:51.360]  actually use the action remains to feel to feel potholes and when we are being used politicized
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:57.520]  constantly by not only the city and the state but also by the federal and the government in general
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:04.320]  uh for uh agendas that we don't agree with we feel sick we feel that we have to open our mouth
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:10.000]  and take an action uh constantly against these people that are actually uh putting out a whole
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.840]  story that doesn't agree with what we have been going through not only on 9 11 but after 9 11
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:21.200]  five years after we're still fighting for the truth we're still fighting for respect and dignity
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:26.080]  dignified uh representation for the victims and survivors that died uh the people that died on
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:32.160]  that day and we are not getting that well i agree actually throwing stones and and it's like uh
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:40.560]  you know we are the enemy well it's so convenient for them to use us for every single agenda to
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:48.320]  create this new police state all of the nation that it doesn't i mean just makes you sick well
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:52.560]  uh i mean it makes me sick and i can't imagine seeing people die and saving so many people being
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:56.800]  in the middle of it and then she and i mean being in your position it must be unbearable
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:02.400]  i have you seen that video clip of that mother uh who had the daughter uh named langer it's so
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:06.800]  powerful it makes me cry when i see it when she says she says you know george bush used my daughter
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:12.000]  he used her for his war he used her picture well i'm taking it back but i mean the way she says it
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:18.240]  you can just hear the strength the anger you have to meet donna marsh donna marsh have suffered the
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:25.920]  same situation she lost her daughter and she's so against the government use of 9 11 and how the
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:30.880]  government have closed the doors for a real investigation you should listen to this mother
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:36.960]  i mean we have is not only cindy sheehan uh opening her mouth out there you have the mothers
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:42.400]  of 9 11 trying to get the real truth out to the to the nation and to the world you have

[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:11.360]  well the glass has a natural resonance if the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:15.600]  is big enough the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters using
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:20.000]  this similar principle royal raymond wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed

[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:41.760]  happened on 9-11 this was a presentation that we did for your uh symposium in california and it
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:49.680]  was so powerful like you said is where charlie sheen actually uh came over with uh si morales
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:58.160]  the famous actor from la bamba and uh they were so taken away because of uh not only the information
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:03.920]  but the actual roller coaster they their their expression was i went with you willie through the
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:11.040]  stairs i got the anger i got the laugh i got the crying part because i was experiencing the same
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:17.520]  uh emotions that you presented on that day it's a very powerful uh a documentary not documentary
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:24.080]  presentation and the money that we are raising for for selling the dvd is going to be to actually
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:32.960]  produce the european tour that uh the film from the european tour that we just did in uh uk and uh
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:38.880]  of course uh this is part of what we are doing trying to get the information out and i just want
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:45.360]  to add that one of the activism that we have uh created and i want you to be part of this activism
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:51.680]  is that we are calling up of volunteers all over the world that are listening to us right now
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:56.400]  volunteers we need all kind of volunteers of any kind of experience you have experience in
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:01.360]  photoshop you have experience in premiere you have experience in final cut pro any kind of
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:07.920]  experience so you can actually be part of this uh spreading of the information and we are i
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:13.680]  already have like 900 volunteers from all over the world so we want to expand at least to 10 000
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:19.520]  so we can spread the information as fast as possible well that's what's happening in fact
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.760]  there's a video put together that's three and a half minutes long that literally brought tears
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:28.560]  to my eyes last night um that was put together by some folks we're gonna get on the show tomorrow
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:33.200]  it's up on prison planet dot com that's how you can find the youtube clip the best and it is just
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:37.520]  so strong and and that's what's going to bring the new world order down is that there's all
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:43.040]  these activists all these artists all these people that really are our brothers and sisters and you
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:46.560]  know i always have this subconscious feeling or even a conscious feeling i never really think
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:53.280]  about it i'm so busy but i just last night william i thought about the fact of how blessed i am even
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:59.680]  in all this adversity and and how honored i am and humbled i am to be involved uh in any way
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:05.040]  with all of these wonderful people in 911 truth and then the heroes and and and and people like
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:10.080]  yourself william i mean do you ever despite all the evil and the sickening us of it on the other
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:16.880]  side being part of this community it really hit me last night that i was just thankful to god
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:20.800]  that i am one of the people that woke up and then i know all these other great people
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:26.800]  that i'm not out into some fancy car or fancy restaurants or golf courses or into petty
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:33.440]  garbage and you know just you know what i mean the fakeness of the world yes i agree with you
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:39.680]  actually uh you know so so much fakeness people see me for example i get attacked and constantly
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:44.960]  that i'm probably making a fortune of going around the world and speaking and they don't even know
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:50.240]  that uh last year i only made less than fifteen thousand dollars by going around the world and
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:57.200]  speaking less than fifteen thousand dollars that's less than half of what i used to make as a janitor
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:02.480]  at the world trade center uh but then it's okay but then it's okay for giuliani who all the
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:06.560]  firefighters hate the police all hate him the family's literally like 90 percent hate him
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:11.680]  that's all over new york news nationally they love him he's a hero he has made a hundred thousand
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:15.520]  dollars yeah a hundred thousand dollars for speaking engagement and he's gonna have a million
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:20.560]  on consulting yeah yeah sorry go ahead three and a half million dollars uh for advance for his book
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:27.440]  plus royalties uh three million dollars to speak uh to the government of mexico and uh not counting
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:33.120]  the salary that he gets from giuliani partners and the money 280 000 that he gets from uh managing
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:40.080]  the fireman's fund so you have here a man that is profiting from 9-11 more than the whole community
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:45.760]  of 9-11 put together put together think about it well that's how they operate though the very
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:49.920]  people that carried out the attacks that are fat on the blood of our children and women and people
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:54.800]  that died in there these pigs and then and then we're literally trying to get funds to fight and
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:00.480]  move forward and do a better job so we can you know people to open their eyes and that's why
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:05.520]  alex i'm fighting back i'm fighting back i'm putting my gloves on and i'm fighting back as
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:10.960]  much as i can and somebody accused me of something i put them on put them on i was if i sue the
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:16.560]  president to sue somebody else that cannot validate what they're saying i'll sue them as well because
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:22.960]  we need to fight back we need to take these people and as electrified they are because they are
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:28.640]  totally electrified they're like non-stop attacking us we have to do the same thing back to them i
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:36.240]  will be tomorrow as a matter of fact flying to to chicago because on saturday i will be doing a
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:44.960]  free presentation in on arbor to defend kevin barrett who was actually attacked by a victim of
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:53.920]  9-11 brought in by the jews republican union in his own school you see they are going crazy and
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:58.240]  they're trying to put everybody against each other but i'm going there to protect them and to
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:03.200]  you know well it's not going to work and everybody needs to get william rodriguez what really happened
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:10.560]  on 9-11 for 15 dollars at info wars dot com and i will find each one of them i will find each one
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:16.480]  of them that's right in fact uh these are all signed uh that you've gotten to us and uh it is
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:22.080]  again those are signed we forgot to to uh to make that point and william also give them your website
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:34.320]  is uh 9-11 keymaster.com or william 911.com is the same uh uh website william 911.com now
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:38.480]  before we play this audio clip and then get your analysis of that how they misrepresent you
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:44.000]  continually and then we'll talk to alex mark and dan and lynda and a few others uh how important
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.760]  is it for people to support rosie o'donnell i mean what she's got and it's not about her
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:53.040]  personally even even though we should support her and i appreciate what she's doing and
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:59.200]  admire her courage if they're able as you said to set the precedent by demonizing her and by shutting
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:03.360]  her down then it's going to scare others from going public and these murderers will be able
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:09.680]  to carry out more attacks go to prisoner.com go to info wars.com go to the website we've put up
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:16.480]  and sign the petition and spread the word about that website william i agree with you 100 we have
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:22.560]  to protect her we have to come out and open our mouth they are trying to demonize her they are
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:29.360]  trying to criminalize her we have to take a stand and say no more we support her we want her to
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:36.160]  speak freely it's a matter of free speech even if you don't agree with her you see even if you don't
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:43.200]  agree with her we have to defend her but i agree with her 100 you see i cannot comment too much
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:50.640]  because we're working things behind the whole media thing but yeah i really wish we could tell
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:57.440]  people yeah we'll wait for that but we are actually we are actually calling for people
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:03.760]  to support her as much as they can and if they put a poll just you know flood the poll flood the
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:10.080]  poll to support her please oh that was the other point i forgot to mention there's an abc poll
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:15.600]  running neck and neck with her and she's literally it's literally dead heat you know i mean we're
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:19.680]  talking nose margins on who's going to win this poll if people agree with rosie or they agree with
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:27.600]  o'reilly the demon it's just unbelievable well they have nowhere to go and that's why they are
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:32.320]  fighting because they see their status quo being changed well are you hearing them more and more
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:36.240]  say we need to be arrested we need to be killed they're not just saying that about rosie i mean
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:42.880]  they're saying we are al qaeda william but you see they don't face me i want them to face me
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:48.720]  they don't face me they are afraid to put me on the show i want to be on the show i'm ready remember
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:53.360]  what happened last time that they wanted to attack charlie and they call me they sent a car to my
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:59.760]  house to my house and when i said no i support charlie they took the car away they said oh no
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:03.120]  no no they've done stuff like that to me before they said they want me to you know oh yeah we
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:06.880]  want to hear your view and then when you're five minutes away they go in the limo they go well this
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:11.280]  is what we want you to say and when you want they go oh just got a call they don't want you but but
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:17.360]  let me expand on that because this is important when they wanted me to go on fox news on a tape
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:21.680]  show with mancow and i was really burned out at the time i was i was working all the time still
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:26.320]  doing that but i didn't want to fly i'd just been to new york and i'd gotten the flu while i was
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.320]  there thank god i didn't get sick till the flight back and i mean that was like the worst flu i ever
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:33.440]  had and i just like i don't want to go back to new york i don't want to go back to new york it's
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:37.280]  kind of like you got a hangover you don't want to drink that drink again and i said we'll send
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:43.040]  kevin smith he by the way did a great job and but but i they kept saying well well we want somebody
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:47.200]  you know who can talk about this and i said why don't you have william rodriguez on remember
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:50.560]  and then we get and then we called you but you had to go somewhere and then they said it doesn't
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:56.080]  matter we don't even want him anyways they don't want you on there you see you see and the thing
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:01.280]  is that also if they ask me to be on a show is going to be a recorded show and i always say no
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:05.840]  if you want me i want to be live because i don't want to be edited because of the experience that
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:12.000]  i we that you're actually going to play now but the problem is that you know i want to be confronted
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.920]  with argumentation and debate with people that understand what i went through that day i was
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:22.960]  there they weren't so they have no argument with me and since i don't feed their format
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.280]  they will take me out they won't put me on absolutely let's play part of this clip and
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:33.280]  go to some calls this is now tell folks william which particular tv show this is this is the news
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:41.840]  uh for a the abc news here in new york and that was the profile that they did for um uh 9 11 uh
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:49.440]  five year ceremony uh presenting me as one of the big heroes of 9 11 but they're not letting what
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:54.160]  you had to say show up on the tape they edited it to misrepresent that the plane caused the
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:59.520]  explosion here's the clip all right it stays with you forever it's imprinted rodriguez worked at the
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:05.200]  north tower he was a custodian responsible for cleaning the stairwell on the morning of 9 11
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:13.680]  he was in the basement we hear boom an explosion so loud that put us upwards on the air and we
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:18.240]  started screaming we didn't know what it was it was the first hijacked plane that hit the tower
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:23.440]  we call it the key of hope rodriguez had one of only five master keys back that up about 20
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.000]  seconds to where he says it was an explosion it pushed us upwards and then he went on to say
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:33.440]  we believe it was an explosion in the basement nope they cut that and say it was the plane as
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:39.520]  if he the eyewitness was saying that william what did you say uh at the point where they cut i say
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:44.480]  we didn't know what it was and at the first thing that came to my mind is that one of the generators
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:51.280]  blew up on the basement it sounded like like a bomb and uh when i went to verbalize it uh we
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:55.760]  heard the impact of the plane all the way on the top they caught all of that and they put the plane
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:00.080]  on the top right away now again to be clear then you saw people coming up out of the basement with
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:05.360]  their faces and hands and skin hanging off like zombies uh you know out of some uh you know out
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:10.400]  of some horror movie which proving it was down there we know there was an explosion big explosions
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.360]  and the firefighters and police say this too again play the editing this is big brother
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:22.480]  ladies and gentlemen on the morning of 9 11 he was in the basement we're here boom an explosion so
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:28.160]  loud that put us upwards on the air and we started screaming we didn't know what it was
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:33.200]  it was the first hijacked plane that hit the tower we call it the key of hope rodriguez had
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.160]  one of only five ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen realize what's happening now abc's own
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:42.640]  rosie o'donnell with their top-rated morning show 30 million viewers to a rally's two and a
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:46.720]  half mil okay that's the numbers we're talking about that's why they're so jealous uh now

[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.640]  people told him that they have to get it approved we'll just leave it at that uh so they're calling
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:11.600]  for censorship it's already going on they got a big problem on their hands because if this chain
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.560]  reactions which it's starting to do it's over folks 9 11 is going to fall their main terror
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:20.960]  tactic that they use to set up the police state and the new world order and the demonization of
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:24.880]  america worldwide because that's what they're doing with all this you know domestically we
