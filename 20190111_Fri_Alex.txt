[00:00.000 --> 00:12.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have discovered, hiding in plain view, the master plan when
[00:12.840 --> 00:20.400]  I come back from break, Obama, well, I'm just going to have to tell you after the break,
[00:20.400 --> 00:25.600]  but he, this is so unbelievable and people don't even know how to deal with something
[00:25.600 --> 00:36.080]  of this magnitude because it's so criminal, it's so diabolical, it's so evil that Congress
[00:36.080 --> 00:40.360]  doesn't even know how to respond and the President doesn't know how to respond.
[00:40.360 --> 00:43.760]  I know how to respond.
[00:43.760 --> 00:44.760]  So we'll tell you about when we come back.
[00:44.760 --> 00:49.920]  Here's part of Greg Reese's excellent report he just filed on the common sense issue of
[00:49.920 --> 00:54.720]  border security, the full reports being posted to newswords.com, infowords.com, but here's
[00:54.720 --> 00:58.960]  part of this important report, please go to infowords.com and newswords.com and get the
[00:58.960 --> 01:00.880]  video and share it and spread it.
[01:00.880 --> 01:01.880]  Here it is.
[01:01.880 --> 01:09.040]  The phrase, when in Rome, do as the Romans do, has been around for generations.
[01:09.040 --> 01:12.440]  It illustrates the wisdom of respecting other cultures.
[01:12.440 --> 01:19.120]  It is much like the golden rule, do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
[01:19.120 --> 01:24.400]  When you are a guest in another person's home, it is only right to honor and respect their
[01:24.400 --> 01:25.400]  home.
[01:25.400 --> 01:33.120]  A nation is a home to its citizens and the only way it can exist is with a border.
[01:33.120 --> 01:39.200]  This all may sound like common sense and before the election of President Trump, it certainly
[01:39.200 --> 01:40.200]  was.
[01:40.200 --> 01:45.920]  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record
[01:45.920 --> 01:50.880]  number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before,
[01:50.880 --> 01:56.840]  by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.
[01:56.840 --> 02:01.440]  In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of
[02:01.440 --> 02:05.880]  illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the work
[02:05.880 --> 02:11.800]  face as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.
[02:11.800 --> 02:16.680]  We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws.
[02:16.680 --> 02:21.720]  It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind
[02:21.720 --> 02:28.360]  of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years and we must do more to stop.
[02:28.360 --> 02:34.120]  What we need to do simultaneously, you know, secure our borders with technology, personnel,
[02:34.120 --> 02:37.040]  physical barriers if necessary in some places.
[02:37.040 --> 02:41.600]  If passed, this bill would be the biggest commitment to border security in our nation's
[02:41.600 --> 02:42.600]  history.
[02:42.600 --> 02:48.320]  We would spend another $6.5 billion on top of what we are already spending towards stronger,
[02:48.320 --> 02:51.680]  smarter security along our borders.
[02:51.680 --> 02:57.760]  It would increase criminal penalties against smugglers and traffickers.
[02:57.760 --> 03:04.440]  It would finally give every employer a reliable way to check that every person they are hiring
[03:04.440 --> 03:11.320]  is here illegally and would hold employers more accountable if they knowingly hire undocumented
[03:11.320 --> 03:13.600]  workers.
[03:13.600 --> 03:18.400]  Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we're also a nation of laws.
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.400]  Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws and I believe that they must be held
[03:22.400 --> 03:23.400]  accountable.
[03:23.400 --> 03:32.080]  But now, for whatever reason, the Democratic Party is opposed to protecting American sovereignty.
[03:32.080 --> 03:37.040]  In today's upside-down world, protecting a border is immoral.
[03:37.040 --> 03:42.960]  A wall is an immorality, it's not who we are as a nation.
[03:42.960 --> 03:44.960]  The wall, in my view, is an immorality.
[03:44.960 --> 03:50.440]  It has nothing to do with politics, it has to do with the wall as an immorality between
[03:50.440 --> 03:51.440]  countries.
[03:51.440 --> 03:53.800]  It's an old way of thinking.
[03:53.800 --> 04:00.000]  Now, many people have pointed out that Nancy Pelosi has a wall around her home.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.320]  This home and others have suggested that this is not her home.
[04:04.320 --> 04:09.640]  They have posted images of this building and claimed that this is her home.
[04:09.640 --> 04:15.800]  But we live in a time where common sense is no longer common and many miss the obvious
[04:15.800 --> 04:24.120]  fact that this home, like most, is made of walls and secured with locked doors and windows.
[04:24.120 --> 04:29.880]  To claim that it is immoral to secure your border is equivalent to saying it is immoral
[04:29.880 --> 04:31.520]  to secure your own home.
[04:31.520 --> 04:36.680]  It is the equivalent of saying that private property is immoral.
[04:36.680 --> 04:42.680]  For common sense people, the primary purpose of government is to protect the people.
[04:42.680 --> 04:47.280]  According to our Constitution, the purpose of our federal government is to establish
[04:47.280 --> 04:54.320]  justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general
[04:54.320 --> 05:00.640]  welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.

[06:24.040 --> 06:39.680]  Pabby Cannon has come out echoing basically my exact same words in a big editorial article.
[06:39.680 --> 06:48.080]  It's linked up on InfoWars.com saying memo to Trump, declare emergency, declare it now.
[06:48.080 --> 06:54.920]  And don't just declare it on the border, because that declaration will allow you to remove
[06:54.920 --> 06:57.360]  a lot of the embedded Obama people.
[06:57.360 --> 07:01.720]  Be honest with the public about how we're under UN globalist attack.
[07:01.720 --> 07:10.400]  They're teaching us that having a nation even existing is evil and is bad.
[07:10.400 --> 07:18.040]  Now, before I hit all of the incredible news, I'm going to hit the most important news ever
[07:18.040 --> 07:23.880]  when it comes to the concerted global program to censor nationalist conservatives and Christians
[07:23.880 --> 07:26.800]  off the Internet.
[07:26.800 --> 07:36.000]  And then once that precedent has been set, the Wall Street Journal seven months ago,
[07:36.000 --> 07:42.320]  a month and a half before my total purge, and then everybody else's purge, said don't
[07:42.320 --> 07:51.000]  worry in a 30-plus-page subscription-only article that we wrote about and had big excerpts
[07:51.000 --> 07:58.080]  of on InfoWars.com said, don't worry, major newspapers and TV networks can be more profitable
[07:58.080 --> 08:05.640]  than ever, because they said within one year, this was seven and a half, eight months ago,
[08:05.640 --> 08:12.840]  they said within one year, the Internet will no longer be free, it will be like Netflix,
[08:12.840 --> 08:16.800]  and you will not be able to go, not just to quote fake news.
[08:16.800 --> 08:23.400]  Once the precedent's set to do that, the real bonanza of authoritarianism is the monopoly.
[08:23.400 --> 08:30.760]  So once they get the KKK, oh, then they get Alex Jones, then they get, oh, Antifa, then
[08:30.760 --> 08:36.360]  the conservatives come and say, yeah, you take them off, too, and then you see Jack Spratt
[08:36.360 --> 08:42.480]  could eat no fat, and his wife could eat no lean.
[08:42.480 --> 08:49.320]  So between the two of them, they licked the platter clean.
[08:49.320 --> 08:51.640]  Conservatives want to censor the liberals.
[08:51.640 --> 08:54.120]  Liberals want to censor the conservatives.
[08:54.120 --> 08:59.920]  The leftist professor, the classes in the background, they'll just take their mask off
[08:59.920 --> 09:04.040]  later and they go in and are the fact checkers, the new royalty.
[09:04.040 --> 09:09.280]  Now, I want the listeners to listen to me very, very, very carefully, and I don't say
[09:09.280 --> 09:14.440]  this to sound pompous, it's the opposite and it scares the hell out of me, because I don't
[09:14.440 --> 09:21.000]  want to be one of the only people that knows this when it's hiding in plain view.
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.480]  Let me correct that.
[09:23.480 --> 09:30.440]  One of the only people that is opposing this program and researching it, when it is a giant
[09:30.440 --> 09:38.360]  industrial scale program with over a million people conservatively involved in it, it's
[09:38.360 --> 09:44.560]  a public Manhattan project hiding in plain view and they put it in foreign affairs and
[09:44.560 --> 09:49.760]  they put it in public affairs, both CFR rags, and they admit the whole architecture and
[09:49.760 --> 09:53.560]  they go to security conferences and they say it all.
[09:53.560 --> 10:00.240]  How they're, remember the neocons always wanted authoritarianism, the Chicago school,
[10:00.240 --> 10:06.800]  Strauss that started the whole neocon, your modern idea, thought that Hitler did a good
[10:06.800 --> 10:11.960]  job, he just shouldn't have been anti-Semitic.
[10:11.960 --> 10:20.000]  The neocons are the real group working with the Democrats against the Tea Party Liberty
[10:20.000 --> 10:27.440]  Republicans, and so you think we've got Congress or even did a few months ago, we didn't.
[10:27.440 --> 10:29.600]  We never had Congress.
[10:29.600 --> 10:33.480]  We never had the total trifecta of the legislative, the executive, the judicial.
[10:33.480 --> 10:39.080]  Now, Gensburg about to make a jump in the hyperspace and the White House, the word is,
[10:39.080 --> 10:44.080]  is getting ready that she's going to be having to retire dying basically any day.
[10:44.080 --> 10:49.960]  Word is from little birdies that she's not even conscious right now.
[10:49.960 --> 10:54.600]  So these are good omens God's giving us, I mean, I wish nobody harmed even a horrible
[10:54.600 --> 10:59.200]  globalist like her, but this is still a very good omen for the republic, just a little
[10:59.200 --> 11:04.800]  sign that they're all dropping like flies with the Providence delivering.
[11:04.800 --> 11:14.800]  We need to pray for Providence, we need to pray big time, but let me just pull back because
[11:14.800 --> 11:18.880]  I always try to give a bunch of technicals because I know if some congressmen or women
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.680]  are listening or if executives are listening, they're actually into facts, they'll hear
[11:23.680 --> 11:26.000]  the things I'm saying and then go look it up.
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.800]  So they understand this is not my view and I understand large swaths of the public are
[11:30.800 --> 11:36.480]  unconscious and very lazy and quite frankly stupid and everybody claims they know how
[11:36.480 --> 11:37.480]  stuff works.
[11:37.480 --> 11:46.840]  I really do know how things work, I know exactly how they work and we had already reverse engineered
[11:46.840 --> 11:55.160]  this and predicted it before Trump won, it was going to happen one way or the other.
[11:55.160 --> 12:02.280]  It's just harder for them because Trump won, but because Trump is so cut off and the whole
[12:02.280 --> 12:09.280]  bureaucracy is just ignoring him, he's like a big powerful juggernaut meets a giant swamp
[12:09.280 --> 12:13.560]  and so to have the weight and the strength and everything starts making him bog in.
[12:13.560 --> 12:20.240]  So we're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and I'm going to just quantify
[12:20.240 --> 12:27.880]  this and I'm going to announce what's happening in just big, colorful, expansive statements
[12:27.880 --> 12:30.800]  the way the pundits do it and they never give you facts and then I'm going to give you the
[12:30.800 --> 12:36.000]  facts afterwards instead of just going right into the facts, but here's the bottom line.
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.800]  The best way to describe this and what it is is a bunch of projects to censor the internet
[12:41.800 --> 12:47.840]  and control and social engineering and consolidate power for corporations, not just shut down
[12:47.840 --> 12:52.920]  quote right wingers or what they call fake news or populist, but to vertically integrate
[12:52.920 --> 12:58.120]  the entire economy and so there were a bunch of projects being tested in China, Europe
[12:58.120 --> 13:07.400]  and other areas to bring the censorship here and the UK and Hillary and others had it set
[13:07.400 --> 13:13.920]  up that once she got in, they were going to roll this out with the system about to break
[13:13.920 --> 13:18.240]  down after the break when she won.
[13:18.240 --> 13:24.240]  Well when she lost, they absolutely crap themselves and accelerated the program to try to even
[13:24.240 --> 13:30.120]  keep Trump from getting into office because they rightfully know if this comes out, if
[13:30.120 --> 13:38.400]  people make this a political issue, instead of it being a technical factoid academic issue,
[13:38.400 --> 13:45.240]  if the public digest this raw meat, this red meat, it's cyanide to the new world order.
[13:45.240 --> 13:50.440]  You think the globalists are in trouble now, when I come back, I'm going to lay it out.
[13:50.440 --> 13:54.680]  But here's the bottom line.
[13:54.680 --> 14:02.360]  Obama with the neocons, with large sections of US intelligence, Defense Department, all
[14:02.360 --> 14:03.360]  of it.
[14:03.360 --> 14:05.960]  This is all public.
[14:05.960 --> 14:17.120]  Set up a total internet kill switch system that is manned by at least 100,000 people
[14:17.120 --> 14:30.040]  right now with heads up displays on your phone, on your computer, live time and all new devices,
[14:30.040 --> 14:34.480]  Microsoft, Apple, Google, the idea that Apple says what happens on your phone stays on your
[14:34.480 --> 14:35.480]  phone.
[14:35.480 --> 14:42.200]  It's already been beta tested and in three months it rolls out on the new Microsoft everything
[14:42.200 --> 14:46.640]  where they're in your phone live time and they put, like the fact checking you see on
[14:46.640 --> 14:50.440]  Google and Facebook and Twitter, when I had Buzz Aldrin on and they just put a fact check
[14:50.440 --> 14:55.600]  up saying, Jones says no one wants the moon, but Encyclopedia Britannica says we did.
[14:55.600 --> 14:57.840]  The damn interview says we went to the moon.
[14:57.840 --> 15:01.120]  See how that's fake news, lying about me but superimposed?
[15:01.120 --> 15:09.480]  It will not be on the site you go to now that opts in, it will be over all devices with
[15:09.480 --> 15:17.040]  a huge heads up display through all these intelligence agencies including Interpol,
[15:17.040 --> 15:23.920]  the reactivated Stasi in Germany, Google's moving into the former Stasi headquarters.
[15:23.920 --> 15:28.520]  The magnitude is incredible and they will all be, remember when CNN was in my YouTube
[15:28.520 --> 15:32.600]  and knew how much money I was making and everything was called for me to be banned and people
[15:32.600 --> 15:35.400]  were like, that's crazy, how are they in your YouTube with Google?
[15:35.400 --> 15:41.720]  That, Oliver Darcy and all of them are in this, they literally, that's going to be mainstream
[15:41.720 --> 15:47.160]  corporate media are now going to be the policemen in your phones, in your computers and putting
[15:47.160 --> 15:52.560]  heads up displays over your phone and it's starting now.
[15:52.560 --> 15:59.640]  I mean total control at device level.

[19:09.080 --> 19:10.080]  Believe me.
[19:10.080 --> 19:14.360]  Well, I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every

[19:28.720 --> 19:33.720]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[19:33.720 --> 19:40.960]  and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.

[20:03.560 --> 20:18.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:18.520 --> 20:27.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance,
[20:27.160 --> 20:33.760]  rallying Patriots worldwide.
[20:33.760 --> 20:42.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:42.360 --> 20:49.320]  I am begging everyone watching this live show or listening on the radio to look into the
[20:49.320 --> 20:53.560]  facts I'm about to lay out, to find out they're absolutely true, in fact worse than I can
[20:53.560 --> 20:54.560]  even say.
[20:54.560 --> 21:02.000]  There's so many details and then contact Congress.
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.680]  Contact major corporations, ask to speak at your church, do whatever it is you have to
[21:07.680 --> 21:17.120]  do to expose this because in three months, Microsoft and then Apple and then Google,
[21:17.120 --> 21:32.360]  all of them by the middle of 2019, are implementing live access into your phone where they will
[21:32.360 --> 21:35.480]  see where you're going and what you're doing in live time.
[21:35.480 --> 21:37.320]  We already know they've been tracking us and doing that.
[21:37.320 --> 21:44.080]  But now they're going to have a consortium of neocon organizations, hardcore Soros-backed
[21:44.080 --> 21:53.600]  organizations about to show you mainstream news, same as specially selected by Obama
[21:53.600 --> 22:04.480]  and Hillary before they left office, groups in every US intelligence agency, all 17, coordinating
[22:04.480 --> 22:11.600]  political minders that don't just spy on you, that send live time messages over what you're
[22:11.600 --> 22:12.760]  browsing on the Internet.
[22:12.760 --> 22:17.000]  So it isn't like you go to somewhere on Facebook and there's an Alex Jones video and then it
[22:17.000 --> 22:23.680]  puts up a link from Snopes saying this is fake or from the Southern Property Law Center
[22:23.680 --> 22:30.880]  or from the ADL or from Media Matters, literally Soros when you go to a site breaking in and
[22:30.880 --> 22:31.880]  putting it over.
[22:31.880 --> 22:36.240]  It's going to be on your device.
[22:36.240 --> 22:41.040]  Now we've already seen this happen in Fort Worth where they didn't just delist us off
[22:41.040 --> 22:45.680]  of iTunes six months ago.
[22:45.680 --> 22:55.840]  We had links just to our own podcast and in the iPhone browser they blocked you on an
[22:55.840 --> 23:05.360]  iPhone being able through that function on the phone to get to it.
[23:05.360 --> 23:12.000]  You understand you go buy a phone and the next level is you can't go to infowars.com,
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.100]  you can't click on it, you can't listen and they've now got keyword and they've got audio
[23:16.100 --> 23:20.280]  which is the next level where then they won't even let you listen to my voice.
[23:20.280 --> 23:22.320]  It's automatically blocked.
[23:22.320 --> 23:24.280]  Now listen to me carefully.
[23:24.280 --> 23:26.440]  This is for everybody.
[23:26.440 --> 23:31.760]  This is going to totally vertically integrate the entire world.
[23:31.760 --> 23:36.140]  Once they're done doing this to political groups they don't like, the Wall Street Journal
[23:36.140 --> 23:42.920]  again a month and a half before we got purged, we're going to say that article, said when
[23:42.920 --> 23:51.800]  we're done with Jones as the test case, we're going to take everyone off and you will maybe
[23:51.800 --> 23:56.440]  have a thousand channels on the Internet.
[23:56.440 --> 24:02.600]  And the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times will be the king fact checkers and they'll
[24:02.600 --> 24:06.400]  disseminate it out to the minders who they've already got a hundred thousand trained, I
[24:06.400 --> 24:10.760]  have the articles right here, who are already on Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter, already
[24:10.760 --> 24:15.360]  practicing taking Franklin Graham off and taking Gavin McInnes off.
[24:15.360 --> 24:18.400]  And then oh we're sorry it was an accident but just teaching you they're there.
[24:18.400 --> 24:23.200]  Oh we made a mistake, sorry you're back, Ali Alexander, but by the way don't go on
[24:23.200 --> 24:24.200]  Alex Jones' show.
[24:24.200 --> 24:28.840]  Oh Joe Rogan, yeah we blocked your podcast getting uploaded on to iTunes when you had
[24:28.840 --> 24:31.840]  Alex Jones on, don't have him on again or we'll delist you.
[24:31.840 --> 24:37.760]  And by the way don't tell anybody Joe, oh but there's a good news Joe, soon we're going
[24:37.760 --> 24:42.680]  to have a program where your administrator, if they're trusted and signed some paperwork,
[24:42.680 --> 24:46.520]  you're going to be able to go flag things that are about you that aren't true and you're
[24:46.520 --> 24:50.480]  going to be able to confidentially talk to us and Joe if you do a good job for about
[24:50.480 --> 24:53.640]  a year with us, you're going to be able to take stuff down yourself.
[24:53.640 --> 24:59.160]  How would you like to be a trusted administrator?
[24:59.160 --> 25:03.240]  And then Alex Jones puts out a couple of videos about you, they got a million views last
[25:03.240 --> 25:09.600]  week on other people's channels and then a little message from YouTube, you need to
[25:09.600 --> 25:12.320]  watch what you're putting up or your whole channel's gone.
[25:12.320 --> 25:13.840]  See how that works?
[25:13.840 --> 25:14.920]  See how that works?
[25:14.920 --> 25:20.680]  So see that's how corruption works is they get you involved and they give you some power
[25:20.680 --> 25:23.480]  like the Nazis did.
[25:23.480 --> 25:29.280]  So remember what all these senators have said, we're putting them on screen of your TV viewer.
[25:29.280 --> 25:33.360]  Democrat senators have said, we took Alex Jones off, now there's thousands more need
[25:33.360 --> 25:35.840]  to be banned.
[25:35.840 --> 25:40.760]  And they went further, they said they need to be banned from radio and TV as well and
[25:40.760 --> 25:47.280]  we're putting in systems that'll do that as well where the DVRs and receivers in your
[25:47.280 --> 25:51.360]  TVs won't even pick up who they want blocked.
[25:51.360 --> 25:57.960]  Oh, remember this week, don't even show the president's speech, they were trying to introduce
[25:57.960 --> 26:02.600]  that idea to you, you see.
[26:02.600 --> 26:07.120]  And oh, they had a big defense department meeting a few months ago, we first reported
[26:07.120 --> 26:20.440]  on Infowars.com and guess what, they said that by the end of the next year, the internet
[26:20.440 --> 26:25.880]  as we know it will be over and everyone will be censored but selected corporations allowing
[26:25.880 --> 26:33.760]  the orderly direction of society, that's called dictatorship, direction means dictating.
[26:33.760 --> 26:43.240]  The orderly directing of society, my God, the, I'm going to get directed by Mr. Fly,
[26:43.240 --> 26:48.000]  the neocon, I've got all the articles, all the names, all their admissions, but they're
[26:48.000 --> 26:54.520]  establishment publications or then their mainline publications selling you on, oh, thank God,
[26:54.520 --> 27:00.560]  there's a consortium of groups helping fat check, but they're not doing enough, of course.
[27:00.560 --> 27:04.440]  And then everywhere I go, everything I've said or done, they put a lie on it.
[27:04.440 --> 27:06.800]  They don't even act like you're smart.
[27:06.800 --> 27:11.280]  A great example was I talked about a buzz Aldrin on 10 years ago and how I believe the
[27:11.280 --> 27:15.160]  moon landing happened and a lot of other things and I never said it didn't happen and they
[27:15.160 --> 27:18.520]  saw the news, Jones says the moon landing never happened, it's in Texas Monthly on
[27:18.520 --> 27:23.720]  the cover of this month that Jones said the moon landing never happened and under it was
[27:23.720 --> 27:29.120]  encyclopedia Britannica saying Jones says the moon landing didn't happen, but it did
[27:29.120 --> 27:35.320]  and the video I'm saying it did with Buzz Aldrin, the second person to walk on the moon.
[27:35.320 --> 27:36.320]  Does he have credibility?
[27:36.320 --> 27:39.640]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, someone under the Southern
[27:39.640 --> 27:45.800]  Poverty Law Center, I went and looked it up, has a shield, you know, like the old dukes
[27:45.800 --> 27:50.960]  would have her kings putting their mark in the wax, Encyclopedia Britannica, that old
[27:50.960 --> 27:53.960]  respected name, is now Southern Poverty Law Center.
[27:53.960 --> 27:58.440]  They just load whatever they want and they go, well, that's respected, let's get Encyclopedia
[27:58.440 --> 28:03.080]  Britannica, nobody reads those anymore, we can get that name for nothing and we'll now
[28:03.080 --> 28:08.720]  be Encyclopedia Britannica and we'll say the moon's made of cheese if we want.
[28:08.720 --> 28:13.640]  In Encyclopedia Britannica, Jones says that nobody ever went to the moon and the video
[28:13.640 --> 28:20.200]  above is me saying we did, but see, they're gonna hone their systems down, I guess, and
[28:20.200 --> 28:22.920]  not make it as obvious, right?
[28:22.920 --> 28:25.520]  Like them saying there's no border crisis and that, you know, Trump's a liar over and
[28:25.520 --> 28:26.520]  over again.
[28:26.520 --> 28:30.480]  So, when we come back, I'm gonna explain all this, we got loaded huge guests, I'm never
[28:30.480 --> 28:33.360]  good at telling you about the huge guests we have coming on, Cassandra Fairbranks is
[28:33.360 --> 28:36.560]  a great lady, good friend of mine, over at the Gateway Punnett, she got it, had a lengthy
[28:36.560 --> 28:41.640]  discussion with Julian Assange and he's got some big breaking exclusive stuff for us coming
[28:41.640 --> 28:46.280]  up, we've got so many other big guests as well today, I'll tell you about those on the
[28:46.280 --> 28:50.000]  other side, but do you understand?
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.480]  On a Richter scale, the censorship you've seen is a one, compared to the 10, you're
[28:54.480 --> 28:59.520]  about to witness total censorship spying takeover by criminal class.
[28:59.520 --> 29:27.600]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse, but I need to know their good
[29:27.600 --> 29:28.600]  quality.

[33:28.960 --> 33:40.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we now have the complete internet takeover plan, blueprints.
[33:40.440 --> 33:46.160]  Within three months, every computer device in the country, already has the back doors
[33:46.160 --> 33:52.320]  built into it with devices made five, six years ago, will be broken into, via your terms
[33:52.320 --> 33:56.720]  of service, you won't be allowed to not have it on there, by the Southern Parvy Law Center,
[33:56.720 --> 34:02.760]  the ADL, the ADL used to have to break into police stations to get information, and they
[34:02.760 --> 34:10.280]  got convicted of that, and got sued over it, by media matters towards Soros, and by the
[34:10.280 --> 34:17.920]  main neocon think tanks, with Defense Department yearly funding that Obama put in place, with
[34:17.920 --> 34:24.440]  oversight by special offices set up by Obama and Hillary at the CIA.
[34:24.440 --> 34:30.280]  And just as you've seen in China, where you can't send on phones, emojis of the Taiwanese
[34:30.280 --> 34:35.000]  flag, and that went worldwide for a while, or you can't send images of Wendy the Pooh,
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.560]  because the dictator doesn't like it, because people make fun of him in China, so Wendy
[34:39.560 --> 34:44.280]  the Pooh's banned, and they've got a firewall and systems that detect that, and you can't
[34:44.280 --> 34:51.600]  send that over platforms, the EU just signed a law banning memes, by law you must pre-approved
[34:51.600 --> 34:56.640]  them and scan them through a government system before you put a meme out, that's prior restraint
[34:56.640 --> 35:01.640]  on speech, this is way beyond 1984.
[35:01.640 --> 35:07.120]  And so starting in three months, and rolling out through the rest of the year, and we have
[35:07.120 --> 35:11.880]  neocons at major events admitting this, we have all the articles admitting it, they're
[35:11.880 --> 35:16.480]  just bragging, they say you think Alex Jones was a big deal, you think us banning thousands
[35:16.480 --> 35:21.680]  of conservatives was a big deal, we only did that to get the left wing on board.
[35:21.680 --> 35:26.840]  The Democrats are so sick and tired of their own constituents being anti-war and everything,
[35:26.840 --> 35:31.480]  we're going to ban all of them, and then the conservatives who feel like they've been wronged
[35:31.480 --> 35:35.240]  are going to take the bait.
[35:35.240 --> 35:39.920]  And once that's done, we're going to set the precedent to ban everybody.
[35:39.920 --> 35:46.040]  It doesn't matter if you've got a show about gardening on YouTube, if it's popular and
[35:46.040 --> 35:51.880]  you've got 100,000 subscribers and you've got a great arborist business that sits plants
[35:51.880 --> 35:55.280]  around the country, there's a bunch of those, I've ordered plants off some of those, I've
[35:55.280 --> 35:58.040]  even talked to them on the phone, I'm like wow, how's your business doing, how much money
[35:58.040 --> 35:59.040]  are you guys making?
[35:59.040 --> 36:04.160]  I'm like wow, you know in the future, they're going to, I was ordering some trumpet vines
[36:04.160 --> 36:08.360]  just six months ago and I brought it up to them, I said, you know they're coming for
[36:08.360 --> 36:12.000]  you next and they're going to let you operate, funny things, I got an email from the guy
[36:12.000 --> 36:15.240]  and he said, how did you know that, I just started getting contacted by YouTube and they
[36:15.240 --> 36:21.360]  said things are about to change, I'm going to have to pay them to even be on YouTube,
[36:21.360 --> 36:26.200]  but they're going to have a conference and I should fly there and I said, I know brother
[36:26.200 --> 36:33.400]  and see, we're being hit by such a criminal takeover, such a mafia takeover that just
[36:33.400 --> 36:40.680]  to have any type of online store, to sell beanie babies online, to sell roses online,
[36:40.680 --> 36:44.920]  to just be involved in commerce period, you're going to have to pay the piper to the big
[36:44.920 --> 36:53.320]  tech giants and by the time they do that, everyone else is going to be shut off, by
[36:53.320 --> 36:58.280]  the time they get around to all the little merchants and all the regular people, it'll
[36:58.280 --> 37:06.200]  be too late, but here's the mega scandal, here's the take away, hiding in plain view,
[37:06.200 --> 37:09.280]  the head of Google, the head of Facebook, the head of Twitter, the head of all these groups,
[37:09.280 --> 37:13.400]  they go to Congress and they say, we've never censored anybody, we've never manipulated
[37:13.400 --> 37:21.560]  search results, we've never been paid to promote a search result, that's the whole
[37:21.560 --> 37:28.440]  model, it's like saying that the American flag doesn't have red on it, but you know it's
[37:28.440 --> 37:36.640]  got red on it, mega lies, you know why they're so confident to lie?
[37:36.640 --> 37:43.840]  Because they've got a perfect storm where six and a half, seven months ago, right before
[37:43.840 --> 37:52.680]  I got banned, the Wall Street Journal put out a, again, huge article that I'll show you
[37:52.680 --> 37:57.720]  here in a moment, saying we're going to take over the whole internet and end it being free
[37:57.720 --> 38:02.440]  and you're not just going to pay to play, we're not going to let anybody on it, but
[38:02.440 --> 38:05.720]  select companies and then of course they're all going to start fighting with each other
[38:05.720 --> 38:11.960]  too over how many can be there, it's a total takeover because the internet was going to
[38:11.960 --> 38:15.760]  decentralize things, it was going to end all these monopolies and it was starting to
[38:15.760 --> 38:21.080]  do it and the globalists are like, no, this is supposed to bring in total control and
[38:21.080 --> 38:28.600]  so they're doing it, it's all over the German news now that they're going to train stations,
[38:28.600 --> 38:32.240]  first I saw it two days ago in one sitting, now it's all over and they're going to attractive
[38:32.240 --> 38:36.720]  women who have blonde hair and saying, are you a racist?
[38:36.720 --> 38:37.720]  Are you a nationalist?
[38:37.720 --> 38:41.080]  And the women say, no, no, no, I'm not, like they believe they're going to be arrested
[38:41.080 --> 38:44.400]  and the police say good because you'll be arrested if you are.
[38:44.400 --> 38:51.280]  So now they're even saying, we'll take you away because you're white.
[38:51.280 --> 38:57.360]  And one woman said, but you're blonde haired and the cop pulled out a breathalyzer and
[38:57.360 --> 39:00.480]  shoved it in her mouth, tried to take her to jail for talking back and then the Germans
[39:00.480 --> 39:03.040]  went, oh, don't worry, it's a social experiment.
[39:03.040 --> 39:04.040]  Of course it is.
[39:04.040 --> 39:09.800]  They go, we're not really going to arrest you for blonde hair, it's a social experiment.
[39:09.800 --> 39:15.160]  I called Watson that morning before anybody else had picked it up and he says it's crazy
[39:15.160 --> 39:19.480]  and I said, no, Paul, it's meant to make them insecure and scared and spread the word so
[39:19.480 --> 39:24.320]  when they really start arresting people for what color they are, people won't say, oh,
[39:24.320 --> 39:26.600]  I care about that because they've already heard about it and they go, oh, that's just
[39:26.600 --> 39:27.600]  an experiment.
[39:27.600 --> 39:33.840]  They're testing you, studies show when they show you a bunch of murders on TV, you become
[39:33.840 --> 39:35.440]  desensitized to the real thing.
[39:35.440 --> 39:39.240]  That's why they show soldiers simulated shooting.
[39:39.240 --> 39:44.000]  The first video games were, you know, of killing people up close who weren't real so when you
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.240]  kill the real people, you don't care.
[39:48.240 --> 39:49.240]  It's a desensitization.
[39:49.240 --> 39:53.760]  And look, I know you know all this folks, let me tell you, only being aware of this will
[39:53.760 --> 39:54.760]  defeat it.
[39:54.760 --> 40:02.400]  You can't, you can't look at the news, Fox News, CNN, any of these things and think you're
[40:02.400 --> 40:06.600]  getting what the story is, even if they're reporting on the basic facts, it's all about
[40:06.600 --> 40:09.600]  distracting you from what's really going on.
[40:09.600 --> 40:14.880]  Like Trump doesn't need an emergency to build the wall, he could do it with existing military
[40:14.880 --> 40:18.320]  funds with a selective emergency by declaring it an emergency.
[40:18.320 --> 40:27.360]  He needs it to circumvent and remove these networks Obama put in under an emergency.
[40:27.360 --> 40:30.440]  And of course, we're next year's news today, I've been telling you this since Trump got
[40:30.440 --> 40:35.560]  in, he's got to declare the emergency to override the previous emergency.
[40:35.560 --> 40:41.880]  And I'm telling you now, in fact, here's the takeaway that upfront, I wanted to know, Obama
[40:41.880 --> 40:46.000]  and the neocons know there's a populist uprising worldwide.
[40:46.000 --> 40:54.880]  They thought Hillary was going to win, but even if she did win or didn't win, they were
[40:54.880 --> 41:04.200]  going to incrementally in the internet as we know it.
[41:04.200 --> 41:12.520]  And it's here, and it's the old saying of first they came for this group and they came
[41:12.520 --> 41:15.780]  for that group and when they came for me, there was nobody left to stand up for me.
[41:15.780 --> 41:20.280]  This is an exact plan where you pick off one person and then another and then another and
[41:20.280 --> 41:23.520]  then a whole group and then thousands in a day and thousands the next day and thousands
[41:23.520 --> 41:24.520]  the next day.
[41:24.520 --> 41:25.760]  And then you, then you, oh, people are getting upset.
[41:25.760 --> 41:26.760]  Let's cycle back.
[41:26.760 --> 41:27.760]  Okay, we're going to quit.
[41:27.760 --> 41:30.280]  We apologize for Franklin Graham.
[41:30.280 --> 41:36.040]  Oh, we apologize for Gavin McGinnis on YouTube.
[41:36.040 --> 41:39.960]  And then they take him down later.
[41:39.960 --> 41:45.160]  And so it's, it's all a psychological plan and only by being aware of it, only by being
[41:45.160 --> 41:51.680]  conscious of it, only by understanding it do we have any chance to beat it.
[41:51.680 --> 41:54.480]  So again, normally I get up here and I talk about one of these issues and all I do is
[41:54.480 --> 41:57.720]  you start showing you article after article showing different pieces, how they're spinning,
[41:57.720 --> 42:00.600]  how they're lying, how they're admitting, how it all goes together.
[42:00.600 --> 42:02.480]  And then I never actually get to the big picture.
[42:02.480 --> 42:05.640]  I just got to the big picture, told you exactly what's going on.
[42:05.640 --> 42:09.640]  Now when we come back, I'll go over all the articles and the proof and the legislation
[42:09.640 --> 42:12.440]  and the video clips of senators admitting it.
[42:12.440 --> 42:17.440]  And then we got a bunch of big guests coming up today.
[42:17.440 --> 42:19.200]  But this is it.
[42:19.200 --> 42:21.360]  And I want to explain it.
[42:21.360 --> 42:26.120]  It's not just that they're going to put over what you're doing on your phone or your computer
[42:26.120 --> 42:33.760]  or your Alexa or your other home quote device that's spying on you, your good little minder.
[42:33.760 --> 42:40.240]  It's that when you go to Alexa and say, Alexa, pull up Alex Jones in FullWars.com, at first
[42:40.240 --> 42:42.960]  is going to say, that's fake news and a bad person.
[42:42.960 --> 42:47.400]  But okay, later it's going to say, I'm reporting you for doing that.
[42:47.400 --> 42:49.040]  And by the way, I've been listening to you.
[42:49.040 --> 42:53.040]  And later it's not going to even let you know it's just not going to let you go there and
[42:53.040 --> 42:54.040]  not respond.
[42:54.040 --> 42:56.240]  They actually admit that in the documents too.
[42:56.240 --> 42:59.200]  A robot in your house controlling what you listen to.
[42:59.200 --> 43:03.240]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[43:03.240 --> 43:08.480]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[43:08.480 --> 43:13.720]  It literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers,
[43:13.720 --> 43:18.280]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[43:18.280 --> 43:22.400]  First seaweed based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source and the globalists
[43:22.400 --> 43:24.360]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[43:24.360 --> 43:29.200]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[43:29.200 --> 43:30.200]  That's been incredible.
[43:30.200 --> 43:35.600]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[43:35.600 --> 43:40.320]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists and others showed
[43:40.320 --> 43:45.320]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[43:45.320 --> 43:51.880]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available.
[43:51.880 --> 43:54.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[43:54.960 --> 43:55.960]  discovery.
[43:55.960 --> 44:11.360]  That's what I'm talking about at M4sTour.com, with M4 Select, it's the full spectrum of
[44:11.360 --> 44:16.560]  my Patriot supply, one of the top most respected companies out there, but because I private
[44:16.560 --> 44:22.240]  label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't
[44:22.240 --> 44:23.240]  able to do.
[44:23.240 --> 44:27.400]  So I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food, so it's a total
[44:27.400 --> 44:28.400]  win-win.
[44:28.400 --> 44:34.280]  We have those incredible sell prices back at M4sTour.com, on M4 Select, storeable foods,
[44:34.280 --> 44:38.520]  they've got special diet foods, they've got three month supplies, your supplies, weak
[44:38.520 --> 44:41.680]  emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there.
[44:41.680 --> 44:45.520]  If you've got a three year supply, if stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[44:45.520 --> 44:48.080]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[44:48.080 --> 44:53.040]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[44:53.040 --> 45:00.120]  M4sTour.com and M4 Select, high quality, storeable foods, powered by my Patriot supply.
[45:00.120 --> 45:06.080]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage and that's why we need you to go to the site
[45:06.080 --> 45:11.080]  now, if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider
[45:11.080 --> 45:19.800]  a contribution, $25, $50, $250, even $500 would be of God's end to our important work
[45:19.800 --> 45:25.800]  here, to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they
[45:25.800 --> 45:55.760]  want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[45:55.760 --> 46:00.720]  You're helping spreading it and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[46:00.720 --> 46:05.760]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[46:05.760 --> 46:10.320]  InfoWords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[46:10.320 --> 46:13.760]  justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[46:13.760 --> 46:16.480]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[46:16.480 --> 46:20.520]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had
[46:20.520 --> 46:24.760]  no future if we didn't do this, so we've already had incredible success.
[46:24.760 --> 46:29.680]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[46:29.680 --> 46:34.520]  why we've been made the main target and if you financially support us and if you spread
[46:34.520 --> 46:40.200]  the word about our articles and videos, infowords.com, we won't just continue to stand up against
[46:40.200 --> 46:43.200]  these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[46:43.200 --> 46:47.840]  We have huge sales, infowords.com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping
[46:47.840 --> 46:51.320]  cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce
[46:51.320 --> 46:53.280]  and you're right to the market.
[46:53.280 --> 46:56.960]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globe will swing with.
[46:56.960 --> 47:26.920]  This is InfoWars Darker Sour, with your support, I'm counting on you.
[47:26.960 --> 47:39.840]  The Ragtag Man, to break the revolution, some would make him change, others couldn't
[47:39.840 --> 47:53.320]  stand for that, the cross was a solution, but he rose again, wise men follow him, they
[47:53.320 --> 48:00.880]  ain't god for the Ragtag Man.
[48:00.880 --> 48:04.480]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[48:04.480 --> 48:10.480]  The inventor of the internet, who's not Al Gore, he's a British scientist who's credited
[48:10.480 --> 48:16.760]  with the final pieces of it for contributing the most, has said last year and this year
[48:16.760 --> 48:21.400]  that a global authoritarianism is taking the web over, a technocracy that the big tech
[48:21.400 --> 48:26.640]  companies have totally sold out to evil and that he has been feverishly working with other
[48:26.640 --> 48:31.200]  top scientists to try to combat them.
[48:31.200 --> 48:34.520]  And in the past, when those fellows talk, they'd be all over wired, they'd be all over
[48:34.520 --> 48:38.040]  the Wall Street Journal, when these inventors of the web talk now about authoritarianism,
[48:38.040 --> 48:41.680]  you have to read it in local newspapers.
[48:41.680 --> 48:46.440]  Father a worldwide web launches platform which aims to radically decentralize the net, intends
[48:46.440 --> 48:50.480]  to end the dominance of Facebook, Google, Amazon, with the process of letting individuals
[48:50.480 --> 48:56.080]  take back control of their data.
[48:56.080 --> 49:09.840]  That's Tim Barron's, Tim Berns Lee, now here's the problem with this, when you get hit with
[49:09.840 --> 49:17.280]  an authoritarianism this big and people don't know what they're facing and you have almost
[49:17.280 --> 49:27.160]  like 20th century technology finding a time machine and going back and fighting primitive
[49:27.160 --> 49:31.840]  tribes or something, the primitive tribes have no chance.
[49:31.840 --> 49:40.160]  And because the old governing political class who are 65, 70, 80 years old are playing golf
[49:40.160 --> 49:44.520]  all day and barely know how the internet works, they're allowing the technocracy and these
[49:44.520 --> 49:50.280]  tech heads and traders inside US intelligence and multinationals and the chai comms to literally
[49:50.280 --> 49:55.560]  set up the end of civilization as we know it.
[49:55.560 --> 50:03.640]  When it comes to basic freedom, Julian Assange's last video interview before blackout, he said
[50:03.640 --> 50:08.600]  this generation being born right now is the last to have any freedom ever.
[50:08.600 --> 50:15.040]  And that's really the sad thing here is that the inventors of the internet and top journalists
[50:15.040 --> 50:24.880]  all say exactly what I say because it's what's happening and it's very, very sad.
[50:24.880 --> 50:33.080]  And then I knew that the next level was going to be device control because we've seen Apple
[50:33.080 --> 50:37.840]  do all sorts of things not letting people even not just access iTunes but not even
[50:37.840 --> 50:45.200]  use the RSS reader on iPhones to get to our RSS feed.
[50:45.200 --> 50:49.880]  And I didn't believe it when listeners found it and I told the tech guys, we got an outside
[50:49.880 --> 50:54.600]  big company, they said yeah, we've never seen this before but we believe this is the next
[50:54.600 --> 51:04.400]  level of control, URLs blocked at the device level and then boom, Microsoft and all the
[51:04.400 --> 51:10.880]  rest of them are announcing in corporate papers that oh, we put the function in years ago
[51:10.880 --> 51:16.240]  but we're going to go live with it at schools, universities, military bases and on people's
[51:16.240 --> 51:21.320]  devices without opting in.
[51:21.320 --> 51:25.840]  Where you try to go to infowars.com and it pops up, Snopes and the Southern Property
[51:25.840 --> 51:31.120]  Law Center and all these other criminal groups in my view and says hey, this is a fake guy
[51:31.120 --> 51:35.120]  that's a Nazi or he says the moon landings didn't happen, we're fact checkers, we're
[51:35.120 --> 51:42.000]  God, we're Jim Acosta and we say you don't want to go there and then you know what the
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.000]  next step is.
[51:43.000 --> 51:46.480]  Obviously, you're putting it out of base which they've already been doing, oh you're a bad
[51:46.480 --> 51:49.600]  person so what they're doing is getting you used to a minder.
[51:49.600 --> 51:55.520]  Now one of the crew in there, Matt is a smart guy, he goes man, it's almost like this is
[51:55.520 --> 52:00.000]  the Chinese social score is already here and I said yeah Matt, that's next segment, that's
[52:00.000 --> 52:03.600]  what I was going to end with on this before we shift gears on the other issues.
[52:03.600 --> 52:09.720]  This is worth 100 hours, not just one hour, let's talk about it.
[52:09.720 --> 52:16.000]  The entire Chinese global social score system didn't start there, it started here but yes,
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.840]  it's being adopted in Latin America, it's being adopted in Africa because when the Chinese
[52:19.840 --> 52:23.680]  come in they say we're going to build roads and railroads and all this but you have to
[52:23.680 --> 52:30.720]  adopt your government does, our computers that spy on you and run everything you do and
[52:30.720 --> 52:34.760]  you've got to sign over your ports and everything to us and we're going to watch everything
[52:34.760 --> 52:42.040]  your citizens do so starting next year, they've already done it as a pilot project with all
[52:42.040 --> 52:46.560]  the party members, this is just the Google project Dragonfly that they say we've never
[52:46.560 --> 52:51.400]  heard of, it just doesn't exist, remember first a few months ago it didn't exist and
[52:51.400 --> 52:55.840]  Sundar goes oh, I don't really pay attention to it, we don't even know we're going to
[52:55.840 --> 52:56.840]  do it.
[52:56.840 --> 53:04.080]  Dragonfly is the global model and we already have it, Dragonfly watches what you do on
[53:04.080 --> 53:08.840]  your phone and puts it into a scoring system and has government minders watching where
[53:08.840 --> 53:13.560]  you go in live time and even messaging you when you're doing things they don't like
[53:13.560 --> 53:20.400]  and it's the by law starting next year in China, everyone will be given a phone that
[53:20.400 --> 53:28.200]  listens to you, that watches you, that's your minder and then if you don't play ball you
[53:28.200 --> 53:32.320]  can't move one inch, that's the government quote.
[53:32.320 --> 53:36.760]  So that's what they're doing here, that's what they're doing there and so all of us
[53:36.760 --> 53:42.480]  are going to be prisoners and literally George Soros funded groups are already banning Franklin
[53:42.480 --> 53:47.880]  Graham and will ban everybody and are already live time in your phone, not just a computer
[53:47.880 --> 53:52.520]  program that puts feeds up on your phone, not the website you go to, they're just getting
[53:52.520 --> 53:57.160]  you used to that like oh, I went to a website, you know, I went to Google or I went to YouTube
[53:57.160 --> 54:01.480]  or I went to Twitter or I went to Facebook and I went to my local church and you know
[54:01.480 --> 54:05.160]  somebody didn't like the fact that they gave up your anti-abortion speech so it says something
[54:05.160 --> 54:09.160]  about your church, you're like well that's weird, it won't be on the website they're
[54:09.160 --> 54:16.440]  doing it, it's going to be on your phone and you know what that means, they admit, literal
[54:16.440 --> 54:22.040]  university control freaks, antifa, scum of the earth, all of them are who they're hiring,
[54:22.040 --> 54:26.360]  top security clearances to reality winner who joined ISIS and said all whites should die
[54:26.360 --> 54:33.480]  and she was white, these are the people that are going to be live time in your phone, it's
[54:33.480 --> 54:36.800]  not just going to be Twitter where they read your private messages and share them and we
[54:36.800 --> 54:42.480]  have all the Veritas videos laughing about it or all of this, it's sick and guess who
[54:42.480 --> 54:48.840]  they are now hiring to man the whole thing, university professors, antifa, leftist but
[54:48.840 --> 54:54.600]  all the out of work or would be out of work, major newspapers, New York Times, Washington
[54:54.600 --> 54:59.720]  Post, all of them are now like little intelligence agencies, that's what's running all this and
[54:59.720 --> 55:05.520]  they live time get into your account and they look at all your sponsors on YouTube and they
[55:05.520 --> 55:10.120]  start contacting them and you never even know why you lose them and they admit this, criminal
[55:10.120 --> 55:15.880]  racketeering outside third parties in, you're about Facebook letting outside parties into
[55:15.880 --> 55:20.040]  your thing, yeah that's what they do but the New York Times is on undercover video saying
[55:20.040 --> 55:24.800]  yeah we're in Alex Jones' private account, that son of a bitch used to make $5 million
[55:24.800 --> 55:30.240]  a year off of YouTube, we cut it down to $500,000, he's almost crippled, yeah he's our number
[55:30.240 --> 55:35.040]  one enemy, that veterans and anybody that has American flags, that's a quote, well who
[55:35.040 --> 55:41.000]  do you target, American flags, the New York Times like yeah we're in the interface, we
[55:41.000 --> 55:52.840]  can read all their private messages, everything, yeah, and now it's everybody and Tot Neocons
[55:52.840 --> 55:58.240]  defense department think tanks on stages in Germany three months ago said you think the
[55:58.240 --> 56:05.440]  censorship's good now, we're banning everybody by the end of next year and we're gonna have
[56:05.440 --> 56:11.000]  a lot and guess who controls it, Neocon Bushites and it's all right here in these articles
[56:11.000 --> 56:17.960]  I'm in Forwards.com and they're bragging up there at defense meetings about how the enemies
[56:17.960 --> 56:23.800]  of the people and how they're gonna shut everybody off and take your bank accounts and they laugh
[56:23.800 --> 56:37.800]  about you being homeless, just like the Nazis put Jews in the genos and we've got all these
[56:37.800 --> 56:41.520]  clips of congressmen I haven't gotten to yet saying ban me, we'll play those next segment
[56:41.520 --> 56:48.560]  but here it was back in February of 2018, so I was saying six, seven months ago I guess
[56:48.560 --> 56:51.920]  that's really ten months ago, God time flies so I was wrong, I said six, seven months it
[56:51.920 --> 56:56.840]  was ten months ago, hold on to your ten full hat Alex Jones, your YouTube's coming for
[56:56.840 --> 57:00.120]  you, this is an article about the Wall Street Journal article, it's behind the paywall but
[57:00.120 --> 57:03.760]  you can still go find it and it just says we're taking the web over, we're ending the
[57:03.760 --> 57:11.440]  internet and Google engineers quit and said you're breaking the internet, they said that.
[57:11.440 --> 57:17.640]  Google Soros funds Facebook new fact checkers, that's a newsbusters article, how a Neocon
[57:17.640 --> 57:22.760]  bat fact checker plans to wage war independent news, Mint Press is the best article, it's
[57:22.760 --> 57:27.560]  up on infowars.com today, it's like, I'm not gonna say it, it's live, it's 25 years
[57:27.560 --> 57:31.800]  long and it goes through all of how they're gonna do it and how they're gonna ban liberals,
[57:31.800 --> 57:37.360]  conservatives, everybody, it's all over, they're ending the internet except it's a psychology
[57:37.360 --> 57:41.920]  experiment, a giant reeducation camp where it's 100,000 now they plan to leverage it
[57:41.920 --> 57:46.560]  up to about 10 million people whose jobs will be watching everything you do and telling
[57:46.560 --> 57:52.880]  you what to do over the smartphone, defeat the globalist, hashtag Alex Jones, defeat
[57:52.880 --> 57:59.320]  the pedophiles, hashtag Alex Jones, defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with

[58:17.480 --> 58:22.000]  the censors now and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we
[58:22.000 --> 58:27.880]  are unstoppable together, we've already changed the world together with our laser focus, do
[58:27.880 --> 58:33.680]  it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere

[58:38.680 --> 58:42.760]  rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[58:42.760 --> 58:50.720]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[58:50.720 --> 58:56.800]  Stress is a natural part of life where family, friends and everyday accidents can put a lot
[58:56.800 --> 58:59.440]  of strain on the body and your mood.

[59:53.480 --> 01:00:22.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:27.920]  Recently, many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated effort to censor content
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.920]  from broadcaster Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.240]  They're never going to remove him.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.240]  That's crazy.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.240]  That's too far.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.240]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.240]  This is about freedom.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:41.960]  Trump's election and Alex Jones' popularity are merely symptoms of a corrupt and failed
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.960]  status quo.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.960]  You have about 800 million followers.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.960]  That's why you're banned.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.960]  Social media censorship.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:54.400]  Virtually every day, the big tech companies censor someone else whose political opinions
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.400]  they disagree with.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:01.400]  Facebook censor our free speech and shame on the ones that don't even see that we have
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.400]  been censored.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.400]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.400]  them from speaking.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:10.400]  They've broken their algorithm to try to steal this election.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.400]  Now they're down to the left corners of the Internet.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.560]  Oh, no, conservatives can speak to one another.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:17.840]  We must shut it up.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.840]  People know what's true.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.840]  They can smell it.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.840]  You can't stop them from knowing that.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:30.760]  You know, a lot of times we cover the big breaking news today, but most of the time
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.680]  we create the talking points that defend humanity in the future and break down what's happening.
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.000]  And so I'm going to explain it again.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.200]  And we're going to do all the rest of the news in the next few segments.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.840]  Millie Weaver's joining us and then Cassandra Fairbanks who got into talk to Julian Assange.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.280]  Nobody can even get into talk to him hardly and no mainstream media will interview him
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.280]  now.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.280]  He's not the darling anymore.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.840]  And the conditions he's in have really deteriorated.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.840]  So we're going to be looking at that coming up.
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:04.720]  But getting back to just news so insane, so incredible, but you knew it was going there
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.480]  that they're not just going to go ban all the conservatives or nationalists or Christians
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.560]  off the internet, like Frank and Grant.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:17.160]  Now it's going to hire magic wand waving internet police from the Southern Prairie
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:24.840]  Law Center and from the universities and from George Soros funding groups like they've done
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.280]  and call themselves fact checkers.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.760]  So is that like that makes their lives true?
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:30.040]  Jim Acosta is a big fact checker.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.000]  I guess the devil, I'll call it.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.720]  The devil is the fact checker and he says, Jesus is bad.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.880]  Well, he's a fact checker.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:42.880]  So Jesus is bad now all the new, not just all the new phones, they all have the programs
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:46.200]  on them starting now, it's already being phased in.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.960]  All of your phones won't just have it popping up.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:03:00.760]  No, but groups like News Guard, Oh, the News Guard, Oh, how news killer speech killer.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:05.400]  Guarding under the destruction of free speech, this neocon run consortium that has this bland
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.400]  name.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.400]  They're not liberals.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.400]  They're neocons.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.400]  And Silicon Valley loves them.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.600]  They're going to be in all your phones.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.200]  But News Guard is actually a template where all the other fact checking groups can then
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:21.880]  fence who they are, you know, you break into somebody's house and steal their jewelry.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:25.120]  Well, you go and you sell it through somebody else.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.360]  You don't go take it in yourself.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:30.480]  So it's like, oh, folks are getting the Democratic Party and the globalists and former Stasi have
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.160]  been hired to run the fact checking and it's all a bunch of bull.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.760]  Let's just call it News Guard and it's a big corporate and don't worry.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.760]  Republicans are involved.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.720]  And you have a bunch of stories out about, oh, national reviews working with News Guard
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.720]  and they've gotten a bunch of liberal sites taken down.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:51.600]  After all, they were anti if I'm calling for herding Tucker.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.000]  So it's, well, thank God they're there.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.440]  See how that works?
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.840]  And so News Guard, it's just a shield.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.960]  Well, thank God when I get on my phone or my computer that if I go somewhere, I don't
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.400]  decide whether it's real or not, or I don't research it myself.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:15.600]  No, there's News Guard there to put a screen over my computer on my phone.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.440]  This is not, you're going to the site and they're doing it.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.040]  If sites, you know, choose to do that, that's one thing, it's bad enough.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:24.160]  Like all the big tech giants, that's just to get you ready thinking you're dumb and don't
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.040]  know that it's not the site doing it.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.880]  It's on your phone.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.680]  So now it's not just the NSA spying on you and all that.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.200]  It's all being proliferated.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:39.120]  This is how you get used to being spied on by everybody is it's, well, it's News Guard.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:45.600]  It's telling me like anti, you know, virus software that wants more bad except, oh, News
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.360]  Guard can even have tailored messages right to you.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.400]  They're going to be in your phone.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.400]  They already are.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.400]  But this is it.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:55.880]  This is your mind or just like the Chinese social score.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.360]  This is it.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.760]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:04.880]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.240]  get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:13.000]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child built from the ground up to
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.160]  support your child's development.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:21.600]  This formula uses wild anchovy fish oil, ultra purified krill oil, and wild salmon fish oil
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.800]  with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:30.400]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive,
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:35.160]  and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.880]  brain growth spurts.
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:43.240]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.600]  refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:51.000]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:05.560]  Try Honor Roll from InfowarsLife at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:30.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:48.360]  I'm watching the midterms, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:56.080]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:16.280]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:37.800]  And you would think everybody in the countries is like, to the bunker.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:08:11.440]  I just spent the entire last hour getting into the establishment trade publications,
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:17.560]  talking about how excited they are that if you think the purge of nationalist Christians
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:22.760]  and conservatives and gun owners off the internet, not just here in the US, but all of the world
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:32.560]  was incredible in 2018 and 2017, that this year, they're going to have a consortium.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:37.960]  This is mainstream news of intelligence agencies, Democratic Party operatives, neocon Republicans,
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:46.040]  they admit, with the Southern Poverty Law Center and other very dangerous private intelligence
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:55.800]  agencies, interfaced through a computer program already loaded on all the phones and devices.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:01.080]  They've been setting this up for a long time, this is the Trojan Horse, to take control
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:07.560]  of your phone, report back everything you're doing, and then load articles over what you
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.200]  see on your phone.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:14.920]  Now, listen, a lot of you are going, Alex, that's been happening the last few years where
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:20.920]  you go to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, all these places, and they'll put fact checking
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.680]  over Trump from Snopes.
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:30.880]  That's because Google and Apple and Twitter and Facebook opted in.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.120]  This isn't opting in.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:44.120]  This is on your phone, and they say the next phase after that is you don't just get a bad
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:49.680]  Chinese social score, because our own globalist companies built that for the Chinese.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:55.720]  You end up losing your job, you end up getting harassed, you end up getting threatened.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:01.700]  So this allows these cowardly, anti-fab professor types that have been trained, who are now
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:07.520]  literally organizing millions of people to do this, to be part of these corporate governmental
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.760]  interfaces that watch in mind everything you do.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:17.200]  Remember, it came out a few months ago that Mongolians in the west of China are basically
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:29.120]  being annexed, and so they're putting a southern Chinese person in every home to watch them.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.840]  It says in the news that when the social score finally rolls out and merges with Google's
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:39.120]  Dragonfly that you'll be tracked over the phone and that they won't need to give the
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:45.400]  Uyghurs, that's what they're called, a person in the home anymore because the head of the
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:51.880]  household will be given a government smartphone that it says watches and listens to you in
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:11:01.560]  live time and reports back. Well, that's what this is, and then you bring it into your home.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:06.280]  Every major tech company, there's one of the 15 different types, Alexa and Google Assistant,
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:14.720]  all this, into your home. And you say, Alexa, go to the Alex Jones show.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:23.240]  Warning, warning, Alex Jones is a Nazi. Alex Jones is a dangerous criminal. You could be
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:36.360]  flagged as an extremist for visiting that site. And now they've got stuff worse than
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.560]  Alexa coming out, Facebook's put out a system that has cameras on it, but don't worry, there's
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.320]  a little plastic piece you can cover it up, but not the microphone, because they know,
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:54.960]  hey, you're putting a robot in your house. And now that robot has 100,000. They said
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.280]  they've already got them working. Remember about a year ago it was 25,000 Southern Poverty
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:04.760]  Law Center trained people. Well, now they say all total because the news is always more
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:10.520]  needs to be done. We need to stop these people. We need to stop the right wingers. We need
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:17.200]  to ban everybody by the widen clip in a moment. And they're like, so the articles are always
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:21.600]  like, it's like, oh, don't worry, we're, we're getting more, you know, aid to poor children.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:30.040]  It's like, oh, don't worry. Don't worry. We're getting all this done right now for you and
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:38.400]  your family. Oh, don't worry. We're going to censor even more as soon as we can. And
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:45.760]  so now the worst of the worst, literal anti-fascum, control freaks, you name it, all in control
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:52.000]  of your data, live time on your phone, not just placing ads and not just placing propaganda
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.640]  in front of you, but now using that same ad software that tracks where you go and what
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:03.680]  you do to in live time, report back, send you messages, including live people following
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:08.920]  scripted results. The computer tells them to basically threaten you. Oh, you could get
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:15.280]  in trouble coming here. That's the China model. It's already here being announced on info wars.com.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:21.000]  We have the videos. We have the articles. We have the admissions. It's all up there.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.520]  And is Congress really going to allow that? Is that really what congressmen and women
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:34.240]  want for their children and grandchildren? You can't make this up. So we're going to
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:38.840]  go to break. I'm going to come back into other issues now, but this is this is the big issue.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:42.920]  And here are some of the articles that are on info wars.com from 10 months ago, right
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:47.200]  through to now backing all this up. Hold on to your tinfoil hat. Alex Jones, YouTube's
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.360]  coming for you. And it's a Wall Street Journal had a huge article about how they banned me
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:54.760]  and when they were done, the entire Internet of free people. Google Soros, Google and Soros
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:14:01.280]  fund Facebook's new fact checkers. How a neocon back fact checker plans to wage war on independent
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:06.200]  media. Newsguards. This is not even right wing news. And it's got 20 pages of all the
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:12.520]  documents, all the admissions, how it's run by the CIA and the Democrats. And now they're
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.360]  bringing in all these neocon groups and how they admitted it will vertically integrate
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.960]  the industry and the lobbyists are saying, Oh my God, our companies will be profitable
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:24.000]  again as we're going to shut down competition. It's not even about right wingers or left
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.240]  wingers now. It's about monopoly. Facebook's censorship of alternative media, just the
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:33.560]  beginning warrants top neocon insider who's running it and bragging about it. That's info
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:38.360]  wars back in October. Us warning. Again, Obama quietly signs the countering this information
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:44.480]  propaganda act. And that's that partnership of government agencies, the Pentagon with
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:50.360]  dying corporate media and the Democratic Party. And then the neocons are the Republican
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:56.160]  representatives. So you've got the Democrats, the establishment, Republican neocons, corporate
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:03.000]  dying media, the intelligence agencies, and then they liaison with all these big entertainment
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.240]  companies as well and the chai comms and the EU. And then they all come to consensus. And
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:13.360]  then they're all recruiting in Germany, mainly former Stasi. And again, Google's moving out
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:20.040]  of the former Stasi headquarters and saying we're going to censor everybody. They're hiring
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:27.640]  Stasi because they're the best at this. And the Stasi are like, this is wonderful. We
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:32.840]  would never have, I mean, they're hiring former communist East German thought police. And
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:41.120]  again, this isn't Monty Python. We're not joking. We're not joking. So it's here. It's
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:46.440]  on. Yeah, that they were hiring four years ago. Stasi. Facebook. Now Google's moving
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:51.160]  into Stasi headquarters. Can't make it up. Can't make it up. Are you going to let them
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.920]  do it? You going to let them do it? Worry about the NSA spine on you? Southern probably law

[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:36.000]  United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.480]  wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England broken.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:47.760]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:54.120]  fight for? The deep state began with World War one. The United States of Empire by James

[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:07.320]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.720]  yeast. As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team

[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:03.200]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:08.280]  here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:14.960]  to be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles,
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:20.160]  and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:26.440]  a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:31.960]  in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:37.040]  the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:43.840]  safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:49.480]  on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:55.560]  and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water filtration
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:24.040]  system will purify it.
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:45.880]  All right, I just spent an hour and twenty minutes of broadcast on news so over the top,
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:52.720]  so insane, so criminal, so diabolical, so next level that it's not even in science fiction
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:21:00.920]  dystopia movies. And the way they roll it out with psychological warfare incrementally,
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:05.400]  if the public doesn't get really upset, if Congress doesn't wake up and decide to take
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:17.200]  action, we're done. They're going to censor your cell phone and computer in real time
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:26.360]  with not the NSA they're involved, but leftist at the CIA directing a consortium of neocons,
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:34.000]  university professors and students, the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, media matters, snopes,
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.200]  and some offshore male diploma group. Now that all blew up in their face, so now they're
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.080]  got Britannica on where they type in like it's encyclopedia Britannica, just say God,
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:50.560]  you know, they're sheet dipping that, but, and now all the new devices being sold have
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:55.480]  it, and the old devices have back doors to do it, where they're watching you in live
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:03.720]  time and putting messages over what you see. I know I just keep saying that because few
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:09.080]  things, I mean I expect a lot of these people, I knew this was coming, but it's kind of like
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:14.800]  you're a little kid and you've heard people die, but then you go and you actually either
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:23.880]  see somebody get run over by a car and their guts all over the street and their head broken
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:28.800]  up their body, but the eyes still awake looking around, I saw that one time when I was a kid,
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:34.320]  I saw it again later when I was a teenager, and then you see your grandpa die or stuff
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:38.320]  like that and the friends die, and you know it's kind of like there's one thing to know
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:44.200]  it's coming, there's another thing to see somebody get their head chopped off right
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:49.360]  in front of you, and you know, we're getting walked up to the guillotine now, everything
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:57.440]  else was just a dress rehearsal, and I see how they use the uneducated and the low IQ
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:04.560]  controlled by this stuff as their cannon fodder, and it makes me hate to establish one even
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:12.640]  more, I mean my God who would come up with crap like this and who would do this, well
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:16.800]  we know who, without even trying to look, because believe me I'm not trying to look
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:22.080]  as it makes me so damn angry, there's news everywhere now where they're gonna in public
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:28.120]  schools teach kids how to pole dance, but as long as it's gays teaching them it's okay,
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:33.000]  if heterosexuals did it it'd be perverted, if heterosexual walked over and wanted to
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.880]  teach their daughter how to masturbate at the park, you'd kill them and they'd give
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:42.280]  you a medal, but as long as it's gay, well then reach your hands down your pants and
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:49.640]  help them, and without even looking it's in the huffings and posts and it's everywhere,
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:57.960]  teaching little girls, we're talking seven or eight year olds how to masturbate, teaching
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:02.320]  little girls how to penetrate themselves, and by the way we're a family show, I don't even
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:07.440]  want to show this on TV stations, that we'll get complaints on TV stations for even airing
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:10.360]  this, and I kind of get what they're saying, you understand though, this is on YouTube
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:16.200]  and in schools, and this is the huffington posts and other groups teaching little girls
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:21.840]  with adults, and again it's pervert world, it's sexualization of children, it's the
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:26.040]  agenda, it's what they're doing, they're teaching you that they're going to do it, because
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:36.600]  your children and destroying their innocence is what it's all about, it's the final perversion,
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:42.240]  I mean I've got a 12, a 14 year old daughter, a 10 year old daughter and a 20 month old
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:47.200]  daughter, and I'll be 50, 60, 70 years old and they'll be grown women, and I'm never
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:54.080]  going to go find a dildo and pull it out and talk about sex with them, but this is the
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:59.320]  schools doing it, and the governments doing it, and the parents in school programs doing
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:04.680]  it, and all these parents and people look like their souls have been sucked out, they're
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:11.760]  all like demonic globs, and you know why, because that's what they are, get it off the
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:16.880]  screen, God radio listeners are lucky at times like these, see, I'm not just saying this,
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:23.200]  and I'm not going to quit, and I'm not going to go away, but they're starting to find my
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:26.760]  breaking point, not going after the operation, not trying to get the little bit of money
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:34.160]  I got, I'll give a damn about that, the fact that America isn't, it's everywhere, I cannot
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:41.020]  open my eyes and not find them abusing children in a sexual way in front of me, to absolutely
[01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:52.760]  break all of our will, and no more, I know I should get that radio, I can't do it, God
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:56.720]  help us Jesus, and remember they tried this, it's the same, remember Jocelyn Elders, you
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:03.640]  can find the clips online, her in Congress, and she was the Church and General nominee
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:11.640]  of Bill Clinton, and she goes, we need to teach the toddlers how to masturbate, and we
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:19.840]  shouldn't be shy about it, teachers should reach down and help them do it, show them,
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:28.280]  and she's saying, we need to touch your children's genitals, that's who we are, we're here to
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:40.920]  touch the genitals, because if we can do that, we can do anything, so let us touch your son's
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:51.520]  genitals, let us touch your daughter's genitals, I'm a black woman, I'm a doctor, and I'm liberal,
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:58.320]  now let me touch the pee pee, you know I joke around about it, she did say, that's a real
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:08.200]  quote, help them, don't be shy in kindergarten, in the class, teachers, reach down, show them,
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:13.440]  they're biologically humans, having their kids messed with, going to a rage, so it's
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.360]  caught, capture the flag, if we can get the parents to let teachers touch your kids'
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:23.320]  genitals, we're home free, what did Cuomo say on CNN, he said, your daughter doesn't
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:28.480]  like seeing a trans man who's 40, and really a woman, and wants to be in the shower with
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:35.320]  your 11 year old, your 11 year old's a bigot, she doesn't like seeing that woman's penis,
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:42.480]  that's a quote, your daughter doesn't like seeing, and everything's upside down world,
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:49.880]  your daughter, your 11 year old daughter doesn't like seeing a woman's Johnson, you and your
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:54.600]  daughter are bad, a man's going to come in there with your daughter and he's the good
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:59.600]  guy, and Jocelyn Elders is going to help you reach down and touch it, and now they show
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:05.040]  the little kids, oh, here's a foot long gildo, here's a six inch one, and you ram it in,
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:12.760]  you're like this, it's like, oh, Livro, it's not pedophilia, and by the way, we'll get
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:17.760]  station complaints, fine, I agree, hey, before you complain about me though, will you please
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:22.320]  call Congress or follow a lawsuit, or go after these people politically, because man, I'm
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:25.720]  not the one doing it, believe me, if you're a radio listener, you're lucky, you're not
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:33.200]  having to see women teaching, and men teaching little girls how to ram stuff in their body,
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:40.680]  soft child porn, but they get these leftist idiots all set into it, and it's total sexualization
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:46.440]  of children, imagine if a man walked up to your son and said, son, I'm going to teach
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:52.320]  you about your ding dong, let me get my hands on it right now, but if she's in a general

[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:13.920]  Defeat the sensors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:18.040]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:22.640]  because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:27.360]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the sensors now, and

[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:52.400]  the First Amendment.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:58.360]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:02.880]  Please, whatever you do realize, we're all getting punch-drunk to the censorship, and
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:06.840]  you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars, yes, some of them are like
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:10.320]  little side accounts, they even know we had like InfoWars stored, they just showed our
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:15.640]  products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be in a Trump rally and
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:17.960]  be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:21.520]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:26.360]  and the world back from the brink, but the globalists now want to target where the resistance
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:29.240]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.320]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:37.280]  I want to keep going, I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially,
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:41.920]  I want to push all the way, I've committed to do that, I've prayed for that, and I've
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:46.520]  been told that's going to happen, but you've got a back-ish and I promise you this, I will
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:51.720]  never falter, I will never waver at the spiritual level, I physically will, but I give you my
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:56.880]  commitment if you financially support us, then FoWarsTour.com to give you my absolute
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:57.880]  total commitment.
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:02.440]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:06.680]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dogs for a walk.
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:10.840]  Like me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:17.960]  lights every day, but thanks to SupermailVitality at InfoWarsTour.com, I still have that energy.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:22.160]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:26.320]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:31.320]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:38.520]  and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:42.200]  So go to InfoWarsTour.com and get SupermailVitality before it's gone.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:49.480]  This is actually our last run of SupermailVitality, so I want you to experience SupermailVitality
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:51.200]  before it's too late.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:33:01.440]  Release the Supermail in you with SupermailVitality at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:19.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:28.360]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:31.440]  Millie Weaver's on with us and I want to get her take on what we're just covering and
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:34.160]  then a bunch of other news and a bunch of clips we're going to get to.
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:38.880]  The Cassandra Fairbanks just had a big exclusive interview with Julina Saiz and reports of
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.200]  the terrible positions he's in.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.440]  She'll be popping in later in the next hour as well.
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:45.400]  You have to understand, I have four children.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:49.880]  So I used to always hear the news, the children, the children, give us your guns to the children.
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:53.920]  And I saw it was a ploy playing on people's heartstrings because they cared about children,
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.360]  especially parents.
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:00.200]  But now particularly with three girls and a son.
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:04.360]  And then knowing what I know, and I remember back in the 90s when Jocelyn Elders was nominated
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:11.080]  to be the surgeon general and her bizarre speeches about we need to get kindergartners
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:15.160]  to masturbate and have the teachers reach down and grab their genitals and do it.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:18.000]  I mean, we can play the clip if you want.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.040]  And I remember Limbaugh played it and played it and I was like, this woman is just insane.
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.040]  No.
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.960]  They already do this in Europe.
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:26.520]  It's already going on here.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.240]  And now they've got videos, they show school students and it's the Huffington Post writes
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:31.760]  about how great it is.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:40.480]  And they have TV shows with adults with all sorts of sexual devices teaching little girls
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:42.520]  how to masturbate.
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:48.880]  And I don't want to talk about this here on air, but it has to be talked about.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.480]  That's where this country is going.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:56.960]  How to talk to your kids about masturbation in a healthy way.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:04.800]  And then they want to show little kids, six, seven, eight years old, with these people
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.800]  doing this and it's total sexualization of children.
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:09.000]  It's totally creeping.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.400]  And it's part of the big U.N. plan to sexualize children early so that they basically get
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:15.720]  ruined in the study show.
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:17.720]  That's what happens.
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:24.560]  And you know about them pushing Nambla and held the Huffington Post, the New York Times,
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:33.320]  Salon, HBO's, Vice All actually worshiping that affiliate and saying it's a good thing.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:35.280]  And then a little poor drug doubt.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:40.560]  He talks about ketamine snorting with convicted murderers, convicted drug dealers, little kids
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:46.000]  on TV that perform at the local gay strip clubs.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.960]  And no one does anything because it's New York.
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:53.320]  So to make this point, as long as you say you're a human rights activist, you can be
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:57.720]  somebody that dismembered another gay man and that you're into sexualization of children
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:03.480]  reportedly and you launch the whole movement for it.
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:08.840]  You can then have small children on TV with you with the word Rohibinol behind you, which
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:15.520]  is a date rate drug, and have the kid talking about snorting ketamine, a mass drug party,
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:19.360]  sex party drug, and it's all cute and funny.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:25.080]  It's nice men who want to talk to your children about sex and how much it's fun as a little
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:29.880]  boy to be gay and be with them.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.120]  And the parents don't have jobs though, they just shop, they literally just send them around
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.000]  to different dance clubs and things.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.600]  What's the thing, Desmond is amazing.
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:43.360]  So this is the stuff they're showing on YouTube.
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:46.040]  This is the stuff they're saying is a great thing.
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:50.600]  And the whole point is, just like someone corrupting a child, just like someone getting
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:54.800]  a child to go out and have sex before they're of age or getting them on liquor or getting
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:58.920]  them to sign documents, they're not of age, they can't make those decisions.
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:03.480]  But everywhere, government wants to destroy the age of consent on vaccines, on drugs,
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:09.480]  and want to remove the parents and then have this special group of liaisons, famous drag
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:17.280]  queens and drug party gurus who happen to be murderers with your child.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:20.320]  And that's who's going to come to your school, that's who comes to your school.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:27.360]  Oh, here's a murderer who paints paintings about kids on drugs and group sex, and we're
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:30.240]  going to come to Austin and have little boys dressed like girls.
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:36.320]  We can't show this to the TV rules, obviously, but we have the footage of men with only glitter
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:39.480]  on their genitals hugging children.
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:49.280]  But oh, they're gay and they've got glitter on their Louisville slugger and it's all in
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.280]  your face.
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:56.280]  And it's so over the top that everyone just submits, well, it must be okay to have men
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:04.520]  with glitter in public with seven-year-old boys hugging them in public with glitter naked.
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:10.560]  But there's glitter on their genitals.
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:14.560]  And then you look at the crowd and it looks like central casting Brian Stelters.
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:18.120]  In fact, don't even show that, get it off because there's even worse ones than that.
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:21.320]  And I understand this is what they're showing kids and we should be able to do it and everybody
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:24.720]  else can cuss on TV from Lindsey Graham to you name it, we're not going to show it.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:29.200]  And I get stations points complaining, but man, okay, on a record scale, me showing this
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:35.640]  is a one, them doing it to kids as a 10, they're the ones doing it to children.
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:38.400]  So don't cop out and make it about me.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:41.200]  We can't even show you the worst stuff.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:50.920]  Oh my, I'm going to go to Millie Weaver, I appreciate her joining us.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:58.600]  The point is, is that Kevin Spacey had somebody who was 21 or was 18, say they were 21 at
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:04.840]  a bar and then let videotape Spacey, unzipping his pants and let him do it.
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:06.000]  I don't like Kevin Spacey.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  He's a leftist.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.120]  He's on the plane with Bill Clinton, the pedophile plane and Jerry Epstein.
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:18.120]  I bet he's a bad guy, but what if Kevin Spacey had 10 and 11 year old boys shaking their
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:22.600]  butt at Jaystrip clubs and men throwing money at him, or one of Kevin Spacey had silver
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:29.120]  glitter on his testicles and was standing naked with young boys in public in Austin
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:30.120]  and being worshiped.
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:34.240]  He'd be like, this is terrible, but oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:36.920]  He had some guy, looks like kind of go along with it.
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:37.920]  I'm not even defending it.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:47.200]  That's the bad guy to see, but oh, I mean, if a man whistles at a woman, that's rape,
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:51.080]  or if a man is masculine, that's mentally ill now, and criminal, according to American
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:54.520]  Psychological Association.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:02.080]  But if you are on TV and you're a convicted ax murderer, famous drug dealer with a kid
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:07.080]  talking about using drugs, who dances at gay bars, strip clubs, then it's like totally
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:08.080]  normal.
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:12.560]  So like I said, why not have Kevin Spacey with the Desmond is amazing.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.440]  Why not have Kevin Spacey teach, um, teach, um.
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:22.680]  Sex it to five year olds, because you know, Jocelyn Elders was a black lady in a, in an
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:28.000]  admiral outfit like, uh, L Ron Hubbard, you call him crazy for wearing an admiral outfit.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.760]  Well, hell, she's wearing an admiral outfit.
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.440]  So okay, L Ron Hubbard is crazy over here.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:35.200]  Well, what about these people dressed up with these kids doing this?
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:41.280]  She's got a woman in an admiral outfit going, reach down and the teachers don't be ashamed
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:43.440]  to get up, help them do it.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:47.880]  Oh, should we play her?
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:51.920]  I think we have the audio, don't we?
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:56.440]  We have some of her testimony about the wanting to teach your, your, your, your gender gardeners.
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:57.440]  Yeah.
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.440]  Let's play a clip of that.
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.440]  We're holding her a little bit the next hour, too.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:01.440]  Here it is.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:03.080]  Guard to masturbation.
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:09.680]  I think that that is something that, uh, it's a part of human sexuality and it is a part
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:14.520]  of something that perhaps should be taught.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:18.800]  But it's not your job to be doing it to kids.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:21.080]  And it's, I mean, parents don't do that.
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.360]  What the hell are you talking about?
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:30.440]  You creepozoids, Millie Weaver, um, there's a lot to get into the wall, the crisis, the
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:36.600]  national emergency, everything else, but the truth is they're coming for our kids.
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:43.040]  But if we let a bunch of twisted mentally ill college trash, not saying everybody's bad
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:49.240]  one to college, but we let a bunch of just ne'er-do-well control freaks from college
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:55.400]  and all these other groups literally march in and take our kids, then we deserve what
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:56.400]  we get.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:00.520]  But the problem is even those of us that say, keep away from my kids, they say, uh-uh, you're
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:01.600]  not keeping us away.
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:04.240]  We didn't take things over for no reason.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.320]  We're gonna put our hands on them and we're gonna have sex with them.
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:10.960]  So, I mean, what do you make of this and where this is going?
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:17.440]  Well, I think that Google and their subsidiaries have been participating in the sexualization
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.680]  of our children, which we can get more into on the other side of this break that's coming
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:22.680]  up.
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:28.680]  But what I'll tell you is that an FTC complaint has been filed over Google having inappropriate
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:36.440]  apps for children that have ads that pop up that show sexualized images of girls and
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:38.360]  violent advertisements to children.
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:43.160]  So Big Tech has a role in sexualizing our children.
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:46.560]  All the while, they are censoring political speech and satchels.
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:47.560]  Well, exactly.
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:53.000]  They want to censor us so they can then go after all the kids and literally ruin their
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.640]  they want their souls.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.000]  Google wants to rape your children's soul.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.680]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by InfoWarsLife.

[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:27.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:56.400]  You know, it's funny you mentioned that, again, InfoWars.com reporter here with us, it makes
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:04.120]  me so upset, Millie Weaver, that this type of stuff is going on and you have the total
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:07.560]  sexualization of children, they admit they're doing it, they're doing more and more horrible
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.840]  things every day out in front of us.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:15.520]  And you reminded me of hell, six months ago, there was a big study done of Google and YouTube
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:23.000]  particularly, thousands of advertisers and sites with sexualization and showing children
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:29.640]  porn basically, it was cartoon porn and adults having sex with children, but it's cartoon
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:32.800]  and law enforcement wants it made illegal, well, what should be illegal is pushing it
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:33.800]  on kids.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:41.800]  I mean, even if it's a cartoon, a child wasn't actually abused, it's being used to teach
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:46.960]  children that that's what you do is you have sex early and with an adult, it's the most
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:52.360]  abusive evil crap and then I went and looked at the study and the articles and they even
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:56.000]  pulled some of it up earlier and I said, take it down.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.920]  And again, this is being shown to children, I will not show this on an adult show and
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:04.000]  by adult, we're not trying to be adult in that we want to show racy stuff, this is what
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.400]  they're doing to our kids, man, and yeah, it's embarrassing to look at it.
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:12.920]  I mean, it makes me want to attack people, I'm not going to do that.
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:18.000]  I'm going to take action against them politically, but Millie, you have a great son, you've got
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:24.480]  another child on the way, congratulations, you and Gavin, and it just being a parent,
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:28.640]  it makes you even more freaked out and to see how big this is and to know that big check
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:33.720]  in general, I remember came out like 10 years ago that an internal summer redstone document
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:40.240]  came out at Viacom and they said we have successfully at MTV and Nickelodeon lowered the age of
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:46.120]  sexualization to 10, we're going to even target lower to not just the tweenies, but
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:52.920]  down to age five with full sexualization because we found if we brand them to a sexual thing,
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:58.600]  that sexual appetite can then be branded to specialty brands we create.
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:03.440]  So beyond just pure evil and to have sexual kids, they are abusing them to traumatize
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:11.000]  them to then create a neurotic fetish that is branded and trademarked by Viacom to control
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.360]  them throughout life as a customer because yeah, I bet a kid remembers the first person
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:19.920]  to have sex with them, especially if it's underage and pedophilia and brutal.
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:25.480]  So if you mentally rape the child under trauma-based mind control, that's what this is, MKUltra,
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:30.480]  if you do that, you then have them for life addicted to the product that was associated
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:31.480]  with it.
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:34.840]  Now that is evil, Millie.
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:39.080]  You know, parents need to be careful about what apps they're allowing their children
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:42.160]  to download on their tablets and smart devices.
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:49.320]  I know I myself have allowed games to be put on my phone for my young son to keep him occupied
[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:56.080]  in stressful moments and what happens is that these games may seem innocent, but they have
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:00.320]  ads in them and that's where this complaint is arising.
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:07.560]  Now this advocacy group has filed a 100-page complaint with the FTC asking to hold Google
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:11.240]  accountable and investigate Google over these apps.
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:16.080]  These are apps that are recommended for children under eight years of age and they're having
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:22.040]  advertisements that show children sexualized in the ads.
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:28.520]  It says one game has over 10 million downloads and it features ads of sexualized images of
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:30.360]  young girls.
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:37.000]  They also have ads that show and promote gambling, alcoholic beverages, violent video games,
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:42.320]  another game allegedly models harmful behavior such as teaching children to clean their eyes
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:44.520]  with sharp instruments.
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:46.520]  This is what's happening right now on Google platforms.
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:47.520]  Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:51.680]  That's the other big obsession is teaching them how to commit suicide and cut and harm
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:52.680]  themselves.
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:53.680]  It's not like there's a few things there.
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:59.320]  I'm not even trying to see this stuff on the internet and I see it all over the place.
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:04.080]  It's just being force-fitted adults too and of course there's popular, I forget what it's
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:10.800]  called, where hot women are mean to dogs and cats and it's very popular to have your eyes
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:12.840]  burn out with a drain-o by liberals.
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:15.080]  By the way, if you're a new listener, I'm not joking.
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:17.200]  If you're a radio listener, we're putting all this on screen.
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:19.720]  I wish to hell we were making this up.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:22.040]  We're not making this up.
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:27.880]  It's demented and all the while we have these Google and their subsidiaries like YouTube
[01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:34.000]  having advertisements which are inappropriate on kid-based channels on YouTube.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:40.440]  The kids are being exposed and disturbing content.
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:46.040]  Meanwhile, YouTube and Google are focusing all of their censorship capabilities and efforts
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:50.160]  into censoring adults engaging in political speech and political satire.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:57.760]  Well, of course, if you're pushing this child-harming, basically devil worship child rape and you're
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:02.680]  a bunch of satanic demons in San Francisco flying around in private helicopters above
[01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:07.960]  zombies and human feces everywhere, then of course you want to ban people trying to stop.
[01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:13.240]  Of course, the pedophile networks are trying to stop us defending the children.
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:14.240]  They mean business.
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:17.760]  They're like a wolf coming for our kids and they're saying, you're going to shut up.
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:21.320]  Look, if you come in the house and you're going to torture some people to death or rape
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:25.280]  their kids, you first like to tie them up, psychos like that.
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:29.400]  So they're just tying us up right now like a spider ties up a fly before it takes its
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:31.400]  time having that meal.
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:36.360]  He likes to terrorize the fly, likes to come over and pat on it and kiss it a little, get
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:39.400]  that because spiders, I guess, kind of like psychos.
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:41.000]  They like that smell of fear.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:47.480]  And then you plunk the things in and just, but let's see, first you pump in a little
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:51.800]  venom to just have it all kind of liquefy out.
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:52.800]  They don't bite the head.
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:54.200]  They like to keep it alive.
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:56.480]  The spider knows just how to bite to keep it alive.
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:58.400]  It's barely alive like a zombie.
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:04.360]  And then after it's been terrorized and paralyzed for a couple of days, it comes over and it
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:07.400]  sinks the things in and has a meal.
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:10.600]  That's what it did bro, though.
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:13.480]  So Millie, what do we do about this?
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:18.920]  Well, really and truly parents first and foremost can get their kids off of these platforms
[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:22.200]  and don't let them be on these platforms unattended.
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:23.200]  It's easy to do it.
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:28.200]  I know we're inundated with technology, but there have been several times where I put
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:35.760]  on a YouTube video for my son to watch educational toddler based programming.
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:40.800]  Next thing you know, a Google ad comes on and it's got a transgender man walking around
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:45.000]  in heels talking about his homosexual lifestyle.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.440]  And I'm like, what is going on?
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:49.440]  I walk in and there's an ad playing for my three-year-old.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:51.480]  So this is what's happening right now.
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:57.360]  People's allowing inappropriate, disturbing content to be displayed to children all the
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:58.360]  while.
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:01.840]  They're censoring political speech, they're censoring political satire.
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:06.960]  And us adults, we're so caught up with defending our own right to speak and exist on these
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:11.320]  platforms that we're not even paying attention to and focusing on what their doctor-
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:12.320]  Let me be clear.
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:17.000]  The need for FCC rules have to blur video of what's shown to kindergartners and shown
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.440]  on YouTube to children.
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:24.880]  Your FCC broadcast rules, which I agree with, for obscenity, we cover it up properly.
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:26.720]  They show it to kids and it's okay.
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:31.440]  And like you said, you walk in and your three-year-old son, who's a great guy I know well, is being
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:36.400]  bombarded by a man that wants to teach him about his sexual future.
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:40.920]  Your little baby that's totally innocent and smart and good who would never, I mean, this
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:45.120]  is Google trying to rape your son's brain.
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:47.680]  And they're doing it through their advertisements.
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:48.880]  That's the irony here.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:49.880]  They use it.
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:51.160]  See, it's not the video.
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:52.640]  You click the video, the video's fine.
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:54.880]  It's not the app you download the game.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:55.880]  It's fine.
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:56:00.760]  It's through the advertisements on that game and through the advertisements on the video.
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:02.040]  And so that's where they get you.
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:05.560]  They sneak it in there and the parent doesn't notice it.
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:09.800]  So how many apps do you have on your phone or your smart device that your children are
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:14.480]  playing on, that you have no clue that these violent and sexualized ads are popping up?
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:17.480]  By the way, if you read ancient Roman history,
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:21.160]  Jewish history, any history, there's cycles where this happens and everyone goes crazy
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:22.440]  and starts raping kids.
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:26.520]  And finally, normal people stand up and you know what happens.
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:31.440]  Everybody gets put at the sword that was doing this and we're going through this cycle again.
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:33.280]  It's really frightening.
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:34.280]  It is frightening.
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:41.480]  And we've seen more and more the LGBTQ community try to slowly posture to protect the pedophilic
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:42.480]  community.
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:45.040]  And what I'm going to say is that's a really bad move.
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:50.560]  I know most of the LGBTQ people who are decent humans are against pedophilia.
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:54.200]  Most people in general, general are against pedophilia and anyone that's going to try
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:59.080]  to defend that as a sexuality or something that should be protected, they're on the losing
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:00.720]  side of humanity.
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:05.480]  They're on the losing side because you know, humans, parents, we are not going to stand
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:06.480]  for that.
[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:08.640]  We are going to stand against that with everything we have.
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:13.160]  And again, if you were a mother or father and you were at the park or you were at the
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:16.960]  mall or you were at the roller rink or you were at church and a man walked over or a
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:22.080]  woman and started talking to your six, seven-year-old and pulled out a dildo and said, I'm going
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:24.720]  to teach you about penetration.
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:27.660]  That person will be lucky if their neck didn't get broken.
[01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:30.160]  But because it's on TV, it's cute and funny.
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.800]  No, it's not.
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:35.000]  And it's a damn cult.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.960]  They've got a lot of useful leftist idiots like you said that aren't even into it who
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:40.120]  participate believing it's a civil right.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:43.880]  They're being used for all this, obviously not everybody involved in this is a pedophile.
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:48.360]  They're just total follower losers.
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:53.120]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself

[01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:07.840]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger

[01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:41.040]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:51.960]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[01:59:51.960 --> 02:00:18.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:42.080]  You've got to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that if you control the children, you control
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:47.360]  the future and the evil anti-human agenda to destroy innocence and destroy our children
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:50.240]  by George Soros and others must be stopped.
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:58.840]  Millie Weaver, I don't sit there and see some new horrible thing the left has done and go,
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:01.640]  oh great, I can really talk about this and make it look bad.
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:06.240]  I mean, I was like that 20 years ago about Republicans and Democrats but I didn't realize
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:12.600]  the proliferation of evil and how many cold blooded marketers they've got on board.
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:17.840]  I mean, I've had some meetings with good marketers, some of the top people in the country, had
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:29.320]  one yesterday with somebody that very famous, well-known in marketing up there at the top
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:36.800]  and then I've had other meetings off record with people and psychological warfare on our
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:43.080]  children and trying to get parents out of the way, everybody else out of the way to
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:44.080]  do this.
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:49.160]  It gets me at another level where I'm just going to tell the establishment, I'm not
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:53.040]  going to put up with you crap and I'm not afraid of you and I'm coming for you.
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:58.040]  And we're going to do this peacefully and politically but everybody needs to understand
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:01.520]  that when I go to Congress, all I see is leftist and globalist.
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:07.520]  I don't see all the good old boys with their F-150s that are ready to fight the Elian.
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:13.880]  The UN's in the schools teaching five-year-olds how to shove footlongs in them and I'm sorry
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:14.880]  to talk like that.
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:15.880]  That's what they're doing.
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:22.400]  Everybody needs to get up off their ass and do something and that means being included.
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:23.400]  Get it off the screen.
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:24.400]  Don't show it to me.
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:25.400]  I'm serious.
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:26.400]  Take it off.
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:27.400]  Take it off.
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:29.400]  I'm not mad at the crew.
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:33.920]  You're a mother, I mean how do you and your husband, Gavin, how do you guys handle this
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:34.920]  too?
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:35.920]  Because I know what you're talking about.
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:42.040]  It's like children's programs and Disney's been caught with all the subliminal sex stuff
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:48.640]  all over it and the stuff they're in the left and these people, these are freaks, man.
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:49.640]  It's everywhere.
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:50.640]  It's on Netflix.
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:51.640]  It's on YouTube.
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:57.600]  It's on all of these mainstream video platforms meanwhile, like I said, conservatives are
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:03.440]  being banned but they'll allow sexualized graphic content to be displayed before children
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:04.440]  really.
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:11.320]  It reminds me of a recent article here where Netflix actually recently banned a political
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:18.000]  satire episode because Saudi Arabia was upset about the episode.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:24.080]  That just goes to show that these markets they're trying to appeal to are more important
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:29.560]  than actual free speech and censoring the right kind of content because you don't want
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:34.880]  sexualized content for children but at the same time we should value political satire.
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:35.880]  It's obscene.
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:38.840]  You don't put on TV people eating crap.
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:41.280]  No, you don't put that.
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:48.680]  So essentially Netflix has chosen global markets like China, Saudi Arabia over free speech.
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:54.240]  Now what's interesting here is this show which was called Patriot Act which was a political
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:04:01.240]  satire show on Netflix, I guess it upset the Saudi Arabian government, Saudi Arabian government
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:03.280]  complains to Netflix.
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:04.280]  Netflix removes the episode.
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:05.280]  What's that saying?
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:06.280]  That just goes to show.
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:08.760]  The only thing outlawed is standing up for women.
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:10.640]  The only thing outlawed is men being strong.
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:14.600]  The American Psychological Association said this week, masculinity in its classic form
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:16.120]  is evil and a mental illness.
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:20.600]  Men standing up against pedophiles is evil to pedophiles and the Netflix has all these
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:26.400]  shows about sex with little kids and how great it is and where they interview real little
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:30.760]  girls that have been raped and how much they enjoyed it or whatever and then I mean I can't
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:31.760]  handle anymore.
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:34.760]  It's the most insane crap.
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:40.800]  Bailey, I want to continue talking to you but we have Cassandra Fairbanks joining us.
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:43.760]  So I'm going to talk to her a few segments and I want to bring you back and get on the
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:46.560]  board with you if you can do it, if not I understand, we'll be right back.
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:47.560]  Pray for these children, folks.
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:51.120]  Get on your knees to God and just say, I don't know what to do, God, but use me as a vessel
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:56.120]  to somehow stop this.
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:00.160]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:05.360]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:10.480]  It literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:15.200]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:19.320]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:21.280]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:27.200]  So we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure nascent iodine and raw UX2 that's been incredible.
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:32.480]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:37.200]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists, scientists and others showed
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:42.240]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:48.720]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:51.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:52.880]  discovery.
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:06:21.480]  At 6-3 now available at mforeslife.com.
[02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:26.280]  At the conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:28.480]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex?
[02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:31.480]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's Jones.
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:36.480]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by
[02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:41.480]  changing its algorithm to marry stories like the Clinton's funny-count stories that's
[02:06:41.480 --> 02:06:42.480]  according to website info.
[02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:44.480]  And this really, this is so disgusting.
[02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:47.480]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:53.480]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:56.480]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:07:02.480]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement like Alex Jones are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:05.480]  If Trump gets elected, he's going to be Secretary of Defense.
[02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:07.480]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:09.480]  Move, bitch! Get out of the way!
[02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:11.480]  Bill Clinton is a rapist. Infowars.com.
[02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:13.480]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:18.480]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:29.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:42.480]  Well, I've known of Cassandra Fairbanks's work for about three years.
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:47.480]  I've had a chance to meet with her and have her do a great job covering our confrontation
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:51.480]  with the tech heads at some of the congressional meetings where they lie through their teeth
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:53.480]  in spectacular ways.
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:56.480]  And, you know, she did real journalistic work.
[02:07:56.480 --> 02:07:59.480]  Main Street media won't talk to Julian Assange anymore.
[02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:05.480]  He's basically been told if he does interviews, he will be thrown out of the embassy he's been staying in
[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:07.480]  for what is it, six years.
[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:13.480]  And one of the main areas Trump has been failing him is that he's not signaled that he's not going to be prosecuted
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:19.480]  and just like the Pentagon Papers and Daniel Ellsberg, the guys a hero and he sure as hell isn't a Russian agent.
[02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:21.480]  But they keep the canard going.
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:25.480]  He's a Russian agent with no evidence to then say anybody he talked to is a Russian agent,
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:31.480]  except he talked to everybody from CNN to MSNBC and never talked to Roger Stone or me.
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:36.480]  So it's like back when he was the darling going after Bush, it was all fine.
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:41.480]  But then over the Obama years, that changed to the point of he's, you know, the worst guy in the world.
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:48.480]  So, Sandra Fairbanks went over to England for the GatewayPundit.com and the amazing work they do.
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:51.480]  And it's been, you know, linked on drudgerport.com all the place.
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:55.480]  Exclusive, Julian Assange's living conditions deteriorate.
[02:08:55.480 --> 02:09:00.480]  More akin to Stasi era dissident, an award-winning publisher with asylum.
[02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:03.480]  And now there's a new president in Ecuador.
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:06.480]  It looks like more and more he's going to be sent out of there.
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:08.480]  Now, we've seen some of Trump's title level.
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:11.480]  People say Assange is good in argument court.
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:13.480]  So he has the committee crimes and should be let go.
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:15.480]  So we're seeing mixed signals from Trump.
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:21.480]  But we know Trump says pull out of Afghanistan and a place like Syria.
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:22.480]  It doesn't happen.
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:23.480]  We see him say declassify that document.
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:24.480]  It doesn't happen.
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:25.480]  We see he says build a wall.
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:26.480]  You know, he has the emergency fund.
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:27.480]  It doesn't happen.
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:28.480]  So I'm not even blaming Trump.
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:35.480]  I'm blaming the fact that both the neocon and Democrat government working together,
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:38.480]  those two coalitions against Trump are blocking him.
[02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:41.480]  And that's why I've been saying every day for months, well, really years.
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:47.480]  And now we've got Pat Buchanan saying it memo to Trump declare an emergency.
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:49.480]  Read the article on info wars.com.
[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:54.480]  So she joins us to get into that meeting to get into the article to Sandra.
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:56.480]  Thanks for coming on and good to see you again.
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:59.480]  Hey, thank you for having me.
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:03.480]  Well, I mean, the idea to go there, how he was, what it was like.
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:08.480]  I mean, to me, I think the guy's a hero.
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:09.480]  No, me too.
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:12.480]  I, of course, I'm a huge fan of his.
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:16.480]  I have been covering WikiLeaks for a very long time now.
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:19.480]  And it was pretty shocking this last visit.
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:25.480]  I mean, I visited him last year, but things were a lot more normal then.
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:30.480]  Yeah, this past visit on Monday, it was alarming.
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:33.480]  The security cameras are everywhere.
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:35.480]  You can't speak anywhere at all.
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:39.480]  And it's being done at the best of the US government.
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:43.480]  So I'm a little bit disappointed in Trump that he hasn't, you know,
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:47.480]  stood by the people who have stood by him or helped him rather.
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:49.480]  Yeah, it's Trump that famously said about six months for the election.
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:51.480]  I don't know who got these emails.
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:53.480]  It's Hillary, the one that had him illegal.
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:57.480]  He got him, released him and he said, you know, WikiLeaks has done a great job.
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:00.480]  But again, that's how the whole deep state has turned that around.
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:04.480]  So that's a real black mark on the Trumpster.
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:08.480]  Yeah, hopefully he'll, he'll do something.
[02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:11.480]  I realize that, like, he's kind of surrounded by a deep state people.
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:17.480]  But, you know, Julian Assange has been fighting against the deep state his entire career for the past,
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:20.480]  what is it, over 10 years now.
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:23.480]  He's fighting the same people that Trump campaigned against.
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:29.480]  And so by allowing this to continue and, I mean, the treatment that he's receiving right now,
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:33.480]  it's worse than being in a federal prison.
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:42.480]  Allowing this to continue is a huge stain on, like, the freedom of press and the freedom of speech and the right to publish.
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:45.480]  He's basically in the Tower of London.
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:52.480]  He's been there six plus years to scribe the conditions for people and how he's holding up because I'm told he doesn't even get a computer
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:53.480]  most of the time.
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:54.480]  He can't do digital interviews.
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:58.480]  As you said, there's surveillance cameras in the tiny dripping closet.
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:01.480]  He basically lives in describe that for us.
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:05.480]  So when I arrived there, this time it was very different.
[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:10.480]  Last time that I went, I just organized it with him and his lawyer and showed up and that was it.
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:11.480]  It was great.
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:17.480]  And that was about three days before his isolation began back last March.
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:20.480]  So this time when I went, I had to jump through all kinds of hoops.
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:22.480]  I had to get a letter from the ambassador clearing me.
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:24.480]  I had to give up my social media accounts.
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:28.480]  I had to provide the address of the Gateway Pundit information about my job.
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:37.480]  If I wanted to bring my phone in, I would have had to provide the EMEI code, the serial number, phone number, all this information about my phone,
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:39.480]  which I wasn't willing to do.
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:44.480]  But yeah, so immediately there was a completely different vibe than there used to be.
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:47.480]  But when I arrived, I went through the usual stuff.
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:53.480]  It's like a TSA kind of pat down, which to be fair is probably necessary.
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:55.480]  Julian has a lot of enemies.
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:13:02.480]  But when I got inside, they led me into the conference room, which is where we originally met up the first time.
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:05.480]  But this time we were stuck there.
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:13.480]  So in the middle, there's like, you know, big microphones and there's cameras pointing in every direction.
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:18.480]  There's not any place that you could speak in there without it being recorded.
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:23.480]  We know that the spy agencies have been doing reports on even things like his general mood every day.
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:27.480]  So he's basically inside of a real life Truman show.
[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:34.480]  And we attempted to go into another room to get a little bit of privacy because the noise machine wasn't working.
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:39.480]  And they came and knocked on the door immediately and they were like, no, you have to go back into this room.
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:43.480]  That's basically a fishbowl for every spy agency.
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:46.480]  The fishbowl with all these cameras pointing out everywhere.
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:51.480]  You tried to duck into a little side corridor because the light noise machine was probably broken by something on purpose.
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:53.480]  And so he has no privacy.
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:55.480]  And then they came and started banging on the door.
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:56.480]  Yeah.
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:14:03.480]  And so we went, we ended up having to go back into the room and we took a little radio to try and, you know, play some white noise.
[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:11.480]  And I'm trying out our voices, but it was so bad that we just ended up rating notes back and forth on a notebook.
[02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:12.480]  I mean, sure.
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:19.480]  Well, just to be clear, you were going to come publish this or was the mission different because I was like, hey, what are other angles of the story versus his condition?
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:21.480]  Just because that's what I always am going to ask.
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:23.480]  You're like, well, I don't want to get into what he talked about.
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:26.480]  So I mean, I would think what's going with him.
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:27.480]  He'd want the world to know, right?
[02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:30.480]  Because it seems like they're trying to silence him.
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:37.480]  What he once said needs to be heard or did he tell you stuff that's off record?
[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:39.480]  Well, this is the problem.
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:47.480]  He faces potentially losing his asylum if he comments on anything political, if he comments on his asylum.
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:50.480]  It doesn't really leave much for him to talk about.
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:15:03.480]  And they don't want someone like you going in and getting given breadcrumbs to the Easter eggs of things that he could use as leverage for them to treat him better.
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:05.480]  Right. Well, yeah.
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:08.480]  But they're looking for reasons to kick him out.
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:18.480]  And so anything that he could tell me that would be interesting to the media, that would be used against him to try and boot him out of the embassy.
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:19.480]  Oh, I get it now.
[02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:20.480]  I'm kind of dense here.
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:22.480]  You probably should make that the whole point of your article.
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:24.480]  He's not allowed any speech.
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:26.480]  And so you can only report on his conditions.
[02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:27.480]  Now I understand.
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:30.480]  I'm a little dense, but just Andrew, now I get it.
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:32.480]  But yeah, see, so this is the problem.
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:43.480]  Not only can he not speak about his conditions and his views on politics or general thoughts, but he also can't even discuss that stuff with his friends privately.
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:44.480]  So you're right.
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:47.480]  He has less rights than somebody in a super max prison.
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:52.480]  Wow. Inside Julian Assange's imprisonment in the high tower straight ahead.
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:26.480]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:30.480]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:31.480]  I sued the IRS in one.
[02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:34.480]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:40.480]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:41.480]  I can help you too.

[02:18:55.480 --> 02:19:02.480]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own 4 years of seeking and testing
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:06.480]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:08.480]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:11.480]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:12.480]  It's made in the USA.
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:19.480]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the m4.
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:21.480]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:28.480]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:31.480]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:36.480]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:43.480]  that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:48.480]  to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:51.480]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:20:06.480]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and m4slife.com.
[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:25.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:28.480]  A man in the Tower of London.
[02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:32.480]  A man who's gone from sanctuary to purgatory.
[02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:38.480]  Julian Assange recently said, this generation being born now is the last three generation.
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:44.480]  You were born and either immediately or then it's say a year, you are known globally.
[02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:51.480]  Our identity is one form of another coming as a result of the idiotic parents plastering your name and photos
[02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:57.480]  all over Facebook as a result of insurance applications or passport applications.
[02:20:57.480 --> 02:20:59.480]  He's known to all major world powers.
[02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:04.480]  He's a hero, he exposed bipartisan crimes by our government and others.
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:10.480]  He was Ecuadorian embassy for many years and was able to speak out instead of being thrown into prison.
[02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:13.480]  But now there's a new Ecuadorian president.
[02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:18.480]  And now they've turned into a super max where he surveilled all the time and isn't allowed to talk about politics
[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:23.480]  or his own defense because they've told him he'll be removed from the Ecuadorian embassy if he does.
[02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:25.480]  But see, that's the trick.
[02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:29.480]  He would have other things afforded to him if he went ahead and just came to the US.
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:32.480]  He'd be a superstar even in prison.
[02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:37.480]  And I think they've maneuvered him now into this ultimate prison while they leave him there
[02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:41.480]  when he really knows all the big secrets of what's been going on.
[02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:47.480]  But a rare window with Gateway Punnett reporter Cassandra Fairbanks,
[02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:51.480]  her articles at gatewaypunnett.com, Julian Assange, Living Conditions to Terrorate,
[02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:55.480]  Mordekin to Stasi Eridicinit, then an award-winning publisher with asylum.
[02:21:55.480 --> 02:21:58.480]  And I asked her, I said, why is your article just about how horrible the conditions are?
[02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:02.480]  And she just said, because I can't write about it or say anything.
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:08.480]  Nothing about anything you ever did, politics, that he's innocent, that he's not a Russian agent.
[02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:14.480]  None of that, or they're threatening to, I guess, throw him in the river or something.
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:19.480]  Wow, Cassandra, this is beyond Kafka's. This is just incredible.
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:26.480]  Yeah, it's shocking. I mean, of course he told me interesting things while we were passing notes.
[02:22:26.480 --> 02:22:29.480]  But if I report any of it, it's going to put him in danger.
[02:22:29.480 --> 02:22:32.480]  And that's the thing that sucks.
[02:22:32.480 --> 02:22:34.480]  Anybody has the right to defend themselves.
[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:39.480]  Like, even people who are on death row for murder can speak to a reporter, defend themselves,
[02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:43.480]  make the case for why they should be free, even if they're guilty as hell.
[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:49.480]  Julian Assange can't do that. And all he did was publish factual information
[02:22:49.480 --> 02:22:53.480]  that our government didn't want people to know.
[02:22:53.480 --> 02:22:58.480]  It's really a sad case.
[02:22:58.480 --> 02:23:02.480]  Well, I want to be clear. He's been very judicious about what WikiLeaks has released.
[02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:05.480]  And he never released stuff to hurt the U.S. or any other country or people.
[02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:08.480]  He released things that showed Hillary, Lottabub, and Ghazi,
[02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:12.480]  that she was getting sellouts to the Chinese and the Russians,
[02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:14.480]  that they were engaged in all sorts of illegal activity,
[02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:19.480]  that Guy's a hero way better than Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers.
[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:23.480]  We have court rulings and laws on this. We have Supreme Court rulings.
[02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:27.480]  So, man, this is just disgusting.
[02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:34.480]  Yeah. The thing about it is, I mean, John Pilger visited him on New Year's Eve.
[02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:38.480]  He was forced to leave by six o'clock. He couldn't stay and celebrate the New Year or anything.
[02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:40.480]  So, Julian ended up celebrating alone.
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:44.480]  But what John said after he left was, it's just alarming to me
[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:48.480]  that he could be any newspaper editor or publisher,
[02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:52.480]  and we would not allow for this to happen.
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:59.480]  I mean, if he was anyone else in the world, which every newspaper relies on scoops and secrets,
[02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:01.480]  there would be an international outcry.
[02:24:01.480 --> 02:24:08.480]  Every, you know, freedom group and press reporter freedom organization would be up in arms.
[02:24:08.480 --> 02:24:10.480]  They would be losing their minds.
[02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:14.480]  But because Julian has been so effective and has released things
[02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:18.480]  that perhaps people who are more partisan didn't want released,
[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:21.480]  everybody's just leaving him hanging out to dry.
[02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:26.480]  And he can't defend himself, and so we need to defend him on his behalf.
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:29.480]  I mean, we, I don't know, I'm rambling. I'm sorry.
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:32.480]  No, you're not. You're making absolutely, please, no.
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:34.480]  You're making incredibly important points, Cassandra.
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:38.480]  And I can see you're shocked, too, because, you know, you're a smart and tough lady,
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:41.480]  and I can see that you're shaken from your normal demeanor.
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:43.480]  And believe me, I'm shaken, too, because here's the deal.
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:45.480]  I'm not lacking in myself as Julian Assange,
[02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:48.480]  but I'm going down the same conveyor belt over the edge of a cliff.
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:52.480]  They've announced that these multinational groups run by neocons,
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:57.480]  hardcore leftist, Southern Parvy Law Center are starting in a couple months,
[02:24:57.480 --> 02:24:59.480]  are going to have break into everybody's phones.
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:04.480]  They've got agreements with Microsoft, Google, Apple, all of them, all smartphones,
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:07.480]  and they're going to watch what you watch and report on you back,
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:11.480]  just like the Chinese credit score, and put on your phone messages saying,
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:14.480]  this is disinfo, and they're going to read your text messages.
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:19.480]  Basically, they're being given the code keys, just like Apple did with China eight months ago.
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:22.480]  And it's sold like, oh, it's Internet Shield.
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:24.480]  It's a thing to stop fake news.
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:28.480]  It's way beyond just putting, you know, when you go to YouTube or Facebook,
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:33.480]  and, you know, they say Trump's lying, and so you see Snopes or the Democratic Party,
[02:25:33.480 --> 02:25:35.480]  you have comments that pop up under it or cover it up.
[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:37.480]  That's only phase one, and you get used to it.
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:39.480]  The average person won't know now, everywhere on their phone,
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:42.480]  it won't be on the website serving it to them.
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:45.480]  It's into their phone putting it over.
[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:48.480]  They're literally, it's so...
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:52.480]  Deep State is announcing plans to hijack all phones and computers,
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:57.480]  watch what you say and do, and then put disinfo links over what you can read.
[02:25:57.480 --> 02:25:59.480]  And, you know, that's just phase one.
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:02.480]  Then they're not going to let you go to the sites next.
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:07.480]  I mean, it's so insane, Alex Jones can't even believe it.
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:10.480]  Yeah, that's shocking and really scary.
[02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:12.480]  I mean, Gateway Pundits going through this right now,
[02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:17.480]  Google News refuses to put us into their news search results called fake news.
[02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:22.480]  And, meanwhile, people who are aggregating my story about Julian are in Google News,
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:26.480]  but my actual, like, first-hand report is not.
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:30.480]  The fact that they can decide what we can and cannot read is...
[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:34.480]  It's very scary, and these are the kind of things that Julian has been fighting against
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:37.480]  for his entire career.
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:41.480]  I think that's a big part of, you know, why he's locked away right now.
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:44.480]  He's been fighting the good fight.
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:49.480]  Were you able to see, because I've read that his, where he stays is now more like a closet,
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:52.480]  or were you just in this antechamber?
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:54.480]  Or were you able to see where he lives?
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:58.480]  I was mostly in the conference room.
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:02.480]  I went into the kitchen and had a cup of coffee, and I, you know, used the restroom
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:06.480]  and went into another office, which they promptly kicked me out of.
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:10.480]  But I didn't see his sleeping area, no.
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:14.480]  Other key points you'd like to make being one of the only journalists that has the nerve to even go talk to a son?
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:18.480]  So, as you said, most are scared to talk to him now.
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:24.480]  Yeah, I mean, he looked good as good as can be, and I think that that's because he knows
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:28.480]  that what he's doing is so important that he's not letting them break him.
[02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:34.480]  I think that any other person who is in his situation right now would have broken a long time ago.
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:37.480]  I'm sure I would have.
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:41.480]  But he's fighting, and he's strong, and he's sharp as ever.
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:44.480]  He's smart as ever.
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:46.480]  Yeah, he's not letting them win.
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:51.480]  And I think that's really great, even though he's effectively been silenced.
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:55.480]  Well, he's also a famous ladies man with a lot of ladies visiting him.
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:58.480]  So, I mean, I'm not saying that you were there to visit him.
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:02.480]  You were a little sweet on him or anything, but there are a lot of conjugal visits I'm told over to him.
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:05.480]  So, have they cut those off for Assange?
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:11.480]  Well, first, I have a boyfriend, and he was waiting for me outside with my phone.
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:15.480]  Oh, I wasn't saying you could send her. I was saying...
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:22.480]  And Julian actually signed a book for him, and he needed to take care of me.
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:24.480]  So, it wasn't that kind of visit.
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:31.480]  But I don't think it would be possible for him to have a date or a woman over because of the fact that...
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:36.480]  That point is that even people in hardcore prison get conjugal visits.
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:39.480]  So, my joke had a point. Not that you would have been doing anything.
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:43.480]  Besides, I'm not gay, but you know, Julian Assange is such a hero.
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:45.480]  I'm joking. I'll give him a conjugal visit.
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:48.480]  That's a joke, folks. Not being serious.
[02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:51.480]  Let's do another segment. Have some fun here at Cassandra Fairbanks.
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:29:02.480]  I'm Alex Jones from TheGateWakeBundit.com.

[02:29:52.480 --> 02:30:02.480]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or...
[02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:04.480]  Heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:30:04.480 --> 02:30:10.480]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:30:10.480 --> 02:30:15.480]  But thanks to SuperMailVitality at infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:30:15.480 --> 02:30:21.480]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water,
[02:30:21.480 --> 02:30:26.480]  to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours,
[02:30:26.480 --> 02:30:32.480]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy, and drive to get to the gym, get to the park,

[02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:22.480]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:25.480]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:31.480]  You know, in the last few weeks I've talked to some of the top people.
[02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:36.480]  I mean the top people in television, top people in the nationalist movement,
[02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:46.480]  top people in advertising, people that, you know, are talking daily to all the top folks.
[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:52.480]  And we went over the analysis just yesterday, I'm not going to name any names,
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:56.480]  of the globalist takeover plan of the media and all these folks I talked to are concurring.
[02:33:56.480 --> 02:33:58.480]  I know that's what they're hearing as well.
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:00.480]  So let me explain something.
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:03.480]  If you think you've seen Internet censorship so far,
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:07.480]  and when Matt Drudge came here almost three years ago, things like yesterday,
[02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:15.480]  and warned of it all and it was proven right, baby, it's about to hit.
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:22.480]  But I got to tell you, I knew a lot of this, and I was a trailblazer on it.
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:29.480]  But when I got up this morning and saw new comments by the official groups,
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:37.480]  Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, Media Matters, these other neocon groups I've got in here,
[02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:46.480]  the articles on infowars.com, that all of our phones are going to have basically
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:52.480]  private and governmental intelligence agencies spooks, university professors,
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:59.480]  Antifa, like your Franklin Graham taken down by an Antifa member who's a fact checker at Facebook.
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:04.480]  I mean, there's such wimps how they have to be given this overwhelming technology,
[02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:08.480]  they're allowed to break in our phones. I'll never forget YouTube was giving
[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:13.480]  Oliver Darcy access to my personal corporate account with them,
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:17.480]  so they knew who my sponsors were and how much I was being paid so they could harass them.
[02:35:17.480 --> 02:35:20.480]  That's racketeering.
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:25.480]  But it was done under the Countering Disinformation Foreign Propaganda Act of 1997
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:29.480]  that Obama funded, they fund the defense authorization for the next year,
[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:33.480]  where I was listed as a Russian agent with no proof,
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:38.480]  and then they had congressional hearings and members of Congress and the Armed Services Committee of the House
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:42.480]  and the Intelligence Committee of the Senate are like,
[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:45.480]  when is the Russian operative Jones going to be taken off?
[02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:49.480]  We're working on it, we're working, and I was taken down.
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:57.480]  No judge, no jury, no facial accuser, and now.
[02:35:57.480 --> 02:36:01.480]  Oh yeah, I forgot they named Drudge as Russian too.
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:04.480]  Oh my God, I even forgot that article, print that for me.
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:06.480]  I can't even watch all these congressional hearings.
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:11.480]  You guys found the one senator saying, we've gotten rid of Jones but we want thousands more.
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:16.480]  And the reason I raise that is I've got the entire videos and press releases.
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:23.480]  I could do the whole show on the CIA,
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:25.480]  and this means the Obama people they put in,
[02:36:25.480 --> 02:36:30.480]  because once an agency group gets funded, it's like a university getting funded if it's state run.
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:33.480]  Trump doesn't run this stuff unless he declares an emergency.
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:35.480]  God, he ought to send the Marines in.
[02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:38.480]  Seriously, this is the threat and danger here.
[02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:40.480]  Man, I tell you, it's incredible.
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:43.480]  They declared the emergency before Trump got in,
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:50.480]  and they have, quote, a green light by middle of 2019.
[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:53.480]  They're going to be in everyone's phone and computer,
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:57.480]  live time messaging you, tapping you on the shoulder,
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:01.480]  and they're going to have Alexa telling you that you shouldn't be listening to Alex Jones if it's on your TV.
[02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:05.480]  It actually says that if you're watching or doing something you shouldn't,
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:07.480]  they're going to give you messages.
[02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:11.480]  Not just on your phone, now the damn computers are going to start talking to you
[02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:15.480]  with some weird crazy meth head professor on the other end,
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:21.480]  broke into your computer under CIA law.
[02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:23.480]  They finally got me.
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:25.480]  I knew this was coming but not this fast.
[02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:27.480]  I mean, the public doesn't care.
[02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:30.480]  Then screw it. God almighty.
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:34.480]  Sorry, I'm going back to standard fairbacks.
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:39.480]  I mean, this is a normal response to waking up in something 10 times worse than 1984.
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:45.480]  Worse than the Black Mirror episode, total global social squirts, standard fairbacks from Gateway Pondet.
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:47.480]  You really punched my butt in the last segment.
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:48.480]  I'd noticed it happened to you.
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:50.480]  It happened to me like five years ago.
[02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:55.480]  Google has listed us not as news and as fake before Hillary ever used the term
[02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:57.480]  where we don't get in Google feed.
[02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:03.480]  So I can interview Donald Trump and everybody else gets it but I don't get on the Google feed.
[02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:07.480]  So I've been going through this for a while but to hear Gateway Pondet does such a great job.
[02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:10.480]  Here you are. You go talk to Assange. You've got the explosive.
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:14.480]  Everybody else picks it up and steals your work and then you don't get on the feed.
[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:16.480]  There's also the theft of that.
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:21.480]  It's like you win the ND500 so they go, oh Cassandra, sorry.
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:25.480]  You don't get to have a sponsor have a race car because you just won the race.
[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:27.480]  And it doesn't even make me have sour grapes for myself.
[02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:31.480]  It's just such a cowardly authoritarianism where they went,
[02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:35.480]  Jones had 87 million viewers on election week, banned him.
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:37.480]  And everybody said, how are you taking it?
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:42.480]  I said, well, not well because they're about to do it to everybody else.
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:49.480]  I didn't, I don't give a rat's ass about, I'm serious because it was just me.
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:54.480]  It wouldn't be my kid's future. You know, it would just be, oh, I'm so effective.
[02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:57.480]  They got me first. No, they got me because I'm flamboyant.
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:38:59.480]  They could take me out of context and we were huge.
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:04.480]  But no, they did it because I guess it's kind of true what that Houston talk show host said.
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:06.480]  I'm one of the weakest in the herd. Not really.
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:08.480]  One of the more truthful they can misrepresent.
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:12.480]  I was used as the poster boy for everybody else to get gang right now.
[02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:16.480]  And then did you ever think, we're going to make a milly weaver with the next segment,
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:20.480]  that when you went in there, Roger Stone never talked to WikiLeaks.
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:23.480]  There's one email back saying Assange won't talk to you.
[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:25.480]  He didn't want to be political.
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:26.480]  I never talked to him.
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:28.480]  And did you know I've been investigated?
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:32.480]  Roger has for being Russian agents, for talking to him when there's no proof he's even a Russian agent.
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:37.480]  So think about that chilling effect where you try to talk to this award-winning journalist,
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:40.480]  I mean, Assange, way bigger than Daniel Ellsberg ever was.
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:43.480]  And then you, oh, I guarantee you, I'm not trying to scare you.
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:45.480]  I mean, I'm sure you knew this when you went.
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:47.480]  You'll now be on the radar screen.
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:51.480]  Oh, yeah, I'm sure I've been on the radar for a very long time.
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:55.480]  I am not going to let that deter me from going to see him, though.
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:59.480]  I mean, he's a hero and I'm honored to know him.
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:01.480]  I'm honored to get to visit him.
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:03.480]  And if they want to come after me, then fine.
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:06.480]  But I'll raise hell.
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:08.480]  Well, let's talk about that, though, because most men don't have that anymore.
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:10.480]  And I'm not just kissing your ass to your woman.
[02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:12.480]  A lot of women, when things get really bad, have to act like men.
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:15.480]  When the men are gone, it's said women start acting like men, which is good.
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:16.480]  That's a survival instinct.
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:19.480]  What's your line in the sand where you're not afraid anymore?
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:22.480]  And you do a lot of dogged, aggressive stuff.
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:25.480]  I mean, what made you get like that?
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:28.480]  I just think that it's important.
[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:30.480]  We need to be fighting this.
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:35.480]  I mean, the most important freedom and right that we have is the right to publish,
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:38.480]  the right to free speech, the right to independent thought,
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:45.480]  to read what we want to read, to be able to gather information from a wide variety of sources.
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:49.480]  The fact that they're trying to take this away and that they're going after Julian
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:53.480]  for doing what every newspaper should be doing is terrifying to me.
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:59.480]  I just, I think it's more important than anything else that we're fighting right now.
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:03.480]  I mean, we can't even fight any other battles unless we win this one,
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:06.480]  because we won't have any platform to do it.
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:09.480]  So I just, I don't know.
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:13.480]  It's just so important to me and it was so important to our founding fathers.
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:17.480]  I mean, Thomas Jefferson used to have fake news printed about him all the time,
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:21.480]  and he still came out one day and said, you know, the truth will always win.
[02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:26.480]  So let them print fake news and the truth will prevail.
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:33.480]  And he said that he would rather have no government than no, no newspapers.
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:37.480]  And I just thought, I think that's so important.
[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:41.480]  I don't think that we can have any freedom without, without the freedom to publish
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:43.480]  and the freedom to read.
[02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:46.480]  I don't know your whole background, but I've seen the great work you've done,
[02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:50.480]  but almost everyone I know now fighting tyranny used to be a classical liberal
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:52.480]  and even were Democrats because they were anti-war and stuff,
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:54.480]  which I was anti-war for no reason.
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:57.480]  So I'm just guessing I see a piece symbol behind you there in your office wherever you're at.
[02:41:57.480 --> 02:42:00.480]  I mean, it sounds to me like you're not some right winger.
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:03.480]  You're like a classic American that believes in freedom.
[02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:10.480]  Yeah. I mean, I was always on the left up until I saw that we were no longer the party of free speech.
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:14.480]  Like I always thought of the liberals and the classical liberals and Democrats
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:16.480]  as being, you know, pro free speech.
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:21.480]  And then the Republicans wanting to shut down Marilyn Manson concerts and stuff when I was younger.
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:25.480]  And so that was always, I just identified as a Democrat because I thought that, you know,
[02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:29.480]  we cared about freedom and being anti-war.
[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:31.480]  But now the Democrats are the party of war.
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:33.480]  Trump is anti-war.
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:37.480]  And the Republicans are the ones who are fighting for free speech.
[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:38.480]  It's all flipped.
[02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:42.480]  And I'm with whoever is for free speech and against.
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:46.480]  Exactly. I'm for whoever is for freedom.
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:47.480]  Yeah.
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:49.480]  Wow. What a revolutionary thought.
[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:53.480]  We'll be right back with Sandra Fairbanks on some big questions from Millie Weaver.

[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:29.480]  and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.

[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:48.480]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:55.480]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[02:45:55.480 --> 02:46:00.480]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:03.480]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress,
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:09.480]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.

[02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:41.480]  Music
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:45.480]  Mike Adams had his whole internet go down in his complex, so he's not doing the fourth hour,
[02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:52.480]  but hey, just so happened, Rob Dube had a point this morning to me when we got into work at like 9 o'clock.
[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:56.480]  He goes, you know, Alex, he's one of our news directors for some of the shows.
[02:47:56.480 --> 02:48:02.480]  He goes, everybody's pointing out that Jim Acosta walked by this border in McAllen, Texas,
[02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:08.480]  and then admitted that there was no crime at that point right around that border fence.
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:13.480]  And so, okay, thanks for proving a fence works.
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:18.480]  Well, the reason the county, the city, the border patrol have asked for a full fence down there is,
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:22.480]  the areas that don't have the fence is where you have some of the highest crime rate in the country.
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:24.480]  And we have the border patrol interviewed by us.
[02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:28.480]  We have all this coming up next hour, start of the hour.
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:37.480]  Big exclusive, not from the angle of trolling him saying, oh, thanks for admitting that border walls work,
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:43.480]  but pointing out that where they don't have the wall is where it's really, really bad.
[02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:47.480]  And the media keeps saying, none of these congressmen on the border want it.
[02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:49.480]  None of that's even true.
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:51.480]  Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world.
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:56.480]  Northern Mexico is the most dangerous area other than their Guatemalan border in the country.
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:49:01.480]  It's insane to say we wouldn't have a border wall.
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:09.480]  You know, it's like saying that I got rid of my Jeep because it has like a 2.5 rating.
[02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:15.480]  And even though I'm not a big foreign car owner, the only SUV that had like a five-star rating was the,
[02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:18.480]  and it's a car for the nannies to drive the kids around in it when I drive around.
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:27.480]  So, I mean, I got a Toyota four-runner because it's five-star in almost all the safety tests because I really care about stuff.
[02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:31.480]  Is it racist that it has a double steel cage?
[02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:33.480]  That's a wall.
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:41.480]  So, if some person runs a red light or I happen to be in a wreck, I'm not driving a Jeep with a 2.5% rating.
[02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:43.480]  And I'm not bashing old Jeeps.
[02:49:43.480 --> 02:49:44.480]  They're not all like that.
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:45.480]  I didn't always drive the Jeep I had.
[02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:46.480]  We've got it out at the ranch.
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:47.480]  It's an old Jeep.
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:49.480]  The point is, I got rid of the old Jeep and I got this.
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:56.480]  And it's got steel cage around it, and it's as safe as a $100,000 Mercedes.
[02:49:56.480 --> 02:50:00.480]  But it costs $40,000 because, you know, I want my kids to have as much safety as possible.
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:06.480]  I'm not a cowardly person, but every day when my children drive off to go to school or my wife's driving or whatever,
[02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:09.480]  and I'm just like, man, those little sweetsies.
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:14.480]  So, I'm that racing here, and we've got Millie Weaver coming on to talk about immigration and everything.
[02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:16.480]  Cassandra Fairbanks of GatewayPunet.com.
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:17.480]  We salute you.
[02:50:17.480 --> 02:50:23.480]  You're at Cassandra Rules on Twitter, gatewaypunet.com.
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:28.480]  Other key points you'd like to add that I want Millie Weaver to pop in with any questions she's got?
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:31.480]  No, I just, we need to keep fighting for Julian.
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:39.480]  Everybody else who is facing any kind of persecution is able to make their case publicly, is able to defend themselves.
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:43.480]  Julian cannot do that right now, so we need to do it for him.
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:45.480]  That's all.
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:46.480]  I agree.
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:48.480]  But I mean, I've known you off and on, maybe three or four times.
[02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:49.480]  You're usually pretty dogged.
[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:52.480]  You're almost breaking down in tears right now.
[02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:57.480]  No, I just, it really upsets me, and I feel kind of hopeless.
[02:50:57.480 --> 02:51:04.480]  Like, I don't know how to help, and the situation was so, it was so surreal and Orwellian,
[02:51:04.480 --> 02:51:10.480]  and I don't like the fact that somebody that I admire so much is living like this,
[02:51:10.480 --> 02:51:12.480]  and it just, it feels really hopeless.
[02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:16.480]  Like, I don't know how to help, and it's frustrating.
[02:51:16.480 --> 02:51:22.480]  Well, I'll tell you, last year, right before they banned us, we got 50,000 signatures for Sange.
[02:51:22.480 --> 02:51:27.480]  Had them all mailed to the White House, and that seemed to whoever got them got pissed.
[02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:31.480]  That was part of our banning, as we were told, do not back a Sange.
[02:51:31.480 --> 02:51:38.480]  Because you get the messages, and they, if there's anybody more hated than, say, Matt Drudge or Alex Jones or Donald Trump,
[02:51:38.480 --> 02:51:43.480]  it's Julian Assange, and man, I just want to see that guy free after all he's been through.
[02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:47.480]  I would go crazy. It's almost seven years, isn't it, in that embassy?
[02:51:47.480 --> 02:51:49.480]  Yeah, six and a half.
[02:51:49.480 --> 02:51:51.480]  Jeez.
[02:51:51.480 --> 02:51:54.480]  It's pretty bad.
[02:51:54.480 --> 02:51:57.480]  Well, you know, it's incredibly dangerous. Millie Weaver, I appreciate you popping back in.
[02:51:57.480 --> 02:52:00.480]  I want to get your tag on the border, and I've done a lot of research on that,
[02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:03.480]  and Pat Buchanan saying Trump does need to declare an emergency, obviously,
[02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:07.480]  but any questions for your fellow colleague and reporter here?
[02:52:07.480 --> 02:52:11.480]  I think you've been up at DC, and we all had dinner together with Cassandra Fairbanks.
[02:52:11.480 --> 02:52:13.480]  You got any questions for her?
[02:52:13.480 --> 02:52:17.480]  Well, I don't know if I necessarily have any questions, but, you know, I've got a comment.
[02:52:17.480 --> 02:52:23.480]  Why is it that Julian Assange hasn't been, I guess this is a rhetorical question,
[02:52:23.480 --> 02:52:30.480]  why isn't it that Julian Assange hasn't been offered a deal to make a plea deal, essentially,
[02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:36.480]  in exchange for some of the information he has, and why is it that President Trump hasn't pardoned Julian Assange?
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:42.480]  We know that Chelsea Manning was pardoned, and he's out there telling the police,
[02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:45.480]  F the police, on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day.
[02:52:45.480 --> 02:52:50.480]  So, I mean, he doesn't seem like somebody who really necessarily deserved a pardon,
[02:52:50.480 --> 02:52:53.480]  whereas Julian Assange definitely does seem like he deserves a pardon.
[02:52:53.480 --> 02:52:56.480]  Oh yeah, Chelsea Manning is a complete whack job.
[02:52:56.480 --> 02:53:03.480]  Yeah, and there's a lot of things that it seems like the conservative base is frustrated with President Trump about,
[02:53:03.480 --> 02:53:08.480]  and, you know, pardoning Julian Assange is one of them, and the other one is the border wall situation.
[02:53:08.480 --> 02:53:13.480]  We all wanted him to declare a state of emergency down at the border, and he didn't.
[02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:17.480]  He has yet to do that. He was hoping to make a deal with the Democrats,
[02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:22.480]  but we all know why the Democrats are not going to make a deal with President Trump.
[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:28.480]  It's because the Democrats are appealing to the cartels in Mexico because, get this,
[02:53:28.480 --> 02:53:36.480]  the deep state relies on the cartels for funding, and the deep state controls these Democrat-puppet politicians.
[02:53:36.480 --> 02:53:39.480]  You know, you're right. The corrupt parts of the CIA launder the drug money,
[02:53:39.480 --> 02:53:41.480]  and they don't like Trump trying to cut it off.
[02:53:41.480 --> 02:53:44.480]  Trump really wants to end all the drugs by cutting them off. They just won't be here.
[02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:48.480]  It won't matter what you do. That's a really smart point, and we'll come back to you in just a moment.
[02:53:48.480 --> 02:53:52.480]  Cassandra Fairbanks, thanks for coming on. We'll keep following your reportage.
[02:53:52.480 --> 02:53:55.480]  Great job of the Gateway Pundit. You've got a lot of courage to go in there,
[02:53:55.480 --> 02:53:58.480]  because almost nobody else has a willing to go in there.
[02:53:58.480 --> 02:54:01.480]  And so, again, we really appreciate you, Cassandra.
[02:54:01.480 --> 02:54:06.480]  All right. Thank you so much for having me and for covering WikiLeaks so often.
[02:54:06.480 --> 02:54:08.480]  Oh, I appreciate you. Don't thank you.
[02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:13.480]  Well, we do whatever we're told not to do, so that's kind of the psychology around here.
[02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:17.480]  But thank you, Cassandra. We're about to get back to the border here, Millie,
[02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:22.480]  but, I mean, I have to say, I admire Cassandra Fairbanks for having to go in and interview Assange,
[02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:26.480]  not once, but twice now, because, believe me, she went through a lot of harassment to do that,
[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:32.480]  which, again, now journalists are under suspicion if they talk to Assange.
[02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:39.480]  Yeah, you know, it's disturbing. It's creepy that he's being locked up in there like some kind of a criminal
[02:54:39.480 --> 02:54:45.480]  or some kind of an animal. He's not being given a right to even express himself politically.
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:49.480]  We should think about doing GoFundMe's and some kind of campaigns.
[02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:54.480]  No, let me do a GoFundMe. He should announce he's a pedophile and then they would let him out.
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:59.480]  If you and the funds came out and said, I like raping little kids, they would let him out. Seriously.
[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:11.480]  Oh, speaking of GoFundMe's, Pablo Escobar's brother put out a GoFundMe to raise $50 million to try to impeach President Trump.
[02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:16.480]  He goes on to brag in his GoFundMe that he's gotten people removed from power before
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:19.480]  and that, you know, he's got the resources to do so.
[02:55:19.480 --> 02:55:24.480]  So why is Pablo Escobar so emboldened that he thinks he has the pole this way?
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:29.480]  Wait a minute. I'm hearing a record scratch off or a car wreck sound here.
[02:55:29.480 --> 02:55:33.480]  They don't let info wars on GoFundMe. They don't let most conservatives.
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:37.480]  Who are they letting on there to try to impeach Trump?
[02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:43.480]  Pablo Escobar's brother launched a GoFundMe page. It's all over the news.
[02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:47.480]  I miss that. Escobar's brother was admittedly involved with him. A mass murderer.
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:52.480]  Yes. Yes. His name is AKL Osoto. Okay.
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:57.480]  And he is saying that he can get Trump impeached. All he needs is $50 million.
[02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:02.480]  That just goes to show when you're on the same political aisle, the same side of the political aisle,
[02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:06.480]  as Pablo Escobar's brother, you might be standing on the wrong side of politics.
[02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:11.480]  Who, by the way, blew up over 400 buildings filled with men, women and children.
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:17.480]  I mean, this is like Tim McVeigh on 55 trillion gallons of PCP.
[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:25.480]  So you're, I see the article now. I can't, you know, Millie, it feels like we're in the twilight zone every hour now.
[02:56:25.480 --> 02:56:31.480]  It's like you see this stuff and you don't believe it like Nancy Pelosi saying MS-13 is good.
[02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:35.480]  They're good. They're good people. I'm not going to talk bad about them.
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:40.480]  They just torture children to death in satanic rituals. I mean, they're good.
[02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:49.480]  Yeah. The Democrats and the drug cartel kingpins all want Trump impeached and they all don't want the border wall.
[02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:53.480]  They all don't want border security. Gee, I can't imagine why.
[02:56:53.480 --> 02:56:58.480]  I can't imagine that it has to do with the mass amount of drug trafficking that goes into America.
[02:56:58.480 --> 02:57:00.480]  You know what the good news is? You know what the good news is?
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:09.480]  Soon as Trump got in two years ago, do you know what happened to all the really hardcore known killers
[02:57:09.480 --> 02:57:13.480]  in MS-13, the Mexican mafia, in Mexico and the U.S.?
[02:57:13.480 --> 02:57:23.480]  A large crop of them, they were already all targeted, surf teams, kill teams went and wiped them all out.
[02:57:23.480 --> 02:57:28.480]  And that's why Pelosi is so pissed because that money, like folks, we think Trump's losing, he's not.
[02:57:28.480 --> 02:57:32.480]  A bunch of stuff's been done you don't know about, but now you do.
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:36.480]  And I'm not for extrajudicial killing, but MS-13, that's all they do.
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:39.480]  And the word is, I heard is, man, there's been a lot of acid pasts.
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:43.480]  I mean, thousands and thousands of dudes that raped and killed kids.
[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:48.480]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage.
[02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:50.480]  And that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:56.480]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:58:04.480]  $25, $50, $100, $250, even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here
[02:58:04.480 --> 02:58:09.480]  to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship
[02:58:09.480 --> 02:58:35.480]  in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[02:58:39.480 --> 02:58:45.480]  And with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[02:59:10.480 --> 02:59:12.480]  You are the info ward.
[02:59:12.480 --> 02:59:16.480]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:59:16.480 --> 02:59:21.480]  that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email
[02:59:21.480 --> 02:59:27.480]  so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:59:27.480 --> 02:59:33.480]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[02:59:33.480 --> 02:59:35.480]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[02:59:35.480 --> 02:59:42.480]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:59:42.480 --> 03:00:06.480]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[03:00:12.480 --> 03:00:38.480]  Joe.
[03:00:38.480 --> 03:00:43.480]  Yeah.
[03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:48.480]  Yeah, they've been laying those MS-13 and Mexican mafia and any other mafias down like
[03:00:48.480 --> 03:00:50.480]  Cordwood.
[03:00:50.480 --> 03:00:54.480]  They're all a bunch of big tough guys.
[03:00:54.480 --> 03:00:59.480]  Millie Weaver, we really appreciate the great work you're doing, you and Gavin,
[03:00:59.480 --> 03:01:03.480]  in closing and getting into the border.
[03:01:03.480 --> 03:01:06.480]  I think Trump should be more than honest with people.
[03:01:06.480 --> 03:01:08.480]  And by that, don't just be honest about one part of it.
[03:01:08.480 --> 03:01:10.480]  People just go, what is more than honest mean?
[03:01:10.480 --> 03:01:11.480]  Like you're honest here?
[03:01:11.480 --> 03:01:16.480]  No, more than honest means you don't just tell people the truth, like the minimum.
[03:01:16.480 --> 03:01:19.480]  Like, okay, I told the truth about this.
[03:01:19.480 --> 03:01:20.480]  Tell them the whole process.
[03:01:20.480 --> 03:01:21.480]  That's what I do on here.
[03:01:21.480 --> 03:01:22.480]  And people get that.
[03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:26.480]  Like, I'm people who know why I came to a process, why I did something.
[03:01:26.480 --> 03:01:30.480]  So they really get like, I'm really, because sometimes I'm like, what is the truth?
[03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:31.480]  Okay, is it this or is it that?
[03:01:31.480 --> 03:01:35.480]  I'm going to tell listeners because I want you to know, like, that's my only superpower
[03:01:35.480 --> 03:01:39.480]  is telling the truth.
[03:01:39.480 --> 03:01:44.480]  I can't stand against the president and what he's been doing.
[03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:47.480]  I can't even critique him because I know he's overwhelmed.
[03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:52.480]  And then I look at the bizarre garbage they put out in the news, Millie,
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:55.480]  that is complete inversion of reality.
[03:01:55.480 --> 03:01:59.480]  And it, is it mentioned to moralize this or you're a smart lady, your husband's smart.
[03:01:59.480 --> 03:02:02.480]  You guys are, we have a lot of intellectual talks when you guys are down in Austin,
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:05.480]  you drove around the country.
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:07.480]  What do you think like next level lying is?
[03:02:07.480 --> 03:02:12.480]  Because if you're awake, it's like cartoonish and insane, but it works on some people.
[03:02:12.480 --> 03:02:14.480]  What do you think they're doing?
[03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:18.480]  I think that it's just mass hypnosis, NLP.
[03:02:18.480 --> 03:02:22.480]  It's like the matrix in a sense where, you know, you've got the news, the media,
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:27.480]  they're seen as the authority figures that are constantly telling them the same things
[03:02:27.480 --> 03:02:28.480]  over and over again.
[03:02:28.480 --> 03:02:32.480]  And if they hear it so many times, it becomes true to them in their mind.
[03:02:32.480 --> 03:02:37.480]  And we've all been conditioned since young age as a school children to respect
[03:02:37.480 --> 03:02:42.480]  authority figures and they put them up in authority positions by having them up on TV.
[03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:46.480]  So we assume they must be telling the truth because, hey, they're a news reporter.
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:48.480]  Hey, they're a politician.
[03:02:48.480 --> 03:02:49.480]  They can't be lying, right?
[03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:51.480]  How foolish is that?
[03:02:51.480 --> 03:02:57.480]  But especially how foolish are we to actually be hearing these Democrat politicians
[03:02:57.480 --> 03:03:03.480]  and that so many Americans believe these Democrats when they're saying a border wall is not effective?
[03:03:03.480 --> 03:03:04.480]  Forget that.
[03:03:04.480 --> 03:03:06.480]  They say there is no caravan.
[03:03:06.480 --> 03:03:08.480]  I've seen 50 times without looking.
[03:03:08.480 --> 03:03:13.480]  I just turned TV on and Fox is like, is it true there's no, like they're supposed to be good guys.
[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:15.480]  Is it true there's no caravan?
[03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:18.480]  So they're the other side, which is a total lie to do that.
[03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:19.480]  Then you turn into CNN.
[03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:24.480]  It's like there is no border wall, MSNBC, no border wall, meet the press.
[03:03:24.480 --> 03:03:26.480]  There is no border crisis.
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:27.480]  There is no caravan.
[03:03:27.480 --> 03:03:29.480]  Didn't you know that, Millie?
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:30.480]  You saw Jim Acosta.
[03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:31.480]  See, he didn't get it.
[03:03:31.480 --> 03:03:32.480]  He's tone deaf.
[03:03:32.480 --> 03:03:34.480]  He's like, he didn't get like, here's a wall.
[03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:36.480]  It stopped and he goes, there's no one here.
[03:03:36.480 --> 03:03:37.480]  There's no problem here.
[03:03:37.480 --> 03:03:40.480]  He didn't get that he was showing the wall was effective.
[03:03:40.480 --> 03:03:42.480]  That's how crazy he is.
[03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:44.480]  Yeah, you can't see it.
[03:03:44.480 --> 03:03:49.480]  Meanwhile, you have half of the Democrats saying there's a crisis down at the border.
[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:52.480]  There's children in cages, which was a complete hoax.
[03:03:52.480 --> 03:03:53.480]  Not true.
[03:03:53.480 --> 03:03:56.480]  But then they also want to say, there's no crisis at the border.
[03:03:56.480 --> 03:03:59.480]  Trump's lying to you when he says there's a crisis at the border.
[03:03:59.480 --> 03:04:01.480]  So they're just liars.
[03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:06.480]  And it really just goes to show that we have a problem here.
[03:04:06.480 --> 03:04:11.480]  And the problem is that you've got the deep state in bed with the cartels and the Democrat
[03:04:11.480 --> 03:04:15.480]  politicians are being bought off, robbed, extorted by the deep state.
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:21.480]  And so that's why they have an incentive to keep the borders open because, hey, guess
[03:04:21.480 --> 03:04:26.480]  what, if Trump fills that wall and he stops the flow of drugs trafficking into America,
[03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:32.480]  that hurts the deep state's pocketbooks because they rely on that black market money, that
[03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:39.480]  drug trafficking money, to fuel and fund their coups and their operations in America.
[03:04:39.480 --> 03:04:44.480]  Well, Millie, to say you're in Fuego is in Fuego in Fuego.
[03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:45.480]  And I hadn't even thought of that.
[03:04:45.480 --> 03:04:51.480]  They're like, it's mass Nazis murdering children, cages are dying, total fricking crisis, open
[03:04:51.480 --> 03:04:52.480]  the border.
[03:04:52.480 --> 03:04:54.480]  There's no crisis at the border.
[03:04:54.480 --> 03:04:58.480]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our official oil formula or just want an
[03:04:58.480 --> 03:05:01.480]  alternative, in Full Wars Life has the formula for you.

[03:06:13.480 --> 03:06:18.480]  And here are some of the steel slats that the President's been talking about right here.
[03:06:18.480 --> 03:06:24.480]  As you can see, yes, you can see through these slats to the other side of the U.S.-Mexico border.
[03:06:24.480 --> 03:06:28.480]  But as we're walking along here, we're not seeing any kind of imminent danger.
[03:06:28.480 --> 03:06:33.480]  There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence here in the McAllen, Texas area.
[03:06:33.480 --> 03:06:37.480]  As a matter of fact, there are some other businesses behind me along this highway.
[03:06:37.480 --> 03:06:40.480]  There's a gas station, Burger King, and so on.
[03:06:40.480 --> 03:06:44.480]  It's one of the national emergency that the President has been talking about.
[03:06:44.480 --> 03:06:47.480]  As a matter of fact, it's pretty tranquil down here.
[03:06:47.480 --> 03:06:50.480]  It's an election marred by violence.
[03:06:50.480 --> 03:06:56.480]  Since campaigning in Mexico began in September, there have been more than 500 attacks on politicians.
[03:06:56.480 --> 03:07:01.480]  According to reports, the newly elected official was on his way to the town hall for a meeting.
[03:07:01.480 --> 03:07:06.480]  Locals are calling for an in-depth investigation, believing there may be others involved.
[03:07:06.480 --> 03:07:11.480]  The video shows Mexican congressional candidate Fernando Pudon posing for a selfie with a supporter.
[03:07:11.480 --> 03:07:17.480]  When a man walks up from behind, raises a gun and fires point blank at the back of his head.
[03:07:17.480 --> 03:07:22.480]  A national anthem plays, the mayor in the dark suit, hand over heart.
[03:07:22.480 --> 03:07:25.480]  The shooting also caught on camera from behind.
[03:07:25.480 --> 03:07:31.480]  Hellily runs to the right, then drops to the ground, shot dead, a single bullet to the chest.
[03:07:31.480 --> 03:07:33.480]  It's pretty tranquil down here.
[03:07:33.480 --> 03:07:38.480]  Officials tell me the average number of arrests, a legal crossing arrest in this sector,
[03:07:38.480 --> 03:07:44.480]  in McAllen, Texas, Rio Grande Valley, is over 640 a day.
[03:07:44.480 --> 03:07:50.480]  Well, you know, one in five people that we catch has some type of criminal history here in the United States.
[03:07:50.480 --> 03:07:55.480]  On top of that, we only catch 40% of what's coming across this actual, in this area.
[03:07:55.480 --> 03:07:59.480]  So, that's 20% of what we catch, our known bad guys.
[03:07:59.480 --> 03:08:03.480]  But as we're walking along here, we're not seeing any kind of imminent danger.
[03:08:03.480 --> 03:08:06.480]  There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence.
[03:08:06.480 --> 03:08:13.480]  There's a lot of people out there that misses him.
[03:08:13.480 --> 03:08:16.480]  And his dream was taken from him.
[03:08:16.480 --> 03:08:20.480]  We have to have a conversation about restrictive legislation.
[03:08:20.480 --> 03:08:25.480]  When you tie our hands and don't allow us to work with our federal partners
[03:08:25.480 --> 03:08:29.480]  and communicate with our federal partners about people that commit crimes
[03:08:29.480 --> 03:08:32.480]  and who are in this country illegally, we're going to have incidents like this.
[03:08:32.480 --> 03:08:38.480]  You know, I think Central Cities is about us being ourselves and who we are and respecting everybody.
[03:08:38.480 --> 03:08:40.480]  That's what we do here in San Francisco.
[03:08:40.480 --> 03:08:45.480]  It means safer communities. It means diverse communities. It means welcome communities.
[03:08:45.480 --> 03:08:49.480]  No sign of the national emergency that the president has been talking about.
[03:08:49.480 --> 03:08:55.480]  They're f***ing dead. I don't f***ing regret that. I don't get dead. I f***ing regret that as a f***ing skill too.
[03:08:55.480 --> 03:08:57.480]  I wish I f***ing killed more than a f***ing...
[03:08:57.480 --> 03:09:02.480]  That illegal immigrant, Luis Braca-Montes, had been deported at least twice
[03:09:02.480 --> 03:09:06.480]  leading up to the 2014 shootings and could potentially get the death penalty.
[03:09:06.480 --> 03:09:09.480]  I won't break up soon and I'll kill more.
[03:09:09.480 --> 03:09:11.480]  It's pretty tranquil down here.
[03:09:11.480 --> 03:09:15.480]  But the story in Drudge and big story, it's all over the place now.
[03:09:15.480 --> 03:09:24.480]  Guys swimming across and big bags of stuff, drugs, swimming across the river, right?
[03:09:24.480 --> 03:09:31.480]  Swimming right across. And they put the drugs and actually the camera crew or the reporters were petrified
[03:09:31.480 --> 03:09:35.480]  because they thought they were going to be killed because they're showing this on camera.
[03:09:35.480 --> 03:09:37.480]  The guys carrying bags of stuff, it was drugs.
[03:09:37.480 --> 03:09:44.480]  The CBS News crew witnessed one of those attempts as a man in a raft attempted to smuggle two people into the U.S.
[03:09:44.480 --> 03:09:52.480]  Their crossing near Roma, Texas was less than 100 yards from a port of entry where dozens of armed agents are stationed.
[03:09:52.480 --> 03:09:57.480]  The man who was paddling actually walked across. That's how shallow it is there in the river.
[03:09:57.480 --> 03:10:03.480]  He was able to walk back onto the other side. He gave us the middle finger and faded off into the tree line.
[03:10:03.480 --> 03:10:07.480]  This highlights an ongoing issue that Border Patrol has been talking about.
[03:10:07.480 --> 03:10:12.480]  The Rio Grande River, people just swim. They walk across. They come across easily.
[03:10:12.480 --> 03:10:19.480]  But what was surprising for us to see is that this happened in broad daylight about 100 yards from that international bridge.
[03:10:19.480 --> 03:10:22.480]  Let's do this! Let's do this!
[03:10:22.480 --> 03:10:26.480]  Your campaign had an ad showing migrants climbing over walls and so on.
[03:10:26.480 --> 03:10:27.480]  Well, that's true.
[03:10:27.480 --> 03:10:28.480]  They weren't actors.
[03:10:28.480 --> 03:10:29.480]  They're not going to be doing that.
[03:10:29.480 --> 03:10:30.480]  They weren't actors.
[03:10:30.480 --> 03:10:31.480]  Well, no, it's true.
[03:10:31.480 --> 03:10:32.480]  Do you think they were actors?
[03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:34.480]  They were actors. They didn't come from Hollywood.
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:44.480]  Border sector chief Rodney Scott posted this video to social media showing what he calls repeated breaches to the aging border wall infrastructure in San Diego.
[03:10:44.480 --> 03:10:48.480]  And you can see people cutting holes in the wall and kicking right through.
[03:10:48.480 --> 03:10:54.480]  It is not known over what time period these videos were recorded and he wrote,
[03:10:54.480 --> 03:11:05.480]  In order to secure the border, we depend on physical barriers, technology, roads and Border Patrol agents to quickly resolve threats and keep America safe.
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:08.480]  And here are some of the steel slats that the president's been talking about.
[03:11:08.480 --> 03:11:18.480]  Last night here in San Diego, the caravan showed its propensity for violence once again when a large group of people congregated on the hill behind me at about 2 in the morning.
[03:11:18.480 --> 03:11:25.480]  And then instead of trying to come north or surrender, they decided to assault Border Patrol agents with a hail of rocks.
[03:11:25.480 --> 03:11:33.480]  Our agents responded with the least amount of force they possibly could to protect themselves in the border and did actually secure the border in this area.
[03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:36.480]  One agent was hit in the square in the face with a rock.
[03:11:36.480 --> 03:11:40.480]  Luckily, he had his helmet and shield on and was not seriously injured.
[03:11:40.480 --> 03:11:43.480]  But the violence associated with this caravan just continues.
[03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:50.480]  But as we're walking along here, we're not seeing any kind of imminent danger. There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence.
[03:11:50.480 --> 03:12:00.480]  I used the word rape and yesterday it came out where this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody's ever seen before.
[03:12:00.480 --> 03:12:05.480]  Sexual assault against women and girls is so common that many expect to be raped.
[03:12:05.480 --> 03:12:17.480]  Almost all of the girls working the streets in the Mexican border town of Tapatula, where virtually all migrants pass, started their professional lives still dreaming of an ordinary life in the United States.
[03:12:17.480 --> 03:12:23.480]  Shelter directors and human rights protectors estimate that 80% of migrant women crossing Mexico are raped along the way.
[03:12:23.480 --> 03:12:34.480]  Robbery and assault are almost guaranteed. The rape and abduction of young girls and their subsequent imprisonment in brothels is so common the crimes aren't even investigated.
[03:12:34.480 --> 03:12:48.480]  From October 2016 through September of 2017, more than 94,000 people were caught crossing the US-Mexico border and claimed to be part of a family unit coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, or Honduras.
[03:12:48.480 --> 03:12:55.480]  Now you'd think that illegally entering the United States would be an automatic ticket home and quickly, but you'd be wrong.
[03:12:55.480 --> 03:13:03.480]  These people were not sent home. They were allowed to settle in the United States while their cases were resolved, which in practical terms means forever.
[03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:13.480]  Of those 94,000 illegal border crossers, only 1,500 have been sent back. In other words, 98% are still here.
[03:13:13.480 --> 03:13:23.480]  As you can see, yes, you can see through these slats to the other side of the US-Mexico border, but as we're walking along here, we're not seeing any kind of imminent danger.
[03:13:23.480 --> 03:13:28.480]  There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence here in the McAllen, Texas area.
[03:13:28.480 --> 03:13:34.480]  As a matter of fact, there are some other businesses behind me along this highway. There's a gas station, Burger King, and so on.
[03:13:34.480 --> 03:13:42.480]  But no sign of the national emergency that the President has been talking about. As a matter of fact, it's pretty tranquil down here.
[03:13:42.480 --> 03:13:50.480]  President Trump taking his pitch for border security directly to the American people today with his first televised Oval Office address tonight.
[03:13:50.480 --> 03:13:54.480]  Do you think it should be, I don't know, a delay of some sort?
[03:13:54.480 --> 03:14:05.480]  Why in the world would the networks run Donald Trump's address tonight when we know that Donald Trump is going to be using it to spread these lies?
[03:14:05.480 --> 03:14:10.480]  Because people believe it. The President will say what he has to say. People will believe it, whether the facts are true or not.
[03:14:10.480 --> 03:14:17.480]  Why should they run Donald Trump's address tonight when they know he's going to be spreading lies and falsehood?
[03:14:17.480 --> 03:14:24.480]  The answer to your question, Joe, is they shouldn't. One of the most time-honored and powerful ways a President has.
[03:14:24.480 --> 03:14:32.480]  To communicate with the American people is through a prime time Oval Office address, the majesty of the setting, the request for a valuable television time.
[03:14:32.480 --> 03:14:37.480]  The President says he wants airtime. He just gets it, right? Well, the answer is no.
[03:14:37.480 --> 03:14:40.480]  President Trump, you will not get your wall.
[03:14:40.480 --> 03:14:55.480]  A wall is an immorality, not who we are as a nation.
[03:14:55.480 --> 03:15:02.480]  Have you considered using emergency powers to grant yourself authorities to build this wall without congressional approval?
[03:15:02.480 --> 03:15:04.480]  Yes, I have. And I can do it if I want.
[03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:08.480]  And so he doesn't need the Congress to appropriate the funds for the wall he can just do it?
[03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:10.480]  So you don't need congressional approval to build it?
[03:15:10.480 --> 03:15:16.480]  No, we can use them. Absolutely. We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country. Absolutely.
[03:15:16.480 --> 03:15:22.480]  It's now up to you to decide which side you're on. That's where we are.
[03:15:22.480 --> 03:15:34.480]  And Trump is moving in the right direction and the only direction he has to use his constitutional executive power and its traders in the government to declare a national emergency and take matters into his own hands.
[03:15:34.480 --> 03:15:47.480]  Our desks are now bound forever. We ask you to now take action and declare the national emergency and clear the scourge of the foreign globalist infestation threatening America and the world.
[03:15:47.480 --> 03:15:52.480]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[03:15:52.480 --> 03:15:56.480]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[03:17:22.480 --> 03:17:27.480]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:27.480 --> 03:17:32.480]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.480 --> 03:17:37.480]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:37.480 --> 03:17:41.480]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:41.480 --> 03:17:43.480]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:43.480 --> 03:17:53.480]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:53.480 --> 03:17:58.480]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[03:17:58.480 --> 03:18:05.480]  fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it literally dumps the population down.
[03:18:05.480 --> 03:18:12.480]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:18:12.480 --> 03:18:19.480]  The first seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:18:19.480 --> 03:18:25.480]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2, that's been incredible.
[03:18:25.480 --> 03:18:32.480]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:18:32.480 --> 03:18:38.480]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[03:18:38.480 --> 03:18:46.480]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:18:46.480 --> 03:18:50.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:18:50.480 --> 03:19:11.480]  X3, now available at enforcelife.com.
[03:19:20.480 --> 03:19:28.480]  We're back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive

[03:19:57.480 --> 03:20:10.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:10.480 --> 03:20:25.480]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance, rallying Patriots worldwide.
[03:20:25.480 --> 03:20:34.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:34.480 --> 03:20:44.480]  I am begging everyone watching this live show or listening on the radio to look into the facts I'm about to lay out, to find out they're absolutely true.
[03:20:44.480 --> 03:20:48.480]  In fact, worse than I can even say, there's so many details.
[03:20:48.480 --> 03:21:00.480]  And then contact Congress, contact major corporations, ask to speak at your church, do whatever it is you have to do to expose this.
[03:21:00.480 --> 03:21:26.480]  Because in three months, Microsoft and then Apple and then Google, all of them by the middle of 2019, are implementing live access into your phone where they will see where you're going and what you're doing in live time.
[03:21:26.480 --> 03:21:28.480]  We already know they've been tracking us doing that.
[03:21:28.480 --> 03:21:41.480]  But now they're going to have a consortium of neocon organizations, hardcore Soros backed organizations, about to show you mainstream news, saying this.
[03:21:41.480 --> 03:22:04.480]  Especially selected by Obama and Hillary before they left office, groups in every US intelligence agency, all 17, coordinating political minders that don't just spy on you, that send live time messages over what you're browsing on the internet.
[03:22:04.480 --> 03:22:13.480]  So it isn't like you go to somewhere on Facebook, there's an Alex Jones video, and then it puts up a link from Snopes saying this is fake.
[03:22:13.480 --> 03:22:19.480]  Or from the Southern Property Law Center, or from the ADL, or from Media Matters.
[03:22:19.480 --> 03:22:27.480]  Literally, Soros, when you go to a site, breaking in and putting it over, it's going to be on your device.
[03:22:27.480 --> 03:22:37.480]  Now we've already seen this happen in Fort Worth, where they didn't just delist us off of iTunes six months ago.
[03:22:37.480 --> 03:22:56.480]  We had links just to our own podcast, and in the iPhone browser, they blocked you on an iPhone being able through that function on the phone to get to it.
[03:22:56.480 --> 03:23:13.480]  You understand, you go by a phone, and the next level is, you can't go to infowars.com, you can't click on it, you can't listen, and they've now got keyword, and they've got audio, which is the next level, where then they won't even let you listen to my voice, it's automatically blocked.
[03:23:13.480 --> 03:23:15.480]  Now listen to me carefully.
[03:23:15.480 --> 03:23:17.480]  This is for everybody.
[03:23:17.480 --> 03:23:22.480]  This is going to totally vertically integrate the entire world.
[03:23:22.480 --> 03:23:47.480]  Once they're done doing this to political groups they don't like, the Wall Street Journal, again, a month and a half before we got purged, we're going to say that article, said, when we're done with Jones as the test case, we're going to take everyone off, and you will maybe have a thousand channels on the internet.
[03:23:47.480 --> 03:23:58.480]  And the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times will be the king fact checkers, and then they'll disseminate it out to the minders, who they've already got a hundred thousand trained.
[03:23:58.480 --> 03:24:06.480]  I have the articles right here, who were already on Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter, already practicing, taking Franklin Graham off, and taking Gavin McInnes off.
[03:24:06.480 --> 03:24:10.480]  And then, oh, we're sorry it was an accident, but just teaching you, they're there.
[03:24:10.480 --> 03:24:16.480]  Oh, we made a mistake, sorry you're back, Ali Alexander, but by the way, don't go on Alex Jones' show.
[03:24:16.480 --> 03:24:21.480]  Oh, Joe Rogan, yeah, we blocked your podcast getting uploaded onto iTunes when you had Alex Jones on.
[03:24:21.480 --> 03:24:26.480]  Don't have him on again or we'll delist you. And by the way, don't tell anybody, Joe.
[03:24:26.480 --> 03:24:28.480]  Oh, but there's the good news, Joe.
[03:24:28.480 --> 03:24:40.480]  So we're going to have a program where your administrator, if they're trusted and signed some paperwork, you're going to be able to go flag things that are about you that aren't true, and you're going to be able to confidentially talk to us.
[03:24:40.480 --> 03:24:49.480]  And Joe, if you do a good job for about a year with us, you're going to be able to take stuff down yourself. How would you like to be a trusted administrator?
[03:24:49.480 --> 03:24:57.480]  Oh, and then Alex Jones puts out a couple of videos about you to get a million views last week on other people's channels.
[03:24:57.480 --> 03:25:05.480]  And then a little message from YouTube, you need to watch what you're putting up, or your whole channel is gone. See how that works?
[03:25:05.480 --> 03:25:14.480]  So that's how corruption works, is they get you involved and they give you some power like the Nazis did.
[03:25:14.480 --> 03:25:19.480]  So remember what all these senators have said, we're putting them on the screen of your TV viewer.
[03:25:19.480 --> 03:25:27.480]  Democrat senators have said, we took Alex Jones off, now there's thousands more need to be banned.
[03:25:27.480 --> 03:25:36.480]  And they went further, they said, they need to be banned from radio and TV as well, and we're putting in systems that'll do that as well.
[03:25:36.480 --> 03:25:43.480]  Where the DVRs and receivers in your TVs won't even pick up who they want blocked.
[03:25:43.480 --> 03:25:52.480]  Oh, remember this week, don't even show the president's speech. They were trying to introduce that idea to you.
[03:25:52.480 --> 03:26:03.480]  You see, and oh, they had a big defense department meeting a few months ago, we first reported on Infowars.com.
[03:26:03.480 --> 03:26:15.480]  And guess what? They said that by the end of the next year, the internet as we know will be over and everyone will be censored,
[03:26:15.480 --> 03:26:23.480]  and we have selected corporations allowing the orderly direction of society, that's called dictatorship.
[03:26:23.480 --> 03:26:30.480]  Direction means dictating, the orderly directing of society.
[03:26:30.480 --> 03:26:37.480]  My god, the op, I'm going to get directed by Mr. Fly, the neocon.
[03:26:37.480 --> 03:26:41.480]  I've got all the articles, all the names, all their admissions, but they're established with publications.
[03:26:41.480 --> 03:26:50.480]  Or then they're mainline publications, selling you on, oh, thank god, there's a consortium of groups helping fat check, but they're not doing enough.
[03:26:50.480 --> 03:26:56.480]  Oh, of course. And then everywhere I go, everything I've said or done, they put a lie on it.
[03:26:56.480 --> 03:27:02.480]  They don't even act like you're smart. A great example was, I talked about a Buzz Aldrin on 10 years ago,
[03:27:02.480 --> 03:27:06.480]  and how I believe the moon landing happened and a lot of other things, and I never said it didn't happen.
[03:27:06.480 --> 03:27:11.480]  And I saw the news, Jones says the moon landing never happened. It's in Texas Monthly on the cover of this month,
[03:27:11.480 --> 03:27:17.480]  that Jones said the moon landing never happened. And under it was Encyclopedia Britannica saying,
[03:27:17.480 --> 03:27:26.480]  Jones says the moon landing didn't happen, but it did. And the video, I'm saying it did, with Buzz Aldrin, the second person to walk on the moon.
[03:27:26.480 --> 03:27:30.480]  Does he have credibility? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:27:30.480 --> 03:27:36.480]  Someone under the Southern Poverty Law Center, I went and looked it up, has a shield.
[03:27:36.480 --> 03:27:40.480]  You know, if the old dukes would have her kings putting their mark in the wax.
[03:27:40.480 --> 03:27:45.480]  Encyclopedia Britannica, that old respected name, is now Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:27:45.480 --> 03:27:49.480]  They just load whatever they want, and they go, well, that's respected.
[03:27:49.480 --> 03:27:53.480]  Let's get Encyclopedia Britannica. Nobody reads those anymore. We can get that name for nothing.
[03:27:53.480 --> 03:27:59.480]  And we'll now be Encyclopedia Britannica, and we'll say the moon's made of cheese if we want.
[03:27:59.480 --> 03:28:07.480]  And then Encyclopedia Britannica, Jones says that nobody ever went to the moon, and the video above is me saying we did.
[03:28:07.480 --> 03:28:13.480]  Let's see. They're going to hone their systems down, I guess, and they're not making it as obvious, right?
[03:28:13.480 --> 03:28:17.480]  Like I'm saying, there's no border crisis, and you know, Trump's a liar over and over again.
[03:28:17.480 --> 03:28:21.480]  So, when we come back, I'm going to explain all this. We got loaded, huge guests.
[03:28:21.480 --> 03:28:23.480]  I'm never going to tell you about the huge guests we have coming on.
[03:28:23.480 --> 03:28:29.480]  Cassandra Fairbranks is a great lady and a friend of mine over at the Gateway Point, and she got it.
[03:28:29.480 --> 03:28:33.480]  She had a lengthy discussion with Julian Assange, and he's got some big breaking exclusive stuff for us coming up.
[03:28:33.480 --> 03:28:38.480]  We've got so many other big guests as well today. I'll tell you about those on the other side.
[03:28:38.480 --> 03:28:44.480]  But do you understand? On a Richter scale, the censorship you've seen is a one.
[03:28:44.480 --> 03:28:52.480]  Compared to the 10, you're about to witness total censorship spying takeover by criminal class.
[03:28:52.480 --> 03:28:56.480]  Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.480 --> 03:29:00.480]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.480 --> 03:29:04.480]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill, so what's so good about Sunny Bay Heating Pads?

[03:31:03.480 --> 03:31:08.480]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S. to create the strongest,

[03:31:53.480 --> 03:31:57.480]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:57.480 --> 03:32:00.480]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:00.480 --> 03:32:06.480]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:06.480 --> 03:32:14.480]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:14.480 --> 03:32:20.480]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:20.480 --> 03:32:26.480]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:26.480 --> 03:32:30.480]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[03:32:30.480 --> 03:32:37.480]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:37.480 --> 03:32:42.480]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:42.480 --> 03:32:48.480]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:48.480 --> 03:32:56.480]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:56.480 --> 03:33:22.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.480 --> 03:33:30.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we now have the complete internet takeover plan.
[03:33:30.480 --> 03:33:32.480]  Blueprints.
[03:33:32.480 --> 03:33:41.480]  Within three months, every computer device in the country already has the back doors built into it with devices made five, six years ago,
[03:33:41.480 --> 03:33:45.480]  will be broken into via your terms of service.
[03:33:45.480 --> 03:33:47.480]  You won't be allowed to not have it on there.
[03:33:47.480 --> 03:33:54.480]  By the Southern Parvy Law Center, the ADL, the ADL used to have to break into police stations to get information.
[03:33:54.480 --> 03:34:05.480]  And they got convicted of that and got sued over it by media matters towards Soros and by the main neocon think tanks
[03:34:05.480 --> 03:34:16.480]  with Defense Department yearly funding that Obama put in place with oversight by special officers set up by Obama and Hillary at the CIA.
[03:34:16.480 --> 03:34:23.480]  And just as you've seen in China where you can't send on phones emojis of the Taiwanese flag,
[03:34:23.480 --> 03:34:29.480]  and that went worldwide for a while, or you can't send images of Wendy the Pooh because the dictator doesn't like it.
[03:34:29.480 --> 03:34:33.480]  Because people make fun of him in China, so Wendy the Pooh is banned.
[03:34:33.480 --> 03:34:39.480]  And they've got a firewall and systems that detect that and you can't send that over platforms.
[03:34:39.480 --> 03:34:47.480]  The EU just signed a law banning memes by law. You must pre-approved them and scan them through a government system before you put a meme out.
[03:34:47.480 --> 03:34:53.480]  That's prior restraint on speech. This is way beyond 1984.
[03:34:53.480 --> 03:35:02.480]  And so starting in three months and rolling out to the rest of the year, and we have neocons at major events admitting this.
[03:35:02.480 --> 03:35:07.480]  We have all the articles admitting it. They're just bragging. They say, you think Alex Jones was a big deal.
[03:35:07.480 --> 03:35:13.480]  You think us banning thousands of conservatives was a big deal. We only did that to get the left wing on board.
[03:35:13.480 --> 03:35:21.480]  The Democrats are so sick and tired of their own constituents being anti-war and everything, we're going to ban all of them.
[03:35:21.480 --> 03:35:26.480]  And then the conservatives who feel like they've been wronged are going to take the bait.
[03:35:26.480 --> 03:35:32.480]  And once that's done, we're going to set the precedent to ban everybody.
[03:35:32.480 --> 03:35:40.480]  It doesn't matter if you've got a show about gardening on YouTube. If it's popular and you've got 100,000 subscribers,
[03:35:40.480 --> 03:35:46.480]  and you've got a great arborist business that sits plants around the country, there's a bunch of those.
[03:35:46.480 --> 03:35:50.480]  I've ordered plants off some of those. I've even talked to them on the phone. I'm like, wow, how's your business doing?
[03:35:50.480 --> 03:35:54.480]  How much money are you guys making? I'm like, wow, you know, in the future, they're going to...
[03:35:54.480 --> 03:35:59.480]  I was ordering some trumpet vans just six months ago and I brought it up to them.
[03:35:59.480 --> 03:36:03.480]  You know they're coming for you next and they're not going to let you operate.
[03:36:03.480 --> 03:36:06.480]  Funny things, I got an email from the guy. He said, how did you know that?
[03:36:06.480 --> 03:36:09.480]  I just started getting contacted by YouTube and they said things are about to change.
[03:36:09.480 --> 03:36:16.480]  I'm going to have to pay them to even be on YouTube, but they're going to have a conference and I should fly there.
[03:36:16.480 --> 03:36:25.480]  And I said, I know, brother. And see, we're being hit by such a criminal takeover, such a mafia takeover
[03:36:25.480 --> 03:36:32.480]  that just to have any type of online store, to sell beady babies online, to sell roses online,
[03:36:32.480 --> 03:36:38.480]  to just be involved in commerce period, you're going to have to pay the piper to the big tech giants.
[03:36:38.480 --> 03:36:45.480]  And by the time they do that, everyone else is going to be shut off.
[03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:52.480]  By the time they get around to all the little merchants and all the regular people, it'll be too late.
[03:36:52.480 --> 03:36:56.480]  But here's the mega scandal. Here's the takeaway.
[03:36:56.480 --> 03:37:01.480]  Hiding in plain view, the head of Google, the head of Facebook, the head of Twitter, the head of all these groups,
[03:37:01.480 --> 03:37:07.480]  they go to Congress and they say, we've never censored anybody. We've never manipulated search results.
[03:37:07.480 --> 03:37:14.480]  We've never been paid to promote a search result. That's the whole model.
[03:37:14.480 --> 03:37:22.480]  It's like saying that the American flag doesn't have red on it. But you know it's got red on it.
[03:37:22.480 --> 03:37:28.480]  Mega lies. You know why they're so confident to lie?
[03:37:28.480 --> 03:37:37.480]  Because they've got a perfect storm where six and a half, seven months ago, right before I got banned,
[03:37:37.480 --> 03:37:47.480]  the Wall Street Journal put out a huge article that I'll show you here in a moment saying,
[03:37:47.480 --> 03:37:53.480]  we're going to take over the whole Internet and end it being free and you're not just going to pay to play.
[03:37:53.480 --> 03:37:56.480]  We're not going to let anybody on it but select companies.
[03:37:56.480 --> 03:38:00.480]  And then of course they're all going to start fighting with each other too over how many can be there.
[03:38:00.480 --> 03:38:05.480]  It's a total takeover because the Internet was going to decentralize things.
[03:38:05.480 --> 03:38:10.480]  It was going to end all these monopolies and it was starting to do it.
[03:38:10.480 --> 03:38:13.480]  And the globalists are like, no, this is supposed to bring in total control.
[03:38:13.480 --> 03:38:18.480]  And so they're doing it.
[03:38:18.480 --> 03:38:21.480]  It's all over the German news now that they're going to train stations.
[03:38:21.480 --> 03:38:23.480]  First I saw it two days ago in one sitting. Now it's all over.
[03:38:23.480 --> 03:38:29.480]  And they're going to attractive women who have blonde hair and saying, are you a racist?
[03:38:29.480 --> 03:38:32.480]  Are you a nationalist? And the women say, no, no, no, I'm not.
[03:38:32.480 --> 03:38:36.480]  I believe they're going to be arrested. And the police say, good, because you'll be arrested if you are.
[03:38:36.480 --> 03:38:43.480]  So now they're even saying, we'll take you away because you're white.
[03:38:43.480 --> 03:38:48.480]  And one woman said, but you're blonde haired.
[03:38:48.480 --> 03:38:52.480]  And the cop pulled out a breathalyzer and shoved it in her mouth trying to take her to jail for talking back.
[03:38:52.480 --> 03:38:55.480]  And then the Germans went, oh, don't worry. It's a social experiment.
[03:38:55.480 --> 03:38:59.480]  Of course it is. They go, we're not really going to arrest you for blonde hair.
[03:38:59.480 --> 03:39:04.480]  It's a social experiment. I called Watson that morning for anybody else who picked it up.
[03:39:04.480 --> 03:39:11.480]  And he says, it's crazy. And I said, no, Paul, it's meant to make them insecure and scared and spread the word.
[03:39:11.480 --> 03:39:18.480]  So when they really start arresting people for what color they are, people won't say, oh, I care about that because they've already heard about it.
[03:39:18.480 --> 03:39:21.480]  And they go, oh, that's just an experiment. See, they're testing you.
[03:39:21.480 --> 03:39:25.480]  It's a study show and they show you a bunch of murders on TV.
[03:39:25.480 --> 03:39:31.480]  You become desensitized to the real thing. That's why they show soldiers simulated shooting.
[03:39:31.480 --> 03:39:40.480]  The first video games were killing people up close who weren't real so that when you kill the real people, you don't care.
[03:39:40.480 --> 03:39:44.480]  It's a desensitization. And look, I know you know all this, folks. Let me tell you.
[03:39:44.480 --> 03:39:53.480]  Only being aware of this will defeat it. You can't look at the news, Fox News, CNN, any of these things
[03:39:53.480 --> 03:39:56.480]  and think you're getting what the story is.
[03:39:56.480 --> 03:40:01.480]  Even if they're reporting on the basic facts, it's all about distracting you from what's really going on.
[03:40:01.480 --> 03:40:05.480]  Like Trump doesn't need an emergency to build the wall.
[03:40:05.480 --> 03:40:10.480]  He could do it with existing military funds with a selective emergency by declaring it an emergency.
[03:40:10.480 --> 03:40:19.480]  He needs it to circumvent and remove these networks Obama put in under an emergency.
[03:40:19.480 --> 03:40:23.480]  And of course, we're next year's news today. I've been telling you this since Trump got in.
[03:40:23.480 --> 03:40:27.480]  He's got to declare the emergency to override the previous emergency.
[03:40:27.480 --> 03:40:33.480]  And I'm telling you now, in fact, here's the takeaway that up front, I want everyone to know,
[03:40:33.480 --> 03:40:38.480]  Obama and the neocons know there's a populist uprising worldwide.
[03:40:38.480 --> 03:40:40.480]  They thought Hillary was going to win.
[03:40:40.480 --> 03:40:56.480]  But even if she did win or didn't win, they were going to incrementally in the Internet as we know it.
[03:40:56.480 --> 03:41:05.480]  And it's here. And it's the old saying of first they came for this group and they came for that group.
[03:41:05.480 --> 03:41:07.480]  And when they came for me, there was nobody left to stand up for me.
[03:41:07.480 --> 03:41:12.480]  This is an exact plan where you pick off one person and then another and then another and then a whole group
[03:41:12.480 --> 03:41:16.480]  and then thousands in a day and thousands the next day and thousands the next day.
[03:41:16.480 --> 03:41:18.480]  And then you, then you, oh, people are getting upset. Let's cycle back.
[03:41:18.480 --> 03:41:24.480]  Okay, we're going to quit. We apologize for Franklin Graham.
[03:41:24.480 --> 03:41:27.480]  Oh, we apologize for Gavin McGinnis on YouTube.
[03:41:27.480 --> 03:41:31.480]  And then they take him down later.
[03:41:31.480 --> 03:41:38.480]  And so it's, it's all a psychological plan and only by being aware of it, only by being conscious of it,
[03:41:38.480 --> 03:41:43.480]  only by understanding it, do we have any chance to beat it?
[03:41:43.480 --> 03:41:47.480]  So again, normally I get up here and I talk about one of these issues and all I do is you start showing you
[03:41:47.480 --> 03:41:50.480]  article after article showing different pieces, how they're spinning, how they're lying,
[03:41:50.480 --> 03:41:52.480]  how they're admitting, how it all goes together.
[03:41:52.480 --> 03:41:54.480]  And then I never actually get to the big picture.
[03:41:54.480 --> 03:41:57.480]  I just got to the big picture, told you exactly what's going on.
[03:41:57.480 --> 03:42:02.480]  Now when we come back, I'll go over all the articles and the proof and the legislation and the video clips
[03:42:02.480 --> 03:42:04.480]  of senators admitting it.
[03:42:04.480 --> 03:42:09.480]  And then we got a bunch of big guests coming up today.
[03:42:09.480 --> 03:42:13.480]  But this is it. And I want to explain it.
[03:42:13.480 --> 03:42:18.480]  It's not just that they're going to put over what you're doing on your phone or your computer
[03:42:18.480 --> 03:42:23.480]  or your Alexa or your other home quote device that's spying on you.
[03:42:23.480 --> 03:42:28.480]  There's a good little minder. It's that when you go to Alexa and say,
[03:42:28.480 --> 03:42:31.480]  Alexa, pull up Alex Jones in FullWars.com.
[03:42:31.480 --> 03:42:35.480]  At first it's going to say that's fake news and a bad person.
[03:42:35.480 --> 03:42:39.480]  But okay, later it's going to say I'm reporting you for doing that.
[03:42:39.480 --> 03:42:41.480]  And by the way, I've been listening to you.
[03:42:41.480 --> 03:42:46.480]  And later it's not going to even let you know it's just not going to let you go there and not respond.
[03:42:46.480 --> 03:42:48.480]  They actually admit that in the documents too.
[03:42:48.480 --> 03:42:52.480]  A robot in your house controlling what you listen to.
[03:42:52.480 --> 03:42:55.480]  Fueling your body is hard work.
[03:42:55.480 --> 03:43:01.480]  That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel it right.

[03:45:18.480 --> 03:45:20.480]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:45:20.480 --> 03:45:24.480]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[03:45:24.480 --> 03:45:30.480]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[03:45:35.480 --> 03:45:41.480]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you,
[03:45:41.480 --> 03:45:46.480]  the people of America to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:45:46.480 --> 03:45:49.480]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[03:45:49.480 --> 03:45:53.480]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:45:53.480 --> 03:46:00.480]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[03:46:00.480 --> 03:46:04.480]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[03:46:04.480 --> 03:46:06.480]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[03:46:06.480 --> 03:46:11.480]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[03:46:11.480 --> 03:46:18.480]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[03:46:18.480 --> 03:46:24.480]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[03:46:24.480 --> 03:46:26.480]  We have seen what they want to do.
[03:46:26.480 --> 03:46:28.480]  They called it UN Agenda 21.
[03:46:28.480 --> 03:46:30.480]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[03:46:30.480 --> 03:46:33.480]  They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[03:46:33.480 --> 03:46:35.480]  They want people out of the suburbs.
[03:46:35.480 --> 03:46:41.480]  They want to attract everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[03:46:41.480 --> 03:46:43.480]  It's The David Knight Show.
[03:46:43.480 --> 03:46:45.480]  I've never missed your show.
[03:46:45.480 --> 03:46:46.480]  Any day.
[03:46:46.480 --> 03:46:49.480]  At InfoWars.com, I mean never.
[03:46:49.480 --> 03:47:17.480]  At InfoWars.com, Ford Slash Show.
[03:47:17.480 --> 03:47:30.480]  From Azeris, they came with a ragtag band to bring a revolution.
[03:47:30.480 --> 03:47:33.480]  Some would make them change.
[03:47:33.480 --> 03:47:36.480]  Others couldn't stand for that.
[03:47:36.480 --> 03:47:41.480]  The cross was a solution.
[03:47:41.480 --> 03:47:44.480]  But it rose again.
[03:47:44.480 --> 03:47:47.480]  Wise men follow you.
[03:47:47.480 --> 03:47:50.480]  It rose again.
[03:47:50.480 --> 03:47:53.480]  Wise men follow you.
[03:47:53.480 --> 03:47:55.480]  Thank God for the revolution.
[03:47:55.480 --> 03:47:58.480]  Alice Jones here, back live.
[03:47:58.480 --> 03:48:09.480]  The inventor of the Internet, who's not Al Gore, he's a British scientist who's credited with the final pieces of it for contributing the most,
[03:48:09.480 --> 03:48:18.480]  has said last year and this year that a global authoritarianism is taking the web over a technocracy that the big tech companies have totally sold out to evil
[03:48:18.480 --> 03:48:25.480]  and that he has been feverishly working with other top scientists to try to combat them.
[03:48:25.480 --> 03:48:28.480]  And in the past, when those fellows talk, they'd be all over wired.
[03:48:28.480 --> 03:48:33.480]  They'd be all over the Wall Street Journal when these inventors of the web talk now about authoritarianism.
[03:48:33.480 --> 03:48:35.480]  You have to read it in local newspapers.
[03:48:35.480 --> 03:48:40.480]  Father, a worldwide web launches a platform which aims to radically decentralize the net.
[03:48:40.480 --> 03:48:49.480]  Intensity in the dominance of Facebook, Google, Amazon, all the process of letting individuals take back control of their data.
[03:48:49.480 --> 03:48:55.480]  That's Tim Barron's.
[03:48:55.480 --> 03:48:57.480]  Tim Barron's Lee.
[03:48:57.480 --> 03:49:03.480]  Now, here's the problem with this.
[03:49:03.480 --> 03:49:10.480]  You get hit with an authoritarianism this big and people don't know what they're facing.
[03:49:10.480 --> 03:49:22.480]  And you have almost like 21st century technology finding a time machine and going back and fighting primitive tribes or something.
[03:49:22.480 --> 03:49:26.480]  The primitive tribes have no chance.
[03:49:26.480 --> 03:49:36.480]  And because the old governing political class who are 65, 70, 80 years old are playing golf all day and barely know how the internet works,
[03:49:36.480 --> 03:49:44.480]  they're allowing the technocracy and these tech heads and traders inside U.S. intelligence and multinationals and the chai comms
[03:49:44.480 --> 03:49:52.480]  to literally set up the end of civilization as we know it when it comes to basic freedom.
[03:49:52.480 --> 03:49:57.480]  Julian Assange's last video interview before blackout.
[03:49:57.480 --> 03:50:05.480]  He said this generation being born right now is the last to have any freedom ever.
[03:50:05.480 --> 03:50:15.480]  And that's really the sad thing here is that the inventors of the internet and top journalists all say exactly what I say because it's what's happening.
[03:50:15.480 --> 03:50:19.480]  And it's very, very sad.
[03:50:19.480 --> 03:50:28.480]  And then I knew that the next level was going to be device control because we've seen Apple do all sorts of things,
[03:50:28.480 --> 03:50:40.480]  not letting people even not just access iTunes, but not even use the RSS reader on iPhones to get to our RSS feed.
[03:50:40.480 --> 03:50:42.480]  And I didn't believe it when listeners found it.
[03:50:42.480 --> 03:50:51.480]  I told the tech guys, we got an outside big company, they said, yeah, we've never seen this before, but we believe this is the next level of control.
[03:50:51.480 --> 03:51:04.480]  URLs blocked the device level and then boom, Microsoft and all the rest of them are announcing in corporate papers that, oh, we put the function in years ago,
[03:51:04.480 --> 03:51:15.480]  but we're going to go live with it at schools, universities, military bases and on people's devices without opting in.
[03:51:15.480 --> 03:51:23.480]  Where you try to go to infowars.com and it pops up snopes in the Southern Primary Law Center and all these other criminal groups, in my view,
[03:51:23.480 --> 03:51:28.480]  and says, hey, this is a fake guy that's a Nazi or, you know, he says the moon landings didn't happen.
[03:51:28.480 --> 03:51:31.480]  We're fact checkers, we're God.
[03:51:31.480 --> 03:51:35.480]  We're Jim Acosta, and we say you don't want to go there.
[03:51:35.480 --> 03:51:37.480]  And then you know what the next step is.
[03:51:37.480 --> 03:51:40.480]  Obviously, you're put in a database, which they've already been doing.
[03:51:40.480 --> 03:51:41.480]  Oh, that you're a bad person.
[03:51:41.480 --> 03:51:44.480]  So what they're doing is getting you used to a minder.
[03:51:44.480 --> 03:51:52.480]  Now, one of the crew in there, Matt is a smart guy, he goes, man, it's almost like this is the Chinese social score is already here.
[03:51:52.480 --> 03:51:54.480]  And I said, yeah, Matt, that's next segment.
[03:51:54.480 --> 03:51:57.480]  That's what I was going to end with on this before we shift gears and the other issues.
[03:51:57.480 --> 03:52:07.480]  This is worth 100 hours, not just one hour. Let's talk about the entire Chinese global social score system didn't start there.
[03:52:07.480 --> 03:52:09.480]  It started here.
[03:52:09.480 --> 03:52:11.480]  But yes, it's being adopted in Latin America.
[03:52:11.480 --> 03:52:13.480]  It's being adopted in Africa.
[03:52:13.480 --> 03:52:24.480]  So the Chinese come in, they say, we're going to build roads and railroads and all this, but you have to adopt your government does our computers that spy on you and run everything you do.
[03:52:24.480 --> 03:52:27.480]  And you've got to sign over your reports and everything to us.
[03:52:27.480 --> 03:52:30.480]  And we're going to watch everything your citizens do.
[03:52:30.480 --> 03:52:37.480]  So starting next year, they've already done it as a pilot project with all the party members.
[03:52:37.480 --> 03:52:42.480]  Just this is just the Google project dragonfly that they say we've never heard of just doesn't exist.
[03:52:42.480 --> 03:52:45.480]  First a few months ago, it didn't exist.
[03:52:45.480 --> 03:52:48.480]  And then Sundar goes, oh, I don't really pay attention to it.
[03:52:48.480 --> 03:52:50.480]  We don't even know we're going to do it.
[03:52:50.480 --> 03:52:56.480]  Dragonfly is the global model and we already have it.
[03:52:56.480 --> 03:53:08.480]  Dragonfly watches what you do on your phone and puts it into a scoring system and has government minders watching where you go in live time and even messaging you when you're doing things they don't like.
[03:53:08.480 --> 03:53:12.480]  And it's the by law starting next year in China.
[03:53:12.480 --> 03:53:21.480]  Everyone will be given a phone that listens to you that watches you as your minder.
[03:53:21.480 --> 03:53:25.480]  And then if you don't play ball, you can't move one inch.
[03:53:25.480 --> 03:53:27.480]  That's the government quote.
[03:53:27.480 --> 03:53:29.480]  So that's what they're doing here.
[03:53:29.480 --> 03:53:30.480]  That's what they're doing there.
[03:53:30.480 --> 03:53:41.480]  And so all of us are going to be prisoners and literally George Soros funded groups are already banning Franklin Graham and will ban everybody and are already live time in your phone.
[03:53:41.480 --> 03:53:46.480]  Not just a computer program that puts feeds up on your phone, not the website you go to.
[03:53:46.480 --> 03:53:49.480]  They're just getting you used to that like, oh, I went to a website.
[03:53:49.480 --> 03:53:55.480]  You know, I went to Google or I went to YouTube or I went to Twitter or I went to Facebook and I went to my local church.
[03:53:55.480 --> 03:53:59.480]  And you know, somebody didn't like the fact that they gave up your anti abortion speech.
[03:53:59.480 --> 03:54:00.480]  So it says something about your church.
[03:54:00.480 --> 03:54:02.480]  You're like, well, that's weird.
[03:54:02.480 --> 03:54:03.480]  It won't be on the website.
[03:54:03.480 --> 03:54:04.480]  They're doing it.
[03:54:04.480 --> 03:54:06.480]  It's going to be on your phone.
[03:54:06.480 --> 03:54:16.480]  And you know what that means, they admit literal university control freaks, antifa, scum of the earth, all of them are who they're hiring,
[03:54:16.480 --> 03:54:21.480]  top security clearances to reality winner who joined ISIS and said, all whites should die.
[03:54:21.480 --> 03:54:22.480]  And she was white.
[03:54:22.480 --> 03:54:27.480]  These are the people that are going to be live time in your phone.
[03:54:27.480 --> 03:54:31.480]  It's not just going to be Twitter where they read your private messages and share them.
[03:54:31.480 --> 03:54:34.480]  And we have all the veritas videos laughing about it or all of this.
[03:54:34.480 --> 03:54:36.480]  It's, it's, it's sick.
[03:54:36.480 --> 03:54:39.480]  And guess who they are now hiring demand the whole thing.
[03:54:39.480 --> 03:54:46.480]  University professors, antifa, leftist, but all the out of work or would be out of work.
[03:54:46.480 --> 03:54:51.480]  Major newspapers, New York Times, Washington Post, all of them are now like little intelligence agencies.
[03:54:51.480 --> 03:54:53.480]  That's what's running all this.
[03:54:53.480 --> 03:55:01.480]  And they live time, get into your account and they look at all your sponsors on YouTube and they start contacting them.
[03:55:01.480 --> 03:55:02.480]  You never even know why you lose them.
[03:55:02.480 --> 03:55:04.480]  And they admit this.
[03:55:04.480 --> 03:55:11.480]  Criminal racketeering outside third parties in, you're about Facebook letting outside parties into your thing.
[03:55:11.480 --> 03:55:12.480]  Yeah, that's what they do.
[03:55:12.480 --> 03:55:16.480]  But the New York Times is on undercover video saying, yeah, we're in Alex Jones's private account.
[03:55:16.480 --> 03:55:20.480]  That son of a bitch used to make $5 million a year off YouTube.
[03:55:20.480 --> 03:55:22.480]  We cut it down to $500,000.
[03:55:22.480 --> 03:55:24.480]  He's almost crippled.
[03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:28.480]  Yeah, he's our number one enemy that veterans and anybody that has American flags.
[03:55:28.480 --> 03:55:29.480]  That's a quote.
[03:55:29.480 --> 03:55:30.480]  Who do you target?
[03:55:30.480 --> 03:55:32.480]  American flags.
[03:55:32.480 --> 03:55:35.480]  The New York Times like, yeah, we're in the interface.
[03:55:35.480 --> 03:55:37.480]  We can read all their private messages, everything.
[03:55:37.480 --> 03:55:43.480]  Yeah.
[03:55:43.480 --> 03:55:50.480]  And now it's everybody and taught neo-consid Defense Department think tanks on stages in Germany.
[03:55:50.480 --> 03:55:54.480]  Three months ago said, you think the censorship's good now.
[03:55:54.480 --> 03:55:59.480]  We're banning everybody by the end of next year.
[03:55:59.480 --> 03:56:00.480]  And we're going to have one.
[03:56:00.480 --> 03:56:02.480]  And guess who controls it?
[03:56:02.480 --> 03:56:04.480]  Neocon Bushites.
[03:56:04.480 --> 03:56:07.480]  And it's all right here in these articles on enforce.com.
[03:56:07.480 --> 03:56:17.480]  And they're bragging up there at defense meetings about how the enemies, the people and how they're going to shut everybody off and take your bank accounts.
[03:56:17.480 --> 03:56:24.480]  And they laugh about you being homeless.
[03:56:24.480 --> 03:56:31.480]  And the Nazis put Jews in the ghettos.
[03:56:31.480 --> 03:56:35.480]  And we've got all these clips of congressmen I haven't gotten to yet saying ban me.
[03:56:35.480 --> 03:56:36.480]  We'll play those next segment.
[03:56:36.480 --> 03:56:41.480]  But here it was back in February of 2018.
[03:56:41.480 --> 03:56:44.480]  So I was saying six, seven months ago, I guess that's really 10 months ago.
[03:56:44.480 --> 03:56:45.480]  God time flies.
[03:56:45.480 --> 03:56:46.480]  So I was wrong.
[03:56:46.480 --> 03:56:47.480]  I said six, seven months.
[03:56:47.480 --> 03:56:48.480]  It was 10 months ago.
[03:56:48.480 --> 03:56:50.480]  Hold on to your tinfoil hat, Alex Jones.
[03:56:50.480 --> 03:56:51.480]  Your YouTube's coming for you.
[03:56:51.480 --> 03:56:55.480]  This is an article about the Wall Street Journal article that's behind the paywall, but you can still go find it.
[03:56:55.480 --> 03:56:57.480]  And it just says, we're taking the web over.
[03:56:57.480 --> 03:56:58.480]  We're ending the internet.
[03:56:58.480 --> 03:57:03.480]  And Google engineers quit and said, you're breaking the internet.
[03:57:03.480 --> 03:57:05.480]  They said that.
[03:57:05.480 --> 03:57:08.480]  Google Soros funds Facebook new fact checkers.
[03:57:08.480 --> 03:57:10.480]  That's a newsbusters article.
[03:57:10.480 --> 03:57:15.480]  How a Neocon back fact checker plans to wage war independent news.
[03:57:15.480 --> 03:57:22.480]  And that press is the best article.
[03:57:22.480 --> 03:57:27.480]  And it goes through all of how they're going to do it and how they're going to ban liberals, conservatives, everybody.
[03:57:27.480 --> 03:57:28.480]  It's all over.
[03:57:28.480 --> 03:57:30.480]  They're ending the internet.
[03:57:30.480 --> 03:57:35.480]  Except it's a psychology experiment, a giant reeducation camp where it's 100,000 now.
[03:57:35.480 --> 03:57:42.480]  They plan to leverage it up to about 10 million people whose jobs will be watching everything you do and telling you what to do over the smartphone.
[03:57:42.480 --> 03:57:44.480]  Defeat the globalist.
