[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:42.000]  Thank you so much for joining us. It is Tuesday, October 4th, 2022. I am here in the hills of Connecticut, outside
[00:42.000 --> 00:49.000]  Waterbury with constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes. Owen Schreuer is going to be hosting most of broadcast today.
[00:49.000 --> 00:57.000]  I may be back tomorrow for the show. I may not even testify here because he's not allowing me to even basically speak.
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  It's a total show trial. So our part of the trial now starts as he's not allowing any defense.
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  This is unprecedented in U.S. history, but it's actually happening.
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  So we'll be talking some about that coming up and just how this fits in to the whole backdrop.
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  But the globalist blowing up pipelines, dissolving the border, shipping in drugs, devaluing the currency,
[01:20.000 --> 01:30.000]  drag queen pedophile time, forced injections, they are making their moves on every level. Robert Barnes will be talking about that here in just a moment.
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.000]  And again, Rob, there was some documents that were in my book. I don't see them now.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  I know this is this is the other book. There's another book that I think I left in the kitchen that has my notes.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  I wanted to go over for people. I forgot to get it. That's my fault. But Robert Barnes is here.
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  I love a lot to cover. Oh, and Troyer, tell folks what you've got coming up.
[01:51.000 --> 01:58.000]  Well, I'm still sitting here just trying to parse through all the news, Alex. There's so many.
[01:58.000 --> 02:05.000]  It's like you can take one stack of the news and try to break it down. And if people could just understand that, like, like, here's an example.
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  This is from Yahoo News today.
[02:08.000 --> 02:16.000]  The FDA misled the public about ivermectin and should be held accountable and court argues the association of American physicians and surgeons.
[02:16.000 --> 02:24.000]  And so, obviously, we were talking about ivermectin. Others were talking about ivermectin. Republican leaders were trying to get people ivermectin.
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  Democrats were banning it. Biden was banning it. The media was saying it bad.
[02:28.000 --> 02:36.000]  But see, it's not just the FDA. There's this entire consortium, Alex, that you've been talking about for decades.
[02:36.000 --> 02:45.000]  It's an entire power structure. The FDA is just one, like, a fingertip of it. It's the media. It's Fauci. It's the NIH. It's all of them combined.
[02:45.000 --> 02:55.000]  It's not just the FDA that should be held accountable. Every single bastard that made sure Americans couldn't get ivermectin, couldn't get hydroxychloroquine, and couldn't get cures for COVID,
[02:55.000 --> 03:02.000]  every single one of those creeps should be held accountable, not just the ones in governments, legally and lawfully,
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.000]  but also the ones in the media should be held to extreme scrutiny for what they did to this country and what they did to people,
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.000]  causing the inflation of the deaths because of COVID, because they didn't want people to know that there was a cure.
[03:14.000 --> 03:24.000]  So, this is like, oh, okay, like, I've got an ingrown fingernail that I need to chop off, but my arm is, like, completely broken,
[03:24.000 --> 03:32.000]  you know, hanging in like a limb like this, my shoulder is separated, and it says, oh, I'm just going to take care of this little ingrown fingernail I have here, Alex,
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  and that'll take care of it. No. The entire government and media lied about ivermectin and COVID.
[03:38.000 --> 03:45.000]  Oh, and we didn't talk before the show today, but that's exactly what I was going to raise before we talked about the show trial with Robert Martin,
[03:45.000 --> 03:54.000]  because he's involved with Robert Kennedy and some of the main lawsuits, bringing this out with whistleblowers and more, is that this is war,
[03:54.000 --> 04:01.000]  and they know what they're doing, and they even knew, in their own battle plans and war games, Spars 2025, 2028, that indeed this would all come out.
[04:01.000 --> 04:12.000]  Just last week, another major study out of, this one was out of Oxford, confirmed that they suppressed hydroxychloroquine,
[04:12.000 --> 04:20.000]  and that basically have taken early, almost 100% effectiveness, just what the great doctors, Zelenko, and others said.
[04:20.000 --> 04:29.000]  So this is mass murder with big tech and Google working together with the UN to suppress information.
[04:29.000 --> 04:38.000]  In fact, we played that clip Sunday, we played it Monday, I sent the crew a Paul Watson clip where he talks about the head of the UN at operations.
[04:38.000 --> 04:49.000]  The doctors came out and admitted that they knowingly suppressed all this, so these are murdering criminals.
[04:49.000 --> 05:12.000]  We'll get Robert Barnes, take on that when we come back.
[05:20.000 --> 05:31.000]  Paul Sonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[05:31.000 --> 05:41.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[05:41.000 --> 05:49.000]  I don't take the credit, I give you the credit, and now Info Wars is facing its darkest hours, it isn't going to give up.
[05:49.000 --> 06:14.000]  Without your support, we can be shut down. Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our Legal Defense Fund.
[06:14.000 --> 06:20.000]  I know Troyer here live in the Info Wars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[06:20.000 --> 06:30.000]  Of course, in court this week, he's about to give you an update as far as the status of his testimony and what else is going to follow.
[06:30.000 --> 06:45.000]  But you know, Alex, it's almost a distraction. We're in a rock and a hard place. It's a catch-22 where we have to go on defense of Alex Jones, not just for Info Wars, but just for the truth and for free speech and for media.
[06:45.000 --> 07:01.000]  But then also as a company that wants to exist and has 100 employees that you've built up over multiple decades. But then again, we realize the biggest challenge that we face every day is nobody tells the truth like Info Wars.
[07:01.000 --> 07:12.000]  So we have stacks of these news that are going to be so important to cover today that it's like we have to have a sword in one hand and we have to strike with maximum efficiency while we have a shield in the other hand
[07:12.000 --> 07:18.000]  and we have to be totally defensive with efficiency. And if it wasn't for this audience and it wasn't for God, we wouldn't be here.
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.000]  But Alex Jones is live with us right now in Connecticut. He's going to be hosting as long as he can before he's due back in the courtroom.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  Bob Barnes with him as well. Honored to be joined by you two today.
[07:28.000 --> 07:35.000]  Absolutely. Robert Barnes has some major breaking news on multiple fronts, but I want to be completely clear with viewers and listeners.
[07:35.000 --> 07:42.000]  This is the main new world order assault. This is the big global attack. They are no longer in beta. They are in operational phase.
[07:42.000 --> 07:49.000]  Now, what Owen raised in the first segment, some stations don't carry it. I'm going to reemphasize and then get Robert Barnes who's in the right in the middle of this.
[07:49.000 --> 07:57.000]  When it comes to the battle with Big Pharma, his analysis on it solicited me very carefully. I know you know this, but I need to know this too.
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  We need to have this really sink into our psyche.
[08:00.000 --> 08:08.000]  They know human nature and I've had meetings off record with top globes trying to hire me.
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.000]  People say, why don't you expose them? Well, that's an off record meeting, but I will tell you the things they've said, the things they've done.
[08:13.000 --> 08:23.000]  And so that stuff has come out over the years. But what they all tell me, including one meeting that was on a first class flight to be on the view,
[08:23.000 --> 08:31.000]  now hard to believe 15 years ago, with the CEO of a major big three bank at the time, he's retired now.
[08:31.000 --> 08:37.000]  And he told me, he said, this is an off record discussion, Alex. And I said, yes, he said, you can talk about it, but don't say my name.
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  And you know, those guys know though, the currency I've got is it was an off record meeting. It's an off record meeting.
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  He said to me, you think people will adapt like the Marines to overcome.
[08:47.000 --> 08:53.000]  And he'd just been visiting his dad that was a retired general in San Antonio, but he was flying back from Austin.
[08:53.000 --> 09:02.000]  And he said to New York, he said, he said, you think they're going to adapt and overcome? He goes, no.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  The way we do things incrementally is people will adapt to us taking full control.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  And we're going to have a corporate world government because we know how to run things best.
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  And those little people you're trying to save don't want you to save them.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  They're trying to empower them. They would tear you apart. Now, that's the standard elitist line. Hey, you should be with us.
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.000]  The fact that you understand that means you're one of us. You really should join us.
[09:24.000 --> 09:32.000]  That's how real this is. Again, the only story I can tell is because the head of the Kissinger group in front of John Harmon, our oldest employee, 18 years.
[09:32.000 --> 09:39.000]  John Harmon backed in screen calls and literally screen, you know, wind up phone calls still does that sometimes.
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.000]  It's such a good job and we get guests on him, but he would book guests. So he heard the conversation with me and Rothkoff.
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.000]  Have the Kissinger group. When he said, look, you're one of us. You're part of the superclass.
[09:50.000 --> 09:57.000]  You're in a book called superclass. A thousand people around the world. He goes, you could be the leader of the Liberty Movement, but loyal opposition and we'll work with you.
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  You'll have a seat at the table. A lot of your ideas will actually get heard and implemented.
[10:01.000 --> 10:07.000]  But if you don't join us, you'll be destroyed. So stop this crusade you're on and be a star.
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  Now, I was given the same speech in a 50 story building in Los Angeles by the head of a major.
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  You know, at the time, you have a major operation. I'll leave it at that. Very well known name.
[10:16.000 --> 10:25.000]  And I had several other meetings. Okay, I had meetings with representatives that very famous lawyer, the most famous in basically modern history.
[10:25.000 --> 10:33.000]  And I'm not going to say the name, but this wasn't even off record meeting, but I just didn't want to say the name because, well, and he was the representing Sumner Redstone to meet with me.
[10:33.000 --> 10:40.000]  And he got on the phone with Sumner Redstone. We had a conversation. Okay, and I'm going to leave it at that. That was 16 years ago.
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.000]  So they spot the talent and they know who can resist them and they try to go buy them and get them.
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  So when I tell you, I know about the New World Order, folks, I know about the New World Order.
[10:49.000 --> 11:01.000]  Now, the reason I prefaced that before we go to Robert Barnes, probably this big breaking news on two fronts, is that globalist, the head of the third largest bank in the world,
[11:01.000 --> 11:10.000]  told me, he said, Alex, they will adapt to being slaves by increment, which is Stockholm Syndrome, basically.
[11:10.000 --> 11:21.000]  And that's his vision of the world. He's betting against you. I'm betting on you. I believe in you. Plus, the world they want to build so ugly and so horrible, I can't join them because I believe in God, and I don't want to join the devil.
[11:21.000 --> 11:30.000]  So when we talk about this, this is so real. So when I want to sink into your mind, very deeply here, at the deepest level is this.
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.000]  They've incrementally attacked, attacked, attacked, attacked, attacked on all these thousands of fronts.
[11:34.000 --> 11:46.000]  And now you notice it's getting more of a crescendo, shutting down farms, shutting down ranches, shutting down fertilizer, blowing up pipelines, dissolving borders, destroying currencies, flooding the culture with destruction and laziness and evil and pedophilia.
[11:46.000 --> 11:54.000]  They admit that this is a takedown of civilization. What happens is like a frog in the pot, you just incrementally heat up and you never jump out and you die.
[11:54.000 --> 12:03.000]  That's their whole game plan. But we, as this audience, and I'm an audience of the guests and callers myself, we're all viewers, we're all listeners, we're all hosts.
[12:03.000 --> 12:12.000]  This is a community operation. And this is the public comments here. And that's what they're scared of. And we're actually coming from behind, and we're getting populist elected all over the world.
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  So the globalists are striking back with all sorts of economic warfare and election fraud, but it's okay because the awakening is getting bigger and bigger.
[12:19.000 --> 12:26.000]  And the more we speak out, the more we say, no, the more trouble there is. So we adapt to being slaves instead of adapting to overcome.
[12:26.000 --> 12:36.000]  But if you're conscious, overcome the enemy and realize that and have the will and understand what you're doing, then you don't ever give up and things only get better. Resistance is victory.
[12:36.000 --> 12:46.000]  Live on your feet, don't die on your knees as a slave. It's not that you die on your feet instead of live on your knees. No, no, you end up thriving on your feet and being a slave or dying on your knees.
[12:46.000 --> 12:52.000]  So I reversed what Sopata said. I'm not saying it was wrong, but there were perspectives. So here's the key and Barnes to take it over.
[12:52.000 --> 13:03.000]  Next segment. They hit us with a virus they released. They hit us with these deadly shots that have killed millions and are wounding hundreds of thousands and causing mass heart attacks and death.
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.000]  And now they admit, yeah, we blocked hydroxychoric acid. Yeah, we blocked ivermectin even though we know it was it was a cure. Yeah, we did that.
[13:09.000 --> 13:17.000]  Yeah, in front of y'all who knows, major medical associations, because they all went along with it and now they know they were conned. They've been part of mass murder.
[13:17.000 --> 13:26.000]  And they also realize more lockdowns are coming and more forced injections. If what's left of the medical system that isn't controlled by big pharma doesn't rally and stand up and come together.
[13:26.000 --> 13:34.000]  So instead of humanity breaking under this, we're coming back stronger. They want us to forget about the lockdowns, forget about the shots for a couple of years.
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  They know the average person's memory. You want to forget about it. You want to move on, but you don't move on. You don't adapt to being a slave.
[13:40.000 --> 13:48.000]  You adapt to overcome and you take it personal and you speak out and you file lawsuits. You support those that are fighting and you never stop exposing these monsters.
[13:48.000 --> 13:56.000]  And you confront the doctors in your family that confronted you and you confront the schools and the school boards. And now we all go to the school boards and say you were trying to make us take these shots.
[13:56.000 --> 14:08.000]  You killed all these people. You're complicit. You're murderers. You're criminals to the corporate media and mass shootings. There are hundreds of studies. It's a fact that when you promote mass shootings and the shooters, it causes more mass shootings.
[14:08.000 --> 14:16.000]  So they hijacked my name, connect me to a mass shooting that I doubted, and then use that to promote mass shootings in the culture. So it's an option for crazy people to go do it.
[14:16.000 --> 14:26.000]  So in the media confronted me today at the press conference and said, oh, you're mean to the kids. I said, no, you promote mass shootings, which statistically causes more mass shootings. You kill the kids. You promote the serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[14:26.000 --> 14:40.000]  You, you promote the psychotropic drugs and so-called antidepressants that on the label says it caused mass murder and death and almost every shooter has been on them. So you're killing the kids and it's time to stop saying we're sorry.
[14:40.000 --> 14:49.000]  And it's time to not back down. And I tell myself that because the media criticizes me all the time and they say, oh, he's mean. He's this and that. I've only made a few mistakes and we've got a great record.
[14:49.000 --> 14:57.000]  And when you apologize for the few mistakes you've made, they don't care about that. They just use it to say, oh, you're a liar. You made mistakes on purpose. No, we didn't.
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.000]  Now, I apologize to my viewers for not being perfect, but you don't want to hear that. You want to see victory. You want to see action.
[15:02.000 --> 15:13.000]  So the point I've tried to get to here, ladies and gentlemen, we want to break here in just a few minutes is that now is the time to be aware of what's happening. And now is the time to supercharge.
[15:13.000 --> 15:22.000]  We'll talk about the vaccines, the poison shots, and so much more when we come back from this quick break. Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Barnes is our guest.
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  Owen Schreuer is hosting from the ATX. Please stay with us.
[15:25.000 --> 15:33.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, there you have Alex Jones live with us, Bob Barnes as well. We're about to take this break, but on the other side, more breakdown from Alex.
[15:33.000 --> 15:44.000]  And I expect to be hearing from Bob Barnes as well. And we've got a loaded news transmission today, folks here on the Alex Jones show plus carrying over into the fourth hour and the war room today.

[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:07.000 --> 20:30.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday broadcast the fourth day of October 2022.
[20:30.000 --> 20:39.000]  So we've just been hit with a long planned bio weapon to bring in UN world government, corporate fascism, ally of the communist China.
[20:39.000 --> 20:51.000]  The head of the UN Department of Information openly just bragged on international television over the weekend that the UN is in control of Google and the major search engines.
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.000]  I told you that last year two years ago that they would say in the news the UN says this is a true.
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  So you can't say vitamin D helps you.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  The UN says ivermectin is bad.
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.000]  The UN says hydroxychloroquine is bad.
[21:04.000 --> 21:10.000]  Now it's all a bit of a lot on purpose to murder people so they couldn't get therapeutics.
[21:10.000 --> 21:17.000]  And so they also couldn't do one other key thing that Robert Barnes will be laying out here for you right now.
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.000]  Then you're going to get exclusive breaking news.
[21:20.000 --> 21:23.000]  It's the biggest news in the show trials history.
[21:23.000 --> 21:29.000]  But I've just finally decided sitting here right now to do we were all in the fence about it, but I'm making the decision right now and I'll tell you that.
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  Coming up next week with Robert Barnes.
[21:31.000 --> 21:36.000]  You're at the heart of major lawsuits with Robert Kennedy Jr. and others with whistleblowers and things around the country.
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.000]  And this whole thing is falling apart now.
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.000]  They hope we just move on and forget about it, but we're not.
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  And now there's criminal investigations in the EU of Borla.
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  And now he won't testify.
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  Fauci is in a lot of trouble.
[21:49.000 --> 22:00.000]  So folks, people need to understand these are mass murderers that did this on purpose and thought that they could manage things and fool people and make them think that regular covid was killing everybody was actually the shots.
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  This is an attempted biomedical depopulation genocide confirmed.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  Let that sink in Robert Barnes.
[22:07.000 --> 22:24.000]  Yeah, good news today from del victory of high wire in terms of the informed consent action network was able to use litigation to force the FDA to turn over all of their records concerning vaccine related injuries that have been reported to the vaccine injury network.
[22:24.000 --> 22:34.000]  That means that in fact he's actually going to make it del victory is going to make it available through the informed consent action network so that anybody can search it themselves and get more additional information.
[22:34.000 --> 22:48.000]  This is critical for doctors, nurses, medical care providers on the front lines and ordinary people to see whether other people are saying that some injury they may have suffered from the vaccine might relate to somebody you know.
[22:48.000 --> 22:54.000]  So it might be a way for you to say, okay, you know what happened to my friend what happened to my family member what happened to me.
[22:54.000 --> 22:59.000]  I'm not alone and figure out whether there's certain correlation or causation present there.
[22:59.000 --> 23:10.000]  That's critical. All of this was about in terms of denying ivermectin denying hydroxychloroquine denying that any denying that vitamin C or vitamin D could possibly be good for you.
[23:10.000 --> 23:20.000]  All of that going after people selling supplements, talking about how maybe if you're healthy in this way, it will deter the effect, the most negative effects of COVID.
[23:20.000 --> 23:27.000]  Those people the United States Attorney General went after the Department of Justice went after New York State prosecutors went after.
[23:27.000 --> 23:40.000]  So what was that all about? Well under federal law, they're not allowed to do any emergency use authorization for any vaccine unless there is no alternative treatment available.
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.000]  That's why they had to push a big lie and say that none of these alternatives could possibly help.
[23:45.000 --> 23:53.000]  Things that have worked for decades, something silver that have worked for centuries that have been good for people that have net benefited their health.
[23:53.000 --> 24:00.000]  None of these things were allowed to even be communicated to people or you were actually had to face prison threat.
[24:00.000 --> 24:08.000]  And what does the Bible say? My people perish for lack of knowledge. So give us a 35,000 foot view here. How bad is it for the globalist?
[24:08.000 --> 24:18.000]  Because we can put on screen a New York TV station with the headline here. I'll pull it up and they're talking about, oh my gosh, it's terrible.
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  Almost no one is taking the shots. Here's the headline.
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.000]  While a doctor say not many people are getting the new COVID booster.
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.000]  Yes, less than 1% of what we're taking the vaccines previously are. That's a total collapse in confidence of them.
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.000]  So they went for everything, did kill a bunch of people, did name a bunch of people, generate a bunch of people's immune systems.
[24:37.000 --> 24:40.000]  But now everybody I talked to is apologizing.
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.000]  The disagree with me and said, wow, you were right about it all. How'd you know?
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.000]  Because they just can't believe that Big Pharma wants to kill you.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  Pfizer and all these companies are beyond Nazis.
[24:50.000 --> 24:57.000]  Bayer knowingly killed over 5, 6 million people, knowingly putting HIV and hepatitis in their factory product.
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.000]  They knew Vioxx was going to kill millions and they still did it, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:01.000 --> 25:07.000]  They do this on purpose. They want pure power. They want pure control. It's their religion. It's depopulation.
[25:07.000 --> 25:13.000]  It's just like a pedophile. Can't help but try to rape children. They're driven to do it. These globalists are driven to kill.
[25:13.000 --> 25:18.000]  Barnes, how would you describe the state of the total collapse of their biomedical takeover?
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.000]  Well, it's unraveling in multiple levels. So more people are finding out how unhealthy this is.
[25:22.000 --> 25:28.000]  This is showing up, as you know, to the fact that very few people who originally took it are now willing to take booster shots.
[25:28.000 --> 25:35.000]  But less than 5% of the people are willing to have their young child injected with it, despite all the massive lies of the FDA.
[25:35.000 --> 25:44.000]  Epoch Times is another headline story today about more evidence the FDA is caught lying about the safety and efficacy of this so-called vaccine.
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  Well, the FDA now admits they lie. Oh, in multiple contexts they have. And so we'll see.
[25:48.000 --> 25:56.000]  I mean, we face them in court in the Western District of Texas to stop them from continuing to lie to young children to induce them to take these dangerous shots.
[25:56.000 --> 26:05.000]  It's happening all across the world. People are discovering that Big Pharma was always untrustworthy, always unreliable, that people like Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci,
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  as Robert Kennedy showed in his book, The Really Anthony Fauci, these people are just criminals by other names.
[26:10.000 --> 26:20.000]  And let's remember that if they can get away with a massive crime and get government and corporations involved with them now through that corruption, they control that infrastructure.
[26:20.000 --> 26:28.000]  So they go commit a mass crime and get the rest of Big Pharma and the media and the hospitals and the doctors on board. That's called a corruption.
[26:28.000 --> 26:35.000]  And now they'll cover their ass and cover up that mass murder, but they'll cover up the next big mass murder. So this is all a formula of evil.
[26:35.000 --> 26:43.000]  No doubt about it. All of this, their grand plan is coming unwound because the ordinary person is waking up to it through independent means of media.
[26:43.000 --> 26:54.000]  That's the only reason, that's the reason for the lawfare against Alex Jones and Info Wars. It was built up so that this network, this program, this broadcast would not be available to ordinary everyday people all around the globe.
[26:54.000 --> 27:01.000]  So they could become self-educated and self-informed. They become politically literate, culturally literate, literate in a broader sense of the word.
[27:01.000 --> 27:11.000]  And because of you at the heart of this, the Info Wars audience, isn't about patting your back. It's real. You guys are seen as the number one enemy because you're the most focused, the most informed, the most involved and you did it.
[27:11.000 --> 27:18.000]  I'm getting chills right now. Badass! We're saving millions of people. It's worth it to be attacked to do this and we're not going to stop and I salute all of you.
[27:18.000 --> 27:27.000]  Absolutely. And it's thanks to ordinary people organizing and self-educating and sharing information in the link, keeping Info Wars alive despite the financial assault that's been waged against them.
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  The ordinary, like Paul Revere's ride, the audience of Info Wars has kept the American freedom.
[27:32.000 --> 27:39.000]  And it's all been wars at the persecution attacks. I love it. I'm glad I'm under attack because we're stopping you pedophile murderers from injecting our children with poison.
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.000]  Burn in hell, new old order. Fuck you. Fuck you, new old order. Fuck you, Bill Gates.
[27:44.000 --> 27:51.000]  It's because of ordinary people that the world continues to be in a good place and it's the only because of ordinary people that will ever stay in a good place.
[27:51.000 --> 28:04.000]  The answer to evil is always righteous people acting righteously. And as long as that takes place, the world will stay in the safe, good place for freedom and liberty that our four founders and places like right here in Connecticut help create and craft more than two centuries.
[28:04.000 --> 28:13.000]  That's right, Bob. And it's great to fight with real Americans and other people around the world like you and Rob and the whole crew because we've gone through hell, but we did it for the right reason and we've been proven right and vindicated.
[28:13.000 --> 28:20.000]  Most people who have to fight Terry never see the end of Terry in their lifetime. We're getting to see a lot of victory right now. We could push this over the top.
[28:20.000 --> 28:31.000]  Oh, absolutely. It is the biggest crack in the vaccine dam that we've seen in centuries. It's the biggest crack in Big Pharma's dam we've seen in centuries. The biggest crack in big media's dam we've seen in centuries.
[28:31.000 --> 28:41.000]  Alright, Robert Marks, stay there. Owen Schreuer is going to be taking over. We're going to host the rest of the hour. Then Owen's loaded for bear so much today and we're going to come back and play that clip.
[28:41.000 --> 28:52.000]  Just play the watch and clip where he does the analysis of the UN head of information and bragging that the UN controls American media, that the UN controls Google, that the UN is running things.
[28:52.000 --> 29:12.000]  See, we're vindicated again. World government out of the open, infowars.com. Share that link. We'll be right back.
[29:23.000 --> 29:40.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[29:40.000 --> 29:59.000]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit and now infowars is facing its darkest hours. It isn't going to give up. Without your support, we can be shut down. Please go to saveinfowars.com today. Saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.

[30:26.000 --> 30:45.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.

[30:45.000 --> 30:59.000]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening. The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[31:15.000 --> 31:26.000]  You have stepped to the plate so many times and kept info wars and free speech on the air, and I thank you. But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them, and I need your support.

[33:00.000 --> 33:21.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[33:21.000 --> 33:32.000]  I was just talking about with the UN saying that they are in control of not just Google their control of it all. And it's actually in the documents. It's on record.
[33:32.000 --> 33:40.000]  We told you four years ago that he platform me they had a NATO meeting in Germany where they said we're not just going to get Alex Jones. We're going to get everybody in the next few years.
[33:40.000 --> 33:46.000]  And they did. So that's what's so frustrating. So much of what the globalists talk about. They admit like to admit they blew the pipeline up.
[33:46.000 --> 33:55.000]  But then if you say they blew it up, they say you're crazy. That's gaslighting. So here's a clip of the head of the UN information agency bragging that they control Google.
[33:55.000 --> 34:05.000]  You know, we partnered with Google. For example, if you Google climate change, you will at the top of your search, you will get all kinds of UN resources.
[34:05.000 --> 34:16.000]  We started this partnership when we were shocked to see that when we called climate change, we were getting incredibly distorted information right at the top.
[34:16.000 --> 34:26.000]  So we're becoming much more proactive. You know, we own the science and we think that the world, you know, should know it and the platforms themselves also do.
[34:26.000 --> 34:38.000]  But again, it's a huge, huge challenge that I think all sectors of society need to be very active in.
[34:38.000 --> 34:45.000]  So the UN, the World Economic Forum, they say their number one mission is total mobilization to silence we the people.
[34:45.000 --> 34:52.000]  That's because we together are winning the war for truth. They lied about all the vaccines. They lied about COVID's origins.
[34:52.000 --> 34:59.000]  They lied and suppressed the therapies and the other systems that were out there, the therapeutics.
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  So they lied about that. They lied all about global warming and the ice caps are going to melt.
[35:04.000 --> 35:10.000]  There's going to be five foot rise in the sea levels and there is actually cooling now. It was heating up from the 60s to the 90s.
[35:10.000 --> 35:19.000]  So this is all happening. They're in deep trouble. That's why they're weaponizing the judiciary that admitted these show trial cases against yours truly are meant for everybody else.
[35:19.000 --> 35:26.000]  And finally, it's starting to get covered in the national and local press. I'm going to make a big announcement here in just a moment.
[35:26.000 --> 35:34.000]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, Robert Barnes, give us your view of this show trial. You're here seeing it for yourself.
[35:34.000 --> 35:40.000]  You watched the Texas trial. You worked on these cases. You know the truth. Give people the summation that we're going to do in the press conference today.
[35:40.000 --> 35:45.000]  I mean, what's taken place that it's been a complete show trial that is a disgrace and a travesty of American justice?
[35:45.000 --> 35:54.000]  Because what's defined as American justice is that all of us get our quote be in court. It's so commonly used that we talked about it in everyday conversation.
[35:54.000 --> 36:00.000]  And when we're in a debate or discussion with someone, even a loved one, we say, well, I haven't had a chance of my day in court yet.
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.000]  Alex Jones has been stripped and denied of that entirely, not just in Texas, but here in Connecticut.
[36:05.000 --> 36:11.000]  One of the founding states of the American Revolution has turned its back on the principles that our founders established.
[36:11.000 --> 36:17.000]  And what they've done in that process is strip him of all of his right for his First Amendment right of freedom of expression and freedom of association,
[36:17.000 --> 36:25.000]  his right to speak out in defense of the right of the Second Amendment, which was to protect people and self-defense and the defense of the country as well.
[36:25.000 --> 36:31.000]  That's why the militia clause is part of the Second Amendment. It's to not to limit the Second Amendment, but to expand it and extend it.
[36:31.000 --> 36:39.000]  It's also the Fourth Amendment right to privacy, the Fifth Amendment right to process, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, the Seventh Amendment right to trial by jury
[36:39.000 --> 36:44.000]  that goes all the way back to the Magna Carta more than eight centuries ago.
[36:44.000 --> 36:50.000]  Establish these rights, our ancestors and our forefathers, so that they would never be violated and eviscerated again.
[36:50.000 --> 36:57.000]  And then we've seen a trial that's all about a show trial. In fact, what they want now is for Alex Jones to get up and play a scripted role.
[36:57.000 --> 37:04.000]  And if he doesn't play a scripted role, if he testifies truthfully, if he testifies honestly, he goes to jail.
[37:04.000 --> 37:12.000]  This is unheard of in America. Where have you ever heard a whole trial process that's about discovering the truth, uncovering the truth,
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.000]  reporting the truth, finding out the truth, judging the truth, giving a verdict of the truth.
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.000]  The one thing that's not allowed at all in this trial is the truth. That's the one thing that they can't be allowed to speak.
[37:23.000 --> 37:28.000]  The one thing they can't be allowed to hear. The one thing the world can't be allowed to know about. Why is that?
[37:28.000 --> 37:34.000]  If their case was so strong, why are they so scared of the truth? Because their case is a fake case, reportedly about fake news.
[37:34.000 --> 37:42.000]  So when the reality is now it's the place that they're so terrified of Alex Jones, testifying truthfully, testifying honestly,
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.000]  that they are saying if he gets up there and testifies truthfully and honestly, they will put him in jail immediately.
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.000]  And by the way, when I told the press when this show trial started three weeks ago this, and in Texas they thought I was lying,
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.000]  now they're like, it is true, you're not allowed to defend yourself. There are over a dozen things the judge says you can't say,
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  on and on and on and on. So they're allowed to put on all their fake evidence to talk for weeks after weeks after weeks.
[38:04.000 --> 38:11.000]  We have no witnesses but me, because they will allow no witnesses. But she thinks they need enough of a show trial that people expect a trial.
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.000]  So they're doing that. Now there are hundreds of articles like this, where they're suddenly telling the truth and hiding it in plain view,
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  because they're mainlining this. But here's an article came out on October 3rd.
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  Alex Jones testified at Standing Hook Defamation Trial this week. Here's what to know.
[38:25.000 --> 38:33.000]  And Barnes, if you could, just read in the comment as you go, these three paragraphs, and then this last paragraph here,
[38:33.000 --> 38:38.000]  because they say he didn't give any discovery so he's defaulted, and later they go with all the discovery he gave,
[38:38.000 --> 38:46.000]  we're able to prove this, which they're not. And they have the line here, this line here, that he's prohibited from defending himself.
[38:46.000 --> 38:53.000]  Robert Barnes? Absolutely. So these are the mainstream press admitting and acknowledging what we've been talking about now for many months.
[38:53.000 --> 39:01.000]  And what it says is this week, he may be the trials last week. Why is that? Because no other witnesses allowed to present testimony on Alex Jones' behalf.
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  Testifying in his own behalf. But he's not actually allowed to testify in his own behalf.
[39:06.000 --> 39:16.000]  This is just a regular news report. Under an unusual punitive ruling against him by the presiding judge,
[39:16.000 --> 39:24.000]  Jones will be able to do little more than urge the jury to limit the tens of millions of dollars the plaintiff's lawyers are demanding,
[39:24.000 --> 39:32.000]  while at the same time opening himself to cross-examination on a range of topics that if he answers honestly, he goes to jail.
[39:32.000 --> 39:38.000]  And Barbara Bellis' default ruling sanctions Jones for failing to participate in reciprocal exchanges of information.
[39:38.000 --> 39:46.000]  However, as the last paragraph of the same article from the mainstream press details to date, using internal company communications,
[39:46.000 --> 39:56.000]  internal company records, they were able to obtain from Jones about everything, including traffic, sales, a sophisticated array of internet sites,
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.000]  all the details of all the broadcast he ever did, all the money he's ever made, all the communication he's ever had.
[40:02.000 --> 40:09.000]  They have all of it as the article confirms. And then they misrepresent the money and go, he made $61,000 last year.
[40:09.000 --> 40:17.000]  That was in 12 years. And most of it was in taxes and legal fees. So 12 years legal fees, taxes, $61 million.
[40:17.000 --> 40:24.000]  They say, look, $61 million to a jury. And then I can't respond and say it's 12 years. This is called fraud.
[40:24.000 --> 40:34.000]  Exactly. In fact, that's what the piece says. It says Jones and his company, free speech systems, have been prohibited from defending themselves under the default ruling by the country.
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  So this is, again, that's a quote.
[40:36.000 --> 40:45.000]  Exactly. They're exact quote. Jones and his company, free speech systems have been prohibited from defending themselves, prohibited from defending themselves.
[40:45.000 --> 40:55.000]  So this is a mainstream press acknowledging and admitting the complete evisceration of court constitutional rights and liberties, unlike we've ever seen in America.
[40:55.000 --> 41:03.000]  We've seen examples of this, just not in America. We've seen it in Stasi's show trial, Soviet show trial, Cuban Castro show trial.
[41:03.000 --> 41:13.000]  We've just never seen it in America before. And what the system doesn't understand is the reason why the American people have confidence in our court system is because you get your day in court.
[41:13.000 --> 41:25.000]  There is no confidence in the court's judgment on this case. And we have to increasingly ask any other case, the January 6 cases, other cases where there's other contamination of the judicial process taking place.
[41:25.000 --> 41:32.000]  There it is right there, prohibited, prohibited from putting on evidence or defending himself. That's how dumb they think you are.
[41:32.000 --> 41:38.000]  Just like they're promoting that affiliate now, ladies and gentlemen. They're just saying whatever they want, whenever they want, Barnes.
[41:38.000 --> 41:44.000]  So people ask how I'm handling this just fine. Absolutely fine, because everything they're doing is a misrepresentation.
[41:44.000 --> 41:53.000]  I don't have $2 million. And so they're going to sit there and try to get $100 million, $200 million verdict. They're never going to get it, but they want to set that precedent.
[41:53.000 --> 42:02.000]  Of course, they want to set the precedent that they can do show trials in America. They want to set the precedent that they can silence speech, weaponizing, lawfare to achieve and attain it.
[42:02.000 --> 42:10.000]  They want to set their goal. Their goal is to say, look at what we did to Alex Jones. If we did it to Alex Jones, we can do it to you. This is exactly what they did with the Big Tech Key platforming.
[42:10.000 --> 42:17.000]  They said they started with Alex Jones, promised they would never go further than Alex Jones, and then they did it to the sitting president of the United States of America.
[42:17.000 --> 42:26.000]  Imagine what they're going to do if they get away with this. If they get away with this show trial, then we can all experience the horrors of show trials to come.
[42:26.000 --> 42:34.000]  And the American justice system will be DOA. And that's the good news, though, is that the appellate courts are not as bad as this.
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.000]  And they will truly overturn the entire constitution that's happened. So that's why we got to stay on air. We got to raise funds.
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.000]  The appeals will be a fraction of what the trials cost. It will take a few years. We'll stay on air, but we've got this plan.
[42:45.000 --> 42:56.000]  We need support at SaveInfoWars.com because I got to pay 40% of the legal bills. SaveInfoWars.com to go to infoworkfor.com where S3 that's so incredible is back in stock 50% off.
[42:56.000 --> 43:19.000]  Look around you. Everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions is now happening. InfoWars credibility. My credibility has never been higher. And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air.
[43:19.000 --> 43:29.000]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together. So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[43:29.000 --> 43:40.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I've been forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself. It's unsustainable.
[43:40.000 --> 43:55.000]  So please visit SaveInfoWars.com. SaveInfoWars.com where you can make straight donations, $500, $500, whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere. I'll never give up. I'll never give in, but I could give out.

[46:11.000 --> 46:20.000]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight. And over the years, you have come to the table. You have stepped to the plate so many times and kept InfoWars and Free Speech on the air, and I thank you.
[46:20.000 --> 46:26.000]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them and I need your support.
[46:26.000 --> 46:35.000]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalist, please visit saveinfowars.com.
[46:35.000 --> 46:47.000]  And saveinfowars.com takes you to a URL that gives in go for Direct Alec Jones Legal Defense Fund. This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making, is almost over.
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[46:51.000 --> 46:59.000]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom in just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[47:21.000 --> 47:42.000]  We'll be back with a warm today. Robert Barnes is here. Robert, before we went live on air, you were following live reports out of the show trial with Judge here in Connecticut.
[47:42.000 --> 47:48.000]  Explain to people, she is up there. I talked to Norm and he was off on break. He's in the courtroom. He confirmed what you said.
[47:48.000 --> 47:55.000]  She said, I'm just looking to put him in jail. He will give yes or no answers or I don't know or he's going to go to jail and I'm not going to really let him talk.
[47:55.000 --> 48:00.000]  So I mean, imagine I'm supposed to just go up there and then be a puppet for the jury.
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.000]  That's exactly right. It's supposed to be play a scripted role. Here's your role to play the villain.
[48:04.000 --> 48:15.000]  And if you give the truth that the truth is you're not this villain, if you testify truthfully, if you testify, honestly, we've all seen the open TV shows and the movies.
[48:15.000 --> 48:22.000]  It says, you know, I swear to testify to give the whole truth, to give nothing but the truth. So help me God.
[48:22.000 --> 48:30.000]  So the judge is actually creating a perjury trap whereby you getting up there and not testifying truthfully, you can be accused of perjury.
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  But if you do testify truthfully, you go into jail for contempt.
[48:34.000 --> 48:41.000]  So again, even local media, national media now is going, I don't like Alex Jones, but this is true. You what?
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  Everyone's having their rights rod of it. And even our audience is like, could this really be happening?
[48:45.000 --> 48:59.000]  Folks are promoting pedophilia on national television. The head of the national media system in Spain last week said pedophilia is good, children should have sexual adults.
[48:59.000 --> 49:07.000]  It's a global program. Whether you're in Spain, whether you're in Germany, whether you're in Canada, whether you're in the U.S., it's the same global corporate cult.
[49:07.000 --> 49:21.000]  Because if they can screw our kids and put poison shots in us and have show trials and devalue our currency and ship infantile and dissolve borders and human smuggle hundreds of thousands of children and millions of people and blow up pipelines and start wars,
[49:21.000 --> 49:28.000]  all of this, they can get away with anything. And that's what they're doing right now is going for broke, trying to break our will.
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.000]  That's why we can't give in. Things will only be worse if we give in.
[49:32.000 --> 49:42.000]  We fought like hell against the poison shots, and they intended to have three, four shots a year. They brought up their fourth shot. Everybody's saying no, 99% are saying no.
[49:42.000 --> 49:50.000]  So as negative as I get, and as frustrating as things are, ladies and gentlemen, we're at least fighting back and I'm so proud of everybody.
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.000]  Now, listen, I went into bankruptcy because if they get all these big judgments, they can then come and shut down the company.
[49:56.000 --> 50:02.000]  But if we're in bankruptcy, it can only be profits in the company. And there's almost no profits. And I need time to do these appeals.
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.000]  And I thought the bankruptcy would be a little bit smoother than it is because we're an open book.
[50:07.000 --> 50:14.000]  But it's been a bit rocky and the judge fired the CRO that we didn't even know that the court basically recommended.
[50:14.000 --> 50:22.000]  And the lawyers, now it works as you hire outside lawyers. I am my lawyer, but then you have to have outside lawyers that oversee it.
[50:22.000 --> 50:27.000]  And the court said that they were not doing a good job and got rid of them. So new people are coming in.
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  We were doing great up until this point. I have a plan to stay on here.
[50:31.000 --> 50:36.000]  But the judge said I got to pay 40% of legal bills. I don't have the money to continue this on and do this.
[50:36.000 --> 50:43.000]  So I want to thank those that have donated, but it really will cost to finish this trial and the next trial and these appeals over the next year or so.
[50:43.000 --> 50:50.000]  $500,000 is a conservative estimate and we don't have the money. So this is a war. You want to fight and win a war. It takes money to win a war.
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  There's no place more important than InfoWars in this fight. So everybody, please go to GiveSimGo.
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.000]  The link is SaveInfoWars.com and make a donation.
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  But separately, that's just for my legal bills. And I hate to beg, but I need your help.
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  We want to stay on here to the decision you got to make.
[51:04.000 --> 51:09.000]  Separately go to InfoWarsStore.com and get the great reset and the War for the World signed.
[51:09.000 --> 51:16.000]  And then it's a fundraiser, limited edition signed copy, or get a regular price unsigned at InfoWarsStore.com.
[51:16.000 --> 51:21.000]  I want to thank all of you that have done that. Separately, we've got the InfoWars Super Sale going right now.
[51:21.000 --> 51:26.000]  The biggest sale of the year, 50 to 40% off across the board, X3 that does incredible things for your body.
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  You got to experience it. It takes two weeks to kick in on average.
[51:29.000 --> 51:33.000]  All three types of iodine your body needs that are fully absorbable, it's back in stock.
[51:33.000 --> 51:40.000]  50% off, DNA Force Plus, 50% off, Brain Force Ultra, 50% off, Brain Force Plus, two different new tropics, 50% off.
[51:40.000 --> 51:46.000]  Super Mill Vitality, 50% off, Alpha Power is a driver, it's not even stronger, 50% off.
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  It's all there. Fizzy Magnesium has double type magnesium, nobody else has that.
[51:50.000 --> 51:55.000]  The very best, most expensive, best type at a low price. It's back in stock, 50% off.
[51:55.000 --> 51:58.000]  All and so many other products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[51:58.000 --> 52:02.000]  And we got the shipping down to shipping within 24 hours, unless you order on a Saturday.
[52:02.000 --> 52:05.000]  So the bankruptcy kind of screwed up shipping for a few inches.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  They hadn't budgeted enough money to actually ship the product, the court ruled, of course, ship the product.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  So that held it up a few weeks. We're now clocked back up.
[52:11.000 --> 52:15.000]  I apologize for folks that got things that hung up, but for the last three weeks,
[52:15.000 --> 52:18.000]  we've been shipping within a day of the orders. Everybody loves it.
[52:18.000 --> 52:22.000]  So I really appreciate customers supporting us. InfoWarsStore.com.
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.000]  Every product we're selling, we have in stock in Austin, Texas, ready to ship to you.
[52:26.000 --> 52:31.000]  All you got to do is make the decision to try these great products, experience these great products,
[52:31.000 --> 52:36.000]  or those of you that have had the products and loved them to get them again and to experience it for yourself and others.
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.000]  InfoWarsStore.com. I thank you. I salute you. We're changing the world.
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  Whatever happens to me, it's worth it just to expose the deadly shot.
[52:43.000 --> 52:46.000]  I'm feeling really good right now. I want to thank you all for your prayer.
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  Final comments before I'll enjoy your text over Robert Barnes.
[52:49.000 --> 52:53.000]  We're facing a unique time in America, and it's up to the people at InfoWars and places like it to keep it alive
[52:53.000 --> 52:56.000]  and to keep America's freedom and liberty and dream and ideals alive.
[52:56.000 --> 53:01.000]  And what we're seeing is extraordinary challenges, but extraordinary obstacles breed extraordinary opportunities.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  And we force the enemy to come out in the open.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  This is like the Revolutionary War, but more serious, a more evil enemy.
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.000]  But we're going to win. Explain that to me. This is history, folks. This isn't a drill.
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.000]  Well, ordinary people like the audience of InfoWars already are winning.
[53:14.000 --> 53:18.000]  That's why there's been such extreme efforts to basically completely prohibit Alex from testifying.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  And to kill this family we built.
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  Oh, completely.
[53:21.000 --> 53:27.000]  To wipe out the political organization, the associations of people that together have made real the possibility
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.000]  of challenging these corrupted institutions of power.
[53:30.000 --> 53:36.000]  These institutions that have corrosively been corrupted over the last several decades and even part of the last century.
[53:36.000 --> 53:40.000]  Tell them what they're scared of. Our community, our people, in all their internal documents have come out.
[53:40.000 --> 53:46.000]  They fear community and independent systems forming, whether it's farms or ranches or schools or medicine.
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  They fear what we're doing here. This is the answer.
[53:48.000 --> 53:51.000]  Oh, absolutely. I mean, you even saw it from Putin's speech.
[53:51.000 --> 53:55.000]  He said, you know, why are these Western elites obsessed with controlling culture?
[53:55.000 --> 53:59.000]  Why are they obsessed with controlling independent means of information, controlling media?
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  Why are they preaching deviant values?
[54:01.000 --> 54:05.000]  Georgia Maloney, Bolsonaro, they're all, this is the war.
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.000]  Absolutely.
[54:06.000 --> 54:14.000]  What all of these different dissidents represent in their own voice, in their own way, is a unified challenge to elite power
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  that wants to manipulate the population into control.
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  They've always been obsessed with MKUltra.
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.000]  You're talking about Big Pharma. You're talking about Bill Gates.
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  You're talking about the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Amos Miller.
[54:25.000 --> 54:31.000]  All of these cases, all of these circumstances revolve around the elite's decisions and desires to control the rest of us.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  And they've been waging economic war to turn the whole country into a rust belt.
[54:34.000 --> 54:39.000]  I'm here 15 minutes outside Waterbury, totally gorgeous Connecticut.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  You can rent old houses.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  The security guys are staying in one for like $300 a night.
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.000]  It's four bedrooms that George Washington stayed in the Revolutionary War.
[54:48.000 --> 54:55.000]  We're staying in an old place that can have like 15 people in it for like $600 a night or something.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  Way cheaper than a hotel for all of us to stay here.
[54:58.000 --> 55:03.000]  That's a big security deal because I mean, imagine that there's all these old factories and things shut down around here
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  because the left and the globalists shipped it all to China.
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  This country's beautiful. This country's amazing.
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  And it's a ghost town, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:10.000 --> 55:16.000]  We rented these places and they said we might rent them five times a year for a bachelor party or something.
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  This country's beautiful. This country needs to be rebuilt.
[55:19.000 --> 55:20.000]  It needs to be loved.
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.000]  And just to see how they totally depressed this area pisses me off and every other blue area they control.
[55:25.000 --> 55:26.000]  No doubt.
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  I mean, in fact, I said we were going into the courthouse.
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  It's not a surprise the trial is happening here because it's the sign of decay everywhere.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  The decay of the American dream, decay.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  I mean, basically we brought a lot of immigrants here.
[55:36.000 --> 55:41.000]  We brought a lot of ordinary people here, people from the South came here and now you see them in states of despair.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  Where do you see long lines?
[55:43.000 --> 55:46.000]  You see long lines outside the public defender's office.
[55:46.000 --> 55:47.000]  Why is that?
[55:47.000 --> 55:54.000]  Because they've destroyed the economic base, the industrial base, the worker base of America in places like these small towns in Connecticut.
[55:54.000 --> 56:00.000]  Well, you know, Kissinger has as a state out in the countryside and that's a world we cannot continue to have.
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  And it's a world that ordinary people are the only ones able and capable to resist.
[56:04.000 --> 56:10.000]  And we're at unique time where we're able to push back and it's thanks to ordinary people keeping places like Info Wars alive.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  And it's only because places like this are alive that the American dream is alive.
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  And we keep hammering it, folks, because you're the resistance.
[56:17.000 --> 56:18.000]  I mean, you really are.
[56:18.000 --> 56:21.000]  Not like we're saying we change the world together and we've got a fighting chance together.
[56:21.000 --> 56:22.000]  We're just saying it.
[56:22.000 --> 56:23.000]  We're really doing it.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  So I want to thank the great Info Wars crew.
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  I want to thank Owen Shroyer.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  I want to thank all of our team that's under massive attack.
[56:28.000 --> 56:33.000]  And I just thank you all for your prayers, your word of mouth, your support, because Info Wars is the tip of the spear.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  Again, I'm strongly considering just not testifying.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  It's doing press conferences today and tomorrow because I'm not allowed to really testifying.
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.000]  It's all rigged.
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  So that's all coming up.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  Look for some big announcements today at InfoWars.com.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  Owen Shroyer from Austin, Texas.
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.000]  Thanks, Robert.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  All right, Alex and Robert Barnes.
[56:49.000 --> 56:50.000]  Thank you very much.
[56:50.000 --> 56:57.000]  I'll be looking forward to the announcement from Alex as well as it's just kind of a day to day process.
[56:57.000 --> 57:04.000]  Hour to hour, sometimes even minute to minute, just deciding how we're going to handle certain situations.
[57:04.000 --> 57:11.000]  And the challenge is like we've got to have our head on a swivel for all the attacks incoming.
[57:11.000 --> 57:27.000]  But then also we have to be able to be completely diligent and focused on our news coverage so that we can continue to reach the standard of being the tip of the spear when it comes to the truth in a world of deceit and lies.
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  And we're up to that challenge.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  That's why you support us.
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  That's why you pray for us.
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  That's why you spread the links.
[57:33.000 --> 57:39.000]  When we come back, I'm going to go to an important segment from Jesse Waters last night on Fox News.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  Jesse Waters, by the way.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  Wow.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  Thank God that he's on Fox News at night now.
[57:44.000 --> 58:11.000]  He's right there behind Tucker Carlson as far as his show, as far as I'm concerned.
[58:14.000 --> 58:20.000]  I'm an impotist towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[58:20.000 --> 58:30.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  I don't take the credit.
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  I give you the credit.
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  And now Info Wars is facing its darkest hours.
[58:37.000 --> 58:38.000]  It isn't going to give up.
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  Without your support, we can be shut down.

[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Jesse Waters took over his show, or launched his show, Jesse Waters Prime Time.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  I want to say a few months ago, and it has been probably the number two show on Fox News at night as far as I'm concerned with the content.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  Jesse Waters did a great segment last night on the open border issue.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  Here's a brief snippet from that segment.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Prime Time has exclusively obtained video of a painful of migrants, mostly teenage girls from Honduras and Guatemala, being dropped off at the Orange County Airport in Montgomery, New York.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  Unlike other flights, one didn't happen in the dead of night, and a patriot was there to film them all getting off.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  At Orange County Airport in Montgomery, New York, Ace Airways has just delivered another load of undocumented illegal aliens to our area.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  And there's a bus waiting outside for them.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  That will take them to who knows where.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  And this is the bus.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  They unloaded all kinds of luggage, looked like it was issued, black canvas bags.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  I can't imagine that everybody happened to purchase the same bag.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Police pulled that bus over in Montgomery, New York on suspicion of human trafficking.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  It turns out the bus was carrying about 50 teenagers from Guatemala, Venezuela, migrants, mostly teenage girls, and there were only three adults on the bus.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  The adults were from Texas.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  The plane came from Texas, but nobody knows where the buses were going.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  The police called the Department of Homeland Security, but they had no idea what was going on, which shouldn't surprise you.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  And then the police called Health and Human Services, which put out a statement that said that teenage girls were being taken to sponsors, whatever that means.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  And this was the third plane that had come in with underage migrants just in a week to this one airport in the middle of nowhere.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  No one in history has flown this many teenagers than Joe Biden, not even Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Is he reuniting all of these kids with their families?
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  No, most of these teenagers are going to sponsors.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  So who do you think is willing to sponsor an underage girl from Guatemala?
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  Exactly. Does Biden have any idea what happens to these kids?
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  After all, his team has already lost 20,000 migrant kids, lost them.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  And the teenagers, Biden's not losing to sex traffickers.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  He's making them suicidal.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  We reported Friday that thousands of young migrants in Biden's care have been slitting their wrists to escape from these military bases.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  So this is clearly not a top priority for the big guy.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  No one on his team can even admit we have a border crisis to begin with.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  Where's AOC weeping in her white pants suit?
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  She's probably busy planning the wedding.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  Our very own stupid son of a border douchey, Bill Malujan, asked some Democrats if the border was secure. Watch what happens.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  Do you believe the border is secure?
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  Well, I believe that we have to have a secure border.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  250,000 unaccompanied migrant children arrived at the border since President Biden took office.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  Some of them trafficked, some of them drowning in the river. Any issue with that?
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  Last question. Ma'am, is the border secure? Do you agree with the administration that the border is secure? We'll let you go.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  Chairman, one question. In your opinion, is the border secure?
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  I have to go give a speech. Didn't you hear me?
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  I heard you.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  It's a quick question. Is the border secure?
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  I'm Bill Malujan with Fox News. Do you have a few moments to talk about the border real quick?
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  I'm sorry, I don't.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  A few moments till your time is all we're asking for and we'll let you go.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  Reached out to your office, asked to talk to you last week. They blew us off.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  I appreciate it.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  It's 900,000 God a ways.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  Have a good day.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  Thank you.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  Democrats think if you ignore a problem, it just goes away.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  Everybody knows from personal experience that when you do this, the problem only gets bigger.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  Just ask your wife or your husband.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  In New York City, the city's public schools are being overwhelmed with migrant students flown in by Joe.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  Class sizes are doubling and many of the classes are being taught in Spanish.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  So half the class are American kids being taught in Spanish.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  Where's Randy Weingartner and all this? The head of the teachers union?
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  Well, we reached out to, you know, for her to comment and her response is tardy.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  There you go. Jesse Waters last night on Fox News. Great work, Jesse.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  Really great to see the likes of Tucker Carlson and Jesse Waters every night.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Really, it's actually enjoyable to watch cable news for a couple hours a night now.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Haven't had that in a long time.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  This family that is InfoWars.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  have taken action and supported this show.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours. It isn't going to give up.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  Without your support, we can be shut down. Please go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  SaveInfoWars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  All right. I want to dig into this story I had mentioned earlier with Alex.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  And this is Yahoo News, folks.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  And I say that with emphasis because Yahoo.com is still one of the most visited sites on the web.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  And a lot of people have their home page just programmed to go there when they open their web browser.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  And plus, people see Yahoo. I mean, you think mainstream news, people think, okay, credible.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  I'm not saying that, but that's what people think.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  And so the fact that this was on Yahoo News is important because more people will see this story.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  Millions of eyes will see this story when it gets syndicated on Yahoo News.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  And so here's the headline.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  The FDA misled the public about ivermectin and should be accountable in court, argues the association of American physicians and surgeons.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  Now, I want to give some more framing to this and then revisit it.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  It's odd.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  I don't know if odd is the word, but there's something there.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  Remember, it was the FDA that came out and tried to blame Trump for the vaccines saying, oh, Trump made us do this.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  Trump made us push the vaccines.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  And so that was the FDA kind of trying to take a step back from the vaccine pushing saying, oh, it was Trump's fault.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  It was Trump's fault that we told people to get the vaccines before the testing.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  It was Trump's fault that the vaccines had so many side effects and are neither safe and effective.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  And that was the FDA trying to get out ahead of that, perhaps seeing what's coming in the future as the truth about the vaccines begins to emerge.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  So it's odd to me it's the FDA again part of this conversation.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  But of course, it's not just the FDA.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  It's not just the FDA at all.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  It was our entire government, all the different health sectors of our government, all pushing the same thing, all saying the same thing.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  They all misled the public and they should all be held accountable in court for at the very least involuntary manslaughter, I would say.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  I mean, I'd have to ask a lawyer that's an expert in malpractice, medical malpractice, and I would say, what is the standard protocol
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  if a doctor knowingly, willingly refuses to treat a patient with life saving treatment and then that patient dies?
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  What is the standard protocols for that medical malpractice?
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  So perhaps that's the better way to phrase it.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  It's medical malpractice, but it wasn't just all the health sector government operatives.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  It was also, of course, our politicians.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  It was also, of course, our mainstream media.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Now, they might have or they might claim they have plausible deniability or they may, as far as a legal concern is related to this, they might not be directly responsible.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  But we all know that they were along for the ride.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  We all know what they did to us, pushing the vaccines that have killed tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  And of course, denying you the truth about treatments like ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamin D, zinc, and so much more.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  And because those treatments were ignored, again, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people died.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  So, I mean, we're legitimately talking about, I mean, let's be conservative.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  They say what, like 1.2 million people died from COVID is what they say.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  Well, okay, you can believe that you cannot believe that.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  But we know for certain on a conservative number that hundreds of thousands of people died because the actual life saving treatment that was available for COVID was denied.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  And then you could add on the vaccine side effect deaths on top of that.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  But let's just kind of, let's even draw back a little bit more with a little bit more framing as far as the media is concerned here.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  So, Chris Cuomo got the ouster from CNN about six or so months ago.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  And that was mostly because he was working with his brother, the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, to help him beat the sexual assault allegations that were used against him.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  Now, oddly enough, I don't think anything ever manifested from those charges.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  And so, I don't know what the whole agenda to get rid of Cuomo was, he went from being the best COVID response to looking like a presidential candidate to then getting the ouster because of the assault allegations.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  And now he's the bad guy and Cuomo was trying to protect him with his show on CNN.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  So, he got the ouster.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  Well, Cuomo's back now.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  And he's got a new show on News Nation and he starts his transmission.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  Now, let's just also put this into perspective.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  Cuomo is not going to get any ratings.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  Cuomo was, I believe, when he left CNN, the number one rated show on CNN.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  He still wouldn't even be a top ten show on Fox News.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  But I believe he had the top ratings on CNN.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  He gets the ouster.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  So, he launches his show last night and he starts by ripping CNN.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  Saying, there's no group think established here.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  We all know what that means, that if you want to work at CNN, you have to do exactly what you're told and say exactly what you're told.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  Chris Cuomo admits that last night as he launches his new show.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  I say good for Chris Cuomo.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  It's too bad that you were a pawn of CNN for all those years, but hey, you made millions of dollars, so fine.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  But that's your fake news.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  So, let's apply it to the story.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  You could not go on CNN and say Ivermectin works.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  You could not go on CNN and say hydroxychloroquine with zinc works.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  You could not go on CNN and question the vaccine efficiency or effectiveness.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  That's what Chris Cuomo was talking about.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  He might not directly say that's the example, but that's what we all know was going on as far as that story is concerned.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  But it's not just CNN.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  It's all of the mainstream news from a local level all the way to the top.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  And that's what's so sad about the local news is that the local news is now so scripted and controlled that the average local news host, like a Christie Lee who works for us now,
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  the average local news host or reporter that actually used to have a passion for journalism and a passion for news.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  I've seen it.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  I've met these people when I was working in media growing up in St. Louis.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  I met a lot of people really passionate about their reporting, really passionate about their journalism.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  Well, that's all dead and gone now.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  Now all they're passionate about is their prestige and their bank account.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  And that's what being a network news anchor or a local news anchor or reporter means.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  Oh, I'm prestigious.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  I'm rich.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  I don't really care about journalism.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  I don't really care about reporting.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  So they never question anything.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  They never question the vaccines.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  They never question ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine and zinc because they care about their prestige being on the camera and getting that paycheck in their bank account every week.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  Chris Cuomo essentially calls that out.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  And so Trump, Donald Trump has now sued CNN for $475 million in damages.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  Now, think about this.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  There's so much, there's so many legs to the story.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  But you see what's happened now is the media is going to say, oh, Trump can't do this frivolous, all this crap.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  But yet they'll all celebrate when the left and all these globalist Democrat lawyers try to sue Info Wars and Fox News into submission and into bankruptcy.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  They celebrate that even though we all know who the real fake news is.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  And Chris Cuomo just admitted it.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  So yeah, can we all sue CNN?
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  Can we all sue the mainstream news that lied to us about the vaccines?
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  Can we all sue the mainstream news that lied to us about hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin?
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  What about suing the government?
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  And that's why we come back to the story on Yahoo News from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  The FDA misled the public about ivermectin and should be accountable in court.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  So how do we hold them accountable?
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  Who sues them?
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  Does it have to be the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons?
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  Does it have to be a class action lawsuit with hundreds of thousands of Americans?
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  We can sue CNN.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Trump decided to sue them. They can sue us.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  Well, what about our government that lied to us and their lives resulted in hundreds of thousands dead?
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  This is the question I think many lawyers and the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons are asking.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  How can we sue our government for lying to us about COVID and the treatments and the vaccines?
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  Look around you.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  Everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions is now happening.
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  Info wars credibility.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  My credibility has never been higher.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations,
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  It's unsustainable.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  Please visit SaveInfoWars.com. SaveInfoWars.com where you can make straight donations,
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  five, ten, fifty hundred dollars, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  I'll never give up. I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  Thank you for your support. Wouldn't be without you. SaveInfoWars.com.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the Globlestone.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars for the real reason we've had the success.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify it.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  because we are over the target and this dream is happening.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  By the will of God and by God working through you and your support,
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  InfoWars continues to persevere against attacks never before seen in the western world against independent media.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  And over the years you have come to the table. You have stepped to the plate so many times
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  and kept InfoWars and Free Speech on the air. And I thank you.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them and I need your support.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists,

[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom in just in the future,

[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  Alright, as we come in to the sounds of the final countdown, you wonder if this is at the final countdown towards a World War 3 nuclear
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  confrontation scenario. And it seems that there are certain world leaders that are hell bent on that result, no matter what,
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  including most of the Western leadership, political regime elites, military regime elite class all calling for a war against Russia,
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  all supporting a nuclear war against Russia. It's truly psychotic. It's mad scientist level.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  It's destruction of the planet level. And then they sit there and tell you about manmade climate change.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  How's the nuclear war work for that? Just curious. Oh, that's right. BuzzFeed News publishes the story saying a nuclear war would save us
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  from global warming. Not even kidding you. That's real. So I guess we know what they think about that.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  But there have been some major developments here and it's worth pointing out to this day and we've been keeping the record,
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  ladies and gentlemen, that to this day, there have only been three Western leaders and that's what we'll call them.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  I mean, you know, maybe it's not a fair blanket term, but it's been Donald Trump and it's been Elon Musk and it's been
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  Colonel Doug McGregor. I think it's been Colonel Doug McGregor. They put all these kernels on television,
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  but he's the only one that's telling the truth. I'm hoping I'm not getting his name wrong. I don't have it in front of me.
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  Who have been calling for deescalation and negotiations and saying, hey, let's not sit here as America and throw stones in our glass house here.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  Every member of the Biden administration is calling for a nuclear war with Russia. All the mainstream media is fully in the tank
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  for a nuclear war against Russia. All the liberal media fully in the tank for a nuclear war against Russia.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  It's actually stunning how far the liberal left has gone and it just shows you that they were never liberal.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  They were never leftist. They were never really anything other than conformists and statists and brainwashed minions
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  of the New World Order, sadly. So let's get into the developments here and it'll take me this segment and the next.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  Man, I hate those breaks, but folks, we're going to break it all down here in this segment and the next.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  So let's start with this, though. North Korea fires ballistic missile over Japan for first time in five years,
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  drawing quick response from U.S. and South Korea. Now, if this happened when Donald Trump was president,
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  you know what the press would be saying, but I guess let's not even go down that road.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  Biden is the president. And so this barely got any coverage last night.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  Now, you remember there was some saber rattling back and forth between North Korea and America when Trump was president.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  And it was the biggest story. Oh, Trump, he has no control over the world.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  Oh, Trump's going to get us into a nuclear war with North Korea. Remember all that?
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  Well, now North Korea is firing missiles and the media doesn't even blink.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  And they don't even say boo about it because it's Joe Biden.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  Now, the real question is this, and this is this is my theory and other expert theories on this geopolitical issue
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  of North Korea and specifically weapons testing.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  I don't think North Korea does anything without the behest of China.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  Or rather, I think that China basically treats North Korea like its junkyard dog.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  And if they say bark, North Korea barks.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  That's that's my opinion. That's other experts opinion on the matter.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  So the obvious question would be, why would North Korea fire a missile over Japan? Why?
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  What would be the purpose of that specifically for North Korea?
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  Well, it doesn't really make any sense unless it was at the behest of China.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  And China said, hey, why don't you pop one off and see how the world responds?
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  Because you have to understand that China is behind a lot of this stuff with their own military strategy,
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  knowing that the U.S. is weak right now and that the U.S. is preoccupied in Ukraine right now.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  And so China is kind of testing the waters. What can we get away with in North Korea?
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  What can we get away with in Taiwan? What can we get away with in Hong Kong?
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  And how distracted is the U.S. military and media to a missile launch in North Korea
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  as kind of a pressure test, if you will, to see what they might be able to get away with?
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  But Japan had the sirens going off. They had people evacuating, going into bomb shelters.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  So it was a very serious thing in Japan.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  But I was amazed last night at almost no media coverage.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  I mean, folks, like almost none. None at all.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  Specifically, I mean, it was mentioned on Fox News.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  But I mean, people have seen my setup. I monitor all the news all night long at my house.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  I'm like a...people, it's like an addiction.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  CNN and MSNBC pretty much only talk about January 6th and the midterms. That's it.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  They don't talk about anything else. So you didn't see anything about this.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  But there was some mentions on Fox News about it, but barely at all.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  It was a top story when Trump was president.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  Oh, Trump's out of control with North Korea. Oh, North Korea's going to start a war because of Trump, all this stuff.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  And then North Korea launches a missile with serious power behind it over Japan and the media barely blinks.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  Okay, well, I think that's China testing the waters to kind of see what the pressure is like
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  and the attention is like as they're strategically militarizing the South China Sea,
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  getting ready to go into Taiwan, maybe thinking about Hong Kong, they're in North Africa, they're cutting deals with Russia.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  Just trying to see, let's test the system here and the response from the American military and media.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  And they didn't get one. So believe me, that makes China feel pretty good.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  But now we get back to the liberal left.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  Now, I recall, I recall, you may recall this as well.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  This is, and the great irony here internally would be that during the Bush years,
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  Alex Jones by the uninformed masses or by the mainstream media would have been considered a liberal
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  because during the Bush years, Alex Jones was anti-war, anti-Bush, anti-regime change,
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  was pretty much the big story of the Bush years and the Republican Party at that time.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  And you may recall Barack Obama's big campaign issue in 2008 was stopping the regime change wars,
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  stopping the interventionism in the Middle East, stopping the expansionism, the imperialism, all that stuff.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  You may remember that, that was Barack Obama's big thing, campaigning against Bush.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  And he would even go after some of the classic politicians like Hillary Clinton saying,
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  hey, you're not going to do anything about this, you're part of it.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  Well, that's what helped Barack Obama win his presidential election in 2008.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  And so the understanding at the time, the political paradigm, liberals were against these wars,
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  Democrat voters were against the wars, and they didn't like expansionism, U.S. expansionism,
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  U.S. aggression in the Middle East and other parts of the world, U.S. imperialism.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  You've heard all of these different sayings.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  Well, boy, oh, boy, have they changed course.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  Boy, oh, boy, have they changed their policy.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  This is from the Daily Beast.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  Putin has left the world no other option but regime change.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  Wow.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  So liberals used to go from anti-regime change, anti-war, anti-expansionism.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  Now they want full World War III and a nuclear confrontation with Russia to get Putin out of office.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  They've lost their minds.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  Think about a world without Info Wars.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together,
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  this family that is Info Wars.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  Think about how Info Wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  have taken action and supported this show.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  I don't take the credit.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  I give you the credit.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  And now Info Wars is facing its darkest hours.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  It isn't going to give up.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  Please go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  SaveInfoWars.com today and donate for our Legal Defense Fund.
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  Look around you.
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  Everything I predicted from the Globalistone documents from their own admissions is now happening.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  Info Wars' credibility.
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  My credibility has never been higher.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly,
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees,
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  and I can't fund those myself.
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  It's unsustainable.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  So please visit SaveInfoWars.com.
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  SaveInfoWars.com where you can make straight donations.

[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  I'll never give in.
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:54.000]  But I could give out.
[1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  Thank you for your support.

[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  Well, so does he.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  So, picking it back up where we left off in the last segment, the Daily Beast, known liberal
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  left progressive Democrat rag, is now calling for regime change.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  This is the anti-regime change, anti-war liberal left.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  Now, pro-war, pro-nuclear war, pro-regime change.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  Well, what happened?
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  How did that happen?
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  Well, because the liberal progressive left has no real original ideas or mindset.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  They are conformists.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  They are statists.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  And they are under a technologically advanced system of mind control.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  And so, now they're pro-regime change.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  And that's the headline from the Daily Beast.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  Putin has left the world no other option but regime change.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  There's no other option, folks.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  There's no other option but regime change, says the Daily Beast.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  Who put the Daily Beast up to printing this story, I wonder?
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  Or did they become pro-war on their own volition?
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  There's no other option, they say.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  Peace is not an option.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  Not being involved in foreign intervention and foreign affairs is not an option, says the Daily Beast.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  Except when it was the Bush years, that was the only option.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  Now that it's the Biden years, it's the exact opposite.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  See how that works?
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  Yes.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  Yes.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  Now, tell me how this is going to go.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  Tell me how this is going to go.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  Now, strategically, strategically for the American people, or rather the United States of America as a whole,
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  strategically, Taiwan is way more important than Ukraine.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  But to the political class, to the political elite, to the political regime,
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  Ukraine is way more important than Taiwan.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  This is where they launder their money.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  This is where they launder their weapons.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  It's a big hive of corruption in Ukraine.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  Plus, they use Ukraine in their eyes to keep Russia at bay, let's say,
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  with NATO and putting the weapons on Russia's doorstep.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  So, now that the Democrats want us in a war with Russia,
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  which will be much bigger than just a confrontation with Russia in Ukraine like has been going on now,
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  it'll get much bigger than that.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  China is going to be putting the U.S. in a position to defend Taiwan or not,
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  and now all of a sudden the U.S. military is going to have all of these duties
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  thousands of miles away from our borders that are wide open that are being invaded.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  And tell me how that's going to go,
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  knowing that the U.S. military is severely depleted right now,
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  but not just depleted shrinking drastically.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  U.S. Army misses recruiting goal by 25%.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  U.S. Army misses recruiting goal by 25%.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  So, we're totally depleted now.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  All of our weapons have been given to Ukraine.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  Folks, that's another big story that's not getting reported.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  The U.S. military is so depleted right now because we've given so much weapons
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  and equipment and ammunition to Ukraine, we're like short-handed.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Now, remember, Barack Obama depleted the U.S. military strategically.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  Trump tried to revamp it.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  Biden has pretty much given all that revamp to Ukraine now and to NATO.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  And so, the U.S. military is in a bad way right now with a lack of numbers,
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  no new recruits coming in, and a leadership role that is totally anti-American.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  So, you tell me what's going to happen if we do end up in a larger war with Russia and Ukraine
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  or if China goes into Taiwan and Biden says we're going to defend Taiwan.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  It's not going to look good.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  We're going to be spread too thin and we're going to be outmanned and outgunned.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  And truthfully, we shouldn't have to worry about any of this
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  because the United States of America could be fully independent of all of this.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  We could be growing our own crops.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  We could be sourcing our own energy.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  We could be building our own microchip plants, but we don't.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  We outsource all that and so we now become dependent.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  And so then we have to defend Ukraine or we have to defend Taiwan.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  And it's not going to be good.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  So, the left calling for World War III with Putin or there's no other option but regime change
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  and only Donald Trump and Elon Musk and Colonel McGregor are saying this is insane.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  We need to stop this immediately, whether you like Russia or hate Russia.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  Us getting involved in a war with Russia is not going to help.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  And so what happens?
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  Well, you have Elon Musk coming out and making statements that I'll get to in a second,
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  but Glenn Greenwald, who is a real anti-war liberal, was on with Tucker Carlson last night
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  and he puts it all into perspective.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  No one's talking about ending Ukraine war for fear of being labeled a traitor.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  And I've talked about this before, folks.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  The risks, the risks of telling the truth in the American media right now are heavier than they've ever been.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  And nobody understands that better than Infowars.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  And so I'm telling you what the Democrats have planned next.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  When they get their war with Russia, which they're betting on,
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  they are then going to take any member of the media who isn't fully on board with attacking Russia,
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  nuking Russia, or removing Putin.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  And they're going to say you're a Russian asset and they're going to detain them and arrest them
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  and maybe disappear them forever.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  Democrats have done this before.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  And, you know, some may argue that it worked when in World War II,
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  Democrat leadership launched Japanese detention camps, huge detention facilities in California,
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  where they held hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  They found like a couple dozen spies and all of it.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  And so some said it was worth it.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  Others said it was a violation of human rights.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  But they're going to do it again.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  And so for anybody to go on air and say, I don't want war with Russia,
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  or, you know, Ukraine's maybe not the good guy here,
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  you're getting put on a list by the DHS and by the FBI and by the Biden administration.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  You're being put on a list.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  And when they launch their war against Russia, they're going to come for you.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  Absolutely, that is their plan.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  And when you remove the layers from this, you realize, oh,
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  maybe that's why they want the war so bad.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  Maybe the Democrats want the war with Russia so that they can take all the other independent media that still exists
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  and pose them as Russian collusion or Russian operatives or Russian spies.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  So that'll be their final way to just sweep up the rest of the independent media in this country
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  saying, oh, they're Russian assets.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  You don't think the Democrats would do that?
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  You don't think that's how the Democrat psychology works?
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  You haven't been paying attention.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  That is a guarantee, as sure as I'm sitting in this chair at the Info War Studios in Austin, Texas,
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  that Democrats are building a list with every single individual that's not for a war with Russia.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  And they do have a desire and even a plan to come arrest you and detain you, calling you a Russian asset,
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  just like they did with the Japanese in World War II.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  They'll do to us in a World War III scenario, guaranteed.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  And so maybe that's why the liberals want war so bad,
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  because they know they can use it to mop up the rest of their political opposition.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  So now you have others coming out and saying, hey, you know, getting into a war with Russia doesn't help us at all.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  It's going to hurt us.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  Former Pentagon adviser says U.S. likely attacked Nord Stream pipelines to isolate Germany.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  And again, that's Colonel Douglas McGregor.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  He's the only Colonel going on television and telling the truth about this.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  All the other ones are saying, war, war, war, and CNN and MSNBC drooling at the mouth.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  Some of the Fox News hosts as well.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  But of course, the U.S. had all of the motives to attack the Nord Stream pipelines
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  so that Europe would be forced to make deals with the West to get energy into Europe and not with Russia.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  Absolutely.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  And the Biden administration with Victoria Newland and Joe Biden himself both said,
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  no matter what, we will shut down that pipeline. That's their own words.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  And really, they haven't even denied that they've done it.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  They've kind of, you know, swished around it like, well, you know, it might be a good thing that it got blown up.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  Oh, really?
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  It's a good thing that critical infrastructure was just blown up in the middle of a giant energy war.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  I see.
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with a globalist.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  Yes, I've persevered.
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  But the listeners and viewers who support them for wars are the real reason you have the success.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this streak is happening.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.

[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  Building into a potential catastrophic world war three scenario in Ukraine
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  and the Western elites just frothing at the mouth for a nuclear war.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  Mostly the Democrats now, the liberals that claim to be anti-war, it's pretty funny.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  And we had mentioned that the U.S. military missed its recruitment goals by 25%.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  And so what's the solution?
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  Pregnant women can now apply for Air Force officer training school.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  Nice. Nice.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  And maybe the thousands of pregnant women they're bringing in here at the southern border,
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  maybe they can apply to and then they can become citizens and then they can vote for Democrats
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  after they give them a bunch of free stuff.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  Ah, no, that wouldn't happen, would it? No way.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  I want to get to the Elon Musk angle of it now because this again just shows you how insane the debate
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  on the situation in Ukraine has become and just how removed from reality really the entire debate has become.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  How emotionally dead it's become.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  Ukrainian ambassador to Elon Musk, no Ukrainian will ever buy your effing Tesla crap f off.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  And then other such statements have been launched towards Elon Musk from Zelensky and other Ukrainian diplomats
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  telling Elon Musk to eff off.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  Well, why would that be? Why would they be telling Elon Musk to back off?
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  Well, the simple reason is because he wants peace.
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  That's the simple reason.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  The more complex reason is that he's actually trying to have a negotiation for peace,
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  calling for peace, and he's somewhat involved in the situation.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  And that angers these totalitarians in Ukraine.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  But it makes you wonder why all these Ukrainian leaders are now saying eff Elon Musk when he's calling for peace.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  Well, where have the hundreds of billions of dollars gone that went into Ukraine to help fight against Russia?
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  Where did all that money go?
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  My guess is all the Ukrainian leaders shouting eff you at Elon Musk for calling for peace.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  My first guess would be looking to their bank accounts.
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  That would be my guess.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  Why do they want war?
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  Because they're making millions of dollars.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  And so here comes Elon Musk saying, hey, we should go for peace.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  Uh-oh.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  Well, that costs us millions of dollars.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  That affects our bottom line.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  We can't have peace.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  Why else would Ukrainian diplomats and officials and Zelensky be saying eff you to Elon Musk for calling for peace?
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  Because they want war.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  And they'll get rich off of it.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  But let's look at the Musk situation.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  Now, why did they get so mad at Musk?
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  All Elon Musk really did was propose, it was just a poll on Twitter.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  He says, Ukraine, Russia, peace, redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  Russia leaves if that is the will of the people.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  Crimea formally part of Russia as it has been since 1783 until Khrushchev's mistake.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  Water supply to Crimea assured Ukraine remains neutral.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  And this poll concluded earlier today and it had 40% saying yes to that.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  Well, 41% saying yes to that, 59% saying no to that.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  But that's just because it's a little convoluted.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  People don't understand the overall issue.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  And so I'll revisit that in a second.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  But Elon Musk understanding that the poll might have been confusing issued a new poll today that said Ukraine should decide its own faith, its own faith.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  And if you pull that up, you'll see I think the last I checked it was like 70% said yes.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  Which is essentially what Elon Musk asked in the original poll that got 3 million votes.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  He just reworded it so the average person could interpret it better and the results changed.
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  And so yeah, it's now basically the exact opposite of what the original poll was.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  Now 60% say yes, we should go for peace and 40% say no, we should go for war.
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  Because that's really what the poll is in the simplest terms.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  But okay.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  So then they all come out and they say F you, Elon, you're bad.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  You know, we're never going to buy your crap.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  Let's not forget as Elon Musk points out,
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  SpaceX's out-of-pocket cost to enable and support Starlink in Ukraine is $80 million so far.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  Our support for Russia is $0.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  Obviously we are pro-Ukraine.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  Trying to retake Crimea will cause massive death, probably fail and risk nuclear war.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  This would be a terrible situation for Ukraine and Earth.
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  And that's basically what he said is, hey, if we can avoid a war for basically the same results and save millions of lives, why wouldn't we do that?
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  Well, I don't know, there's a death cult that runs the planet apparently and they want to solve debt.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  And Liberals want a nuclear confrontation with Russia for a litany of reasons.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  But let's revisit the original poll.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, when Elon Musk says that the elections need to be redone,
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  that resulted in the annexation of the Ukraine regions into Russia,
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  there's already proof that those results were legitimate.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  And that is, if you just go back and you look at the results from the last Ukrainian elections,
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  where if you look at the disparity here, what do you see?
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  Eastern Ukraine, heavily blue, meaning they voted for the pro-Russian Genukovych,
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  and then Western Ukraine, mostly red and pink, where they voted for the anti-Russian Tamashenko.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  So Eastern Ukraine has been pro-Russian and the areas originally annexed by Russia,
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  which are in the Far East over here, down to the Crimea, this area right here,
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  you can see how deep blue that is. That's like just straight blue right here.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  These are the regions that got annexed to Russia.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  They were already voting pro-Russia, they already were pro-Russia, they speak Russian,
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  they don't like Ukrainian leadership.
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  And here's an example of that, that the media won't show you from a young family in Ukraine,
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  talking about this in clip 26.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  How do you feel about voting?
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  We are so happy that we are going to be a part of Russia, we are going to be a part of new history.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  We are very happy for this very important day for us, for all of us and vast people.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  I think I know how you voted, do you want to tell us how you voted or do you want to tell us what you voted?
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  Yes, I want to be part of Russia.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  Why did you vote?
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  Because already for eight and a half years we are suffering here under the war, under the bombs, so we want to live in peace,
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  we want to be part of a normal country which is supporting us, which is helping us all the time.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  That's why we voted yes.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  What has been like here for the last eight years?
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  For last what?
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  For the last eight years.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  Actually, we were living not here, we came back here like one year ago, but my family was here,
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  my mom, my auntie, my grandfather, so they were bombing all the time and no support from our country,
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  like in Ukraine, they never helped us for these eight years.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  All the time Russia was supporting us and giving us food and everything, whatever we need,
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  whatever the city needs, whatever people need, so that's why of course people don't want to be with them anymore.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  This seems to be a real happiness here today, joy, why is that today?
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  We are very happy today because we are going to live a normal life soon.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  Just a little more information here.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  Eastern Ukraine was filled with a bunch of western proxy groups lined up as an affront towards Russia
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  and they operate, they go down in the Middle East, they go into Syria, they go into a bunch of other regions
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  and they operate out of there.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  It was filled with the Azov Battalion Nazis, the literal lineage of Nazis that escaped to that region of Ukraine
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  after World War II, literally the descendants of Nazis, they run around with Nazi swastikas, Nazi symbols,
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  doing the Nazi salute, literal Nazis, and it was a war-torn region, it was a corrupt region
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  and Ukraine wasn't doing a damn thing.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  They were facilitating it and Russia was trying to help those people, so that's what that lady is describing.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  So yeah, when the Russians kicked out the Nazis and the Russians kicked out the western proxy groups,
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  the Ukrainian people were celebrating in Eastern Ukraine and you saw Russian flags and everything
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  and then they held the vote and they voted to join Russia.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  So you could redo that vote and you'll get the same results as you did in every other election
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  where Eastern Ukraine wants pro-Russian leadership and Western Ukraine doesn't.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  And so that's what's happened.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  And that's what Elon Musk is pointing out.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  But all he does is say, we should have peace, and by the way, I've only supported Ukraine, not Russia.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  Why are you coming after me? Why are you telling me to eff off?
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  And they continue to attack him and so Elon Musk responds saying, you are assuming that I wish to be popular.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  I don't care. I do care that millions of people may die needlessly for an essentially identical outcome.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  So Elon Musk now learning that the war hawks and the eugenicists want a war with Russia and I don't think he does.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions is now happening.
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  Info wars credibility. My credibility has never been higher.
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air.
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  It's unsustainable. So please visit saveinfowars.com.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  Saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  I'll never give up. I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  Thank you for your support. Wouldn't be without you. Saveinfowars.com.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:53.000]  By the will of God and by God working through you and your support.
[1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  Info wars continues to persevere against the attacks never before seen in the Western world against independent media.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  And over the years, you have come to the table.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  You have stepped to the plate so many times and kept info wars and free speech on the air.
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  And I thank you. But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them and I need your support.
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalist, please visit saveinfowars.com.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  And saveinfowars.com takes you to a URL that gives in go for direct Alex Jones legal defense fund.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:35.000]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making is almost over.
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  And right at the end, we're not giving up. We're not giving in, but we could give out.
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom in just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  I really appreciate all of you for being here today.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:21.000]  I have Robert Barnes, a well-known constitutional First Amendment and criminal lawyer who also worked on this case for several years.
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  He can give you documented evidence that we gave them all the discovery so they didn't have case.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  So they were forced to default us because I'm this villain that deserves to be found guilty by this kangaroo court.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  This is Americans this on trial, even the worst people in the world, which I'm not,
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  but even if I'm a bad person, as some say, I deserve my day in court.
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  Even the local newspaper admits, I'm not allowed to defend myself.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  It's not Alex Jones saying this. It's the Hartford Current, an article published yesterday.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  Alex Jones had to testify at Santa Hook Defamation Trial this week. Here's what we know.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  It says he's prohibited from defending himself.
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  They've had three weeks of people up there lying about me, twisting what I said,
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  and basically have a memorial for dead children I didn't kill.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  All in effect, not just on the Second Amendment, but now, ladies and gentlemen, on the First Amendment of this country.
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  This is not a trial. Now, I came here to testify two weeks ago. I came here this time to testify.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  And the judge today said that she will hold me in criminal contempt if I say I'm innocent, if I say I'm bankrupt,
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  if I say I wasn't the first person to question Sandy Hook and over 10 other things.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  No judge in U.S. history has ever told somebody what they can and can't say.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  I'm being ordered to perjure myself when they ask me questions or I'll be arrested if I tell the truth.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  This is outrageous and you're all having your freedoms stolen.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  In this article, in the Hartford Current and many others, they say I gave over no discovery.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  Then on the last page, they say their whole case is based on discovery.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  I didn't give them that they twisted that I can't respond to.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  Robert Marge is my spokesperson. He'll be able to give a statement here and we'll both take your questions.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  Robert Marge.
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  This is a case that has put the American justice system itself on trial.
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  And the trial that has taken place here, this show trial, is an embarrassment to the rule of law in America
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  and a disgrace and a travesty of American justice.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  Everybody knows you're supposed to get your day in court.
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  Yet the one person who is being denied any day in court is Alex Jones.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  To such a degree that the court has made clear today that if he testifies honestly, if he testifies truthfully, he goes to jail.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  But if he answers the questions in the way the plaintiff's lawyers want, then he could also go to jail.
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  No matter what he does, he goes to jail if he testifies in his own behalf, in his own defense.
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  That is in a core American right.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  This is a case you have to ask yourself, what is the truth that the plaintiff's lawyers are so terrified that the people here?
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  What is that truth?
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  That truth is that Alex Jones participated in discovery more than any media defendant in American libel law history.
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  A lot more than the New York Times did just down the road in New York in either the Project Veritas case or the Sarah Palin case,
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  as is detailed in the Hartford Current publication, which talks about the internal emails, internal documents, internal financial records,
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  all disclosed and divulged to plaintiff's lawyers.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  So this is a case where there has been a big lie, a fake case about supposed fake news.
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  It's a fake case because the story they told about Alex Jones was never true.
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  The story they told about Sandy Hook was not true in the sense that they blamed gun owners and blamed Alex Jones for what happened
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  when the reality is that school safety was not up to snuff at Sandy Hook.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  Democratic politicians decided to pocket money meant to protect little kids' lives and little kids died who didn't need to die
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  because politicians lied.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  That's the real truth of Sandy Hook, but they can't have any of that truth come out.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  They can't have the truth that Alex Jones and Infowars had nothing to do with promoting and instigating and originating those who had doubts about Sandy Hook.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  That came from media professors and school safety people and people completely outside of Alex Jones and Infowars.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  That's why they always had a fake case, and they won't allow them to tell the truth because the truth would let the world know that their case is based on a lie.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  And Bob, make the point you've made. You were involved in the first two years of the case.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  We gave them all this massive discovery that you see on the screen.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  Then they sit around and say we didn't give it to them so we're defaulted so we can't defend ourselves.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  Absolutely. Throughout the entire time frame, I challenge anybody out there to find any media defendant who has produced as many emails,
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  as many documents, as many internal policies, as many as all the broadcasts that were relevant here.
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, press conference from outside the courtroom. We'll be right back here on The Alex Jones Show.
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  As being the main impotest towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit.
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  And now Infowars is facing its darkest hours. It isn't going to give up.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:51.000]  Without your support, we can be shut down. Please go to saveinfowars.com today.
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:06:17.000]  Saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, quick programming note. We are going to be going back to the press conference right now.
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  We're archiving it and we're going to be playing it on the bottom half of this hour.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  So if you want to hear more from Jones and Barnes outside of the courtroom, stay tuned. That's coming up.
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  But I have a guest joining me now, Alan Dos Santos from TESRA Livre, a Brazilian journalist and reporter, talk show host,
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  who got the political persecution and banishment from the very Supreme Court in Brazil that freed the corrupt president Lula from jail so he could run again against Bolsonaro.
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:07:03.000]  And now in the first round of the Brazilian elections, Lula did get more votes than Bolsonaro, but did not get the simple majority it takes to win.
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:07.000]  So there'll be a follow-up election. I believe that date is October 30th.
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  And so I wanted to get Alan on here to discuss. Alan, I'll just open it up to you with my basic questions.
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  And I was asking some friends of mine in Brazil how they felt about the results.
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  And they said the same thing that I was thinking was they were stunned.
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  They were shocked that Lula had such success. They couldn't believe it.
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  And these are liberals that don't like Bolsonaro. They voted for NOVA and some of the other candidates that barely got any votes.
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  They said, yeah, I voted for these candidates. I knew they wouldn't win, but I couldn't vote for Lula, even though I don't like Bolsonaro.
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  You know, they think he's, you know, right-wing fascist, whatever, but they know Lula's corrupt.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  So I'm looking at this. I'm seeing some other Brazilian reporters reporting what we saw when Biden won, which was Bolsonaro up,
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  and then these massive ballot dumps come in 100% for Lula and then putting him on top.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  So what is your takeaway from the Brazilian presidential election? Lula getting more votes than Bolsonaro.
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  What do you think happened? Do you trust the results and what's coming next? Alan Dos Santos.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  First of all, thank you for having me here, Owen. It's a pleasure for me being here in the Info Wars, and I can assure you it's a rigged election in Brazil.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  This fraud don't shock me, but shock a lot of people that still do not realize what communists are capable to do.
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  When we were following all the numbers and the results and official website of the Supreme Court, we saw something stopped in kind of being frozen
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  from the 66.66%. And that moment...
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  You're talking about the total number of ballots counted? Where does that number come from?
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  Yeah.
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  Wow. So they stopped it at 66.6. They stopped the counting.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  Yeah.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  Oh, my gosh.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  So they stopped, that got frozen, and then Lula started to have more votes than Bolsonaro.
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  And not just few votes, 7 million votes.
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  But the problem is, if you see the streets, all the videos, it's a viral internet.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  You can see that clearly Lula couldn't bring anyone to the street for the rallies or anything.
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  And when you see Bolsonaro, even place that Bolsonaro wasn't able to go was more, way more packed.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  And the crowd was bigger.
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  So it's a lot like what we saw in America.
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  Trump 20, 30,000 people every rally, Biden 300 max.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  We saw virtually the same thing with Bolsonaro and Lula.
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  Yeah.
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  The situation is more clear when you see that Twitter is already doing the same in Brazil right now.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  So Matthew Turman from War Room and Project Veritas, he can't post anymore on Twitter.
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  He just got his account, I think, was blocked.
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  You talking about Bolsonaro?
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  No.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  Matthew Turman from the Info Wars, from Project Veritas.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  Okay, got you.
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  So they're censoring journalists reporting on this now?
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  Yeah.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  In English.
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  My account, of course, it's already blocked in worldwide.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  And you cannot save fraud anymore.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  You can't post anything on Instagram, Twitter, anywhere else, and they will just block your account.
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  So a lot of people are afraid to say the truth, saying that we need to work on the second turn right now.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  The second election, it's going to be in the end of October.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  And people are now, let us not talk about fraud because we need to get more votes for Bolsonaro, trying to kind of void another fraud.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  But I don't believe that's going to be enough because they are corrupted.
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  They are criminals.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:24.000]  I mean, it's proven already that Lula da Silva has been proven the most corrupted person in the world, not only in Brazil.
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  And how can you believe that people he nominated to the Supreme Court will count the votes and tell us the truth?
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  And a lot of videos on internet is already showing people trying to hit the green button to confirm their votes and they can't end their moments on these voting machines.
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  And these voting machines, you know, right?
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  They have been a problem here in America, but everything started in Brazil.
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  And that's why Trump retweeted me during the election because I spoke about these voting machines back then.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  And it's happening in Brazil.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  And I don't believe they are not going to fraud again.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  I do believe they will.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  They will really make this election rigged as it was on last Sunday.
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  So obviously there's, you know, about three weeks until the second round, which will be Lula versus Bolsonaro on the ticket.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  You have to get a simple majority so they bring it to the final two contestants.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  I mean, what pushback are we seeing or are you seeing from Brazilian media?
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  Are they being bullied not to talk about fraud as well with the threats of censorship?
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  Are they just fully in the tank for the communist criminals and their representative Lula to be president again?
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  I mean, what is Bolsonaro's option?
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  If he doesn't trust the election results, where do we go from here?
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  Well, it's a mystery, to be honest with you.
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  Bolsonaro has the army in Brazil.
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  It's also doing the auditing, the audition, sorry, for the election results.
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  So we are waiting to see what the armed force will say about it because this is kind of the last hope.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  Someone proving not only mathematically, because mathematically it's already proving.
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  You can see the results.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  It's not possible to have this kind of pattern.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  You know, the election is going in such a way and then everything changes after a frozen time.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  And Bolsonaro or he can get way more votes and even with a fraud, he could win because I don't know if you are familiar with this situation.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  You need to have a lot of votes for avoiding this fraud and way more than you can ever imagine.
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  But I do not believe they're going to let Bolsonaro win because Bolsonaro just got the Congress and the Senate.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  So if they allow Bolsonaro win naturally, I mean, just counting the votes,
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  Bolsonaro would have another Senate to impeach Alexandre de Morais, the Supreme Court Justice.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  And he also could pass every bill, every law that he could do in favor of Brazil for the first time.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  We never had this kind of Congress that we are going to have next year.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  So I do not believe they're going to do that.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  What options Bolsonaro have in a table, honestly, only the army, the army could speak about what they have seen on election and try to do something,
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  maybe arresting these criminals because they are, this is my opinion, they should be arrested because they are all criminals.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  Lula da Silva, Alexandre de Morais, the Supreme Court Justice.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  If you see on old news, not recently, but if you see some old news when Alexandre de Morais got nominated to the Supreme Court,
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  you see some accusations that he was a lawyer for a company honored by some criminals organization called PCC.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  These organization has been declared terrorist group here in the United States.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  This is just amazing. So many similarities between what happened in the U.S. and 2020.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:16:08.000]  Alan Dos Santos on the air with us breaking down the Brazilian election. We'll be right back.
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new war we've ever had.

[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.

[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  We're covering the Brazilian elections and, you know,
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  just to kind of reemphasize here, so many similarities between the 2020 US elections
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:38.000]  and the last election between Bolsonaro and Lula,
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  which is going to be a runoff on October 30th.
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  But you know, actually Alan, I mean,
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  Bolsonaro's rallies were probably bigger than Trump's.
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:50.000]  I mean, if we're being perfectly honest, I mean,
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  Bolsonaro had rallies that were, looked like 50, 60, hundreds of thousands of people showing up.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  And as you said, Lula couldn't even have rallies because nobody would show up.
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  And so where are all these voters coming from?
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  Again, I talked to some of my friends in Brazil,
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  some of them like Bolsonaro, they don't trust the results.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  The others that don't like Bolsonaro or Lula that are on the liberal side of the aisle,
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  they were voting for some of the down ticket candidates.
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  But they don't want to question elections, you know,
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  because they don't want to think that that might be what's going on,
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  but they're a little skeptical knowing that Lula is a convicted criminal.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  And so getting back to where we left off, I mean,
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  Bolsonaro is basically in a position now where,
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  unless he's had some sort of a plan prior to this going down,
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  they're just going to call him a military strongman or a dictator or anything
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:43.000]  if he, you know, he tries to deny the results or say that there was fraud,
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  just like they did to Trump, and then they'll go after him with as much charges as they possibly can.
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  I mean, how do you see this playing out?
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  As I told you before, there is a parallel conning votes that the armed force are doing
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  because they said if they couldn't have a clear and honest election,
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  that could be a national security affairs.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  So that was written by the Defense Secretary of Defense in Brazil months before the election.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  So now we are waiting for these results and probably,
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  or Bolsonaro has everything under control,
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  or we're going to have Lula da Silva region this election clearly in front of everyone,
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  in front of our nose.
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  I do believe it's dangerous trust that you can redo something after the Communist taking power.
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:53.000]  Like here in America, you have the best laws and regiments, everything.
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:58.000]  I mean, the structure of the United States is way better than our,
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  for example, constitutional structure, you know?
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  So we do not have as many tools as you have here in the United States,
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  and even United States couldn't redo this rigid election.
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  So I'm afraid to say that I don't believe it's possible to redo these results once you accept the rigid election.
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  And these phenomena that people are afraid to say it was fraud, that was rigid.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  It's happening in Brazil right now.
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  I saw this here in the United States with my own eyes.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  Everyone knew that a lot of people were afraid to say that truly and honestly,
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  or because they could lose likes and share or money, I don't know.
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  But they were afraid to say the truth.
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  Just few people said that Infowars was one of them.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  That's what is happening right now in Brazil.
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  People are afraid to say the obvious because it was a shameful, I'm sorry, shameless, rigid election.
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  They are not ashamed what they are doing.
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  This is what communism does.
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  They are not afraid to do whatever they want, whatever it takes to take the country back.
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  And there is a plan in South America to unite somehow Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil, Colombia,
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  all these countries together with the drug dealers in Cuba to be a place, a paradise for China.
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  This is very clear for everyone in Brazil.
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  If the person did not see that, it's not seen the reality.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  And sometimes they think it's possible to fight against this criminal following the rules.
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  You can't because they create every new rule, in a sense, while they are losing the game.
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  You can't trust them at all.
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  How can you trust they will count the votes correctly in the second round if they already rigid the first round?
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  I'm afraid that we cannot redo this situation unless the army will show up with the parallel results of the election.
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  And I see them on the screen.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  Lula was probably the biggest event they just had on the screen, a couple thousand people.
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  And it's all people clad in red, and this theme color is red, like the Chinese flag.
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  But you look at the Bolsonaro rallies, it's just hundreds of thousands of people, yellow and green, waving their Brazilian flags.
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  The optics there are incredible.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  Now, I'm not as familiar with the military situation in Brazil.
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  I've got a bit of an idea, but correct me if I'm wrong here.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  Trump had military sabotage.
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  Trump had top military generals and stuff sabotaging him the whole time.
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  It's my understanding the Brazilian military is actually really behind Bolsonaro.
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  I mean, he was a member of the military himself.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  Is that a correct analogy that the military is really strongly behind Bolsonaro?
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  I'd better say they are really constitutional defenders.
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  They don't take sides politically, but they know what the enemy is and what the enemy is going to do.
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  The situation of the Brazilian army is different than Venezuela, for example, where Chaves kind of bought them all.
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  We're not nominating them to some places they would like to go.
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  But in Brazil it's different, and I do believe they're going to defend the constitution.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  The only one problem that I see is how clear is the situation for them.
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  I don't know if they think it's possible to change things, not arresting these criminals.
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  They let a lot of things happen already, but I do not believe this is because they do not want to defend Brazil.
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  And they do not want to defend the constitution.
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  The problem is once you have no, how can I say that? It's hard for me in English, but once you do not understand very well how this enemy operates,
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  you probably can be fooled.
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  And I do believe they can be fooled sometimes because they think they cannot do anything like the military regime where they arrested all these criminals.
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  Some of them, some generals, are afraid of the media.
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  I can tell you for sure because I've met some of them.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  They're afraid of the media speaking like, oh, there is a military coup or something like that.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  I'm not talking here. Let me be clear here. I'm not talking about military coup.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  I'm just saying you can arrest some criminals because you have...
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  But it's the same fear, it's the same fear of not telling the truth about the results.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  It's the same fear. I mean, look, nobody wants to start a war. Nobody wants to become an authoritarian to defeat authoritarianism.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  Exactly.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  And so that's the problem. Alan, we'll stay in touch. I appreciate you joining me today.
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  Let's talk again either before or after the next round.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  There's any breaking news? Where can people follow you and your work?
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  On Gator, I'm there. Alan Santos, BR, as Brazil. It's double L in my name, and I'll be there.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  Alright, Alan, thank you so much for joining us today and trying to get some truth about the Brazilian elections out there.
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  I don't see much media covering it here, and so I appreciate you coming on.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  And folks, it's really important. I mean, Bolsonaro is like the best populist, nationalist, pro-human leader on the planet right now.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  I mean, we gotta protect this guy. We gotta protect Brazil. They need to be our ally.
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  I'm gonna ask all of you today to help keep me on the air. In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations,
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:36.000]  but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.

[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  Coming up here now, we barely plugged today. That's a problem. We need to pay the bills around here. We need to stay on air. We need to make sure the crew gets paid.

[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  You know that most people probably don't have professional dietitians and can't be making sure they get all their daily values of nutrients and vitamins and everything.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:32.000]  So you can make sure you're healthy supplementing. That's why we sell top rated top selling supplements at infowarstore.com.

[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  So that's all happening at infowarstore.com. Don't forget about Alex Jones' new book, The Great Reset in the War for the World.
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  Get the autographed copy, still selling autographed copies right now at infowarstore.com.

[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  Amazon gets their little cut, but it keeps it at the top of the seller's charts and so it kind of is a wash there, if you will.
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  All right. Those are the great ways to support us, folks, to keep us on the air.
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  Don't take info wars for granted. Don't take these transmissions for granted.
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  If you want to see us on air, if you want to see info wars into the future, shop at infowarstore.com.
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  All right. The biggest liar in the history of press secretaries and that's saying a lot, folks.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  I mean, we're talking about the likes of Jay Carney. We're talking about the likes of Jen Psaki.
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  I mean, these are just liars and Karine Jean-Pierre takes the cake.
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  So, but granted, in her defense, she's in a completely unsolvable situation.
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  She's forced to go out there and lie for Biden every day. It's an impossible job.
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  And it is her job is to lie. And so, of course, but this is just, it's just clown world ish.
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  I mean, that the cabbage patch press secretary is just clown world ish in the recent press briefing where folks,
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  they're trying to make and stick to the claim that Joe Biden and the Biden administration has saved Americans money on gas.
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  And I'm not even kidding you. And by the way, they did have a little down tick in the price of gas nationwide.
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  Barely. When Biden got in, the average price was $2.20 a gallon. Now it's about $3.50 a gallon.
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  So it's up $1.30. They claim that's down. They claim being up $1.30 is down.
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  I mean, that's the level of lying these Democrats will go to.
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  But understand this in 35 days after the midterms, your price per gallon will go up by a dollar within a week.
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  I'll predict right now. So they're synthetically trying to lower the price of gas ahead of the midterms.
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  As soon as the midterms are over, you watch gas prices or skyrocket again.
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  But here's Jean Pierre, the cabbage patch clown press secretary telling you that the Democrats and the Biden administration have lowered gas prices.
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  Unbelievable. Don't believe your own lying eyes. Don't believe the world you actually live in.
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  Believe the lying Democrats in the Biden administration. Here it is.
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  Our consumers now in California paying $6.41 a gallon for gas. Nevada, $5.51, Oregon, $5.46. Who can afford that?
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  And we understand that. That's why the president works so hard the past several months to make sure they can do everything.
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  Pause it. What? The president has worked so hard the past couple months to get gas prices down. What has he done?
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  What work could she possibly cite emptying the strategic petroleum reserves to the lowest level in modern history?
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  Is that good work? Selling our gas to China, selling our gas to Europe? Is that the work?
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  What work? Taking a vacation every weekend from Friday through Monday, leaves Friday, returns Monday?
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  Every weekend? Is that the work? What work is she possibly talking about?
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  That's why the president has done such hard work to lower gas prices. The question was gas prices are up.
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  How can people afford it? And the response is that's why we've lowered gas prices.
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  Again, the question is they're up. What are you doing? So, okay, here's Jean Pierre, professional liar for the Bidens. Go ahead.
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  So hard the past several months to make sure that he did everything we can to bring gas prices down.
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  We have seen, fastest, I know you're pulling out a couple of areas across the country and I get that.
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  And we understand that there's more work to do. We have never said that we were done here.
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:33.000]  We have always been very clear that there is more work to do. But we have seen, the reality is we have seen the fastest decline
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  in gasoline prices in over a decade. That's because of what this president has done.
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  Pause it. Pause it. Folks, pause it and rewind it for me. Pause it and rewind it back to that end.
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  I mean, this is just unreal, man. This is just, she sits up there with a straight face and tells you they have lowered,
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  they have record low gas prices. I mean, this is like if I'm a restaurant, let's say I'm a cheeseburger restaurant
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  and cheeseburger, a normal cheeseburger at my restaurant is $5. And then let's say the next day you show up
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  and a cheeseburger is $30. You say, whoa, a $30 cheeseburger, well, I can't afford that.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  And then they show up the next day and the cheeseburger is $10. They say, boy, a $10 cheeseburger,
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  I can't afford that. And the cheeseburger shop owner says, whoa, what do you mean you can't afford it?
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  We just, that was a record price slash. We just had record price slashing on cheeseburgers.
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  And you scratch your head and you say, wait a second, two days ago I bought a cheeseburger for $5. Now it's $10.
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  That's double the price. You're telling me you cut the price, but you doubled it.
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  That's what this press secretary is telling you right now. How can Americans believe this?
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  How can a Democrat ever win an election? How can the, because the American media is so corrupt
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  and they're all sitting in that courtroom right now with their tongue up Joe Biden's ass
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  that they can't sit here and call out the blatant lies from this press secretary.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  It's disgusting. The American media is disgusting. You people are sick.
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  A Democrat should never win another election in this country.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  I think Tulsi Gabbard doesn't, doesn't run as a Democrat anymore. Now she goes down in Hawaii and does videos
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  teaching people how to shoot firearms. Yeah, that's going on now.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  This Democrat party is sick and the American media letting them get away with these lies is even sicker.
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  So play it again and we'll finish it here. I'll shut up. They say they've saved you money on gas
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  while you're paying more money than you ever have on gas.
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  Thanks Green. You said the president was responsible for gas prices coming down.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  Is the president responsible for gas prices going up?
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  So it's a lot more nuance than that, right? No, it's not.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  Peter, you know this. There have been global challenges that we have all have dealt with when I say all,
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  meaning other countries as well have dealt with since the pandemic.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  Biden's the disaster.
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  There's been Putin's war and Putin's war has increased gas prices at the pump.
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  We have seen that over several months and what the president was able to do,
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  he took some historic steps when you think about the strategic petroleum reserve
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  and making sure that we were able to do everything that we can to bring that cost down
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  for American families, give them a little bit more.
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  I mean, it's just an outright lie, guys, and everybody knows it. Pull it down.
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  But imagine saying, oh, it's Putin's fault that the gas prices are up.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:40.000]  Okay, so you just admitted that Vladimir Putin is kicking Joe Biden's ass politically.
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  Okay, so I guess that's what you're sacrificing now.
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  Unbelievable lies coming from this press secretary.
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  I can't believe we live in this country under such a state.
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  This can't go on. It's only going to get worse.
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:43:06.000]  Alex Jones press conference coming up on the other side.
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  Main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:32.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:38.000]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit.

[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  This really is the missing link.

[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the Globals.
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:09.000]  not just in America, but in the world.
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  We are engaging the Globals at point-blank range in the information war.
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them for wars
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  are the real reason we've had the success.
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new war we've ever had.
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:33.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you.
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:49.000]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[2:46:49.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  because we are over the target and history is happening.
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:47:04.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  This is a broadcast that we're relevant here that has ever been defaulted.
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:28.000]  This has never happened.
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  Default is now being used and politically weaponized to take away people's right to trial by jury.
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  And here you're seeing it live. You're seeing it reported in the Hartford Current.
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  If he gets up and testifies, truthfully, he goes to jail.
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:45.000]  How is that consistent with the American legal tradition at all?
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  How is that consistent with what we view as American law?
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  You can hate Alex Jones all you want.
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  All of us to have the right to our day in court.
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:56.000]  All of us to have a right to trial by jury
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  because the moment that is taken away, this is no longer American justice.
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  This looks like Soviet style show trial justice.
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  This looks like justice that even Castro would have been ashamed to do in the show trials in Cuba in 1961.
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  That is what is taking place here in Connecticut.
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  The heart of part of the American Revolution that established these founding principles
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  that we go that all go all the way back to the Magna Carta.
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  You're right to trial by jury. You're right to your day in court.
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  And Alex Jones is now being told if he asserts that right, he goes to jail.
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  If he testifies truthfully, he goes to jail.
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  That is not American justice.
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  Not allowed to say I'm innocent because a judge says I'm guilty.
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  Absolutely. Not allowed to defend himself about anything.
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  Not allowed to tell them he almost never talked about Sandy Hook.
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  Not allowed to tell them that more than 99% of what Info Wars reported about Sandy Hook said Sandy Hook happened.
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  And these plaintiffs lawyers have said here and insist they want me silence, period.
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  Well, even somebody on death row deserves their free speech.
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  So think about that. They want me off the air because they want to shut down the American people.
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  In fact, he said so in the opening statement, the plaintiff's lawyer did.
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  Why are they so scared and terrified of the truth?
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  Why are they so afraid of the people hearing the truth?
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  If what they say about Alex Jones is true, why aren't they willing to allow Alex Jones to have his day in court?
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  These are questions every American should ask.
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  But more importantly, every American, we must defend the speech we most disagree with if free speech is to stay alive.
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  This is one of the core principles of the founding generation.
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  And that principle is at stake and at risk in this trial, which by itself has made the American justice system now in danger.
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  Because the very things that we hold sacred in America, that we allow people a full chance to present their testimony in court,
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  right to counsel, right to free speech, right to due process of law, all of them eviscerated simply to caricature and stereotype Alex Jones to the world
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  and then to strip him of the means to ever talk to the world again.
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  And they admit they're saying the precedent for everybody else using me just like my deplatforming four years ago.
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  Absolutely. This is about freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of press, freedom of inquiry.
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  Here you have a case where ex-FBI agents or current FBI lawyers are suing who don't know anybody who died in Sandy Hook.
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  They never said their name.
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  How is that?
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  If FBI agents can now sue people for raising questions about what took place in various cases, does everybody who questions the government now go to jail?
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  Does everybody who testifies truthfully in their own defense, do they all get bankrupted into oblivion?
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  Because that is the future we face if we allow precedents like this to be set.
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  They have used the historical example of Alex Jones to set the template for mass censorship and the legal weaponization of our legal system
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  against the interest of ordinary everyday people, and it will be turned on the rest of us if we don't turn back now.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  All right, Robert, we'll take a few questions. I just want to say this on the record.
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  I am proud of my 28 years on air, exposing Jesse Smollett, being a fraud, exposing WMDs, being a fraud.
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:11.000]  I always question everything. I listen to those that are questioning. It's healthy and good.
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:17.000]  And I do not apologize to the system or anybody else because I did it from a pure heart.
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  I've not been perfect. I've made mistakes, and I apologize from those.
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:27.000]  We have a government that just blew up the gas pipeline and is starting a massive escalation of war with Russia.
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  We live in a country with mass human smuggling across the border and a completely collapsed system.
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:42.000]  And so the establishment thinks by demonizing Alex Jones and trying to shut me down that they're going to be able to intimidate everybody else to shut up.
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  This political establishment is collapsing and is almost universally hated.
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  And they think by turning me into a demon, they're going to be able to scare everybody else off from telling the truth.
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  So the front page of Yahoo News today was reporting that Google and the UN censored hydroxychloroquine and other treatments for COVID they knew would work and help people.
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  That's mass murder.
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  And when the corporate media promotes mass shootings, all the studies show it encourages other mass shooters.
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  So who is indicted is the establishment hyping mass shootings?
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  Who is indicted is the drug companies who almost every mass shooter has been on the so-called antidepressants on their own insert admits it can cause people to go psychotic and engage in mass killing.
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  It's on the damn label.
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:41.000]  So people want to point at Alex Jones, questioning an event that the politicians jumped on, that they hyped up, that looked like a media production, is an American people's right.
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  I never harassed these families. I never sent people to harass them. They have no evidence of that.
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  They didn't kill their kids. I'm not Adam Lanza. And ambulance chasing lawyers have already gotten these people $73 million from America's oldest gun company, Remington.
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:53:04.000]  She bought that gun legally at a gun shop and it's Remington's fault that Adams Lanza's mother bought that gun. That's a fraud.
[2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:11.000]  I'm not Adam Lanza. I didn't kill those kids, but people don't know Adam Lanza's name. They know Alex Jones's name.
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  We'll take a few questions and then we're going to come back later, obviously, but I want to just say this in closing.
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  I am strongly considering tomorrow when I get put on the stand, looking at the judge and saying, you've barred me from saying I'm innocent.
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:27.000]  This isn't a real court. So I take the Fifth Amendment.
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:34.000]  Not because I'm guilty, but because she says if I tell the truth, she'll put me in the water bearing jail for six months.
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:36.000]  That's what she can do.
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:43.000]  Never before in a civil trial is the Fifth Amendment needed, but top lawyers have looked at it and say, no, she wants to put you in jail.
[2:53:43.000 --> 2:53:52.000]  If you tell the truth, while I tell this judge and all the rest of the New World Order, I am innocent and you are guilty of tyranny.
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:56.000]  And so if I go on that stand tomorrow, I'm not going to bow to what they say.
[2:53:56.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  I'm not sure if I'll even go on the stand tomorrow because it's a trap. It's a spider's web. It's a fraud.
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:06.000]  But this isn't a trial where a judge finds you guilty, won't let you put on evidence or defend yourself.
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  It's in the newspapers. When I first told the media, when this case started, when this trial started three weeks ago,
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  when I told you that she wouldn't let me put on evidence and that I can't say I'm innocent, you didn't believe me.
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:22.000]  Now she said it on the stand three times from the bench.
[2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  You have heard them say that in America, you can't say you're innocent.
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  Even if Charlie Manson was guilty, he had a right to say he was innocent.
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:36.000]  Think about that. You're being robbed of your freedoms and of due process and it's dangerous.
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  Find out what Alex Jones really stands for at infowars.com.
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:42.000]  Hear the show for yourself. Find out what you established what's so scared of.
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  Why am I a book that's number one in the world, the Great Reset and the War for the World?
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  Because that's what I really cover. That's what I really do. I make money off of films and books.
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  I never made a movie about Sandy Hook. I barely covered it. That's a lie.
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:55:00.000]  I did wrongfully say it was staged and I apologized years and years before I was sued.
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:05.000]  And they went back and they picked that up and they blew it up in the media and maybe the Sandy Hook man, I'm not.
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  Any questions?
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  The original people were professors that questioned it, former CIA operatives and others, and I believed them.
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  And they never told anybody to go harass families. A few mentally ill people did harass families.
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  I think there's some evidence of that and that's a real thing.
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  But the people that harassed some of the families who became public figures and met with Obama and went on TV,
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:40.000]  a lot of folks that are pro-gun didn't like those families being political. I understand why the families did it.
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  And so yes, nobody should harass the families. I'd not sit anybody ever to do that. They have no evidence of that.
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  But that's all they bring up constantly. Go ahead, sir.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  Americans have been lied to so much about other events that we don't believe anything anymore.
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  And that's a crisis in the government and in the media. And so I've taken responsibility for things I've done that are wrong.
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  The point is what they've represented I did, it's not what I did, and it's a fraud. You have a question?
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  Yeah, I know. It's all fake news, 50 million in Texas. It's only like 5 million.
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  There's damage caps everywhere here except on one thing. None of it matters.
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  I don't lose sleep at night about them giving them a billion dollars. I don't have two million dollars.
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  But I can't show my finances in here. I can't show them in bankruptcy. They just misrepresent how much money I have. It's a total fraud.
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  Okay, so we hear this thing. The judge found you didn't give any discovery. All you see is my discovery.
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  Up there, they're using, that's a fraud, that's a lie. They're weaponizing the judiciary.
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  Another question?
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  I'm not going to tell a lie. I've made mistakes in my life, but I'm on a liar.
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  I don't read off teleprompters. I don't give it scripts. I just tell the truth.
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  And that judge, again, admonished that I would go to jail tomorrow if I give any other answer of yes, no, or I don't know.
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  So when they get up and say, isn't it true you made money off this? No. The judge says I'll go to jail.
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  She says I did. It's a lie. She says that you didn't give us evidence.
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  I say you're guilty when we gave her all the evidence, but the evidence doesn't fit. Do you understand?
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  This is a kangaroo trial. This is a fraud. This is a danger.
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:44.000]  All right. Listen, find the truth at infowars.com.
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  Look around you. Everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions is now happening.
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  Infowars credibility. My credibility has never been higher. And it's because if you're backing of this operation,
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:07.000]  that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:12.000]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:17.000]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[2:58:17.000 --> 2:58:24.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees,
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:32.000]  and I can't fund those myself. It's unsustainable. So please visit saveinfowars.com.
[2:58:32.000 --> 2:58:38.000]  Saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, five, ten, fifty hundred dollars, whatever you can,
[2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  so that I can continue to persevere. I'll never give up. I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:48.000]  Thank you for your support. Wouldn't be without you. Saveinfowars.com.
[2:58:48.000 --> 2:58:59.000]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with a globalist. I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but the world.
[2:58:59.000 --> 2:59:06.000]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war. But I don't deserve the credit.
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:13.000]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support in info wars are the real reason you have the success.
[2:59:13.000 --> 2:59:19.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[2:59:19.000 --> 2:59:28.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:32.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[2:59:32.000 --> 2:59:42.000]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now, because we are over the target and this dream is happening.
[2:59:42.000 --> 3:00:10.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:24.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  A great being on the Alex Jones Show. What Alex Jones just said before I came on the air, everybody should listen to word for word.
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  This is very important. Listen to democracy. What democracy? We've lost our freedom.
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  How dare you not swallow my crap? I'm your governor. I'll tell you what to swallow.
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:01:05.000]  I'm little Andy Cuomo, an arrogant little boy of nothing, a daddy's boy, born on third base and thought I had a home run. Lock down your business.
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  You are not in America. You will do what you are told. You will not question me, because if we do, you'll be sensing.
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  I'll shut down your business for as long as I want to.
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:42.000]  I'll tell you what to do. I'm Gavin Newsome, gruesome Newsome. I'm little stupid de Blasio, a piece of scum crap that never worked a day in his life that's been sucking off the public.
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  You know what? And I changed my name to de Blasio. My real name is Warren William Jr.
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  But I want to get the Italian-American vote in New York to bring my mother's name, de Blasio, in there.
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  You're not allowed to speak freedom. You're not allowed to question, quote, the authorities.
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:14.000]  Little pieces of scum, authority. Who's your favorite authority?
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  What imbecile do you like the best? Hey, how about Fauci? Now, there's a guy for you. Why don't you swallow his crap? Sold you AIDS?
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  Yep, sold you to COVID war. Oh, it made millions and millions of bucks doing it.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  What Alex Jones just said is so important. Okay, he got it wrong. It's Sandy Hook.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  Not great. He's sorry he did it. What crime did he commit?
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  This is a tweet that I just sent out about 40 minutes ago before Alex got on the air, having no talk, no discussion with him at all.
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  If Alex Jones is guilty in Sandy Hook defamation lawsuit, then George W. Bush, who so lies that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, is guilty of mass murder.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  Jones killed no one. Bring Bush gang that killed millions and destroyed a rock to court or end Jones' trial.
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  Got it? End Jones' trial. Hey, how about bringing little Dick Cheney up on war crime charges?
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  Oh, I gotta be proper. I don't want to get, I don't want to get them taken off the air. I can't say Dick. I gotta be proper.
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:04:02.000]  How about this, Cheney? How about that guy, Wolfowitz? Yeah, and I didn't spell his name right. It begins with an S and got an H in there, too. Yeah.
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:10.000]  How about that little clown? How about Condoleezza Rice, the next mushroom cloud you see?
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  How about the New York slime, the toilet paper or record? That's so the lie that Saddam was saying, getting them weapons of mass destruction, got them aluminum tubes?
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:33.000]  How come they're not brought up on trial? They killed millions of people. Alex Jones didn't kill anybody.
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:43.000]  You know what it is? We're living in slave landia. It's prosecution to the fullest for we the little people of slave landia.
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:57.000]  And when the big commit the biggest crimes, they get a slap on the wrist. You better support info wars and do everything you can to do it. We're going to be right back.

[3:05:58.000 --> 3:06:18.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Gerald Salente.
[3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:33.000]  Hey, great to be on the Alex Jones show. As I said, do everything you can to support info wars. Go to infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com and get what you need and buy what you need because you're helping yourself and you're helping info wars.
[3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  I'm doing this. I don't get paid to do this job, to do this. I do it because I believe in info wars, what they're doing. And I support Alex Jones.
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:50.000]  Do I agree with everything he says? Of course not. Does he agree with everything I say? Of course not.
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:55.000]  But he hasn't censored me for saying what I'm saying.
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:07:04.000]  If I disagree with him on things about Trump, he said, look, it's free speech. You do what?
[3:07:04.000 --> 3:07:14.000]  But they censor you if you don't agree with them. Look what happened to Dr. Joseph Arcola. Look what happened to JFK Jr.
[3:07:14.000 --> 3:07:21.000]  They didn't swallow the crap about the Vax and all the other stuff and they're censored. They're taken off.
[3:07:21.000 --> 3:07:26.000]  And one article after another showing how censorship is, it's the crime syndicate.
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:35.000]  Borons and imbeciles call this place a government. It's not a government. By their deeds, you shall know them. They're a crime syndicate.
[3:07:35.000 --> 3:07:46.000]  Hey, I'm Jamie Dimon. I'm too big to fail. I talk about prosecution to the fullest. For we, the little people of slave landia,
[3:07:46.000 --> 3:07:55.000]  you have a couple of drinks and your back light over the license plate was off and they pull you over.
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:08:06.000]  Where were you? How many drinks did you have? Get out of your car. Stand on your head. Repeat the alphabet backwards.
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:15.000]  Hey, but Jamie Dimon, hey, convicted of five felonies at a JPMorgan Chase gang.
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:21.000]  Hey, we got a little fine. That's fine. But nobody goes to jail.
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:31.000]  Alex Jones didn't believe the narrative that came out of Sandy Hook and he got to go to jail and spend millions and millions of dollars.
[3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:37.000]  While the gangster banksters get a slap on the wrist, it's a crime syndicate.
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:45.000]  Little Georgie Bush, a little clown of nothing, a little boy of nothing.
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:53.000]  The Cajones is the size of a mothball. Mission accomplished. Mission accomplished.
[3:08:53.000 --> 3:09:08.000]  I lied to the American people. We killed, slaughtered a couple of millions, sometimes over a million Iraqis, destroyed the country.
[3:09:08.000 --> 3:09:21.000]  And now my daughter got a job on NBC. Yeah, that's right.
[3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  You got it. Bill Giraldi, former top CIA agent.
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  He was one of the speakers at my peace and freedom rally up here in Kingston, New York on July 23.
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:51.000]  Peace and freedom. Giraldi quit the CIA because he knew that they were lying.
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:55.000]  There were no weapons of mass destruction. And he said most of the CIA all knew it.
[3:09:55.000 --> 3:10:01.000]  That other arrogant little boy of nothing that tenant clown sold the crap.
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:06.000]  Or remember Colin Powell holding up his little colon of crap because that's what goes through the colon.
[3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  And that's what little Colin Powell was hanging up.
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  They're told in the UN. This is proof that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda.
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  Oh, Scott Ritter, another one of my speakers at the peace and freedom rally.
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:33.000]  The United Nations inspecting nuclear weapons. They don't have any nuclear weapons weapons of mass destruction going on in Iraq, he said.
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  And he was the top guy that formed a Marine.
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:41.000]  But blacklisted slaughtered out of the news.
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  But what he said, why aren't they being brought up on trial for taking us to wars based on lies that killed millions and destroyed an entire nation.
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:05.000]  So here you are, everybody listening.
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:13.000]  Let's reverse this. And let's say a guy by the name of Saddam, who's there he is, little Colin Powell.
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  A colon of crap. A colon of crap.
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:25.000]  That the people swallowed. That that was proof of weapons of mass destruction.
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:29.000]  How stupid can you be? I'll tell you how stupid.
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:34.000]  Turning the culture news network. Listen to the lemon.
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  What about the little Anderson Copa?
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:47.000]  Oh, oh, Chris Cuomo is getting a new job in another network so you could hear his crap.
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:53.000]  Why aren't they being brought up on trial?
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:56.000]  For killing all of these people.
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  Suppose now Iraq was stronger than they were and said that.
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:13.000]  George Bush has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda, and we're going to attack America.
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:16.000]  And they attack America.
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:18.000]  Your mother was killed.
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  Your brothers were killed.
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:23.000]  Your children were killed.
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  Your cities destroyed.
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:35.000]  Your country is in destruction and decimated.
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:37.000]  Oh, you would be so happy.
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:40.000]  You would be just fine with that.
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:46.000]  No, it's only OK for America to go murder people around the world.
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  Those lousy Russians.
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  Oh, who started the Vietnam or the Americans of Vietnam War?
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:56.000]  Oh, the Bush boys to Iraq was you like those, huh?
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:12:58.000]  And I'm up.
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:00.000]  So I'm the same as going to kill my daddy.
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:02.000]  That's what the jerk said.
[3:13:02.000 --> 3:13:03.000]  Yep.
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  Now, you know, you like the Afghan war.
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:13.000]  Only cost us what about numbers range around between all the wars, about six
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  billion dollars to go to the military industrial complex.
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:21.000]  Why aren't these people being brought up on charges?
[3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  Why are they being brought to court?
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:33.000]  Why is Alex Jones being brought to court?
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  The defamation charges.
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:39.000]  When they have not, he didn't kill anybody.
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  Look at all the murders that they committed.
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:45.000]  How come they're not being brought up on charges?
[3:13:45.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  Because it's America A. M. E. R. I. K. A.
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  Look at what he's saying today is 100% on trend.
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:05.000]  If we don't fight for freedom, not only are we going to lose our freedom.
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:08.000]  When I come back, we're going to talk more.
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  We're going to die in war.
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  You got the maniac in charge.
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:16.000]  That is mine. Be as Biden.
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:20.000]  Ramping up the war with Ukraine.
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:27.000]  According to antiwar.com, almost 70 billion dollars of our money has gone to Ukraine.
[3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  Hey, all you folks in Florida who have suffered that devastation of hurricane and your
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  lives, your property is ruined.
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:41.000]  We're not going to sell you a couple of pennies.
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:43.000]  We're not worth anything.
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:48.000]  We got to give the money to the military industrial complex so that we can keep killing people
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  around the world.
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  Who cares about you down in Florida?
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  Our money got to go to war for murder.
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:02.000]  Hey, maybe they're going to come after me for saying what I say.
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:07.000]  Oh, Selenti believes in peace and freedom.
[3:15:07.000 --> 3:15:10.000]  Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:13.000]  Oh, yeah, think of the Declaration of Independence.
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  Happiness?
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:17.000]  Happiness, Selenti, is a dirty word.
[3:15:17.000 --> 3:15:19.000]  You are not allowed to be happy.
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  Hey, we're politicians.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  We sucked the joy out of life just like we did with the COVID war.

[3:16:56.000 --> 3:17:01.000]  Think about a world without Info Wars.
[3:17:01.000 --> 3:17:05.000]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:07.000]  and stories we've broken together.
[3:17:07.000 --> 3:17:10.000]  This family that is Info Wars.
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:16.000]  Think about how Info Wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bal Senaro and other
[3:17:16.000 --> 3:17:23.000]  foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main
[3:17:23.000 --> 3:17:26.000]  base to defeat the New World Order.
[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:32.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[3:17:32.000 --> 3:17:36.000]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[3:17:36.000 --> 3:17:38.000]  I don't take the credit.
[3:17:38.000 --> 3:17:40.000]  I give you the credit.
[3:17:40.000 --> 3:17:43.000]  And now Info Wars is facing its darkest hours.
[3:17:43.000 --> 3:17:44.000]  It isn't going to give up.
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:47.000]  Without your support, we can be shut down.

[3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:08.000]  media.
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:09.000]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[3:18:09.000 --> 3:18:11.000]  And over the years, you have come to the table.
[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:16.000]  You have stepped to the plate so many times and kept Info Wars and free speech on the
[3:18:16.000 --> 3:18:17.000]  air.
[3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  And I thank you.
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:21.000]  But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:22.000]  Now I need your support.
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:27.000]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight

[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:48.000]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.

[3:19:01.000 --> 3:19:06.000]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and
[3:19:06.000 --> 3:19:10.600]  friends we've broken together, this family that is Info Wars.
[3:19:10.600 --> 3:19:15.740]  Think about how Info Wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and
[3:19:15.740 --> 3:19:23.200]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[3:19:23.200 --> 3:19:26.720]  main base to defeat the New World Order.
[3:19:26.720 --> 3:19:32.480]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[3:19:32.480 --> 3:19:36.960]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[3:19:36.960 --> 3:19:40.560]  I don't take the credit, I give you the credit.
[3:19:40.560 --> 3:19:44.960]  And now Info Wars is facing its darkest hours, it isn't going to give up.
[3:19:44.960 --> 3:19:46.720]  Without your support, we can be shut down.

[3:19:57.880 --> 3:20:23.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:33.000]  And now your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:20:33.000 --> 3:20:38.920]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:38.920 --> 3:20:42.800]  Now we are in very perilous times right now.
[3:20:42.800 --> 3:20:45.120]  It's censoring truth.
[3:20:45.120 --> 3:20:52.960]  You're not allowed to say facts if they don't agree with them.
[3:20:52.960 --> 3:21:02.360]  And if censoring people like Alex Jones, Dr. Joseph McCollum, RFK Jr., many others to
[3:21:02.360 --> 3:21:12.160]  speaking out and saying what those in charge don't want us to say.
[3:21:12.160 --> 3:21:14.320]  This is not my America.
[3:21:14.320 --> 3:21:17.480]  Can I tell the story?
[3:21:17.480 --> 3:21:21.360]  I own three of the most historic buildings in America.
[3:21:21.360 --> 3:21:23.560]  You could look it up.
[3:21:23.560 --> 3:21:28.720]  Most historic four corners, Kingston, New York.
[3:21:28.720 --> 3:21:33.000]  This is the third Dutch settlement.
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:41.760]  And I own the Academy, which is one of the first schools, 1774 Academy, across the street
[3:21:41.760 --> 3:21:44.840]  from it is 1763.
[3:21:44.840 --> 3:21:51.320]  Dr. Jensenhouse, across the street from that is the 1750s.
[3:21:51.320 --> 3:21:56.920]  And the other one is the museum.
[3:21:56.920 --> 3:22:02.920]  And I bought these when I came back from Berlin back in 2012.
[3:22:02.920 --> 3:22:08.120]  We were opening the Trends Journal magazine there.
[3:22:08.120 --> 3:22:12.800]  And I was looking to leave the country before then because I was disgusted with the Nobel
[3:22:12.800 --> 3:22:19.480]  piece of crap prize when a Barack Obama, what a murderer he was, quote, I'm really good
[3:22:19.480 --> 3:22:24.320]  at killing people, he's quoted in the book, double down his saying, well, his drone strike
[3:22:24.320 --> 3:22:33.400]  and what he did to Libya and Syria, and this wasn't my America.
[3:22:33.400 --> 3:22:34.400]  So I came back.
[3:22:34.400 --> 3:22:47.520]  I left to go to Germany on April 17, 2012, and I came back on April 27, 10 days later.
[3:22:47.520 --> 3:22:52.920]  And the Franz Rogenhaus, a sign went up for sale when I was away, called the real estate
[3:22:52.920 --> 3:22:59.000]  person in on April 30, it took possession of the building on June 1.
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:01.200]  Why did I buy these buildings?
[3:23:01.200 --> 3:23:03.080]  I realized they couldn't run away.
[3:23:03.080 --> 3:23:06.320]  There are two big freaks everywhere.
[3:23:06.320 --> 3:23:14.320]  When I was in Germany, they were showing me around East Berlin used to be and all over
[3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:18.920]  the world, I thought this place is gorgeous, Berlin was nice, I spent a lot of time in
[3:23:18.920 --> 3:23:30.440]  Paris, in the Repiair, and Repiair's brother, by the way, Francois, was the left shoulder
[3:23:30.440 --> 3:23:37.160]  of Jacques Chirac in Mitterrand, one of the presidents of France.
[3:23:37.160 --> 3:23:40.840]  And my close combat teacher, John Perkins, used to go out there and work out with him
[3:23:40.840 --> 3:23:41.840]  in the house.
[3:23:41.840 --> 3:23:51.560]  I mean, I've been to Paris, Berlin was grander than Paris before it was bombed out.
[3:23:51.560 --> 3:23:57.240]  I'm looking at beautiful buildings and all new construction, beautiful 1800 built, all
[3:23:57.240 --> 3:24:03.480]  new construction, everywhere I went, say, why didn't the people stop?
[3:24:03.480 --> 3:24:04.480]  Where were the people?
[3:24:04.480 --> 3:24:05.480]  You're losing.
[3:24:05.480 --> 3:24:06.480]  You're losing.
[3:24:06.480 --> 3:24:11.320]  Why didn't you stop this before you lost everything?
[3:24:11.320 --> 3:24:14.480]  But I realized when I came back, I can't run away.
[3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:19.840]  I'm only me because I'm an American.
[3:24:19.840 --> 3:24:25.000]  I was born in Alta Villea Pino, Vica Glence, over in Italy.
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:27.840]  I wouldn't be me.
[3:24:27.840 --> 3:24:30.160]  I'd be stuck in that culture.
[3:24:30.160 --> 3:24:36.640]  I was fortunate, Monopoly Tonneau born in the front, want to be free.
[3:24:36.640 --> 3:24:38.760]  That's why I bought those buildings.
[3:24:38.760 --> 3:24:46.360]  That's why I launched Occupy P. I'm fighting for the true American spirit.
[3:24:46.360 --> 3:24:52.840]  So in talking about the war and the loss of American spirit, the loss of American spirit,
[3:24:52.840 --> 3:24:56.000]  you're free to be who you want to be.
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:24:59.720]  My father may arrest him, but he should only get a fight with your father and argument.
[3:24:59.720 --> 3:25:03.120]  You say you're a little SOB, so what do you think I'm telling you what I'm telling you
[3:25:03.120 --> 3:25:05.320]  because I want you to be like me?
[3:25:05.320 --> 3:25:10.240]  I want you to become yourself.
[3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:17.440]  Any time that I repeat what everybody else was saying, you'd say to me in Italian, Papagal,
[3:25:17.440 --> 3:25:27.440]  parrot, stop repeating what everybody else is saying and think for yourself.
[3:25:27.440 --> 3:25:30.480]  They may send my father to jail for that.
[3:25:30.480 --> 3:25:31.960]  Think for yourself.
[3:25:31.960 --> 3:25:34.120]  How dare you?
[3:25:34.120 --> 3:25:39.920]  How dare you think for yourself on the government?
[3:25:39.920 --> 3:25:54.400]  And they give them names like these little people, give them these big names so they
[3:25:54.400 --> 3:26:05.680]  could be authorities over you, dignitary, yeah, dignitary.
[3:26:05.680 --> 3:26:12.480]  And when Alex Jones is going through is just an example of the bigger picture.
[3:26:12.480 --> 3:26:18.920]  As I said, Alex Jones hasn't killed anyone.
[3:26:18.920 --> 3:26:24.760]  The people didn't like to hear what he had to say, he apologizes for it.
[3:26:24.760 --> 3:26:39.400]  George W. Bush, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, little Billy Clinton, slick Willy.
[3:26:39.400 --> 3:26:42.280]  What do you like, the Yugoslav War?
[3:26:42.280 --> 3:26:48.760]  The 500,000 children that died in Iraq because of the sanctions that he put on them?
[3:26:48.760 --> 3:26:56.520]  Bring them to trial or end Alex Jones' trial.
[3:26:56.520 --> 3:27:05.160]  Bring up the murderers for their murder or leave Alex Jones alone.
[3:27:05.160 --> 3:27:08.080]  It's the bigger picture.
[3:27:08.080 --> 3:27:13.640]  And I'm talking about Germany and why the people didn't stop it before it was too late.
[3:27:13.640 --> 3:27:18.240]  The same thing is going now on in Ukraine.
[3:27:18.240 --> 3:27:24.280]  This war would have ended months ago if the United States didn't keep funneling money
[3:27:24.280 --> 3:27:25.280]  in.
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:30.080]  Again, according to antiwar.com, it's almost $70 billion.
[3:27:30.080 --> 3:27:36.080]  But again, all the people suffering in Florida for the devastation and all the other hurricanes
[3:27:36.080 --> 3:27:42.720]  that have destroyed lives and livelihoods around America, you're not worth anything.
[3:27:42.720 --> 3:27:48.200]  Only the military industrial complex and the murderers that use their weapons, they deserve
[3:27:48.200 --> 3:27:49.200]  the money.
[3:27:49.200 --> 3:27:50.200]  You don't deserve anything.
[3:27:50.200 --> 3:27:56.480]  We're sending it over there, over there, send the word, send the money over there.
[3:27:56.480 --> 3:27:58.680]  I'll buy the EBS.
[3:27:58.680 --> 3:28:00.360]  I'm real stupid.
[3:28:00.360 --> 3:28:03.600]  I listen to the Cartoon News Network.
[3:28:03.600 --> 3:28:05.000]  I listen to ABC.
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:06.320]  I listen to NBC.
[3:28:06.320 --> 3:28:07.960]  I listen to PR.
[3:28:07.960 --> 3:28:08.960]  How about FU?
[3:28:08.960 --> 3:28:09.960]  You know what?
[3:28:09.960 --> 3:28:14.160]  Because that's all it is, and that's what they're doing to us.
[3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:17.800]  When I come back, we're going to talk about the economy.
[3:28:17.800 --> 3:28:22.720]  All things are connected, like the blood which unites us all, the chief Seattle, and the
[3:28:22.720 --> 3:28:29.880]  Ukraine war, the sanctions, what's going on in the economy, the COVID war, it's all connected.
[3:28:29.880 --> 3:28:37.520]  We are heading for the worst financial and geopolitical crisis we've ever seen in modern
[3:28:37.520 --> 3:28:40.720]  history.
[3:28:40.720 --> 3:28:46.400]  We can change it, but I'll get censored for saying why.
[3:28:46.400 --> 3:28:50.360]  Peace on Earth, goodwill to all, why, how dare you?
[3:28:50.360 --> 3:28:58.080]  This is Satan Time.
[3:28:58.080 --> 3:29:02.960]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalist.
[3:29:02.960 --> 3:29:08.880]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the
[3:29:08.880 --> 3:29:09.880]  world.
[3:29:09.880 --> 3:29:15.040]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[3:29:15.040 --> 3:29:16.040]  deserve the credit.
[3:29:16.040 --> 3:29:20.840]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them for wars are the
[3:29:20.840 --> 3:29:23.520]  real reason you've had the success.
[3:29:23.520 --> 3:29:27.920]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever
[3:29:27.920 --> 3:29:28.920]  had.
[3:29:28.920 --> 3:29:35.280]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more
[3:29:35.280 --> 3:29:39.440]  important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue
[3:29:39.440 --> 3:29:42.480]  in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[3:29:42.480 --> 3:29:48.120]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[3:29:48.120 --> 3:29:52.000]  now because we are over the target and history is happening.

[3:29:56.920 --> 3:30:02.040]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the globalist documents, from their own admissions
[3:30:02.040 --> 3:30:03.040]  is now happening.
[3:30:03.040 --> 3:30:08.080]  In full wars credibility, my credibility has never been higher, and it's because of your

[3:30:14.160 --> 3:30:16.720]  the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[3:30:16.720 --> 3:30:21.560]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[3:30:21.560 --> 3:30:26.760]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[3:30:26.760 --> 3:30:30.680]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by
[3:30:30.680 --> 3:30:36.200]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.

[3:32:16.480 --> 3:32:23.960]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[3:32:23.960 --> 3:32:27.440]  main base to defeat the new World Order.
[3:32:27.440 --> 3:32:33.200]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners

[3:32:53.920 --> 3:32:57.640]  fund.

[3:33:16.040 --> 3:33:20.320]  Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Salente.
[3:33:20.320 --> 3:33:24.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:24.320 --> 3:33:33.120]  A great B90 Alex Jones show and as I said, everything you can to support it for Wars.
[3:33:33.120 --> 3:33:40.400]  The New Trends Journal comes out every week on Tuesday and we're working on finalizing
[3:33:40.400 --> 3:33:41.400]  today's.
[3:33:41.400 --> 3:33:48.960]  And you're looking at the equity market and like they're up like 600 points you know up
[3:33:48.960 --> 3:33:51.560]  big yesterday.
[3:33:51.560 --> 3:33:57.600]  And this is the beginning of what we wrote in the economic update, the global economy
[3:33:57.600 --> 3:34:01.560]  here, watch, look and listen.
[3:34:01.560 --> 3:34:07.640]  The global economy is going down the drain, it has been flushed into ruin by egotists
[3:34:07.640 --> 3:34:15.200]  called politicians, central bankers and bureaucrats that the masses look up to and obey.
[3:34:15.200 --> 3:34:20.800]  While the path of destruction of life, liberty and a pursuit of happiness has been on a long
[3:34:20.800 --> 3:34:26.920]  term downtrend, most recently it has reached new levels of runation that have not only
[3:34:26.920 --> 3:34:36.720]  sucked a joy out of life, but have now set the world on the path of mass annihilation.
[3:34:36.720 --> 3:34:39.560]  Remember all things are connected.
[3:34:39.560 --> 3:34:50.240]  And we put the cover of our February 22nd Trends Journal done by Anthony Frieda, brilliant
[3:34:50.240 --> 3:35:02.320]  artist, and it has COVID war, Ukraine war, world war, pieces forbidden.
[3:35:02.320 --> 3:35:08.680]  We mention this because we go on to say, yes, the world changed in 2020 when President's
[3:35:08.680 --> 3:35:16.200]  Prime Minister's, Chancellor's, Governor's, Mayor's, etc. launched the COVID war.
[3:35:16.200 --> 3:35:22.400]  While they did nothing to kill the coronavirus with their draconian mandate that locked
[3:35:22.400 --> 3:35:28.000]  down entire nations, their actions destroyed the lives and livelihoods of billions across
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:30.480]  the planet.
[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:37.760]  His arrogant narcissist, pathological liars made a kindergarten rules to fight the virus.
[3:35:37.760 --> 3:35:40.680]  Here are a few of them.
[3:35:40.680 --> 3:35:42.560]  Stand one meter apart.
[3:35:42.560 --> 3:35:47.000]  You go, the wind doesn't blow in circles, it doesn't go up or down.
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:51.360]  It only blows an exact straight line 60 to part.
[3:35:51.360 --> 3:35:54.640]  Remember all the stores with the circles?
[3:35:54.640 --> 3:35:58.480]  Out in front of you, right across the street, they put the farmer's mark in the parking
[3:35:58.480 --> 3:36:01.440]  lot, county building.
[3:36:01.440 --> 3:36:07.000]  And little kindergarten people that are adults, they're still in kindergarten drawing circles
[3:36:07.000 --> 3:36:10.760]  with chalk out in the sidewalk, 60 to part.
[3:36:10.760 --> 3:36:15.240]  And then in front of all the vendors, circles, 60 to part.
[3:36:15.240 --> 3:36:17.000]  You're outside, the wind blows everywhere.
[3:36:17.000 --> 3:36:18.000]  No, it doesn't.
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:22.080]  They'd yell at you if you stood outside the circle.
[3:36:22.080 --> 3:36:28.520]  Little arrogant stupid people that get power hungry when you give them a little power.
[3:36:28.520 --> 3:36:31.920]  That's the stupidity.
[3:36:31.920 --> 3:36:36.720]  Standing behind plexiglass and cash registers, you remember, the wind doesn't go around
[3:36:36.720 --> 3:36:39.320]  it, doesn't go up or over it.
[3:36:39.320 --> 3:36:43.720]  It just stays right in front of the plexiglass.
[3:36:43.720 --> 3:36:49.440]  Have arrows pointing in the direction you could walk down aisles and store.
[3:36:49.440 --> 3:36:54.040]  Yep, stupidity.
[3:36:54.040 --> 3:36:57.080]  Remember the poor little kids that they had playing instruments and little tents that
[3:36:57.080 --> 3:37:02.560]  they built from, little packages of closures?
[3:37:02.560 --> 3:37:06.960]  First people to wear masks and walking into a restaurant or sitting in an airplane but
[3:37:06.960 --> 3:37:12.800]  allowing them to take off the mask when eating and drinking, telling people to sanitize their
[3:37:12.800 --> 3:37:19.160]  hands when touching anything and not to have sex, sanitize hands or not.
[3:37:19.160 --> 3:37:20.560]  I'm not making this up.
[3:37:20.560 --> 3:37:22.560]  Yeah, there we are.
[3:37:22.560 --> 3:37:31.120]  This is out of a horror film that was created by these little dictated that people call
[3:37:31.120 --> 3:37:35.480]  their governors, their mayors, their presidents, prime ministers.
[3:37:35.480 --> 3:37:36.480]  Look at this.
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:37.480]  Look at this.
[3:37:37.480 --> 3:37:40.600]  Look at the arrogant stupidity.
[3:37:40.600 --> 3:37:41.720]  And that's what we're still in.
[3:37:41.720 --> 3:37:44.600]  We're still in school.
[3:37:44.600 --> 3:37:54.000]  Other stupid thing, locking down nations to outside citizens, imposing operation warped
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:38:00.400]  speed vaccination requirements to go to work, go to school or enter another country.
[3:38:00.400 --> 3:38:15.200]  Our leaders do what they want to do and their rules and regulations were based solely on
[3:38:15.200 --> 3:38:20.120]  political science and not a scintilla of factual science.
[3:38:20.120 --> 3:38:25.600]  And like good little boys and girls still in high school and obeying their principal,
[3:38:25.600 --> 3:38:31.120]  the masses not only did what they were told, they attacked everyone that questioned the
[3:38:31.120 --> 3:38:35.600]  mandates and the operation warped speed jab.
[3:38:35.600 --> 3:38:43.880]  Yes, the jab that the drug dealers sold and the prostitutes promoted that had 96% efficacy
[3:38:43.880 --> 3:38:47.640]  rate and just two shots would do you.
[3:38:47.640 --> 3:38:51.880]  Now of course, it's a COVID jab a year.
[3:38:51.880 --> 3:38:58.280]  And as we have detailed from the top drug head that runs Pfizer to presidents, prime
[3:38:58.280 --> 3:39:05.800]  ministers, and the clown people called celebrities, the champion, the gene therapy inoculation,
[3:39:05.800 --> 3:39:13.040]  they got two shots, boosters, got the virus and spew out the crap that they're glad they
[3:39:13.040 --> 3:39:15.000]  got all those jab.
[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:21.760]  Again, we tie this together, the socio economic and geopolitical consequences of the draconian
[3:39:21.760 --> 3:39:29.360]  COVID war mandates had made previously bad economic situation much worse.
[3:39:29.360 --> 3:39:33.600]  As we had greatly detailed in the trends journal, the global economy was under pressure long
[3:39:33.600 --> 3:39:45.880]  before the COVID war was launched by China in January 2020, the year of the rat to keep
[3:39:45.880 --> 3:39:50.560]  the obedient obedient during the closing down a society governments pumped in countless
[3:39:50.560 --> 3:39:56.760]  trillions of fake COVID cash to keep the public spending money they never earn and to keep
[3:39:56.760 --> 3:39:59.720]  them from questioning their action.
[3:39:59.720 --> 3:40:06.360]  In conclusion, inclusion, the central banksters followed suit by keeping interest rates low,
[3:40:06.360 --> 3:40:17.080]  keep the equity markets and the economy artificially pumped up while also creating a housing boom.
[3:40:17.080 --> 3:40:24.320]  A result skyrocketing inflation and a cover up for the businesses that went out of business
[3:40:24.320 --> 3:40:31.840]  and all the lives and livelihoods that the COVID war decimated the geopolitical front.
[3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:36.840]  Making a terrible socio economic situation much worse, rather than a Russian Ukraine
[3:40:36.840 --> 3:40:41.600]  settle their border differences that have been going on between the two countries for
[3:40:41.600 --> 3:40:46.760]  centuries, the United States and NATO joined Ukraine to fight the Russians.
[3:40:46.760 --> 3:40:52.280]  With the United States alone pumping nearly $70 billion to Ukraine to keep blood in the
[3:40:52.280 --> 3:40:57.240]  killing fields and NATO countries sending billions of weapons, a local war that would
[3:40:57.240 --> 3:41:03.400]  have ended months ago has now escalated into World War III with nuclear destruction on
[3:41:03.400 --> 3:41:06.840]  the near horizon.
[3:41:06.840 --> 3:41:13.880]  In addition to the Ukraine military aid the taxpayers must pay for, adding economic insult
[3:41:13.880 --> 3:41:19.360]  to injury as a result of the U.S. and NATO imposed sanctions on Russia.
[3:41:19.360 --> 3:41:25.240]  People across the globe are paying record breaking prices on food and energy, which
[3:41:25.240 --> 3:41:30.480]  equals war inflation and greater hardship.
[3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:32.880]  This just came out.
[3:41:32.880 --> 3:41:38.200]  As of August 60 percent of Americans living paycheck to paycheck according to a recent
[3:41:38.200 --> 3:41:41.000]  lending club report.
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:47.720]  And high income earners are feeling the pain of those earning more than six figures 45 percent
[3:41:47.720 --> 3:41:57.680]  reported living paycheck to paycheck, a jump from the previous year of 38.
[3:41:57.680 --> 3:42:04.920]  So you see how we tie all things together.
[3:42:04.920 --> 3:42:18.000]  We note the above to illustrate the criminality of those in charge of running dictatorships
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:21.360]  which in school they call democracy.
[3:42:21.360 --> 3:42:26.080]  As George Collins said, it's one big club and you ain't in it.
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:31.160]  As Gerald Salenti notes, me myself, not only is it one big club, it's an organized crime
[3:42:31.160 --> 3:42:36.880]  syndicate and not only are you not in it, they'll destroy your life and censor you if
[3:42:36.880 --> 3:42:44.000]  you question them and kill you if you try to stop the murders.
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:49.320]  And then we go on to the economy to see what happened to the equity markets last week, how
[3:42:49.320 --> 3:42:53.120]  things are diving into bear market and where is it going next.
[3:42:53.120 --> 3:42:56.840]  We'll be right back to tell you where it's going.
[3:42:56.840 --> 3:43:01.920]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions
[3:43:01.920 --> 3:43:05.080]  is now happening, infowars credibility.
[3:43:05.080 --> 3:43:09.520]  My credibility has never been higher and it's because of your backing of this operation
[3:43:09.520 --> 3:43:15.400]  that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits
[3:43:15.400 --> 3:43:16.400]  stay on air.
[3:43:16.400 --> 3:43:21.480]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[3:43:21.480 --> 3:43:26.680]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[3:43:26.680 --> 3:43:30.600]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by
[3:43:30.600 --> 3:43:36.120]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.

[3:44:58.640 --> 3:45:02.120]  Everything I predicted from the Globalistone documents, from their own admissions, is now
[3:45:02.120 --> 3:45:03.120]  happening.
[3:45:03.120 --> 3:45:07.200]  Infowars Credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[3:45:07.200 --> 3:45:11.440]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite
[3:45:11.440 --> 3:45:16.560]  the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[3:45:16.560 --> 3:45:21.280]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.

[3:45:26.600 --> 3:45:30.440]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced
[3:45:30.440 --> 3:45:36.040]  by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[3:45:36.040 --> 3:45:37.040]  It's unsustainable.

[3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:48.800]  And then the level that they want to take us out, do you cancer support him?
[3:49:48.800 --> 3:49:52.160]  All right.
[3:49:52.160 --> 3:49:54.840]  So I was mentioning what's going on in the equity market.
[3:49:54.840 --> 3:49:59.440]  So looking at the Dow today, it's like up, you know, over 700 points.
[3:49:59.440 --> 3:50:07.080]  And by the way, oil prices are now over $90, $91 a barrel, so happy days for inflation.
[3:50:07.080 --> 3:50:09.160]  How could the markets be going up?
[3:50:09.160 --> 3:50:17.200]  Again, you know, the stock markets posted their worst year since 2008.
[3:50:17.200 --> 3:50:19.880]  That was during a great recession last week.
[3:50:19.880 --> 3:50:24.280]  You mean they flipped around like that?
[3:50:24.280 --> 3:50:27.760]  How could that happen?
[3:50:27.760 --> 3:50:35.320]  And then it's one after another, you know, you're looking at the Dow, you're looking
[3:50:35.320 --> 3:50:45.920]  at all of these, the markets last week, the, let's see, the Dow's down over, it was down
[3:50:45.920 --> 3:50:49.360]  over 23% before yesterday and today.
[3:50:49.360 --> 3:50:54.920]  Their market is 20%, so it's in their market, but now of course, you know, with the fake
[3:50:54.920 --> 3:50:58.720]  crop up.
[3:50:58.720 --> 3:51:03.480]  And that's what it is as we see it and we'll be writing more about it in the trends journal.
[3:51:03.480 --> 3:51:09.680]  There's a thing called the plunge protection.
[3:51:09.680 --> 3:51:17.600]  They made this thing up back in the 87 crab.
[3:51:17.600 --> 3:51:24.080]  It's the Federal Reserve sitting in at the Wall Street, New York Feds, and they rigged
[3:51:24.080 --> 3:51:25.080]  the market.
[3:51:25.080 --> 3:51:31.440]  When the market goes down too low, they artificially pump it up.
[3:51:31.440 --> 3:51:37.960]  They rigged it, you know, we got an extra, but this is the president of the United States,
[3:51:37.960 --> 3:51:38.960]  my God.
[3:51:38.960 --> 3:51:47.200]  Again, it's one freak show after another, you know, I just found this.
[3:51:47.200 --> 3:52:06.320]  This is a t-shirt that I did back in 1992, beware, click, Willie, an arrogant nothing
[3:52:06.320 --> 3:52:13.040]  of a boy becomes our president.
[3:52:13.040 --> 3:52:20.080]  Every time he got caught with his pants down, bombs away, bombs away over a rock, gave us
[3:52:20.080 --> 3:52:28.360]  the Yugoslav War, Kosovo War, did away with the Glass-Steagall Act.
[3:52:28.360 --> 3:52:33.280]  I mentioned about the markets being rigged.
[3:52:33.280 --> 3:52:40.600]  The banks, the gang wasn't allowed to be in the equity market gang and they became one.
[3:52:40.600 --> 3:52:55.120]  Why do you think the Goldman Sachs pays a clown like Clinton $300,000 an hour to hear
[3:52:55.120 --> 3:53:03.720]  him BS when you can hear that arrogant little nothing of a clown BS for free?
[3:53:03.720 --> 3:53:13.720]  What do you think they get all this money from, Obama, one after another, getting all
[3:53:13.720 --> 3:53:17.240]  his dough to spew out their crap?
[3:53:17.240 --> 3:53:19.240]  They sold us out.
[3:53:19.240 --> 3:53:24.600]  They destroy this world of ours, this America.
[3:53:24.600 --> 3:53:30.600]  Bill Clinton.
[3:53:30.600 --> 3:53:33.600]  What a joke.
[3:53:33.600 --> 3:53:47.440]  Then Hillary asked on, there was CBS, how did she feel when they found out Omar Gaddafi
[3:53:47.440 --> 3:53:51.760]  was murdered, slaughtered?
[3:53:51.760 --> 3:53:56.720]  We came, we saw, he died.
[3:53:56.720 --> 3:54:00.080]  Oh yeah, that's fine.
[3:54:00.080 --> 3:54:07.960]  Hey, but Alex Jones, he didn't believe something happened and he sued for defamation when it's
[3:54:07.960 --> 3:54:22.960]  okay for Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power, Susan Rice, and all the others promoting the Libyan
[3:54:22.960 --> 3:54:29.320]  War and destroying the richest country in Africa where people had more rights and benefits
[3:54:29.320 --> 3:54:32.080]  than most of the world.
[3:54:32.080 --> 3:54:33.080]  That's fine.
[3:54:33.080 --> 3:54:38.800]  Hey, Solenti, that's only murder in the first degree.
[3:54:38.800 --> 3:54:42.520]  We got to get people that we don't like and give them anything that we can to get rid
[3:54:42.520 --> 3:54:49.800]  of them and we'll kill them if we don't like them because the crime syndicate is in shock.
[3:54:49.800 --> 3:54:55.400]  That morons in imbecile called Democrats and Republicans.
[3:54:55.400 --> 3:55:00.680]  That Solenti calls demo-craps and repulsive.
[3:55:00.680 --> 3:55:07.880]  Again, how much more of our money do they have to steal to give to the bigs who control
[3:55:07.880 --> 3:55:12.000]  us now?
[3:55:12.000 --> 3:55:19.840]  How many more wars do they have to start to kill innocent people?
[3:55:19.840 --> 3:55:23.960]  Big article about Russia, you know, blacklisting this woman that came out against the war.
[3:55:23.960 --> 3:55:30.040]  Oh, everybody forgot what they got Phil Donahue off the air on MSNBC when he came out against
[3:55:30.040 --> 3:55:31.040]  the Iraq war.
[3:55:31.040 --> 3:55:33.400]  Oh, that's fine, Solenti.
[3:55:33.400 --> 3:55:39.360]  This is America, AMERIKA, the commie fascist state of America.
[3:55:39.360 --> 3:55:40.360]  Oh, commie?
[3:55:40.360 --> 3:55:41.360]  Oh, yeah.
[3:55:41.360 --> 3:55:46.360]  Hey, here's your money back for your student loans that you spent all that money for to
[3:55:46.360 --> 3:55:53.840]  get a master's degree in gender studies or PhD in art history that I got to pay for.
[3:55:53.840 --> 3:56:04.520]  Communism, the taxes they steal from me to give to their buddies and fascists, the merger
[3:56:04.520 --> 3:56:08.600]  state and corporate power that's what Solenti called it.
[3:56:08.600 --> 3:56:10.960]  And that's the way to sending it.
[3:56:10.960 --> 3:56:18.560]  So going back to the markets, we call this in our August, I think it was the 11th Trends
[3:56:18.560 --> 3:56:23.360]  Journal, that the markets would go up in August because people were in a vacation state of
[3:56:23.360 --> 3:56:27.040]  mind and didn't see the manipulation.
[3:56:27.040 --> 3:56:29.800]  But back in September, when they come back to the real life, you're going to see the
[3:56:29.800 --> 3:56:32.640]  markets collapse and they did.
[3:56:32.640 --> 3:56:40.120]  It's all in your Trends Journal history before it happens, TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com,
[3:56:40.120 --> 3:56:43.080]  the grand total of $2 a week.
[3:56:43.080 --> 3:56:44.080]  It's going to change.
[3:56:44.080 --> 3:56:45.080]  It's going to go up.
[3:56:45.080 --> 3:56:46.080]  So you better get it now.
[3:56:46.080 --> 3:56:52.560]  The toilet paper record cost $3 a day and I get nothing from it, but I got to read it
[3:56:52.560 --> 3:56:57.040]  to see the propaganda putting out.
[3:56:57.040 --> 3:57:07.160]  We read everything around the world, from Israel to Iran, from the Arab news, what's
[3:57:07.160 --> 3:57:10.880]  going on in Japan, South America and around the world.
[3:57:10.880 --> 3:57:14.640]  We give you all we can to give you the best we can.
[3:57:14.640 --> 3:57:19.440]  No magazine like it in the world, it's TrendsJournal, TrendsJournal.com.
[3:57:19.440 --> 3:57:25.400]  So again, they're probably going to censor me at some point as well because they don't
[3:57:25.400 --> 3:57:26.840]  like what I have to say.
[3:57:26.840 --> 3:57:33.840]  This used to be very popular at one time in one of the articles of the Wall Street Journal.
[3:57:33.840 --> 3:57:40.040]  Those who take their predictions seriously consider the Trends Research Institute.
[3:57:40.040 --> 3:58:07.880]  Mr. Salenti tracks the world's social, economic and business trends.
[3:58:07.880 --> 3:58:12.560]  I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them and I need
[3:58:12.560 --> 3:58:13.560]  your support.
[3:58:13.560 --> 3:58:18.000]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight
