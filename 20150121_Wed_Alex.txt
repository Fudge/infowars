[08:33.640 --> 08:49.560]  resistance you're listening to alex jones

[08:54.240 --> 09:00.640]  intel on the 9-11 missing pages that they're trying to fair it out with a new
[09:00.640 --> 09:07.840]  law massive intel on moves to begin impeachment of iraq is saying Obama
[09:07.840 --> 09:12.240]  will get his take on the state of the union the congressman from north
[09:12.240 --> 09:16.800]  carolina will be joining us today I want to do an in-depth report the bottom of
[09:16.800 --> 09:20.880]  the hour on just how deadly this flu vaccine is and how it doesn't protect
[09:20.880 --> 09:24.120]  the public because anthony good she already was in studio but got cut short
[09:24.120 --> 09:29.360]  to about 10 minutes I wanted to present that full analysis at the bottom of this
[09:29.360 --> 09:34.440]  hour I want to open the phones up to get your take on the so-called state of the
[09:34.440 --> 09:40.480]  union I think the big vote here is no confidence in the system record low
[09:40.480 --> 09:46.120]  numbers nielson is reporting for the state of the union so people just aren't
[09:46.120 --> 09:51.000]  tuning in to hear the bull but then they take the statements and then pepper them
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.640]  throughout newscast and newspapers everywhere and bombard the public with
[09:55.640 --> 09:59.800]  the lies that you're going to get free tuition just like you get free high
[09:59.800 --> 10:06.760]  school the first 12 grades primary school is not free and is one of the
[10:06.760 --> 10:10.640]  biggest moon doggles out there that's what property taxes and all these other
[10:10.640 --> 10:17.480]  systems are that turn landowners homeowners into renters
[10:17.480 --> 10:23.000]  so Jimmy just explained something public school is not free and it's been
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.280]  government money we had one of the best education systems in the world this is
[10:27.280 --> 10:32.480]  on record anybody can look it up it was undisputed until about the 60s we had the
[10:32.480 --> 10:38.520]  best health care system in the world undisputed until the 70s British Dutch
[10:38.520 --> 10:44.680]  Japanese royalty the Emperor of Japan the Queen of England the Queen of the
[10:44.680 --> 10:51.360]  Netherlands Prince Barnhard when they would come here they would get their
[10:51.360 --> 10:56.960]  surgeries and their medical care done in Houston Texas in New York New York in
[10:56.960 --> 11:02.120]  Washington DC in Los Angeles California not in their countries now they get
[11:02.120 --> 11:08.520]  their health care in Switzerland or in Germany because they've got straight up
[11:08.520 --> 11:13.760]  socialist health care for poor people you pay massive amounts of taxes but then
[11:13.760 --> 11:17.480]  they've got second-tier health care for people that are rich that's very high
[11:17.480 --> 11:22.280]  quality they're getting rid of that here basically this is a giant galactic
[11:22.280 --> 11:27.080]  screwjob and his state of the Union just made my head spin I kind of want to
[11:27.080 --> 11:29.960]  invite David Knight though he's not here yet because he was up until 11 last
[11:29.960 --> 11:34.400]  night in it to give me his take on the state of the Union and to go over all
[11:34.400 --> 11:39.720]  the different lines the carbon taxes the the racial division pushing just all of
[11:39.720 --> 11:48.360]  it I ended up just sitting back and watching them do a great job last night
[11:48.360 --> 11:54.360]  was first rate three hours of live coverage I of course shot the anonymous
[11:54.360 --> 11:58.400]  novelty piece as anybody can say they're anonymous and we do represent and
[11:58.400 --> 12:02.720]  speak for a lot of white hat hackers that are standing up against tyranny who
[12:02.720 --> 12:06.480]  routinely come on the show some of them public some of them not public some of
[12:06.480 --> 12:12.160]  them the first hacker captain crunch and others so yes we were not trying to
[12:12.160 --> 12:17.480]  deceive anyone it's obviously me and the guy Fox mask doing the anonymous piece
[12:17.480 --> 12:26.680]  and I will be making announcements in the person of anonymous I was thinking
[12:26.680 --> 12:32.560]  about a contest we could have for the best anonymous message where you dress
[12:32.560 --> 12:37.520]  up you do an anonymous piece on the street or at a theater or in front of a
[12:37.520 --> 12:42.400]  television set you know sitting there at a chair however you want to do it for
[12:42.400 --> 12:47.800]  the best anonymous message to point out you are anonymous you are the people an
[12:47.800 --> 12:52.840]  anonymous activism is one of the most powerful forms out there but my
[12:52.840 --> 13:00.720]  anonymous piece is up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com first off
[13:00.720 --> 13:06.120]  Obama called for civility than immediately taunts Republicans most
[13:06.120 --> 13:09.560]  divisive president in history says the Washington Times I agree with that
[13:09.560 --> 13:14.280]  statement that was his job was to bulk and eyes the people so the foreign
[13:14.280 --> 13:17.720]  offshore banks could loot the nation while we were busy fighting with each
[13:17.720 --> 13:23.800]  other why do you think George Soros has funded 33 million dollars to stir up
[13:23.800 --> 13:29.040]  racial animus and to make revolution about throwing mall off cocktails at the
[13:29.040 --> 13:36.400]  police because if we descend into anarchy before reforming the system as
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.520]  Ron Paul and others have said this will give the collectivist a leg up to bring
[13:40.520 --> 13:49.600]  in total control to the crisis that they let the fuse on very simple equation do
[13:49.600 --> 13:56.640]  we endorse the police state no did we pioneer exposing it yes do we dance to
[13:56.640 --> 14:01.880]  George Soros and the Justice Department's weaponized cultural tune of
[14:01.880 --> 14:11.280]  hating groups of people and getting in mindless fights with them no we are
[14:11.280 --> 14:17.240]  outside the paradigm studying enemy operations and showing the public the
[14:17.240 --> 14:22.640]  hat trick and that includes the police not just the public and the police are
[14:22.640 --> 14:28.480]  extremely receptive why would the American people want to be manipulated
[14:28.480 --> 14:34.040]  into a culture war and a physical war with local government when local
[14:34.040 --> 14:38.680]  government represents us and we should take it back over peacefully from the
[14:38.680 --> 14:45.160]  globalist they can't stop us if we move against them with ideas their bullet
[14:45.160 --> 14:52.160]  proof to quote V who basically paraphrases Victor Hugo no army can stop an
[14:52.160 --> 14:58.240]  idea whose time has come no army as I've said a thousand times I'll say it
[14:58.240 --> 15:04.800]  again most violent revolutions fail or create something worse fact almost all
[15:04.800 --> 15:13.200]  of them most of the American Revolution in 1776 was not physical three percent
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.480]  started it five percent wanted against an empire who'd never been defeated we
[15:17.480 --> 15:21.240]  lost almost every battle that we won the hearts and minds in the end and the
[15:21.240 --> 15:27.640]  king of England had to sue for peace it was a culture war but they wouldn't let
[15:27.640 --> 15:33.640]  the patriots deliver the newspapers the Federalist papers the committees of
[15:33.640 --> 15:39.640]  correspondence and so it had to be defended by arms seven years of
[15:39.640 --> 15:45.120]  perseverance in the face of an empire that defeated the French the Spanish the
[15:45.120 --> 15:52.240]  Portuguese the Austrians the Dutch the Russians and everyone else we defeated it
[15:52.240 --> 16:01.200]  because we had superior ideas and we have superior ideas right now we got a
[16:01.200 --> 16:09.360]  handful of aces all four of them nobody can beat that hand but you got to play
[16:09.360 --> 16:14.320]  the hand you got to know you have the hand the enemy knows we have the hand
[16:14.320 --> 16:19.440]  and they are you know what bricks because they know the light of liberty
[16:19.440 --> 16:25.760]  that burns in our hearts and our minds is infectious let's start getting into the
[16:25.760 --> 16:30.840]  state of the Union before I get into all the other news Obama Community College
[16:30.840 --> 16:35.960]  should be free we'll get to that and he's speaking to young people that play on
[16:35.960 --> 16:38.520]  their iPads all day and everything's paid for by mommy and daddy that have no
[16:38.520 --> 16:41.720]  idea they have no future they want to suck on a man just like they put all the
[16:41.720 --> 16:45.480]  federal money into education driving up the price of it when you put free money
[16:45.480 --> 16:51.840]  into it it's not free it inflates the cost and there's not even an economy or
[16:51.840 --> 16:55.840]  an industry for 90 plus percent of those jobs I was telling you that 20 years
[16:55.840 --> 17:02.240]  ago Rush Lomba was telling you that 30 years ago it's just a fact and I'm not
[17:02.240 --> 17:07.920]  poo-pooing if you have a college degree great the point is good luck building a
[17:07.920 --> 17:12.080]  world building a life with most those degrees yeah a lot agree have your good
[17:12.080 --> 17:16.880]  lawyer yeah doctor you need it yeah mathematician engineer you only need the
[17:16.880 --> 17:21.120]  degrees to get into those societies those organizations but past those you're
[17:21.120 --> 17:27.440]  not getting a job criminal justice yeah I guess that's gonna get bigger but it
[17:27.440 --> 17:30.600]  doesn't matter the society itself is falling apart but the first clip is
[17:30.600 --> 17:36.400]  Obama taunting Republicans then we'll come back and get to Obama and his
[17:36.400 --> 17:41.960]  community college statement and then John bound at a short boil down on who
[17:41.960 --> 17:46.080]  really wins as America loses the millionaires club people that have made
[17:46.080 --> 17:49.800]  hundreds of millions of dollars since joining Congress they're almost all
[17:49.800 --> 17:54.200]  Democrats just I'm not saying the Republicans are wonderful they're part
[17:54.200 --> 17:58.840]  of the same system the point is the Democrats are the leaders of the pack
[17:58.840 --> 18:05.480]  who sung that 50 song the leader of the pack they're in there they run the show
[18:05.480 --> 18:09.280]  and they're making major bank and they're exempt from everything they put on
[18:09.280 --> 18:15.920]  us insider trading Obamacare I mean this is galactic level hypocrisy in our
[18:15.920 --> 18:26.320]  face let's go to Obama taunting I have no more campaigns to run my only agenda
[18:26.320 --> 18:36.720]  I know because I won both of them yeah you've really done America down and ran
[18:36.720 --> 18:45.600]  against strongman yeah oh you're a winner yeah you're a real winner obama
[18:47.720 --> 18:53.560]  isn't that funny it's all comedy central now my only agenda for the next two
[18:53.560 --> 18:58.440]  years is the same as the one I've had since the day I swore an oath on the
[18:58.440 --> 19:01.160]  step yeah that's increased the middle class that you've cut in half to do what
[19:01.160 --> 19:08.680]  I believe is best for America oh you care about us I'm gonna throw up I use
[19:08.680 --> 19:13.840]  that term too much I'm gonna throw up but I and then Boehner is back there I
[19:13.840 --> 19:16.440]  not predicted it wasn't hard to predict that he was suddenly struck in these
[19:16.440 --> 19:21.400]  hardcore anti-Obama speeches because everybody knows he's a total fake and
[19:21.400 --> 19:25.120]  he's hanging on by his fingernails so he's back there staring at Obama that
[19:25.120 --> 19:28.600]  he plays golf with and drinks with and smoke cigarettes with and does other
[19:28.600 --> 19:35.520]  things with I'll guarantee you those two are a piece of work and in the secret
[19:35.520 --> 19:41.080]  service words about Obama you wouldn't believe it Alex that's Bongino on air
[19:41.080 --> 19:44.000]  but I've been told by other Secret Service they just said you wouldn't
[19:44.000 --> 19:51.200]  believe it no I believe it we know what we're dealing with here deviance that
[19:51.200 --> 19:57.080]  want to screw over society they get off on breaking the country they hate us they
[19:57.080 --> 20:03.760]  want to dominate us what's the best way to keep secrets for somebody well you
[20:03.760 --> 20:07.040]  give them something that they want so bad that they don't care what you're
[20:07.040 --> 20:12.240]  hiding the year is 2007 and 20% of the state of California is employed in real
[20:12.240 --> 20:17.120]  estate we live in a capitalistic nation of Kings and pray upon the greed of the

[24:14.920 --> 24:20.320]  few minutes it's two minutes of John Boehner's disgusting micro expressions
[24:20.320 --> 24:25.600]  during the State of the Union where he was sitting behind Obama looking like
[24:25.600 --> 24:31.000]  he was passing gallbladder stones and it's all part of an act that he doesn't
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.520]  like Obama when he's the one that won't repeal Obamacare that's illegal that's a
[24:37.520 --> 24:43.480]  fraud that's a giant scam that we were lied to on every front now the IRS says
[24:43.480 --> 24:48.480]  they will garnish wages and grab bank accounts and hold back tax refunds but
[24:48.480 --> 24:52.120]  won't give you advice when you call him about how to comply with Obamacare
[24:52.120 --> 24:58.840]  isn't that Kafkaesque that's the book of the trial where he's in a trial not
[24:58.840 --> 25:02.960]  knowing what he's even accused of that's what totalitarianism is where you
[25:02.960 --> 25:07.160]  can't even comply because they won't even tell you what the unconstitutional
[25:07.160 --> 25:15.560]  regulations are what the policies are well here is Obama saying he will veto
[25:15.560 --> 25:22.520]  well not if there's a big majority he can't you can get that past him Obama
[25:22.520 --> 25:29.840]  basically saying that he will veto anything that tries to repeal the
[25:29.840 --> 25:34.400]  screwjob act known as Obamacare here it is we can't put the security of families
[25:34.400 --> 25:39.200]  at risk by taking away their health insurance or unraveling the new rules on
[25:39.200 --> 25:44.640]  Wall Street or refighting past battles on immigration when we've got to fix a
[25:44.640 --> 25:50.280]  broken system and if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these
[25:50.280 --> 25:57.080]  things I will veto it that as you hear that on the immigration issue no law
[25:57.080 --> 26:01.320]  has been passed the laws say you can't have open borders or legalized
[26:01.320 --> 26:05.120]  illegals by fiat you don't even sign an executive order it specifically with
[26:05.120 --> 26:09.360]  that you just ordered the border patrol to give them vouchers and complete the
[26:09.360 --> 26:14.440]  quote smuggling process to quote the border patrol so if Congress has a
[26:14.440 --> 26:19.520]  pass another law blocking you you'll veto that I mean you're seeing total
[26:19.520 --> 26:27.760]  lawlessness in everyone's face Boehner clearly has been blackmailed if you think
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.640]  our economy shut down under Obamacare starting to phase in imagine when the
[26:32.640 --> 26:37.080]  carbon taxes hit that are already hit in California by fiat which he also talked
[26:37.080 --> 26:43.360]  about let's go to this next clip this is Obama on how community college should
[26:43.360 --> 26:50.280]  be as quote free and universal in America as high school primary education
[26:50.280 --> 26:56.320]  cost about 10% of our GDP if you look it up health care is another seventh
[26:56.320 --> 27:00.240]  that's doubling so that'll be basically one-fifth I mean they're just taking the
[27:00.240 --> 27:04.000]  economy over and then special interest administer it and siphon off the tax
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.800]  money that's why big corporations are behind Obamacare that's why they're
[27:08.800 --> 27:13.320]  behind all these regulations to shut down small companies this is a takeover
[27:13.320 --> 27:18.320]  and that's why they got bipartisan support to keep Obamacare in place
[27:18.320 --> 27:24.680]  because 47% increase in profits in one year for global insurance companies just
[27:24.680 --> 27:28.960]  on the American people's backs it's set to go up that much this year you're
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.440]  talking almost a 100% increase in profits
[27:35.280 --> 27:41.040]  oh I'm sorry it's sick let's go to this clip by the end of this decade two in
[27:41.040 --> 27:47.160]  three job openings will require some higher education two and three and yet
[27:47.160 --> 27:51.000]  we still live in a country where too many bright striving Americans are priced
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.240]  out of the education they need it's total horse crap it's not fair to them and
[27:56.240 --> 28:01.080]  sure not smart for our future oh no that's why I'm sending this Congress a
[28:01.080 --> 28:11.920]  bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero that's your
[28:11.920 --> 28:15.600]  debt I mean you shine on to a debt package another screw job from the
[28:15.600 --> 28:21.200]  gangster people love being games they love being pimped keep in mind 40% of
[28:21.200 --> 28:27.240]  our college students choose community college some are young and starting out
[28:27.240 --> 28:33.480]  some are older and looking for a better job some are veterans and single parents
[28:33.480 --> 28:36.800]  trying to transition back into the job veterans it gets paid for all of them
[28:36.800 --> 28:42.080]  whoever you are more lies this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the
[28:42.080 --> 28:47.280]  new economy without a loaded debt the new economy understand you've got to earn
[28:47.280 --> 28:55.080]  it you got to keep your grades up and graduate on time Tennessee a state with

[36:45.000 --> 36:49.400]  vorice rich people that will want to live in nice neighborhoods and want to
[36:49.400 --> 36:53.560]  plant big trees and want to build institutions and museums and libraries
[36:53.560 --> 36:59.360]  good old-fashioned rich people that built this country with their ideas most
[36:59.360 --> 37:03.200]  of them came from nowhere every study where real rich people come from they
[37:03.200 --> 37:07.440]  come from the grassroots innovators some from blue collar some from white
[37:07.440 --> 37:15.400]  collar some from farmers some the sons of lawyers or daughters of sea captains you
[37:15.400 --> 37:21.880]  make a billion bucks coming out with a book more power to you but when you make
[37:21.880 --> 37:26.520]  your money off government contracts and insider deals and insider trading like

[37:30.480 --> 37:34.840]  insurance stocks going up you're a criminal I don't care if Congress six
[37:34.840 --> 37:40.000]  years ago got caught and then passed a law it'd be like if they caught the
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.280]  Texas legislature collectively kidnapping children and barbecuing them
[37:45.280 --> 37:48.040]  hypothetically not saying that's happening hypothetically something
[37:48.040 --> 37:52.880]  extreme or let's say they caught the legislature in a bipartisan fashion
[37:52.880 --> 37:58.040]  dealing methamphetamine and then the legislature got together and passed a
[37:58.040 --> 38:02.760]  law saying it's legal for us to deal methamphetamine it's it's hypocrisy it
[38:02.760 --> 38:08.400]  isn't legal when the president does it like millhouse nixon said Richard M.
[38:08.400 --> 38:20.920]  Nixon it's a load of horse pucky or as we say in Texas of prunes so let's go to
[38:20.920 --> 38:24.520]  John Bowne's brief report here it is
[38:24.520 --> 38:32.560]  it's on info wars.com get it out to everybody with the documents we have to
[38:32.560 --> 38:38.200]  pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it the average member of
[38:38.200 --> 38:42.520]  Congress is worth 18 times the average American household according to the
[38:42.520 --> 38:47.360]  Center for Responsive Politics the average net worth of a lawmaker is one
[38:47.360 --> 38:53.480]  million twenty nine thousand five hundred and five dollars in 2013 a two point five
[38:53.480 --> 38:58.840]  percent increase from 2012 whereas the average Americans household is worth
[38:58.840 --> 39:04.800]  fifty six thousand three hundred and fifty five dollars not only that but
[39:04.800 --> 39:10.640]  fifty point eight percent of Congress are millionaires while the media net worth
[39:10.640 --> 39:15.280]  of an American family has declined by nearly one third between two thousand
[39:15.280 --> 39:20.840]  seven in 2013 members of Congress have recovered quite well from the recession
[39:20.840 --> 39:25.800]  the Senate's media net worth went from two point three million to two point eight
[39:25.800 --> 39:30.040]  million over that period while for members of the house the numbers went
[39:30.040 --> 39:34.520]  from seven hundred and eight thousand five hundred to eight hundred and forty
[39:34.520 --> 39:40.600]  three thousand five hundred and seven overall CRP's annual analysis of lawmakers
[39:40.600 --> 39:45.160]  financial statements once again shows that they are not remotely similar to the
[39:45.160 --> 39:50.080]  typical American in terms of wealth investments and economic security
[39:50.080 --> 39:55.000]  whether voters elect them because they are successful or because people of
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.720]  modest means do not run or for other reasons is unclear but struggling
[40:00.720 --> 40:05.080]  Americans should not assume that their elected officials understand their
[40:05.080 --> 40:13.480]  circumstances making sure that these kids have a shot at the American dream
[40:13.480 --> 40:18.800]  man is mentally ill it's important
[40:21.480 --> 40:26.040]  okay and let's see in fact I want bound to do a larger analysis off the numbers
[40:26.040 --> 40:28.720]  because I've just seen the wealth numbers over the years and know it to be a
[40:28.720 --> 40:31.240]  fact plus I have the list here that's almost all Democrats that are worth
[40:31.240 --> 40:38.120]  hundreds of millions the only reason that the general Congress is only worth a
[40:38.120 --> 40:43.280]  couple million each on average is because the Republicans who are there who
[40:43.280 --> 40:46.520]  are grassroots tea party people usually have a couple hundred thousand dollars
[40:46.520 --> 40:50.720]  in the bank so they're averaging that low number of the Democrats with hundreds
[40:50.720 --> 41:00.080]  of millions I mean you look at Harry Reid pretty much his entire family is
[41:00.080 --> 41:05.280]  given giant no-bed contracts it's like the vice president's son was given
[41:05.280 --> 41:13.040]  control over the largest gas company that was state run a few months ago
[41:13.040 --> 41:19.720]  in Ukraine and just his position in the company was estimated and reports we
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.640]  covered her on air at four billion dollars he just got out of college two
[41:23.640 --> 41:32.560]  years ago you get out of college and you're worth four billion he's on the
[41:32.560 --> 41:37.000]  board he's got a position in the company now estimated at four billion
[41:37.000 --> 41:44.920]  dollars he looks like a possum that got caught eating on a dead cow or something
[41:44.920 --> 41:49.920]  I'm sorry just look at that demon these people are hardcore mafias laughing at
[41:49.920 --> 41:53.400]  you and your family telling you you're gonna get free healthcare and free this
[41:53.400 --> 42:00.360]  and that it's all a load of pure lies now I'm gonna get more into the state of
[42:00.360 --> 42:03.960]  the Union to play a bunch of clips at the bottom of the next hour I'm going to
[42:03.960 --> 42:08.280]  open the phones up in the first half of the next hour to get your take on the
[42:08.280 --> 42:12.720]  state of the Union because just because almost no one watched it we still have
[42:12.720 --> 42:16.680]  to decipher it break it down and show the lies we're gonna be doing more of
[42:16.680 --> 42:20.080]  that on the nightly news tonight as well with the numbers themselves side by
[42:20.080 --> 42:27.440]  side also coming up Edward Stoden says iPhones are loaded with secret spyware
[42:27.440 --> 42:33.920]  he also said that birds live in nests did you know that he said that water was
[42:33.920 --> 42:41.280]  wet and that cows are they'll move and and the mommies have milk Wow thank you
[42:41.280 --> 42:45.360]  Snowden I mean this has been known forever it's in the telecommunications
[42:45.360 --> 42:48.640]  act of 96 that all this would be put into the phones it's a computer that
[42:48.640 --> 42:51.600]  watches everything you do tracks everything including your heart rate
[42:51.600 --> 42:54.800]  oh yeah even if you don't turn the apps on it's tracking your heart rate
[42:54.800 --> 42:59.720]  everything you're doing it is a government spy robot that you pay to
[42:59.720 --> 43:05.000]  attach to yourself I'm just being honest with everybody I mean just just know
[43:05.000 --> 43:12.040]  but oh my gosh oh oh oh it turns out the FBI is running spy fake cell towers
[43:12.040 --> 43:14.640]  stealing data just a year ago they said it didn't exist and call people
[43:14.640 --> 43:19.840]  conspiracy theorist because that's what you do to an enemy you give an enemy
[43:19.840 --> 43:25.440]  disinfo you teach them two plus two equals five you get on the air and say
[43:25.440 --> 43:29.800]  I'm not a communist I'm Bill Ayers what's that red star on your website a lot
[43:29.800 --> 43:35.160]  of people have red stars Alex and weak-minded people on YouTube it's a
[43:35.160 --> 43:40.120]  small number but a large minority think I lost the debate because Bill Ayers
[43:40.120 --> 43:44.960]  ball-faced shoveled baloney at people we're going to take that interview and
[43:44.960 --> 43:50.400]  take everything he said and then show him to be deceptive that interview
[43:50.400 --> 43:58.920]  yesterday was phase one you'll see how we skin cats around here these things
[43:58.920 --> 44:05.960]  must be done delicately to quote the wicked witch of the east from the
[44:05.960 --> 44:13.440]  yellow brick road saga the Wizard of Oz now we're gonna get into that as well
[44:13.440 --> 44:19.880]  today we're also going to break down the really important news but I do have an
[44:19.880 --> 44:26.960]  angle on this the NFL has found that there were bad balls and we're talking
[44:26.960 --> 44:29.880]  about the not about Bainer not having the will to stand up for America and
[44:29.880 --> 44:37.240]  having no no inflatables we're talking about the New England Patriots who are
[44:37.240 --> 44:44.880]  famous for cheating but that's just because they've been caught the refs
[44:44.880 --> 44:51.240]  checked the balls and so they must have been complicit I mean I'm sorry but this
[44:51.240 --> 44:55.200]  isn't something that matters see this shouldn't be the big story but but it
[44:55.200 --> 45:00.360]  is so well don't worry we'll we'll carry it for you and cover if I give a big
[45:00.360 --> 45:03.920]  angle coming out in the next hour that kid Daniels is working on the real
[45:03.920 --> 45:10.200]  evidence is that the refs are cheating on key plays for the mafia and that's in
[45:10.200 --> 45:14.320]  FBI files but those investigations got killed we're gonna post the video proof
[45:14.320 --> 45:19.040]  of that at info wars.com the next hour now
[45:19.640 --> 45:28.040]  shifting to Anthony Gucci arty and he's here in studio with us right now to
[45:28.040 --> 45:32.400]  break down the latest flu news and the fact that they admit the flu vaccine is
[45:32.400 --> 45:36.360]  not helping anybody but their answer is as we played a clip of inertia today get
[45:36.360 --> 45:41.160]  more shots so we're gonna be breaking that down right now and will you guys
[45:41.160 --> 45:45.720]  bring me a couple bottles of ancient defense in here I need to take some out
[45:45.720 --> 45:49.520]  of the other studio Anthony Gucci already break this down for us so what's
[45:49.520 --> 45:53.880]  really interesting is I've never heard anyone talk about this before ever and
[45:53.880 --> 45:57.720]  we talked about it on air when the Ebola crisis was going on a written
[45:57.720 --> 46:01.560]  article about it something called mannose binding lectins and I think this
[46:01.560 --> 46:06.120]  solves the entire answer to how do we defend against virtually all viruses
[46:06.120 --> 46:10.800]  you know cold flu and also it serves to answer the question what is immunity and
[46:10.800 --> 46:14.880]  how do we know if we're actually immune to these diseases and ultimately what
[46:14.880 --> 46:19.320]  it comes down to is you have the ability inherently genetically to produce
[46:19.320 --> 46:24.160]  something called mannose binding lectins and these these things basically go
[46:24.160 --> 46:28.400]  ahead and attack the cell walls of viruses and if the cell walls destroyed
[46:28.400 --> 46:31.600]  they then obviously your body your immune system which is creating these
[46:31.600 --> 46:35.040]  things can destroy the virus and we're gonna skip this network break because I
[46:35.040 --> 46:38.640]  got you in here late but isn't it discriminatory against viruses to take
[46:38.640 --> 46:42.800]  them out it's absolutely very racist against viruses you should probably just
[46:42.800 --> 46:46.320]  let them destroy you and use you as a host body to spread and ruin humanity
[46:46.320 --> 46:51.080]  well I suggest just take 20 of the flu shots if they if they don't protect me
[46:51.080 --> 46:54.520]  and only lower my immunity in the studies shouldn't I do what the nurse said
[46:54.520 --> 46:57.800]  well I've got good news if you eat regular food and you take your vaccines
[46:57.800 --> 47:01.320]  you're not producing any of these mannose binding lectins so what happens is
[47:01.320 --> 47:03.640]  you're going to get sick and you're going to die you're going to do your
[47:03.640 --> 47:07.880]  purpose you're going to let the virus thrive in your body and wipe out everyone
[47:07.880 --> 47:11.320]  because David Rockefeller said there's too many of us so yeah okay I get the
[47:11.320 --> 47:15.560]  population well what it comes down to and by the way all of this is on
[47:15.560 --> 47:18.840]  government websites and that's what's so interesting to me this is from the US
[47:18.840 --> 47:21.680]  National Library of Medicine which we always reference because you know it's
[47:21.680 --> 47:24.520]  actually from Congress it's considered the best the gold standard you know
[47:24.520 --> 47:28.120]  Harvard worships it and here they say what is a mannose binding lectin
[47:28.120 --> 47:32.000]  deficiency mannose binding lectin deficiency is a condition that affects
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.960]  the immune system people with this condition have low levels of immune
[47:34.960 --> 47:38.440]  system protein called mannose binding lectin in their blood there these
[47:38.440 --> 47:41.680]  individuals are prone to recurrent infections including infections of
[47:41.680 --> 47:45.520]  upper respiratory tract other body systems they go on to say and in various
[47:45.520 --> 47:49.200]  other things we're going to get to that you will be more likely to contract and
[47:49.200 --> 47:53.160]  die of pneumonia you will get the flu and potentially die from it virtually
[47:53.160 --> 47:57.400]  every single disease the cold if you have a lack of mannose binding lectins you
[47:57.400 --> 48:00.360]  will have the common cold you will get the flu you'll get pneumonia and if you
[48:00.360 --> 48:04.200]  have a severe deficiency you will die of those conditions also they found that
[48:04.200 --> 48:07.720]  rats that are given extra doses of these actually are immune to a ball of
[48:07.720 --> 48:11.320]  completely so this is how powerful this is you have all those studies will show
[48:11.320 --> 48:16.600]  them to TV viewers and list them here on air and and and so they're saying take
[48:16.600 --> 48:19.800]  more flu shots if that queue up that nurse if you can even though it doesn't
[48:19.800 --> 48:23.400]  protect you but then they won't tell the public what's in the government's own
[48:23.400 --> 48:27.920]  PubMed studies about herbs and things that are known that actually have these
[48:27.920 --> 48:32.040]  in them well here's the crazy thing so you can't just take a supplement of
[48:32.040 --> 48:35.880]  mannose binding lectins right you have to activate them in your own genetic code
[48:35.880 --> 48:39.960]  for for millions of thousands or whatever years you believe we have had
[48:39.960 --> 48:45.040]  these autoimmune boosting attack formations in our body this mannose
[48:45.040 --> 48:48.360]  binding lectins and that's how we've survived we've had the racist yes we've
[48:48.360 --> 48:51.520]  had the racist genes that promote these and then scientists are freaking out
[48:51.520 --> 48:54.840]  saying why are we getting sick so much and they found it's because our gene
[48:54.840 --> 48:57.880]  systems that produce these mannose binding lectins are being turned off and
[48:57.880 --> 49:01.920]  they say we have no idea why right they say it's definitely environmental as in
[49:01.920 --> 49:05.800]  something from the air or the food or the water but they don't know what we'll
[49:05.800 --> 49:10.600]  check it out it's because our genes are being shut down and they say well you
[49:10.600 --> 49:14.560]  know what's damaging our genes how about virtually everything but mainly
[49:14.560 --> 49:18.080]  Monsanto's Roundup which is an everything we eat in pesticides and
[49:18.080 --> 49:21.520]  here's a very recent study you're not joining Chuck Norris warning people
[49:21.520 --> 49:25.320]  about Roundup are you oh I know and virtually extreme 53 million people
[49:25.320 --> 49:28.640]  that signed a petition to fight against Monsanto as well pretty recently too
[49:28.640 --> 49:32.960]  well they're obviously extremists as well obvious extremists genetic damage
[49:32.960 --> 49:36.400]  and soybean workers exposed to pesticides and they go on to say that
[49:36.400 --> 49:41.640]  genetic genotoxic and mutagenic effects of pesticides were observed in soybean
[49:41.640 --> 49:46.560]  farm workers and we have 182,000 what's wrong with having a mutagenic
[49:46.560 --> 49:49.920]  re-reaction in your cells and getting cancer oh exactly I mean cancer is
[49:49.920 --> 49:53.560]  exploding but why even worry about that and the viruses attack you and you're
[49:53.560 --> 49:57.400]  completely shut down so you eat this food you take this flu shots and you eat
[49:57.400 --> 50:01.560]  this food it turns off your genes honey bees die when they eat it yes exactly
[50:01.560 --> 50:05.480]  it's it but dying is good and now we have a verifiable proof that this is
[50:05.480 --> 50:08.080]  happening it's not just well it turns off your immune system and it does some
[50:08.080 --> 50:11.720]  stuff to your body well wash your post reported that that farmers have to plant
[50:11.720 --> 50:17.440]  with these GM crops a sanctuary crop that humans don't eat just for the bugs to
[50:17.440 --> 50:20.680]  live because they don't want to kill all the bucks they just want to get the
[50:20.680 --> 50:23.880]  poison food to us that sounds totally reasonable that doesn't sound like a
[50:23.880 --> 50:28.260]  sci-fi nightmare hiding in plain view or anything Anthony exactly like the IBM
[50:28.260 --> 50:32.600]  robot called Watson that will decide which troops not get health care to at
[50:32.600 --> 50:38.120]  at the government website admitting it I mean that's not a big deal kill on the
[50:38.120 --> 50:42.000]  troops no and I know and we might as well be speaking orchestra now because the
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.800]  thing is this is probably the biggest health news ever I mean if we could if
[50:45.800 --> 50:50.000]  we could understand this we would wipe out get into the studies that you broke
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.640]  down because this is also a plug here's how we found the operation we did sell
[50:53.640 --> 50:57.360]  out yesterday of roughly a third of ancient defense we did a limited run a
[50:57.360 --> 51:01.320]  few months ago didn't promote it got your reviews I've been using it for about
[51:01.320 --> 51:06.520]  six months before we even had it we sold out of that got a big shipment in so to
[51:06.520 --> 51:12.760]  selling it for 1995 ancient defense herbal immunity complex I said look I'm
[51:12.760 --> 51:15.440]  not taking the flu shot I want to try to protect myself my family I want to
[51:15.440 --> 51:21.720]  boost my immune system what are the known herbs and and and extracts that are
[51:21.720 --> 51:27.200]  accepted in studies documented to defend the immune system for bacteria and
[51:27.200 --> 51:31.560]  viruses and we went out sourced it but then there were a few that we didn't get
[51:31.560 --> 51:37.000]  because they were so expensive I want to come out with a low-cost high quality
[51:37.000 --> 51:44.320]  line called right side now similar ones are 35 to 50 more for very similar
[51:44.320 --> 51:51.360]  formulas this is 1495 normally 1995 I'm discounting it that's why it's selling
[51:51.360 --> 51:57.080]  out people recognize this is a big two ounce bottle concentrated it tastes
[51:57.080 --> 52:01.680]  incredibly rich and good a lot of different flavors in this it's got like
[52:01.680 --> 52:11.360]  20 different known superfoods in it elderberry flower I mean go over what's
[52:11.360 --> 52:16.560]  in this and the studies we've got of what it does echinacea ginger golden seal
[52:16.560 --> 52:19.800]  elderberry are some of the key ones that we put in there specifically hand
[52:19.800 --> 52:24.240]  chosen but the key thing to understand to me and all of this culminates into
[52:24.240 --> 52:29.000]  this but we picked up that's super high quality but also isn't super expensive
[52:29.000 --> 52:32.680]  but is known and then we source the highest quality and then cut the price
[52:32.680 --> 52:35.800]  in half basically exactly and then we have you know right side to be on the
[52:35.800 --> 52:39.240]  right side of your health to be on the right side of the initiative anti big
[52:39.240 --> 52:42.880]  pharma and then we have info wars life for super high quality super powerful
[52:42.880 --> 52:47.200]  mega ingredients but to understand why we're talking about all this why we're
[52:47.200 --> 52:49.960]  always talking about these key ingredients like elderberry and ginger and
[52:49.960 --> 52:53.200]  everything like that why we're pushing this because we believe in it is to
[52:53.200 --> 52:58.760]  understand that these is what we're doing read them the studies about this
[52:58.760 --> 53:03.080]  stuff okay so when you activate your immune system again which can be done
[53:03.080 --> 53:06.160]  everyone listening right now can do that if you activate your immune system you
[53:06.160 --> 53:09.840]  will produce mannose binding lectins again those are the those are the things
[53:09.840 --> 53:14.520]  that block viruses and if you do that if you activate your immune system you can
[53:14.520 --> 53:17.440]  produce them again and some of the research here one you start turning your
[53:17.440 --> 53:22.200]  immune system on researchers from Dallas Medical University found that
[53:22.200 --> 53:28.520]  sepsis patients had civics they were recovering completely tuberculosis they
[53:28.520 --> 53:31.640]  had significantly everyone had tuberculosis in these studies they had
[53:31.640 --> 53:34.400]  lower blood levels of mannose binding lectins so their immune system was
[53:34.400 --> 53:39.240]  shut down people that were dying of pneumonia were found to have virtually
[53:39.240 --> 53:42.800]  no mannose binding lectins so their immune systems have been turned off so
[53:42.800 --> 53:47.240]  everyone has been turned off essentially there's a switch in your body a light
[53:47.240 --> 53:50.440]  switch you know with a huge light bulb and you die cancer when you wouldn't yeah
[53:50.440 --> 53:53.400]  when you switch it off it could be anything that's what's so amazing
[53:53.400 --> 53:56.480]  it could be a bacteria it could be a virus could be a cancer in your body
[53:56.480 --> 54:02.680]  sinus infections were found to attack people with low levels of this rheumatoid
[54:02.680 --> 54:08.400]  arthritis ovarian cancer influenza A the flu different cystic fibrosis
[54:08.400 --> 54:15.800]  candida now tie this into the studies of why elderberry and things goes after the
[54:15.800 --> 54:19.000]  virus is explained exactly so what happens is once you start taking things
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.600]  like elderberry elderberry has been found by PubMed National Library of
[54:22.600 --> 54:26.720]  Medicine to go in and reduce the length of the flu because what happens is it
[54:26.720 --> 54:29.760]  starts turning that light switch up gradually to back on turning your immune
[54:29.760 --> 54:33.240]  systems light switch back on and if you can fully put it on then you're just
[54:33.240 --> 54:36.400]  evaporating things and attacking the cell walls of viruses but everyone's
[54:36.400 --> 54:40.280]  is probably pretty low maybe mid-grade even really healthy people are a little
[54:40.280 --> 54:43.840]  bit up but it's not on yet that light bulb was not fully on you know it's
[54:43.840 --> 54:48.520]  pulsing with some electricity but if you can give your body what it needs to turn
[54:48.520 --> 54:51.760]  that light bulb on once again the immune system will just go full force and you'll
[54:51.760 --> 54:54.760]  you showed the studies from PubMed and stuff yesterday do you have those in
[54:54.760 --> 54:57.760]  front of you now they're not in here right now because we already covered them
[54:57.760 --> 55:01.600]  but I'll talk about specifically the PubMed studies showing that guys do me a
[55:01.600 --> 55:04.680]  favor run in the other studio it's on the right hand side where he was that
[55:04.680 --> 55:08.200]  once they cleaned it off and bring them in here or just type in elderberry PubMed
[55:08.200 --> 55:13.040]  study flu go ahead there's over 144 different ones for just for elderberry
[55:13.040 --> 55:16.240]  ginger as well echinacea that's why everyone's used it for so long and they
[55:16.240 --> 55:19.120]  found this 100% true when we look at the documents from a thousand years ago
[55:19.120 --> 55:22.480]  where they wrote in their books you know like we for some reason when he's
[55:22.480 --> 55:25.760]  affected by this we give him you know echinacea elderberry their equivalents
[55:25.760 --> 55:29.400]  or joey's that's why it's called ancient defense this is the known stuff in
[55:29.400 --> 55:33.040]  every culture that they would take when this was happening and now we have it
[55:33.040 --> 55:36.720]  proven today in studies and the reason it's such a bombshell issue I've got
[55:36.720 --> 55:40.600]  three children I don't want to get sick I don't want them to get sick and die
[55:40.600 --> 55:44.080]  I'm giving them this they haven't gotten sick or the flu yet knock on wood
[55:44.080 --> 55:47.640]  praise God but it's the studies does it mean it's perfect does it mean it's
[55:47.640 --> 55:52.600]  bulletproof does it mean it'll stop it 100% no but the flu shot doesn't even
[55:52.600 --> 55:58.200]  protect you lowers your immune system in mainline announcements so why isn't the
[55:58.200 --> 56:03.320]  medical system promoting this because doctors visits and drugs and hospital
[56:03.320 --> 56:09.840]  stays make tens of thousands of dollars this is 1495 it's simply put and pretty
[56:09.840 --> 56:13.240]  much anybody could put out high quality products like this so it's not something
[56:13.240 --> 56:16.840]  they can patent that's another reason the system is against it and waging war
[56:16.840 --> 56:21.640]  against it exactly and when MSNBC comes on and says don't take the flu shot it
[56:21.640 --> 56:26.160]  doesn't work something's wrong you know and the great thing is you can take this
[56:26.160 --> 56:29.520]  and start turning on you know that light switch with these with these extracts
[56:29.520 --> 56:33.400]  and the difference is you're not taking something like let's say Tamiflu
[56:33.400 --> 56:38.760]  Tamiflu they expanded the expiration date just so they could sell it to the
[56:38.760 --> 56:42.880]  British government talking about indicting them that's in the BBC saying it
[56:42.880 --> 56:45.960]  actually makes people sick and doesn't help them and yet they spent billions of
[56:45.960 --> 56:49.320]  dollars on it here in the United States and the UK they spent billions of
[56:49.320 --> 56:52.560]  dollars subsidizing it so they can push it on the public for the biggest flu
[56:52.560 --> 56:57.240]  season ever it's simple folks you need sunshine you need vitamin C you need all
[56:57.240 --> 57:01.880]  the what is it that's in the elderberry and all these other things I mean I know
[57:01.880 --> 57:04.520]  that you we were just showing some of the mainline studies in fact he just
[57:04.520 --> 57:08.880]  brought them into you but had they discovered what it is in the elderberry
[57:08.880 --> 57:13.360]  and other juices that is turning these back on so obviously it's a medley of
[57:13.360 --> 57:16.640]  things you know there's different chemical compounds inside of every single
[57:16.640 --> 57:19.440]  herb like that and there's different vitamins nutrients inside of that that's
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.280]  why you can have something like you know let's say ginger and inside of ginger
[57:23.280 --> 57:26.520]  could be different chemical compounds that we also don't even know they just
[57:26.520 --> 57:30.600]  found the new vitamin and potatoes a year ago I mean this week's like ginger
[57:30.600 --> 57:34.600]  is known as a powerful anti-inflammatory yes exactly or it's or it's like you know
[57:34.600 --> 57:39.120]  if you if you if you eat a carrot has a medley of vitamins well so do numerous
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.680]  herbs but one example of the studies we're talking about this is as far back
[57:42.680 --> 57:47.280]  as 1995 which is amazing because we could fund this that's a PubMed study
[57:47.280 --> 57:50.200]  right if the government went in and funded this instead of big pharma we'd
[57:50.200 --> 57:53.080]  already be 50 million light years ahead of where we are and we would not be
[57:53.080 --> 57:56.480]  getting these sicknesses so elderberry appears to be safe and effective
[57:56.480 --> 58:01.440]  treatment for influenza A and B again from 1995 this is on PubMed and again
[58:01.440 --> 58:05.200]  PubMed is basically the National Library of Medicine which all the top
[58:05.200 --> 58:09.200]  universities worship so they freak out when something comes out that says you
[58:09.200 --> 58:12.600]  know elderberry wipes out the flu or when they say high fructose corn syrup
[58:12.600 --> 58:15.960]  which happened last month high fructose corn syrup's making you fat sick and
[58:15.960 --> 58:19.520]  you're killing and gross cancer yeah exactly one of my friends is a cancer
[58:19.520 --> 58:23.880]  survivor and they told her do not mainline cancer the scientists do doctor
[58:23.880 --> 58:28.040]  one of the top ones in San Antonio said do not drink high fructose corn syrup it
[58:28.040 --> 58:32.120]  turns cancer cells on so the good news is just getting into medical science as

[58:58.320 --> 59:02.520]  toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations
[59:02.520 --> 59:06.560]  of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[59:06.560 --> 59:10.640]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42
[59:10.640 --> 59:14.720]  million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold and
[59:14.720 --> 59:18.680]  mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million
[59:18.680 --> 59:21.880]  Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to

[59:51.120 --> 59:56.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:56.520 --> 01:00:12.720]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:20.240]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:26.720]  Alex Jones open the phones up the next couple segments what's your take on the
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.880]  state of the Union what do you think the biggest lie of the evening was or maybe
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:35.360]  you think it's all true Kurt Nemo has a story up Obama state of the Union more
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.280]  stolen stuff Samsung responds to privacy concerns over TV's recording
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:44.880]  personal conversations that article just went live minutes ago Paul Joseph
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:48.920]  Watson okay Anthony again you're gonna be back on the nightly news tonight to
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.360]  really do a special report showing all the documentation and all the different
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:57.640]  studies but yeah it's a pitch I believe in promoting what I use we fund their
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.720]  operation with a super high quality ancient defense herbal immunity complex
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:06.960]  that has like 20 amazing known ingredients I say like 20 let me count
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.760]  them it's more than 20 that I have been known throughout history but have been
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:18.160]  in major studies to boost the immune system help the body and that's what
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:22.000]  we're saying here is is it's insane to get a flu shot when it doesn't even
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.560]  protect you why isn't the government promoting things like elderberry and
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:29.600]  stuff that's in ancient defense available at info wars life calm now
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.120]  six that's exactly it you can go out and look at these studies where we could
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:38.520]  offer people elderberry which in a complex to be $14 versus funding the
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.800]  pharmaceutical companies and subsidizing the corn industry to go ahead and make
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.000]  high-fructose currency up for billions and billions of dollars every single
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.280]  year so just looking at one more study which is absolutely essential the
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.080]  randomized study of the efficacy and safety of oral elderberry extract in
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:56.920]  the treatment of influenza A and B virus infections and they conclude they say
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.160]  it's been used in folk medicine for centuries and they're you know kind of
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.560]  doubting it and it's been used to treat colds and the flu and science infections
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.680]  and it's been reported to have an ovary antel and antiviral activity and
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:13.400]  they're saying is that really true well they said they concluded symptoms were
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:17.240]  relieved on average four days earlier and use of rescue medication was
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:21.200]  significantly less and those receiving elderberry extract compared with placebo
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.640]  elderberry extract seems to be offering efficient safe and cost effective
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:29.840]  treatment for influenza and they did this study once you had it yes I know
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.560]  there are studies also on taking it before for prevention that's that's the
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.080]  ideal way it's kind of like cancer if you can prevent cancer you're in the
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.600]  right boat if you're starting to actually do things in your body to
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.520]  enhance your immune system turn out light switch on you're winning the battle once
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.280]  you have cancer you can obviously fight it and you know do numerous things to it
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:50.440]  but once you have it that means that your body has been so degradated and
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.960]  your immune system has been turned off so much that you're in a very fractured
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.320]  state just like if you have the flu which everyone gets now and then in
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.560]  this world we live in eating roundup eating GMOs but once you have the flu
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.680]  you already have that light switch is stuck to the ground so it's a battle
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.880]  getting it up if you can prevent it that is the absolute essential key and what
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.600]  we're saying is we just want more studies on this we want the government and
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.040]  the big pharmaceutical companies to actually admit they've just been
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:18.120]  funding their garbage all absolutely well personally I'm not taking the flu
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:22.000]  shot my children aren't and we're taking the ancient defense and we're doing
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.280]  great praise God a lot of that's prayer I know but it's in the studies it's
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:32.320]  common sense drink purified water folks get sunshine get plenty of rest say your
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:38.160]  prayers the study showing prayer helps health and you know take the compounds
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.200]  out there that are known to turn your body's immune system on this is not
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.960]  rocket science and most doctors you were talking about the really really good
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.840]  doctors they know all this I mean they're really really good doctor when I go
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.720]  to the pediatricians they say oh and take elderberry yeah they'll say hey take
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.040]  some echinacea elderberry you know some key probiotics make sure you get a
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.880]  fight I don't know the good news is this is getting out of them than the
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.480]  medical doctors oh absolutely the ones that are at the top who actually read the
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:06.080]  studies and care the ones that go to the curriculum from 1954 and just read
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.360]  about radiating and killing and cutting they're not actually learning anything
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.920]  because they don't want to learn anything they just are closed off and
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.520]  there is a time to radiate and cut once you have it well when your immune
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.520]  system is shut down sometimes the only thing you can do is absolutely I mean
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:21.880]  there is the extreme end of cooked them in the whole supplement thing saying
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.600]  this will cure you this is perfect oh yeah no we're all gonna die it's just that
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.280]  the studies are there there's a way to get your immune system boosted your body

[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:26.320]  the Hollywood Reporter is weighing in on the so-called controversy that black
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.440]  centered black themed movies are not being nominated in the numbers they
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:38.960]  should be at the Academy Awards and there's a cartoon up on info wars.com
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:48.720]  down at the bottom that has an image of Al Sharpton basically saying you know
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:53.680]  give us a nomination or we're going to basically come after you and that's
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:09:00.720]  what he does is shake people down but django unchained producer on Selma
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:09.760]  oscar snubs says that basically the voters may have had racial fatigue yeah
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.720]  it's it's not called being racist it's called being sick of it
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.160]  sick of just constant obsessing
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:30.800]  over race to make that the only issue so that the public is so obsessed with it
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:36.160]  the social engineers can steal all of our basic freedoms our society put us into
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:42.320]  debt while we're busy fighting over this another crazy article intended as a
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:49.920]  tribute casinos MLK day menu offends some associated press a new jersey casino
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.680]  says one of its restaurants intended to honor Martin Luther King was from the
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.880]  south by offering fried chicken collared greens i'm getting hungry right now
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.400]  and macaroni and cheese some twitter users objected to what they considered
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:08.720]  racially offensive choices others called the criticism political correctness run
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:15.680]  among Joe Lupo senior vice president of morgata in Atlantic city so the
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.680]  metropolitan restaurant shows menu items that were among king's favorite foods
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.960]  according to history as documented numerous historical sources
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.920]  he says the restaurant's manager is an african-american woman
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:30.080]  and that she chose the menu intending to honor king yeah you see
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.880]  i told the story of being at martin springs a couple years ago there were
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:37.360]  two hispanic males and a white male about 20 feet in front of me i'm on the
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.960]  grass laying out the sun to swim two miles
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.680]  and they're obviously stoned and smoking marijuana you could tell they're in a
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:48.240]  good mood and they're saying i'm hungry one of hispanic says let's go eat
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.960]  chinese food
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.400]  and the whole white male and the other hispanic look at him and they go man
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.480]  that's racist see to say the word chinese see
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:06.560]  talking is racist communicating is racist if you play with a nerf gun in your
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.840]  backyard the school suspends you even though it's not their jurisdiction
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:14.480]  there's no law it's a power grab zero
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:21.200]  tolerance racism it's about being extreme
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:26.000]  don't have brown bags in city events it's racist no one ever said a brown bag
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.600]  was racist no one ever said that but see they
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:33.440]  they say it is to create a paranoia a witch hunt where
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.880]  people that aren't racist start getting obsessed and going well what am i doing i
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.240]  better conform and do whatever i'm told so they make the bar
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:45.760]  so high it's impossible to ever reach so that again
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.480]  they're in the position of lecturing it's incredible arrogance and it's
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:56.160]  scientifically done soul food is just southern
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:00.480]  cooking and it's extremely tasty it's extremely
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.560]  fattening and it's one of my favorite foods i love mexican food
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.640]  extremely fattening do i say let's go eat mexican foods i don't like
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:14.080]  mexicans see this is what they dumb it down to
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.600]  to where if you want to eat the dishes that martin Luther king like because
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:23.760]  you're a black manager who likes classically southern black food which
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.760]  i mean i'll be quite honest with you folks i i know it's just racist to say it
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.520]  but uh i love going to soul food places and eating black food of course i'm
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.840]  being sarcastic ladies and gentlemen i eat asian food i eat sushi that's
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.280]  japanese i go into southern cooking places
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:43.600]  at least i used to let's just say this i used to go into soul food outfits and
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.120]  southern cooking places that's probably my favorite food but i don't eat
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:51.920]  chicken fried steaks anymore maybe i have one a year
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:56.560]  i mean i've been in a restaurant before and thought about political correctness
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.760]  when i'm watching black people order fried chicken with gravy and i'm doing
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:08.160]  the same thing i mean if i go to a a a a organic
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.760]  fried chicken place which i did do with my kids about a month ago as a treat
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.320]  lucies and i was in there was almost all white people eating fried chicken and
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:21.280]  collard greens but there was a black family in there
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:25.280]  i mean this is mental illness ladies and gentlemen to have to then say it's
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:31.440]  racist that i like sweet potatoes and i like
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:34.960]  chicken fried steak or i like fried chicken or i like
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:40.800]  fried okra or i like sweet potatoes or i like cornbread because black people in
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.720]  the south like it they like it because it tastes good
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:49.040]  it has nothing to do with white people or black people
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.720]  other than the fact that that's the food that developed in the south out of
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.960]  both cultures and the truth is the cultures are
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:04.000]  about a half inch apart from each other so this again is purely meant to create
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.520]  an obsession a mental illness where a black manager
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:13.600]  wants to have some soul food thinks it'd be a good idea to put it on the menu
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.080]  no kidding
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:23.360]  i mean when you walk in a mexican food restaurant is it because you're racist
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:27.360]  obviously not if you say let's go eat mexican food is saying the word mexican
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:33.920]  racist no it's not if you say you want to go eat barbeque
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.800]  i always love the cliches that black people like barbeque
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.880]  everybody likes barbeque and those are modern media examples
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:49.520]  pushed by the left of the last 50 years i looked it up to attribute it to what
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:53.920]  racists say about black people until it became true
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:59.200]  and racists do make those jokes see how they're pushing and promoting a
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.760]  culture of obsessing over all of this
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:09.680]  they say the casino restaurant offers menus geared towards holidays
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:13.040]  including chinese meals at the chinese new year and mexican food on sinca
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.920]  demio yeah and what's happened at colleges all over the country
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:22.640]  they said on sinca demio you are banned from having mexican style parties if
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.720]  you're not a mexican purely hispanic or mexican
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.320]  fraternity everybody's like but we want to drink tequila and wear sombreros and
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:35.920]  get drunk and eat mexican food well sorry that's hurtful you can't do it
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:39.600]  i mean so what if it hurts somebody's mentally ill
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:43.280]  feelings that i want to put on a sombrero and get drunk i mean i did stuff
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:47.520]  like that when i was 20 years old
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:51.840]  just like you know i went to toga parties
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.080]  wasn't making fun of greeks either they told people don't be a geisha girl
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:59.360]  don't be a cowboy or a native american and that will hurt someone's feelings
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.720]  well then so what if a mentally ill person gets their feelings hurt i told
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.720]  the story here in austin and it's happened more
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:10.400]  since then they want people try to have yoga days
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.640]  and in halloween have folks dress up like people from india
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.160]  and it gets shut down by the left at super liberal facilities
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:21.040]  because they say that would be hurtful see you're not allowed to have any
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.320]  culture and i never finished the point about the
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.240]  guns you can play with a nerf gun in your backyard and be kicked out of school
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.840]  but then if you go play video games of murdering people that's okay
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:36.560]  see the systems allowed to put out whatever it wants
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.640]  quentin tarantino can put out movies with the n word every other sentence
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:44.720]  that's okay because he's part of the establishment but if you an unknown actor
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:48.320]  or director put something out you'll be crucified see it's about
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.080]  the system shedding the agenda and saying what's acceptable
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.200]  now i want to get into the state of the union the carbon taxes the so-called
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.240]  free education all the bull what did you think the biggest
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.320]  doozy of the whole situation was and while callers are talking i'm going to
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:07.360]  play um guys my computer shut down here with the callers on it
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:10.800]  can somebody nix that out of there so so i can get that thank you so i can see
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.480]  who the callers are thank you um
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:17.840]  we're gonna take some of your phone calls till about 40 after and then david
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.280]  night's going to pop in and we'll continue with your phone calls then
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.480]  congressman jones pops in for about 20 minutes and then we'll continue with
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:29.280]  phone calls and news i haven't gotten to yet uh steven new jersey uh your take on
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:32.400]  the state of the union i heard about a lot of free stuff
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.520]  kind of like obama care was going to be free that i'm going to be getting what
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.120]  do you think well uh thanks for thanks for having me on
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.240]  alex have been listening for a few years now i've never called him before so this
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:46.000]  is pretty exciting for me um i got a solution for the uh the problem with
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.600]  the lack of black nominees for the academy awards i say we nominate the
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.520]  president because that whole thing last night was just a complete act
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:57.440]  that's an article right there tweet that tweet that
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:04.640]  uh info wars dot com nominates barack obama for best
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.880]  actor and that should satisfy al sharpton
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:12.160]  because it was a complete facade last night that's right
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.720]  the people nominate obama as best black actor
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:20.720]  just have an award for that for bs that's a great point
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.280]  absolutely i mean i've gone to college for political science and economics and
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:28.640]  i was watching the whole thing and it was just it was absolutely disgusting
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:32.000]  he says he's always gonna you know crack down on the fat cats and
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.600]  wall street and protects the middle protects the middle class
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.600]  where has he been for the last six years why hasn't he done these things already
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:44.240]  if that's really what he was trying to do
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:48.240]  well again he's the front man but the stated goal of the social engineers and
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:52.160]  the one tenth of one percent of goldman sacks is to destroy the middle class
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.360]  so they can then give us enough to live on and control our lives
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.120]  and social engineers that's the name of the game is making us dependent
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.600]  period and i wish i would have brought that up to
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:05.200]  errors yesterday that dependency creates a nightmare
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:11.760]  situation but notice bill ares couldn't defend malin people
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:15.440]  that's better than a lot of commies you talk to anything else uh steve
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:19.200]  of course one thing i want to go over also um i just got done working for a
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:23.040]  company i can't say who but uh it's it's a private company that works closely
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:27.520]  with the media uh for the elections um and this past election i'm sure you
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.880]  heard how cnn fired about 10 percent of their staff
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.960]  in october right before the election yes some of the staff some of the staff they
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:37.760]  fired were actually some of their top election people
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.720]  they either fired or you know basically made you know made them take severance
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:46.000]  or forced them into early retirement some of their top election people right
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.040]  before the midterms and they talk about this all the time i think that
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:52.880]  really speaks to how how how desperate the mainstream media is getting because

[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:43.920]  from cyber attacks now we know hackers steal people's identities
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:49.280]  and infiltrate private emails we know foreign countries and companies
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:54.160]  swipe our corporate secrets now our enemies are also seeking the ability
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.360]  to sabotage our power grid our financial
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:01.920]  institutions our air traffic control systems
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:05.280]  we cannot look back years from now and wonder why
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:10.720]  we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:14.800]  that's why earlier today i signed a new executive order that will strengthen
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:17.840]  our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.960]  and developing standards to protect our national security
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:28.080]  our jobs and our privacy
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:32.320]  but now now congress must act as well
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:37.040]  by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:41.040]  our networks and deter attacks this is something we
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:50.880]  should be able to get done on a bipartisan basis
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.560]  our diplomacy is at work with respect to iran
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:58.000]  where for the first time in a decade we've halted
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.680]  the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:06.720]  material between now and this spring we have a
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:09.440]  chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.160]  that prevents a nuclear armed iran secures america and our allies
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:19.840]  including israel while avoiding yet another middle east conflict
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.760]  there are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:28.560]  and i keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear iran
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:34.480]  but new sanctions passed by this congress at this moment in time will all
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:41.360]  but guarantee that diplomacy fails alienating america from its allies
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:45.280]  making it harder to maintain sanctions and ensuring that iran
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:49.600]  starts up its nuclear program again folks i really apologize you said to
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:52.800]  listen to two clips of obama my earpiece broke
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:56.800]  right as i was going on air so we had to scramble around the last couple minutes
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:00.800]  let's go back to steve then we'll go to john tim woody emmy
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.160]  and others getting your response to the state of the union uh we did just
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:07.200]  tweak that out steve your point that obama deserves
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.680]  best actor award at the oscars that should make
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:14.080]  al sharpton happy but let's go ahead and
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:17.760]  have you finish up your take i don't know the name of it because they just
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:20.720]  changed the name is it voter news services now
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.080]  vns that supposedly decides the elections
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.480]  what do you think was behind those massive firings right before the mid
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:32.560]  term elections uh in october of last year
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:36.240]  well what i would say about that is and of course as you know as you saw after
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:39.280]  the election turnout was at the lowest spend in
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:43.040]  60 years or so post world war two all time low
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:46.320]  uh so i think it really speaks to a lack of legitimacy within the political
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:49.600]  system as well as in the media because people are just tuning out they just
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:52.880]  don't they don't want to hear the lives anymore they don't want to pay for
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:56.720]  you know all the all the lives anymore and one thing i will also say about that
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:01.040]  uh so i sort of a new low point one of the recent high points that there was
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:06.720]  uh was in 2008 during the uh the uh you know the clinton uh obama rivalry
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:09.840]  uh that's in the ratings for cnn we're at an all-time high
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.880]  and they were making you know millions of people watching that because there's
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:17.040]  considerable interest uh you know in that drawn out political battle
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.320]  um you know but people are really just giving up on both parties they're
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.640]  giving up on the system they're giving up on the media
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.920]  and they're just tuning out in mass and i think that helps explain why you know
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.520]  cnn as well as the other news networks um the traditional media
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:34.240]  all tanking where do you think steve this is going to go in the short term
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:37.200]  mid term and long term it's obviously untenable for the
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:40.480]  establishment so i just see them stealing
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:44.800]  everything they can knowing that their reign of terror is coming to an end but
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:51.040]  historically sometimes things get worse uh not better in something like this
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.240]  yeah i would agree i think things are certainly going to get better uh you
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:57.040]  know worse in the short term eventually they will improve as people
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:00.720]  continue to wake up and continue to uh you know reject
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:04.240]  um sort of the you know the society that the social engineers are essentially
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.320]  creating um i i'm starting to think that either
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:11.680]  we're gonna you know there's gonna be a new third party or there's gonna be
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.320]  republicans are gonna be taken over by people like you know rand paul and
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:17.840]  ted cruise uh you know more libertarians the establishment
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:21.680]  is sort of gonna gonna either die out or change there's gonna be some sort of
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:25.520]  uh political party shift and this happens you can look at it historically
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:30.160]  sure major political realignment great caller steve thanks for the call
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:32.800]  john and others your calls are straight ahead than david night's gonna give us

[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:44.800]  this is all about not letting social engineers run our lives and that begins
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:48.480]  by admitting they're there and then discovering their agenda
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:52.320]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:06.640]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day

[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.720]  john in texas thanks for holding
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:01.680]  hi alex thank you sir go ahead i like republican leadership or not is not
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:04.880]  going to change anything and i got a story to tell you why they're not going
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.960]  to change anything a number of a while back i was listening to
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.120]  a youtube i was watching the youtube video of 3d ak-47
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:16.240]  and they were in russia interviewing the workers that worked in plant
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:19.520]  they interviewed this old guy that was in there because well
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:23.120]  we're making them for profit now we say that back in the soviet days we made
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:26.640]  them the we made them the further to cause an internationalism
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:30.800]  well i was in college station a while back and i went to the bush library
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:33.840]  and when i walked through the door into the lobby there was a big banner
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:36.640]  stretched across the lobby saying dedicated to the cause of
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:40.000]  internationalism so they're working on the same team that's why you're not
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.160]  going to see obama care down the way with her the whole
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:47.600]  soviet system that the bush is built is they're not going to anything about it
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:51.600]  well you're right the communist international is what it was called
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:55.440]  and it was openly funded by the british royal family
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:59.040]  by the richest families in new york and this is all mainline history for folks
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:02.880]  that didn't know carol quickly wrote his book tragedy and hope about it
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.480]  and they gave him tens of millions of dollars a month
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:11.040]  one train was 25 million not a new york city
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.880]  uh linen's train of gold as it was called
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.120]  delivered to overthrow the white russians
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:22.480]  and all the race-based folks out there i think that means white people it's just
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:25.600]  the pro-imperials were called white russians
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:29.520]  and they went in there and basically gutted that country
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:32.640]  murdered most military brass had a reign of terror for
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.640]  70 plus years as folks know actually 80 plus years
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:41.040]  and so you're absolutely right that the george bush library at college station
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:44.000]  is all about global government all about internationalism
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.440]  and the communists will tell you internationalism
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:52.880]  is their final goal it all comes out of the Rockefellers
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:57.280]  it's the exact same system the ultra rich funding communism
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:01.360]  as a way to make the public domesticated and
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.080]  the elites are then exempt from the very communism
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.160]  that they put us under and we're so busy fighting with each other over racer
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:12.000]  religion or you know football teams that we like that
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.640]  we are lambs to the slaughter i appreciate your call really good point
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:20.560]  woody in washington thanks for calling you're on the air
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:23.840]  yes hi alex i just wanted to say there was one
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:29.600]  notable absence in obama's uh state of the union address the nation last night
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:34.000]  and that was any mention of the looming international currency crisis that's
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.040]  happening right now you have this you have the swiss
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:41.600]  i'm capping from the euro you have china and russia
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:48.080]  brazil india all saying and all making major movements to be uh free of the
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.600]  dollar and when the dollar loses its status as the
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:55.440]  reserve currency of the world we are going to get hit with huge hyper
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:59.040]  inflation in this country and we're going to see a huge drop in
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:04.240]  our standard of living and he didn't mention one word about that
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:07.200]  well of course not exactly they don't cover real issues it's all
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:10.160]  you're going to get free college you're going to get free health care and a
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:15.200]  chicken in every pot expanding on that
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:21.360]  whether the dollar is the best house in a bad neighborhood to quote
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:27.760]  mr dent on this show last week or whether we're going to go under first
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.360]  it doesn't matter because the outcome is basically the same
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:37.600]  all currencies are being debased in a global race that's been going on since
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:41.520]  2005 or so but accelerating since 2008
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:44.720]  so they think that'll hide inflation if everyone doesn't
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:49.040]  well the peso for 20 years has been steadily
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:52.720]  rising in value against the dollar that ought to tell you something
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:57.280]  and when that inflation finally comes home which it will and it's starting to
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:01.840]  katie bar the door because it's going to absolutely be devastating
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:06.720]  but the globalists are using oil deflation
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:12.880]  to try to cover up the overall inflation and so there is an economic war going on
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:18.080]  between the forces of anglo-american power and again that doesn't mean racial
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:21.520]  it's just the old name that the british called their empire
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:25.440]  merge with the us in the textbooks is called the anglo-american
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:30.240]  power axis quickly wrote another book the anglo-american
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:34.160]  establishment folks should read it it's only 200 pages
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:39.440]  and the anglo-american establishment is a scientific dictatorship the most
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:42.080]  sophisticated of the three predatory power blocks
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:46.560]  all three are bad russia china the people running us they're all
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.080]  just super bad news
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.400]  but our elite is more sophisticated and even more evil
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:43:00.240]  they're the best and they look what they've done to us my god i mean
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:05.680]  cancer mental illness uh neurological disorders i mean we are the test tube and
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:09.280]  boy you can see what they're doing to us they have really screwed us over
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:12.480]  because they hate any free independent people
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:17.200]  america this republic is their enemy at every level
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:20.720]  uh and so you're absolutely right uh that
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:26.960]  that that's the agenda thank you so much uh in me in texas you're on the year
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:32.480]  uh yeah hello alex yes or go ahead uh yeah first time caller uh welcome
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:36.800]  20 years old alex uh just want to say on the state of the union
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:43.920]  uh when obama was saying about free community college now i when i was in
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:48.320]  uh middle school i remember the teacher was saying that oh yeah school is free
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:52.960]  and whatnot and i remember my mom saying well the
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:57.040]  lunches and all that stuff we pay taxes on
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:00.480]  on like the food that you receive in school and things like that
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:05.280]  and so i want to i want to ask you or i want to like try and see
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:08.720]  talk to yourself like what's going to happen if
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:12.960]  they try and make the community college free are they going to be like over
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:17.200]  taxing the people now or well number one it's not really going to be free you
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:20.480]  just end up paying more later in the second half and you
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:23.680]  sign into a government system it's meant to sucker more people in
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:28.240]  to the education fraud system that's a giant bubble and it's now collapsing
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:32.240]  uh just like they've done with the health care system it's increased profits
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.440]  47 in one year for insurance companies and that's the gao's own numbers and
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:42.160]  it's all coming out but you're absolutely right when you say
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:45.920]  people obviously pay for these lunches they pay for the schools
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:50.400]  think of what he's teaching young people that you really get something free
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:54.400]  you only get something free if you rob a bank
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:59.360]  or mug someone but that's not free because you degrade the society you
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:03.040]  commit a sin you create a criminal society where
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:06.240]  one day your daughter is going to be mugged or killed
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:10.560]  or if you're a cop that beats up people or kills an innocent person
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:13.760]  while lo and behold cops are going to beat your son to death
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.960]  see this is how your reap what you sow works
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:21.520]  in me and so that's really the big evil of obama's speech
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:25.040]  is that he's not even selling a robin hood collectivism
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:28.400]  where they're going to rob corrupt lords that have stolen tax money
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:31.600]  he was taking tax money and giving it back to the people robin hood was
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:35.360]  that had been stolen by an unpopular usurper not
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:39.200]  taking our money giving it to megabanks and then giving chicken feedback and
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:42.560]  claiming that they're actually helping people does that make sense
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:46.000]  yes there it does and one more thing i just want to say i'm uh i'm from over
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.680]  here under the south texas area and uh i'm pretty sure you've covered this on
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:54.480]  your uh info words before uh about uh all the
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:58.640]  sheriffs uh corruption and all that down here is crazy so i just want to say
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:02.320]  that and uh thanks a lot for having on the
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:05.440]  brother thank you for listening thank you for calling
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:09.280]  the reason i don't like callers thanking me is it's obscene
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:13.760]  i'm an obnoxious person unlistenable half the time my information's good
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:18.320]  but i'm doing this because i hate tyranny we're all in this together
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:22.320]  i mean i'm rowing towards the shore there's a storms coming in not because
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:25.840]  i'm a wonderful person i don't want to be destroyed and enslaved
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:28.800]  i want to thank you for your support i want to thank you for being involved i
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:32.400]  want to thank you for karen i want to thank you for not being a slave
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:35.920]  i want to thank you for starting the journey to be informed and for
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:39.040]  recognizing it's a fraud that you get something for free in this world
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:44.640]  it just doesn't happen yeah you get crack cocaine free the first three or
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:49.920]  four times somebody gives it to you i was like 12 13 years old
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:54.480]  repeatedly i was dating this wild cheerleader it was
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.520]  a couple years older than me and uh and it was she was in her
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:00.720]  neighborhood i'm gonna go david night i'll tell the story briefly
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:04.400]  and i walked out of her house one time on the weekend and i saw her older boyfriend
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:08.960]  that was like 19 she was like 16 i was like 13 i think
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:12.480]  and uh
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:16.400]  he's like it's all right alex i don't care if you're dating her
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:19.680]  he goes uh coming over here and right around with me
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:23.440]  he goes i want to give you some cocaine he uses smoke it like this let me show
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:26.000]  you i go to you smoking as well not all the time here
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.160]  i just want to give you this and i said no thank you
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:35.520]  but then another kid in the neighborhood ended up becoming a crackhead
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:39.280]  and robbing his parents and everything to give the money to that guy
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:44.400]  so yes you do get free crack cocaine the first two three times you you use it
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:46.880]  and then you're addicted that's why they go to the schoolyards
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:50.720]  and they do that and that's what obama's doing he's at the schoolyard
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:55.600]  going i'm going to give you something free no he's not but folks like being
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.320]  chomped you know uh david night you've got the floor in this
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:01.040]  segment the next and then we'll continue with calls thanks for coming in
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:04.320]  he did such a great job last night we'll show some footage of that while you're
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:09.120]  talking uh anchoring the analysis but but you've got a lot of
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:14.000]  key points to make what was the essence of this 2015 state of the union
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.600]  well alex i think from the big picture when you look at the state of the union
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:20.240]  he didn't really talk about any details at all he said he wasn't going to talk
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.880]  much about details i mean he did show things just as the previous caller was
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:26.800]  talking about in terms of energy he put up a graphic that was absolutely
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:31.280]  laughable showing how look our imports of energy have fallen and we are actually
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:34.640]  you know getting close to uh being self-sufficient
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:38.160]  totally ignoring the collapse of the fracking bubble
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:41.120]  taking credit for the fracking bubble and then ignoring the fact that it is
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.680]  collapsed so there was a lot of that type of thing but
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:45.600]  there's been details that have been coming out
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:49.200]  over the past week about what he was proposing to do and by the way he's the
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:52.480]  one that cut the permits to make the bubble pop
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:57.120]  not just the Saudis lowering the price so he's the author of shutting it down
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:02.480]  while taking credit for it absolutely sorry so basically he's got in terms of
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:05.360]  policy that he didn't really talk about that much last night
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:10.000]  i would say four categories taxes education
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.160]  internet and trade now two of those taxes and education
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:17.440]  he's putting those things out there for his base because they're really not
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:20.720]  going to fly i don't think and i don't think he's got a way to put those through
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:24.960]  but as far as the other two as far as internet and as far as trade goes
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:29.600]  he has the support of the GOP majority against his base that's why he's talking
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.640]  so much about free education and these other things because he wants to
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:36.320]  energize his base and alex he wants to incentivize
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:39.520]  further illegal immigration because that's been a core part
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:43.440]  of what's behind these open borders in terms of the dreamer act
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:47.600]  offering free education to people who are up to 31 years old
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:51.280]  that's going to incentivize people coming across the border
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:54.160]  even if he doesn't get it activated because they're going to believe
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:57.200]  that he's done it they're going to hear all this talk about
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:00.640]  free college everything about those first two proposals
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:04.240]  was a lie when you look at the taxes and look at the fact that he's proposing
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:08.880]  about 320 billion dollars in new taxes as you pointed out last night
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:12.640]  that's an increase that is bigger than the gross domestic product
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:16.720]  of 84 percent of the countries that's a huge amount of money
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:20.320]  to do social engineering with to quote unquote play robin hood but of course
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:24.320]  he's not robin hood he's actually evil king john and of course that money's
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:27.120]  going to go to these big colleges and these systems
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:31.280]  that are already bloated and act like you know roman imperial kings or
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:34.000]  something that's right and think about the fact
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.520]  that he's only talking about giving half of that back if you are
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:42.080]  supporting a charity that kept half of its money and only used half of it for
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:44.880]  the state of purpose that's not a very good charity so
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:48.240]  even the people who support this and think that they should have this kind of
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:50.960]  income redistribution they need to understand that's not working
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:53.520]  but at the same time he's saying i'm going to give you a free college
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:57.600]  education he is gutting the education iras for the middle

[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:26.800]  and many others that are holding in fact i'll get to Tim in the next segment
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:29.200]  you've got the floor go ahead and finish up your points about the state of the
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:32.320]  union David Knight Alex we were talking in the last segment about
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:35.920]  taxes how he's proposing to raise all kinds of taxes and mandates
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:40.720]  mandating that any company that has ten or more employees
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:43.680]  going to happen he's simply playing to his base that wants to see the
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:47.680]  government socially engineer the economy but take a look at this
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:50.880]  education proposal that he's had and of course as i said he didn't talk about
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:54.800]  any details last night of these programs but they have released these things
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:58.480]  in the preceding week on Saturday night they put out the details the education
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:00.800]  program now they say that they're going to have
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:04.960]  nine million students thirty eight hundred dollars per year but when you
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:08.080]  look at the actual plan on the White House
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:11.120]  site he says the title of this is president proposes to make community
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:14.720]  college free for responsible students for two years
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:18.800]  in the same document halfway down the document you've got the requirements
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:21.840]  and it says what the government has to do federal funding will cover three
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.120]  quarters of the average cost of the community college
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:28.560]  so he's not even proposing to pay for it he's proposing to pay for
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:32.000]  75 percent of it yet putting it out there as if it was free
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.440]  and assuming that the states are going to pick up the other 25 percent
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:40.320]  but the real lie that's in all of this is that at the same time he's
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:44.080]  supposedly handing out this free benefit he is
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:48.880]  gutting the IRAs the education IRAs of the middle class
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:55.040]  he's going to tax the gains from the 529 IRAs as well as discontinue the
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:58.960]  Coverdale IRAs for education the Coverdale would allow people to
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:02.480]  after taxes put aside two thousand dollars a year he's going to discontinue
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:06.320]  that the 529 would allow people to put aside after
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:10.640]  taxes after they paid their tax he is killing basic investment of
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:15.120]  act for tax money the further blowing the engine of the country
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:18.240]  absolutely he's punishing people who have saved
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:21.760]  who have invested who have planned for their children but idiots that think
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:24.400]  they're really going to get an education in this economy and want something free
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.960]  they get it that's right and what he wants to do is he
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:30.880]  wants to kill people who take responsibility people who plan people
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:34.640]  who save he wants to stop that and just turn this
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:38.400]  into a government handout for everybody because they love dependency
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:42.240]  they don't want people to be self-reliant but it's a massive betrayal
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:46.480]  of people who were told about this program who planned on it who used it
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:50.000]  he's now talking about how they're going to end trust funds listen
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:56.080]  the average amount in these 529 education IRAs that people have set aside for
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:58.800]  their children after they've paid taxes the only thing the only
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:01.920]  advantage that they get is if they happen to make some money
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.280]  some profit when they invest this education IRA
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:08.800]  and in a mutual fund then those profits are not taxed
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:12.400]  but the only thing that he's going to do is he's going to take that away from
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:15.600]  them and make them dependent on the government so it's not free
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:19.600]  as 75% that he's proposing and they're going to do it by
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:23.760]  gutting the middle class and when you look at the fact that he's pushing that
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:27.360]  everybody now needs to have an individual retirement account
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:30.560]  I thought social security was going to take care of us we're going to see the
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:34.000]  same kind of betrayal as he pushes everybody into individual retirement
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  accounts that we've seen with these education IRAs
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  and here's the coup de grace this is only the beginning this has already been
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.640]  done in latin america asia and europe of rating all the 401ks
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:48.960]  and after tax investment funds and bank accounts with bail ins and they've been
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:54.000]  lining the laws and regulations up for this to happen in the next
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.160]  phase david absolutely alex and and you know what
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:01.600]  that these aren't going to happen these two things by and large i don't believe
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:04.000]  are going to happen but it's still going to be
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  an incentive for people to come here illegally because that's been
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.600]  foremost in all of the discussion about oh yeah he was like signaling out
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:15.280]  illegals during the state of the union absolutely so this is a massive
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:19.120]  increase in the cloward and pivens strategy let's increase this base let's
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:22.240]  increase the entitlement for education as a previous caller pointed out let's
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:25.040]  advertise everything's free here that's right there's no free
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:27.840]  lunch you're going to pay for it in taxes either the state level or the
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:31.200]  federal level most your local taxes are paying for school well it's like
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:34.480]  courtesans running all over the southwest looking for cities of gold
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:37.280]  i mean it's just you're going to come here and it's not here folks we'll be

[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.280]  all right david night is doing an incredible job breaking down what really
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:30.560]  happened in the state of the union then your phone calls and congressman
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:34.400]  walter jones joining us on a host of issues continue
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:37.520]  david breaking this down well alex you said alex
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:42.080]  walter jones is going to be joining us he's one of the republicans who is
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:44.880]  fighting against something that is really going to happen
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:48.960]  and that's of course the trans-pacific partnership these trade agreements
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:53.360]  with pacific countries as well as with europe and of course our listeners
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:59.120]  know this is part of a global governance scheme to create regional trade blocks
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:02.960]  and then merge those regional trade blocks into a kind of
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.320]  corporate global governance and then walter jones understands that and
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:10.080]  politico has talked about that they have a headline political opposites attract
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.320]  on trade opposition they talk about how there's
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:15.680]  unabashed liberals like delaro and keith ellison
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:19.280]  are fighting this and you've also got republicans like walter jones and
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:23.120]  duck and hunter what are they fighting well they're fighting the fact as we've
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:26.480]  talked about many times that this is a secret trade agreement that's being
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:30.160]  negotiated in private by corporate lobbyists and think
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:33.600]  about that in mainstream news they admitted for two years it's secret
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:37.680]  you can't see it and then it signs away congressional power
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:42.320]  wiki leaks releases one part of 30 and it's beyond chinese style censorship of
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:45.680]  the web this is global government by another name
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:50.240]  and we wouldn't know anything about it if wiki leaks hadn't leaked those details
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:53.760]  because this is something that you can't see it without a non-disclosure
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:56.160]  agreement they don't let elected representatives from any of the
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:58.800]  countries take a look at this this is being done in secret
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:01.520]  he's calling it fast track what that means is that they're not going to be
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:05.360]  allowed to see it before they vote on it they can't change it before they vote on
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:08.720]  it as a matter of fact he's going to vote on it before he lets congress vote on it
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:11.280]  that's what's really happening with fast track well that's what polosi said
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:15.920]  about obama care and remember that under bush they they kept not letting us see
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:18.800]  the immigration reform package and then
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:22.960]  senator sessions leaked it and he got in trouble yeah so they want to pass laws
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:27.200]  secretly in this country i mean obviously this is a criminal operation
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:31.680]  so that should make you suspicious but the part that that's going to go through
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:34.480]  so he's got his base and he's betraying his base with this
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:39.040]  trans-pacific partnership because uh many on the left really understand how
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:43.840]  nafta really took care of the working class it's not free market it's not no
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:47.680]  no it was selectively written it's not it's not capitalism it's corporate
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:51.760]  cronyism and now the other part of this that he is going to get through that's
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:56.480]  going to make his base angry is internet of course he's saying that the FCC has
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:00.480]  control they have jurisdiction he doesn't need that authorization from congress
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:04.640]  and using bureaucracies and his executive orders he's going to push this stuff
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:07.360]  through and of course that's also part of the trade agreement
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:11.200]  getting certain aspects of syspa in he talked about this last night you guys
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:14.800]  got that clip about him talking yet again about intelligence sharing
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:18.400]  yeah here's why earlier today i signed a new executive order that will
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:22.240]  strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing and
[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:26.000]  developing standards to couldn't get congress to pass it so now he's just
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.720]  doing it it's failed twice this intelligence
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.640]  sharing has failed twice let's cut that clip i mean even google's against it
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:36.080]  saying it spies on everybody absolutely so that's one part of it the
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:40.400]  intelligence sharing at the same time he's going to enact
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:43.840]  intelligence sharing and of course what's behind that alex is he's going to
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:47.520]  give legal immunity to the corporations who turn that
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:51.200]  intelligence sure it's you over to the government well it's like obama care
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:54.880]  basically legalizes it for them to share your medical records with anybody
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:58.960]  and then he has the audacity to talk about how we're going to stop
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:03.360]  corporations from sharing your data as long as he doesn't stop them share
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:09.280]  here's the headline obama announces plan so obama to go after pension funds
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:12.400]  internet freedom i mean that's the agenda yes he's going
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:15.920]  after intelligence sharing in the name of security
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:19.200]  then telling people that he's going to give them privacy with these new
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:22.960]  regulations also talking about we're going to have faster broadband for
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:25.920]  everybody evidently it's it's clogging down and they
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:29.280]  can't get enough information about us over the current bandwidth and that's
[02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:32.800]  really it's about the fcc making it all quote government broadcast
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:36.800]  to begin them having a regulatory hook yes
[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:39.760]  that's what they want they've been on both sides of net neutrality they could
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:42.400]  care less it's just like romney as far as health care
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:46.400]  he's on every side of every issue so has the FCC they just want to establish
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:49.680]  their authority there and they're turning a lot of crimes
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:53.680]  that were misdemeanors into felonies you know acting the recode statute

[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:25.280]  couldn't believe it they're so duped and everything that they are and uh
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:30.480]  when he said free i thought you know how stupid everybody was clapping and i'm
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:33.280]  thinking there's a verse of scripture in the old
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:36.880]  testament that says my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:40.800]  and i'm glad that you're on the air the way you are i wouldn't listen to any
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:46.000]  other news media last night of the speech unless i listen to your people
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.800]  that were commenting appreciated very much you
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:54.080]  airing that and them speaking the way they did
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:57.840]  and what all you're doing i'm going to continue to try to keep supporting you
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:01.760]  thank you i i'm not a rich man and by any means
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:06.880]  don't claim richness but i'm an american citizen and i believe
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:11.840]  one of my granddaddy believes then the american flag would come by and they'd
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:18.000]  be playing songs about it he'd cry for to stand over his heart because he had
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:21.920]  boys in world war two that were on navy ships and uh
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:26.000]  i remember hearing my daddy say that he always would look up for his dad and see
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.640]  a tear come out of his eye and i have an emotional
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:35.680]  well for this country i have 14 grandchildren actually 13 went on the
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:40.160]  way well you're wealthy and uh you just said you're not financially
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:43.440]  wealthy you're as rich as it gets with 14 grandchildren
[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:48.240]  god bless you that's so exciting now i get sad all the time as well
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:51.280]  because america has been dumbed down pulled down
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:56.480]  so many bad things have been done to our republic but it still has had so many
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:00.400]  great things in its history and it makes me so angry to see the
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:05.120]  globalist doing the things they're doing but our morality and our strength and
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:09.520]  our independence is a threat to their world plan
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:13.440]  and so if other people shared your concern
[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:19.680]  and started to break down crying and mourning for our country that would show
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:24.080]  we were a lot healthier we first got to admit
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:28.560]  how much trouble we're in and hit bottom before we turn things around and i
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:30.880]  think we're starting to get pretty close to that
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:35.440]  right now god bless you sir great to hear from you tim
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:38.640]  you know i made a flippant comment a few weeks ago nobody attacked me for it but
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:43.680]  i kind of attacked myself later because it but it was meant to quantify that
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:48.000]  the numbers approximately 20 million russians died in world war two
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.360]  about 21 million germans
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:58.000]  tens of millions of civilians that got killed or put in slave camps
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:04.720]  by the nazis and the russians 397 thousand americans died close to that
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:11.120]  bridge sounds like a lot 300 and something thousand americans
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:16.000]  what about 20 million russians so when i said
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:22.800]  america really wasn't in world war two we were but
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:28.880]  here's the difference we weren't in
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:34.640]  land warfare for most of it with two huge countries battling it out like the
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:40.320]  germans and the russians that's total war where just bam i mean the
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:43.680]  populations are coming together in toe to toe
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:49.760]  never giving up absolute slaughter 300 something thousand versus 40 plus
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:53.120]  million so really for all intents and purposes
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:56.880]  oh yeah a lot of people lost family a lot of folks went down on ships
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:01.600]  my dad's first cousin you know older than him
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:06.720]  went down on a one of those ships shot by a german wolf pack
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:11.920]  torpedoed in the north atlantic trying to get food into england
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:17.920]  but it was because we had the bombers and the aircraft
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:22.640]  that our ground troops were spared the massive millions of debt
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:26.320]  that's why many of the casualties the greatest casualties in any of our
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:29.440]  air wars was world war two because it was
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:34.240]  thousands of bombers going in against thousands of fighter aircraft
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:38.080]  and it was just absolute hell that's why
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:41.600]  everybody i know and texas granddaddy was in the army air corps i mean they
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:43.920]  just came in here and just recruited the state
[02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:48.480]  and and got them ready and sent them in so if you were my grandfather's world
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:53.520]  war two was real and terrible it's just think about the huge loss
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:57.440]  of life on our side and then think about millions of dead
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:00.720]  japanese in fact i forget the number of dead japanese isn't
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:04.560]  an estimated three and a half million look up estimated japanese dead i'm
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:09.840]  going from memory here um and these numbers vary
[02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:15.680]  yeah as soon as walter jones is on the line we'll go to the congressman he's
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:19.440]  voting right now uh let's go to steve in georgia you're

[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:31.520]  uh about obama's speech last night after he said he uh
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:35.760]  reduced the deficit uh you know i knew that uh everything you said after that
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:39.360]  would be just another lie uh moving on from bad i
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:42.960]  i don't remember me or not but i'm a retired customization over here in
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:47.600]  north georgia talk to you about uh my uh salem

[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:59.760]  okay and uh uh uh last time bill airs you had him and i was
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:03.680]  so glad to see you walk the floor with that piece of scum
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:10.000]  he uh anytime that you can get a professor to say well
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:14.480]  uh i don't know what you're talking about over and over and over again
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:19.120]  just uh you know shows the uh the uh uh slime ball
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:23.600]  that he really is absolutely oh i'm not a commie i don't know what that red star
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:27.600]  is on my website oh i don't know what crony capitalism is
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:30.720]  i don't know anything about big foundations and we're just going to go
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:37.600]  through in a special report and show him saying that and then the facts
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:41.920]  yes he don't remember uh he don't know what you're talking about when uh
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:46.240]  he bombed the uh military dance hall in 1970
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:52.880]  in new jersey he killed uh and three of his uh members were killed during the
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:56.320]  bombing and one of them was his girlfriend and that's not the only
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:59.360]  end he he said last night he didn't injure anyone
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:03.280]  well i do you know my jaw dropped oh i know and and and when he's not posing
[02:16:03.280 --> 02:16:10.480]  standing on american flags he exactly he was very slick and wanting to pacify
[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:13.120]  us and act like he was friendly and nice
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:16.560]  and it was all about getting a point of contact and getting us to agree
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:20.560]  that's because the left is really scared they know people are awake to them
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:24.160]  and but what do you do when you're met with someone
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:28.320]  that just basically lies incessantly to your face
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:32.320]  i mean look we we do that every day when when obama talks to us but anyway
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:37.360]  uh the flu shots they're out i went in the va last week and i check up and
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:40.640]  they tried to get me to take a flu shot said no i'm not going to take one of
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:43.600]  those because i've never had the flu
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:46.560]  they never said uh you know what uh uh
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:50.640]  steve uh the only time i ever got the flu is when i did take a flu shot
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:53.200]  but now what they want you to do there at the va
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:56.720]  alex i know you know a lot about uh facial recognition
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:00.880]  now they want you to get a uh a retina scan
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:05.840]  and i'm sure that what they're trying to do is track the veterans so they'll
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:09.840]  know exactly where they're at and and how to take them out when the time comes
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:13.280]  well sure whenever they finally pacified philugia what they do they retina
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:17.280]  scan every man woman child and they're not trying to retina scan the gang
[02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:20.880]  bangers they're not trying to retina scan no they retina scan your kids when they
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:24.640]  go to these big theme parks and they retina scan veterans when they go
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:29.200]  in to get treatment because you are the enemy you're the people that know how
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:33.360]  to fight have shown you're willing to fight and if you are the criminals in
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:37.600]  government that have seized this country who would you be afraid of
[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:40.960]  and the fact that homeland security admits not the average homeland security
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:44.720]  person but the people running it you know eric holder people like that
[02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:49.760]  jade johnson all of them the very fact that they say the number one
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:54.560]  enemy's returning veterans shows you this is a vc french government
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:59.520]  these are occupiers and that's not rhetoric these people are occupiers who
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:04.480]  want to bankrupt this country and shut us down god bless you appreciate that

[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:22.000]  listener
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:28.000]  hey i was uh i watched that shift this last night on the nightly news and i call
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.760]  it a shift this because only the clowns showed up
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:36.000]  and uh it was thanks to david and leon and uh
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:39.360]  jacari sitting there like the judges on american idol
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:42.800]  that i was able to watch that because i could normally never listen to him for
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:45.920]  longer than 30 seconds well exactly we don't want to just
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:48.720]  tune out of the lies because everybody's already done that we want to
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:52.640]  take their propaganda and use it against them and expose them right there but
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:57.200]  didn't the crew look and act professional i mean they looked and acted
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:00.800]  but had better info than mainstream media i mean
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:06.400]  it was really a first straight job yeah because as i say i normally can't
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:11.120]  stand more than 30 seconds of him and i watched the whole hour there
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:14.880]  um but you know what they could have had that over and done within about five
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:19.680]  seconds if they just turned the camera from where he was standing on that whole
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:22.480]  audience and they just stood up and gave us the middle
[02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:26.000]  finger that was more or less delivering the same message
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.680]  yeah and bainer was back there acting like he doesn't like obama
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:35.120]  when the two uh party together i mean it is just pure theater
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:39.520]  we're we're bainer and biden sitting at what they could have done was they
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:44.640]  could have had nancy polosi dianne feinstein and hillary clinton back
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:48.800]  there dressed up as gogo dancers and we could have had obama
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:52.800]  wired up to a lie detector and every time he lied it would go off bells and
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:55.840]  whistles which would have been constant and those three could have been
[02:19:55.840 --> 02:20:00.080]  dungeon to the or being dropped into uh

[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:33.920]  from north carolina he comes on every few months to give us an update
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:37.920]  we've only got him till 40 after and there's a lot to cover
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:42.320]  uh the huge mainstream media coverage a lot of co-sponsors now
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:45.520]  on his bill that had almost no support of a year ago
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:49.600]  and that is to release 28 secret pages of the 9-11
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:54.800]  report and he he's seen it he's told us some of what's in it it's incredible
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:58.480]  uh it basically was allowed to happen bare minimum
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:01.840]  and he and saudi arabia was clearly involved as if we needed to know that
[02:25:01.840 --> 02:25:06.800]  but it's he's gonna talk about that but i he's late because he was voting
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:11.840]  on a bill uh to and it looks like it's gonna pass
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:14.720]  and he could tell you about that to save the unborn
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:18.080]  four months or older unless it's a medical emergency
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:21.440]  and then that's not abortion that's just a procedure and you can't kill these
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:25.040]  babies partial births so uh congressman we want to thank you for
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:28.480]  your work spend a minute on that then let's get into the 28 pages
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:32.240]  then we'll talk state of the union okay alec great
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:35.840]  what what we had was the rule to to form the
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:39.440]  outline of the debate and it's uh for the for your listeners this
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:46.960]  hr 36 the title is pain capable unborn child protection act
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:50.960]  and that means after the fourth month the only way
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:55.840]  that a a woman could have uh an abortion
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:59.520]  would be that if it was absolutely in the
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:03.280]  health of the woman meaning that she would die if it's not done
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:07.600]  so this is uh to stop partial birth abortion
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:11.280]  and uh i want to give trend frank he's the sponsor of the bill i want to give
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:14.320]  chris miff he's one of the strongest advocates of
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:18.960]  protecting the unborn he's from new jersey and uh i know this bill would pass
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:21.840]  the rule passed that wasn't even close even
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:25.840]  quite a few democrats voted for the rule which creates the debate
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:29.520]  and we will debate this bill uh this afternoon
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:34.240]  and then we will vote on it tomorrow and you believe it's going to pass
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:38.160]  yes sir i do and you what about the senate
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:41.840]  well the senate is hard to read but uh i would think that
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:45.520]  uh again the rules are different than the house that you know that and most of
[02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:48.800]  your listeners do but i would believe if it's a straight
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:52.320]  up a downboat in the senate i think it would pass also
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:56.240]  but i don't know what rules their debate will will have so that makes it a
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:58.800]  little bit difficult for me to give you a projection
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:02.800]  well if mr connell doesn't stand in the way it has a good chance of passing
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:06.560]  well i know i i think the republicans in the senate will bring this up
[02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:10.560]  i really do they better uh i don't have any questions
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:15.440]  that if they have the opportunity they will bring it up i really mean that
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:21.680]  uh it's time for us to bring the gift from god
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:25.440]  to give the gift from god a chance to live that's the way i look at well if we
[02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:28.560]  get rid of this abortion industry i think the curse that's on this country and
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:31.120]  who could deny we're under a curse will be lifted
[02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:34.880]  i mean who can kill 55 million babies and get away with it and it's just it's
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:39.360]  unbelievable we're going to break we're going to break in a few minutes uh

[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:20.560]  citizen don't you have a right to know the truth
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:26.320]  about who was behind 9 11 absolutely yes is the answer to that
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:32.240]  h resolution 14 call the white house and i'll give the number slowly
[02:35:32.240 --> 02:35:41.440]  202 456 11 11 now let me give the switchboard for your
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:45.440]  member of congress and that switchboard number is
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:53.760]  202 224 3121 call that member of congress and say
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:58.000]  look seriously at joining on house resolution 14
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:01.760]  alex let me explain to your listeners very quickly
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:05.440]  any member of congress in good standing can make a request
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:12.240]  of the intel committee in the house to read the 28 pages i would hope that they
[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:16.320]  would have time to do that but if not please
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:20.640]  just let think about it this way just give the families what they've been
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:24.240]  asking for they're the ones that that were injured
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:27.840]  this is the way the families to get peace and the american people to know
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:31.520]  the truth about 9 11 and i know you're not supposed to tell us
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:35.520]  everything that's in it but when they use national security to hide crime
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:39.040]  we have a responsibility how much i mean you've talked about it before i've
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:42.880]  talked to military people that have been involved in the house that that have
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:47.200]  seen seen it i mean basically it's that saudi arabia
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:51.680]  was running the operation well i would say this because it's
[02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:54.880]  already been actually five Graham who was
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:58.480]  helped write the 9 11 report he actually said at the news conference that
[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:02.480]  the Saudis were behind the 9 11 attack
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:06.720]  and also that this would allow the families if these 28 pages
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:10.800]  could be published this would help the families in their lawsuit
[02:37:10.800 --> 02:37:15.840]  against the Saudi Arabian government for damages that were done to
[02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:20.560]  the american people on 9 11 my god what type of apology do we owe the Iraqi
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:25.440]  people for blaming them for this well i don't you know to me i've got a
[02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:29.600]  poster i wish i could send it to you of a of a
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:34.880]  Saudi prince with a heavy stomach leaning back on a
[02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:40.080]  uh a pillow and and uh smoking a cigarette with a holder and seeing
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:43.600]  Uncle Sam on his knees to the Saudi and the Saudi
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:50.080]  saying go get those isa thugs but don't spill any blood on my rug
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:54.560]  it's unbelievable i wish i could send that to you
[02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:58.800]  uh that's why this again this is about the families who are in pain
[02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:02.160]  this is about the american people knowing the truth we will not have
[02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:05.680]  government for the people if the people don't know the truth
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:08.960]  and that's what this is all about well you've got a lot of courage you continue
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:12.640]  to bring in legislation to impeach obama if he launches more wars without
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:16.080]  congressional authorization you bring out legislation like this
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:19.360]  i mean i gotta be honest i love ron paul he was on last week
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:22.480]  uh ron paul too and he did a lot of great work fighting the fellow
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:26.240]  reserve but i think you now are even more bold than he was
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:30.080]  with the type of legislation you're you're you're you're uh bringing forward
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:32.720]  certain so i just want to say this everybody should be praying
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:37.040]  for congressman walter jones because he's the type of leader
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:40.320]  who isn't a glitter bug isn't some narcissist
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:43.680]  but really cares about his family and grandchildren and this country
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:47.440]  and we need more people in congress like him uh let's give that number out one
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:50.640]  more time you can go to jones.house.gov you can
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:54.480]  also go to 28pages.org to find all the information
[02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:57.360]  capital switchboard to talk to you remember to congress 202
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:03.760]  224 3121 or white house 202 456 1111
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:06.960]  and even mainstream media admits this is getting a lot of cosponsors
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:10.880]  it's gaining steam but at least demand that the intelligence committees of the
[02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:15.280]  house and senate read them and then have these members publicly
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:17.920]  say they've read it so when it does come out later
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:21.520]  they're going to be held politically responsible for aiding and abetting
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:25.440]  the Saudis because i'm here to tell you the Saudis are in an oil war right now
[02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:29.280]  with the u.s to destroy our frackers they're in a war with russia right now
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:34.080]  that's on record and Saudi Arabia i don't want to be a drama queen here but
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:37.600]  we've even had some issues i'm telling you they're all over the u.s i don't mean
[02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:41.120]  saudi people but the saudi government is too big for its bridges
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:44.480]  it's manipulating hollywood it's buying off u.s corporations
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:49.440]  they're out of control and and and and congressman have you had any
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:53.920]  uh any uh stuff go on any scuttlebutt any manipulation
[02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:57.360]  because you're doing this to the Saudis no uh
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:00.800]  alex i have not and and the way i look at this thing
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:04.800]  i know you're the same way i'm doing god's will because god
[02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:09.600]  sent his son jesus christ to save our souls by his son telling us the truth
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:14.720]  and that's what this is all about is the truth of what happened on 9-11
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:20.720]  and i have to me i have no excuses but to seek the truth because that what
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:25.120]  is what will make america stronger so the heavens may fall just as be done may
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:28.400]  the heavens fall do the right thing and that's it well god bless you amazing
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:31.760]  in the few minutes we've got left uh state of the union
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:36.080]  uh you were there you know witnessing it all obviously if you're informed the
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:39.200]  whole thing is a deception to see the president though saying i'm going to
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:41.520]  give you this free i'm going to give you that free
[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:45.360]  i mean he's like he's Hugo Chavez or something what do you make of this and
[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:50.640]  the carbon taxes and the the i mean just all the stuff he was pushing
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:56.080]  alex the one thing i'd like to say is that one thing he did not mention
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:40:59.760]  is the debt of our nation it is now well over
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:06.800]  18 trillion dollars in march of this year 2015 in two months we will have
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:11.680]  another debate on the floor of the house to raise the debt ceiling to allow the
[02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:14.640]  administration to borrow more money from foreign
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:17.760]  governments to pay the bills from last year
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:22.320]  that is one thing that i i just get upset with my own side you may mention
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:24.960]  earlier i did not support i was one of 24
[02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:29.440]  house members who did not support john vana i'd have nothing against him
[02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:31.760]  personally but i don't think he's a good leader
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:36.160]  and what america needs at this time or the republican house
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:41.120]  that's right we need people that don't want to allow the democrats and obama
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:44.640]  to destroy the country i know you also have been voting to try to stop the
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:48.160]  open borders obama in his speech said that
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:51.600]  he'll veto any legislation that tries to stop his amnesty
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:56.960]  it's an executive amnesty by fiat i mean why even have a congress if they
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:00.800]  allow this to happen is baner going to try to repeal obama care is he going to
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:07.040]  try to block obama on on open borders well alex that that's the problem i i
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:12.160]  was impeaching the president when he allowed those children to come to this
[02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:16.160]  country illegally and and yet our leadership and in
[02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:21.520]  washington we had a vote on the house floor to approve a lawsuit
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:25.920]  by the speaker to sue the president over presidential executive orders
[02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:29.040]  that's probably going to cost two or three million dollars i said why don't
[02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:33.040]  you just follow the constitution if you think that the president is out of
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:36.080]  line or out of control or not following the constitution
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:40.480]  then do what the constitution says we have the authority to do
[02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:44.000]  sure it was a stalling tactical take years with the suit
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:47.920]  uh so that baner doesn't get in trouble um finally sir
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:51.360]  sure you have been probably the most outspoken republican
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:57.360]  in the congress period i love ran paul i'm a little disquieted by him
[02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:00.800]  talking on both sides of his mouth about uh this
[02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:05.040]  partnership uh this trans-pacific partnership that wiki leaks release
[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:09.040]  part of that basically removes authority from the congress and the
[02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:12.720]  president uh it's secret i mean right there no one should support it because
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:15.040]  it's secret you've been fighting it and the
[02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:19.040]  establishment's been attacking you for that uh give us uh what you know about
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:22.560]  the treaty uh because it's secret is there any intel you've got being a
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:25.840]  congressman well what we're concerned about is
[02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:30.160]  especially the two issues that i because it's limited time
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:34.720]  i'll talk about the uh trade promotion to give the president the authority to
[02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:40.320]  bypass the constitution fast track uh fast track excuse me and and that that to
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:45.360]  me is an assault on the constitution and the sovereignty of america
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:49.120]  and i am fighting that i've got other republicans who have joined me
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:54.080]  uh not many but a few and we're working with democrat liberals across the aisle
[02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:59.360]  uh to not allow a president to bypass the constitution
[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:04.080]  seems like a no brainer it should be and thank you for speaking out about this
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:07.680]  and waking up the american people get behind and call your members of
[02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:11.920]  congress and say say stop giving authority a way to the
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:16.720]  chinese into an administration that doesn't care about the constitution
[02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:19.840]  that's right that's who's got most of voting powers of chinese on this deal
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:24.000]  it's incredible well congressman jones please don't thank me i want to thank
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:28.000]  you because you're a very serious person and you are really giving them hell on
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.400]  every front and in the beginning of patriots a
[02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:34.160]  scarce man hated in fear but when in time when his cause succeeds the tim would
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:36.080]  join him because then it cost nothing to be a
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:40.000]  patriot to quote mark twain and just as ron paul
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:43.760]  20 years ago couldn't get a single cosponsor to audit the fed
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:47.440]  as you know that's passed twice now the senate can barely stop it
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:51.760]  we're really getting close and so god bless you for your leadership sir
[02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:54.960]  but thank you for allowing me to be on your show and please god continue to
[02:44:54.960 --> 02:44:58.880]  bless america thank you god bless you sir thank you so much congressman
[02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:02.720]  all right powerful interview with the congressman i'll go to patent
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:06.480]  and bruce and uh... jake and others that are patiently holding
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:10.240]  here in about 60 seconds but
[02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:16.080]  i almost start crying when you just talk to a simple normal smart
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:20.960]  caring guy like walter jones who believe me folks is risking his life
[02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:25.360]  going up against the saudi's i've talked to the people that have read it
[02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:28.640]  and me you've you've heard what the former head of commission said
[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:33.120]  they knew the saudi's were running the operation and the pentagon stood down
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:35.840]  under orders
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:40.160]  and it was bipartisan
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:44.240]  and dick cheney was involved in the stand down george w
[02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:47.360]  i talked to people that knew him and separately i'm just gonna leave it at
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:51.200]  that he was hiding in a bunker that night and state and really
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:54.640]  thought that the attacks were real i'm not defending george w bush it's just
[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:58.960]  we've done deep research into this he was a puppet
[02:45:58.960 --> 02:46:03.440]  who by the way did not quit drinking i'll just tell you that too
[02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:06.000]  uh... you know drunk by five o'clock every day
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.880]  uh... and then the rest of time in the gym or watching sports center kind of
[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:13.360]  like obama and it's not just my sources there's footage
[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:16.480]  of bush getting off the helicopter falling down drunk i mean
[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:20.880]  whatever that's not that big a crown in my mind
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:25.680]  this attack bare minimum was allowed to take place
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:29.840]  so they could take american liberties and the deal for al-qaeda was they'd later
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:35.040]  begin with the entire middle east africa and and central asia
[02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:38.960]  our troops because they don't wear uniforms al-qaeda
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:43.760]  could not beat al-qaeda in iraq or in
[02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:46.640]  afghanistan
[02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:51.360]  now they're giving them footholds and i've studied
[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:54.240]  military tactics i've talked to top sources they concur
[02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:57.920]  with my research they're giving them so many
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:00.800]  footholds right now they're not going to be able to be beaten
[02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:05.040]  so i have to concur with the top generals that talked to dr corcy
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:09.280]  uh... and said that the the the element the government has actually flipped
[02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:12.560]  sides
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:16.080]  and is now fully backing al-qaeda for a worldwide takeover
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:20.240]  that doesn't mean here in the u.s or europe per se
[02:47:20.240 --> 02:47:23.840]  but when we say worldwide all over the world

[02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:46.960]  i want to go to calls first half time i'll get into this more it's a very
[02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:52.800]  important story uh let's go to patent patent you're on the air welcome
[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:57.360]  okay thank you alex uh there's two three things i want to say the first time
[02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:01.520]  for two i called i was kind of star stroke because you're one of my heroes
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:05.040]  oh you're please please you're my hero
[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:09.360]  the story we hadn't make it do done last night on the cult knowledge
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:13.600]  i think that is hard and if we can you know like she said
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:17.440]  the knowledge can be used for good or evil it just depends on the person
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:21.280]  using it if we can get our hands on some of that ancient knowledge of how to
[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:26.160]  manipulate people like she was talking about the cake mix imagine the same
[02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:30.560]  stuff they can apply to food or music or anything
[02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:34.160]  you know selling records or whatever they have used it on all of them sure
[02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:38.080]  sure sure you can't use the ring of sauron to do good
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:41.600]  so i wouldn't use the knowledge against others
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:46.720]  but knowing how evil operates you then can't be manipulated by it as easy and
[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:50.480]  you can tell others so yes you can use a cult knowledge
[02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:54.080]  by knowing it to be aware of its pitfalls but i do not believe you can use a
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:56.720]  cult knowledge and have it ever turn out good
[02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:00.880]  um if if if that's what you're saying i did watch the interview it was very
[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:04.720]  powerful i want to get that guy on my broadcast
[02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:08.800]  uh and uh get his view i was aware of a lot of what he was talking about
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:13.760]  but from that perspective again knowing the enemy tactics is good a cult just
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:17.520]  means hidden and so yes the global issues hidden systems
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:21.440]  of manipulation and you see the low-level thing you know it's hidden
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:25.360]  that obama's not going to give you free free education
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:29.040]  because we know the facts we know how to look it up well the average public they
[02:56:29.040 --> 02:56:32.240]  don't know how to look it up so it's magical to them so i guess i have a
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:35.360]  cult knowledge because i know about false flags well
[02:56:35.360 --> 02:56:39.040]  now the public knows about false flags so it's no longer a cult
[02:56:39.040 --> 02:56:42.160]  because it's no longer hidden do you see what i'm saying
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:48.000]  exactly yes yes sir so i agree with you you can use the occult
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:52.400]  not that you get out a weegee board or a pentagram but you know the occult and
[02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:57.360]  so you know their tricks go ahead you know how to defend yourself against it
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:57:00.480]  if you know what they're doing you know how to defend yourself again
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:04.400]  absolutely well said anything else the other thing
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:08.400]  i'm sorry go ahead go ahead go ahead okay the other thing
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:12.720]  i've found a way to in my town in the north city
[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:17.520]  tennessee i've figured out how to really put the word out about info wars
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:20.960]  i've got 30 or 40 signs out all across my county
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:25.440]  there's two three overpasses i put sheets come you know i go to the edge of
[02:57:25.440 --> 02:57:28.560]  the overpass and i put a sheet on each side
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:31.840]  that says at the very top if you want the truth
[02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:39.360]  go to info wars dot com or as young dot com okay i've got 30 or 40 signs and
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:43.280]  my friend's front yard is all across this county
[02:57:43.280 --> 02:57:48.480]  and i'm just you know there's not very many people out here that really
[02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:54.160]  go for the actual truth instead of whatever they can get out of it truth
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:58:00.640]  and uh the last thing i wanted to ask you alexis what is your definition of a
[02:58:00.640 --> 02:58:04.160]  terrorist my definition of a terrorist is someone
[02:58:04.160 --> 02:58:08.480]  that takes women and children hostage and threatens to kill them for demands
[02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:12.320]  i don't think someone asymmetrically fighting back against occupiers
[02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:17.760]  is a terrorist some people define it i think the palestinian that stabbed
[02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:22.240]  seven people in televiva attack including non-military people is a
[02:58:22.240 --> 02:58:25.200]  terrorist i don't think someone fighting an israeli
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:29.040]  tank in say lebanon and their own land is a
[02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:32.560]  terrorist uh you know they call the military person
[02:58:32.560 --> 02:58:36.160]  so there's my definition of terrorism it's it's threatening acts of violence
[02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:40.400]  or carrying amount to to to demand a political or economic gain
[02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:45.360]  is the classical definition but i think it's targeting non-combat
[02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:47.600]  radio we'll be right back stay with us more calls coming up
[02:58:47.600 --> 02:58:52.160]  version others the government's department of homeland security is buying

[03:03:13.760 --> 03:03:17.760]  because israel has broken a kind of a truce they had with
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:22.240]  hezbollah and i'm hoping and praying that hezbollah in iran do not respond
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:24.560]  that's all we need is a big war in the middle east
[03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:28.080]  plus ukraine is getting hot again i'm afraid of that

[03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:52.800]  time on this foolishness instead of taking our
[03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:56.160]  country back like they should that's right and then they act like we're not
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:03:59.680]  manly because we don't memorize all the sport scores

[03:04:15.680 --> 03:04:19.440]  industry is a bad thing well we don't need fracking in the first place and
[03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:24.880]  plus it ruins about a billion and a half gallons of fresh water and every frack
[03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:28.480]  it's drawing down our aquifers up there and it's just ruining our
[03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:32.160]  it's ruining wells in the areas causing earthquakes it's a bad thing we need to
[03:04:32.160 --> 03:04:35.920]  stop it immediately i know it has bad side effects i was simply and some of
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:39.200]  it's done cleanly in other areas it's not you're right i was just stating the
[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:42.720]  Saudi arabians are trying to bankrupt russia and the united states oil
[03:04:42.720 --> 03:04:46.080]  industries that are independent i was just stating why the war is going on

[03:04:49.040 --> 03:04:51.280]  texas economy but when are they going to give us
[03:04:51.280 --> 03:04:55.440]  free energy like tesla stuff i agree the answer to getting out of this is
[03:04:55.440 --> 03:04:59.520]  innovation which is the globalist block
