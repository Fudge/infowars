[03:05.820 --> 03:11.260]  points today you listen to the radio shows we did last Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[03:11.260 --> 03:17.500]  Thursday Friday and Sunday we stated that of course the markets are going to
[03:17.500 --> 03:24.860]  plunge that's the whole point they needed it to get the immunity for the
[03:24.860 --> 03:30.020]  crimes of the international banks the brokerage houses that carried out the
[03:30.020 --> 03:34.340]  Ponzi scheme with the fake liquidity that they're gonna leave us holding the
[03:34.340 --> 03:39.740]  bag with in the provision it makes the Federal Reserve dictatorial through the
[03:39.740 --> 03:43.740]  Secretary of the Treasury the private Federal Reserve it allows them to
[03:43.740 --> 03:49.340]  seize any homes they want revalue mortgages up or down it allows them you
[03:49.340 --> 03:55.500]  know carbon taxes of all different types it allows them to hand your tax
[03:55.500 --> 03:59.020]  money over to foreign corporations that none of it can be second-guessed or
[03:59.020 --> 04:04.220]  even reviewed it states that clearly it says at the discretion of the Treasury
[04:04.220 --> 04:08.660]  Secretary he can create a flim flam group chaired by himself to push
[04:08.660 --> 04:14.620]  recommendations and propaganda and so global markets are headed straight down

[04:21.340 --> 04:27.700]  public throttled the Congress with thousands of calls to one not to go
[04:27.700 --> 04:39.980]  along with it the establishment reacted by savagely savagely attacking the
[04:39.980 --> 04:45.060]  market and driving it down one point two trillion well they've just outdone that
[04:45.060 --> 04:51.220]  today the market is down four hundred four hundred four hundred and forty three

[08:13.540 --> 08:21.740]  I am going to attempt to simply and succinctly break down the latest economic
[08:21.740 --> 08:27.820]  developments that are just massive and then I'm going to open the phones up
[08:27.820 --> 08:32.640]  from the bottom of this hour we're open up now until the time that David
[08:32.640 --> 08:37.180]  Dike joins us two hours from now so of an hour and a half of open phones your
[08:37.180 --> 08:42.580]  chance to respond not just to where we know this is going hyperinflation that
[08:42.580 --> 08:50.100]  with a contracting economy at the same time or the term that I have coined
[08:50.100 --> 09:02.580]  hyperstagflation or ultra stagflation it is the very worst economic
[09:02.580 --> 09:10.900]  possibility the very worst economic nasty that you can be under we didn't
[09:10.900 --> 09:15.260]  have stagflation which was the worst thing the worst combination ever seen
[09:15.260 --> 09:23.140]  until the 70s in this country and that is going to be a shadow of what we will
[09:23.140 --> 09:33.140]  witness well that's already materialized to a great extent hyperstagflation
[09:33.140 --> 09:39.700]  hyperstagflation and of course economists previous to this in hundreds of
[09:39.700 --> 09:43.180]  years didn't believe that even stagflation could exist much less
[09:43.180 --> 09:48.940]  hyperstagflation but only in a manipulated contrived market can you
[09:48.940 --> 09:58.820]  have this unfold now the stock market has plunged over 440 points you of
[09:58.820 --> 10:03.380]  course were promised that everything would be okay as long as you acquiesced
[10:03.380 --> 10:08.260]  to handing the private banks imperial power we're gonna break down those
[10:08.260 --> 10:13.900]  powers but we here who know what's going on and other enemies about a
[10:13.900 --> 10:20.460]  sovereign and I their contempt for humanity knew that this would prop
[10:20.460 --> 10:26.500]  nothing up that this would accelerate things you know God love Webster
[10:26.500 --> 10:29.660]  Tarpely I think he's right about Barack Obama but he continues to tell
[10:29.660 --> 10:33.860]  everybody that the new deal is the answer the new deal was the bankers
[10:33.860 --> 10:39.860]  beginning a domestication of the American people and that's when federal
[10:39.860 --> 10:43.140]  agencies started operating outside of the Congress that was the real beginning
[10:43.140 --> 10:52.900]  of Congress becoming vestigial or a left behind it's like a tits on a bore as
[10:52.900 --> 11:01.820]  the old country saying goes vestigial men have vestigial rest well the
[11:01.820 --> 11:09.780]  Congress is like the tiny mammary glands and there's the entire no mechanism is
[11:09.780 --> 11:14.300]  in a mail just not activate never grows
[11:16.140 --> 11:22.060]  well it's the same thing Congress is like mammary glands on a bore there's
[11:22.060 --> 11:30.500]  really no use for them huh now the people did not acquiesce the people
[11:30.500 --> 11:34.740]  despite the terrorizing of the New World Order Monday last Monday seven days
[11:34.740 --> 11:44.660]  ago of okay you didn't you didn't you told Congress thousand calls to one
[11:44.660 --> 11:48.860]  conservatively that you didn't want this how about the plunge protection team
[11:48.860 --> 12:04.700]  president's group on markets doesn't prop it up and so it plunged one point
[12:04.700 --> 12:15.460]  two trillion well today is setting up to outdo that as it nears that 10,000
[12:15.460 --> 12:29.220]  psychological barrier and so I'll be walking through that today the toll free
[12:29.220 --> 12:41.620]  number to join us is 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 and you're welcome to
[12:41.620 --> 12:44.700]  call them anything you wish but I particularly would like to talk about
[12:44.700 --> 12:50.900]  not just what's happening currently with economic structure or how it's
[12:50.900 --> 12:58.300]  designed or you know who is to blame I want to discuss that but also I want to
[12:58.300 --> 13:00.940]  talk about what's happening on Main Street what's happening in your town or
[13:00.940 --> 13:04.020]  city what's happening in your metropolitan area or in your rural
[13:04.020 --> 13:09.140]  community you live in what the effects in the economy are you see I can tell
[13:09.140 --> 13:13.500]  you what I'm witnessing it's not good and supposedly it's the best city in the
[13:13.500 --> 13:19.340]  country during this recession that's leading into a depression or I broadcast
[13:19.340 --> 13:28.620]  to you from Austin Texas but I also want to talk about the bad to worse you know
[13:28.620 --> 13:32.060]  you have the good the bad and the ugly I think the ugly is a better choice than
[13:32.060 --> 13:37.500]  the bad this is gonna get ugly but will it get really really bad
[13:38.500 --> 13:46.180]  martial law bad and there's these big debates now raging everywhere Alex
[13:46.180 --> 13:51.380]  Jones was right it was true Seattle post-intelligence her comes out and says
[13:51.380 --> 13:55.140]  it's terrible they want to use regular army brigades on the American people the
[13:55.140 --> 13:59.340]  Pentagon admits it a violation of Posse commentatus police state but in a
[13:59.340 --> 14:04.380]  republic CNN came out last night with a big report about how great it is and
[14:04.380 --> 14:09.180]  show the Apache helicopters lined up being loaded with weapons for its
[14:09.180 --> 14:16.620]  mission against us an open threat to those that have eyes to see but for the
[14:16.620 --> 14:22.220]  dumbbells more conditioning there's a bunch of reports out now and they
[14:22.220 --> 14:25.780]  line up the troops in the tanks the helicopters and they say that's to help
[14:25.780 --> 14:37.020]  local police they are shaking their saber at us they are waving it around
[14:37.020 --> 14:42.180]  their heads saying we are big we are bad and people are responding by saying
[14:42.180 --> 14:49.980]  they will destroy us they're too powerful they're invincible it runs the
[14:49.980 --> 14:55.220]  gamut from that to we have over a million men armed and ready to fight
[14:55.220 --> 15:00.660]  we'll easily brush them aside but there's a method to the new world order
[15:00.660 --> 15:07.860]  madness they intend for you to beg for the troops to come you see they turn the
[15:07.860 --> 15:13.980]  welfare checks off and they turn the gas pumps off and they turn the gas
[15:13.980 --> 15:20.180]  deliveries off both propane and fuel and oil because there's no credit to run the
[15:20.180 --> 15:27.100]  system and by credit because nobody trusts anybody to even be on a 10 20 30
[15:27.100 --> 15:32.140]  day payment when the truck showing up at the gas stations or demand and payment
[15:32.140 --> 15:38.300]  in hand even goes to that see they're gonna let things unravel this is all
[15:38.300 --> 15:44.700]  by design and then you're going to beg for the army you're going to beg for
[15:44.700 --> 15:50.420]  the troops to come and put down the rabble burning parts of cities and then
[15:50.420 --> 15:54.540]  they will come in they will bring food and they will give people IDs as
[15:54.540 --> 15:59.100]  economic refugees and then the people say man this was great having the
[15:59.100 --> 16:04.020]  military put down the you know illegal aliens and poor people and others
[16:04.020 --> 16:11.340]  running around looting and then the arrest start then the government the
[16:11.340 --> 16:14.660]  criminal government the occupational government will stage terror attacks
[16:14.660 --> 16:23.580]  against police and military in some cases they've already got feds leading
[16:23.580 --> 16:27.100]  militias who will launch attacks on the military saying what they're doing is
[16:27.100 --> 16:30.100]  unconstitutional you know while they're having firefights with people in the
[16:30.100 --> 16:36.220]  inner cities and they'll be military atrocities shown on TV to get people to
[16:36.220 --> 16:41.500]  revolt they may not even have to stage anything but they will and they'll high
[16:41.500 --> 16:45.420]  put up and show dead cops in the streets and then that will unify the police the
[16:45.420 --> 16:50.380]  military against the people and then they can come to Alex Jones's house at
[16:50.380 --> 16:57.580]  3 a.m. then the armored vehicles can pull up go in gun me down whether I resist
[16:57.580 --> 17:04.260]  or not which I'm not going to I'm going to make them strike me down I want that
[17:04.260 --> 17:12.660]  on record on record no matter what they say
[17:12.660 --> 17:21.820]  it's too important as a leader to take a victory from that that's a victory
[17:21.820 --> 17:28.540]  against them remember the Alamo remember Goliad now I'm not saying for you when
[17:28.540 --> 17:31.780]  they go into the second phase after months of the city's breaking down and
[17:31.780 --> 17:34.680]  burning when they're going around picking up Christians conservatives gun
[17:34.680 --> 17:38.460]  owners landowners people they want to steal from a lot of people that were
[17:38.460 --> 17:42.460]  serving the system at those points you've got to engage the forces your
[17:42.460 --> 17:47.060]  self but I'm saying early on people like me they're going to come after during
[17:47.060 --> 17:53.660]  the inner city looting and burning so I skip ahead to the second phase for the
[17:53.660 --> 18:07.660]  general public people like myself are probably in the first phase now I'm cut
[18:07.660 --> 18:11.860]  off from the radio during all this and things break down I am going to go ahead
[18:11.860 --> 18:17.100]  and retreat to the countryside and I'll tell the feds I know you hate me I know
[18:17.100 --> 18:20.980]  you hate us because we love America and Bill writes in Constitution and you
[18:20.980 --> 18:24.700]  think it's cute and funny what you're doing and you know you you want to take
[18:24.700 --> 18:32.020]  over so you've got positions for all your boyfriends you know I would just tell
[18:32.020 --> 18:36.220]  people in the strata who are not my enemy you know it would be nice if you
[18:36.220 --> 18:43.700]  just leave me alone so I could retreat as everything falls apart and you'd be
[18:43.700 --> 18:48.980]  advised to go take care of your family during all of this but I know it's
[18:48.980 --> 18:55.620]  you're committed you're wedded to wickedness and I understand I understand
[18:55.620 --> 19:11.100]  you need to you need to help America fall I understand that but CNN's reporting
[19:11.100 --> 19:14.020]  that they're getting ready for Marshall law basically so is the British
[19:14.020 --> 19:19.020]  newspapers so are the British newspapers so I'm gonna go over that but first I
[19:19.020 --> 19:25.220]  want to break down who did this who carried this out I mean this is by
[19:25.220 --> 19:28.260]  design that's why I mentioned Tarpley earlier saying no no this is a real
[19:28.260 --> 19:32.100]  collapse I mean I'm sorry I have the IMF World Bank documents we have we had the
[19:32.100 --> 19:38.260]  Bilderberg inside information we have all the proof I'm gonna go over that but
[19:38.260 --> 19:48.420]  this was engineered this was all planned it was all set up and we're gonna go
[19:48.420 --> 19:55.180]  over all of that and what it's gonna look like you know the minimum
[19:55.180 --> 20:02.460]  what's gonna happen versus the most extreme possibilities hi gasoline prices

[34:12.300 --> 34:18.380]  the veneer of civilization is soon to burn away and peel back
[34:18.380 --> 34:21.900]  as it's already done in mexico as there are
[34:21.900 --> 34:26.540]  thousands of murders a week as the society completely implodes into
[34:26.540 --> 34:32.620]  criminality as the government
[34:32.620 --> 34:39.660]  engages in more and more corruption

[35:12.620 --> 35:16.140]  to know who to pin the blame for this collapse on
[35:16.140 --> 35:19.660]  it is important now it is life and death
[35:19.660 --> 35:26.380]  now for all the marbles now
[35:26.380 --> 35:32.220]  right now to know who is engineering this collapse to understand who is
[35:32.220 --> 35:37.340]  carrying out the economic implosion that we are

[37:01.420 --> 37:05.100]  and he always sounds like he's completely stoned and i just don't want to

[37:07.980 --> 37:10.540]  every single day in fact i meant to say earlier i'd like to hear from
[37:10.540 --> 37:15.100]  first-time callers uh... but uh...
[37:15.100 --> 37:19.820]  you know i i just don't have time for games anymore ladies and gentlemen
[37:19.820 --> 37:24.460]  we don't have time to play games anymore it's a great weight on me i don't like
[37:24.460 --> 37:27.980]  having to break all this down i don't enjoy having to focus in on it believe
[37:27.980 --> 37:31.580]  me i'd like to go bass fishing
[37:31.580 --> 37:36.380]  i'd like to go water skiing i'd like to go camping with my children
[37:36.380 --> 37:43.180]  i'd like to go hunting i'd like to visit more with my grandmother
[37:43.180 --> 37:47.580]  precious grandmother the last of my grandparents
[37:47.580 --> 37:50.460]  and i don't have that much time to get it done because
[37:50.460 --> 37:56.060]  i work constantly in the fight against these people and i'm not trying to
[37:56.060 --> 38:03.580]  all right let me let me get into it let me let me break it down
[38:03.580 --> 38:10.380]  all right um...
[38:10.380 --> 38:14.620]  the bottom line is this the international banking cartel
[38:14.620 --> 38:17.740]  the private banking families and on the bank of england and the federal reserve
[38:17.740 --> 38:23.260]  predominantly that at the end of world war two
[38:23.260 --> 38:27.100]  they at the the anglo-american system had already been dominant worldwide to the
[38:27.100 --> 38:31.340]  british empire and then through cecil roads and when he set up
[38:31.340 --> 38:34.380]  all stated that they were setting up a royal government by roads
[38:34.380 --> 38:38.700]  queen of england you know gave him a whole country and named it after him
[38:38.700 --> 38:41.260]  they set up round table groups they said british
[38:41.260 --> 38:45.100]  intelligence management arms like the royal institute of international
[38:45.100 --> 38:48.220]  affairs in england the council on foreign relations the united states to
[38:48.220 --> 38:52.780]  recruit the most powerful in banking media industry
[38:52.780 --> 38:59.100]  academia philosophy to then give those individuals great wealth and shared
[38:59.100 --> 39:04.700]  power to be the true governing body over nations
[39:04.700 --> 39:07.900]  it's a similar model to what they developed hundreds of years previous
[39:07.900 --> 39:12.140]  through the british east india company in
[39:12.140 --> 39:15.740]  of course india
[39:17.580 --> 39:21.500]  a corporate behind the throne government system
[39:21.500 --> 39:27.660]  now for these international bankers it is quite easy to finance their armies
[39:27.660 --> 39:31.180]  to finance the takeover of other corporations companies land because
[39:31.180 --> 39:35.580]  they were able to get control of the u.s empire
[39:35.580 --> 39:39.340]  which was already an empire by turn of the last century by 1900
[39:39.340 --> 39:43.100]  by the british empire when they took over with the Rothschild controlled
[39:43.100 --> 39:47.660]  implosion of 1815 when they falsely put out the
[39:47.660 --> 39:51.020]  rumor that lord wellington and the british and
[39:51.020 --> 39:58.300]  austrian forces had lost against the polian causing the british
[39:58.300 --> 40:02.940]  stock market to plunge by close to 99 percent they then bought it up
[40:02.940 --> 40:06.140]  and went from the most wealthy banking family in europe and england
[40:06.140 --> 40:10.300]  to the owners of the economy and the sax cobert gopher
[40:10.300 --> 40:19.500]  dynasty at that point basically became their minions in hawk in pond to them
[40:19.500 --> 40:23.500]  lordships baronese were then handed over to them and the Rothschilds were told
[40:23.500 --> 40:27.180]  look we'll basically the british crown basically told them we will
[40:27.180 --> 40:32.620]  assassinate you and take your holdings if you if you don't marry in with us
[40:32.620 --> 40:40.940]  and so they married in british royalty what a bizarre hybrid that created
[40:42.780 --> 40:47.100]  so to know the president to understand where the future is going
[40:47.100 --> 40:50.300]  to see the future one only needs to understand history
[40:50.300 --> 40:54.540]  and again i'm going to give you a thumbnail sketch here
[40:54.540 --> 40:59.180]  there is so much proof to what i say so much so many facts
[40:59.180 --> 41:03.180]  from the enemy's own mouth their own books and publications
[41:03.180 --> 41:10.860]  make no mistake this is a fact now in 1913 the private predominantly british
[41:10.860 --> 41:16.620]  owned federal reserve was set up by staging
[41:16.620 --> 41:20.460]  a decade-long media campaign where the international bankers came out
[41:20.460 --> 41:23.820]  and screamed and yelled and publicly financed against the federal reserve
[41:23.820 --> 41:27.820]  act that fooled at least enough of the public to get
[41:27.820 --> 41:30.140]  behind it but still only a minority supported it
[41:30.140 --> 41:34.220]  so they did a quorum call and had a minority of house members and senate
[41:34.220 --> 41:37.580]  members pass it
[41:37.580 --> 41:46.540]  two days before christmas in 1913
[41:46.540 --> 41:50.540]  they simultaneously got their irs which there were dozens of other
[41:50.540 --> 41:55.500]  constitutional taxes but the irs income tax was meant to be paid
[41:55.500 --> 41:59.900]  directly in to the private central banks on the debt
[41:59.900 --> 42:03.660]  on the currency they then ordered to be created in the liquidity
[42:03.660 --> 42:06.780]  and so now the superclass of banks that dominated europe
[42:06.780 --> 42:11.900]  now could start the long task of using federal regulators they controlled
[42:11.900 --> 42:15.980]  to go in and take over banks that were owned by
[42:15.980 --> 42:19.500]  separate elites and and and you know there were many other you know wealthy
[42:19.500 --> 42:21.820]  groups
[42:24.780 --> 42:28.940]  the international banks owned by a handful of families
[42:28.940 --> 42:33.900]  who had met at jekyll island right before the passage the fellow reserve
[42:33.900 --> 42:37.980]  act to get all their ducks in a row many men who publicly were enemies met in
[42:37.980 --> 42:43.740]  secret they met on jekyll island georgia
[42:43.740 --> 42:47.100]  they bought up the majority of the newspapers already owned many of them
[42:47.100 --> 42:52.140]  they bought into fledgling radio
[42:52.140 --> 42:56.700]  they began massively funding universities buying off the
[42:56.700 --> 42:59.980]  different departments creating chairs a chair meaning different
[42:59.980 --> 43:03.980]  funded departments run by people endowed by them
[43:03.980 --> 43:07.660]  they built all the new major major music halls and
[43:07.660 --> 43:12.620]  theaters with their names on them they sold the idea that they were these
[43:12.620 --> 43:15.740]  philanthropists they engineered of course right before that the
[43:15.740 --> 43:20.460]  chairman antitrust act which was really about making the old
[43:20.460 --> 43:23.580]  robber barons and select elite groups money
[43:23.580 --> 43:27.260]  safe from taxation as everyone else's money came
[43:27.260 --> 43:32.220]  under new predatory taxation rules which then were paid directly to them
[43:32.220 --> 43:37.100]  but then they advertised that as another defeat for the bankers
[43:39.180 --> 43:42.620]  all right so i've spent enough time on that
[43:42.620 --> 43:49.420]  after getting control in 1913 they then massively increased the money supply
[43:49.420 --> 43:53.260]  and issued hundreds of billions of dollars in liquidity
[43:53.260 --> 43:57.260]  not just in the united states but worldwide
[43:59.180 --> 44:02.860]  just as they have done since the mid-1990s again in this latest bubble
[44:02.860 --> 44:07.260]  this contrived bubble you see that's how financial institutions the
[44:07.260 --> 44:11.660]  the the inner bodies don't confuse a federal reserve
[44:11.660 --> 44:17.260]  shareholding cartel bank with your main street bank
[44:17.260 --> 44:20.540]  and they engage in chicanery and corruption as well but nothing compared
[44:20.540 --> 44:25.900]  to this don't confuse a local corporation that
[44:25.900 --> 44:29.900]  may even make a billion bucks a year with the elite
[44:29.900 --> 44:36.620]  the true elite own shares in the central banks that run the nations and they
[44:36.620 --> 44:41.980]  can issue themselves unlimited liquidity to buy up real assets
[44:41.980 --> 44:45.580]  and so now you've had the amazing vertical integration
[44:45.580 --> 44:52.940]  of the wealth consolidated top down
[44:55.980 --> 44:59.900]  so after 1913 they issue hundreds of billions of liquidity
[44:59.900 --> 45:04.620]  and then in 1929 they shut the spicket off put out a bunch of news articles
[45:04.620 --> 45:08.780]  of their newspapers about all these poor people and people that
[45:08.780 --> 45:12.220]  you know and shoe shine boys investing on the stock market and how they'd gotten
[45:12.220 --> 45:16.460]  greedy and how they lied on loan applications
[45:16.460 --> 45:22.140]  and how there was too much credit and that uh... that it was top heavy
[45:22.140 --> 45:26.780]  and that the american people had gotten you know to be partied too much and and
[45:26.780 --> 45:32.220]  and the flappers and had started having sex and it become decadent
[45:32.220 --> 45:36.140]  and women were smoking cigarettes again they advertise this to you know to get
[45:36.140 --> 45:38.940]  the christians real mad and then and then to have the church and say yes
[45:38.940 --> 45:42.140]  yes we're bad we know we're being judged
[45:42.140 --> 45:45.020]  to get of course the quote do good or is all into
[45:45.020 --> 45:49.180]  knitting and running around and they just cut the the currency off they
[45:49.180 --> 45:55.500]  they cut the liquidity off while everyone was overextended and and living on
[45:57.900 --> 46:05.180]  15 plus years of super cheap credit issued to anybody
[46:05.180 --> 46:09.340]  and so then that infected the stock market and infected other corporations
[46:09.340 --> 46:13.900]  and they just cut the spicket off
[46:13.900 --> 46:18.380]  and for a decade
[46:18.380 --> 46:21.100]  for a decade
[46:21.100 --> 46:25.340]  they made alcohol illegal which tripled alcoholism that allowed federalization
[46:25.340 --> 46:29.180]  of police that allowed the corruption of police
[46:29.180 --> 46:33.420]  the big banks and the mafia groups had secretly and that's come out
[46:33.420 --> 46:38.300]  lobby for prohibition knowing that only criminal combines
[46:38.300 --> 46:41.500]  could bring in the liquor could make the liquor
[46:41.500 --> 46:47.020]  and so a glass of beer went up in price about 500 percent
[46:47.020 --> 46:52.220]  a shot of whiskey went up about 500 fabulous
[46:53.420 --> 46:57.020]  fortunes were made
[46:58.780 --> 47:02.220]  so they use black markets to bring down the nation to corrupt the police
[47:02.220 --> 47:06.700]  as they'd done just 60 years before in
[47:06.700 --> 47:10.940]  china bringing in opium where it always been illegal
[47:10.940 --> 47:14.460]  british trips u.s intelligence this is all historical fact
[47:14.460 --> 47:18.540]  bringing in the opium using it to corrupt the police
[47:18.540 --> 47:22.300]  using it to then get them under their control to break the country in 10 parts
[47:22.300 --> 47:27.020]  and hands different parts of europe and the united states
[47:27.020 --> 47:31.500]  through a drug war they are masters of the black markets they bring in the black
[47:31.500 --> 47:34.540]  markets same thing here
[47:35.900 --> 47:41.260]  and then of course just to abbreviate things the bottom line of the article
[47:41.260 --> 47:46.780]  we're doing needs to state that this is engineered and why
[47:46.780 --> 47:49.980]  it's important to understand it's engineered because the more we give
[47:49.980 --> 47:52.700]  into these bankers the worst things are going to get
[47:52.700 --> 47:56.700]  people ask how far they will push as far as we let them that's how far
[47:56.700 --> 48:01.100]  tyrants always push they don't stop it's their nature to
[48:01.100 --> 48:04.460]  dominate they enjoy total control they openly
[48:04.460 --> 48:07.900]  hate the middle class and you having any wealth they're not your friends you
[48:07.900 --> 48:11.020]  understand that they're ruthless beyond imagination
[48:11.020 --> 48:15.900]  they're diabolically keen and focused on total domination
[48:15.900 --> 48:21.500]  and the greatest form of domination is of course extermination
[48:23.420 --> 48:26.940]  we look at how humans have behaved over and over again throughout civilization
[48:26.940 --> 48:30.780]  the Babylonians will move into an area and kill everybody the Israelis would
[48:30.780 --> 48:34.460]  move into an area kill everybody the Romans will move into an area and if
[48:34.460 --> 48:37.260]  anyone resisted them they would kill everybody
[48:37.260 --> 48:42.300]  the Aztecs the same thing that would go around exterminating every other tribe
[48:42.300 --> 48:49.020]  full spectrum dominance how do we know we won we killed them all
[48:49.020 --> 48:52.940]  and evil elites love blood and death and gladiatorial events and thousands
[48:52.940 --> 48:56.860]  crucified every day and people being boiled and oiled having their skin
[48:56.860 --> 49:01.660]  flayed the evil rises to the top in a society where the good don't combine
[49:01.660 --> 49:04.060]  forces together and follow a bill of rights and
[49:04.060 --> 49:06.860]  constitution and constantly guard against tyranny
[49:06.860 --> 49:10.700]  and even if you do that you normally fall to it but they convinced the
[49:10.700 --> 49:14.780]  american people that evil didn't exist in government
[49:14.780 --> 49:17.260]  all right i said i'm going to your calls i need to break down
[49:17.260 --> 49:20.460]  currently what's happening this is so important this this testament is
[49:20.460 --> 49:23.660]  important for people to understand
[49:23.660 --> 49:28.460]  so they engineer the crash in 29
[49:28.460 --> 49:33.500]  the stock market rollercoasters for a year then settles in
[49:33.500 --> 49:38.140]  devalued by around 90 percent but that wasn't the bigger issue
[49:38.140 --> 49:41.980]  then the banks as they went under were gobbled up by larger private banks that
[49:41.980 --> 49:45.980]  were federal reserve held and they would come out and call in the entire
[49:45.980 --> 49:49.900]  loan on a farm or ranch a house even if people were paying it
[49:49.900 --> 49:55.260]  even if they had money and and in kentucky and in texas and in kansas
[49:55.260 --> 50:00.060]  and in illinois and in colorado everywhere
[50:00.060 --> 50:04.540]  hundreds of times in kentucky hundreds of times in colorado
[50:04.540 --> 50:10.220]  hundreds of times in the decodas hundreds of times in california
[50:11.820 --> 50:15.260]  army tanks would pull up
[50:15.260 --> 50:21.020]  men would ride in on horseback and they would just kill everyone
[50:21.020 --> 50:24.780]  there were huge battles and martial law
[50:24.780 --> 50:28.860]  all over the united states
[50:30.780 --> 50:34.620]  strikers would be mowed down by pinkerton security
[50:34.620 --> 50:38.780]  in new jersey just whole people would march with their children they would
[50:38.780 --> 50:43.100]  just mow them down with machine guns in the streets if veterans protested
[50:43.100 --> 50:46.220]  they would move in with tanks and machine guns and slaughter hundreds on the
[50:46.220 --> 50:50.380]  spot but the bankers on the newspaper so you
[50:50.380 --> 50:53.900]  don't know about it today we're going to talk about
[50:53.900 --> 50:56.940]  the rest of their history and then currently what they're doing when we

[1:08:15.260 --> 1:08:21.420]  the stock market is plunged by 550 points
[1:08:22.060 --> 1:08:26.620]  this is all engineered your calls are coming up
[1:08:26.940 --> 1:08:30.540]  in the big article we're doing trying to cover all the facets it's key to point
[1:08:30.540 --> 1:08:38.220]  out this was financial terrorism just like 9-11 was
[1:08:38.220 --> 1:08:41.260]  physical terrorism
[1:08:42.220 --> 1:08:45.740]  this is terrorism ladies and gentlemen to have the president
[1:08:45.740 --> 1:08:48.620]  the secretary of the treasury the democratic and republican leaders of
[1:08:48.620 --> 1:08:53.420]  the house and senate nancy polosi harry reid all of them
[1:08:53.420 --> 1:09:01.900]  come out and say that if
[1:09:01.900 --> 1:09:04.940]  oh it's just it's so horrible to see this happening i'm on i'm speechless
[1:09:04.940 --> 1:09:09.420]  right now come out and say that if you don't give
[1:09:09.420 --> 1:09:12.860]  us this bailout provision which is a banker takeover bill
[1:09:12.860 --> 1:09:16.940]  with immunity power to take over any banks financial
[1:09:16.940 --> 1:09:23.340]  institutions by any financial securities derivatives of any foreign bank
[1:09:23.340 --> 1:09:29.100]  it is a complete looting it is a tick that weighs 500 pounds
[1:09:29.100 --> 1:09:32.940]  sucking the last bit of blood out of a three pound shawawa
[1:09:32.940 --> 1:09:36.780]  and by the way that is not an exaggeration if you have
[1:09:36.780 --> 1:09:42.060]  over a thousand trillion over a quadrillion in derivatives
[1:09:42.060 --> 1:09:46.380]  and they can this giant tick that weighed
[1:09:46.380 --> 1:09:50.060]  i mean that's hundreds of times the real market and the real assets in the
[1:09:50.060 --> 1:09:54.780]  world just made up fiat a tsunami of cash they bought
[1:09:54.780 --> 1:09:58.460]  up everything they could with they deindustrialized this
[1:09:58.460 --> 1:10:02.700]  with a chinese model by leveraged slave goods that no one could compete with
[1:10:02.700 --> 1:10:08.540]  while they piled more regulations and controls and taxes on western factories
[1:10:08.540 --> 1:10:12.940]  they did everything they could to debase it's a mercantile system of controlling
[1:10:12.940 --> 1:10:17.900]  countries through trade by not letting any country be independent
[1:10:17.900 --> 1:10:22.780]  that's what globalism is is a neo mercantilism
[1:10:22.780 --> 1:10:25.900]  that's what globalism is is neo mercantilism and now we're going to see
[1:10:25.900 --> 1:10:28.700]  hyperstagflation
[1:10:28.780 --> 1:10:33.260]  so they did everything they could to get you in debt and so now in 2007 in
[1:10:33.260 --> 1:10:35.900]  january for the first time the country became
[1:10:35.900 --> 1:10:41.900]  negative savers we as a whole individually
[1:10:41.900 --> 1:10:45.900]  had negative savings that's when the bankers blew the trumpet
[1:10:45.900 --> 1:10:49.580]  and said okay start plunging the economy
[1:10:49.580 --> 1:10:53.180]  and we had the imf and world bank documents we came out of bilderberg
[1:10:53.180 --> 1:10:56.620]  with our spies inside and said they're going to start the implosion
[1:10:56.620 --> 1:11:00.700]  by design with the subprime mortgages a year before anybody
[1:11:00.700 --> 1:11:06.540]  was talking about that we have on the ground intelligence
[1:11:06.540 --> 1:11:10.620]  it is not revelation it is proof it is inside knowledge
[1:11:10.620 --> 1:11:15.740]  that's how we know because we told you the truth
[1:11:15.740 --> 1:11:18.780]  we've been proven right
[1:11:22.140 --> 1:11:27.340]  so we've had financial terrorism
[1:11:27.660 --> 1:11:31.500]  terrorizing the public saying there's going to be a depression
[1:11:31.500 --> 1:11:35.500]  the world's on the edge of an unabyss french leaders german leaders
[1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:39.340]  dutch leaders british leaders u.s leaders all saying the same thing
[1:11:39.340 --> 1:11:43.660]  knowing that in the past one head of state saying something half that strong
[1:11:43.660 --> 1:11:47.420]  would cause a depression because it's all built in confidence
[1:11:47.420 --> 1:11:50.460]  because it's so leveraged
[1:11:51.260 --> 1:11:55.500]  and that was their signal that they were bringing it down
[1:11:56.220 --> 1:12:00.220]  and so the congress panicked under threat of marshall law
[1:12:00.220 --> 1:12:04.140]  last friday that's a key point congressman on the record on this show
[1:12:04.140 --> 1:12:07.180]  not just c-span saying yes we were threatened with marshall law in blood
[1:12:07.180 --> 1:12:13.900]  in the streets if we didn't do this
[1:12:16.540 --> 1:12:19.660]  and so now they've been given these dictatorial powers
[1:12:19.660 --> 1:12:24.140]  these powers of immunity for a select cadre of banks
[1:12:24.140 --> 1:12:28.380]  to take over what's left of the real economy with all their fiat currency
[1:12:28.380 --> 1:12:32.140]  because some groups wouldn't sell some companies wouldn't sell
[1:12:32.140 --> 1:12:35.820]  some financial institutions wouldn't sell well now they'll be forced to
[1:12:35.820 --> 1:12:39.980]  now the regulators are coming with a wall of our money behind them
[1:12:39.980 --> 1:12:45.660]  which will then cause hyperinflation with an implosion in the real economy
[1:12:45.660 --> 1:12:52.540]  hyper stag stagnation hyper stagnation inflation
[1:12:53.740 --> 1:12:59.980]  you could call it super stagflation you could call it economic armageddon
[1:12:59.980 --> 1:13:04.940]  and make no mistake this is a military style attack this is run with
[1:13:04.940 --> 1:13:08.700]  military precision
[1:13:11.340 --> 1:13:16.060]  they are engineering the implosion of our economy and the world economy and
[1:13:16.060 --> 1:13:19.500]  we told you 10 years ago and nine years ago and
[1:13:19.500 --> 1:13:23.420]  five years ago and a year ago and a month ago that when they did this they
[1:13:23.420 --> 1:13:27.340]  would come out and all the major financial publications and say
[1:13:27.340 --> 1:13:31.500]  it's the people's fault it's minorities fault
[1:13:31.500 --> 1:13:35.500]  they went and got mortgages they shouldn't have when the media crammed
[1:13:35.500 --> 1:13:38.140]  down their throat when that's a very small part of all this that's about
[1:13:38.140 --> 1:13:41.180]  blaming on the public and making us think in the fake history that it's our
[1:13:41.180 --> 1:13:44.620]  fault and playing into some of racist
[1:13:44.620 --> 1:13:48.220]  america well they love it on talk radio and on
[1:13:48.220 --> 1:13:52.860]  newspapers that it was the minorities that did it give me a break
[1:13:52.860 --> 1:13:56.300]  give me a break
[1:13:57.580 --> 1:14:00.140]  and what's left of the middle class loves feeling elitist and
[1:14:00.140 --> 1:14:04.140]  oh this was all caused by them oh i love bernacke i love bush i love
[1:14:04.140 --> 1:14:07.500]  paleon i love barack obama
[1:14:12.300 --> 1:14:16.300]  and so now we have to educate the public on how this was engineered
[1:14:16.300 --> 1:14:19.900]  like our lives and future depend on it because they're going to demand more
[1:14:19.900 --> 1:14:22.780]  and more money more and more power the bailout plan according to boomburg and
[1:14:22.780 --> 1:14:26.780]  other publications is really five trillion and that's just a start and we
[1:14:26.780 --> 1:14:30.380]  need to explain to the public why milk and eggs and cars and fuel
[1:14:30.380 --> 1:14:33.180]  and housing
[1:14:34.140 --> 1:14:39.020]  and everything else is going to go up because for a time you're going to see
[1:14:39.020 --> 1:14:42.300]  housing go down but in a year or so it's going to spike right back up with
[1:14:42.300 --> 1:14:46.300]  hyperinflation there were a few things that were over
[1:14:46.300 --> 1:14:50.780]  extended in price because of the bubble and speculation but after that implodes
[1:14:50.780 --> 1:14:55.260]  and then after the currency is devalued the price of necessities is going to
[1:14:55.260 --> 1:14:57.820]  skyrocket
[1:14:59.260 --> 1:15:02.700]  may take two years for real estate or three years to rebound but it will
[1:15:02.700 --> 1:15:05.980]  but it won't matter because people won't have the jobs to have the fiat
[1:15:05.980 --> 1:15:09.020]  currency see main street will be dead and so
[1:15:09.020 --> 1:15:13.500]  no one will be able to even get a hold of the fiat currency
[1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:18.700]  and then comes the federalization then comes when the welfare checks aren't
[1:15:18.700 --> 1:15:22.380]  big enough to buy the milk and eggs and koolaid
[1:15:22.380 --> 1:15:25.260]  and the rest of it
[1:15:26.860 --> 1:15:32.780]  then the market will basically be a shadow of its former self
[1:15:32.780 --> 1:15:36.060]  you will have food riots you will have more and more homeless the number of
[1:15:36.060 --> 1:15:40.380]  homeless is more than triple according to numbers coming out of different states
[1:15:40.380 --> 1:15:44.300]  texas california nevada new york michigan
[1:15:44.300 --> 1:15:49.260]  florida the states are now going to go bankrupt florida california michigan
[1:15:49.260 --> 1:15:52.860]  texas all fifty are going to go bankrupt by design
[1:15:52.860 --> 1:15:56.460]  they were put into an economic model by the feds and by the private banks
[1:15:56.460 --> 1:16:00.220]  where they couldn't pay for it all the three million cops and the welfare
[1:16:00.220 --> 1:16:06.700]  and all the illegal aliens and the corporate welfare
[1:16:07.340 --> 1:16:10.060]  and so that
[1:16:10.460 --> 1:16:18.380]  will worsen things and then you'll have riots a riot in la a riot in detroit
[1:16:18.380 --> 1:16:23.260]  you'll have a riot in new york and the police will go out with sound cannons
[1:16:23.260 --> 1:16:27.100]  microwave guns backed up by trips they will route it they will show you
[1:16:27.100 --> 1:16:31.020]  horrible you know criminal types looting
[1:16:31.020 --> 1:16:34.620]  electronic stores and then instantly that will sell
[1:16:34.620 --> 1:16:38.780]  thank god for the u.s army they had to shoot a bunch of people but it was
[1:16:38.780 --> 1:16:42.140]  needed and you'll have a black president probably so it's okay that
[1:16:42.140 --> 1:16:45.900]  they'll be mowing down poor whites poor blacks and hispanics
[1:16:45.900 --> 1:16:48.780]  and he'll be telling you it's got to be done giving a left cover
[1:16:48.780 --> 1:16:52.780]  that tar please write on looks like that's how it's shaping up regardless
[1:16:52.780 --> 1:16:56.780]  mccain will do the same thing and mccain gets in then and a bunch of blacks get
[1:16:56.780 --> 1:16:59.660]  killed and illegal aliens get killed and whites get killed
[1:16:59.660 --> 1:17:05.340]  then you'll see even more riots that plays into what they want that way
[1:17:05.340 --> 1:17:12.300]  and so the middle class code word for white america but there's a lot of blacks
[1:17:12.300 --> 1:17:15.580]  and hispanics and asians in the middle class a lot of hard working smart
[1:17:15.580 --> 1:17:18.860]  people they will go to the system and beg them
[1:17:18.860 --> 1:17:22.700]  for the military beg them for troops on the streets you know people keep
[1:17:22.700 --> 1:17:25.580]  thinking on these websites and forums they're all saying how much owns is
[1:17:25.580 --> 1:17:29.260]  right all it shows is right get ready for war lock and load this is it
[1:17:29.260 --> 1:17:34.380]  combat with the u.s army you're not listening to what i said
[1:17:34.380 --> 1:17:38.140]  the globalist will give you a scenario where you beg for it and they've already
[1:17:38.140 --> 1:17:40.940]  got yuppies and people saying okay they're getting ready for martial law but
[1:17:40.940 --> 1:17:44.380]  we need it because you know things are going to implode so the army's getting
[1:17:44.380 --> 1:17:48.300]  ready yeah they got ready 20 years ago they covertly paid off your local
[1:17:48.300 --> 1:17:51.740]  politicians 20 years ago they covertly put cia in your local
[1:17:51.740 --> 1:17:55.420]  cities 30 years ago they built fema camps covertly
[1:17:55.420 --> 1:17:58.300]  25 years ago
[1:18:00.380 --> 1:18:04.620]  so see they were geared up and ready for all of this
[1:18:04.620 --> 1:18:08.140]  and have been training the military and they're just now telling the public
[1:18:08.140 --> 1:18:11.580]  oh don't worry police train for riot scenarios
[1:18:11.580 --> 1:18:15.340]  vbc police officers from forces across south wales are receiving training
[1:18:15.340 --> 1:18:18.700]  prepare for riots police horses dogs and helicopter will be
[1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:22.300]  used to add realism during a two-day course at
[1:18:22.300 --> 1:18:26.700]  morton in marsh fire college gloss to shire some officers will take on the
[1:18:26.700 --> 1:18:29.740]  role of hostile crowds and real-life scenarios such as
[1:18:29.740 --> 1:18:33.740]  demonstrations and disorder missiles and
[1:18:33.740 --> 1:18:37.100]  but petrol bombs will be thrown as part of the training
[1:18:37.100 --> 1:18:40.060]  that also gives the image that the citizens are going to be throwing
[1:18:40.060 --> 1:18:44.860]  firebombs at police which then sells the image that the citizens are bad see
[1:18:44.860 --> 1:18:47.980]  that gives them preparatory images for the news officers attending the training
[1:18:47.980 --> 1:18:51.420]  will come from glossary shire dorset wilshire avon
[1:18:51.420 --> 1:18:57.260]  somerset devon cornwall and tabularies and it goes on and on
[1:18:57.260 --> 1:19:01.820]  now here's cnn last night

[1:21:17.740 --> 1:21:21.340]  where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary responsibility

[1:27:34.060 --> 1:27:37.580]  you know do i go buy a gun you know do i get a crew together
[1:27:37.580 --> 1:27:42.060]  but you know you don't own a gun you don't own a gun no sir
[1:27:42.060 --> 1:27:46.140]  well i i don't want to kill anybody i don't want to shoot anybody
[1:27:46.140 --> 1:27:49.500]  well it's because but let me ask you a question who comes first
[1:27:49.500 --> 1:27:52.940]  how are you going to protect your your your children from a pack of thugs
[1:27:52.940 --> 1:27:56.140]  well that's why i'm asking do i need to go out and get a gun see it's so alien to
[1:27:56.140 --> 1:28:00.700]  me because i'm the stock of uh i come from uh
[1:28:00.700 --> 1:28:06.140]  you know rebel stock uh and i know most americans do i come from frontier stock
[1:28:06.140 --> 1:28:10.220]  and so i'm a shadow of those men and women who who they were
[1:28:10.220 --> 1:28:14.220]  i mean it's just you know i was shooting a four tim and i was four years old
[1:28:14.220 --> 1:28:17.340]  and still the children around here in texas
[1:28:17.340 --> 1:28:21.980]  me on mainstream children uh you know i know a lobbyist lives down the street
[1:28:21.980 --> 1:28:25.580]  from me and you know he takes his son out shooting the shotgun or we go out and
[1:28:25.580 --> 1:28:30.060]  shoot the shotguns together you know one day it's baseball next day it's shotguns
[1:28:30.060 --> 1:28:33.820]  and then i see full grown adults who never taught that great birthright
[1:28:33.820 --> 1:28:37.660]  of the weapon yes you need to go out and get a
[1:28:37.660 --> 1:28:42.060]  um you go out and get a revolver first because it's safe
[1:28:42.060 --> 1:28:46.540]  take some local lessons this week but don't talk about what it's for
[1:28:46.540 --> 1:28:49.580]  uh shooting center of mass at only about 20 feet you need to be able to shoot
[1:28:49.580 --> 1:28:53.020]  somebody at 20 feet center of mass in the chest
[1:28:53.020 --> 1:28:58.460]  um or in the head of needy or you can always go for the legs
[1:28:58.460 --> 1:29:04.060]  um but uh well the key is well i'm not going to get into it
[1:29:04.060 --> 1:29:07.740]  point is if you're dealing with mercenary forces
[1:29:07.740 --> 1:29:10.620]  it's very easy just to walk up to somebody and stick the revolver right
[1:29:10.620 --> 1:29:13.340]  up underneath their arm but i'm not going to get in i'm not going to even
[1:29:13.340 --> 1:29:18.620]  start getting into that anything else no sir thank you
[1:29:18.620 --> 1:29:24.140]  thank you i'm not trying to be mean to you man listen it's not that we pet guns
[1:29:24.140 --> 1:29:27.820]  and oil them and then it's an extension of us it is a man
[1:29:27.820 --> 1:29:33.100]  a free man has weapons slaves don't have weapons

[1:29:43.100 --> 1:29:46.140]  scary you need to learn how to use them and if you
[1:29:46.140 --> 1:29:51.340]  point them at somebody you need to pull the trigger

[1:35:03.660 --> 1:35:09.020]  the sterilization they've already been under the attack for a long time
[1:35:09.020 --> 1:35:15.100]  the new world order has taken their time to set the trap here in the west
[1:35:15.100 --> 1:35:19.100]  bring down the mighty people
[1:35:19.100 --> 1:35:22.620]  but they've miscalculated and there's more resistance than they bargained for
[1:35:22.620 --> 1:35:26.140]  forming
[1:35:26.140 --> 1:35:28.300]  all right i'm gonna hurry through your calls now because i want to get back
[1:35:28.300 --> 1:35:31.180]  into what they're going to do in the future now we've talked about how they
[1:35:31.180 --> 1:35:34.300]  engineered it how they carried it out now what are they going to do next
[1:35:34.300 --> 1:35:37.260]  now let's move quickly here chuck in Illinois then jessie scott jessie and
[1:35:37.260 --> 1:35:40.300]  will go ahead you're on the air chuck
[1:35:40.300 --> 1:35:44.220]  i already went to chuck again we went oh jared hung up jessie in wisconsin
[1:35:44.220 --> 1:35:49.020]  hey i'm here go ahead uh yeah i'm glad you're having david ick on the program
[1:35:49.020 --> 1:35:52.220]  today i've got some a couple things i just wanted to mention to you
[1:35:52.220 --> 1:35:55.740]  um i'm from madison wisconsin the first thing on the list is an advisory to
[1:35:55.740 --> 1:35:59.260]  everybody in in madison if they can make it to the university of wisconsin
[1:35:59.260 --> 1:36:03.980]  october 9th erin or eric rosengren of the boston federal reserve bank will be
[1:36:03.980 --> 1:36:08.060]  there speaking to students um i'm not really sure about what but it's
[1:36:08.060 --> 1:36:11.820]  probably probably just him trying to sell his ideas on the eventual takeover
[1:36:11.820 --> 1:36:14.620]  to you at the time they're doing that the bankers are out everywhere selling
[1:36:14.620 --> 1:36:18.700]  their lives at every event oh yeah i i do not doubt it but
[1:36:18.700 --> 1:36:21.820]  what i'd like to do is just get anybody involved if you're in chicago if you're
[1:36:21.820 --> 1:36:25.100]  in minneapolis just drop down october 9th at four o'clock
[1:36:25.100 --> 1:36:29.020]  he'll be at the uh ingram building uh with room 10b
[1:36:29.020 --> 1:36:31.900]  forty one of the new order talks about this they talk about
[1:36:31.900 --> 1:36:34.700]  he works hard for us he's a good guy when they talk about their different
[1:36:34.700 --> 1:36:38.860]  minions and uh and then they've admitted they're everywhere selling their take
[1:36:38.860 --> 1:36:43.580]  over everybody they are yeah they're selling it um on a personal note my
[1:36:43.580 --> 1:36:47.500]  neighbor's backyard or my sorry my parents backyard neighbor he's lost his
[1:36:47.500 --> 1:36:50.460]  retirement basically have to work with 75 years old
[1:36:50.460 --> 1:36:55.100]  um that that really hits home you know and they told him if you'll just go for
[1:36:55.100 --> 1:36:57.980]  the bailout your retirement will be okay and then they will drop the hammer as
[1:36:57.980 --> 1:37:01.660]  soon as they had the power oh yeah and it's been going on for a long time no
[1:37:01.660 --> 1:37:05.100]  my uncle jack who's actually my grandfather's brother he was ahead of
[1:37:05.100 --> 1:37:09.900]  security at the treasury building and he knew that their whole fiat currency
[1:37:09.900 --> 1:37:13.660]  when they switched over from that in 30s was a farce and what he did his whole
[1:37:13.660 --> 1:37:17.180]  life is every time he got a paycheck he'd put it into commodities like copper
[1:37:17.180 --> 1:37:20.220]  and tin and things like that so he's actually doing very well for himself
[1:37:20.220 --> 1:37:23.980]  right now because everything he has is actually backed up by a physical
[1:37:23.980 --> 1:37:28.060]  precious metal instead of a bunch of currency digital numbers made out of a
[1:37:28.060 --> 1:37:33.900]  light that it worth nothing um so i think what at this time what i'd
[1:37:33.900 --> 1:37:36.620]  recommend for a lot of your listeners is what you've been doing too is just
[1:37:36.620 --> 1:37:38.940]  invest in anything you can get your hands on
[1:37:38.940 --> 1:37:43.260]  that's uh a value whether it's tools whether it's machinery that people are
[1:37:43.260 --> 1:37:46.700]  going to need to dig people out of fires or whatever folks don't have money to
[1:37:46.700 --> 1:37:50.380]  invest but yes folks should get some food firearms
[1:37:50.380 --> 1:37:54.300]  uh but not get all paranoid and crazy and start jumping in shadows be be open
[1:37:54.300 --> 1:37:57.660]  be strong be leaders i appreciate your call jesse
[1:37:57.660 --> 1:38:02.940]  scott in arizona you're on the air hey alex uh i just wanted to call and say
[1:38:02.940 --> 1:38:06.940]  that uh yeah man you're right on on on everything and how it's all coming down
[1:38:06.940 --> 1:38:10.140]  but i wanted to tell you this um i looked on steve's quilt side over the
[1:38:10.140 --> 1:38:14.060]  weekend he's got some work out on bank runs i'm at bank runs but bank holidays
[1:38:14.060 --> 1:38:17.500]  and then another thing he he had on there is about a web bot
[1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:21.180]  and how they predicted a lot of things even though i'm a christian i don't
[1:38:21.180 --> 1:38:23.580]  believe in all that but their predictions have been pretty right on
[1:38:23.580 --> 1:38:26.860]  they say tomorrow is a big day they said that they've been good
[1:38:26.860 --> 1:38:30.380]  this prediction for a long time and they said the precursor was uh
[1:38:30.380 --> 1:38:33.420]  september 22nd through the 28th what would be
[1:38:33.420 --> 1:38:37.900]  the event that would take place tomorrow so i'm kind of curious to see if that's
[1:38:37.900 --> 1:38:41.340]  going to come true but it kind of seems like it's set it up today
[1:38:41.340 --> 1:38:44.620]  well for those that don't know what web bot is it's a private consortium that
[1:38:44.620 --> 1:38:47.980]  does what the nsa does it goes around and sees what the buzz is
[1:38:47.980 --> 1:38:51.660]  and it's picking up people in message rooms and chat rooms
[1:38:51.660 --> 1:38:55.500]  and everywhere saying bank run bank run economy implosion
[1:38:55.500 --> 1:38:59.580]  it isn't much of a prediction to say while the stock market's dropping
[1:38:59.580 --> 1:39:02.940]  you know thousands of points to come out and say
[1:39:02.940 --> 1:39:11.260]  oh guess what the economy might you know go down a whole bunch
[1:39:11.260 --> 1:39:15.980]  or there might be bank runs or there might be a major economic crises while
[1:39:15.980 --> 1:39:20.140]  the president and the elite are out bad mouthing the economy to drive it down
[1:39:20.140 --> 1:39:23.420]  by design so they can consolidate it i appreciate your call
[1:39:23.420 --> 1:39:28.060]  let's go ahead and talk to who's next
[1:39:28.060 --> 1:39:31.500]  jessie in seattle you're on the air hey alex how's it going
[1:39:31.500 --> 1:39:35.260]  good yeah i was curious have you ever heard of a guy named jim willey
[1:39:35.260 --> 1:39:40.780]  he's a market analyst no he's pretty good and i've been hearing him talk maybe
[1:39:40.780 --> 1:39:43.180]  you could talk a little bit too because i'm not too familiar with a lot of the
[1:39:43.180 --> 1:39:47.500]  details but he was talking a lot about how um i believe
[1:39:47.500 --> 1:39:51.820]  fanny may had about 1.5 trillion in fraud uh that
[1:39:51.820 --> 1:39:56.380]  it was just missing from its books and also talked about how aig before they
[1:39:56.380 --> 1:40:00.300]  got the loan from the government that actually got an offer from a couple of
[1:40:00.300 --> 1:40:03.660]  german banks but the offer was blocked by the government
[1:40:03.660 --> 1:40:07.500]  and he his whole theory is that uh there's a lot of fraud and there's a lot
[1:40:07.500 --> 1:40:11.020]  of systemic fraud that's not a theory it's a fact that none of the banks that
[1:40:11.020 --> 1:40:14.860]  the private big fell reserve banks will show their books to any government
[1:40:14.860 --> 1:40:18.060]  no they're telling the government they've got it but backwards
[1:40:18.060 --> 1:40:21.820]  they are demanding the government be handed over to them a governmental power
[1:40:21.820 --> 1:40:25.340]  be handed over to them and so now they're doing this but of course sir
[1:40:25.340 --> 1:40:29.100]  there was upwards of 2 trillion missing in the weeks before 9 11
[1:40:29.100 --> 1:40:32.220]  from the pentagon trust funds and investments and pensions
[1:40:32.220 --> 1:40:34.860]  that was in the associated press in oregonian
[1:40:34.860 --> 1:40:38.700]  uh it's all it's over 4 trillion now according to congressional testimony
[1:40:38.700 --> 1:40:43.420]  and the pentagon rumsfeld and others back when they testified two years ago
[1:40:43.420 --> 1:40:46.540]  actually laughed with general mires as well
[1:40:46.540 --> 1:40:50.700]  laughed at the congress people asking about it and said we're just not going
[1:40:50.700 --> 1:40:54.940]  to tell you that's what it's about the military and the police don't know it
[1:40:54.940 --> 1:41:00.300]  but they're there to guard the bank robbers taking everything offshore
[1:41:00.300 --> 1:41:04.220]  that's what it's looking like for sure no no that's it that's what it is sir
[1:41:04.220 --> 1:41:08.380]  when they put 4 trillion dollars and an idiot's email me and say
[1:41:08.380 --> 1:41:11.820]  the the defense budget's only a trillion bucks a year
[1:41:11.820 --> 1:41:15.500]  now it is you used to be 500 billion or so what do you mean how could there be
[1:41:15.500 --> 1:41:18.060]  4 trillion missing well they don't even get that in a year
[1:41:18.060 --> 1:41:22.060]  it was all the investments county cities
[1:41:22.060 --> 1:41:26.460]  water districts everybody was told in the last 50 years since they started
[1:41:26.460 --> 1:41:29.820]  doing it to invest most of the tax money in private
[1:41:29.820 --> 1:41:33.180]  funds and then they allow the mayors and others to steal part of it
[1:41:33.180 --> 1:41:38.620]  to do it it's total criminal government now they took all that real asset offshore
[1:41:38.620 --> 1:41:42.860]  then they moved derivatives and fake assets in for the portfolios of the
[1:41:42.860 --> 1:41:46.540]  cities and counties and water districts and police pension funds
[1:41:46.540 --> 1:41:51.260]  teacher pension funds retirement and the cops are going to be defending the
[1:41:51.260 --> 1:41:53.580]  system the military is going to be
[1:41:53.580 --> 1:41:57.900]  defending the system look it's just like last year the pentagon announced
[1:41:57.900 --> 1:42:01.820]  oh guess what we're no longer going to give korean vietnam world war two
[1:42:01.820 --> 1:42:04.860]  that's free health care like we always promised
[1:42:04.860 --> 1:42:08.700]  that's being taken away four years ago they changed the rules where any
[1:42:08.700 --> 1:42:11.980]  private corporation can take its employees pensions
[1:42:11.980 --> 1:42:16.380]  again they set all this up by design anything else
[1:42:16.380 --> 1:42:21.260]  oh no that was it i hope you can maybe elaborate on it but so angry yeah
[1:42:21.260 --> 1:42:27.820]  god and thank you for the call oh man i'm mad

[1:45:41.660 --> 1:45:47.580]  thousand to nine thousand seven hundred ninety six
[1:45:47.580 --> 1:45:51.020]  the just to see them doing it you know i know intellectually what they're
[1:45:51.020 --> 1:45:53.500]  doing i understand their program they're playing
[1:45:53.500 --> 1:45:56.860]  but to see them getting away with it to see them
[1:45:56.860 --> 1:46:00.140]  carrying it out to know they're taking the pension funds right now
[1:46:00.140 --> 1:46:03.100]  to know they're looting everything right now to know
[1:46:03.100 --> 1:46:06.540]  that they are taking five trillion of our tax dollars it's not eight hundred
[1:46:06.540 --> 1:46:09.740]  and fifty billion folks five trillion at least
[1:46:09.740 --> 1:46:14.060]  and then in just open crime open private banks engineered at all
[1:46:14.060 --> 1:46:17.420]  just totally writing checks on the taxpayers back to do whatever they
[1:46:17.420 --> 1:46:20.860]  want and then the and then the bbc and cnn
[1:46:20.860 --> 1:46:23.580]  reporting yeah the police and military are gearing up
[1:46:23.580 --> 1:46:27.100]  for riots over all this and then they're gonna
[1:46:27.100 --> 1:46:30.860]  carry out an economic i mean they killed the economy two weeks ago
[1:46:30.860 --> 1:46:33.260]  with the there's going to be a depression there's going to be a depression
[1:46:33.260 --> 1:46:35.820]  there's going to be a depression but we kept saying there's going to be a
[1:46:35.820 --> 1:46:37.740]  depression of these bankers don't stop this
[1:46:37.740 --> 1:46:41.340]  they're engineering it they're doing it by design once they get a banking bill
[1:46:41.340 --> 1:46:45.100]  through that gives them anonymity uh... which gives them secrecy which gives
[1:46:45.100 --> 1:46:48.460]  them immunity they're gonna drop the hammer and congress gave it to them
[1:46:48.460 --> 1:46:51.580]  and they are dropping the hammer and they'll probably pump the market back
[1:46:51.580 --> 1:46:55.260]  up again or two or three times but it's going straight down on the yearly
[1:46:55.260 --> 1:46:59.820]  graph
[1:46:59.820 --> 1:47:03.420]  now we have about one migrant a year
[1:47:04.700 --> 1:47:07.180]  and they always start in the back of my head and i'm starting to have one right
[1:47:07.180 --> 1:47:11.100]  now i'm i've got i i just can't i gotta
[1:47:11.100 --> 1:47:14.940]  got up and not get i just i just folks i know it's real i know there's the
[1:47:14.940 --> 1:47:17.260]  fema camps i know they put poison in the water
[1:47:17.260 --> 1:47:21.660]  i know the new world order is real i know they're satanist
[1:47:21.660 --> 1:47:26.540]  macy's just came out with a huge line of
[1:47:26.540 --> 1:47:30.460]  hell club six six six bohemian grove
[1:47:30.460 --> 1:47:34.780]  devil stuff i mean they're just throwing it
[1:47:34.780 --> 1:47:39.340]  in our face in everybody's face Illuminati night six six six
[1:47:39.340 --> 1:47:44.540]  you know all of this crap they are really letting everybody know
[1:47:44.540 --> 1:47:48.140]  who they are and what their agenda is
[1:47:48.140 --> 1:47:53.020]  they are pulling out all the stops
[1:47:54.620 --> 1:47:58.700]  i mean when you find out that your world leaders go to meetings where they
[1:47:58.700 --> 1:48:03.340]  bust in thousands of gay prostitutes when you find out barney frank is allowed
[1:48:03.340 --> 1:48:06.860]  to run underage male brothels with children in them
[1:48:06.860 --> 1:48:10.620]  and they didn't get in trouble when you find out that they're putting melamine
[1:48:10.620 --> 1:48:14.300]  in the food and now the FDA comes out and says it's not bad for you
[1:48:14.300 --> 1:48:19.420]  when you find out that it's so much crazier than i can even say
[1:48:19.420 --> 1:48:23.100]  that they've hired felons and illegal aliens
[1:48:23.100 --> 1:48:27.260]  by the hundreds of thousands for the armed forces
[1:48:27.980 --> 1:48:31.180]  now understand we're already under martial law financially
[1:48:31.180 --> 1:48:34.300]  you heard ron paul say that last week that are paul craig roberts
[1:48:34.300 --> 1:48:38.300]  and that's the basis of martial law and you're under martial law when the
[1:48:38.300 --> 1:48:41.900]  police taser you if you don't answer their questions or you don't jump
[1:48:41.900 --> 1:48:47.260]  fast enough when they say jump that we're under martial law
[1:48:49.100 --> 1:48:51.900]  when the private banks run the government and can grab any amount of
[1:48:51.900 --> 1:48:55.500]  public money they want and now they're physically telling you they're
[1:48:55.500 --> 1:48:59.180]  getting ready with the military people are saying oh they won't dare use the
[1:48:59.180 --> 1:49:02.060]  military against the american people they're not going to have a march out
[1:49:02.060 --> 1:49:07.500]  and go street by street on day one and start grabbing people
[1:49:07.500 --> 1:49:10.620]  political dissidents they're going to create an economic atmosphere that
[1:49:10.620 --> 1:49:14.780]  causes rioting and starving and bank runs and societal breakdown
[1:49:14.780 --> 1:49:18.940]  and then the public is going to beg for it
[1:49:18.940 --> 1:49:22.940]  then they will stabilize things they control the banking system the economy
[1:49:22.940 --> 1:49:25.420]  will be bad people will be glad cities aren't burning
[1:49:25.420 --> 1:49:28.620]  and then they're going to start the political arrest and they're going to
[1:49:28.620 --> 1:49:31.900]  tell the yuppies go along with this and your football games and everything
[1:49:31.900 --> 1:49:35.020]  will continue a schedule
[1:49:35.020 --> 1:49:43.980]  that's what's going on here so the good news is the public knows the
[1:49:43.980 --> 1:49:48.780]  congress is evil the public doesn't trust the congress
[1:49:48.780 --> 1:49:55.340]  the public is aware of the congress's criminal activities
[1:49:55.340 --> 1:50:00.220]  congress has a nine percent approval rating the public didn't want the banker
[1:50:00.220 --> 1:50:05.340]  take over bill by 90 plus percent thousands to one in the phone calls
[1:50:05.340 --> 1:50:11.180]  and so they just did it the problem is if they let rioting break out that we'll
[1:50:11.180 --> 1:50:15.340]  scare the public back into supporting whatever the central government does
[1:50:15.340 --> 1:50:22.540]  so we got to start saying arrest ben Bernanke arrest federal former chairman
[1:50:22.540 --> 1:50:26.620]  green span arrest paulson for insider trading and conflict of interest all
[1:50:26.620 --> 1:50:29.180]  these crimes we've got to say enough is enough
[1:50:29.180 --> 1:50:33.020]  arrest the criminals and that's got to be the only chance you hear
[1:50:33.020 --> 1:50:36.700]  and then the police and the military and the congress will hear you
[1:50:36.700 --> 1:50:39.820]  and they will respond they don't like it either they're scared
[1:50:39.820 --> 1:50:43.260]  congress was told martial law would be declared last week and they didn't do
[1:50:43.260 --> 1:50:46.780]  this that's on record
[1:50:48.060 --> 1:50:50.540]  and don't think you're gonna have a march on washington they would hit us
[1:50:50.540 --> 1:50:54.780]  with a neutron bomb and claim al-qaeda did it it has to be at the state level
[1:50:54.780 --> 1:50:58.700]  the county level it has to be at the grassroots and we can do it

[1:55:25.900 --> 1:55:30.380]  they did the bailout that it was going to plunge the markets
[1:55:30.380 --> 1:55:33.420]  they're feeding right now they're consolidating right now

[1:56:10.780 --> 1:56:14.060]  see two weeks ago the u.s. mint said we can't sell gold coins
[1:56:14.060 --> 1:56:17.500]  only what we've already got left and they're sold out we can't get gold
[1:56:17.500 --> 1:56:24.700]  there's such a run on gold worldwide the globalists are suppressing the price
[1:56:24.700 --> 1:56:29.340]  while the supply is run out now ladies and gentlemen
[1:56:29.340 --> 1:56:32.620]  ladies and gentlemen ted has a bunch of gold coins
[1:56:32.620 --> 1:56:35.580]  but different groups of those you only has so much of this so much of that
[1:56:35.580 --> 1:56:39.420]  so there's quite a few coins he's offering today and then he can't get
[1:56:39.420 --> 1:56:43.100]  any more of these for the foreseeable future that's what he's being told
[1:56:43.100 --> 1:56:48.140]  from all his main suppliers in europe it's already run out in the u.s.
[1:56:48.140 --> 1:56:52.140]  ted this is some amazing news you gave me tell us about it it is it's incredibly
[1:56:52.140 --> 1:56:55.660]  uh... i i can tell you right now i've never seen the market like this and i
[1:56:55.660 --> 1:56:59.180]  was in the market in nineteen eighty when jimmy carter was in office and we had
[1:56:59.180 --> 1:57:03.500]  double-digit inflation back then i can't believe that i can't get physical
[1:57:03.500 --> 1:57:06.300]  supply u.s. eagles are gone maple leaves
[1:57:06.300 --> 1:57:10.300]  you can wait through thirteen fourteen weeks to get maple leaves right now
[1:57:10.300 --> 1:57:14.140]  bars of silver out of the marketplace i mean just about anything you can mention
[1:57:14.140 --> 1:57:17.100]  they're gone uh... the things that i have right now
[1:57:17.100 --> 1:57:21.340]  believe it or not i i i can get frank's right now i've got a supply of those
[1:57:21.340 --> 1:57:24.620]  that i can fill orders with and i would really suggest that people get
[1:57:24.620 --> 1:57:29.500]  motivated with those uh... the the the franklin halves right now i've got a
[1:57:29.500 --> 1:57:33.740]  supply of franklin halves and they're currently at eight seventy a piece
[1:57:33.740 --> 1:57:37.020]  and and silver and gold have both gone up i mean i've got the stuff that the
[1:57:37.020 --> 1:57:40.220]  prices that is offered to you to the listeners last week
[1:57:40.220 --> 1:57:43.100]  when gold was lower but gold's up thirty bucks today
[1:57:43.100 --> 1:57:46.780]  and that's because i locked in on this stuff let's explain that they were
[1:57:46.780 --> 1:57:49.820]  already getting good deals last week it's up over thirty bucks today it looks
[1:57:49.820 --> 1:57:53.420]  like it's only gonna go up more as the stock market drops below ten thousand
[1:57:53.420 --> 1:57:57.340]  and nine thousand seven hundred and eighty and still dropping
[1:57:57.340 --> 1:58:01.020]  so ladies and gentlemen chad has gold coins
[1:58:01.020 --> 1:58:05.820]  at thirty bucks plus below what uh... they were selling for
[1:58:05.820 --> 1:58:08.940]  on friday and he's still offering it at that price
[1:58:08.940 --> 1:58:12.220]  how long can that deal hold to well i'm gonna hold it today and we'll watch
[1:58:12.220 --> 1:58:15.180]  tomorrow i think we better talk a little bit more about this on the other side
[1:58:15.180 --> 1:58:17.980]  because it it's just unbelievable what's happening

[2:00:42.140 --> 2:00:45.180]  cartel it's being described not by alex jones

[2:07:46.780 --> 2:07:50.300]  united states in california he had several events with more than 2000
[2:07:50.300 --> 2:07:55.580]  people showing up to just one of them and we have the same
[2:07:55.580 --> 2:07:58.780]  type thing happen we have an event 1200 2000
[2:07:58.780 --> 2:08:03.340]  show up it is just incredible and this is only being done through the
[2:08:03.340 --> 2:08:06.140]  alternative media so while we see the stock market
[2:08:06.140 --> 2:08:11.900]  plunging 600 plus points today after the bankers got their empowerment
[2:08:11.900 --> 2:08:17.260]  immunity takeover bill understand at least the good news is
[2:08:17.260 --> 2:08:19.980]  thousands to one according to members of congress
[2:08:19.980 --> 2:08:23.180]  phone calls against it last week even after the winehouse said depression
[2:08:23.180 --> 2:08:25.980]  depression and then didn't have the plunge protection
[2:08:25.980 --> 2:08:30.140]  team prop up the market last monday when it went down
[2:08:30.140 --> 2:08:33.180]  over a trillion dollars well the same things happen today after the bankers
[2:08:33.180 --> 2:08:36.380]  got their power because this is part of a consolidation and david ick is going to
[2:08:36.380 --> 2:08:38.300]  talk about that he's been writing about that for
[2:08:38.300 --> 2:08:42.220]  close to 20 years how the the main power of the new world order in the physical
[2:08:42.220 --> 2:08:45.580]  realm is their banking fraud their fractional reserve system
[2:08:45.580 --> 2:08:50.300]  but but i want to first talk the man who needs no introduction
[2:08:50.300 --> 2:08:54.060]  about the incredibly positive thing because as the enemy moves against us as
[2:08:54.060 --> 2:08:56.700]  they try to destroy the middle class and slave the people
[2:08:56.700 --> 2:08:59.660]  so they've got to go to the government for their food
[2:08:59.660 --> 2:09:03.020]  so that there can be a financial collapse riots in the streets so they can use
[2:09:03.020 --> 2:09:05.820]  the military on us as they're now announcing in mainstream news to be
[2:09:05.820 --> 2:09:10.220]  the saviors so we accept a militarized banana boat economy
[2:09:10.220 --> 2:09:14.380]  the positive news that this isn't hype when i say it
[2:09:14.380 --> 2:09:17.740]  there is an awakening so huge it dwarfs anything a month ago
[2:09:17.740 --> 2:09:20.780]  or anything a year ago it is exponential i mean here's an example
[2:09:20.780 --> 2:09:23.980]  we call up chuck norris to come on the show never tried he goes oh i'm a
[2:09:23.980 --> 2:09:26.220]  huge fan i listen all the time i want to come on
[2:09:26.220 --> 2:09:30.620]  he comes on endorses ron paul moves away from the neocons
[2:09:30.620 --> 2:09:33.820]  and says on air he agrees with everything i'm talking about
[2:09:33.820 --> 2:09:38.140]  i mean again bruce willis goes public and says i no longer a neocon i i know
[2:09:38.140 --> 2:09:41.900]  there's a new world order of false reality they're losing all their main
[2:09:41.900 --> 2:09:46.380]  icons on the left the left is waking up and breaking the paradigm and breaking
[2:09:46.380 --> 2:09:50.220]  the controlled tiny box reality and seeing the wider
[2:09:50.220 --> 2:09:54.140]  universe around them so there is a consciousness shift in information
[2:09:54.140 --> 2:09:57.580]  analysis and it is the hundredth monkey there is a group consciousness
[2:09:57.580 --> 2:10:01.900]  it is it is spreading it is happening it is a mass awareness
[2:10:01.900 --> 2:10:05.740]  and it is beautiful and so out of this adversity it's going to get bad we're
[2:10:05.740 --> 2:10:08.780]  going to be tested realize that this is evil
[2:10:08.780 --> 2:10:14.220]  trying to maintain control david ike after a very successful tour which
[2:10:14.220 --> 2:10:17.980]  thousands and thousands came out to see in california we welcome you to the
[2:10:17.980 --> 2:10:21.260]  airwaves thank you alex sir you've got the floor
[2:10:21.260 --> 2:10:24.460]  let's break down the shift what's happening the positive and then get in
[2:10:24.460 --> 2:10:28.220]  to your analysis on the banking global takeover then we'll get into the nature
[2:10:28.220 --> 2:10:31.820]  of reality itself well the thing is alex that uh you know
[2:10:31.820 --> 2:10:35.500]  i've been a kind of barometer of this because i've been doing it for so long
[2:10:35.500 --> 2:10:40.060]  and um when i started talking about these things in britain in the early 1990s
[2:10:40.060 --> 2:10:45.660]  well crucky i it was just extraordinary the scale of abuse
[2:10:45.660 --> 2:10:50.540]  and uh and ridicule that came my way but as the years have passed um
[2:10:50.540 --> 2:10:55.820]  i've seen this uh gradually change and then since 9 11
[2:10:55.820 --> 2:10:59.820]  and another shift after the invasion of iraq i've seen it explode
[2:10:59.820 --> 2:11:03.260]  and what we're seeing now is something i talked about a long time ago
[2:11:03.260 --> 2:11:09.580]  when something is uh covertly manipulating a longer road to change
[2:11:09.580 --> 2:11:14.060]  society in a certain way there comes a point where it has to break the
[2:11:14.060 --> 2:11:17.180]  surface where it can be seen because that
[2:11:17.180 --> 2:11:21.100]  which it wants to change starts to happen in front of people's eyes
[2:11:21.100 --> 2:11:25.180]  and this and what we're talking about today with the finance and everything
[2:11:25.180 --> 2:11:29.180]  is um is putting in the face of people
[2:11:29.180 --> 2:11:33.420]  what they have and i understand why what they have tried so hard to deny was
[2:11:33.420 --> 2:11:37.020]  reality and therefore they're finding it more and
[2:11:37.020 --> 2:11:40.140]  more difficult to look the other way and say no no
[2:11:40.140 --> 2:11:44.700]  let's change the subject and all this together and there's a consciousness
[2:11:44.700 --> 2:11:48.060]  awakening as well very clearly people are waking up and expanding their
[2:11:48.060 --> 2:11:52.460]  consciousness on a scale never before in in in a time that i've known
[2:11:52.460 --> 2:11:57.180]  anyway and uh together it's bringing uh people to a
[2:11:57.180 --> 2:12:02.700]  state of awareness where they are seeing what is actually happening now we
[2:12:02.700 --> 2:12:06.540]  need to go to the next stage now people are coming out listening to this
[2:12:06.540 --> 2:12:09.820]  information in vast numbers they're listening to programs like yours
[2:12:09.820 --> 2:12:13.900]  in vast numbers what we need to do now you start to get together
[2:12:13.900 --> 2:12:18.620]  drop the fault lines between left and right and center and progressives and
[2:12:18.620 --> 2:12:22.060]  all this other stuff and religion all the rest of it and come together
[2:12:22.060 --> 2:12:26.220]  and cross the street and start engaging um with this system
[2:12:26.220 --> 2:12:30.460]  and and and by engaging ironically i mean disengaging with it
[2:12:30.460 --> 2:12:35.260]  ceasing to allow it to enslave us ceasing to cooperate with our own
[2:12:35.260 --> 2:12:39.260]  enslavement because as i talked about uh last time was on the show
[2:12:39.260 --> 2:12:44.380]  there are six billion people plus now being manipulated there is at the core
[2:12:44.380 --> 2:12:48.060]  a relative handful doing the manipulating i see a way out of this
[2:12:48.060 --> 2:12:53.180]  but we have to come together and it's starting and i'm extremely optimistic
[2:12:53.180 --> 2:12:56.380]  because now we're in this window of time
[2:12:56.380 --> 2:13:01.180]  where the problem is there blatantly in front of us
[2:13:01.180 --> 2:13:04.300]  the game is more and more blatantly in front of us
[2:13:04.300 --> 2:13:08.380]  and that is engaging and focusing people to the understanding
[2:13:08.380 --> 2:13:12.220]  that doing nothing is no longer an option it's a great time of opportunity
[2:13:12.220 --> 2:13:16.140]  that and they only are able to control us by
[2:13:16.140 --> 2:13:19.340]  us ourselves keeping ourselves in that box
[2:13:19.340 --> 2:13:24.140]  in in in in self regulating to where we're afraid to speak up or afraid to
[2:13:24.140 --> 2:13:26.300]  talk to neighbors and so we just go and watch
[2:13:26.300 --> 2:13:31.100]  the television uh but again that is starting to break up that is starting
[2:13:31.100 --> 2:13:34.860]  that is starting to shift and it's so beautiful to see but before we get into
[2:13:34.860 --> 2:13:37.980]  the you know larger shifts in society and how there's only
[2:13:37.980 --> 2:13:41.900]  probably less than a hundred global masterminds a few thousand technicians
[2:13:41.900 --> 2:13:46.940]  under them who really get the full uh structure of the new world order
[2:13:46.940 --> 2:13:51.420]  there are tens of millions worldwide who have organically reverse engineered
[2:13:51.420 --> 2:13:54.380]  what they're doing to an stunning level we're able
[2:13:54.380 --> 2:13:58.220]  to predict what they're going to do and that's really starting to threaten
[2:13:58.220 --> 2:14:01.100]  them and that's why they're talking about bringing in
[2:14:01.100 --> 2:14:03.660]  total dictatorial martial law to try to suppress it
[2:14:03.660 --> 2:14:06.460]  i see that act of desperation as a huge failure
[2:14:06.460 --> 2:14:11.100]  but let's get into the economics first and break down what we're seeing
[2:14:11.100 --> 2:14:14.940]  with the banker takeover how they're proposing a world banking system
[2:14:14.940 --> 2:14:20.940]  out of the crisis they created well uh and i've i've heard um i've not
[2:14:20.940 --> 2:14:24.860]  been so focused on everything i've been traveling and moving constantly for
[2:14:24.860 --> 2:14:31.100]  uh about 10 days two weeks but um i have heard the the idea that this
[2:14:31.100 --> 2:14:35.580]  banking crisis is is like bad for the bankers and is that not what they
[2:14:35.580 --> 2:14:39.420]  wanted we've got to understand uh a few things
[2:14:39.420 --> 2:14:43.500]  first of all the people who are manipulating the banking system
[2:14:43.500 --> 2:14:48.060]  do not own just the banks they own the game they own the system
[2:14:48.060 --> 2:14:53.340]  now if you own football it doesn't matter if one team beats another team or
[2:14:53.340 --> 2:14:57.340]  another team beats the other team because you own the game you can't lose
[2:14:57.340 --> 2:15:01.820]  so um just because Merrill Lynch is absorbed by the bank of america or this
[2:15:01.820 --> 2:15:05.820]  bank that goes down and and it's clientele is taken over by this bank
[2:15:05.820 --> 2:15:09.340]  it doesn't matter because the names on the doors are changing
[2:15:09.340 --> 2:15:14.460]  the masks on the face are changing but you own the game those are just cutouts
[2:15:14.460 --> 2:15:20.060]  exactly and if you own the game um you you can manipulate the game because
[2:15:20.060 --> 2:15:23.900]  you're controlling the rules of the game so what we're looking at
[2:15:23.900 --> 2:15:27.260]  and this has been long predicted and this is one of the real powerful things
[2:15:27.260 --> 2:15:31.900]  alex at this time is and and why it was so important to get this
[2:15:31.900 --> 2:15:35.420]  information out about the game and how it's played
[2:15:35.420 --> 2:15:39.260]  and what the goals are over the over the years gone by because
[2:15:39.260 --> 2:15:43.660]  that gives credibility when people look at it and say hold on hold on a second
[2:15:43.660 --> 2:15:46.300]  this was predicted this is not just happening now
[2:15:46.300 --> 2:15:49.580]  and and this really does start to take power from
[2:15:49.580 --> 2:15:53.500]  uh the way they manipulate giving us the impression that oh no this is just a
[2:15:53.500 --> 2:15:56.860]  problem that's just come out of nothing no no it's been planned for years and
[2:15:56.860 --> 2:16:01.020]  the plan is for a centralization of power
[2:16:01.020 --> 2:16:05.820]  in every areas over our lives and every area of global society
[2:16:05.820 --> 2:16:09.260]  including politics business and all the rest of it now crucial to that
[2:16:09.260 --> 2:16:14.060]  is banking they want a world central bank that dictates to the whole
[2:16:14.060 --> 2:16:18.060]  of the global financial system the whole of the global banking industry
[2:16:18.060 --> 2:16:21.580]  and their families are going to control that that's the idea
[2:16:21.580 --> 2:16:28.220]  so uh diversity is the worst nightmare of the dictator you look at any tyranny
[2:16:28.220 --> 2:16:32.060]  that if you want to centralize power it's no good having lots and lots of
[2:16:32.060 --> 2:16:35.980]  points of decision-making and diversity of decision-making because you can't
[2:16:35.980 --> 2:16:39.020]  centrally control that you want to and and just look at the way
[2:16:39.020 --> 2:16:42.380]  society's gone through the centuries is exactly the same way
[2:16:42.380 --> 2:16:46.620]  centralization of power constantly because you can only control from the
[2:16:46.620 --> 2:16:50.700]  center in the hands of a few if your center holds the power that
[2:16:50.700 --> 2:16:55.100]  affects the vast numbers of people eventually everyone as they plan
[2:16:55.100 --> 2:16:59.420]  so the more and more diversity there is in the banking system Alex the less
[2:16:59.420 --> 2:17:02.780]  power you're going to have over it because there are going to be banks and
[2:17:02.780 --> 2:17:06.300]  and and financial systems that you're not going to control to the extent that
[2:17:06.300 --> 2:17:10.300]  you want you want to take them out you want to centralize
[2:17:10.300 --> 2:17:14.460]  power you want to remove as much as you can the number of names the number of
[2:17:14.460 --> 2:17:17.500]  the amount of diversity and that's why the high level
[2:17:17.500 --> 2:17:20.620]  private central banks that are not your regular main street banks
[2:17:20.620 --> 2:17:24.140]  issued over a thousand trillion in liquidity to other banks and
[2:17:24.140 --> 2:17:28.140]  institutions and change the rules so they could sell derivatives and get into
[2:17:28.140 --> 2:17:31.420]  all this fraud because now the elite above get to
[2:17:31.420 --> 2:17:35.020]  orchestrate the consolidation they get to send down the regulators
[2:17:35.020 --> 2:17:38.140]  they get to send the tax money to the central
[2:17:38.140 --> 2:17:42.860]  small inner sanctum or coterie of banks so that they can manipulate the
[2:17:42.860 --> 2:17:45.820]  consolidation and in the imf and world bank documents
[2:17:45.820 --> 2:17:49.340]  uh... in their own statements in what kissinger said last week was in the
[2:17:49.340 --> 2:17:52.300]  wall street journal financial times of london
[2:17:52.300 --> 2:17:56.780]  they all are saying that the financial times of london said actually this is
[2:17:56.780 --> 2:18:00.860]  good for a few megabanks and uh... then they're the ones that change the rules
[2:18:00.860 --> 2:18:03.660]  meanwhile you have all these people alternative media running around saying
[2:18:03.660 --> 2:18:07.180]  oh no it's an accident it's an accident it's key for the establishment
[2:18:07.180 --> 2:18:11.820]  the controllers to sell that lie so they don't get the blame for what they've
[2:18:11.820 --> 2:18:15.100]  orchestrated so they can play the part of the savior
[2:18:15.100 --> 2:18:18.940]  setting up the world banking cartel which we buy carbon credits
[2:18:18.940 --> 2:18:22.380]  from which are a tax on human breathing
[2:18:22.380 --> 2:18:25.420]  and not all the real environmental problems we have so they can regulate
[2:18:25.420 --> 2:18:29.740]  our everyday life with carbon checkpoints and carbon audits of our homes
[2:18:29.740 --> 2:18:32.540]  and bureaucracy and one-child policy
[2:18:32.540 --> 2:18:35.580]  yeah you see this is this is this is a big point to get across
[2:18:35.580 --> 2:18:38.540]  uh... people and i understand why because that's how how that what they're
[2:18:38.540 --> 2:18:42.940]  led to believe they see private banks and they see the central banks in the
[2:18:42.940 --> 2:18:48.140]  different countries as separate but the same families control
[2:18:48.140 --> 2:18:52.300]  both sides now this is the game they they control the game
[2:18:52.300 --> 2:18:55.740]  so um whether private banks go out out of business
[2:18:55.740 --> 2:19:00.220]  uh... or not in this uh... this crash and crisis is going on
[2:19:00.220 --> 2:19:04.780]  they control the central bank they they will control if we allow them to do it
[2:19:04.780 --> 2:19:08.540]  the world central bank and therefore they will control the system
[2:19:08.540 --> 2:19:12.220]  the names will be different but the system will be controlled by
[2:19:12.220 --> 2:19:14.940]  their right system equals control that's the whole idea
[2:19:14.940 --> 2:19:18.620]  david like let's finish up with this topic is one unit all around the world
[2:19:18.620 --> 2:19:21.980]  they move as one unit because they have a central control system david stop
[2:19:21.980 --> 2:19:24.460]  there let's back up about a minute i want you to be able to finish that point
[2:19:24.460 --> 2:19:28.060]  when we come back stay with us
[2:19:29.260 --> 2:19:32.220]  all right uh... we're still on air streaming we're still on air streaming
[2:19:32.220 --> 2:19:34.460]  but let me just talk to david for a second
[2:19:34.460 --> 2:19:37.740]  of the info wars viewers out there david yes mate
[2:19:37.740 --> 2:19:40.540]  uh... you got a three-minute break we'll be right back to you let's finish up
[2:19:40.540 --> 2:19:42.540]  with the banking and then get into the bigger picture
[2:19:42.540 --> 2:19:45.740]  okay all right thank you so thank you so much my friend i thought i thought i
[2:19:45.740 --> 2:19:49.100]  thought at one point that you know i could make alex is that you know what
[2:19:49.100 --> 2:19:52.700]  they've done with this trillion dollar plus bailout
[2:19:52.700 --> 2:19:59.260]  is they've um uh... undermined the financial uh security of america
[2:19:59.260 --> 2:20:03.340]  wild actually doing nothing to change what it was supposed to change
[2:20:03.340 --> 2:20:07.740]  and you know we we if we get into china as well because i think china is
[2:20:07.740 --> 2:20:11.340]  is closing in if it's not the biggest holder of american debt
[2:20:11.340 --> 2:20:15.580]  now who's going to pick up this trillion dollar debt and henry paulson
[2:20:15.580 --> 2:20:19.580]  has made a hundred visits to uh... china
[2:20:19.580 --> 2:20:24.620]  discussing what's come back and talk about all of that and explain to people
[2:20:24.620 --> 2:20:25.580]  uh...
[2:20:25.580 --> 2:20:31.180]  you know how they're running the scam that will be back in three minutes
[2:20:31.180 --> 2:20:35.900]  jury from fish dental fillings vaccines arsenic in the water these heavy metal
[2:20:35.900 --> 2:20:38.860]  toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid

[2:23:41.340 --> 2:23:46.540]  in the next hour the key here is that the unprecedented action out of the
[2:23:46.540 --> 2:23:50.940]  open of the president all the major leaders of the two parties
[2:23:50.940 --> 2:23:54.700]  the treasurer secretary saying there's going to be a depression financial abyss
[2:23:54.700 --> 2:23:57.980]  you've got to pass this banker bailout bill and you read the bill
[2:23:57.980 --> 2:24:01.580]  immunity unlimited power they can do whatever they want commit basically any
[2:24:01.580 --> 2:24:05.500]  financial crime they want and it doesn't doesn't say 850 billion
[2:24:05.500 --> 2:24:10.140]  doesn't say 700 billion it says 5 trillion if you really read the fine
[2:24:10.140 --> 2:24:13.980]  print as bloomberg financial and others reported so they are the ones
[2:24:13.980 --> 2:24:17.580]  terrorizing the market to plunge then they force through the bill
[2:24:17.580 --> 2:24:22.380]  and last friday we have the congressman on uh... they all is on c-span
[2:24:22.380 --> 2:24:26.220]  they were threatened with physical martial law david
[2:24:26.220 --> 2:24:29.180]  they've been traveling may not know this when play the clip if you want to hear it
[2:24:29.180 --> 2:24:33.900]  they were threatened with martial law if they didn't pass it now cnn bbc army
[2:24:33.900 --> 2:24:37.340]  times are reporting the army is to be used during riots
[2:24:37.340 --> 2:24:40.620]  but again problem reaction solution they implode the economy
[2:24:40.620 --> 2:24:44.540]  the welfare check stop going out things break down there's riots the military
[2:24:44.540 --> 2:24:48.860]  saves us the president said so just amazing how they're right out in the
[2:24:48.860 --> 2:24:51.260]  open doing all of this david
[2:24:51.260 --> 2:24:55.100]  yeah because we've reached that point alex where it has to break the surface
[2:24:55.100 --> 2:24:59.820]  uh... to become of the changes in society that they've been working covertly
[2:24:59.820 --> 2:25:04.780]  for so long that that this is the key for the terms of america before what's
[2:25:04.780 --> 2:25:08.220]  happening on so many levels uh... in my opinion anyway and i've i've been
[2:25:08.220 --> 2:25:12.140]  writing this for years uh... and what i said was that they're going to use
[2:25:12.140 --> 2:25:15.020]  america are using america to destroy america
[2:25:15.020 --> 2:25:19.260]  why because they want a world government
[2:25:19.260 --> 2:25:23.100]  a world government cannot possibly have
[2:25:23.100 --> 2:25:26.860]  total global power while there's any superpower
[2:25:26.860 --> 2:25:30.620]  with with with massive military and financial might
[2:25:30.620 --> 2:25:35.180]  that has proved that the ability to say to the world government excuse me we're
[2:25:35.180 --> 2:25:38.460]  not doing that we're not accepting what what you're dictating and telling us to
[2:25:38.460 --> 2:25:41.100]  do so what they've been doing and it's been so
[2:25:41.100 --> 2:25:46.060]  blatant to me is that they are using america to destroy america
[2:25:46.060 --> 2:25:49.180]  first of all militarily they're stretching america
[2:25:49.180 --> 2:25:54.380]  all over the place militarily and weakening them on that level and now
[2:25:54.380 --> 2:25:59.180]  they're attacking the american economy on a massive scale and this trillion and
[2:25:59.180 --> 2:26:02.860]  as you rightly say basically open checkbook
[2:26:02.860 --> 2:26:09.340]  at so-called bailout is not designed to solve the crisis it's designed to
[2:26:09.340 --> 2:26:14.700]  further massively undermine the american economy and
[2:26:14.700 --> 2:26:18.140]  american financial security and who's holding this
[2:26:18.140 --> 2:26:21.980]  debt now that that's um this goodness those how much more debt
[2:26:21.980 --> 2:26:25.420]  that's coming into the debt that's already uh uh uh owed by america not
[2:26:25.420 --> 2:26:28.860]  that it is debt is money that doesn't exist it's a it's a scam
[2:26:28.860 --> 2:26:32.300]  but people like china are holding massive amounts of this and
[2:26:32.300 --> 2:26:36.300]  i found it very interesting you know that henry paulson
[2:26:36.300 --> 2:26:41.180]  as chairman and ceo of uh goldman sacks which was massively involved
[2:26:41.180 --> 2:26:46.140]  in this subprime uh scam and then becomes treasury secretary
[2:26:46.140 --> 2:26:49.740]  he has apparently made at least a hundred visits to china
[2:26:49.740 --> 2:26:53.740]  discussing uh financial matters with the chinese
[2:26:53.740 --> 2:26:58.780]  authorities and here's the china picking up more and more of this debt i was
[2:26:58.780 --> 2:27:04.860]  warned ages ago by various insiders watch for the time when china becomes
[2:27:04.860 --> 2:27:08.940]  uh a big economic and military power because that's when
[2:27:08.940 --> 2:27:13.020]  you're gonna see the action start and and what happens when china says hold on
[2:27:13.020 --> 2:27:16.380]  a second we own we all hold all this debt and
[2:27:16.380 --> 2:27:20.060]  therefore you know you're not paying us back you get any more and more trouble
[2:27:20.060 --> 2:27:23.180]  we want the assets please for the debt that we hold
[2:27:23.180 --> 2:27:27.980]  um then you've got uh uh potential for for for conflict between the two and i
[2:27:27.980 --> 2:27:33.260]  i was was told a long time ago that it's leading to a conflict involving china
[2:27:33.260 --> 2:27:36.700]  the third world war to bring in finally this whole structure
[2:27:36.700 --> 2:27:40.540]  of world government world central bank world army microchip population world
[2:27:40.540 --> 2:27:44.060]  currency and all the rest of it so all these things are moving
[2:27:44.060 --> 2:27:48.460]  as one unit they appear to be uh to most people unconnected
[2:27:48.460 --> 2:27:52.540]  as you look at the invasion of iraq and afghanistan and the finances
[2:27:52.540 --> 2:27:55.980]  all that was also meant to demonize one one
[2:27:55.980 --> 2:27:59.740]  one flow of energy that was also meant to demonize the name of the u.s
[2:27:59.740 --> 2:28:03.900]  to put the sins of the new order on the u.s like they use the soviets previously
[2:28:03.900 --> 2:28:07.740]  to carry out their dirty work they also need a global economic crisis that can
[2:28:07.740 --> 2:28:11.580]  be blamed on america to set up their world government
[2:28:11.580 --> 2:28:15.100]  and now all over the financial papers the last two weeks they proposed
[2:28:15.100 --> 2:28:18.300]  the private banks becoming the world government
[2:28:18.300 --> 2:28:22.300]  i mean that is so unbelievable i was reading a piece where when i when i was
[2:28:22.300 --> 2:28:26.700]  traveling about the head of the imf saying that the imf should become the
[2:28:26.700 --> 2:28:32.700]  central coordinating uh basically police force for the global banking system
[2:28:32.700 --> 2:28:36.300]  there's there's the the open suggestion now this world
[2:28:36.300 --> 2:28:40.540]  uh central bank that we've been talking about for for so long
[2:28:40.540 --> 2:28:46.700]  and uh so um what we're looking at is ironically while america is getting
[2:28:46.700 --> 2:28:50.140]  this flag while america gets the uh the thinker pointed at it
[2:28:50.140 --> 2:28:55.180]  actually um although it's firing the the the bullets if you like in places like
[2:28:55.180 --> 2:29:00.140]  iraq and afghanistan and what have you the the the guns being loaded in europe
[2:29:00.140 --> 2:29:04.220]  and and they're in europe you know the in the in the center of the secret society
[2:29:04.220 --> 2:29:08.380]  where it's but europe is is basically going up who me i've not got nothing to
[2:29:08.380 --> 2:29:11.660]  do with it it's america david ike gotta break when we come back
[2:29:11.660 --> 2:29:16.540]  long segment i want to hear your solutions how to combat this now i say
[2:29:16.540 --> 2:29:19.500]  expose is really behind it a but what else can we do
[2:29:19.500 --> 2:29:23.340]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:23.340 --> 2:29:29.580]  alex jones and the gcn radio network all right i know we're on air everybody

[2:29:43.900 --> 2:29:46.940]  we're going to be back in two minutes and we'll finish up with this
[2:29:46.940 --> 2:29:51.100]  and then get into the the nature of reality itself and how people can
[2:29:51.100 --> 2:29:55.980]  shift their paradigm into a larger larger uh horizon okay that'll be great
[2:29:55.980 --> 2:30:00.300]  okay we'll be back in two minutes sir thanks mate thank you

[2:31:33.820 --> 2:31:37.260]  that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[2:31:37.260 --> 2:31:40.700]  than when drinking the water that's because many chemicals are inhaled
[2:31:40.700 --> 2:31:43.660]  when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin

[2:33:28.860 --> 2:33:31.820]  and now there's debates on talk radio and tv about
[2:33:31.820 --> 2:33:37.260]  did they say the bill out would do that or people making that up
[2:33:37.260 --> 2:33:40.620]  they know the public doesn't have a memory for last week or does the public
[2:33:40.620 --> 2:33:43.020]  david i want to finish up with the economy and get into the nature of
[2:33:43.020 --> 2:33:46.780]  reality but there seems to be a shocking of the conscious
[2:33:46.780 --> 2:33:50.220]  and i've seen that in some psychological tests they've done
[2:33:50.220 --> 2:33:54.460]  at major universities studying rodent psychology which is very similar to
[2:33:54.460 --> 2:33:57.820]  human-grip psychology in these controlled mazes
[2:33:57.820 --> 2:34:02.540]  shocking yelling noise heat cold on rats till they finally just go into a
[2:34:02.540 --> 2:34:07.100]  catatonic state and shake in the corner and you know having cbs news come
[2:34:07.100 --> 2:34:10.700]  out and say mercury is good for your brain
[2:34:10.700 --> 2:34:14.540]  taking mercury shots helps your brain cells now that's an actual newscast i've
[2:34:14.540 --> 2:34:17.820]  played it 50 times i'm not going to play it today but if you want i'll play it
[2:34:17.820 --> 2:34:23.020]  or i've got msnbc saying actually poison and food is good from china we need
[2:34:23.020 --> 2:34:25.580]  poison in the food
[2:34:25.580 --> 2:34:29.820]  uh... you know you and and then tens of thousands will be just finishing up the
[2:34:29.820 --> 2:34:33.340]  the statement tens of thousands get sick from melamine
[2:34:33.340 --> 2:34:36.860]  on purpose in the milk because it shows on a
[2:34:36.860 --> 2:34:40.540]  uh... protein test if somebody tested that has high protein
[2:34:40.540 --> 2:34:44.540]  and then it turns out it's in a bunch of uh... food lines here in the u.s. where
[2:34:44.540 --> 2:34:47.580]  most of the food additives and drugs get made for the u.s. is now in china
[2:34:47.580 --> 2:34:50.780]  same for europe and and they admit it's killing
[2:34:50.780 --> 2:34:55.020]  hundreds of chinese that drank too much and it attacks your kidneys gives you
[2:34:55.020 --> 2:34:58.060]  cancer and the fda comes out yesterday and says actually
[2:34:58.060 --> 2:35:02.780]  it's good for you so it seems like they're they're almost lying to be caught as
[2:35:02.780 --> 2:35:07.820]  you said to surface and shock everyone into just
[2:35:07.820 --> 2:35:11.180]  kind of submitting your comments well um...
[2:35:11.180 --> 2:35:15.180]  this will be uh... kind of very interesting we've been talking about
[2:35:15.180 --> 2:35:17.900]  with the food additives and stuff when we get into the nature of reality in the
[2:35:17.900 --> 2:35:22.300]  way uh... it's manipulated but um... it in terms of the
[2:35:22.300 --> 2:35:25.420]  the the laboratory mouth of the laboratory rat full enough
[2:35:25.420 --> 2:35:28.140]  um... in my talks they do a section about that
[2:35:28.140 --> 2:35:31.980]  um... and it's very clear that when you put it all together alex when you put
[2:35:31.980 --> 2:35:34.940]  all the uh... the the shocks all the
[2:35:34.940 --> 2:35:38.620]  constant instructions all the do's and don'ts
[2:35:38.620 --> 2:35:42.060]  all the punishments but for increasingly
[2:35:42.060 --> 2:35:46.860]  find detail little things like uh... i talked about last time them
[2:35:46.860 --> 2:35:49.980]  people being fined in britain for feeding the birds people being fined for
[2:35:49.980 --> 2:35:53.340]  putting a card in their car saying it's for sale when it's their own car
[2:35:53.340 --> 2:35:57.420]  what what it is like is exactly like the laboratory rat because of course when
[2:35:57.420 --> 2:36:00.460]  you uh... when they're doing those experiments
[2:36:00.460 --> 2:36:04.060]  um... it when the rat goes down certain channels he gets a shock
[2:36:04.060 --> 2:36:07.260]  after a few shocks it doesn't go down that channel anymore and you can take
[2:36:07.260 --> 2:36:10.300]  the shock equipment away you still won't go down that channel because it's been
[2:36:10.300 --> 2:36:14.780]  programmed not to do that by by the carrot and the stick it's okay going
[2:36:14.780 --> 2:36:17.100]  down this one we'll leave you alone go down that one
[2:36:17.100 --> 2:36:20.780]  there's a problem now take this on a math scale
[2:36:20.780 --> 2:36:24.860]  all the things that are being thrown at us and that's what they're doing that
[2:36:24.860 --> 2:36:29.020]  they are manipulating so many shocks on the mind
[2:36:29.020 --> 2:36:33.260]  uh... creating so many fears so many traumas
[2:36:33.260 --> 2:36:37.820]  that we become subservient and this and basically anything for a quiet life
[2:36:37.820 --> 2:36:40.620]  yes sir no sir just save me well here's an example
[2:36:40.620 --> 2:36:44.300]  in england and the u.s. if an adult is at the park and i'm
[2:36:44.300 --> 2:36:47.180]  you know before i was single went for walks the park all the time are jogs
[2:36:47.180 --> 2:36:49.900]  the police come over and ask argue a pedophile
[2:36:49.900 --> 2:36:56.300]  i mean how bizarre or uh... steve watson out out for a date in london they come
[2:36:56.300 --> 2:36:59.100]  over and put him in a terror database clean cut nice looking guy
[2:36:59.100 --> 2:37:02.300]  with a master's degree in political science with a great looking girlfriend
[2:37:02.300 --> 2:37:05.820]  uh... everybody i know in england has had this happen to him it happened to me
[2:37:05.820 --> 2:37:08.540]  when i was there where they put me in a terror database
[2:37:08.540 --> 2:37:11.100]  they're letting you know you're a slave
[2:37:11.100 --> 2:37:14.940]  it yet i i i i exactly and uh... you know it
[2:37:14.940 --> 2:37:19.580]  uh... something that is uh... very important for people to to appreciate
[2:37:19.580 --> 2:37:23.260]  that we've been bombarded with shocks on purpose
[2:37:23.260 --> 2:37:27.020]  so that we will become subservient and and and we will
[2:37:27.020 --> 2:37:31.260]  give our power away i tell a wonderful example which really was encapsulated
[2:37:31.260 --> 2:37:35.180]  in one headline uh... when that when the taser started coming out will be
[2:37:35.180 --> 2:37:38.540]  started giving i'm not saying all police about i like that but now they've got
[2:37:38.540 --> 2:37:41.660]  this condition to daily deaths yeah i've i've i've
[2:37:41.660 --> 2:37:45.740]  met a few policemen who if they had a brain cell it would die of loneliness
[2:37:45.740 --> 2:37:49.660]  and we're giving these people fifty five thousand volts of electricity to
[2:37:49.660 --> 2:37:53.500]  shoot at people now there was an article in the newspaper which was looking at
[2:37:53.500 --> 2:37:57.340]  this when it first came in and the headline encapsulated exactly what
[2:37:57.340 --> 2:38:02.300]  we're talking about here it said i'll do anything you say officer
[2:38:02.300 --> 2:38:07.100]  just don't use that thing on me and that encapsulates this whole
[2:38:07.100 --> 2:38:10.540]  mind game it's a cattle prod it's a cattle prod
[2:38:10.540 --> 2:38:14.620]  for cows in the in in this waterhouse it's a cattle prod go ahead
[2:38:14.620 --> 2:38:19.740]  exactly and and but what we mustn't do and and we get to the nature of reality
[2:38:19.740 --> 2:38:23.100]  in the true nature of who we are as opposed to the false identity we've
[2:38:23.100 --> 2:38:28.300]  been that we've been sold from cradle to grave then you lose the fear and and you
[2:38:28.300 --> 2:38:31.580]  lose this subservience you you know someone with with an expanded
[2:38:31.580 --> 2:38:35.020]  consciousness and who looks in the mirror and realizes that what they're
[2:38:35.020 --> 2:38:37.900]  looking at is what they're experiencing not who they are
[2:38:37.900 --> 2:38:41.980]  they don't fall for this stuff and that's why
[2:38:41.980 --> 2:38:45.420]  this awakening and it's an awakening from an hypnotic
[2:38:45.420 --> 2:38:48.940]  trance that's what it is yes calling it an awakening is a very good
[2:38:48.940 --> 2:38:51.660]  term because that's what it is it's like someone
[2:38:51.660 --> 2:38:55.740]  in a hypnotist stage show having the fingers clicked and they wake up
[2:38:55.740 --> 2:38:59.500]  from the trance most of humanity is in an absolute
[2:38:59.500 --> 2:39:02.860]  hypnotic trance that is put uh they're put in
[2:39:02.860 --> 2:39:06.380]  from cradle to grave by constant repetition
[2:39:06.380 --> 2:39:09.820]  of a fake reality and when we wake up from this
[2:39:09.820 --> 2:39:14.060]  then we will not be subservient then we will cross the street and by the way
[2:39:14.060 --> 2:39:17.580]  i'll go engage with this and by the way the first step is the biggest
[2:39:17.580 --> 2:39:22.060]  once you realize you are in a hypnotic state with your literal brain waves
[2:39:22.060 --> 2:39:25.260]  from the television the average american now the average brit they've done
[2:39:25.260 --> 2:39:28.060]  studies we've posted them on info wars dot com and prison
[2:39:28.060 --> 2:39:30.860]  planet dot com i've also seen them on david ike dot com
[2:39:30.860 --> 2:39:36.540]  that that that people are now in a lower brain wave state than they were just 30
[2:39:36.540 --> 2:39:41.740]  40 years ago people are in a sleep state they are in a
[2:39:41.740 --> 2:39:47.740]  glazed eyed state and what david is telling you is absolutely true
[2:39:47.740 --> 2:39:51.260]  yeah well when you start to look at what reality is the then
[2:39:51.260 --> 2:39:56.460]  this conspiracy takes on a whole new depth and indeed you get closer and
[2:39:56.460 --> 2:40:00.300]  closer to the foundations of it because the foundations of it it plays out as
[2:40:00.300 --> 2:40:03.660]  banking scams it plays out as political scams it plays out as
[2:40:03.660 --> 2:40:07.340]  engineered wars all of which are absolutely vital for us to know about
[2:40:07.340 --> 2:40:10.540]  because you can't cease to be a slave until you realize you are one and what
[2:40:10.540 --> 2:40:14.620]  the game is so that's vital information but alongside that
[2:40:14.620 --> 2:40:18.220]  we need to understand not just what the prison looks like but but how we open
[2:40:18.220 --> 2:40:21.820]  the door and see indeed stop this door finally slamming shut
[2:40:21.820 --> 2:40:26.220]  and to do that we need to understand reality because the the the core
[2:40:26.220 --> 2:40:31.260]  people behind the people behind the people the shadow people as i call them
[2:40:31.260 --> 2:40:34.860]  they understand the nature of the reality that we're experiencing
[2:40:34.860 --> 2:40:40.780]  and they have worked tirelessly and endlessly to manipulate the structure
[2:40:40.780 --> 2:40:44.780]  of society and the information allowed to circulate society
[2:40:44.780 --> 2:40:48.860]  to keep the people in total ignorance of the very reality that they're
[2:40:48.860 --> 2:40:53.180]  experiencing and how can we possibly be free
[2:40:53.180 --> 2:40:57.580]  in a world that we don't even know what the world is we don't know who we are
[2:40:57.580 --> 2:41:01.260]  we don't know the nature of the reality we're experiencing if we don't start to
[2:41:01.260 --> 2:41:04.780]  get under an understanding of that information then again just like the
[2:41:04.780 --> 2:41:07.820]  banking system we're pawns in a game
[2:41:07.820 --> 2:41:11.260]  where someone else knows the rules and we don't
[2:41:11.260 --> 2:41:15.580]  and that's why this whole area of who are we where are we
[2:41:15.580 --> 2:41:18.940]  what is the nature of reality is so absolutely vital
[2:41:18.940 --> 2:41:23.740]  because it offers the key to the door and that's why it's my prime focus now
[2:41:23.740 --> 2:41:28.940]  because this is where the key is is held to open the door to this prison cell
[2:41:28.940 --> 2:41:32.620]  that they're building by the minute now to simplify that
[2:41:32.620 --> 2:41:38.060]  they are trying to shock us now and intensify the amount of outrageousness
[2:41:38.060 --> 2:41:42.540]  we know when they say Cadbury cakes filled with melamine are good for you
[2:41:42.540 --> 2:41:45.580]  they're doing that because some even greater horrors
[2:41:45.580 --> 2:41:50.060]  and intensification of the tyranny is coming and they're trying to acclimate
[2:41:50.060 --> 2:41:52.780]  the mind to where we're so shocked that we're
[2:41:52.780 --> 2:41:56.380]  basically numb and and so what you're saying and you're absolutely right from
[2:41:56.380 --> 2:41:59.820]  my perspective and and my life in studying
[2:41:59.820 --> 2:42:04.060]  history and philosophy and sociology and what's happening is
[2:42:04.060 --> 2:42:06.940]  once you realize you're being manipulated once you understand
[2:42:06.940 --> 2:42:10.460]  you're being programmed once you understand that's going on
[2:42:10.460 --> 2:42:13.900]  then you start looking and then it's a progression of levels
[2:42:13.900 --> 2:42:18.060]  as you become more and more aware and that's what the enemy is in a race to
[2:42:18.060 --> 2:42:22.460]  block and stop yeah when you expand your consciousness
[2:42:22.460 --> 2:42:26.380]  your energy field starts to vibrate quicker and
[2:42:26.380 --> 2:42:31.260]  quicker and quicker as you close your consciousness and you
[2:42:31.260 --> 2:42:35.420]  become a prisoner almost entirely of the five senses
[2:42:35.420 --> 2:42:40.620]  in how you see reality you see possibility and the five senses
[2:42:40.620 --> 2:42:47.900]  decode reality in sense of levitation i can't the five senses are telling us
[2:42:47.900 --> 2:42:52.940]  all the time how powerless we are how how many things we can't do how limited
[2:42:52.940 --> 2:42:57.260]  we are as you expand your consciousness that dramatically changes
[2:42:57.260 --> 2:43:02.300]  so if you can hold people in a low vibrational state because everything is
[2:43:02.300 --> 2:43:06.460]  vibrating energy in different forms then you are
[2:43:06.460 --> 2:43:12.060]  literally we we use these truisms as throwaway lines in our everyday life
[2:43:12.060 --> 2:43:15.420]  you are literally closing the minds of people
[2:43:15.420 --> 2:43:19.100]  so anything that will slow us down vibrationally
[2:43:19.100 --> 2:43:25.260]  is and fear is the biggest one will make us more and more closed-minded and
[2:43:25.260 --> 2:43:28.620]  have a more and more limited view of possibility in our
[2:43:28.620 --> 2:43:31.740]  own selves and we're being bombarded to that end
[2:43:31.740 --> 2:43:37.100]  by food additives by additives in drink and water by all the shocks that you're
[2:43:37.100 --> 2:43:40.540]  talking about by all the things that create the um
[2:43:40.540 --> 2:43:45.420]  the laboratory rap scenario and of course what when we're in fear and when
[2:43:45.420 --> 2:43:50.060]  we're in stress what do we say aren't feel so heavy i feel so tight
[2:43:50.060 --> 2:43:53.980]  why because you're going into a lower and lower vibrational state and the more
[2:43:53.980 --> 2:43:57.580]  you do the more the five senses dominate your
[2:43:57.580 --> 2:44:01.740]  reality and what are the five senses look alex to get a fix on who we are and
[2:44:01.740 --> 2:44:04.780]  what's going on in the world they look outside
[2:44:04.780 --> 2:44:08.300]  into this world and then madison avenue tells the women they're ugly and
[2:44:08.300 --> 2:44:10.940]  inadequate so they get even more depressed
[2:44:10.940 --> 2:44:14.620]  and and and don't realize what incredible dynamic creatures they are
[2:44:14.620 --> 2:44:17.660]  men think they need to be manly and start fights and only like
[2:44:17.660 --> 2:44:21.660]  football and not be good parents all of it is to hamstring us but let me throw
[2:44:21.660 --> 2:44:27.020]  out a historical example of of of horizons and
[2:44:27.020 --> 2:44:31.900]  and expanding your vision the elite of course have suppressed a lot of history
[2:44:31.900 --> 2:44:36.060]  but they know that we are quote made the image of the creator we are great
[2:44:36.060 --> 2:44:40.220]  creators we can build things and that's why a science fiction writer like jules
[2:44:40.220 --> 2:44:44.540]  verne or h.g. wells or any of these people they could expand just their
[2:44:44.540 --> 2:44:47.660]  imagination and almost everything they wrote about
[2:44:47.660 --> 2:44:51.980]  and talked about has now manifest because what the mind imagines
[2:44:51.980 --> 2:44:56.940]  in steps it is able to later construct through this group community this mass
[2:44:56.940 --> 2:45:01.980]  organism that we know of as as humanity so that's why the elite know to stop a
[2:45:01.980 --> 2:45:05.900]  true renaissance to the stars they have to make us petty small
[2:45:05.900 --> 2:45:11.100]  hateful to turn against each other and fearful of taking action now
[2:45:11.100 --> 2:45:14.540]  now now i say there's a balance there people call it fear
[2:45:14.540 --> 2:45:17.500]  when i say we've got to take action and go out and warn the people about the new
[2:45:17.500 --> 2:45:20.780]  world order or they're going to enslave us that isn't fear
[2:45:20.780 --> 2:45:27.420]  i'm saying we have a positive way to stop this but things will be bad if we
[2:45:27.420 --> 2:45:30.940]  don't that's just telling people the lay of the land
[2:45:30.940 --> 2:45:35.500]  they use a false fear of keep your mouth shut and everything will be all right
[2:45:35.500 --> 2:45:38.220]  if you don't you'll be in trouble do you see what i'm saying david because i've
[2:45:38.220 --> 2:45:40.780]  been very successful in different ways than you have you've been successful
[2:45:40.780 --> 2:45:43.580]  otherwise than i by getting people moving by
[2:45:43.580 --> 2:45:46.860]  being a cold bucket of ice water when they're in a trance
[2:45:46.860 --> 2:45:50.860]  i am able uh... with the information to shock them
[2:45:50.860 --> 2:45:54.540]  into waking and then they find people like david i do you see the point i'm
[2:45:54.540 --> 2:45:58.380]  saying yeah i mean the the biggest um
[2:45:58.380 --> 2:46:01.980]  aspect of this whole conspiracy alex in my view
[2:46:01.980 --> 2:46:06.700]  is that um they have manipulated humanity into a false
[2:46:06.700 --> 2:46:10.860]  sense of identity it's a sense of identity that looks in the mirror in the
[2:46:10.860 --> 2:46:15.260]  morning and says that is me i am chuck jones i am
[2:46:15.260 --> 2:46:19.500]  apple smith when we are consciousness having an
[2:46:19.500 --> 2:46:25.500]  experience as chuck jones and apple smith and if you identify
[2:46:25.500 --> 2:46:30.940]  who you are with the vehicle then you are going to identify yourself with the
[2:46:30.940 --> 2:46:34.300]  reality of the vehicle which is limitation
[2:46:34.300 --> 2:46:40.540]  i can't powerlessness we need to uh start to understand
[2:46:40.540 --> 2:46:45.660]  that the prime bottom line uh foundation of this conspiracy
[2:46:45.660 --> 2:46:51.660]  is to put us in this fake identity where we identify with being human as
[2:46:51.660 --> 2:46:55.820]  human is what we are human is what we are experiencing
[2:46:55.820 --> 2:46:59.500]  now when near-death experiences have these uh now
[2:46:59.500 --> 2:47:03.500]  in their millions uh recorded experiences of leaving the body when the
[2:47:03.500 --> 2:47:07.100]  body dies and they're coming back again with the bodies revived
[2:47:07.100 --> 2:47:12.460]  they tell extraordinary common stories of what they experienced in the
[2:47:12.460 --> 2:47:16.380]  intervening time where their consciousness massively expanded
[2:47:16.380 --> 2:47:19.820]  where they were seeing the past the present the future at the same time
[2:47:19.820 --> 2:47:23.180]  where there was no time where there was no sequence of events even where where
[2:47:23.180 --> 2:47:28.140]  they had this amazing ability to process information on a scale
[2:47:28.140 --> 2:47:31.820]  that they would think was ridiculous
[2:47:31.820 --> 2:47:35.500]  impossible when they're in the body see what the body does alex
[2:47:35.500 --> 2:47:40.060]  i had this i was sitting in the bath a few months ago and i had this
[2:47:40.060 --> 2:47:44.140]  vision in my mind it went like this first of all there was
[2:47:44.140 --> 2:47:48.300]  swirling energy and i knew immediately that was symbolic of consciousness
[2:47:48.300 --> 2:47:51.820]  then that an eye appeared in the in the in the in the energy
[2:47:51.820 --> 2:47:56.220]  and in front of the eye appeared a telescope and on the end of the
[2:47:56.220 --> 2:47:59.660]  telescope was the earth and this universe and then
[2:47:59.660 --> 2:48:02.940]  this is the crucial point the telescope morphed
[2:48:02.940 --> 2:48:06.860]  into a human body and what the human body is
[2:48:06.860 --> 2:48:11.260]  it's like uh what it is a biological computer but what it does it's your
[2:48:11.260 --> 2:48:16.860]  narrowly focused consciousness it locks us into a certain frequency range
[2:48:16.860 --> 2:48:20.460]  of reality which which scientists call visible light
[2:48:20.460 --> 2:48:23.580]  people think when they look out of their eyes that they're seeing everything
[2:48:23.580 --> 2:48:26.460]  that exists in the space they're looking at they are not
[2:48:26.460 --> 2:48:30.540]  they are looking at a tiny tiny frequency range
[2:48:30.540 --> 2:48:35.100]  of of of the math and matter that mainstream science says exist in this
[2:48:35.100 --> 2:48:37.580]  universe and there's a lot more than they've discovered yet
[2:48:37.580 --> 2:48:41.020]  um the electromagnetic spectrum is naught point
[2:48:41.020 --> 2:48:45.500]  naught naught five percent of that and visible light is a fraction of the
[2:48:45.500 --> 2:48:49.500]  naught point naught naught five percent that is the only frequency range
[2:48:49.500 --> 2:48:53.900]  that our eyes decode and our brain and and and genetic system decodes
[2:48:53.900 --> 2:48:57.660]  and sharing the same space as this if you like
[2:48:57.660 --> 2:49:00.940]  television station which we call physical reality
[2:49:00.940 --> 2:49:05.500]  or endless other realities just like in the space that i'm sitting here now
[2:49:05.500 --> 2:49:10.140]  um all the radio and television stations broadcasting to california
[2:49:10.140 --> 2:49:13.500]  are in the space that i'm occupying they're not interfering with each other
[2:49:13.500 --> 2:49:16.860]  they're not aware of each other unless they're really close on the dial
[2:49:16.860 --> 2:49:20.540]  but they're sharing the same space and we are experiencing
[2:49:20.540 --> 2:49:24.860]  a uh a a frequency range which we decode into this
[2:49:24.860 --> 2:49:28.460]  reality and the physical body the body computer
[2:49:28.460 --> 2:49:32.460]  locks us into that frequency range so when we leave the body in these near
[2:49:32.460 --> 2:49:36.460]  depth experiences experience this we leave that limitation
[2:49:36.460 --> 2:49:40.220]  that focus that that television station and suddenly we expand to the full
[2:49:40.220 --> 2:49:43.820]  magnitude of who we are what the conspiracies about because at the
[2:49:43.820 --> 2:49:49.420]  core the shadow of people understand this is is hypnotizing us
[2:49:49.420 --> 2:49:54.140]  from cradle to grave to believe that we are the vehicle
[2:49:54.140 --> 2:49:58.620]  which is uh focusing our consciousness to experience this reality
[2:49:58.620 --> 2:50:02.780]  and that we are as limited as that vehicle perceives the world
[2:50:02.780 --> 2:50:07.180]  that is how you you can turn humanity infinite consciousness in infinite
[2:50:07.180 --> 2:50:11.420]  expressions into a herd of sheep when we break that understanding when we move
[2:50:11.420 --> 2:50:15.420]  our point of observation from i am chuck jones i have no power
[2:50:15.420 --> 2:50:18.620]  to i am infinite consciousness are having an experience
[2:50:18.620 --> 2:50:22.380]  and i can take that understanding that power and i can change this reality
[2:50:22.380 --> 2:50:25.100]  because i know that we got a break that i am but
[2:50:25.100 --> 2:50:30.620]  then we have to break right now we're gonna talk behind the scenes
[2:50:30.620 --> 2:50:33.420]  david
[2:50:33.420 --> 2:50:37.660]  is david there yes mate yeah i was sorry we had to go to break we're on saddle
[2:50:37.660 --> 2:50:40.540]  we're on satellites so we had to break let's come back
[2:50:40.540 --> 2:50:43.660]  i don't know you keep up with all these different bits i like so no no you're
[2:50:43.660 --> 2:50:47.100]  doing a great job uh... it's easy it's the same every day
[2:50:47.100 --> 2:50:50.700]  uh... we're going to uh... i mean i mean i figure this we're going out on am
[2:50:50.700 --> 2:50:53.820]  an fm dial and shortwave and satellite and all this
[2:50:53.820 --> 2:50:57.100]  you know there needs to be breaks for the stations
[2:50:57.100 --> 2:51:01.980]  but if i'm here and we've got limited time and we have millions watching on
[2:51:01.980 --> 2:51:04.860]  the internet you know hundreds of thousands right now but over time
[2:51:04.860 --> 2:51:09.340]  millions why not in space in time not waste that time
[2:51:09.340 --> 2:51:13.100]  because this is passed on i mean talking about reality look at cyberspace
[2:51:13.100 --> 2:51:18.860]  it is a real reality now of data and it's taking our life experiences in our
[2:51:18.860 --> 2:51:23.740]  interface and it is saving that through the spacetime continuum
[2:51:23.740 --> 2:51:27.180]  uh... and then it interfaces with this plane of existence
[2:51:27.180 --> 2:51:31.340]  and i had a very important point if you want to if you want to bring that up
[2:51:31.340 --> 2:51:36.460]  because the internet is such a mirror of our reality pulling up
[2:51:36.460 --> 2:51:40.220]  well certainly and and uh... i don't think some of the listeners may realize
[2:51:40.220 --> 2:51:43.820]  that you're talking about mathematics by mainline physicist
[2:51:43.820 --> 2:51:48.300]  and quantum mechanics uh... physicist you're talking about real information
[2:51:48.300 --> 2:51:52.140]  about all these overlaid uh... dimensions and regardless
[2:51:52.140 --> 2:51:57.260]  take colonel correct roberts you know marine corps sniper army colonel
[2:51:57.260 --> 2:52:00.380]  police officer uh... he had a surgery for a huge
[2:52:00.380 --> 2:52:04.060]  like you know pound tumor in his stomach uh... and uh... he died
[2:52:04.060 --> 2:52:07.100]  for about ten minutes on the on the table right
[2:52:07.100 --> 2:52:10.700]  and uh... he literally went through the vortex
[2:52:10.700 --> 2:52:13.580]  he went before you know this all powerful entity
[2:52:13.580 --> 2:52:17.500]  and he was downloaded and this in the top of guys real concern of a straight
[2:52:17.500 --> 2:52:19.660]  lice right this happened in the late nineties
[2:52:19.660 --> 2:52:23.260]  he was downloaded all this information just like you described it back in the
[2:52:23.260 --> 2:52:27.020]  early nineties and it was literally just beamed into him and then this
[2:52:27.020 --> 2:52:30.300]  this quote guardian angel you know this that this other thing that always been
[2:52:30.300 --> 2:52:33.820]  the recording everything it said no i'm now going to take you back
[2:52:33.820 --> 2:52:37.100]  so you can tell people and that's that same story
[2:52:37.100 --> 2:52:41.180]  over and over again in other cultures throughout times on the Sanskrit
[2:52:41.180 --> 2:52:44.620]  and on the you know on all the other uh... tablets
[2:52:44.620 --> 2:52:49.900]  i mean you know definitely this is a body suit you know this is a
[2:52:49.900 --> 2:52:55.020]  space suit for our soul exactly and and and people but i found like the yogis
[2:52:55.020 --> 2:52:58.220]  in the east if people get too deep into this
[2:52:58.220 --> 2:53:01.580]  and then that's all they do they just sit in a pile of crap on the side of the
[2:53:01.580 --> 2:53:05.900]  street in new delhi instead of understanding there's a balance between
[2:53:05.900 --> 2:53:08.940]  that and then the real manifestation but taking
[2:53:08.940 --> 2:53:13.340]  the confidence of the wider horizons and then putting it into action
[2:53:13.340 --> 2:53:17.980]  in this spectrum a very important reality we're here for a reason
[2:53:17.980 --> 2:53:21.660]  i think that's key so i want to speak to that because i see a lot of mystics and
[2:53:21.660 --> 2:53:25.420]  people you know who get into the higher levels of humanity but they never spend
[2:53:25.420 --> 2:53:27.660]  any time going out and warning somebody on the
[2:53:27.660 --> 2:53:32.780]  street about the new world order so here we go
[2:53:32.780 --> 2:53:40.780]  they don't want to see us unite
[2:53:40.780 --> 2:53:46.780]  all they want us to do is keep on pushing and fighting
[2:53:46.780 --> 2:53:52.780]  they don't want to see us live together
[2:53:52.780 --> 2:53:58.780]  all they want us to do
[2:53:58.780 --> 2:54:05.900]  keep on killing one another
[2:54:05.900 --> 2:54:09.100]  what an amazing discussion with david ike during the breaks we're doing some
[2:54:09.100 --> 2:54:11.740]  behind the scenes talking but i'd like to keep it congruent for the full
[2:54:11.740 --> 2:54:15.740]  audience that you can go over to the info wars dot com streams
[2:54:15.740 --> 2:54:18.460]  the prison planet dot com streams those are separate from many others
[2:54:18.460 --> 2:54:21.660]  clitting genesis and uh here the expanded interview
[2:54:21.660 --> 2:54:25.420]  there or watch on prison planet dot tv don't forget
[2:54:25.420 --> 2:54:27.900]  with your prison planet dot tv membership you make what we do here
[2:54:27.900 --> 2:54:30.700]  possible get all my films in super high quality to burn them to
[2:54:30.700 --> 2:54:33.820]  desk and give to folks a factory of resistance
[2:54:33.820 --> 2:54:38.620]  all my films now 20 of them now i'm 19 i made a 20th i produced
[2:54:38.620 --> 2:54:41.660]  my book and so many other great books and videos we carry are available
[2:54:41.660 --> 2:54:45.740]  at info wars dot com and it is your funding of our operation that allows
[2:54:45.740 --> 2:54:48.060]  us to continue but the most important thing is the materials
[2:54:48.060 --> 2:54:51.900]  are waking people up and people are more ready
[2:54:51.900 --> 2:54:55.900]  to to to receive this information than ever before another great place to find
[2:54:55.900 --> 2:54:58.780]  out a lot of shocking information which regardless will
[2:54:58.780 --> 2:55:02.700]  open your horizons make you question and regardless whether it's all correct or
[2:55:02.700 --> 2:55:06.300]  not it is extremely positive to question
[2:55:06.300 --> 2:55:09.820]  and i see that's the genius of david ike and i really agree with him on 98
[2:55:09.820 --> 2:55:13.100]  percent of what he covers i just haven't been able to tangibly prove the other
[2:55:13.100 --> 2:55:15.980]  two percent my gut tells me you know for god's sake
[2:55:15.980 --> 2:55:20.140]  it's probably true but the point is is that i stick to what i can prove more
[2:55:20.140 --> 2:55:22.780]  in this plane of existence it's because i found that's more
[2:55:22.780 --> 2:55:26.140]  successful people who aren't further down the research line
[2:55:26.140 --> 2:55:30.780]  everybody should visit david ike dot com just google david ike
[2:55:30.780 --> 2:55:35.580]  and of course you spell his name i c k e
[2:55:35.580 --> 2:55:39.420]  and he's got a lot of great books and videos available there at david ike
[2:55:39.420 --> 2:55:43.660]  dot com okay david we got about four minutes till this segment so we're
[2:55:43.660 --> 2:55:47.180]  already be into the second hour you were getting into the nature of reality when
[2:55:47.180 --> 2:55:51.180]  i had to cut you off for the break there and how we are limited
[2:55:51.180 --> 2:55:54.460]  down to just this level of life but everybody knows in their gut and
[2:55:54.460 --> 2:55:57.740]  everything else that there's something more the sixth sense is proven
[2:55:57.740 --> 2:55:59.900]  you know when somebody's looking at you in a restaurant you know when you're in
[2:55:59.900 --> 2:56:02.380]  the woods and somebody's you know over the next hill
[2:56:02.380 --> 2:56:06.220]  i mean there's so much more to all of this and the enemy
[2:56:06.220 --> 2:56:09.580]  is obsessed with it and they're into dark energy and they're into
[2:56:09.580 --> 2:56:12.860]  torture and blood and death i mean the best example
[2:56:12.860 --> 2:56:18.060]  in the last few months is a sickening artist uh... like uh...
[2:56:18.060 --> 2:56:22.860]  damien hurst who sells a bucket of maggots you know a jar of maggots for
[2:56:22.860 --> 2:56:26.060]  four million pounds or a crystal devil skull for a hundred
[2:56:26.060 --> 2:56:28.300]  million pounds or ninety eight million pounds or
[2:56:28.300 --> 2:56:31.660]  images of razor blades and blood and tortured babies for twenty million
[2:56:31.660 --> 2:56:34.620]  pounds and the elite go and buy this and they say
[2:56:34.620 --> 2:56:37.900]  we're buying this because we are worshiping this
[2:56:37.900 --> 2:56:42.460]  this is how we adorate this
[2:56:42.460 --> 2:56:47.180]  everything at the end comes down to a vibrational state the lower it is the
[2:56:47.180 --> 2:56:51.180]  more limited you are the the the more narrow minded i would say
[2:56:51.180 --> 2:56:54.460]  narrow bandage you are the more you expand your consciousness that
[2:56:54.460 --> 2:56:57.740]  the more and the energy vibrates uh... quicker
[2:56:57.740 --> 2:57:02.620]  the the thing is that we are experiencing a band of frequencies now our
[2:57:02.620 --> 2:57:05.660]  consciousness is vibrating too quickly to interact with it
[2:57:05.660 --> 2:57:09.420]  um... if my consciousness tries to interact with this um this book on this
[2:57:09.420 --> 2:57:12.380]  table in front of me i couldn't pick it up just let's radio
[2:57:12.380 --> 2:57:16.060]  uh... a couldn't interact with radio too because they they share the same space
[2:57:16.060 --> 2:57:19.100]  but they're not close enough on the dial to interact with each other
[2:57:19.100 --> 2:57:23.180]  so consciousness takes on an outer shell that is vibrating
[2:57:23.180 --> 2:57:26.860]  within the frequency range you want to interact with we call it the human body
[2:57:26.860 --> 2:57:30.620]  therefore because i have that i can pick that book up because they're operating
[2:57:30.620 --> 2:57:32.940]  in the same frequency range they can interact
[2:57:32.940 --> 2:57:36.300]  the whole basis of this uh conspiracy alex
[2:57:36.300 --> 2:57:43.020]  is to manipulate us to identify who we are with the physical vehicle we are
[2:57:43.020 --> 2:57:46.860]  using to experience this reality because that sees everything in terms of
[2:57:46.860 --> 2:57:49.660]  apartness it sees everything in terms of limitation
[2:57:49.660 --> 2:57:52.620]  and once you're in what i call body consciousness
[2:57:52.620 --> 2:57:56.380]  which which um basically filters reality through the five senses
[2:57:56.380 --> 2:58:00.540]  you're into a state of powerlessness of limitation of icon and crucially
[2:58:00.540 --> 2:58:05.020]  you're in a state of seeing everything as a part which is the perfect vehicle the
[2:58:05.020 --> 2:58:09.820]  perfect landscape to bring about divide and rule to different religions and
[2:58:09.820 --> 2:58:14.380]  one-minute break let me talk to you
[2:58:14.380 --> 2:58:18.780]  david yeah back in uh one minute and this is this is key i'm gonna skip
[2:58:18.780 --> 2:58:21.500]  the next break for everybody i may even have the station skip it
[2:58:21.500 --> 2:58:24.700]  uh we're gonna be back in about one minute and then back up because i want
[2:58:24.700 --> 2:58:29.900]  to before we get into expanding our horizons expanding and realizing
[2:58:29.900 --> 2:58:33.500]  you know not just with the spiritual or ethereal or the other wavelengths
[2:58:33.500 --> 2:58:37.340]  but as a species we live on through our children and that's why we should stand
[2:58:37.340 --> 2:58:40.940]  up against evil to pass better things on to them you report you so
[2:58:40.940 --> 2:58:44.780]  you know there's also you know concrete things in this dimension as you say
[2:58:44.780 --> 2:58:47.180]  but i want to briefly get into something you haven't covered in a while
[2:58:47.180 --> 2:58:51.980]  the satanism why are they wanting to because they say in the black magic
[2:58:51.980 --> 2:58:55.100]  they do these horrible things to bring in the entities
[2:58:55.100 --> 2:58:59.740]  to bring them set to get power dark power why are the elites into blood and
[2:58:59.740 --> 2:59:03.020]  wars and pain and babies being hurt why are they
[2:59:03.020 --> 2:59:06.300]  into such horrible things so we're gonna i could get right into that could i
[2:59:06.300 --> 2:59:09.020]  could we just cover one thing when we get back as it goes on for what i've
[2:59:09.020 --> 2:59:11.820]  just been talking about what is this reality what is this collective
[2:59:11.820 --> 2:59:14.380]  reality we're experiencing yeah let me tell you about the breaks
[2:59:14.380 --> 2:59:17.500]  this is a five-minute segment a three-minute break then a 15-minute
[2:59:17.500 --> 2:59:20.700]  segment and then a five-minute segment and then a
[2:59:20.700 --> 2:59:24.300]  18-minute segment and then the show is basically over so that's the next five
[2:59:24.300 --> 2:59:26.940]  minutes segment i could do this easy here we go we're going live we're going
[2:59:26.940 --> 2:59:35.740]  live right now okay
[2:59:35.740 --> 2:59:39.980]  we are now into hour number four on the internet streams we are number one on
[2:59:39.980 --> 2:59:44.700]  shoutcast period number one on the web for radio
[2:59:44.700 --> 2:59:47.980]  on the internet and we're not just on the internet we're on amon fm shortwave
[2:59:47.980 --> 2:59:51.740]  satellite we think all those affiliates okay david i finishing up with the
[2:59:51.740 --> 2:59:56.700]  nature of reality and then expanding into not just the positive
[2:59:56.700 --> 3:00:00.620]  reality and love and light and goodness but then we're going to get to the dark
[3:00:00.620 --> 3:00:04.940]  side and what makes up the enemy people need to understand that david i
[3:00:04.940 --> 3:00:08.380]  well this is the key and then this this might you know
[3:00:08.380 --> 3:00:11.740]  uh... shock a few people when they when they think about it but
[3:00:11.740 --> 3:00:15.660]  um... this reality that we are experiencing a solid
[3:00:15.660 --> 3:00:19.580]  walls and that's apparently solid world it's just an illusion
[3:00:19.580 --> 3:00:22.540]  the only place it exists is in that is in our heads
[3:00:22.540 --> 3:00:26.460]  and it is what i call the holographic internet
[3:00:26.460 --> 3:00:32.060]  if i'm in this room now and if i um i look around there's the the wireless
[3:00:32.060 --> 3:00:35.900]  internet is in this room but i can't see it but if i get
[3:00:35.900 --> 3:00:39.500]  uh... a computer and i tune into the wireless internet suddenly i have a
[3:00:39.500 --> 3:00:43.420]  complete worldwide collective reality called the
[3:00:43.420 --> 3:00:47.660]  worldwide web which can be accessed anywhere in china
[3:00:47.660 --> 3:00:51.420]  the firewall off to a large extent australia south america america
[3:00:51.420 --> 3:00:55.420]  london anywhere in the world people can tap in through that computer
[3:00:55.420 --> 3:00:58.860]  into the same collective reality what they make of it is
[3:00:58.860 --> 3:01:02.700]  is their unique spin but it's the same reality
[3:01:02.700 --> 3:01:05.820]  um if you if you said to people tell me about the internet
[3:01:05.820 --> 3:01:08.540]  they'd say well it's it's graphics and websites and
[3:01:08.540 --> 3:01:13.500]  and colors and not on a screen yes it is but the only place the internet exists
[3:01:13.500 --> 3:01:16.380]  in that form is on the screen nowhere else everywhere else is electronic
[3:01:16.380 --> 3:01:19.580]  circuits etc um you say to people tell me about television
[3:01:19.580 --> 3:01:22.780]  they say all these programs are moving pictures on screen yes it is
[3:01:22.780 --> 3:01:26.380]  but the only place that television exists in that form is on the screen
[3:01:26.380 --> 3:01:30.220]  everywhere else it is a electronic circuits and frequency
[3:01:30.220 --> 3:01:33.260]  fields which the television decodes into those pictures
[3:01:33.260 --> 3:01:36.700]  what we do through this physical vehicle what we call physical anyway
[3:01:36.700 --> 3:01:41.260]  is we're decoding a reality uh... i'm exactly the same principle though
[3:01:41.260 --> 3:01:45.020]  fantastically more sophisticated as the wireless internet
[3:01:45.020 --> 3:01:48.300]  and this is what we get our collective reality from now this is this is vital
[3:01:48.300 --> 3:01:52.940]  to the conspiracy um alex because if you know this
[3:01:52.940 --> 3:01:58.380]  and the people don't then you can manipulate the way they decode reality
[3:01:58.380 --> 3:02:02.860]  to fit what you want those people to do what if a stage hypnotist doing on a
[3:02:02.860 --> 3:02:06.220]  stage he is manipulating the stugeous sense of
[3:02:06.220 --> 3:02:09.180]  reality in other words the way they decode reality
[3:02:09.180 --> 3:02:13.180]  so it'll give one for instance a potato and they'll
[3:02:13.180 --> 3:02:16.940]  believe the potato but he beforehand will have programmed the brain the
[3:02:16.940 --> 3:02:20.460]  decoding system to believe that it's an apple
[3:02:20.460 --> 3:02:24.140]  so as the message goes from the taste buds to the brain
[3:02:24.140 --> 3:02:28.780]  as an electrical signal the brain decodes that not as a potato but as an
[3:02:28.780 --> 3:02:31.420]  apple and you try telling that guy he's not eating it but
[3:02:31.420 --> 3:02:35.260]  an apple because he's tasting it i went to stage hypnotist shows that when i was
[3:02:35.260 --> 3:02:38.380]  researching all this and i watched it happen i watched people
[3:02:38.380 --> 3:02:43.820]  real back with fantastic smells that never existed but just being programmed
[3:02:43.820 --> 3:02:46.860]  in when i say this word you're going to smell the smell of this
[3:02:46.860 --> 3:02:50.860]  it's all manipulation well it shows predictive programming and they have
[3:02:50.860 --> 3:02:54.140]  those tv shows where they really do it and they found in studies that the
[3:02:54.140 --> 3:02:57.580]  population is more suggestible massively more
[3:02:57.580 --> 3:03:01.100]  suggestible than they were just 10 20 30 40 years ago
[3:03:01.100 --> 3:03:06.060]  we're being programmed by tv to be more suggestible and now everything's like
[3:03:06.060 --> 3:03:09.420]  uh... you know time square where they're taking over reality
[3:03:09.420 --> 3:03:14.540]  with blimps and with and with tv screens and where everything is becoming
[3:03:14.540 --> 3:03:19.100]  uh... this minority report world that and and because they know that this
[3:03:19.100 --> 3:03:23.100]  information i'm talking about now they understand this uh... at the shadow
[3:03:23.100 --> 3:03:27.580]  people level and they are programming just like hypnotists
[3:03:27.580 --> 3:03:32.060]  and they are hypnotists they're programming the decoding system of the
[3:03:32.060 --> 3:03:36.780]  brain to decode reality this uh... wireless internet this holographic
[3:03:36.780 --> 3:03:40.060]  uh... cosmic internet if you like we call the physical world
[3:03:40.060 --> 3:03:44.700]  and to decode it in a way that suits them in terms of limitation in terms of
[3:03:44.700 --> 3:03:47.980]  that's what we are all these world is individual
[3:03:47.980 --> 3:03:52.060]  biomechanical machines marching around the surface of a giant planetoid
[3:03:52.060 --> 3:03:54.620]  covered by oceans and a thin ribbon of atmosphere
[3:03:54.620 --> 3:03:59.580]  who are all individually experiencing just a very narrow band
[3:03:59.580 --> 3:04:04.060]  uh... of reality and then they're even trying to program that narrow band
[3:04:04.060 --> 3:04:08.140]  and and and use our social conditioning to keep us in very small parameters
[3:04:08.140 --> 3:04:11.580]  david correct they're trying to uh... isolate
[3:04:11.580 --> 3:04:15.020]  ours in the body consciousness vehicle which has a
[3:04:15.020 --> 3:04:18.140]  ability to think for itself it's not just like an ordinary computer
[3:04:18.140 --> 3:04:21.580]  it's a biological computer it has the ability to think for itself and react
[3:04:21.580 --> 3:04:24.620]  to environmental changes that's what we call physical evolution
[3:04:24.620 --> 3:04:27.660]  david we're going to skip this break it's too important only on the info war
[3:04:27.660 --> 3:04:31.500]  streams in prison blinded on tv
[3:04:31.500 --> 3:04:34.140]  all right david uh... we're gonna come back and finish up with what you're
[3:04:34.140 --> 3:04:36.780]  saying and and in three minutes but i don't want to waste
[3:04:36.780 --> 3:04:39.020]  any of this time for the huge internet audience
[3:04:39.020 --> 3:04:42.380]  uh... why don't you look at you know continue along this line but
[3:04:42.380 --> 3:04:45.500]  but a separate substratum i mean give us some
[3:04:45.500 --> 3:04:50.300]  uh... microcosm example of of the point you were just making
[3:04:50.300 --> 3:04:54.780]  well if you take the uh... that that the state of the situation
[3:04:54.780 --> 3:04:58.540]  where he's programming into them into the mind into the brain he's actually
[3:04:58.540 --> 3:05:02.780]  programming the computer to read reality in a certain way
[3:05:02.780 --> 3:05:05.820]  um... and then you put it on the collective level
[3:05:05.820 --> 3:05:09.260]  that's what wolf blitzer is doing alex that's what
[3:05:09.260 --> 3:05:12.540]  people in colleges and schools and academics are doing
[3:05:12.540 --> 3:05:16.300]  often overwhelmingly not because they know that's what they're doing but these
[3:05:16.300 --> 3:05:19.980]  people are hypnotic well their project the their products of the system
[3:05:19.980 --> 3:05:23.500]  you take the del fide technique one of many corporate techniques
[3:05:23.500 --> 3:05:28.140]  now if you watch fox especially they talk to you like you're a child
[3:05:28.140 --> 3:05:31.740]  and it's all done in a happy eye oh hi there
[3:05:31.740 --> 3:05:35.500]  you're watching us you know before we wanted stern people that it was
[3:05:35.500 --> 3:05:38.780]  authoritative now it's like we're children
[3:05:38.780 --> 3:05:42.700]  oh it's incredible crucially the thing the thing is this is the whole bottom
[3:05:42.700 --> 3:05:44.460]  line of it
[3:05:44.460 --> 3:05:49.020]  consciousness that which we are eternally experiences this reality through
[3:05:49.020 --> 3:05:52.380]  the vehicle and the vehicle itself has the ability to think up to a certain
[3:05:52.380 --> 3:05:56.460]  point because it's reacting to environmental influences all the time
[3:05:56.460 --> 3:06:01.740]  what they want to do is isolate our sense of reality into the vehicle
[3:06:01.740 --> 3:06:06.220]  and keep consciousness if for the soul of some people call it
[3:06:06.220 --> 3:06:10.140]  out of the decision-making process out of the awareness process
[3:06:10.140 --> 3:06:13.420]  and therefore hold everyone in the state of limitation
[3:06:13.420 --> 3:06:18.220]  so you you take a consciousness out of it expanded consciousness out of it you
[3:06:18.220 --> 3:06:23.980]  can turn people into basically and and it it is a sophisticated
[3:06:23.980 --> 3:06:28.300]  more advanced version of robots you you you have rights
[3:06:28.300 --> 3:06:32.620]  and they react as you put input in you put replicants
[3:06:32.620 --> 3:06:36.060]  and out it comes and what's interesting alexis as
[3:06:36.060 --> 3:06:39.100]  people expand their consciousness and we have this awakening
[3:06:39.100 --> 3:06:44.220]  um when people when they're pressing enter they're more and more not getting
[3:06:44.220 --> 3:06:48.460]  what the computer would normally react with so the establishment not buying
[3:06:48.460 --> 3:06:51.500]  this now so the establishment has to shake things up
[3:06:51.500 --> 3:06:55.340]  have calamities terrorize the public back into buying
[3:06:55.340 --> 3:06:58.700]  the official reality and the establishment says if you buy in the
[3:06:58.700 --> 3:07:02.220]  official reality if you do what we say if you go along with the bailout
[3:07:02.220 --> 3:07:05.980]  then everything will be okay but then it isn't okay and they say we'll go along
[3:07:05.980 --> 3:07:08.780]  with this again and this time it'll be okay
[3:07:08.780 --> 3:07:12.940]  so i think in the final equation they don't want us innately or from our core
[3:07:12.940 --> 3:07:16.780]  our instincts uh from the ether making decisions on
[3:07:16.780 --> 3:07:20.220]  our own they want us with their manual to only make
[3:07:20.220 --> 3:07:24.460]  decisions according to what they've prescribed to never think on our own but
[3:07:24.460 --> 3:07:28.380]  only go off of what madison avenue and the map makers of the mind say an
[3:07:28.380 --> 3:07:32.940]  engineer i want your take on that as we go live right now
[3:07:34.300 --> 3:07:39.100]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[3:07:39.100 --> 3:07:46.380]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[3:07:46.380 --> 3:07:53.020]  and now live from austin texas alex jones i asked david i curler to plug some
[3:07:53.020 --> 3:07:56.140]  of his books and videos and he said nope i'm not going to plug him i don't care
[3:07:56.140 --> 3:08:00.060]  about that well it's an amazing individual but he
[3:08:00.060 --> 3:08:02.540]  does have great books and videos very enlightening
[3:08:02.540 --> 3:08:05.980]  they'll make a lot of people up and you need to get them at davidike.com
[3:08:05.980 --> 3:08:09.020]  and i've gotten to that point too that's why i say my videos are all free on the
[3:08:09.020 --> 3:08:11.180]  internet they're in higher quality at prison planet
[3:08:11.180 --> 3:08:14.380]  dot tv or get them and make copies but at the same time you need to support
[3:08:14.380 --> 3:08:16.620]  people like david ike and myself because then we can
[3:08:16.620 --> 3:08:19.900]  have more people do more take more action i'm running more of a news
[3:08:19.900 --> 3:08:23.260]  organization so my needs are greater so that keeps me back on the you know
[3:08:23.260 --> 3:08:25.740]  straight and narrow of just trying to fund this operation
[3:08:25.740 --> 3:08:30.060]  david now is just traveling around the world speaking to huge crowds of people
[3:08:30.060 --> 3:08:33.420]  and writing books and making videos every year and we just really appreciate
[3:08:33.420 --> 3:08:36.700]  him david i was i was asking you the question for the info wars internet
[3:08:36.700 --> 3:08:39.660]  audience and we're back on the main audience about the map makers of the
[3:08:39.660 --> 3:08:45.820]  mind it's also dangerous if if we unlock minds
[3:08:45.820 --> 3:08:48.860]  or people unlock their own minds by us pointing out that they're locked
[3:08:48.860 --> 3:08:52.780]  and then the new world order has set up lots of spiritual traps or lots of
[3:08:52.780 --> 3:08:55.980]  you wouldn't even call it spiritual coding traps is what i would call them
[3:08:55.980 --> 3:09:00.940]  uh... of of of false rabbit trails which are meant to suck people into very
[3:09:00.940 --> 3:09:04.300]  dangerous cults very dangerous eastern organizations
[3:09:04.300 --> 3:09:07.420]  all sorts of new world order stuff because the new world order knows this
[3:09:07.420 --> 3:09:11.660]  they're into it so they've made it all very dark and they capture
[3:09:11.660 --> 3:09:15.580]  people that break up through the control matrix and they're swimming up
[3:09:15.580 --> 3:09:19.660]  and the new world order captures them
[3:09:19.660 --> 3:09:23.020]  i'm on tv right now i'm showing people you know here's the mass control
[3:09:23.020 --> 3:09:25.820]  consciousness believes the federal reserve is federal and the government
[3:09:25.820 --> 3:09:30.060]  loves you and everything's fine and and melamine plastics good for your kidneys
[3:09:30.060 --> 3:09:33.180]  and poisons good for you you know they're down here but more more breaking
[3:09:33.180 --> 3:09:37.100]  through swimming up so the new world orders created lots of false
[3:09:37.100 --> 3:09:40.860]  solutions and lots of them it's very sophisticated and then they
[3:09:40.860 --> 3:09:45.820]  infest the you know consciousness crowd and knowing that though that people are
[3:09:45.820 --> 3:09:48.140]  going to escape they're there to capture them
[3:09:48.140 --> 3:09:51.100]  how do people protect themselves from that
[3:09:51.100 --> 3:09:54.860]  well this is this is the the bottom line of what they're doing alex
[3:09:54.860 --> 3:09:58.780]  um you can call it so i call it infinite consciousness expanding
[3:09:58.780 --> 3:10:02.700]  conscious whatever you like the idea is to keep that
[3:10:02.700 --> 3:10:08.300]  from imposing or or infusing its level of wisdom and awareness
[3:10:08.300 --> 3:10:12.700]  and love and uh... the understanding that everything is one
[3:10:12.700 --> 3:10:16.540]  through the physical vehicle computer into this reality
[3:10:16.540 --> 3:10:20.380]  it wants to isolate the computer and then uh... into what i call body
[3:10:20.380 --> 3:10:23.740]  consciousness uh... which also includes the lower auric field electric
[3:10:23.740 --> 3:10:27.900]  magnetic field and then have us manifest evil through it using us as a
[3:10:27.900 --> 3:10:32.380]  puppet yet the thing is that once you disconnect from if you like higher
[3:10:32.380 --> 3:10:36.060]  levels of awareness uh... and you become uh... uh...
[3:10:36.060 --> 3:10:40.220]  encased in body consciousness you're looking outside of yourself
[3:10:40.220 --> 3:10:43.740]  for information to get a fix on life yourself the nature of reality
[3:10:43.740 --> 3:10:47.500]  and what comes back what you learn at school what you learn through the media
[3:10:47.500 --> 3:10:50.380]  what you learn from bankers and politicians and all the rest of it in
[3:10:50.380 --> 3:10:53.740]  other words what they're doing is isolating the computer from our
[3:10:53.740 --> 3:10:57.420]  consciousness what you would call soul and then programming the computer with
[3:10:57.420 --> 3:11:02.860]  the reality that suits the agenda now as people awaken
[3:11:02.860 --> 3:11:07.420]  um... they there are what i've called in my book endless cul-de-sacs
[3:11:07.420 --> 3:11:12.700]  which are being set up little mousetraps to take people away from the full
[3:11:12.700 --> 3:11:17.020]  magnitude of expressing the full power and awareness of who they are
[3:11:17.020 --> 3:11:20.220]  into things like the new age into in and into other things
[3:11:20.220 --> 3:11:23.740]  where they can be uh... if you like yet put it yet put in the cul-de-sac
[3:11:23.740 --> 3:11:27.180]  i mean i i i've called the new age uh... in my books the last cul-de-sac
[3:11:27.180 --> 3:11:30.540]  before the gold mine because it takes people away from
[3:11:30.540 --> 3:11:34.380]  understanding that they are the power and again it hands power to other people
[3:11:34.380 --> 3:11:38.220]  some some guru or some new age guy or whatever
[3:11:38.220 --> 3:11:41.340]  just as the religions in all their forms are about
[3:11:41.340 --> 3:11:45.740]  the people handing their power and their belief systems over to others
[3:11:45.740 --> 3:11:49.100]  we are consciousness we are infinite consciousness we're all expressions of
[3:11:49.100 --> 3:11:53.340]  the same consciousness that's why the fighting between us is so idiotic and
[3:11:53.340 --> 3:11:55.820]  stupid and ridiculous but that's what happens when you
[3:11:55.820 --> 3:11:59.260]  lose that understanding of unity and you see everything in in a partners
[3:11:59.260 --> 3:12:01.500]  because you caught in the in the body computer
[3:12:01.500 --> 3:12:05.820]  so what we need to do is to move our point of observation of the world in
[3:12:05.820 --> 3:12:10.700]  ourselves from i am apple smith in the computer i am the computer to i am
[3:12:10.700 --> 3:12:13.660]  infinite consciousness having an experience through this computer in
[3:12:13.660 --> 3:12:16.700]  this tiny frequency range we call the the physical world
[3:12:16.700 --> 3:12:19.500]  and everyone else whose eyes i look into
[3:12:19.500 --> 3:12:23.180]  are the same consciousness as me having a different experience back into
[3:12:23.180 --> 3:12:26.460]  myself and that's the incredible thing is that
[3:12:26.460 --> 3:12:30.140]  just in a meat and potatoes way let's say there is no
[3:12:30.140 --> 3:12:33.020]  consciousness above us which we know is a lie but
[3:12:33.020 --> 3:12:37.420]  through genetic consciousness it's all a mirror i understand that i am all those
[3:12:37.420 --> 3:12:40.380]  that came before me and i am passing on through my
[3:12:40.380 --> 3:12:43.660]  children everybody that came before me and who i was
[3:12:43.660 --> 3:12:46.780]  and i realize i'm going to love my children's grandchildren who i'll never
[3:12:46.780 --> 3:12:51.500]  meet or their great grandchildren as much as i love my children or i love
[3:12:51.500 --> 3:12:54.860]  myself in fact more so and so why would i want to
[3:12:54.860 --> 3:12:59.020]  commit a crime against the genetic code why would i want to commit a crime
[3:12:59.020 --> 3:13:03.020]  against humanity when i'm related to all these people they'd be black or white
[3:13:03.020 --> 3:13:07.500]  chinese or german and i realize that and then i ask myself
[3:13:07.500 --> 3:13:11.420]  how why does the new world order revel they know the mercury's damaging the
[3:13:11.420 --> 3:13:14.140]  genetic code they know the gmo is attacking and actually
[3:13:14.140 --> 3:13:17.420]  mutating the human species they know they're attacking the earth
[3:13:17.420 --> 3:13:20.140]  and then they give us fake environmentalism when we rebel against that and
[3:13:20.140 --> 3:13:24.140]  then use it to control us more they know they are killing things
[3:13:24.140 --> 3:13:27.580]  now we've talked about the positive side the enemy
[3:13:27.580 --> 3:13:31.820]  they now understand this system but but the controllers you know the shadow
[3:13:31.820 --> 3:13:34.780]  behind the throne the power behind the throne they have
[3:13:34.780 --> 3:13:41.420]  made the conscious decision to revel in darkness and destruction why
[3:13:41.420 --> 3:13:45.260]  well let's just go one point which kind of relates to this but relates to what
[3:13:45.260 --> 3:13:50.060]  you just said take consciousness to be the most brilliant computer
[3:13:50.060 --> 3:13:53.420]  programmer in the world and he's sitting at his desk
[3:13:53.420 --> 3:13:56.940]  in front of a computer symbolic of the body shall we say
[3:13:56.940 --> 3:14:00.700]  and he's trying to get his genius through that computer
[3:14:00.700 --> 3:14:04.540]  into into the reality on the screen this world
[3:14:04.540 --> 3:14:08.220]  if that computer is destabilized if it's not working
[3:14:08.220 --> 3:14:13.020]  if it's got viruses if it's not decoding properly if it's got various
[3:14:13.020 --> 3:14:16.860]  things wrong with it if it's uh electrically imbalanced and uh
[3:14:16.860 --> 3:14:20.140]  and uh it's the decoding system is distorted
[3:14:20.140 --> 3:14:24.380]  i don't care if that guy in that chair symbolic of our true self our true
[3:14:24.380 --> 3:14:27.820]  consciousness is the best computer programmers ever lived
[3:14:27.820 --> 3:14:30.460]  he's not going to pass that genius through that computer
[3:14:30.460 --> 3:14:35.020]  so this conspiracy alex is about attacking the the vehicle
[3:14:35.020 --> 3:14:41.020]  the decoding system to make sure that it is inefficient and imbalanced and
[3:14:41.020 --> 3:14:45.420]  doesn't uh operate to the true efficiency and magnitude that he possibly
[3:14:45.420 --> 3:14:48.620]  could i've got to add something it's so incredible what you're saying
[3:14:48.620 --> 3:14:53.180]  that's a true reason for the microchip alex you know in a computer the
[3:14:53.180 --> 3:14:57.100]  central processing unit the cpu that filters all the
[3:14:57.100 --> 3:15:00.380]  information traffic is a microchip if you at the
[3:15:00.380 --> 3:15:03.180]  reason they could they're talking now about having human
[3:15:03.180 --> 3:15:06.940]  um uh computer it's an electrochemical computer
[3:15:06.940 --> 3:15:11.820]  yeah because they're talking now about um uh connecting the human brain to a
[3:15:11.820 --> 3:15:14.700]  computer and you can work the computer through your thoughts is because
[3:15:14.700 --> 3:15:19.180]  they're connecting to computers one more sophisticated by
[3:15:19.180 --> 3:15:23.580]  stunning margin than the other but that's what they're doing so the idea is
[3:15:23.580 --> 3:15:27.100]  to attack the vehicle the computer on every level they can
[3:15:27.100 --> 3:15:31.900]  that includes and programming it through words and repetition of lies like
[3:15:31.900 --> 3:15:35.020]  bin laden was behind 9-11 and all this stuff
[3:15:35.020 --> 3:15:39.820]  and eventually repetition is a wonderful uh mind manipulation technique and
[3:15:39.820 --> 3:15:43.740]  programming technique and this computer then starts reading reality to fit the
[3:15:43.740 --> 3:15:46.380]  programming once you introduce consciousness
[3:15:46.380 --> 3:15:50.940]  those programs start to break down and that's when people start to wake up
[3:15:50.940 --> 3:15:56.620]  no i was just gonna agree with you and uh that's why when you study eugenics
[3:15:56.620 --> 3:15:59.180]  publicly they say it's about making the race better and getting rid of the bad
[3:15:59.180 --> 3:16:03.900]  but real eugenics at the phd level they say no we've got to mutate and dumb
[3:16:03.900 --> 3:16:07.820]  down the massive people so we in the future this is a hundred years ago
[3:16:07.820 --> 3:16:10.780]  uh you know all the top eugenicists and we put it in the film in game blueprint
[3:16:10.780 --> 3:16:14.380]  for global enslavement all the proof is a bibliography of it what is the in game
[3:16:14.380 --> 3:16:17.740]  dot com they say we really want to wreck humanity
[3:16:17.740 --> 3:16:20.780]  so we can greedily control it for ourselves
[3:16:20.780 --> 3:16:24.060]  because they'd rather rule in hell than serve in heaven
[3:16:24.060 --> 3:16:28.700]  i mean i'm exactly that and and so when you look at the uh
[3:16:28.700 --> 3:16:32.460]  the body computer on one level it is an electro chemical
[3:16:32.460 --> 3:16:37.260]  organism what are they bombarding us not least our kids with
[3:16:37.260 --> 3:16:42.300]  um chemical cocktails called soft drinks and food
[3:16:42.300 --> 3:16:48.700]  um electromagnetic and microwave uh uh uh attacks and pollution which we're
[3:16:48.700 --> 3:16:52.300]  we're living in and and and if you want to affect every every fish
[3:16:52.300 --> 3:16:55.980]  it won't go what you do you affect the sea then you've done it and they're
[3:16:55.980 --> 3:16:59.660]  affecting this energy field that we're living in in the lower levels
[3:16:59.660 --> 3:17:04.860]  uh around the earth which we which we can operate it as humans uh in in this
[3:17:04.860 --> 3:17:08.220]  world and they are infiltrating it with all this
[3:17:08.220 --> 3:17:13.900]  electromagnetic pollution which is designed to disrupt the ability of the
[3:17:13.900 --> 3:17:17.500]  computer to um access higher consciousness let me throw a
[3:17:17.500 --> 3:17:20.220]  point out electro chemically destabilize that's what it's all about
[3:17:20.220 --> 3:17:24.140]  let me throw a point out when you go out to southern utah and monument valley
[3:17:24.140 --> 3:17:27.180]  and there's nobody around you can be in your tent it's not just the beautiful
[3:17:27.180 --> 3:17:32.460]  vistas that you know raise the soul uh as as as people say
[3:17:32.460 --> 3:17:36.620]  or you make the soul soar it is that you are not around
[3:17:36.620 --> 3:17:41.740]  all the electrochemical uh pollution uh you are outside of that and you're
[3:17:41.740 --> 3:17:44.380]  also outside the pollution and they've proven this there's like
[3:17:44.380 --> 3:17:47.260]  wavelengths coming off the mind they broadcast
[3:17:47.260 --> 3:17:50.700]  all the program brains that are broadcasting the evil
[3:17:50.700 --> 3:17:53.980]  you're also away from those and it's the incredible piece
[3:17:53.980 --> 3:17:59.180]  of being out in the middle of nowhere yep uh you know the computer talks
[3:17:59.180 --> 3:18:04.060]  uh consciousness knows that's why we we go into the silence and you quiet in
[3:18:04.060 --> 3:18:07.660]  your mind you can get incredible insights that you can't when the mind
[3:18:07.660 --> 3:18:11.180]  chat is going because the computer mind chat and everybody stops everyone
[3:18:11.180 --> 3:18:13.180]  listening to this show will understand what i mean
[3:18:13.180 --> 3:18:15.900]  where the mind never shuts down it's always talking it's always trying to
[3:18:15.900 --> 3:18:19.260]  work things out it's always trying to create dramas or react into dramas and
[3:18:19.260 --> 3:18:22.300]  all the rest of it then when you go into a state some people call it meditation
[3:18:22.300 --> 3:18:25.340]  i don't meditate i daydream which i guess is a form of
[3:18:25.340 --> 3:18:27.980]  meditation but i don't sit cross-legged not least because i've got arthritis
[3:18:27.980 --> 3:18:30.060]  and i can't but i don't sit cross-legged meditate although
[3:18:30.060 --> 3:18:34.540]  you're good luck to those who do but but i i i let consciousness in by shutting
[3:18:34.540 --> 3:18:38.540]  the chatter down and he and and and what's happening you you you remember
[3:18:38.540 --> 3:18:42.540]  that uh uh that math mind control manual came to
[3:18:42.540 --> 3:18:46.380]  like quiet weapons for a silent weapons for a quiet war turn along zander
[3:18:46.380 --> 3:18:49.580]  yeah there was a line in that which was encapsulates what we're saying here is
[3:18:49.580 --> 3:18:53.340]  that keep them busy busy busy back on the farm with the runner up other animals
[3:18:53.340 --> 3:18:56.540]  they're trying to keep our minds occupied constantly
[3:18:56.540 --> 3:19:00.540]  because the mind chatter is occupied by that level of
[3:19:00.540 --> 3:19:04.140]  uh entertainment so we go on the television or what passes for it the
[3:19:04.140 --> 3:19:07.100]  news the televisions never on off the radios
[3:19:07.100 --> 3:19:10.860]  on all the time mind chatter mind chatter and that holds us in
[3:19:10.860 --> 3:19:14.860]  uh body consciousness reality because it's dealing with words which is a body
[3:19:14.860 --> 3:19:18.060]  consciousness uh decode okay david i want to ask you advice
[3:19:18.060 --> 3:19:21.900]  about myself personally i really respect you in this area
[3:19:21.900 --> 3:19:25.100]  in the behind the scenes internet only discussion at prison planet dot tv and
[3:19:25.100 --> 3:19:29.740]  the info wars exclusive streams right now for everybody else we ride back
[3:19:29.740 --> 3:19:33.420]  david every day i talk about this uh
[3:19:33.420 --> 3:19:36.780]  well i think about this and and and every week i talk about it on air
[3:19:36.780 --> 3:19:41.660]  right at 1am laying in bed or sitting you know on the couch at 10 o'clock at
[3:19:41.660 --> 3:19:45.980]  night when my wife and children are asleep i have just amazing insights i
[3:19:45.980 --> 3:19:49.340]  write it down on paper huge understandings about the new world order
[3:19:49.340 --> 3:19:53.100]  predictions that then come true understanding thousands of pieces of
[3:19:53.100 --> 3:19:57.020]  data that my subconscious whatever you want to call it is able to analyze
[3:19:57.020 --> 3:20:01.500]  and then when i get on air i can never articulate it with any of the depth i
[3:20:01.500 --> 3:20:05.580]  mean i do it to a great extent but but nothing like the true depth
[3:20:05.580 --> 3:20:09.900]  of that quiet time understanding and that tuning into everything
[3:20:09.900 --> 3:20:13.660]  and when i tune in to the you know the you know the huge you know universe
[3:20:13.660 --> 3:20:16.620]  i'm not worried about the new world order killing me i'm not worried about what's
[3:20:16.620 --> 3:20:19.660]  going to come and what's going to happen but then as soon as i shift back into
[3:20:19.660 --> 3:20:23.260]  battle mode you know then it seems like i'm more focused
[3:20:23.260 --> 3:20:27.100]  but i lose a lot of uh... my well frankly
[3:20:27.100 --> 3:20:30.300]  precious well that that that's that's interesting
[3:20:30.300 --> 3:20:34.060]  because um you know i know exactly exactly what you mean and what what what
[3:20:34.060 --> 3:20:38.140]  what i've been uh doing with myself over the last
[3:20:38.140 --> 3:20:42.140]  months and years is not going into battle mode because because that brings you
[3:20:42.140 --> 3:20:45.660]  into body consciousness uh... it doesn't mean you you you can't be
[3:20:45.660 --> 3:20:51.900]  just as passionate and just as uh... absolutely determined to to make a
[3:20:51.900 --> 3:20:55.100]  difference but when you go into battle mode that the body
[3:20:55.100 --> 3:20:57.580]  consciousness kicks in and body consciousness
[3:20:57.580 --> 3:21:01.340]  it has the ability to think for itself but it deals in words
[3:21:01.340 --> 3:21:05.260]  and we have simply because this understanding of who we are alex has
[3:21:05.260 --> 3:21:09.980]  been lost for so long we've not developed the language to describe
[3:21:09.980 --> 3:21:14.700]  what we know as a knowing on a higher consciousness level that's a knowing
[3:21:14.700 --> 3:21:18.220]  it's a knowing knowing it's a knowing and it's a knowing because you're dealing
[3:21:18.220 --> 3:21:21.820]  with consciousness that knows the reason that you you hear
[3:21:21.820 --> 3:21:24.300]  silence when you go into higher consciousness
[3:21:24.300 --> 3:21:28.620]  is because higher consciousness knows it doesn't have to work it out through
[3:21:28.620 --> 3:21:31.740]  constant chatter what if it says or what if it's that it knows
[3:21:31.740 --> 3:21:34.540]  and then when you come back into body consciousness that's what the world does
[3:21:34.540 --> 3:21:37.820]  it pulls you in absolutely but from a genetic expression
[3:21:37.820 --> 3:21:42.540]  uh... you know they now know that it's not what you call reincarnation
[3:21:42.540 --> 3:21:45.900]  it is all those millions of people that came before you all that genetic
[3:21:45.900 --> 3:21:49.740]  information passed on we really are using a hundred percent of the brain
[3:21:49.740 --> 3:21:53.340]  not ten percent like the scientists say it's just that we normally are only
[3:21:53.340 --> 3:21:56.940]  consciously using ten percent there is so much more it is a
[3:21:56.940 --> 3:22:00.620]  species knowledge and a species memory
[3:22:00.620 --> 3:22:03.340]  that wants to go to the stars i tell you what they've done
[3:22:03.340 --> 3:22:06.380]  and there's no better symbol symbol of what they've done
[3:22:06.380 --> 3:22:10.460]  to the human computer than china if you go on the internet in china
[3:22:10.460 --> 3:22:13.980]  this vast amount of the internet you cannot access because it's firewalled
[3:22:13.980 --> 3:22:17.980]  off that's what they've done and we as we open the firewalls as
[3:22:17.980 --> 3:22:20.300]  consciousness intervenes then we start to see
[3:22:20.300 --> 3:22:22.940]  you're not talking about the internet for folks that just tuned in
[3:22:22.940 --> 3:22:27.180]  you're saying the consciousness is like a chinese internet where 90% of it
[3:22:27.180 --> 3:22:31.500]  is walled off curtailed surveilled and and and people through the panopticon
[3:22:31.500 --> 3:22:34.620]  self-surveil and restrict themselves in china
[3:22:34.620 --> 3:22:38.860]  yeah what i'm saying is uh... that the body computer even though it's just a
[3:22:38.860 --> 3:22:41.660]  vehicle uh... it's a fantastic vehicle and it
[3:22:41.660 --> 3:22:45.260]  it has potentially the ability to decode
[3:22:45.260 --> 3:22:50.060]  far more than it does but what they've done i think there's been genetic
[3:22:50.060 --> 3:22:53.180]  intervention through the through the thousands of years and many other
[3:22:53.180 --> 3:22:57.340]  things they have firewalled off and it and what
[3:22:57.340 --> 3:23:00.460]  this is an interesting point given what we've been talking about what does the
[3:23:00.460 --> 3:23:03.660]  hypnotist do i've seen a hypnotist say to someone
[3:23:03.660 --> 3:23:07.740]  okay um i'm gonna ask you your name and you're not going to be able to know it
[3:23:07.740 --> 3:23:11.900]  you're not going to know your name and he says the key word and he asked them
[3:23:11.900 --> 3:23:14.140]  their name they can't remember their name
[3:23:14.140 --> 3:23:19.180]  um because he's firewalled off that ability to decode their name
[3:23:19.180 --> 3:23:23.260]  so when you think what they're doing in china with the if you like the worldwide
[3:23:23.260 --> 3:23:26.380]  web internet where chinese people can't access
[3:23:26.380 --> 3:23:29.580]  fast chunks of it because they don't want
[3:23:29.580 --> 3:23:32.860]  the chinese authorities don't want the people to see what exists there in terms
[3:23:32.860 --> 3:23:37.020]  of information the the elite the shadowed people that
[3:23:37.020 --> 3:23:40.620]  understand this uh reality they have done the same they have
[3:23:40.620 --> 3:23:44.860]  firewalled off the human computer system as through the various techniques they
[3:23:44.860 --> 3:23:49.100]  use so we don't decode vast amounts of reality even when
[3:23:49.100 --> 3:23:54.860]  within this reality that we're back we're back live here we go
[3:23:54.860 --> 3:23:59.180]  all right the time's almost up with david i i might be able to twist his arm
[3:23:59.180 --> 3:24:02.380]  for 10 minutes more into overdrive with david i doubt it
[3:24:02.380 --> 3:24:06.940]  there's so much he wants to talk about i want to know about why the elite
[3:24:06.940 --> 3:24:09.900]  who are aware of all of this like to get into the darkness
[3:24:09.900 --> 3:24:13.340]  and why they're reveling that in some of the rituals they do i mean now macy's
[3:24:13.340 --> 3:24:18.780]  has come out with 666 knights of hell bohemian grove where it says bohemian
[3:24:18.780 --> 3:24:21.340]  grove on it it's using official bohemian grove
[3:24:21.340 --> 3:24:24.780]  logos macy's nationwide it's up on info wars
[3:24:24.780 --> 3:24:27.420]  dot com i i want to get into that and then anything else
[3:24:27.420 --> 3:24:30.860]  you want to cover david and then take a few phone calls at 1 800
[3:24:30.860 --> 3:24:35.900]  2 5 9 9 2 3 1 but everything you say makes all these other ideas and thoughts
[3:24:35.900 --> 3:24:39.740]  i've already had but at a deeper level start exploding that's why i'm jumping
[3:24:39.740 --> 3:24:42.300]  in but i want you to have a chance to really run
[3:24:42.300 --> 3:24:46.220]  so i i'm just going to literally turn my mic off and step back we're going to
[3:24:46.220 --> 3:24:49.980]  skip this next break for the internet for everybody else will be right back
[3:24:49.980 --> 3:24:53.500]  and and just you've got the floor run with it
[3:24:53.500 --> 3:24:57.500]  well first of all um in terms of where we're going with this
[3:24:57.500 --> 3:25:04.540]  um we need to um get a blank sheet of paper and i'm not talking as some
[3:25:04.540 --> 3:25:09.100]  guru who's um on a mountain and and telling you how to do it
[3:25:09.100 --> 3:25:13.500]  um i'm telling you what's what's what happened to me over the last 20 years
[3:25:13.500 --> 3:25:19.500]  and when you it's a simple thing alex but my goodness me is it powerful in
[3:25:19.500 --> 3:25:23.740]  in how it pans out and plays out in changes in your life and everything
[3:25:23.740 --> 3:25:27.980]  once you look in the mirror and you you you uh
[3:25:27.980 --> 3:25:32.060]  identify what you are looking at with the vehicle that's allowing you to
[3:25:32.060 --> 3:25:35.100]  experience this this frequency range we call the world
[3:25:35.100 --> 3:25:39.660]  and you move your sense of identity to i am infinite consciousness
[3:25:39.660 --> 3:25:42.620]  i am all that is has been and ever will be
[3:25:42.620 --> 3:25:47.100]  uh not the time exists outside of this uh this this reality it's another
[3:25:47.100 --> 3:25:51.740]  figment of our manipulated imagination and uh do and programming
[3:25:51.740 --> 3:25:56.620]  once you move your sense of identity out to that level of self
[3:25:56.620 --> 3:26:00.220]  everything changes i mean you know uh uh
[3:26:00.220 --> 3:26:02.540]  fearful of what some government's going to do
[3:26:02.540 --> 3:26:08.540]  fearful of the consequences of um of taking action in pursuit of freedom i
[3:26:08.540 --> 3:26:11.580]  mean you know that level of consciousness which
[3:26:11.580 --> 3:26:16.300]  you know which is a level of love which is beyond our comprehension it's not
[3:26:16.300 --> 3:26:19.260]  it's not i love you darling saw you down the disco
[3:26:19.260 --> 3:26:22.940]  that level of love is an attraction actually can be manipulated that
[3:26:22.940 --> 3:26:25.820]  chemically if you stimulate certain chemicals in the brain
[3:26:25.820 --> 3:26:30.380]  that's attraction i i was in the uh a half kind of wake
[3:26:30.380 --> 3:26:34.540]  state waking up the other day and going around my head was this statement
[3:26:34.540 --> 3:26:38.460]  love is not what you are in i'm in love with you
[3:26:38.460 --> 3:26:42.860]  love is what you are and at that level that level of love the true definition
[3:26:42.860 --> 3:26:46.860]  of love not attraction but love for all love for self
[3:26:46.860 --> 3:26:53.980]  um it has um no fear it only does not what it believes to be right it
[3:26:53.980 --> 3:26:59.260]  does what it knows to be right and it chooses freedom and freedom and love
[3:26:59.260 --> 3:27:03.340]  do not do consequences there's no mental gymnastics oh i want
[3:27:03.340 --> 3:27:07.660]  freedom but what are the consequences for me of of going down there
[3:27:07.660 --> 3:27:10.860]  freedom doesn't do consequences love doesn't do consequences it does what
[3:27:10.860 --> 3:27:14.700]  it believes to be right and i tell you what um when we get to this level of
[3:27:14.700 --> 3:27:18.620]  consciousness alex um something that would change this world
[3:27:18.620 --> 3:27:21.420]  overnight because of all that would come from it
[3:27:21.420 --> 3:27:27.260]  if people started making decisions not based on what is right for me in the
[3:27:27.260 --> 3:27:30.700]  circumstances before me and and that turns out often not to be
[3:27:30.700 --> 3:27:35.420]  right for you anyway but what is right end of story in the
[3:27:35.420 --> 3:27:40.940]  circumstances that i face what is right what is just what is fair
[3:27:40.940 --> 3:27:45.260]  what what what do i need to do to pursue that version of what is right
[3:27:45.260 --> 3:27:49.100]  and if we did that there'd be no hunger there'd be no conflict there'd be no
[3:27:49.100 --> 3:27:52.300]  child abuse there'd be no environmental abuse there'd be there'd be
[3:27:52.300 --> 3:27:56.060]  none of this stuff we'd be in a completely different level of
[3:27:56.060 --> 3:27:59.580]  consciousness and therefore we'd be in a different completely different level
[3:27:59.580 --> 3:28:03.420]  of experiences of this world as albert einstein said
[3:28:03.420 --> 3:28:08.860]  you cannot solve problems with the same level of consciousness that created them
[3:28:08.860 --> 3:28:11.660]  and because we've got caught in body consciousness
[3:28:11.660 --> 3:28:16.460]  and not the high soul consciousness if you like that we really are
[3:28:16.460 --> 3:28:20.460]  therefore we bring a political party in with a certain level of
[3:28:20.460 --> 3:28:23.980]  consciousness and we replace it with another with the same level of consciousness
[3:28:23.980 --> 3:28:27.660]  we interact with the world with the same level of consciousness
[3:28:27.660 --> 3:28:30.940]  and then we wonder why the world never changes for the better
[3:28:30.940 --> 3:28:34.780]  because the same level of consciousness that is creating the problems
[3:28:34.780 --> 3:28:38.540]  then returns to create more problems we have to move
[3:28:38.540 --> 3:28:41.900]  into an expanded level of awareness of who we are
[3:28:41.900 --> 3:28:45.740]  the nature of reality the illusory nature of reality that we live in
[3:28:45.740 --> 3:28:50.140]  and then we can have a paradise here because illusions only control you
[3:28:50.140 --> 3:28:53.580]  when you think they're real and that's the key to this conspiracy
[3:28:53.580 --> 3:28:57.500]  it's been persuading people that this illusion that we're interacting with
[3:28:57.500 --> 3:29:01.980]  and we can have great fun and joy with is actually real and
[3:29:01.980 --> 3:29:06.700]  once you get you you buy that one you're in body consciousness
[3:29:06.700 --> 3:29:11.340]  and you're in the slammer and we're at a time now with this awakening
[3:29:11.340 --> 3:29:16.300]  when when we can open the door and and transform this world got a break stay
[3:29:16.300 --> 3:29:19.820]  there David i'll talk to you during the break
[3:29:20.860 --> 3:29:25.500]  uh David i don't want to turn this into a massive extravaganza
[3:29:25.500 --> 3:29:28.060]  but i tell you what you want to go into the dark stuff i'll tell you about that
[3:29:28.060 --> 3:29:31.980]  well well well the thing is it well i mean i i know that you've got a lot of
[3:29:31.980 --> 3:29:35.820]  things to do but uh i would love and i i promise
[3:29:35.820 --> 3:29:38.380]  you we would end it then and also give you a break later
[3:29:38.380 --> 3:29:41.420]  what if we did 20 minutes into the next hour
[3:29:41.420 --> 3:29:45.340]  uh the show normally ends in 30 but but but what if we did another
[3:29:45.340 --> 3:29:49.820]  you know 40 50 minutes a total 15 20 minutes into the next hour
[3:29:49.820 --> 3:29:53.100]  because then there'd be no breaks and it would be internet only but but still
[3:29:53.100 --> 3:29:56.940]  massive uh so that we would have plenty of time to really let you flesh out
[3:29:56.940 --> 3:30:00.060]  your ideas and then take some phone calls and
[3:30:00.060 --> 3:30:03.740]  you know talk about solutions or do you want to end this in t-minus 30 minutes
[3:30:03.740 --> 3:30:06.860]  i tell i tell him i told him i'd love to do it alex but i've got to be in
[3:30:06.860 --> 3:30:10.620]  nevada city um uh in the time it takes from
[3:30:10.620 --> 3:30:14.300]  uh one o'clock to get there that's my problem what time do you have to be in
[3:30:14.300 --> 3:30:17.100]  nevada city um it is i've got to be in nevada
[3:30:17.100 --> 3:30:21.180]  city by uh just before two o'clock i'm meeting a guy
[3:30:21.180 --> 3:30:24.780]  funnily enough um who is he's a doctor that who has
[3:30:24.780 --> 3:30:27.100]  understood that the body's a hologram and i am
[3:30:27.100 --> 3:30:31.260]  it is this great information waiting for me there well i hope you'll come back
[3:30:31.260 --> 3:30:34.300]  soon and tell us about that no problem well then well then we'll talk a little
[3:30:34.300 --> 3:30:37.660]  bit more and then jam in some phone calls uh before you leave us and i
[3:30:37.660 --> 3:30:41.340]  appreciate you giving us the uh the uh two hours
[3:30:41.340 --> 3:30:43.900]  no problem if you want to get into the dark stuff in the ritual i talk about
[3:30:43.900 --> 3:30:45.980]  that and because it's so so relates to what we
[3:30:45.980 --> 3:30:50.300]  well i wanted to talk about the the the uh
[3:30:50.300 --> 3:30:53.820]  you know the the the different levels of consciousness because you talk about
[3:30:53.820 --> 3:30:57.580]  what doing what is right when i'm calm when i'm centered
[3:30:57.580 --> 3:31:01.340]  again i'm not worried about them killing me i i realized fighting them and
[3:31:01.340 --> 3:31:05.580]  standing up to them and my instinct or my guts my spirit tells me
[3:31:05.580 --> 3:31:09.740]  yeah uh even let them kill me uh because you know
[3:31:09.740 --> 3:31:14.860]  that will only expose them greater and that
[3:31:14.860 --> 3:31:19.500]  but then i hear a beeping going on
[3:31:19.740 --> 3:31:24.540]  john do you know what's going on there i don't hear anything
[3:31:24.540 --> 3:31:28.300]  okay i just went away we we got it here on the network side uh david you're still
[3:31:28.300 --> 3:31:32.060]  there it's like but but but then when i get back into battle mode the daily
[3:31:32.060 --> 3:31:35.020]  mode which is what i have to shift into to be able to operate
[3:31:35.020 --> 3:31:39.180]  yeah you know i'm not as worried i mean i'm i'm still a little bit worried
[3:31:39.180 --> 3:31:43.580]  about it you know not i'm just not completely at peace and then
[3:31:43.580 --> 3:31:47.020]  you talk about uh you know consciousness the problem
[3:31:47.020 --> 3:31:51.500]  is the corrupt elite system is like a cancer
[3:31:51.500 --> 3:31:54.780]  exactly and and and so no matter how many of us
[3:31:54.780 --> 3:31:58.220]  are good and sweet and loving and do the right thing which i try to do every day
[3:31:58.220 --> 3:32:02.380]  we still have to stamp out and stand up against corrupt people in our lives
[3:32:02.380 --> 3:32:05.340]  or they will chew us to pieces i want you to explain
[3:32:05.340 --> 3:32:09.180]  you know yeah well i'm not saying lie down and say walk well over me i'm saying
[3:32:09.180 --> 3:32:13.340]  the exact opposite but just don't stand up against them in a
[3:32:13.340 --> 3:32:17.100]  hateful way do it yeah do it from a point of love and
[3:32:17.100 --> 3:32:22.620]  i'm sorry i have to do this yep well yeah or even more than that i am doing
[3:32:22.620 --> 3:32:26.620]  this okay end of story and and what what getting to those
[3:32:26.620 --> 3:32:29.980]  high states of consciousness does it takes the fear out of it stay there
[3:32:29.980 --> 3:32:33.580]  consequences out of it and you just do it they were going like back to the full
[3:32:33.580 --> 3:32:36.380]  audience here we go
[3:32:37.580 --> 3:32:43.420]  david i start gas we got about 27 minutes left with him today
[3:32:43.420 --> 3:32:46.300]  i think i'm gonna go ahead and myself david can't stay with us but i'm gonna
[3:32:46.300 --> 3:32:50.220]  go into overdrive at info wars dot com for 20 minutes you're good to do that
[3:32:50.220 --> 3:32:54.060]  uh paul because i want to cover what's happening with the markets
[3:32:54.060 --> 3:32:58.380]  after david leaves us um but i do want to take some time out to take some calls
[3:32:58.380 --> 3:33:03.180]  before the show ends as well but david during the break when we were
[3:33:03.180 --> 3:33:07.260]  still talking for the internet audience on prism planet on tv
[3:33:07.260 --> 3:33:12.140]  we were discussing um you know i was saying well the elite are like a cancer
[3:33:12.140 --> 3:33:15.660]  though they understand this they've decided to be dark and evil
[3:33:15.660 --> 3:33:18.940]  and to shutter the you know the souls of humanity because it makes them more
[3:33:18.940 --> 3:33:22.620]  easily manageable and they get and and they revel in
[3:33:22.620 --> 3:33:25.260]  darkness and i can't imagine having the knowledge of
[3:33:25.260 --> 3:33:28.460]  the wonders of being good and being loving and you know doing all that and
[3:33:28.460 --> 3:33:32.540]  then making the conscious decision to be dark and wicked
[3:33:32.540 --> 3:33:35.820]  so so so why are they doing that and as good guys
[3:33:35.820 --> 3:33:40.140]  how do we stand up against them well that they are they are locked
[3:33:40.140 --> 3:33:45.980]  um into uh such a depth of their own body consciousness
[3:33:45.980 --> 3:33:51.180]  that um they that's why and there's there's other connections to that um
[3:33:51.180 --> 3:33:56.220]  but they're so locked into that level of reality that that's why they're so good
[3:33:56.220 --> 3:34:00.700]  at manipulating it right they're almost like uh uh
[3:34:00.700 --> 3:34:04.380]  soulless beings who who who who who have lost
[3:34:04.380 --> 3:34:07.980]  such contact with these higher levels of awareness that
[3:34:07.980 --> 3:34:12.300]  basically if you look at the way they operate they operate through intellect
[3:34:12.300 --> 3:34:16.060]  they are very very clever but they have absolutely
[3:34:16.060 --> 3:34:20.060]  no wisdom and cleverness without wisdom is the most destructive force on earth
[3:34:20.060 --> 3:34:23.820]  so they're coming from an intellectual level which is
[3:34:23.820 --> 3:34:26.940]  a body consciousness level because the intellect thinks and
[3:34:26.940 --> 3:34:30.860]  and works things out it's not that that higher knowing that we've talked about
[3:34:30.860 --> 3:34:34.540]  and they're so stuck in it that um uh that they have
[3:34:34.540 --> 3:34:39.660]  lost touch with a key self-balancing mechanism which is empathy
[3:34:39.660 --> 3:34:44.220]  they have no empathy and and because they have no empathy they have no
[3:34:44.220 --> 3:34:47.900]  emotional consequences for what they do to people so
[3:34:47.900 --> 3:34:51.660]  3 000 people on 9 11 hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dead and
[3:34:51.660 --> 3:34:56.140]  maimed civilians in iraq we couldn't do that because we have
[3:34:56.140 --> 3:35:01.100]  empathy we have this this emotional feeling for the consequences for others
[3:35:01.100 --> 3:35:05.020]  of our actions when you don't have them there are no limits and that's why they
[3:35:05.020 --> 3:35:07.340]  act like they do and it's why i've been saying for years
[3:35:07.340 --> 3:35:11.500]  if you see um what they would do on the basis of what you would do then you've
[3:35:11.500 --> 3:35:14.860]  lost the plot because they're not the same because of what what i've been
[3:35:14.860 --> 3:35:18.700]  talking about and they are i mean i know i've had lots of
[3:35:18.700 --> 3:35:21.820]  ridicule and also over the years i've had lots of ridicule but many things i don't
[3:35:21.820 --> 3:35:25.900]  care um what is what is but you know these people
[3:35:25.900 --> 3:35:29.100]  interact on a on a what could i could human level
[3:35:29.100 --> 3:35:33.580]  with entities that operate just outside of visible light
[3:35:33.580 --> 3:35:37.740]  you know as i said right at the start of this chat today um i'm sitting here in
[3:35:37.740 --> 3:35:40.620]  california and all the television and radio stations
[3:35:40.620 --> 3:35:43.340]  broadcast in california sharing the same space that i'm
[3:35:43.340 --> 3:35:46.940]  i'm uh uh sharing they're not on top of each other like a chest of drawers
[3:35:46.940 --> 3:35:50.140]  they're sharing the same space because they're vibrating at different speeds
[3:35:50.140 --> 3:35:54.460]  now when you get to uh stations that are very close to each other
[3:35:54.460 --> 3:35:58.620]  they're close enough for interference uh interference symbolic of
[3:35:58.620 --> 3:36:04.140]  interaction and uh these um entities that these people worship in their
[3:36:04.140 --> 3:36:10.460]  stupid second uh horrific rituals um are to interact with these entities that
[3:36:10.460 --> 3:36:13.900]  operate just outside of visible light just outside of
[3:36:13.900 --> 3:36:17.420]  human sight and and and what these entities do is they
[3:36:17.420 --> 3:36:20.940]  feed off low vibrational human energy which is
[3:36:20.940 --> 3:36:25.500]  fear stress all these different expressions of low vibrational energy
[3:36:25.500 --> 3:36:28.860]  and this alex is where the age old term
[3:36:28.860 --> 3:36:32.060]  of sacrificing young virgins to the gods comes from
[3:36:32.060 --> 3:36:35.820]  what are young virgins um symbolic of in that term
[3:36:35.820 --> 3:36:40.380]  prepubescent children i've understood this by talking to people who've taken
[3:36:40.380 --> 3:36:44.060]  part in these things uh overwhelmingly against their will
[3:36:44.060 --> 3:36:49.900]  um what what these entities do is they are there at the ritual and they put
[3:36:49.900 --> 3:36:53.420]  these uh children and and and other people too through
[3:36:53.420 --> 3:36:56.460]  horrific rituals and they build them up to a state of
[3:36:56.460 --> 3:37:01.340]  absolute terror and this is releasing this
[3:37:01.340 --> 3:37:07.020]  really uh a low vibrational energy energy of terror and it also
[3:37:07.020 --> 3:37:11.020]  um puts an adrenaline in the bloodstream which which which the
[3:37:11.020 --> 3:37:15.980]  human elite drink like a nectar so when they do the sacrifice
[3:37:15.980 --> 3:37:20.380]  the entity or entities that they're doing the ritual for which have
[3:37:20.380 --> 3:37:24.780]  you know various names in different parts of the world they
[3:37:24.780 --> 3:37:30.140]  absorb this energy like like like like a energetic sustenance to them
[3:37:30.140 --> 3:37:34.220]  while the uh human level of it they drink the blood which has this adrenaline
[3:37:34.220 --> 3:37:38.620]  in and and this is this is one reason there are many other reasons why
[3:37:38.620 --> 3:37:41.820]  they uh do these rituals and so a math
[3:37:41.820 --> 3:37:48.780]  uh uh creation of this energy um a math uh uh version of this ritual we call
[3:37:48.780 --> 3:37:51.820]  wars we call credit crunches and banking
[3:37:51.820 --> 3:37:55.740]  collapses because of all the stress and fear energy
[3:37:55.740 --> 3:37:59.260]  that is released by the the people in in the face of these
[3:37:59.260 --> 3:38:02.780]  things so they're on one level it's not the only reason they do it but on one
[3:38:02.780 --> 3:38:08.220]  level they're manipulating um these uh fearful stress
[3:38:08.220 --> 3:38:13.580]  creating terror creating events to actually elicit at energy low
[3:38:13.580 --> 3:38:17.660]  vibrational energy from the people why so it's not just that they're evil and
[3:38:17.660 --> 3:38:20.700]  enjoy it it is a psychic war and they're
[3:38:20.700 --> 3:38:24.300]  polluting everything with gloom and doom yeah they're bringing every seat
[3:38:24.300 --> 3:38:28.300]  well as i said earlier they they they are massively locked into
[3:38:28.300 --> 3:38:33.980]  low low low vibrational consciousness there is almost no um a light there at
[3:38:33.980 --> 3:38:37.900]  all and that's why they act like they do they complete this you know you know
[3:38:37.900 --> 3:38:41.980]  the we've had this age-old uh uh thematics through the centuries and
[3:38:41.980 --> 3:38:45.180]  thousands of years right across the world in ancient accounts about the
[3:38:45.180 --> 3:38:48.940]  soulless ones that's what we're talking about and and it you know christians
[3:38:48.940 --> 3:38:53.180]  would talk about demonic entities this and the muslims would talk about the
[3:38:53.180 --> 3:38:56.300]  gins and stuff these are all different names for the same thing we're talking
[3:38:56.300 --> 3:38:59.260]  about here well i've talked to top psychologist
[3:38:59.260 --> 3:39:03.020]  who study the serial killers and they describe it as if they're dead
[3:39:03.020 --> 3:39:07.420]  they have no emotion nothing in life but there's like a burning light
[3:39:07.420 --> 3:39:11.820]  they only feel alive while they're torturing a child while they're doing
[3:39:11.820 --> 3:39:16.460]  something particularly horrible and so they become total slaves to it
[3:39:16.460 --> 3:39:20.460]  yeah and they're also slaves to something else they're slaves to these entities
[3:39:20.460 --> 3:39:24.940]  now this this is another important thing to to start connecting some dots here
[3:39:24.940 --> 3:39:30.700]  why are odd is this human elite obsessed with interbreeding
[3:39:30.700 --> 3:39:35.420]  because if with it with each other and not into breeding outside of itself
[3:39:35.420 --> 3:39:39.900]  because if you really break it down to the level that we're talking about today
[3:39:39.900 --> 3:39:42.780]  uh alex well the egyptians said they were gods and
[3:39:42.780 --> 3:39:46.540]  they had to keep that bloodline in the family yeah but what what what's the
[3:39:46.540 --> 3:39:50.300]  obsession with bloodline it is this keeping the money together when when you
[3:39:50.300 --> 3:39:55.340]  um uh procreate you are in effect downloading
[3:39:55.340 --> 3:40:00.860]  two hard drives called dna and whatever onto one hydro hard drive which we call
[3:40:00.860 --> 3:40:04.860]  the new child body computer the child is consciousness the child's body is a
[3:40:04.860 --> 3:40:09.100]  computer like everyone else now that means that these
[3:40:09.100 --> 3:40:13.580]  um bloodlines when they interbreed what they're holding
[3:40:13.580 --> 3:40:18.300]  is in effect a software program a certain vibrational
[3:40:18.300 --> 3:40:23.500]  field which is the fusion of the two aspects of the same genetic line i.e.
[3:40:23.500 --> 3:40:26.780]  the same uh you know aristocracy or royal family whatever
[3:40:26.780 --> 3:40:35.420]  now this means hello no sorry go ahead yeah this means that uh the uh
[3:40:35.420 --> 3:40:39.740]  the elite bloodlines in physical form within this reality
[3:40:39.740 --> 3:40:43.580]  they are vibrating to a particular frequency
[3:40:43.580 --> 3:40:50.460]  which because it's a hybrid um is uh has a vibrational sympathy with these
[3:40:50.460 --> 3:40:54.300]  entities operating just outside of visible light human
[3:40:54.300 --> 3:41:01.180]  site and therefore that vibrational uh connection allows these particular
[3:41:01.180 --> 3:41:05.020]  bloodlines to be possessed another ancient theme
[3:41:05.020 --> 3:41:09.100]  right up to the present day by these entities much more powerfully and
[3:41:09.100 --> 3:41:12.700]  efficiently in terms of controlling their mental and emotional processes
[3:41:12.700 --> 3:41:16.140]  than do they can with the rest of the population
[3:41:16.140 --> 3:41:21.100]  and so this is the key alex you've got a you've got a a human bloodline which is
[3:41:21.100 --> 3:41:24.220]  which is a hybrid bloodline with a certain type of dna which they
[3:41:24.220 --> 3:41:27.660]  interbreed incessantly and have over the centuries to hold
[3:41:27.660 --> 3:41:30.940]  this allows a vibrational connection with these entities which allows the
[3:41:30.940 --> 3:41:35.420]  possession of these uh the human forms by these non-human entities
[3:41:35.420 --> 3:41:38.620]  and and what then you've got the secret society network
[3:41:38.620 --> 3:41:42.860]  which manipulates these are human elite bloodlines that we talk constantly
[3:41:42.860 --> 3:41:45.740]  about into the positions of power and indeed in
[3:41:45.740 --> 3:41:49.740]  their gophers into the positions of power and what we're actually doing
[3:41:49.740 --> 3:41:53.580]  is putting or they're doing is putting these entities
[3:41:53.580 --> 3:41:57.100]  into those positions of power but because we look at them
[3:41:57.100 --> 3:42:02.540]  with our five cent site we decode only the human level so that's all we see
[3:42:02.540 --> 3:42:06.700]  but if you could tease out your visual acuity and see
[3:42:06.700 --> 3:42:09.900]  a wider range of frequencies as you look at these people
[3:42:09.900 --> 3:42:13.260]  you would see anything but a human entity overshadowing it
[3:42:13.260 --> 3:42:17.820]  this is how they've done it and and and this is what these bloodlines are about
[3:42:17.820 --> 3:42:21.420]  having vibrational compatibility with these entities which they worship
[3:42:21.420 --> 3:42:25.020]  these gods that they worship
[3:42:25.020 --> 3:42:28.460]  well and i know the elite believes that when i was at bohemian girl people
[3:42:28.460 --> 3:42:32.060]  could say oh it's just a play i was there with a thousand plus members
[3:42:32.060 --> 3:42:34.460]  watching the ritual they were grinding their teeth
[3:42:34.460 --> 3:42:38.300]  they were in in religious rapture they did some other ritual over behind the
[3:42:38.300 --> 3:42:41.980]  trees that was the real ritual and they did the mock human sacrifice
[3:42:41.980 --> 3:42:44.620]  of the child and that's in their own literature
[3:42:44.620 --> 3:42:49.020]  now macy's has come out with all of this bohemian grove
[3:42:49.020 --> 3:42:55.260]  the knights of the illuminati 666 you know the uh uh uh you know the hell
[3:42:55.260 --> 3:42:58.700]  group i mean now they're really throwing it in our face
[3:42:58.700 --> 3:43:02.700]  and we always know that through the popular fashions they telegraph
[3:43:02.700 --> 3:43:06.300]  what's coming in the future why are we seeing all the skulls and death and now
[3:43:06.300 --> 3:43:10.300]  illuminati clothing yeah because um you know they
[3:43:10.300 --> 3:43:15.420]  they understand because they are so entrapped in computer level reality
[3:43:15.420 --> 3:43:19.820]  um they understand this stadium um and so what they're doing is
[3:43:19.820 --> 3:43:23.500]  is is trying to pull all the time as we talked about in this
[3:43:23.500 --> 3:43:26.700]  uh in this chat today they're trying to pull humanity
[3:43:26.700 --> 3:43:30.700]  into a sense of reality that operates in the same stadium and that's what the
[3:43:30.700 --> 3:43:33.420]  roman coliseum's are all about the blood and death
[3:43:33.420 --> 3:43:36.860]  yeah i tell you what uh alex they are
[3:43:36.860 --> 3:43:41.740]  absolutely terrified of this awakening which they
[3:43:41.740 --> 3:43:44.940]  they they knew was coming and they know is now here
[3:43:44.940 --> 3:43:49.500]  they're terrified of it and they're desperately pushing this agenda forward
[3:43:49.500 --> 3:43:54.060]  not least the microchip to to to because the the real idea of the microchip
[3:43:54.060 --> 3:43:57.740]  yes it's for electronic tagging and the computer knows where everyone is yes
[3:43:57.740 --> 3:44:01.500]  but i've been given chapter in verse uh by a cAA scientist about this
[3:44:01.500 --> 3:44:05.100]  there's something many years ago now 10 years in fact 1997 98
[3:44:05.100 --> 3:44:09.980]  uh the idea is to hijack the body computer through the uh
[3:44:09.980 --> 3:44:13.180]  the microchip so they can externally manipulate us
[3:44:13.180 --> 3:44:16.780]  vibrationally physically mentally and emotionally from a distance
[3:44:16.780 --> 3:44:20.940]  either on mass or isolating us as individuals and the reason that they
[3:44:20.940 --> 3:44:24.700]  but there's many reasons for the same thing but a major major reason
[3:44:24.700 --> 3:44:29.340]  for wanting a world dna database is because we all vibrate
[3:44:29.340 --> 3:44:32.940]  although we vibrate within certain frequency range we always all vibrate
[3:44:32.940 --> 3:44:38.780]  on our own unique signal as well and if you know someone's dna through the
[3:44:38.780 --> 3:44:42.380]  technology they have they can work out that unique signal and target it that
[3:44:42.380 --> 3:44:46.300]  this is this all it is what it's all the whole conspiracy kind of comes down to
[3:44:46.300 --> 3:44:48.460]  in the end and everything else is playing it out
[3:44:48.460 --> 3:44:51.580]  well we knew that from the army plan that was
[3:44:51.580 --> 3:44:55.740]  written up in the 80s to classified in 2000 in uh
[3:44:55.740 --> 3:44:59.500]  in february we know in there that the army says
[3:44:59.500 --> 3:45:03.900]  that through fads through security through prisoners through all simers
[3:45:03.900 --> 3:45:07.260]  patients and through having law enforcement be forced to take
[3:45:07.260 --> 3:45:10.300]  chips they could then force the public to do it and now if you want to be a
[3:45:10.300 --> 3:45:14.300]  fighter pilot you're going to have to have it that's openly mainstream news
[3:45:14.300 --> 3:45:17.740]  uh they are preparing the public that if you want to have a job
[3:45:17.740 --> 3:45:20.620]  you're going to have to have basically this little wire port
[3:45:20.620 --> 3:45:25.340]  into your brain and and the army says that by 2025
[3:45:25.340 --> 3:45:29.020]  all of us will be this is what they say this is where the movie the matrix
[3:45:29.020 --> 3:45:33.420]  came from was from the exactly from the DARPA reports
[3:45:33.420 --> 3:45:37.980]  the this is my book to set into tyranny they say that they're going to put us
[3:45:37.980 --> 3:45:44.780]  all in tanks to be in the hive mind so that movie is the plan
[3:45:44.780 --> 3:45:48.460]  well the hive mind is something i've been writing about for a long long time
[3:45:48.460 --> 3:45:52.460]  and uh you can only put people because you know when i talk about you know
[3:45:52.460 --> 3:45:55.740]  infinite consciousness i'm not talking about everyone being a clone and
[3:45:55.740 --> 3:45:59.660]  acting the same infinite consciousness is infinite possibility
[3:45:59.660 --> 3:46:03.660]  yeah tied into the tied into the bigger picture not not not into the narrow
[3:46:03.660 --> 3:46:07.900]  band but but but yeah but david my point is you're not just saying this
[3:46:07.900 --> 3:46:12.540]  the official army prospectus says they want this is the plan
[3:46:12.540 --> 3:46:16.940]  for full spectrum dominance because there'll be no more war will all be safe
[3:46:16.940 --> 3:46:20.460]  if we're in these tanks you can't make stuff up
[3:46:20.460 --> 3:46:23.980]  that weird and then last year the british 10-year prospectus talked about
[3:46:23.980 --> 3:46:29.660]  having a neutron bomb us if we resist them having to kill masses of us
[3:46:29.660 --> 3:46:32.860]  flash mobs i mean i mean people think david ick is
[3:46:32.860 --> 3:46:36.540]  weird or off the charts if you read what DARPA
[3:46:36.540 --> 3:46:40.220]  and the pentagon and their head futurist mr marshall are saying
[3:46:40.220 --> 3:46:44.140]  it's all even stranger than david ick oh yeah i i mean you know
[3:46:44.140 --> 3:46:48.060]  either the rabbit hole goes much deeper than any of us have got yet but
[3:46:48.060 --> 3:46:52.460]  the thing is alexa is you were saying um as i was and i was pointing out the
[3:46:52.460 --> 3:46:55.740]  the um infinite consciousness is all possibility so
[3:46:55.740 --> 3:47:00.300]  expressing your uniqueness your maverick your unique spin on life is that
[3:47:00.300 --> 3:47:03.500]  the expressing the the infinite consciousness and that changes the
[3:47:03.500 --> 3:47:06.940]  controlled paradigm so we're taking it over cell by cell
[3:47:06.940 --> 3:47:10.780]  exactly so when you talk is you you just have about those documents and other
[3:47:10.780 --> 3:47:13.740]  you know the tanks and everyone becoming a hive mind
[3:47:13.740 --> 3:47:17.180]  they can only create a hype and they can't get to consciousness you see it's
[3:47:17.180 --> 3:47:19.820]  580 too quickly too powerful for them anyway
[3:47:19.820 --> 3:47:24.220]  their arena is the body computer decoding system
[3:47:24.220 --> 3:47:30.380]  and and they can only put us in a hive mind by locking us in that level of
[3:47:30.380 --> 3:47:34.940]  reality now they've done it for vast numbers of people but this awakening
[3:47:34.940 --> 3:47:39.740]  is literally breaking the it's a massive revolution let's yes it is and
[3:47:39.740 --> 3:47:45.420]  and people should not for a second underestimate the incredible
[3:47:45.420 --> 3:47:50.540]  extraordinarily amazing magnitude of what's going on
[3:47:50.540 --> 3:47:53.820]  yes we need to know what what the manipulation of the conspiracy is
[3:47:53.820 --> 3:47:57.020]  doing so we streetwise to it and their enormous numbers of people who still
[3:47:57.020 --> 3:48:00.220]  don't realize their slaves who need that information to realize that they are
[3:48:00.220 --> 3:48:03.180]  then they can do something about it they do we gotta go to calls we gotta go to
[3:48:03.180 --> 3:48:07.740]  calls ladies and gentlemen the bottom line is this info wars dot com prison
[3:48:07.740 --> 3:48:11.020]  planet dot com david ike dot com check it out
[3:48:11.020 --> 3:48:14.540]  and then put it into action doesn't mean you'll be a master of this overnight
[3:48:14.540 --> 3:48:19.180]  to start questioning the system stop watching tv love your family eat healthy
[3:48:19.180 --> 3:48:22.860]  go out and warm people expose the bankers and that leads you on the path
[3:48:22.860 --> 3:48:26.860]  to expanding your horizons david ike what an amazing individual david let's
[3:48:26.860 --> 3:48:29.100]  take calls we're going to skip this next break as well for the
[3:48:29.100 --> 3:48:33.420]  internet listeners michael in texas you're on the air go ahead
[3:48:33.420 --> 3:48:39.100]  uh... this week yes sir okay michael yeah hey thanks man uh...
[3:48:39.100 --> 3:48:42.300]  you both express yourself so eloquently uh... i'm in want to talk about you know
[3:48:42.300 --> 3:48:46.540]  for a while and uh... you know talking about the uh... dynamics of these
[3:48:46.540 --> 3:48:50.140]  vibrational frequencies uh... you've covered it pretty good
[3:48:50.140 --> 3:48:53.260]  uh... what i think we have coming toward us
[3:48:53.260 --> 3:48:56.460]  those that are truth rising such as the both of you in
[3:48:56.460 --> 3:49:00.940]  in your listening audience is that we're approaching a point of separation
[3:49:00.940 --> 3:49:04.620]  in our vibration frequencies they've they've kept by bringing keeping us in
[3:49:04.620 --> 3:49:07.900]  fear they've brought us down to their low-life vibration that you've
[3:49:07.900 --> 3:49:12.140]  expressed so eloquently and uh... by us
[3:49:12.140 --> 3:49:16.300]  raising our vibration of uh... frequency by getting above their fear that
[3:49:16.300 --> 3:49:20.060]  they're trying to to perpetrate us and be just keep us beat down
[3:49:20.060 --> 3:49:23.420]  we will be able to rate raise our vibration frequency to a point that
[3:49:23.420 --> 3:49:26.940]  they won't be able to exist because they are so low life
[3:49:26.940 --> 3:49:30.940]  and dishonest and you know they create the killing feel they've contaminated the
[3:49:30.940 --> 3:49:33.020]  planet you know the food the water
[3:49:33.020 --> 3:49:36.220]  everything you know and they operate with no conscience
[3:49:36.220 --> 3:49:39.180]  and i just feel like we we're approaching that point of separation
[3:49:39.180 --> 3:49:43.260]  where they won't be able to to function in their thought forms
[3:49:43.260 --> 3:49:47.100]  in a higher vibrational fact that's what they call it they call it separation
[3:49:47.100 --> 3:49:50.860]  consciousness in the people they torture to create mind control slaves and that's
[3:49:50.860 --> 3:49:55.340]  declassified david yeah and i know i i went through years
[3:49:55.340 --> 3:49:57.980]  uh... and years in the nineties and early in this
[3:49:57.980 --> 3:50:02.060]  century uh... deeply deeply uh... researching
[3:50:02.060 --> 3:50:05.500]  mind control techniques and uh... when i talk to
[3:50:05.500 --> 3:50:08.700]  stream of mind control victims who are now trying to do program
[3:50:08.700 --> 3:50:11.660]  they'll tell me the same they can't get to consciousness
[3:50:11.660 --> 3:50:15.340]  the mind control is done on the body computer level even talk in in the in
[3:50:15.340 --> 3:50:18.220]  the mind control projects about mind files and things like this they
[3:50:18.220 --> 3:50:21.500]  understand what the computer is they're trying to lock us into that and when we
[3:50:21.500 --> 3:50:24.620]  look in the mirror and identify who we are with what we're looking at
[3:50:24.620 --> 3:50:28.060]  with their locking it into it and if you look at hold on hold on here we go
[3:50:28.060 --> 3:50:30.940]  behind the scenes uh... david continue
[3:50:30.940 --> 3:50:35.180]  david continue and then michael in texas finish up go ahead
[3:50:35.180 --> 3:50:38.540]  oh okay and what i'm going to say is that if you look at society
[3:50:38.540 --> 3:50:43.180]  and the way it's structured and all the things that are in society to
[3:50:43.180 --> 3:50:47.180]  attractors they're all five cents things they're all five cents
[3:50:47.180 --> 3:50:52.140]  magnets uh... you know all with this taste all the smell all the
[3:50:52.140 --> 3:50:55.740]  look at this hear this all feel this it's all
[3:50:55.740 --> 3:50:59.100]  uh... bring us into the five cents level of reality and it's done
[3:50:59.100 --> 3:51:02.860]  behind the scenes on purpose you know where where is the
[3:51:02.860 --> 3:51:06.700]  the talk of this stuff as you rightly say you know the thing is that
[3:51:06.700 --> 3:51:11.180]  science uh... is a mass of dots called disciplines that don't talk to each
[3:51:11.180 --> 3:51:14.380]  other when you connect the dots they've already they've already
[3:51:14.380 --> 3:51:17.500]  saw what this reality is but if they don't connect the dots then the dots
[3:51:17.500 --> 3:51:20.700]  don't come together you can't see that they've saw that what this reality is
[3:51:20.700 --> 3:51:24.780]  because i don't talk to each other and and the the idea is to keep those dots
[3:51:24.780 --> 3:51:28.460]  as dots and they're not so we don't connect it and see the nature of reality
[3:51:28.460 --> 3:51:32.780]  we're experiencing and and and and to hold us in the five senses by
[3:51:32.780 --> 3:51:36.860]  creating a society that is appealing to them all the time
[3:51:36.860 --> 3:51:39.900]  we should be talking about this in the schools and the colleges we should be
[3:51:39.900 --> 3:51:42.700]  talking about this in the media of it big questions
[3:51:42.700 --> 3:51:46.140]  which is where you get big answers from what is reality
[3:51:46.140 --> 3:51:50.300]  who are we where are we why are these big questions never asked in the mainstream
[3:51:50.300 --> 3:51:53.340]  well david of public information david here's an example of the big answers
[3:51:53.340 --> 3:51:57.020]  here's an example and then we'll let michael finish up
[3:51:57.020 --> 3:52:02.380]  they're constantly putting out fish allures to drag us into petty base
[3:52:02.380 --> 3:52:06.700]  five senses or the basic uh... instincts for the bestial
[3:52:06.700 --> 3:52:11.020]  survival level and through fear they try to put us into the primitive level
[3:52:11.020 --> 3:52:14.540]  that's a way for a psychologist or sociologist or a union
[3:52:14.540 --> 3:52:18.620]  uh... a union or somebody to to you know put it very very simply but an
[3:52:18.620 --> 3:52:21.740]  example is i'll watch tv just to monitor maybe
[3:52:21.740 --> 3:52:24.300]  two or three times a week but i can barely do it
[3:52:24.300 --> 3:52:27.340]  and i'll be on the treadmill in the garage watching fox tv and there's
[3:52:27.340 --> 3:52:31.980]  these beautiful info babes smiling putting sexual desire looks
[3:52:31.980 --> 3:52:35.340]  licking their lips staring at you like no
[3:52:35.340 --> 3:52:40.220]  oh and i catch myself shifting into a primitive level
[3:52:40.220 --> 3:52:44.140]  liking her looking at her because she's been trained
[3:52:44.140 --> 3:52:48.460]  through the tv to look at everyone like she wants to have passionate
[3:52:48.460 --> 3:52:53.180]  wild primitive sex with you right now and the programmers know
[3:52:53.180 --> 3:52:56.300]  that that's what they're doing and the men that are on those shows on fox
[3:52:56.300 --> 3:52:57.660]  especially
[3:52:57.660 --> 3:53:01.100]  they're going for what women want a man who's sweet and loving and wants to
[3:53:01.100 --> 3:53:02.140]  hear them and they'll
[3:53:02.140 --> 3:53:05.660]  oh yes as they report the news it could be about anything
[3:53:05.660 --> 3:53:09.660]  oh good thank you it's all about a fake genuineness
[3:53:09.660 --> 3:53:13.180]  so there's an example of the false reality it's a tv
[3:53:13.180 --> 3:53:16.460]  it's a signal the woman isn't there the man isn't there
[3:53:16.460 --> 3:53:20.780]  but it is just base complete total and absolute
[3:53:20.780 --> 3:53:24.060]  programming manipulating the senses of the brain
[3:53:24.060 --> 3:53:28.700]  and people get invested in the ride like bill hicks said they get invested
[3:53:28.700 --> 3:53:31.420]  in the false paradigm and they get mad at you
[3:53:31.420 --> 3:53:33.980]  when you're trying to get them to struggle out of it here we go final
[3:53:33.980 --> 3:53:36.140]  segment
[3:53:37.420 --> 3:53:41.100]  okay david i was talking about fox news and and and and tv and how the woman
[3:53:41.100 --> 3:53:43.820]  lustfully looks at you through the tv but it isn't real
[3:53:43.820 --> 3:53:47.260]  it's a digital image and she isn't really personally looking at you they're
[3:53:47.260 --> 3:53:50.860]  manipulating our basic genetic code as a mammal you're
[3:53:50.860 --> 3:53:55.500]  saying rise above that david ike and then finish up michael
[3:53:55.500 --> 3:53:59.500]  yeah i mean you know the five senses are there and we can enjoy them
[3:53:59.500 --> 3:54:02.300]  and and we can we experience this world through them
[3:54:02.300 --> 3:54:05.820]  but once the five senses become the only
[3:54:05.820 --> 3:54:09.660]  or the master level of experiences
[3:54:09.660 --> 3:54:13.660]  experiencing we can be lied to and manipulated through that yeah i mean we
[3:54:13.660 --> 3:54:18.540]  are then in the trap we're then in the the mouse trap they've got it
[3:54:18.540 --> 3:54:22.220]  and so you can experience the five senses something very nice but we don't
[3:54:22.220 --> 3:54:24.460]  come here to then ignore the fact that we're here
[3:54:24.460 --> 3:54:27.900]  and i would say this to people who awaken quote spiritually
[3:54:27.900 --> 3:54:31.580]  you know we don't come here to awaken our consciousness and then
[3:54:31.580 --> 3:54:35.420]  ignore the fact that we're actually here because we've opened our consciousness
[3:54:35.420 --> 3:54:41.020]  consciousness are asked to express itself um uh... it to to to make the changes
[3:54:41.020 --> 3:54:43.980]  that in society that faith without works is dead
[3:54:43.980 --> 3:54:47.100]  faithful i mean if you really change your consciousness from evil and
[3:54:47.100 --> 3:54:49.740]  destruction to love and light you're going to try to help people
[3:54:49.740 --> 3:54:53.100]  quickly finish my all the time you're going to try to do what you're going to
[3:54:53.100 --> 3:54:56.300]  do what is right not even try you're going to do what it's going to do it
[3:54:56.300 --> 3:55:00.060]  if you're not doing that then don't kid yourself you've got expanded consciousness
[3:55:00.060 --> 3:55:04.540]  yeah michael anything else yes sir uh... just for your listening audience uh...
[3:55:04.540 --> 3:55:07.900]  one way that i through my own personal experience of of raising my personal
[3:55:07.900 --> 3:55:10.860]  vibration and recognizing it as it happens is
[3:55:10.860 --> 3:55:14.940]  the feeling of goosebumps you know whenever that that's just a surge of
[3:55:14.940 --> 3:55:18.140]  vital energy coming into every cell of your body head to toe
[3:55:18.140 --> 3:55:22.300]  it feels good it feels warm and you can just actually
[3:55:22.300 --> 3:55:26.380]  consciously understand and and and realize how your vibration frequency is
[3:55:26.380 --> 3:55:30.220]  changing and by thinking about good things good thoughts like truth rise in
[3:55:30.220 --> 3:55:35.340]  earth or look for death standing up to uh... uh... whatever it got at yahoo's
[3:55:35.340 --> 3:55:39.420]  name getting past the fear taking action absolutely that gets you yeah
[3:55:39.420 --> 3:55:42.780]  exactly people think that i'm putting out fear i'm not i'm saying there's a
[3:55:42.780 --> 3:55:45.500]  threat we've got to meet it it's empowering
[3:55:45.500 --> 3:55:48.460]  to take action against it i appreciate your call david i know you gotta go have
[3:55:48.460 --> 3:55:51.020]  that meeting i'm gonna twist your arm for only five minutes
[3:55:51.020 --> 3:55:53.500]  when the hour ends in three minutes so we can talk to
[3:55:53.500 --> 3:55:57.580]  hasure ryan timon guy you can do five minutes after can't you
[3:55:57.580 --> 3:56:01.500]  okay okay no problem i twisting the arm of david ike david ike dot com and when
[3:56:01.500 --> 3:56:04.860]  this radio show ends on the amon f m dial in three minutes
[3:56:04.860 --> 3:56:08.700]  you'll have to tune to info wars dot com and
[3:56:08.700 --> 3:56:11.980]  prison planet dot com on those streams or prison planet dot tv
[3:56:11.980 --> 3:56:15.260]  to see us go live into overdrive right now
[3:56:15.260 --> 3:56:20.060]  uh... ashore in oklahoma you're on the air with david ike
[3:56:20.060 --> 3:56:24.620]  hello yes sir you're on the air yes i'm mr jones i've been listening to you for
[3:56:24.620 --> 3:56:29.340]  about three years now and um... i have quite an extensive notebook
[3:56:29.340 --> 3:56:33.420]  of notes that i've been keeping relative to many of your shows
[3:56:33.420 --> 3:56:36.620]  uh... this one in particular uh... struck my interest
[3:56:36.620 --> 3:56:40.140]  uh... because you're speaking of vibrational energy which you've been
[3:56:40.140 --> 3:56:44.140]  referring to as frequencies and uh... i've been studying that phenomenon for
[3:56:44.140 --> 3:56:49.260]  some time now uh... mainly through uh... ancient languages
[3:56:49.260 --> 3:56:53.180]  and uh... for example i am of the belief based on
[3:56:53.180 --> 3:56:57.980]  extensive research that what you refer to as the new world order
[3:56:57.980 --> 3:57:02.620]  and the current economic crisis is actually a transformation of the beast
[3:57:02.620 --> 3:57:07.100]  of mammon that will re-emerge as the neo roman empire
[3:57:07.100 --> 3:57:10.620]  and one of the reasons i say that is because of the calendar
[3:57:10.620 --> 3:57:14.940]  that western culture and most of the industrialized world lives by
[3:57:14.940 --> 3:57:19.500]  is the same calendar that was implemented by julia caesar in 46 bc
[3:57:19.500 --> 3:57:23.900]  and that what we are experiencing now is in fact the culmination
[3:57:23.900 --> 3:57:27.260]  of the prophecy relative to uh... stop right there i got a jump was renting
[3:57:27.260 --> 3:57:30.860]  the main transmission only five minutes left with david ike david ike dot com
[3:57:30.860 --> 3:57:33.900]  again my websites are info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[3:57:33.900 --> 3:57:36.780]  when david leaves us in five minutes i'm going to cover the latest economic
[3:57:36.780 --> 3:57:39.980]  developments in overdrive only at info wars dot com
[3:57:39.980 --> 3:57:43.580]  and prison planet dot tv but in the 30 seconds we've got left the main
[3:57:43.580 --> 3:57:47.660]  transmission david um... that we have to end this in
[3:57:47.660 --> 3:57:49.500]  in just a few minutes because other shows are coming up
[3:57:49.500 --> 3:57:53.660]  and i'm going to get off the line um... well
[3:57:53.660 --> 3:57:56.620]  we're just going to go into retransmission now but bottom line david
[3:57:56.620 --> 3:58:00.220]  they are trying to recreate empires they've had previously i'll ask you
[3:58:00.220 --> 3:58:04.380]  right now as we go into overdrive why they are doing that
[3:58:04.380 --> 3:58:09.500]  here we go ladies and gentlemen into overdrive right now
[3:58:09.500 --> 3:58:12.380]  uh... david uh... i'm going to let you go in just five minutes because i'm going
[3:58:12.380 --> 3:58:15.260]  to get off this uh... network line but network i'm fine to be here for five
[3:58:15.260 --> 3:58:18.380]  minutes i know that comment on what he was just saying
[3:58:18.380 --> 3:58:23.420]  well um... they definitely throw this forward uh... a very very long way and
[3:58:23.420 --> 3:58:26.940]  and yet we've we get into the deepest stuff here there's a reason why they
[3:58:26.940 --> 3:58:29.820]  can do that uh... people people have um...
[3:58:29.820 --> 3:58:33.180]  have said to me understandably over the years um...
[3:58:33.180 --> 3:58:38.220]  why would people hundreds of years ago give their lives to
[3:58:38.220 --> 3:58:42.140]  a global enslavement uh... plan when they know knew they weren't going to be
[3:58:42.140 --> 3:58:45.180]  around by the time it arrived but
[3:58:45.180 --> 3:58:49.180]  this visible light frequency and has a certain
[3:58:49.180 --> 3:58:52.780]  version of time it's a manipulated version of time i mean you can
[3:58:52.780 --> 3:58:57.420]  you can fly across a mythical line on the planet and go into tomorrow or go the
[3:58:57.420 --> 3:59:01.980]  other way and go into today or yesterday or whatever and it's just a
[3:59:01.980 --> 3:59:05.340]  mythical time based on the timeline actually going through london the heart
[3:59:05.340 --> 3:59:10.380]  of the beast and and uh... so it's it's it's uh... a sequence of
[3:59:10.380 --> 3:59:13.980]  events that we measure as time but but it's an illusion
[3:59:13.980 --> 3:59:16.940]  and these entities that operate outside of this
[3:59:16.940 --> 3:59:21.740]  uh... timeline they can move up and down it and come in at different points so
[3:59:21.740 --> 3:59:25.580]  that the same entities uh... can be manipulated in the 1600s that are
[3:59:25.580 --> 3:59:28.380]  manipulating in the 1700s that are manipulating in the
[3:59:28.380 --> 3:59:31.340]  1800s because that's why they're why this bloodline comes through history
[3:59:31.340 --> 3:59:34.140]  what's it what's coming the vehicles being passed through history
[3:59:34.140 --> 3:59:40.540]  at the compatible vehicle so uh... they can plan in our timeline terms
[3:59:40.540 --> 3:59:44.140]  faster distances ahead because they've not got the same relationship to our
[3:59:44.140 --> 3:59:47.420]  timeline as we have and uh... the roman empire is
[3:59:47.420 --> 3:59:50.940]  is massively uh... significant in this and what they've done
[3:59:50.940 --> 3:59:54.300]  is they're just constantly constantly sought to expand
[3:59:54.300 --> 3:59:58.780]  the size of the empire centralized power more and more we were in tribes once
[3:59:58.780 --> 4:00:02.940]  then the tribes became nations central point is now dictating to all the
[4:00:02.940 --> 4:00:05.340]  previous tribes that were looking after themselves
[4:00:05.340 --> 4:00:08.700]  now we're into the big into big way into the next stage which is bringing
[4:00:08.700 --> 4:00:12.540]  nations together under super state and so it's been a
[4:00:12.540 --> 4:00:17.260]  a coordinated plan over this uh... thousands of years
[4:00:17.260 --> 4:00:21.500]  to uh... bring us to the point where there is a global centralized empire and
[4:00:21.500 --> 4:00:24.620]  that's what we're looking at now well incredible answer let's jam in these
[4:00:24.620 --> 4:00:26.460]  four calls and let you get out of here
[4:00:26.460 --> 4:00:29.500]  uh... for three calls ryan in california
[4:00:29.500 --> 4:00:32.780]  all we have times for those three apologize listeners ryan in california
[4:00:32.780 --> 4:00:35.180]  you're on with a legendary day that i
[4:00:35.180 --> 4:00:37.220]  i guess that's good
[4:00:37.220 --> 4:00:39.500]  okay uh... well i'm just going to try to get a quick
[4:00:39.500 --> 4:00:41.380]  if you have a short on time uh...
[4:00:41.380 --> 4:00:44.500]  yet when you guys are talking about the no the infinite knowledge
[4:00:44.500 --> 4:00:47.100]  yet uh... this is this is kind of my perspective on things
[4:00:47.100 --> 4:00:48.020]  so uh...
[4:00:48.020 --> 4:00:49.060]  all form of form of
[4:00:49.060 --> 4:00:52.540]  not a form of this has no substance but to say the substance there is has no
[4:00:52.540 --> 4:00:55.180]  foundation outside of conceptualization
[4:00:55.180 --> 4:00:57.300]  pure wisdom had no conceptualization
[4:00:57.300 --> 4:01:01.060]  pure wisdom is infinite knowing infinite knowledge is similar to intuition but
[4:01:01.060 --> 4:01:02.980]  far greater to the moment of now
[4:01:02.980 --> 4:01:04.180]  though form is formless
[4:01:04.180 --> 4:01:07.580]  formlessness roots itself and all that is perceived when perception is
[4:01:07.580 --> 4:01:08.660]  observed in this manner
[4:01:08.660 --> 4:01:11.540]  one can notice the fluctuation of the universal hologram
[4:01:11.540 --> 4:01:15.700]  universal hologram is operated by you which in turn works to sound found is
[4:01:15.700 --> 4:01:19.420]  also formless it sounded a tool for creating form without vibration there's
[4:01:19.420 --> 4:01:22.940]  once again no foundation for form to exist
[4:01:22.940 --> 4:01:23.980]  using that
[4:01:23.980 --> 4:01:25.140]  i think
[4:01:25.140 --> 4:01:26.580]  for you guys that
[4:01:26.580 --> 4:01:29.220]  ways to express the no
[4:01:29.220 --> 4:01:32.420]  on the guard so what you guys would say well here's an example i can meet
[4:01:32.420 --> 4:01:34.980]  somebody from india or russia or china
[4:01:34.980 --> 4:01:37.580]  who's never heard of me never heard of david ike
[4:01:37.580 --> 4:01:41.300]  i can meet some old lady at a gas station in east texas to know who i am
[4:01:41.300 --> 4:01:44.260]  and they have all the basic knowledge and they know all the tricks of the new
[4:01:44.260 --> 4:01:45.100]  world order
[4:01:45.100 --> 4:01:48.680]  and they understand it in eight lee never even reading about it
[4:01:48.680 --> 4:01:51.900]  and and and it's the same thing like willy nelson you meet willy nelson
[4:01:51.900 --> 4:01:54.860]  it's like obi-wan kenobi and he knows all about it all
[4:01:54.860 --> 4:02:00.020]  he sees really humble and and and he's definitely tuned in uh... you know to
[4:02:00.020 --> 4:02:05.060]  you know to the higher levels and and uh... i appreciate your call ryan
[4:02:05.060 --> 4:02:07.940]  comments on that day but i
[4:02:07.940 --> 4:02:12.060]  i would make this point and uh... i think it's uh... it's important to
[4:02:12.060 --> 4:02:14.300]  understand this
[4:02:14.300 --> 4:02:19.220]  because the whole of this reality is about information which on one level is
[4:02:19.220 --> 4:02:21.180]  that takes a vibrational form
[4:02:21.180 --> 4:02:23.380]  when you're going to get you've only got to put your your hand in front of your
[4:02:23.380 --> 4:02:25.620]  mouth you can feel the vibration speech
[4:02:25.620 --> 4:02:30.100]  i mean what what what what we got we've got uh... uh... the uh... sound box is
[4:02:30.100 --> 4:02:33.420]  is a vibration creator that's what it is and then then
[4:02:33.420 --> 4:02:37.060]  the receiver decodes that into language through the left brain and that's how
[4:02:37.060 --> 4:02:38.620]  communication goes on
[4:02:38.620 --> 4:02:42.140]  between me speaking and the person decoding what i'm hearing and he's
[4:02:42.140 --> 4:02:46.100]  actually no noise it's just a vibration and it's decoded through that
[4:02:46.100 --> 4:02:48.580]  receiving body computers into what we call
[4:02:48.580 --> 4:02:50.540]  uh... language and
[4:02:50.540 --> 4:02:51.980]  uh... therefore
[4:02:51.980 --> 4:02:53.140]  it's not just
[4:02:53.140 --> 4:02:56.380]  when i'm speaking on your show or you're speaking on your show
[4:02:56.380 --> 4:02:58.660]  or or or and and the people listening
[4:02:58.660 --> 4:03:01.300]  that's not the only level of communication that's going through the
[4:03:01.300 --> 4:03:04.460]  space-time continuum somehow it's it has
[4:03:04.460 --> 4:03:09.060]  as it's broadcast the whole area that it's broadcast across
[4:03:09.060 --> 4:03:13.340]  is offering the potential for someone to walk down the street and just tune into
[4:03:13.340 --> 4:03:17.860]  it they won't hear the alex jones show but they will get a knowing they'll get
[4:03:17.860 --> 4:03:18.340]  a
[4:03:18.340 --> 4:03:19.940]  instinctive intuitive
[4:03:19.940 --> 4:03:22.620]  feeling from that information that is in the
[4:03:22.620 --> 4:03:25.220]  in the ether there to be decoded whenever we choose
[4:03:25.220 --> 4:03:28.820]  and the more people expand their minds the more sensitive they become to that
[4:03:28.820 --> 4:03:30.860]  and the more intuitive they become
[4:03:30.860 --> 4:03:33.940]  to information they want that they will allow you go in just a minute i want
[4:03:33.940 --> 4:03:36.700]  to talk to tim and guy but let me just put up this point and i'm sure you'll
[4:03:36.700 --> 4:03:39.940]  pick up on probably have the same thought or even deeper
[4:03:39.940 --> 4:03:45.260]  the new order masters their virtual osos conductors at this and
[4:03:45.260 --> 4:03:47.980]  when they threaten that there are evil terrorists that want to hurt you that
[4:03:47.980 --> 4:03:49.860]  want your freedom that want to kill you
[4:03:49.860 --> 4:03:51.460]  they know the public
[4:03:51.460 --> 4:03:52.900]  subconscious
[4:03:52.900 --> 4:03:55.500]  uh... you know six cents whatever
[4:03:55.500 --> 4:03:57.220]  he is picking up
[4:03:57.220 --> 4:04:01.740]  the fact that there are evil groups there are terrorist somebody attacked us on
[4:04:01.740 --> 4:04:02.420]  nine eleven
[4:04:02.420 --> 4:04:06.260]  somebody's got some evil plan so the new order knows they have to have a
[4:04:06.260 --> 4:04:07.380]  terrorist group
[4:04:07.380 --> 4:04:10.620]  and terror attack not just to scare the public into submission but because the
[4:04:10.620 --> 4:04:13.940]  public's already picking up that the government's evil so they need to put the
[4:04:13.940 --> 4:04:16.020]  cut out of al-qaeda
[4:04:16.020 --> 4:04:17.820]  al-syaida in front of it
[4:04:17.820 --> 4:04:22.300]  so that the new world order limonati can take all the fear being generated by the
[4:04:22.300 --> 4:04:26.540]  public picking up on them being evil and place it on to the cut out you see
[4:04:26.540 --> 4:04:27.380]  what i'm saying
[4:04:27.380 --> 4:04:30.860]  yeah i do and then you see this is where symbolism comes in you see
[4:04:30.860 --> 4:04:34.460]  uh... the statue of liberty new york harbour is that it was given to new york
[4:04:34.460 --> 4:04:37.580]  by french freemasons and you know what it's good for it's going to be remiss
[4:04:37.580 --> 4:04:39.180]  uh... from about a lot
[4:04:39.180 --> 4:04:40.860]  holding the uh...
[4:04:40.860 --> 4:04:44.820]  the symbol of nimrod uh... in babelon which is the lighted torch
[4:04:44.820 --> 4:04:46.820]  and uh... so that
[4:04:46.820 --> 4:04:51.220]  because it symbolizes what whatever something symbolizes that vibration it
[4:04:51.220 --> 4:04:53.020]  is is is what illicit
[4:04:53.020 --> 4:04:57.180]  and so they put the symbols around us with some symbolize certain concepts of
[4:04:57.180 --> 4:04:59.660]  overwhelmingly dark controlled
[4:04:59.660 --> 4:05:04.820]  uh... uh... uh... really uh... what you call evil concepts and that energy is
[4:05:04.820 --> 4:05:08.860]  being generated by the symbols because that is what they represent because
[4:05:08.860 --> 4:05:13.060]  beyond the physical of that symbol it's an energy field vibrating and people
[4:05:13.060 --> 4:05:17.540]  pick them up this is how they can and and do manipulate the the energy field
[4:05:17.540 --> 4:05:18.860]  to see if you like
[4:05:18.860 --> 4:05:22.700]  of of the major cities etc and so that we're walking through this stuff all
[4:05:22.700 --> 4:05:24.460]  the time
[4:05:24.460 --> 4:05:27.540]  i don't take you much longer than i said i would we're so thankful david for

[4:06:29.500 --> 4:06:32.540]  they don't want to spread out on the land they want some compact cities
[4:06:32.540 --> 4:06:35.460]  so you're doing the right thing there anything for david i
[4:06:35.460 --> 4:06:40.380]  i think i just got your uh... three dvd set freedom of fascism time to choose

[4:06:45.780 --> 4:06:49.140]  well if someone asked me i will but every time i come into canada white
[4:06:49.140 --> 4:06:51.260]  canada i don't know that i've got an idea
[4:06:51.260 --> 4:06:54.140]  i get stopped for hours at the border all my
[4:06:54.140 --> 4:06:58.460]  uh... gear is looked for me to find nothing and it eventually let me in
[4:06:58.460 --> 4:06:59.740]  uh... so uh...
[4:06:59.740 --> 4:07:03.420]  what the problem is with canada i mean what i find out if you know it's the
[4:07:03.420 --> 4:07:06.860]  just up just off mainstream countries like
[4:07:06.860 --> 4:07:10.620]  you know that the the major force in the north america in terms of public
[4:07:10.620 --> 4:07:12.460]  awareness of the united states
[4:07:12.460 --> 4:07:16.980]  uh... the major force in in in central europe area is uh... is germany
[4:07:16.980 --> 4:07:17.500]  and yet
[4:07:17.500 --> 4:07:22.260]  so much goes on in canada so much goes on in austria the country one
[4:07:22.260 --> 4:07:27.100]  uh... one back from the the major uh... kind of the country in that area in
[4:07:27.100 --> 4:07:30.220]  terms of public awareness and then politics and everything
[4:07:30.220 --> 4:07:32.820]  and so much goes on in canada uh...
[4:07:32.820 --> 4:07:35.980]  which uh... affects america and affects canada of course
[4:07:35.980 --> 4:07:39.900]  which is that you know we kept quiet uh... in in a much more efficient way
[4:07:39.900 --> 4:07:43.700]  because it's not in the united states
[4:07:43.700 --> 4:07:46.260]  you're absolutely right and of course i got detained
[4:07:46.260 --> 4:07:49.220]  when i was in canada as well i appreciate

[4:09:30.940 --> 4:09:34.180]  chapters because once we understand the nature of reality
[4:09:34.180 --> 4:09:35.220]  the nature of the
[4:09:35.220 --> 4:09:37.340]  society that's been created for us
[4:09:37.340 --> 4:09:40.820]  starts to become crystal clear

[4:10:42.460 --> 4:10:43.580]  i just had it
[4:10:43.580 --> 4:10:47.260]  on the screen and then my computer
[4:10:47.260 --> 4:10:49.460]  browser crashed
[4:10:49.460 --> 4:10:51.020]  so let me go back
[4:10:51.020 --> 4:10:55.100]  to it and uh... give people my comments
[4:10:55.100 --> 4:10:56.580]  on the latest things
[4:10:56.580 --> 4:10:58.860]  that are happening financially right now
[4:10:58.860 --> 4:11:02.460]  look whether you love david ike or hate david ike he is for real he means
[4:11:02.460 --> 4:11:04.140]  what he's saying
[4:11:04.140 --> 4:11:07.260]  and i said i agree with about ninety percent of what he has to say and he's
[4:11:07.260 --> 4:11:09.700]  really a classy guy
[4:11:09.700 --> 4:11:12.060]  you know i called him on international television the turret of the punch
[4:11:12.060 --> 4:11:15.100]  bowl because people back then weren't ready to wake up to even
[4:11:15.100 --> 4:11:18.700]  wilder things and i said you know he covers all these things are true and
[4:11:18.700 --> 4:11:20.020]  then goes even further
[4:11:20.020 --> 4:11:23.420]  but what he says about the elite i have researched and found that they believe
[4:11:23.420 --> 4:11:24.380]  it's true
[4:11:24.380 --> 4:11:26.500]  so whether it's the truth or not
[4:11:26.500 --> 4:11:29.540]  uh... whether they're in touch with different entities or not you know i'm
[4:11:29.540 --> 4:11:31.260]  not crazy for reporting
[4:11:31.260 --> 4:11:32.340]  on the fact that
[4:11:32.340 --> 4:11:33.460]  the elite believe
[4:11:33.460 --> 4:11:35.300]  that they're doing that
[4:11:35.300 --> 4:11:39.260]  the stock market dropped around seven hundred points
[4:11:39.260 --> 4:11:42.380]  it's gone up about two hundred back from that point is the plunge protection
[4:11:42.380 --> 4:11:44.060]  team pumps money in
[4:11:44.060 --> 4:11:48.060]  when the federal reserve and uh... the treasury and the president and others
[4:11:48.060 --> 4:11:51.460]  uh...
[4:11:51.460 --> 4:11:53.580]  bad mouth
[4:11:53.580 --> 4:11:54.540]  everybody
[4:11:54.540 --> 4:11:58.140]  and said the stock market was basically a die last week to three if we didn't
[4:11:58.140 --> 4:12:00.660]  submit to them and go along with them
[4:12:00.660 --> 4:12:03.660]  uh... that was economic terrorism and that's the big issue that everybody needs
[4:12:03.660 --> 4:12:05.100]  to be discussing getting out
[4:12:05.100 --> 4:12:07.300]  that that was a crime yelling fire
[4:12:07.300 --> 4:12:08.780]  in the financial theater
[4:12:08.780 --> 4:12:11.780]  there's all sorts of laws against people in high places
[4:12:11.780 --> 4:12:15.180]  in involved in financial panics for insider trading
[4:12:15.180 --> 4:12:18.180]  and that's the key here this was insider trading so that they would get
[4:12:18.180 --> 4:12:19.060]  immunity
[4:12:19.060 --> 4:12:21.940]  and trillions of dollars not seven hundred eight hundred fifty one billion
[4:12:21.940 --> 4:12:22.940]  it's more like five
[4:12:22.940 --> 4:12:25.220]  trillion according to bloomberg and other publications
[4:12:25.220 --> 4:12:27.500]  and they terrorize the public from high places
[4:12:27.500 --> 4:12:30.460]  and insider trading to affect the markets to drive them down
[4:12:30.460 --> 4:12:33.940]  to have the plunge protection state team stand back and not pump it up to
[4:12:33.940 --> 4:12:37.340]  totally discredit world markets as world markets all over meltdown
[4:12:37.340 --> 4:12:41.740]  and others saying trillions of u.s. taxpayer dollars the devaluing our currency and
[4:12:41.740 --> 4:12:43.740]  we've got to pay it back in taxes
[4:12:43.740 --> 4:12:47.740]  uh... will now be used to buy up any foreign banks any assets at full value
[4:12:47.740 --> 4:12:52.020]  they want for this select group of inner banks that are going to get all these
[4:12:52.020 --> 4:12:54.340]  assets this is the biggest bank robbery
[4:12:54.340 --> 4:12:56.260]  ever seen it's getting worse
[4:12:56.260 --> 4:12:57.420]  uh... by
[4:12:57.420 --> 4:12:59.140]  the day
[4:12:59.140 --> 4:13:04.060]  it is it is just unbelievable you know ten to two ten anderson
[4:13:04.060 --> 4:13:08.860]  you know this almost thirty years to consciously deal
[4:13:08.860 --> 4:13:10.500]  with the fact that
[4:13:10.500 --> 4:13:13.940]  they are involved in insider trading that they have engineered all this that
[4:13:13.940 --> 4:13:14.580]  they are
[4:13:14.580 --> 4:13:16.580]  plunging the markets yet again
[4:13:16.580 --> 4:13:19.020]  that they are terrorizing the public
[4:13:19.020 --> 4:13:20.980]  into giving them unlimited power
[4:13:20.980 --> 4:13:22.980]  but the good news is the public
[4:13:22.980 --> 4:13:26.100]  ninety plus percent on agree with them and it and and and the establishment is
[4:13:26.100 --> 4:13:26.740]  being
[4:13:26.740 --> 4:13:29.820]  revealed and exposed right now i want to drag you back in here and really get
[4:13:29.820 --> 4:13:32.100]  your take on all this ten anderson
[4:13:32.100 --> 4:13:35.860]  yeah i can tell you right now alex that's that's what's going on there's a
[4:13:35.860 --> 4:13:40.180]  right now we the people the united states are financing
[4:13:40.180 --> 4:13:44.300]  the uh... the uh... elite uh... like you said the federal reserve system their
[4:13:44.300 --> 4:13:46.420]  banking partners which
[4:13:46.420 --> 4:13:49.460]  i mean a lot of people don't know this but the federal reserve system is made
[4:13:49.460 --> 4:13:53.500]  up is is owned by the federal reserve bank branches in order to be a federal
[4:13:53.500 --> 4:13:54.900]  reserve bank branch
[4:13:54.900 --> 4:13:58.140]  you have to have at least two percent of the federal reserve system you you have
[4:13:58.140 --> 4:13:59.700]  to own that much of it
[4:13:59.700 --> 4:14:03.540]  and so the city corp uh... wells fargo
[4:14:03.540 --> 4:14:06.460]  uh... all these different you know
[4:14:06.460 --> 4:14:10.220]  melon bank uh... the uh... the uh...
[4:14:10.220 --> 4:14:14.260]  uh... chase Manhattan all these banks that are members of the uh... federal
[4:14:14.260 --> 4:14:15.940]  reserve banking system
[4:14:15.940 --> 4:14:19.340]  our part owners of this and what we have going on right now
[4:14:19.340 --> 4:14:20.460]  as we have
[4:14:20.460 --> 4:14:24.220]  the uh... the the pulsons come in and saying okay we're going to buy up all
[4:14:24.220 --> 4:14:25.540]  this bad debt
[4:14:25.540 --> 4:14:28.780]  and take it off your hands so you guys can start trading amongst each other
[4:14:28.780 --> 4:14:29.860]  again you can trust
[4:14:29.860 --> 4:14:33.020]  you know right now that there's a there's a uh... you know everything's all
[4:14:33.020 --> 4:14:35.900]  locked up because they don't trust each other's portfolios nobody knows what
[4:14:35.900 --> 4:14:36.540]  they have
[4:14:36.540 --> 4:14:38.660]  or what it's worth how can we trade this
[4:14:38.660 --> 4:14:41.700]  and and this whole system set up the way it is
[4:14:41.700 --> 4:14:46.300]  really does it it transfers the the real value of what people worked all their
[4:14:46.300 --> 4:14:47.300]  lives for
[4:14:47.300 --> 4:14:50.980]  and just basically dumps it in the hands of these people and now they're asking
[4:14:50.980 --> 4:14:52.900]  for complete immunity to do it
[4:14:52.900 --> 4:14:56.780]  and the crazy part about it is is congress just handed it to him
[4:14:56.780 --> 4:14:59.500]  i mean it is just absolutely absurd
[4:14:59.500 --> 4:15:03.260]  that if anybody else in the in the in the world or in the united states try to
[4:15:03.260 --> 4:15:04.780]  do something like this
[4:15:04.780 --> 4:15:08.900]  i mean they would be uh... they'd be tried for many crimes not just one
[4:15:08.900 --> 4:15:10.780]  we just a whole long list of this
[4:15:10.780 --> 4:15:11.780]  and here they are
[4:15:11.780 --> 4:15:14.940]  they're they're able to go on and they're gonna able to buy all this stuff up
[4:15:14.940 --> 4:15:17.300]  basically dump all the bad loans
[4:15:17.300 --> 4:15:21.100]  that that were written on the and by bad-mouthing the market for two weeks
[4:15:21.100 --> 4:15:22.900]  signal world market was screwed
[4:15:22.900 --> 4:15:26.780]  done a plunge depression that destroyed remaining confidence when they'd already
[4:15:26.780 --> 4:15:28.220]  built the ponzi scheme
[4:15:28.220 --> 4:15:30.620]  they're blowing out their ponzi scheme to suck up
[4:15:30.620 --> 4:15:32.100]  all the pieces of the puzzle
[4:15:32.100 --> 4:15:34.820]  that are left because unlike a regular ponzi
[4:15:34.820 --> 4:15:37.860]  they don't run out of town with the money they get to now play the part of
[4:15:37.860 --> 4:15:40.780]  the savior and expanded into an even bigger
[4:15:40.780 --> 4:15:44.500]  uh... ponzi scheme german bank runs all sorts of crises in europe
[4:15:44.500 --> 4:15:47.860]  crises in asia stock markets plunging all over the planet
[4:15:47.860 --> 4:15:50.340]  and these bastards they engineered it all ted
[4:15:50.340 --> 4:15:53.340]  they did in general they're ending up with all the real value that's the whole
[4:15:53.340 --> 4:15:54.100]  point
[4:15:54.100 --> 4:15:58.020]  i mean the in the united states they all themselves out at the expense of main
[4:15:58.020 --> 4:16:01.480]  street and have the nerve to tell us that this was for us
[4:16:01.480 --> 4:16:05.100]  yeah that's that's what's going on alex that's exactly right right now
[4:16:05.100 --> 4:16:09.020]  they are saying that the people have gone too far into debt and the people
[4:16:09.020 --> 4:16:12.660]  have pushed themselves so far what is in the people that did this i mean it
[4:16:12.660 --> 4:16:17.580]  the uh... they they set up these this this first of all this banking system
[4:16:17.580 --> 4:16:21.060]  to get money into the system we can't even have commerce here in the united
[4:16:21.060 --> 4:16:25.500]  states without taking on more debt from the federal reserve system and as we
[4:16:25.500 --> 4:16:28.220]  have more commerce it becomes more debt to us
[4:16:28.220 --> 4:16:31.460]  and that's all the system works other blame in the people because we went on
[4:16:31.460 --> 4:16:32.500]  it into debt
[4:16:32.500 --> 4:16:36.180]  i mean that's it's it's just a set up a financial system was very hard for the
[4:16:36.180 --> 4:16:40.060]  average person not to and they said it was good in the thing to do was all
[4:16:40.060 --> 4:16:42.900]  a massive set up again i'm looking at the news
[4:16:42.900 --> 4:16:46.180]  as it pours in and they're probably try to terrorize people in even bigger
[4:16:46.180 --> 4:16:48.820]  bailouts they're saying they're gonna bail out all these states foreign
[4:16:48.820 --> 4:16:52.900]  countries foreign banks foreign insurance companies brokerage firms and they
[4:16:52.900 --> 4:16:55.740]  can decide to give it to whoever they want they're giving it to their own
[4:16:55.740 --> 4:17:00.940]  interest we have open insider trading sucking the treasury dry for generations
[4:17:00.940 --> 4:17:05.500]  in front of us it is so big it is unspeakable well that they have the flip
[4:17:05.500 --> 4:17:08.660]  side of that alex is that you can't print prosperity
[4:17:08.660 --> 4:17:12.660]  and you cannot print wealth you can print money but you cannot print wealth
[4:17:12.660 --> 4:17:17.180]  what they just had a trillion dollar defense budget doubling previous budgets
[4:17:17.180 --> 4:17:20.580]  they are horing it all out it's going to be value the dollar before you leave us
[4:17:20.580 --> 4:17:22.940]  ted for the internet audience only
[4:17:22.940 --> 4:17:24.540]  i cannot stress enough
[4:17:24.540 --> 4:17:27.660]  and you know me what i'm probably doing with storeable food everything they are
[4:17:27.660 --> 4:17:29.340]  insane
[4:17:29.340 --> 4:17:30.780]  you have gold
[4:17:30.780 --> 4:17:33.380]  you have uh... the uh...
[4:17:33.380 --> 4:17:37.980]  french and swiss frank's excellent coins that dealers in the u.s can't even get
[4:17:37.980 --> 4:17:40.780]  your foreign dealers are running out thank god you've got some
[4:17:40.780 --> 4:17:42.860]  in your hand you've got indians
[4:17:42.860 --> 4:17:46.300]  uh... that you've got but you can't even this time get any more of for people
[4:17:46.300 --> 4:17:48.780]  that missed it earlier when i cut you short for david i
[4:17:48.780 --> 4:17:50.740]  tell them what your suppliers in
[4:17:50.740 --> 4:17:52.500]  you've been in the since nineteen eighty
[4:17:52.500 --> 4:17:53.540]  twenty eight years
[4:17:53.540 --> 4:17:56.960]  you you told me this morning you were freaked out you said you have never
[4:17:56.960 --> 4:18:00.740]  seen it were all the major suppliers around now it it's all in silver you've
[4:18:00.740 --> 4:18:01.420]  got
[4:18:01.420 --> 4:18:04.700]  it could be all you're getting usually it's like this alex i'll call my
[4:18:04.700 --> 4:18:08.180]  suppliers and they'll they'll be waiting for me to place an order so i can do
[4:18:08.180 --> 4:18:10.220]  it and there's usually no restriction
[4:18:10.220 --> 4:18:13.660]  right now my suppliers are sitting there just running around like their
[4:18:13.660 --> 4:18:19.180]  tails cut off looking for places to buy just the material that i'm short in
[4:18:19.180 --> 4:18:22.780]  and i'm asking him to take on positions right now i said what can you put me
[4:18:22.780 --> 4:18:26.700]  into that i can actually have so i can deliver to my customers he says well
[4:18:26.700 --> 4:18:29.120]  twenty francs i can still do right now is a good
[4:18:29.120 --> 4:18:30.220]  get me all you have
[4:18:30.220 --> 4:18:32.780]  what about the british sovereignty says right now i'm three weeks out on the
[4:18:32.780 --> 4:18:33.600]  british seven
[4:18:33.600 --> 4:18:35.460]  i said i would care get as many as you can
[4:18:35.460 --> 4:18:37.580]  get him in here so i can get him to my customers
[4:18:37.580 --> 4:18:40.500]  uh... you know and one of my people also say i've got
[4:18:40.500 --> 4:18:43.980]  i've got ten bags of franklin house i said give me all ten
[4:18:43.980 --> 4:18:47.260]  because i want my customers in the silver to run what i mean i want to
[4:18:47.260 --> 4:18:48.080]  mean it right now
[4:18:48.080 --> 4:18:50.020]  there's just too much risk
[4:18:50.020 --> 4:18:51.580]  in the banking system
[4:18:51.580 --> 4:18:56.380]  and this fiat currency and the stock market and the bond market and the
[4:18:56.380 --> 4:19:00.300]  annuity you're telling me i mean it's like two weeks ago the american men says
[4:19:00.300 --> 4:19:01.820]  we can't buy enough gold
[4:19:01.820 --> 4:19:03.060]  we're suspending
[4:19:03.060 --> 4:19:07.980]  coining u.s. coins for now and they're sold out of the buffaloes and you can't
[4:19:07.980 --> 4:19:11.540]  get buffaloes you've got a few hundred last week and sold them in a few minutes
[4:19:11.540 --> 4:19:13.300]  i mean ladies and gentlemen
[4:19:13.300 --> 4:19:16.660]  to explain this they are suppressing the gold market but it's still rising
[4:19:16.660 --> 4:19:17.980]  gold's way up today
[4:19:17.980 --> 4:19:20.820]  uh... but it should be like three thousand bucks an ounce most economists say
[4:19:20.820 --> 4:19:22.020]  to nineteen eighty
[4:19:22.020 --> 4:19:23.380]  uh... inflation
[4:19:23.380 --> 4:19:27.500]  and and then meanwhile there's runs on everywhere the public starting to figure
[4:19:27.500 --> 4:19:28.220]  this out
[4:19:28.220 --> 4:19:31.020]  when the general public figures it out you're not going to be able to get any
[4:19:31.020 --> 4:19:32.620]  price you were telling me earlier
[4:19:32.620 --> 4:19:34.340]  the bullions all sold out
[4:19:34.340 --> 4:19:37.100]  you're getting collectible coins that you're being able to sell
[4:19:37.100 --> 4:19:40.820]  at below billion because you bought them last week before gold raised up well
[4:19:40.820 --> 4:19:43.860]  that's right alex and and then in addition to this year gold's up thirty
[4:19:43.860 --> 4:19:45.140]  some bucks right now
[4:19:45.140 --> 4:19:47.780]  and and i picked up the stuff before it ran up
[4:19:47.780 --> 4:19:49.500]  and uh... and the other thing too
[4:19:49.500 --> 4:19:53.020]  is that you know i mean you got u.s. eagles gone from the marketplace can't
[4:19:53.020 --> 4:19:53.540]  get them
[4:19:53.540 --> 4:19:56.940]  maple leaves forget it you can't get canadian maple leaves right now that
[4:19:56.940 --> 4:19:59.100]  buffalo coin we talked about the other day
[4:19:59.100 --> 4:20:01.300]  i mean when i sell a couple hundred of them
[4:20:01.300 --> 4:20:02.900]  you know it's going to be tough
[4:20:02.900 --> 4:20:06.540]  to deliver any more further than i had to stop the sale on those things that's
[4:20:06.540 --> 4:20:10.020]  right that's right right now right now you have the fraction so it's about the
[4:20:10.020 --> 4:20:13.540]  end in coin all that ten dollar indian right now usually the ten dollar indian
[4:20:13.540 --> 4:20:16.860]  trades for about i don't know i guess about three to four times above its
[4:20:16.860 --> 4:20:17.900]  melt value
[4:20:17.900 --> 4:20:21.300]  and right now it's practically trading at its melt value i said well what can i
[4:20:21.300 --> 4:20:22.060]  get
[4:20:22.060 --> 4:20:23.740]  in collector coin era
[4:20:23.740 --> 4:20:27.500]  you know ten dollar you're finding a few collectors that nobody noticed
[4:20:27.500 --> 4:20:30.860]  that are near melt right now these are insane deal well because here's what
[4:20:30.860 --> 4:20:34.660]  happened alex the economy is taking a big dive in people have been steering
[4:20:34.660 --> 4:20:37.580]  away from collector stuff and they've been going into the bullion so this
[4:20:37.580 --> 4:20:40.860]  this stuff here the bullion's gone up so fast that it's like people forgot about
[4:20:40.860 --> 4:20:41.340]  them
[4:20:41.340 --> 4:20:45.380]  and i've got about a thousand of these ten dollar indians that i can sell at a
[4:20:45.380 --> 4:20:48.460]  price of about leaving a second here let me take a quick look again where they
[4:20:48.460 --> 4:20:49.060]  are
[4:20:49.060 --> 4:20:52.580]  i have ten dollar indians right now at six hundred and seventy bucks i mean
[4:20:52.580 --> 4:20:56.700]  these things are like thirty five hundred bucks here about five six years ago
[4:20:56.700 --> 4:20:58.620]  and that's that's it it's just
[4:20:58.620 --> 4:21:03.180]  totally distorted so gorgeous collectible coin it is it's it's it's close to melt

[4:21:11.580 --> 4:21:14.300]  coins even have some collector value at very close to meld
[4:21:14.300 --> 4:21:15.820]  at last week's prices
[4:21:15.820 --> 4:21:19.580]  he has the indian which is gorgeous uh... and you have the franklin half dollar
[4:21:19.580 --> 4:21:20.420]  silvers
[4:21:20.420 --> 4:21:22.580]  which are running out quick you were telling me
[4:21:22.580 --> 4:21:26.180]  oh yeah yeah the franklin like i said there's just a small little supply that
[4:21:26.180 --> 4:21:28.260]  i have when i talk about twenty bags
[4:21:28.260 --> 4:21:31.140]  something i think well that's a lot it's really not i mean not for the kind of
[4:21:31.140 --> 4:21:32.500]  volume that we're doing
[4:21:32.500 --> 4:21:35.100]  and not for the kind of volume that the market is doing you believe they
[4:21:35.100 --> 4:21:38.620]  terrorize the public and in the bailout look at the market plunging
[4:21:38.620 --> 4:21:42.340]  all that's what they did it first of all of the you know everybody assumed that
[4:21:42.340 --> 4:21:44.740]  was that was jumping into this thing
[4:21:44.740 --> 4:21:48.180]  that everything was going to be hunky dory if they did this while it's obvious
[4:21:48.180 --> 4:21:51.940]  that the united states dollar is going to be doomed because they're printing so
[4:21:51.940 --> 4:21:55.220]  much more money that's a that's a foregone conclusion yeah it is just the
[4:21:55.220 --> 4:21:58.860]  beginning of the bailout folks while the money still has value
[4:21:58.860 --> 4:22:02.300]  get into gold and silver now you're insane here's the number now what i tell
[4:22:02.300 --> 4:22:06.060]  the brokers when they call so that they get last friday's prices thirty something
[4:22:06.060 --> 4:22:09.100]  dollars all they have to do is call in and say hey look i've heard it on the
[4:22:09.100 --> 4:22:12.980]  alex jones show it's the alex jones special you're going to get the prices
[4:22:12.980 --> 4:22:15.300]  that definitely a better price because
[4:22:15.300 --> 4:22:19.340]  i can tell you right now the markets higher and and you can call everywhere
[4:22:19.340 --> 4:22:21.620]  across the united states of that people call up
[4:22:21.620 --> 4:22:24.860]  and it's like well how fast can i get it well it's going to take your check it's
[4:22:24.860 --> 4:22:27.820]  going to get any idea they call another dealer and find out it's going to take
[4:22:27.820 --> 4:22:30.420]  them three four weeks just to get the stuff shipped
[4:22:30.420 --> 4:22:32.860]  uh... ten anderson has it
[4:22:32.860 --> 4:22:34.420]  ten anderson has it
[4:22:34.420 --> 4:22:37.460]  now now that you've got some other coins in your well either either i have it
[4:22:37.460 --> 4:22:40.900]  right here my safer it's being shipped to be right but yeah but then what is in
[4:22:40.900 --> 4:22:43.700]  your side as you told me you had a lot of stuff customers
[4:22:43.700 --> 4:22:46.620]  weeks ago i had had had had sold you
[4:22:46.620 --> 4:22:49.060]  i mean i know there's a little of this little of that you want to do the
[4:22:49.060 --> 4:22:52.820]  offers of some of smaller watch you've got well i tell you what i really don't
[4:22:52.820 --> 4:22:55.860]  have much because the demand right now and i really hate to even say it you know
[4:22:55.860 --> 4:22:56.580]  i've got a
[4:22:56.580 --> 4:23:00.140]  i've got a small amount of some some fractional gold coins you can ask for
[4:23:00.140 --> 4:23:00.940]  those
[4:23:00.940 --> 4:23:04.140]  i would really suggest if you want to get into something probably those ten
[4:23:04.140 --> 4:23:05.340]  dollar indians are
[4:23:05.340 --> 4:23:07.060]  are going to be one of your best buys
[4:23:07.060 --> 4:23:11.380]  uh... certainly uh... the silver right now i mean is in such short supply was
[4:23:11.380 --> 4:23:11.860]  in
[4:23:11.860 --> 4:23:15.140]  it was in short supply coming into this backwards over is about three dollars
[4:23:15.140 --> 4:23:16.780]  and fifty cents an ounce
[4:23:16.780 --> 4:23:20.340]  every mine that was in the direct production of silver pretty well shut
[4:23:20.340 --> 4:23:20.980]  down
[4:23:20.980 --> 4:23:24.220]  only the byproduct mines are still putting out in other words the people
[4:23:24.220 --> 4:23:27.540]  that had to pull their already money for something else that was silver as a
[4:23:27.540 --> 4:23:32.100]  but yeah exactly yeah collect copper and and and magninies and and some of
[4:23:32.100 --> 4:23:33.980]  these other nickel you know uh...
[4:23:33.980 --> 4:23:37.260]  these other products that need to be used in the industry and silver just
[4:23:37.260 --> 4:23:40.300]  happened to be a small little section of whatever came out so they sold what
[4:23:40.300 --> 4:23:41.220]  they had
[4:23:41.220 --> 4:23:42.180]  right now
[4:23:42.180 --> 4:23:45.580]  they because all those mines shutting down and and the in the government
[4:23:45.580 --> 4:23:47.900]  just won't let you set up a new mine i mean it
[4:23:47.900 --> 4:23:51.660]  is strip mining just as you know horrendous work to go it's insane i mean
[4:23:51.660 --> 4:23:53.420]  this market is so manipulated
[4:23:53.420 --> 4:23:56.180]  uh... it should be a three thousand right now against you have trouble getting
[4:23:56.180 --> 4:23:57.020]  any of it
[4:23:57.020 --> 4:24:00.260]  but the price is going up but not like it should be one eight hundred
[4:24:00.260 --> 4:24:02.420]  one eight hundred six eight six
[4:24:02.420 --> 4:24:04.140]  two two three seven you cannot
[4:24:04.140 --> 4:24:07.660]  beat these deals are also makes the whole network possible might as owns or
[4:24:07.660 --> 4:24:09.060]  as a partners with genesis
[4:24:09.060 --> 4:24:12.740]  that owns both companies fabulous gotta get your gold and silver from one eight
[4:24:12.740 --> 4:24:17.220]  hundred six eight six two two three seven ten in two minutes closing comments
[4:24:17.220 --> 4:24:20.420]  yet just real quick just take a little take a look at what's going on in the
[4:24:20.420 --> 4:24:24.300]  world market right now it it started last week in the national market use
[4:24:24.300 --> 4:24:26.940]  you're seeing it here in the united states in this meltdown of all these
[4:24:26.940 --> 4:24:28.180]  big corporations
[4:24:28.180 --> 4:24:30.220]  expect to see the equivalent of that
[4:24:30.220 --> 4:24:31.460]  over in europe
[4:24:31.460 --> 4:24:35.740]  and uh... and and and that's going to just if you were at a lot of fuel to the
[4:24:35.740 --> 4:24:39.180]  fire we're certainly looking at some really horrific times
[4:24:39.180 --> 4:24:40.540]  and i just got to say
[4:24:40.540 --> 4:24:44.140]  you know get your gold get your guns get your food storage get your water
[4:24:44.140 --> 4:24:44.940]  filters
[4:24:44.940 --> 4:24:48.420]  be prepared and not only just for you but think about your neighbors around you
[4:24:48.420 --> 4:24:49.020]  as well
[4:24:49.020 --> 4:24:53.300]  try to educate as many people as possible because it is a serious serious time
[4:24:53.300 --> 4:24:57.660]  never entering into alex and i just i can't say enough i don't want this to be
[4:24:57.660 --> 4:25:02.140]  this way i fought so hard to the nail to try to get a sound currency system in
[4:25:02.140 --> 4:25:05.860]  here i must have put a hundred thousand dollars into the ron paul campaign
[4:25:05.860 --> 4:25:09.620]  trying to get people to wake up their planes and everything i mean if we had a
[4:25:09.620 --> 4:25:12.300]  gold standard right now whose business do you think would slow down to
[4:25:12.300 --> 4:25:16.020]  practically nothing it would be mine people don't need to have gold if there's
[4:25:16.020 --> 4:25:20.420]  a gold standard i practically would have ruined my business we got what i was
[4:25:20.420 --> 4:25:21.580]  asking for
[4:25:21.580 --> 4:25:24.900]  and i can tell you right now my heart is with the nation i want to see this
[4:25:24.900 --> 4:25:29.300]  car on the same way we have spoken out against the bankers the bailouts all of
[4:25:29.300 --> 4:25:30.980]  it because we know
[4:25:30.980 --> 4:25:33.980]  i mean we're upset meted now say yeah we've been proven right about everything
[4:25:33.980 --> 4:25:35.180]  but god it's horrible
[4:25:35.180 --> 4:25:38.020]  yet isn't that i want to be a doctor saying this cancer is going to kill you
[4:25:38.020 --> 4:25:39.980]  we're not pleased with the fact we were right
[4:25:39.980 --> 4:25:44.060]  no no absolutely not absolutely there's nothing there is nothing good about what's
[4:25:44.060 --> 4:25:45.260]  going on right now
[4:25:45.260 --> 4:25:48.380]  uh... we should be back i mean that's really the one thing that is good that
[4:25:48.380 --> 4:25:49.540]  might come out of this
[4:25:49.540 --> 4:25:53.180]  is maybe just maybe the people the united states of america will finally
[4:25:53.180 --> 4:25:54.060]  insist
[4:25:54.060 --> 4:25:56.620]  upon constitutional values here
[4:25:56.620 --> 4:25:59.620]  and that's that would be the very thing that could possibly happen
[4:25:59.620 --> 4:26:03.420]  the other side of this is that ellis is going to play in like you're describing
[4:26:03.420 --> 4:26:06.340]  the elite is going to come in they keep on
[4:26:06.340 --> 4:26:09.180]  they keep on putting out you know there there's problems and then they come in
[4:26:09.180 --> 4:26:12.220]  as the saviors and they end up taking more of our liberties away
[4:26:12.220 --> 4:26:15.940]  hopefully the people are smart enough to wake up to this and and to stop it
[4:26:15.940 --> 4:26:19.980]  absolutely we have a steve watson article up on prison planet dot com
[4:26:19.980 --> 4:26:24.300]  ron paul bailout on constitutional special interest force bill
[4:26:24.300 --> 4:26:25.340]  congress
[4:26:25.340 --> 4:26:28.820]  and he goes through the fact and martial law was threatened last week
[4:26:28.820 --> 4:26:31.740]  people to get the story out to people can you believe ted
[4:26:31.740 --> 4:26:34.580]  that i actually had a congressman who said on the floor they were threatening
[4:26:34.580 --> 4:26:34.980]  them
[4:26:34.980 --> 4:26:38.100]  with martial law and basically abolishing congress
[4:26:38.100 --> 4:26:40.820]  if they didn't go along with the bailout i mean this is so
[4:26:40.820 --> 4:26:45.340]  criminal scenes reporting and they use the army against the american people
[4:26:45.340 --> 4:26:46.460]  that's just sad
[4:26:46.460 --> 4:26:49.300]  it really is sad i mean who would have ever
[4:26:49.300 --> 4:26:52.020]  i mean we've talked about this stuff for so many years and people probably
[4:26:52.020 --> 4:26:53.780]  thought we're cuckoo you know
[4:26:53.780 --> 4:26:57.180]  and here it is unfolding right from everybody's eyes and it's just it's not
[4:26:57.180 --> 4:26:59.700]  that like you said it's not that i want to be right i don't think you want to
[4:26:59.700 --> 4:27:01.220]  be right about the stuff either
[4:27:01.220 --> 4:27:03.660]  it's just that this is what's going on
[4:27:03.660 --> 4:27:07.180]  and when you tell the truth and it finally comes to pass
[4:27:07.180 --> 4:27:10.380]  you know and people wake up on my god they're right about this you know
[4:27:10.380 --> 4:27:14.060]  ron paul was right about having precious metals of money
[4:27:14.060 --> 4:27:16.900]  there's still people out there that are that don't believe that
[4:27:16.900 --> 4:27:20.220]  you know it's it's crazy look at this bloomberg article i'm gonna put on screen
[4:27:20.220 --> 4:27:23.740]  for prison planet dot tv viewers were to go ahead and go to thirty three after
[4:27:23.740 --> 4:27:27.180]  so we can just skip the break and meet with rebroadcast as i was analyzing the
[4:27:27.180 --> 4:27:28.380]  total police state
[4:27:28.380 --> 4:27:31.620]  banking takeover in the first hour key info you missed it than david i coming
[4:27:31.620 --> 4:27:32.260]  up
[4:27:32.260 --> 4:27:34.420]  but uh...
[4:27:34.420 --> 4:27:36.540]  fed may see company states
[4:27:36.540 --> 4:27:38.620]  as next crisis fronts and they say
[4:27:38.620 --> 4:27:41.740]  we're gonna bail out states meaning the banks with our money are going to buy
[4:27:41.740 --> 4:27:44.340]  because they get the assets any state stuff they want
[4:27:44.340 --> 4:27:45.980]  any private companies they want
[4:27:45.980 --> 4:27:47.900]  i mean this is so criminal
[4:27:47.900 --> 4:27:52.260]  they get immunity they take our money and buy stuff at full value
[4:27:52.260 --> 4:27:54.020]  for private institutions
[4:27:54.020 --> 4:27:57.340]  yeah you know and in the public it's nothing i'm not for socialism by the
[4:27:57.340 --> 4:27:57.700]  way
[4:27:57.700 --> 4:27:58.980]  but we're gonna have it
[4:27:58.980 --> 4:28:01.940]  it might as well be for the people i mean ten
[4:28:01.940 --> 4:28:04.780]  this is even worse than i thought it could be well just think about the deal
[4:28:04.780 --> 4:28:09.220]  that they offered right now they can buy as much bad papers they want to add of
[4:28:09.220 --> 4:28:10.940]  at a steep discount
[4:28:10.940 --> 4:28:14.180]  and they can sell it back to the united states government at a profit
[4:28:14.180 --> 4:28:18.140]  yeah i don't even know uh... i don't know how they can justify that well
[4:28:18.140 --> 4:28:19.900]  here's a report from one guardian
[4:28:19.900 --> 4:28:23.220]  now wall street may show seven hundred billion dollar bailout
[4:28:23.220 --> 4:28:26.220]  in a bunch of other private banks institutions are saying
[4:28:26.220 --> 4:28:29.020]  this allows federal regulators to come in with money
[4:28:29.020 --> 4:28:32.220]  and if we sign on to any of this sometimes they force it
[4:28:32.220 --> 4:28:34.540]  uh... then then we have no rights
[4:28:34.540 --> 4:28:36.340]  and our company's taken over
[4:28:36.340 --> 4:28:38.580]  so see there's also that dead go ahead
[4:28:38.580 --> 4:28:41.620]  yeah i guess i didn't think about that factor what if they decide to come in
[4:28:41.620 --> 4:28:45.580]  and take over the company that you're working for the one that you own
[4:28:45.580 --> 4:28:48.660]  it's it's it's craziness man i it is complete
[4:28:48.660 --> 4:28:51.500]  complete a hundred eighty degree
[4:28:51.500 --> 4:28:52.580]  turn from
[4:28:52.580 --> 4:28:56.380]  what the constitution says if somebody has a crooked toenail
[4:28:56.380 --> 4:28:58.740]  they will come after somebody in any business
[4:28:58.740 --> 4:29:01.980]  and now now in the new bailout provision global
[4:29:01.980 --> 4:29:05.260]  uh... greenhouse taxes uh... carbon taxes
[4:29:05.260 --> 4:29:07.260]  a carbon cap and trade taxes
[4:29:07.260 --> 4:29:08.620]  regulation
[4:29:08.620 --> 4:29:11.100]  uh... they're gonna change the whole tax code for this
[4:29:11.100 --> 4:29:13.100]  uh... it's also in there
[4:29:13.100 --> 4:29:15.940]  people obsessed on support there'll forget the hundred and fifty billion
[4:29:15.940 --> 4:29:19.820]  port barrel they tacked on that's nothing folks they have it with secret
[4:29:19.820 --> 4:29:21.180]  irs spies
[4:29:21.180 --> 4:29:23.820]  thousands of new agents setting up businesses
[4:29:23.820 --> 4:29:28.900]  trying to set you up and catch you in a mistake spies the irs running stings
[4:29:28.900 --> 4:29:32.580]  having their own money for informants they can spend taxpayer money on themselves
[4:29:32.580 --> 4:29:33.580]  personally
[4:29:33.580 --> 4:29:35.820]  you couldn't make this up dead
[4:29:35.820 --> 4:29:38.180]  now it's it's just so sad
[4:29:38.180 --> 4:29:43.180]  i mean i mean it's it is the worst piece of legislation that i've ever heard of
[4:29:43.180 --> 4:29:45.740]  and here it is happening right our own lifetime
[4:29:45.740 --> 4:29:48.940]  and everybody in the united states said no
[4:29:48.940 --> 4:29:51.220]  ninety percent like you said didn't want it
[4:29:51.220 --> 4:29:52.860]  and they did it anyways
[4:29:52.860 --> 4:29:56.460]  where in the world of these senators and congressman
[4:29:56.460 --> 4:29:59.340]  in a word their heads are i have no idea
[4:29:59.340 --> 4:30:00.660]  don't they have kids
[4:30:00.660 --> 4:30:03.460]  are they concerned about this nation's future at all
[4:30:03.460 --> 4:30:06.420]  i mean what are they trying to stop a depression
[4:30:06.420 --> 4:30:10.460]  what do you are you are they not the engineer stopping a depression by
[4:30:10.460 --> 4:30:14.260]  fair mongering about a depression you know they know that causes one they're
[4:30:14.260 --> 4:30:17.660]  blowing out the economy as the i'm at the world bank documents say
[4:30:17.660 --> 4:30:20.420]  so they can criminally forcibly
[4:30:20.420 --> 4:30:24.180]  consolidate not dead if somebody just has six dollars they can call them by a
[4:30:24.180 --> 4:30:28.620]  half-silver dollar can't they sure can and somebody wants to buy one indian
[4:30:28.620 --> 4:30:29.980]  or one frank
[4:30:29.980 --> 4:30:31.820]  folks that's how it starts
[4:30:31.820 --> 4:30:36.460]  and again i will i only push what i believe in these is great gold at great
[4:30:36.460 --> 4:30:40.700]  prices great silver at great prices lower than it's currently selling for
[4:30:40.700 --> 4:30:42.460]  this is last week's prices
[4:30:42.460 --> 4:30:46.180]  this is such a good deal it hurts the new world order
[4:30:46.180 --> 4:30:48.540]  if the general public figure this out you would be able to get it you can
[4:30:48.540 --> 4:30:50.380]  almost not get it now
[4:30:50.380 --> 4:30:54.140]  give ted anderson his brokers a call told me alex jones special
[4:30:54.140 --> 4:30:56.660]  on the indians on the franks on the silver
[4:30:56.660 --> 4:30:58.980]  one eight hundred six eight six
[4:30:58.980 --> 4:31:03.420]  two two three seven eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[4:31:03.420 --> 4:31:04.900]  uh... ten anything else
[4:31:04.900 --> 4:31:08.620]  now that's just it i mean i did it doesn't take a rocket scientist figure
[4:31:08.620 --> 4:31:11.980]  out that there's problems right now man i i can tell you i wish people were
[4:31:11.980 --> 4:31:14.540]  this excited about gold five years ago
[4:31:14.540 --> 4:31:17.700]  when the prices were so much lower but i can tell you right now
[4:31:17.700 --> 4:31:21.060]  with the package that we've been just handed by congress and watching what's
[4:31:21.060 --> 4:31:24.140]  going on with europe and knowing that our country is going to be helping bail
[4:31:24.140 --> 4:31:25.100]  them out
[4:31:25.100 --> 4:31:28.700]  uh... the united states dollars going to lose a lot of purchasing power and it's
[4:31:28.700 --> 4:31:29.980]  not going to be a little
[4:31:29.980 --> 4:31:35.300]  it really will resemble things like what we've seen in mexico argentina brazil
[4:31:35.300 --> 4:31:36.540]  colombia
[4:31:36.540 --> 4:31:37.580]  as amia
[4:31:37.580 --> 4:31:42.500]  uh... it's russia i mean you you you german wymer republic it's all the
[4:31:42.500 --> 4:31:43.260]  same
[4:31:43.260 --> 4:31:47.220]  and when you start trying to print your way out of problems with the currency
[4:31:47.220 --> 4:31:48.860]  it's done we're doomed
[4:31:48.860 --> 4:31:53.220]  and that's exactly what i think they can solve a depression alex jones
[4:31:53.220 --> 4:31:57.500]  with by printing money but but i know they know they've made the decision to
[4:31:57.500 --> 4:31:59.280]  fully blow the economy out
[4:31:59.280 --> 4:32:03.020]  set up a police state of the riots unfold they'll use that to scare the
[4:32:03.020 --> 4:32:04.460]  public into accepting
[4:32:04.460 --> 4:32:06.660]  north com and the marshal law
[4:32:06.660 --> 4:32:09.460]  but thank god we've been here warning people so a lot of people listen to us
[4:32:09.460 --> 4:32:12.580]  we have a lot of credibility now ted anderson thanks for talking to us yeah
[4:32:12.580 --> 4:32:16.420]  thanks for having me up again alex you bet uh... but john harmon you can go
[4:32:16.420 --> 4:32:19.420]  ahead and cut off the network link to us now
[4:32:19.420 --> 4:32:21.860]  for the info wars dot com streams
[4:32:21.860 --> 4:32:23.900]  and the prison planet dot tv folks
[4:32:23.900 --> 4:32:27.460]  i'm gonna play a five-minute clip by enough respect
[4:32:27.460 --> 4:32:31.060]  one of the best youtube directors out there he remember a few months ago
[4:32:31.060 --> 4:32:35.740]  i did an analysis with pen and paper on the document cam here in studio
[4:32:35.740 --> 4:32:39.340]  of how the two-party systems keep you in a controlled paradigm from getting
[4:32:39.340 --> 4:32:41.580]  outside the box and seeing the big picture
[4:32:41.580 --> 4:32:44.260]  i want to encourage everybody listening
[4:32:44.260 --> 4:32:47.300]  we need to shatter the left-right paradigm and he's done a great job
[4:32:47.300 --> 4:32:48.540]  put a lot of work
[4:32:48.540 --> 4:32:51.260]  uh... into this if you go
[4:32:51.260 --> 4:32:55.100]  to info wars dot com or prison planet dot com
[4:32:55.100 --> 4:32:57.740]  it's how the elite control politics
[4:32:57.740 --> 4:33:01.020]  uh... is the headline another headline on prison planets how the limonati control
[4:33:01.020 --> 4:33:01.980]  politics
[4:33:01.980 --> 4:33:05.180]  you will see what's on the youtube screen here
[4:33:05.180 --> 4:33:08.340]  now i'm not going to make this big screen i want you to go see it for yourself but
[4:33:08.340 --> 4:33:11.420]  sixty two thousand people have seen this in the months since he put it out
[4:33:11.420 --> 4:33:14.860]  i didn't find this till last night we linked to another ten thousand washington
[4:33:14.860 --> 4:33:16.060]  last few hours
[4:33:16.060 --> 4:33:20.460]  i need this to go mega viral just like the article paul watson's doing today
[4:33:20.460 --> 4:33:24.140]  uh... that i want to leave up prominently for a week about who to blame
[4:33:24.140 --> 4:33:26.800]  the history of the banking collapse how it was engineered
[4:33:26.800 --> 4:33:30.180]  that's also important when this five-minute pieces over will rejoin the
[4:33:30.180 --> 4:33:31.300]  retransmission
[4:33:31.300 --> 4:33:34.020]  with david ike and uh... your phone calls
[4:33:34.020 --> 4:33:36.780]  and uh... my analysis on the implosion
[4:33:36.780 --> 4:33:38.140]  as well
[4:33:38.140 --> 4:33:40.620]  but i want to uh... go ahead
[4:33:40.620 --> 4:33:41.740]  right now
[4:33:41.740 --> 4:33:43.420]  and uh... play
[4:33:43.420 --> 4:33:44.660]  this clip
[4:33:44.660 --> 4:33:45.820]  for everybody
[4:33:45.820 --> 4:33:47.780]  that is patiently
[4:33:47.780 --> 4:33:49.260]  patiently holding
[4:33:49.260 --> 4:33:53.020]  out there streaming off my laptop so the audios not as good but i want to thank
[4:33:53.020 --> 4:33:55.260]  enough respect and all the folks that are on youtube
[4:33:55.260 --> 4:33:58.180]  doing things like this because that's our force multiplying
[4:33:58.180 --> 4:33:59.780]  that's how we're having a
[4:33:59.780 --> 4:34:01.180]  uh... gigantic
[4:34:01.180 --> 4:34:02.380]  affect
[4:34:02.380 --> 4:34:07.060]  out there with people so i'm gonna go ahead and play this video for everybody
[4:34:07.060 --> 4:34:09.860]  uh... right now because it is just so
[4:34:09.860 --> 4:34:13.180]  vitally important and for everybody else will be back live tomorrow
[4:34:13.180 --> 4:34:17.060]  eleven two three p m central standard time but when this ends will go back
[4:34:17.060 --> 4:34:18.420]  into the audio stream
[4:34:18.420 --> 4:34:22.180]  uh... retransmission so overdrive ends in five minutes fifty seconds
[4:34:22.180 --> 4:34:29.180]  when this piece is completed
[4:34:29.380 --> 4:34:30.740]  i wanted to
[4:34:30.740 --> 4:34:32.860]  draw a picture
[4:34:32.860 --> 4:34:34.860]  uh... for
[4:34:34.860 --> 4:34:38.100]  listeners out there a very simple crude picture
[4:34:38.100 --> 4:34:42.020]  that describes effectively the false left-right paradigm
[4:34:42.020 --> 4:34:44.020]  the republican party props up
[4:34:44.020 --> 4:34:48.460]  the democratic party in the democratic party props up the republican party
[4:34:48.460 --> 4:34:50.300]  if you had
[4:34:50.300 --> 4:34:52.260]  one of the political parties
[4:34:52.260 --> 4:34:55.260]  standing on its own
[4:34:55.260 --> 4:34:57.300]  standing on its own
[4:34:57.300 --> 4:34:59.860]  when the wind came along it would just fall over
[4:34:59.860 --> 4:35:00.940]  when pressure
[4:35:00.940 --> 4:35:04.660]  revolutionary pressure from the population not liking what's going on
[4:35:04.660 --> 4:35:07.500]  or new groups wanting the power structure
[4:35:07.500 --> 4:35:11.100]  which is the main source of uh... revolution
[4:35:11.100 --> 4:35:15.420]  most of it is driven by evil is like the elite is driven by evil
[4:35:15.420 --> 4:35:19.220]  very rare to have a altruistic revolution
[4:35:19.220 --> 4:35:24.940]  by itself in a single-party system will fall over
[4:35:24.940 --> 4:35:27.260]  but
[4:35:27.260 --> 4:35:31.860]  if you take the two-party systems and you lean them up against each other
[4:35:31.860 --> 4:35:33.260]  this is basically
[4:35:33.260 --> 4:35:35.700]  the arch
[4:35:35.700 --> 4:35:38.260]  their force going together
[4:35:38.260 --> 4:35:39.580]  keeps them together
[4:35:39.580 --> 4:35:40.700]  and makes it
[4:35:40.700 --> 4:35:44.580]  become a very strong stable platform
[4:35:44.580 --> 4:35:46.740]  on which
[4:35:46.740 --> 4:35:48.900]  they can build their hierarchical
[4:35:48.900 --> 4:35:51.220]  new world order system
[4:35:51.220 --> 4:35:52.700]  okay
[4:35:52.700 --> 4:35:54.580]  so the current two-party system
[4:35:54.580 --> 4:35:59.940]  has been dominated and bought up and controlled by the elite sits atop it
[4:35:59.940 --> 4:36:01.140]  now the elite
[4:36:01.140 --> 4:36:03.060]  with a one-party system
[4:36:03.060 --> 4:36:04.980]  would not be balanced
[4:36:04.980 --> 4:36:06.980]  on top of one party
[4:36:06.980 --> 4:36:11.580]  they would be subject to being toppled
[4:36:11.580 --> 4:36:13.980]  being pushed over
[4:36:13.980 --> 4:36:17.380]  easily
[4:36:17.380 --> 4:36:20.060]  you put the two parties up against each other
[4:36:20.060 --> 4:36:23.020]  they form a royal arch
[4:36:23.020 --> 4:36:24.500]  and now
[4:36:24.500 --> 4:36:29.020]  it's very hard to separate those two because they're leaning
[4:36:29.020 --> 4:36:31.220]  up against each other
[4:36:31.220 --> 4:36:35.300]  i mean this is really simple but i want to explain this to people
[4:36:35.300 --> 4:36:37.100]  check it out folks
[4:36:37.100 --> 4:36:41.940]  why do you see so many leftists who mean well like regi and some machine
[4:36:41.940 --> 4:36:43.980]  tomorello or
[4:36:43.980 --> 4:36:47.700]  henry rollins who are right on so many issues but then believe in leftist
[4:36:47.700 --> 4:36:50.780]  policies we need a global carbon tax
[4:36:50.780 --> 4:36:52.780]  but there's an elite funding there
[4:36:52.780 --> 4:36:54.060]  no no no the elite
[4:36:54.060 --> 4:36:57.340]  the big corporations are against it because the media advertises
[4:36:57.340 --> 4:37:01.580]  that big corporations and world companies are against it henry rollins doesn't know
[4:37:01.580 --> 4:37:04.700]  doesn't have the documents
[4:37:04.700 --> 4:37:07.820]  it doesn't understand that actually that's part of a sophisticated game
[4:37:07.820 --> 4:37:09.420]  that all
[4:37:09.420 --> 4:37:12.780]  the big corporations say publicly we don't want this it's bad while they actually
[4:37:12.780 --> 4:37:14.180]  fund it
[4:37:14.180 --> 4:37:16.980]  they know the public's awaited the fact that they're corrupt
[4:37:16.980 --> 4:37:18.900]  for the public will be fooled
[4:37:18.900 --> 4:37:20.580]  and go and support
[4:37:20.580 --> 4:37:21.820]  the agenda
[4:37:21.820 --> 4:37:24.700]  it's please don't throw me in the briar patch it's the old uh...
[4:37:24.700 --> 4:37:27.820]  raya rabbi situation
[4:37:27.820 --> 4:37:30.700]  here's the political a field
[4:37:30.700 --> 4:37:32.980]  this is where the population resides
[4:37:32.980 --> 4:37:36.700]  and then we supposedly the grass roots
[4:37:36.700 --> 4:37:43.500]  come up into the political party
[4:37:43.500 --> 4:37:46.100]  and then they lean on each other as i was saying earlier
[4:37:46.100 --> 4:37:48.660]  and support each other they're standing alone
[4:37:48.660 --> 4:37:49.740]  the pressure
[4:37:49.740 --> 4:37:53.660]  of revolution or of new power structure will easily topple it and blow it over
[4:37:53.660 --> 4:37:56.220]  but leaning together
[4:37:56.220 --> 4:38:00.340]  it's not going to fall down
[4:38:00.340 --> 4:38:01.500]  i know that simple
[4:38:01.500 --> 4:38:05.180]  but but let me give you an everyday example of this as i said the left
[4:38:05.180 --> 4:38:08.900]  sees all of these evil mainline republicans we know we're liars
[4:38:08.900 --> 4:38:11.780]  and the media even exposes being liars
[4:38:11.780 --> 4:38:13.900]  they see them lying about everything else so
[4:38:13.900 --> 4:38:15.860]  if the republicans come out and say
[4:38:15.860 --> 4:38:21.020]  we're against a global carbon tax well then by god i'm for a global carbon tax
[4:38:21.020 --> 4:38:23.820]  and so that's how
[4:38:23.820 --> 4:38:28.980]  the two sides leaning up against each other
[4:38:28.980 --> 4:38:31.460]  the other side support
[4:38:31.460 --> 4:38:32.380]  and so
[4:38:32.380 --> 4:38:33.700]  democrats
[4:38:33.700 --> 4:38:37.580]  over here republicans over here republicans attack
[4:38:37.580 --> 4:38:39.440]  barack obama
[4:38:39.440 --> 4:38:42.980]  and then the democrats attack john mccain
[4:38:42.980 --> 4:38:46.700]  and then the population is down here is trained to see john mccain representing
[4:38:46.700 --> 4:38:47.820]  them personally
[4:38:47.820 --> 4:38:51.460]  as being their daddy of where their personal power comes from of their camp
[4:38:51.460 --> 4:38:54.580]  their brand name their their brand of
[4:38:54.580 --> 4:38:55.860]  soda
[4:38:55.860 --> 4:38:57.420]  their brand of automobile
[4:38:57.420 --> 4:38:58.860]  ford or shabby
[4:38:58.860 --> 4:38:59.980]  and so this is a
[4:38:59.980 --> 4:39:01.020]  controlled
[4:39:01.020 --> 4:39:02.300]  paradigm
[4:39:02.300 --> 4:39:04.420]  and so we have
[4:39:04.420 --> 4:39:08.180]  we have republicans attacking democrats and that's the force against them and you
[4:39:08.180 --> 4:39:10.940]  have democrats attacking republicans and that's the force against them
[4:39:10.940 --> 4:39:12.820]  and really it's one unit
[4:39:12.820 --> 4:39:14.340]  supporting themselves
[4:39:14.340 --> 4:39:16.420]  and containing revolution
[4:39:16.420 --> 4:39:18.940]  so that the people
[4:39:18.940 --> 4:39:21.020]  who were down here
[4:39:21.020 --> 4:39:25.580]  never learned that there is a world outside
[4:39:25.580 --> 4:39:27.500]  of
[4:39:27.500 --> 4:39:28.980]  this controlled paradigm
[4:39:28.980 --> 4:39:32.620]  we are locked within the left-right paradigm
[4:39:32.620 --> 4:39:34.940]  and then it becomes this huge pageant
[4:39:34.940 --> 4:39:39.100]  this huge distraction where we analyze every every facet of the two political
[4:39:39.100 --> 4:39:40.060]  parties
[4:39:40.060 --> 4:39:44.060]  never realizing they themselves are simply a front or puppets
[4:39:44.060 --> 4:39:46.140]  for a larger power structure
[4:39:46.140 --> 4:39:48.140]  now this is incredibly simple
[4:39:48.140 --> 4:39:52.700]  but that's how this works and then the two parties can limit the issues
[4:39:52.700 --> 4:39:54.100]  that are debated
[4:39:54.100 --> 4:39:55.620]  to this controlled paradigm
[4:39:55.620 --> 4:39:57.220]  they can limit
[4:39:57.220 --> 4:39:58.940]  the scope of differences
