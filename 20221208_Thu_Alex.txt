[00:00.000 --> 00:13.040]  By opening the floodgates to unfettered free speech, Elon Musk has allowed hate to spread
[00:13.040 --> 00:15.520]  far and fast on Twitter.
[00:15.520 --> 00:21.160]  While the left winds out another distraction about Matt Taiibbi, catering to the richest
[00:21.160 --> 00:27.120]  man in the world, what do the Twitter files reveal about the inner workings of, as Taiibbi
[00:27.120 --> 00:35.080]  described, a Frankensteinian tale of a human-built mechanism grown out of the control of its designer.
[00:35.080 --> 00:41.280]  By 2020, requests from the New World Ordered Disciples to delete tweets were routine.
[00:41.280 --> 00:45.520]  One executive would write to another, more to review from the Biden team.
[00:45.520 --> 00:47.800]  The reply would come back, handled.
[00:47.800 --> 00:54.440]  Twitter was acting as a wrecking ball of political tech censorship, catering to the corrupt Washington
[00:54.440 --> 01:01.040]  establishment, directly impacting and propagandizing a digital town square, which affected the
[01:01.040 --> 01:07.240]  general welfare of the United States, whose lifeblood is protected by the power and freedom
[01:07.240 --> 01:08.240]  of the First Amendment.
[01:08.240 --> 01:13.760]  And if it turns out there are a lot of us on this list, where the DNC targeted us, and
[01:13.760 --> 01:20.280]  I will quote the immortal words of Joseph Welch when he attacked Joe McCarthy for the
[01:20.280 --> 01:25.920]  enemies list he had, at long laughter, have you no shame.
[01:25.920 --> 01:26.920]  Yes.
[01:26.920 --> 01:37.480]  President Biden, all of your sassy little operatives in the DNC who have targeted American citizens,
[01:37.480 --> 01:43.360]  have you, Mr. President, have all of you, at last, no shame.
[01:43.360 --> 01:50.760]  Taiibhi points out that both parties had access to these tools, for instance, in 2020, requests
[01:50.760 --> 01:56.960]  from both the Trump White House and the Biden campaign were received and honored.
[01:56.960 --> 02:03.000]  But the overwhelming amount of leftist Marxist cucks staffed at Twitter ensured that Democrat
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.040]  party requests took the front burner, a fact backed up by the overall donations by Twitter
[02:09.040 --> 02:22.040]  to the Democrat party reaching 99.73% or $165,969 to Democrats, while $451 went to Republicans
[02:22.040 --> 02:23.040]  in 2022.
[02:23.040 --> 02:25.760]  Are you worried about these Twitter files coming out?
[02:25.760 --> 02:31.040]  What was that experience like having Kellyanne, who's always in control of herself, sickening
[02:31.040 --> 02:33.800]  this mega trolls on you?
[02:33.800 --> 02:34.800]  It's terrifying.
[02:34.800 --> 02:40.800]  When you get targeted in some of these ways, it's hard to differentiate between what is
[02:40.800 --> 02:44.840]  somebody just online trying to rattle you and what's a real threat.
[02:44.840 --> 02:51.160]  You see in things like Pizza Gate that online conspiracies can mobilize very real and very
[02:51.160 --> 02:53.320]  direct offline violence.
[02:53.320 --> 02:59.360]  I saw those harms, I experienced those harms, and now it was those harms through a mainstream
[02:59.360 --> 03:04.280]  news outlet being held up in the Oval Office by the former president of the United States,
[03:04.280 --> 03:06.760]  and that is deeply terrifying.
[03:06.760 --> 03:12.280]  What does appear to be illegal to the point of treason is that a false narrative of possible
[03:12.280 --> 03:19.160]  foreign hacks supposedly behind the Biden laptop debacle was manufactured by Silicon
[03:19.160 --> 03:22.160]  Valley, the media, and the DNC.
[03:22.160 --> 03:27.840]  Well we know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin.
[03:27.840 --> 03:32.320]  That's been clear for well over a year now that they've been pushing this false narrative
[03:32.320 --> 03:34.480]  about the vice president and his son.
[03:34.480 --> 03:40.320]  According to internal emails, there was zero evidence of foreign interference occurring.
[03:40.320 --> 03:45.920]  What did occur was a meltdown of internal Twitter censorship spearheaded by top Twitter
[03:45.920 --> 03:52.520]  management with the result of ultimately burying a critical story under false pretenses in
[03:52.520 --> 03:58.760]  order to sway popular opinion and alter the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
[03:58.760 --> 04:04.520]  In retrospect, we now know that as the New York Post reported, nearly four of five Americans
[04:04.520 --> 04:09.640]  who've been following the Hunter Biden laptop scandal believe that truthful coverage would
[04:09.640 --> 04:13.960]  have changed the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
[04:13.960 --> 04:19.120]  And an even higher number, 81 percent, said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland should
[04:19.120 --> 04:21.040]  investigate the laptop.
[04:21.040 --> 04:26.480]  Not only have Twitter employees like Head of Legal, Policy and Trust, Vijaya Gadi,
[04:26.480 --> 04:33.440]  and Trust and Safety Chief Yole Roth proven that they willingly altered the 2020 U.S.
[04:33.440 --> 04:38.880]  presidential election, but they have demonstrated that Silicon Valley, the Mockingbird Media
[04:38.880 --> 04:44.280]  and the corruption in Washington is an occupying force and a direct threat to the stability
[04:44.280 --> 04:47.440]  and the future of the United States of America.
[04:47.440 --> 04:51.920]  This cyber insurrection is what I'm calling it, is an assault on this country and it's
[04:51.920 --> 04:58.920]  a corn-lined treason if you think about what the executives did at Twitter.
[05:21.920 --> 05:27.240]  So that means even on orders that are below $50, you're going to be paying way lower than
[05:27.240 --> 05:28.240]  you were previously.
[05:28.240 --> 05:33.100]  This is a game changer, we're so excited about it, our listeners have really asked for free
[05:33.100 --> 05:37.480]  shipping again, we couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor
[05:37.480 --> 05:38.640]  we're able to do it.
[05:38.640 --> 05:44.200]  So now your orders will be shipped even faster, the same great customer service and more.
[05:44.200 --> 05:50.240]  So get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at infoorstore.com right
[05:50.240 --> 05:51.240]  now.
[05:51.240 --> 05:54.680]  We thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system,
[05:54.680 --> 06:24.600]  lead a healthier life and keep invoices on the air at infoorstore.com.
[06:24.600 --> 06:26.600]  Your host, Owen Troyer.
[06:26.600 --> 06:37.280]  It's truly an honor and a privilege to be with you here on this Thursday, December 8th,
[06:37.280 --> 06:43.360]  2022 edition of the Alex Jones show.
[06:43.360 --> 06:50.760]  Yesterday I said to the crew when I found out I would be doing double duty today, I said
[06:50.760 --> 06:56.960]  let's get Darren Beatty on, he's constantly following big news stories, he'll probably
[06:56.960 --> 07:04.040]  have something big to break and then surely enough today there are a bunch of January
[07:04.040 --> 07:09.320]  6th developments and so Darren Beatty is going to be joining us to discuss that and some other
[07:09.320 --> 07:16.520]  things he's breaking at revolver.news.
[07:16.520 --> 07:25.360]  There's a couple stories today that really just show you where the world is going and
[07:25.360 --> 07:35.960]  you know there's a way, I'm a believer in metaphysics if you will call it karma, but
[07:35.960 --> 07:43.480]  there are multiple stories today that if we, the people, not just of America, but of planet
[07:43.480 --> 07:48.720]  earth don't have a problem with this, then in a way we deserve what we get and it's not
[07:48.720 --> 07:55.760]  even fair to say that, you don't deserve to be a slave, you don't deserve to be abused
[07:55.760 --> 08:00.680]  by your government, you don't deserve to live in fear, you don't deserve to work your entire
[08:00.680 --> 08:06.240]  life and pay a quarter of your earnings to the government that they then dole out however
[08:06.240 --> 08:12.640]  they feel fit giving it to their friends, giving it to wars, laundering it, whatever,
[08:12.640 --> 08:18.040]  you breaking your neck, breaking your back, specifically if you're a small business owner
[08:18.040 --> 08:28.800]  or the entrepreneurial type, you know especially the daunting task of just legally owning and
[08:28.800 --> 08:33.880]  operating a business in this country now, because our government is so out of control
[08:33.880 --> 08:39.160]  and then the fear of not doing it right, that they'll send their goons at the IRS after
[08:39.160 --> 08:48.840]  you or worse, but what am I talking about?
[08:48.840 --> 08:55.480]  How is it that Sam Bankman Freed has not yet been arrested, would somebody like to explain
[08:55.480 --> 08:56.480]  that?
[08:56.480 --> 09:03.360]  Well of course you know the answer, because he does the Democrats money laundering and
[09:03.360 --> 09:09.440]  I'm not even sure how aware Sam Bankman Freed is about what he was up to or what he was
[09:09.440 --> 09:15.840]  being used for still to this day, I'm not sure he has a clue, he seems pretty clueless
[09:15.840 --> 09:23.080]  maybe on the autism spectrum or something like that and that's why his Democrat parents
[09:23.080 --> 09:28.040]  just like the Democrat parents of Caroline Ellison probably a similar story used them
[09:28.040 --> 09:35.580]  as front, a front man and a front woman for the biggest money laundering operation maybe
[09:35.580 --> 09:42.800]  in world history, I mean you could make arguments about what's your definition of money laundering,
[09:42.800 --> 09:52.120]  but just face value, this case is the biggest money laundering story of all time and the
[09:52.120 --> 09:59.400]  people at the front of it have not been arrested and now Maxine Waters who's one of the most
[09:59.400 --> 10:07.360]  corrupt politicians in US history, but she's on the oversight board in the house in charge
[10:07.360 --> 10:12.480]  of investigating stuff like this and she also has her own ethics violations and her and
[10:12.480 --> 10:19.600]  her husband have been bailing out banks and making money in kickbacks all of these years,
[10:19.600 --> 10:30.000]  true, true dirty corrupt people and Maxine Waters says she's not going to subpoena Sam
[10:30.000 --> 10:37.440]  Bankman Freed because you know they're just such good friends, they are just such good
[10:37.440 --> 10:42.080]  friends so now your only hope is that as the Republicans have the Senate that they'll be
[10:42.080 --> 10:46.960]  able to subpoena him, how much you want to bet that doesn't happen, you know who's in
[10:46.960 --> 10:51.280]  charge of the Senate right, Mitch McConnell, you know who took millions of dollars from
[10:51.280 --> 10:56.440]  Sam Bankman Freed right, Mitch McConnell, don't get your hopes up, Sam Bankman Freed
[10:56.440 --> 11:02.880]  is going to walk a free man, see oh you had a little COVID violation, oh you opened your
[11:02.880 --> 11:06.480]  church, you opened your business during COVID while the strip clubs and the liquor stores
[11:06.480 --> 11:13.360]  and the pot stores were all open and you opened your hair salon or you opened your vitamins
[11:13.360 --> 11:23.080]  store or your farmers market and then you dealt with the full onslaught of our big government
[11:23.080 --> 11:29.320]  law enforcement but the biggest money laundering operation not just in terms of dollars, I
[11:29.320 --> 11:33.320]  mean definitely it's in terms of dollars, I mean what are we really looking at, 30 billion
[11:33.320 --> 11:39.720]  dollars missing but the implications of how it went through Ukraine where we're being
[11:39.720 --> 11:43.920]  lied to about a war that we're funding, that we're arming, that nobody else is interested
[11:43.920 --> 11:51.520]  in except us and the two parties involved, that has major implications, the fact that
[11:51.520 --> 11:57.760]  Sam Bankman Freed was donating millions of dollars to the political parties, hundreds
[11:57.760 --> 12:02.560]  of millions even to the Democrats, maybe tens of millions to the Republicans, it's about
[12:02.560 --> 12:08.840]  a 20 to 1 ratio Democrats to Republicans but they're both in there, that has major implications.
[12:08.840 --> 12:15.040]  But see he's not going to be arrested, Caroline Ellison isn't going to be arrested, he's
[12:15.040 --> 12:23.520]  running around the Bahamas and his flip flops and his cargo pants and his Bahama shirt and
[12:23.520 --> 12:27.680]  then Caroline Ellison, she's running around New York City doing whatever she wants, nobody
[12:27.680 --> 12:34.640]  knows, nobody cares and we've reached out to Ben Armstrong, BitBoy Crypto, he's been
[12:34.640 --> 12:42.040]  on before but he's trying to get a group of people to go down there in a form of protest
[12:42.040 --> 12:46.560]  to raise awareness that this crook is on the loose still but he's a good money launderer
[12:46.560 --> 12:53.320]  for the deep state, he's a good money launderer for the Democrats so he gets away with it,
[12:53.320 --> 12:55.240]  he gets away with it.
[12:55.240 --> 12:59.400]  Now why is that so important?
[12:59.400 --> 13:05.440]  Because it shows that justice is dead, it shows that if you're well connected to the
[13:05.440 --> 13:10.520]  deep state, well connected to the Democrat Party or the Republican Party that you're
[13:10.520 --> 13:15.360]  above the law but we the American people, we don't get such treatment, you see, we get
[13:15.360 --> 13:21.800]  treated like dirt by our government, we get treated like scum, they call us terrorists,
[13:21.800 --> 13:30.600]  the bastards, they're the terrorists and then the story out of New Zealand, we had the guests
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.240]  on yesterday, it's so sad when this happens, especially right after people come on our
[13:35.240 --> 13:39.920]  transmission with big news and then the next day they get hit with a hammer, we're not
[13:39.920 --> 13:46.320]  talking Paul Pelosi style, New Zealand takes custody of baby over parents' transfusion
[13:46.320 --> 13:57.400]  and objection because they don't want to get the COVID vaccine blood which is causing
[13:57.400 --> 14:05.160]  quats and strokes and heart attacks and all kinds of stuff and now their baby has been
[14:05.160 --> 14:15.200]  taken from their custody and we have a statement from the parents that were on yesterday that
[14:15.200 --> 14:18.960]  I will read today on the air.
[14:18.960 --> 14:20.460]  So why is that so important?
[14:20.460 --> 14:25.000]  Because it shows you what the medical tyranny is really all about, it's not about keeping
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.920]  you safe, it's not about making sure people have access to medicine or health care, no
[14:31.920 --> 14:38.400]  that's all nonsense, it was always about control and that's what they saw, we're not talking
[14:38.400 --> 14:42.320]  about the globalist that ran the whole scam, Demik, we're talking about your average liberal
[14:42.320 --> 14:53.280]  Democrat that saw a pandemic and said how can I seize power, how can I become more powerful,
[14:53.280 --> 15:03.920]  how can I control the masses, how can I use this fear to intimidate and destroy and then
[15:03.920 --> 15:08.640]  that's what they've done and so you don't want your little baby to get that experimental
[15:08.640 --> 15:12.960]  vaccine, you don't want your little baby to get blood from somebody that's taking the
[15:12.960 --> 15:16.920]  vaccine, you demand pure blood, you lose your baby.
[15:16.920 --> 15:22.400]  Now tell me how that's about health and tell me how that's about safety, it's not, it was
[15:22.400 --> 15:28.960]  always about control so you see you're a slave now, you don't properly adhere to the medical
[15:28.960 --> 15:37.560]  tyranny, you lose your child, you lose your job, you lose your freedom, you lose your
[15:37.560 --> 15:47.420]  bank account and then you realize maybe you're not so free after all.
[15:47.420 --> 15:50.680]  So those are just a couple examples of the stories we have coming up today and of course
[15:50.680 --> 15:55.840]  we'll talk about Brittany Griner being released and some of the details behind that and more
[15:55.840 --> 16:02.800]  today on The Alex Jones Show.
[16:02.800 --> 16:10.640]  As you want it, here's another one just for you because without you it would truly be
[16:10.640 --> 16:18.360]  a blue Christmas but thank God that we have you, all of us awakening and vibrant souls
[16:18.360 --> 16:21.480]  all over the earth.
[16:21.480 --> 16:28.160]  It's your love, our love that makes all of this possible and if you feel like showing
[16:28.160 --> 16:37.520]  us some love today and help keep us on the air, you can do so at infowarstore.com.

[16:50.520 --> 16:58.000]  love you and we thank you for your support.
[16:58.000 --> 17:07.360]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide
[17:07.360 --> 17:12.840]  and it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[17:12.840 --> 17:18.440]  Things are getting very weird and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's
[17:18.440 --> 17:24.040]  going on but we'll keep doing our best so long as you keep us on the air and you can
[17:24.040 --> 17:28.000]  do that now at infowarstore.com.
[17:28.000 --> 17:34.480]  Help us clear out our stock of bodies tumor, vitamin C with zinc and alpha power.
[17:34.480 --> 17:39.640]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available

[17:50.200 --> 17:59.720]  and merry Christmas.
[17:59.720 --> 18:05.200]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness
[18:05.200 --> 18:12.080]  Company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where
[18:12.080 --> 18:17.640]  trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[18:17.640 --> 18:26.800]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[18:26.800 --> 18:35.080]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID,
[18:35.080 --> 18:40.720]  post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes and all the usual things that are seen in primary
[18:40.720 --> 18:42.520]  care.
[18:42.520 --> 18:50.720]  Then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media and health advice.
[18:50.720 --> 19:00.440]  Come see the Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to the Wellness Company.
[19:00.440 --> 19:05.840]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[19:05.840 --> 19:07.880]  a healthier life.
[19:07.880 --> 19:11.720]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[19:11.720 --> 19:13.360]  that contains both.
[19:13.360 --> 19:18.320]  This infowars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[19:18.320 --> 19:19.920]  from the infowars store.
[19:19.920 --> 19:24.760]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[19:24.760 --> 19:27.440]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[19:27.440 --> 19:32.280]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[19:32.280 --> 19:37.000]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[19:37.000 --> 19:38.000]  shown.
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.480]  After vitamin C and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an important role
[19:42.480 --> 19:46.840]  in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[19:46.840 --> 19:51.960]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[19:51.960 --> 19:52.960]  like here in America.
[19:52.960 --> 19:57.760]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise
[19:57.760 --> 20:01.240]  our rose hips don't lie.
[20:01.240 --> 20:10.040]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:10.040 --> 20:24.840]  Man, I'll tell you, we are just in the clown world.
[20:24.840 --> 20:33.280]  Do you ever just sit there and just soak it all in and just say how is this possible?
[20:33.280 --> 20:36.920]  How did humanity get so insane?
[20:36.920 --> 20:38.520]  Can we return from this?
[20:38.520 --> 20:40.040]  Has it always been this way?
[20:40.040 --> 20:45.600]  Are we destined to be run by crooks and demons the rest of our lifetimes?
[20:45.600 --> 20:49.640]  This cannot be the future for humanity.
[20:49.640 --> 20:52.640]  This cannot be the future for America.
[20:52.640 --> 20:57.600]  And I'm just going through some of these clips we'll get to later of the White House Press
[20:57.600 --> 21:01.720]  Secretary, Kareem Jean-Pierre, and I'm not even listening to the clips, I'm just going
[21:01.720 --> 21:08.960]  through the list deciding which ones I want to play, reading the quotes and I'm dying
[21:08.960 --> 21:09.960]  of laughter here.
[21:09.960 --> 21:14.720]  I mean, I'm literally like laughing hysterically because it's so ridiculous.
[21:14.720 --> 21:19.000]  I mean, I've got Kareem Jean-Pierre saying that the White House has been doing great
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.720]  work lowering prices and fighting inflation.
[21:22.720 --> 21:25.720]  What?
[21:25.720 --> 21:29.400]  That's like if I came in today and I, you know, let's say I have somebody that decides
[21:29.400 --> 21:33.520]  my clothes and I say, yeah, I'd like a white shirt with a blue jacket, well, I've got a
[21:33.520 --> 21:36.960]  black shirt with a black jacket.
[21:36.960 --> 21:42.240]  Or me telling the crew, hey, I want an image of the beach behind me.
[21:42.240 --> 21:48.320]  It's woods, it's a coniferous forest with snow.
[21:48.320 --> 21:54.840]  And then saying, look at me in my white shirt with my blue blazer and my beach background.
[21:54.840 --> 21:58.720]  And you'd say, you're wearing a black shirt with a black blazer and you have a winter
[21:58.720 --> 21:59.720]  background.
[21:59.720 --> 22:05.280]  Well, that's the Biden White House, they're fighting inflation and they're lowering costs.
[22:05.280 --> 22:10.520]  But let me just look at this story with the Brittany Griner situation because there's
[22:10.520 --> 22:13.600]  some, I don't think we're getting the full story.
[22:13.600 --> 22:15.440]  I mean, of course we're not.
[22:15.440 --> 22:20.800]  When people are pointing out some of the anomalies, here's the basic facts.
[22:20.800 --> 22:26.400]  Brittany Griner released from a Russian jail in exchange for international arms dealer Victor
[22:26.400 --> 22:31.680]  Bout known as the merchant of death.
[22:31.680 --> 22:34.280]  So this offer was on the table six months ago.
[22:34.280 --> 22:36.280]  Brittany Griner could have been freed six months ago.
[22:36.280 --> 22:38.280]  Why didn't it happen then?
[22:38.280 --> 22:45.480]  Well, the response is that it's because the U.S. was trying to work out a deal, a two-man
[22:45.480 --> 22:52.040]  deal so that they can get Whalen released as well.
[22:52.040 --> 23:03.760]  Now when you look at this, you say, okay, let's try to be reasonable and fair here.
[23:03.760 --> 23:12.080]  And it's pretty obvious that if there was a priority of who was to be released, it would
[23:12.080 --> 23:14.080]  be Paul Whalen.
[23:14.080 --> 23:18.440]  I don't even think that that would be a debate.
[23:18.440 --> 23:28.600]  He's a former U.S. Marine who's been over there for years versus a basketball player
[23:28.600 --> 23:32.360]  who hasn't been there as long.
[23:32.360 --> 23:38.800]  Now maybe if this was like Michael Jordan, you would get it, but still, I think if you're
[23:38.800 --> 23:50.960]  being fully honest, the Marine should probably get the priority considering the status that
[23:50.960 --> 23:58.920]  we claim to revere of U.S. veteran, U.S. Marine.
[23:58.920 --> 24:01.960]  But no, it's a female basketball player.
[24:01.960 --> 24:11.080]  So why did the U.S. prioritize Brittany Griner over Paul Whalen?
[24:11.080 --> 24:20.720]  And we all know why because she's a black, gay woman liberal.
[24:20.720 --> 24:25.320]  And now they know she's going to come back and be a good Democrat spokesperson.
[24:25.320 --> 24:28.200]  She's not going to talk about how grateful she is to be back in the United States of
[24:28.200 --> 24:29.200]  America.
[24:29.200 --> 24:30.200]  I doubt that.
[24:30.200 --> 24:33.360]  She could, but no.
[24:33.360 --> 24:39.540]  Why was Brittany Griner a higher priority for the Biden administration than Paul Whalen?
[24:39.540 --> 24:49.560]  Because of publicity and because she has the right attributes, let's say.
[24:49.560 --> 24:53.800]  Now Brittany, I don't believe she didn't belong in prison.
[24:53.800 --> 24:55.520]  I don't think it should be a crime.
[24:55.520 --> 25:03.120]  She had some weed juice, just like smoking a cigarette pen, but it's for weed.
[25:03.120 --> 25:06.240]  Look, I don't want to get into the whole thing of is Brittany Griner transgender?
[25:06.240 --> 25:07.560]  I just don't even want to go down there.
[25:07.560 --> 25:08.680]  It's pointless.
[25:08.680 --> 25:10.180]  It doesn't matter.
[25:10.180 --> 25:13.120]  And quite frankly, I think if she was, the Russians would have figured it out and probably
[25:13.120 --> 25:14.120]  made a story of it.
[25:14.120 --> 25:15.120]  Maybe not.
[25:15.120 --> 25:16.120]  Maybe they're using it as blackmail.
[25:16.120 --> 25:17.120]  I don't know.
[25:17.120 --> 25:19.240]  I don't really care to go down it.
[25:19.240 --> 25:25.440]  The point is the Biden administration prioritized a basketball player over a Marine.
[25:25.440 --> 25:26.880]  And that should tell you something.
[25:26.880 --> 25:28.000]  There should be something there.
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.120]  Again, that's not a slight to Brittany Griner.
[25:31.120 --> 25:32.120]  Good for her.
[25:32.120 --> 25:33.120]  I'm sure she's so relieved.
[25:33.120 --> 25:35.520]  I don't think she belonged there.
[25:35.520 --> 25:38.040]  But that's Russian laws.
[25:38.040 --> 25:40.360]  And she's not the only one that suffered because of it.
[25:40.360 --> 25:44.400]  But they prioritized, because here's how they look at it.
[25:44.400 --> 25:49.840]  They value a black woman, a gay person, or a basketball player.
[25:49.840 --> 25:52.280]  It could have been any combination of that.
[25:52.280 --> 25:53.280]  She checks all three boxes.
[25:53.280 --> 25:57.760]  It could have just been one of them, and they would have still prioritized that over
[25:57.760 --> 26:01.440]  a U.S. Marine, an American veteran.
[26:01.440 --> 26:06.000]  That's where the Democrat Party is at ideologically.
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.600]  That's where the Democrat Party is at politically.
[26:08.600 --> 26:12.160]  Well, then you ask the other question.
[26:12.160 --> 26:13.160]  Is it worth it?
[26:13.160 --> 26:19.520]  Is the trade worth it to trade an arms dealer known as the merchant of death, a serious
[26:19.520 --> 26:20.520]  criminal?
[26:20.520 --> 26:25.640]  He probably does belong in jail to keep the world safer for a woman that doesn't belong
[26:25.640 --> 26:32.920]  in jail while you're supposedly at war with Russia.
[26:32.920 --> 26:42.640]  So you didn't care about the U.S. Marine enough to get the deal done for him to get out.
[26:42.640 --> 26:47.880]  You then released somebody who's immediately going to be thrown into the war in Ukraine,
[26:47.880 --> 26:52.680]  which the United States stands is a war against Russia, an illegal illegitimate war against
[26:52.680 --> 26:57.880]  Russia that the Biden administration has launched without congressional approval.
[26:57.880 --> 27:02.400]  And this guy's about to go right back into the playing field.
[27:02.400 --> 27:04.760]  And what is Brittany Greiner going to do?
[27:04.760 --> 27:06.600]  Come back and play basketball.
[27:06.600 --> 27:12.080]  And so now you're going to have people fighting this arms dealer, fighting the weapons that
[27:12.080 --> 27:13.880]  he gets.
[27:13.880 --> 27:20.720]  And Brittany Greiner will continue to play basketball in front of tiny audiences.
[27:20.720 --> 27:25.640]  And the U.S. Marine still rots in jail.
[27:25.640 --> 27:27.680]  Now consider this.
[27:27.680 --> 27:36.100]  It was not a coincidence that this happened right after the midterm runoff last night.
[27:36.100 --> 27:38.600]  So that one kind of confuses me.
[27:38.600 --> 27:43.520]  That's definitely not a coincidence, but the Democrats obviously knew to some extent it
[27:43.520 --> 27:51.800]  was bad publicity to trade a basketball player for an arms dealer while you're at war with
[27:51.800 --> 27:53.200]  Russia.
[27:53.200 --> 27:57.760]  They knew that there was enough bad publicity or potential for bad publicity that they did
[27:57.760 --> 28:00.480]  it after the runoff in Georgia.
[28:00.480 --> 28:03.720]  That was not a coincidence.
[28:03.720 --> 28:08.440]  And so now they have more time to steer this narrative and try to turn it into a good thing
[28:08.440 --> 28:13.440]  instead of the obvious gut reaction from so many Americans today, which is, hey, we're
[28:13.440 --> 28:18.240]  glad Brittany Greiner is home, good for her and her wife there.
[28:18.240 --> 28:25.760]  But this is clearly horrible diplomacy from the Biden administration.
[28:25.760 --> 28:28.200]  Clearly the priorities are off.
[28:28.200 --> 28:33.000]  And that would have been everybody's response saying, how does a basketball player get higher
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.480]  priority than a veteran who's been over there longer?
[28:37.480 --> 28:41.400]  But I think there's another, I think there's another ripple to this.
[28:41.400 --> 28:47.480]  And I think it goes into the larger geopolitical issues that we're facing in the world right
[28:47.480 --> 28:48.480]  now.
[28:48.480 --> 28:55.280]  And I'll get into that on the other side, but man, you ever seen a woman dunk like that?
[28:55.280 --> 28:56.280]  We get to see it again.
[28:56.280 --> 28:57.280]  All right.
[28:57.280 --> 28:58.280]  You want a man?

[29:59.280 --> 30:07.680]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air broadcasting free worldwide
[30:07.680 --> 30:13.120]  and it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[30:13.120 --> 30:18.760]  Things are getting very weird and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's
[30:18.760 --> 30:19.760]  going on.
[30:19.760 --> 30:24.800]  But we'll keep doing our best so long as you keep us on the air and you could do that
[30:24.800 --> 30:28.320]  now at infowarstore.com.
[30:28.320 --> 30:34.760]  Help us clear out our stock of bodies, tumor, vitamin C with zinc and alpha power.

[30:42.120 --> 30:45.320]  Now with free shipping.
[30:45.320 --> 30:51.520]  We thank you for your support and we wish you a very peaceful, happy and merry Christmas.
[30:51.520 --> 31:07.080]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[31:07.080 --> 31:11.640]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[31:11.640 --> 31:16.080]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[31:16.080 --> 31:20.920]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, but was killing
[31:20.920 --> 31:24.520]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[31:24.520 --> 31:31.320]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3, but if you're not getting
[31:31.320 --> 31:36.400]  enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[31:36.400 --> 31:39.240]  things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[31:39.240 --> 31:43.160]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[31:43.160 --> 31:47.960]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into
[31:47.960 --> 31:54.160]  your body for 50% off at infowarstore.com with promo code 1776.

[32:00.200 --> 32:05.560]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican
[32:05.560 --> 32:07.160]  victories tonight possible.
[32:07.160 --> 32:11.360]  The only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible.
[32:11.360 --> 32:16.200]  The only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the
[32:16.200 --> 32:21.960]  school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible that made any
[32:21.960 --> 32:26.880]  resistance to it possible was people continuing to support info wars.
[32:26.880 --> 32:32.240]  Despite the massive lawfare being waged against info wars, despite the media defamatory libelist
[32:32.240 --> 32:38.000]  campaign against info wars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that
[32:38.000 --> 32:43.200]  make their own lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air
[32:43.200 --> 32:49.200]  and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian
[32:49.200 --> 32:50.200]  oppression.
[32:50.200 --> 32:55.920]  So continue to do it, go to places like infowarstore.com, go to places like save info wars, continue
[32:55.920 --> 33:01.840]  to keep info wars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[33:01.840 --> 33:18.560]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:18.560 --> 33:21.760]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[33:21.760 --> 33:32.320]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[33:32.320 --> 33:41.040]  It's hard to make sense of the Brittany Griner prisoner swap and part of me says well okay
[33:41.040 --> 33:47.160]  we can always peek behind the curtain and maybe it makes sense or well chalk it up to
[33:47.160 --> 33:50.240]  nothing this administration does make sense.
[33:50.240 --> 33:57.040]  Look it up to the nonsensical ideology that occupies their brains that prioritizes it could
[33:57.040 --> 34:05.840]  have been one of these checkboxes, gay, black, probably woman but basketball player and Griner
[34:05.840 --> 34:12.240]  just happened to check all three boxes so she was a higher priority than the Marine that's
[34:12.240 --> 34:14.120]  still over there.
[34:14.120 --> 34:17.160]  She could have just been gay or she could have just been black or she could have just
[34:17.160 --> 34:21.200]  been a ball player probably would have been the same story but because she checked all
[34:21.200 --> 34:28.680]  three it was a no brainer, Wayland was not even in the discussion and now as you're at
[34:28.680 --> 34:34.200]  war with Russia you just released one of their top arms dealers back into the playing field
[34:34.200 --> 34:41.040]  so I mean it's just it's just cuckoo land but that's what we get from the democrat party.
[34:41.040 --> 34:43.280]  It's all cuckoo land.
[34:43.280 --> 34:47.600]  Now what is this being reported by the Daily Mail?
[34:47.600 --> 34:52.560]  Saudi crown prince broker deal to swap WNBA star Brittany Griner for merchant of death
[34:52.560 --> 34:58.320]  arms dealer Victor Bout who walked past each other on the UAE airport tarmac two days after
[34:58.320 --> 35:04.200]  America dropped Khashoggi lawsuit against the Saudi leader.
[35:04.200 --> 35:14.320]  So is this Saudi Arabia with their increasing good relations with Russia throwing some of
[35:14.320 --> 35:22.080]  their leverage around was this actually discussed when Joe Biden was kissing the boots and licking
[35:22.080 --> 35:30.920]  the floors in Saudi Arabia begging them for more oil they said no only to increase output
[35:30.920 --> 35:37.960]  after the midterms after Joe Biden cut a deal with Venezuela so Joe Biden got double teamed
[35:37.960 --> 35:42.920]  in the foreign diplomatic negotiations the media completely missed that story but what
[35:42.920 --> 35:47.600]  do you expect they're all in the tank for Biden anyway.
[35:47.600 --> 35:56.440]  Now this wouldn't surprise me and it's a hard thing for Americans to understand or conceive
[35:56.440 --> 36:05.240]  or accept but the United States of America is now a laughing stock to the world to all
[36:05.240 --> 36:16.880]  major industrious countries Joe Biden's America is a joke a joke even with the lack of respect
[36:16.880 --> 36:24.640]  many of these countries had for Obama there was at least some dignity there and then Trump
[36:24.640 --> 36:33.400]  we were really starting to climb that totem pole again of respect and of I mean you could
[36:33.400 --> 36:37.520]  say power but really that's just because Trump started exporting energy that's really all
[36:37.520 --> 36:44.520]  it would take and now you have this daughtering old fool none no world leaders believe he actually
[36:44.520 --> 36:49.160]  won the election they all know it was a big thief job he doesn't know where he is he
[36:49.160 --> 36:54.340]  doesn't know who is it who he is his vice president is Kamala Harris she's she's nowhere
[36:54.340 --> 37:04.600]  near where she belongs Kamala Harris is like a single a bullpen catcher on a starting roster
[37:04.600 --> 37:12.480]  for the MLB all-star game everybody watching is going to know that ain't the real deal
[37:12.480 --> 37:21.480]  that player don't belong here I mean that's not even fair to bullpen catchers she's like
[37:21.480 --> 37:29.240]  she's like a high school catching coach on the field in the world series everybody knows
[37:29.240 --> 37:33.120]  she doesn't belong everybody know they're nudging they're winking they're like what is
[37:33.120 --> 37:43.040]  this what is she doing here what is this embarrassment that's Biden Harris so I definitely think
[37:43.040 --> 37:50.640]  Saudi Arabia threw some weight around here to help Russia get this arms dealer back in
[37:50.640 --> 37:59.320]  the war and that was kind of their little tip of the tip of the hat or or nod to Russia
[37:59.320 --> 38:07.640]  saying hey we're in this we're with you what an embarrassment what an embarrassment for
[38:07.640 --> 38:16.960]  the United States on the world stage foreign leaders are running laps around Joe Biden
[38:16.960 --> 38:22.040]  and then this was also in the news Chinese leader and Saudi King signed strategic partnership
[38:22.040 --> 38:30.520]  agreement so here's what's going on because you can flesh all of this out with actual
[38:30.520 --> 38:34.120]  geopolitical developments and I actually took a bunch of notes on this yesterday there's
[38:34.120 --> 38:37.080]  going to be my lead story on the war room of course left my notes at home today but
[38:37.080 --> 38:40.400]  I still remember most of it writing things down as one of the best ways to learn and
[38:40.400 --> 38:53.760]  remember things the brick system that's being set up right now this is the future and the
[38:53.760 --> 38:58.360]  world leaders that are rational and not totally corrupt or just straight up pedophiles or
[38:58.360 --> 39:05.720]  blackmailed or whatever know that the financial system is going to collapse and know that
[39:05.720 --> 39:12.160]  in specific the western system the United States system is going to collapse and we're
[39:12.160 --> 39:17.960]  not taking any of the proper measurements to stop it so the brick system has been set
[39:17.960 --> 39:27.480]  up by other first world leading nations to say look we can have a financial infrastructure
[39:27.480 --> 39:33.640]  we can have a trading infrastructure set up that will allow us to not just survive the
[39:33.640 --> 39:39.840]  U.S. dollar collapsing or the U.S. economy collapsing but then in that moment being ready
[39:39.840 --> 39:47.600]  to just assume full control over world trade and geopolitical relations now here's the
[39:47.600 --> 39:55.520]  damn shame of it Xi Jinping as you see on the left side of the screen there shouldn't
[39:55.520 --> 40:03.720]  be in there instead that should be Donald Trump but here's what's happened because the U.S.
[40:03.720 --> 40:08.240]  has become so pathetic and frankly Trump could have done more but what was he supposed to
[40:08.240 --> 40:12.840]  do he had the media on his back all the time demonizing Russia all the time so he couldn't
[40:12.840 --> 40:20.440]  cut deals with Russia attacking Bolzano all the time under all of his own investigation
[40:20.440 --> 40:29.960]  so he can never properly address this but instead of the U.S. completing that chain
[40:29.960 --> 40:38.400]  now it's China and I just wish our leaders could see the potential and it but you know
[40:38.400 --> 40:44.480]  what sadly it may be dead now sadly the opportunity may have passed and quite frankly I'd say
[40:44.480 --> 40:49.000]  it has we got two more years of this clown in the White House so it's done folks it's
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.560]  done the only option America has now is fully independence if we believe that our country
[40:54.560 --> 40:59.080]  is going to stay in the world marketplace and remain a world power we're idiots it ain't
[40:59.080 --> 41:03.520]  happening we're being left off the table Joe Biden is sitting under the table crawling
[41:03.520 --> 41:09.000]  around begging for bet breadcrumbs and he shut off our energy if he didn't shut off
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.960]  our energy it wouldn't matter we could be energy independent we'd be exporting energy
[41:12.960 --> 41:19.960]  we'd be fine we'd find ways to deal but he has shut off our energy and so we're begging
[41:19.960 --> 41:25.000]  for scraps we're not even invited to the table anymore I wish our leadership could have seen
[41:25.000 --> 41:38.080]  the potential of a brick system but with the United States and Brazil and Russia as the
[41:38.080 --> 41:43.080]  three partnership countries to lead the way and then every single puzzle piece would
[41:43.080 --> 41:47.600]  fall into place from there and it would be the Chinese communists that get cut out and
[41:47.600 --> 41:51.440]  then we could save the millions of people in China that are in prison camps we could
[41:51.440 --> 41:55.320]  save the billions of Chinese people that are being oppressed by their government and we
[41:55.320 --> 42:03.280]  could have a world system based on free market capitalism which has spurred the industrial
[42:03.280 --> 42:08.040]  revolution which has taken these countries into the first world out of the third world
[42:08.040 --> 42:12.120]  pits and like Saudi Arabia they all know it and that's why they're scratching their heads
[42:12.120 --> 42:17.520]  like why is the US doing this why is the US committing suicide but okay well look you
[42:17.520 --> 42:21.280]  got a guy stabbing himself in the neck and then running into walls eventually you just
[42:21.280 --> 42:27.680]  say okay time to move on and then out of the US Brazil and Russia you would have really
[42:27.680 --> 42:32.960]  seen the world powers for freedom align and you would have seen Mexico enter the frame
[42:32.960 --> 42:38.520]  and you would have seen Japan enter the frame and you would have seen India enter the frame
[42:38.520 --> 42:43.400]  and then everything else would have aligned and we could have not had a total financial
[42:43.400 --> 42:49.360]  collapse in the West that would have crushed us and we could have had a world design and
[42:49.360 --> 42:54.800]  free market based on free trade and fair trade practices but instead now China is at the
[42:54.800 --> 43:03.040]  head of the table and Joe Biden is on the ground begging for breadcrumbs because you
[43:03.040 --> 43:12.440]  want it here's another one just for you because without you it would truly be a blue Christmas
[43:12.440 --> 43:21.520]  but thank God that we have you all of us awakening and vibrant souls all over the earth it's

[47:34.160 --> 47:45.760]  of the griner swap as it is but just reemphasize that the u.s. right now is getting lapped

[47:53.760 --> 48:00.160]  that you can't really conceive we don't really understand yet but just look at your inner
[48:00.160 --> 48:05.560]  cities look at the inflation look at the coming recession look at the joke of the leadership

[51:12.520 --> 51:16.800]  up to let we're going to play some of these kareen gene pier eclipse but there was a border
[51:16.800 --> 51:25.720]  patrol agent killed yesterday another one killed after chasing in pursuit another illegal
[51:25.720 --> 51:34.320]  immigrant transfer into the united states another coyote another human trafficker and was involved
[51:34.320 --> 51:41.000]  in an atv accident and lost his life and of course what has the biden administration
[51:41.000 --> 51:51.840]  said about this publicly nothing nothing nothing the only use that border patrol has to this
[51:51.840 --> 51:58.680]  biden administration is to human traffic their products into the country human traffic little
[51:58.680 --> 52:04.280]  boys and little girls into sex slavery which happened in the obama years now is happening
[52:04.280 --> 52:09.120]  even worse in the biden years it was on record in the obama years mainstream news they talked
[52:09.120 --> 52:14.760]  about it now though they just bury it but it'll be the big story eventually it's going
[52:14.760 --> 52:18.760]  to catch up you know you're not going to human traffic little boys and little girls into sex
[52:18.760 --> 52:22.280]  slavery forever and get away with it right you know that and the border patrol knows
[52:22.280 --> 52:26.280]  that that's why they feel so bad about what's going on i feel bad for the border patrol
[52:26.280 --> 52:29.160]  i'm not blaming them i don't know how any of them are still working i wouldn't work for
[52:29.160 --> 52:35.680]  the border patrol anymore you're just a human trafficking government operation now it's not
[52:35.680 --> 52:39.680]  a knock on the agents they know it's true more than anybody i've met them i've talked
[52:39.680 --> 52:48.920]  to them they're afraid to even talk about it border patrol agent killed 38 years old
[52:48.920 --> 52:54.960]  i believe left two kids behind killed in pursuit of a human trafficker and the biden administration
[52:54.960 --> 53:03.880]  says nothing says zero zilch nada biden goes to arizona doesn't even go to the border and
[53:03.880 --> 53:10.640]  he's asked why he says because it's not a problem oh it's not a problem five million
[53:10.640 --> 53:14.400]  illegal immigrants since biden has been in office hundreds of thousands of little boys
[53:14.400 --> 53:21.480]  and girls human trafficked into sex slavery and raped thanks joe thanks democrats i want
[53:21.480 --> 53:27.560]  you to think about that all those democrat voters and joe biden kamala harris just think
[53:27.560 --> 53:31.600]  about all the little boys and girls being tortured right now as sex slaves they have
[53:31.600 --> 53:36.000]  you to thank for it and when the border patrol agent dies you don't say anything because
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.640]  you don't want people to know what's going on at the border that's what it's really
[53:38.640 --> 53:44.320]  about oh there's more important things in the border says joe biden right right because
[53:44.320 --> 53:48.600]  you don't want people to see what's going on down there yeah you don't want people to
[53:48.600 --> 53:53.080]  see the footage of the little boys and girls where they're talking to reporters saying yeah
[53:53.080 --> 53:56.520]  i came here in an unaccompanied minor now i'm a sex slave they don't want you to see
[53:56.520 --> 54:03.720]  that they don't want you to see that i hope all you libs because i know you're tuned in
[54:03.720 --> 54:07.760]  that's what's so incredible about this platform is that all the liberals tune in too i know
[54:07.760 --> 54:12.200]  all you liberals are tuned in i want you to think about that when you lay down to sleep
[54:12.200 --> 54:15.920]  tonight all those innocent little boys and girls that are being tortured and raped because
[54:15.920 --> 54:23.760]  of you that feel good hope that feels nice hope it feels as nice as it does for them
[54:23.760 --> 54:32.720]  you did it you have done it congratulations you have opened up the largest child sex trafficking
[54:32.720 --> 54:38.000]  ring in united states history when you voted for biden and ignored the open border wait
[54:38.000 --> 54:45.280]  to go democrats wait to go liberals what is more important that joe biden can't address
[54:45.280 --> 54:50.960]  the border joe biden renews call for assault weapons ban ah there it is taking your firearms
[54:50.960 --> 54:56.480]  is more important getting rid of the second amendment is more important disarming you
[54:56.480 --> 55:02.760]  and turning you into slaves is more important of course it is the borders running just fine
[55:02.760 --> 55:06.440]  they've got the largest human trafficking operation going on in american history down
[55:06.440 --> 55:13.040]  there at the border that's exactly what they want there's no need to address that that's
[55:13.040 --> 55:19.520]  that's things going swimmingly but you the pesky americans still have a firearm you the
[55:19.520 --> 55:24.360]  pesky americans still have a second amendment right that is a higher priority to get rid
[55:24.360 --> 55:31.480]  of that is a higher priority all right let's let's start getting into some of these crazy
[55:31.480 --> 55:38.040]  clips from korean gene pierre it's a total clown show she's part of the circus korean
[55:38.040 --> 55:43.360]  gene pierre here in clip three they're all denying their involvement in the twitter censorship
[55:43.360 --> 55:46.960]  even though we have the emails and the phone calls and the whistleblowers here's korean
[55:46.960 --> 55:52.080]  gene pierre just lying to the american people completely unashamed in clip three wondering

[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:31.980]  but i mean come on it's so good i almost want to play it a third time kareen gene pierre
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:36.380]  telling you how much of a success biden and harris have been specifically at lowering
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:42.140]  costs and fighting inflation i mean those are like that's like the two things that obviously
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:51.380]  are not going well the two things that are obviously universally subjectively not going
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:57.700]  well and she sits up there with a straight face and i mean honestly this is a spectacle
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:04.500]  this is a spectacle i want to play it again this is this this behavior needs to be studied
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:11.340]  throughout human history how somebody can get up there and just blatantly lie to you
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:16.700]  with a straight face it's an amazing psychological phenomenon it truly is i mean i'm i'm sitting
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:21.940]  here as a as a student of human psychology and i'm just enamored at this and so maybe
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:25.100]  i shouldn't because it's kind of a personal thing but let's just i mean this is this
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:32.260]  is truly a spectacle here's kareen gene pierre telling the american people who are all paying
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:40.460]  more money grocery bill is up electricity bill is up gas bill is up the inflation is 10%
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:44.500]  they just dropped a new number actually it was 10% now it's like it's now it's down to
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:49.620]  like 9.8 or something it was it was like 1% when trump was in now it's you know pushing
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:55.860]  double digits all the time and everybody feels it everybody knows it and then there's kamala
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:02:01.700]  harris who i mean that what does she even do nobody knows what she does and then this
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:09.140]  is truly folks i mean it let's just let's just soak in the incredible psychological phenomenon
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:14.140]  of this is either massive pathological lying or these are just the most corrupt propaganda
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:18.580]  liars in the history of the united states of america either way this is this is historical
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:25.260]  stuff this is truly historical stuff so here's here's gene pierre the press secretary of
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:30.420]  the white house to the american people who are all paying more for gas more for electricity
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:35.700]  more for groceries and she's about to tell you that none of that is happening play it
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:41.740]  let me just say the vice president has been a great partner fantastic past two years you
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:46.820]  know so great successes that they both have had the successes clearly by harris administration
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:51.540]  on getting things done for the american people when it comes to the economy when it comes
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:56.580]  to lowering cost when it comes to fighting inflation and that is something that we're
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:04.140]  going to wow folks that's an all-timer i mean i honestly put that down download that that's
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:10.980]  all-time history right there that that that's a clip that people will be playing for decades
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:16.020]  as an example of the biggest liars in u.s history that that is a clip that we will remember
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:23.580]  and play for decades as as one of the top moments of u.s propaganda korean gene pierre
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:29.580]  says the successes of the biden harris administration and then says lowering cost and lowering inflation
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:35.300]  the exact opposite of the reality the biden harris administration if known for anything
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:42.140]  is going to be known for the high record high inflation and the record high producer price
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:47.460]  index and the record high consumer price index and korean gene pierre sits up there and tells
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:55.740]  you the exact opposite true i mean look aside from the fact i'm an american suffering under
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:06.100]  this faux regime i i as a as a student of psychology that is amazing so i have ever
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:15.540]  seen the movie shutter island great film and i don't want to do a spoiler but when one
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:21.780]  of the patients that's a mental patient facility and when one of the mental patients is walking
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:27.940]  around in the room full of doctors exhibiting his mental disorder behavior the doctors is
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:33.980]  sitting in his leather chair leaning back he's just like outstanding fantastic and you watch
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:37.260]  it the first time you're like what is he talking about why does he keep saying this stuff and
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:42.460]  then but then you realize he's truly enamored by this human psychology he's truly enamored
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:46.740]  by this anomaly of a human that has all these mental problems that's like the same thing
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:53.020]  we're like i'm just sitting here completely astounded like korean gene pierre is such
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:05:05.540]  an unassamed blatant liar it's fantastical because you want it here's another one just
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:13.500]  for you because without you it would truly be a blue christmas but thank god that we

[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:26.220]  so when i found out i was doing double duty today i thought who's a great guest that i
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:30.220]  can get on so that people don't have to listen to me all day and immediately i thought about
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:34.820]  darin beatty not even because there was some big developments in the news that he's been
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:39.620]  covering just because he's always on top of the stories with revolver dot news but then
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:44.860]  there is now there are actually big developments in the january 6 news realm and we'll be getting
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:49.660]  into some of that with darin beatty here today but darin let me let me do this let me do
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:55.820]  a follow up of where we last left off because you've broken so many huge stories at revolver
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:07:01.660]  dot news specifically following the january 6 story and so let me just ask you this since
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:07.660]  we last spoke when you broke the news i mean i mean you would probably say you're 99 percent
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:12.940]  confident in the fact that somebody tampered with the video evidence of the january 6
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:18.540]  pipe bomber now we have this geo fencing story that came out and wired where they're bragging
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:24.660]  how effective their geo fencing is in regards to finding all the january 6 defendants but
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:29.500]  yet they can't find the pipe bomber so i'm just curious since you broke that huge story
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:36.220]  of the video tampering media outlets reaching out people reaching out for comment following
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:44.060]  up politicians media i mean is anybody curious about why the video of the pipe bomber has
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:51.620]  been doctored anybody curious about this you know that's a great question and of course
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:57.980]  a lot of people in sort of independent media conservative media they have taken an interest
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:05.260]  and they have covered it so i did a whole hour long phone call getting into the full range
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:11.300]  of discrepancies pertaining the pipe bomb with norbin laudan which was very good and
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:18.500]  my understanding is glenn beck dedicated a whole show basically based on revolver news
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:26.020]  is coverage and so we've had a lot of pundits and sort of conservative commentators come
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:32.460]  around to covering the story which is good but you know that's really not enough and
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:39.140]  you know just to put a start point on it one of our earlier pieces we proved definitively
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:46.020]  that the fbi was withholding footage that would have shown the pipe bomber actually planting
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:52.580]  the bomb at the dnc now this would be great footage to see because one of the really bizarre
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:58.740]  features of the january six official story in the with the pipe bomber is that this dnc
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:05.540]  bomb was allegedly planted at the dnc headquarters the evening before so january fifth around
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:12.740]  eight p.m. and then we're supposed to believe that it was just sitting there for seventeen
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:19.700]  hours out there right in its open conspicuous position laying right out there for all to
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:26.220]  see by the foot of a bench yeah i mean i wouldn't suggest anybody i wouldn't suggest anybody
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:30.340]  do this but my guess is if you tried to repeat that scenario if somebody went and left a
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:36.020]  strange package outside the dnc there's no way it sits out there for almost a full day
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:42.860]  well well um oh and it's it's not even a hypothetical we had you know one of our many pieces on
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:49.340]  this we did a walkthrough to sort of reconstruct the path and it's really funny like our our
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:55.540]  guy who i guess will remain nameless but we had somebody do the walkthrough and literally
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:59.940]  the second he was there the security came up to him and say what are you doing here
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:06.460]  bubbleblast started harassing him it was technically you know that's public as a public area um
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:14.460]  we also found um through the use of google satellite imagery that the dnc had a physical
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:20.420]  security guard regularly stationed merely eight feet away from where the pipe bomb was
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:27.980]  planted and so it just compounds discrepancy upon bizarre and almost unbelievable coincidence
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:34.340]  until there's there's so many piled on top of one another that it becomes simply unbelievable
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:41.980]  that this dnc pipe bomb was sitting there for 17 hours the dnc security guard that we
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:47.100]  know was stationed eight feet away he didn't see it all day it was a high traffic high
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:52.500]  foot traffic day on the morning of january 6 no pedestrians saw it no employees of the
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:59.220]  dnc sitting at that bench having morning coffee saw it and then the big whopper is it was
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:04.300]  covered up for over a year but now we know that kamala harris was in the dnc building
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:10.100]  while the pipe bomb was sitting there the secret services on record saying they swept
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:16.300]  all exits and entrances the pipe bomb was planted again less than 10 feet away from the parking
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:20.860]  garage entrance and exits which the secret service claimed that they swept and the secret
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:25.580]  service managed to miss it so we're all of these people missing it and then on top of
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:30.460]  that we said well was it actually planted there when they said it was and that's the
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:38.620]  one piece of money fought money shot footage that the FBI just happened to censor from
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:43.700]  the footage that it released to the public with no explanation and so just getting back
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:48.500]  to what you're saying are like are people picking up on the story I think it's very
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:56.300]  weird frankly and even a little bit damning that the democrats themselves aren't joining
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:12:02.700]  the chorus aren't joining revolver to say wait a minute this is a from their point of
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:09.420]  view maga pipe bomber terrorist who planted an explosive device outside of their national
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:15.060]  headquarters you would think that they would be more interested in uncovering who this
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:21.100]  person actually I mean you scowl at a democrat you scowl at a democrat they call you a terrorist
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:24.420]  this guy actually puts a bomb outside their headquarters and they don't even buzz about
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:31.300]  it they don't care they're not joining me and asking the FBI to release the footage
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:38.460]  and here's the thing is that you know the feds erection thesis is a I mean I think it's
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:45.020]  100% correct I think anyone who has doubts to just read our stories on it but it's difficult
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:50.580]  politically unless you are a hero unless you're a firebrand unless you're one of the warriors
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:57.700]  like you know Matt Gaetz or Marjorie Taylor Greene or Paul Gosar or Thomas Massey not
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:05.980]  everyone can get away with that amount of truth but the nice thing about this is you
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:13.580]  don't have to publicly subscribe to revolver news feds erection thesis in order to demand
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:21.700]  the full and unedited raw footage of the DNC you can simply say this person was a terrorist
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:27.020]  I'll even pay lip service to the idea was a maggot terrorist but we condemn terrorism
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:33.180]  we're a law and order party and we call on the democrats to join us in getting the full
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:39.260]  unedited raw footage of this terrorist pipe bomber because the entire nation has an interest
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:44.340]  in uncovering who this person is you don't have to say it was a feds erection anything
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:50.700]  you just have to say this is the most terrorist-like aspect of the day that the democrats are comparing
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:57.260]  to 9-11 why don't we get to the bottom of it and at the very least have the chain of
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:02.180]  custody of the footage and the full and unedited footage so that we can get to the business
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:10.100]  of finding out who this guy or woman or sort of ambiguous in between might be and I kind
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:15.700]  of look at this the same way I look at the QAnon thing where they love to use the pipe
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:20.260]  bomber they love to use QAnon when they can kind of fit it into their narrative and use
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:24.420]  it to build a narrative or move the narrative along but when it comes to genuine interest
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:28.380]  it's just not there it's just not there they don't really seem to care who QAnon is they
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:32.700]  claim he led this big revolution they don't claim to care they're not investigating they're
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:36.660]  not asking the questions they're not digging into that same thing with the pipe bomber
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.700]  they're not digging into it they're not asking the main questions they're clout obviously
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:43.020]  they're not trying to find them they didn't even do the geo fencing so to me I just sit
[01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:48.020]  here and I say hmm okay you don't want to go after QAnon probably one of your own you
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:53.380]  don't want to go after the pipe bomber probably one of your own that's my opinion not Darren's
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:57.060]  but what are you making out of all of this from covering all that how do you even make
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:04.140]  sense of the lack of interest in the DC pipe bomber well I mean again it looks very weird
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:09.500]  and I'll tell you a story about the geo fencing because you know I'm not an idiot like the
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:15.220]  idea occurred to me why don't I you know try to replicate the you know 2000 mule strategy
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:22.940]  and do some geo fencing on my own because there are a handful of sort of data service
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:31.020]  companies from which in theory you can purchase that information you don't have to be a government
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:35.740]  actor you know governments are the primary clients of these services but it's not you
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:40.380]  know law that they can only do business the government in fact many cases they do do business
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:46.500]  in the private sector and so I knew that as a known quantity they're probably not going
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:51.300]  to want to deal with Darren Beatty is all right we gotta take a break this is so key
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:54.740]  though when we come back because folks they're bragging about how effective the geo fencing
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:16:01.300]  is to get j6 defendants but why didn't get the pipe bomber December 2022 is here and
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:06.820]  we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at info war store

[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:25.500]  ago but only 28 years and I knew they were planning all of this and I warned the public

[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:24.060]  frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones Dr. Darren Beatty is
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:30.780]  with us from revolver.news truly one of the great groundbreaking websites of the modern
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:35.860]  day truly emerging as one of the greats as is Darren Beatty and Darren was just getting
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:42.020]  into how they were running some real world human intelligence down in DC in regards to
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:48.900]  this geofencing story so people understand they brag in Wired magazine and all these
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:55.100]  leftist publications about their geofencing abilities to track and trace and get data and
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:59.180]  all these January 6th defendants and they brag how they can pick one out of a crowd
[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:04.220]  of millions on a day where there was no service and magically they can use this technology
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:10.460]  find all these J6 defendants but when it's the pipe bomber a crowd of one in a crowd
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:16.140]  of one alone in a night out in front of the DNC on camera they can't seem to find that
[01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:21.500]  so Darren was getting into that before we took the break Darren let's pick it up absolutely
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:28.820]  so as I was saying I tried to avail myself of the geofencing technology and it is available
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:35.020]  to the private citizens it's more controlled but there are a handful of companies that
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:42.820]  have this data and they can sell it if they want to and knowing that I was kind of a public
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:51.140]  quantity and I might not have success approaching them as myself I had a friend a proxy who's
[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:57.940]  done business with them before go and say hey you know not much information on the political
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:05.540]  implications of the data but just we'd like to you know explore the possibility of getting
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:12.220]  you know your geofencing data for you know this general area this general time and the
[01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:19.620]  initial response in two cases was oh this this sounds great you know shouldn't be a
[01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:27.100]  problem happy to do business then the next day in one case the same day we get a follow
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:35.340]  up message saying basically sorry this isn't something we can work on no further explanation
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:41.580]  so yeah I don't know again what to make of that but like assuming that they did discover
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:45.420]  the you know the political significance of this you'd think that it that one of these
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:53.900]  sort of data collection firms would be thrilled to participate in a project that would uncover
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:23:00.540]  who this high bomber terrorist was when they be lauded as a hero when they get great publicity
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:07.580]  for playing a decisive role in figuring out who this person is wouldn't the FBI give them
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:14.180]  a medal you know and for some reason they didn't think that would be the case and maybe whatever
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:19.300]  reason that is it's the same reason that the Democrats aren't joining me and saying hey
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:26.340]  FBI why don't you release the footage of the alleged maga pipe bomber actually planting
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:31.580]  the bomb outside of the DNC headquarters maybe that's the same reason the Democrats don't
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:37.700]  seem to be interested in finding out who this is and why basically the public face here's
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:44.540]  another thing on the public face of the pipe bomb investigation at the FBI someone called
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:52.140]  Stephen DeAntono his previous job was running the Detroit field office in the FBI where
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:24:01.860]  he oversaw the Michigan fed napping plot disaster it's literally that guy who after the suspected
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:08.260]  Whitmer kidnappers were arrested the day after Christopher Ray propelled him to this coveted
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:14.740]  post at the DC field office when he went on to oversee things in the months leading up
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:21.180]  to and on January 6 then became the public face of the pipe bomb investigation this position
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:27.380]  he had at the Washington field office that according to FBI sources is in a highly coveted
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:33.500]  position it's something that McCabe had for instance that is almost always a stepping
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:39.500]  stone for climbers into the coveted seventh floor at the Hoover building and the fact
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:46.380]  that he quietly and suspiciously retires from this key post in the same way that he was
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:54.180]  quietly and suspiciously propelled to it from his job in Michigan where he oversaw the infiltration
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:25:01.860]  operation of the Whitmer thing it's really bizarre and again there are too many coincidences
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:09.860]  here too much dammy information too many glaring discrepancies with zero explanation and we
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:18.300]  know for a fact the footage released by the FBI to the public was both censored by withholding
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:23.700]  the critical footage of the pipe bomber planting the bomb and tampered with they reduced the
[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:29.300]  frame rate to a rate of 1.2 frames per second which is unheard of and just to put a capstone
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:36.340]  on it one reason they may be interested in lowering the frame rate artificially is that
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:41.020]  with a higher frame rate you'll be able to see very clearly that the pipe bomber was
[01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:47.300]  using his or her phone and texting continuously which would have established a narrative that
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:51.940]  there was a third party involved and then the question who was this third party and also
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:59.500]  would make it very clear that okay was using a phone why don't you use geofencing well
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:05.540]  it sounds to me the conclusion that I reached based off of what you just said it's not that
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:11.660]  there's a lack of interest in finding the pipe bomber they know something that we don't know
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:16.420]  about the pipe bomber I mean that's clearly what this says to me especially I mean it
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:19.540]  sounds to me I don't want to put your words in your mouth but just listening to the story
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:24.740]  it sounds to me like somebody behind the scenes got wind of you looking for this geofencing
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:32.220]  data and somebody in a real powerful position shut that down that's possible or the geofencing
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:37.500]  people looked into it a little bit further and they just you know people in these industries
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:42.980]  they develop certain sensitivities as to where they're allowed to go and where they're not
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:48.060]  allowed to go and maybe it was just that they sensed you know they didn't want to get involved
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:53.100]  maybe they had the right intuitions about what was really going on I don't know all I know
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:58.860]  is that multiple cases and they're only a handful of these firms that I approach through
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:03.940]  through a proxy who is not a political quantity whatsoever someone that they should have been
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:10.180]  extremely comfortable doing business with they got an initial very warm response yes
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:15.300]  shouldn't be a problem and then shortly after in one case on the same day there was a complete
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:21.260]  about face saying you know what sorry we can't touch this basically with no further explanation
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:27.460]  and again in light of all the other data points all the other glaring discrepancies all the
[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:33.300]  other burning and really dark questions surrounding the pipe bomb issue in particular it really
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:38.420]  doesn't paint a rosy picture as far as what Merrick Garland was up to what Christopher
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:46.260]  Ray is up to and what the disgraced and now recently resigned Steve Indiantuono was up
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:53.380]  to after having run the fed napping entrapment operation and mission well and and maybe the
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:59.900]  people that you reached out to for this geofint fencing data maybe they're aware of when you
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:04.460]  cross the Democrat Party a lot of times you end up in a casket just ask Elon Musk that's
[01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:09.420]  why he's telling people he's not suicidal right now because he's aware of that trend
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:13.500]  Darren I'd like to get one more segment with you we're about to hit this break any final
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:20.140]  words before we hit this break if you can't stick around no just you know go to revolver.news
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:25.980]  and the exclusive section and if you're interested read our read our pieces on the pipe bomb
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:31.460]  we have some really entertaining and fun and also informative videos illustrating the
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:40.700]  key thesis behind this and share it you know the public pressure is really our only leverage
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:46.060]  in this case you know the politicians will only follow up on things in so far as they
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:52.380]  think there remains public interest and from Merrick Garland's position from Christopher
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:57.460]  Ray's position the one thing that they're counting on is for us to just forget about
[01:28:57.460 --> 01:29:03.380]  it and move on to the next thing Christmas 2022 is almost here and we have great products

[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:09.580]  marathon battle with a globalist I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics
[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:15.820]  not just in America but the world we are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:21.260]  information war but I don't deserve the credit yes I've persevered but the listeners and

[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:21.900]  on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:37.380]  we appreciate his time revolver dot news is the website folks and it's truly one of the
[01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:41.380]  go-to websites if you want to stay informed on the information the mainstream media passes
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:46.500]  on Darren we had a subjective discussion we got a little bit off track on earlier and
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:53.860]  I'd like you to just kind of re re-emphasize everything from your investigation as far
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:34:02.060]  as FBI tampering with evidence from the edited footage of the pipe bomber and other such
[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:10.180]  things where where is that issue at in this process to you well whereas that is basically
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:16.420]  you know we we did the editing piece with consultation of with a number of kind of video
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:23.620]  forensics professionals and the basic insight there was that the frame rate on the piece
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:31.700]  of footage that the FBI released of the pipe bomber at the pipe bomb site DNC was 1.2 frames
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:39.100]  per second which is extremely slow and it turns out on further research that the lowest
[01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:48.820]  of commercially available surveillance standard is 8 frames per second and even 8 is pretty
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:57.380]  rare like even your average like a gas station and McDonald's will typically have 10 to 15
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:35:03.820]  and so I found it very bizarre that not only in it first of all like the DNC has VIPs working
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:09.140]  there VIPs coming and going it's located in one of the most you know violent and dangerous
[01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:17.380]  cities in the country namely Washington DC the break in and it to the DNC was what precipitated
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:22.580]  one of the largest political scandals in American history namely Watergate so you think with
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:28.340]  all of those things and the budget they must have they wouldn't be playing around with
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:33.540]  the lowest commercially available frame rate but it's actually worse than that because
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:39.820]  the frame rate they had was 1.2 where the lowest commercially available was eight so
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:44.660]  if for them to have that they might they wouldn't just you know buy the cheapest available they
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:50.780]  had to go to find the one antique store that still carried you know surveillance camera
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:56.780]  with that Jurassic era yeah I would wonder if you can even find it I wonder if you send
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:36:00.620]  out a crew one of your crew members or riders if they could even find one that does one
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:04.580]  frame per second I bet they could even find it no it can't no there was a I mean this
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:10.300]  is a whole industry that's a security industry a surveillance industry they do on tests and
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:17.580]  you know we looked at the recent sort of survey of operational surveillance cameras and it
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:24.980]  found that zero percent of operational surveillance cameras have between zero and five frames per
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:30.940]  second zero percent so it's simply unheard of there there must be some additional explanation
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:37.460]  as to why the footage from the DNC has a frame rate that is so low that you never see it
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:44.900]  anywhere and that cameras you know the cheapest available commercial cameras have far superior
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:50.780]  frame rates to that and so it indicates that there was tampering involved and the tampering
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:56.940]  makes sense because again when you cut the frame rate it makes it a lot more difficult
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:37:03.740]  in this case impossible to see the perpetrators face so they for whatever reason didn't want
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:11.020]  us to see the perp's face cutting the frame rate makes it impossible to conduct an informal
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:16.180]  gate analysis how does the suspect walk you need a good frame rate in order to find that
[01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:23.580]  out that's also curtailed with this tampering that you know someone did presumably the FBI
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:29.300]  or maybe some other point in the chain of custody which is why we want the chain of custody
[01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:34.660]  and thirdly as I mentioned cutting down the frame rate will make it more difficult to
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:40.300]  gauge just how actively and continuously the pipe bomber was texting with the third party
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:45.700]  while engaged in planting the pipe bomb which again we don't even know if he planted it
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:50.500]  because the part of the footage that would have shown that was simply censored and that's
[01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:56.300]  an entirely different aspect from the frame rate issue so all of these reasons really
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:38:02.900]  point to a tremendous amount of suspicion toward the FBI and really you know if we're
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:08.820]  wrong about this the issue can be settled easily we just want the full chain of custody
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:14.100]  of that surveillance footage along with the raw and unedited footage it's as simple as
[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:19.780]  that the issue can be settled as simply as that we just want the chain of custody and
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:28.580]  the footage well actually the DNC has an answer for you as to why they have security cameras
[01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:33.980]  from the stone age and they they've just actually equipped a carrier pigeon with a message and
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:38.540]  so the carrier pigeon will be delivering that to you in no time I'm sure with the stone
[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:43.420]  age camera I'm curious because this I actually just learned this recently and I'm as far
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:46.980]  as I can tell this is new information but I think it had been out there a while but
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:53.140]  I'm not sure if I'd heard you talk about this yet did you hear that they they claim I believe
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:56.900]  at the FBI they claim that they detonated the pipe bomb did you see that they claim
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:39:03.420]  they actually detonated and blew it up yeah there are conflicting reports about what exactly
[01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:10.540]  went on here there's a the full kind of forensics report pertaining to the pipe bomb is something
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:17.660]  that um parts of it were leaked to the CBS a long time ago and beyond that there's been
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:24.860]  no word and so there there were reports of some kind of detonation but it's unclear whether
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:31.860]  that was actually detonating using the alleged live explosive material that what they claim
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:36.780]  was there on the bomb or whether it was just they were blowing it up and they weren't using
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:43.020]  the live explosive material so there's sort of their ambiguities that remain but frankly
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:49.100]  that's another thing that should be released to the public is the full kind of the full
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:56.500]  forensics report that for whatever reason the government chose to leak portions to CBS
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:40:00.820]  and we haven't heard anything from it since but that's where we got a lot of our information
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:07.740]  including the report that there was live explosive material on it which if true makes the official
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:14.540]  story even less believable because the Secret Service was conducting a sweep their logs
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:19.380]  should have detected that immediately there's nothing easier for Secret Service dogs to
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:24.340]  sit down next to live explosive you know powder that's like the number one thing that they're
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:30.380]  trained to do and so I guess the Secret Service dogs may have had COVID that day and so there
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:37.660]  sense of smell was affected but I would love to get the full forensics report so we can
[01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:44.220]  better get to the bottom of all of the competing claims pertaining to the pipe bomb and its
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:49.140]  status when discovered I mean my reasoning would be just because I know how they operate
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:54.420]  my reasoning would be if they did let's say detonate it as its own explosive device and
[01:40:54.420 --> 01:41:00.740]  they detonated it that way then it obviously either had very little explosive impact or
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:06.060]  none or didn't detonate at all which wouldn't work for the narrative so maybe they did try
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:11.220]  that and it failed and that's why they're not being clear about it because again it
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:14.980]  just doesn't work I mean they'd want to build this up as bad as possible if they detonated
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:18.740]  it and it turned out it was a massive bomb then they'd want to use that for their narrative
[01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:23.500]  so the fact that they aren't tells me that again this is just more proof that they're
[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:28.380]  lying about pretty much everything sadly and a lot of people have suffered because of the
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:33.620]  events of that day and still to this moment we don't get any answers that we can trust
[01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:39.020]  sadly I think from our government as far as what really happened that day and the investigation
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:43.780]  sense whether it's the geo fencing the pipe bomb the security cameras all of it very sad
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:49.460]  but hey at least we're going to have high definition footage of death warmed over Nancy
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:55.940]  Pelosi and all of her activities that day Darren so at least we have that as a consolation
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:59.460]  indeed and really that's all we need you know you can't always get what you want but you
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:05.700]  get what you need so we can take solace in that I mean I love looking at beef jerky after
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:09.380]  it's been in the microwave for 30 minutes and so that's going to be the HD footage of Nancy
[01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:14.260]  Pelosi amazing how she knew to have HD footage there that day Darren Beatty thank you so much
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:18.060]  revolver.news folks I'm telling you it's a great go to site you want to find the news
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:21.560]  that the mainstream media doesn't want to touch you're going to find it at revolver.news
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:28.060]  Dr. Darren Beatty thank you so much thank you all right there he goes oh man I got to

[01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:49.660]  wind a gust of wind in the sailboat thank God for great people like Darren Beatty and
[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:54.460]  so many others that are trying to get the truth out there because that's that's what
[01:42:54.460 --> 01:43:02.220]  this country needs needs the truth it's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live
[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:09.220]  on air broadcasting free worldwide and it seems quite real that things can change in
[01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:16.300]  an instant things are getting very weird and it's definitely more difficult than ever to
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:21.260]  even know what's going on but we'll keep doing our best so long as you keep us on the
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:30.140]  air and you could do that now at infowarstore.com help us clear out our stock of bodies to work

[01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:04.820]  watching this needs to support alex jones needs to support info wars and band dot video
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:08.780]  you know the bible says let another mouth praise you i'm gonna do that right now alex
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:14.940]  jones has helped so many people in this industry you guys have no idea how many people have
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:19.820]  got their first start like savannah hernandez how many people have just been put on a launch
[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:25.500]  pad the outer space because of alex jones including myself i've been given so many opportunities
[01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:30.420]  because of this man and because of this platform and i would probably not even be half of where
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:34.940]  i am right now if it weren't for alex jones i mean i've been able to be on podcast with
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:40.700]  alex and joe rogan and tim castor super tim cast irl listen what i'm saying is do not
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:45.460]  take alex jones and band dot video for granted because you don't know what you have until
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:51.020]  it's gone we need to support free speech systems right now so go check out the store go support
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:59.060]  their store go support info wars leave a donation right now don't wait until they're gone so
[01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:03.500]  when i first started taking survival shield basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight
[01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:08.420]  i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard
[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:12.540]  dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:16.660]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with
[01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:19.860]  that stew you had you know with a deep bird and torus you know and i got really excited
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:25.260]  about that so i took it and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:30.500]  my brain was enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:35.100]  and over the course of the next couple of years i got my health back and i religiously
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:39.300]  take basically all of your supplements they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:43.540]  the one i like recently is knockout it literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:47.540]  amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean we have to
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:52.260]  break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:58.580]  and to our own hair beautifully said brother i thank you so much for calling godspeed
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:03.940]  the tip of the spear throughout this entire process the only thing that made any republican
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:08.900]  victories tonight possible the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:14.540]  possible the only thing that made any uh opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:20.140]  the school shutdowns and and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible that made
[01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:26.020]  any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite the massive
[01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:31.940]  law fair being waged against info wars despite the media defamatory libelist campaign against
[01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:37.140]  info wars the ordinary people the everyday people that buy products that make their own
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:42.620]  lives healthier wealthier and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air and what that does

[01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:50.580]  political prisoners so that's the situation there retired green beret jeremy browns attorney
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:57.620]  fbi planted evidence in his trial oh more of that nor narrative carrying over from the
[01:50:57.620 --> 01:51:04.180]  last segment call to action dc mayor muriel bowser refuses to allow j six political prisoner
[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:10.900]  visitation even computer visitation after nearly two years in dc gulag folks it's brutal
[01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:24.620]  for them political prisoners being held and tortured for the democrat party just break
[01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:31.980]  your heart i hope this is the darkest day for america i hope this is the darkest time
[01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:38.740]  in america in our history and there's no doubt that it is in many ways it's just a matter
[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:44.900]  of how much worse does it have to get how many political prisoners have to rot in jails
[01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:51.820]  how much longer do we have to deal with this scourge this cancer that is the democrat party
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:58.580]  this scourge this cancer that is left wing ideology which is really just authoritarianism
[01:51:58.580 --> 01:52:07.540]  and totalitarianism wearing the mask of communism or socialism it's not socialism communism
[01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:16.820]  they're both the same and socialism and communism by nature are authoritarian and totalitarian
[01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:23.380]  and see i get i actually have people with kind of a communist mind or a socialist mind
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:27.100]  that reach out to me and they say hey i agree with most of your stuff but why do you bash
[01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:35.060]  socialism so much it doesn't have to be so bad so to me it's like this we spent twenty
[01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:41.740]  one trillion dollars for george bush's wars in the middle east that barack obama said
[01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:46.700]  he would end and then expanded twenty one trillion dollars and then the disastrous pull
[01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:50.860]  out in afghanistan but but let's just focus on this twenty one trillion dollars on these
[01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:57.900]  wars didn't help us at all did nothing for our country just millions dead twenty one
[01:52:57.900 --> 01:53:08.180]  trillion so i would understand the argument if i was gonna say hey okay socialism could
[01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:15.660]  work here yeah twenty one trillion dollars spent on war i would rather invest in our
[01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:24.780]  health care system absolutely absolutely now i'd rather not tax the american people
[01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:30.220]  to the price of twenty one trillion dollars to fund any of it but yeah no i get the argument
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:36.780]  i get the conclusion if you're gonna spend twenty one trillion dollars on war why not
[01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:41.820]  spend it on education why not spend it on health care completely agree i don't want
[01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:46.060]  to spend twenty one trillion on war but yeah if you're gonna spend twenty one trillion
[01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:53.060]  yeah let's spend it on america let's let's help americans i get that but none of it should
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:54:01.940]  be going on but see that's not even the point it's that it always leads to what political
[01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:07.860]  prisoners and authoritarian and totalitarian because how do you get everybody to do the
[01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:17.980]  same thing you can't you shouldn't want to but that's ultimately the bottom of the barrel
[01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:22.940]  of communism and socialism which this current administration is and that's why they lie
[01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:29.380]  to you all the time and they've got all kinds of shortages the the economy is i think after
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:35.020]  christmas folks i think i think once we get into next year you're really gonna start seeing
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:41.020]  how bad it is and and i'm guessing that austin is not alone in that they're debating what
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:44.900]  they're gonna do locally with the electricity prices because they're running at a deficit
[01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:48.940]  of like twenty thirty million dollars with the deals they cut with the with the power
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:53.980]  companies here to switch to green energy and it just didn't work i mean it's just not there
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:57.820]  how am i gonna get solar energy there's no sun today how am i gonna get wind energy there's
[01:54:57.820 --> 01:55:04.660]  no wind today no we need coal we need we need gas and so the switch didn't work and they
[01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:08.820]  can't keep the prices down and so they're literally i mean they're they're talking about it here
[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:12.500]  they're saying we might just have to double electricity prices and that's just their only
[01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:16.060]  option they don't know what else to do so my guess is that's not isolated here but here's
[01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:23.380]  korean gene pierre discussing the medicine shortages so this is a new one the medical
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:27.660]  shortages thanks to the by demonstration this is right after she told you how great everything
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:31.860]  was going and then she tells you about medic medical shortages but it's not a big deal
[01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:38.740]  she says in clip four the president has been engaged in has he been briefed on medicine
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:45.860]  shortages so let me just say this and share share where we are so as i've said as you
[01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:50.740]  mentioned on monday i was asked by your colleague i believe ben the administration is closely
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:57.700]  monitoring for the possibility of any national shortages medicine shortages are are not uncommon
[01:55:57.700 --> 01:56:03.100]  oh it's not uncommon closely monitored by the FDA so remember we had the baby formula
[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:09.820]  shortage you had food shortages you have a diesel shortage right oh it's just that's
[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:13.540]  just common yeah you're right it is common in a communist country you're right it is
[01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:17.460]  common in a socialist country you're right it is common in a third world country i guess
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:23.140]  she's being honest now i guess this is gene pierre being honest now you're right medical
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:28.900]  shortages power shortages this is all normal in a socialist third world country thank you
[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:31.780]  korean gene pierre for telling us because she just said i just want to address the state
[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:35.700]  of things so she's addressing the state of things you're in a third world socialist country
[01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:41.460]  under biden harris and so she's just saying this is normal this is common don't you know
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:46.700]  finish the clip experts on this right this is their focus health officials are enclosed
[01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:55.540]  she's just reading off of a script a manufacturer to make more of any drug so so so pause again
[01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:59.660]  quickly because whatever let me just like let me explain to you what has just happened
[01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:05.900]  in this video the biden administration the democrat party has operatives in the press
[01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:12.180]  pool in the white house press room and they stage questions so when they see that there's
[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:17.620]  an issue about to arise or they see that there's an anti-biden narrative about to form they
[01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:22.780]  try to get ahead of it so the issue of medical shortages hasn't really been a big issue yet
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:28.580]  so this is them planting a question in the press pool to get out ahead of it and you
[01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:33.740]  can see it so they plant the question she calls on the planted journalist and then she just
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:38.420]  reads put her on the screen as we go to break she just reads off a script that's all planted
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:43.620]  folks that's all fake again this is what communists do this is called propaganda they plant a
[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:49.060]  journalist to ask a question and then she reads off a script
[01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:54.380]  Christmas 2022 is almost here and we have great products at info or store.com that empower

[01:59:50.900 --> 02:00:02.660]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:12.020]  All right we got one more from Jean Pierre and then a and then a doozy from Biden's economic
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:19.700]  advisor Brian Deese but remember and Trump has said this that we need to repeal the vaccine
[02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:24.180]  mandate for the military and do back pay for all of those who were terminated for refusing
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:32.060]  to get it and then the Republicans in Congress said I don't remember what their threat was
[02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:38.380]  but they they they basically said if you don't oh it was cut funding they said if you don't
[02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:42.180]  relieve the military of the vaccine mandate and now they want the mask mandate returned
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:45.780]  at basis to so they said if you don't relieve the military of the mask mandates and the
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:50.620]  vaccine mandates we're gonna cut funding to the military I guess the Democrats didn't
[02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:57.740]  blink at that because here's Jean Pierre today saying that mandate is not going anywhere.
[02:00:57.740 --> 02:01:04.260]  And we believe that it is a mistake what we saw what we saw happen on the NDA as it relates
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:06.620]  to the vaccine mandate.
[02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:13.100]  Again reading off a script I mean you just you just like we might as well have Kim Jong
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:18.020]  Un as president with his sister running the propaganda administration I mean this is just
[02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:27.620]  absurd it's just absurd so okay no no vaccine mandate relinquished from the military and
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:31.300]  they're gonna put that mask back on your face too because they love you so much.
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:38.100]  Now this is honestly like this is this is to the point where it's just like I should
[02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:45.180]  just quit like we should all just quit and I don't want to be redundant from something
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:51.820]  I covered yesterday on the war room but it's it's it's so key to understanding everything
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:57.140]  as a follow-up to what top Biden economic advisor Brian Deese is about to say.
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:02:02.100]  So listen of course we know about their climate change agenda we know about the net neutral
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:05.980]  carbon neutral and manmade climate okay right we know about the green new deal all this
[02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:13.700]  bull crap so so but let's let's really bring it home and tell you what it means not by
[02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:17.980]  our admission but by a Democrats admission that's what's so incredible about this is
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:21.620]  now the Democrats are telling you what it really means but first let's set it up here's
[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:26.020]  Biden's economic advisor Brian Deese on the climate change issue.
[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:28.700]  One of the things Larry did say last week at the doable conference was that he said he
[02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:36.740]  expects fossil fuels to be part of our life for at least the next 70 years do you agree
[02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:40.780]  with that and do you believe about a consistent message from him given that you've spent
[02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:43.300]  a long time with him over the years.
[02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:49.300]  Look I'll tell you what our view is which is we need to rapidly hit our climate goals
[02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:55.460]  including a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030 as you do that you still see a reliance
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:03:00.140]  and you still see a maintenance for example of oil and the energy mix that's something
[02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:05.300]  that will be true for the next several years but the real opportunity here and I hear this
[02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:09.060]  from companies across the board the real opportunity here is to now move as quickly
[02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:15.740]  as possible to develop and to expand and to scale these new zero carbon technology.
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:19.740]  So here's what I'm going to have to do I think is I'm going to have to pull this clip from
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:23.900]  yesterday of Frank Figluzzi on MSNBC.
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:28.860]  Now actually according to Democrats we're all already dead because we didn't do enough
[02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:32.980]  about climate change 20 years ago we're all already dead according to Al Gore's documentary
[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:38.380]  we're all drowning in the sea levels rising it's all BS folks look most of the knowledge
[02:03:38.380 --> 02:03:43.660]  is esoteric but there's enough information we know the ice ages come in cycles it's all
[02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:49.820]  about the rotation of the sun around the around so it's just I'm not even going to get into
[02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:55.340]  that the point is it's all BS they know it's all BS and now it's all been proven BS because
[02:03:55.340 --> 02:04:00.140]  everything they've been saying for decades has not a single one of it come true so they're
[02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:08.140]  still lying to you about this but okay what's the solution they say well what is the solution
[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:14.300]  is you have to cut energy you have to stop man activities you have to stop men you want
[02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:18.740]  to stop man made climate change you're gonna have to stop man so okay you don't fly on
[02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:24.820]  an airplane you don't drive a vehicle you don't you don't get to go out on a boat ride
[02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:30.580]  you don't get to travel you don't get to eat steak or meat or anything like that and so
[02:04:30.580 --> 02:04:34.220]  that's what it is and they'd say we're shutting down fossil fuels we're shutting down oil
[02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:39.740]  we're shutting down coal now it's obvious what that would do to civilization they don't
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:46.420]  tell you that except they do tell you that and Frank Figluzzi a Democrat FBI agent told
[02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:53.020]  you what's gonna happen on MSNBC but see he accidentally admitted their big plan without
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:59.700]  telling you I'm gonna show you on the other side of this this break.
[02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:05.780]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping

[02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:15.580]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance and now your host Owen
[02:06:15.580 --> 02:06:28.780]  Troyer so I played this clip yesterday now again the Democrats have been telling you
[02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:33.340]  for decades that man's activities on this planet are going to kill the planet they've
[02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:38.380]  been lying about that they know it and now it's just been proven with documentaries
[02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:45.300]  like Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth not a single thing he predicted in that 2002 documentary
[02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:52.060]  has come true they put signs at the national glacier park that says all these glaciers will
[02:06:52.060 --> 02:06:56.500]  be melted by 2020 2020 has come and went they had to remove the sign the glaciers are bigger
[02:06:56.500 --> 02:07:00.980]  than ever so I'm not going to sit here the Vostok ice core samples the expansion of the
[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:06.500]  south pole ice caps I'm not going to sit here and just go over all the evidence that
[02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:11.500]  everything they tell you about man made climate change is a lie it's all a lie whether they
[02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:15.060]  actually believe it or they just want to use the lie to control you is irrelevant it's
[02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:19.300]  all a lie well I shouldn't say it's irrelevant it is relevant but for this discussion it
[02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:25.660]  doesn't matter point is it's a lie so what would this actually look like though they
[02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:29.860]  don't tell you that they just sit there and virtue signal as the good guys saying we're
[02:07:29.860 --> 02:07:32.820]  going to stop man made climate change we're going to save the earth we're saving you
[02:07:32.820 --> 02:07:37.340]  we're the good guys well they're actually the bad guys that want to control you but what
[02:07:37.340 --> 02:07:42.460]  would it look like if you shut down human activity if you shut down energy what like
[02:07:42.460 --> 02:07:47.300]  they're doing it's the end of civilization as you know it and if you don't realize how
[02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:53.860]  the final conclusion to this agenda is you dying just you dying forget about you living
[02:07:53.860 --> 02:08:02.420]  in the pod not owning anything eating bugs that's the final stage before you get murdered
[02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:07.140]  oh come get your new covid bike come get your new covid vaccine and then that's the one
[02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:16.300]  that done and we have now successfully ended man made climate change but okay we all know
[02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:21.140]  that's what would happen if they shut the energy off but they don't tell you that until
[02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:29.980]  they do frank figluzzi democrat fbi agent who goes on msnbc is a guest one of the most
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:36.620]  wept out psychotics that's ever been on tv and worked in the federal government and he
[02:08:36.620 --> 02:08:42.780]  accidentally tells you the big plan and so let me give you the context and it ties into
[02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:50.140]  some other news today that i'll get to a power plant in north carolina got sabotage somebody
[02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:54.180]  went there or multiple people went there they don't have any suspects they don't know anything
[02:08:54.180 --> 02:09:00.660]  right now they're still investigating it and they shot into a power plant and apparently
[02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:04.740]  they must have had some knowledge because the law enforcement says the place that they
[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:08.500]  shot in their investigation they found out that this person had to know to shoot right
[02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:14.100]  there to sabotage the whole thing it couldn't have been a lucky guess so frank figluzzi
[02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:21.100]  covering this blames it on trump supporters and says that it was trump supporters trying
[02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:28.700]  to sabotage a drag queen sexy time for kids event and so he says trump supporters sabotage
[02:09:28.700 --> 02:09:35.420]  this power plant as part of their anti-lgbtq activism with no evidence he says that but
[02:09:35.420 --> 02:09:42.860]  here's the beauty of it when frank figluzzi believes democrat fbi agent who goes on msnbc
[02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:48.580]  when frank figluzzi believes that it's trump supporters that sabotage the power grid listen
[02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:56.700]  to the conclusions that he reaches on live television unwittingly showing you the entire
[02:09:56.700 --> 02:10:02.740]  globalist corporate government stop man made climate change plan accidentally because he
[02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:10.020]  thinks in this moment he can blame it on trump supporters listen to this all time classic
[02:10:10.020 --> 02:10:15.380]  well we all want to know who and why and that's where the fbi comes in not only generally
[02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:19.820]  when they respond to crimes and support was it right there because he lied right out of
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:24.020]  the gates he doesn't want to know who or why he's already decided who and why he's already
[02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:27.860]  decided it's trump supporters that wanted to sabotage a drag queen sexy time event for
[02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:32.780]  kids he doesn't want to know who or why he's already determined that there's an investigation
[02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:38.860]  ongoing and he's already reached his conclusion go on develop a profile they're gonna help
[02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:43.980]  with forensic physical evidence all of that yes but we know the fbi of course is the lead
[02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:48.380]  agency for an act of domestic terrorism and they're gonna be pursuing motive here and
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:53.100]  yes it's quick and convenient to say look we we know about this planned drag show in
[02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:58.060]  town it happens I think every year and yes the coordinators of that show said they have
[02:10:58.060 --> 02:11:04.500]  been receiving unprecedented levels of threats or disagreement over this so they'll be exploring
[02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:09.180]  all of that the communications around that event but let's not necessarily do the quick
[02:11:09.180 --> 02:11:13.740]  and convenient thing because there's something much larger going on here Nicole we saw something
[02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:18.500]  similar to this out in california in 2013 it's never been solved it was at a pacific
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:25.020]  gas and electric facility with sniper fire was used to take out transformers at a substation
[02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:29.660]  and it woke everybody up in law enforcement to help vulnerable the threat was to our infrastructure
[02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:34.820]  our power grid and lots of security took place after that cameras and patrols and all kinds
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:38.700]  of things that are in place now particularly at a big player like duke energy in north
[02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:44.100]  carolina where this happens so here's the right here now this is where it gets amazing
[02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:49.540]  folks okay so you've seen the build up you've seen the narrative now I want you to think
[02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:55.340]  about the framing I've given you with the entire stop man made climate change agenda
[02:11:55.340 --> 02:12:02.620]  green agenda net or carbon neutral agenda get carbon emissions down to zero agenda what
[02:12:02.620 --> 02:12:07.440]  are they doing they're shutting off the power shutting down coal shutting down gas shutting
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:10.780]  off the energy right that's what they're doing to stop man made climate change and that's
[02:12:10.780 --> 02:12:15.380]  a good thing so their agenda is to shut off the energy to stop man made climate change
[02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:20.220]  that's a good thing but listen to the conclusion that fig loosey reaches when he thinks that
[02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:25.460]  that's what trump supporters are doing it's incredible watch this thing going on here
[02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:31.300]  is the knowledge it takes to know what you're shooting at what equipment the relay system
[02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:34.900]  the backup that's going to happen to the next substation when the first one you shoot at
[02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:42.420]  goes down and then we know in law enforcement that there's increased chatter and even specific
[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:47.420]  instructions as recently as last year and something called the acceleration is handbook
[02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:53.580]  that shows you how to do this the theory behind this the idea the bigger idea here is that
[02:12:53.580 --> 02:13:00.300]  you can quickly destabilize society and get the chaos if you pull the plug literally they
[02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:05.700]  see electricity nicole as the great equalizer in society that makes everybody kind of equal
[02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:10.340]  they don't like that so they want survivalists and white nationalists this is the far right
[02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:15.340]  side of accelerationist theory because there's a far left side too but the far right side
[02:13:15.340 --> 02:13:20.060]  which has been chatting about this ad nauseam for the last couple of years no damn it thinks
[02:13:20.060 --> 02:13:25.460]  that you pull the plug and you get to the chaos to destabilize society and the guys
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:30.460]  with the weapons the guys who trained on weekends for survivalists you know to become survivalists
[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:37.300]  they they get the power at that point okay now I would like to just cut out that last
[02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:44.060]  part where he says pull the plug to destabilize so okay so this is frank fig loosey's democrat
[02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:52.900]  fbi agents logic on msnbc is that when you shut off the energy or as his words pull the
[02:13:52.900 --> 02:14:00.220]  plug you destabilize and cause chaos in a scenario to empower yourself he says that
[02:14:00.220 --> 02:14:07.540]  energy is the great equalizer and that they don't like this so again let's just look at
[02:14:07.540 --> 02:14:15.540]  this here from fink frank fig loosey's logic democrat fbi agent on msnbc people that want
[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:21.940]  to shut off your energy want to destabilize civilization they want to cause chaos and
[02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:26.180]  they want to pull the plug because energy is the great equalizer and they want to dominate
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:35.940]  and conquer you and take control does that sound familiar to anybody you do realize that
[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:45.220]  that is exactly what the democrat party agenda and policy is to pull the plug and to shut
[02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:52.580]  off energy oh but I guess when they do it it's not to destabilize I guess when they do
[02:14:52.580 --> 02:14:57.860]  it it's not going to cause chaos I guess when they're the ones deciding who gets energy
[02:14:57.860 --> 02:15:04.700]  and who doesn't it's not the great equalizer but when frank fig loosey makes up a fantastical
[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:11.900]  tale in his own mind about something that happened in North Carolina with no evidence
[02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:18.860]  he reaches the conclusion that people that want to destabilize civilization and take
[02:15:18.860 --> 02:15:24.860]  away the great equalizer of cheap and easily accessible energy that they're terrorist and
[02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:29.900]  that's a bad thing when he thinks it's trump supporters doing it something he made up in
[02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:39.180]  his own mind but ladies and gentlemen as you know that is the exact agenda of carbon neutrality
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:46.300]  net zero carbon emissions and the green new policies so to frank fig loosey he just admitted
[02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:53.140]  the entire green new carbon neutral policy is to destabilize cause chaos and take away
[02:15:53.140 --> 02:16:02.940]  the great equalizer to conquer you until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world
[02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:09.220]  believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called
[02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:15.860]  vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold
[02:16:15.860 --> 02:16:21.580]  weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin
[02:16:21.580 --> 02:16:29.540]  D3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3 but if you're not
[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:34.700]  getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and
[02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:38.660]  other things to start replicating and taking your body over so now it's more important

[02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:47.340]  primary care and then we have an entire array of holistic products and online store media
[02:19:47.340 --> 02:19:55.700]  and health advice come see the wellness company and go to online health now dot com as a conduit
[02:19:55.700 --> 02:20:03.660]  to the wellness company leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:25.500]  it's alex jones so you see it's it's the stuff like what we just played in the last segment
[02:20:25.500 --> 02:20:32.260]  where i'm just like if people can't see this why you're just there's no it's done we're
[02:20:32.260 --> 02:20:41.540]  done it's over it's futile frank figluzzi says sabotaging energy turning off energy the great
[02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:49.180]  equalizer will cause destabilization chaos and that's a bad thing except when when liberals
[02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:55.580]  and democrats do it it's a good policy i mean it's just like right then and there i should
[02:20:55.580 --> 02:21:03.260]  not hear a damp a damn word further from a leftist liberal democrat about your new energy
[02:21:03.260 --> 02:21:09.220]  your green energy agenda frank figluzzi your own guy just explained what it's really about
[02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:14.380]  but see he thought he could blame that on trump supporters so in that instance it's a good
[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:20.300]  thing to say hey when you turn off the power grid you're going to destabilize and that's
[02:21:20.300 --> 02:21:24.620]  a bad thing but when they do it it's good policy don't believe me here how about some
[02:21:24.620 --> 02:21:30.500]  further proof here here's john carry who flies around the planet and then when he gets asked
[02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:34.380]  about his carbon footprint he says well well i get to fly around the planet just not you
[02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:40.900]  well thank you john here he is talking about how they have to accelerate their green new
[02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:49.420]  energy agenda in clip one and and so everything has to accelerate and and by you know vast
[02:21:49.420 --> 02:21:53.580]  amounts we have to be deploying renewables six times faster than we are today we have
[02:21:53.580 --> 02:21:57.780]  to be deploying electric vehicles about 20 times faster than we are today if you're going
[02:21:57.780 --> 02:22:03.220]  to keep your temperature at 1.5 degrees of increase right just it's just it's on it's
[02:22:03.220 --> 02:22:13.660]  unreal the amount of lies i just oh yeah because mining for lithium and cobalt and everything
[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:18.260]  else it takes to make the car the electric car battery is so much better you've just
[02:22:18.260 --> 02:22:22.420]  completely destroyed the rainforest in the philippines mining for lithium but forget
[02:22:22.420 --> 02:22:26.780]  that the child slaves over there doing that what about the cobalt what about everything
[02:22:26.780 --> 02:22:32.100]  else oh that doesn't matter and john carry flies around the world on private jets telling
[02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:37.700]  you that you can't fly around the world on private jets but again this is i mean i it's
[02:22:37.700 --> 02:22:43.820]  so elementary here i don't even how many different ways do i tell you one plus one equals two
[02:22:43.820 --> 02:22:50.820]  how many different examples how many different methods can i show you that one plus one equals
[02:22:50.820 --> 02:22:54.820]  two because that's what this is this is one plus one equals two i'm just trying to figure
[02:22:54.820 --> 02:23:00.860]  out how to explain it so again it's official democrat corporate world government world
[02:23:00.860 --> 02:23:08.140]  economic forum policy to end carbon emissions get to carbon emission zero and have all this
[02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:12.700]  green new energy stuff and so what does that look like they're shutting off coal they're
[02:23:12.700 --> 02:23:17.740]  shutting off gas and what does that look like your electricity bill is going up now you
[02:23:17.740 --> 02:23:21.820]  can't even afford it look at what's going on in europe right now where they're telling
[02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:26.260]  people you can't charge your electric car we don't have the energy you can't play video
[02:23:26.260 --> 02:23:33.780]  games online we don't have the energy so so their official agenda the official democrat
[02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:40.140]  liberal world order agenda is to shut off your energy and in that case they say it's
[02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:47.500]  to save the planet but when frank fig losey makes up a fantastical tale of what he believes
[02:23:47.500 --> 02:23:52.580]  are a group of trump supporters shutting down a power plant in north carolina to destabilize
[02:23:52.580 --> 02:23:58.300]  and cause chaos that's terrorism even though that's exactly what their official policy
[02:23:58.300 --> 02:24:06.900]  is so even though it didn't happen yes if somebody goes to blow up a power plant to
[02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:13.180]  shut down the power grid for an ulterior motive that's political in nature that is terrorism
[02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:19.380]  absolutely 100% frank fig losey would be right except that he made the story up but no frank
[02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:27.340]  fig losey is right if you sabotage a power plant for an ulterior political motive you're
[02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:32.860]  a terrorist except when the democrats do it when the world economic forum does it and
[02:24:32.860 --> 02:24:38.660]  when liberals promote it they're saving the planet but see frank fig losey was just being
[02:24:38.660 --> 02:24:43.460]  honest when he was thinking he was going to be able to blame this on conservatives and
[02:24:43.460 --> 02:24:47.020]  right wingers and trump supporters he was being honest he was saying yeah when you sabotage
[02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:52.140]  the power grid you destroy civilization you cause chaos you destabilize energies the great
[02:24:52.140 --> 02:24:57.420]  equalizer yeah so why are the democrats trying to take energy from us why did joe biden shut
[02:24:57.420 --> 02:25:01.900]  our energy down and so that's what I'm saying I feel like I'm being redundant but it's all
[02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:09.260]  right there this is one plus one equals two it's two it's two it's two it's two it's two
[02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:15.860]  it's two this is one plus one equals two here's the liberals telling you it's terrorism to
[02:25:15.860 --> 02:25:22.900]  sabotage a power plant for an ulterior political motive and then here's the democrats sabotaging
[02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:31.740]  your power plants for an ulterior political motive so by frank fig losey's own conclusion
[02:25:31.740 --> 02:25:37.100]  democrats and liberals are terrorists not my logic I just played you the clip of frank
[02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:43.380]  fig losey I just played you the clip of john carrey you've been living their new green
[02:25:43.380 --> 02:25:49.180]  energy agenda one plus one equals two one plus one equals two one plus one equals two
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:54.940]  I should be able to quit I should be able to retire I should never have to fight this
[02:25:54.940 --> 02:26:01.060]  man made climate change stop man made climate change green new agenda bull crap ever again
[02:26:01.060 --> 02:26:06.700]  frank fig losey just killed it in the womb it should be done their own guy their own
[02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:13.300]  idiot their own moron their own corrupt son of a bitch goes on TV and tells you when you
[02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:19.300]  sabotage the energy that's an act of terror to destabilize and conquer by the way we're
[02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:25.100]  sabotaging your energy to destabilize and conquer we're good liberal democrats yay so
[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:30.060]  I should be done that should be it we shouldn't have to fight this fight anymore we shouldn't
[02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:34.820]  have to battle it but it didn't matter because it didn't stop with the Vostok ice core samples
[02:26:34.820 --> 02:26:39.660]  completely proving the whole thing wrong it didn't stop with the ice caps expanding when
[02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:46.700]  they told you they'd all be completely melted I mean folks you understand again I don't
[02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:51.300]  want to get too esoteric here but it's important like you understand you've been completely
[02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:58.020]  lied to about human history you have been completely lied to about human history and
[02:26:58.020 --> 02:27:02.940]  it all does tie together actually because they can't have you knowing the truth about
[02:27:02.940 --> 02:27:08.540]  human history because it once again disproves their theory of man made climate change they
[02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:15.260]  want you to think that the arc of human evolution is is a straight line like this just going
[02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:20.620]  up like this this is what main line history and science wants you to believe that it's
[02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:28.540]  just from from the bottom up a straight line up that is a lie they know it's a lie mankind
[02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:34.060]  has survived three four maybe even five ice ages we don't have the exact science and dating
[02:27:34.060 --> 02:27:39.540]  but it looks like it's on a cyclical a cyclical period of about every 3000 years all based
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:46.860]  off the sun's activity and they know this and they know that in prior times on planet
[02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:54.100]  earth where we didn't have an industrial age there was more carbon in the atmosphere this
[02:27:54.100 --> 02:28:00.980]  is all documented it's all out there and they just keep lying to you about it so why would
[02:28:00.980 --> 02:28:06.780]  you ever trust a liar well you wouldn't would you and I guess that's the ultimate hill that
[02:28:06.780 --> 02:28:12.380]  we still have to climb is to convince people everybody telling you well maybe not everybody
[02:28:12.380 --> 02:28:17.500]  some of them are just genuine morons but the leaders of this green new agenda the leaders
[02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:24.260]  of this stop man made climate change movement are liars and they're and they're and they're
[02:28:24.260 --> 02:28:35.340]  going off years and decades and centuries and millennia of lies they will not win you

[02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:23.540]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years and I knew they were planning all
[02:30:23.540 --> 02:30:27.740]  of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere but I couldn't have done it without

[02:31:02.660 --> 02:31:08.540]  believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called
[02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:15.060]  vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the
[02:31:15.060 --> 02:31:20.380]  cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack
[02:31:20.380 --> 02:31:28.900]  of vitamin D3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3 but if
[02:31:28.900 --> 02:31:33.300]  you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy
[02:31:33.300 --> 02:31:37.980]  for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over so now it's more

[02:31:59.740 --> 02:32:07.100]  the election be stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots and it's
[02:32:07.100 --> 02:32:14.260]  absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just it's election month
[02:32:14.260 --> 02:32:20.780]  Alex it's not election day and that's the problem and everything changed after COVID-19
[02:32:20.780 --> 02:32:27.700]  they illegally changed state elections mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes
[02:32:27.700 --> 02:32:32.260]  mailing multiple ballots to people well this isn't any way to run an election we're in
[02:32:32.260 --> 02:32:37.380]  a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this and I believe that
[02:32:37.380 --> 02:32:42.420]  just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying that
[02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:48.780]  and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity
[02:32:48.780 --> 02:32:54.940]  and question the the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election
[02:32:54.940 --> 02:33:02.780]  deniers we're election realists leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[02:33:02.780 --> 02:33:12.900]  order it's Alex Jones

[02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:40.180]  right Arizona media PR company find impossible variant in election day data 25% of GOP voters
[02:35:40.180 --> 02:35:45.700]  flipped their votes on top GOP candidates folks it's this story I think is actually
[02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:57.420]  just beginning because they just got their hands on more data that shows I mean basically
[02:35:57.420 --> 02:36:03.500]  to kind of just get to the bottom line here about I forget I crunched the numbers yesterday
[02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:07.740]  on the show do you guys remember I think was about 120,000 more Republicans voted in the
[02:36:07.740 --> 02:36:12.380]  Arizona election in Maricopa County you guys remember that number I landed on I don't remember
[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:18.580]  I did the math on the on the screen with the latest data but basically Republicans outvoted
[02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:24.860]  Democrats in Maricopa County by more than a hundred thousand and yet somehow the Democrats
[02:36:24.860 --> 02:36:37.100]  had a better turnout in the results and now we're learning with new data that it's not
[02:36:37.100 --> 02:36:44.580]  just the anomaly of more Republican voters it's that the anomaly of how come some Republicans
[02:36:44.580 --> 02:36:49.380]  voted for this Republican candidate but not for this Democrat at such a high rate and
[02:36:49.380 --> 02:36:56.940]  that happened in Georgia too so it just leads to more questions and it just leads to more
[02:36:56.940 --> 02:37:04.180]  distrust in our election system at which at this point how could you not Maricopa County
[02:37:04.180 --> 02:37:08.860]  recorder Stephen Richard attacks the Gateway Pundit in meeting with federal agencies CISA
[02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:13.820]  and Twitter chief censor Vajaya Gede attacks the Gateway Pundit completely factual and
[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:19.620]  sourced report on secret County meeting yeah they're mad because the Gateway Pundit publishes
[02:37:19.620 --> 02:37:25.180]  this stuff and they've got they've got eyes and ears usually right there and then they
[02:37:25.180 --> 02:37:29.940]  go on to talk shows like here at Info Wars with Jim Hoff on the war room with me yesterday
[02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:33.980]  and they expose it all and so then they get attacked for it.
[02:37:33.980 --> 02:37:38.620]  Kareen Jean Pierre refuses to say if the Biden campaign communicated with Twitter to suppress
[02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:43.900]  Hunter Biden laptop story now why does she refuse to say because the answer is yes they
[02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:49.940]  did and we have the emails and the phone calls and the whistleblowers so we have all the evidence
[02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:54.500]  that yes the Biden campaign did communicate and she won't answer the question because
[02:37:54.500 --> 02:37:58.940]  she knows if she's asked directly yes or no did they she has to say yes but I don't know
[02:37:58.940 --> 02:38:02.460]  why lying is such a problem there she does it all day for a living so I don't know why
[02:38:02.460 --> 02:38:07.300]  she doesn't just doesn't say no maybe that lies too big maybe even Jen or maybe Jean
[02:38:07.300 --> 02:38:14.260]  Pierre even has limits to how much she'll lie CDC and Census Bureau had direct access
[02:38:14.260 --> 02:38:20.180]  to Twitter portal where they could flag speech for censorship that's a direct violation of
[02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:25.660]  the First Amendment there need to be massive criminal investigations and charges I mean
[02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:31.220]  you want to talk about seditious conspiracy forget J6 you want to talk about treason do
[02:38:31.220 --> 02:38:34.980]  we need to start throwing the T word around here how serious do we need to get it needs
[02:38:34.980 --> 02:38:40.900]  to start somewhere according to Elon Musk some data was likely hidden and deleted from
[02:38:40.900 --> 02:38:46.460]  the Twitter files now this is this is odd and it's not maybe it's not as odd as we
[02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:52.900]  think because Twitter is a much bigger business a much bigger company than info wars but I
[02:38:52.900 --> 02:38:57.900]  can understand I mean I just just a company of info wars here I mean I could sabotage
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:39:01.620]  things I mean somebody could sabotage this whole thing right now somebody somebody in
[02:39:01.620 --> 02:39:05.420]  the crew could just shut it down somebody can go pull the plug in the back somebody
[02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:11.780]  can go delete all the archives so I can understand maybe if Elon Musk not getting control complete
[02:39:11.780 --> 02:39:17.580]  control of the company I could understand maybe that's a possibility Twitter's huge company
[02:39:17.580 --> 02:39:23.460]  and you could have bad actors but how it's Jim Baker how it's James Baker known federal
[02:39:23.460 --> 02:39:30.100]  lawyer known Democrat lawyer that's in there doing this that's stunning how that was able
[02:39:30.100 --> 02:39:33.140]  to get through the filter I can understand maybe you know you got a bunch of employees
[02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:37.420]  maybe some low-level employees maybe somebody tried to sabotage you but Jim Baker like top
[02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:47.380]  Democrat lawyers in their FBI guy that's crazy and so who are they saying might have
[02:39:47.380 --> 02:39:56.180]  hidden or deleted some of the Twitter files he's got to be referring to Baker who he fired
[02:39:56.180 --> 02:40:04.740]  recently just a swamp member who was put as the head communications Twitter's deputy
[02:40:04.740 --> 02:40:12.820]  general counsel who was basically steering the entire back channel between the Democrats
[02:40:12.820 --> 02:40:18.140]  and Twitter on what was going to be censored and then they would basically just flesh it
[02:40:18.140 --> 02:40:23.020]  all out and then have somebody send the command out through an email and then now we have
[02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:28.100]  those files but they've been sabotaged who knows if they'll ever be recovered it was
[02:40:28.100 --> 02:40:35.300]  too little too late from Elon Musk getting rid of James Baker but good for Jack Dorsey
[02:40:35.300 --> 02:40:40.020]  saying hey Elon stop playing these games release the whole thing I think Elon's got his own
[02:40:40.020 --> 02:40:45.820]  little game of cat and mouse going on hopefully it's for the good of the people and not just
[02:40:45.820 --> 02:40:53.820]  himself but that saga isn't going anywhere Senator Marsha Blackburn open app markets
[02:40:53.820 --> 02:41:00.620]  act would remove Apple and Google as the gatekeepers on smartphones hey this is wow Marsha Blackburn
[02:41:00.620 --> 02:41:07.740]  is starting to have some forward thinking here thank God somebody gets it and of course
[02:41:07.740 --> 02:41:15.860]  it was info wars that reported this first myself even over a month ago I said Google
[02:41:15.860 --> 02:41:20.460]  play and Apple are threatening Elon Musk that they're going to remove his app from the platform
[02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:25.020]  if he doesn't keep Alex Jones censored and then a couple weeks later after I reported
[02:41:25.020 --> 02:41:29.700]  that he came out and said that that's exactly what happened and so what do you do what do
[02:41:29.700 --> 02:41:39.780]  you do when you have this duo duopoly system while maintaining a free market capitalist
[02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:47.940]  you know country it's okay well maybe this is a solution open app markets act now at
[02:41:47.940 --> 02:41:51.660]  the end of the day I don't I don't really know how this goes because I don't think there's
[02:41:51.660 --> 02:41:55.900]  going to be enough support behind Marsha Blackburn maybe there will I don't think enough Republicans
[02:41:55.900 --> 02:42:02.860]  are forward thinking enough or have the courage enough to do something good like this but
[02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:08.740]  but ultimately I think Elon Musk realizes he's going to have to make his own smartphone
[02:42:08.740 --> 02:42:14.980]  and he's going to have to make his own operating system and my guess is once he's gotten comfortable
[02:42:14.980 --> 02:42:21.300]  with wherever he's at at Twitter and by the way this whole they they launched an investigation
[02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:27.300]  in San Francisco because he has bedrooms at Twitter headquarters and then they found out
[02:42:27.300 --> 02:42:33.300]  that he was the one sleeping there it was Elon Musk who's been living at Twitter since
[02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:37.580]  he made the purchase so when he's not flying around the country he's living at Twitter
[02:42:37.580 --> 02:42:43.020]  working on Twitter and then they oh we're investigating he's making people sleep here
[02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:47.740]  well he was the one sleeping there but oh well then why didn't he just send him out to the
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:51.460]  streets and then they could sleep on the streets like everyone else in San Francisco does that
[02:42:51.460 --> 02:43:02.260]  they tell you it's so great they can get a free needle too because you want it here's

[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:39.060]  after surgery studies have shown as for vitamin c and zinc themselves you probably already

[02:46:50.900 --> 02:47:06.940]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:27.060]  Paul Joseph Watson is coming up to host the fourth hour, and then I will be back
[02:47:27.060 --> 02:47:32.900]  to host the war room, and right out of the gates, we're gonna have the lawyer on
[02:47:32.900 --> 02:47:37.020]  the parents that were featured on the Alex Jones show yesterday just lost their
[02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:40.820]  child, so they had it with them on the air yesterday. They were holding it, loving
[02:47:40.820 --> 02:47:45.460]  embrace, and then the totalitarians, the good commies, the good liberals, came and
[02:47:45.460 --> 02:47:50.780]  took the baby away. New Zealand takes custody of baby over parents, transfusion
[02:47:50.780 --> 02:47:54.740]  objection. New Zealand parents who lost custody of baby for demanding unvaxxed
[02:47:54.740 --> 02:48:00.860]  blood donors join info wars to expose medical tyranny, and I've got their whole
[02:48:00.860 --> 02:48:07.420]  statement here. I'm gonna read for you the entire statement, and then again the
[02:48:07.420 --> 02:48:15.980]  lawyer of this family will be joining me at 306 central time to discuss further.
[02:48:15.980 --> 02:48:20.900]  Here's the official statement that we have been given exclusively. Four police
[02:48:20.900 --> 02:48:25.180]  officers entered the room where baby Will and his twin brother slept soundly.
[02:48:25.180 --> 02:48:30.100]  Without notice, they seized him. In the words of Will's father, quote, baby Will
[02:48:30.100 --> 02:48:34.660]  has tonight been ripped from his bed and his mom in a display of ultimate
[02:48:34.660 --> 02:48:40.180]  cowardice by masked police dressed as police, masked people dressed as police
[02:48:40.180 --> 02:48:45.380]  at 11 o'clock at night to be made to undergo invasive procedures before being
[02:48:45.380 --> 02:48:51.420]  forced against our will to have a rushed and unprepared for surgery. End quote.
[02:48:51.420 --> 02:48:55.340]  This happened despite last-minute efforts by the family's legal team and
[02:48:55.340 --> 02:48:59.060]  experts from across the world who were studying his case and making the
[02:48:59.060 --> 02:49:04.300]  recommendations that were then passed to the judge on the case. Now his life is
[02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:08.660]  in the hands of the hospital staff. Let's hope for Will's sake they see sense and
[02:49:08.660 --> 02:49:14.060]  provide him with an uncontaminated blood supply. I've talked to Sam since she was
[02:49:14.060 --> 02:49:19.580]  allowed to join baby Will after he was taken at midnight. I've also texted
[02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:24.340]  evidence. She is exhausted and very scared. They have imposed a condition that
[02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:28.540]  she can only stay with her baby if she stays awake, even though it's from
[02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:33.700]  midnight to 8 a.m. and both babies are sleeping. The police are trailing her
[02:49:33.700 --> 02:49:38.980]  even to the toilet. They told her this was due to orders from above. The police
[02:49:38.980 --> 02:49:43.260]  woman let slip. They intend to arrest Sam in the morning. Sam doesn't know why. We
[02:49:43.260 --> 02:49:47.580]  need an urgent support communications and support plan. We must protect Will and
[02:49:47.580 --> 02:49:52.900]  Jethro. Protect legal privilege so far as possible. I'm guessing they will try to
[02:49:52.900 --> 02:49:56.540]  close me down too. I plan to get to the hospital at 7 a.m. to support Sam. So
[02:49:56.540 --> 02:50:00.860]  different time zone obviously over there in New Zealand. So I think this is going
[02:50:00.860 --> 02:50:04.700]  to be all going on right around by the time the lawyer comes on with me. So
[02:50:04.700 --> 02:50:09.100]  following that heartbreaking story. This is the corporate world government. This
[02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:16.740]  is medical tyranny, medical fascism that has been really cemented into our
[02:50:16.740 --> 02:50:21.260]  civilization post COVID. This is what communism looks like. This is what
[02:50:21.260 --> 02:50:28.340]  totalitarianism looks like. Your child is not yours. Just like Democrat
[02:50:28.340 --> 02:50:32.500]  Melissa Harris Perry said, your child is not yours. It belongs to the larger
[02:50:32.500 --> 02:50:39.220]  community. In other words, it belongs to them. So they can't convince you that you
[02:50:39.220 --> 02:50:43.180]  belong to them, but that's why they're going after your children. That's why
[02:50:43.180 --> 02:50:46.820]  they're confusing them with the gender stuff. That's why they're mutilating them
[02:50:46.820 --> 02:50:53.540]  with the surgeries. That's why they're poisoning them with the vaccines. It's
[02:50:53.540 --> 02:50:58.780]  all about turning them into slaves. It's too late for you. Your limits of
[02:50:58.780 --> 02:51:03.860]  slavery have been tested. You've only been able to deal and put up with so
[02:51:03.860 --> 02:51:09.580]  much, but the children, they're really going hard for them. And so we should
[02:51:09.580 --> 02:51:16.140]  pray for baby will. I mean, oh, I mean, you don't even want to think about the
[02:51:16.140 --> 02:51:20.260]  worst case scenario that the baby gets contaminated blood, then as a heart attack,
[02:51:20.260 --> 02:51:26.180]  a blood clot dies. Obviously that's the concern. But that shouldn't even be the
[02:51:26.180 --> 02:51:30.540]  concern. The concern has already been breached. The concern is that you as a
[02:51:30.540 --> 02:51:37.300]  parent no longer have control over medical decisions that are made for your
[02:51:37.300 --> 02:51:44.620]  baby. That's the problem here. Not, oh, well, let's hope that baby will gets good
[02:51:44.620 --> 02:51:50.500]  blood that won't kill him. That's totally against the parent's wishes. They don't
[02:51:50.500 --> 02:51:54.580]  want him to get contaminated blood, but the doctors may force him to do it.
[02:51:54.580 --> 02:52:01.100]  That's the situation right now. No, it's do parents have the right to make medical
[02:52:01.100 --> 02:52:07.940]  decisions for their children instead of the government or the state? That's
[02:52:07.940 --> 02:52:14.260]  already been breached. And now here you are. This is liberalism. This is this is
[02:52:14.260 --> 02:52:18.300]  the left wing ideology. They're coming out of their shell. They're showing you
[02:52:18.300 --> 02:52:25.580]  who they are. Will you take them in? Will you accept them?
[02:52:29.180 --> 02:52:35.660]  Now this is crazy. You want to see the other angle of these freaks? They don't
[02:52:35.660 --> 02:52:39.540]  just want the medical control over your child. They want sexual control over them
[02:52:39.540 --> 02:52:45.620]  too. Project Veritas video elite Chicago private schools Dean of students brags
[02:52:45.620 --> 02:52:50.580]  about teaching queer sex to minors and giving them butt plugs. Folks, it's so
[02:52:50.580 --> 02:52:55.820]  disgusting, but it is the truth. We have the video, and so these people are bragging
[02:52:55.820 --> 02:52:58.980]  about how they groom and sexualized children in the classroom and
[02:52:58.980 --> 02:53:03.940]  undercover video. Project Veritas caught up with these scumbags in the streets,
[02:53:03.940 --> 02:53:13.980]  and it went like this in clip 14. Like our LGBTQ plus health center. They were
[02:53:13.980 --> 02:53:19.460]  passing around butt plugs and dildos to my students talking about queer sex, using
[02:53:19.460 --> 02:53:24.980]  blue versus using spit. Meet Joe Bruno, Dean of students at the prestigious
[02:53:24.980 --> 02:53:30.300]  Francis W. Parker private school in Chicago, which happens to charge $40,000
[02:53:30.300 --> 02:53:34.500]  per student. They're just like passing around dildos, butt plugs. The kids are
[02:53:34.500 --> 02:53:38.380]  just playing with them. They're like, how do you how does this work? How do I do
[02:53:38.380 --> 02:53:43.900]  like how does this work? That's a really like part of my job. Parents might be
[02:53:43.900 --> 02:53:48.500]  stunned to learn that Bruno's version of love and acceptance means handing out
[02:53:48.500 --> 02:53:55.460]  sex toys to underage students. So I've been the Dean for four years. During pride, we
[02:53:55.460 --> 02:54:03.820]  do a pride week every year, and I had like our LGBTQ plus health center come in.
[02:54:03.820 --> 02:54:08.500]  They were passing around butt plugs and dildos to my students talking about
[02:54:08.500 --> 02:54:15.900]  queer sex, using blue versus using spit. Who was this? This is the LGBTQ plus health
[02:54:15.900 --> 02:54:19.180]  center came in to talk to my high school students. They're just like passing around
[02:54:19.180 --> 02:54:23.660]  dildos, butt plugs. The kids are just playing with them, looking at them. In the
[02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:29.100]  school? In a classroom. While I'm sitting there. And we had a drag queen come in,
[02:54:29.100 --> 02:54:35.380]  pass out cookies and brownies and do photos. It's so amazing. And everybody's
[02:54:35.380 --> 02:54:40.460]  cool with that, like the butt plugs and the dildos. No big complaints. I mean, if
[02:54:40.460 --> 02:54:45.180]  the parents found out what they know. It's queer sex. This is the drag queen
[02:54:45.180 --> 02:54:50.220]  that came in. What's her name? Alexis Devils. Alexis Devils. And just hung out in
[02:54:50.220 --> 02:54:55.860]  my classroom. And was there hung out in my office. You have so much freedom. So
[02:54:55.860 --> 02:55:06.300]  much wiggle room. So much freedom. So much money. I mean, I don't know.
[02:55:06.300 --> 02:55:11.100]  They would, it's like we, I wouldn't even like run it by them. Like why would I run
[02:55:11.100 --> 02:55:14.940]  it by them? They would be like, oh my god, that's wonderful. Yeah, all with the kids
[02:55:14.940 --> 02:55:18.620]  that with the classroom 14, 18, they're like, how do you, how does this all
[02:55:18.620 --> 02:55:25.980]  work? How do we do like, how does this work? Right? So yeah, that's a really, like,
[02:55:25.980 --> 02:55:31.300]  little part of my job is, I don't have to worry about stuff like that.
[02:55:31.300 --> 02:55:38.780]  Oh, man, I just, how much do we have to put up with? You know, I don't have a kid
[02:55:38.780 --> 02:55:43.980]  in school. So this is a societal issue for me. That's a pretty easy one to take
[02:55:43.980 --> 02:55:52.340]  a stance on. But if you had a kid in that school and you heard this, I mean, what
[02:55:52.340 --> 02:55:55.700]  are the odds this guy seems to be pretty obsessed with butt plugs? What are the odds
[02:55:55.700 --> 02:56:00.700]  he's wearing one in that interview? What are the odds he's got one in while the
[02:56:00.700 --> 02:56:03.820]  kids are in class and he's wriggling around in the chair looking at the
[02:56:03.820 --> 02:56:09.940]  little boys and girls getting off to it? Yeah. You really think a guy that talks
[02:56:09.940 --> 02:56:16.420]  like that? And is that audacious about grooming and sexualizing children?
[02:56:16.420 --> 02:56:23.700]  Wouldn't you, you'd put that past them? These people are completely insane. They
[02:56:23.700 --> 02:56:30.580]  belong in mental institutions, not in classrooms. They belong on lists that
[02:56:30.580 --> 02:56:37.540]  warn parents about predators. Radical pro trans college professor won't let her
[02:56:37.540 --> 02:56:43.100]  daughter watch shows with white boy leads. She's white, by the way. Yeah, those
[02:56:43.100 --> 02:56:47.060]  white guys, they're awfully bad. It's kind of like when Jennifer Lawrence was
[02:56:47.060 --> 02:56:50.700]  like, well, you know, I was the first female lead ever. We weren't sure it was
[02:56:50.700 --> 02:56:53.820]  going to be successful with the Hunger Games, me being the first female lead,
[02:56:53.820 --> 02:57:00.660]  and the entire movie industry and fans of movies were like, hey, hey, you
[02:57:00.660 --> 02:57:05.100]  narcissistic bimbo. Have you ever heard of this list of movies, which is just, you
[02:57:05.100 --> 02:57:10.580]  know, dozens of movies with strong female leads, Tomb Raider, Alien. The list just
[02:57:10.580 --> 02:57:14.180]  goes on, but she had to make it all about her. And that's what it's really all
[02:57:14.180 --> 02:57:18.660]  about at the end of the day. It's just all about them. That individual, the
[02:57:18.660 --> 02:57:22.860]  dean of students there, he's obviously got his own weird sexual preferences, and
[02:57:22.860 --> 02:57:26.820]  so he wants to use that and bring that into the children. He wants to make that
[02:57:26.820 --> 02:57:31.700]  fun with the children. It's all about him. Wolk military threatens mother who
[02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:35.860]  questioned LGBTQ school indoctrination. Oh, you don't like us grooming your
[02:57:35.860 --> 02:57:40.220]  kids? You don't like us mainstreaming pedophilia? We're going to send the
[02:57:40.220 --> 02:57:45.500]  military after you. This is Biden's America.
[02:57:48.500 --> 02:57:54.100]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free

[02:58:47.860 --> 02:58:54.660]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got
[02:58:54.660 --> 02:58:59.460]  sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:58:59.460 --> 02:59:05.300]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather. Of course, it wasn't
[02:59:05.300 --> 02:59:09.420]  the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, but what was killing
[02:59:09.420 --> 02:59:16.420]  people was a lack of vitamin D3. You see the sun via your skin helps your body
[02:59:16.420 --> 02:59:21.540]  produce vitamin D3, but if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce
[02:59:21.540 --> 02:59:25.340]  vitamin D3, and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start
[02:59:25.340 --> 02:59:28.940]  replicating and taking your body over. So now it's more important than ever
[02:59:28.940 --> 02:59:33.060]  because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin D3, and we have the best
[02:59:33.060 --> 02:59:38.100]  with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your body for 50%

[02:59:55.340 --> 03:00:23.340]  Transmuting the world wide from the summit.new studios in the United Kingdom,
[03:00:23.340 --> 03:00:27.340]  you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:00:29.340 --> 03:00:35.340]  We're live, it is the Summit News Hour for this December 8th, 2022 edition.
[03:00:35.340 --> 03:00:40.340]  Gonna cover a whole host of stories over the course of the next hour, and yes, we're
[03:00:40.340 --> 03:00:48.340]  gonna get into the Harry and Meghan self-victim hood. Race baiting, grievance, pity party with the
[03:00:48.340 --> 03:00:53.340]  launch of their self-obsessed new Netflix special. They've dropped three episodes
[03:00:53.340 --> 03:00:59.340]  today and other three episodes coming. The people behind it, the narratives, the
[03:00:59.340 --> 03:01:03.340]  false narratives that they're pushing. Of course, Prince Harry got up in front of
[03:01:03.340 --> 03:01:08.340]  the UN not too long ago, and not only did he talk about the planet literally being on
[03:01:08.340 --> 03:01:13.340]  fire, as he of course takes private jet trips around the world, including to pick up a
[03:01:13.340 --> 03:01:18.340]  climate change award. He also talked about the threat of disinformation.
[03:01:18.340 --> 03:01:24.340]  Well, even in the first 30 seconds of their trailer for this Netflix special, there were
[03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:28.340]  numerous examples of disinformation. We're going to talk about some of the fallout
[03:01:28.340 --> 03:01:33.340]  that's happened as a result of that. We're also going to talk about climate
[03:01:33.340 --> 03:01:37.340]  lockdowns, because if you remember back during the coronavirus lockdowns, which
[03:01:37.340 --> 03:01:42.340]  were proven to be an unscientific totalitarian outrage, and it took two
[03:01:42.340 --> 03:01:47.340]  years for everyone to start admitting that, well, at the time, we read news articles,
[03:01:47.340 --> 03:01:53.340]  we saw top environmentalist praising how quiet it was, how nature had returned,
[03:01:53.340 --> 03:01:59.340]  how everything was so serene, how maybe we should do this again in the future,
[03:01:59.340 --> 03:02:04.340]  only in the name of preventing global warming, a completely made up historical
[03:02:04.340 --> 03:02:09.340]  nonsense topic. Now, at the time, during the lockdowns, we came out and said they're
[03:02:09.340 --> 03:02:13.340]  going to start pushing climate lockdowns. You're not allowed to go outside a certain
[03:02:13.340 --> 03:02:17.340]  area. You're not allowed to drive your vehicles in certain areas because you're
[03:02:17.340 --> 03:02:23.340]  harming, you're killing the planet. Now, at that exact same time, the mainstream
[03:02:23.340 --> 03:02:27.340]  media, the regime narrative came out that climate lockdowns were a baseless
[03:02:27.340 --> 03:02:32.340]  conspiracy theory. How dare you even suggest we're planning that? Of course,
[03:02:32.340 --> 03:02:36.340]  on the very same day when news outlets like Sky News came out and claimed that it
[03:02:36.340 --> 03:02:41.340]  was all a baseless conspiracy theory, Indian cities were literally telling their
[03:02:41.340 --> 03:02:46.340]  people to stay indoors. They banned cars in major cities because of pollution,
[03:02:46.340 --> 03:02:52.340]  because of the climate. So it was already happening two years ago. Now it's about
[03:02:52.340 --> 03:03:00.340]  to happen for real on a sustained basis in the United Kingdom in a major city,
[03:03:00.340 --> 03:03:06.340]  city of Oxford. Now, a couple of days ago, what's up with that, which is a top
[03:03:06.340 --> 03:03:11.340]  climate change skeptic website, came out with an article pointing out that the
[03:03:11.340 --> 03:03:16.340]  local council, the local authorities in Oxford had outlined this scheme, which
[03:03:16.340 --> 03:03:21.340]  they were set to trial. And in fact, the trials are already beginning to designate
[03:03:21.340 --> 03:03:27.340]  residents who live in the city of Oxford, individual regions where they're not
[03:03:27.340 --> 03:03:33.340]  allowed to drive their private vehicle outside of that region more than 100
[03:03:33.340 --> 03:03:38.340]  times a year. You can do it 100 times a year with government permission. That,
[03:03:38.340 --> 03:03:43.340]  of course, equates to two times a week. If you live in a certain area of the city
[03:03:43.340 --> 03:03:49.340]  of Oxford and you drive to work five times a week to an area of Oxford, which is
[03:03:49.340 --> 03:03:52.340]  maybe on the other side of the city, on the outskirts or even in a different
[03:03:52.340 --> 03:03:58.340]  town, you will only be allowed to leave your region twice a week with government
[03:03:58.340 --> 03:04:02.340]  permission. If you're a naughty boy or girl and you do that more than twice a
[03:04:02.340 --> 03:04:07.340]  week, you will be hit with onerous fines at the same level as speeding fines,
[03:04:07.340 --> 03:04:14.340]  which in the UK, it's about £70, which is, of course, about $100. Now you add
[03:04:14.340 --> 03:04:19.340]  that up over the course of the week. That is an onerous level of fines. The
[03:04:19.340 --> 03:04:24.340]  council came out after this article went viral and tried to fact check the claims
[03:04:24.340 --> 03:04:29.340]  within it, but in doing so, only basically acknowledged and admitted that the
[03:04:29.340 --> 03:04:34.340]  entire scheme was taking place. That is massive. The first of its kind that
[03:04:34.340 --> 03:04:38.340]  we've seen and an indication of what's going to happen in the future with
[03:04:38.340 --> 03:04:42.340]  these networks of automatic license plate scanning surveillance cameras
[03:04:42.340 --> 03:04:48.340]  blanketing major cities. That's what they were designed to be from the very
[03:04:48.340 --> 03:04:51.340]  beginning. We're going to get into that and some more bombshell news on the
[03:04:51.340 --> 03:05:19.340]  other side. Submit.news.go away. We'll be right back.
[03:05:21.340 --> 03:05:50.340]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:51.340 --> 03:06:16.340]  And go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to the wellness company.
[03:06:16.340 --> 03:06:21.340]  What soldiers of the great reset globalist technocratic agenda have been
[03:06:21.340 --> 03:06:25.340]  out on the streets of London for basically now what, the past two months
[03:06:25.340 --> 03:06:30.340]  plus blocking traffic, blocking ambulances, causing major accidents in
[03:06:30.340 --> 03:06:34.340]  some cases. Legally, they were stopped from doing that. They were prevented
[03:06:34.340 --> 03:06:39.340]  from doing that. Now they're doing slow walks through major streets in
[03:06:39.340 --> 03:06:43.340]  London on a daily basis. The public absolutely hates it. They have an
[03:06:43.340 --> 03:06:47.340]  approval rating of about 8%. They don't care. They're not trying to convince
[03:06:47.340 --> 03:06:51.340]  anyone because they know they have establishment backing. They're
[03:06:51.340 --> 03:06:57.340]  literally funded by Getty, oil, billionaire money. Every major
[03:06:57.340 --> 03:07:02.340]  institution, every major transnational corporation, bank, legacy media outlet,
[03:07:02.340 --> 03:07:07.340]  academic front supports their agenda. The government is enacting their
[03:07:07.340 --> 03:07:12.340]  agenda every single day with the march, the relentless historical march
[03:07:12.340 --> 03:07:18.340]  towards net zero. They're just not doing it quite as fast enough as these
[03:07:18.340 --> 03:07:23.340]  eco warrior groups want them to. Of course, Just Stop Oil is a rebrand of
[03:07:23.340 --> 03:07:27.340]  Extinction Rebellion. Extinction Rebellion has been around for a fair few
[03:07:27.340 --> 03:07:32.340]  years now. Their stunts garnered them again, widespread disdain amongst
[03:07:32.340 --> 03:07:36.340]  the public. They became very unpopular. So they merely rebranded
[03:07:36.340 --> 03:07:41.340]  themselves. They were called Insulate Britain last year. Now they're back
[03:07:41.340 --> 03:07:45.340]  in the eyes of Just Stop Oil. These are the people who are out attacking
[03:07:45.340 --> 03:07:50.340]  precious works of art in art galleries with pain, with substances
[03:07:50.340 --> 03:07:54.340]  ironically that come from the oil industry. They're literally made from
[03:07:54.340 --> 03:07:58.340]  oil. They don't care about it. They're rampant hypocrites. They're not trying
[03:07:58.340 --> 03:08:03.340]  to convince anyone because they don't need to. They have establishment
[03:08:03.340 --> 03:08:08.340]  backing. Headline, Just Stop Oil activists admit using petrol cars
[03:08:08.340 --> 03:08:14.340]  claim they're not hypocrites. I'm a vegan. I eat meat, but I'm not a
[03:08:14.340 --> 03:08:18.340]  hypocrite. Okay then. That's literally what they're saying now. This is the
[03:08:18.340 --> 03:08:22.340]  level. Leading activists with climate change protest group Just Stop Oil
[03:08:22.340 --> 03:08:26.340]  have admitted that they drive petrol cars. You can't have an annual family
[03:08:26.340 --> 03:08:30.340]  holiday though. You're bad. You need to reduce your carbon footprint. But
[03:08:30.340 --> 03:08:34.340]  still claim that this doesn't make them hypocrites. This was a report in the
[03:08:34.340 --> 03:08:39.340]  telegraph where they interviewed Dr. Larch Maxie, another posh professor
[03:08:39.340 --> 03:08:43.340]  with plums in his mouth. They're all upper middle class toffs living on
[03:08:43.340 --> 03:08:47.340]  mummy and daddy's money. Nothing going on in their lives. So what do they
[03:08:47.340 --> 03:08:52.340]  need to do? They need social media clout. Maxie, a climate scientist from
[03:08:52.340 --> 03:08:56.340]  the eco group, said some members still drive cars and fill up with
[03:08:56.340 --> 03:09:01.340]  petrol, but rejected the idea that it was hypocritical. Now bear in mind
[03:09:01.340 --> 03:09:06.340]  not only do you have electric cars now, people would say, well, they're too
[03:09:06.340 --> 03:09:10.340]  expensive. They can't afford them. The United Kingdom is not like America in
[03:09:10.340 --> 03:09:15.340]  the sense that it's a way smaller country. Obviously, we have a vast public
[03:09:15.340 --> 03:09:20.340]  transport network, which despite all the strikes and all the people who work
[03:09:20.340 --> 03:09:24.340]  within that public transport network constantly demanding pay raises and
[03:09:24.340 --> 03:09:29.340]  striking is still pretty good. It covers the entire country trains,
[03:09:29.340 --> 03:09:34.340]  buses, you name it. It's pretty good. You can get around fairly easily. This
[03:09:34.340 --> 03:09:39.340]  will sound absolutely alien to people living in America with their six
[03:09:39.340 --> 03:09:44.340]  lanes of traffic where in Austin or any of these major cities, Dallas, you
[03:09:44.340 --> 03:09:48.340]  can't walk anywhere. It's basically a war on the pedestrian, which I don't
[03:09:48.340 --> 03:09:52.340]  think they've got the balance right. So they'd be shocked to learn that yes,
[03:09:52.340 --> 03:09:57.340]  indeed, in the United Kingdom, you can basically get anywhere within a
[03:09:57.340 --> 03:10:02.340]  reasonable amount of time using buses, using trains. Of course, it's more
[03:10:02.340 --> 03:10:06.340]  convenient to use a car and everyone should have the right to do that. But
[03:10:06.340 --> 03:10:10.340]  you can get out of using a car. So it's no excuse to say, oh, we can't use a
[03:10:10.340 --> 03:10:15.340]  car because we can't get anywhere. You can. Every single major city and town in
[03:10:15.340 --> 03:10:19.340]  the United Kingdom is festooned with cycle lanes to the point where they will
[03:10:19.340 --> 03:10:24.340]  literally close off entire major roads, which have funnel traffic, important
[03:10:24.340 --> 03:10:29.340]  traffic to different areas of the city and turn them entirely over to cycle
[03:10:29.340 --> 03:10:35.340]  lanes. They install 20 mile per hour speed limit zones throughout major
[03:10:35.340 --> 03:10:41.340]  cities. Now it started in London. It's actually dangerous to go that slow. I
[03:10:41.340 --> 03:10:44.340]  mean, have you ever been driving and you stuck behind someone who's incredibly
[03:10:44.340 --> 03:10:49.340]  slow doing 20 miles an hour below the speed limit that's supposedly in place
[03:10:49.340 --> 03:10:53.340]  for that road? You literally have to concentrate while you're driving. It's
[03:10:53.340 --> 03:10:59.340]  dangerous. So everything caters for the eco mentalist warrior in the United
[03:10:59.340 --> 03:11:03.340]  Kingdom in terms of transport. They've got so many different options. But no,
[03:11:03.340 --> 03:11:09.340]  these eco warriors who say, just stop oil, shut down the entire industry now.
[03:11:09.340 --> 03:11:14.340]  Is it too much to ask them to take alternative green forms of transport?
[03:11:14.340 --> 03:11:19.340]  Well, apparently so. According to activist leaders, they are victims of the
[03:11:19.340 --> 03:11:24.340]  fossil fuel economy. Maxi says people who call for the oil industry to be
[03:11:24.340 --> 03:11:27.340]  shut down but then drive petrol cars shouldn't be called out for hypocrisy
[03:11:27.340 --> 03:11:31.340]  because they're just doing our best within that to push for the necessary
[03:11:31.340 --> 03:11:36.340]  change. Again, it's literally like some militant hardcore vegan lecturing
[03:11:36.340 --> 03:11:41.340]  you about eating a McDonald's or eating a steak in a fancy restaurant, then
[03:11:41.340 --> 03:11:48.340]  going home and talking into a frigging Burger King. Yes, you can live by your
[03:11:48.340 --> 03:11:53.340]  cause without being a massive hypocrite. And what did we see with Insulate
[03:11:53.340 --> 03:11:57.340]  Britain, another offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, of just stop oil. It's all
[03:11:57.340 --> 03:12:03.340]  the same people. The leader of Insulate Britain, and again, the same people
[03:12:03.340 --> 03:12:07.340]  were out last year under the banner of this name, blocking the road, stopping
[03:12:07.340 --> 03:12:12.340]  ambulances, closing absolute bedlam, protected by the establishment, as I'll
[03:12:12.340 --> 03:12:18.340]  talk about in a minute. This was the leader of this group who said he
[03:12:18.340 --> 03:12:23.340]  didn't even insulate his own home and doesn't care about insulating homes.
[03:12:23.340 --> 03:12:27.340]  The leader of the group calling for all homes in Britain to be insulated,
[03:12:27.340 --> 03:12:32.340]  didn't even do it himself. Rampant hypocrisy, but again, it goes beyond
[03:12:32.340 --> 03:12:36.340]  hypocrisy. It's about attention seeking, it's about social media clout, and
[03:12:36.340 --> 03:12:43.340]  it's about do as we say, not as we do. And again, the government, every
[03:12:43.340 --> 03:12:46.340]  major cultural institution, transnational corporation, bang, academic
[03:12:46.340 --> 03:12:51.340]  institution, legacy media outlet, they're all pushing the same message. How is
[03:12:51.340 --> 03:12:56.340]  that an organic grassroots resistance movement when the entire regime
[03:12:56.340 --> 03:13:01.340]  establishment is on the same side of you and is pushing your message? And not
[03:13:01.340 --> 03:13:06.340]  only that, we saw the treatment of anti lockdown protesters, of anti
[03:13:06.340 --> 03:13:10.340]  vaccine mandate protesters across the world, of course, in Canada, getting
[03:13:10.340 --> 03:13:14.340]  their bank accounts frozen, being treated like literal domestic terrorists.
[03:13:14.340 --> 03:13:19.340]  You also saw it in the UK. I attended several anti lockdown marches, rallies.
[03:13:19.340 --> 03:13:25.340]  If any anti lockdown protesters, anti vaccine Monday protesters blocked a
[03:13:25.340 --> 03:13:30.340]  major road in London, the two frigging minutes they would send in the riot
[03:13:30.340 --> 03:13:35.340]  cops to crack skulls. I was right in the middle of it. I got footage of it and
[03:13:35.340 --> 03:13:42.340]  posted it on Twitter last summer, July 2021. They steamed in. These hippies were
[03:13:42.340 --> 03:13:47.340]  sat in the middle of the road dancing to Bob Marley music. Two minutes later,
[03:13:47.340 --> 03:13:52.340]  full riot cops steamed in to get them out of the way. How do they treat just
[03:13:52.340 --> 03:13:56.340]  stop oil protesters? Well, we've seen how they treat them when they sit in the
[03:13:56.340 --> 03:14:00.340]  middle of the road. They give them cups of tea and cancelling and say, oh, if
[03:14:00.340 --> 03:14:05.340]  there's anything you need, just let us know. They sit there for hours. The
[03:14:05.340 --> 03:14:11.340]  police do nothing. The public outcry was so vast that they finally passed a
[03:14:11.340 --> 03:14:16.340]  new law or changed the existing law to empower the police to shift them if
[03:14:16.340 --> 03:14:20.340]  they sit in the middle of the road. So now they're just slow walking through
[03:14:20.340 --> 03:14:23.340]  major cities with traffic backed up behind them anyway, basically the same
[03:14:23.340 --> 03:14:30.340]  thing. And they're still getting police protection, telegraph reports. Just
[03:14:30.340 --> 03:14:34.340]  stop oil, skip lorry plows through park to dodge protests and is then stopped
[03:14:34.340 --> 03:14:39.340]  by the police. Anyone who shouts at these upper middle class snobs, one guy
[03:14:39.340 --> 03:14:44.340]  threw an orange at them, didn't hit them. They're immediately pounced on by
[03:14:44.340 --> 03:14:50.340]  the cops. These people can cause major chaos. People have literally died not
[03:14:50.340 --> 03:14:54.340]  only from not getting to hospital in time, but through other pile ups which
[03:14:54.340 --> 03:14:58.340]  occur as a result of the traffic building on other roads. There was a woman
[03:14:58.340 --> 03:15:02.340]  who had to be airlifted to hospital. She didn't make it. She died because of
[03:15:02.340 --> 03:15:07.340]  this group's actions. Their protest is literally killing people, which is
[03:15:07.340 --> 03:15:12.340]  any definition of domestic terrorism in any other language. And they do
[03:15:12.340 --> 03:15:17.340]  nothing. A skip truck drive the road into a park while yelling expletives at
[03:15:17.340 --> 03:15:21.340]  police officers as he dodged the just stop oil blockade. He mounted the
[03:15:21.340 --> 03:15:25.340]  pavement, sped through the grass and trees of Stoke Newington Common and
[03:15:25.340 --> 03:15:30.340]  creamed off the pavement to the other side of the road. A police car raced
[03:15:30.340 --> 03:15:33.340]  after the trucker following the incident again. They're causing mass
[03:15:33.340 --> 03:15:38.340]  bedlam and chaos in the capital of England. This frustrated truck driver
[03:15:38.340 --> 03:15:43.340]  tries to take a shortcut through a park to get past them to get in front of
[03:15:43.340 --> 03:15:48.340]  them. He's pounced on like he's the terrorist, like he's the criminal. The
[03:15:48.340 --> 03:15:51.340]  trucker gave the middle finger to police officers walking alongside the
[03:15:51.340 --> 03:15:55.340]  protest and yelled, you're just as bad as them. We'll have more. We'll be back.
[03:15:55.340 --> 03:15:59.340]  Submit dot news. Don't go. So when I first started taking survival shield,
[03:15:59.340 --> 03:16:03.340]  basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had brain fog like you wouldn't
[03:16:03.340 --> 03:16:07.340]  believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your
[03:16:07.340 --> 03:16:10.340]  show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original
[03:16:10.340 --> 03:16:14.340]  survival shield, the X1. And it worked pretty good. And then shortly
[03:16:14.340 --> 03:16:16.340]  thereafter, you came out with that stew. You had, you know, with a deeper
[03:16:16.340 --> 03:16:19.340]  source, you know, and I got really excited about that. So I took it. And
[03:16:19.340 --> 03:16:24.340]  man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain
[03:16:24.340 --> 03:16:28.340]  was enlightened. You know, I could think again. I could connect with people
[03:16:28.340 --> 03:16:32.340]  again. And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health
[03:16:32.340 --> 03:16:36.340]  back and I religiously took basically all of your supplements. They're all
[03:16:36.340 --> 03:16:40.340]  absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is knockout literally
[03:16:40.340 --> 03:16:43.340]  like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway,
[03:16:43.340 --> 03:16:47.340]  so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the
[03:16:47.340 --> 03:16:51.340]  globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into
[03:16:51.340 --> 03:16:54.340]  our own hands. Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call
[03:16:54.340 --> 03:17:00.340]  and Godspeed. It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on
[03:17:00.340 --> 03:17:06.340]  air, broadcasting free worldwide. And it seems quite real that things can
[03:17:06.340 --> 03:17:12.340]  change in an instant. Things are getting very weird. And it's definitely
[03:17:12.340 --> 03:17:17.340]  more difficult than ever to even know what's going on. But we'll keep doing
[03:17:17.340 --> 03:17:22.340]  our best so long as you keep us on the air. And you could do that now at
[03:17:22.340 --> 03:17:28.340]  infowarstore.com. Help us clear out our stock of bodies, tumor, vitamin C
[03:17:28.340 --> 03:17:33.340]  with zinc and alpha power. Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the
[03:17:33.340 --> 03:17:39.340]  highest quality supplements available while they still last. Now with free
[03:17:39.340 --> 03:17:45.340]  shipping. We thank you for your support. And we wish you a very peaceful,
[03:17:45.340 --> 03:17:48.340]  happy and merry Christmas.
[03:17:48.340 --> 03:18:00.340]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process. The only thing that made
[03:18:00.340 --> 03:18:04.340]  any Republican victories tonight possible. The only thing that made any
[03:18:04.340 --> 03:18:09.340]  resistance to the war machine possible. The only thing that made any
[03:18:09.340 --> 03:18:13.340]  opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns
[03:18:13.340 --> 03:18:18.340]  and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible. And that made
[03:18:18.340 --> 03:18:22.340]  any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support info wars
[03:18:22.340 --> 03:18:26.340]  despite the massive law fair being waged against info wars, despite the
[03:18:26.340 --> 03:18:32.340]  media defamatory libelous campaign against info wars. The ordinary people,
[03:18:32.340 --> 03:18:36.340]  the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier,
[03:18:36.340 --> 03:18:40.340]  wealthier and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air. And what that does is
[03:18:40.340 --> 03:18:45.340]  keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian
[03:18:45.340 --> 03:18:49.340]  oppression. So continue to do it. Go to places like info wars store.com.
[03:18:49.340 --> 03:18:53.340]  Go to the places like save info wars. Continue to keep info wars alive
[03:18:53.340 --> 03:18:57.340]  because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[03:18:57.340 --> 03:19:02.340]  It's a post COVID world now. Americans have lost trust in their doctors
[03:19:02.340 --> 03:19:06.340]  and the healthcare system. There's a solution. The wellness company.
[03:19:06.340 --> 03:19:10.340]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and I'm the chief scientific officer. And I can tell
[03:19:10.340 --> 03:19:15.340]  you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[03:19:15.340 --> 03:19:20.340]  doctors on demand, prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies
[03:19:20.340 --> 03:19:26.340]  in home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online
[03:19:26.340 --> 03:19:31.340]  set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical
[03:19:31.340 --> 03:19:37.340]  care, but also COVID-19 acute and post COVID syndromes, vaccine injury
[03:19:37.340 --> 03:19:42.340]  syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through
[03:19:42.340 --> 03:19:48.340]  in this new world that we're living in. So go to onlinehealthnow.com
[03:19:48.340 --> 03:19:53.340]  and check out the wellness company for a low monthly fee. You can get started
[03:19:53.340 --> 03:19:58.340]  today and on a pathway to better health.
[03:19:58.340 --> 03:20:04.340]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:08.340 --> 03:20:18.340]  Broadcasting internationally from the summit.news headquarters in the United Kingdom,
[03:20:18.340 --> 03:20:21.340]  it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:21.340 --> 03:20:29.340]  So this Just Stop Oil Eco Warrior establishment funded group, literally
[03:20:29.340 --> 03:20:35.340]  funded by billionaires continues to cause chaos across London. One van driver,
[03:20:35.340 --> 03:20:39.340]  as I explained before the break, got frustrated, tried to get ahead of them.
[03:20:39.340 --> 03:20:42.340]  He was immediately pounced on by the police because he's the bigger threat,
[03:20:42.340 --> 03:20:47.340]  obviously. There was another guy who threw an orange at the eco group.
[03:20:47.340 --> 03:20:52.340]  Again, the headline is Just Stop Oil Police Tell Furious Pedestrian Who Threw Orange
[03:20:52.340 --> 03:20:57.340]  to basically leave them alone as it prompted four police officers to rush
[03:20:57.340 --> 03:21:02.340]  over him. Bear in mind, these police officers are marching side by side
[03:21:02.340 --> 03:21:08.340]  as if they're part of the movement with Just Stop Oil in the streets.
[03:21:08.340 --> 03:21:12.340]  Just the sight of that makes the public angry and frustrated, as you can tell.
[03:21:12.340 --> 03:21:17.340]  They're not trying to stop them do anything. So four police officers rushed
[03:21:17.340 --> 03:21:22.340]  over quick because he threw an orange at them, which didn't even hit anyone
[03:21:22.340 --> 03:21:27.340]  and told him to, quote, leave them to it. An officer told the pedestrian,
[03:21:27.340 --> 03:21:31.340]  they're minding their own business. What harm are they doing to you?
[03:21:31.340 --> 03:21:36.340]  They're literally siding with them. None of this nonsense about, oh,
[03:21:36.340 --> 03:21:41.340]  we want to arrest them. We just can't. A lot of these cops are basically eco
[03:21:41.340 --> 03:21:45.340]  warriors as well. You've seen what they do elsewhere. They literally go out and arrest
[03:21:45.340 --> 03:21:50.340]  people for posting mean things about transgenders on Facebook.
[03:21:50.340 --> 03:21:54.340]  Another officer said, this is your final warning or you'll get nicked.
[03:21:54.340 --> 03:22:00.340]  Again, some of these same cops literally dance in the streets with these eco-warrior
[03:22:00.340 --> 03:22:05.340]  criminals as they do at the Gay Pride Parades.
[03:22:05.340 --> 03:22:10.340]  Absolutely incredible. Then listen to this.
[03:22:10.340 --> 03:22:15.340]  There's another quote in this article, which I couldn't believe.
[03:22:15.340 --> 03:22:17.340]  Here it is.
[03:22:17.340 --> 03:22:23.340]  It says, during Thursday morning's protest, a Met police officer asks Sean Irish,
[03:22:23.340 --> 03:22:28.340]  the just stop oil health and safety officer, leading the protest.
[03:22:28.340 --> 03:22:31.340]  This is what the cop said to the protest leader.
[03:22:31.340 --> 03:22:37.340]  Do you know how long you're going to be in the road for, sir?
[03:22:37.340 --> 03:22:41.340]  That cat, they would never say that to anti-vaccine mandate protesters.
[03:22:41.340 --> 03:22:47.340]  They're the most confrontational, aggressive individuals when it comes to those kind of
[03:22:47.340 --> 03:22:51.340]  protests. Some protestors are better than others, I guess.
[03:22:51.340 --> 03:22:55.340]  This is the Met police officer literally asking the leader of the group that's
[03:22:55.340 --> 03:22:58.340]  committing crimes.
[03:22:58.340 --> 03:23:02.340]  Do you know how long you're going to be in the road for, sir?
[03:23:02.340 --> 03:23:07.340]  They're commanding the police. The police aren't even telling them what to do.
[03:23:07.340 --> 03:23:10.340]  They're telling the police what to do.
[03:23:10.340 --> 03:23:14.340]  When Mr. Irish responded that he did not know, the police officer replied,
[03:23:14.340 --> 03:23:18.340]  is there anything I could ask you that you might want to tell us just to help us
[03:23:18.340 --> 03:23:20.340]  manage the rest of London?
[03:23:20.340 --> 03:23:23.340]  What the hell?
[03:23:23.340 --> 03:23:25.340]  That is incredible.
[03:23:25.340 --> 03:23:31.340]  Is there anything I could ask you that you might want to tell us?
[03:23:31.340 --> 03:23:32.340]  Oh, my God.
[03:23:32.340 --> 03:23:35.340]  A pedestrian waiting for a bus later took his anger out in the strolling
[03:23:35.340 --> 03:23:37.340]  officers walking alongside the blockade shouting,
[03:23:37.340 --> 03:23:43.340]  why are eight police officers walking alongside them for F's sake?
[03:23:43.340 --> 03:23:45.340]  God.
[03:23:45.340 --> 03:23:52.340]  Just for optics, at least act like you're somewhat adversarial towards these
[03:23:52.340 --> 03:23:59.340]  eco-warriors who are stopping ordinary working people from getting to work.
[03:23:59.340 --> 03:24:01.340]  They're blocking ambulances.
[03:24:01.340 --> 03:24:04.340]  I put footage of that in my video.
[03:24:04.340 --> 03:24:06.340]  They're literally blocking ambulances.
[03:24:06.340 --> 03:24:09.340]  They're causing accidents which are killing people.
[03:24:09.340 --> 03:24:11.340]  And the police are going up to them and saying,
[03:24:11.340 --> 03:24:13.340]  is there anything that you need?
[03:24:13.340 --> 03:24:15.340]  Could we help you in any way?
[03:24:15.340 --> 03:24:18.340]  It's pathetic. That's why people are angry.
[03:24:18.340 --> 03:24:20.340]  It's not really the protesters.
[03:24:20.340 --> 03:24:23.340]  It's the way that they're treated by the police.
[03:24:23.340 --> 03:24:25.340]  Same with BLM.
[03:24:25.340 --> 03:24:28.340]  Literally, they might as well start kneeling before them.
[03:24:28.340 --> 03:24:31.340]  Why don't you start doing that?
[03:24:31.340 --> 03:24:34.340]  And this is the absolute foundation of all this.
[03:24:34.340 --> 03:24:39.340]  They're pushing hysterical nonsense which is harming people's lives,
[03:24:39.340 --> 03:24:43.340]  which is causing fuel poverty, which is killing people.
[03:24:43.340 --> 03:24:48.340]  We've got warnings this week in the UK about low temperatures.
[03:24:48.340 --> 03:24:54.340]  It's down to about minus one degrees outside as I make this program where I live.
[03:24:54.340 --> 03:24:59.340]  They're telling pensioners, you have to keep your heating at 18 degrees Celsius
[03:24:59.340 --> 03:25:01.340]  or you may get ill and die.
[03:25:01.340 --> 03:25:05.340]  Many people can't do that because they can't afford to pay the heating bill
[03:25:05.340 --> 03:25:10.340]  because of the same green levies that these protesters are pushing
[03:25:10.340 --> 03:25:13.340]  that the government is enacting.
[03:25:13.340 --> 03:25:15.340]  So yeah, people are going to die.
[03:25:15.340 --> 03:25:19.340]  There was a guy who posted his heating bill on Twitter yesterday
[03:25:19.340 --> 03:25:22.340]  and I put this in one of the videos today.
[03:25:22.340 --> 03:25:25.340]  His heating bill is £1,000 plus a month.
[03:25:25.340 --> 03:25:29.340]  That's about $1,300 per month.
[03:25:29.340 --> 03:25:33.340]  That's like a mortgage for most people.
[03:25:33.340 --> 03:25:37.340]  That's more than a lot of people earning a month, just the heating bill alone
[03:25:37.340 --> 03:25:40.340]  because of the current thing, keep waving your Ukraine flag,
[03:25:40.340 --> 03:25:45.340]  and because of these green levies that incentivize useless wind turbines
[03:25:45.340 --> 03:25:51.340]  that can't cover the energy demands of the population and that's only getting worse.
[03:25:51.340 --> 03:25:56.340]  So they're literally pushing that paradigm where people, old people,
[03:25:56.340 --> 03:26:01.340]  OIPs can't afford to put the heating on because of these green levies
[03:26:01.340 --> 03:26:03.340]  and they're literally going to die in their own homes.
[03:26:03.340 --> 03:26:06.340]  And these people claim to have the moral high ground
[03:26:06.340 --> 03:26:09.340]  when they're supported by every branch of the establishment
[03:26:09.340 --> 03:26:13.340]  and literally protected by the police on a daily basis.
[03:26:13.340 --> 03:26:17.340]  UK city defends need climate lockdown policy.
[03:26:17.340 --> 03:26:23.340]  Again, we're not going to have time to play the video now, but I talked about it in the opening segment.
[03:26:23.340 --> 03:26:28.340]  The city of Oxford has embraced the concept of limiting citizens' personal travel
[03:26:28.340 --> 03:26:33.340]  to fight climate change, an idea once dismissed as a conspiracy theory.
[03:26:33.340 --> 03:26:38.340]  And again, I did an article during lockdown
[03:26:38.340 --> 03:26:42.340]  where the Indian government came out in Delhi and these other cities
[03:26:42.340 --> 03:26:47.340]  and said, you're not allowed to drive your car in these certain cities over the course of the next week
[03:26:47.340 --> 03:26:53.340]  because there's too much pollution, there's too much traffic congestion, and it's bad for the planet.
[03:26:53.340 --> 03:26:58.340]  It was a de facto climate lockdown, but because they didn't call it a climate lockdown,
[03:26:58.340 --> 03:27:05.340]  then anyone that claimed it was a climate lockdown was a dangerous conspiracy theorist pushing misinformation.
[03:27:05.340 --> 03:27:11.340]  And of course at the time, on Twitter, maybe not so much now, but definitely on Facebook,
[03:27:11.340 --> 03:27:16.340]  those claims of a climate lockdown were buried in the algorithm
[03:27:16.340 --> 03:27:21.340]  because it was deemed a conspiracy theory by the fact checkers working for legacy media outlets,
[03:27:21.340 --> 03:27:25.340]  which is basically the same thing. They're all the same people,
[03:27:25.340 --> 03:27:29.340]  and yet they claim to be an independent body outside of the mainstream media.
[03:27:29.340 --> 03:27:35.340]  And they said, that's a conspiracy theory, it's not happening on the very day that India was doing it.
[03:27:35.340 --> 03:27:40.340]  Well, now they're rolling it out across the United Kingdom in some of these major cities.
[03:27:40.340 --> 03:27:44.340]  You know, I went back to Sheffield, my home city, a couple of months ago.
[03:27:44.340 --> 03:27:48.340]  They're introducing all the 20 mile per hour roads.
[03:27:48.340 --> 03:27:56.340]  Sheffield's not even really a busy city compared to London, but everywhere is a war on personal choice.
[03:27:56.340 --> 03:28:01.340]  A war on living standards, a war on basically being able to get out anywhere.
[03:28:01.340 --> 03:28:08.340]  Now in Oxford, they're telling people, we will give you permits from the central government, local authorities,
[03:28:08.340 --> 03:28:13.340]  100 permits a year where you're allowed to go outside your little region of Oxford.
[03:28:13.340 --> 03:28:21.340]  Oxford's not even a huge city where you're not allowed to go outside of your little region more than 100 times a year.
[03:28:21.340 --> 03:28:26.340]  If you do so, you'll get fined because we have traffic congestion.
[03:28:26.340 --> 03:28:30.340]  There's literally been massive protests at City Hall in response to this.
[03:28:30.340 --> 03:28:34.340]  It slipped out in the media, it's now becoming a major nationwide issue,
[03:28:34.340 --> 03:28:39.340]  and the local council has come out basically and said, no, that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:28:39.340 --> 03:28:45.340]  We're going to fact check this by pointing out that some of the details about how the scheme is implemented
[03:28:45.340 --> 03:28:48.340]  were slightly exaggerated or inaccurate.
[03:28:48.340 --> 03:28:51.340]  And so the whole thing's a conspiracy theory.
[03:28:51.340 --> 03:28:54.340]  This is the fact checker industrial complex, that's what they do every time.
[03:28:54.340 --> 03:28:56.340]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[03:28:56.340 --> 03:29:05.340]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter
[03:29:05.340 --> 03:29:08.340]  because of something called vapors.
[03:29:08.340 --> 03:29:12.340]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[03:29:12.340 --> 03:29:16.340]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[03:29:16.340 --> 03:29:20.340]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[03:29:20.340 --> 03:29:26.340]  You see, the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[03:29:26.340 --> 03:29:30.340]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3,
[03:29:30.340 --> 03:29:35.340]  and then it's very easy for viruses and other things that start replicating and taking your body over.
[03:29:35.340 --> 03:29:40.340]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter's here to take high quality vitamin D3,
[03:29:40.340 --> 03:29:45.340]  and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your body

[03:29:56.340 --> 03:30:00.340]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[03:30:00.340 --> 03:30:08.340]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:30:08.340 --> 03:30:11.340]  The First Amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away.
[03:30:11.340 --> 03:30:13.340]  Your ability to speak freely.
[03:30:13.340 --> 03:30:15.340]  Your ability to go from Mike Lindell next.
[03:30:15.340 --> 03:30:18.340]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon? Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[03:30:18.340 --> 03:30:21.340]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years.
[03:30:21.340 --> 03:30:25.340]  And I knew they were planning all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[03:30:25.340 --> 03:30:27.340]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:30:27.340 --> 03:30:30.340]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet,
[03:30:30.340 --> 03:30:34.340]  not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[03:30:34.340 --> 03:30:40.340]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars has been because of your past support.
[03:30:40.340 --> 03:30:43.340]  I salute you and I thank you. And I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,

[03:33:22.340 --> 03:33:33.340]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit Dark News.
[03:33:33.340 --> 03:33:38.340]  There are waffles on about it enough now so let's just go to the video and then I'll come back and talk about
[03:33:38.340 --> 03:33:42.340]  Harry and Meghan and their new Netflix special.
[03:33:42.340 --> 03:33:46.340]  But first let's go to this video about the climate lockdowns.
[03:33:46.340 --> 03:33:50.340]  This is called It's Real. Let's roll it.
[03:33:50.340 --> 03:33:54.340]  This is an update to the climate lockdown video from earlier this week.
[03:33:54.340 --> 03:33:59.340]  In case you missed it, local authorities in Oxford, England are trialling a scheme set to be launched in 2024
[03:33:59.340 --> 03:34:06.340]  that would see residents restricted to travelling by car outside their designated regional zone within the city,
[03:34:06.340 --> 03:34:10.340]  being forced to register their vehicle and get permission passes from the government,
[03:34:10.340 --> 03:34:16.340]  which would then only allow them to travel outside of their designated regional zone twice a week
[03:34:16.340 --> 03:34:20.340]  and get generous fines if they violate that, which means if you work in a different part of the city
[03:34:20.340 --> 03:34:24.340]  and have to travel there five times a week, if you make that journey by private car,
[03:34:24.340 --> 03:34:27.340]  they're going to fine you three times a week, every week.
[03:34:27.340 --> 03:34:32.340]  Well now the council has come out and tried to fact check the whole thing as if it isn't happening,
[03:34:32.340 --> 03:34:35.340]  while simultaneously admitting that it's all happening.
[03:34:35.340 --> 03:34:37.340]  The Oxfordshire Mail reports.
[03:34:37.340 --> 03:34:41.340]  Oxfordshire County Council respond to viral article claiming Oxford is going into climate lockdown.
[03:34:41.340 --> 03:34:47.340]  The council has issued a statement after an article went viral claiming the authority would implement a climate lockdown in 2024.
[03:34:47.340 --> 03:34:49.340]  The piece published to a site called What's Up With That,
[03:34:49.340 --> 03:34:54.340]  alleged that Oxfordshire residents would be locked into one of six zones via electronic gates.
[03:34:54.340 --> 03:34:58.340]  The piece continued to say that people living in the county would be confined to their own neighbourhoods
[03:34:58.340 --> 03:35:01.340]  under the trial and would need permission from the council to leave.
[03:35:01.340 --> 03:35:03.340]  Now the council has responded to the claims made in the piece.
[03:35:03.340 --> 03:35:05.340]  Really? Have they debunked it?
[03:35:05.340 --> 03:35:07.340]  Denied that it's happening?
[03:35:07.340 --> 03:35:11.340]  The filters will ban private vehicles from six areas of the city at certain times
[03:35:11.340 --> 03:35:15.340]  and are set to be introduced following the completion of the rail bridge works on Botley Road in 2023.
[03:35:15.340 --> 03:35:18.340]  Right. So it is happening.
[03:35:18.340 --> 03:35:23.340]  Contrary to the viral article's claims, there will be no physical barriers with the restricted zones
[03:35:23.340 --> 03:35:25.340]  monitored by automatic number plate recognition cameras.
[03:35:25.340 --> 03:35:28.340]  Oh don't worry, there'll be no physical barriers.
[03:35:28.340 --> 03:35:33.340]  Your car will be tracked and traced for infractions via a network of surveillance cameras.
[03:35:33.340 --> 03:35:37.340]  So I guess it's okay then. Up to 100 day passes per year will be offered to residents
[03:35:37.340 --> 03:35:41.340]  and businesses affected by the changes, enabling them to travel through the filters without penalty.
[03:35:41.340 --> 03:35:44.340]  Right. So again, it is still happening.
[03:35:44.340 --> 03:35:46.340]  Everywhere in the city will still be accessible by car,
[03:35:46.340 --> 03:35:49.340]  although some private car drivers may need to use a different route
[03:35:49.340 --> 03:35:51.340]  during the operating hours of the traffic filters.
[03:35:51.340 --> 03:35:56.340]  When they are operating, private cars will not be allowed through without a permit.
[03:35:56.340 --> 03:35:57.340]  Right. So it's still happening.
[03:35:57.340 --> 03:36:04.340]  Just because you call it a traffic congestion reduction scheme and not a climate lockdown doesn't mean it's not happening.
[03:36:04.340 --> 03:36:06.340]  It is. So yes, it's all true.
[03:36:06.340 --> 03:36:09.340]  If you exceed your government travel ration,
[03:36:09.340 --> 03:36:13.340]  every time you dare leave your allocator regional zone, they'll find you.
[03:36:13.340 --> 03:36:17.340]  I love how they imply that the coverage of this is fake news or inaccurate
[03:36:17.340 --> 03:36:21.340]  by contesting a couple of details about how the scheme will be implemented,
[03:36:21.340 --> 03:36:24.340]  but then basically acknowledge that it's all going to be implemented anyway.
[03:36:24.340 --> 03:36:28.340]  Meanwhile, thanks in part to the current thing and the move towards net zero,
[03:36:28.340 --> 03:36:30.340]  which is going to make energy even more expensive
[03:36:30.340 --> 03:36:33.340]  for people already struggling through a cost of living crisis.
[03:36:33.340 --> 03:36:37.340]  For some people, it's cheaper to stay in a holiday home in Spain,
[03:36:37.340 --> 03:36:41.340]  where temperatures are still around 20 degrees Celsius as part of a package deal
[03:36:41.340 --> 03:36:44.340]  than it is to heat your home in Britain.
[03:36:44.340 --> 03:36:48.340]  This poor guy is paying over a thousand pounds a month simply to stay warm
[03:36:48.340 --> 03:36:52.340]  when he could be sunning himself on the cost of braver for less money.
[03:36:52.340 --> 03:36:55.340]  And if these climate hysteria clowns get their way,
[03:36:55.340 --> 03:36:57.340]  not only will you be put under climate lockdown,
[03:36:57.340 --> 03:37:01.340]  but your energy bills are just going to get higher and higher.
[03:37:03.340 --> 03:37:07.340]  Now sticking with the subject of climate change hysteria,
[03:37:07.340 --> 03:37:11.340]  in the same week that Meghan and Harry launched the latest installment
[03:37:11.340 --> 03:37:17.340]  of their victimhood pity party, race baiting crap.
[03:37:17.340 --> 03:37:20.340]  Climate change activists Harry and Meghan take private jets
[03:37:20.340 --> 03:37:23.340]  to pick up anti-racism award in New York.
[03:37:23.340 --> 03:37:27.340]  The second private jet trip in the space of one week.
[03:37:27.340 --> 03:37:34.340]  Wait until you find out after what event they took the other private jet trip.
[03:37:34.340 --> 03:37:39.340]  This video is called what have they done now? Let's roll it.
[03:37:39.340 --> 03:37:42.340]  It's everyone's favorite idiotic and sufferable couple.
[03:37:42.340 --> 03:37:43.340]  What have they done now?
[03:37:43.340 --> 03:37:46.340]  Harry and Meghan have been praised as heroic
[03:37:46.340 --> 03:37:50.340]  and given an anti-racism award by other elitists,
[03:37:50.340 --> 03:37:51.340]  so their friends basically,
[03:37:51.340 --> 03:37:56.340]  for their incredibly brave stance against the structural racism of the royal family.
[03:37:56.340 --> 03:37:59.340]  That stands ostensibly comprising of claiming,
[03:37:59.340 --> 03:38:01.340]  with no evidence whatsoever,
[03:38:01.340 --> 03:38:03.340]  that certain members of the royal family speculated
[03:38:03.340 --> 03:38:06.340]  on what skin color Harry and Meghan's newborn baby would be,
[03:38:06.340 --> 03:38:08.340]  something that multiple media publications
[03:38:08.340 --> 03:38:11.340]  engaged in months before the baby was born,
[03:38:11.340 --> 03:38:13.340]  and guess how Harry and Meghan
[03:38:13.340 --> 03:38:17.340]  and sanctimonious climate change activist extraordinaire
[03:38:17.340 --> 03:38:19.340]  arrived at this event in New York.
[03:38:19.340 --> 03:38:22.340]  Why are there luxury private jet, of course?
[03:38:22.340 --> 03:38:24.340]  The second time in the space of one week
[03:38:24.340 --> 03:38:27.340]  that the pair have used such transport.
[03:38:27.340 --> 03:38:31.340]  The first private jet trip was to pick up an environmental award.
[03:38:31.340 --> 03:38:33.340]  Maybe they're trying to beat their previous record
[03:38:33.340 --> 03:38:37.340]  of taking four private jet trips in the space of just 11 days.
[03:38:37.340 --> 03:38:40.340]  Remember, this is the guy who gets up in front of the UN
[03:38:40.340 --> 03:38:42.340]  and claims that the planet is literally burning up.
[03:38:42.340 --> 03:38:45.340]  Our world is on fire, again.
[03:38:45.340 --> 03:38:47.340]  And this crisis will only grow worse.
[03:38:47.340 --> 03:38:48.340]  According to The Independent,
[03:38:48.340 --> 03:38:51.340]  last year the company's non-profit, Archwell,
[03:38:51.340 --> 03:38:52.340]  issued a net zero plan,
[03:38:52.340 --> 03:38:54.340]  which said the organisation is committed
[03:38:54.340 --> 03:38:57.340]  to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030.
[03:38:57.340 --> 03:38:59.340]  Presumably net zero carbon emissions
[03:38:59.340 --> 03:39:02.340]  doesn't include the untold tons of carbon emissions
[03:39:02.340 --> 03:39:04.340]  being belched out by their private jet,
[03:39:04.340 --> 03:39:06.340]  which they continue to use on a regular basis
[03:39:06.340 --> 03:39:08.340]  as part of their opulent lifestyle.
[03:39:08.340 --> 03:39:12.340]  But as ever, it's okay when they do it.
[03:39:12.340 --> 03:39:16.340]  If you're so worried about global warming and carbon emissions,
[03:39:16.340 --> 03:39:19.340]  accept the bloody award remotely via a Zoom call.
[03:39:19.340 --> 03:39:22.340]  Then they could even use that to draw attention to the cause.
[03:39:22.340 --> 03:39:24.340]  Like, oh, we didn't turn up in person
[03:39:24.340 --> 03:39:26.340]  because we wanted to reduce our carbon footprint.
[03:39:26.340 --> 03:39:28.340]  No, they can't do that, can they?
[03:39:28.340 --> 03:39:30.340]  Because they're shameless grifters.
[03:39:30.340 --> 03:39:33.340]  Any opportunity to engage in more attention seeking,
[03:39:33.340 --> 03:39:36.340]  any chance to have other regime loyalists
[03:39:36.340 --> 03:39:39.340]  acknowledge them as really good people
[03:39:39.340 --> 03:39:41.340]  and their egos can't resist.
[03:39:41.340 --> 03:39:43.340]  Suddenly, carbon emissions and saving the planet
[03:39:43.340 --> 03:39:45.340]  very much takes a backseat.
[03:39:45.340 --> 03:39:47.340]  Last night, someone yelled at Harry and Meghan
[03:39:47.340 --> 03:39:50.340]  that they were destroying the royal family.
[03:39:50.340 --> 03:39:53.340]  What do you think they're destroying the royal family?
[03:39:53.340 --> 03:39:55.340]  Forget destroying the royal family.
[03:39:55.340 --> 03:39:58.340]  If they believe carbon emissions are destroying the planet,
[03:39:58.340 --> 03:40:00.340]  then they're destroying the planet.
[03:40:00.340 --> 03:40:02.340]  While lecturing you about your carbon footprint
[03:40:02.340 --> 03:40:04.340]  for taking an annual family holiday.
[03:40:04.340 --> 03:40:05.340]  Our world is on fire.
[03:40:05.340 --> 03:40:07.340]  And if you want more Harry and Meghan cringe,
[03:40:07.340 --> 03:40:09.340]  check out the video I did on the main channel
[03:40:09.340 --> 03:40:11.340]  which is posted in the pinned comment.
[03:40:13.340 --> 03:40:16.340]  Now, on the subject of shameless grifters, of course,
[03:40:16.340 --> 03:40:18.340]  today we've had the release of the first three episodes
[03:40:18.340 --> 03:40:22.340]  of Harry and Meghan's new Netflix docu-series.
[03:40:22.340 --> 03:40:24.340]  Yes, this is the same couple that demanded
[03:40:24.340 --> 03:40:26.340]  ever on respect their privacy.
[03:40:26.340 --> 03:40:29.340]  Said their privacy was being invaded by the press,
[03:40:29.340 --> 03:40:31.340]  by the general public.
[03:40:31.340 --> 03:40:34.340]  Well, now they've literally done a six-hour special
[03:40:34.340 --> 03:40:37.340]  with Netflix, which is slowly being released,
[03:40:37.340 --> 03:40:40.340]  claiming that they're harassed.
[03:40:40.340 --> 03:40:42.340]  Again, this is Prince Harry, right?
[03:40:42.340 --> 03:40:43.340]  He got up in front of the UN.
[03:40:43.340 --> 03:40:46.340]  The same time he did that, the world is on fire speech.
[03:40:46.340 --> 03:40:49.340]  And said that dangerous disinformation
[03:40:49.340 --> 03:40:51.340]  was a threat to democracy.
[03:40:51.340 --> 03:40:53.340]  In the first 30 seconds of the trailer
[03:40:53.340 --> 03:40:55.340]  for this new Netflix show,
[03:40:55.340 --> 03:40:58.340]  they have about four, five different examples
[03:40:58.340 --> 03:41:00.340]  of disinformation.
[03:41:00.340 --> 03:41:02.340]  Your entire narrative is that they're constantly harassed
[03:41:02.340 --> 03:41:04.340]  by the press.
[03:41:04.340 --> 03:41:06.340]  And yet in every single instance where they show them
[03:41:06.340 --> 03:41:08.340]  allegedly being harassed by the press,
[03:41:08.340 --> 03:41:10.340]  it's not even them.
[03:41:10.340 --> 03:41:12.340]  It's British celebrity Katie Price
[03:41:12.340 --> 03:41:14.340]  being photographed by the press.
[03:41:14.340 --> 03:41:16.340]  It's a 10-year-old picture
[03:41:16.340 --> 03:41:19.340]  from a Harry Potter premiere in London
[03:41:19.340 --> 03:41:21.340]  with journalists taking photos.
[03:41:21.340 --> 03:41:25.340]  It's journalists taking photos of Kate Middleton,
[03:41:25.340 --> 03:41:28.340]  Prince William's wife.
[03:41:28.340 --> 03:41:31.340]  Or it's them being photographed by the press
[03:41:31.340 --> 03:41:33.340]  in America, not in the United Kingdom.
[03:41:33.340 --> 03:41:36.340]  Literally four separate brazen examples
[03:41:36.340 --> 03:41:40.340]  of manipulative, misleading misinformation
[03:41:40.340 --> 03:41:43.340]  in their own trailer to this Netflix special,
[03:41:43.340 --> 03:41:46.340]  which, of course, is an addendum to their pity party
[03:41:46.340 --> 03:41:49.340]  self-aggrandizing victimhood narrative
[03:41:49.340 --> 03:41:51.340]  that they've been pushing in this country
[03:41:51.340 --> 03:41:53.340]  for the past, what, three, four years?
[03:41:53.340 --> 03:41:56.340]  Plus now, Breitbart reports,
[03:41:56.340 --> 03:41:58.340]  Harry and Meghan feature prof who said
[03:41:58.340 --> 03:42:01.340]  Queen wanted to be white supremacy figurehead
[03:42:01.340 --> 03:42:03.340]  in Netflix.
[03:42:03.340 --> 03:42:06.340]  Again, this is the same Queen that Harry and Meghan themselves
[03:42:06.340 --> 03:42:08.340]  have praised on numerous occasions.
[03:42:08.340 --> 03:42:11.340]  This is the same Queen that oversaw a royal wedding
[03:42:11.340 --> 03:42:14.340]  attended by thousands of their adoring fans.
[03:42:14.340 --> 03:42:17.340]  And they released it on the day,
[03:42:17.340 --> 03:42:20.340]  three months to the day after the Queen died,
[03:42:20.340 --> 03:42:23.340]  and they've got these extremist left-wing woke professors
[03:42:23.340 --> 03:42:26.340]  in there claiming that the Queen is the figurehead
[03:42:26.340 --> 03:42:28.340]  of white supremacy.
[03:42:28.340 --> 03:42:31.340]  Talking about Queen Elizabeth I, what,
[03:42:31.340 --> 03:42:35.340]  400 friggin' years ago, overseeing slavery.
[03:42:35.340 --> 03:42:38.340]  British people were the first in the world to end slavery.
[03:42:38.340 --> 03:42:41.340]  My ancestors literally risked their lives
[03:42:41.340 --> 03:42:44.340]  to go to Africa to end slavery.
[03:42:44.340 --> 03:42:45.340]  We abolished it.
[03:42:45.340 --> 03:42:48.340]  Slavery still exists across the world right now.
[03:42:48.340 --> 03:42:50.340]  Tell you where it does exist now,
[03:42:50.340 --> 03:42:53.340]  in non-white countries, but no, apparently,
[03:42:53.340 --> 03:42:56.340]  that's black. We'll be back, no go away.
[03:43:23.340 --> 03:43:26.340]  And if you feel like showing us some love today
[03:43:26.340 --> 03:43:28.340]  and help keep us on the air,
[03:43:28.340 --> 03:43:33.340]  you can do so at infowarstore.com.
[03:43:33.340 --> 03:43:36.340]  Products that will make your life better
[03:43:36.340 --> 03:43:41.340]  and allow us to keep broadcasting free worldwide.
[03:43:41.340 --> 03:43:45.340]  We are all in this together through thick and thin.
[03:43:45.340 --> 03:43:48.340]  On behalf of the whole crew, we love you,
[03:43:48.340 --> 03:43:53.340]  we thank you for your support.
[03:43:53.340 --> 03:43:56.340]  Infowarstore.com
[03:43:56.340 --> 03:43:59.340]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones,
[03:43:59.340 --> 03:44:02.340]  needs to support InfoWars and band.video.
[03:44:02.340 --> 03:44:05.340]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[03:44:05.340 --> 03:44:06.340]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[03:44:06.340 --> 03:44:10.340]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[03:44:10.340 --> 03:44:13.340]  You guys have no idea how many people have got
[03:44:13.340 --> 03:44:15.340]  their first start like Savannah Hernandez,
[03:44:15.340 --> 03:44:18.340]  how many people have just been put on a launch pad
[03:44:18.340 --> 03:44:21.340]  to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[03:44:21.340 --> 03:44:23.340]  I've been given so many opportunities
[03:44:23.340 --> 03:44:26.340]  because of this man and because of this platform,
[03:44:26.340 --> 03:44:29.340]  and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now
[03:44:29.340 --> 03:44:30.340]  if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[03:44:30.340 --> 03:44:32.340]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts
[03:44:32.340 --> 03:44:34.340]  with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass,
[03:44:34.340 --> 03:44:36.340]  the super Tim Cass IRL.
[03:44:36.340 --> 03:44:39.340]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones
[03:44:39.340 --> 03:44:41.340]  and band.video for granted,
[03:44:41.340 --> 03:44:44.340]  because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[03:44:44.340 --> 03:44:47.340]  We need to support free speech systems right now,
[03:44:47.340 --> 03:44:49.340]  so go check out the store, go support their store,
[03:44:49.340 --> 03:44:52.340]  go support InfoWars, leave a donation right now.
[03:44:52.340 --> 03:45:21.340]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[03:45:23.340 --> 03:45:25.340]  This is a game changer.
[03:45:25.340 --> 03:45:27.340]  We're so excited about it.
[03:45:27.340 --> 03:45:29.340]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[03:45:29.340 --> 03:45:31.340]  We couldn't afford it before,
[03:45:31.340 --> 03:45:33.340]  but by moving to a bigger national distributor,
[03:45:33.340 --> 03:45:34.340]  we're able to do it.
[03:45:34.340 --> 03:45:37.340]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster,
[03:45:37.340 --> 03:45:39.340]  the same great customer service and more.

[03:45:46.340 --> 03:45:48.340]  I want to thank you all for your support,
[03:45:48.340 --> 03:45:50.340]  but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system,
[03:45:50.340 --> 03:45:52.340]  leave a health of your life,
[03:45:52.340 --> 03:45:56.340]  and keep InfoWars on the air, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:56.340 --> 03:45:58.340]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[03:45:58.340 --> 03:46:01.340]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors
[03:46:01.340 --> 03:46:03.340]  and the healthcare system.
[03:46:03.340 --> 03:46:05.340]  There's a solution, the wellness company.
[03:46:05.340 --> 03:46:06.340]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough,
[03:46:06.340 --> 03:46:08.340]  and I'm the chief scientific officer,
[03:46:08.340 --> 03:46:11.340]  and I can tell you firsthand that these verticals
[03:46:11.340 --> 03:46:14.340]  of uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[03:46:14.340 --> 03:46:17.340]  doctors on demand, prescriptions through a network
[03:46:17.340 --> 03:46:21.340]  of community pharmacies, in-home, in-vitro diagnostics,
[03:46:21.340 --> 03:46:24.340]  laboratory testing, imaging.
[03:46:24.340 --> 03:46:28.340]  An online set of holistic products can help guide you
[03:46:28.340 --> 03:46:30.340]  for your usual general medical care,
[03:46:30.340 --> 03:46:35.340]  but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes,
[03:46:35.340 --> 03:46:37.340]  vaccine injury syndromes,
[03:46:37.340 --> 03:46:41.340]  and the array of things that now America has to work through
[03:46:41.340 --> 03:46:44.340]  in this new world that we're living in.
[03:46:44.340 --> 03:46:47.340]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com
[03:46:47.340 --> 03:46:51.340]  and check out the wellness company for a low monthly fee.
[03:46:51.340 --> 03:47:19.340]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[03:47:19.340 --> 03:47:22.340]  So this Meghan Markle character is the funniest person
[03:47:22.340 --> 03:47:23.340]  I've ever witnessed.
[03:47:23.340 --> 03:47:24.340]  She's a pure actress.
[03:47:24.340 --> 03:47:26.340]  She's acting all the time.
[03:47:26.340 --> 03:47:29.340]  She's crying in the Netflix trailer.
[03:47:29.340 --> 03:47:31.340]  I mean, you should go and see the clip about,
[03:47:31.340 --> 03:47:34.340]  she talks about meeting the queen, right?
[03:47:34.340 --> 03:47:36.340]  Not expecting to meet the queen.
[03:47:36.340 --> 03:47:39.340]  And then when Prince Harrier's husband tells her
[03:47:39.340 --> 03:47:42.340]  that she's going to have to curtsy when she meets the queen.
[03:47:42.340 --> 03:47:44.340]  Now, obviously, I get it.
[03:47:44.340 --> 03:47:45.340]  Curtsying is stupid.
[03:47:45.340 --> 03:47:46.340]  It's ridiculous.
[03:47:46.340 --> 03:47:51.340]  But she claimed she didn't know she had to do that
[03:47:51.340 --> 03:47:53.340]  and she thought it was a joke that it didn't even exist.
[03:47:53.340 --> 03:47:57.340]  How stupid do you have to be to not know
[03:47:57.340 --> 03:48:00.340]  that when you meet the queen as a woman, you curtsy?
[03:48:00.340 --> 03:48:02.340]  Yeah, I think it's silly.
[03:48:02.340 --> 03:48:04.340]  But that's just the tradition, isn't it?
[03:48:04.340 --> 03:48:06.340]  She didn't even know it existed.
[03:48:06.340 --> 03:48:08.340]  She thought it was a joke.
[03:48:08.340 --> 03:48:11.340]  And so she does this overly dramatic curtsy
[03:48:11.340 --> 03:48:13.340]  and you'll see it in the clip.
[03:48:13.340 --> 03:48:15.340]  I've tweeted about it if you want to go and see it.
[03:48:15.340 --> 03:48:19.340]  And it's the most obnoxious, self-righteous crap
[03:48:19.340 --> 03:48:20.340]  that you can imagine.
[03:48:20.340 --> 03:48:25.340]  Where she's overly dramatically doing this massive curtsy
[03:48:25.340 --> 03:48:29.340]  as if she's in a Game of Thrones episode or whatever.
[03:48:29.340 --> 03:48:31.340]  It's absolutely incredible.
[03:48:31.340 --> 03:48:36.340]  Narcissistic, egomaniacal scumbags
[03:48:36.340 --> 03:48:39.340]  who left the royal family of their own accord
[03:48:39.340 --> 03:48:42.340]  but then constantly attack the royal family
[03:48:42.340 --> 03:48:44.340]  at every available opportunity
[03:48:44.340 --> 03:48:46.340]  because it defines their entire existence.
[03:48:46.340 --> 03:48:49.340]  Because they're given $100 million
[03:48:49.340 --> 03:48:52.340]  by Netflix for this docuseries
[03:48:52.340 --> 03:48:54.340]  which contains intimate details,
[03:48:54.340 --> 03:48:57.340]  photographs, videos of their private life
[03:48:57.340 --> 03:48:59.340]  while simultaneously they're constantly
[03:48:59.340 --> 03:49:03.340]  whinging about people invading their privacy.
[03:49:03.340 --> 03:49:05.340]  They're talking about intimate details
[03:49:05.340 --> 03:49:08.340]  of Prince William and Kate Middleton's relationship
[03:49:08.340 --> 03:49:10.340]  in this docuseries
[03:49:10.340 --> 03:49:13.340]  while whining about their privacy being invaded.
[03:49:13.340 --> 03:49:17.340]  And then claiming that the Queen is the head of white supremacy
[03:49:17.340 --> 03:49:22.340]  and trotting out these far-left extremist woke academics
[03:49:22.340 --> 03:49:24.340]  to blame Britain for slavery
[03:49:24.340 --> 03:49:26.340]  when we were the first country to end it,
[03:49:26.340 --> 03:49:30.340]  when Brits risked their lives to go abroad to end it.
[03:49:30.340 --> 03:49:34.340]  It still exists in non-white countries to this day.
[03:49:34.340 --> 03:49:38.340]  They've got nothing whatsoever to say about that.
[03:49:38.340 --> 03:49:41.340]  The woke academic, this is bright part,
[03:49:41.340 --> 03:49:43.340]  the woke academics appearances in the series
[03:49:43.340 --> 03:49:45.340]  so far have been brief compared to that
[03:49:45.340 --> 03:49:48.340]  of the much more heavily featured Afua Hirsch
[03:49:48.340 --> 03:49:51.340]  who previously called for Nelson's column
[03:49:51.340 --> 03:49:53.340]  in Trafalgar Square to be toppled
[03:49:53.340 --> 03:49:55.340]  and David Olasoga who appeared in court
[03:49:55.340 --> 03:49:58.340]  to help justify a mob destroying a historic statue
[03:49:58.340 --> 03:50:01.340]  during the Black Lives Matter unrest.
[03:50:01.340 --> 03:50:05.340]  So they've literally got these demented, far-left academics
[03:50:05.340 --> 03:50:07.340]  who want to hate, want to destroy Britain
[03:50:07.340 --> 03:50:09.340]  because they hate it.
[03:50:09.340 --> 03:50:12.340]  They're talking smack about the royal family
[03:50:12.340 --> 03:50:14.340]  because like it or not, it's a British institution.
[03:50:14.340 --> 03:50:16.340]  They want to bring it down.
[03:50:16.340 --> 03:50:18.340]  They're saying, oh, don't invade our privacy.
[03:50:18.340 --> 03:50:20.340]  Just leave us alone.
[03:50:20.340 --> 03:50:23.340]  We'll take $100 million from Netflix
[03:50:23.340 --> 03:50:28.340]  to literally have them play our intimate relationship diaries.
[03:50:28.340 --> 03:50:32.340]  It's absolutely incredible.
[03:50:32.340 --> 03:50:34.340]  Breitbart also reports,
[03:50:34.340 --> 03:50:36.340]  Palace hits back at Harry and Meghan.
[03:50:36.340 --> 03:50:38.340]  Netflix claims say they weren't asked to participate.
[03:50:38.340 --> 03:50:40.340]  So it's this common thing.
[03:50:40.340 --> 03:50:42.340]  It's like when the media does a hit piece against you,
[03:50:42.340 --> 03:50:44.340]  against someone on the right,
[03:50:44.340 --> 03:50:46.340]  they say, oh, we reached out for comment,
[03:50:46.340 --> 03:50:47.340]  but they never responded
[03:50:47.340 --> 03:50:49.340]  and they actually never reached out for comment.
[03:50:49.340 --> 03:50:51.340]  Or they reached out for comment
[03:50:51.340 --> 03:50:54.340]  two minutes before they published the article.
[03:50:54.340 --> 03:50:57.340]  Daily Mail sites are booking a palace source.
[03:50:57.340 --> 03:51:00.340]  Basically, they said this weird third-party company
[03:51:00.340 --> 03:51:02.340]  reached out and they didn't even know
[03:51:02.340 --> 03:51:04.340]  that it was legitimate.
[03:51:04.340 --> 03:51:07.340]  The royal family asked Netflix directly,
[03:51:07.340 --> 03:51:09.340]  is this legit?
[03:51:09.340 --> 03:51:11.340]  A day representing who they say they represent.
[03:51:11.340 --> 03:51:13.340]  Netflix didn't respond.
[03:51:13.340 --> 03:51:15.340]  So the royal family didn't respond.
[03:51:15.340 --> 03:51:17.340]  And then they get to say, oh, we told them
[03:51:17.340 --> 03:51:19.340]  about all these claims, but they didn't respond,
[03:51:19.340 --> 03:51:21.340]  implying that they have no response
[03:51:21.340 --> 03:51:23.340]  when in fact they weren't even properly asked.
[03:51:23.340 --> 03:51:26.340]  It's absolutely incredible.
[03:51:26.340 --> 03:51:28.340]  Let's get to these final two videos now, though,
[03:51:28.340 --> 03:51:30.340]  because Breitbart also reports,
[03:51:30.340 --> 03:51:32.340]  CNN Catastrophe viewership plummets
[03:51:32.340 --> 03:51:35.340]  to below $500,000.
[03:51:35.340 --> 03:51:37.340]  Fall FCNN's total day viewership
[03:51:37.340 --> 03:51:39.340]  averaged it below $500,000
[03:51:39.340 --> 03:51:41.340]  during the week of November 28th,
[03:51:41.340 --> 03:51:43.340]  and this is why I'll make the point over and over again.
[03:51:43.340 --> 03:51:46.340]  Propaganda now increasingly
[03:51:46.340 --> 03:51:48.340]  is not in current affairs shows.
[03:51:48.340 --> 03:51:51.340]  It's not in news broadcasts.
[03:51:51.340 --> 03:51:54.340]  It's in fictional TV shows,
[03:51:54.340 --> 03:51:56.340]  and especially it's in advertising,
[03:51:56.340 --> 03:51:58.340]  which brings us to our next video.
[03:51:58.340 --> 03:52:00.340]  This is called cringe washing.
[03:52:00.340 --> 03:52:02.340]  Let's roll it.
[03:52:02.340 --> 03:52:04.340]  I've found another brazen example
[03:52:04.340 --> 03:52:06.340]  of the message.
[03:52:06.340 --> 03:52:08.340]  Some of you may have seen the video on my main channel
[03:52:08.340 --> 03:52:10.340]  about social engineering woven into virtually
[03:52:10.340 --> 03:52:13.340]  every major Christmas TV commercial in the UK.
[03:52:13.340 --> 03:52:15.340]  Well, here's one that I missed.
[03:52:15.340 --> 03:52:17.340]  It's a particularly odious entry
[03:52:17.340 --> 03:52:20.340]  from UK retailer not on the high street.
[03:52:22.340 --> 03:52:25.340]  This is the only Six Pack U should be working on.
[03:52:25.340 --> 03:52:26.340]  Merry Christmas.
[03:52:26.340 --> 03:52:28.340]  Don't exercise, don't bother staying healthy.
[03:52:28.340 --> 03:52:31.340]  Issue self-discipline, embrace instant gratification,
[03:52:31.340 --> 03:52:34.340]  just spend the whole time getting drunk.
[03:52:34.340 --> 03:52:37.340]  OMG, what a year.
[03:52:37.340 --> 03:52:39.340]  Social media addiction is cool.
[03:52:39.340 --> 03:52:41.340]  Sod spending time with your family at Christmas,
[03:52:41.340 --> 03:52:44.340]  just spend even more time on your phone.
[03:52:44.340 --> 03:52:48.340]  Sorry, you have to share your special day with Jesus.
[03:52:48.340 --> 03:52:50.340]  Happy birthday.
[03:52:50.340 --> 03:52:52.340]  Bit of casual blasphemy.
[03:52:52.340 --> 03:52:56.340]  Sorry, your narcissistic moment has to be interrupted by Jesus.
[03:52:56.340 --> 03:52:58.340]  Here, eat some cake and get fat.
[03:52:58.340 --> 03:53:01.340]  Something for me to complete your Christmas party look.
[03:53:01.340 --> 03:53:02.340]  Stunning.
[03:53:02.340 --> 03:53:04.340]  Celebrate Christmas with gift ideas
[03:53:04.340 --> 03:53:06.340]  for all the people who matter in life.
[03:53:06.340 --> 03:53:08.340]  You didn't expect them to forget to pander to the alphabet,
[03:53:08.340 --> 03:53:09.340]  people, did you?
[03:53:09.340 --> 03:53:12.340]  A 30-second ad, and in every single instance,
[03:53:12.340 --> 03:53:15.340]  they invoke some version of the message.
[03:53:15.340 --> 03:53:17.340]  What is it about Christmas ads?
[03:53:17.340 --> 03:53:19.340]  It's like they get so angered at what Christmas
[03:53:19.340 --> 03:53:20.340]  is supposed to represent.
[03:53:20.340 --> 03:53:23.340]  Faith, family, tradition, wholesomeness, Jesus Christ,
[03:53:23.340 --> 03:53:25.340]  that not only do they have to sully it
[03:53:25.340 --> 03:53:27.340]  with appeals to vapid consumerism,
[03:53:27.340 --> 03:53:29.340]  but they have to snidely subvert the foundation
[03:53:29.340 --> 03:53:31.340]  of the entire thing.
[03:53:31.340 --> 03:53:33.340]  Unfortunately for Not On The High Street,
[03:53:33.340 --> 03:53:35.340]  they forgot to turn off the comments.
[03:53:35.340 --> 03:53:37.340]  In terms of degenerative art, this is why, Martia,
[03:53:37.340 --> 03:53:39.340]  imagine if you rephrased your advert too.
[03:53:39.340 --> 03:53:41.340]  Sorry, you have to share your special day
[03:53:41.340 --> 03:53:43.340]  with Eid Diwali Hanukkah.
[03:53:43.340 --> 03:53:46.340]  Obviously, Not On The High Street has a selective discriminative policy.
[03:53:46.340 --> 03:53:48.340]  Not On The High Street is not in my internet bookmarks anymore.
[03:53:48.340 --> 03:53:51.340]  This is the most disgusting Christmas advert I've ever seen.
[03:53:51.340 --> 03:53:53.340]  I know exactly where never to shop.
[03:53:53.340 --> 03:53:55.340]  The message!
[03:53:55.340 --> 03:53:59.340]  Yeah, seems like the message isn't being received very well.
[03:54:01.340 --> 03:54:03.340]  Now, the update on that is that not only did they
[03:54:03.340 --> 03:54:05.340]  remove the comments section, but they removed
[03:54:05.340 --> 03:54:07.340]  the video entirely off of YouTube,
[03:54:07.340 --> 03:54:10.340]  so maybe they weren't so proud of it in the end.
[03:54:10.340 --> 03:54:13.340]  Meanwhile, also in the UK, Strap A kills more children
[03:54:13.340 --> 03:54:15.340]  than COVID did in its first year.
[03:54:15.340 --> 03:54:18.340]  Basically, because they kept kids away from school,
[03:54:18.340 --> 03:54:20.340]  their immunity was completely exposed.
[03:54:20.340 --> 03:54:22.340]  They had no national immunity to everything,
[03:54:22.340 --> 03:54:25.340]  and now kids across the country are dying of Strap A.
[03:54:25.340 --> 03:54:28.340]  Professor Carl Hennigan said at some point,
[03:54:28.340 --> 03:54:30.340]  the immune deficit brought about by lockdowns
[03:54:30.340 --> 03:54:32.340]  has to be repaid.
[03:54:32.340 --> 03:54:35.340]  Of course, the solution, even though part of what caused this,
[03:54:35.340 --> 03:54:38.340]  is forcing kids to wear masks.
[03:54:38.340 --> 03:54:41.340]  Their immunity wasn't exposed to these kind of viruses,
[03:54:41.340 --> 03:54:43.340]  so they didn't build up any natural immunity.
[03:54:43.340 --> 03:54:46.340]  The solution is, guess what?
[03:54:46.340 --> 03:54:48.340]  To wear masks!
[03:54:48.340 --> 03:54:50.340]  Let's get to this final video now, though,
[03:54:50.340 --> 03:54:53.340]  on an important subject in terms of climate change,
[03:54:53.340 --> 03:54:55.340]  great reset agenda.
[03:54:55.340 --> 03:54:57.340]  This is called the war on farmers.
[03:54:57.340 --> 03:54:59.340]  Let's roll it.
[03:54:59.340 --> 03:55:01.340]  Well, you've seen the war on farmers in the Netherlands,
[03:55:01.340 --> 03:55:03.340]  and now our esteemed globalist technocrats
[03:55:03.340 --> 03:55:05.340]  are pulling the same stun in Germany.
[03:55:05.340 --> 03:55:07.340]  Farmers in Germany's most popular state,
[03:55:07.340 --> 03:55:09.340]  North Rhine-Westphalia,
[03:55:09.340 --> 03:55:12.340]  have been ordered to rein in the use of fertilizer.
[03:55:12.340 --> 03:55:14.340]  Green bureaucrats have told them to use
[03:55:14.340 --> 03:55:16.340]  20% less nitrate fertilizer in areas
[03:55:16.340 --> 03:55:19.340]  deemed to have problematic levels of the chemical.
[03:55:19.340 --> 03:55:21.340]  The demand is all part of the plan
[03:55:21.340 --> 03:55:23.340]  to make the industry more green.
[03:55:23.340 --> 03:55:25.340]  An inconvenient knock-on effect is that
[03:55:25.340 --> 03:55:27.340]  it will severely impact the amount of food
[03:55:27.340 --> 03:55:29.340]  they're allowed to grow.
[03:55:29.340 --> 03:55:31.340]  A wheat field requiring 200kg of fertilizer
[03:55:31.340 --> 03:55:33.340]  will now have to use 40kg less,
[03:55:33.340 --> 03:55:35.340]  meaning a drop in both the quantity
[03:55:35.340 --> 03:55:37.340]  and the quality of the wheat harvested.
[03:55:37.340 --> 03:55:39.340]  Technocrats in the region passed the rule
[03:55:39.340 --> 03:55:41.340]  right before Christmas,
[03:55:41.340 --> 03:55:43.340]  and then they all promptly buggered off on holiday,
[03:55:43.340 --> 03:55:45.340]  meaning no one can even challenge the mandate
[03:55:45.340 --> 03:55:47.340]  until next year.
[03:55:47.340 --> 03:55:49.340]  Similar with some local farmers and political officials,
[03:55:49.340 --> 03:55:51.340]  Eric Gossen, vice president of the
[03:55:51.340 --> 03:55:53.340]  Rhine-ish Agricultural Association,
[03:55:53.340 --> 03:55:55.340]  warned that the new regulations would mean
[03:55:55.340 --> 03:55:57.340]  a lower quality of crop, hinting farmers
[03:55:57.340 --> 03:55:59.340]  would not accept the rules without a fight.
[03:55:59.340 --> 03:56:01.340]  There is great indignation among the farmers,
[03:56:01.340 --> 03:56:03.340]  which really upsets, as he told German news outlet Build.
[03:56:03.340 --> 03:56:05.340]  The move is similar to what's already unfolding
[03:56:05.340 --> 03:56:07.340]  in the Netherlands, where the government
[03:56:07.340 --> 03:56:09.340]  is enforcing compulsory purchases
[03:56:09.340 --> 03:56:11.340]  of thousands of farms that don't meet
[03:56:11.340 --> 03:56:13.340]  environmental regulations.
[03:56:13.340 --> 03:56:15.340]  Those farms will then all be shut down.
[03:56:15.340 --> 03:56:17.340]  In a country which is second
[03:56:17.340 --> 03:56:19.340]  in terms of world exports of food,
[03:56:19.340 --> 03:56:21.340]  the measures have produced widespread
[03:56:21.340 --> 03:56:23.340]  sustained civil unrest.
[03:56:23.340 --> 03:56:25.340]  You can't allow farmers to farm.
[03:56:25.340 --> 03:56:27.340]  Are you mad? Letting the agriculture industry
[03:56:27.340 --> 03:56:29.340]  produce food? Can't have that.
[03:56:29.340 --> 03:56:31.340]  How are we going to control people
[03:56:31.340 --> 03:56:33.340]  and make them all dependent on us if we allow that to happen?
[03:56:33.340 --> 03:56:35.340]  I mean, it's for the planet right,
[03:56:35.340 --> 03:56:37.340]  so I guess both the Dutch and now Germans
[03:56:37.340 --> 03:56:39.340]  will just have to eat the bugs.
[03:56:39.340 --> 03:56:41.340]  It's only to save money, thanks to soaring
[03:56:41.340 --> 03:56:43.340]  inflation in Germany, which just hit a record high.
[03:56:43.340 --> 03:56:45.340]  One quarter of Germans can't even afford
[03:56:45.340 --> 03:56:47.340]  to buy Christmas presents for their kids this year.
[03:56:47.340 --> 03:56:49.340]  What's on the menu for Christmas dinner?
[03:56:49.340 --> 03:56:51.340]  Turkey, perhaps?
[03:56:51.340 --> 03:56:53.340]  A bit expensive, but don't worry.
[03:56:53.340 --> 03:56:55.340]  There are reasons to put insects on the Christmas menu.
[03:56:55.340 --> 03:56:57.340]  Mmm, lovely. What's for dessert?
[03:56:57.340 --> 03:56:59.340]  Edible mealworm in banoffee pie?
[03:56:59.340 --> 03:57:01.340]  I suddenly lost my appetite.
[03:57:01.340 --> 03:57:03.340]  Now, this isn't just in
[03:57:03.340 --> 03:57:05.340]  Holland or Germany. Now, the UK
[03:57:05.340 --> 03:57:07.340]  is facing a food supply crisis.
[03:57:07.340 --> 03:57:09.340]  We've got rationing on eggs in supermarkets,
[03:57:09.340 --> 03:57:11.340]  and again, it's largely
[03:57:11.340 --> 03:57:13.340]  because of these environmental restrictions
[03:57:13.340 --> 03:57:15.340]  that they're imposing on farmers
[03:57:15.340 --> 03:57:17.340]  with nitrogen fertilizer
[03:57:17.340 --> 03:57:19.340]  massively increasing in price.
[03:57:19.340 --> 03:57:21.340]  It's absolutely devastating
[03:57:21.340 --> 03:57:23.340]  the farming community.
[03:57:23.340 --> 03:57:25.340]  And now we're going to have food rationing
[03:57:25.340 --> 03:57:27.340]  and our food security is going to be
[03:57:27.340 --> 03:57:29.340]  off-shore to other countries
[03:57:29.340 --> 03:57:31.340]  exactly how they want it.
[03:57:31.340 --> 03:57:33.340]  They want you dependent.
[03:57:33.340 --> 03:57:35.340]  They don't want farmers producing cheap food.
[03:57:35.340 --> 03:57:37.340]  They don't want us to have access to cheap energy.
[03:57:37.340 --> 03:57:39.340]  It's all about the deliberate reduction.
[03:57:39.340 --> 03:57:41.340]  Of living standards, the great reset.
[03:57:41.340 --> 03:57:43.340]  We're going to wrap it up. War Room is next.
[03:57:43.340 --> 03:57:45.340]  Don't go away, Summit.
[03:57:45.340 --> 03:57:47.340]  It's hard to believe sometimes
[03:57:47.340 --> 03:57:49.340]  that we are still live on air
[03:57:49.340 --> 03:57:51.340]  broadcasting free worldwide.
[03:57:51.340 --> 03:57:53.340]  And it seems quite real
[03:57:53.340 --> 03:57:55.340]  that things can change in an instant.
[03:57:57.340 --> 03:57:59.340]  Things are getting very weird
[03:57:59.340 --> 03:58:01.340]  and it's definitely more difficult than ever
[03:58:01.340 --> 03:58:03.340]  to even know what's going on.
[03:58:03.340 --> 03:58:05.340]  But we'll keep doing our best
[03:58:05.340 --> 03:58:07.340]  so long as you keep us on the road.
[03:58:07.340 --> 03:58:09.340]  And you can do that now

[03:58:21.340 --> 03:58:23.340]  supplements available
