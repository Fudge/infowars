[00:00.000 --> 00:11.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.680 --> 00:19.240]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin
[00:19.240 --> 00:34.680]  texas alex jones analyst harry that's going to be joining us for about 30
[00:34.680 --> 00:40.080]  minutes in the second hour with breaking news on the world economy our
[00:40.080 --> 00:44.960]  story on info wars dot com is also on drugs report dot com economist financial
[00:44.960 --> 00:51.360]  collapse will cause civil unrest to erupt in america by 2016 rampant
[00:51.360 --> 00:58.200]  corruption combined with economic woes to spark revolution and don't forget
[00:58.200 --> 01:05.720]  yesterday's big story forbes writer at a press conference with the CDC head
[01:05.720 --> 01:14.600]  admitting that the media has agreed to cover up new Ebola cases sin sational just
[01:14.600 --> 01:17.680]  like they collectively cover up that the board patrol loads the illegals on
[01:17.680 --> 01:21.640]  buses gives them vouchers and ships and wherever they want to go men women and
[01:21.640 --> 01:26.200]  children we had to break that the reason I keep going back to that is it's an
[01:26.200 --> 01:32.080]  example of how they can cover up giant things going on just like the mystery
[01:32.080 --> 01:37.480]  illnesses respiratory illnesses last year and this year that killed three
[01:37.480 --> 01:40.720]  members of my family and are killing people all over the u.s. not just as
[01:40.720 --> 01:47.160]  virus out of South America there's almost no coverage of that I've got three
[01:47.160 --> 01:52.400]  people dead in my family that's what I'm saying we could have Ebola all over the
[01:52.400 --> 01:58.320]  place and they wouldn't tell us that's how controlled things have gotten because
[01:58.320 --> 02:02.440]  the public is so sheep like the news comes out here it comes out on drugs
[02:02.440 --> 02:06.720]  other places it comes out to millions of people millions are alike but the rest
[02:06.720 --> 02:11.880]  is and I'm not saying Ebola spreading everywhere what I'm saying is there have
[02:11.880 --> 02:15.000]  been ordered cover-ups of what appear to be new cases and people being
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.640]  disappeared and I know I just keep going back to that day because that's a big
[02:18.640 --> 02:23.600]  deal what if other people start just disappearing and nobody will talk about
[02:23.600 --> 02:31.720]  it I mean is this Guatemala is this South Africa 30 years ago is this
[02:31.720 --> 02:37.000]  Nazi Germany just the Soviet Union
[02:40.720 --> 02:48.600]  bizarre my friends very very bizarre times that we live in we're gonna keep
[02:48.600 --> 02:54.960]  looking at the post-mortem on Obama as a political God now being a political
[02:54.960 --> 03:00.560]  devil in many people's eyes and sure he's a front man in a puppet but just
[03:00.560 --> 03:04.600]  crediting the collectivist globalist agenda through their figurehead is quite
[03:04.600 --> 03:09.040]  useful so that's why we do continue to tear down Obama because much of his
[03:09.040 --> 03:13.760]  agenda still rolling forward like Obama here on the rest of it Mitch McConnell's
[03:13.760 --> 03:17.760]  gotten under a lot of fire the new Senate leader the incoming Senate leader
[03:17.760 --> 03:24.000]  from Kentucky the senior senator from Kentucky the state where Rand Paul
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.640]  hails from he's gotten in a lot of hot water with constituents there's not a
[03:28.640 --> 03:32.880]  lot of news coverage of it but it's there when he said day one Tuesday night
[03:32.880 --> 03:36.160]  and then Wednesday morning we're not gonna repeal Obamacare whole hog we
[03:36.160 --> 03:41.280]  might repeal some of it and the Democrats give them political cover and
[03:41.280 --> 03:44.880]  say repealing any of it kills it so he can declare a victory in full
[03:44.880 --> 03:48.200]  conservatives and people that don't want to suicide the country's economy and
[03:48.200 --> 03:53.040]  health care system well now I saw him in the news today going yes if I get 51
[03:53.040 --> 03:59.880]  votes we will repeal Obamacare Mitch McConnell faces diverse pressure on
[03:59.880 --> 04:06.160]  Obamacare repeal political reports rumors that Mitch McConnell's political
[04:06.160 --> 04:14.400]  genius are premature says the Atlantic yeah he is gonna be on his way out along
[04:14.400 --> 04:18.000]  with boner if they don't start just at least not driving the country over the
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.960]  edge of a cliff John Boehner Mitch McConnell vowed to kill Obamacare so
[04:21.960 --> 04:25.760]  they've now come out a little press conference and that's good that guys

[10:59.520 --> 11:05.480]  all this news today it is all so over the top there are bellwether stories that
[11:05.480 --> 11:10.800]  indicate where we are as a society just litmus test in my view or what I call
[11:10.800 --> 11:15.720]  Rosetta stones stories that then decode so much more and I've got a bunch of
[11:15.720 --> 11:24.160]  those today White House press laughs out loud at the press secretary's refusal to
[11:24.160 --> 11:30.960]  admit Dems lost or that losing is bad close quote they didn't lose and losing
[11:30.960 --> 11:34.640]  is not bad and then he said I'm not going to sit here with a bunch of punditry
[11:34.640 --> 11:41.200]  from you guys they said it's not that it's it's reality so so see saying
[11:41.200 --> 11:45.880]  punditry is saying that you're not a journalist you're just spouting off your
[11:45.880 --> 11:51.360]  opinion that's why I'm saying you're a conspiracy theorist we didn't lose we
[11:51.360 --> 11:56.200]  control reality are you smoking your own arrogant dope you don't control
[11:56.200 --> 12:05.920]  reality anymore and the same guy Josh Ernest he's one of the worst PR people
[12:05.920 --> 12:11.760]  I've ever seen worse than last two Carney and Gibbs went on Fox and said
[12:11.760 --> 12:18.600]  criticizing Obama not good for this country because Obama I guess used the
[12:18.600 --> 12:23.920]  country no criticizing and repudiating Obama is like sunshine to a vampire
[12:23.920 --> 12:28.560]  it's what the doctor ordered so they're trying to sell this idea that
[12:28.560 --> 12:32.280]  patriotism is getting in line and doing what you're told to the foreign
[12:32.280 --> 12:37.480]  special interest that run this country like a porta potty or something
[12:37.480 --> 12:43.800]  nobody's a dumping ground for toxic waste and GMO and bad debts we've bailed
[12:43.800 --> 12:53.160]  out the whole world's derivatives to the tune of two quadrillion now 2,000
[12:53.160 --> 13:00.040]  trillion look it up it was 1.6 quadrille five years ago it's now two
[13:00.040 --> 13:05.920]  quadrille we've signed on almost 70% of it and they tell us our problems the
[13:05.920 --> 13:11.320]  national debt 19 trillion oh it's an issue but nothing compared to all the
[13:11.320 --> 13:16.600]  fraudulent debt we've been signed on to so we're going to play that clip coming
[13:16.600 --> 13:19.960]  up of Josh Ernest telling Fox News criticizing Obama not good for the
[13:19.960 --> 13:24.760]  country I mean I have another clip of the press laughing at him that's kind of
[13:24.760 --> 13:27.800]  like laughing at the captain when you're on the deck of the Titanic you're on
[13:27.800 --> 13:32.720]  the same ship you're in the tree you're sitting in the same tree
[13:32.720 --> 13:40.760]  it's like in Scarface where they've killed the drug dealer that tried to
[13:40.760 --> 13:43.960]  kill Tony Montana and there's the corrupt cop in there with him and he goes
[13:43.960 --> 13:47.560]  yeah you got out of control Tony I'm glad you don't with him and he said oh
[13:47.560 --> 13:57.040]  you you messed up too now you're signed on to this too the press is in the same
[13:57.040 --> 14:02.720]  group you're signed on to don't don't don't try to laugh at this now when they
[14:02.720 --> 14:07.120]  try to control reality and tell you they didn't lose the election it's too late
[14:07.120 --> 14:17.680]  for you and see that story dovetails with the Mint Press news and a Breitbart
[14:17.680 --> 14:26.840]  story weather channel morning show beats CNN and MSNBC dish drops CNN the
[14:26.840 --> 14:34.920]  world is changing and some people are going to change with it dish network
[14:34.920 --> 14:41.240]  chairman Charlie Ergen was in rare form today and he goes on to say that no one
[14:41.240 --> 14:45.000]  watches CNN anymore and that they don't even need them for election coverage
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.360]  anymore not quite the product they used to be you can imagine CNN down election
[14:50.360 --> 14:55.120]  night would have been a disaster 15 or 20 years ago now there are plenty of
[14:55.120 --> 14:59.560]  places for people to get their news the industry is changing there are about 10
[14:59.560 --> 15:03.800]  big programming groups I don't anticipate the cable companies satellite
[15:03.800 --> 15:09.680]  companies and phone companies are going to carry the same 10 groups and so that's
[15:09.680 --> 15:16.960]  it CNN being dropped by a dish network and so it begins CNN is already dead on
[15:16.960 --> 15:21.760]  arrival they were dead years ago I made that announcement two years ago when I
[15:21.760 --> 15:26.380]  was on Pierce Morgan I'd been in those very studios three other times and they
[15:26.380 --> 15:30.200]  were glistening clean people were arrogant running around with energy and
[15:30.200 --> 15:34.080]  news coverage even though it was staged and manipulated the next time I was
[15:34.080 --> 15:39.640]  there it felt like a tomb they were demoralized they had no momentum they
[15:39.640 --> 15:43.440]  know they work for the globalist they know their traders to America they know
[15:43.440 --> 15:48.600]  they're being told what to do by the White House they know they were a
[15:48.600 --> 15:56.320]  coffin that just hadn't been slid into the hole yet CNN is gone MSNBC is gone
[15:56.320 --> 16:04.020]  they are vestigial propped up edifices but that's all they are is the
[16:04.020 --> 16:13.680]  skeletal remains they're done so there you go we're gonna be getting into those
[16:13.680 --> 16:22.320]  reports as well obviously I'm gonna get into the economy top economists as
[16:22.320 --> 16:28.440]  financial collapse will cause civil unrest to erupt in America by 2016 Harry
[16:28.440 --> 16:32.520]  Dent was on I wanted to talk about this but then he had a family emergency he'll
[16:32.520 --> 16:36.560]  be on Sunday or Monday so we'll just have open phones we do have an Ebola doctor
[16:36.560 --> 16:40.080]  joining us who's been in Africa and covered it with some of the real
[16:40.080 --> 16:43.800]  treatments that are working popping in the last 30 minutes this ties in this
[16:43.800 --> 16:47.160]  economist financial collapse will cause civil unrest to erupt in America by
[16:47.160 --> 16:52.280]  2016 Singer Elliott says US growth optimism unwarranted is data-cooked
[16:52.280 --> 17:00.440]  and says we live in a quote fake economy completely fake and that there's
[17:00.440 --> 17:07.080]  going to be a deep crash close quote former ECB head bullied Ireland into
[17:07.080 --> 17:12.040]  bailout that is shining on to the EU's bailout Trichette held a loaded gun to
[17:12.040 --> 17:15.800]  their heads close quote by the way who do you think owns the Federal Reserve
[17:15.800 --> 17:21.640]  same folks on the IMF World Bank mainly British and German and Dutch banks and
[17:21.640 --> 17:26.760]  they finance US robber barons in the 1850s right through the 1920s and they
[17:26.760 --> 17:31.320]  run this country into the ground by the way they're the ones that got Obamacare
[17:31.320 --> 17:36.320]  passed that is a huge tax increase some estimate that will bring in more money
[17:36.320 --> 17:42.760]  than the income tax every year to private insurance companies that's why
[17:42.760 --> 17:47.200]  Mitch McConnell and then boner over there don't want to repeal it because
[17:47.200 --> 17:52.360]  hardcore global mafia wrote that stinker double triple your prices and kill
[17:52.360 --> 17:57.680]  grandma and put the VA troops on death list I mean you can be 30 years old
[17:57.680 --> 18:01.120]  need an arm you're not getting one you're getting a cane you need a leg
[18:01.120 --> 18:03.720]  you're getting a cane you need knee surgery you need heart surgery you're
[18:03.720 --> 18:07.680]  50 years old you ain't getting it you're on a death list here's some pills go
[18:07.680 --> 18:14.600]  home and die but that's okay because there's lots of PR about how great our
[18:14.600 --> 18:18.880]  military is and how much the government loves you I was watching I was in the
[18:18.880 --> 18:23.440]  gym this morning I had like seven TVs on them or eight TVs that I could see and I
[18:23.440 --> 18:27.800]  noticed at the same time on three different morning shows the big
[18:27.800 --> 18:32.400]  national morning shows once two channels at the same time and then later on the
[18:32.400 --> 18:36.960]  other channel they were promoting the Navy and talking to people on ships
[18:36.960 --> 18:44.200]  because the Navy's has horrible morale right now just collapse level events are
[18:44.200 --> 18:48.880]  happening by design long-term but but it's it's collapsing faster than they

[19:12.320 --> 19:17.160]  they went in and killed him that's why they court marshaled over 200 people on
[19:17.160 --> 19:21.800]  the ship who said that there was no body and no barrel at sea none of its real
[19:21.800 --> 19:28.800]  it's totally fake and now for Navy recruitment and to remind people that
[19:28.800 --> 19:34.480]  Obama supposedly had been lotten killed and that he had this big victory they
[19:34.480 --> 19:39.080]  announced this SEAL and the fitting on says you better not talk we're gonna come

[24:11.520 --> 24:14.640]  well mark that the other people the other thing that people have observed is
[24:14.640 --> 24:17.520]  that Republicans spent a whole lot of time in this last election criticizing
[24:17.520 --> 24:20.480]  the president now that may have worked for them politically I mean I think the
[24:20.480 --> 24:23.120]  numbers indicate that it might have at least in the short term but is that
[24:23.120 --> 24:25.960]  really good for the country I think what the voters really want is they want
[24:25.960 --> 24:29.720]  Democrats and Republicans in Washington DC to sit down and start looking for
[24:29.720 --> 24:32.160]  some common ground it doesn't mean they're gonna it doesn't mean they're
[24:32.160 --> 24:35.280]  gonna agree on everything right there are there are things the president's gonna do
[24:35.280 --> 24:40.520]  that that's the White House Press Secretary Josh Mr. Bologna Ernest they
[24:40.520 --> 24:44.200]  always just say the same talking point work together get stuff passed no we
[24:44.200 --> 24:48.480]  don't want more stuff passed like Obamacare and more gun grabbing and more
[24:48.480 --> 24:53.600]  open borders we want stuff reversed we want things repealed we want less
[24:53.600 --> 25:00.200]  government we want tax increases repealed we want violations of states
[25:00.200 --> 25:08.120]  rights repealed rollback no we don't want more well we want is repealed and
[25:08.120 --> 25:14.040]  the same Josh Ernest had the White House press corps laughing and groaning
[25:14.040 --> 25:18.960]  and disbelief here is that exchange when he basically implied that they had not
[25:18.960 --> 25:23.800]  lost the election here is the video and audio of that there are lots of people
[25:23.800 --> 25:28.640]  who who get paid a lot more money than I do who are responsible for offering up
[25:28.640 --> 25:32.480]  analysis and spending the elections and I'm not gonna do that I'll focus on here
[25:32.480 --> 25:36.480]  and what everybody here is focused on is figuring out what we can do to to work
[25:36.480 --> 25:40.080]  with Republicans and move the country forward and those are the lessons from
[25:40.080 --> 25:45.240]  the election and that's what we're here to talk about okay well I know that's
[25:45.240 --> 25:48.720]  that is the mentality of Washington DC I have to think that's the kind of
[25:48.720 --> 25:54.000]  mentality that voters aren't very happy about I'm saying it could be good for
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.880]  Democrats well no that's not what I'm saying I'm not gonna pass judgment on
[26:00.880 --> 26:10.060]  the it's fine it is it is I'm certainly disappointed in the
[26:10.060 --> 26:14.480]  outcome of the elections the president is to I think I said that earlier in my
[26:14.480 --> 26:18.960]  in response to your earlier question but if you want to understand the mentality
[26:18.960 --> 26:26.560]  it's a bunch of narcissistic swarmy nerdly mr. cool guys to think they're the
[26:26.560 --> 26:31.360]  smartest guy in the room and who watched the hangover five times a day these
[26:31.360 --> 26:35.960]  people guaranteed that guy's never been in a fist fight never been mugged never
[26:35.960 --> 26:40.760]  built a business never been in the military probably doesn't have kids I
[26:40.760 --> 26:47.920]  don't even know his bio just just isn't living in the real world probably never
[26:47.920 --> 26:54.440]  worked at a convenience store probably never had to fix his tire on the side
[26:54.440 --> 27:00.400]  of the road they're so disconnected and arrogant and in their own world that
[27:00.400 --> 27:06.400]  they're such big winners and people are rejecting Obamacare and fast and furious
[27:06.400 --> 27:11.720]  and the wars and the Patriot Act being expanded and the NDAA to secretly arrest
[27:11.720 --> 27:15.560]  Americans and all the rest of the corruption and saying we didn't build
[27:15.560 --> 27:20.880]  our businesses and the tax increases that's what we're rejecting not that
[27:20.880 --> 27:25.480]  Republicans didn't work with the Democrats the Republicans passed Obamacare
[27:25.480 --> 27:31.520]  with them the Republicans are going along with arming Isis and then fighting
[27:31.520 --> 27:35.680]  Isis the Republican leadership is part of the problem and that's what the Tea
[27:35.680 --> 27:40.560]  Party saying we're not in love with our party like the Democrats are we're not in
[27:40.560 --> 27:47.200]  love with big government we just want to have some future this country is being
[27:47.200 --> 27:56.320]  wrecked right now I'm gonna get into the latest activity in the Middle East I'm
[27:56.320 --> 28:03.120]  gonna break down the fraud of this announcement concerning the shooting
[28:03.120 --> 28:06.840]  deaths of Osama bin Laden and if you believe that I'm gonna tell you about
[28:06.840 --> 28:13.040]  a leprechaun I met last week who was riding a magical pony unicorn on his
[28:13.040 --> 28:18.000]  way to buy magic beans to grow a beanstalk up to the International Space
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.680]  Station and of course at the International Space Station there are
[28:22.680 --> 28:31.640]  Kebler elves riding unicycles while hanging out with little green men it is
[28:31.640 --> 28:37.040]  it is just total absolute fabricated baloney so we're gonna be looking at
[28:37.040 --> 28:39.920]  that and then in detail I'll actually read to the article
[28:39.920 --> 28:44.920]  Economist financial collapse will cause civil unrest to erupt in America by
[28:44.920 --> 28:50.400]  2016 rampant corruption combined with economic woes to spark her revolution
[28:50.400 --> 28:54.120]  and that's what the Ministry of Defense is saying in England that's what the
[28:54.120 --> 28:57.680]  Pentagon saying but they're saying they want to try to stop it once it starts
[28:57.680 --> 29:00.880]  which I don't want a bunch of burning cities and French Revolution garbage
[29:00.880 --> 29:05.040]  but the globalists have set that up where the type of revolution will have
[29:05.040 --> 29:09.080]  will be a failure with a bunch of welfare heads and socialist burning stuff
[29:09.080 --> 29:13.200]  and shooting police instead of the states taking back over and the federal
[29:13.200 --> 29:17.480]  government being returned to federal control not globalist control resting
[29:17.480 --> 29:23.040]  control away from the very combine that has been engineering worldwide not just
[29:23.040 --> 29:28.120]  domestically the climate of global revolution to bring in their world
[29:28.120 --> 29:32.760]  government it's mega robber Baron bankers using communist revolutionary
[29:32.760 --> 29:39.320]  tactics on the ground just as the best-selling book 1972 none dare call

[36:12.600 --> 36:17.160]  clearly a political realignment the numbers show that worst rounds in the
[36:17.160 --> 36:24.640]  Democrats have had since 1920 some estimates are since the 1830s this is
[36:24.640 --> 36:32.560]  unprecedented does that mean we'll get change if we force Boehner and other
[36:32.560 --> 36:37.880]  kleptocratic creatures like Mitch McConnell who's been up there stealing
[36:37.880 --> 36:42.880]  our freedoms supporting Obamacare that is stealing our money if we can route
[36:42.880 --> 36:47.040]  them now and put all this political pressure on them instead of letting them
[36:47.040 --> 36:52.720]  be turned into political celebrities we can really get this train going because
[36:52.720 --> 36:57.120]  as soon as the public sees results and as soon as they see victories they will
[36:57.120 --> 37:00.880]  get confidence see we never have victories they never let us have the
[37:00.880 --> 37:05.640]  smallest victory because they know the taste of victory is addictive it builds
[37:05.640 --> 37:11.280]  confidence but more and more we are seeing victories it is a victory that
[37:11.280 --> 37:16.760]  CNN has basically collapsed and they're just keeping it there to safe face it
[37:16.760 --> 37:20.360]  is a victory that MSNBC has collapsed and they're just keeping it there to
[37:20.360 --> 37:25.080]  safe face this is being announced they're being dumped off cable systems off
[37:25.080 --> 37:34.960]  satellite systems they have the viewers at CNN of 590 a.m. one affiliate we have
[37:34.960 --> 37:40.080]  in Austin that in the ratings with their top shows has 200,000 listeners with
[37:40.080 --> 37:46.320]  George Norrie at night you can go read the Arbitron ratings he has in a five
[37:46.320 --> 37:55.200]  county area 200,000 people one station when we're on it because it's during the
[37:55.200 --> 38:01.080]  day there's a lot more competition out there we have upwards of 75,000 listeners
[38:01.080 --> 38:08.720]  on one affiliate CNN's average show has a hundred thousand viewers domestically
[38:08.720 --> 38:16.280]  you count international 300,000 100,000 it's a joke people that's what I
[38:16.280 --> 38:23.000]  keep telling you it's a joke and all we do is hire good reporters and researchers
[38:23.000 --> 38:30.080]  and writers build a fancy studio we're bigger than CNN it's over it's a joke the
[38:30.080 --> 38:35.520]  weather channel has more viewers than in CNN MSNBC combined
[38:35.520 --> 38:46.040]  major cable channels are being dumped CNN's been dumped by Dish that reaches
[38:46.040 --> 38:54.360]  what 500 million homes in North America Mexico the U.S. and Canada
[38:54.360 --> 39:04.120]  four hundred something million bye bye bye bye dinosaur nothing's gonna put you
[39:04.120 --> 39:09.720]  back together again that's why I coined the term dinosaur media because what
[39:09.720 --> 39:18.440]  happened to dinosaurs they became extinct consumer affairs reports dish
[39:18.440 --> 39:25.280]  network dumps CNN other Turner channels bye bye
[39:26.200 --> 39:32.720]  bye bye that's what McLaughlin always says on PBS and the McLaughlin report
[39:32.720 --> 39:41.320]  bye bye and listen people know Sandy Hook was staged we don't know exactly how
[39:41.320 --> 39:47.160]  was staged but it's fake we've had the cops the state police the top school
[39:47.160 --> 39:53.160]  college experts you got kids in rings going in and out of an empty school you
[39:53.160 --> 39:58.160]  got blue screen with Anderson Cooper with his nose disappearing and it's
[39:58.160 --> 40:01.320]  clearly blue screen where the flowers behind him blow and then blow the same
[40:01.320 --> 40:05.720]  way again it's a clip rolling they think you're so dumb they get up there and
[40:05.720 --> 40:14.560]  have fake newscast bye bye what are you gonna do declare martial law set some
[40:14.560 --> 40:20.400]  nukes off come kill me all that'll lose wake everybody up if you go after Ron
[40:20.400 --> 40:25.560]  Paul Rand Paul Alex Jones Matt Drudge Joseph Farrah I mean look at Tucker
[40:25.560 --> 40:30.480]  Carlson he's played the establishment fiddle but he's a smart guy he knows
[40:30.480 --> 40:33.760]  what's really going on we've hung out with him behind the scenes and so notice
[40:33.760 --> 40:36.960]  now he's talking like us because that's where the ratings are it's where the
[40:36.960 --> 40:41.800]  truth is it's where the success is see I've always explained everybody you've
[40:41.800 --> 40:47.360]  got to get ready to win we always have this attitude that we can't win and
[40:47.360 --> 40:50.680]  there's always going to be the New World Order and we have to fail and it's
[40:50.680 --> 40:54.280]  destined because they bought off the church is the last hundred years to run
[40:54.280 --> 40:59.920]  around and teach this doctrine of pre-tribulation rapture it isn't in there
[40:59.920 --> 41:05.120]  but regardless it's a giant cop-out to believe nothing bad's gonna ever happen
[41:05.120 --> 41:09.800]  to you because you've got your Christian snuggle toy where you go to the church
[41:09.800 --> 41:16.280]  and just sit there with some dandy preacher glitterbug with voodoo
[41:16.280 --> 41:20.200]  teachings about how you go give them money and pray to them basically and
[41:20.200 --> 41:24.640]  you're gonna have a perfect life with you know your wife's gonna have big blonde
[41:24.640 --> 41:29.840]  hair and big cap teeth and little twinkly eyes and the preacher's gonna
[41:29.840 --> 41:35.520]  strut around on the stage and talk about how God's gonna supersize you because
[41:35.520 --> 41:39.240]  you just stay here in the church and don't do nothing in the world and you're
[41:39.240 --> 41:42.880]  gonna be teleported out of here you're gonna have all these riches cuz you're
[41:42.880 --> 41:50.400]  just gonna bend over to the government you ever read the Bible nobody bends
[41:50.400 --> 41:57.800]  over they stand up against the evil in the government but you go watch these
[41:57.800 --> 42:00.640]  churches on TV it's the opposite because they're not churches they're
[42:00.640 --> 42:04.560]  government programmed government run groups and they're the next target
[42:04.560 --> 42:10.400]  because let me tell you something now that news is dying establishment news
[42:10.400 --> 42:15.000]  and there's a new rebirth a renaissance of new media they're targeting the dumb
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.840]  down that have just completely tuned out CNN and all of those places are going
[42:20.840 --> 42:24.240]  extinct are going to entertainment but the real propaganda is in the sports
[42:24.240 --> 42:29.000]  programming the entertainment programming the cartoons the books the
[42:29.000 --> 42:35.680]  magazines everything out there when I turn on ESPN or I turn on because I
[42:35.680 --> 42:40.160]  don't watch sports episode to analyze it of course might be a real good run or
[42:40.160 --> 42:43.600]  something I mean it's not like I hate football I hate the fact how its users
[42:43.600 --> 42:48.680]  a weapon to dumb people down and preach Obamacare and gun control and fire
[42:48.680 --> 42:52.280]  Hank Williams Jr. because he had free speech and said that you know he thought
[42:52.280 --> 42:58.400]  Obama was like Hitler Obama is like Hitler in a lot of ways a charismatic
[42:58.400 --> 43:02.320]  guy put up there by special interest who's creating a fascist system and
[43:02.320 --> 43:08.480]  calling it socialist yeah the Nazis were national socialists but they were
[43:08.480 --> 43:12.880]  really fascist that's what Nazi means is national socialist workers party
[43:12.880 --> 43:20.840]  basically in German so that's what's happening here is there is a lot of
[43:20.840 --> 43:25.160]  good stuff taking place it doesn't mean we're out of the woods by a long shot
[43:25.160 --> 43:29.360]  but we're coming from behind to use another ballgame analogy and people
[43:29.360 --> 43:34.000]  just have to get excited and be ready to start having some success because I'll
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.560]  tell you the average person in government the average high-level
[43:36.560 --> 43:40.520]  corporate chief the average high-level professor they just want to be more
[43:40.520 --> 43:44.720]  successful with their peers make more money to pay off their last two
[43:44.720 --> 43:51.560]  marriages and they really don't want to end productivity and prosperity they
[43:51.560 --> 43:56.680]  really just want to go to the Formula 1 race and pick up chicks they don't want
[43:56.680 --> 44:01.280]  to put cancer viruses in the vaccines they all know what's going on they all
[44:01.280 --> 44:04.960]  know about the agenda they go to these big board meetings why do you think they
[44:04.960 --> 44:10.200]  listen to my show it's the only place an elitist can tune in and actually get a
[44:10.200 --> 44:13.960]  report on what's going on not because they just believe I know what I'm
[44:13.960 --> 44:20.320]  talking about they know they know I know what I'm talking about and then you
[44:20.320 --> 44:24.960]  got all the fake liberal trendy intelligentsia I got invited to one of
[44:24.960 --> 44:28.800]  my friend's cocktail parties last night there's about a hundred people there and
[44:28.800 --> 44:34.400]  a few of them went is that Alex Jones over there and they were Democrats
[44:34.400 --> 44:41.720]  UT intelligentsia types and they left because I was there I mean why not come
[44:41.720 --> 44:46.440]  over and argue with me why not come over and make fun of me no they are in such a
[44:46.440 --> 44:53.280]  cult folks they left oh my gosh is that Alex Jones out on the balcony it is
[44:53.280 --> 44:58.240]  excuse me is that Alex Jones see it's a cult it's all like being back in junior
[44:58.240 --> 45:02.760]  high you're gonna let Jenny sit at your table at lunch we're not gonna sit here
[45:02.760 --> 45:06.840]  at your table anymore because Jenny wears a misfit shirt and we're good
[45:06.840 --> 45:09.600]  little cheerleaders
[45:09.600 --> 45:17.640]  what a group of freaks you think it made me feel bad that you left the party oh
[45:17.640 --> 45:23.800]  oh is is that Alex Jones over you you should want to go to parties where
[45:23.800 --> 45:26.440]  there are people that are interesting and that you don't agree with completely
[45:26.440 --> 45:34.440]  that's called a lively party a place where everybody agrees is called a cult
[45:34.440 --> 45:38.160]  a lot of times folks will say hey we're gonna have to dinner but you know my
[45:38.160 --> 45:42.120]  aunt wants to go but she doesn't really like you or agree with you you know she
[45:42.120 --> 45:46.240]  works for the Federal Reserve I went out to dinner with I said and it was
[45:46.240 --> 45:50.120]  another family relation I won't even say exactly this person I know and they
[45:50.120 --> 45:54.640]  actually are pretty high level in the Federal Reserve and we went out to two
[45:54.640 --> 45:56.920]  hour dinner at the end of it they said no we agree with you you're absolutely
[45:56.920 --> 46:00.520]  right and I've talked to these two directors the one in Dallas the one in
[46:00.520 --> 46:03.640]  Kansas City and they're aware of what's happening and they they don't want to
[46:03.640 --> 46:06.440]  wreck the economy and they say the policies of the New York Fed are doing
[46:06.440 --> 46:10.520]  that and this person I was at the dinner with with their family member was just
[46:10.520 --> 46:15.240]  blown away wow she really likes you and agrees with you I I can't believe this
[46:15.240 --> 46:20.840]  and she is high-level policy Federal Reserve because that they don't this
[46:20.840 --> 46:24.800]  person doesn't want to wreck America that's what I'm saying we have to be
[46:24.800 --> 46:32.840]  ready to win we have to be ready to realize we're selling snow cones in
[46:32.840 --> 46:43.560]  hell we're selling a lifeboat when the ship sunk we all share a commonality of
[46:43.560 --> 46:47.960]  wanting prosperity and freedom it's a very small group of transhumanist
[46:47.960 --> 46:52.280]  eugenicists less than one-tenth of one percent even most of six thousand
[46:52.280 --> 46:56.920]  superclass that Kissinger and others and Rothkopf write about aren't into this in
[46:56.920 --> 47:00.440]  fact they're freaked out most of them but they want their power so they play
[47:00.440 --> 47:11.240]  along with it but I certainly don't want our country to be converted over to a
[47:11.240 --> 47:15.840]  cult see the cult is so insulated they really believe that when they call you
[47:15.840 --> 47:19.880]  racist because you own guns you get scared and sad and go freak out with
[47:19.880 --> 47:23.320]  your tail between your legs or that when they call you racist because you don't
[47:23.320 --> 47:30.760]  support obama care you really get shook up and upset those people that left
[47:30.760 --> 47:36.680]  last night because they saw me at the party and I just popped by for like an
[47:36.680 --> 47:44.520]  hour because I was asked to go to it and it was close they really thought that
[47:44.520 --> 47:47.440]  would shake me up and the people of the party and they told folks they were
[47:47.440 --> 47:55.920]  leaving because I was there then I even heard about from somebody else this
[47:55.920 --> 48:01.400]  morning that's cult like behavior you're not in our group so we're gonna
[48:01.400 --> 48:07.880]  ostracize you because see that shows what prisoners they are they think when
[48:07.880 --> 48:12.960]  they say you're racist because you won't turn your guns in if they were told
[48:12.960 --> 48:16.120]  they were racist they would get in a fetal position and probably urinate on
[48:16.120 --> 48:20.640]  themselves so see they think we're like them so they sit up there Rachel Maddow
[48:20.640 --> 48:25.280]  and the rest of them like they're the king on the mountain pronouncing things
[48:25.280 --> 48:34.560]  and then it's the word of God or ex-cathedra spoken from the throne they
[48:34.560 --> 48:38.720]  say 2 plus 2 equals 5 and so it is so they say raising the debt doesn't raise
[48:38.720 --> 48:42.560]  the debt so it is so they say they're not coming after our guns even though
[48:42.560 --> 48:47.480]  they are so it's so they say they control reality you don't freaks don't
[48:47.480 --> 48:51.040]  you get it you use whatever credibility and power you had left in the
[48:51.040 --> 48:55.040]  dinosaur media to try to sell this for a period you promise everybody free
[48:55.040 --> 48:59.720]  lottery tickets basically everybody was gonna win it didn't deliver so you've
[48:59.720 --> 49:07.400]  completely collapsed all confidence in you is gone except for maybe 10% of
[49:07.400 --> 49:10.600]  hardcore cult members that have been given medium level positions in the
[49:10.600 --> 49:14.800]  power structure in universities and government corporations and banks who
[49:14.800 --> 49:20.560]  still think by being yes man you are part of the winning club know you're
[49:20.560 --> 49:27.640]  part of a group that's going extinct you're what we call dishonorable losers
[49:27.640 --> 49:33.720]  trendies but what happens when you go with the trend pretty soon whatever's
[49:33.720 --> 49:39.000]  trendy and cutting edge is what everybody's into you're not trendies at
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.800]  all your jokes your cult members who don't have identities and then you look
[49:44.800 --> 49:49.000]  at people like us who really study history who really know what we're
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.840]  talking about who are real liberals hardcore liberals who want human freedom
[49:54.840 --> 49:59.640]  human life valued dignity right to defense human empowerment fans of
[49:59.640 --> 50:05.520]  humanity fans of individuals fans of local community fans of decentralization
[50:05.520 --> 50:09.880]  fans of exploration fans of art and literature so many liberals will go

[54:52.800 --> 54:56.040]  designing a world where humans won't exist they're designing a world where we

[55:17.440 --> 55:26.520]  situation that was brought out to remind people that Obama supposedly took out
[55:26.520 --> 55:32.520]  bin Laden it was a PR stunt I've talked to the Navy SEAL families on air I've
[55:32.520 --> 55:38.360]  talked to the Navy SEALs off air they blew up the helicopter with 23 Navy SEALs
[55:38.360 --> 55:44.520]  on it to kill them I've had the families on they believe that we've had Navy SEALs
[55:44.520 --> 55:48.760]  on the show as well you understand that we have to do a special report for the
[55:48.760 --> 55:52.120]  nightly news I could air Sunday where we go back and get the families we've had
[55:52.120 --> 55:58.360]  on where they list the name and I was told that a week after it happened by a
[55:58.360 --> 56:02.720]  Navy SEAL who wasn't in SEAL Team 6 but had a friend in it that no it was a
[56:02.720 --> 56:06.360]  body double they killed and that then one of the helicopters blew up on the
[56:06.360 --> 56:11.600]  ground they thought it was a setup and that just things weren't right and then
[56:11.600 --> 56:15.880]  the next helicopter blew up that they packed 23 of them on but that was a hit
[56:15.880 --> 56:20.600]  and they flew them in and missiles were ready to shoot them down and I told you
[56:20.600 --> 56:25.920]  that first and years after I told you that well I'm gonna cover it in the
[56:25.920 --> 56:31.000]  next hour years after I told you that that came out in the niche that the
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.400]  families think that they were killed now why would you kill a bunch of Navy SEALs
[56:36.400 --> 56:40.960]  but oh notice the guy boy I tell you most the guys were on the raid they're all
[56:40.960 --> 56:46.560]  dead but the guy that shot bin Laden you know what he's doing just fine
[56:46.560 --> 56:55.560]  oh boy I tell you oh man but see now you're not saying Obama's a lie the raid
[56:55.560 --> 56:59.200]  didn't happen now it's are you saying a Navy SEALs lion they're trained to lie
[56:59.200 --> 57:03.920]  their Navy spook commandos folks
[57:04.560 --> 57:09.720]  deception's a large part of warfare don't be stupid out there and he's got a
[57:09.720 --> 57:16.800]  very dangerous job remember private Ryan she was told a lie that she the men
[57:16.800 --> 57:21.040]  cowered and feared and she killed dozens of Iraqis it turned out she was hiding
[57:21.040 --> 57:24.000]  under the bed when they got there at the hospital days after the Iraqis had
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.400]  pulled out and Jerry Brookheimer by satellite directed the special forces
[57:28.400 --> 57:33.080]  in the raid to save her that wasn't the BBC that was all Jerry Brookheimer
[57:33.080 --> 57:38.960]  production to get women to join the military you can pull up the articles
[57:38.960 --> 57:44.800]  it was men in the team in the resupply team that held off a bunch of Republican
[57:44.800 --> 57:49.360]  guard and killed a bunch of them she hid in the back of the truck but see in
[57:49.360 --> 57:55.360]  fantasy land oh and by the way four members of her team went public and
[57:55.360 --> 57:59.360]  said it was all a lie they were all killed in one week having a barbecue a
[57:59.360 --> 58:03.280]  guy in a black uniform and a mask pops up and double taps you in the head from
[58:03.280 --> 58:08.760]  40 yards in your backyard having a barbecue two shots dead double tap to

[58:19.040 --> 58:31.880]  then private Jessica Lynch was saying Ryan Jessica Lynch then came out and
[58:31.880 --> 58:36.080]  said oh it was all fake remember and then they didn't have to kill her that
[58:36.080 --> 58:38.920]  print me all those articles I'm gonna do a piece on it so I gotta get all my facts
[58:38.920 --> 58:43.080]  straight it's just all bulls stay with us

[1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:42.120]  first-time callers 800 259 92 31 I've already covered a lot in the last hour
[1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:47.200]  listeners I'd like to hear from you on what's happening in the economy on CNN
[1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:52.440]  and other mainstream media collapsing and major networks dropping their feeds
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:56.720]  we're gonna get back into that we're gonna look at American fighter jets
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:03.760]  carry out series of airstrikes against al-qaeda cell in Syria we're going to
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:08.440]  look at economists financial collapse will cause civil unrest to erupt in
[1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:14.760]  America by 2016 and how that ties in with America's upper middle class share
[1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:19.880]  of the wealth is the worst that every country besides Russia and Indonesia
[1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:23.200]  yeah they're just getting rid of the middle class entirely that is the main
[1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:27.400]  driver I know we know that but it is just outrageous that this is going on and
[1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:32.920]  once you get rid of a middle class they very rarely if ever come back so that's
[1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:38.040]  all coming up today as well I'm gonna drill into those articles in the next
[1:01:38.040 --> 1:01:43.360]  segment first off I'm going to just try to focus and put it all together in one
[1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:50.120]  spot see I hate to just start shooting my mouth off about the killing of bin
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:55.920]  Laden being fake without going and getting all the news articles all the
[1:01:55.920 --> 1:02:00.200]  documents all the names all the proof there's just so much of it makes my head
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:04.880]  spin I've had Navy SEALs on I've had their families on I've talked to Navy
[1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:11.000]  SEALs off record and I told everybody first they blow up the helicopter with
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:15.200]  a minute to get rid of the witnesses I told them it was a body double now we
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:21.040]  know the guy's name the family has released it here one of the families
[1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:28.600]  so just print me all those articles from 2013 2012 where I broke all that down
[1:02:28.600 --> 1:02:33.080]  and again I'm not up here bragging hey we were right first hey you know we have
[1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:40.080]  all the answers hey I don't like being the one talking to Navy SEAL families
[1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:44.400]  first and talking to Navy SEALs that are active duty you know any idea how
[1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:50.120]  dangerous that is when the entire PR plan of the president was based on it
[1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:56.000]  the only reason I'm still alive is God above but also your prayers and the
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:59.760]  fact there are so many good people in the military in the police in even in
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:05.360]  federal agencies that the bad guys that dominate these agencies at the top are
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:08.520]  afraid to do things that are too obvious because they might get caught and
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:11.680]  that's why it's good to repudiate Obama why it's good to indict some of these
[1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:16.000]  people it's good to get them on their heels so that more whistleblowers
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:21.320]  inside the system are able to expose what's happening like they better think
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:24.720]  twice about killing a bunch of Navy SEALs again 23 of them on that helicopter
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:27.320]  they go this is a weird mission we've not been given briefings or training we
[1:03:27.320 --> 1:03:31.080]  never do this we're being put on an Army helicopter and we're being sent out to an
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:35.320]  area you know what's going on and they show up and they're the missiles ready
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:37.880]  to shoot them down
[1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:45.680]  this is all pure bull in fact I want to get Pachinicon about this Navy SEAL
[1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:50.360]  announcement Sunday if he can do 30 minutes maybe at 5 o'clock get get
[1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:56.800]  Dr. Pachinicon who was on my show early in 2002 saying that have been lauding to
[1:03:56.800 --> 1:04:01.520]  die to Marfan's disease and kidney failure and then months later was in CBS
[1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:05.560]  news that he indeed had been at the American hospital in Dubai and was
[1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:10.240]  reportedly on death's doorstep and then it came out in foreign papers he died
[1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:17.520]  not commanding forces shadowy from a cave I mean and then they don't display
[1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:23.640]  his body and then they put out some fake photos it turns out of a wounded Navy
[1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:29.000]  SEAL they just stuck bin Laden's face on it and then they sigh up we tracked it
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:32.520]  back to the Pentagon leak that out to the military oh you're given the
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:37.320]  classified bin Laden so they could have the simulated victory of seeing a dead
[1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:40.840]  bin Laden but it wasn't even true and then all those given the fake intelligence
[1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:43.960]  don't want to admit it was wrong they were given it just becomes a lore a
[1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:49.360]  legend you don't get legend here you get real analysis real breakdown that

[1:08:57.240 --> 1:09:01.680]  same city in Texas where they're trying to arrest preachers and indict them for

[1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:33.840]  kill the culture of defend yourself that's why sheriffs and police chiefs
[1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:38.360]  all over the country including traditional democratic areas are saying
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:43.760]  buy guns defend yourself shoot robbers because if someone comes in your house
[1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:49.920]  97% I was actually looking at the numbers this morning of robbers do not
[1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:54.000]  want to rape or kill you that's why they rob you when your cars are gone when
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:57.720]  there's a pile of newspapers in front of the house and when the lights are off
[1:09:57.720 --> 1:10:03.960]  because they don't want to get killed but they're still in big cities thousands
[1:10:03.960 --> 1:10:09.840]  of robberies today small towns dozens in that 3% they are gonna rob your house
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:13.840]  and they want to kill you they want to rob it while you're there they want to
[1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:18.880]  rape you they want to torture you so if you're in your house and you look up and
[1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:23.840]  somebody's busting in or you look up and somebody's coming to that door and they
[1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:28.640]  know you're there they want to kill you in almost every case you better kill
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:40.080]  them as fast as you can now I was back on August 6 2011 just a few months after
[1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:46.800]  the so-called bin Laden raid that he was supposedly killed in and Santa Claus on
[1:10:46.800 --> 1:10:50.840]  December 25th comes down your chimney and you leave cookies and milk out for
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:53.760]  him it's not really mama doesn't really make him for daddy who's putting stuff
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:56.960]  under the tree it's actually a fat man fits down the chimney and comes from the
[1:10:56.960 --> 1:11:01.160]  North Pole they weren't going along with the fable they were talking to me and
[1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:05.000]  others and if I was talking to Navy SEALs and giving you the absolute intel
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:12.520]  that was proved correct day one you can believe that it was leaking out so they
[1:11:12.520 --> 1:11:16.960]  put 23 of them on a helicopter and blew it up but now oh a Navy SEALs come
[1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:23.160]  forward he lived he didn't get blown up and he killed bin Laden he slayed the
[1:11:23.160 --> 1:11:30.880]  dragon of course people are believing him a little bit more than Obama of course
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:34.960]  folks on the ship said there was no body so they had the most court-martialed ship
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:39.040]  in US history hundreds of court marshals last time I checked of the people
[1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:43.760]  that were on that ship when bin Laden supposedly got dumped in the drink and
[1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:47.280]  they didn't see Santa Claus come down the chimney they didn't even see a man in
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:51.320]  a red suit they didn't see Papa in a red suit they didn't even see him put a
[1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:55.880]  clown out there and dump in the ocean does anyone believe that and so they
[1:11:55.880 --> 1:11:58.760]  had to court-martial them all to dishonorably discharge them to shut them
[1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:02.920]  up I'm gonna do this because I always start telling the story and I want to
[1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:05.840]  get all my documents together I'm gonna do this at towards the end of the hour
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:09.880]  I'm gonna cover the Navy SEAL thing because I want to do it justice I don't
[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:13.840]  want to just sit up here and say it didn't happen I've got stacks of the articles
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:17.200]  here where the families came out and said it where we said it first where it
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:24.640]  was confirmed and now this this is pure PR for Obama to remind us that he killed
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:36.080]  bin Laden and he blow up the Death Star and he saved the Titanic we're gonna
[1:12:36.080 --> 1:12:40.440]  break that down and economists financial collapse will cause civil unrest to
[1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:44.240]  erupted America in 2016 and cause revolution that's what they're gearing
[1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:47.240]  up for so we're gonna give you the news behind the news the rest of story but
[1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:51.440]  first I do want to go to your calls in fact as I'm gonna do Navy SEAL stuff
[1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:58.080]  later it's like being a prosecutor who just has a slam dunk conviction here
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:02.160]  this is fake but I want to be able to put the evidence on that is a problem I
[1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:05.480]  have though because there's just so much evidence that I tend to not even get
[1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:09.480]  into stuff where I have too much evidence it's just so ridiculous I want to
[1:13:09.480 --> 1:13:14.200]  pull up the clips where we said at first two days after it happened that it was
[1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:18.320]  fake and that we said two days three days after they blow up the helicopter
[1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:21.800]  that it was fake and we talked to the sources and then exactly what we said
[1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:27.320]  they later went public I mean it's just sensationally evil this is all going on
[1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:34.320]  it's so crazy but first it sounds unbelievable but remember after the
[1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:38.400]  Aurora shooting the Democrats put out training videos for Democrat run
[1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:45.560]  companies in Colorado and then Homeland Security put out videos saying vomit or
[1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:51.680]  urinate on someone when they're trying to rape you or shoot you they also in
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:57.520]  one training video said something else I'm not gonna repeat but it's just
[1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:04.040]  ridiculous they said poop on people okay now let me tell you what's gonna
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:10.480]  happen if somebody comes in here to rob us or kill us let me tell you what's
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:19.880]  gonna happen biometric access 357 Magnum M4 right over there Reaper 308 in
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:24.120]  that office that's what's gonna happen you come in my house that's what's gonna
[1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:30.440]  happen I catch you in my house that's what's gonna happen you come in my
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:35.440]  house in almost every case though people that'll do that are intending harm if I
[1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:39.200]  pull up and catch you in my house I'll probably call the police I don't want a
[1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:42.420]  dead body to deal with and people that break in your house if you're gone
[1:14:42.420 --> 1:14:45.800]  usually don't mean harm though they could but if I if you come in when I'm
[1:14:45.800 --> 1:14:49.280]  there and the lights are on that means you want to kill me and tie me down and
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:56.240]  rape my family you're dead and that's not because I'm a tough guy you stick your
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:15:03.680]  hand down a badger hole he's gonna bite your fingers off you come in my nest my
[1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:10.680]  hole I'm gonna come after you just like a dog and there it is seen in college
[1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:14.160]  women told to urinate or vomit to deter our rapists well is there a five-day
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:19.120]  waiting period on that or is it a 28-day waiting period I mean I because
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:22.320]  there's other things there is a waiting period actually for some some forms of
[1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:29.080]  fluids I mean I'm not trying to be gross but you know vomit defecate urinate on
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:36.040]  people this this is the joke and now they say lay down and play dead that's
[1:15:36.040 --> 1:15:39.800]  exactly what they want you to do it's not like it's a grizzly bear that works
[1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:43.080]  most of the time with a grizzly bear because they usually don't like to eat
[1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:47.240]  humans but if you run then it triggers their prey response and they will try to
[1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:52.000]  eat you so yes laying down usually with a grizzly bear is the way to do it
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:57.240]  not with a predator it's a different creature not with a human coming in they
[1:15:57.240 --> 1:16:05.360]  want to rape you and telling women to lay down and play dead that is the worst
[1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:10.720]  advice I've studied the criminology any cop will tell you that let's go to the
[1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:16.680]  local newscast KTRK with a straight face a Disney affiliate so the headline is
[1:16:16.680 --> 1:16:21.960]  Disney tells women to lay down and be raped basically let's go ahead and go to
[1:16:21.960 --> 1:16:27.000]  this clip if you can get directly out of the house to a neighbors develop a
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:32.760]  family plan with a code word like danger danger why get the guns here it teach
[1:16:32.760 --> 1:16:37.440]  them to hide under their bed until you come get them that's where the training
[1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:40.520]  comes into play that this is a little safe zone for them they just need to stay
[1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:44.600]  there it was comfortable for them imagine listen to this guy's voice
[1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:47.640]  imagine being married to him as a woman would you feel and just a training
[1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:51.920]  area yeah man cuz somebody doing a home invasion never looks out of the bed for
[1:16:51.920 --> 1:16:58.560]  kids that's the first place someone looks a real plan would be have a room
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:04.360]  with a secured window and a heavier door to get to that has weapons it is smart
[1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:10.400]  if you can to retreat not me I'm charging I can't help it you are in my
[1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:17.520]  house you are dead and you're gonna die fast
[1:17:17.800 --> 1:17:22.240]  just go back to this guy's shimpering voice and nice little safe place for them
[1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:26.000]  and what you do when there's a mass shooting is you get in a fetal position
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:30.080]  you don't move because it's easier for the gunman to not have to aim let's go
[1:17:30.080 --> 1:17:33.320]  ahead and go to the tape get them that's where the training comes into play that
[1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:36.520]  this is a little safe zone for them they just say they'll create a little
[1:17:36.520 --> 1:17:40.960]  comfort level for them keep your cell phone and car keys with you at night
[1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:46.280]  you'll be ready to call police and your key fobs panic button can create a great
[1:17:46.280 --> 1:17:53.400]  distraction pepper spray and baseball bats can be good go-tos but any heavy
[1:17:53.400 --> 1:17:58.000]  object can help you if you decide to fight and finally if you come face to
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.680]  face with the bad guys and you're not prepared lie down don't look at them and
[1:18:02.680 --> 1:18:08.320]  pretend to have a heart attack or a breathing problem John says now is the
[1:18:08.320 --> 1:18:13.480]  time to plan for the worst I might have a heart attack as I jump for my gun so
[1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:21.240]  quick I don't know I get I would get so mad that I probably not even go for a
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:26.160]  gun oh man I tell you I mean coming in people's houses when they're there I
[1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:33.920]  mean breaking in somebody's house when they're not there it's horrible but breaking
[1:18:33.920 --> 1:18:37.320]  into somebody's house when they're there you better believe they're coming to
[1:18:37.320 --> 1:18:40.840]  kill you I'm because they know you got guns unless you're in Chicago New York or
[1:18:40.840 --> 1:18:44.960]  DC where they have crime rates off the charts home invasions off the charts and
[1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:49.400]  all these old ladies with like six seven locks just quaking fear and these
[1:18:49.400 --> 1:18:55.080]  thugs feed on them who was the famous guy that shot all the thugs on the train
[1:18:55.080 --> 1:18:59.280]  turns out he's a listener remember one time he called in made movies about it

[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:30.440]  the families think they were killed so the Navy SEALs to cover up the fact that
[1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:35.200]  they were really killing a body double and it was all staged but don't worry
[1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:42.760]  Robert O'Neill he's doing just fine and of course then we've got other Navy SEALs

[1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:54.280]  propaganda operations and that's what Dr. Petrinik and others have said here and
[1:24:54.280 --> 1:24:58.760]  that is what's going on this is a Navy recruitment driver saying and it's meant
[1:24:58.760 --> 1:25:03.720]  to make Obama look good and it's not true and I'm gonna break it down coming up
[1:25:03.720 --> 1:25:09.160]  let's go ahead I mean he may think he killed him but it was a body double I
[1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:13.720]  really don't think this guy's that dumb though hey O'Neill what happened to the
[1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:17.120]  other SEALs from the raid that you didn't get put on that mission on the
[1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:20.720]  helicopter because they say that there was a bomb on board and that missiles
[1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:29.960]  were just a distraction area they were decoys that we we broke that member of
[1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:33.040]  then later it all came out in the news that the families do indeed believe
[1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:36.840]  that you don't think I just made up I met with a Navy SEAL and that I met with
[1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:42.280]  families then I had them on later see it see we said it and then it came out
[1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:46.640]  see we're right it's fake I'm gonna do a whole special report on Natalie News
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:50.160]  tonight so I have it Sunday where I can show the clips of the families show me
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:54.520]  saying it first you know just show you the time and time again folks we're

[1:25:59.480 --> 1:26:07.400]  they don't like this there's the headline SEAL Team 6 murdered family
[1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:13.040]  speaks out 2013 a year after I broke it
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:18.200]  Charles Strange on the show the son died on that helicopter was part of the
[1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:24.920]  bin Laden raid names the name of the body double by the way I talked to the
[1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:31.160]  former head of Pakistani intelligence and he had concurred Hameed Ghoul nobody
[1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:37.560]  can get him on and I mean nobody he'll come on this show and it's two o'clock
[1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:40.920]  Pakistan time he ran the whole operation against the Russians with the CIA
[1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:46.680]  he says my analysis is a hundred percent on I'm not tooting our horn here we
[1:26:46.680 --> 1:26:51.080]  know what we're talking about is what I'm getting at here SEAL Team 6 families
[1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:54.480]  force Congress to investigate mysterious chopper crash okay I'm gonna get to it I
[1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:57.880]  have the tendency to cover it piecemeal let's talk to John Chadwick I wasn't
[1:26:57.880 --> 1:27:02.880]  gonna little John be just hung up a cool name Mike Tony Richard Nuthers John in
[1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:07.520]  Texas you're on the air thanks for calling hi Alex welcome one of the
[1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:10.040]  benefits I think we're gonna get out of this lecture I don't think we're gonna
[1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:14.200]  see any anti-gun bills coming out of Washington DC for fugitives anyway at
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:17.720]  least that's right almost every anti-gunner whether it was state local or
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:23.200]  federal was thrown out the biggest second amendment victory we've ever seen
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:29.760]  since 1776 and Texas is solidly pro-gun Greg Abbott said the other day if an
[1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:33.880]  open-carry bill reaches his death he'll sign it and Patrick he was in my
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:38.880]  concealed carry class my took my class for concealed carry license so we're
[1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:43.440]  pretty well set here in Texas too yeah and I know Abbott I know Patrick I mean
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:46.640]  I know these guys well I've been going on legislature for 20 years and they're
[1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:50.960]  all real guys I mean they're just really good guys and they'll be up there
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:55.040]  late at night even when it's not on their committee years ago battling gun
[1:27:55.040 --> 1:28:00.200]  grabber bills I mean they're all just the real deal and so we're really lucky
[1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:06.160]  to have them and that guy that claimed he killed bin Laden you know when Chris
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:10.960]  Kyle when when they realized that Jesse was going to take him to court he was
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:13.880]  going to lose me putting a liar which would have called his old book into
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:17.440]  question and been an embarrassment to all the people who lie nice him to the
[1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:21.800]  Hill they did away with a problem I wonder if that guy realizes he becomes
[1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:26.520]  an embarrassment he's gonna be around longer either well that's like private
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:30.360]  Lynch they killed four members of the survivors because they said that she
[1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:34.960]  cowered in fear they killed them in one week and then I said on air I don't know
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:39.000]  if she got the message but I said you better go public and say that this is
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:42.480]  all fake and they're gonna kill you like Pat Tillman and she went public said
[1:28:42.480 --> 1:28:47.160]  it's all fake I was told to lie
[1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:52.000]  Clint Eastwood's guy I see the previous Clint Eastwood that Kyle book he's made
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:55.720]  a movie with always don't be released in another another few weeks anyway that
[1:28:55.720 --> 1:29:00.200]  uh yeah and I'm not supposed to talk about it but Jesse Ventura's you know
[1:29:00.200 --> 1:29:06.920]  not putting up with it and he's already won the one lawsuit and and he knows
[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:10.520]  Clint Eastwood he likes Clint Eastwood I like Clint Eastwood but clearly this is
[1:29:10.520 --> 1:29:15.680]  a Navy propaganda film and the Navy is in trouble and I get they need PR I'm
[1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:23.840]  not against the Navy but it's all a hoax and I don't think Kyle got killed over
[1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:30.360]  just embarrassing the Navy craft for people that look like craft dress like
[1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:34.840]  craft like I even saw one of the guys that I saw in the Boston videos and
[1:29:34.840 --> 1:29:40.200]  photos at a pool and he saw me and then went into a restaurant and got up and
[1:29:40.200 --> 1:29:46.360]  left the pool by a restaurant just a few weeks ago I can't even get into it
[1:29:46.360 --> 1:29:50.920]  it's just too weird all right we'll be back we're on the March the Empire's on

[1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:41.240]  start of the next hour that we don't only played once the jacari Jackson also
[1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:45.800]  put together not just a great researcher and patriot and one of the host of
[1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:50.520]  m4's nightly news seven o'clock central but also a great video editor putting all
[1:36:50.520 --> 1:36:55.920]  that together jacari Jackson and his name school whose names cooler at the
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:04.200]  office jacari Jackson or Marcos Morales huh that's kind of behind the scenes is
[1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:08.080]  pretty good I like walk by and say their names to him like it's a voiceover
[1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:11.520]  announcement as you were saying of the new world order all just spontaneously
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:16.720]  combusted I could go do voice acting actually I've done a lot of big
[1:37:16.720 --> 1:37:22.160]  national voiceovers for movies and TV ads and financial ads but they always
[1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:26.560]  want you to fly to New York or LA to audition I almost always get the job
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:31.280]  and it pays quite well but it just it isn't exciting enough but it is
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:36.840]  pleasing to know that I could dominate voiceover industry and cartoons movies
[1:37:36.840 --> 1:37:44.200]  ads you name it being able to do hundreds of voices but that I refuse it to to do
[1:37:44.200 --> 1:37:48.040]  media and promote freedom I'm not bragging I'm just people always like
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:51.880]  yeah you'd like to be in Hollywood wouldn't you Alex no I've actually turned
[1:37:51.880 --> 1:38:00.600]  down quite a few big roles because I'm too busy I just isn't exciting I've been
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:04.920]  in a few pretty big movies enjoyed them they were shot locally patriots involved
[1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:10.200]  Rick link letter and Tommy Pallotta but after that they wanted me to be a you
[1:38:10.200 --> 1:38:14.360]  know in another production house play like a mid-sized role in a science
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:17.320]  fiction movie that did come out and I just said no I'm just I'm not going to
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:22.040]  come audition to that and I don't know why I'm just distracting off into side
[1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:26.280]  issues and I'm sounding like an egomaniac narcissist I'm not really I'm just
[1:38:26.280 --> 1:38:33.640]  actually saying I reject Hollywood I don't care everyone's God oh to be a
[1:38:33.640 --> 1:38:41.760]  movie star oh to have a hole in your head how boring been there done that seen it
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:46.720]  and so that's why I've been behind the facade behind the curtain and I know what
[1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:50.280]  a joke it is and then I get around politicos that are even low level to
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:54.640]  state level and they're on such power trips and arrogant or local reporters
[1:38:54.640 --> 1:39:00.120]  local reporters and local news anchors and local politicos are more arrogant
[1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:05.880]  than a list Hollywood stars they're like fantasizing it's it's all part of this
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:11.240]  trendy culture that they've arrived and it's like a three-year-old girl dressing
[1:39:11.240 --> 1:39:15.120]  up as a princess and imagining she's a queen or a three-year-old boy dressing
[1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:18.120]  up like Batman and running up and punching on the arm and you know
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:21.800]  believing their Hulk Hogan that's fine for a three-year-old for a five-year-old
[1:39:21.800 --> 1:39:32.320]  but it's fantasy land and so many Americans live in a fantasy land let's
[1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:35.240]  go to your phone calls I have been ranting and I'm out of control I've
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:38.880]  been ranting so much I didn't even plug I've got sponsors line up around the
[1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:42.840]  block wanting me to plug their great products most talk shows plug two times
[1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:48.440]  a segment not just the ads I do it maybe once an hour and I skip ads I skip
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:52.200]  breaks because I just don't care I just keep a ranting I have I don't know what
[1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:56.000]  you call it of the mouth but it must not be good let's go to Chadwick in
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:59.720]  Kentucky with some seriousness you say an Ebola survivor speaking at your
[1:39:59.720 --> 1:40:05.120]  church tonight tell me about that yeah I just want to say that the Ebola
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:08.360]  survivor is going to be coming here and talking with the big church tonight I
[1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:13.120]  know he's big on open border policy on keeping these guys coming in just need
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:17.480]  some marching orders on what we need to do when you hear tell us the name of the
[1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:23.520]  church and which one of the Obama bots quote survivors of Ebola he supposedly
[1:40:23.520 --> 1:40:30.680]  is it's a dr. Kent Bradley I think he's an actor but he's gonna be speaking at
[1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:36.080]  the southeast Christian church well I mean I think folks should go there and
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:41.120]  if they have questions and answers asking why top virologists are on record
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:49.640]  saying that Ebola patients shouldn't be brought to the US and or I would throw
[1:40:49.640 --> 1:40:53.840]  out do you know anything about the disappearances of people that show
[1:40:53.840 --> 1:41:00.080]  Ebola symptoms symptoms as reported by medical doctors on the Alex Jones show
[1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:07.840]  or doctor Forbes reported three days ago and you can cite the article it's an
[1:41:07.840 --> 1:41:13.240]  article that was linked on drugs yesterday that there's an ordered cover
[1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:18.360]  up of Ebola type patients and that the media is involved do you know anything
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:24.960]  about that cover-up and then the follow-up would be why are the default
[1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:30.040]  positions to not bring Ebola patients in and to let people who've treated Ebola
[1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:36.600]  patients travel why have the default protections been turned off that's the
[1:41:36.600 --> 1:41:42.120]  type of questions that I would raise and then be sure you videotape it
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:46.520]  separately bring a friend who can then ask a question when they're leaving or
[1:41:46.520 --> 1:41:51.240]  whatever and come up with a camera and say you know we've seen actors at Sandy
[1:41:51.240 --> 1:41:55.400]  Hook we've seen staged events before we've seen CNN with actors claiming they
[1:41:55.400 --> 1:42:02.040]  were under scut attack in 1991 we're here to ask you a very important question
[1:42:02.040 --> 1:42:06.920]  what do you say to the allegations that you're really an actor and never had
[1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:10.320]  Ebola and then get him to respond to that if that's the type of question you
[1:42:10.320 --> 1:42:13.920]  have because government's done stuff like this before I'm not saying he's an
[1:42:13.920 --> 1:42:17.720]  actor I don't know but something's fishy in this whole deal what are you
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:23.040]  planning to do well I mean I want to either do that and you know dress up in
[1:42:23.040 --> 1:42:28.040]  a hazmat suit and get him you know get some signs going out there but I mean
[1:42:28.040 --> 1:42:32.000]  we definitely to ask tough questions but I just think that he's there just to push
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:36.200]  the narrative on keeping the borders open and keeping public calm well that
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:39.320]  will make national news if you dress up in a hazmat suit with friends handing
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:44.600]  out flyers and then you put that on YouTube that you know Ebola survivor
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:50.960]  challenged or quote Ebola survivor challenged by citizens that is a
[1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:54.880]  sensational idea and a way to draw attention to the fact that they've
[1:42:54.880 --> 1:42:58.760]  turned off the Ebola defenses bare minimum I think that's a great idea see
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:03.560]  you you're smarter than me you're asking me what you should do you're smarter
[1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:07.720]  than me Chadwick and it's people like you start taking action nothing can stop
[1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:16.560]  you I think Cobra's in trouble Caldera alright thank you Chadwick very exciting
[1:43:16.560 --> 1:43:22.600]  and that is in the Louisville paper we trust but verify we checked into what
[1:43:22.600 --> 1:43:26.640]  the caller said Ebola survivor Kent Bradley to visit Louisville Louisville
[1:43:26.640 --> 1:43:32.880]  years ago Ebola survivor and medical missionary Dr. Kent Bradley attended the
[1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:36.200]  global mission health conference at Southwest Christian Church where he
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:42.560]  met some of his mentors connected with employer Samaritan's Purse and first
[1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:47.200]  learned about the missionary work in Liberia well he'll be there tonight
[1:43:47.200 --> 1:43:52.000]  speaking so yeah that's a good idea and he might be real he might have really
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:55.880]  had Ebola folks it's not that he's a bad guy it's that the government or such
[1:43:55.880 --> 1:44:06.640]  liars and Christian medical missions are probably the most infiltrated CIA
[1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:09.560]  fronts there are
[1:44:12.680 --> 1:44:18.240]  doctors without borders all these groups you can't swing a stick in the dark
[1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:26.320]  without hitting a operative in fact the desired operative in intelligence
[1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:30.920]  agencies not just here but all the world is a medical doctor just gonna let
[1:44:30.920 --> 1:44:36.520]  everybody in on a little secret it's not commandos it's not tough guys they
[1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:41.520]  it's doctors will newsflash for everybody in fact I've got to say that's
[1:44:41.520 --> 1:44:45.480]  probably the biggest group in intelligence is doctors pochetic Dr.
[1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:48.680]  Pochetic medical doctor will tell you that as well a lot of them are psychiatrists
[1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:54.200]  too he's a medical doctor and a psychiatrist and quite frankly I've
[1:44:54.200 --> 1:44:57.120]  been around some of these spooks man they are creepy because they're super
[1:44:57.120 --> 1:45:01.480]  smart and super weird Mike in Pennsylvania you're on the air go
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:06.160]  ahead welcome I just want to thank you for all the good
[1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:10.600]  products you put me out there to help help our families to these times here
[1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:15.240]  well we put out the very best we can the best researched but it also funds the
[1:45:15.240 --> 1:45:20.480]  operation so don't thank me thank you for supporting us sir not a problem sir
[1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:24.680]  I just want to bring you know everybody's always calling in and you know
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:31.200]  asking how we can help wake up other people across the country well with
[1:45:31.200 --> 1:45:37.680]  the situation now where the Republicans are one I think the government has put
[1:45:37.680 --> 1:45:44.920]  themselves in the situation now where if the Republicans do not reverse the
[1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:50.360]  actions Democrats have taken so I'll bring down this country they pretty much
[1:45:50.360 --> 1:45:55.920]  prove to the rest you know to the country that this whole thing's fraudulent I
[1:45:55.920 --> 1:46:00.760]  can't think of anything you know any better way you know it's like you always
[1:46:00.760 --> 1:46:08.840]  say okay evil will always come back in and basically hurt itself you know it's
[1:46:08.840 --> 1:46:13.360]  the good people just standing up in and you know we're out there
[1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:19.080]  wasting everything but at the same time it's their evil and their corruption
[1:46:19.080 --> 1:46:22.920]  they're going to bring themselves down through their own lives well that's
[1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:26.720]  right so many times in history evil oligarchies or evil power structures
[1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:31.000]  bring themselves down but somehow we've gotten this idea from the churches that
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:35.440]  corrupt governments invincible but that's not true or that it's always the
[1:46:35.440 --> 1:46:39.600]  end of the world so why should you get involved that's almost like the Hindus
[1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:44.880]  think you know hey you're gonna or the Buddhist I'm not knocking them think
[1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:48.040]  that you know you're just gonna come back in a few years anyways so why does
[1:46:48.040 --> 1:46:51.920]  it matter this is your lot in life it's almost like the Calvinists who say
[1:46:51.920 --> 1:46:55.920]  you're predestined well wait I have free will though how am I predestined I'm
[1:46:55.920 --> 1:46:59.040]  not picking a fight with the Hindus and the Calvinists or whatever but you know
[1:46:59.040 --> 1:47:04.280]  what my life is not predestined there is a track and a destiny God gives us all
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:09.240]  if we choose his plan or we can choose the devil's plan it's kind of like
[1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:13.880]  choose your own adventure books there's a basic direction you're going in
[1:47:13.880 --> 1:47:18.360]  there's fate there's providence but just to say that it's all predetermined is a
[1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:24.080]  total cop out and it is the creed of slaves and those living in squalor and
[1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:28.680]  I understand Calvinism is an elitist view well I'm a Christian so it must have
[1:47:28.680 --> 1:47:33.880]  been predestined I'm an elitist I'm chosen of God I'm special and it's true
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:38.480]  that God's providence runs through family lines it's true that God's
[1:47:38.480 --> 1:47:42.560]  providence runs over certain countries it's there but if you don't accept the
[1:47:42.560 --> 1:47:47.880]  providence and live by it you don't get it so I don't want to get into preaching
[1:47:47.880 --> 1:47:52.040]  here I don't need to go to all the seminaries and stuff I know what my
[1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:56.880]  spirit tells me and then it lines up with Christ teachings but our biggest
[1:47:56.880 --> 1:48:01.720]  problem are these devil run churches if you could spiritually see these big TV
[1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:05.800]  evangelist and these big mega churches in your town I'm telling you folks it is
[1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:12.280]  a horned tailed demon sitting up their bathroom mat in front of you I can feel
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:16.240]  it when I go on the churches and then the preaching starts I mean I feel more
[1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:21.240]  demonic energy there than I feel at a heavy metal concert I'm telling you
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:24.720]  folks because that's what the devil's really yet is at the church trying to
[1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:28.640]  take that over God bless you good to hear from you Richard in Texas you're up
[1:48:28.640 --> 1:48:39.200]  next thanks for holding okay Alex I'm on the air yep sure thanks for taking my
[1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:44.360]  call you bet brother okay so normally I don't like to travel outside of Texas
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:48.240]  but I'm planning a trip in the next couple of days to Canada and I've been
[1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:52.600]  researching their laws and what I can and can't take and what I found is that
[1:48:52.600 --> 1:48:56.840]  although their laws are very vague when you look at their actual legal
[1:48:56.840 --> 1:49:01.240]  opinions they basically state you can't take anything that you could use to
[1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:06.920]  defend yourself against the crown and that's sort of their idea is that there
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:14.680]  you know the crown is afraid of its own populace the crown yes you've read it
[1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:18.360]  and the governor general really runs Canada Canadians get upset by this but
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:21.560]  just like Australia the governor general threatened to override stuff
[1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:27.200]  Australia has gotten out from under it partially Canada has not and they've had
[1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:31.240]  the governor general shut down the legislature twice and so if you read
[1:49:31.240 --> 1:49:40.160]  the actual bylaws of England or of Canada the Parliament serves at the
[1:49:40.160 --> 1:49:44.760]  pleasure of Queenie and so you're absolutely right and they state in
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:47.960]  those bylaws that that's the reason they're they're having an abolition of
[1:49:47.960 --> 1:49:56.680]  weapons is because the rabble might be able to resist the crown the crown on a
[1:49:56.680 --> 1:50:03.080]  witch's head I mean what a joke a Transylvanian piece of trash I don't
[1:50:03.080 --> 1:50:06.440]  think it's Romanians or anything but I mean this is freaky that we have a
[1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:12.920]  Transylvanian crown of the of the line of Vlad the impaler count Dracula running
[1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:17.280]  things you can't make that up truth's really stranger than fiction I'm sorry
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:25.680]  go ahead I'm sorry go ahead now that's okay so my thoughts are that really when
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:29.080]  you look at the you know this recent vote in Washington state what it was
[1:50:29.080 --> 1:50:34.920]  initiative 594 I think that the left feels the same way I think that they
[1:50:34.920 --> 1:50:39.400]  feel that there's some sort of aristocracy and my my question to you is
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:45.200]  have you as your staff done any research into article one section one of the
[1:50:45.200 --> 1:50:48.880]  Texas Constitution that says that we're free and independent state absolutely
[1:50:48.880 --> 1:50:52.400]  where the Lone Star state we can pull out any time so can New Hampshire they
[1:50:52.400 --> 1:50:56.160]  have article 10 right to revolt Texas is not with a Lone Star state in that
[1:50:56.160 --> 1:51:00.240]  respect but we entered by treaty though I'm gonna come back and talk about you

[1:55:54.760 --> 1:55:59.640]  unrest and revolution yeah so the Pentagon all these British Ministry
[1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:05.320]  defense reports are saying total collapse by 2020 all the rest of it while the
[1:56:05.320 --> 1:56:09.080]  globalist engineer the collapse then the military is given the job of
[1:56:09.080 --> 1:56:13.040]  stabilization they're not really involved they're compartmentalized but
[1:56:13.040 --> 1:56:16.720]  they're given the job in collapse to bring in martial law which will look
[1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:19.880]  reasonable to them it'll look reasonable to me if you got people burning down
[1:56:19.880 --> 1:56:26.080]  cities but who triggered the climate and here it is info wars.com the
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:30.440]  stories also on drudgereport.com economists financial collapse will
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:36.760]  cause civil unrest to erupt in America by 2016 rampant corruption combined with
[1:56:36.760 --> 1:56:42.520]  economic woes to spark a revolution. Economist Martin Armstrong is predicting
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:47.200]  that's a very respected economist that rising resentment against the status
[1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:53.120]  quo as a result of economic inequity is likely to cause a serious political
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:58.080]  uprising before 2016 yeah that's what a lot of money's on but most of money's
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:02.400]  on 2020 it looks more and more like a serious political uprising will erupt
[1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:06.160]  2016 and they want to make it a leftist communist movement the globalist too we
[1:57:06.160 --> 1:57:10.040]  need to be a free market take over the states fix the problems peacefully point
[1:57:10.040 --> 1:57:12.840]  out those that won't work with this constitutionally and run them out of

[1:57:30.960 --> 1:57:34.920]  training is for this and the cops in military are smart enough to figure it
[1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:37.960]  out because none of this has happened yet why do they keep saying it's going
[1:57:37.960 --> 1:57:41.120]  to happen get ready because they're gonna false flag it they're gonna trigger
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:46.880]  it to then make it a socialist uprising burned down the cities and then
[1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:50.320]  separately they're gonna claim the right wing is attacking the police military

[2:00:22.720 --> 2:00:26.280]  do a special report next week really spent a lot of time on it then
[2:00:26.280 --> 2:00:31.960]  premiere it here on the radio about proof that the collapse is imminent and
[2:00:31.960 --> 2:00:36.160]  engineered and just show all the top economists internal reports declassified
[2:00:36.160 --> 2:00:42.320]  reports preparation for martial law to just decentralized and
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:47.360]  decompartmentalized the whole enchilada I mean I've done it here talking but
[2:00:47.360 --> 2:00:53.240]  folks need to see all the clips all the documents all the proof there's hundreds
[2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:58.480]  thousands of articles and documents as it's prepared but what you're not being
[2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:02.600]  told is it's an engineered collapse though that's in documents that are even
[2:01:02.600 --> 2:01:07.840]  more high-level that they're bringing in this planetary collapse that's what's
[2:01:07.840 --> 2:01:11.680]  clowered and pivoted into 21 and all of its about economists financial collapse
[2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:16.560]  will cost civil unrest to erupt in america by 2016 rampant corruption combined
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:20.440]  with economic woes to spark revolution economists Martin Armstrong very
[2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:24.640]  respected his predicament rising resentment against the status quo as a
[2:01:24.640 --> 2:01:28.760]  result of economic inequity is likely to cause serious political uprisings in
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:33.040]  2016 and they've been everything they can to turn the economy off it looks more
[2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:37.480]  and more like a serious political uprising will erupt in 2016 once the
[2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:42.360]  economy turns down that is the magic ingredient turn the economy down which
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:46.360]  they're doing now ending Qe3 and you get civil unrest and revolution rights
[2:01:46.360 --> 2:01:51.000]  Armstrong in making the forecast economists sites the case of 90 year
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:56.600]  old World War two veteran Arnold Abbott who I want to get on the show who is
[2:01:56.600 --> 2:02:00.520]  being targeted by authorities in Fort Lauderdale for defying a newly passed
[2:02:00.520 --> 2:02:04.680]  city ordinance that criminalizes feeding the homeless an example says Armstrong
[2:02:04.680 --> 2:02:09.920]  of how laws in the U.S. have simply gone nuts close quote yeah they have and
[2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:13.200]  again the cops are just enforcing unconstitutional laws everybody just
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:19.000]  blames them witchy quite frankly I wouldn't follow that order but then I'd
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  be fired well people should be firing the mayors and folks that you know
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:30.880]  there's it's always a nanny state well it's not safe are you bonded do you have
[2:02:30.880 --> 2:02:34.960]  a license to have served food I mean give me a break I'm not operating as a
[2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:38.640]  business or a corporation I could invite this homeless person in my house and
[2:02:38.640 --> 2:02:41.400]  give him soup oh no folks are doing that in places in
[2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:45.440]  Florida they're saying no you can't invite 10 people in fact you can't invite
[2:02:45.440 --> 2:02:49.280]  Jews Muslims Christians have been told all over the country but mainly
[2:02:49.280 --> 2:02:53.920]  Christians and Jews you can't invite more than three people in your house for
[2:02:53.920 --> 2:03:01.520]  a Bible study bull corny hotdog is one of my friends when I was a little kid one
[2:03:01.520 --> 2:03:07.080]  of my late friends he wasn't allowed to cuss because a bull corny hotdog it is
[2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:13.720]  total baloney and it's not freedom and it needs to stop but again just I'm not
[2:03:13.720 --> 2:03:19.000]  even defending the police on this just screaming at them though and saying why
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:24.800]  are you arresting him does nothing the law she's a total cop out change the law
[2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:30.400]  change the law we the people let government get out of control and now
[2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:35.240]  get to this point where World War two vets can't feed homeless and by the way
[2:03:35.240 --> 2:03:39.440]  a lot of homeless are drug addicts mentally ill whatever you can't really
[2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:43.240]  help them but there are more and more people out there that really have given
[2:03:43.240 --> 2:03:47.720]  up and are basically homeless living with their families and now they're trying
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:51.080]  to have zoning laws to stop that who folks should help these people that are
[2:03:51.080 --> 2:03:55.880]  out of work that need jobs because the government tried to make it more
[2:03:55.880 --> 2:04:03.680]  palatable and incentivize just going on welfare rather than going out and getting
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:07.280]  a job but what happens when you're mentally ill and then your welfare
[2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:12.040]  runs out well you end up sleeping on the street and then we've got all these
[2:04:12.040 --> 2:04:16.360]  organizations and groups that are these charities that don't want people cutting
[2:04:16.360 --> 2:04:20.480]  in on their business and they're the ones lobbying to not let private groups or
[2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:23.860]  individuals take care of the homeless and you're talking to somebody who
[2:04:23.860 --> 2:04:28.840]  isn't up here tootin my horn but I'll grow up at Christmas in the holidays and
[2:04:28.840 --> 2:04:33.960]  Thanksgiving you know we go down and salvation army meals on wheels loves and
[2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:39.360]  fishes everybody my family is involved in that every year basically just because
[2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:43.480]  that's what you're supposed to do well we're only a few steps away from that
[2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:48.040]  getting phased out then what are you gonna deal with so it's it's definitely

[2:08:17.800 --> 2:08:22.240]  character that really kind of captured the essence of that generation there's
[2:08:22.240 --> 2:08:26.440]  another analogy to be taken from Captain America and that is that that generation
[2:08:26.440 --> 2:08:31.240]  and America in general has essentially fallen asleep by Captain America dead as
[2:08:31.240 --> 2:08:35.360]  you see him wake up in the second Captain America movie to find that he's
[2:08:35.360 --> 2:08:40.080]  living in an authoritarian police state for a second day in a row a group of
[2:08:40.080 --> 2:08:43.920]  World War two vets literally took down a barrier blocking off the World War two
[2:08:43.920 --> 2:08:51.120]  Memorial in Washington DC while you seem pretty chipper is the one who just
[2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:56.120]  found out they died for nothing wow I go protect Iraq he's in Iraq and I come
[2:08:56.120 --> 2:09:00.760]  back and I find that my fellow Americans are being attacked by
[2:09:01.800 --> 2:09:12.040]  one once we're way ahead of the curve by holding a gun to everyone on earth
[2:09:12.040 --> 2:09:17.120]  and calling it protection the police and National Guard going street by street
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:21.760]  house-to-house instructions to disarm anyone inside
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:25.080]  we're gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen
[2:09:25.080 --> 2:09:28.880]  the punishment usually came after the crime and when they say I want my
[2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:34.000]  lawyer you tell them shut up your time to get a lawyer you're an enemy come
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:40.160]  back just did some nasty stuff yeah we compromised sometimes in ways that made
[2:09:40.160 --> 2:09:43.080]  us not sleep so well when I was in Afghanistan they usually kept us
[2:09:43.080 --> 2:09:46.000]  outside these buildings and the other government agency guys probably like
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:50.080]  DEA CIA and all that they would go into these kind of rooms like that exactly
[2:09:50.080 --> 2:09:54.040]  and they would be a torturing people from in there horrible scream to hear a
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:09:58.000]  grown person like that good being tortured you're watching as this opium is
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:01.760]  being grown we provide them security we're providing them resources and we're
[2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:06.800]  providing them alternatives Captain America is a fugitive from shield with
[2:10:06.800 --> 2:10:09.800]  all due respect if shield is conducting a manhunt for Captain America we deserve
[2:10:09.800 --> 2:10:12.960]  to know why you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that
[2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:17.640]  have the ability and the knowledge to to build IEDs and to defeat law
[2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:21.480]  enforcement techniques this is only gonna get worse once it starts and again
[2:10:21.480 --> 2:10:26.080]  there's no veterans doing anything right now no IEDs they are literally getting
[2:10:26.080 --> 2:10:33.120]  the police to pick a fight with veterans you are standing in my brain how did you
[2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:38.520]  get here in fight of this operation paperclip after World War two shield
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:44.320]  recruited German scientists strategic values I could have that cause operation
[2:10:44.320 --> 2:10:48.600]  paperclip explores the secret military program that hired scientists who use
[2:10:48.600 --> 2:10:53.880]  slave labor to build the v2 rocket others use concentration camp victims for
[2:10:53.880 --> 2:10:57.720]  human experiments the responsibility for the staggering loss of life and
[2:10:57.720 --> 2:11:01.960]  property is uniformly placed on Hitler and the Nazis but excluded from the
[2:11:01.960 --> 2:11:06.080]  official history is the fact that Hitler and the National Socialists would not
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:11.280]  have risen to power without the help of international bankers and American and
[2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:15.640]  German corporations she's disabling security protocols and dumping all the
[2:11:15.640 --> 2:11:19.160]  secrets under the internet including Hydra's and shields
[2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:22.160]  What about Bradley Manning? What about Bradley Manning?
[2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:30.760]  I think the revelations are terrible because they were they were revealed
[2:11:30.760 --> 2:11:37.680]  what's his name? Snowden. Yes, Snowden. I think he's a traitor. What about the others?
[2:11:37.680 --> 2:11:41.560]  Are you planning a rescue mission? You think about what is going on with the
[2:11:41.560 --> 2:11:45.280]  veterans administration the hospital and the fact that we have veterans that are
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:49.080]  dying because they're on a wait list you talk about Sergeant Tamarisi and his
[2:11:49.080 --> 2:12:00.360]  situation. Something that I've been upset about raising Kane about so I'm
[2:12:00.360 --> 2:12:06.680]  gonna ask you about it and that's this right-wing extremism report that was
[2:12:06.680 --> 2:12:10.320]  mailed out the law all law enforcement officials in the United States. I've
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:15.160]  apologized for that report it was not authorized to be distributed. This isn't
[2:12:15.160 --> 2:12:20.120]  freedom. This is freedom. Shield takes the world as it is not as we'd like it to be.
[2:12:20.120 --> 2:12:25.920]  This is getting damn near past time and you can get to look at that program carefully.
[2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:37.800]  Rallaging Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones and we
[2:12:37.800 --> 2:12:44.000]  are well into the third hour of worldwide broadcast. I can almost not
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:51.200]  continue the show at this point. I can eat habanero peppers raw. I can drink
[2:12:51.200 --> 2:12:56.120]  Tabasco sauce and jalapenos. I've been eating those since I was a kid but I
[2:12:56.120 --> 2:13:02.320]  just ate a jalapeno. I just eat them raw that had the magic touch or got mixed
[2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:08.280]  with some other type of pepper that can happen. My mouth is fire breathing right
[2:13:08.280 --> 2:13:18.240]  now. I think I've gone through three glasses of water. Man that's why I ran
[2:13:18.240 --> 2:13:23.360]  that long intro there was so that I could try to get my composure back. It's
[2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:28.480]  got to be good for you though. I want to go to your phone calls. We have an Ebola
[2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:37.760]  expert doctor on as well but right now I want to announce the winner of the
[2:13:37.760 --> 2:13:48.560]  Obama Ebola contest. Everyone who entered is a winner. This was done so that we
[2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:54.240]  could expose that there is a stand-down going on with the Ebola response in this
[2:13:54.240 --> 2:13:58.200]  country and clearly Forbes has now confirmed this. They are covering up
[2:13:58.200 --> 2:14:02.840]  what appears to be other Ebola cases in the country and it shows the amazing
[2:14:02.840 --> 2:14:06.200]  amount of control they've got over the media that we've been reporting this for
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:11.160]  weeks. Forbes reported it three days ago. DrudgeReport.com linked to our article
[2:14:11.160 --> 2:14:17.520]  about this yesterday. Good job Drudge. Thank you for being sane. Anyone with
[2:14:17.520 --> 2:14:22.360]  half a brain? If you've got medical doctors on this show and other medical
[2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:26.080]  doctors we've talked to naming hospitals where people that appear to have
[2:14:26.080 --> 2:14:32.680]  Ebola are being disappeared in vans with people in spacesuits that's illegal.
[2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:38.920]  Sure quarantine them but let us know. Don't lie about it and we know the
[2:14:38.920 --> 2:14:42.840]  disappearances are happening. We don't know they have Ebola and then Forbes
[2:14:42.840 --> 2:14:48.080]  writer who's a pharmacologist is at the meeting with the AP and everybody and
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:52.000]  they all talk in front of them. Yeah we've all agreed with the government not
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:58.040]  to tell folks about new Ebola cases. That is huge news even if Ebola is not a
[2:14:58.040 --> 2:15:05.280]  threat which I think it is. The level of control is simply amazing and so I want
[2:15:05.280 --> 2:15:11.080]  to go through the first three runners up. They will get a big info wars grab bag
[2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:19.200]  of t-shirts infowarslife.com supplements and more. Six five and four the runners
[2:15:19.200 --> 2:15:26.080]  up will all get that but the real win is just exposing tyranny and exposing the
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:30.400]  Ebola non-response and then we'll go in order the third place winner who gets
[2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:33.680]  five hundred bucks and a grab bag the second place winner that gets two
[2:15:33.680 --> 2:15:38.120]  thousand dollars in a grab bag and the first place winner who gets five thousand
[2:15:38.120 --> 2:15:42.040]  dollars and that's just to make it fun. The very successful contest all over
[2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:47.800]  national TV local TV newspapers reported on many of these winners. They're all
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:52.000]  amazing folks but the big thing is they got off the bench and got in the game so
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:57.560]  we salute everyone that entered the contest. We will post the top six runners
[2:15:57.560 --> 2:16:03.920]  up to infowars.com along with the top three winners but without further ado
[2:16:03.920 --> 2:16:12.680]  let's go to the audio and video of number six number six the first runner
[2:16:12.680 --> 2:16:22.400]  up here in the contest of the Ebola contest winners. Ebola goes digital by mad
[2:16:22.400 --> 2:16:33.400]  unicorn games. Hello America I'm Moses this is Noah and we're mad unicorn games and we

[2:16:57.360 --> 2:17:02.720]  number five Ebola visits skull and bones by as knowledge great job speaking out
[2:17:02.720 --> 2:17:08.760]  calling for more to be done to stop the Ebola at its point of origin. Here's the
[2:17:08.760 --> 2:17:14.720]  hard truth in West Africa Ebola is now an epidemic of the likes that we have not
[2:17:14.720 --> 2:17:20.880]  seen before it's spiraling out of control it is getting worse. He's had skull and
[2:17:20.880 --> 2:17:27.600]  bones. Today thousands of people in West Africa are infected. That number could
[2:17:27.600 --> 2:17:36.200]  rapidly go to tens of thousands. Alright number four spreading liberty in the
[2:17:36.200 --> 2:17:41.080]  den of criminals by Mona Hine great job posters or whatever like that and I'm

[2:17:45.920 --> 2:17:50.560]  everybody to see this it's just Ebola Obama hot flights from the hot zone now

[2:17:59.880 --> 2:18:04.040]  the end of the day if anything falls if everything goes down a hole at least I
[2:18:04.040 --> 2:18:11.200]  can say I fought for the good cause and I am the resistance. Number three this is
[2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:13.780]  third place
[2:18:14.040 --> 2:18:20.400]  the truth is viral by John Anonymous
[2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:39.560]  the truth is viral is third place number two second place Obama spreads Ebola

[2:19:05.360 --> 2:19:12.880]  going postal you've got Ebola mail by she fig morning it's about 10 after 10
[2:19:12.880 --> 2:19:21.360]  a.m. October 24th 2014 and I am in my mail truck and I'm about to start
[2:19:21.360 --> 2:19:28.680]  delivering here are all the stacks of the Obama fires that I made I made 550 of
[2:19:28.680 --> 2:19:36.440]  them to cover the entire route. This is the mail lady the mail woman delivering
[2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:41.080]  flyers but she paid for herself so it's legal.
[2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:51.080]  She's got a right to use the mail and get anybody else does. She wins $5,000 and again
[2:19:51.080 --> 2:19:54.800]  these videos are all on info wars.com. Congratulations to all who participated
[2:19:54.800 --> 2:20:00.880]  great job round of applause to everybody and you know I like this contest
[2:20:00.880 --> 2:20:05.080]  because we did it in a month we had a quick turnaround and I was only a week
[2:20:05.080 --> 2:20:09.480]  late or a little less than a week late in making the announcement. Sometimes I'm
[2:20:09.480 --> 2:20:15.000]  like two months late on that hundred thousand dollar contest because there
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:19.200]  were like 600 videos and most of them are really good and I just couldn't decide
[2:20:19.200 --> 2:20:24.480]  the winner. Now the crew pretty much unanimously agreed that going postal was
[2:20:24.480 --> 2:20:28.600]  the winner. I couldn't decide I thought it was either first or second place I'll
[2:20:28.600 --> 2:20:33.080]  be honest so I said put a poll up and see what the listeners think at info
[2:20:33.080 --> 2:20:37.520]  wars.com and we sent an email out with a poll as well and both on the website and
[2:20:37.520 --> 2:20:42.840]  in the email poll which video do you think should win going postal 28% Obama
[2:20:42.840 --> 2:20:49.560]  spreads Ebola awareness 27% truth is viral 19% spreading liberty in the den of
[2:20:49.560 --> 2:20:54.320]  criminals 12% Ebola visits skull and bones 9% Ebola goes digital 5%
[2:20:54.320 --> 2:21:00.060]  so the the votes at least in the first of three winning places were right in
[2:21:00.060 --> 2:21:04.960]  line with us so we picked the winners but sometimes we crowd source when we
[2:21:04.960 --> 2:21:10.120]  can't decide so everybody pretty much picked those winners we spend seven
[2:21:10.120 --> 2:21:13.560]  thousand five hundred dollars get massive probably five hundred thousand
[2:21:13.560 --> 2:21:17.660]  dollars for the promotion info wars.com the people that all do it get
[2:21:17.660 --> 2:21:20.400]  promotion of their own websites but most importantly it's about promoting
[2:21:20.400 --> 2:21:24.680]  liberty and truth and the people getting involved in taking action so wonderful
[2:21:24.680 --> 2:21:30.360]  job everybody that entered the contest a big winner and you know I had a
[2:21:30.360 --> 2:21:34.480]  surplus of like a hundred thousand dollars a few years ago because we try
[2:21:34.480 --> 2:21:37.720]  to make more money to put it back into the operation that's why we've grown
[2:21:37.720 --> 2:21:41.360]  that's our main goal and so I said we'll have a hundred thousand dollar contest
[2:21:41.360 --> 2:21:44.640]  and that was really a doozy but quite frankly seven thousand dollar
[2:21:44.640 --> 2:21:47.960]  contest or just as successful and we don't have the budget for that right
[2:21:47.960 --> 2:21:51.080]  now as people been asking winners is there gonna be another hundred thousand
[2:21:51.080 --> 2:21:56.120]  dollar contest probably never just because I don't want to try to run this
[2:21:56.120 --> 2:21:59.400]  operation just try to raise that type of capital I want to just get it up to a
[2:21:59.400 --> 2:22:03.000]  certain point get three or four more reporters couple more camera people few
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:08.560]  more riders and kind of stay at that level just because I can't manage it
[2:22:08.560 --> 2:22:14.080]  I'm trying to develop a system where we can do that and then people that enter
[2:22:14.080 --> 2:22:20.640]  contest can end up being auxiliary reporters who I'd like to pay but again
[2:22:20.640 --> 2:22:25.440]  it becomes a whole chicken or the egg thing where I can't spend all my time
[2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:28.920]  and energy just raising money and then managing people to try to have reporters
[2:22:28.920 --> 2:22:32.960]  on the ground what we need is folks just to go out and be reporters citizen
[2:22:32.960 --> 2:22:37.160]  journalists follow your reports to YouTube authorize us to use the clips in
[2:22:37.160 --> 2:22:42.680]  all or a portion of so that we can then all synergistically with human
[2:22:42.680 --> 2:22:48.440]  intelligence crowdsourced overthrow the dinosaur media what's left of it and
[2:22:48.440 --> 2:22:54.320]  that is certainly beginning to happen I don't mean to sycophantically quote Matt
[2:22:54.320 --> 2:22:58.280]  dredge so much just the things he said 15 years ago 10 years ago a year ago are
[2:22:58.280 --> 2:23:04.440]  so true so short and succinct you as a blogger or a person with a camera and a
[2:23:04.440 --> 2:23:09.240]  Facebook or a Twitter or a YouTube channel or a local radio show are just
[2:23:09.240 --> 2:23:14.020]  as important as the New York Times in fact we know they get caught lying all
[2:23:14.020 --> 2:23:20.120]  the time so you're more important than them and now what you report can
[2:23:20.120 --> 2:23:25.280]  instantly be picked up by others and so get out there and kick some new old
[2:23:25.280 --> 2:23:33.040]  order tail but that means when you see a citizen helping an old lady not just a
[2:23:33.040 --> 2:23:39.920]  cop might be a cop show that or when you see cops doing something bad show it
[2:23:39.920 --> 2:23:43.920]  when a cop walks up to Joe Bix for a reason says I will effing kill you and
[2:23:43.920 --> 2:23:47.680]  points a shotgun at him because Joe's there with a camera filming stuff that
[2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:51.000]  cop got relieved I think he's getting fired that's good you don't need a
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:56.240]  hot-headed crazy person in my opinion you know in the police department acting
[2:23:56.240 --> 2:24:00.800]  like that that is momentary insanity in my view and needs to be psychologically
[2:24:00.800 --> 2:24:05.640]  evaluated do I want to get a cop fired no but do I want my reporter dead can
[2:24:05.640 --> 2:24:11.200]  survive Afghanistan Iraq getting blown up repeatedly but can't survive Ferguson
[2:24:11.200 --> 2:24:18.760]  I had to pull my reporters out the cops were acting so bad and by the way a lot
[2:24:18.760 --> 2:24:22.080]  of the protesters were acting bad too that was what was sick we had protesters
[2:24:22.080 --> 2:24:27.880]  doing stuff to us cops doing stuff to us it was a shameful situation and the
[2:24:27.880 --> 2:24:30.360]  cops were acting like that because they couldn't release the investigation
[2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:33.480]  information yet which I disagree with and turn out the cops told the truth
[2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:38.400]  about what happened Ferguson they're saying when the word comes out of course
[2:24:38.400 --> 2:24:41.560]  on whether they're gonna indict the police officer or not that that St.
[2:24:41.560 --> 2:24:47.480]  Lewis not just Ferguson may burn I know this nobody better come around my house
[2:24:47.480 --> 2:24:51.400]  trying to burn something during a I mean burning down houses or businesses
[2:24:51.400 --> 2:24:58.720]  doesn't do anything for a youth that's been shot it's just a disgusting
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:03.160]  situation LA riots with Rodney King is what should be expected to happen in
[2:25:03.160 --> 2:25:07.280]  Ferguson evidence and justice irrelevant and politically charged case
[2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:11.360]  info wars calm a law professor in Indiana is predicting a repeat of the
[2:25:11.360 --> 2:25:17.480]  Rodney King riots that wrecked Los Angeles if Ferguson police officer
[2:25:17.480 --> 2:25:21.960]  Darren Wilson is not brought up on charges but if he was attacked and
[2:25:21.960 --> 2:25:27.080]  charged by someone obviously on something and and that most witnesses
[2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:32.800]  black witnesses said that and now it's come out in court I mean do we just
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:42.400]  lynch the cop just so people don't burn stuff down it's a mess and when the
[2:25:42.400 --> 2:25:45.480]  economy unravels ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna get to that now and then to
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:51.360]  your calls and a guest that's coming up Katie bar the door and I mentioned
[2:25:51.360 --> 2:25:55.680]  economist Martin Armstrong in the last hour article on info wars calm financial
[2:25:55.680 --> 2:25:59.720]  collapse will cost civil unrest revolution civil war whatever you want to
[2:25:59.720 --> 2:26:06.160]  call it this is being organized and all of us are gonna lose our standard of
[2:26:06.160 --> 2:26:09.640]  living and our freedom in this I don't care if you're a black man a white man
[2:26:09.640 --> 2:26:17.000]  a Hispanic woman an Asian woman an American Indian Native American a
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:21.880]  firefighter a schoolteacher this new world order is bad for freedom bad for
[2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:26.840]  business bad for life and it is organizing a worldwide collapse that it's
[2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:30.160]  going to roll the police state out as the solution of the collapse that they
[2:26:30.160 --> 2:26:35.640]  pulled the trigger on so the reason I keep harping on this is the plan is
[2:26:35.640 --> 2:26:39.400]  clear in the movies the TV the preparation the actual training the
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:44.440]  secret documents we've gotten and made national news with I say that because I
[2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:47.800]  say secret documents and I see on the YouTube where are they show them to us
[2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:51.920]  New York Times Washington Post had to report on it we broke the mic we broke
[2:26:51.920 --> 2:26:55.520]  the Homeland Security documents we were giving all of them go look it up before
[2:26:55.520 --> 2:26:59.400]  you say I'm making something up I have to sit here and source site source site
[2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:02.880]  just to counter people to say I'm lying sometimes I think I shouldn't even do
[2:27:02.880 --> 2:27:07.400]  that because it just takes up all the time if I've already sourced something a
[2:27:07.400 --> 2:27:10.680]  hundred times before maybe I just shouldn't every time come back with it
[2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:16.240]  the number one enemy is gun owners returning veterans Christians
[2:27:16.240 --> 2:27:20.160]  conservatives libertarians constitutionalist in all the government
[2:27:20.160 --> 2:27:27.720]  reports I played a clip of Napolitano apologizing for it earlier at 10 after
[2:27:27.720 --> 2:27:33.240]  the clip played that's where she said it that cue it up again and that Captain
[2:27:33.240 --> 2:27:38.040]  America intro because I still go on other shows they go you claim the
[2:27:38.040 --> 2:27:43.000]  government's training to take on veterans I don't claim Jack squat don't make it
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:49.960]  about me face what's in the documents face what's in the training they don't
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:55.480]  train to fight al Qaeda they train to fight gun owners in a civil war that's
[2:27:55.480 --> 2:27:59.920]  the battle plan and how will they launch it they'll blow stuff up it's even come
[2:27:59.920 --> 2:28:03.880]  out in Democrat memos it's even been on Fox News they're gonna blow up stuff in
[2:28:03.880 --> 2:28:08.800]  blaming on us and you know who they're gonna blame who do they blame every
[2:28:08.800 --> 2:28:15.680]  time talk radio at who's at the top of the list Alex Jones with Oklahoma City
[2:28:15.680 --> 2:28:20.480]  that was his phonies $3 bill who they blame who they blame Rush Limbaugh
[2:28:20.480 --> 2:28:26.640]  within 25 minutes Bill Clinton came out and said Rush Limbaugh's fault what did
[2:28:26.640 --> 2:28:31.280]  Rush Limbaugh have to do with Tim McVeigh with a bunch of other people in a
[2:28:31.280 --> 2:28:34.960]  government operation blowing that building up I've interviewed the police
[2:28:34.960 --> 2:28:40.200]  who were there and who saw the feds and the feds came in their office and said
[2:28:40.200 --> 2:28:44.240]  I'm gonna kill you and your wife if you don't shut up and they did kill cop of
[2:28:44.240 --> 2:28:49.320]  the year who wouldn't shut up I've had cops on this show like Don Browning who
[2:28:49.320 --> 2:28:52.960]  was highly decorated Marine and Vietnam head of the Canine unit and when I said
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:57.040]  go ahead to say the names who threatened you he turned white on air gut it up
[2:28:57.040 --> 2:29:01.360]  stuck his chest out and said the guy's name you know I mean you understand the
[2:29:01.360 --> 2:29:06.080]  world we actually live in here do you understand how real this is do you
[2:29:06.080 --> 2:29:09.600]  understand they could come after me at any time do you understand and the fact
[2:29:09.600 --> 2:29:14.160]  that we're on air shows there is still a lot of freedom out here
[2:29:16.200 --> 2:29:21.000]  oh yeah here's the Poletano we'll go to break here it is so I'm gonna ask you
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:27.200]  about it and that's this right wing was a scrimmism report that was mailed out
[2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:31.360]  the law all law enforcement officials in the United States I've apologized for
[2:29:31.360 --> 2:29:37.440]  that report it was not authorized to be distributed this is a freedom she'll
[2:29:37.440 --> 2:29:42.680]  text the world as it is not as we'd like it to be and again we know the names of
[2:29:42.680 --> 2:29:45.640]  who planted the bombs we have the hotel receipts we have the witnesses that saw
[2:29:45.640 --> 2:29:49.640]  them planting explosives we got news we're on the mark taking the bombs out the
[2:29:49.640 --> 2:29:59.440]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:32.600]  hijack big industry entertainment memes with parallels to the real world and
[2:33:32.600 --> 2:33:35.680]  the last five minutes of the broadcast today will premiere a piece that Rob do
[2:33:35.680 --> 2:33:39.040]  was gonna do for the nightly news I saw it thought it was so good let's just air
[2:33:39.040 --> 2:33:43.920]  it here on the radio show not that the bad stuffs on the nightly news quite
[2:33:43.920 --> 2:33:47.200]  frankly the nightly news for 30 minutes of broadcast is much better than my
[2:33:47.200 --> 2:33:51.520]  radio show in my humble opinion it's so concentrated and so well done but I tend
[2:33:51.520 --> 2:33:55.600]  to hijack stuff from the nightly news before it airs and play it here which
[2:33:55.600 --> 2:34:01.000]  was my plan all along so that's coming up in the final segment Star Wars of the
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:05.120]  new episode has a title the force awakens we'll give you a sneak peek of
[2:34:05.120 --> 2:34:13.400]  that coming up sneak peek on the force awakens so that is coming up and we'll
[2:34:13.400 --> 2:34:17.440]  probably get this fellow back on with us again for a full hour because after I
[2:34:17.440 --> 2:34:21.120]  began to research him it's just really amazing we hear about all these treatments
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:26.400]  for things like Ebola is it colloidal silver is it ozone therapy is it going
[2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:34.280]  in a barometric chamber I thought why not get a renowned emergency medicine MD
[2:34:34.280 --> 2:34:39.360]  board certified officially known as the father of medical freedom for spear
[2:34:39.360 --> 2:34:44.280]  heading the first state protection for alternative unconventional medicine in
[2:34:44.280 --> 2:34:49.600]  Alaska 1990 to spread around the rest of the country it's dr. Rowan MD dot com or
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:56.120]  doc rowan dot com he joins us he's been to Africa dealing with Ebola recently
[2:34:56.120 --> 2:35:00.280]  he's working with their governments there in alternative treatments and I've
[2:35:00.280 --> 2:35:05.840]  seen news reports where they're Africans of saying it's been working so doctor
[2:35:05.840 --> 2:35:10.800]  thanks for coming on with us tell us where you've been in Africa what your
[2:35:10.800 --> 2:35:15.160]  view overall on the Ebola situation is and what you think of the response has
[2:35:15.160 --> 2:35:19.560]  been like and then let's talk about what you've been able to do with ozone well
[2:35:19.560 --> 2:35:23.280]  I've been working thank you Alex it's a honor to be with you I've been working
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:28.120]  with ozone therapy since 1986 longer than any other living person in North
[2:35:28.120 --> 2:35:34.400]  America I got the idea to go to North Africa or West Africa several months ago
[2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:41.200]  when this thing really got hot because ozone is probably the most ideal
[2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:46.360]  treatment there is for this I was just listening to your commercials before you
[2:35:46.360 --> 2:35:51.200]  brought me on and you talked about certain types of oxygen therapy and
[2:35:51.200 --> 2:35:58.840]  longevity therapies etc suppose you had a therapy that was absolutely dirt cheap
[2:35:58.840 --> 2:36:03.360]  that could be done for less than a dollar for treatment and has the following
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:08.960]  four parameters one it improves the rheologic properties of blood flow that
[2:36:08.960 --> 2:36:15.280]  means blood flows better to it releases more oxygen from the red cells and it
[2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:21.920]  helps the mitochondria burn that oxygen to make energy three it modulates the
[2:36:21.920 --> 2:36:26.560]  immune system meaning if the immune system is way up here like it is with
[2:36:26.560 --> 2:36:30.920]  Ebola when you get at the end stage you get what's called a cytokine storm
[2:36:30.920 --> 2:36:35.080]  that's collateral damage your immune system comes out with all of its bullets
[2:36:35.080 --> 2:36:40.480]  and artillery firing at everything and it gets you but ozone modulates that
[2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:45.560]  process and brings it down ozone if your immune system is down here we'll bring
[2:36:45.560 --> 2:36:50.120]  it back up to where it should go it dials back the hemorrhagic response it
[2:36:50.120 --> 2:36:56.240]  should and then the final thing is ozone is directly viral inactivating by
[2:36:56.240 --> 2:37:01.720]  biochemical processes viruses are inactivated by heat by ultraviolet and
[2:37:01.720 --> 2:37:07.880]  by oxidation and ozone is the ultimate oxidant and it's non-toxic so it should
[2:37:07.880 --> 2:37:12.600]  totally knock out the Ebola virus instantly now we went over there to
[2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:17.840]  teach doctors how to do it and we taught a lot we turned heads in the medical
[2:37:17.840 --> 2:37:23.080]  community we turn I mean doctors their biggest doctors came to our lectures
[2:37:23.080 --> 2:37:27.640]  and learn how to do this and some of them came highly skeptical and left
[2:37:27.640 --> 2:37:32.280]  absolutely blown away well I know this just reading the news the Queen of
[2:37:32.280 --> 2:37:36.400]  England and the Queen mother lived over a hundred are obsessed with barometric
[2:37:36.400 --> 2:37:40.040]  chambers ozone treatment you name it and I was talking to a doctor that runs
[2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:44.320]  one of the most elite clinics in Austin for the rich people and he said that's
[2:37:44.320 --> 2:37:48.640]  what they're all doing is running their blood even when they're healthy through
[2:37:48.640 --> 2:37:55.480]  ozone systems through machines that use ultraviolet light so this is actually
[2:37:55.480 --> 2:38:00.160]  known I understand you're a pioneer of it I'm just surprised that it's not more
[2:38:00.160 --> 2:38:04.760]  widespread well let's look at what happened in Sierra Leone and then you
[2:38:04.760 --> 2:38:09.360]  won't be surprised of all the people who didn't come to our by the way we were
[2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:14.960]  invited by the president of Sierra Leone and we met twice with him and we
[2:38:14.960 --> 2:38:19.800]  also met with his key advisor now the only people who didn't come to our
[2:38:19.800 --> 2:38:23.840]  lectures who should have were the minister of health and the deputy
[2:38:23.840 --> 2:38:28.080]  minister of health and those who are making over a hundred thousand dollars a
[2:38:28.080 --> 2:38:34.400]  year administering their Ebola program mind you in a poor country like Sierra
[2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:41.120]  Leone those people are making more than I do on a yearly basis for administering
[2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:46.520]  their Ebola program they didn't come to the lectures now what does that tell you
[2:38:46.520 --> 2:38:53.360]  and then at the last minute when the treatment was in the Ebola Center we
[2:38:53.360 --> 2:38:59.440]  went to the Ebola Center the machine was there the staff lined up they were
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:03.560]  skeptical at first but the staff at the Ebola Center by the way I didn't treat
[2:39:03.560 --> 2:39:07.920]  Ebola so people don't have to worry I wasn't face-to-face with any Ebola
[2:39:07.920 --> 2:39:16.880]  patient I was there treating staff not treating instructing the staff jockey
[2:39:16.880 --> 2:39:22.160]  they vied they competed to get treatments to protect themselves but a call
[2:39:22.160 --> 2:39:26.320]  came in while we were there from the deputy minister of health and then a
[2:39:26.320 --> 2:39:31.080]  second call came in from the minister of health telling the military major who
[2:39:31.080 --> 2:39:37.920]  was in charge of the government facility it quote if you value your job there
[2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:44.680]  will be no ozone treatments at the facility end quote unbelievable by the
[2:39:44.680 --> 2:39:49.640]  way you're all you're under quarantine right now self-quarantine correct yes
[2:39:49.640 --> 2:39:54.280]  it's modified I am there they're not upset if I go outside but I have to
[2:39:54.280 --> 2:39:58.040]  monitor my temperature every day a couple times a day if I go out I have to
[2:39:58.040 --> 2:40:02.320]  do it before and after I have no quarrel with this it's the proper thing to do and
[2:40:02.320 --> 2:40:06.080]  I'm not seeing patients at the present time because what patient would want to
[2:40:06.080 --> 2:40:10.200]  come in and see me during this time but my quarantine is over next week how long
[2:40:10.200 --> 2:40:17.200]  have you been at back from Africa um two weeks so yeah I mean that's just another
[2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:21.160]  week and you're done then yes what do you think of this doctor I know you don't
[2:40:21.160 --> 2:40:24.880]  like to throw stones but this doctor in New York that had a fever had come back
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:30.720]  and went to bowling alleys on the subway to restaurants and then the police said
[2:40:30.720 --> 2:40:34.880]  he lied and said he hadn't gone outside but they got his credit card receipts
[2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:40.640]  you're right I don't like to throw stones I'm trying to be very let's talk
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:43.960]  about what I'm doing yeah let's talk about what you're doing because I don't
[2:40:43.960 --> 2:40:47.960]  like overall that the Obama response I've seen alternative treatments are being
[2:40:47.960 --> 2:40:54.280]  shut down in Africa we've read I mean is that an accurate statement yes I mean
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:40:59.520]  we brought it we brought a treatment that is absolutely safe it's published in
[2:40:59.520 --> 2:41:04.000]  the world literature that it's absolutely safe it is extraordinarily
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:08.480]  affected at infectious disease at modulating the immune system this was
[2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:12.520]  published in peer review journals there's absolutely no question how is this
[2:41:12.520 --> 2:41:18.440]  particular therapy delivered the therapy we went to teach is real simple you
[2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:26.000]  take some oxygen ozone gas the gas I mean it's not air Alex air is 80% nitrogen
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:30.040]  do you understand the difference yes this is a hundred percent oxygen of
[2:41:30.040 --> 2:41:37.320]  which four percent of it is ozone and it's about maybe this you start with
[2:41:37.320 --> 2:41:42.960]  maybe 20 ccs and then each treatment you take a little bit more it's oxygen
[2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:47.320]  it's metabolically active it's consumed so it's not like shooting air or
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:50.920]  nitrogen into you no no I understand because all the elites for you as you
[2:41:50.920 --> 2:41:55.240]  know for years are obsessed with this and get the treatments and and and again
[2:41:55.240 --> 2:42:00.160]  explain how it's different than air and why it's then safe to be shot right
[2:42:00.160 --> 2:42:04.440]  into the veins well it's it well first of all for Ebola you know what medical
[2:42:04.440 --> 2:42:09.200]  waste the only waste here the only thing that's contaminated is the butterfly
[2:42:09.200 --> 2:42:13.920]  needle that goes in your vein here that's all it's just a very tiny 27 gauge
[2:42:13.920 --> 2:42:18.880]  butterfly and then there's a syringe about this big well the syringe doesn't
[2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:23.320]  touch the blood the needle does so that's disposable and that costs what 30
[2:42:23.320 --> 2:42:28.320]  cents 40 cents let me ask you this why are the elites so obsessed with this if
[2:42:28.320 --> 2:42:32.960]  they don't have Ebola why are they constantly getting it and why are people
[2:42:32.960 --> 2:42:36.120]  always telling me to get it I know medical doctors that say come in I'll
[2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:39.880]  give you a treatment they're getting rich off of it right now I mean I'm sure
[2:42:39.880 --> 2:42:44.440]  you know is one of the leading guys in this this is really hot I teach this I'm
[2:42:44.440 --> 2:42:48.160]  going to be on the oxidation chair of the American College for advancement in
[2:42:48.160 --> 2:42:52.120]  medicine and I'm chairing the workshop next week I've been doing this for years
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:42:57.880]  I think ozone is the ultimate anti-aging treatment that there is why because we
[2:42:57.880 --> 2:43:04.000]  know for sure ozone stimulates the production of superoxide dismutase SOD
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:09.600]  and SOD is a part and parcel of the activity of an enzyme called telomerase
[2:43:09.600 --> 2:43:15.320]  telomerase is what nourishes the end cap of your chromosomes the better your
[2:43:15.320 --> 2:43:19.120]  telomerase the better your telomere the healthier your DNA and the longer you
[2:43:19.120 --> 2:43:25.440]  live my telomeres at age 60 I'm older than that now where the average length
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:31.160]  of a 35 year old I'm how old are you because you look like you're like 55 I
[2:43:31.160 --> 2:43:35.480]  love you Alex thank you I'm not kidding I mean look I saw on the street I'd say
[2:43:35.480 --> 2:43:42.200]  that guy's 55 I'll be 65 in a week Wow Wow so I mean read the literature we
[2:43:42.200 --> 2:43:46.600]  gotta have you back for a full hour soon you you pioneered this and and I'm not
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:52.200]  kidding I know national radio hosts that get these every week two of them I know
[2:43:52.200 --> 2:43:56.960]  a bunch of really successful I mean really rich people billionaires that get
[2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:03.400]  it every month or so and then all these other people are into it all these
[2:44:03.400 --> 2:44:07.880]  exercise enthusiasts are into it but then almost everybody else I talked to has
[2:44:07.880 --> 2:44:11.160]  never heard of it and they go oh yeah I mean and I haven't done it yet I'm
[2:44:11.160 --> 2:44:15.480]  intending to do it they go I'll never inject air into my vein I'll kill you
[2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:20.200]  they just don't understand well first of all to understand why it's not out
[2:44:20.200 --> 2:44:26.760]  there follow the money trail how much money is it to inject 20 ccs 30 ccs
[2:44:26.760 --> 2:44:32.440]  of oxygen gas it ain't much even if you do it the way I've been doing it for
[2:44:32.440 --> 2:44:36.440]  years which is major auto chemotherapy where you take blood out and the ozone
[2:44:36.440 --> 2:44:41.160]  oxygen gas and put it back in no drug company is going to make billions of
[2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:45.120]  dollars on this because you can't patent it ozone therapy has been around since
[2:44:45.120 --> 2:44:51.280]  1920 for God's sake it was even used in the First World War by Germans well I
[2:44:51.280 --> 2:44:54.640]  know you can look it up that the royal families obsessed with it I mean
[2:44:54.640 --> 2:44:58.480]  they're not stupid and look at their health they're really quite in good
[2:44:58.480 --> 2:45:04.080]  health they also do homeopathy too and then they have people making fun of that
[2:45:04.080 --> 2:45:08.240]  and misrepresenting it constantly it's it's just incredible wow well tell us
[2:45:08.240 --> 2:45:11.200]  about your website tell us about where this is going I know you're trying to
[2:45:11.200 --> 2:45:14.320]  get more attention to this and I know that some of the presidents over in
[2:45:14.320 --> 2:45:17.920]  Africa are obviously one of themselves and their families I don't think they're
[2:45:17.920 --> 2:45:21.760]  gonna be able to hide something this powerful though well first of all I I've
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:26.360]  posted our story on my on my Facebook page there's a public page anybody can
[2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:32.600]  go to it Dr. Robert J Rowan so you can go there and read my postings I have an
[2:45:32.600 --> 2:45:37.160]  incredible YouTube channel with well over a hundred patients and many of them
[2:45:37.160 --> 2:45:41.320]  before and after treatments some of them crippled when they walked in the door
[2:45:41.320 --> 2:45:45.520]  and they're dancing out swinging their hips afterwards that YouTube channel is
[2:45:45.520 --> 2:45:55.800]  youtube.com slash user slash Robert Rowan M D R O W E N is my name you could
[2:45:55.800 --> 2:45:59.440]  find that easy there's a lot of videos of me on YouTube but you want to go to
[2:45:59.440 --> 2:46:03.240]  the channel to see the patients and I even have patients that we read doctors
[2:46:03.240 --> 2:46:08.000]  from Sierra Leone that we recorded both before and after and you need to look at
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:12.560]  the expression on their face you'll see things you just wouldn't believe if you
[2:46:12.560 --> 2:46:18.120]  didn't see it and by the way the day after the government shut down our
[2:46:18.120 --> 2:46:24.960]  attempt to use ozone on Ebola patients there the foreign minister called my
[2:46:24.960 --> 2:46:30.200]  physician host who was trying to get this through and he wanted ozone treatment
[2:46:30.200 --> 2:46:35.880]  for his mother and his family because she was in an Ebola area isn't that
[2:46:35.880 --> 2:46:40.360]  interesting so they'll shut it down for everybody but they still want it for
[2:46:40.360 --> 2:46:44.000]  themselves well look I'll be honest I've been hearing about this ozone
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:46.680]  injections and these treatments they do taking the blood out there's other
[2:46:46.680 --> 2:46:52.680]  systems for years but now it is all the rage and I've seen people I know they're
[2:46:52.680 --> 2:46:56.920]  like 65 years old that are already one of them's a well-known sports champion
[2:46:56.920 --> 2:47:01.280]  that I'm friends with and he just looks so much younger from the ozone
[2:47:01.280 --> 2:47:07.600]  treatments and it's amazing I think I'm gonna do it but I'll probably consult
[2:47:07.600 --> 2:47:10.560]  with you doctor about where I should go and what the best treatment would be
[2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:14.240]  because I know you're one of the grand poobos of it I hope you can come back in
[2:47:14.240 --> 2:47:18.720]  the next few weeks for a full hour to really you know send us the points you
[2:47:18.720 --> 2:47:23.600]  want to go over play some clips your videos and do a special hour on this
[2:47:23.600 --> 2:47:28.600]  because alternative medicine has been proven to be so effective it was just a
[2:47:28.600 --> 2:47:32.400]  gift that you and others are helping promote out to the world so we salute
[2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:37.360]  what you're doing but it's so simple we operate off oxygen so supercharged
[2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:42.160]  oxygen with ozone just does amazing things inside the body and and I've
[2:47:42.160 --> 2:47:47.280]  also read from the scientists the main literature that oxygen levels are low in
[2:47:47.280 --> 2:47:52.040]  the planet's history right now as well correct yeah actually our oxygen levels
[2:47:52.040 --> 2:47:55.720]  are probably getting lower as we're destroying more of the plant life that
[2:47:55.720 --> 2:48:00.600]  create that that puts oxygen out yeah but the most important thing to your
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:06.560]  body above everything is oxygen and it's a long way from oxygen out here to
[2:48:06.560 --> 2:48:12.160]  oxygen in the tip of your finger inside the circular in inside your body it's a
[2:48:12.160 --> 2:48:18.080]  long route and ozone is incredible at helping that process out oxygen is the
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:23.560]  fundamental of life for us and all healing is dependent upon oxygen okay
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:26.400]  you don't have it you die okay well promise you'll come back for a full
[2:48:26.400 --> 2:48:31.880]  hour dr. Robert Rowan MD dr. Rowan MD dot com doc Rowan dot com we're gonna
[2:48:31.880 --> 2:48:37.520]  tweet again the link out to your YouTube page just amazing information thank you

[2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:45.720]  you so much Alex one final question I forgot to ask before you go so just to
[2:48:45.720 --> 2:48:49.800]  be clear I saw it in the news you're there the doctors are loving it and then
[2:48:49.800 --> 2:48:54.240]  they ban the treatment in the country and I mean that's just amazing the
[2:48:54.240 --> 2:48:59.640]  doctors loved it it was the Ministry of Health that that asked it and this is
[2:48:59.640 --> 2:49:04.000]  just an opinion now it's it's my personal opinion I believe they're more
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:08.200]  interested in getting the millions and millions of dollars coming in to dig
[2:49:08.200 --> 2:49:12.840]  graves and to incinerate the bodies then they are in trying something that has
[2:49:12.840 --> 2:49:17.120]  been proven safe to actually save the life we wanted to put the grave diggers
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:22.080]  out of business not get more money in for grave digging all right well God
[2:49:22.080 --> 2:49:26.320]  bless you makes a lot of sense we need oxygen wow what a thought thank you

[2:54:06.720 --> 2:54:13.680]  well I could stand in line for this Rob Deuce sneak peek at Star Wars the force
[2:54:13.680 --> 2:54:18.520]  awakens by Disney you know it's gonna be cheesy in case you're wondering the new
[2:54:18.520 --> 2:54:23.040]  title for Star Wars episode 7 was just released and it's gonna be called the
[2:54:23.040 --> 2:54:32.440]  force awakens interesting title and we'll see if that still plays out in the
[2:54:32.440 --> 2:54:35.720]  past there have been title changes at the last minute return of the Jedi was
[2:54:35.720 --> 2:54:39.680]  gonna be called revenge of the Jedi and now we all hope that JJ Abrams can
[2:54:39.680 --> 2:54:43.560]  succeed where the prequel failed and that's to create a movie with credible
[2:54:43.560 --> 2:54:47.120]  acting and not rely on cartoon characters to appeal to that elusive two
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:52.640]  to six-year-old demographic what's this a local but where the prequel did go
[2:54:52.640 --> 2:54:57.560]  right is by illustrating the false flag operation and the Hegelian dialectic in
[2:54:57.560 --> 2:55:04.280]  order to ensure the security and continuing the stability the republic
[2:55:04.280 --> 2:55:08.520]  will be reorganized into the first
[2:55:08.520 --> 2:55:23.200]  Emperor Palpatine or the Emperor's he is referred to by the time he was thrown
[2:55:23.200 --> 2:55:27.760]  down a reactor chef started off as a mild-mannered senator from Naboo he then
[2:55:27.760 --> 2:55:32.320]  hatched a multi-decade plan using many different alien races as his useful ID
[2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:37.520]  10 T's that's idiots for all you out there who don't speak nerd these aren't
[2:55:37.520 --> 2:55:43.960]  the droids you're looking for he secretly initiates the creation of two
[2:55:43.960 --> 2:55:47.320]  armies manages to get elected chancellor under the guise of a humanitarian
[2:55:47.320 --> 2:55:54.200]  crisis my first act with this new authority I will create a grand army of
[2:55:54.200 --> 2:55:59.800]  the republic to counter the increasing threats of the separatists then starts a
[2:55:59.800 --> 2:56:03.440]  war where both sides of the conflict have unlimited budgets to fight a war on
[2:56:03.440 --> 2:56:06.600]  hundreds of battle fronts thereby draining the resources of all sides and
[2:56:06.600 --> 2:56:10.520]  doing this under the nose of the Jedi who just can't seem to realize that the
[2:56:10.520 --> 2:56:17.960]  guy walking and talking with them is a Sith Lord the dark side clouds everything
[2:56:17.960 --> 2:56:27.240]  the Emperor even manages to off all of his commanders and convinces his new
[2:56:27.240 --> 2:56:31.240]  apprentice Darth bad acting to kill all the remaining leaders of his confederacy
[2:56:31.240 --> 2:56:36.240]  so he is then the only person with total knowledge of his master plan
[2:56:36.240 --> 2:56:46.920]  look up the night of the long knives if you want a historical example for that
[2:56:46.920 --> 2:56:51.320]  one fast forward 18 years the supreme chancellor disbands his dysfunctional
[2:56:51.320 --> 2:56:55.520]  government in favor of a dictatorship I have just received word that the emperor
[2:56:55.520 --> 2:56:59.920]  has dissolved the council permanently thus completing a galaxy-wide false flag
[2:56:59.920 --> 2:57:03.640]  which started off as a seemingly small planetary trade blockade on his home
[2:57:03.640 --> 2:57:08.600]  planet so by playing off all sides against each other and creating a crisis
[2:57:08.600 --> 2:57:13.400]  which is the confederacy with the giant drone army he is able to pull off the
[2:57:13.400 --> 2:57:17.000]  Hegelian dialectic by providing his own convenient clone army which he started
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:22.880]  creating years ago Emperor Palpatine is the perfect technocrat dictator it's
[2:57:22.880 --> 2:57:29.360]  treason then so while it remains to be seen out there what will be seen in
[2:57:29.360 --> 2:57:33.840]  episode 7 whether it's chrome stormtroopers the inquisitor or Chewbacca
[2:57:33.840 --> 2:57:37.920]  with a bionic hand it will be interesting to see if JJ Abrams can harness the
[2:57:37.920 --> 2:57:42.120]  archetypes and historical references that George Lucas used all so well the
[2:57:42.120 --> 2:57:45.640]  fact that he is now under the Disney umbrella probably means anything
[2:57:45.640 --> 2:57:49.800]  meaningful won't be seen in this film there'll be a lot of flash and a lot of
[2:57:49.800 --> 2:57:56.640]  lens flares that I can almost assure you I find your lack of faith disturbing but
[2:57:56.640 --> 2:58:00.400]  I do have a new hope that he will do a better job than George Lucas in creating
[2:58:00.400 --> 2:58:04.560]  a stylistic masterpiece and if you would like a complete history of false flags
[2:58:04.560 --> 2:58:09.160]  pick up a copy of Terror Storm a history of government-sponsored terrorism at the
