[01:30.960 --> 01:35.360]  about some of the big things that are developing worldwide with him when he
[01:35.360 --> 01:43.280]  joins us there is a video from Fox News Sunday that we played quite a bit
[01:43.280 --> 01:46.880]  yesterday it's really getting a lot of attention today because drudge has had
[01:46.880 --> 01:52.920]  it up since yesterday where the architect of Obamacare is Eq a manual
[01:52.920 --> 02:01.280]  just comes right out and says look the plan you know basically is to just get
[02:01.280 --> 02:04.400]  rid of you individually being able to get health care and to have it be state
[02:04.400 --> 02:09.840]  run but the profits will go to the insurance companies and and they will
[02:09.840 --> 02:14.360]  make you pay whatever they want it's basically an unlimited corporate tax
[02:14.360 --> 02:19.800]  that is meant to shut down the economy it's cloured and pivot and that's just
[02:19.800 --> 02:26.320]  one manifestation in sociology and economics from the 60s but it's older
[02:26.320 --> 02:30.880]  than that to come in and wreck a society one of the best examples is the is the
[02:30.880 --> 02:36.880]  communists of Bolsheviks when they took over Poland Ukraine Romania part of the
[02:36.880 --> 02:42.720]  Czechoslovakia and other areas they would turn the economy off on record and
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.360]  shut down the food shut down the water to make everybody totally bankrupt shut
[02:47.360 --> 02:53.040]  down and then only allow their inside operatives and their party officials to
[02:53.040 --> 02:57.640]  run businesses also becoming fabulously wealthy and then of course all the
[02:57.640 --> 03:03.080]  communist officials had a beautiful chateaus in on the Black Sea but also in
[03:03.080 --> 03:08.160]  places like Switzerland and other areas and they would launder billions of
[03:08.160 --> 03:15.240]  stolen rubles into foreign accounts and would have hundreds of mistresses and
[03:15.240 --> 03:19.440]  horse racing and everything else while folks starved to death and and that's
[03:19.440 --> 03:23.920]  how it is with the French socialist see it all ties together this year it came
[03:23.920 --> 03:28.900]  out earlier this year and then didn't get in trouble that Swiss bureaucrats have
[03:28.900 --> 03:34.120]  billions of peace even just mid-level have hundreds of millions of euros in
[03:34.120 --> 03:42.800]  Swiss and Luxembourg and Monte Carlo and Bahamas banks and they pay no taxes but
[03:42.800 --> 03:48.480]  everyone else pays on average about 75% federal and overall over 90% but now the
[03:48.480 --> 03:52.600]  middle class to just get rid of them actual middle class and nouveau riche
[03:52.600 --> 03:58.840]  it's a 100% plus actually I keep saying 100% I'm sorry it's it's all the money
[03:58.840 --> 04:04.360]  you make and then more to destroy your savings and then that money is again
[04:04.360 --> 04:08.960]  taken and select corporations are exempt and it transfers the economy and
[04:08.960 --> 04:13.960]  vertically integrates it is a total 100% mafia crime syndicate takeoff and
[04:13.960 --> 04:21.240]  that is the plan here publicly so the public is still so incredibly trusting
[04:21.240 --> 04:26.000]  of the criminal mafias that have seized control that most people will be
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.640]  completely bankrupted before they wake up and then the only job will be
[04:29.640 --> 04:32.960]  government or government affiliated or corporate connected to the government
[04:32.960 --> 04:36.320]  job so a lot of them will just shut up and try to survive in that system and
[04:36.320 --> 04:41.160]  then the long dark night begins of total tyranny and then the public will go
[04:41.160 --> 04:44.240]  along with the mass arrests and disappearances of people because you
[04:44.240 --> 04:46.760]  know you can never say you were wrong you can never stand up against the evil
[04:46.760 --> 04:49.920]  you have to give it full reign to destroy everything and then you are
[04:49.920 --> 04:55.560]  destroyed or humiliated and poor and your family are used for basically
[04:55.560 --> 05:01.760]  national compulsory service the road to slavery Alex Jones here with a message

[08:34.480 --> 08:39.680]  resistance you're listening to alex jones
[08:39.680 --> 08:54.680]  well my friends we reported on this last Friday and now CBS News has picked it up
[08:54.680 --> 09:04.560]  you can see the forbidden art at drudge report.com and info wars.com the shirt
[09:04.560 --> 09:13.720]  that the NSA tried to ban t-shirt artist strikes back and the logo is a parody of
[09:13.720 --> 09:18.640]  the NSA say peeping while you're sleeping the NSA the only part of
[09:18.640 --> 09:24.000]  government that actually listens they sent a cease and desist trying to have
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.800]  the t-shirt maker stop using it they went after his shopping cart a bunch of
[09:30.800 --> 09:37.880]  other things but now he's fighting back against them suing them it's absolutely
[09:37.880 --> 09:43.360]  a parody and by the way everyone should do this I think we're going to come out
[09:43.360 --> 09:53.360]  with a NSA slash TSA shirt NSA on one side probably the back saying you know
[09:53.360 --> 09:57.320]  watching you when you're not looking or watching over your back on the front the
[09:57.320 --> 10:01.840]  TSA the TSA is also threatened people and threatened to sue people and tried to
[10:01.840 --> 10:08.800]  shut folks down over and over and over again and we also have folks critical of
[10:08.800 --> 10:14.960]  Obamacare having their Facebooks accounts shut down and suspended this is
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.160]  really the authoritarianism of these people and we must all resist what
[10:20.160 --> 10:25.040]  they're doing it's like the TSA coming out a month ago with announcements
[10:25.040 --> 10:36.000]  nationwide and saying that anyone anyone who makes a joke in the airport about
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.400]  them we're going to arrest you now really under statutory law they can't do
[10:39.400 --> 10:48.400]  that but there is the thuggish implied threat in all of that so it is
[10:48.400 --> 10:54.600]  absolutely essential for all of us to engage in our First Amendment or lose
[10:54.600 --> 10:59.120]  it and we'll be called names will be demonized but the power structure is
[10:59.120 --> 11:05.240]  running on empty the power structures shooting blanks here folks are aware that
[11:05.240 --> 11:10.440]  the system is illegitimate that the social contract is not just broken but
[11:10.440 --> 11:16.720]  is absolutely predatory and that we're in deep trouble now that the the general
[11:16.720 --> 11:20.920]  population has no idea just how deep the rabbit hole goes just how serious the
[11:20.920 --> 11:27.840]  situation is but at the same time they're beginning to find out more and
[11:27.840 --> 11:33.680]  more and then that learning curve is very very accelerated takes off like a
[11:33.680 --> 11:39.040]  rocket once you get the rocket fueled loaded ready to launch it's basically
[11:39.040 --> 11:45.240]  lifted off now and that awakening is only going to accelerate as the projectile
[11:45.240 --> 11:49.000]  picks up speed here and that's why we're entering that key window when the
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.160]  establishment is going to stage all sorts of stuff and is going to really
[11:53.160 --> 11:57.880]  try to throttle the general public back under their control the power structure
[11:57.880 --> 12:01.200]  could have continued with their empire continued with their takeover their
[12:01.200 --> 12:04.960]  breakdown of the family their breakdown of society they could have continued with
[12:04.960 --> 12:09.280]  the shutdown of the economy but they wanted it all right now they wanted to
[12:09.280 --> 12:13.240]  fully break us and accelerate their program because they were getting behind
[12:13.240 --> 12:17.080]  schedule in their view a lot of old globalists like David Rockefeller and
[12:17.080 --> 12:20.740]  Henry Kissinger and Zabigniew Brzezinski have written books saying they want to
[12:20.740 --> 12:25.240]  see their world government their new world order established and you know
[12:25.240 --> 12:28.720]  they can't like they did 10 years ago or even 15 years ago say there's no world
[12:28.720 --> 12:33.520]  government there's no corporate system being set up anyone that says there's a
[12:33.520 --> 12:38.640]  new world order is insane it doesn't exist they can't do that anymore they
[12:38.640 --> 12:43.240]  can stage an event blaming on folks that talk about the new world order but
[12:43.240 --> 12:49.520]  people know that's real now people know global governance is here on CNBC almost
[12:49.520 --> 12:53.800]  every time I tune in they admit we're run by foreign banks you read Spanish
[12:53.800 --> 12:59.520]  papers German papers Swiss papers Mexican newspapers they admit yeah there's a
[12:59.520 --> 13:05.120]  giant global corporate cartel above the law exempt getting taxpayer money people
[13:05.120 --> 13:09.360]  are getting it and once you admit there's an elite who didn't get there by
[13:09.360 --> 13:14.280]  being the best writers or by being the best inventors or being you know the
[13:14.280 --> 13:17.680]  most honorable no that's the type of system you want to build where the
[13:17.680 --> 13:21.480]  elite are virtuous people that's when you build incredible civilizations and
[13:21.480 --> 13:26.520]  go to the stars no it's all about how big and manipulative and gangster-ish
[13:26.520 --> 13:32.200]  your your crew is that's why there's a book coming out from White House AIDS
[13:32.200 --> 13:36.440]  quoting Obama would just walk around bragging saying I'm really good at
[13:36.440 --> 13:40.360]  killing people you know how awesome I am you know I love going in and doing the
[13:40.360 --> 13:44.480]  morning briefing and ordering hits and he goes in as one of his favorite parts
[13:44.480 --> 13:48.880]  of the day he does it at least once a week sometimes every day and he goes in
[13:48.880 --> 13:54.440]  and looks at people and gives the death orders he he signs death orders and even
[13:54.440 --> 13:57.600]  if he was doing that and it wasn't violating international law and they
[13:57.600 --> 14:01.120]  weren't really just trying to stir up Pakistan and other areas to get in
[14:01.120 --> 14:06.280]  internal wars going between Shiite and Sunni and others even if if it was
[14:06.280 --> 14:10.080]  legitimate you don't sit there and go you know I'm really good at killing
[14:10.080 --> 14:14.560]  people close quotes and see I've talked about this a lot we need to pull this up
[14:14.560 --> 14:19.840]  there was a New York Times article there's also one on on Carl Rove saying
[14:19.840 --> 14:23.640]  there's a New York Times Washington Post and I think was New Yorker magazine
[14:23.640 --> 14:26.920]  and people are all together at a and they were so afraid of them they wouldn't
[14:26.920 --> 14:30.120]  even say that he was one that said it till years later they said a White House
[14:30.120 --> 14:34.760]  aid a high-level aid said we control reality we can lie however we want no
[14:34.760 --> 14:37.880]  one can stop us and the media will do ever we say you're out of a job I
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.080]  literally rule you you're pathetic and so even though they were ego maniac
[14:42.080 --> 14:45.000]  establishment journalists who thought they were part of the power structure
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.880]  they still went out and attacked him because it made them feel bad to hear
[14:48.880 --> 14:53.320]  they were obsolete but that's the end game of tyranny and the delusion of
[14:53.320 --> 14:58.240]  tyranny when you give into it but it was Richard Pearl known as the angel of
[14:58.240 --> 15:06.000]  death at the Pentagon because he's just a fat pasty weird demonic person who is
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.680]  always into killing people and well I mean how do you get a nickname like the
[15:08.680 --> 15:13.080]  angel of death well the angel of death Richard Pearl was another one of these
[15:13.080 --> 15:20.200]  cocktail parties and walked up right after the 2003 Iraq invasion started and
[15:20.200 --> 15:27.400]  he walked up to a group of good-looking female reporters and that's how they
[15:27.400 --> 15:32.760]  were described and said you know I'm powerful I'm behind this war I kill
[15:32.760 --> 15:36.920]  tens of thousands with a signature and they were and even though they were all
[15:36.920 --> 15:42.760]  evil and part of the Empire and part of the lies they were just like it was they
[15:42.760 --> 15:46.920]  all walked away from him imagine a guy with all that power and been in
[15:46.920 --> 15:51.640]  Washington so long he thinks the way you pick up women is walking up to them
[15:51.640 --> 15:57.200]  and saying you know I kill people every day by signing orders I kill a lot of
[15:57.200 --> 16:04.880]  people you can pull up the exact quote but the point is imagine imagine I mean
[16:04.880 --> 16:09.160]  if you were the guy who was in special forces and had to run up to a base camp
[16:09.160 --> 16:13.040]  and slit guards throats and stuff and then blew up a barracks or something
[16:13.040 --> 16:18.720]  those are still human beings you kill and unless you you know caught them
[16:18.720 --> 16:23.320]  torturing children or something you you you want to kill them as quickly and
[16:23.320 --> 16:26.400]  painlessly as possible and even if you caught them doing something horrible
[16:26.400 --> 16:30.480]  they're more like a cockroach you're not proud of having to step on it it's just
[16:30.480 --> 16:37.680]  got to be done and it's just the opposite of manliness the opposite of honor it is
[16:37.680 --> 16:43.320]  disgusting and that's who they are they're a bunch of guys Obama writes in
[16:43.320 --> 16:48.720]  one excerpt of one of his books I read years ago about how oh I've never really
[16:48.720 --> 16:53.320]  been in fights or I never I never you know I was a total piece growing up who
[16:53.320 --> 16:56.760]  knows me that's true but most these guys come from very wealthy powerful
[16:56.760 --> 17:01.160]  families or establishment families cloistered and they're not around the
[17:01.160 --> 17:06.800]  real world and it shows like when George Bush Sr. a decade after grocery store
[17:06.800 --> 17:11.360]  scanners where I think was in 1989 he comes in to a safe way and goes what is
[17:11.360 --> 17:17.000]  that what is that boy because he hadn't gone to get his own food or been to a
[17:17.000 --> 17:23.640]  grocery store in so long so disconnected from reality I mean I've gone to a
[17:23.640 --> 17:27.120]  grocery store many times when I've been out in LA with pretty big Hollywood
[17:27.120 --> 17:32.480]  stars probably more than 15 or so because you mean they just put on a hat
[17:32.480 --> 17:35.660]  let's go to the store let's go get some beer and some steaks and stuff let's
[17:35.660 --> 17:41.160]  cook them those are people worth you know in some cases fifty million a hundred
[17:41.160 --> 17:44.600]  million dollars and they're cooking their own food because they enjoy it
[17:44.600 --> 17:50.640]  they're going to the store themselves imagine imagine George Herbert Walker
[17:50.640 --> 17:55.680]  Bush at least a decade after scanners are ubiquitous doesn't know what one was
[17:55.680 --> 18:00.360]  it was later questioned about it and said no I just learned about this it's
[18:00.360 --> 18:06.840]  just like the head of Google gets told about big technological developments
[18:06.840 --> 18:11.040]  and and things that are going on and like like bit Bitcoin I'm know what
[18:11.040 --> 18:17.960]  Bitcoin is for four years doesn't know what Bitcoin is and it was later asked
[18:17.960 --> 18:23.040]  and you know I really don't know but now I do they got into power because they're
[18:23.040 --> 18:27.560]  part of the club but they didn't get there because of their science their
[18:27.560 --> 18:32.080]  beauty their literature their art they weren't put there because we collectively
[18:32.080 --> 18:36.760]  want them there as an idol basically I don't mean that the blasphemy way but
[18:36.760 --> 18:41.320]  you know as a model of what we want to aspire to instead these social engineers
[18:41.320 --> 18:47.000]  put out fake models in front of us fake idols so that we aspire to failure and
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.640]  they sabotage culture and that's one of their greatest sins is is putting out
[18:51.640 --> 18:57.080]  destructive art types destructive role models for people to sabotage the
[18:57.080 --> 19:02.760]  collective humanity so they can rule us that is not a leadership that is not an
[19:02.760 --> 19:08.440]  honorable group that is an enemy fundamentally of humanity who hates
[19:08.440 --> 19:12.480]  themselves so much they believe they are obsolete and are going to merge with
[19:12.480 --> 19:17.280]  machines and kill the rest of us no you will not get away with it things are
[19:17.280 --> 19:20.600]  going to get really nasty in the process and a lot of us aren't going to make it
[19:20.600 --> 19:25.600]  through this but in the final equation in my gut in my spirit at my bedrock I
[19:25.600 --> 19:30.440]  know humanity is going to make it and God has bigger plans for us and he's not
[19:30.440 --> 19:36.080]  going to let these devils and that's what they are destroy incredible things
[19:36.080 --> 19:42.560]  that God has in store for humanity we are made in the image of the creator we
[19:42.560 --> 19:50.480]  are creators look at how we create the devil is never a maker these satanists
[19:50.480 --> 19:56.200]  can only destroy it's all they know they are the enemy and those of us that
[19:56.200 --> 20:02.200]  love peace have to be prepared to defeat them every day it becomes more clear
[20:02.200 --> 20:06.120]  our nation is headed towards an uncertain future nothing can ensure your
[20:06.120 --> 20:10.360]  family security like an Atlas survival shelter the strongest money can buy and
[20:10.360 --> 20:14.520]  designed to be buried up to 42 feet deep with all the comforts of home and all

[23:52.440 --> 24:08.880]  essential to prepare with my patriot supply today
[24:22.440 --> 24:30.840]  I'm gonna cover a bunch of news right now and then I want to open the phones up
[24:30.840 --> 24:34.680]  for first-time callers yet again first-time callers your chance to be
[24:34.680 --> 24:44.000]  involved on the transmission 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 with the wild card of all
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.200]  the different issues that the callers bring up the different angles and areas
[24:48.200 --> 24:52.360]  they take us into I love the randomness of it so that's why we introduce it
[24:52.360 --> 24:59.240]  here on the broadcast with the open phones on any topic 800-259-9231 the
[24:59.240 --> 25:04.600]  reason we wrote about this last week and I'm glad CBS News has picked it up is
[25:04.600 --> 25:09.080]  that it's the power of the artist and the power of parody and the power of free
[25:09.080 --> 25:16.120]  speech against the system is what will bring it down and that's why many a
[25:16.120 --> 25:22.480]  Roman Caesar was brought down by the political graffiti written on the walls
[25:22.480 --> 25:26.320]  and it said that the words of the prophets are written on the subway
[25:26.320 --> 25:33.320]  walls this is a right and a duty to engage in public speech especially when
[25:33.320 --> 25:37.800]  there is tyranny you've got to get out there and resist it you've got to get
[25:37.800 --> 25:40.680]  out there and speak out against it and when they try to shut down your free
[25:40.680 --> 25:45.280]  speech you've got to re-double it in fact I think I'm gonna come out with the
[25:45.280 --> 25:49.560]  next issue of the magazine with free bumper stickers in it again
[25:49.560 --> 25:55.560]  criticizing the TSA and the NSA and when the TSA said if you laugh at us we're
[25:55.560 --> 26:00.120]  going to arrest you I had announced to the guys that I wanted to have another
[26:00.120 --> 26:07.040]  $10,000 film price for making films either comedy or serious exposing the
[26:07.040 --> 26:12.800]  TSA and I'm just scared of watching the hundreds of videos because I mean I love
[26:12.800 --> 26:16.200]  watching them it just takes over our whole operation to have a contest so I
[26:16.200 --> 26:20.800]  decided not to do it but but you know what I'm on the razor's edge right now
[26:20.800 --> 26:24.360]  I was gonna have just Kit Daniels run the contest so we're not all doing it
[26:24.360 --> 26:28.160]  well he and let him pick I guess just randomly here Kit you're in charge let's
[26:28.160 --> 26:33.880]  see what you do he's a smart guy but I think it is just vital in fact I will
[26:33.880 --> 26:39.040]  by sometime next week we'll announce a month or two film contest one prize
[26:39.040 --> 26:46.880]  $10,000 for a parody or a news report it can be anything a free speech event
[26:46.880 --> 26:54.360]  covering the TSA and the NSA or either or you can do one of them or you can do
[26:54.360 --> 26:59.480]  both of them in a piece and we'll see how they like that because oh you're
[26:59.480 --> 27:03.320]  gonna put me on a list how about we're all on the list and then we know who the
[27:03.320 --> 27:07.560]  enemies are the people that aren't on the list see how that works you know God's
[27:07.560 --> 27:12.440]  got a list and you devils that violate our rights and violate our liberties
[27:12.440 --> 27:16.740]  wonder who's list you're on you think you're omnipresent you think you're
[27:16.740 --> 27:21.080]  playing the part of God you've tried to say Snowden's a demon Snowden's horrible
[27:21.080 --> 27:25.920]  now the whole NSA grid is in trouble and the Europeans tried to blame America like
[27:25.920 --> 27:29.240]  like they weren't doing it now it comes out they had agreements just like all
[27:29.240 --> 27:34.440]  our NSA whistleblowers told us they're all doing it because the only scapegoat
[27:34.440 --> 27:39.320]  here is to say it's the US government is the only one or the head of this the
[27:39.320 --> 27:44.840]  US government is run by a national security group of corporate interests
[27:44.840 --> 27:49.520]  that have hijacked us via the National Security Council on record people like
[27:49.520 --> 27:55.200]  George Schultz and others and they are running the show here and they are
[27:55.200 --> 28:00.480]  running the economy down the drain on purpose to consolidate it and then
[28:00.480 --> 28:05.400]  saying we're criminals if we speak out against them I mean imagine telling a
[28:05.400 --> 28:08.760]  graphic artist we're gonna sue you we're gonna arrest you for copyright
[28:08.760 --> 28:14.240]  infringement when the NSA knows putting out t-shirts that are parodies of the
[28:14.240 --> 28:22.880]  NSA is the most protected speech it is political parody is the highest level
[28:22.880 --> 28:28.800]  did you know the FCC loses fines if the profanity is aired in a documentary
[28:28.800 --> 28:33.360]  you ever heard MPR and wonder why you hear cuss words sometimes on MPR because
[28:33.360 --> 28:37.720]  they can say oh it's part of a documentary this was really said you see I
[28:37.720 --> 28:41.000]  could get up here if I was reading a court transcript and say cuss words I
[28:41.000 --> 28:47.080]  just choose not to do it because it is political analysis and a news report it
[28:47.080 --> 28:51.920]  can be judged profane if you're targeting children with something and then
[28:51.920 --> 28:58.200]  they take that and misappropriate it to all free speech so the point is this is
[28:58.200 --> 29:03.480]  absolute total fraud there's Steve Watson's article from October 30th last
[29:03.480 --> 29:09.520]  week at info wars.com free speech t-shirt maker threatened by NSA DHS
[29:09.520 --> 29:14.280]  fights back with lawsuit suing agencies for violation of the First Amendment and
[29:14.280 --> 29:20.040]  you scroll down you can see his thought crime that he's committed looks nothing
[29:20.040 --> 29:23.960]  like the Department of Homeland Security logo but but it's clear that it's a
[29:23.960 --> 29:30.520]  parody of the NSA it's not that he was masquerading as the NSA it's that he was
[29:30.520 --> 29:36.920]  criticizing them raping our rights abusing us and so we're gonna launch a
[29:36.920 --> 29:42.840]  contest on the NSA and the TSA for 10 grand and I'm gonna come out with a
[29:42.840 --> 29:46.960]  t-shirt with the NSA on the front or the back and the TSA on the other side
[29:46.960 --> 29:51.800]  criticizing both groups we've done it before we're on the March the Empire's
[29:51.800 --> 29:57.080]  all got to stand together Alex Jones I've got to fight back radio network news

[33:15.240 --> 33:28.680]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show people
[33:28.680 --> 33:31.520]  who knew the law as it was being written knew the president wasn't telling the
[33:31.520 --> 33:35.160]  truth the grandfather provision written into the law itself was too narrow and
[33:35.160 --> 33:38.840]  frankly they wrote a regulation intentionally trying to get people out
[33:38.840 --> 33:42.840]  of the individual market they want the people to go into the exchanges because
[33:42.840 --> 33:45.320]  there's a lot of people in the individual market the whole point of the
[33:45.320 --> 33:48.720]  exchanges is to close down the individual insurance market the insurance
[33:48.720 --> 33:55.040]  company one of millions of people into the insurance companies don't like
[33:55.040 --> 33:58.520]  the individual market as it's constructed they see the future that
[33:58.520 --> 34:01.880]  individual market is going away they don't want to invest in it that's why
[34:01.880 --> 34:09.200]  president so there is the architect of it and we told you and we had medical
[34:09.200 --> 34:13.320]  doctors on and others who'd read the legislation to tell you it was designed
[34:13.320 --> 34:19.080]  to destroy individual health care systems kick you off of it increase the
[34:19.080 --> 34:23.840]  price give trillions of dollars over the next decade to offshore insurance
[34:23.840 --> 34:29.400]  companies owned by globalist banks lower the standard of care and set the
[34:29.400 --> 34:33.680]  precedent for a global tax to the banks that's who owns the big insurance
[34:33.680 --> 34:38.160]  companies on average the big mega banks and allow those big mega banks to shut
[34:38.160 --> 34:42.000]  down small insurance companies and banks that's what all the banking reform
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.400]  bills have been that's what all the stimulus acts and all the banker bailout
[34:46.400 --> 34:51.800]  plans and all the stress test garbage the head of the Texas Banking
[34:51.800 --> 34:55.440]  Association two years ago I read his letter that I saw in the Austin
[34:55.440 --> 34:59.640]  Business Journal it was in newspapers all of the state I read his letter on
[34:59.640 --> 35:05.520]  air where he said this is a monopoly a takeover to shut down competition
[35:05.520 --> 35:11.640]  dealing with these new banking regulations and stress test because the
[35:11.640 --> 35:16.440]  big banks basically wrote the regulations and are exempt and it's the
[35:16.440 --> 35:21.760]  same thing with Obamacare we are watching a mafia takeover and we've
[35:21.760 --> 35:24.880]  always had corrupt elites I mean the world's never a perfect place but I
[35:24.880 --> 35:29.680]  mean these people have an instinct to want to hurt all of us they don't want
[35:29.680 --> 35:34.080]  to just skim off the top and have a big fat economy no no they want to be the
[35:34.080 --> 35:41.040]  only ones that got the fat all you get is living in a ditch when they're done
[35:41.040 --> 35:46.080]  and these people are so sick and all their camp followers and all their
[35:46.080 --> 35:53.360]  minions and all their supporters are incalculably wicked and it is so
[35:53.360 --> 35:56.600]  disgusting to see this and speaking of attacks on free speech you don't just
[35:56.600 --> 36:00.360]  have the NSA and Homeland Security threatening to fine or arrest someone
[36:00.360 --> 36:04.640]  who does a parody saying the NSA is the only part of government that actually
[36:04.640 --> 36:10.800]  listens a t-shirt that says that and then has an American Eagle logo on it
[36:10.800 --> 36:17.640]  and it says peeping while you're sleeping clearly like shirts I've seen
[36:17.640 --> 36:23.520]  that say CIA cocaine importation agency under them because that's what it is it
[36:23.520 --> 36:28.160]  is the cocaine importation agency it imports cocaine and exports small
[36:28.160 --> 36:35.040]  children to hostile torture chambers on record I've got news on that today CPS
[36:35.040 --> 36:38.680]  kids in England being taken and raped and tortured that's mainstream news
[36:38.680 --> 36:44.040]  cover up of VIPs who abuse children in care well yeah they don't just abuse
[36:44.040 --> 36:49.360]  them it's come out they kill them when they dig up the little skeletons
[36:49.360 --> 36:54.440]  there's a everything's shut up about it because after all people are like oh my
[36:54.440 --> 36:58.760]  gosh don't talk about this oh yeah so they can just keep doing it right because
[36:58.760 --> 37:02.720]  you know they are so evil they see a child and don't want to protect them
[37:02.720 --> 37:06.400]  don't want to be sweet to them don't want to empower them and nurture them no
[37:06.400 --> 37:08.960]  they want to rape them and then torture them to death and scare the hell out of
[37:08.960 --> 37:13.280]  them and suck their soul out and and vampirically feed on the terror and the
[37:13.280 --> 37:17.600]  suffering of children just like the public school system since 1990 has
[37:17.600 --> 37:21.400]  taught nationwide how to get in coffins how to be rolled up in blankets to learn
[37:21.400 --> 37:26.120]  how to die and they play spaceship and lifeboat where only seven kids can live
[37:26.120 --> 37:30.200]  in the group but there's ten on the boat so if you then the social engineer
[37:30.200 --> 37:35.440]  pamphlet tells them if they're a bureaucrat they survive but if they're a
[37:35.440 --> 37:41.920]  homophobe they're thrown off the boat to be killed this is hardcore reeducation
[37:41.920 --> 37:46.200]  camp brainwashing and then you wonder why within a year of that program being
[37:46.200 --> 37:53.920]  put in a 1990 tripling in the suicides 2020 ABC news 2020 and now they've
[37:53.920 --> 37:58.280]  tripled or quadrupled it again on top of that so where suicide is just
[37:58.280 --> 38:03.120]  epidemic in the schools and the answer is constant brainwashing on how to do it
[38:03.120 --> 38:09.400]  and the teachers and principals now even really know this but it's like so much
[38:09.400 --> 38:13.160]  fun to have people killing themselves and it's such a pity party and it's so
[38:13.160 --> 38:17.080]  fun that it's all and they're in there drugging the kids and we got to have
[38:17.080 --> 38:22.320]  psychological valuation now oh my gosh more suicides more more kids killing
[38:22.320 --> 38:25.960]  themselves more little kids oh well we'll drug them all then the suicides
[38:25.960 --> 38:29.640]  increase more drugging suicides increase more drugging and they're right
[38:29.640 --> 38:34.040]  there in front of you murdering your children with psych warfare the most
[38:34.040 --> 38:39.600]  savage mind control operating right out in front of everyone with savage
[38:39.600 --> 38:46.880]  programming and savage victory over us just like I went to that just to give
[38:46.880 --> 38:50.440]  you an example of social conditioning and I'm not saying Russell Brand is doing
[38:50.440 --> 38:54.960]  this but it's an example of why I should follow popular culture more it just makes
[38:54.960 --> 38:59.360]  me so sick most of it unless someone's using it to wake folks up like Russell
[38:59.360 --> 39:03.120]  Brand is doing at least at some levels and he's a listener and follows us on
[39:03.120 --> 39:06.040]  Twitter that's how found out he was a listener from David I can then contact
[39:06.040 --> 39:09.560]  him and sure enough helped wake him up to a certain degree set on air and also
[39:09.560 --> 39:19.520]  as much offer and I get to the event and I get in at the end of it that was a
[39:19.520 --> 39:22.400]  whole other story I've told on air but the point is I get in there and he's
[39:22.400 --> 39:29.280]  doing the you know signing of stuff and there's hundreds of women down there and
[39:29.280 --> 39:36.800]  about half of them are Katy Perry look likes and then as he signed their thing
[39:36.800 --> 39:41.760]  turned them down for a date and said sorry love I've got a girlfriend and as
[39:41.760 --> 39:47.320]  they walked away they looked distraught and and and and like freaked out they
[39:47.320 --> 39:51.200]  actually thought they were gonna dress up like Katy Perry and that they were
[39:51.200 --> 39:58.640]  gonna become Katy Perry if they got the man who was married to Katy Perry that's
[39:58.640 --> 40:03.920]  just like if if Kim Kardashian's dating one type of guy all the women in the
[40:03.920 --> 40:07.160]  trendy new areas of New York and LA go out and get that guy and then when she
[40:07.160 --> 40:10.400]  goes out with another type of guy then they all go out and dress the same put
[40:10.400 --> 40:16.600]  the same glasses on and do that and then imagine that they are Kim Kardashian see
[40:16.600 --> 40:20.960]  that's mind control and you know what if it sells records and sells products
[40:20.960 --> 40:25.920]  that's one thing but it's the messages they tag onto that most women aren't
[40:25.920 --> 40:29.160]  gonna make millions of dollars doing a sex tape you're gonna end up ruining your
[40:29.160 --> 40:34.120]  career most women going out and finding some thug that knows how to dress like
[40:34.120 --> 40:38.480]  someone that's famous knows that they're manipulating airhead women that
[40:38.480 --> 40:43.760]  believe they're signing on to some fantasy so you're being conned you're
[40:43.760 --> 40:49.040]  being given false dreams false dreams that don't lead to anything liberty and
[40:49.040 --> 40:54.120]  family and being honorable and being strong and being successful and being
[40:54.120 --> 40:59.240]  vicious when people try to enslave you that leads to success that leads to
[40:59.240 --> 41:06.160]  civilization not buying into all this so so there's a few examples right there I
[41:06.160 --> 41:13.120]  went out interviewing behind stage went out the back with him to say bye and
[41:13.120 --> 41:18.960]  there were women that had gone around the back of the building to see him and
[41:18.960 --> 41:25.440]  his security leave and he drove off and a lot of the people that were there you
[41:25.440 --> 41:28.440]  know we're they're not we're listeners of my or hi Alex are you doing but
[41:28.440 --> 41:31.920]  suddenly these women and Anthony good shard he was with me so was it was a
[41:31.920 --> 41:36.600]  Jacobson and Rob do these women all turn to me follow us and they go you know him
[41:36.600 --> 41:41.880]  and just because I knew him they wanted to go home with me and I said hey I'm
[41:41.880 --> 41:45.920]  married honey I have a good night we had to literally push these women off of us
[41:45.920 --> 41:52.520]  and folks that's because they believe that that Russell brand is is is like
[41:52.520 --> 41:57.080]  Prince Charming and is going to kiss them and awaken them out of their sleep
[41:57.080 --> 42:04.040]  of death like Sleeping Beauty or like Snow White when the world is all around
[42:04.040 --> 42:09.520]  them success and beauty and good things and friendship is all around them but
[42:09.520 --> 42:14.360]  they're chasing that a losatory idea and while they're chasing that all the real
[42:14.360 --> 42:17.480]  freedoms being stolen from them right in front of their eyes and they don't
[42:17.480 --> 42:22.760]  even take it personally and the reason I tell this whole story is just to
[42:22.760 --> 42:27.840]  understand human psychology imagine now 10 and 11 year old girls that's the main
[42:27.840 --> 42:32.920]  group committing suicide who never committed suicide in history the system
[42:32.920 --> 42:41.760]  new from young unmarried women watching Shakespearean plays about suicide like
[42:41.760 --> 42:47.640]  Romeo and Juliet they knew now now I know from the psych warfare they're doing
[42:47.640 --> 42:50.440]  it on purpose to make people kill themselves to create a culture of death
[42:50.440 --> 42:56.040]  that's on record but but I just have read the historical examples of the Romeo
[42:56.040 --> 43:00.320]  and Juliet women after seeing the play going and killing themselves because it
[43:00.320 --> 43:03.640]  touched them so much to like feel like they were part of that and that love
[43:03.640 --> 43:09.600]  hit them at such a point that they were so impressionable and so suggestible
[43:09.600 --> 43:15.440]  basically hypnotized by the play that they would kill themselves but Shakespeare
[43:15.440 --> 43:19.200]  I will guarantee you the group of writers that wrote under the gnome
[43:19.200 --> 43:23.520]  to plume Shakespeare had no idea that was happening probably didn't know that
[43:23.520 --> 43:28.680]  was gonna happen today the psych warfare chiefs know and they've been doing this
[43:28.680 --> 43:37.360]  now for 22 years 23 years they have been killing little girls in schools in
[43:37.360 --> 43:41.520]  every school district murdering them and then and it's like a domino effect if
[43:41.520 --> 43:44.800]  they can get one to kill themselves then more and more will kill themselves and I
[43:44.800 --> 43:47.800]  know I talked about this last last Friday and the reason I'm back on it is
[43:47.800 --> 43:51.680]  I'd forgotten about that because I mean there's so much evil so many programs of
[43:51.680 --> 43:57.880]  mind control so many programs of manipulation through the fad driven
[43:57.880 --> 44:02.280]  economy through this programming system you know cigarette makers came to
[44:02.280 --> 44:06.520]  Edward Bernays the grandson of Sigmund Freud in the 20s and they said we can't
[44:06.520 --> 44:12.840]  get women to smoke it's not seen as Ladylike women smoke cigars in private
[44:12.840 --> 44:15.480]  that's why they have a piece of paper around that's pretty she argues to be
[44:15.480 --> 44:21.360]  for women and you've helped us sell cigars to men is cool how do we get
[44:21.360 --> 44:25.720]  women to smoke cigarettes he goes fund the suffrage movement and tell them
[44:25.720 --> 44:30.000]  it's radical and cool if they smoke cigarettes and you'll get them and
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.920]  within a decade more women smoke than men and they funded Hollywood and others
[44:35.920 --> 44:40.360]  this is all psych warfare and they tell you you go to CVS you go to Walgreens
[44:40.360 --> 44:45.640]  get your flu shot 20% off get 20% off everything in the store because they
[44:45.640 --> 44:51.680]  love you folks that's why they want to do that and then later in the 60s you've
[44:51.680 --> 44:57.840]  come a long way baby Virginia Slims and then all the proud feminist smoked
[44:57.840 --> 45:01.720]  Virginia Slims to this day going on their respirators because they showed
[45:01.720 --> 45:06.480]  the men you've come a long way baby that's right now you get to work two
[45:06.480 --> 45:11.120]  three jobs the men aren't men anymore societies collapsing your your children
[45:11.120 --> 45:15.400]  on drugs the society's imploding they're always strong women that worked in
[45:15.400 --> 45:18.880]  business and did things if they wanted to but see now the state is over the
[45:18.880 --> 45:22.400]  children now women don't want to have children because they got to make it
[45:22.400 --> 45:26.680]  they got to become successful and all they see is then the poor down trodden
[45:26.680 --> 45:40.360]  dumbed-down folks having a dozen kids it is like reverse eugenics or something
[45:43.000 --> 45:48.240]  now getting back to the Affordable Care Act and then I'm gonna go to your phone
[45:48.240 --> 45:53.840]  calls and cover more than is the next hour and there's a lot of it they they
[45:53.840 --> 45:58.520]  knew what they were doing it's all in record and and am I getting an apology
[45:58.520 --> 46:01.520]  from all the folks that said I was a conspiracy terrorist and a racist on
[46:01.520 --> 46:06.320]  MSNBC because it was racist to not support Obama care I see it's not that
[46:06.320 --> 46:09.840]  I didn't want Obama care cuz I know it was a screw job it was because Obama is
[46:09.840 --> 46:15.080]  black see and I'm gonna be honest I picked up some breakfast tacos this
[46:15.080 --> 46:18.960]  morning that were in a brown bag so in Seattle I'm a racist as well again it's
[46:18.960 --> 46:21.800]  all about putting the guilt off on to me like I've done something putting the
[46:21.800 --> 46:29.640]  guilt off on to you but then meanwhile it's not just that you can't have a
[46:32.680 --> 46:36.000]  t-shirt making fun of the NSA according to them of course they're gonna get
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.800]  sued now and defeated they're being sued you fight back folks or they set the
[46:39.800 --> 46:44.960]  precedent no Twitter keeps suspending account critical of Obama care yeah I
[46:44.960 --> 46:47.480]  mean if you put accounts out for the second amendment they shut them down
[46:47.480 --> 46:51.280]  Twitter Facebook you name it and it's just gotten to where it's no big deal
[46:51.280 --> 46:55.520]  oh yeah you criticize the system the account my
[46:55.520 --> 47:00.520]  cancellation was just getting started when she was suspended it twice before
[47:00.520 --> 47:07.360]  reinstating the account late Saturday afternoon because she spoke out the
[47:07.360 --> 47:11.080]  purpose of my cancellation comm was to allow some of the millions of Americans
[47:11.080 --> 47:14.520]  who were losing their health insurance to post pictures of themselves with their
[47:14.520 --> 47:19.200]  cancellation letters yeah I'll guarantee you folks the White House watches this
[47:19.200 --> 47:24.160]  runs Twitter runs Facebook they brag on record they do just like Hayden ten
[47:24.160 --> 47:28.440]  minutes into a rant was on a train going yeah I ordered torture I ordered
[47:28.440 --> 47:32.440]  killing and they got tweeting everything he's saying he's talking he's bragging
[47:32.440 --> 47:37.240]  how he runs rendition and torture operations and black sites and within
[47:37.240 --> 47:40.920]  ten minutes they call him and go sir there's a man listening to your reporter
[47:40.920 --> 47:44.440]  and they turn and there's the reporter and Hayden comes over and try and it's
[47:44.440 --> 47:48.760]  the same thing Clinton bragged about killing people the angel of death Richard
[47:48.760 --> 47:53.160]  Pearl bragged about killing people at teeth at dinner parties a martini
[47:53.160 --> 47:58.200]  parties cocktail parties looking for the right word Obama brags around the
[47:58.200 --> 48:02.120]  White House yeah I'm good at killing people yeah it's real manly to walk
[48:02.120 --> 48:08.000]  into your oval office and sit back with your feet up on the desk and they sir do
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.840]  you want to kill this person sir do you want to kill that person we're gonna
[48:10.840 --> 48:14.880]  blow up a whole wedding party to get this one guy that it really al-qaeda he's
[48:14.880 --> 48:17.520]  actually fighting al-qaeda so we're gonna kill him that's really who they kill
[48:17.520 --> 48:23.400]  and imagine just oh my pretty manly I can you imagine folks I mean if I'd been
[48:23.400 --> 48:25.680]  in the military and killed a bunch of people I know a lot of folks that have
[48:25.680 --> 48:28.320]  they never talk about it they don't want to talk about it they get really
[48:28.320 --> 48:32.400]  irritated if you want to make them talk about it because it's just a lot there's
[48:32.400 --> 48:35.720]  a lot of reasons and obviously by this been around that knows why or done it
[48:35.720 --> 48:42.520]  it's the opposite it's like so cowardly to sit there giving the orders to kill
[48:42.520 --> 48:48.320]  people and then to get off on it and again it is the essence of who these
[48:48.320 --> 48:51.440]  scumbags are we're gonna go to Brighton come back but
[48:51.440 --> 48:55.720]  Obamacare site goes offline for extended maintenance and Obama comes out
[48:55.720 --> 49:02.040]  with a speech saying well just go there and sign up just like he said hey don't
[49:02.040 --> 49:05.720]  worry you don't like being being groped by the TSA and I like the body scanners
[49:05.720 --> 49:09.080]  remembering that state of the Union he goes you can ride a train and him and
[49:09.080 --> 49:13.240]  Biden laughed because they just given the order a month before it was a
[49:13.240 --> 49:18.440]  presidential directive to roll the TSA out on the streets and that's why Biden
[49:18.440 --> 49:25.320]  was like it's all a big joke we're gonna give these smugs free healthcare
[49:25.320 --> 49:30.840]  tell them another one of these idiots these are eugenicists but in cancer
[49:30.840 --> 49:35.480]  viruses and all the vaccines on record all the major vaccine types but in
[49:35.480 --> 49:40.560]  sterile incentive all on record killing us it's a big folks they sit in there
[49:40.560 --> 49:44.680]  talking about how they go to out in public and look at how sick you are
[49:44.680 --> 49:48.440]  they brag in their own publications we've about how they're teaching kids to
[49:48.440 --> 49:52.760]  kill themselves in Europe now they go oh we took parental rights away kids can
[49:52.760 --> 49:57.000]  divorce their parents at age five now we can if you want to kill yourself for
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.560]  the earth remember in Australia about a decade ago they said eight years ago
[50:01.560 --> 50:04.920]  they had video games teaching the kids that animals die unless they commit
[50:04.920 --> 50:10.040]  suicide abc news of Australia covered it not affiliate with our abc news with
[50:10.040 --> 50:15.080]  the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and and the news was like does it go
[50:15.080 --> 50:19.160]  too far that it shows baby animals having their heads chopped off in fact
[50:19.160 --> 50:24.280]  people won't believe this search engine video game teaches kids when to die
[50:24.280 --> 50:29.040]  carbon credit info wars.com and it shows little animals having their heads
[50:29.040 --> 50:32.680]  chopped off and blood spurting and they show these the seven-year-olds and they
[50:32.680 --> 50:36.040]  teach them do you want to kill yourself and now it comes in they go your
[50:36.040 --> 50:40.960]  daughter decided to kill herself today she has parental we have the parental

[55:00.480 --> 55:04.920]  talked to parents they say after going to public schools and private schools
[55:04.920 --> 55:07.240]  where they teach them that humans are bad for the earth when they see a
[55:07.240 --> 55:11.120]  construction site the little girls start crying I was talking to one mother
[55:11.120 --> 55:17.320]  and saying oh my gosh they're killing the bunnies I need to die and and this is
[55:17.320 --> 55:22.360]  teaching you instead of having a life force and a will to survive and a value
[55:22.360 --> 55:27.000]  of life you're being taught your total crud so you'll roll over so the globalists
[55:27.000 --> 55:30.880]  can run everything they don't even want to help the earth on top of it this is

[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.680]  well folks the architect of Obamacare has told us what we already know and it
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.840]  shows their hubris their arrogance they're having Twitter accounts suspended
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.920]  that criticize Obamacare where people post photos of their cancellation letters
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:51.880]  or getting letters that their their fees have gone up 539 percent and that's
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:57.320]  because we do have power to organize and expose this criminal fraud but it
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.880]  doesn't matter Ezekiel Emanuel who is the main architect of all the people
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:04.240]  involved he's one of the main architects Dashel Tom Dashel was an architect he
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.920]  wrote a book saying have death panels kill old people I read the quotes on

[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:23.440]  been gullible morons the sooner you can start figuring this out before they
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:28.720]  shut everything off and we don't have any hope because we're getting right down
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:33.640]  to that area okay and I care about everybody but I'm sick of not being a
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:37.900]  racist and not being a tribalist and being for a fair shake and then watch
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:41.760]  all the politically correct people who are really anti-liberty many cases
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:46.600]  anti-white you name it sit there and attack me all day because of what color
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:50.840]  I am and what I stand for and say I'm a racist or I'm a terrorist the globalists
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:54.680]  really want to get us fighting with each other and I want folks to grow up
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:58.480]  and realize what's really happening I'm sick of it and I'm sick of political
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.960]  correctness it's a bunch of tyranny let's go to patent Florida you're on the
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.520]  air go ahead how you doing Alex this weekend this weekend that was at an
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.240]  event up in Lakeland and there was a lot of members of both keepers as well
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:16.600]  CCOM and a lot of military and ex-military and I started talking to a
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.280]  group of them and one of the guys I said to him I said are you aware of the 45
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:26.160]  generals that have been purged as well as the 197 officers and he said yes we're
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.080]  well aware of it and there's a lot of rumors in the military that a general
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:35.240]  had ordered those nukes that were taken and they were dumped off the coast of
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:42.600]  South Carolina and disposed of and I went on the USGS.gov website and on
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.200]  the eighth of last month there was a major event that went on and they don't
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.760]  show a lot of information about this and I saw another cover story it was in
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:56.880]  mainstream news like AP a month ago right it was like oh expect nukes that
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.720]  aren't refurbished or dismantled to detonate and that's basically impossible
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.800]  from the nuclear engineers and folks I've talked to the way those work and so
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:10.920]  doesn't even have the priming or the or the activator in it like basically once
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:15.280]  once it's primed and prepared with keys other things it then slides in be able
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:19.080]  to detonate the TNT or the plastic explosives that then blast in depending
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.440]  on the type of weapon but but tell me more about what the military folks were
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:27.720]  telling you well this was then we went on to some more stuff and one of the guys
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:33.120]  said that he works in construction has been going in a lot of homes throughout
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.720]  Florida and that when he goes in he sees a lot of food and stuff and says oh you
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:41.480]  know are you preparing you know and thinking they're a patriot and he's
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.640]  saying that he's running into a lot of people that are preparing to fight
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.320]  patriots and I was shocked because I haven't heard that one no it's true
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.400]  look listen they're making their move because the the communist and that's
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.000]  what they are it's foreign banks that are above the law and exempt just like
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.520]  with 1917 they use commies to take over and they use communist strategy because
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:06.280]  that was created by the very same banks were fighting today over a hundred years
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.600]  ago this is all on historical record by the way and congressional testimony
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:14.120]  people can look it up Cleon Skelzen's book the naked communist quotes the
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:20.680]  congressional sources but the point is is that is that they use communist it
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:26.400]  isn't communism they use communists to take over and yes they had petitions on
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.800]  the White House site that had like 50,000 signatures to form communist
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.440]  militias to take out the Tea Party I mean look they intend to shut stuff off
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:39.440]  use the half the public on welfare they believe is gonna basically hold everyone
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:44.720]  hostage for the takeover what else did they say about that well I mean a lot
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:49.680]  of people in the military getting very concerned and I actually know one of
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:52.280]  the guys that I want to hear more about this we're gonna come back to you to
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.000]  finish up what your military source was saying whether it was rumor whether he
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.560]  had real intel on those nukes being jumped in the ocean Alex Jones here with
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:05.800]  a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the entire planetary
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:10.600]  economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is to shut down
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:15.720]  societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover

[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:12.520]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:20.040]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.480]  Alex Jones.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:39.840]  Collectivism is very very simple Tyrone became corrupt and finally collapsed
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:43.600]  went from a republic to an empire and then degenerated broken to and then
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:49.160]  finally completely collapsed is because politicians quickly learned they could
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:54.400]  get rid of the truly noble class the middle class and upper class who had to
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:09:00.680]  be virtuous and in trade and business and operate above board or you would be
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:07.360]  executed they had laws the religion was basically the law of being honorable
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:12.440]  and because they were honorable in the republic days they ended up taking over
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:17.680]  the known world then they slowly degenerated until emperors were marrying
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:21.760]  their horses and doing other things I won't mention on air dressing up like
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:25.600]  werewolves at parties and ripping children's throats out I think that was
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:31.720]  Nero was Caligula married his horse the point is it's always the same story and
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:38.720]  they learned that they could take tax money from the middle class and they
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:46.040]  could then give it to the poor and then create a constituency in voting because
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:51.160]  they had voting in in in many city and town governments but also in gangs that
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.920]  they could call out to beat and attack folks if they didn't go along with it
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:59.480]  because up until the time of Caesar when they officially became an empire or
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:09.720]  or not an empire a dictatorship is already an empire that if you didn't
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.320]  have a gang you didn't have any power because you weren't allowed to bring
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:20.240]  military force south of the Rubicon River in northern Italy or up close to
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:28.680]  where northern Italy and Switzerland meet so the the issue here is this is an
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:34.040]  old program and let's queue up Ezekiel one more time the main architect Ezekiel
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:44.040]  Emmanuel the brother of the Chicago boss Don Corleone Emmanuel there you know
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.520]  goes on Foxes is listen get with the program the insurance companies know
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:50.760]  the individual insurance is going away get used to it but you're gonna have the
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:54.800]  worst plan you're not just gonna have socials health care where you pay 80%
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.160]  taxes and the government can restrict your care because of life decisions or
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.640]  whatever and now you're tied collectively to everyone else and you got
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.040]  compulsory euthanasia even of children and all the rest of it like more than
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:08.200]  Europe that's the best of the socialist systems and I say that very lightly it's
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:13.720]  the best of a long chain of hard-able options we're going to have the worst
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:18.760]  the eugenics the no-choice all written by a few insurance companies less than
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.320]  there's really I say the big 10 they call it the big 10s like seven or eight of
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:28.280]  them and then their own by Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Mark Char Hathaway Wells
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:34.000]  Fargo group you know the usual suspects boondis bank Bank of England and all
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.200]  these private shareholders I can tell reserve is a is a private share group
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.720]  in the actual control and you've got some of the banks that actually have
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:45.320]  shares for the general public common shares but the issue is without getting
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:50.280]  into the whole economics of it this is a total vertical integration financial
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:56.720]  takeover backed up by military takeover and I'm gonna go back to Pat here who
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.720]  we're gonna finish up with this call and go to others the issue here is this is
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:07.000]  not a game this is not a joke and the plan according to all the medical
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.840]  doctors that I know who have been in medical management people that really
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:15.200]  care about their patients really care about quality I mean you can't do serious
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:21.160]  medical work and not really care folks unless you've got a mental problem or
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.520]  something or just completely greedy I mean it's a dedication and they're all
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.320]  leaving and getting out of it because it's restricting the care they can give
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:33.280]  it's a government-run computer system telling them what they can do and it's
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.800]  designed or anytime they want the doctors can be arrested if they take
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:43.680]  Medicare or Medicaid and now they're talking about making you take it which
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:49.480]  will kill the system and they think so little of you that even though they've
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.960]  been caught doing this and doubling the premiums and screwing everybody they
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.920]  think they're gonna get away with fully gutting the system because the
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:59.640]  Republican leadership helped write the bill because they're bought and paid for
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:02.640]  by the same banks and that's why the Republican and Democratic leadership
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:08.160]  from Carl Rove to Barack Obama have circled the wagons against the real
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.340]  Tea Party because let me tell you they're pro-gun they're pro-family they're
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:16.480]  anti-abortion they're anti-socialism they're anti-communism and they're
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:20.560]  waking up and being radicalized in the words of Time magazine writers and
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:25.880]  others by you're looking at him right here they would love to kill me right
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:30.760]  now but they know it will turn me into a giant martyr and they dig through and
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:35.600]  follow me around and do audits and harassments trying to find something I'm
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.120]  doing let me tell you trying to mess with me but they've learned when they
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:43.480]  threaten me in a parking lot or have special forces people follow me around
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:49.320]  or even attack me I just suddenly get 10 times the energy so I mean I'm sitting
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.000]  here though on the edge of the cliff I live on the edge of a cliff and I tell
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.840]  you I wouldn't live anywhere else this this is great being real being honorable
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:03.520]  affecting history trusting in God as the North Star I'm fixed on Christ wicked
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:07.320]  devil that I am my heart loves God I'm standing up for the innocence I'm
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:12.720]  committed I can't do it all in fact I can't do any of it without Jesus Christ
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.120]  and I put it all right there at the cross right there at Christ's sacrifice
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:20.120]  and say lead God and direct me right now please help me not to be wicked and
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:23.880]  evil please help me not to be a coward please help me to be committed please
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:28.960]  give me discernment and God has given it to me and every day I've become more
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:34.600]  informed and more enlightened and that's what it is to be a free man and that's
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:38.920]  what I want everybody else to experience not being a horrible dumbed-down
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:44.880]  minion a slave of the New World Order it's a horrible thing to live as a slave
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:49.320]  and live in fear and you stop being a slave even if you're in physical shackles
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:53.240]  the moment you're not afraid of your captors the moment you decide you're a
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:57.000]  free being with a connection to the Creator that's the moment you're free it
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.920]  happens in your heart that's why they want to drug you that's why they want to
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:03.360]  dumb you down sir you got interrupted by the break Pat recap your story of
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.440]  hanging out with some military folks and what they were saying on multiple
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:11.080]  issues about the missing nukes and things like that because here is a
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:16.280]  world net daily last week top general Obama is purging the military they won't
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:21.120]  go along with this communist agenda major general Patrick Brady major general
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:26.560]  to congressional Medal of Honor winner highly respected here's another one US
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:30.960]  commander in Japan relieved of duty due to alleged misconduct folks they are
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:36.640]  their purging top generals every couple days now I mean this is unprecedented it
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:40.600]  started with the two new commanders and they're asking them if they'll go along
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:44.320]  with some really bad stuff so they didn't tell we've got and I don't get why
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:47.480]  they can't go public about it because it's national security they claim it no
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:51.400]  they're using national security to hide all this criminality let's go back to
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:55.520]  Pat then Mark Greg Dennis and Derek we're gonna get to everybody Pat finish
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:01.200]  your point what I was gonna say Alex is one of the military officers there said
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:05.560]  there's a mass awakening because of the purge of generals and officers and if
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:09.680]  you even go on military comm one of the generals that's actually coming out is
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.520]  on one of the smaller pages in the back of military comm so it's starting to
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:18.560]  come out the military starting to wake up to everything that's going on which
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:23.120]  is huge and you wouldn't believe how many people around the state just where I'm
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:27.320]  at where people are forming groups and working together to help each other and
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.000]  going into their churches and get people to to be a part of everything that's
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.440]  going on and wake up and wake up other people there's a lot of things going on
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:39.440]  and people just need to get involved and pay attention to what's going on
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.960]  you're right God bless you and you said separately one of your friends that was
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:48.200]  at this meeting with the military folks was saying that he goes in to do
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:52.280]  construction in Florida and that the commies are basically hoarding food he
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:58.640]  says oh you're a patriot repeat that for folks well what he said cuz I'd never
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.520]  heard this and he said he would see a lot of food and stuff stocked up in their
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:07.200]  houses and say well you know are you are you a patriot or what they're like
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.440]  no we're getting ready to fight against the Patriots one person told him and I
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.640]  was shocked because I have not heard that no that's true globalist minions
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:19.720]  bureaucrats they all have security plans with the local police they have
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.920]  government districts they don't tell people that but they have them Austin
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:27.120]  it's Terry town they have deals to not turn the power off when they turn the
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:33.120]  rest of our power off that's actually public because again this stuff can't
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:38.360]  be classified under federal law but that basically is classified and that's
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.520]  why they're having martial law drills everywhere because they're going to turn
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.160]  the food off it's not the food's gonna get turned off in the welfare checks
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:49.200]  because the system went bankrupt they're maneuvering us on purpose into that as
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.680]  they've done all these other countries look at Greece look at Brazil look at
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:57.320]  Argentina look at Nigeria this is a plant and then the mass and the middle
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.240]  class will go we got burning cities we've got to do whatever they say and
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:05.080]  have a national sales tax on top of income tax we've got to do whatever they
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:10.240]  say we got to have a carbon tax to get the food back to the poor people and so
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:14.260]  of course all the commies and bureaucrats know about this these are enemy
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:20.040]  soldiers I don't just say that they know these is a foreign takeover we've
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:26.520]  been infiltrated folks I'm not kidding around Dennis in Colorado you're on the
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:32.120]  air go ahead hey Alex how you doing I'm doing all right brother praise Jesus
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:38.760]  stuff and I'm saved I hope you are too anyway the reason I called is you're
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:45.000]  not a conspiracy theorist I do an old commander in the military we'll just
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.800]  leave it at that and he started telling me this stuff back like when the Iraq
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:54.360]  went in you know with the Iraq war and they were showing the airplane out in
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:58.560]  the desert that these are weapons of mass destruction he's got these pictures of
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:03.240]  mother because he was pretty high up he goes these things won't even fly you
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:08.240]  know and there's their job and you know ever since then we've been talking
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.800]  everything he he was telling me is what you're saying now they're gonna shut
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:16.520]  down the road they're gonna shut down the economy that you know they're gonna
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:20.440]  go after everybody with this the health care is gonna be the same thing they're
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:25.280]  doing in the military is a communist takeover communist takeover you're
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:30.360]  exactly right and they're gonna do everything they can to divide conquer
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:36.960]  the family you yourself everything character assassination and they're
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:41.600]  doing it I mean you can look at it in the news somebody's eyes somebody's eyes
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:46.720]  and God will cover it up it's everything that's right sir they are they are
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:51.160]  criminally committed and that's the issue they're going all the way and what's

[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:32.160]  Mao into power who put Lenin into power who helps Stalin it was a collection of
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:36.880]  international banks just like the groups that help put Al Qaeda in power in the
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:44.360]  Middle East very same criminals they want scum in power who will carry out
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.840]  operations telling the people we're going to give you the middle class and
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.280]  rich people's money when it's the ultra rich like Warren Buffett lobbying for
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:56.320]  tax money on middle class to give it to himself and make her bailouts he's the
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:03.200]  biggest recipient and he promotes communism for you not for him he is a
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:09.200]  degenerate piece of filth offshore with diplomatic immunity on record this is
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:19.320]  how they do it this is how they operate and they want control they want to make
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:23.760]  you dependent period and if they don't succeed this time they'll try and try
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:27.920]  again that's the thing it's a war folks we have to keep fighting for liberty you
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:30.840]  can't just oh we're free we won World War two we're gonna be fine that's what
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:35.240]  we've been totally taken over oh I trust the government that's the new American
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:38.040]  way I want big government that's the new American way well that creates a
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:42.120]  nightmare and now it has and it doesn't work except for the tiny elite but
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:45.440]  they've convinced the new generation that socialism and communism is the way
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:50.880]  to go and but they're technocrats even mid-level ones know they're bankrupting
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.360]  things I can tell you how many Obamacare supporters call and go Obama's a good
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:58.520]  guy you've heard him this is plan direct the health care system then I'll get my
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:04.720]  free health care they actually say that Democratic Party when it's not even
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:08.920]  socialist it's never socialist it's big banks that want to make everybody buy
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:13.480]  their stuff and then control the care of the government to steal the money and to
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:18.680]  control your health I don't you understand that and now you're seeing it
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:25.240]  and America could only be overtaken from within it's the only way let's go to

[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:15.480]  calling from basically you know just typical Middletown America generic area
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.600]  and I just wanted to give you kind of a profile on what's going on a couple of
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.320]  stories for you I'll make it quick I was basically just the after you know long
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:26.520]  day I hopped on my mountain bike I was riding into town to make a bank deposit
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:30.640]  and just kind of you know grab a coffee or whatever and this cop chased me down
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.840]  I was just kind of riding my bike and he was he pulled out his taser and he was
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:36.440]  like ready to shoot me right there on the street he's just like what do you do
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:39.520]  and where are you going well are you riding the path like what are you
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.200]  talking about I'm I'm just riding my bicycle to the bank here and I was
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.480]  standing in front of the ATM and and I immediately like broke because I could
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:51.480]  see the bug-eyed look in his face oh yeah no no no that's what tyranny is just
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:55.840]  where they all run around acting like we've done something to make us feel
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.800]  guilty that's the essence of living in a Soviet country go ahead absolutely I
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:05.000]  mean and I have I've been to a country like that when the the Berlin Wall was
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.480]  in full swing my father took me through Czech Park point Charlie there in a
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.400]  East Berlin to witness East Germany firsthand because he had a cousin back
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:18.160]  there and it blew my mind and I'm like you know this sort of smacks him some
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:22.600]  kind of control-free communist state when the cop in your neighborhood wants
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:26.160]  to like tase you you know because you're riding your bicycle it just gave me
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:31.600]  the creeps and just quickly moving on to another story I work in the trades and
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:35.000]  I had a friend who's coming down from the north to kind of give me a hand on the
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.560]  job because I short-handed on one day and I'm a little camper van in front of my
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.720]  house and I said listen and I'm just go ahead and crash out of my van I know
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:46.080]  you're running in late and we'll head off to work in the morning so cool I'll
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:50.760]  do that sounds good it does that and he gets routed by the police at like two
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:53.880]  o'clock in the morning I don't know if they have like heat-taking equipment but
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:58.760]  they certainly do absolutely and or they can see the windows fog how dare
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:05.280]  someone sleep in your car oh my gosh in a free country you don't do that I'll
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:08.400]  tell you what they did Alex basically they rousted him like Nazis and they
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:13.720]  basically gave him a ticket for $150 for laying down with intent to camp and
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:17.200]  they made him walk the streets until sunrise and then he met me all
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:21.040]  bleary-eyed in the morning said great all right I need to go to work it was
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:26.440]  just totally messed up I know it's it's it's it's incredible how they operate
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.520]  man I tell you we're in a lot of trouble that's all I can say and again it's all
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:35.880]  the progressive areas that the cops act like this if you notice it there they're
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:40.720]  ten times worse because they're not progressives in progression the way we
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:45.520]  think their progression like cancer terminal cancer and they know it they
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:51.600]  know it they are the legions of scum oh they're right back we're on the march the

[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:18.800]  Chris and he's the director of communications we're just gonna give
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.240]  you his first name so that the Homeland Security I guess doesn't come after him
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:26.360]  or something and with my patriot supply.com one of our sponsors but the
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:29.840]  reason I've got him on is and I wanted to get him on months ago but we finally
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:33.920]  have gotten him to agree to come on this is an exclusive talk about this they
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:37.960]  were the only food company that wasn't scared to not talk about it I tried to
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:41.080]  get other food companies on they were scared to talk about it but confirm
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:45.640]  FEMA was trying to buy up their food so I've talked Chris into coming on the
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:54.200]  article was back in August of FEMA demanding 24-hour delivery of emergency
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:35:00.000]  food reserves and here's the memo we actually scroll down and show
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:08.320]  that to folks on screen FEMA actually sent them a letter saying they wanted
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:12.520]  them to be prepared for basically during collapse to supply everything they had
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:16.680]  and they contacted a bunch of other companies as well but we've got Chris
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:24.840]  from my patriot supply on with us to discuss what happened today and and
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:29.480]  finally give us an exclusive breakdown and what he's hearing from other folks
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:34.120]  but and we've gone with my patriot supply.com you can find their specials
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:38.400]  there on their site because they've got just such incredibly high quality
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:43.120]  storable food they're not on for a plug but I'm gonna give them one and because
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:48.040]  they are patriots that stood up to FEMA and blew the whistle so they're not
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:52.400]  groveling in fear like most people just hard to believe how much fear there is
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:55.680]  in this country to give us the intel so Chris thanks for coming on with us today
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:59.360]  oh thanks for having me on Alex and longtime listener and let me tell you
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:03.720]  that listening to you and watching your journey has really inspired me to take
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:07.320]  it better care of myself take better care of my body and the info that you've
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:11.360]  put out there has been invaluable to the free thinker movement so thank you
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:15.320]  very much for that there's a saying society's only three meals away from
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:19.000]  savagery and you don't want to be three meals away from savagery and that's why
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.360]  we started my patriot supply to get all of the storeable food out there to
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:27.880]  people it's my patriot supply it's not my FEMA supply and when FEMA called us
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:31.960]  and said hey we want all of your stock we said no this is for the people this
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:35.280]  isn't for FEMA to take and hoard and put in some bunker somewhere and that's why
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:39.560]  we've created my patriots apply with a self-sustaining model no loans no joint
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:44.720]  capital ventures nothing like that we operate completely on our own and we're
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:48.760]  operated by patriots for patriots
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:55.680]  Wow well what do you think is going on here why do you think FEMA is hiring
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:00.280]  tens of millions of dollars worth of security guards for civil unrest that's
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:06.160]  what it says on the Fed biz opportunity site for every state I mean is it
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:09.640]  because they're starting to cut the food stamps and the welfare I've got USA
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:14.360]  today talking about it population enrollment and food stamps program food
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:19.800]  stamp cuts create high demand for food bank supplies and then another one our
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:24.120]  story from last week food banks panicking over demand following welfare
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:27.600]  cut or our story from Friday that's up on drudgereport.com on the right hand
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:31.760]  side of folks want to want to find that what do you think's going on here Chris
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:36.480]  well there are many levels speaking to the FEMA representative myself I got the
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:40.440]  feeling like he really thought he was doing the right thing like the lower
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:43.920]  level people they really think that they're helping people at the higher
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:47.480]  echelons of this though of course they want to provoke food riots they want to
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:51.920]  provoke a situation to where they can impose martial law and put people people
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:56.160]  in the FEMA camps of course he gave me several possible scenarios that he is
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:01.920]  looking at and those scenarios include a nuclear disaster food shortages but of
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:07.080]  course the main the main situation that he was looking at was a disaster in a
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:11.400]  tri-state area there they're looking at an event that's going to happen that's
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.400]  going to affect people in three different states if not more with
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:17.680]  survivors of 10 million or more at least that's what the lower level guys
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:21.800]  have been told so what they're trying to provoke your guess is as good as mine
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:25.360]  but I do know that when this whole government shutdown thing happened I was
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:31.120]  able to look at this without fear and actually feel secure because I knew that
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:34.520]  no matter what happened they can shut down the ebt cards the the groceries can
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:39.040]  go empty the grocery stores can go empty but I still had my storable food here
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:43.360]  with me so I was able to really see the situation for exactly what it is and
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:48.520]  think clearly in this situation you know I've noticed especially in the last few
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:54.240]  years my patreon supply.com it has become the leader I mean you guys are
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:57.440]  everywhere and and I tried the food out about a year ago because I buy from
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:01.320]  multiple groups and just yours were some of the best tasting and the lowest
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:04.680]  price and I know I said I wanted to get you on about this but your sponsor it's
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:08.440]  turning into a plug because I want to support folks that support us but also
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.840]  you're a great company and you're the only guys that had the courage look
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:17.600]  specifically because you know Chris you don't even use your last name I guess
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:20.560]  because of you know the FEMA stuff but at least you guys have the courage to
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:25.680]  speak out well I mean any more you can tell us about FEMA and what you're
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:28.440]  hearing in the industry because I confirmed they're buying food up
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:33.760]  everywhere but no one will come on I guess because it's a customer and I see
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:37.000]  that but but you're kind of like you know ammo manufacturers that did get
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.920]  contacted to sell out at the ammo to DHS who said no I've also sought them out
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:46.480]  and made them sponsors of the show but you know you guys said we're not going
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:53.520]  to sell to you sorry and why did you do that as I said before it's because this
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:57.160]  supply is for the Patriots out there it's not for the government to come and
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:02.040]  just take up and put in a bunker somewhere in the event of a hurricane
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:06.840]  chemical or biological weapon like FEMA's preparing for we need to be
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:09.920]  prepared because what they want is they want people to run to those FEMA camps
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:14.080]  they want to say hey we have shelter here we have clothes we have food the
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.680]  FEMA representative actually told me that that that's what they're that it
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:23.160]  eases the the survivors quote-unquote I it puts the survivors at ease when you
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:27.080]  say hey you have a place to go shelter and clothing then we'll work out the
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:30.680]  rest later that was very suspect in my opinion because I'm not going to a FEMA
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:34.360]  camp and then having them work out the rest later because we all know where
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:37.880]  that's gonna lead and of course you're quoting a local newscast out of New
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:42.080]  Orleans where they said martial law the preachers are there and they wouldn't
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:44.960]  give them the food and water for days the army under orders was not even
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:48.880]  allowed to give security or help people in the Superdome the police were
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.480]  out looting all over the place now I'm not saying everywhere is going to be like
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:57.360]  New Orleans a famously you know big easy you know a corrupt devilish city a
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:00.600]  beautiful city as well I'm not knocking it but it's very infested with evil
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:06.120]  obviously it's legendary for that but I mean they're gearing up for a designed
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:12.320]  clowered and piven collapsed Rahm Emanuel's brother that wrote Obamacare with
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:16.400]  the plan that Mitt Romney developed is out bragging that it's meant to wreck
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:22.080]  everything so it is our patriotic duty to get storable food and I've bought
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.280]  storable food for family that can't afford it and I know you didn't come on
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:28.800]  today to plug things but we've gone with you guys the last few months just
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:31.920]  because you're you're the best out there and I promise the best and you know if
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:34.720]  one water filter company isn't as good as something else I'll go to the other
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:39.720]  like we don't like propure that we sell so you guys really are the best bang for
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:43.840]  the buck you've got a wide selection of food other preparedness products at my
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:47.520]  patreon supply.com should we give out the phone number because I know that
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:51.560]  wasn't planned to do should we tell folks about some of the specials you've got
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:59.520]  I mean there's the number 866-229-0927 866-229-0927

[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:10.360]  what you suggest they should get as the bare minimum and should you buy enough
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:14.200]  food to take care of your neighbors who we know are laughing at us now but won't
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:19.000]  be laughing later yeah absolutely I mean I've got a lot of info to go over here
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:24.480]  but we can hit on that really quick you know the phone number of course 866-229-0927
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:30.040]  mypatriotsupply.com slash Alex where you can get special offers just for your
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:33.960]  listeners and I recommend that people get at least a four-week supply because
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:40.560]  if FEMA is preparing for some type of event that they've already stated that
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:45.000]  affects a tri-state area we don't know where that tri-state area is and just the
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.680]  other day Seattle went down and everybody was stuck without electricity
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:52.800]  and supposedly they got most of that back up immediately but it just goes to
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.240]  show it doesn't have to be an economic collapse it doesn't have to be a huge
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:59.880]  event like that it can be just power outages in several different places we
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:02.880]  also have solar flares that we're looking at and they're predicting that a
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:06.320]  solar flare can come out and take out a satellite and if it does the power grid
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:11.360]  can go down for a week two weeks maybe even longer there's so many scenarios to
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:17.200]  prepare for the meteor as well what we saw in Russia a meteor hit and the guy
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.920]  from FEMA actually told me that they're preparing for one possible scenario of a
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:27.640]  meteor hitting 50 fold what has happened in Russia taking out for example
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:31.840]  New York New Jersey and that whole tri-state area there and then of course
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:36.960]  we have Obama giving away all of our infrastructure to an Asian interest with
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:42.400]  the there was a the TTP which is the trade promotion authority which bypasses
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:47.240]  Congress completely and fast tracks the approval required by Congress to vote on
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:50.720]  it within 90 days so they're turning around selling off all our food all of
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:55.040]  our infrastructure all of our internet and we're just left here holding the bag
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:59.200]  with absolutely nothing no control nothing at all of our own lives and I
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:02.720]  think that's ultimately where they want to move towards I was told and I'm told
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:07.320]  this story probably a hundred times I'll tell it for the hundred and first I was
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:12.880]  I ran into let's just put it to you that way and spent about I don't know I might
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:19.080]  have been 45 minutes while they were doing some documents at a law office
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:25.240]  with a lady an unattractive middle-aged lady and I didn't know who she was but
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:30.160]  I kind of had heard her name and she was a listener and she told me she said I'm
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:34.920]  moving out of the country I'm selling everything I'm selling my defense
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:41.320]  contractor famous company and she said there isn't going to be an America left
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:45.960]  in five years this was about five years ago and I said I said what do you mean
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:49.080]  there's not going to be an America she goes listen get ready to become very
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:54.200]  popular she goes everything you're saying is the plan and I'm not going to be
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:58.640]  part of it and I said what what what is the plan she goes you know I'm just
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:03.960]  telling you what you're saying is dead on get ready to be famous and I like well
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:08.360]  I don't want to be famous she goes I know I know I know sugar but let me tell
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.200]  and then I went look up who this lady was worth like four billion dollars or
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:15.360]  something you know and here's this woman sitting there telling me this whole
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:20.760]  deal point blank I mean that's what we're talking about here do you think
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:24.680]  they're going to be successful bringing us down no you know why because I think
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:29.000]  the human spirit will prevail and the human spirit is infused with the need
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  to be free that's why we can never succeed in Iraq or Afghanistan that's
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.680]  why we're there still fighting and fighting and fighting because those
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:38.720]  people are fighting for their homes over there and I guarantee you when we have
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:42.360]  UN peacekeeping troops here people will start fighting for their homes and you
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:45.640]  can never defeat somebody that's fighting for their home they're going to try
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:49.320]  everything they can they've tried to make the entire population docile seventy
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:52.720]  seventy five percent of people now are on some type of psychopharmaceutical they
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:56.520]  can't feel they have no empathy they can't get mad and that's something that
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:59.640]  we need to do right now is get mad because when things are bad that's a
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:03.480]  natural reaction if we don't actually face this then it's never going to go
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:07.080]  away and it's just going to overwhelm us so we will have some people that will go
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:11.560]  voluntarily to those FEMA camps but for the most part I think the human spirit
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:15.800]  will prevail and they're pushing so hard and to that point to where people are
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:20.080]  starting to wake up and the awakening is just unbelievable I was just going
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:25.560]  over 72 points that make us a person a potential terrorist and amongst those
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:28.520]  were people that believe in the Constitution people that believe in
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:32.000]  religion people that believe in homeschooling I'm sure you've gone over
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.120]  this many many times before but they have labeled every single person as a
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:39.960]  potential terrorist why because they understand that the human spirit is
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:44.280]  infused in every single person and there will be a point to where people wake up
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:49.320]  well you're right and and it indicts the power structure is totally criminal
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:53.360]  and evil when you read that that was one article I saw about a month ago that
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:58.860]  listed 75 links to government documents and public statements gun owners the
[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:05.880]  founding fathers all returning veterans land owners middle-class they're
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:09.440]  making the Navy seals because you know the Navy also had the don't tread on
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:13.120]  me thing going back to John Paul Jones they're making them take that off their
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:17.400]  uniform patch of us of the of the rattlesnake because it's a it's a
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:22.480]  globalist commie takeover of course we've had that symbol for since the
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:27.560]  founding of the country 230 plus years ago that is one of the first symbols
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:31.440]  before even the American flag it was the don't tread on me was being used by
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:36.000]  malicious they're banning American symbols saying they're radical well of
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.120]  course to these globalist that's radical brother I mean it's just it's but
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:45.720]  even for me immersed in it it's unbelievable watching did you see
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:49.440]  Ezekiel Emanuel admit the health care plan that he wrote is meant to wreck
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.520]  the health care system oh yeah absolutely and there's been a lot of
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:57.600]  information coming out that Obama told his staff that he's very good at killing
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:00.840]  people that he knew that everybody was gonna lose their health care coverage he
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.720]  just lied to everybody I mean it's all right they're playing his day we are
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:09.160]  living in a beautiful time now though 20 years ago 30 years ago all of this
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:13.480]  information was only privileged to people that had libraries under their
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:17.800]  under their homes they're really elite people the rich people now we have all
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:20.840]  this information at our fingertips all we have to do is go to this internet and
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:23.860]  type in whatever we want and we will find the information we'll find the
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:27.360]  documents whistleblowers are coming out it's beautiful and I think that's why
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:30.480]  there's a push to regulate the internet as well and to sell off that
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:33.560]  infrastructure and this country is in so much trouble that you're the only food
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:37.680]  company that the courage to go public but you see you're Steven not using your
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:40.360]  last name which is you know good if you don't need to be public you don't be
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:44.360]  public it just shows how much trouble this country has gotten into well listen
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:47.680]  I really am glad I got you want to talk about this and thank you for your great

[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:47.560]  you see as big news out in the media but but it's big I saw this Sunday I didn't
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:51.000]  cover it yesterday on the radio show on Sunday so I want to cover it today the
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.400]  brain-powered car vehicle monitors whether a driver is paying attention and
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:55:00.880]  slows down if they are distracted in the last 20 years researching this has been
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:05.720]  the holy grail of control and this is how they're designing the
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:10.800]  technocracy and computers to spy on everything we do and control us and
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:15.160]  report back via the wireless black boxes that are in all the cars and taxes
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:19.120]  not to keep us safe but to totally control everything we do I mean you're
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:23.720]  worried about the NSA this is beyond that this is global okay and it's not
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:26.360]  just the u.s. government involved in this of course it turns out Germany knew
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:30.040]  all about it and their vice versa I want to tie it into this Washington post
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:36.840]  article shot spotter detection system documented 39,000 shooting incidents in
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:41.360]  the district how is that you've banned all the guns there now again these are
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:46.360]  microphones basically every hundred yards or so at a cost of billions I
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:51.440]  remember when they put these in in Austin and DC and a 20 plus major cities
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:59.680]  and I covered it in my film and I made 1999 folks their microphones but they
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:04.120]  call them gunshot detector see how they mislabel everything they give you a
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:08.320]  vaccine they call the vaccine it's really a delayed cancer shot with cancer
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:16.000]  viruses on record it's really an IQ reducer it's really a sterile and the
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:23.040]  average person just can't get around you know how big this is so it blows them
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:27.280]  away but but it's really happening the tyrants are really going for it all they
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:31.640]  really think they're going to win they really think they could just put
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:34.160]  fluoride in the water and get away with they really think they can build
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:37.600]  femicamps and no one will admit there exists when they're the emergency
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:42.000]  centers establishment act and the civilian M8 labor camp program and
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.040]  the I'm giving you all the names they don't call it a femicamp they go oh
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:49.600]  femicamps don't exist it'd be like if they change the name of a giraffe to a
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:53.720]  boople snoople and you said look at that giraffe that doesn't exist they go
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:58.280]  Alex giraffes don't exist but Drupal snooples do and they'd be like yes
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:02.720]  you're right that is a Drupal snoople now they play these word games with us
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:08.960]  lawyer games and the sooner we figure that out they're not death panels they're
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:16.120]  bioethics boards let's go to a phone call we're going to break Derek in Utah
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:20.480]  thanks for holding her on the air sir hi I was going Alex great to talk to you man
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:24.600]  great to talk to you brother well originally I called in about the
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:29.240]  Obamacare thing that it's interesting that you mentioned the cars driving
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:35.720]  themselves I should watch demolition man yesterday and they've got quite a bit of
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:39.000]  that predictive programming stuff you know it's funny you mentioned that we're
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:45.440]  we're producing a piece tomorrow that I'm doing with Jakari and Rob a do on
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:51.120]  demolition man in dystopia but go ahead that movie actually is probably one of
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:55.040]  the most profound ones there's actually a scene in there where they're talking
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:58.680]  about a constitutional amendment to help Arnold Schwarzenegger be become
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:03.360]  president no no no it's all paid that is definitely from the perspective of
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:07.240]  selling tyranny and folks go but it's against it that matter it's acclimating
[01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:13.280]  the subconscious mind yeah yeah definitely but yeah originally what I
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:17.480]  wanted to call in about was this this whole Obamacare fiasco I mean I know
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:20.920]  this is probably gonna be considered beating a dead horse especially for your
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:24.440]  audience but we have started calling this what it is this is the official
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:30.400]  endorsement by the US government of a eugenics policy it really is you're
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:33.320]  absolutely right I mean in California just admitted they're still secretly
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:36.960]  sterilizing people illegally but nobody's going to jail this is a criminal
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:40.600]  conspiracy and they're getting away with it hour two coming up hour three

[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:20.120]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:28.920]  Alex Jones Anthony Frida one of my favorite I mean I've got to say he's
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:33.600]  probably the most talented prolific anti-New World Order pro-liberty artist
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:36.960]  out there one of the top ones I just really like his style he's going to be
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:41.400]  in studio at us obviously we're a radio show 90 plus percent of our audience is
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:45.480]  radio there are folks watching on prison planet TV there's folks watching
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:50.480]  later on YouTube other platforms but we're mainly a threshold radio so we'll
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:54.080]  spend a little bit of time on this art but get into his mind politically smart
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:58.880]  guy does a lot of work for us a lot of work for Gerald Salenta and so he's
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:02.960]  going to be joining us and I know he's a listener because I can say something one
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.560]  day and then like the next day seem to be a piece of art that I I could tell I'm
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:10.000]  influencing him I just shook his hand never really talked to him he's back
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  there in the coffee room it's all asking am I influencing you because or maybe
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.240]  we're thinking the exact same thing some days but I'll say something one of my
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:21.960]  weird analogies and then it's like boom Anthony Frida like boom that makes it
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:25.760]  come into life there so very exciting and down the road I'm going to launch the
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:32.000]  info wars art operation this art is a weapon against tyranny and I hope to
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.200]  carry his stuff but that's if everything doesn't collapse and go into
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:38.760]  martial law I mean I'm at the point now where it's kind of makes you not worry
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:43.200]  about anything just it's like by the fact notice you won't see any third party
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:46.040]  advertising now and info wars are on my radio show unless it's the network's
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:50.360]  ads I just am so tired of having to vet every sponsor and make sure I'm
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:54.080]  morally bringing people the very best stuff even the good sponsors I've had
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:56.640]  for ten years I just we're calling them and saying we're not taking any
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:00.080]  advertising right now we're just going to try to find ourselves with prison
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:05.000]  planet dot TV memberships and with products and and and water filters and
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.640]  things and I've just gotten to the point in my life where even in personal
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:13.680]  relationships it's just it's over you know it's like somebody something goes
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:18.480]  on just I'm done and instead of being mr. nice guy about everything I am just
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:23.600]  done and then I'm going to a higher moral level as well just because why I
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:27.120]  mean what why we're gonna try to be a good person why you know why why do
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:31.920]  nine percent why don't go a hundred percent let's go ahead and talk to the
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:36.880]  only sponsor we have is my patriot supply now I just and people see no
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:41.000]  sponsors I told most radio shows want sponsors I said I'm done with all the
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.680]  sponsors for now let's talk to nothing against them all it's just it messing
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:49.160]  with it fiddling with it I mean I'm gonna I want to be able to develop proper
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:55.160]  advertising and re-roll it out in the future let's talk to George in New York
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:03:21.160]  George you're on the air welcome we've had her on the nightly news in the
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:35.480]  radio show well I hear you your phones a little overdriven to put it lightly but
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:40.480]  but it's interesting points you're making what do you make of the Obamacare

[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:46.960]  be trees and charges right now I mean this is the criminal wrecking of our
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:51.840]  system go ahead well I'm I'm totally against everything that's going on in
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:55.640]  this the thing I just can't understand people buying into this but at least you
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:59.960]  see the polls you can see that people are finally waking up that this is a total
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:05.880]  takedown of the entire government that works so that they can basically say
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:11.160]  nothing works and then say look we'll just give you dictatorship instead you
[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:15.880]  know it's ridiculous I mean I just don't understand why people don't wake up

[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:50.320]  exchange plans get rid of there's a lot of people in the individual market
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:54.880]  cloud in heaven changes it to close down the trees and the insurance company

[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:06.560]  they see the future that individual market is going away they don't want to
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:15.200]  invest in it so there you go a serious crisis to go to waste mm-hmm what I
[02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:18.600]  mean by that it's an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:22.520]  before that's his brother and you can find the full clip online from the
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:26.560]  Wall Street Journal where where he goes on to say we use these crises yeah so
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:30.520]  you manufacture them this is a criminal conspiracy just like fast and furious
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:35.560]  CBS News got the documents as we told you we had our DEA source who they came
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:40.000]  and to his house and arrested him for five shotguns he had he'd gotten a
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:45.080]  divorce he was a school teacher retired DEA retired Vietnam veteran he'd gotten
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:49.400]  out of the DEA because the corruption in there Selly Castile came on our show
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:52.280]  eight years ago and said their arming was that is they're gonna have a civil
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:55.200]  war down there and it started two years after he said it and it's like something
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:10:00.120]  like 70,000 dead Mexicans more people die there a year than US troops would die
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:04.320]  a year in Vietnam folks and our criminal narcotics trafficking government runs
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:10.200]  it and it's an example of how they create the crises fast and furious we
[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:13.720]  knew they were shipping guns down there Selly just didn't know the name of it
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:17.760]  because when he started talking about Obama a few years ago that's when they
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:23.600]  came to his house and said you were selling your shotguns at the gun show
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:28.120]  and he said yeah I'm selling most of my guns I live in a trailer I'm broke I
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:33.760]  lost everything on a divorce and they literally arrested him had a kangaroo
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:38.520]  jury send him to prison for what was it two or three years for selling guns
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:43.480]  because he exposed the ATF and fast and furious but didn't even know the name of
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:51.160]  it now I'm telling you folks this is what we're talking about and now the NSA
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:56.320]  is telling artists that make fun of the NSA that they're going to arrest them
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:11:00.280]  and charge them with copyright and all this stuff and so the artist is suing
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:06.120]  them that's up on drudgereport.com we covered it last Friday now CBS is
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:10.080]  covering it today and drudge is making it his top story and it is the top story
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:14.480]  it should be because he's fighting back and now everybody can see the NSA the
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:19.600]  only part of government that actually listens now now again folks if if there
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:24.840]  wasn't power in lampooning this and under the First Amendment it's totally
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:30.960]  protected to sell t-shirts with a parody of the NSA or the TSA they've tried to
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:34.680]  threaten to arrest people wearing our shirts criticizing the TSA well you know
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:38.440]  what we're coming out with more TSA shirts and more NSA shirts and I'm gonna
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:41.880]  have a ten thousand dollar film festival that I'm announcing tomorrow that will
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:46.360]  run into January so that about a month and a half to get it done and the first
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:49.600]  week of January we will announce the ten thousand dollar winner but the real
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:52.800]  winners all of us resisting because you'll have hundreds of great videos
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:58.080]  put out that millions of people see lampooning the NSA lampooning the TSA
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:01.280]  which the TSA threatens to arrest you if you laugh at them that's that's that's
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:05.240]  two-week-old news now they have announcements talk about our welly and
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:09.920]  we're going to throw it back in their face and will my active resistance or
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:14.760]  your active resistance to feed them no but together not laying down that will
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:17.880]  that's why they want to tell you you have no power that's why they want to
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:21.600]  tell you you're pathetic because once you decide that or once you decide you're
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:25.080]  bad and you're worthless because you've had death education in the schools and
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:29.720]  taught how horrible humans are once you then curl up and die they can inherit
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:33.440]  the world well that's not going to happen the sleeping giant that is free
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:38.520]  humanity is awakening and just like when Adron Yamamoto under orders attack
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:42.800]  Pearl Harbor even though he recommended against it he sent back a
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:48.360]  communique to the general staff saying I feel we have only awakened a sleeping
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:56.160]  giant to terrible purpose and if you decide to wake up and and and I don't
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:59.960]  mean just wake up to what's happening wake up that you have power wake up that
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:04.160]  every time you slap an info wars.com bumper sticker on some globalist
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:09.600]  operation every time you speak out every time I go into CVS or anywhere I
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:13.400]  just start preaching about 20% off for flu shots I shot video of it yesterday
[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:16.200]  we're gonna put on the YouTube channel and start educating everybody and and
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:22.360]  and I hope a manager comes over and makes a scene because I know that CVS may
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:25.480]  not know and the manager may not know but the power structure is giving you
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:29.360]  20% off because that stuff gives you the flu on record doubles your chances of
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:33.560]  getting it the next year makes you sick can kill you it says in the insert and
[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:39.800]  I'm there to warn people I mean what do you expect me to do I mean they're buying
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:42.960]  razors and stuff yesterday so I'd have some up here at the office when I was
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:46.960]  driving in Sunday and and and I was in there buying razors and shaving cream and
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:51.920]  I couldn't find fluoride free toothpaste or whatever and and so I go up to the
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:55.360]  front counter and the guy pushes a flu shot on me I start start preaching goes
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:58.440]  wait a minute your Alex Jones I turn my camera go yeah he was my mom loves you
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:01.800]  yeah I've heard it's bad but they tell us to push it and then some lady comes up
[02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:06.160]  and starts complaining so I start talking to her and and and then suddenly it
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:09.720]  wasn't she wasn't she wanted a henpeck at me and thought I would just grovel to
[02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:12.840]  her but said I want look I just care about you have you read the insert oh
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:18.400]  whatever I'm busy well you better be busy enough to stand up for reality you
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:23.080]  better decide that this is what's important and if you don't stand up for
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:26.880]  transparency and truth you will be overrun by the most evil elements
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:33.920]  oh it's incredible now folks Anthony Frida joins us here in studio and he
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:38.880]  attended a Pratt Institute where he met Francis Lee he currently the director of
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:42.960]  the AJ Dylan gallery and close friend ever since after college he eventually
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:47.040]  created his own advertising art studio red line illustrations I won't go over
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:51.120]  all of his work but you've seen on the cover of the biggest magazines in the
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:58.040]  country Rolling Stone New Yorker Time Magazine you name it and he's done what
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:03.120]  most artists don't do Anthony Frida calm most people I talked to famous
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:06.520]  photographer famous artists they go I'm a listener or I'm aware you're right
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:12.480]  Hollywood it isn't liberal conservative it's libertarian but but these people
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.080]  then kind of play the part of a liberal because they don't ever work again if
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:20.160]  they don't play ball and I I'll probably ask him since the last I don't know four
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:23.640]  five years it seems he's been fighting tyranny I mean he was always fighting it
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:28.040]  before that but he's really almost seems like exclusively doing that now has the
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:31.880]  power structure tried to lash out at you because they ban people's Twitter's and
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:35.560]  Facebook's that criticize Obamacare or show that they've been kicked off their
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:40.360]  care and gotten a 200% increase I mean they again they want to shut us up
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:45.840]  Anthony Frida great to have you here Anthony Frida calm first off great to
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:50.000]  meet you in person but then get into have you been persecuted or have has it
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:55.160]  been empowering well it's great to meet you too Alex and it has been both you
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:59.000]  know I've probably lost a lot of clients and I know I've been banned on
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:04.360]  Facebook on occasion because of because of some of the content of the imagery
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:11.040]  that I put up there and I know a lot of the trendies as you call them do not
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:18.440]  like my my poke said Obama but they were very happy when I was taking jabs at the
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:23.560]  Bush administration and the thing that is interesting to me is that you've been
[02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:29.040]  consistent you were you know very critical the Bush administration that's
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:33.240]  one of the things that drew me towards you and you've been consistent since
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:38.720]  then with your message of peace and freedom and an anti-war message and I
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:42.600]  think I have been too but the people who were supporting me during the Bush
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:47.840]  area who are mainly you know the people in my my industry who hire illustrators
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:51.600]  are mostly Democrats and mostly Obama support sure they're the ones that run
[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:54.880]  all the big magazines so I bet you probably took a big hit not being on I
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:58.520]  mean I mean before I even knew you or saw your political art I realized I've
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:01.800]  been seeing it forever everywhere I mean you're like a leading national
[02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:05.720]  international illustrator and I notice I haven't seen as much of your stuff in
[02:17:05.720 --> 02:17:09.520]  the establishment magazines but you notice their readerships going down just
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:14.560]  as they have become tyrannical people are leaving them that's right and that's
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:17.800]  what's interesting the power of the power of the image that's what I'm all
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:21.280]  about it's the power of the image I'm trying to translate what you do and you
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:25.960]  know in verbal form into a visual form that's really what I'm trying to do
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:30.800]  spread these messages of peace and freedom and personal liberty and very
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:38.480]  simple very powerful American really images and ideas and I don't think of
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:41.720]  them as subversive because I think that they are the core of what's great about
[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:45.120]  this country you know it's it and for some reason it's got twisted around like
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:48.680]  that we're the subversive so they're making the Navy Seals take the rattlesnake
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:53.440]  off their patch they've had for hundreds of years now I don't get it I don't get
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:57.480]  it I was up you know I've been in the whole country for a couple days and I
[02:17:57.480 --> 02:18:04.120]  went up to the Salt Lake oh yeah oh my goodness amazing place but I was up there
[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:07.760]  with some great people but most of them were you know trendies as you call them
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:11.880]  and they actually said to me you sure you want to go on the Alex Jones show
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:16.160]  I mean maybe it'll hurt your reputation and I said I don't give a damn about my
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:20.000]  reputation this is I'm proud to be on this show I'm proud to be here because
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.320]  you're fighting for every all Americans liberties you're fighting well thank you
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:27.640]  for that but but that's all they use is this peer pressure when they've signed
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:31.800]  on to all this evil but they don't care because they feel like it's accepted by
[02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:35.400]  an establishment media that is the laughing stock of the world it's like
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:40.640]  Americans are in this trendy bubble and have no idea that the whole world is
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:44.840]  marveling at the tyranny right now yeah well that's what we're trying to do like
[02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:48.160]  I say I'm trying to take your ideas and put them in the visual form because these
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:53.640]  memes have power I mean you see that the officer pike spray you know pepper spray
[02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:59.920]  those kids sitting on its on a sidewalk that took off and it became this amazing
[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:03.560]  that's like one of the biggest memes of the last decade saying well that's the
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:06.040]  power of the image you know the power of the image was usually used by the
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:09.440]  government and by the totalitarian states obviously throughout history to
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:13.440]  promote the state and from and to demonize their enemy and villainize
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:18.080]  and to the extent that soldiers would have no problem killing them because
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:22.120]  they're not human it was designed to make them subhuman make them other make
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:26.480]  them something that you could easily kill without having it's not murder now
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:29.680]  and so you're trying to take that that propaganda weapon of the state but
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:32.720]  reverse it with truth and counter incredible we're going to break I want
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:38.960]  to get more of your political ideas and your process in the studio because it's
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:43.280]  so amazing Anthony Frieda.com is the website Anthony Frieda's with us but
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:47.280]  but really when we come back I want to ask you I see myself under any label the
[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:51.760]  most accurate is the classical liberal Thomas Jefferson style I'm a liberal I'm
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:56.000]  for freedom I'm for empowerment I'm for peace so are you these so-called Obama
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:59.160]  supporters and mainline Republican supporters they're just in a political
[02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:04.000]  game we'll be right back my name is Josh one world way is the best in the
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:08.200]  market hands down I'm in the US Navy and I live a very active lifestyle being a

[02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:19.080]  weight protein kind of work for a bit but it left me feeling bloated and my
[02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:22.360]  digestion seemed to slow down by some divine stroke of luck I heard a
[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:26.240]  commercial of one world way on the radio and it struck my interest I have to tell
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:30.440]  you I am so glad I got it I have been taking it for a week and the results are

[02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:22.620]  well one of the top illustrators in the country Anthony Freida is here and he
[02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:27.440]  was visiting friends and family and folks as his wife from Austin and you were
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:31.160]  saying these are UT grads nice folks you know nice people but they were
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:35.720]  literally don't go on the Alex Jones show in their own bubble and that's why I
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:41.440]  brought that up because literally Liberty is incredibly popular all the
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:45.080]  polls show it there's an awakening happening but those still members of
[02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:48.360]  the establishment or people that think Obama is the second coming of Christ
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:52.240]  they still think like when they come over to criticize me I was telling you
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:56.000]  during the break nine out of ten times folks come over to shake my hand and
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000]  they're waking up they're liberal they're conservative they're getting
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:02.560]  outside that paradigm just being Americans being Liberty lovers but the
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:06.480]  so-called liberals walk over and they will laugh at me like it's a public
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:10.800]  shaming like it gets to me and it's like comical I could have 50 trillion
[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:17.040]  trendies laughing at me I know I'm right it's actually fun but I guess in their
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:22.320]  mindset they thought nudging you controlling you telling you what to do
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:26.120]  when you've given up so much money to you know I do illustrations for Liberty
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:29.280]  instead of doing them for Time Magazine they was I you're here to talk I'm
[02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:35.160]  ranting Anthony talk about that no you're right I mean and my reply was
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:40.120]  first of all I believe in free speech I believe in the First Amendment you have
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:44.320]  a platform you have the right to say whatever you think is your opinion of
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:49.360]  what's going on in the world and the fact that they want to deny that from
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:53.360]  you that to me is scary so you know you might not agree with everything you say
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:57.640]  but you know they want to shut you down that's different as a major major
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:02.160]  difference there and that's what's disturbing to me it's a big country we're
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:07.560]  all entitled to our opinion and and then we need to kind of reach out and try to
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:10.880]  understand what the other person is saying rather than just demonize them
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:17.200]  and automatically dismiss them or try to censor them this idea of censorship the
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:20.960]  war on whistleblowers the war on the press that mean that I've seen it look
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:24.920]  at how the NSA threatened to arrest the guy that put on a parody t-shirt yeah I
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:29.880]  know and it's a parody is protected but they don't care it's obviously your
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:35.560]  third attorney is a miss tyranny and these are the things we're trying to
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:40.120]  strike out against which which are the heart of what this country is about and
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:42.960]  hey guys will you punch up drudge so I can show folks what we're talking about
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:47.720]  go ahead Anthony and yeah that's how I respond to them I was um you know I was
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:55.240]  just third by it and I'm happy to be here and I love Liberty man and I'm here
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:59.920]  to use this platform that I have and use the the images I can create to promote
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:04.280]  ideas of peace and freedom and that is to me is paramount but think about that
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:09.480]  you you post on your own Twitter or Facebook your artwork and they delete it
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:13.080]  or they suspend your account and they do it to us and they do it to everybody and
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:18.560]  and or or you set up a site on on Facebook showing your own insurance
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:22.440]  going up 200% and they say no you can't do that I mean these people are not
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:26.680]  liberals they are we should be in the streets with pitchforks and I'm not
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:30.160]  calling for that but politically we should be my point is is that it's
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:34.600]  outrageous this is what we grew up reading about in the Soviet Union yeah
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:42.120]  this censorship is anathema to a free society and and it's it's really it it's
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:46.000]  something that disturbs me to a great extent and it's something that I'm
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.120]  fighting against and we but the great thing is we can use these platforms that
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:54.360]  were designed to spy on us and control us and to expose the fact that these
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:59.360]  platforms are there to you know spy on us and control us that's the great the
[02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:02.960]  power that we have now which is to me I'm trying to exploit that I'm trying to
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:08.240]  use that for for a message of pure freedom and peace and that's exciting
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:11.480]  well Anthony people like you are my heroes because because you're you're
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:15.920]  you're you're UT friends you're telling you don't go on that it might hurt you
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:20.440]  financially imagine they don't even have any idea that for many years you were
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:24.480]  exposing Bush and now Obama that you have credibility that you have congruent
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:29.560]  values that are the bedrock of civilization and that you've already
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:33.960]  made sacrifices they're too ignorant to even know that they wouldn't even have
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:37.480]  the intel on what you're doing before they tried to tell you what to do in
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:40.800]  your life as if you hadn't already thought about that yeah it's just the
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:45.680]  height of of arrogance yeah I'm not interested in money this is this is a
[02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:49.720]  labor love no I know but you've already undoubtedly probably lost a lot of big
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:53.560]  contracts probably have promoting liberty and these little guys are
[02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:58.000]  threatening you with that as almost like part of the corporate Borg they get
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:01.440]  that they think you're like them the reason they said don't come on here is
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:05.080]  because they've already sold themselves out to the product the lie they are the
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:10.720]  product yeah they are a pile of BS yeah they are full of crap yeah they're not
[02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:14.120]  men and I know you say they're nice people I'd like to talk to them say
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:18.220]  what the hell's your problem in America you think it's okay that Obama is
[02:29:18.220 --> 02:29:22.400]  saying arrest people that put out parody t-shirts about having our rights
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:26.760]  violated what in the world are we talking about here I'm not trying to yell

[02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:54.040]  free to is our guest really a legendary illustrator I'm just such a fan of his
[02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:58.840]  work and it's so exciting to see all his original ideas put to paper and
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:02.920]  sometimes see things and you know analogies I brought up like dinosaur
[02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:08.040]  media and then he makes it a t-rex being bombed by a drone that says truth just
[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:12.320]  very very exciting to see his work we're going to go to your phone calls come up
[02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:15.040]  in about 10 minutes but I want to shut up since he's here in studio with us and
[02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:20.240]  let him actually expound on things I just get so mad during the breaks when
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:23.840]  he was telling me what else his friends were telling him about you might get on
[02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:28.480]  the list they might come after you but but we're not in a tyranny though it's
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:33.440]  just you better watch out see they think groveling to the system and denying it
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:37.560]  or going along with it protects them no it destroys them or they say it's
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:41.760]  racist if you don't want open borders look at this fast food companies grease
[02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:47.000]  the skids and lobbying wheels for amnesty look at that boom why do you think
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:52.520]  they want that to drive down the wages I mean you the same big banks are for
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:58.240]  open borders that were for Obamacare a total screw job let's continue with
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:03.520]  some of these headline food stamps sold for cash on Twitter Facebook there's a
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:07.760]  video of it happening the feds don't prosecute them consumers fed up with
[02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:15.320]  early holiday sales the list goes on and on and on and on and then meanwhile the
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:20.960]  government is trying to stop people making fun of the TSA and the NSA
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:25.120]  threatening to arrest you if you do and we even have that announcement if you're
[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:30.080]  a new listener maybe we should queue up the TSA clip which TSA confirm they
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:36.960]  pair it nationwide down we will arrest you if you criticize us also you see the
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:42.800]  nation of fear the jitters university shut down after man reported with a knife
[02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:46.840]  or a gun half the time it's a water gun and people panic is this land of the
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:53.440]  free home of the brave this is the type of insanity that we are seeing unfold
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:59.360]  right now let's look at info wars calm and what's up on that site in the
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:04.400]  featured news area neocon max boot hates Edward Snowden and they go into a
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:09.280]  whole call to demonize Snowden arrest Snowden Snowden's a traitor but the
[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:14.800]  world knows that Snowden's a hero doesn't matter if Frida's acquaintance is
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:18.800]  telling me you know he's bad for having free speech or bad for not wanting
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:23.360]  reporters arrested they are the shameful people living in fear and groveling to it
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:27.080]  and living in denial see once you sign on to tyranny you start signing on to
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:29.560]  more and more because you never want to admit you're wrong you see that's how
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:34.760]  you get the exploits of tyrants like Hitler a cops Tays father trying to
[02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:39.360]  save his three-year-old son from house fire meanwhile they didn't go in to try
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:43.400]  to save the kid and they probably could have what cannot be said about Iraq
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:48.240]  Ron Paul has a big article out about how it was a total fraud and a lie that is
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:53.560]  just some of the news Breeders Cup attendees face TSA style security you
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:58.240]  were also reminded that any inappropriate remarks or jokes concerning
[02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:03.400]  security may result in your arrest we appreciate your cooperation while these
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:07.440]  measures are in effect that's right so don't criticize that you'll be arrested
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:12.720]  US government may force doctors to accept Obamacare and Medicare patients
[02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:20.000]  eventually at gunpoint that's right the tide of thefts and cargo hijackings and
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.960]  cattle wrestling is rising why is an epidemic of thievery sweeping America
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:29.800]  because we're in a depression folks pro-life group Texas abortionist killed
[02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:34.600]  live already born babies that's standard procedure yeah they put them on the
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:40.000]  shelf to die US points out that only tyrants treat journalists as terrorists
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:43.880]  while doing the exact same thing and if you criticize it well you're an
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:47.520]  extremist and have to be dealt with Anthony Frida illustrator is with us we
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:50.480]  were getting into all these things that are happening we were talking about the
[02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:54.840]  attack on free speech talking about the left-right paradigm in essence you've
[02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:58.920]  got the floor what do you want to say to the audience watching and listening out
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:03.520]  there about the state of our world and it was a great artist what would you say
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:08.520]  about folks rallying their art even if it's stick figures to go out and post
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:13.560]  posters in public to go out and and and speak in public to go out and really take
[02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:19.680]  the streets over not just cyberspace and and and turn loose the tide of liberty
[02:38:19.680 --> 02:38:23.000]  against these would-be censors I think that's the answer because they're so
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:26.800]  afraid of it they know it's what can defeat them well that is the answer and
[02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:31.320]  you know when I started in this game it was kind of probably just me and David
[02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:36.160]  D's doing Liberty artwork and I might want to been one of the first guys to
[02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:39.640]  put drones in a piece of art you know that potent symbol of everything that's
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:45.720]  wrong with America spying in illegal wars and just disgraceful cowardly acts of
[02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:50.200]  war crimes and it's all symbolizing that one image this is the power of the
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:56.920]  image so that use of imagery is very powerful and now anybody who has
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:01.480]  Photoshop pretty much can do what I do you know if they have half a brain they
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:04.480]  can figure out a way to make it interesting and make it compelling and
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:10.720]  make it ironic or sarcastic and and get it up online and get these memes going
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:14.800]  and this is exciting to me is it the macro democratization of ideas and of
[02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:19.760]  imagery rather than this top-down media which we've always lived with where you
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:22.880]  couldn't respond you do anything you do is yell at the TV or you know getting a
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:27.760]  fight with your friend at the bar and I'm interested in things that bring us
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:31.280]  together and make people think you know propaganda is designed to make people
[02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:36.280]  hate either glorify the state and make you feel like you're a part of reflected
[02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:41.600]  glory the state or demonize your enemy to make them less than human so they can
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:45.160]  be killed by soldiers this is what imagery has always been used by the
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:49.120]  trichoms you know totalitarian regimes back all the way back to the Romans you
[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:55.480]  know they had a huge towers glorifying their triumphs yeah towers and obelisks
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:40:01.800]  and and whatever but that's this is the ancient lineage of art types of good
[02:40:01.800 --> 02:40:07.160]  and evil and these are the two paradigms that we can use individual form to
[02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:10.720]  promote ideas and we need to turn the whole thing on our head and it's head
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:17.440]  and use as leverage we have as citizen journalists and social media and it's a
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:22.880]  powerful tool and it's it it's being used thank God by millions of people all
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:26.720]  over the world and it's having an effect we saw it in Syria we're seeing it
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:31.720]  happen have actual real effect and the oh there's a reason they take down memes
[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:35.400]  off Facebook Twitter that are just very simple especially your artwork and
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:38.680]  others and as you point out six seven eight years ago it was just you and
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:43.720]  David D's putting out memes and now everybody's doing it and it's the new
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:47.920]  political graffiti like they had in Rome and it's a rediscovery you don't
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:51.880]  just put some gang symbol up and only the gangs do it say it's my turf it's
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:57.000]  taking back the real graffiti the street art I just admire I just want to
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:03.160]  tell you this it's I admire what you're doing you are a trailblazer a general in
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:09.160]  the fight of reigniting a real discussion and that's why they're so scared of it
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:13.480]  and if you can become an art type and an example to others out there to realize
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:17.560]  the power they have that's one of the final dominoes to fall is people
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:21.280]  realizing I mean I'm not that skilled at what I do on many fronts but I'm angry
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:26.240]  I'm focused it's real it's effective so even if you're not an incredibly you
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:31.000]  know gifted artist like yourself I can go out with stuff I've done I mean I'll
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  be honest folks I get obsessed with a little bit sometime and go out with
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.840]  spray paint put political stuff up in the middle of the night anyways I don't
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:41.080]  have time to do it anymore the point is I can't help it I've got to fight them on
[02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:45.160]  every front and I've got to be out there where the cops could get me because it's
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:49.720]  got to be real you know that's what I'm ranting now go ahead no every front
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:54.580]  you're right and the the visual front is a powerful one and I mean to have this
[02:41:54.580 --> 02:41:58.120]  this is leverage where you can get an image seen by millions of people that's
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:01.200]  a powerful tool it used to be the only people could do that were you know the
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:05.320]  top-down media the government or Wolf Blitzer so give them the orders I mean
[02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:09.240]  give them the general you tell all those artists out there that are sitting on
[02:42:09.240 --> 02:42:12.600]  their butts what should they be doing right now you should take these ideas
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:15.880]  and I know you're out there and you're yelling at your friends that you're in
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:19.760]  a bar or you're yelling to TV and and you're upset about these things and let
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:23.240]  me tell you I did too I had a nickname my friends started calling me ranting
[02:42:23.240 --> 02:42:26.120]  because I like for a while I thought I was you I'll go out and start ranting
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:29.600]  about these things and it's not everybody can be that's because you're
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:33.360]  normal you're a man is supposed to get mad about this to pull it off most people
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:37.920]  it does you somehow you're able to do it most normal people like me you know what
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:41.480]  I draw my pictures whatever we all have a different our own way of making it
[02:42:41.480 --> 02:42:44.720]  happen we all can't be well if I see a new old-order billboard I'm going up on
[02:42:44.720 --> 02:42:49.160]  I mean I'm sick of these people take it the other thing is you know these
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:52.640]  surveillance cameras maybe a little spray paint might be heading their way I
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:55.960]  don't know who knows these things kind of got fell down hit their head though you
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:43:01.160]  know these is tragic but these things happen listen the other thing is do with
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:04.720]  humor you know it's like we can be too strident at some points and that's why
[02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:08.720]  I appreciate about you you you do have humor you use humor well plus I bring
[02:43:08.720 --> 02:43:12.400]  other people on I think that's the secret different angles yeah but it's like
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:14.880]  ask a while said if you're gonna tell people the truth you better make a
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:18.640]  blast or they'll kill you and that's really the heart of you know what we're
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:22.040]  trying to do we're trying to talk about serious issues and serious messages but
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:27.480]  if you just so didactic it becomes it pushes people away I agree well what
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:32.320]  makes you most mad you know the drugging of the kids all the fraudulent wars the
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:36.840]  funding al-qaeda well I think I think at the heart of it part of what I do is an
[02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:40.120]  anti-war message you know that that's it really drives me and that's what I've
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:43.440]  heard you call a lot of things but nobody ever calls you an anti-war activist
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:47.440]  but that's what you are I mean by by exposing these ideas of false flags and
[02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:51.240]  and making people question the pretext that bring us into these wars you're
[02:43:51.240 --> 02:43:55.680]  it's you know maybe preventing some wars sure sure you're supposed to just be a
[02:43:55.680 --> 02:44:00.720]  Ford Foundation fake left who really don't even do anything effectual they
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:04.720]  totally have taken over the anti-war movement since the 60s and again I'm
[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:10.640]  anti-aggressive fraudulent war crime yeah and and and that's what this is yeah
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:15.200]  I mean I don't want that going on in my name I get physically sick when they
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:18.160]  start a new war and are blowing up buildings and killing men women and
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:22.360]  children because my tax money is going to do that and then I'm between a rock and
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:25.600]  a hard place where I don't want to pay taxes but I know they'll arrest me if I
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:28.280]  don't plus I want to be able to have the political platform but then I feel
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:32.000]  guilty when I send the money into the Federal Reserve because I know it's
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.280]  being sent to kill women men women and children yeah well it's a matter I see
[02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:39.680]  every issue now the older I get on a moral basis it's not a political or
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:43.760]  partisan basis you know is this morally the right thing we should do it I mean
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:48.320]  should our resources be going to this war machine in this it's this you know
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:52.320]  surveillance state at home you know the police state and the war machine are two
[02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:57.200]  trillion dollar arms of this fear-based psychology this fear-based culture I
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:45:01.960]  mean we become culture of cowards we send drones instead of you know people
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:07.360]  to fight our wars and we you know strips first little children they say we are
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:11.240]  the ones who are afraid and paranoid I think anybody who strips first is a
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:14.200]  little American girl they're the ones who are scared they're the ones who
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:17.520]  apparently I was about to say they say I'm pushing fear the globalist are
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:21.680]  bringing in the fear I'm angry saying let's get up and take action and if some
[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:25.760]  people get scared by that I'm sorry they're cowards yeah I would be scared
[02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:30.800]  to not take action against this I mean that's where the real insanity is is
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:35.000]  that people think groveling is going to protect them well they use fear they
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:38.480]  always you fear that you know every government the history has used fear
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:44.200]  xenophobia and you know rationing that up and manipulating people's tribal
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:50.360]  instincts on on a cultural level and the fear of the other to to enact their
[02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:54.760]  their policies or gender whatever they are and they you're being manipulated I
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:58.760]  mean just like the way we were lied into Iraq every single pretext they they used
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:03.160]  to send us into that was a lie proven and you were saying at the time yet you
[02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:08.320]  know Wolf Blitzer and these you know other you know mainstream prostitutes
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:14.520]  were just so diligently reading the Pentagon talking points and reading the
[02:46:14.520 --> 02:46:19.320]  State Department talking points without any questioning with any you know
[02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:24.120]  introspection or any journalism they just read the things like they were the
[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:29.760]  you know press secretary and but that that's changed I think you don't see
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:32.680]  that as much anymore you know people question it more and skepticism is
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:36.960]  good you're not crazy to be a skeptic you're smart the people who believe
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:41.960]  everything that they're told they're the ones who are gullible and skeptical I
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:45.240]  mean oh I wonder who did that to that billboard I'd like to catch the things
[02:46:45.240 --> 02:46:51.800]  that I don't know just Colin Powell he would never lie to us on Juliana we've
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:56.880]  got 9-11's an inside job on General McChrystal we've got Pat Tillman killed
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:02.400]  and then on Colin Powell we've got Yellow Cake and anthrax and for those on
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:06.080]  radio somebody did a bad thing to a billboard if that actually wasn't me in
[02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:11.600]  that case that's horrible I'm really a little bird I know I might have done it
[02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:16.160]  but I images are powerful remember when Colin Powell held up that little vile
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:20.360]  anthrax and that image of him going like this holding that thing that basically
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:24.280]  launched a war because now we take it back like you've done yeah that's right I
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:27.680]  like to love bombs because that's what I call Obama's love bombs now listen you
[02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:31.320]  have inspired my work that's one thing you inspired you inspire a lot of stuff
[02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:35.200]  and I hear you and I just like I want it I guess I want to create a visual
[02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:39.040]  counterpart shouldn't they like the love bombs from the peace press should I mean
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:43.520]  it's love it's liberal and loving and you know what else have I inspired I mean
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:48.320]  just cuz I'm interested in it the dinosaur one the dinosaur media yeah
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:54.760]  yeah absolutely I think you've coined that term oh yeah and now a lot of it's
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:57.760]  Gerald to but but most of it's out of your brain that's why it's so original
[02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:00.800]  well I love working you know work by the way I see your stuff a lot and then
[02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:03.960]  inspires me for an angle on there too it's the same thing it's like that that's
[02:48:03.960 --> 02:48:08.360]  that great thing about creativity and collaboration yeah I love it and it's
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:11.240]  that whole feedback listen we're all on the same page and we're all we're the
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:15.160]  good guys the way I look at it I mean my god the way people demonize you it's
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:18.840]  insane to me you're fighting for their liberties to you're fighting for you
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:22.720]  know peace you're fighting to expose corruption I mean how could anybody have
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:26.680]  problem with that it's it's really is bizarre to me because um well it's
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:29.880]  because I do come off like a big redneck you know goblin or something but
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:32.680]  that's my nickname around here actually you're not the one killing people they
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:37.560]  are no no I agree people's I'm a guy threatened by classical tyranny being
[02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:42.760]  set up around me and my family and I feel guilty every day I haven't fled but
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:45.600]  they're more angry you than the people who are actually committing war crimes
[02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:48.160]  and actually taking the rights that they're supposed to be afforded as
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:51.480]  American citizens citizens away from them they're more angry well they're
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:55.680]  angry at us Anthony Frieda because we're pointing out that things are bad and
[02:48:55.680 --> 02:48:58.800]  they they want to be lazy and they don't want to hear about it so of course
[02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:03.040]  they've got to say the messengers the guy who's bad yeah listen I think I think
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:07.000]  the other thing I want to talk about is a partisanship I think it's ripping this
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:11.440]  country apart I mean people just want to hate the other it's it's it's the same
[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:15.360]  idea that you know starts wars where it's the other I admit I should be better
[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:18.520]  with the authoritarian liberals and actually explain how they've been caught
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:21.680]  in the culture they're in because I was mad at the bush people how like they
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:25.680]  were robots but now with Obama it's like three times the cult bush would have
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:29.440]  never gotten away with this and it makes me mad and then they they're like shut
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:32.800]  up right wing racist and it's just like what are you talking about see I know
[02:49:32.800 --> 02:49:39.600]  you're not a right wing race racist that's hard to say I know you're not
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:42.600]  because I listen to you back in the bush days and you were extremely critical
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:48.240]  and like I say that's what gives you credibility to me and I think people
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:51.840]  need to have hypocrisy on both sides where was the right when a bush was
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:55.800]  taking all rights away is launching these illegal wars and lying to us you
[02:49:55.800 --> 02:49:59.720]  know and now all sudden now when Obama does the left says it sure okay well I
[02:49:59.720 --> 02:50:02.880]  happen to know that Edward Snowden when I say something's off record I can't say
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:06.240]  how I know but I could say I know that I have to know that Snowden is a listener
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:09.840]  not just a Ron Paul supporter but you know just the way things work even
[02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:13.720]  folks like that so many times later I end up meeting a famous person or talk
[02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:17.800]  to them they go yeah I couldn't come on at first but you woke me up I had to
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:21.680]  come on later after the trial or after because you're so radical my advisors
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:25.560]  said don't go on that show no no we need to radicalize everybody because the
[02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:29.000]  globalist they're the radical tyrants we're actually not radical so by them
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:34.040]  saying we're radical we need to move the Overton window over where people get
[02:50:34.040 --> 02:50:39.840]  back to being radical libertarians radical peace people radical freedom folks
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:48.160]  radical free speech the radical good radical I mean they label normal
[02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:53.240]  instinct as radical we have to say yes we're radical I'm radically into love
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:56.520]  and freedom you are radically into bootlicking we'll be right back with

[02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:26.160]  folks the truth is we're at the same place the Germans were in about 1939 the
[02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:30.680]  same place the Russians were in the 30s as well we got a giant tyranny it's
[02:54:30.680 --> 02:54:36.240]  growing fast Edward Snowden victim it to cover his quote today he he said
[02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:40.840]  basically America has been taken over by criminal interest that are trying to
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:45.800]  grow as fast as they can and basically enslave everyone and that's what it is
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:50.920]  if there's a list of tyranny a list of bad things that happen in in oppressive
[02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:57.120]  countries our government is checking every box off until they grind through
[02:54:57.120 --> 02:55:02.480]  the paper with the pencil I mean they're just like grinding into it and like
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:08.400]  pouring black ink on it they're they're creating new boxes to check off of just
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:12.400]  over-the-top unbelievable tyranny microphones going up everywhere
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:15.120]  calling them gunshot detectors and then you go research about they're
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:19.680]  listening to everyone I mean it's just unbelievable and I'll tell you Arizona
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:23.480]  took out their speed cameras because people just kept climbing up on the
[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:28.400]  poles and smashing up a baseball bats only Arizona did that and again my
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:31.920]  issue is at a certain point when the government's totally criminal it
[02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:36.760]  becomes criminal to not resist them and we need to do everything we can short of
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:42.520]  violence to other people now to turn this around okay and you know I'm not
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:46.720]  saying you should climb up at night on billboards that are promoting vaccines
[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:52.360]  and say you know may kill you on it but I can't drive by a billboard that says
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:57.400]  that and then not literally wake up at 3 a.m. and not want to go drive out and do
[02:55:57.400 --> 02:56:00.600]  it I just can't help it I've got to physically fight them as well Anthony I
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:02.760]  mean what's it like for you you were kind of describing during the break that
[02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:06.440]  you I mean you get energized by the resistance people think it's like a work
[02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:10.680]  to to go out and and and create art against tyranny I find it to be
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:15.640]  energizing no it's not only that is a catharsis you know I everybody feels
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:19.920]  these passions and you see these this corruption and these outrages and and
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:23.480]  you don't know what to do with that you feel that that anxiety and that anger
[02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:27.240]  and that rage and you you want to channel challenge something positive and
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:32.160]  the way I can do it as an artist is to create these images and try to you know
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:35.360]  create a picture that is a starting point for a conversation about these
[02:56:35.360 --> 02:56:41.680]  things and that's what I'm all about but everybody has something they can do to
[02:56:41.680 --> 02:56:45.760]  channel that passion to something positive rather than negative and to make
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:51.640]  it about something other than just hating the other you know think about your
[02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:55.760]  enemy and think about how you can make them come to your side rather than just
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:56:59.600]  alienating them further from you and pushing them further away that's what's
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:03.440]  interesting you know it's it's very easy to just say I hate you and push you away
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:07.200]  it's it's a lot more difficult to try to create something that brings people
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:11.120]  together listen we're all Americans what is being a patriot is it saying I
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:14.360]  support the troops while you support a war that sends them into a meat grinder
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:18.440]  I don't think so it's about preserving the things that made this country great
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:23.440]  that made us special and and now these ideas are being demonized I mean it's
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:26.960]  insane by the way America was special because you had more opportunity here
[02:57:26.960 --> 02:57:30.360]  and weren't born into a cast it wasn't perfect but better than all the rest
[02:57:30.360 --> 02:57:33.640]  folks from all the other countries will tell you that now we're becoming just
[02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:37.720]  like all those others on an index of economic freedom the US isn't even in
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:41.600]  the top 10 now we used to be number one we're also number one everything else
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:45.560]  we were exceptional we had some problems and we let criminals come in and
[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:49.760]  guilt us in to a new form of authoritarianism not to get rid of our
[02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:53.040]  authoritarian tendencies that we already had but to create something even worse
[02:57:53.040 --> 02:57:57.320]  I just thought of a great artwork you could say support the troops and have
[02:57:57.320 --> 02:58:01.600]  like some pro war guy pointing and show them being fed into a meat grinder
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:06.640]  yeah see I gotta I gotta take it was my notebook no but you were just saying
[02:58:06.640 --> 02:58:11.480]  that that'd be good no but I love and the other thing is kind of like try to
[02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:15.360]  think outside the box you know don't think about just the left right think
[02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:19.280]  about right wrong that's really the big picture I agree let's come back and take

[02:59:58.480 --> 03:00:01.840]  network network
[03:00:05.200 --> 03:00:12.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[03:00:12.960 --> 03:00:20.480]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[03:00:20.480 --> 03:00:24.040]  Alex Jones
[03:00:31.160 --> 03:00:34.880]  well I did get to a lot of your calls earlier and I'm sorry some folks have
[03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:37.960]  been having to hold the entity freedom is our guest here I want to jam in a few
[03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:42.160]  final calls from folks of holding the longest like Tony and Lewis I think the
[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:45.320]  others unfortunately we're out of time if you call back tomorrow I'll get you
[03:00:45.320 --> 03:00:49.400]  on Anthony you were making a good point during that one minute break yeah I
[03:00:49.400 --> 03:00:52.960]  think it's important just like you do shatter these paradigms a left right
[03:00:52.960 --> 03:00:56.880]  paradigm and and think of the bigger picture I mean these people you know if
[03:00:56.880 --> 03:00:59.640]  you hate Democrats you think all the problems in the world are their fault
[03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:02.120]  or if you hear Republicans you think all the problems in the other world are
[03:01:02.120 --> 03:01:04.480]  their fault you know these are your neighbors these are the kids teaching
[03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:08.200]  your kids at school these are not your enemy we need to try to figure out ways
[03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:12.640]  to bring them together I agree Matt Drudge tweeted famously that it's not
[03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:17.040]  about left and right anymore it's about libertarian versus authoritarian yeah
[03:01:17.040 --> 03:01:22.480]  and that's really like a moral thing is this fair is this moral is this more
[03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:26.600]  freedom or less I mean every issue has a moral component and that's you know the
[03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:29.240]  older you get the more mature you get hopefully you start to see things on a
[03:01:29.240 --> 03:01:34.120]  moral and not a partisan perspective that's a good quote Anthony Frida you
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:37.880]  need to see things on a moral not a partisan perspective but to know the
[03:01:37.880 --> 03:01:40.760]  moral perspective you've got to research things and that's the difference yeah
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:44.160]  you've got to actually know what's going on and the truth will set you free
[03:01:44.160 --> 03:01:49.720]  let's go to Tony we got three Tonys in the building now Tony Tony and we got
[03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:53.960]  Anthony Gutiarty back there too go ahead Tony you're on the air hey doing
[03:01:53.960 --> 03:01:58.640]  Alex good buddy I found something pretty good and and the research I was doing you
[03:01:58.640 --> 03:02:02.360]  know you helped wake me up about five or six years ago but what I found with all
[03:02:02.360 --> 03:02:06.560]  these fraudulent ordinances going on in every town that people always want to
[03:02:06.560 --> 03:02:09.680]  know what they can do to fight it well what you can do is you can look at the
[03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:13.400]  ordinance and when they tell you you violated if you find out that it doesn't
[03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:17.480]  reference any state law right that it's a fraud right red light red light
[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:21.520]  cameras don't have an officer issuing the citation they're all unconstitutional
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:25.040]  and if you fight them on that ground they instantly throw it out hoping they
[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:30.040]  can not you know but the other folks in there know that it's illegal and what I
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:33.880]  found too was just sending the letter letting them know that I'm more than
[03:02:33.880 --> 03:02:37.040]  willing to go to court but I am going to be demanding my pre-trial hearing to
[03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:40.800]  start my due process and then right away you're like the plague they want nothing
[03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:46.720]  to do with you again very very well said God bless you yeah 90 plus percent of
[03:02:46.720 --> 03:02:51.480]  what they do is completely fraudulent and they know it I mean you've got in
[03:02:51.480 --> 03:02:57.240]  small towns in in places like California and Michigan small town city managers
[03:02:57.240 --> 03:03:01.920]  making 800 grand a year while they're taking all ladies houses I mean this is
[03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:06.880]  robbery that's all that's happened that's America and then that's why they
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:10.040]  want everybody on a little bit of welfare so you don't complain hey you get
[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:14.880]  your 500 bucks a month I get my 100,000 a month now sit down and shut up you know
[03:03:14.880 --> 03:03:18.040]  I had an idea about the red light cameras I haven't done it yet but I think it
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:21.080]  would be brilliant to purposely go through a red light camera when this you
[03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:23.920]  know when it's safe and there's nobody there in the middle of nowhere and have
[03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:29.040]  a sign as you go through you know when they photograph you that says screw you
[03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:33.040]  big brother or has some political slogan on it that'll be photographed and sent
[03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:36.360]  to you now people do this all over the country they'll have these images of
[03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:41.360]  Liberty messages being photographed on the front and backs is put it in your
[03:03:41.360 --> 03:03:48.320]  front windshield on the side you know a little sign or maybe big sign and then
[03:03:48.320 --> 03:03:54.320]  you have that that's like screw you in SA yeah that's it and then they're upset
[03:03:54.320 --> 03:03:57.160]  that you're doing it and threaten to arrest you how dare you say that I'm
[03:03:57.160 --> 03:04:01.520]  watching you and I'm stealing your rights how dare you resist in any way
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:04.920]  scum anyway they prove that it's you if that when that picture of you is how
[03:04:04.920 --> 03:04:07.800]  they prove that's you driving that car I hear you man it's amazing having you
[03:04:07.800 --> 03:04:14.680]  here Lewis in New York real fast brother hello go ahead yeah Alex Jones we
[03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:19.480]  haven't fully implemented the disasters of bomber care but already seeing a lot
[03:04:19.480 --> 03:04:25.480]  of liberals and Democrats like I was watching MSNBS the other day and
[03:04:25.480 --> 03:04:30.760]  they were talking about how well we're just not messing with this website just
[03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:35.560]  getting Medicare for everybody and the other day too I was on Facebook on one
[03:04:35.560 --> 03:04:40.200]  of those liberal pages and they were saying oh no but I like a single pair
[03:04:40.200 --> 03:04:44.920]  system better and the other another guy comedy is no no don't worry these are
[03:04:44.920 --> 03:04:49.160]  just baby steps I know we need to do articles because Drudge rightfully
[03:04:49.160 --> 03:04:52.240]  scaring the little clip of the architects saying this they're all
[03:04:52.240 --> 03:04:56.600]  over saying it they call my show they go oh Obama's a genius he's gonna wreck
[03:04:56.600 --> 03:05:24.360]  everything you're taking over the communism
