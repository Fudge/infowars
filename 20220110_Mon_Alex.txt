[00:00.000 --> 00:28.920]  Under the cover of darkness and urgent mission to bring infected people to safety, both communities
[00:28.920 --> 00:34.880]  have now been placed in a hard lockdown in the searing 40 degree heat they'll be confined
[00:34.880 --> 00:40.760]  to these homes, with food and supports delivered at a distance by rapid response teams, a hard
[00:40.760 --> 00:43.960]  measure that could remain in place for weeks.
[00:43.960 --> 00:48.040]  This is a camp in Siberia, scores of Russians are being kept here.
[00:48.040 --> 00:53.400]  Surely this government is aware of the intentions to build these isolation camps from coast
[00:53.400 --> 00:59.240]  coast, and my question to the premier is, how many of these camps will be built, and
[00:59.240 --> 01:02.800]  how many people does this government expect to do so?
[01:02.800 --> 01:06.760]  What was it like for you and your family inside this quarantine hotel?
[01:06.760 --> 01:10.120]  Can you describe what you went through?
[01:10.120 --> 01:11.120]  Thanks Evan.
[01:11.120 --> 01:12.120]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:12.120 --> 01:18.800]  I mean, it was an extremely difficult and, you know, onerous and traumatic process for
[01:18.800 --> 01:20.440]  myself and our two daughters.
[01:20.440 --> 01:26.160]  As 2022 begins, the great reset rollout of predetermined COVID quarantine camps is digging
[01:26.160 --> 01:30.200]  its claws into the blue dictatorships of the United States.
[01:30.200 --> 01:35.240]  As Infowars Jamie White reports, the state of Washington may amend a law to allow the
[01:35.240 --> 01:41.280]  forcible detainment of residents into COVID internment camps for defying state vaccine
[01:41.280 --> 01:42.280]  mandates.
[01:42.280 --> 01:46.880]  The proposed revision to the COVID protocol under the Communicable and Certain Other Diseases
[01:46.880 --> 01:52.920]  Act would grant local health officers, at his other sole discretion, to issue an emergency
[01:52.920 --> 01:57.960]  detention order causing a person or group of persons to be immediately detained for
[01:57.960 --> 02:00.600]  purposes of isolation or quarantine.
[02:00.600 --> 02:05.480]  Additionally, the measure would allow law enforcement to assist public health officials
[02:05.480 --> 02:09.320]  in detaining residents who refused the COVID injection.
[02:09.320 --> 02:14.240]  This alarming measure comes in tandem with Governor Jay Inslee's effort to hire strike
[02:14.240 --> 02:19.920]  teams to run quarantine camps outlined in the state's governmentjobs.com website, a
[02:19.920 --> 02:24.960]  term that has since been scrubbed from the website sometime after the bulletin was posted
[02:24.960 --> 02:26.800]  in September 2021.
[02:26.800 --> 02:32.480]  Notably, the Communicable and Certain Other Diseases Act was certified on October 25,
[02:32.480 --> 02:38.800]  2019, just months before the COVID-19 pandemic began in January of 2020.
[02:38.800 --> 02:46.000]  Omicron is very contagious, much more contagious than the Delta variant, and it is rapidly
[02:46.000 --> 02:52.520]  overtaking the Delta variant already in the infections in the state of Washington, as
[02:52.520 --> 02:53.520]  well as nationally.
[02:53.520 --> 02:58.920]  Meanwhile, New York Governor Kathy Hochul attempts to pass a similar bill allowing authorities
[02:58.920 --> 03:03.240]  to forcibly detain anyone she deems a public health threat.
[03:03.240 --> 03:09.920]  The bill, called A.416, would allow the governor or the appropriate health official to order
[03:09.920 --> 03:15.880]  the removal and detention of any person afflicted with a communicable disease in the event that
[03:15.880 --> 03:21.880]  there is a state of health emergency declared by the governor in relation to such disease.
[03:21.880 --> 03:27.440]  It goes on to say that any person or group removed or detained by order of the governor
[03:27.440 --> 03:33.280]  or his or her delegate shall be detained for as long as the department may direct.
[03:33.280 --> 03:34.840]  We are not through this pandemic.
[03:34.840 --> 03:39.680]  I wished we were, but I prayed a lot to God during this time.
[03:39.680 --> 03:40.680]  And you know what?
[03:40.680 --> 03:42.760]  God did answer our prayers.
[03:42.760 --> 03:47.800]  He made the smartest men and women, the scientists, the doctors, the researchers.
[03:47.800 --> 03:50.400]  He made them come up with a vaccine.
[03:50.400 --> 03:52.560]  That is from God to us.
[03:52.560 --> 03:55.400]  And we must say thank you, God.
[03:55.400 --> 03:56.400]  Thank you.
[03:56.400 --> 04:00.240]  I bear my vaccinated necklace all the time to say I'm vaccinated.
[04:00.240 --> 04:05.520]  Washington State Board of Health will hold a virtual public meeting on January 12th to
[04:05.520 --> 04:10.480]  discuss the implementation to the revision of the COVID protocol under the Communicable
[04:10.480 --> 04:36.480]  and Certain Other Diseases Act, John Bowne reporting.
[04:36.480 --> 05:01.200]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[05:01.200 --> 05:06.040]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[05:06.040 --> 05:08.000]  the globalists are doing right now.
[05:08.000 --> 05:09.720]  This is their big offensive.
[05:09.720 --> 05:11.120]  This is their takeover.
[05:11.120 --> 05:15.120]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[05:15.120 --> 05:19.160]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[05:19.160 --> 05:20.160]  in the open.
[05:20.160 --> 05:24.680]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[05:24.680 --> 05:28.920]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[05:28.920 --> 05:32.200]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[05:32.200 --> 05:36.880]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[05:36.880 --> 05:37.880]  you keep us on air.
[05:37.880 --> 05:41.680]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock,
[05:41.680 --> 05:45.200]  50% off, X2 and Winter Sun.
[05:45.200 --> 05:48.800]  Both of these are on our top five best sellers that are so good for your body and if there's
[05:48.800 --> 05:51.960]  two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[05:51.960 --> 05:56.600]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[05:56.600 --> 06:12.360]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[06:12.360 --> 06:18.080]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[06:18.080 --> 06:21.280]  Good news.
[06:21.280 --> 06:23.280]  Oh yeah?
[06:23.280 --> 06:27.000]  Yeah, we've rolled back the ban on gain of function research, really.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  So now it's legal for us to modify viruses and make them more deadly and transmissible
[06:31.000 --> 06:32.000]  to humans.
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.200]  Why would you want to do that?
[06:33.200 --> 06:36.080]  Well, it's important that we be prepared in case something like that happened in the
[06:36.080 --> 06:37.080]  future.
[06:37.080 --> 06:41.360]  In case somebody modifies a deadly virus to be more infectious and able to transmit to
[06:41.360 --> 06:42.360]  humans.
[06:42.360 --> 06:43.360]  Can you imagine?
[06:43.360 --> 06:44.680]  Yeah, sounds dangerous.
[06:44.680 --> 06:46.080]  No, no, no, it's fine.
[06:46.080 --> 06:50.480]  We're doing it at a level four weapons research lab in Wuhan, China.
[06:50.480 --> 06:51.480]  Very secure.
[06:51.480 --> 06:53.160]  Okay, good.
[06:53.160 --> 06:54.160]  Real news.
[06:54.160 --> 06:55.160]  Oh no.
[06:55.160 --> 06:59.240]  There's been an outbreak of a mysterious new respiratory virus in Wuhan, China.
[06:59.240 --> 07:01.840]  Wuhan, China, like where the research lab is?
[07:01.840 --> 07:04.600]  Yeah, yeah, exactly, like right where the lab is.
[07:04.600 --> 07:06.240]  So do you think it could have come from the lab?
[07:06.240 --> 07:09.280]  No, absolutely not.
[07:09.280 --> 07:11.760]  I'd see how you could make that mistake, but no, no, no.
[07:11.760 --> 07:16.400]  The virus, the deadly virus with the artificial fur and cleavage sites that make it able to
[07:16.400 --> 07:21.160]  infect humans, that came from the farmer's market down the road from the dangerous bioweapons
[07:21.160 --> 07:22.160]  lab.
[07:22.160 --> 07:25.280]  Just to believe that, I'll ban you from the internet if you don't.
[07:25.280 --> 07:26.280]  Oh god.
[07:26.280 --> 07:29.960]  No need to worry, the global medical establishment's always preparing for these types of things.
[07:29.960 --> 07:34.320]  In fact, like two months ago, they held a course called Event 201 where they basically
[07:34.320 --> 07:38.440]  predicted exactly what would happen right down to the type of virus and where it came
[07:38.440 --> 07:39.440]  from.
[07:39.440 --> 07:40.440]  So they're like totally on top of this.
[07:40.440 --> 07:43.680]  Actually, they're going to do nothing for months and let it spread all over the world.
[07:43.680 --> 07:47.080]  But it started in China, right, like can't we at least halt travel with them?
[07:47.080 --> 07:49.160]  I didn't realize you were a racist.
[07:49.160 --> 07:50.160]  What?
[07:50.160 --> 07:54.720]  I didn't realize you had some deep, seething, hatred of Asian people and in fact, I think
[07:54.720 --> 07:55.720]  it's despicable.
[07:55.720 --> 07:57.720]  Well, I'm talking about the virus.
[07:57.720 --> 07:58.720]  Oh, the virus?
[07:58.720 --> 07:59.720]  It's here now.
[07:59.720 --> 08:00.720]  Yeah, I bet.
[08:00.720 --> 08:01.720]  Yeah, it came on a plane from China.
[08:01.720 --> 08:02.720]  There's nothing we could do.
[08:02.720 --> 08:05.040]  Well, what do we know about the virus so far?
[08:05.040 --> 08:08.360]  Not a lot, but we're going to go ahead and assume that it's the deadliest thing in the
[08:08.360 --> 08:09.840]  world and everybody's scared.
[08:09.840 --> 08:10.840]  We're all scared.
[08:10.840 --> 08:12.680]  You didn't seem very worried about it when it was in China.
[08:12.680 --> 08:14.720]  Well, no, no, I was calling you a racist then.
[08:14.720 --> 08:15.720]  That's what was important.
[08:15.720 --> 08:17.560]  But now we're very scared of the virus.
[08:17.560 --> 08:18.560]  Everybody's scared.
[08:18.560 --> 08:19.560]  You're scared.
[08:19.560 --> 08:22.840]  You're scared of certain ages or populations or groups, anything like that.
[08:22.840 --> 08:25.920]  Yeah, actually, it's way deadlier to the elderly and the sick.
[08:25.920 --> 08:27.800]  Okay, well, why don't we start by protecting them?
[08:27.800 --> 08:31.720]  I know we're actually going to send COVID infected patients into nursing homes instead.
[08:31.720 --> 08:34.280]  Geez, well, okay, well, what are you doing to stop the spread?
[08:34.280 --> 08:38.280]  UV lights, vitamin C, vitamin D, should I wear a mask?
[08:38.280 --> 08:41.560]  We know that masks don't really stop you from getting this type of infection.
[08:41.560 --> 08:43.640]  The science is pretty much settled on this.
[08:43.640 --> 08:44.640]  Masks don't work.
[08:44.640 --> 08:45.840]  Okay, so no masks.
[08:45.840 --> 08:48.400]  Actually they're mandatory and also we're shutting down everything.
[08:48.400 --> 08:49.400]  Wait, what?
[08:49.400 --> 08:50.400]  Yeah, it's called lockdown.
[08:50.400 --> 08:53.760]  I'm basically declaring martial law and saying that you can't leave your house or gather
[08:53.760 --> 08:54.760]  in large groups.
[08:54.760 --> 08:57.480]  Well, how do you think you're going to get people to go along with this?
[08:57.480 --> 09:00.200]  Well, it's only for two weeks.
[09:00.200 --> 09:03.040]  It's going to last forever, isn't it?
[09:03.040 --> 09:04.040]  Maybe.
[09:04.040 --> 09:06.880]  And you're shutting everything down, everything, every restaurant, every store.
[09:06.880 --> 09:08.160]  Yep, absolutely everything.
[09:08.160 --> 09:09.160]  Everything's shut down.
[09:09.160 --> 09:10.160]  We're all in this together.
[09:10.160 --> 09:12.400]  So even like Walmart and Target, no, they can stay open.
[09:12.400 --> 09:15.000]  What about like McDonald's or Taco Bell?
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.400]  Obviously, McDonald's and Taco Bell can stay open.
[09:17.400 --> 09:21.800]  Okay, so the big chain stores can stay open, but if a small business tries to stay open,
[09:21.800 --> 09:25.360]  we will send a tank and point a rifle in their face and maybe send them to jail.
[09:25.360 --> 09:28.040]  But it's only for two weeks or years or whatever.
[09:28.040 --> 09:29.400]  I mean, won't that crash the economy?
[09:29.400 --> 09:31.040]  Oh yeah, 100% for sure.
[09:31.040 --> 09:32.920]  Okay, but this stops the virus.
[09:32.920 --> 09:33.920]  It does not, no.
[09:33.920 --> 09:37.960]  Okay, other than masks that don't work and lockdowns that don't work, is there anything
[09:37.960 --> 09:39.240]  else you suggest that we do?
[09:39.240 --> 09:40.640]  Oh, I'm not suggesting anything.
[09:40.640 --> 09:44.400]  I'm imposing plastic barriers and social distancing as well.
[09:44.400 --> 09:45.400]  Okay, so those work?
[09:45.400 --> 09:46.920]  No, of course not.
[09:46.920 --> 09:47.920]  It's ridiculous.
[09:47.920 --> 09:48.920]  Just think about it.
[09:48.920 --> 09:52.480]  But we do encourage contact tracing where you download our app to your phone and then use
[09:52.480 --> 09:55.600]  it to log everywhere you go and everything you do and everyone you interact with.
[09:55.600 --> 09:57.920]  It sounds like a precursor to vaccine passports.
[09:57.920 --> 09:59.920]  No way, that's crazy.
[09:59.920 --> 10:03.680]  Hey, by the way, we sent a investigative team to figure out the origins of the virus.
[10:03.680 --> 10:05.120]  Oh, so you're investigating the lab?
[10:05.120 --> 10:06.120]  No.
[10:06.120 --> 10:08.120]  Okay, well, who are you sending to investigate?
[10:08.120 --> 10:09.120]  The guy who runs the lab.
[10:09.120 --> 10:11.240]  Yeah, this sounds suspicious.
[10:11.240 --> 10:12.240]  It's not.
[10:12.240 --> 10:14.160]  I mean, the whole thing sounds sketchy.
[10:14.160 --> 10:15.680]  Nothing you're saying really makes any sense.
[10:15.680 --> 10:19.160]  And it seems like the same people imposing the masks and lockdowns are the same people
[10:19.160 --> 10:22.640]  that are benefiting from it and it seems like it's going to have way worse long term effects
[10:22.640 --> 10:23.640]  than the virus itself.
[10:23.640 --> 10:25.920]  I mean, all of this seems arbitrary and expensive.
[10:25.920 --> 10:30.480]  Well, it's only until we get the vaccine and actually it's going to be a wonderful revolutionary
[10:30.480 --> 10:32.520]  new mRNA vaccine.
[10:32.520 --> 10:34.880]  So you know, thank God we have Bill Gates helping us with this.
[10:34.880 --> 10:39.600]  Bill Gates, isn't he the one who thinks the most pressing issue the Earth faces is overpopulation
[10:39.600 --> 10:43.360]  and that the best way to reduce population is through vaccines?
[10:43.360 --> 10:44.920]  Didn't he give a TED talk to that effect?
[10:44.920 --> 10:45.920]  No.
[10:45.920 --> 10:46.920]  Shut up.
[10:46.920 --> 10:47.920]  He loves you.
[10:47.920 --> 10:48.920]  Very important report.
[10:48.920 --> 10:49.920]  It's not even satire.
[10:49.920 --> 11:00.920]  It's what they actually say from Harrison Smith in the American Journal section of band.video
[11:00.920 --> 11:07.080]  or freeworldnews.tv COVID pitch meeting is the name.
[11:07.080 --> 11:08.080]  Half million views there.
[11:08.080 --> 11:11.560]  It's got about a million views on Twitter, a couple million on Instagram.
[11:11.560 --> 11:20.560]  Good job, Harrison, Smith and team.
[11:20.560 --> 11:26.840]  Now ladies and gentlemen, there is so much to talk about and so much to break down today
[11:26.840 --> 11:35.680]  and we've really reached a point in society and in civilization where we have to decide
[11:35.680 --> 11:39.040]  whether we're going to admit to ourselves the position we're in.
[11:39.040 --> 11:47.680]  We are witnessing a orchestrated global war run by behavioral psychologists at the behest
[11:47.680 --> 11:54.200]  of the most powerful wealthy families on Earth who have decided to destroy civilization and
[11:54.200 --> 12:01.600]  carry out a depopulation agenda while they pose as saviors during the collapse as they
[12:01.600 --> 12:08.800]  surf the destruction of the human community into their organized implosion.
[12:08.800 --> 12:14.000]  They believe that that implosion is coming regardless so they want to organize it and
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.800]  control it so they're left in power on the other side and then they'll use the rest of
[12:18.800 --> 12:23.160]  us that survive as guinea pigs for all of their transhumanism.
[12:23.160 --> 12:27.080]  That is where we are and that's why so much evil is afoot.
[12:27.080 --> 12:29.640]  That's why you see so much corruption.
[12:29.640 --> 12:34.640]  That's why you see so much stuff put out that doesn't make sense and that is contradictory.
[12:34.640 --> 12:38.560]  That is meant to make you give up on your life.
[12:38.560 --> 12:46.960]  Give up on your job, give up on your children, give up on God and basically just roll over
[12:46.960 --> 12:56.000]  so that the controllers can put you in a learned helplessness fetal position.
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.080]  Well, if you're conscious of this attack and you educate others about the attack and then
[13:01.080 --> 13:08.040]  they're aware of why this is happening and that there's a methodology to this evil, then
[13:08.040 --> 13:12.920]  we can really turn it around together and have a massive effect.
[13:12.920 --> 13:16.920]  But if we don't, it's only going to get progressively worse.
[13:16.920 --> 13:22.060]  Now, almost every show I say we've got the biggest COVID news yet because just new devastating
[13:22.060 --> 13:24.960]  information is coming out daily.
[13:24.960 --> 13:31.280]  Coming up, there is just a huge article that links to news in the UK that is the most insane
[13:31.280 --> 13:32.280]  ever.
[13:32.280 --> 13:34.440]  Because they actually published their medical numbers there.
[13:34.440 --> 13:39.960]  Remember, it's been out for about seven, eight months in the UK that you're twice as likely
[13:39.960 --> 13:42.960]  to get COVID and be hospitalized and or die.
[13:42.960 --> 13:48.400]  So it's all twice as likely if you've had the double or triple check.
[13:48.400 --> 13:52.840]  Now the official UK government numbers that you can go to, that I can go to, say that
[13:52.840 --> 13:59.720]  nearly 75% of UK COVID deaths were vaxed government data shows.
[13:59.720 --> 14:07.800]  Again, believable information and we've got all the statistics from the government website
[14:07.800 --> 14:12.400]  that mirrors what the EU's reporting and even what our own VAERS reporting saying.
[14:12.400 --> 14:13.640]  So this is what's crazy.
[14:13.640 --> 14:18.280]  It's kind of like you check your engine light and if it's red, you know you got a problem
[14:18.280 --> 14:22.840]  or if you run out of gas and it's blinking saying low fuel, I mean you know that gauge
[14:22.840 --> 14:23.840]  is accurate.
[14:23.840 --> 14:28.840]  Well, we don't just need the actual gauge from the government.
[14:28.840 --> 14:34.000]  We see all the heart attacks and death of these celebrities and football players and
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.400]  others soccer players everywhere.
[14:36.400 --> 14:40.760]  This is mass death and that ties into a huge report that we're linked to in the live show
[14:40.760 --> 14:41.760]  feed.
[14:41.760 --> 14:43.600]  It's also from Gateway Pundit.
[14:43.600 --> 14:50.200]  Massive 145 countries study shows sharp increase of transmission and death after introduction
[14:50.200 --> 14:52.440]  of COVID vaccines.
[14:52.440 --> 14:53.440]  There's the actual study.
[14:53.440 --> 14:57.040]  That is coming up here today.
[14:57.040 --> 14:59.800]  At the bottom of the hour, I've got some other news I want to hit and tell you what's coming
[14:59.800 --> 15:01.480]  up in the next segment.
[15:01.480 --> 15:04.760]  Separately, I want to thank you all for your support.
[15:04.760 --> 15:07.720]  There's a lot of fake corporate media outlets out there claiming that we're just rolling
[15:07.720 --> 15:10.240]  and all this extra money and we don't need support.
[15:10.240 --> 15:11.240]  That's fake news.
[15:11.240 --> 15:12.480]  That's twisted information.
[15:12.480 --> 15:13.640]  That's a lie.
[15:13.640 --> 15:18.680]  Info wars could easily implode or even shut down in the next six months if you don't continue
[15:18.680 --> 15:20.640]  to buy the great products at infowarstore.com.
[15:20.640 --> 15:25.200]  And I don't want to prove the mainstream media right again by shutting down.
[15:25.200 --> 15:28.080]  That's their goal and they want us shut down.

[18:04.080 --> 18:08.400]  why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth and we could never

[18:55.640 --> 18:59.840]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[18:59.840 --> 19:04.480]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad, wait till they've
[19:04.480 --> 19:09.920]  got their world ID in and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[19:09.920 --> 19:16.320]  And Closwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that once they've
[19:16.320 --> 19:21.760]  gotten you with that system then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere you go and track
[19:21.760 --> 19:26.640]  what you do and publicly they're saying they're going to decide when you can travel and when
[19:26.640 --> 19:31.960]  you can't travel and MasterCard and then all the other big companies are currently announcing
[19:31.960 --> 19:37.320]  they're going to track what you do and where you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it.
[19:37.320 --> 19:40.920]  This is the holy grail of tyranny ladies and gentlemen.
[19:40.920 --> 19:44.160]  This is the takeover and humanity better wake up and say no.
[19:44.160 --> 19:47.640]  Finally folks are starting to wake up, Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others who leave the
[19:47.640 --> 19:50.400]  charts along with info wars but it's not enough.
[19:50.400 --> 19:54.360]  Every individual has to not comply and we have to talk of bringing the globalists to
[19:54.360 --> 19:55.360]  justice.
[19:55.360 --> 20:01.600]  You see they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully.
[20:01.600 --> 20:06.040]  Bringing a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[20:06.040 --> 20:30.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:30.120 --> 20:37.240]  I'm going to try to be calm about all this but none of what the globalists are doing
[20:37.240 --> 20:41.720]  makes sense until you understand that they really hate humans and that they really want
[20:41.720 --> 20:46.960]  to kill the majority of the population and then in their own cosmology, their own worldview,
[20:46.960 --> 20:53.240]  their own religion, they believe that they're going to transcend and not be humans anymore.
[20:53.240 --> 20:56.920]  You can say they cooked this up in their own psychotic brains, you can say they were demonically
[20:56.920 --> 21:02.800]  influenced, you can say whatever you want about it, you can say you believe in other
[21:02.800 --> 21:05.520]  entities in the universe or you don't.
[21:05.520 --> 21:14.760]  The point is they're doing this, this is happening, this is real.
[21:14.760 --> 21:22.080]  And that's why there is a war on common sense because they've got to get you to suspend
[21:22.080 --> 21:28.760]  your common sense and just go into herd mindless group think if they're going to succeed.
[21:28.760 --> 21:35.560]  And I know I'm stating the obvious to all the listeners and viewers but the world is
[21:35.560 --> 21:44.200]  being inducted into an artificial collapse and all the different ethnic and regional
[21:44.200 --> 21:51.520]  and historical divisions are being hyped up as the political, economic, cultural cover
[21:51.520 --> 21:58.320]  for the design collapse that brings in the world cashless society and with that the world
[21:58.320 --> 22:04.040]  social credit score you'll have to be able to even have access to the marketplace and
[22:04.040 --> 22:12.520]  with that more and more insane social controls that you'll be made to accept and comply with
[22:12.520 --> 22:18.680]  just for the right to be able to leave your house or to get medicine or food or have a
[22:18.680 --> 22:26.480]  job and in the process of that it shuts down the entire economy that is not owned by a
[22:26.480 --> 22:28.640]  handful of big banks.
[22:28.640 --> 22:35.560]  This is economic war, this is the most sophisticated savage attack on humanity ever seen in history
[22:35.560 --> 22:39.680]  by dozens of magnitudes.
[22:39.680 --> 22:47.800]  It isn't 100% worse, it isn't 1,000% worse, it isn't, it's 50,000 times more sophisticated.
[22:47.800 --> 22:56.720]  It is multi-faceted, multi-dimensional, complete, multi-disciplinary attack on everything good
[22:56.720 --> 23:06.400]  and decent and wholesome by the corrupt ruling oligarchs, the behavioral psychologists that
[23:06.400 --> 23:12.800]  are doing this and what's sick is there are millions of people that know about this and
[23:12.800 --> 23:18.600]  have joined with the evil and are actually working for it, you know something that shocked
[23:18.600 --> 23:25.360]  me more than a decade ago was to learn that I was actually recruiting people for the New
[23:25.360 --> 23:30.720]  World Order as a byproduct of what we do because a lot of people would learn about this, find
[23:30.720 --> 23:38.720]  out about it and then go and join it and that's a blind spot I had, I didn't really ever think
[23:38.720 --> 23:44.880]  you wake up people that are in a trance but they were already corrupt and selfish and
[23:44.880 --> 23:51.880]  evil and bad and had a proclivity towards the dark side, towards Satanism and then when
[23:51.880 --> 23:57.400]  you wake them up they just take their low-level scams and low-level lies and low-level evil
[23:57.400 --> 24:03.800]  and they parlay it into the big leagues and it was that understanding that really let
[24:03.800 --> 24:07.560]  me understand the devil's plan because that's how it works.
[24:07.560 --> 24:12.560]  As the system gets more corrupt and evil, people give up on the good system and join
[24:12.560 --> 24:16.480]  with the evil because they want to survive or they want to be in charge or they're tired
[24:16.480 --> 24:21.520]  of losing and I'm sure most of you right now are saying yeah Alex that's how the world
[24:21.520 --> 24:26.760]  works, you didn't know that, see you're smarter than I am in many ways, I have a blind side
[24:26.760 --> 24:30.360]  to just think most people are good and if most people knew the truth they'd care and
[24:30.360 --> 24:37.280]  do something and most people actually are deep down good and that they want to be good
[24:37.280 --> 24:40.560]  but they're so naive and just can't believe that evil exists so they can't get their
[24:40.560 --> 24:45.240]  minds wrapped around it but there's a good percentage of people that didn't get the
[24:45.240 --> 24:48.800]  wider world to know how it worked and it was kind of like when you sent somebody to prison
[24:48.800 --> 24:53.840]  for ten years and they come out with a college degree in crime, they may go in there just
[24:53.840 --> 24:58.880]  because they got in a bar fight and hit the guy and he fell over and died so you get manslaughter
[24:58.880 --> 25:03.280]  ten years in prison but when you come out you can't get a regular job now but you know
[25:03.280 --> 25:07.040]  how to do all sorts of scams, all sorts of crimes because they're in there learning how
[25:07.040 --> 25:11.320]  to do the crimes and it's weird, I've been on air all these years talking about the
[25:11.320 --> 25:15.520]  new world order, talking about their tricks, deciphering how their operations work, talking
[25:15.520 --> 25:19.600]  about how their multidisciplinary systems are integrated together through the Hegelian
[25:19.600 --> 25:26.240]  dialectic to control people and how folks should become aware of that and instead teaching
[25:26.240 --> 25:31.160]  people about the dark side, I've been a big recruiter for evil but you know what, that's
[25:31.160 --> 25:38.160]  in God's plan, justice be done by the heavens fall, that goes back to free will.
[25:38.160 --> 25:41.920]  It's good to give people knowledge, it's good to empower them and it's good to let them
[25:41.920 --> 25:47.960]  make the decision that are they going to use this information to empower themselves and
[25:47.960 --> 25:53.400]  others or are they going to use this to do bad things and that's why evil wants to cut
[25:53.400 --> 25:59.400]  the resources off because they want to force you into a position in a barbarous, murderous
[25:59.400 --> 26:04.720]  evil world where you've got to do bad things just to feed your family and I'm not going
[26:04.720 --> 26:08.520]  to lie to people and I didn't last year when that rant went viral and got 50 million views
[26:08.520 --> 26:17.080]  or whatever about eating my neighbors which was a modest proposal 2.0 from Jonathan Swift
[26:17.080 --> 26:23.600]  about if things really did break down the way the globalists want, you know, I probably
[26:23.600 --> 26:29.400]  would actually eat people and I think you would too, 90 plus percent of people become
[26:29.400 --> 26:34.080]  cannibals, 10 percent either get eaten or commit suicide and then the cannibals feed
[26:34.080 --> 26:35.080]  on each other.
[26:35.080 --> 26:39.280]  Now, I'm being honest with you about that.
[26:39.280 --> 26:43.840]  I don't want to be forced into that position because I would just starve to death but I
[26:43.840 --> 26:51.560]  look at my 4 year old daughter, well, she's got to eat and I don't say this to be dramatic,
[26:51.560 --> 26:55.280]  I don't say this to freak people out, this is the real world we're going into with 7
[26:55.280 --> 26:59.080]  and a half billion people and the global is turning off the world economy because if they
[26:59.080 --> 27:02.640]  get their full collapse they want it, they think they can get away with collapsing it
[27:02.640 --> 27:08.080]  and they think they can get away with posing as the saviors when they are the conductors,
[27:08.080 --> 27:12.280]  when they are the masters, when they are the engineers of this, they will take it all the
[27:12.280 --> 27:17.000]  way.
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.280]  And that's why you see the military training for 20 years to take on zombies in an apocalypse
[27:22.280 --> 27:30.160]  and the image of giant hordes of crazy evil people running around eating each other, they
[27:30.160 --> 27:34.920]  admit well it's not legal to really train the military to mow down their own citizens
[27:34.920 --> 27:40.840]  so we call it a zombie drill when the troops practice mowing down thousands of role players
[27:40.840 --> 27:44.480]  who we put green paint on their skin, they can be black, they can be white, they can
[27:44.480 --> 27:48.960]  be whatever but we dehumanize them by saying they're a zombie, putting them in some rags
[27:48.960 --> 27:52.800]  and having them go ahhh and what do zombies want?
[27:52.800 --> 28:00.800]  What they don't have, brains and it's the allegory if you had brains you wouldn't be
[28:00.800 --> 28:06.840]  in the position of being a zombie so they turn you into a TV head zombie first, then
[28:06.840 --> 28:10.440]  they dumb you down, then they slowly turn the resources off and train you to turn against
[28:10.440 --> 28:15.200]  other people, they turn off the police, they turn off the power, they say you got to eat
[28:15.200 --> 28:20.520]  bugs, they introduce this dystopia thing to your mind knowing that a wake person would
[28:20.520 --> 28:26.320]  see that go man Claus lobs evil but a zombie hears it and will later like who told them

[33:26.600 --> 33:33.200]  we are doing together that is the crew myself the wonderful audience of activist viewers
[33:33.200 --> 33:41.240]  and listeners we are changing the world together right now i cannot tell you the phone calls
[33:41.240 --> 33:47.640]  and text messages i get hourly but but but daily from different very prominent people
[33:47.640 --> 33:54.520]  in fact the most prominent now contacting info wars and saying my gosh your analysis
[33:54.520 --> 33:58.200]  was dead on i thought you were exaggerating i thought you were crazy it's exactly as you
[33:58.200 --> 34:04.520]  said how do you know this and then i spend hours a day some days usually 30 minutes
[34:04.520 --> 34:10.040]  sending prominent people links to what i've already told them because they're asking how
[34:10.040 --> 34:15.640]  did you know this how did you know that and so listeners we've got a chance to get out
[34:15.640 --> 34:20.760]  of this we've got a chance to lessen how bad this is going to be and save civilization
[34:20.760 --> 34:26.040]  but only admitting how much danger we're in will allow that to happen this is a monday
[34:26.040 --> 34:33.400]  emergency broadcast democrats announced plan to put unvaxxed internment camps as deep state
[34:33.400 --> 34:43.080]  declares america is officially in a civil war i just got chills well 12 states now have
[34:43.080 --> 34:51.960]  legislation introduced set to pass in several just like australia but worse australia is
[34:51.960 --> 34:59.960]  finally getting there but the legislation in places like washington and new york says
[34:59.960 --> 35:06.040]  you can be taken for not being injected not just if you quote have cobit and you can be
[35:06.040 --> 35:14.600]  kept in the facilities for punishment and now what do you see happening in australia
[35:14.600 --> 35:19.640]  they're now keeping people because quote they made a phone call or they walked outside the
[35:19.640 --> 35:24.360]  line they don't let you step off your front porch in these camps hell the ones in hong
[35:24.360 --> 35:29.960]  kong you can't even go out on a porch and if you step across the line up 14 more days
[35:29.960 --> 35:33.320]  there are some people in australia have been in there three months again they're just
[35:33.320 --> 35:40.600]  segwaying into these being reeducation camps they are reeducation camps and the washington
[35:40.600 --> 35:46.280]  post they just showed the headline is like ooh the walls are closing on the anti vaxxers
[35:46.840 --> 35:49.880]  forced inoculation starts next month in europe
[35:53.400 --> 35:57.960]  this is how they play society off against each other so i've got that stack
[35:57.960 --> 36:03.720]  i've got the breakdown of civilization and the infrastructure stack
[36:06.040 --> 36:13.160]  i've got really something that i had nightmares about last night
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.720]  and the reason i had i mean i had bad dreams about this last night
[36:21.080 --> 36:24.760]  is because i know i've got to do something it was one thing a year and a half ago when this
[36:24.760 --> 36:29.000]  was going on we learned about it and we called for the arrest of kwamo and governor wolf and
[36:29.000 --> 36:34.840]  whitmer and the rest of them but now they're announcing it again they've signed executive
[36:34.840 --> 36:43.480]  orders to send covid patients into nursing homes and then even though this delta variant
[36:43.480 --> 36:50.600]  isn't going to kill anybody when you test positive they intubate you to get the $53,000 bounty that
[36:50.600 --> 36:57.560]  congress re-upped and they kill you and the nurses follow the orders to intubate or they lose their
[36:57.560 --> 37:02.600]  job and they already kicked out the ones that spoke out and wouldn't take the shots so now they've
[37:02.600 --> 37:08.280]  got people including national guard in the facilities and they're already announcing
[37:08.280 --> 37:12.200]  we're not going to let your families in again people that are healthy you can't come see your
[37:12.200 --> 37:17.240]  family but if you've got it we're going to put you in the hospital in the nursing home because
[37:17.240 --> 37:22.680]  everybody's sick around you and kill you the same model they ran in idly because they wanted to get
[37:22.680 --> 37:26.600]  rid of that one of the oldest populations in the world lives in idly because they families live
[37:26.600 --> 37:31.640]  together they get pretty you know healthy and but they you know live up to like their mid 80s and
[37:31.640 --> 37:38.280]  so they're mid 70s like in the us but man if once you get tested positive they intubate you it's the
[37:38.280 --> 37:46.760]  equivalent of a guillotine they murder you with the ventilator and i have nightmares where i can't
[37:46.760 --> 37:50.520]  save people i'm sure a lot of you have those things on nightmares where it's frustrating
[37:50.520 --> 37:56.360]  and no one will listen and no one cares and in my nightmares last night i was literally in front
[37:56.360 --> 38:00.680]  of hospitals and nursing homes bullhorning and the police were laughing at me
[38:03.560 --> 38:08.680]  and taking me to jail because i wasn't wearing a mask and that was my brain war gaming this
[38:08.680 --> 38:12.440]  because i told myself driving home last night i said no matter how many troubles i've got now
[38:12.440 --> 38:17.240]  i'm holding down the fort i've got to get on an airplane to start the chain reaction i got to go
[38:17.240 --> 38:22.360]  to connecticut i got to go to new york i got to go to these places and i've got to get my listeners
[38:22.360 --> 38:29.480]  out to at least go protest at the nursing homes where they're murdering people i mean you understand
[38:29.480 --> 38:36.680]  that the globalists are doing satanic rituals and they know they can kill the unborn god's
[38:36.680 --> 38:42.680]  going to lift the hedge of protection and they know if they can kill old people out in the open
[38:44.120 --> 38:49.800]  and not let their families in when they're healthy so they can innovate them and murder
[38:49.800 --> 38:54.360]  them and not have any trouble and they've got the national guard with the military involved all of
[38:54.360 --> 39:00.040]  it is martial law all of it's a preparation for this accelerating and getting worse with the
[39:00.040 --> 39:12.600]  legislation pending in 12 blue states to take whole families to facilities and quote separate
[39:12.600 --> 39:18.280]  the children the same thing that you in 20 months ago called for that's the holy grail the type of
[39:18.280 --> 39:22.440]  personnel they hire a lot of them pedophiles you think well the average cop won't be part of this
[39:22.440 --> 39:27.800]  exactly in the new york and washington legislation i'm told it's similar in the other 10 states
[39:27.800 --> 39:31.720]  i read this on air yesterday we got articles on info wars dot com i'll give you the bill number
[39:33.640 --> 39:37.720]  john down the report on two last night he blows up the bill and shows you the subsections
[39:37.720 --> 39:43.960]  it says anyone not that the sheriff deputizes he's elected and that's in the constitution that even
[39:43.960 --> 39:48.680]  goes back to england more than 600 years with sheriffs but that's when they got codified
[39:48.680 --> 39:52.840]  really about a thousand years old and goes back to magna carta
[39:52.840 --> 40:01.880]  no no it says the health department will deputize anyone they want as law enforcement power
[40:02.600 --> 40:06.760]  so when you hear obama talk about we want a domestic security force just as big just as
[40:06.760 --> 40:11.560]  strong as our military and he's right he's in his third term right now obama is that's what the
[40:11.560 --> 40:16.360]  by administration is literally that's why i usually refer to biden as obama that's not a
[40:16.360 --> 40:24.040]  a joke i mean i i just tell the truth my brain like don't call him biden that's at obama so
[40:24.040 --> 40:30.520]  my brain will make me mess up and it's truly a Freudian slip because it is obama these are
[40:30.520 --> 40:39.800]  ghouls these are psychic vampires folks and this is the final step and it's so sick ladies and
[40:39.800 --> 40:46.360]  gentlemen we've got new jeffrey epstein bill gates pedophilia knows that ties into atlantic monthly
[40:46.360 --> 40:51.960]  and is just devastating and when you think about it like why are they into this why rich women
[40:51.960 --> 40:57.880]  rich men because it's about not caring about other people and about the selfishness and the
[40:57.880 --> 41:03.000]  energy that they have in them the spirit they have in them wants to hurt innocent people
[41:04.840 --> 41:09.720]  that's why they get giddy and gate starts rubbing his hands together and looking like he's having
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.600]  a a orgasm seriously he looks oh oh oh when he talks about and we're going to give it to newborns
[41:14.600 --> 41:18.920]  and we're going to give him five six shots and and uh-huh society will never go back to normal
[41:18.920 --> 41:25.000]  pharynx arcaria says to him and gage goes oh it starts looking like he's literally having an
[41:25.000 --> 41:32.840]  orgasm because he's having a satanic orgasm he's doing the lesser magic when he announces we're
[41:32.840 --> 41:36.840]  going to get your kids when he announces it's never going to stop when he announces that there's
[41:36.840 --> 41:41.080]  going to be dozens of shots a year as he did 20 months ago and we told you this is what's coming
[41:42.200 --> 41:47.320]  people ask jones how'd you know what was coming because he freaking runs it he said it and he
[41:47.320 --> 41:50.280]  he starts talking about how he's going to kill your kids he starts talking about how does he
[41:50.280 --> 41:55.160]  populate you at ted talks he's talking about death panels to kill grandma and he starts giggling
[41:55.160 --> 42:00.680]  and rubbing his hands together and and and gyrating his hips forward and backwards in a sexual
[42:00.680 --> 42:09.400]  uh event he gets off on killing people there's people like that in the world folks and he controls
[42:09.400 --> 42:17.480]  trillions he wants to kill you he ran jeffrey eppstein and sex rings to compromise scientists
[42:17.480 --> 42:21.880]  and take over the major universities he runs almost every health department in the world
[42:22.440 --> 42:29.000]  national and local how did he do it running a giant intelligence operation through scientists
[42:29.000 --> 42:36.760]  and hundreds of billions in payoffs he is a psychotic killer when we come back i have all the
[42:36.760 --> 42:43.720]  documents i have all the news of how the vaccines aren't vaccines are causing record death worldwide
[42:43.720 --> 42:49.640]  from a british government report and a u.s government report that are official the total
[42:49.640 --> 42:54.360]  proof ladies and gentlemen the mass murder is happening now and now they're coming to the
[42:54.360 --> 43:02.440]  nursing homes to murder more people with enjoyment everything we've witnessed in the last few decades
[43:02.440 --> 43:08.600]  has only been the build-up for what the globalists are doing right now this is their big offensive
[43:08.600 --> 43:12.760]  this is their takeover and this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now
[43:12.760 --> 43:16.760]  they've revealed themselves now their world government their permanent martial law their
[43:16.760 --> 43:22.920]  medical tyranny is out in the open their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using their
[43:22.920 --> 43:27.800]  corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth
[43:27.800 --> 43:32.200]  so listen paul reveres when you spread the word about the broadcast when you pray for the broadcast
[43:32.200 --> 43:36.360]  you're the tip of the spear and when you buy products at info war store dot com you keep us

[44:03.640 --> 44:08.440]  granny do right granny do right thanks for holding her on the air go ahead challenge first of all let
[44:08.440 --> 44:14.680]  me say i love your products i am a granny and um for all the senior citizens out there that may
[44:14.680 --> 44:20.040]  have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up the sunspots or age spots as they're
[44:20.040 --> 44:25.880]  lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really
[44:25.880 --> 44:32.600]  gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already taking your other supplements
[44:32.600 --> 44:37.240]  but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do because i just thought it was a hopeless
[44:37.240 --> 44:42.840]  situation but when i started taking it i mean it doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period
[44:42.840 --> 44:48.760]  of time i started noticing okay you know this is the ticket this is working this is wonderful you
[44:48.760 --> 44:55.480]  know i don't i don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know so anyway it worked wonderfully
[44:55.480 --> 45:03.160]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin if you're ruthless mega corporations who've taken
[45:03.160 --> 45:08.200]  over almost every government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class in any form of
[45:08.200 --> 45:12.840]  upper mobility you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being targeted
[45:12.840 --> 45:19.480]  and that's why the fortune 100 have wrapped themselves the name of lb gt and african american
[45:19.480 --> 45:23.800]  rights and all the rest of it all over the world that's now their corporate face while they run
[45:23.800 --> 45:29.080]  slave camps in africa and in communist china and many other areas while they undermine our basic
[45:29.080 --> 45:35.080]  liberties here and spy on us through the big tech and the central banks and other zone so this is a
[45:35.080 --> 45:41.720]  criminal takeover and when you look at the new superclass it's the politicians it's the corporate
[45:41.720 --> 45:46.440]  media it's the police it's the bureaucrats it's members of congress and their staff and their
[45:46.440 --> 45:52.840]  families it's the white house hell it's postal workers who are all exempt from the poison shots
[45:53.480 --> 45:57.720]  but not the general public and everybody else through corporate rule so this is the true
[45:57.720 --> 46:05.480]  discrimination that's going on three very important lifesaving words vitamins minerals
[46:05.480 --> 46:13.880]  amino acids and you find them all in vitamin mineral fusion all the essential vitamins all

[47:25.080 --> 47:33.480]  ladies and gentlemen we are back now we have a very informative individual joining us for 30
[47:33.480 --> 47:38.920]  minutes in the next hour dr paul crack robert's been on the show many times over the years and
[47:38.920 --> 47:44.360]  he was appointed under reagan he was the father of reaganomics and basically ran the treasury
[47:44.360 --> 47:50.520]  department he also was part of the deal to have the collapse of the soviet union in exchange for
[47:50.520 --> 47:57.560]  nato not expanding into the former soviet union areas he was part of those negotiations he was
[47:57.560 --> 48:02.200]  part of the signatory agreements to it and he's going to be joining us to talk about what's really
[48:02.200 --> 48:07.640]  going on with russia and the moves to get us into a major war with them next hour then i'm
[48:07.640 --> 48:15.880]  intending to open the phones up and cover all of this other news but i don't know anything personal
[48:15.880 --> 48:23.080]  about bob saggett who died at age 65 was found dead in a hotel room so i called some folks that
[48:23.080 --> 48:28.120]  know him and they said well he was a party animal but so many people are dying after they get their
[48:28.120 --> 48:37.560]  vaccines who knows because he'd been bragging about how he got his booster on december 1st
[48:37.560 --> 48:43.720]  and how much he loved it and then now he's dead but what we do know is from the veirs reporting
[48:43.720 --> 48:50.760]  system and the uk reporting system heart attacks of microcarditis in people down to age five now
[48:50.760 --> 48:56.040]  they're taking the shots have exploded and that's a fact that you can't get around that and it is
[48:56.040 --> 49:04.120]  from the shots and remember a year and three months ago in october of 2020 the cdc's own
[49:04.120 --> 49:09.800]  documents on their web page now said here's a list of possible adverse reactions that our scientists
[49:09.800 --> 49:15.400]  warn and it's microcarditis and all the rest of it so we know that and now we know this is going
[49:15.400 --> 49:20.920]  on they just hope the public doesn't drill down into this information and then it just ends up
[49:20.920 --> 49:25.400]  collapsing society because so many get sick so many die so many go bankrupt and then so many get
[49:25.400 --> 49:31.000]  smart and refuse to take the shots and then everything from the fire departments to the
[49:31.000 --> 49:37.240]  hospitals to the airlines to the power plants to the engineers breaks down and that's where
[49:37.240 --> 49:45.480]  we're going the post industrial world but bob saggett dead at age 65 comedian bob saggett found
[49:45.480 --> 49:51.960]  dead at orlando hotel let's move on from the anecdotal and let's move on to this info wars
[49:51.960 --> 49:58.200]  dot com article that links directly to the british government's own report that just came out two
[49:58.200 --> 50:03.960]  days ago these are the numbers of just the deaths from covet december 6 to january 2nd
[50:03.960 --> 50:08.680]  now notice the cdc is trying to spend these numbers and hold these back but they're also
[50:08.680 --> 50:18.280]  similar here bombshell nearly 75 percent of uk covet deaths were vaxed government data shows
[50:18.280 --> 50:23.320]  and then you add in some of the other data it's over that because they don't count it a death
[50:23.320 --> 50:29.160]  just like here if you die after it being injected in the first 14 days you add that the numbers are
[50:29.160 --> 50:37.720]  well above 85 percent this is from the british government's own website with links all to it
[50:38.280 --> 50:47.160]  that's on info wars dot com here's a more detailed article out of the expose that's excellent bbc news
[50:47.160 --> 50:55.080]  forgot to tell you that official data shows the triple double vaccinated accounted for four in
[50:55.080 --> 51:01.560]  every five covet 19 deaths in december because they break all the numbers integrate them together
[51:01.560 --> 51:07.880]  it's actually above 75 as we were just explaining the latest figures published in the uk health
[51:07.880 --> 51:12.840]  security agency showed that despite the elderly and vulnerable receiving a booster shot in september
[51:12.840 --> 51:18.280]  and october the nhs turning into the national booster service ever since the triple double
[51:18.280 --> 51:23.640]  vaccine population still accounted for four in every five covet 19 deaths throughout december
[51:23.640 --> 51:26.920]  and turned to the british government had lied about the numbers of people that had taken it
[51:26.920 --> 51:33.400]  so now it's just 60 so this then proves that you are more likely to die of covet if you've been
[51:33.400 --> 51:44.200]  double or triple vaxed they forgot to tell you that isn't that just interesting oh and let me
[51:44.200 --> 51:47.560]  actually show you the report because you know mainstream news when they say something about us
[51:47.560 --> 51:52.120]  they don't really show you the report they always just lie about it oh jones said there's slave colonies
[51:52.120 --> 51:58.760]  on mars really offered a million dollars for where i said that never said that oh jones
[51:58.760 --> 52:01.720]  says he's an actor everything he says is fake oh is that why it all comes true
[52:04.600 --> 52:10.680]  no that's a lie too oh but here it is this is out of the uk health security agency covet 19
[52:10.680 --> 52:17.880]  vaccine surveillance report and this is just for the last month and as i told you it was released
[52:17.880 --> 52:25.320]  on january 7th so three days ago and it's december through january or early january
[52:25.320 --> 52:29.400]  and there is the report if you'd like to go read the whole thing for you it's again linked
[52:29.400 --> 52:34.920]  on info wars dot com you can see this all for yourself but that's why they try to block us
[52:34.920 --> 52:41.000]  everywhere because we actually show you the truth this is from veirs reporting by the democrats
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.160]  have introduced bills to get rid of the veirs reporting can't have doctors and nurses report
[52:45.160 --> 52:51.480]  things this is microcarditis swelling in the bag around the heart reported in veirs by year total
[52:51.480 --> 52:59.160]  and look basically doesn't exist in all the years previous until now off the charts literally
[52:59.800 --> 53:04.440]  hundreds of thousands of reports and of course you know only a fraction get reported most people
[53:04.440 --> 53:08.520]  are undiagnosed until you die microcarditis you can read all about that from the mayo clinic
[53:08.520 --> 53:15.880]  and then here is that british report worldwide oh yeah this is the really big one excuse me oh wow
[53:17.080 --> 53:23.800]  this is a world report i just showed you the british report massive 145 country studies show
[53:23.800 --> 53:30.040]  sharp increase of transmission and death after introduction of covet vaccines the gateway pundit
[53:30.040 --> 53:36.520]  did a splendid job we've actually linked to the report in the live show feed headline you can go
[53:36.520 --> 53:42.840]  below the live show feed and find the link to the worldwide casual impact analysis of vaccine
[53:42.840 --> 53:50.920]  administration on deaths and cases associated with covet 19 a big data analysis of 145 countries
[53:50.920 --> 53:56.440]  this is done by the department of political science university of alberta canada by prestigious
[53:56.440 --> 54:03.560]  statisticians working with supercomputers you can go read how they did it oh boy it's incredible
[54:03.560 --> 54:08.520]  and by the way we can show you the john hopkins that picks up the un data worldwide you know that
[54:08.520 --> 54:12.680]  graph you guys always show that shows double vax and first facts and triple vax points where it
[54:12.680 --> 54:17.560]  starts and everywhere the shot starts the illness is the hospitalization began that's why we've got
[54:17.560 --> 54:20.840]  double the deaths this year we had last year and actual hospitals actually full
[54:22.920 --> 54:27.480]  yep there you go oh you already got your first shot oh now your second oh is it that nice at the
[54:27.480 --> 54:33.160]  exact injection point explosions and hospitalizations illnesses and deaths and this is over a hundred
[54:33.160 --> 54:37.640]  countries in this list that you're seeing on tv but anyway let's just go back to this one real quick
[54:37.640 --> 54:43.320]  it's got all the same numbers here for you all all the same numbers here from around the world
[54:43.320 --> 54:48.280]  showing the exact same thing same thing same thing same thing take the shot and die take the shot
[54:48.280 --> 54:53.720]  and die take the shot and die take the shot and die take the shot and die oh and the places the
[54:53.720 --> 55:00.760]  more injected the higher the death rate like israel and uh singapore and oh my goodness oh my goodness
[55:00.760 --> 55:06.760]  gracious it's all here for you it's all right there country by country their own official numbers
[55:08.600 --> 55:12.920]  just like the gauge in your car says you're out of gas and jimmy crickets suddenly just run out of
[55:12.920 --> 55:18.600]  gas isn't that funny there's all these people going along the system that think they can just
[55:18.600 --> 55:25.720]  pretend everything's okay and it'll be fine this is out of ctv canada vaccinated hospital patients
[55:25.720 --> 55:32.280]  outpace the unvaccinated but it doesn't mean the shots don't work oh no it says it lessens the illness
[55:32.280 --> 55:37.240]  which is true according to canada's numbers it increases the level of death
[55:40.600 --> 55:45.640]  let's see it doesn't matter because they're liberal and they are corporate media and you've
[55:45.640 --> 55:52.760]  got to listen to them or you are a bad person so we just showed you the ver's documents the
[55:52.760 --> 55:59.880]  british government documents the canadian analysis the mayo clinic we just showed you all that that's
[55:59.880 --> 56:07.560]  what we do all day long is the real world oh and as you can see i've got camps for you here i've
[56:07.560 --> 56:12.760]  got revolution they say well this cia said two weeks ago that we're in a civil war and i said
[56:12.760 --> 56:17.880]  watch within two weeks all the parent media throw these two weeks behind the cia will say we're in
[56:17.880 --> 56:22.920]  a civil war and the answer is i'm not kidding now have leftist and speeches across the nation
[56:22.920 --> 56:28.600]  round up and kill all trump supporters yep there's an article in four wars dot com about that and
[56:28.600 --> 56:35.560]  it's just terrible just terrible that we have a thing called the second amendment to protect
[56:35.560 --> 56:40.280]  ourselves defensively from you monsters that are spoiling for a war but they're like oh yeah
[56:40.840 --> 56:47.000]  we got the power plants we got the borders we got the justice department and we're turning it all
[56:47.000 --> 56:53.880]  off so we can't beat you in a fight but we're gonna put you under siege

[1:00:16.840 --> 1:00:22.040]  by the amazing folks at the babelon b here are two of those funny reports we'll be right back with
[1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:30.520]  dr paul craig robert's today marks the one-year anniversary of the deadly january sixth capital
[1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:36.600]  insurrection where violent trump supporters vish murdered zeros of people and almost aoc
[1:00:37.320 --> 1:00:41.800]  i'm reporting in washington at the annual reunion of those most intimately involved with upon
[1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:49.160]  execution of the attack fbi agents so what's it like to be back uh if i was indeed present at the
[1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:54.120]  initial attack which i'm not saying i was uh it's good to be back what precisely was your
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:59.800]  involvement last year i may have allegedly moved a barrier which i didn't but if i did i i then
[1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:05.000]  said let's storm the capital along with my colleague steve who i'm hypothetically happy to see again
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:12.680]  allegedly right so what lessons can we take from the january six events they showed us how incredibly
[1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:18.120]  violent trump supporters are in our fevered imaginations when i was allegedly pretending
[1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:22.840]  to be a trump supporter it was very very scary it was telling i imagine that they were filled
[1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:28.760]  with hatred and racism as they walked calmly through the capital taking selfies so what do
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:34.360]  you have planned for this reunion oh we're gonna throw frisbee maybe barbeque some cheney who knows
[1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:41.800]  maybe we'll get a few pbrs in us and uh go kidnap a governor uh as we may have done allegedly in the
[1:01:41.800 --> 1:01:53.000]  past is there anyone at this reunion who's not an fbi agent um there's jake jake standing here with
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:59.880]  trump supporter jake who is present at the capital riot jake why did you decide to violently riot
[1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:05.000]  well we were taking our orders directly from president trump who is still the president
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:10.680]  when trump said that we should protest peacefully what i heard was murder kill and destroy and when
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:15.480]  he said that we needed to show strength i understood that to mean of course that we needed to go
[1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:20.600]  steal a podium and then leave a poop on ancy polosi's desk wait you did all that and they
[1:02:20.600 --> 1:02:25.400]  didn't arrest you oh i got arrested i spent some time in jail uh but then i lied and said that i
[1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:30.360]  just burned down a car lot and stole some nikes in the name of racial justice and then they let me
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:35.160]  out uh on parole you know you know common Harris in fact even uh even raised some money to let me
[1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:41.160]  out so so so generous yeah very clever well there you have it if you'd like to see more january
[1:02:41.160 --> 1:02:46.280]  sixth coverage be sure to switch over to cnn where they will be covering it continuously forever
[1:02:46.280 --> 1:02:52.040]  until the end of time coming up next we go live to the somber ceremony in which alexandria
[1:02:52.040 --> 1:03:03.720]  acacia cortez lays a wreath at her own grave noa who was he what did he do i mean he saved all of
[1:03:03.720 --> 1:03:09.080]  humanity because he trusted in god and all that but he did make a few errors in the animals he
[1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:14.920]  chose to save so i've taken the task upon myself to list the top animals noa should have pushed
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:25.160]  off the boat first off geese i'm starting with the obvious one geese next tarantula hogs these
[1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:31.000]  guys will paralyze a tarantula drag it back to their evil lair lay an egg on it drill a hole
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:37.160]  inside the spider and then have their larva eat the inside of the tarantula for weeks on end
[1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:46.120]  while the spider is still alive on second thought i can respect that the tarantula huck can stay
[1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:52.600]  then we have pomeranians no good pomeranians going around yipping and thinking they're better than
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:04:00.200]  everyone cats all of them this one's a no-brainer though satan would have probably kept them alive
[1:04:00.200 --> 1:04:08.440]  anyway bats this whole pandemic could have been prevented come on noa insane clown posse fans
[1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:14.440]  the world would be a whole lot brighter of a place then we have the skinny cows that produce
[1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:23.000]  skim milk what is the point of these guys anyway joe biden if noa had just tossed biden off the
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:30.200]  boat we wouldn't be in this predicament elephants the future symbol of the republican party full

[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:23.320]  well we have a very interesting and informative individual on with us i'm going to go over all
[1:06:23.320 --> 1:06:28.440]  of his bio that he was once listed by forbes media guide as in the top seven journalists in
[1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:34.200]  the united states paul craig roberts is of course with paul craig roberts dot o r g he was also one
[1:06:34.200 --> 1:06:38.920]  of the editors over at the wall street journal an editor for the wall street journal columnist for
[1:06:38.920 --> 1:06:43.800]  business week script sourd new service he was a nationally syndicated columnist for creators
[1:06:43.800 --> 1:06:48.200]  syndicate in 1992 he received the warren brooks award for excellence in journalism but the big
[1:06:48.200 --> 1:06:54.600]  thing he did uh was the head of policy on the economy for ronald reagan the father of reaganomics
[1:06:54.600 --> 1:07:01.160]  and he was appointed as the secretary of the treasury for economic policy the assistant
[1:07:01.160 --> 1:07:05.480]  secretary of treasury economic policy and he joins us really to cover the waterfront
[1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:11.480]  here today because he's really talked about what happened at the end of the cold war and the deal
[1:07:11.480 --> 1:07:16.360]  that was made back then a deal that was on the news at the time a deal that uh there were even a
[1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:21.960]  lot of agreements made about the end of the cold war the end of the soviet union but russia uh
[1:07:21.960 --> 1:07:27.320]  wouldn't expand into nato nato wouldn't expand into areas formerly controlled by russia and now i
[1:07:27.320 --> 1:07:32.600]  see new york times article saying that is not the case that that is not going on and that ukraine
[1:07:32.600 --> 1:07:38.680]  doesn't even have any russian history or anything even though russia was basically founded uh was
[1:07:38.680 --> 1:07:43.240]  it almost a thousand years ago by an individual that was actually living in ukraine and i've got
[1:07:43.240 --> 1:07:47.480]  some of the articles even from the new york times previously admitting that and so you've
[1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:53.080]  got all these geopolitical movements what does it mean what is the Nord Stream 2 gas line mean
[1:07:54.200 --> 1:07:58.840]  being blocked right now what's happening with the russian little green men as they're called
[1:07:58.840 --> 1:08:04.840]  inside eastern ukraine where is all this brinkmanship going and then he also
[1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:14.360]  wants to get into the question of can america be saved does america have a future these are
[1:08:14.360 --> 1:08:19.320]  some of the articles at paul craig roberts website and dr roberts great to have you back it's been
[1:08:19.320 --> 1:08:25.880]  a few years thank you ellis i'm glad to be back with you thanks for coming on well what a crazy
[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:34.920]  world where do you want to start wherever you do well we could start with inflation and the economy
[1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:40.920]  we could start with the insanity of the deep state we could start with the russia situation
[1:08:40.920 --> 1:08:48.360]  wherever you like to well uh you know the russian situation could turn out to be a very serious one
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:54.520]  and as far as i can tell most people are unaware maybe we should start with that
[1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:59.880]  that's exactly where i wanted to start for people that don't know the history of it or
[1:08:59.880 --> 1:09:10.040]  what's really going on what's actually happening well i think what's actually happening is that
[1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:20.520]  the russians of the kremlin have concluded that washington is not going to pay any attention
[1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:31.480]  to the russian security concern and therefore they're going through the motions of testing one
[1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:43.960]  last time if we will respond to their diplomatic efforts and get our threatening military forces
[1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:53.720]  off of their boards i don't think that they believe that we are going to respond in any positive way
[1:09:53.720 --> 1:10:02.360]  but they just want to check their own decision one last time before they get tough with us
[1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:12.760]  or whoever happens is to be the target so i haven't any belief that the negotiations as they're called
[1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:23.480]  by washington will be in any way successful they will simply convince the kremlin that the united
[1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:35.320]  states has fund its nose at them one more time and will not accommodate the russian security concerns
[1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:48.040]  so what will they do i think they have reached a conclusion that until the kremlin demonstrates
[1:10:49.080 --> 1:11:00.600]  force the west won't take them seriously so i expect they will simply eliminate the military
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:08.760]  bases that we have constructed in ukraine in the way that the israelis do to threatening
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:17.800]  installments in iraq and syria and lebanon the russians are quite aware that if the israelis
[1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:30.280]  can do this so can the russians so i suspect that we'll end up with a black eye and at that point
[1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:38.440]  we might listen again to their security concerns now what are these concerns well
[1:11:41.800 --> 1:11:52.760]  the agreement was made with the soviet union with govachov that if the soviets allowed the
[1:11:52.760 --> 1:12:04.280]  reunification of germany the um that washington would not take the advantage and move the nato
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:13.400]  all the way to the russian border we were supposed not to put into nato the eastern european
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:21.240]  communist countries that were part of the soviet empire so govachov is going to let loose of all
[1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:29.480]  of this and we were not going to immediately sign them up or even at any time in the future
[1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:36.360]  sign them up in nato and have our military installations on their borders well this
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:47.160]  agreement held during the george herbert walker push administration but later in the clinton years
[1:12:47.160 --> 1:12:56.280]  um clinton dishonored the word of the united states government and signed up former
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:13:06.840]  soviet provinces in to nato i think the reason they did that was that the soviet union collapsed
[1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:18.840]  after the agreement that was made with govachov and so the washington was not confronted with
[1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:27.080]  the same kind of soviet power russia was in chaos and they decided and washington decided to take
[1:13:27.080 --> 1:13:41.560]  advantage of that and did and it stayed like that alex until 2007 when putin at the munich
[1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:51.000]  security conference announced that the russians did not accept the american unipolar world and that
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:14:01.240]  um the russians did not approve of the indiscriminate and irresponsible use of force by the united
[1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:12.840]  states against other countries and united states got very thorough tongue lashing for its behavior
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:19.800]  and violation of international law and putin says you know we have to get it along and i
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:27.320]  split international international laws for so that we all work things out and get along together
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:33.480]  and since then doc they they watched the us destabilize and destroy libya destabilize and
[1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:39.000]  try to destroy syria and they said okay we're done especially now as they move right up against the
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:44.760]  russian border including with nuclear weapons how would we like it if russia started taking over part
[1:14:44.760 --> 1:14:51.080]  of mexico and moving troops up to our border i would tell you i wouldn't like that one bit well
[1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:59.160]  we may find out soon enough um you're right i'm perhaps going on in too much length of no no
[1:14:59.160 --> 1:15:02.920]  it's all very interesting and we're just going to break in about about a minute i mean i you've
[1:15:02.920 --> 1:15:07.000]  laid this out you've warned this was coming on i mean 15 years ago on the show you said this
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:11.320]  was going to be happening we're now to the point you've been warning about the whole time and i
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:17.720]  really want you to give us your expert take on how you think this could unfold okay well again and
[1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:27.640]  we saw in 2014 when obama thought he was going to invade syria the russians stepped in and
[1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:35.480]  prevented it and defeated the mercenaries that we had sent dead over through a sod and then a few
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:43.080]  years ago he announced the array of new russian super weapons he announced their their hypersonic
[1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:47.080]  this is riveting and you're a real historian because not just an economist you were there
[1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:50.680]  in the government when this was all going on and then as a journalist covering it
[1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:54.280]  and and you've been dead on predicting all of this and this is the big issue we'll be right back
[1:15:57.320 --> 1:16:01.400]  everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup
[1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:06.840]  up for what the globalists are doing right now this is their big offensive this is their
[1:16:06.840 --> 1:16:11.080]  takeover and this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed
[1:16:11.080 --> 1:16:15.400]  themselves now their world government their permanent martial law their medical tyranny
[1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:21.000]  is out in the open their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using their corporate

[1:20:03.080 --> 1:20:15.000]  world order it's alex jones
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:18.760]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts former chief advisor on the economy and Ronald Reagan
[1:20:18.760 --> 1:20:23.720]  from Wall Street Journal editor author columnist is here with us and he was also part of the deals
[1:20:23.720 --> 1:20:29.080]  to get the Soviet Union to basically withdraw itself from areas of eastern Europe as long as
[1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:34.120]  that was left as a buffer that's historical fact we've covered it in osium but now i've got new
[1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:37.640]  york times article saying it doesn't exist and here's one that goes even further because he's
[1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:41.080]  the one saying am i going on too long with history no i don't think he is i was just
[1:20:41.080 --> 1:20:45.080]  bringing this up to current date but let's go back for a moment and go back to where he left off
[1:20:46.040 --> 1:20:53.080]  russia-ukrain conflict lies in the bones of an 11th century prince this was on january 1st just
[1:20:53.080 --> 1:21:01.960]  last week and they go on to say no russia really doesn't have a claim to ukraine yes this yarlasov
[1:21:01.960 --> 1:21:07.800]  the wise almost a thousand years ago did basically found the modern ukrainian and russian culture
[1:21:07.800 --> 1:21:13.000]  and their common law and all their systems but that doesn't really matter ukraine belongs to europe
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:18.600]  well yes ukraine has some european roots also some russian roots doesn't matter russia was basically
[1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:25.160]  founded and the russians know this in eastern ukraine that's in history books so the idea that
[1:21:25.160 --> 1:21:29.640]  they have no claim to that and that nato troops can be coming in and all these heavy weapons
[1:21:29.640 --> 1:21:35.320]  could be given to them including by trump is an act of war i'm not a russophile but i don't want
[1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:39.400]  war with russia i don't want to start a war with russia it's just insane so i think that's some of
[1:21:39.400 --> 1:21:44.760]  the background history there but you got up the point of now russia said no in syria they've shown
[1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:49.000]  what they're going to do and i think what you're saying is you're predicting that if push comes
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:53.480]  to shove the russians aren't going to back down is that what you're saying doctor uh of course
[1:21:53.480 --> 1:22:01.640]  they're not going to they've made that clear um and you're right ukraine has been part of russia
[1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:09.640]  for longer than the than the united states has existed um so but it's not a question of a russian
[1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:16.920]  claim to ukraine russia is not making a claim to ukraine what they're saying is we're not going to
[1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:25.800]  allow you to turn ukraine into another hostile country armed by the americans with nato bases
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:33.000]  on our border we're not going to allow that in fact we really aren't going to tolerate your bases
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:41.640]  in poland and romania and uh so you're too close to our doorstep and you need to pack up and go home
[1:22:42.440 --> 1:22:51.480]  and um they're not asking us to do this they're telling us and they're telling us that um or
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:56.200]  telling washington doesn't have anything to do with me and you're not telling washington if you
[1:22:56.200 --> 1:23:04.680]  don't do that we're going to throw you out and they made it and they're certainly capable of doing it
[1:23:05.640 --> 1:23:18.760]  so um i think uh the fact that uh blinkin and the nato functionary and and the biden and so much of
[1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:28.520]  the indian uh prostitute media they have already dismissed any sort of accommodation with the
[1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:38.040]  russian security um concerns and so the russians see that and so they don't expect any diplomatic
[1:23:38.040 --> 1:23:44.440]  success so and they also got snuck attacked by hitler and operation barbara rosa and lost 20
[1:23:44.440 --> 1:23:49.640]  million people over three and a half years so it's recent in their racial memory of being snuck
[1:23:49.640 --> 1:23:54.440]  attack and and and killed and and the russians talk about that they talk about that a lot and then
[1:23:54.440 --> 1:24:00.680]  we have us senators in both parties threatening first strike sneak attacks with nuclear weapons
[1:24:00.680 --> 1:24:05.400]  against russia that is so damn dangerous would you like to explain to people in international
[1:24:05.400 --> 1:24:10.200]  military parlance what that means because from my lay understanding dr roberts when you say i may
[1:24:10.200 --> 1:24:15.240]  attack you first with nuclear weapons you've opened up them being able to attack us now
[1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:21.640]  because we just threaten to attack them and this is very dangerous yes you're completely right um
[1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:31.320]  i think the the effect is um that the russians have concluded that the whole purpose of us
[1:24:31.320 --> 1:24:39.320]  ringing them with bases and making the threats is to destroy their sovereignty to make them compliant
[1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:45.720]  with american hegemony and they've already said some many years ago that they were not going to
[1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:56.120]  accept that and they have tried with diplomatic efforts along the way to make us consider the
[1:24:56.120 --> 1:25:02.040]  situation from their standpoint it's like you said how happy would we be with russian bases
[1:25:02.040 --> 1:25:07.880]  only on the mexican border the canadian border that we wouldn't be we would be uneasy about it
[1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:13.320]  and they they're uneasy and we make them more uneasy with all these threats about nuclear
[1:25:13.320 --> 1:25:19.160]  attacks on them and so forth and with constant accusations i mean the constant accusations
[1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:28.200]  against russia so they're going to bring that to an end i can't tell you who they'll strike first
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:37.640]  most likely it will be the american bases that have been built in ukraine and the effect of it
[1:25:37.640 --> 1:25:44.520]  of course uh washington will immediately say cc we told you the russians are aggressive their threat
[1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:51.640]  they've done this and that and the other and washington will try to use it to solidify its hold
[1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:59.800]  on europe through nato on the other hand the europeans may see hey look um the russians have
[1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:08.440]  had enough uh and the americans can't do anything about it and but we are exposed we don't want to
[1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:15.560]  be exposed to this conflict and perhaps then the europeans start leaning on us look you know
[1:26:15.560 --> 1:26:21.640]  the russians have a point of view after all uh why you own their borders they're not doing anything
[1:26:21.640 --> 1:26:30.680]  except in response to the pressures you put on them so i think that's sort of the attitude in the
[1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:39.560]  kremlin it may work out that the way you get accommodated is you show that you have the
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:45.800]  force to enforce it well let me ask you this historical question i follow some of the foreign
[1:26:45.800 --> 1:26:51.960]  news i follow japanese i mean i follow russia i follow it all and the the the russian news
[1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:56.920]  is pissed at putin that he's not doing more and even an international poll something like 90 percent
[1:26:56.920 --> 1:27:01.240]  of russians know what's happening so the west wanted to weaken putin it's not weakening
[1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:06.120]  him the way they think they're actually the russians are getting mad that he is allowing
[1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:10.360]  this to even go on from what i've seen so far from him losing support it's actually the opposite
[1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:17.400]  the russians are getting pissed off yes that's true they've they've had enough they've had this
[1:27:17.400 --> 1:27:25.960]  film of the arrogant disrespectful treatment they have received not just from washington but from
[1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:33.480]  these these european punks the stolen bird he's just a flunky giving orders to russia and it's
[1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:39.880]  it's so funny and i think the russians have had enough they've been putting up with it now for
[1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:47.880]  two decades they're they're tired of it they're not going to take it anymore and they're not
[1:27:47.880 --> 1:27:57.080]  going to take anymore the prospect of our bases on their border it's just not going to be accepted
[1:27:57.720 --> 1:28:06.840]  and so as we have shown we're going to ignore them they're going to throw us out it's going to be
[1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:11.960]  that simple doc we got to go to break i want to come back and just finish up on where you see
[1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:17.240]  this going briefly that i want to shift gears to america and the mess that is here january 6th
[1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:20.920]  you've been critical of these so-called vaccines as well so i'm going to cover the waterfront with
[1:28:20.920 --> 1:28:27.080]  dr paul kreg roberts straight ahead you can find his books with more of his writings at paul kreg
[1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:30.440]  roberts dot org and i he says i'll do the whole hour we'll do the whole hour for them because i've
[1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:36.120]  got all these other subjects he he can get into as well that are so incredibly important but i think
[1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:41.720]  the way he puts it here really boils it on down uh that you know do the russians understand
[1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:46.680]  how insane the people are that run our country in fact we'll talk about the mindset of this
[1:28:46.680 --> 1:28:53.880]  neocon left this movement uh with dr roberts straight ahead

[1:31:01.320 --> 1:31:06.120]  hello alex yes malcolm all right i will make this quick and real short where the other patreons can
[1:31:06.120 --> 1:31:11.480]  get on the line uh alex i have to promote one thing from one of your co-host oan shroyer
[1:31:11.480 --> 1:31:17.320]  supermail volatility and brain force plus mix those two together you're an unstoppable tank
[1:31:17.320 --> 1:31:22.760]  supermail volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have
[1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:29.000]  never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also
[1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:33.800]  work quite well but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact
[1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:38.040]  each batch is different sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like why are you
[1:31:38.040 --> 1:31:41.880]  selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong that's just how it is it's how it
[1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:48.120]  works uh so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like super strong but yeah if you want the
[1:31:48.120 --> 1:31:54.600]  rolls royce at a decent price then this is it
[1:31:58.520 --> 1:32:03.320]  i have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart deep in my soul i've ever had in my
[1:32:03.880 --> 1:32:12.280]  47 years on this planet i've had a lot of loss like everybody else has and it's because it's a loss
[1:32:12.280 --> 1:32:20.760]  of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for
[1:32:22.120 --> 1:32:28.840]  and now we're just throwing it all away and i see the general public ena medically induced
[1:32:28.840 --> 1:32:36.200]  scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled tranchi and i know we're being fed
[1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:42.840]  into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth
[1:32:42.840 --> 1:32:48.360]  and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating collapsing and then coming back to
[1:32:48.360 --> 1:32:53.880]  life again it's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of
[1:32:53.880 --> 1:33:00.840]  decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it leading a frontal assault on the
[1:33:00.840 --> 1:33:19.640]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[1:33:19.640 --> 1:33:30.360]  order it's alex jones and dr paul craig roberts is with us he's been coming on the show 16 17 years
[1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:33.960]  and boy what he talked about way back then the coming conflict with russia
[1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:40.360]  is now here and so he's with us till the end of the hour next hour to open the phones up
[1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:47.080]  and take your phone calls on a host of issues but to dr roberts you wrote an article that i see was
[1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:53.240]  out yesterday does russia understand she is dealing with lunatics and that's what i see out of the
[1:33:53.240 --> 1:33:59.560]  west ruling class is just people that want power period and and and want to tear down society and
[1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:05.320]  we see all these statements about collapsing civilization by claus schwaab to save the earth
[1:34:05.320 --> 1:34:10.840]  don't they get a giant nuclear war will probably kill the life on earth or at least damage it for
[1:34:10.840 --> 1:34:16.120]  thousands of years i mean it just it just has destruction written all over it and compared to
[1:34:16.120 --> 1:34:21.800]  the statesman that we had just a few decades ago it seems like our elites are degenerating
[1:34:21.800 --> 1:34:26.440]  extremely quickly is that an accurate statement and how would you describe the makeup of these
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:38.440]  lunatics well alex with regard to the russian situation as you know the american foreign policy
[1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:45.720]  has been taken over by the new york conservatives and they are wallowing in the hubris of their
[1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:54.840]  exceptionalism we're so exceptional and we're omnipotent and so it's this notion of american
[1:34:54.840 --> 1:35:03.800]  hegemony over the world that makes them unable to understand the russian point of view get off our
[1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:13.080]  doorstep so they can't even understand why the russians are upset and and so they they turn it
[1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:19.800]  into an act of aggression on the part of the russians so it's impossible for them to even
[1:35:19.800 --> 1:35:28.120]  comprehend how dangerous the situation is now the wider question to do claus schwaab and all of that
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:36.600]  that's a that's a different form of idiocy and it is independent of the brewing of the current
[1:35:36.600 --> 1:35:49.240]  brewing problem with the russians so really what it comes down to is that the inability of people
[1:35:49.240 --> 1:35:58.920]  who are so full of themselves to see anything outside their own aura of glory power and dr
[1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:05.480]  roberts you just hit the nail on the head there that you have competing global hegemonic delusions
[1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:12.840]  of grandeur of megalomania with the neo-con military industrial complex that is in many areas
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:18.280]  sublimated itself into the great reset corporate dream of corporate world government and world
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:25.160]  ids and world social credit scores but the two systems we really study them are actually in
[1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:29.880]  collision course with each other in ways and then you talk about delusion i've been around as i
[1:36:29.880 --> 1:36:33.960]  know you have as well some of these globalist pretty high-level ones and they really are
[1:36:33.960 --> 1:36:39.400]  like on insane power trips they think they're invincible and a lot of them are really incompetent
[1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:45.160]  they just represent trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars of fiat currency and as they
[1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:51.720]  say pride go before a fall this really gets me concerned yeah well you're right to be concerned
[1:36:52.520 --> 1:37:01.960]  and i think we'll learn in the coming days that the russians have had enough and we'll see some
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:09.800]  demonstration of of force and there's nothing we can do about it look i just saw recently
[1:37:09.800 --> 1:37:18.040]  um um a month old news release from provider that the russians had ordered all of their
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:26.840]  nuclear submarines to see on on full war war bases and this is not to attack us but it's to be
[1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:35.080]  positioned so that when they deal with the the unwelcome bases on their border uh that we'll
[1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:43.320]  be constrained from doing anything stupid because their forces are already deployed and when this
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:54.760]  recognition becomes widespread we may see more realistic behavior in washington and in the
[1:37:54.760 --> 1:38:02.280]  eu but at the moment there's no sign of any realism exactly so so the hollywood mindset
[1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:07.640]  of hating the russians and all that we see now you know invading into the whole neocon system
[1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:11.640]  that goes back to the trotsky it's you know being kicked out and coming through mexico and the us
[1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:17.320]  and taking over the republican party all because of that delusion uh we have the death con system
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:23.720]  moving up the scale here and we have the the nuclear war clock moving closer to midnight
[1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:34.920]  yeah well i think i think the only way it would come a nuclear war you see the united states has
[1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:41.800]  no capability of fighting russia or china in a conventional war but if they got involved in
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:46.440]  one they would be quicker the united states would be quickly defeated and so they would probably
[1:38:46.440 --> 1:38:53.480]  be too proud to accept that and so that's when they would bring in the nukes it would be their last
[1:38:53.480 --> 1:39:03.560]  chance to save face from the defeat so there is that danger of nuclear war but everyone needs to
[1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:12.360]  understand is it's the united states this pression pressuring russia and has been for two decades it's
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:19.160]  not the russians doing this and what they are doing is in response and they've been very very
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:26.520]  uh low key about it until now they've run out of patience so we'll just have to see what happens
[1:39:26.520 --> 1:39:31.400]  is out of our hands so is it fair to say putting up the death con system the russians have a similar
[1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:38.200]  program that we are going between two and one now because two is get ready to deploy and then
[1:39:38.200 --> 1:39:42.520]  going into one is have been deployed or being deployed so the russians are moving their forces
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:48.440]  around in case when they do conventional strikes nato and the us attack them with nuclear weapons
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:52.600]  then we go to full nuclear war so they're literally putting us into a mexican standoff position
[1:39:53.160 --> 1:40:00.600]  saying you can't make that move well i think that's what they what they're doing i mean they don't
[1:40:00.600 --> 1:40:07.560]  want they don't want any kind of war much less than nuclear war but um they have realized that
[1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:14.040]  they've got to take some action to protect themselves if we have bases all around their border
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:18.760]  and you know in recent we tried to do the same thing in kazakhstan that we did in ukraine
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:28.040]  to then prevent present them the same problem in central asia that they have uh with ukraine
[1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:34.360]  with a hostile uh take so you do think that was an attempt in color revolution what we just saw
[1:40:35.480 --> 1:40:41.880]  oh of course it was yeah of course it was i mean it was obviously um it was the most obvious thing
[1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:49.480]  that it was an attempt to see the border russia has with kazakhstan i think it's the biggest
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:53.480]  foreign border it has it is the biggest it is the biggest contiguous land border in the world
[1:40:53.480 --> 1:41:02.840]  i looked it up this morning so yeah it was definitely a cia operation um uh you know that
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:12.280]  kind of spontaneity doesn't happen it has to be organized and it was armed so um there's no doubt
[1:41:12.280 --> 1:41:20.600]  about it but the russians had learned the lesson from ukraine and from belarus and and so they
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:28.760]  didn't just sit there and let it happen like they did in ukraine and neither did the president of
[1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:35.720]  um kazakhstan he didn't do what the ukrainian president did and give up and flee he said nope
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:45.880]  shoot him down stop it and he called in all of the security forces in that central asian group
[1:41:47.160 --> 1:41:52.920]  of which russia is a part of and also they've now arrested the ex-intelligence chief claiming
[1:41:52.920 --> 1:42:01.800]  he worked for the cia it's entirely possible yeah it's entirely possible so is this is this the
[1:42:01.800 --> 1:42:07.960]  controllers of biden uh in brinksmanship triggering this operation to destabilize and uh you know make
[1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:11.880]  russia think twice because i would think that would put russia into more of a doomsday scenario
[1:42:11.880 --> 1:42:19.880]  with stuff like this going on yeah it's it's independent of biden it's been going on for a

[1:44:03.160 --> 1:44:08.200]  with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're doing that not
[1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:13.880]  because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and we are powerful
[1:44:13.880 --> 1:44:19.400]  and the social engineers fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous internet saying
[1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:27.480]  that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary
[1:44:27.480 --> 1:44:33.720]  if the situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil
[1:44:33.720 --> 1:44:40.760]  and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed
[1:44:40.760 --> 1:44:45.560]  on to god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep info

[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:55.800]  manifesting and setting up is satanic and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of
[1:44:55.800 --> 1:45:00.680]  the beast they just announced why do my enemies hate me so much why do the globalists take you
[1:45:00.680 --> 1:45:07.320]  so much why do they hate america so much because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical
[1:45:07.960 --> 1:45:14.040]  system that they're pushing cannot coexist with it's very very simple for their world government
[1:45:14.040 --> 1:45:20.600]  their anti-human post-human eugenics system to flourish freedom and liberty and new process
[1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:27.560]  injustice and god-fearing systems must fail so sure you didn't start a fight with bill gates
[1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:33.640]  you didn't start a fight with david rockefeller you didn't start a fight with the un they started
[1:45:33.640 --> 1:45:39.480]  a fight with you and they're not gonna back down and they're not gonna go away and they're not going
[1:45:39.480 --> 1:45:45.640]  to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of god put into them but the average person
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:50.440]  still doesn't even know about the new world order or about globalism or about corporate fascism and
[1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:55.560]  it's not until people understand that and that we're under attack we have any chance of beating
[1:45:55.560 --> 1:46:03.720]  these people get our great bag of it here i mean this is from people say why is it from
[1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:09.080]  Chiapas mexico the communists well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild
[1:46:09.080 --> 1:46:14.600]  harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better than guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from
[1:46:14.600 --> 1:46:18.360]  the little farmers that you know the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:22.280]  whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[1:46:22.280 --> 1:46:25.720]  mexican government take over so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels and i've been buying
[1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:29.400]  it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under
[1:46:29.400 --> 1:46:33.800]  another name for about 50 more per pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're
[1:46:33.800 --> 1:46:39.240]  gonna find anywhere it's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally um in
[1:46:39.240 --> 1:46:46.200]  fact i'm not gonna tell you a little story um we had like that okay you want to believe it
[1:46:46.200 --> 1:46:51.640]  anyway so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't find us
[1:46:51.640 --> 1:46:55.080]  you don't want to steer that's fine
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:05.080]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:47:15.400 --> 1:47:18.280]  all right we got more information with bill gates
[1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:24.600]  Atlantic Monthly and others tied to the big pedophile rings that's coming up next hour and
[1:47:24.600 --> 1:47:30.360]  your phone calls and so much more but remember paul craig roberts was the editor at the wall
[1:47:30.360 --> 1:47:34.920]  street journal best-selling author some of the biggest news services out there he wasn't just
[1:47:34.920 --> 1:47:40.200]  the chief financial advisor of the u.s government under reagan paul craig roberts.org and he's
[1:47:40.200 --> 1:47:47.720]  writing big articles on his site with the headlines the population is being killed off
[1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:54.680]  with COVID mRNA vaccines and that's a january 6 report and then he just shows the british medical
[1:47:54.680 --> 1:48:00.200]  journal well let me show you some more documents a uk health security agency just came out friday
[1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:05.560]  you're more than 75 likely to get sick or die if you've had the shot and when you take a third
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:11.560]  shot the statistics are even higher i did a whole hour on that first hour and then i've got another
[1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:16.920]  report of a major university department of political science university of alberta with a worldwide
[1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:23.560]  analysis of government numbers showing the same levels much higher levels of mass death a major
[1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:29.720]  insurance company owners have come out and said we're seeing a 40 increase in overall death
[1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:36.040]  ages 18 and 64 uh you sir are a famous statistician and economists i would say that's your main
[1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:41.080]  thing you wear a lot of hats you so that means you can look at statistics and you talk about some
[1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:47.080]  of these in your article this is overwhelming i mean even i myself know this is going on but i have
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:51.960]  trouble getting my mind around something so obvious because if you and i know this and
[1:48:51.960 --> 1:48:57.880]  over the cdc documents back in october of 2020 said they thought all this would happen in adverse
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:49:03.320]  reactions then what is the bigger plan in all of this please give us your analysis on that
[1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:12.360]  you know that's the that's a very difficult question to answer i mean we know for sure that
[1:49:13.320 --> 1:49:22.360]  profit for the pharmaceutical companies is behind this fake pandemic and the vaccine
[1:49:22.920 --> 1:49:29.240]  we know also that it's being used throughout the world particularly the western free world
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:39.320]  uh to destroy civil liberties for government control over people um and as you said since
[1:49:40.280 --> 1:49:48.280]  everyone now knows that the vaccine is more dangerous than covid why do they keep trying
[1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:57.880]  to coerce uh vaccination of everyone and so it kind of suggests that when you try to coerce
[1:49:57.880 --> 1:50:05.560]  people to take a vaccine you know is going to harm them are you actually trying to shrink the
[1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:13.480]  population so the circumstantial evidence just from that suggests that yes there's some kind of
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:22.600]  population controls a program behind this when we we have this i forget his name now but he's the
[1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:31.640]  expert on vaccine patents uh any kind of prescription medicine patents and he has
[1:50:31.640 --> 1:50:39.480]  testified several times and i have links to his presentations on my site that they've been working
[1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:48.360]  on first the virus on on creating covid and on the vaccine for years for years they've been working
[1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:54.840]  in this well it was presented to us as a unknown new development it just showed up well he says no
[1:50:54.840 --> 1:51:02.520]  it's not the case like there are four thousand patents he says on this virus dating back to the
[1:51:02.520 --> 1:51:12.520]  late nineties well uh i couldn't say that that's true or not but he says it is and he is an expert
[1:51:12.520 --> 1:51:20.200]  on these uh patents dealing with medical treatments so well doc let me just back you up i i'm not a
[1:51:20.200 --> 1:51:24.760]  bioscientist and i'm and i'm not an expert on the patents but i did go look and they did release
[1:51:24.760 --> 1:51:30.600]  the last year and a half Fauci emails where they're developing a a covid SARS airborne virus that has
[1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:35.720]  these properties it's the same virus combinations and they tell the vaccine makers months before we
[1:51:35.720 --> 1:51:42.360]  ever hear about wilhelm in in 2019 start producing the vaccines now so they didn't just suddenly in
[1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:47.720]  you know oh have a vaccine one day they developed they had been obsessed with this combination for
[1:51:47.720 --> 1:51:52.360]  as you said decades and we're building it and developing it through peter dazik as their cut
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:58.760]  out there was a big uh bruja about it in 2015 when scientists in the u.s said we should not be
[1:51:58.760 --> 1:52:03.800]  developing this here in the u.s at chapel hill so they moved it to wuhan i mean the paper trail
[1:52:03.800 --> 1:52:12.680]  is just insane on this that's not that's true and that's uh now public records um the thing is is
[1:52:12.680 --> 1:52:19.560]  it's harder to establish that than it is to establish the fact that the vaccine
[1:52:21.080 --> 1:52:30.360]  destroy what the vaccine does it turns your own immune system into a weapon against your own body
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:39.800]  this this is what is now known so when you take that vaccine you are causing your own immune system
[1:52:40.680 --> 1:52:49.400]  to attack your own vital organs and so what what are called uh adverse reactions
[1:52:50.520 --> 1:52:55.960]  they're not exactly adverse reactions it's not like you're having an allergic reaction to the
[1:52:55.960 --> 1:53:03.400]  vaccine or something like that the vaccine actually turns your own immune system into a
[1:53:03.400 --> 1:53:09.640]  weapon against your body and a lot of the scientists say once you've had this a shot
[1:53:10.280 --> 1:53:16.440]  you got that problem for the rest of your life if you get double vax this works if you get double
[1:53:16.440 --> 1:53:25.320]  vaccine boosted it's even worse you get a second booster uh it's even worse and so the more of this
[1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:34.120]  stuff they dump into you the more effective your own immune system is as a weapon against you
[1:53:35.640 --> 1:53:43.080]  so this is easy to establish it's now established there are links to all the papers on my site
[1:53:43.880 --> 1:53:53.000]  and so why are these scientists censored and shut down and fired because they're telling the truth
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:54:01.160]  and the truth exposes the situation well the authorities know this they also know that children
[1:54:01.160 --> 1:54:08.200]  don't have a bad effect from covid they don't they don't really catch it it doesn't do much to them
[1:54:08.200 --> 1:54:15.880]  but the vaccine causes heart attacks in little kids and yet they're insisting on vaccinating
[1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:24.680]  little kids well now when you are determined to coerce people to take a vaccine that's going to
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:32.920]  injure them kill them then that does imply that you're up to no good this is not a mistake it's
[1:54:32.920 --> 1:54:40.040]  not that the authorities don't know the bad effects of the vaccine it's not that they don't
[1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:48.040]  they don't know that the vaccine is killing more people than covid they do know that they also know
[1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:54.280]  that the vaccine does not protect that's why you have to have the booster that's why you have to
[1:54:54.280 --> 1:54:59.400]  have the second booster that's why you have to continue wearing masks they agree the vaccine
[1:54:59.400 --> 1:55:06.040]  doesn't protect and yet it's they insist that people have to have the vaccine in order to be
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:14.040]  protected but they know it doesn't protect and of course the media never says a word about this
[1:55:14.040 --> 1:55:23.000]  we're devoid of any media other than you know programs like yourself and so you have to then
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:29.880]  say well look this is not a mistake this is intentional they're killing people on purpose
[1:55:29.880 --> 1:55:37.080]  absolutely well dr roberts i think they have a name for this it's evil and it's a collusion of
[1:55:37.080 --> 1:55:42.200]  big corporations and corrupt governments in the media really believe and they can get away with
[1:55:42.200 --> 1:55:46.680]  total murder and if you look at claus throb and their ideology they're into depopulation and i
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:51.800]  think you said it that's what this is but thank god people are at least waking up i don't see how
[1:55:51.800 --> 1:56:00.280]  they thought they never get away with this i mean this is just wild well they get away with it because
[1:56:00.280 --> 1:56:06.680]  control the media or the media is controlled by them the grants the advertising revenues
[1:56:09.240 --> 1:56:16.600]  plus the vast majority of the people they don't have they don't think about this they listen to
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:24.120]  what cnn says what the news say okay that's for them the reality the reality is handed to them by
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:30.600]  the prostitutes by fallacy by the people running the show and that's why getting this out is so
[1:56:30.600 --> 1:56:34.520]  important join us again it's been too long i see you doing a lot of interviews and you're doing

[1:57:59.080 --> 1:58:03.160]  weakest because now they've revealed themselves now their world government their permanent
[1:58:03.160 --> 1:58:09.000]  martial law their medical tyranny is out in the open their depopulation agenda has been exposed
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:13.080]  but they're using their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet

[2:00:12.360 --> 2:00:18.280]  roberts the former editor of all street journal the main advisor to reagan the guy that helped
[2:00:18.280 --> 2:00:22.680]  broker the deal with the soviets and he's on record doing all that telling you they're trying to kill
[2:00:22.680 --> 2:00:27.160]  you on purpose this is all a depopulation operation and how many other top scientists have told you
[2:00:27.160 --> 2:00:31.400]  that i wish this wasn't the case ladies and gentlemen and now they're building emergency camps
[2:00:31.400 --> 2:00:37.160]  all the world karmic camps and saying they're gonna put you in them and deputize any be that the
[2:00:37.160 --> 2:00:41.640]  health department wants i told you an in game this is a global dictatorship of the health
[2:00:41.640 --> 2:00:47.480]  departments set up 120 years ago starting in england germany than the united states to round up
[2:00:47.480 --> 2:00:53.480]  poor people and sterilize them this is a dictatorship of the scientific mad scientist here's a report on
[2:00:53.480 --> 2:01:02.840]  it under the cover of darkness an urgent mission to bring infected people to safety both communities
[2:01:02.840 --> 2:01:09.000]  have now been placed in a hard lockdown in the searing 40 degree heat they'll be confined to
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:15.240]  these homes with food and supports delivered at a distance by rapid response teams a hard measure
[2:01:15.240 --> 2:01:21.800]  that could remain in place for wakes this is a camp in syberia scores of russians are being kept here
[2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:27.720]  surely this government is aware of the intentions to build these isolation camps from coast to coast
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:34.040]  and my question to the premier is how many of these camps will be built and how many people
[2:01:34.040 --> 2:01:39.560]  does this government expect to question what was it like for you and your your family inside this
[2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:45.960]  quarantine hotel can you can you describe what you went through thanks seven um yeah absolutely i
[2:01:45.960 --> 2:01:53.320]  mean it was an extremely difficult and you know onerous and traumatic process for for myself and
[2:01:53.320 --> 2:01:59.640]  our two daughters as 2022 begins the great reset rollout of predetermined covid quarantine camps
[2:01:59.640 --> 2:02:05.800]  is digging its claws into the blue dictatorships of the united states as info wars jamie white
[2:02:05.800 --> 2:02:11.800]  reports the state of washington may amend a law to allow the forcible detainment of residents into
[2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:18.360]  covid internment camps for defying state vaccine mandates the proposed revision to the covid protocol
[2:02:18.360 --> 2:02:24.600]  under the communicable and certain other diseases act would grant local health officers at his other
[2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:30.120]  sole discretion to issue an emergency detention order causing a person or group of persons to
[2:02:30.120 --> 2:02:36.440]  be immediately detained for purposes of isolation or quarantine additionally the measure would allow
[2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:43.080]  law enforcement to assist public health officials in detaining residents who refused the covid injection
[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:49.240]  this alarming measure comes in tandem with governor jansley's effort to hire strike teams to run
[2:02:49.240 --> 2:02:55.160]  quarantine camps outlined in the state's government jobs dot com website a term that has since been
[2:02:55.160 --> 2:03:01.480]  scrubbed from the website sometime after the bulletin was posted in september 2021 notably the
[2:03:01.480 --> 2:03:08.440]  communicable and certain other diseases act was certified on october 25th 2019 just months before

[2:03:25.320 --> 2:03:29.960]  in state of washington as well as nationally meanwhile new york governor kathy holchell
[2:03:29.960 --> 2:03:36.280]  attempts to pass a similar bill allowing authorities to forcibly detain anyone she deems a public
[2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:42.840]  health threat the bill called a dot 416 would allow the governor or the appropriate health
[2:03:42.840 --> 2:03:49.080]  official to order the removal and detention of any person afflicted with a communicable disease
[2:03:49.080 --> 2:03:54.120]  in the event that there is a state of health emergency declared by the governor in relation
[2:03:54.120 --> 2:04:01.560]  to such disease it goes on to say that any person or group removed or detained by order of the governor
[2:04:01.560 --> 2:04:07.720]  or his or her delegate shall be detained for as long as the department may direct we are not

[2:06:19.240 --> 2:06:28.840]  air period 28 plus if we had one article about governments and particularly a political party
[2:06:30.360 --> 2:06:36.200]  sending people with a new communicable disease that they say is super deadly and kills people
[2:06:37.640 --> 2:06:42.840]  who are infected two nursing homes to be put in the general population with people
[2:06:43.400 --> 2:06:48.360]  and to be put with the medical workers so they catch it and spread it with the most vulnerable
[2:06:48.360 --> 2:06:57.000]  group senior citizens in nursing homes we would be talking about it three four hours a day for years
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  and people would get arrested and they'd go to prison but with what's going on here with the death
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:10.680]  panel system here where they don't just decide who it lives and dies they decide to go out and kill you
[2:07:10.680 --> 2:07:18.520]  it is a footnote then in the same democratic states that did it before and now they're
[2:07:18.520 --> 2:07:26.040]  expanding it into other states they're having governors sign emergency orders to send COVID
[2:07:26.040 --> 2:07:32.600]  infected sick patients to nursing homes that have never even been about taking care of people who
[2:07:32.600 --> 2:07:41.560]  aren't senior citizens that is ghoulish ladies and gentlemen they got away with it the justice
[2:07:41.560 --> 2:07:49.160]  department said do it what happened two weeks ago the Manhattan DA who says he won't prosecute
[2:07:49.160 --> 2:08:02.600]  rapes and robberies literally he said that you can do that but if somebody went after that DA and
[2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:08.840]  i'm not saying do that oh it'd be a manhunt the biggest thing ever if somebody was to kill that DA
[2:08:10.600 --> 2:08:16.360]  this man was to walk up with a dagger and stab him right in the throat which god forbid somebody
[2:08:16.360 --> 2:08:21.640]  does it would be oh my god he's dead his life this person's a terrorist i'm gonna take all
[2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:28.680]  americans rights a government god that oversees the murder of 20 000 old people and says governor
[2:08:28.680 --> 2:08:33.720]  qualmo you're allowed to kill 20 000 people while walking their families out for a year and a half
[2:08:33.720 --> 2:08:40.200]  while you do it while you made 53 000 per person you intubated the number is even higher if you
[2:08:40.200 --> 2:08:46.280]  kill you and you got 96 of those that got put on ventilators in new york dying i mean they knew
[2:08:46.280 --> 2:08:53.880]  what they were doing those people needed steroids but they wouldn't let them have steroids they killed
[2:08:53.880 --> 2:09:01.400]  them but first oh your families can't be there we got to lock everything up but it would families
[2:09:01.400 --> 2:09:07.880]  couldn't be there so they could kill them people go well the disease isn't that deadly why why'd
[2:09:07.880 --> 2:09:14.360]  somebody die because they would infect them and then do PCR test and once they were infected they
[2:09:14.360 --> 2:09:22.600]  would intubate them i've had new york whistleblower nurses on three of them famous ones who shot video
[2:09:22.600 --> 2:09:27.320]  of the files notice nobody charged them for hippo violation because they were exposing criminal
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:32.520]  activity the media just ignored it and banned it off youtube and instagram and twitter of nurses
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:38.520]  one of them that wonderful lady if you're gonna name the combat vet and she's working in this
[2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:42.440]  emergency hospital she goes up there to help people it's basically empty and all they're bringing
[2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:47.480]  it in is homeless people who aren't even testing positive and then she sees them dead three days
[2:09:47.480 --> 2:09:53.080]  later and she looks in the file they didn't even have covid they just murdered them murdered and
[2:09:53.080 --> 2:09:56.600]  you're like well there's too many homeless people folks if you have that attitude you're a fool
[2:09:56.600 --> 2:10:02.280]  they're gonna get you to and yeah i'll tell you you're not gonna hear black lives matter talk about
[2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:06.120]  it but i got the numbers in every leftist city in the country where they did this
[2:10:06.120 --> 2:10:15.400]  over 70 percent of them are black men oh but it's the liberals that love you
[2:10:15.400 --> 2:10:21.000]  they got the black mayors and the black police chiefs and they oh everything's african themed
[2:10:22.520 --> 2:10:28.200]  there she is new york undercover nurse confirms covid 19 criminal hoax it was from june of 2020

[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:44.680]  showing the patients they murdered they murdered them and we just move on from that like okay big

[2:11:33.800 --> 2:11:39.000]  oh the policy is from the un to run the pressure twice as high as you're supposed to for covid
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:43.560]  even though you want no pressure with covid in the lungs it's an auto inflammatory deal
[2:11:43.560 --> 2:11:49.800]  oh we're gonna kill you and then you go and you hug your family members through plastic
[2:11:49.800 --> 2:11:55.480]  in some fake ridiculous ritual that everybody goes through while the very hospital or the very
[2:11:55.480 --> 2:11:59.960]  nursing home is murdering people first it was five thousand six thousand then he suppressed
[2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:07.720]  the numbers for a year it's now about 22 000 people we know of that the globalist murdered
[2:12:08.600 --> 2:12:14.520]  oh but you can't see your baby you're dirty but baby's bad oh no it's got to be through plastic
[2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:21.640]  this is the sick mind control the mass hysteria the biggest hoax in human history and if you try
[2:12:21.640 --> 2:12:28.600]  to call the mass hysteria hoax out they tell you it doesn't exist so i want to open the phones up
[2:12:28.600 --> 2:12:33.240]  for first time callers on the internment camp legislation all over the country introduced
[2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:39.320]  to put people that are un-injected in camps told you that was coming it's here or on all of the
[2:12:39.320 --> 2:12:44.040]  british medical journal and the british government and the u.s government numbers admitting the same
[2:12:44.040 --> 2:12:48.840]  thing over 75 percent of the deaths are in the double and triple vaxed and that's not even counting
[2:12:48.840 --> 2:12:52.600]  the first 14 days if you get a shot they don't count you as faxed if you die in the first 14
[2:12:52.600 --> 2:12:56.920]  and that's what most of them do it's in the mid 80s of the deaths if you look at those are hired
[2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:06.920]  80 plus percent dying from the shot of course they are and now i told you over a year ago the cdc
[2:13:06.920 --> 2:13:12.040]  document their website calls for taking your children if you're unvaccinated and putting
[2:13:12.040 --> 2:13:17.880]  them in a camp for their safety even though no one's even sick they're going to take your
[2:13:17.880 --> 2:13:21.560]  children for your safety and now it's in the legislation and you're like well this is going
[2:13:21.560 --> 2:13:28.280]  to start a shooting war that's the plan fire the nurses fire the police fire the medical
[2:13:28.280 --> 2:13:34.120]  workers had everything break down uh make the jail guards go home then release the violent
[2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:42.360]  criminals then put the peaceful people in the jail this is the takedown of civilization told
[2:13:42.360 --> 2:13:51.560]  free number to join us 877-789-2539-877-789 alex right on your screen if you're a tv viewer
[2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:59.720]  radio listeners 877-789-2539 what are we going to do about this because i agree
[2:13:59.720 --> 2:14:04.280]  that the justice department's god and we're trash and it's good they're not prosecuting anybody for
[2:14:04.280 --> 2:14:08.600]  murdering folks in the old folks homes i think it's good the da of new york isn't going to
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:13.960]  prosecute crimes against the public and that he's going to help continue to murder old people i think
[2:14:13.960 --> 2:14:19.160]  that's good and i think nobody should demand to see their loved ones you should stay locked out of
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:22.760]  there while they kill them let them kill your mother let them kill your father let them kill
[2:14:22.760 --> 2:14:27.080]  your sister let them kill your brother i think we should have drag queen pedophile story time
[2:14:27.080 --> 2:14:30.440]  i think we should have open borders i think we should take the shots even though they don't
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:35.480]  work except they kill us no no actually i don't think all of that how far are we gonna let this go
[2:14:35.480 --> 2:14:43.240]  because i'll tell you we got to go to places like connecticut connecticut asked nursing homes to
[2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:49.560]  accept covid positive patients again new york's massive nursing home death toll as a result of
[2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:55.080]  similar democrat policy going unheeded by bureaucrats it's not unheeded you look at their
[2:14:55.080 --> 2:14:58.600]  investments it's in those medical groups are going to murder these people the connecticut
[2:14:58.600 --> 2:15:03.160]  department of public health that's an evil ass state folks is requesting nursing homes
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:09.560]  taking covid positive patients to alleviate hospital overcapacity yes really except they
[2:15:09.560 --> 2:15:13.960]  fire all the good nurses and doctors bringing the national guard the national guard aren't doctors
[2:15:13.960 --> 2:15:18.040]  i don't know what's going on the special technicians come in and i'm gonna have to do another uh
[2:15:18.040 --> 2:15:24.440]  innovation until thursday the state have required hospitalized cogent patients to test negative
[2:15:24.440 --> 2:15:29.400]  before being discharged but this new guidance waves the requirement thanks to governor ned
[2:15:29.400 --> 2:15:35.800]  lamont's executive order and we're just gonna sit here while they murder everybody again aren't
[2:15:35.800 --> 2:15:41.160]  we because that's what we do connecticut asked nursing homes to accept covid positive patients
[2:15:41.160 --> 2:15:46.200]  from hospitals and the trial lawyers won't do a damn thing because they're all in on it they get
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:51.080]  given orders by the democrats they don't actually stand for anything good most of them are pedophiles

[2:17:18.920 --> 2:17:24.040]  what you do and publicly they're saying they're gonna decide when you can travel and when you
[2:17:24.040 --> 2:17:29.160]  can't travel and mastercard and then all the other big companies are currently announcing
[2:17:29.160 --> 2:17:34.840]  they're gonna track what you do and where you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it this is the
[2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:40.600]  holy grail of tyranny ladies and gentlemen this is the takeover in humanity better wake up and say

[2:20:33.080 --> 2:20:39.000]  appreciate everybody calling in john and steve and thomas and vegas patriot and clem mic patty
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:44.840]  michael and others i'm gonna go to the order these calls have been received let's go to florida and
[2:20:44.840 --> 2:20:51.800]  talk to steven you're on the year welcome hey alex how are you i'm just totally freaked out i mean
[2:20:51.800 --> 2:20:56.200]  it's it's all confirmed official government documents they're murdering us in mass so sad
[2:20:56.200 --> 2:21:01.640]  yes sir that makes two of us listen i just wanted to share something with you that's been on my heart
[2:21:01.640 --> 2:21:06.520]  then praying a lot about this and i know a lot of us we're in this community of those that are
[2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:12.600]  awake we're talking about this being a depopulation agenda these poison death shots and i personally
[2:21:12.600 --> 2:21:16.920]  after some prayer and some thought i think there's there's more to it than just that i think that
[2:21:16.920 --> 2:21:22.760]  the depopulation is a fortunate byproduct by fortune i mean on their behalf i think if they
[2:21:22.760 --> 2:21:27.800]  wanted to depopulate us they would have done something if it was had to do with genetics
[2:21:27.800 --> 2:21:33.160]  would have been something like maybe second generation maybe sterilize them so that it
[2:21:33.160 --> 2:21:37.960]  wouldn't you know initially tie back to them we hear a lot about this whole universal basic
[2:21:37.960 --> 2:21:42.760]  income and of course leading to social credit score and i think one of the primary objectives of
[2:21:42.760 --> 2:21:48.680]  this is to maim and to kill as many people as possible and to be out in the open about it
[2:21:48.680 --> 2:21:54.040]  because at the end of the day the only way people are going to accept that universal basic income
[2:21:54.040 --> 2:21:58.200]  i have to believe that there's there's still a lot of hardworking people out there the only
[2:21:58.200 --> 2:22:03.320]  way everybody's going to accept this is if their primary breadwinners are hurt from having a stroke
[2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:09.800]  debilitated dead gone and there's just thousands hundreds of thousands of households well steven
[2:22:09.800 --> 2:22:15.160]  steven what i mean here's the thing about these schools of thought you're a hundred percent right
[2:22:15.160 --> 2:22:19.960]  that that's part of why they launched the attack but they do everything on a multi-level attack
[2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:33.320]  and if you actually go read spars drill 2035 2025 2028 if you actually go read event 201 if you
[2:22:33.320 --> 2:22:39.080]  actually go read lockstep they actually admit this is a takeover and and how they're even
[2:22:39.080 --> 2:22:43.160]  going to blame government ministers in the end but not big pharma which you know she happened
[2:22:43.160 --> 2:22:49.160]  she happened and how the public will learn that the vaccine for respiratory illness actually
[2:22:49.160 --> 2:22:56.920]  sterilizes and hurts them and how that will further collapse society and so yes it's a controlled
[2:22:56.920 --> 2:23:04.440]  long collapse so that they can again pose as the saviors as they bring down the nation states so
[2:23:05.480 --> 2:23:09.080]  you're absolutely right and so it's not like oh hey they're doing it for this they're doing it for
[2:23:09.080 --> 2:23:14.200]  that they're doing it for a bunch of reasons but they want a slow death and i think what you're saying
[2:23:14.200 --> 2:23:19.320]  is it's fortunate that it's so strong it kills some people right up front that's too little too
[2:23:19.320 --> 2:23:25.880]  obvious they overdid it um clearly that they want to kill you slower which the actuary show is now
[2:23:25.880 --> 2:23:30.440]  happening so it's harder to know who did it and so people don't turn against them so evil's not
[2:23:30.440 --> 2:23:35.320]  perfect they don't have it all figured out they have a lot of holes in their operation and there's
[2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:40.280]  other nation states not going along with them so this is going to be a very very crazy dangerous
[2:23:40.280 --> 2:23:46.280]  spectacular time to be alive steve yes sir it is i want to thank you for your work i know you
[2:23:46.280 --> 2:23:50.680]  don't like to be patted on the head but uh you you're a great general we we appreciate your
[2:23:50.680 --> 2:23:56.760]  leadership in this and i i myself think of ways that i can i can affect people even just on a
[2:23:56.760 --> 2:24:02.600]  on a micro level uh brother let me just stop you let me just stop you i want to thank you it's
[2:24:02.600 --> 2:24:06.520]  not that i don't like to be thanked i appreciate you and i thank you and i do like to be thanked
[2:24:06.520 --> 2:24:11.640]  it's just that so much is happening so much is going on i don't want people to think about how
[2:24:11.640 --> 2:24:15.720]  it's about alex shone's it's about all of us together and all of us being leaders in fact
[2:24:15.720 --> 2:24:21.400]  i see you guys a tweet i wanted to put on screen of listeners you know that are just taking action
[2:24:22.120 --> 2:24:27.480]  getting the word out about the globalist and one of the best ways to do it is info wars.com so
[2:24:27.480 --> 2:24:33.160]  i want to salute you steven thank you very much thank you very much and i want to if i may real
[2:24:33.160 --> 2:24:36.920]  quick i just want to salute all the men out there and the women too but those that are
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:41.240]  standing up in their homes and being a priest of their homes i think that the first step in
[2:24:41.240 --> 2:24:47.160]  beating this is for us to take control of our our own families and then therefore and thereby our
[2:24:47.160 --> 2:24:53.720]  communities by being priests in the home by being morally upright by working hard and by building
[2:24:53.720 --> 2:24:58.120]  these small communities like you always talk about so thank you for the opportunity for me to share
[2:24:58.120 --> 2:25:04.920]  that thank you sir god bless you all right let's jam in another call here let's go ahead and talk to
[2:25:05.560 --> 2:25:13.960]  patty patty thanks for calling from new jersey hey how's it going alex go ahead wow it's uh truly
[2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:19.800]  an honor i'll give you a quick plug i could do this morning i want to tell you guys that down and out
[2:25:19.800 --> 2:25:24.120]  works every single time you want eight hours of sleep down and out knock out and get you back
[2:25:24.120 --> 2:25:29.320]  in the fight the next day every day alex this is a more than an honor to talk to you on the 13th
[2:25:29.320 --> 2:25:34.280]  generation american and to talk to you is is phenomenal thank you for everything you do you
[2:25:34.280 --> 2:25:39.880]  have inspired me to be an absolute monster in the field trying to spread the word about
[2:25:40.440 --> 2:25:46.040]  what americans need to know about so i uh started i just needed to come and tell everybody that the
[2:25:46.040 --> 2:25:51.960]  one world currency that they're going to be they're going to be pushing out there is most likely xrp
[2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:58.280]  but the fact of the matter is it's a cryptocurrency and everybody can get involved go buy it so when
[2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:05.800]  the great great reset those happen they're not left standing and completely affected by it on a
[2:26:05.800 --> 2:26:14.200]  monetary level well people ask why i have gotten involved in crypto currencies when they're obviously
[2:26:14.200 --> 2:26:19.480]  a bubble but the federal reserve is a bubble and the yen and the yon and the euro are a bubble
[2:26:19.480 --> 2:26:24.120]  and so i never got involved in stocks and bonds because i knew i would get obsessed with it and
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:29.320]  you know it's a very corrupt area and being a talk show host they could get me on insider trading
[2:26:29.960 --> 2:26:35.560]  so i knew six months before joe made his announcement that he was looking to move to texas that he'd
[2:26:35.560 --> 2:26:40.360]  you know had a Spotify deal but i wasn't supposed to talk about it and i didn't but also didn't use
[2:26:40.360 --> 2:26:45.800]  that as insider trading i didn't tell anybody i didn't tell my family i didn't tell anybody uh
[2:26:45.800 --> 2:26:51.080]  and then i didn't buy any any Spotify and it basically went up 40 the first week he joined it
[2:26:51.080 --> 2:26:56.200]  so that's an example of how i could be in those worlds but with crypto i went ahead and got into
[2:26:56.200 --> 2:27:01.640]  all of it to learn about it because in the future that's where the globalists are taking us so it
[2:27:01.640 --> 2:27:07.560]  isn't like i like what they're doing uh but i also want to see some independent crypto groups out
[2:27:07.560 --> 2:27:12.280]  there that are the counter to this because independent currencies are the future and just
[2:27:12.280 --> 2:27:16.680]  because bill gates everybody else want to control it doesn't mean it's bad it is a tool so that's
[2:27:16.680 --> 2:27:21.880]  my view what's your view i'm totally in the same spot and that's exactly what's happening now that's
[2:27:21.880 --> 2:27:27.000]  what i've been doing i have been trying to mix the cryptocurrency world with the patriot world
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  because these two communities they really don't mix well and i've seen that i've been following you
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:38.280]  for a while now i have my own podcast that was about fighting government i just got my youtube
[2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:44.840]  channel taken down and deleted permanently badge of honor on saturday so it's all about your podcast
[2:27:44.840 --> 2:27:52.680]  brother well it took a lot of your points and expose the fox points expose the cnn points put
[2:27:52.680 --> 2:27:56.920]  everything into perspective but you know i wanted to say to you but personally this is this is also
[2:27:56.920 --> 2:28:03.560]  i get to on twitter it's it's crazy as soon as you say alex jones you have people come rushing in
[2:28:04.200 --> 2:28:09.720]  automatically to discredit alex jones because they want to prove to everybody that they know
[2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:15.160]  something as if it even matters we're trying to get out there social credit score a lot of
[2:28:15.160 --> 2:28:19.800]  those are bots aren't real people but they are encouraged to do that to up their social credit
[2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:25.160]  score i'm one of the main targets because they see me as a populist they see me as a symbol of
[2:28:25.160 --> 2:28:30.600]  humanity just like they hate you they hate me and so when they attack they see info wars as an
[2:28:30.600 --> 2:28:36.280]  example of people building a base of operations a base of resistance to their tyranny and that
[2:28:36.280 --> 2:28:43.800]  absolutely enrages them thank you so much for the call all right we're going to go to rc and kevin
[2:28:44.840 --> 2:28:50.440]  and clem and joe and others they have somebody hang up when we're talking about force inoculations
[2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:59.400]  i want to hear what they had to say but they are they're right back christmas 2021 is gone

[2:33:33.480 --> 2:33:42.440]  simple i feel extremely frustrated that this whole new world order takeover is really happening i
[2:33:42.440 --> 2:33:46.360]  mean i knew they were doing bad things around the world i knew the um was running child kidnapping
[2:33:46.360 --> 2:33:53.320]  rings i knew they had mad scientist operations paying off the intelligentsia and i knew that
[2:33:53.320 --> 2:33:58.200]  theoretically they were planning the release of the virus and the lockdowns and the global ids and
[2:33:58.200 --> 2:34:02.760]  microchips under the skin to buy and sell that's how i was able to predict all i said these people
[2:34:02.760 --> 2:34:09.880]  are really planning all this but to now be living in it and to know that they know the secret about
[2:34:09.880 --> 2:34:18.200]  humans these globalists too that we adapt to things and we don't tend to adapt actually by
[2:34:18.760 --> 2:34:25.560]  overcoming it we just adapt to learn to live with it well you can't adapt to something that's designed
[2:34:25.560 --> 2:34:30.040]  to slowly take you over and finally kill you that's not adaption that's extermination that's
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:37.160]  becoming obsolete so i'm gonna go back to your phone calls but we haven't confirmed this yet
[2:34:37.160 --> 2:34:42.760]  but the the numbers are coming in uh well i'll just get to it later but there's definitely
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:48.360]  another major purge that is accelerating and taking place and i want to go ahead and go back
[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:55.240]  your phone calls or i'll never get to the news but just look at these headlines nato prepares for
[2:34:55.240 --> 2:35:04.280]  quote new armed conflict in europe with russia if talks fail i mean people back when stuff like
[2:35:04.280 --> 2:35:09.400]  this happened in the early 60s cared it was on every tv channel it was a big deal the russian
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:16.360]  ukrainian border might as well be uranus or pluto or the the dark side of the moon i mean
[2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:21.560]  the general public just does not know how dangerous the world is and that most of the
[2:35:21.560 --> 2:35:27.080]  big billionaires and powerful people have been quietly moving to middle and nowhere fortresses
[2:35:27.080 --> 2:35:36.120]  because they know big events are coming down and there really should be a way to stop this there
[2:35:36.120 --> 2:35:42.120]  really should be a way to turn this around but it's just just totally insane so i'll just throw
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:46.440]  this out there because nobody hates plugging more than i do but if i don't do it live on the show
[2:35:46.440 --> 2:35:52.360]  at least once an hour will will be shut down and it's not just us getting shut down and the left
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:57.960]  being successful taking me off the air i mean a part of me would like to be off the air and not
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:36:04.120]  have to do this all the time and and and fight these people but that's kind of my flesh my spirit
[2:36:04.120 --> 2:36:09.560]  wants to fight even harder and what we're doing now is more important than it's ever been so i'm
[2:36:09.560 --> 2:36:14.120]  just thanking all of our am and f of affiliates they're so wonderful please support them listeners
[2:36:14.680 --> 2:36:19.480]  and i also just want to thank all the listeners for what they've done over the years and i want

[2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:17.080]  because supplies are about to go out 96 reviews in full war store dot com but i've already taken
[2:37:17.080 --> 2:37:20.760]  my x2 today but i just really love it when i forget to take it for a week or so i really feel it
[2:37:21.960 --> 2:37:25.880]  i wanted to just show this for you back to calls i saw this fellow on twitter you know i hate to
[2:37:25.880 --> 2:37:29.720]  even promote people and talk about who they are because i'm the big brother watches and goes and
[2:37:30.360 --> 2:37:38.840]  basically wax whoever we show but whatever uh anthony wrote this on twitter 75 dollars weren't
[2:37:38.840 --> 2:37:44.840]  the patriot points well spent that means they got the patriot points from 75 dollars uh bought all
[2:37:44.840 --> 2:37:48.600]  these bumper stickers that we try to sell at cost i think that's the big sticker bomb pack i think
[2:37:48.600 --> 2:37:53.560]  that's like 995 but uh the point is is that you want to do a statement for freedom you want to
[2:37:53.560 --> 2:37:58.360]  override the matrix you want to absolutely let people know the power of info wars get the stickers
[2:37:58.360 --> 2:38:04.600]  at info wars store dot com i know we sell them at cost and put them up everywhere it has a giant
[2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:09.720]  effect so there's a lot of different sticker packages they're all sold at cost in every order
[2:38:09.720 --> 2:38:15.480]  get some of the bumper stickers thrown in as well i'm going to stop talking at that point about that
[2:38:15.480 --> 2:38:20.840]  because gerald salante is coming up and i want to get to all the callers that are holding because
[2:38:20.840 --> 2:38:30.280]  before gerald takes over i want to show people something little buddies wait till you see what's
[2:38:30.280 --> 2:38:35.960]  on the back i'm going to hit that start of the next hour and play a clip of an angry father
[2:38:35.960 --> 2:38:42.120]  talking about the mind control this is mk ultra goes mainstream coming up but right now let's
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:52.360]  go back to your phone calls let's talk to rc in texas about what do we do about tyranny rc tell
[2:38:52.360 --> 2:38:59.160]  me yeah it's rc christian to you alex uh i thought i'd drop in and let you know that the plan is
[2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:05.080]  going to swimmingly you know i'm the guy that paid for the uh georgia guide stone and uh the first
[2:39:05.080 --> 2:39:11.320]  commandment the georgia guide stones of course for those that don't know is to maintain humanity at
[2:39:11.320 --> 2:39:15.320]  a population of 500 million or less and perpetual balance with nature so i'd say things are going
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:21.000]  pretty good that's right the great plan to depopulate planet earth has begun my friend
[2:39:22.440 --> 2:39:27.480]  and uh you know according to my name say christian i am a christian and i believe that it's actually
[2:39:27.480 --> 2:39:31.960]  the duty of christians to go along with this plan after all the bible says to obey the powers to be
[2:39:31.960 --> 2:39:37.960]  and if powers to be say you know time to die then uh i'm doing my god i'm doing god my christian
[2:39:37.960 --> 2:39:43.560]  duty to just lay down my life for this thing don't you think yeah well people haven't read all of
[2:39:43.560 --> 2:39:48.840]  roman's 13 hitler's favorite quote uh and you know christ is saying when the Pharisees are
[2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:55.000]  trying to set him up oh whose coin is this and and and the basic is that's that's seizures his
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:40:01.640]  face is on it render unto Caesar what is seizures but under god the things that are god so if you're
[2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:05.160]  in the new world order system and you're taking their microchip and you're going along with them
[2:40:05.160 --> 2:40:10.200]  you have opted into their tyranny that's why it crosses the rubicon when they try to force
[2:40:10.200 --> 2:40:15.480]  everybody with this stuff but uh it is our job to resist tyranny that's what all the prophets did
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:20.120]  it's what christ did and so those that say in these fake churches that we submit to tyranny
[2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:27.160]  are not christians but they are demons in the pulpits there to deceive the god's people
[2:40:27.160 --> 2:40:34.040]  well i mean jesus and jesus himself said if your enemy hits you on the one cheek you gotta give
[2:40:34.040 --> 2:40:39.640]  him the other cheek i mean come on and again that is that that is out of that is out of context
[2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:46.040]  as well again but i also he said go out and buy a sword to protect yourself but here's the bottom
[2:40:46.040 --> 2:40:52.680]  line i know you're being sarcastic and i appreciate your call rc uh let's that's the the trust name
[2:40:52.680 --> 2:40:57.000]  that paid for the gorgeous georgia guide stones we did a report on that that's at bandot video just go
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:41:02.600]  there and search georgia guide stones just right there uh let's go ahead and take another call
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:10.120]  let's go ahead and talk to clem in colorado go ahead uh greetings alex thanks for taking my call
[2:41:10.120 --> 2:41:15.160]  yes sir uh i wanted to share with you some very important information um everything i'm about
[2:41:15.160 --> 2:41:21.160]  to share with you you can you know corroborate but um christ thomas and dav morgan back in 2011
[2:41:21.160 --> 2:41:26.440]  published a book called project human extinction and in that book they talked about this off-world
[2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:34.040]  race known as the v-lon uh that came in earth 300 years ago to basically take over so they basically
[2:41:34.040 --> 2:41:39.640]  took over the illuminati because their aims basically paralleled each other but the reason
[2:41:39.640 --> 2:41:45.480]  why they want to take out humans is because 99.9 percent of humans go origin comes from the non
[2:41:45.480 --> 2:41:50.600]  physical races search for lack of better terms they're known as angels so every human on earth
[2:41:50.600 --> 2:41:56.760]  is basically a fallen angel and we've had this plan known as the human plan which i hear you
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:42:01.240]  talked about a lot on your show that the reason why they're trying to throw off and kill a humanity
[2:42:01.240 --> 2:42:06.920]  is because of the potential that humanity has now i can send you these books this information if you
[2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:11.240]  just give me an email or whoever you need but i feel like it was extremely important to get this
[2:42:11.240 --> 2:42:16.600]  information out there but well i mean clem stay there i want to hear about this when you come back
[2:42:16.600 --> 2:42:21.080]  all i know is the globalists say humans are bad knobs to leave they say they're gonna merge the
[2:42:21.080 --> 2:42:26.040]  machines become a new species they're creating thousands of that we know of of alien species
[2:42:26.040 --> 2:42:30.680]  that ever existed not just for mixing plants and animals and insects but actually computers
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:36.040]  making with dna and rna new things that are they're turning loose so they're not trying to save the
[2:42:36.040 --> 2:42:42.920]  earth they're trying to override it and then out of though use us like an embryo and a chicken egg to
[2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:50.600]  absorb that energy to then build this new thing they're constructing so yeah it's satanic as hell
[2:42:50.600 --> 2:42:52.680]  so i want to hear what you have to say on the other side stay with us
