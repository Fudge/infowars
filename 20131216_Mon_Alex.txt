[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.880]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:30.480]  well i'm looking at the drudge report drudge report dot com headlines terror scare at
[00:30.480 --> 00:37.680]  harvard during finals meanwhile confidential obama care navigator training manual uploaded
[00:37.680 --> 00:43.120]  online this just went up seconds ago it refreshed and was there red linked i'm going to print

[00:47.000 --> 00:54.600]  over a hundred stories i want to get to and then now the navigator manual has been leaked
[00:56.200 --> 01:00.840]  and it's up at capital city project by the way these navigators they've been hiring known
[01:00.840 --> 01:07.800]  criminal groups they've been hiring known groups involved with all sorts of mafia ties and people
[01:07.800 --> 01:11.640]  that have been indicted for stealing millions and and they're getting your social security numbers
[01:11.640 --> 01:19.000]  everything now it's being reported by k g w as we got to yesterday that people are trying to go
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.720]  sign up for these things and getting their bank accounts debit well of course that is getting
[01:23.720 --> 01:29.160]  all your private data it's designed to be a giant screw job to see if they can get away with it
[01:29.160 --> 01:35.320]  oh it's a mistake oh i conch on the head oh you know a guy walks in you're in bed with his wife
[01:35.320 --> 01:40.840]  and you go it's a mistake i just fell into bed with your wife and all of this is a horrible
[01:40.840 --> 01:46.920]  accident today also coming up school bans display of christmas poster kids are supposed to paint
[01:46.920 --> 01:51.960]  their own poster it's your individual poster as long as it's not obscene that's your first amendment
[01:51.960 --> 01:56.200]  the school if it's a government training camp under their interpretation of separation in church
[01:56.200 --> 02:00.120]  of state isn't supposed to endorse an official religion because you're not supposed to have a
[02:00.120 --> 02:06.200]  state-run religion but you can bring a bible to school you can tell people out at the playground
[02:06.200 --> 02:12.760]  that you love jesus christ or that you love worshiping you know chinese food if you want i mean it's
[02:12.760 --> 02:17.640]  just what that that that you hate christmas you love christmas it's your first amendment this
[02:17.640 --> 02:25.000]  political correctness is about banning any free speech any personal views so that is a big deal
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.040]  school bans display of christmas poster by student because it might be religious and then folks don't
[02:32.040 --> 02:40.600]  even get that it's first amendment it has nothing to do with whether it's religious or not schools
[02:40.600 --> 02:48.520]  are trying to tell people they can't wear crosses around there next and look at it it's it's actually
[02:48.520 --> 02:55.480]  not even really christian it says merry christmas and then it's got that night before christmas
[02:55.480 --> 02:58.280]  who's the guy that puts out all those kids horror movies
[02:58.280 --> 03:05.160]  tim burton it's got the tim burton christmas skeleton on it so this kid's probably not even a
[03:05.160 --> 03:11.560]  christian and that's not even allowed even though they'll show movies like that at the school it's
[03:11.560 --> 03:16.440]  only when you individually do something it's not allowed when the state does it it's all allowed
[03:16.440 --> 03:21.320]  the state can be armed you can't be armed the state has its speech to demonize the founders
[03:21.320 --> 03:26.680]  but you don't have any free speech so we're going to be uh getting to all that and we need an article
[03:26.680 --> 03:30.760]  out does this article that steve washington is a great article that details what happened
[03:30.760 --> 03:36.280]  but pointing out that you as an individual in your art class if you're a muslim you can
[03:36.280 --> 03:40.680]  paint a picture of mecca if they say paint whatever you want uh if you're a christian you
[03:40.680 --> 03:45.880]  can paint a picture of a cross uh if your dad's a marine corps captain and they say paint a picture
[03:45.880 --> 03:50.360]  of your parents which is what happened in one case and the honor student painted a picture of his
[03:50.360 --> 03:59.480]  father with an m16 he was arrested there's been several of those cases arrested arrested oh my
[03:59.480 --> 04:04.760]  gosh the image of a gun we're arresting you kids have nerf guns in their own backyards they get
[04:04.760 --> 04:11.480]  arrested and then of course here's the big story that's up on info wars dot com boston bomber
[04:11.480 --> 04:19.240]  believed he was a victim of mind control that should probably be red linked that should probably be
[04:19.240 --> 04:23.880]  red linked folks that is so bombshell and and and watson's got a little bit of this in his article
[04:23.880 --> 04:27.720]  but he kind of goes with the news angle where he just reports the latest thing we should probably
[04:27.720 --> 04:32.920]  add to the story i'm gonna try to twist watson's arm to come on at the bottom of the hour tamerlin
[04:32.920 --> 04:40.120]  zharnov on record was in a state department cia sponsored program being sent to chechnya and the
[04:40.120 --> 04:44.360]  fbi had him under close surveillance then they said they never heard of him remember that lie
[04:44.360 --> 04:50.120]  folks he was clearly a double agent bare minimum and now he says he was mind controlled and he is
[04:50.120 --> 04:55.960]  the exact type of candidate disappears for months on a government junket that's when they do it to
[04:55.960 --> 05:03.880]  you i mean this this is incredible the facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other

[08:31.400 --> 08:35.080]  the wicked flea when none pursues so the good book says
[08:38.200 --> 08:44.120]  we are live ladies and gentlemen and broadcasting worldwide there is total hysteria and fear and
[08:44.120 --> 08:52.840]  classes shut down at harvard over a suspicious package or report of explosives and they are
[08:53.800 --> 08:59.320]  again using this to make this the top story to project the idea that there's an epidemic of
[08:59.320 --> 09:07.400]  bombings and terror in this country and of course the truth is you have a better chance of being
[09:07.400 --> 09:12.120]  killed by a deer jumping out in front of your car being stung by a wasp or being bit by a water
[09:12.120 --> 09:17.080]  moccasin and dying water moccasin skill hundreds every year so the honeybees then you do being
[09:17.080 --> 09:23.960]  killed by a terrorista and then most of these events turn out to be mentally ill even the
[09:23.960 --> 09:31.480]  new york times admits that literally 99 of the several hundred foiled bomb plots turn out to
[09:31.480 --> 09:40.760]  be fbi finding people with 70 75 80 iqs low-grade morons who are also mentally ill and winding
[09:40.760 --> 09:47.560]  them up black nationals white nationals muslim extremists whatever the case is winding them up
[09:47.560 --> 09:52.840]  commanding them being their leader recruiting them introducing the idea to them folks i could go
[09:52.840 --> 09:58.760]  hypothetically right now but i wouldn't do a report like this because they could spin it and
[09:58.760 --> 10:02.600]  say that i was actually planning a terror attack but i could go out and find schizophrenic homeless
[10:02.600 --> 10:10.040]  people in austin right now right now and offer them ten thousand dollars to talk about how they're
[10:10.040 --> 10:15.560]  going to blow up a federal building or something and then i could have them meet me the next day
[10:15.560 --> 10:22.920]  there to drive a van to it filled with uh chocolate cakes or something guaranteed it's that easy
[10:24.200 --> 10:27.800]  i might check with lawyers and even call the fbi and tell them i'm going to do it just so it's all
[10:27.800 --> 10:32.760]  on record so they don't claim i'm doing something just to have them stop doing this and of course
[10:32.760 --> 10:40.680]  the argument here is that they're doing this to to foil attacks well if somebody saw their neighbor
[10:40.680 --> 10:44.120]  talking about blowing something up and then saw them doing something in their garage it looked
[10:44.120 --> 10:48.280]  like explosives with barrels or something that's probable cause swat team and find out what's going
[10:48.280 --> 10:53.160]  on or if somebody really was shooting their mouth off about i want to kill people and blow stuff up
[10:53.160 --> 10:57.720]  and then the fbi came to them and said yeah we ought to do that and then gave them a bomb that
[10:57.720 --> 11:07.720]  would still be kind of entrapment but it might be legal in in some arguments i get um you know the
[11:07.720 --> 11:10.520]  fact that if you think somebody's already doing something bring it up to them to see what they're
[11:10.520 --> 11:17.400]  up to that's a classic police tactic for thousands of years but it's not legal or lawful to go out
[11:17.400 --> 11:25.480]  and find mentally ill people and do this so it's particularly disgusting and shameful
[11:25.480 --> 11:32.120]  to have this going on and the truth is it's come out now that the majority the vast majority
[11:32.840 --> 11:39.000]  of these plots turn out to be staged and this is how they absolutely hype the living
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.440]  daylights out of it look at the headlines on drudgereport.com right now terror scare at
[11:44.440 --> 11:51.320]  harvard during finals and then under it confidential obama care navigator training manual uploaded
[11:51.320 --> 11:56.920]  online that just went live minutes ago we're going to cover that separately under it our info wars.com
[11:56.920 --> 12:05.960]  story boston bomber believed he was victim of mind control ladies and gentlemen this just went from
[12:06.840 --> 12:13.480]  absolutely evidence that this was a staged event overwhelming evidence with the drills
[12:13.480 --> 12:18.600]  and the stand downs and the older brother being on the cia payroll well that came out in the foreign
[12:18.600 --> 12:24.760]  press british russian it was confirmed he had a fake name the russian embassy said does this guy is
[12:24.760 --> 12:30.440]  this guy a spy they did this three years ago two years before the bombing they said is this guy a
[12:30.440 --> 12:35.880]  spy for you because you let him fly with a fake name and he's going to chechnya and hanging out
[12:35.880 --> 12:41.640]  with rebels and we know you run those rebels on record our government and nato run the al-qaeda
[12:41.640 --> 12:49.640]  forces in the Balkans and into the southern belly of russia into the caucuses that's all on record
[12:49.640 --> 12:57.800]  a few months ago the head of saudi intelligence bandar threatened publicly in Moscow at a meeting
[12:57.800 --> 13:02.040]  and said we will trigger al-qaeda to blow up the olympics if you don't back off into a peace deal
[13:02.040 --> 13:09.480]  in syria that's how dumb they think westerners are is that the saudi's can publicly threaten
[13:09.480 --> 13:17.400]  to activate al-qaeda forces against the russians and send in people like tamerlan zharnov we don't
[13:17.400 --> 13:23.320]  know if he was a triple crosser double crosser double agent triple agents set up not set up
[13:23.320 --> 13:29.480]  all we know is there was a drill of bombs going off at the finish line and that's been confirmed
[13:30.280 --> 13:35.640]  all we know is there was a stand down all we know is the fbi lied and said we don't know who
[13:35.640 --> 13:41.000]  tamerlan zharnov is when it turns out he was being handled by them surveilled by them followed in
[13:41.000 --> 13:47.880]  with the whole community in florida and in georgia and in new york and new jersey and in boston
[13:47.880 --> 13:54.600]  massachusetts he was all over the country with playboy glasses on an expensive thousand dollar
[13:54.600 --> 14:03.320]  jackets on driving brand new Mercedes benzes without a job being playboys being playboys
[14:03.320 --> 14:10.120]  obviously some type of intelligence asset and then he told friends the boston glove now reports
[14:11.400 --> 14:16.600]  he told friends i'm under mind control folks it's not like he's a schizophrenic on the street
[14:16.600 --> 14:23.880]  corner saying this this guy fits the the the look the the musculature a guy that thinks he's a commando
[14:23.880 --> 14:31.480]  a kickboxer they recruit him a narcissism the whole nine yards for a decoy candidate for a
[14:31.480 --> 14:37.160]  born supremacy born legacy type program and by the way those programs are declassified
[14:37.160 --> 14:43.080]  the earlier programs they had total mind control power by the 70s when they had the church hearings
[14:43.080 --> 14:50.840]  and others total mind control if they picked the right type of candidate other people will run off
[14:50.840 --> 14:57.080]  go crazy or kill themselves if they have a higher high moral fiber and are not narcissist but with
[14:57.080 --> 15:01.720]  narcissists and those that are mentally ill they can break up their personalities with electro shock
[15:01.720 --> 15:05.400]  drugs all the rest of it this is a complex area there's a lot of different sciences that go into
[15:05.400 --> 15:11.640]  it i'm just a lay researcher of it they are able to to absolutely imprint them
[15:13.800 --> 15:18.680]  with the program that they're basically a movie star doing this and they feel so happy and so
[15:18.680 --> 15:23.720]  excited when they carry out the terror attack just like in the remake of the manchurian candidate
[15:23.720 --> 15:29.240]  with denzel washington excellent film you'll know mind control that's how they do it and when he
[15:29.240 --> 15:36.200]  gets the keywords he smiles feels great and is a movie star and it's the same deal with this
[15:36.200 --> 15:41.320]  hypnotism that they do under drugs electro shock and that's old technology folks the stuff they've
[15:41.320 --> 15:46.760]  got now is viruses they inject that literally attack areas of the brain so you don't have inhibition
[15:46.760 --> 15:52.280]  then they give them amnesics to wipe that then they give them an amnesic again to trigger the
[15:52.280 --> 15:58.840]  operation sir hands sir hand it came out the police reports was under mind control given a proto
[15:58.840 --> 16:07.080]  halcyon type drug that's the patsy shooter of rfk who was the cover guy for robert f kennedy
[16:08.040 --> 16:11.960]  and then they had a known cia agent behind him the police even on record so that's where the
[16:11.960 --> 16:17.800]  shots came from that shot him in the back look it up folks it's all on record it's actually all come
[16:17.800 --> 16:27.400]  out that's what's so frustrating about all this theodore kazinsky the unabomber was in mk ultra
[16:27.400 --> 16:34.200]  la times look it up alexander cockburn award-winning journalist broke that the documents were leaked
[16:34.200 --> 16:40.360]  and then declassified fully the fact that he was in the program he was in the program for a decade
[16:40.360 --> 16:49.000]  as a student graduate student and then adjunct kazinsky total cutout setup who else said he
[16:49.000 --> 16:56.440]  was under mind control homes ladies and gentlemen the so-called batman shooter didn't know who he
[16:56.440 --> 17:01.880]  was when the swat team showed up clearly drug put next to cells saying flipping out on drugs for
[17:01.880 --> 17:08.840]  two days saying i'm under mind control help me help me they did it he checked himself in his dad top
[17:08.840 --> 17:17.080]  algorithm scientist in the government private corporations he he he goes into an advanced DARPA
[17:20.040 --> 17:26.040]  above air force level program run by the air force but space command mind control astronaut brain
[17:26.040 --> 17:32.440]  interface where the astronauts think and it controls the the the suits he goes into an
[17:32.440 --> 17:39.640]  advanced brain machine mind control interface this is on record has an air force kernel
[17:39.640 --> 17:48.360]  over him he's full-time paid in a national top secret security level program and goes from
[17:48.360 --> 17:53.960]  being a kid genius to having red hair and going and shooting people even though they reported
[17:53.960 --> 18:00.040]  multiple shooters smoke all of it people announcing stay in your chairs everything safe it was totally
[18:00.040 --> 18:04.840]  rigged and he's out in the parking lot drooling and then when it came out that all these people
[18:04.840 --> 18:07.800]  came out of the jail and said he was standing was under mind control he was screaming and they
[18:07.800 --> 18:12.680]  took him away that the police came out and said we're sealing all that but he was always in
[18:12.680 --> 18:16.680]  solitary around no one he was never in a general area where anyone could hear him even though he'd
[18:16.680 --> 18:21.320]  been in the paper earlier that they talked to the police who weren't part of it the jail guards
[18:21.320 --> 18:26.360]  said yeah he was screaming he was yelling saying he was under mind control it's not like it's only
[18:26.360 --> 18:35.960]  happening a few places here tamerlin zarnath was in a georgetown state department cia program
[18:36.760 --> 18:43.960]  on record undoubtedly and the media here will not touch it he's flying by fake names would you
[18:43.960 --> 18:51.640]  like me to continue folks would you like me to continue going down the line ladies and gentlemen
[18:51.640 --> 18:57.640]  you could take one look at adam lanza and all his government connections and his family and one

[24:08.200 --> 24:12.280]  well folks last week russian government officially threatened to
[24:12.280 --> 24:20.760]  newk western europe and the united states if offensive missiles are moved into their areas
[24:20.760 --> 24:24.360]  meant to be able to shoot down their response to a preemptive nuclear attack
[24:25.640 --> 24:31.000]  official u.s policy under the new world order has changed in the last decade to preemptive
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.240]  strikes telling russia and china we may decide to attack you with nuclear weapons at any time
[24:37.240 --> 24:42.280]  so russia and china and i'm not romanticizing them their other big predatory power blocks
[24:42.840 --> 24:45.880]  they said okay we reserve the right to nuke you first as well
[24:47.560 --> 24:52.600]  and so their deputy prime minister came out officially and said we will respond with nukes
[24:52.600 --> 24:59.480]  that is a quote now it is being reported that russia is moving missiles into its western region
[24:59.480 --> 25:08.200]  bordering poland and other nations the exact missiles the iskander missile system is being moved
[25:08.200 --> 25:15.720]  in russia has deployed the missiles with a range of hundreds of kilometers in the Baltic sea enclave
[25:15.720 --> 25:21.480]  of kolonengrad which borders nato members poland with a wania the newspapers are reporting today
[25:22.680 --> 25:27.000]  the paper reports came after german newspaper billed reported on saturday
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.200]  the secret satellite imagery showed the iskander m missiles stationed near the polis border
[25:33.240 --> 25:38.200]  the reports caused alarm in the Baltic states which are wary of russian military movements
[25:38.200 --> 25:44.760]  after decades of dominance by the soviet union well why i mean the west is moving missiles in
[25:44.760 --> 25:51.000]  to the russian border why why should you be alarmed why should we be alarmed about giant
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.800]  war tanks and armored vehicles and bullets and training manuals that it's for the american people
[25:55.800 --> 26:00.040]  are being masked all around us why should we be alarmed they're putting in an nsa surveillance
[26:00.040 --> 26:04.040]  grid and spying on us illegally and putting fluoride in the water and bisphenol a in the
[26:04.040 --> 26:08.760]  plastic and admitting it's to dumb us down and sterilize us why should we be concerned about
[26:08.760 --> 26:12.280]  the big banks saying they'll just take our bank accounts or take our private and public pension
[26:12.280 --> 26:16.440]  funds or why should we be be worried about the federal reserve devaluing the dollar
[26:16.440 --> 26:23.240]  and gearing up for total war with us i mean never mind these anti-missile missiles and
[26:23.240 --> 26:29.720]  anti-personnel missiles and missiles that can carry nuclear warheads medium range and short range
[26:29.720 --> 26:35.560]  strategic nuclear weapons big deal what's the big deal it's kind of like in caddyshack where
[26:36.120 --> 26:45.560]  bill murray's dropping the plastic explosive gophers and squirrels and rabbits he's like
[26:45.560 --> 26:50.840]  nothing to worry about mr gopher just your friends squirrel no explosive or anything
[26:50.840 --> 26:58.600]  i i mean this is what's going on as we're all being surrounded by tyranny and and look i don't
[26:58.600 --> 27:03.240]  live in russia i don't live in china i don't like their tyrannies but they're not offensive
[27:03.240 --> 27:08.440]  tyrannies like our government is because our government's been captured by the globalist
[27:09.240 --> 27:14.520]  and is absolutely savaging our basic freedoms and needs to be put back on a leash it's like
[27:14.520 --> 27:22.280]  napoleon or hitler or gingis kahn or julius seizer involved in these offensive operations that we
[27:22.280 --> 27:29.160]  pay for that don't even benefit us and that endanger the entire world so a bunch of crazy
[27:29.160 --> 27:34.680]  globalist bankers can make the planet accept their global cashless society and so they can
[27:34.680 --> 27:41.400]  take over the planet everybody wants to rule the world the song says well i don't i just want to
[27:41.400 --> 27:47.800]  have a future and i am sick and tired of these globalists and i know you're sick and tired of
[27:47.800 --> 27:55.400]  them as well and i hope that cooler heads prevail but this is very very worrisome poland is freaking
[27:55.400 --> 28:01.720]  out reuters is reporting poland is worried about the possibility that russia has deployed the
[28:01.720 --> 28:06.520]  missiles to the baltic enclave of kaliningrad and will consult its nato partners on the issue
[28:06.520 --> 28:12.600]  the foreign ministry said today the plans to deploy the new iskander m rockets to let kaliningrad
[28:12.600 --> 28:16.520]  are worrying the russians said last year they do that if they move missiles in you move missiles
[28:16.520 --> 28:21.240]  up to our border we move missiles up to your border the ministry said the statement commenting on
[28:21.240 --> 28:30.680]  reports in russia a german media said the missiles had been deployed folks imagine if you walked outside
[28:30.680 --> 28:38.040]  and your neighbor was pointing a gun at you for no reason you would call the police but if you
[28:38.040 --> 28:41.320]  lived out in the frontier you couldn't call the police or you're in it's another government
[28:41.320 --> 28:47.400]  they are the police they're pointing a gun at you and so you start saying okay honey kids go
[28:47.400 --> 28:51.480]  out the back door drive out the back don't drive out the front or don't go in the front yard or
[28:51.480 --> 28:55.880]  the backyard wherever the guns aimed at you and you put a gun up aiming out your window at them
[28:55.880 --> 29:01.400]  see it's it's we're losing the moral high ground the globalists run our country now and they're
[29:01.400 --> 29:07.960]  moving missiles in and pointing them at the russians so that when cruise missiles or bombers
[29:07.960 --> 29:13.080]  or icbms come in the russians can't fire their anti-missile systems at them
[29:14.840 --> 29:19.800]  and the russians can't get their missiles in a counter response back they're being moved into check
[29:20.520 --> 29:23.960]  and then checkmate and so the russians are saying okay well we're gonna move
[29:23.960 --> 29:28.280]  you know russians don't want to play chess folks most of the world champions come out of russia
[29:28.280 --> 29:32.200]  they they go i mean this is like checkers though you move missiles up to us we move
[29:32.200 --> 29:37.480]  missiles up to you why did the russians try to put missiles in cuba because the west put
[29:37.480 --> 29:44.680]  nuclear missiles in turkey it's the same deal so that's what's going on here ladies and gentlemen
[29:44.680 --> 29:51.800]  we'll be back with paul watson and the latest on the boston bomber we're on the march the empires

[32:58.120 --> 33:08.120]  at info wars life dot com
[33:16.760 --> 33:25.480]  live from austin texas it's alex jones by the way i haven't even gotten to this article yet
[33:25.480 --> 33:28.680]  i'm going to cover it after paul watson leaves us then we're going to open the phones up and cover
[33:28.680 --> 33:35.960]  news to balance the transmission documents reveal states move to vastly expand the continuity of
[33:35.960 --> 33:42.920]  government powers that's a mccail phalan report upon info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[33:43.560 --> 33:51.000]  originally originating at story leak dot com and this document out of washington state
[33:51.000 --> 33:58.600]  state talks about warfare with the american people and says washington military department
[33:59.400 --> 34:04.040]  the state has a military department modernizing states continuity of operation planning
[34:05.320 --> 34:12.200]  and again it always has the cover of emergencies and this is a inside document but the larger
[34:12.200 --> 34:18.360]  issue in all this is is that they want to amend the state constitution to basically suspend rights
[34:18.360 --> 34:23.560]  so it's the phasing in a martial law and i have great writers great researchers the problem is they
[34:23.560 --> 34:30.360]  tend to not even go all the way when something's really happening because it's almost journalistic
[34:30.360 --> 34:37.480]  to hold back but the only way you can name this the only way you can accurately say what it is is
[34:38.680 --> 34:47.960]  is state moves to repeal due process or state moves towards martial law permanent martial law
[34:47.960 --> 34:53.880]  i mean that's what it is they want to get rid of due process during c o g well there's already
[34:53.880 --> 34:59.480]  plans in place if there was a real c o g issue like a nuclear attacker a volcano going off this
[34:59.480 --> 35:07.400]  is the opposite folks this is all about political control and it's happening not just here but in
[35:07.400 --> 35:14.360]  japan and in russia and in china and in england and in germany and all over south africa and all
[35:14.360 --> 35:21.400]  over latin america governments everywhere have made conscious decisions to move towards authoritarianism
[35:23.720 --> 35:28.440]  and there's battles now for the undersea floor and minerals there's battles for the north pole
[35:28.440 --> 35:33.400]  in the south pole now politically as governments line up and declare they own them uh there's
[35:33.400 --> 35:39.800]  battles with china declaring the moon is theirs and and this is the same type of stuff you see
[35:39.800 --> 35:46.360]  with the south china c five swing china and between uh japan and now south korea all of
[35:46.360 --> 35:52.920]  this is heating up because you have global devaluation of currencies all the major governments
[35:52.920 --> 36:01.000]  whether it's the yan or whether it's the yin or whether it is the russian currency or the euro
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.920]  currency or the dollar they're all set to dollars worldwide and and so they're all racing each other
[36:06.920 --> 36:12.120]  on who can inflate the currencies the fastest and when the musical chair stops and the hangar
[36:12.120 --> 36:17.640]  nade that's being passed around blows up it's going to cause a chain reaction and i don't know
[36:17.640 --> 36:22.760]  how bad it's going to be i don't know exactly what's going to happen because they've got computers
[36:22.760 --> 36:28.920]  gaming and all and over the horizon future predicting mass models where they can have a
[36:28.920 --> 36:37.240]  controlled implosion and the system can guide it for themselves the system can can use the
[36:37.240 --> 36:43.320]  calamities in their own word words in their own documents to bring in the total tyranny worldwide
[36:43.320 --> 36:52.200]  so i was on ron paul's tv show this morning and he kept hammering the fact that we've got to blame
[36:52.200 --> 36:57.480]  the collectivist the corpus the crony capitalist the insiders for what they've done because they're
[36:57.480 --> 37:03.240]  going to try to bring in total tyranny on the backs of the crises that they've helped engineer
[37:03.800 --> 37:08.680]  don't let a good crisis go to waste in fact engineer the crisis to take over that's the plan
[37:09.560 --> 37:17.320]  and so this is now the fight this is so huge what's going on what's happening and you've got all
[37:17.320 --> 37:22.040]  these different governments lining up for a fight right now and you've got the globalists who are
[37:22.040 --> 37:28.440]  have interests in every country playing us all off against each other and russia moving in nuclear
[37:29.160 --> 37:39.320]  tipped missiles to fast attack europe with these escander missiles that anti-missile defense systems
[37:39.320 --> 37:46.840]  cannot stop according to what they claim so this is what the establishment is doing and they will
[37:46.840 --> 37:51.960]  threaten the whole world and bring us to the brink of thermal nuclear war to basically intimidate
[37:51.960 --> 37:58.280]  different political classes into doing what the new world order wants and the new world order is
[37:58.280 --> 38:03.800]  the Anglo-american establishment that used the west wealth and liberty to build the greatest
[38:03.800 --> 38:08.520]  tyranny because liberty builds wealth and they skimmed off the wealth of liberty to build a
[38:08.520 --> 38:12.760]  tyranny now they're getting ready to phase out the engine of liberty that built their empire
[38:13.560 --> 38:18.280]  to secure their dominance over us while they launch out to take over what's left of the world
[38:18.280 --> 38:24.920]  from other criminal predatory groups the russians the chinese power blocks and we are all stuck in
[38:24.920 --> 38:29.640]  the middle of this and whether you're russian chinese or american or british we're all human
[38:29.640 --> 38:36.440]  beings we all love our children let me ask men a question do you find russian beauties uh particularly
[38:36.440 --> 38:43.720]  beautiful why don't you want to love the russian people instead of kill them russians love american
[38:43.720 --> 38:48.680]  cowboy culture and fast cars and james dean and all the rest of it why don't we be friends with
[38:48.680 --> 38:53.400]  the russians well the globalists don't want us to do that that's why they put the communist in in
[38:53.400 --> 38:58.760]  1917 to make that place 10 times worse they took the czarist evil and put something 10 times worse
[38:58.760 --> 39:07.080]  in i don't support the czarist the white russians that was a tyranny as well just like i don't support
[39:07.080 --> 39:15.240]  apartai but i don't support communism something even more scientifically evil in in place of it
[39:16.200 --> 39:20.200]  so see there's the difference ladies and gentlemen and and we owe russia an apology
[39:20.200 --> 39:24.360]  for letting the robber barons who couldn't capture us completely because we had checks and balances
[39:24.360 --> 39:31.160]  and americans wouldn't put up with it americans had shooting wars with the feds and and and with
[39:31.160 --> 39:35.080]  pinkerton security and all the rest of them out west and all over the country when they tried to
[39:35.080 --> 39:41.320]  enslave us you see that in all these movies like like open range and stuff that's based on basically
[39:41.320 --> 39:47.640]  true stories there were thousands of fights like that so they couldn't dominate us but there was
[39:47.640 --> 39:53.400]  already a centralized empire in russia there was already a centralized tyranny ready to fall over
[39:53.960 --> 39:59.320]  rotting and so they came over and put commies in and that's what they do they use the depression
[39:59.320 --> 40:05.240]  in russia to put communists in they use the collapsing china after a six-year war with the
[40:05.240 --> 40:10.120]  japanese it was going on before world war two even started to come in and then put malsey tongue
[40:10.120 --> 40:15.320]  we owe the chinese people an absolute apology for letting the robber barons use us as a base
[40:15.880 --> 40:22.360]  use our tax money our troops our intelligence to bring down russia to bring down china and set in
[40:22.360 --> 40:29.720]  its place horrible demonic goblin-like governments who would make deals with them i mean unbelievable
[40:29.720 --> 40:45.480]  unbelievable evil evil evil evil evil evil evil and that's the truth of the world folks
[40:45.480 --> 40:50.680]  that's the real geopolitical setup right now they don't want mainline secular muslims
[40:50.680 --> 40:56.520]  secular government in the middle east they want al-qaeda chopping women's private parts off
[40:56.520 --> 41:01.240]  running around blowing stuff up pulling down monuments burning up libraries
[41:02.600 --> 41:06.680]  and that's what they're gonna put they want degradation they want collapse well they sit
[41:06.680 --> 41:13.400]  in switzerland and luxembourg and london and new york city and and and in armored redoubts
[41:13.400 --> 41:19.240]  in the bahamas and and in tasmania and in the cook islands the globalists want to sit there
[41:19.240 --> 41:25.080]  while they wreck the world and play us all off against each other i got an idea how about we
[41:25.080 --> 41:30.680]  wake up and say no humanities going to the stars we're working together under true free market
[41:30.680 --> 41:35.960]  we're going to honor and make rock stars scientists and inventors and good fathers and good mothers
[41:35.960 --> 41:40.280]  we're going to build up men we're going to build up women we're going to build up the family we're
[41:40.280 --> 41:45.800]  going to have space colonies we're going to work globally together through national nation states
[41:45.800 --> 41:53.320]  and true diversity but combining together in a 1776 worldwide liberty conference
[41:55.000 --> 42:00.520]  to decide on the goals of the nation states moving forward together it could be held once a year
[42:00.520 --> 42:05.080]  in a great two-week congress for agreed upon goals and then go back to the nation states
[42:05.080 --> 42:12.280]  and see if they agree and unify humanity around goals and around human empowerment the opposite
[42:12.280 --> 42:18.040]  of what they want to unify us under tyranny and evil and degradation and a future without humanity
[42:18.040 --> 42:23.240]  where the elite control the future and merge with machines and believe they're god they have no right
[42:23.240 --> 42:28.680]  to govern our destiny they have no spiritual right they have no moral right they are the last
[42:28.680 --> 42:35.080]  people that should be governing our destiny they are a danger to everyone on this planet and when
[42:35.080 --> 42:41.640]  they've committed crimes they need to be locked up not running society i'm going to go to paul

[44:48.920 --> 44:55.880]  is the top story on info wars dot com and it's also on drudge report dot com in the middle
[44:55.880 --> 45:04.200]  column boston bomber believes he was a victim of mind control boston bomber believes he was a victim
[45:04.200 --> 45:11.240]  of mind control now here is paul watson this is in the boston globe but paul watson gives background
[45:11.240 --> 45:16.840]  the the unabomber was under a cia mind control that came out in the la times uh the the uh
[45:16.840 --> 45:22.200]  supposed aurora shooter said he was under mind control and now it comes out in the boston globe
[45:22.200 --> 45:26.840]  he believed he was under mind control folks he was under a cia funded program to chechnya this
[45:26.840 --> 45:32.360]  is literal born supremacy type stuff this is amazing paul watson thank you for joining us
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.920]  good to be here alex break it down my friend yeah this is the the result of a five month
[45:38.920 --> 45:43.560]  investigation by the boston globe and they basically talked to a whole host of people
[45:43.560 --> 45:49.880]  who intimately knew the zahnev brothers uh one of them donald larking a 67 year old who attended
[45:49.880 --> 45:57.880]  the boston mosque with tamalan zahnev told the boston globe he believed in majestic mind control
[45:57.880 --> 46:02.680]  which is a way of breaking down a person and creating an alternative personality with which
[46:02.680 --> 46:09.160]  they must coexist you can give a signal a phrase or a gesture and bring out the alternate personality
[46:09.160 --> 46:15.240]  and make them do things tamalan thought someone might have done that to him so they're talking about
[46:15.240 --> 46:23.960]  how trigger phrases trigger words trigger images and symbols that make people do violent actions
[46:23.960 --> 46:29.640]  as a result of mind control which as you just mentioned in the case of james holmes the batman
[46:29.640 --> 46:35.800]  shooter he said to an inmate of his that he was quote programmed to carry out the massacre by an
[46:35.800 --> 46:42.600]  evil therapist who brainwashed him with the aid of neuro linguistic programming so again we're
[46:42.600 --> 46:49.000]  talking about trigger phrases used to turn one person to shift from one personality to another
[46:49.000 --> 46:55.080]  that's been created by mind control which is interesting because we know that holmes immediately
[46:55.080 --> 47:01.880]  before the massacre began took a phone call was talking to somebody on the phone then began with
[47:01.880 --> 47:08.040]  the shooting now there was a british programmer television special which aired a few years ago
[47:08.040 --> 47:15.240]  in the uk by quite a famous hypnotist called darren brown and he was able to actually brainwash
[47:15.240 --> 47:21.880]  somebody mind control them to carry out an assassination which the subject thought was real
[47:21.880 --> 47:29.960]  an assassination of a famous person in public and the trigger for carrying out that assassination
[47:29.960 --> 47:35.960]  was a woman dressed in a polka dot a polka dot skirt so when it actually came to the assassination
[47:35.960 --> 47:41.400]  the woman walked in in the polka dot dress and this individual who beforehand was completely
[47:41.400 --> 47:46.440]  calm and normal who thought that he was just attending a theater show pulled out a gun and
[47:46.440 --> 47:51.000]  assassinated in his own mind the shots were obviously blanks but he thought he was really
[47:51.000 --> 47:59.400]  assassinating a public figure so these trigger words these trigger images are proven in mk ultra
[47:59.400 --> 48:06.520]  cia mind control law to actually work and they can actually create these mind control assassins
[48:06.520 --> 48:12.760]  which of course happened in the case of surhan surhan and the assassination of rfk and by the
[48:12.760 --> 48:18.360]  way this is not our opinion now again it came out in the la times you might add this at theodore
[48:18.360 --> 48:25.880]  kasinski on record was in the mk ultra program and so undoubtedly they're bare minimum using it to
[48:25.880 --> 48:30.360]  have them there drugged out of their minds to blame them for things that later happen but to
[48:30.360 --> 48:35.000]  also carry out attacks and because the general public's been mesmerized by television and is
[48:35.000 --> 48:41.240]  generally already in a near sleepwalking haze people say the public's in a haze you can't
[48:41.240 --> 48:45.640]  get through to them because if you watch three four hours of television today you literally go
[48:45.640 --> 48:49.800]  into a zombified state that's why children you can't talk to them if they're watching tv you're
[48:49.800 --> 48:55.640]  like hey don't you hear me their mouths are hanging open the flicker rate is set just like
[48:55.640 --> 49:01.800]  a flashing light to literally put them into that state so the public is so weak-minded now that as
[49:01.800 --> 49:07.960]  you pointed out hypnotist can find highly suggestible people and have them commit assassinations
[49:07.960 --> 49:14.360]  just off hypnotism you add drugs and of course this guy was under a top air force kernel
[49:14.360 --> 49:20.600]  in a brain interface DARPA program now imagine you get put into this you get hypnotized next
[49:20.600 --> 49:27.800]  year drug they sealed his notebook they've declared a national security on that i mean paul
[49:27.800 --> 49:33.160]  there's really no doubt now but again they know the public's so dumb they're hiding this in plain
[49:33.160 --> 49:40.120]  view paul i mean this is unbelievable well i mean talk about hiding it in plain view you remember
[49:40.120 --> 49:45.960]  the guy they arrested during the manhunt for the boston bombers the so-called naked guy who was
[49:45.960 --> 49:51.880]  supposed to be a different person you can see clearly that it's tamal and zahnev they arrested
[49:51.880 --> 49:58.360]  him he was completely unharmed uninjured and then you know a few hours later he died in a police
[49:58.360 --> 50:04.600]  shootout sees autopsy photos he's riddled with bullet holes and i predicted burned and i predicted
[50:04.600 --> 50:08.520]  they try to kill the other brother which they knew was in the boat they shot it and by the grace of
[50:08.520 --> 50:13.400]  god they only hit him a few times he got out then i said oh my gosh they're gonna they're gonna shut
[50:13.400 --> 50:20.440]  him up and then they did but still he's saying he didn't do it he says not guilty and the the friend
[50:20.440 --> 50:25.720]  of the bombers to the chef you know they went held him in his own apartment for five days interrogated
[50:25.720 --> 50:31.880]  him uh and then just shot him in the head claimed he lunged at them with a knife later had to admit
[50:31.880 --> 50:37.560]  that was completely made up and just no explanation just shot him in the head he was an eyewitness to
[50:37.560 --> 50:43.240]  to what went on so this is literally the born legacy this is literally the born legacy
[50:43.240 --> 50:50.360]  this is literal mind control out in the open targeting the dumb down general public
[50:50.360 --> 50:55.400]  they know we know we know the drill we know how they did it we know he was cia the little brother
[50:55.400 --> 51:02.440]  was oh my gosh stay there paul this is so evil ladies and gentlemen what looks good under your

[54:38.040 --> 54:44.120]  to mind control from just advertising down to conditioning down to drugging and it's on record
[54:44.120 --> 54:49.000]  they're drugging most of the u.s. trips now in combat with all sorts of psychotropic speed drugs
[54:49.000 --> 54:55.400]  hallucinogens and not just the amphetamines but the opiates to to to then have them all
[54:55.400 --> 55:01.880]  strung out and screwed up so they can then control them and say oh you want you want pain pills for
[55:01.880 --> 55:07.640]  your depression and then list them as drug addicts and then remove their second amendment
[55:07.640 --> 55:13.000]  once they get out of the military but this is the type of intel that we now have that can turn
[55:13.000 --> 55:17.880]  this around and look the average person in the fbi the average person even in the cia is totally
[55:17.880 --> 55:24.360]  compartmentalized and it's not even a bad person either they don't like what's going on this is
[55:24.360 --> 55:30.120]  really evil what's happening it's a very small group doing this and we have to become aware of it
[55:30.120 --> 55:36.360]  and boldly expose it or we have no future paul watson of prison planet dot com and info wars dot
[55:36.360 --> 55:44.280]  com breaking this down here today we have the other angle of who they're picking for their mind
[55:44.280 --> 55:51.880]  control and it's clear if you go back it's same story with with with the situation at littleton
[55:51.880 --> 55:56.120]  clearly they had a federal mind control program under death education going on there half the
[55:56.120 --> 56:01.560]  school was empty that day there were 247 bombs found in the building cbs news that got covered
[56:01.560 --> 56:05.320]  out they were supposed to kill hundreds they got set up there were other shooters they admit the
[56:05.320 --> 56:11.320]  swat team shot several of the kids rocky mountain news media works to keep mass shooters profile
[56:11.320 --> 56:18.360]  secret the profile is a video game head goth who's into the occult who they then grab and program
[56:18.360 --> 56:23.080]  because they're already unstable and ready separately though or their research students
[56:23.080 --> 56:31.880]  and advanced secret programs uh the unabomber uh the unabomber theodore kasinski uh homes from
[56:31.880 --> 56:41.880]  or uh colorado aurora that's the other mo they get research college students uh zarniv tamerlin
[56:41.880 --> 56:48.840]  zarniv he was in a research program sent by the state department uh out of uh that key command
[56:48.840 --> 56:55.080]  base there in dc georgetown and you've got that in your article so paul this is really amazing
[56:55.080 --> 57:00.600]  they either get drughead uh devil worshipers that already play 10 hours a game 10 hours a day of
[57:00.600 --> 57:05.720]  video games trying to talk fast folks and messing up trying to get to it all here uh who are devil
[57:05.720 --> 57:10.920]  worshipers and already on drugs and are naturally programmed by kind of the ambient brainwashing
[57:10.920 --> 57:17.400]  system or they get people in research programs as their cover paul watson well the question is
[57:17.400 --> 57:22.520]  alex why why do they need to stage all this well it's you know it's for the security state they
[57:22.520 --> 57:28.920]  need these incidents to keep the level of fear mongering high so the general public will accept
[57:28.920 --> 57:33.400]  the kind of security measures that you know companies linked to the military industrial
[57:33.400 --> 57:38.200]  complex make massive profits out of and the government itself gets more power out of if
[57:38.200 --> 57:44.680]  there weren't these kind of incidents the their slush fund would be instantly terminated and you
[57:44.680 --> 57:50.280]  know it stretches back all the way to sirhan sirhan because three months before rfk was
[57:50.280 --> 57:56.840]  assassinated he disappeared for three months sirhan sirhan in the hands of this um you know
[57:56.840 --> 58:02.680]  psychologists working for the cia who actually later turned up dead himself in a hotel room of a
[58:02.680 --> 58:08.680]  suspected suicide so the people who are actually doing the brainwashing end up dead as well but
[58:08.680 --> 58:14.680]  then you've got that whole investigation into uh you know the two shooters at the rfk assassination
[58:14.680 --> 58:21.240]  sirhan sirhan being in a mine uh a trance before he pulled the trigger and his lawyers with
[58:21.240 --> 58:27.560]  increasing conviction approving the fact that he was probably the first mind control patsy
[58:27.560 --> 58:32.200]  and as he said it's not always people who go out and do the killings it's it's the need to create
[58:32.200 --> 58:36.920]  patsies so then the actual operation can take place stay there do five more minutes with us and i'm

[59:53.320 --> 59:58.520]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[59:58.520 --> 01:00:12.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:29.240]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:34.360]  yeah here's the daily mail bobby kennedy's assassin still claims he was victim of mind
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:39.720]  control and his gun didn't fire a fatal shot a new appeal after parole is tonight because it claimed
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:44.520]  that the local police port said was different caliber shot rfk in the back and back of the
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:52.280]  neck and head and at the same time his gun got pinned by a bystander when the guy that shot
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:59.880]  rfk in the back was a cia skunks works worker a secret aircraft facility worker
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.920]  and at the same time three famous cia agents were later documented to be in the crowd at the ball
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:14.040]  room right before this happened so obviously they'd killed his brother the president they were
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.160]  going to kill him Watson in the three four minutes we got left in the short segment
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:25.320]  he was seen with the lady in the polka dot dress she gives him a drink obviously of some type of
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.240]  amnesiac he's given his programming cue and he goes and then plays the part of the patsy
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:36.360]  that's where you left off yeah and that's what i was saying with the television show they
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:42.440]  recreated that almost exactly the girl with a polka dot dress she was the trigger for him to
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:48.280]  go and pull the actual trigger and be the patsy for the assassination and then of course the church
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:55.640]  committee and rocker fell commission investigations in 75 were preceded two years beforehand by cia
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:03.800]  director Richard helms ordering the destruction of all files related to mk ultra in 1973 two years
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:08.680]  before these investigations took place so whereas a lot of information about them came out from whistle
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:15.720]  blowers most of the actual physical evidence was destroyed by the cia two years beforehand
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:21.080]  so it's amazing but the other point you made before the break was you know you're in the fbi
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:26.120]  not the lower level fbi aren't involved in this kind of thing that was brought home to me today
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:32.760]  there's a cbs news interview with the nsa they got inside access to the nsa building and they were
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.960]  like this is not going to be a puff piece of course it was a total puff piece but they were asking
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:45.480]  the director of the nsa questions alexander and in one case they asked him a question about snowden
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:51.480]  and he had to turn around and ask somebody in quote the shadowy group of figures behind him
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:57.880]  if it was okay for him to talk about a certain issue relating to snowden so the the director of
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:05.400]  the nsa is having to ask his superiors in the nsa permission to speak about a certain subject on
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:10.920]  cbs news and he's supposed to be the top guy so there are guys above him so again it brings all
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:16.600]  these top guys don't in most cases know anything that's going on i mean that's on record that's how
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:21.560]  the globalists run these operations they just read the teleprompters that's right you've got permanent
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:29.320]  members in the shadow government burrowed in like ticks and yeah but those are the kind
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:33.400]  of guys who are going to be involved in mk ultra and these programs that's why they destroy the
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:40.120]  files before they can be properly investigated but again with jared lee lofner the gunman who shot
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:45.960]  gabby giffords he was obsessed with mind control and then you tie that in with the psychiatric drugs
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:51.800]  which induce violence and you know it's a cocktail for for carnage basically well here's the deal that
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:56.120]  the shoot them up video games and the video game heads get mad at me when i say this i'm not saying
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:01.560]  take away your murder training tools my whole point is his first amendment you've got a right to it i
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:06.440]  have a right they think censorship is disagreeing with them no censorship is stopping you the shoot
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:11.480]  them up games were invented to create instinctive shooting to create killing machines you put devil
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:17.320]  worshiping uh people on serotonin re uptake inhibitors that make you kill people on this
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:23.400]  it makes you a programmed assassin these games were made to program marine corps and army killers
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:28.840]  to instinctively kill then the government takes kids that already fit the profile drug them up
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:35.480]  even more and point them at the target it's very simple and that's why they use them for drone
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:41.240]  pilots as well that's right they recruit their drone pilots out of the pool of video game heads
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:46.600]  just like the last starfighter just like ender's game they had declassified plans before those
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:51.320]  movies and books came out in the 80s that that was what video games were for to have interactive
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:55.720]  giant game grids to pick the people they want for the future and to train the computers the
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:02.360]  computers are all wargaming what you do you won't be needed in the future in the last 50 years iodine
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:08.040]  has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:14.120]  now banned in nations around the world guess what else is an halogen family fluoride ladies and
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:20.040]  gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:26.760]  salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:32.920]  record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously been deficient in

[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:05.400]  everything we just covered in the last hour the fact that the boston globe is now reporting
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:15.080]  that the supposed lead boston bomber tamerlin zharnov believed that he was under mk ultra
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:21.160]  mind control ladies and gentlemen he was under a secret state department program run by the cia
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:27.960]  out of georgetown university to send him to be with chechen rebels in chechnya that is in the
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:39.080]  major british and german newspapers months ago there was a drill of a bombing at the boston
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:43.880]  marathon that was used to have everybody in place in case anybody got caught carrying it out they
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:49.240]  would just say it was part of a drill you had to stand down of the police you had all the people
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:56.840]  with the backpacks you had to cover up this is really incredible when you add to it all the
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:02.200]  other bombers and people and all the other mass shooters who it turns out were in cia programs
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.600]  and this comes out
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.040]  and then literally no one gets in trouble there are no investigations
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:22.760]  remember the fbi lied and said we don't know who tamerlin zharnov was we never heard of him
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:27.640]  turned out i said two years it was actually three years before they were in contact with him in
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:34.600]  meetings with him debriefing him about his trips to chechnya and the family is on record saying that
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:41.880]  he was basically working for the government and then i call the family back the aunt and others
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:47.000]  and they start crying and have basically been threatened yes i'm ready to come on your show
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.480]  call back 20 minutes later my children know they will get them they will smash me they said no i mean
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:59.080]  this is the life i live living in the real world ladies and gentlemen and now the boston globes
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:09.480]  reporting this i'd like to get your take on it 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 then there's stuff like this
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:15.880]  we covered it last week and played part of the tv ad they're running and it's also running in
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:21.080]  england before movies but greenpeace uses depressed santa to claim north pole is melting
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:25.640]  and he's in there with bleaking lights in a basement in a bunker and there's water running
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:30.360]  goes the north pole is melted oh my god it's the end of the world now they have billboards up that
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:39.960]  we have a photo of on info wars dot com greenpeace uses depressed santa to claim north pole is melting
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:46.840]  arctic ice has actually increased 29 percent since last summer and if you scroll down there is a
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:57.480]  no weather nasa satellite showing it from august 27th of last year to august 15 2013 the the ice
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:03.560]  ladies and gentlemen has massively massively increased in fact the thickness is increased
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:10.040]  and they debate whether it's increased 30 something percent or 50 something percent and they argue
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:15.080]  about it all day but let's let's read some of this greenpeace is running ads in major transportation
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.640]  hubs around the world featuring an image of a depressed santa this was record cold temperatures
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:27.320]  in antarctica 138 below zero this is with record cold temperatures across europe across the united
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:32.280]  states greenpeace is running ads in major transportation hubs around the world featuring
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:37.240]  an image of a depressed santa clause alongside the words the north pole is melting you better
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:43.880]  believe it you better believe it that's how dumb they think you are is that they run people under
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:51.480]  cia programs the boston lead bomber suspect the one they tried to kill has said i'm i'm not guilty
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:55.560]  and they are saying national security on what he's saying i know what it's saying my brother was in the
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:13:00.360]  government was set up because we know he was in the government and now he told his friends and
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:06.120]  family i was under mind control that's coming out in the trial the secret trial of his brother
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:10.760]  it's coming out and i can't believe the boston globe actually told the truth about this good
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:17.960]  job boston globe because most people aren't in on this folks we're just ignorant and don't want to
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:23.160]  admit where we're at they're telling you that polar bears can't swim penguins can't swim at the south
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:29.000]  pole polar bears can't swim at the north pole the ice is all melted they'll point cameras at
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.760]  icebergs and say look it all melted they're floating there's always icebergs coming off of
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:39.160]  the spring and summer and fall this is how dumb they think you are i mean look at this if you're
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:43.960]  a radio listener go to info wars.com you can see it the photo above taken at london underground
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:52.120]  station i watson encourages people to donate three pounds or almost six dollars to the charity to
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:58.280]  help save the arctic and get a message from santa however just like father christmas the claim that
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:05.320]  the north pole is melting is a complete myth from the summer of 2012 to 2013 the arctic ice sheet
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:13.560]  increased by an area of five hundred and thirty three thousand square miles a rise of 29 percent
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:19.560]  that is an extremely low estimate nasa's imagery released earlier this year illustrated how at the
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:25.560]  height of summer an ice sheet more than half the size of europe stretched from canada to russia
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:31.560]  the following claims by scientists in 2007 reported by bbc that the arctic ice would be ice free by
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:38.760]  the summer of 2013 have been proven manifest fraud now i want to explain something every year
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:46.280]  in the summer they go by by by next year it'll be entirely melted and they show it in the summer
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:52.680]  not telling you that the arctic has a summer and a winter shrinking ships thousands of years ago up
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:58.440]  in the baltic and you know the vikings could go up where northern russia is during the summer it was
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:06.200]  that summer passage it always in recorded history thoughts they have icebreakers to go into areas
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:13.080]  they can't normally get into it this is literally like people not knowing what planet we're on that's
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:20.520]  how dumb they are they have a mythical santa claus in tv ads and in billboards saying quote
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:31.480]  quote the north pole is melting you'd better believe it greenpeace who said it would be entirely gone
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:40.280]  right now and it is the biggest recorded in more than 50 years because the sun is at the
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:45.160]  low of a hundred year cycle and they're concerned because their data showing it may be the lowest
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:50.040]  output from old sun since we began recording it and they've been recording that for more than
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:16:01.000]  300 years the sun i don't care if the un has a vote and says that the sun does not affect climate
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.440]  that is like saying water does not affect fish that is like saying sunlight is not
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:13.800]  needed for photosynthesis and plants and i mean i just can't believe the propaganda is so dumbed
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:19.640]  down that a mythical character is telling you that the north pole is completely melted and you
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:26.280]  quote better believe it you better just like obama would say period you better believe it i will
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:31.640]  keep this promise you will not lose your doctor your premium will not go up there are no death
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.040]  panels you will lose your premium i mean it will go up you will lose your doctor there are death
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:44.760]  panels and i literally am on twitter and i saw some guy yesterday going you're a racist elix
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:52.440]  in the story was about how the white shooter in colorado was an avowed socialist who went
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:58.920]  into kill conservative members of the debate team and i went looked it was a real twitter account
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:04.200]  it was a real black guy in the marines and he was saying you know you're a racist basically your
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:13.640]  time's coming imagine imagine you oppose a socialist going in with a shotgun to shoot people he
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:18.200]  disagrees with a white person and it's racist i mean no wonder they're telling people that santa
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:25.400]  clause is real and the north pole is going to melt or has melted and he's in a bunker i mean it's
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:35.720]  just they think you are so stupid they think you are so dumb and because they know you're not really
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:45.080]  dumb you buy into something and you then see it as a possession you don't want to admit that you've
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:48.840]  been caught if you're a mainline republican or mainline democrat you don't want to admit their
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:54.280]  corrupt special interest rule in your life i admit it i went out from under them let me tell you

[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:09.640]  of begging to be enslaved and listen here's the issue just because you want to be enslaved and
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.760]  feel intellectually superior and call me racist when i'm the opposite of that
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:19.400]  doesn't mean you get to wreck my life doesn't mean you get to pass force inoculation laws
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:23.720]  they're trying to pass in new york right now well it has passed they're just trying to implement it
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:29.720]  now it doesn't mean i've got to work and pay 60 plus percent of what i produced for you it doesn't
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:34.200]  mean i've got to believe what you believe or worship the gods you want to worship or or or or not

[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:19.960]  let's go to your phone calls bill in michigan you're on the air sir welcome
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:22.840]  Alex Jones
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.440]  you there sir yep
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:36.600]  all right well go ahead sir oh hey i've been listening regularly regularly for several months
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:43.560]  but in case i missed it did you or anybody on your show yet raised the possibility
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:54.440]  to get mind control over all my sheet by means of making us think they're big because relative to
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:25:00.280]  like 100 million fighting age american patriots there's really only a few of them so no no that's
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:06.200]  right that's right that's right using divide and conquer there's only a few thousand globalist tops
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.800]  they run only a few staged events and then the media plays along with it though they're not even
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:16.120]  really part of it and they're able to make us the true liberty movement that's the majority
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:22.200]  feel like we're the minority that is the essence of mind control yeah we get all this media showing
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:31.400]  us you know the tyranny the forms of tyranny the the military army of police forces but
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:37.560]  how many people went and really checked to see you know how really how big they are yet i think
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:45.080]  all this media hype about all this stuff that they do is to make people think they're bigger
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:49.480]  than they really are there's more of them than they really are including the you know the ones
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:57.480]  who are doing the pat downs and grinning and and loving this uh yeah i hear you man i appreciate
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:01.240]  your call good points james in new york james you're on the air go ahead

[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:16.840]  all right greg don't want to talk either he's listening to the radio no no we're going we're
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:21.800]  going let's talk to cult in arkansas or kansas or wherever he's calling from go ahead cult you're
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:26.680]  on the air hi how's it going good sir broadcasting worldwide may i help you
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:32.360]  um well you know i was just uh what to say you know i've been listening to you for a few years now
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:41.160]  but um my nephew was living in virginia and you know he was working at uh one of the gas stations
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:48.520]  there and uh he actually got fired from his job because he told a girl that he wanted to legally
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:56.840]  obtain a gun and um you know concealed carry permit and they said that that was a violent
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:02.680]  violence against absolutely absolutely absolutely yeah look look if you play video games and talk
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:06.200]  about them they kick you out of school if you have a nerf gun in your backyard you're kicked out of
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:11.640]  school there's no law they just do it uh they are creating the perception that oh you drew a christmas
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:17.400]  card at school that showed a christmas tree it's banned because it violates church and state the school
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:24.600]  can't have an official religion but in your speech as valoviktorian or in your christmas cards you
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:29.800]  hand out you can do whatever you want under the first amendment and again this is authoritarianism
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:36.920]  in america people don't know their rights so they're being run all over yes this is the fiat by fiat
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:42.520]  outside of law eradication of all of our rights not just the second amendment they're going after
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:49.560]  all of them oh they did more than fire him the cops ended up picking him up and forcing him to go to
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:56.280]  uh uh psychiatric evaluation for up to two or exactly and then let me guess they then they
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:01.000]  claimed he was mentally ill he can't own guns anymore yeah they removed his right in virginia
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.600]  to own guns so he now moved to kansas so that way they had more black laws on the guns and that was
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:11.320]  because he didn't know his rights he should have laughed when they got there said what are you talking
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:16.520]  about i only said i want to get a concealed carry to protect myself you know if we work at a convenience
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:21.880]  store i want to you guys are acting like i've done something wrong okay go ahead and charge me but he
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:26.840]  got intimidated and went all right all right i'll i'll go to the testing you say and then they go to
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:31.320]  their operative that then declares they have no rights see how that's all rigged and then they
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:37.720]  extra judicially remove your rights through organized crime racketeering fraud these are
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:41.880]  criminal institutions and again the police themselves don't even like what's going on
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:46.120]  but they follow the orders or they lose their job hey cops you're gonna lose everything anyways
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:51.320]  under this but you notice i knew the rest of the story because this is a shaken bank operation and
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:56.600]  the minute you tell the cops you know your rights but actually know them and go just because she was
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:01.080]  upset that i said i had a second amendment and planned to get a concealed carry i'm sorry she's
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:06.360]  a weirdo and but so conditioned to hate somebody talking about public rights uh i guess it's their
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:10.120]  policy not to talk about that i could see why they fired me i think it was wrongful termination
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:14.120]  and the courts would probably agree with me but you know you're not going to take me to jail and
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:18.360]  they take you to jail you go okay i'm not going to resist i'm just going to sue everybody here for
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:22.040]  official oppression and you go before the jury and you call her in what did i say i'm going to get a
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:27.480]  concealed carry you said it i'm scared well that's concealed carry the law in this state jury was i
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:33.240]  falsely imprisoned they release you you're found not guilty now you've got the tort the major lawsuit
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:39.000]  boom let's see the people perish for lack of knowledge i see articles every day where an old
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:44.520]  man cleaning their gun in the country the police come take their guns put them in jail and then
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:48.840]  take their right to own guns because the neighbor saw guns that were legal and didn't like them
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:56.520]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:06.280]  the facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:11.640]  family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the american people so why are the
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:17.720]  social engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:23.000]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.200]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies i am extremely excited to announce the exclusive

[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:15.560]  all thank you all for helping us collectively defend ourselves from the collectivists because
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:22.360]  we are individuals but we must come together collectively to organize and oppose this tyranny
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:31.320]  and here's what i'm going to do 800 259 92 31 i am going to take a ton of phone calls and break
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:37.640]  the the the spell of the fact that i am a horrible talk show host when it comes to taking phone calls
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:41.080]  and there's a big debate on whether i should even take calls or whether i should take more calls
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:45.000]  i like calls i like the news you bring up i like the different angles you take us to
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:50.280]  but randomly some of the callers sound like because it's during the weekday you know in
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:54.920]  their home or whatever on the day off and they're drinking you know a bottle of wild turkey or something
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:36:03.640]  or old crow and so you are barred from calling in if you've had more than half a gallon of whiskey
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:12.120]  only allowed to have one half a gallon before you call in on the show 800 259 92 31 i'm going to give
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:19.240]  each caller a minute i'll give myself a 10 second response oh yeah is this the video of the sanas
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:26.120]  beating each other up that this will get everybody in the mood is the sanas uh beating
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:35.320]  beating each other up yeah i saw that on drudge this country is a complete insane asylum and i
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:42.520]  think i'm a good representation of it all as well oh my goodness oh boy it's absolutely out of control
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:47.000]  if you didn't know the video is up on drudgereport.com that's the kind of video we need on info wars
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:54.040]  dot com is the sanas in fact i said i'd go to your calls but i'm just too intrigued by the sanas
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:59.800]  beating each other's up in new york city that's from right bart video sanas brawl near union
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:04.920]  square a group of men believed to be participating in a sanacon was capturing a video throwing blows
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:11.800]  on the corner of the 17th street and third avenue in manhattan saturday night of the daily news notified
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:20.760]  cops of the video posted on youtube nypd spokesman uh i wonder if it's a hoax folks uh i mean it let me
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:24.840]  see that video again let me see if that looks like it's real to me if you're watching on info
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:38.200]  wars dot com for its last show you can see this i don't know i don't know it kind of looks real
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:43.640]  but they might be good actors the way they're walking away and everything the way this is taking
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:52.200]  place i don't know it looks like it might be real to me unbelievably ridiculous all right
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:56.360]  let's go to your phone calls hey the russians moving nuclear weapons up against europe strategic
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:02.200]  weapons frogs basically uh that's not a big issue threatening the new europe uh the shana clauses
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:07.000]  ladies and gentlemen bad sanas is what i guess you'd call them okay let's go to your calls
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.240]  jim in washington dc thanks for calling in brother good to have you on board today how's it going
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:21.080]  good good sir thank you uh i just want to make you aware that uh i was well it doesn't matter
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:28.920]  about my situation but i was just informed that uh the fbi now is not in not uh wasting any funds
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:33.880]  or investigating crimes under a hundred thousand dollars even though they're the elements that
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:40.120]  have jurisdiction no i know if it's a federal crime the local police tell you no and then the fbi
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:45.480]  tells you no uh and that basically is part of the lawlessness of society and imagine living in new
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:51.000]  york chicago or dc where you can't have guns to protect yourself and then criminals are allowed
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.440]  to run absolutely wild but if you even tell an officer you don't think you were driving the speed
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:02.200]  they said they will taser you or shoot you are worse like at san Antonio the guy said i wasn't
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:07.480]  speeding and the cop pulled a clip out in front of everyone pulled a gun out and emptied the entire
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:13.960]  magazine directly into him so it's death penalty for not groveling the government everything else
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:22.440]  is legal now yeah i mean it's ridiculous and then uh i i called three different fbi bureaus
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:26.840]  they all told me the same thing and seven different agents told me the same thing and one of the
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:32.520]  agents said he would see if he could bend the rules and get someone to investigate it and uh
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:40.360]  it's not a lot of money it's a lot of money to me it was $33,000 but uh to this day the fbi will
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:45.320]  refuse us to investigate even though people better be wise about what they're doing because the general
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:51.640]  public doesn't know how to make money by working or producing they it's swindling it scams it's
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:56.040]  incredible god bless you i appreciate your call i've got to do a whole show on this
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:01.960]  on scams they use with musicians just in austin but i know it's all over the country
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.320]  where they have these lawyers and these record companies that never put anything out
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:10.440]  or have like one person they claim that got a record deal or something and then a record deal
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:15.640]  itself is is is always a scam now the way it's set up to where you could sell five million
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:21.000]  dollars worth of stuff you're going to get like 30 000 if you're lucky and they literally have all
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:27.240]  these musicians that go and spend like 20 30 000 making a record or making a shingle and it's all
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:32.840]  just a scam with lawyers in the back room laughing at everyone and it doesn't matter the people don't
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:37.640]  want to admit they've been scammed or or or conned and they just keep doing it over and over again
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:43.640]  things are so games now in hollywood and music that even big stars a lot of the time don't even
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:49.720]  make money i mean it's all rigged ladies and gentlemen believe me i know and it just shows how
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:57.320]  and it's the gullibility of everybody is what's allowing this look at obama care his idiot supporters
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:02.760]  actually believe it's all an accident let's talk to greg in north carolina greg thanks for calling

[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:15.560]  you first time caller are you familiar with the program started back in the 50s and supposedly
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:26.280]  was halted but i know that it's not called project mk okra whether we use an lsd to cia to brainwash
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:34.040]  people and to try to have them to do their bidding for assembly what they're doing today
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:39.880]  yes sir and they killed captain holson throwing him out the window and mk older came out in the
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:47.000]  70s that have gone on the 50s 60s and 70s mk Naomi there's a bunch of other ones and those programs
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:55.400]  all continue on today publicly in the u.s army mainly they openly drug and brainwash the troops
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:00.280]  now calling it therapy and then they have air force kernels and people you know who literally are
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:05.400]  over the mass shooters publicly and it all comes out no one gets in trouble and the boston globe
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:13.400]  is reporting that the known cia asset tamerlin zharnov uh was saying he was under mk ultra uh
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:21.080]  actually uh one of the monarch type programs is what he said correct in that don't you think
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:26.600]  if they do that we should give our rights up i mean i'm not giving mine up but the government
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:32.120]  will be much nicer to us if we just lay down well i don't know if you remember or not i'm the one
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:40.440]  that contacted you last year in april uh because i had posted some things on on the facebook account
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:46.200]  to save the service came and arrested me uh was afraid i was going to disappear but it all came out
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:51.800]  okay i remember that you know there's a lot of talk show hosts we've had on who mildly criticized the
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:58.840]  lord and savior barack obama as jamie fox calls him not me and uh they come and arrest you put
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:03.080]  you in a psychiatric ward take your guns and so that's how they're persecuting us the same way
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:07.880]  nazi germany started out using psychiatrists in the soviet union as well god bless you gregg good
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:12.520]  to hear from you have a great christmas coming up cobalt in canada and the great white north
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:17.560]  here on the air cobalt how are you doing alex i'm doing good brother good to talk to you how
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:22.600]  may i serve you today drinking a little tangy tangerine the new stuff's fantastic well thank you
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:27.240]  brother what do you make of all the news we covered well i'm calling regarding the colorado
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:32.440]  shooting and the the brainwashing part of it uh he was going after the members of the conservative
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:39.800]  debate team so i'm thinking since oprah said that all these uh racist conservatives had to die he
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:44.920]  probably took it upon himself from her command to go and do this you know that's a good point that
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:52.760]  should be the headline was colorado shooter following oprah's command because it is true i
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:58.360]  would say that i'm oh absolutely but she wouldn't even need a connection i mean she says i'm deeply
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:03.160]  racist and behind the boss and bombing with no proof uh but i think she should look at the other
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:08.040]  angle there was oprah well oprah actually said to disagree with obama you're racist and people
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:13.240]  that are racist need to just die uh but she won't be getting her bodyguards or guns taken any time
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:20.120]  soon but but for those that don't know fill them in on why you're saying that uh i mean give us
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:25.160]  your take it's come out that the shooter was on the debate team and disagree with people on the
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:28.840]  debate team that's in the local news the sheriff say that so he came with a shotgun to try to kill
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:35.000]  the debate coach a librarian and people on the debate team now who would a quote we have the video
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.800]  very proud of being a socialist and the and the paper confirmed that he was listed on the debate
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:46.120]  team as a proud socialist who would a socialist be coming to kill on the debate team well that
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:51.800]  that's the whole thing is that uh you know obama if you if you're against him anyway well you're
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:57.240]  you're racist and you have to die so i'm assuming that this was his angle oprah told him you know
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:03.560]  what these conservatives got to go oh no we went and looked up the debate teams names and stuff and
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:07.880]  there they are conservatives libertarians and they you know one of them did get shot and is alive
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:13.320]  still and i know that probably makes the common core folks angry uh but you know i mean he's a
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:17.640]  socialist who wanted to kill people on the debate team a two plus two equals um he wanted to kill
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:21.720]  libertarians or conservatives or free market people but now under common core two plus two
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:26.760]  equals five and if you don't agree with that you're well racist so cobalt do you want to
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:32.760]  say you're sorry for being racist well not today i think i'll just enjoy some tangy tangerine it
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:38.200]  seems to keep me focused and away from the socialist side of things all right god bless you extremist
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:43.640]  thank you sir oh boy that was really a sicko calling in folks i apologize for that racism let's talk
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:49.560]  to tim in north carolina you're on the air tim hey alex well i'll say thanks for doing what you're
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:54.040]  doing i always said uh as long as you're on the air we have some semblance of the uh first amendment
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:46:00.760]  some semblance of insanity the good type yeah um i was wondering if you caught um it's about a
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:07.560]  couple months old now but um elizabeth woodworth's article about search engine manipulation um
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:12.600]  specifically in regards to the um true seeker episode on rt about nine eleven
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:21.640]  yes if you if you don't have google adsense or other systems on your computer or or or on your
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:27.080]  website they automatically don't list you as high there's been lawsuits over that but also some of
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:33.640]  the other big search engine grips and in advertising grips do that as well uh and there's all sorts of
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:38.120]  search engine manipulation of different news stories uh different items it's it's just fraught
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:43.640]  with it uh but even despite that dinosaur media is flailing around in its death rows
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:51.480]  and real media is seeing a huge rebirth but give us your take on it um yeah i mean i was i was thinking
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:57.880]  they they changed the date on the episode on rt so that looked like it was not from september
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:04.360]  11 of this year but from 2011 um so put it in another spot on their website so that people
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:10.280]  couldn't find it in the search engines um but i also also wanted to ask what you make of uh
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:17.160]  representative steven lynch um trying to get the uh the redacted 28 pages from the 911 report
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:22.360]  uh declassified i think that's really essential we know they lied about what really happened on
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:28.040]  911 we know they didn't know about the supposed attacks uh that we're going to be coming and i
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:33.160]  support transparency i mean the government has used all this secrecy to allow special
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:37.560]  interest to come in and build an empire of fraud and then they tell us like the former nsa director
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:42.680]  did on i think it was meet the press yesterday i saw a clip of it he was going trust us be adult
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:48.760]  let us spy on you so they've gone from we promise we're not spying on youtube we're spying on you
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:54.520]  for your own safety yeah i guess it's it's a matter of like what what will actually work you know
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:59.160]  are these folks that are in congress um actually awake to this or is this you know is this part
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:04.600]  of the show um you know what what power do they have if they can get this stuff declassified you
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:09.160]  know i mean this this in my opinion this event seems like the magic bullet to all this mind
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:13.560]  control stuff no no you're right but but i mean look we have to get behind members of congress
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:17.960]  that tell the truth and stand up for what's right and when they get attacked with a bunch of fake dirt
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:23.240]  we've got to stand behind them because the system does gang up and go after people that tell the
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:28.280]  truth but see we've hit the tipping point where the system's so discredited attacking us with
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:34.760]  lies doesn't work anymore it becomes a red badge of honor or red badge of courage when the system
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:40.120]  attacks us so we need to back people in the republican party libertarian party constitution
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:45.160]  party democratic party if they stand up for transparency and what's right and even if we
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:49.640]  disagree with somebody part of the time when they do the right thing we need to support what they're
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:54.840]  doing god bless you i appreciate your call great questions good caller he was not drinking a gallon

[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:05.800]  war is offensive we're defensively fighting them while exposing the real agenda that's really the
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:10.760]  offense we're trying to get states rights go we're trying to defend the family uh we're trying to get
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:15.320]  healthy uh we're trying to speak to those in the power structure that are compartmentalized to
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:20.120]  decompartmentalize them so they know they're part of something really evil uh what do we do what are
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:27.480]  your ideas okay i totally agree we we we got a good defense already and and you're fighting that and
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:33.880]  my idea is that uh we got to go back to the revolutionary war and our forefathers who fought
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:39.400]  for our country they were undermined controlled too um they had to get away from england and
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:45.320]  they knew they were going to fight england um we were just farmers we were just regular people
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:50.680]  and those british had those fancy uniforms and everything on and they thought they were
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:54.760]  going to come in and they were just going to take over well they had another thing coming
[01:57:55.480 --> 01:58:03.480]  and uh i i just think we need as a as a patriot to collectively get together
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:13.080]  and talk in war rooms or in in homes where there is no tv on there is no no i hear you you should
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:18.280]  be knocking on neighbors doors you should be going to city council you should be organizing your own
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:23.640]  true liberty tea parties in your area and really pointing out this country's been captured and that's
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:28.040]  it but listen everybody's looking for a silver bullet like it's going to happen overnight it's
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:33.400]  a process and we're actually getting momentum now and pushing back and having success so i think
[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:37.960]  the most important thing is to realize we're in the fight things will only be better if we
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:47.320]  stand up third hour coming up this is gcn the genesis communications radio network

[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:44.040]  been a manager and so i'm busy realizing how to manage now that i've got to create absolute
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:49.320]  formulaic systems on everything because i got a great crew and it's getting better every day
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:57.000]  but i run around literally saying we need to order more toilet paper so i've got to get to a point
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.720]  where that's not going on so i can get our tv news up and running at the level it needs to be
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:07.720]  which is close while we're busy you know like it's like a cartoon you got a thousand plates in your
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:11.560]  hand and more plates are getting at it i'm getting the folks where they're taking plates from me
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:16.840]  we're creating a standardized coordinated system uh it's hard to do this and yes we're going to put
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:22.600]  it up in the next month or so on these systems and then and then i've got to decide what free
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:28.360]  to air systems to pay for what's best i'm talking to consultants i'm looking at it obviously they
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:32.680]  don't just let you on everything when you've got this message a lot of it i'm thinking you'll be
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:39.160]  hey we're about to go free to air or we're about to go on these satellites uh we need you to contact
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:44.040]  these people and get us on there but all that's got to be planned right out you know with an actual
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:49.720]  plan yeah i actually have a free to air system so i use it and i tune my satellite dish and i
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:53.960]  pick up all kinds of stuff from all over the world so it'd be something i'd be very interested in
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:04:00.040]  just because i am an info war subscriber but also um to have the access to the uh free to air
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:04.840]  you know broadcast that'd be great yeah no my plan that i've said publicly for like seven years but
[02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:09.640]  i'm always trying to get the capital and running everything else is to build what glenn beck then
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:14.920]  took borrowed from us and built which is fine and he also got it from some other people as well
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:18.920]  but that's clearly the direction the media has been going forever and we've built part of that
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:24.840]  we just don't have hundreds of millions of dollars we have millions of dollars and and and we are
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:30.840]  getting out on more and more platforms but i'm a bad manager at many levels i need to get it where
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:36.200]  i can just coordinate people how they post stuff to youtube you know i can't even do that so uh
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:40.440]  you know i'm doing the best i can but yes or we're going to have free to air i've got to
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:44.120]  choose which satellites are the best and then i'm going to try to get on some of the other
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:49.560]  you know dish network direct tv things like that but it takes money it takes energy it takes
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:57.640]  organization and we're we're almost there to be able to do that but it's it's it's it's playing
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:04.520]  in the big time not pretending alex jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers a prognosis

[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:40.760]  folks we're back live here now into the third hour i'm going to go back to your phone calls but let
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:45.320]  me hit some of the other news we haven't really gotten to yet some of this is some really good
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:52.280]  news some of it's some really bad news boston police halt license plate scanning program
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:57.560]  after the boston globe pointed out that it was being used to track and trace where everyone
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:05.000]  went basically going into nsa style databases i was first telling people 16 17 years ago about
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.920]  license plate scanners that were already up nationwide by the feds and people didn't even
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:13.480]  believe it even when it was admitted just like the black boxes in your cars that track everywhere you
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:17.880]  go and now they want to tax you by the mile so they're telling you hey there's a box in your car
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:22.760]  and again i'm not saying oh i'm so smart look how i warned you look how i told you
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:27.320]  it's very frustrating that on all the other stuff we tell you that's on record like your
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:33.880]  xbox hooked into the nsa looking through your walls that this is really going on this is really
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:39.320]  happening the fbi without warrants is really listening to the microphones in your computer
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:43.880]  because they have unlimited computing power with your tax money and so why not listen to
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:52.760]  what everything you're doing why not dial in to the cameras i mean this is 50 light years past
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:02.680]  1984 and it was in place on 9 11 and it didn't stop the attacks of 9 11 of course it didn't stop them
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:09.800]  because the people that have hijacked the government are the ones that did it
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:12.360]  it's that simple
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:20.200]  and i'm not trying to be negative here folks you have to admit how much trouble we're in
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:24.360]  if we have a snowball's chance in hell of ever turning this around
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:29.480]  and it's some days i come in here and the news makes me so upset that i actually
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:36.280]  it's not like even a headache it's like a grumpy like where i physically am angry in my mind
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:41.880]  where it's not like a headache it's like a burning anger you know what the feeling like i could really
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:47.880]  kick somebody's butt right now you know that feeling and it's because as a primitive person who
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:54.760]  you know i have my intellectual areas but also my primitive areas i am just absolutely fire
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:11:01.480]  breathing angry at the establishment i'm not even i don't even hate them it's disgusting what
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:07.160]  what what the degenerate control freak filth they are and how they got control of our society
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:13.480]  and siphon off trillions of dollars and all of our different ingenuity to build monstrosities
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:18.520]  when when they should be having all the different clean energy free energy deployments there should
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:25.400]  be giant space colonies already life extension for everybody not putting up with people being lazy

[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:42.760]  potential the potential instead all we're doing is learning how to worship a bunch of big fat ugly
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:50.920]  rap stars and football and and and and just all of it miley cyrus and all of it and it's not that

[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:52.840]  normal free puppy love behavior it's totally natural totally normal totally healthy and then
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:58.280]  the parents fought back and didn't agree to him being listed as a sex offender so they had to
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:03.400]  remove that because the parents stood up and knew it was total mind control and rebuked it
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:08.360]  and used the enemy's outrageous social engineering against them you know they teach in all major

[02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:29.320]  James in Kentucky James you're on the air welcome hey how you doing brother I'm doing great thanks
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:34.040]  for asking everybody asked me I'm doing it in the next caller asked me how I'm doing and in the
[02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:40.920]  next caller asked me I'm doing let me ask you this how are you doing uh not real good uh sorry
[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:44.360]  I mean sometimes people have been I think people have themselves on speaker friends have had to
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:48.520]  wait a long time and finally they get on well I'm doing pretty good today most of the callers
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:54.120]  have been holding about 20 minutes thank you sir oh I just want to ask you um what do you know
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:59.880]  about the uh serial number that's on our birth certificate that supposedly establishes us as
[02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:07.480]  collateral to the our debt they claim that number is just to mark which group of prints that was
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:12.200]  to establish it's not a counterfeit but the social security number itself does establish
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:19.640]  you in the IMF and World Bank as a human resource as collateral so that is true okay thank you very
[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:24.440]  much that's what I was going to say I mean I think I keep getting away with killing everybody you
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:29.800]  know all of our you know movie stars and everything I mean you know like I've seen a list of Clinton
[02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:34.360]  like all the people he's had knocked off you know it's just disgusting you know I feel exactly the
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:40.920]  same as you do yeah I mean I know why people tune out of it and just give up and kind of roll over
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:44.440]  and let the globalists do whatever they want because deep down you go what do I do about this
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.560]  I think it's a balance though most people don't do anything about it I all I do is do this 24-7
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:56.360]  and I mean sometimes it just really freaks me out uh to just see how unaware people are of how
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:04.600]  much peril we're collectively in like I mean like I've seen on my mark dice you know completely you
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:11.400]  know rejecting the idea that Paul Walker was knocked off you know I mean I've seen like Bruce Lee
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:17.880]  Brandon Lee Heath Ledger you know I mean it is true they kill a lot of there are a lot of managers
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:22.360]  in Hollywood that clearly kill people under them so they get to keep their estate that they're
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:27.160]  managing that's why nobody in Hollywood should have some manager that's in control of their estate
[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:33.080]  because then that gives them the that gives them the incentive to knock you off I don't think that
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:37.640]  Walker was probably knocked off there were enough witnesses to see what happened I even got blamed
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:41.800]  for saying that a drone did it when we said the opposite but I don't think you can be criticized
[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:45.880]  for looking at that when there's such a history of it going on I hear what you're saying I appreciate
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:53.720]  your call interesting call there all right Bruce in Tennessee how are you doing Bruce well Alex
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:58.360]  I'm a little bit freaked out like you are I'm watching the police state accelerate at dramatic
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:05.400]  rates and I'm seeing this little sleepy area of Memphis um an enormous amount of activity from
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:11.080]  the police literally in the last year the police I see them on a daily 15 minutes 30 minute basis
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:17.320]  I know they are massively increasing the number of government enforcers because they're getting
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:24.200]  ready to absolutely gut the country well I actually decided to try to take some action
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:30.040]  against it Alex um I actually put out a little community newsletter citing an enormous amount
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:35.640]  of facts based upon the local level for example that Shelby County Sheriff's currently use shock
[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:42.680]  collars I'm sorry shock handcuffs um in there uh with they detained you they decide you know
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:49.080]  whether or not they can use that um as an example they also have gotten drones here I see drones
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:55.480]  here fly over almost every other day um it's starting to increase actually to uh almost every 12
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:59.720]  hours sometimes no I know and that's Homeland Security doing that when when they're done
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:04.840]  everyone in an airport will wear a shock bracelet because we're all criminals except the state
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:09.800]  and again popular science reports on it these terrifying handcuffs can shock and
[02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:15.560]  drug prisoners and again all of our money is spent by the parasitic government to keep the
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:21.560]  animals or their food that's us uh in place and so yes now when the police pull you over they'll
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:28.280]  put you in stun cuffs uh and then any excuse any arguing anything they're going to tase you
[02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:32.760]  and then the other psychopaths that run the department will then say oh we agree with what
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:37.160]  you did until it will be just killing you for disagreeing with them which they now do in San
[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:43.160]  Antonio exactly and actually I have relatives in San Antonio whom I went there and I got to a
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:49.800]  physical altercation with the uh or the San Antonio PD unfortunately and uh no charges etc etc right
[02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:54.360]  but uh basically back here in Memphis let me tell you something they got really pissed off
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:59.960]  about the newsletter that I wrote and handed out into the people's mailboxes myself manually about
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:06.760]  the police abuse in the local area and uh you mean I used an American handed out material
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:11.560]  political you don't do that in America what do you think this is a freak entry oh man you know
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:17.560]  what they did uh just not even about a week ago they claimed that a robber you can look it up
[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:21.960]  there was a video it just it was really weird they kind of was a robber so they had to come
[02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:26.600]  in your house without a warrant no not my house they blocked off the whole street and started
[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:32.600]  idea in everybody before they would even let them in yeah that's a martial law capture drill you
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:38.120]  train the victim they do this with child molestation that you touch them first a bunch and control them
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:42.360]  until you've tested them and that's the same thing the criminals are now testing the control
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:47.800]  of the slaves in the public schools on the highways it's all prisoner capture training so when they
[02:29:47.800 --> 02:29:52.760]  really finally kidnap you it's all over and you don't resist we're on the march the empires on the

[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:56.520]  running illegal checkpoints control and cordon checkpoints just familiarizing the public with
[02:33:56.520 --> 02:34:01.720]  contact with the police because in a free country the police only respond to crime and emergencies
[02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:07.000]  they don't ask people questions and set up checkpoints and set up citizen spy groups and
[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:12.920]  have the general public accustomed to contact with the police and other agencies
[02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:18.440]  and this is all part of the admitted acclamation and the total rollout of the end of america as we

[02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:01.880]  enjoying it and talking to you callers are bringing up a lot of great questions it's just
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:10.600]  that if i sound irritable some days it's because man i know how real this is it's all out in the
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:18.760]  open and it's really freaking me out it's really really really really freaking me out the u.s government
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:24.280]  lobotomized 2000 mentally ill veterans and likely hundreds more during and after world war two according
[02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:30.440]  to a cache of forgotten memos letters and government reports unearthed by the wall street
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:37.560]  journal that's in the army times that's nothing compared to what's currently going on new ap poll
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:42.120]  nearly four in five see obama care will worsen insurance coverage doesn't matter though they're
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:47.800]  teaching you that it's bad and there's nothing you can do about it that's the real going off the
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:53.240]  cliff and now yeah we're going to take your bank account data and then we're going to take your bank
[02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:57.880]  account for not buying obama care even though you're unable to and yeah we're going to debit your bank
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:08.680]  account because they love you so much i mean this is the total breaking of the society
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:15.480]  in news that will surprise no one nsa has cracked mobile phone encryption to listen to your calls
[02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:19.560]  i mean that's not a tech dirt folks i mean that's like saying sunlight has learned how to go to the
[02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:27.480]  atmosphere uh this is all the way or that stars twinkle twinkle twinkle little star how i wonder
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:34.680]  what you are up there in the sky so bright like a diamond in the night is that how it goes
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:39.640]  they could probably tell people that you know two plus two equals five they do to that
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:44.280]  and that stars are really you know pinholes and a curtain or something i mean that i'm telling
[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:47.800]  the public will believe anything they tell you it's racist not to believe it if you don't believe
[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:53.080]  that the stars are really pinholes and a blanket up in the sky then you're racist there people will
[02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:56.760]  actually because i said that they will actually now believe that because if you tell them do what i
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:37:02.600]  say you're racist they'll do it there that's an example of mind control of course the big telecoms
[02:37:02.600 --> 02:37:09.560]  gave them their encryption up front i mean the telecoms are the new world order they are the
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:14.520]  big banks they get paid to run all this they get paid to steal from everybody
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:21.480]  i need to not get in such a bad mood obama suppressing 6000 page report on cia torture
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:26.520]  adopted by senate intelligence committee of course the torture continues
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:34.280]  after a hundred years of failure it's time to end the fed a new ron paul article up on
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:39.640]  info wars dot com i was on ron paul's tv show today but they keep they keep it only down for
[02:37:39.640 --> 02:37:43.400]  subscribers and then on some of the tv systems they're on and i think i think they need to get
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:46.840]  that out to everybody but regardless there's building a nice little network over there i enjoyed
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:50.520]  being interviewed by ron paul thought it was cool and if we can find it on youtube when it goes up
[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:55.240]  later we'll link it on info wars dot com it was really great to be interviewed by ron paul it was
[02:37:55.240 --> 02:37:59.880]  so weird to be him looking at me on video and i'm looking back at him on video it was just different
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:05.480]  after a hundred years of failure it's time to end the fed also got stuck in traffic it was 15
[02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:12.760]  minutes late for my interview usually on time that was weird um nico was sitting there while
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:16.200]  they were on skype waiting for me to get here and ron paul means over in a friendly way and goes
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:21.640]  i'm on time for his interviews uh continuing north korea tribs pledge loyalty en masse
[02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:27.880]  as co on alert he's having his uncles and cousins and people executed for not properly
[02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:32.280]  worshiping him and i think it's fitting in a hereditary dictatorship of communism
[02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:37.240]  you have a third generation king uh who uh you know has ex-girlfriends executed as well
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:44.280]  and hey roman's 13 according to all the preachers here in town that badmouth me 24 seven to their
[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:49.800]  practitioners and people that come in their flock the state is god god put him there we
[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:54.440]  should all worship kim jung uh of course the whole bible's about resisting tyrants but you know
[02:38:54.440 --> 02:39:00.520]  no bp signs deal to develop 16 billion dollar omaha shale gas project
[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:07.480]  us navy helicopter crashes in japan yemen parliament votes to ban drone attacks
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:12.120]  that's not going to stop the new world order skynet from bombing people after they killed
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:18.600]  15 more in a wedding last week us transfers to guantanamo detainees of saudi arabia for special
[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:24.520]  torture george p bush says he's a tea party conservative showing how much power the tea
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:31.080]  party has he's not for the new world order i'm no marxist pope francis tells conservative critics
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:37.000]  i did read most of his big paper he's not really calling for marxism there he's saying
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:42.440]  big mega banks and big powerful groups are setting up a system that's so scientific that no one
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:47.240]  even has an economy and corporations and companies need to build a system that's sustainable for
[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:54.440]  people to have jobs and i actually agree with that capitalism is not coming in as corporations
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:58.600]  that control the government shutting down your competition and using you know artificial trading
[02:39:58.600 --> 02:40:02.200]  systems that are fraudulent and bankrupting everyone and then everyone goes broke so you
[02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:09.560]  can buy up everything they've got artificially fed could set off record in fireworks uh if they do
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:15.560]  have quantitative easing i don't think they will folks because it i mean to say if they do stop
[02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:21.080]  quantitative easing it will cause fireworks but i don't think they will stop the qe unlimited
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:27.000]  because it's two different poisons pick your poison that's just some of the news uh on
[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:34.040]  that front consumer reports ask are too many kids taking anti psychotic drugs none of them
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:43.800]  should be taking it us explores ties with syrian islamist rebels possibly a sawed too
[02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:49.000]  for a lineup to fight al qaeda that is just pure propaganda being put out to act like
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:53.480]  they're distancing themselves from al qaeda which they publicly run that's really hurt the new
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:41:01.720]  world order with the u.s military finally waking them up to a deep level and then i've got a whole
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:06.680]  deal where the new york post is coming out talking about the saudi corrupt saudi arabian connection
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:15.480]  in 9 11 and basically confirming what i said and and and others pointed out about the saudi
[02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:20.120]  arabian connection that got covered up so they've gone from demonizing people to talk about that
[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:26.760]  to now basically admitting all of that uh whole families murdered by syrian rebels execute over
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:33.640]  80 civilians outside demascus in one day alone that's rt surprise mainstream media fox news
[02:41:33.640 --> 02:41:38.760]  admits gmo's a real safety issue prison planet dot com article that's a really important article
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:43.160]  we need to get on info wars i didn't see this on info wars we asked them to put that on info wars
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:46.680]  i know there's a lot of different news on prison planet which is good uh it's good to have the
[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:52.360]  sites be somewhat different but we need to get that on info wars if it's not in fact i'll just
[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:58.840]  give it to you here you go very important video report documents reveal states move to vastly expand
[02:41:58.840 --> 02:42:02.520]  continuity of government in washington the feds are lobbying to have the states to spend their
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:08.920]  constitution and basically allow marshal law the documents up on info wars dot com christmas under
[02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:14.440]  assault a new american article i got a call from cnn today going do you agree with megah and kelly
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:19.480]  that santa claus is white and i said yeah they go well we don't need any more guests we were just
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:23.880]  calling to see your opinion i guess it's going to be in some piece to go extremist like alex jones
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:29.320]  you know thinks he's white that's racist they said last week on the news that you know you
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:33.000]  should have only black sandals or other sandals it's mean to have any icon that's white because
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:40.520]  white is evil folks if you have other mythical creatures or other mythical people um you know
[02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:46.280]  you can look up uh african uh you know children deities or whatever they have them that are similar
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:52.280]  if we followed that here i would say it was black you know that the character was black i mean
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:43:00.120]  yeah yeah there to santa claus should not be a white anymore that is the headline from slate
[02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:04.600]  and then it goes to the different pundits that are saying it it's time to give saint nick
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:11.480]  his long overdue makeover well i mean my whole issue here is that this shows how why not just make
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:18.840]  other mythical characters like the federal reserve claims it's federal why not you know why not
[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:25.240]  actually make it federal no no i'm being sarcastic the point is if you have say superman that's
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:31.880]  supposedly white why say it's racist to make superman white let's make him black uh or who's
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:36.280]  a famous superhero that's black you mean example of that i don't really follow superheroes there's
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:41.800]  a bunch of them i know uh i mean do they have to be white now and that's kind of what what
[02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:46.920]  santa claus is is like a superhero so the whole point is it's somebody from the north pole somebody
[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:54.840]  from northern europe it comes from the netherlands where he's white for 500 years and so why do you
[02:43:54.840 --> 02:43:59.720]  have to make him another color then to make everybody else happy it's kind of like mother
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:05.160]  and father upsets gays and lesbians well who says who speaks for them anyways so you can't say
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:10.280]  mother and father on your official documents because that's hurtful this is just literal
[02:44:10.280 --> 02:44:15.480]  mind control training us that we can't have any culture but two plus two equals five the only
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:21.880]  culture is mental illness the only culture is not knowing facts power man there you go well i think
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:29.480]  power man should have to be uh should have to be uh white or hispanic there's a bunch of other
[02:44:29.480 --> 02:44:33.880]  black superheroes i mean i can't even keep track of it all but you know there's like black green
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:38.600]  lanterns that they need to be white i mean this is just pointless ladies and gentlemen it's like
[02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:43.240]  all these debates about what color jesus was or whatever fine making whatever color you want
[02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:48.280]  that makes santa claus i've been in places and seen a black santa claus i did i wasn't offended
[02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:53.080]  by it who even cares but i mean if you had a black character and then you made him white would that be
[02:44:53.080 --> 02:45:00.520]  offensive i don't think so if you just did it for your event or wanted to have fun but to make it
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:05.960]  an issue see we shouldn't even be talking about this we should be talking about the inequity
[02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:14.680]  we should be talking about the the the problem in society
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:21.800]  where you've got foreign banks ruining all of our futures devaluing all of our dollars shutting
[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:25.720]  down all of our power plants that is our power plants collectively they're not shutting physically
[02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:30.520]  all of them down but they are all our power plants that we've paid for with our money
[02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:34.920]  our bills and it's all being we're all being selectively robbed of our future all being
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:41.720]  spied on by the nsa i mean it's like if you go see the movie four i saw the first one i haven't
[02:45:41.720 --> 02:45:48.520]  seen the new one and you know they've got the black gatekeeper uh at asgard i wasn't offended
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:53.960]  that they put a black character in there even though it comes out of norse myth norse mythology
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:59.880]  where there were no black people in northern europe with inviting europe inviting uh you know
[02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:06.360]  atlantic ocean so why would you do that i mean it'd be like if you were if i went and watched a movie
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:14.680]  about fictitious zulu war a zulu character uh expecting there to be white zulus for political
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:20.840]  correctness sake i mean i guess that is kind of what tarzan is so we can have a white hero in
[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:27.640]  africa so i guess that is basically what's going on it's the mindlessness of all this totally and
[02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:36.680]  completely mindless let me go ahead here and go to your phone calls and i'll go back into that news
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:44.280]  that i mentioned uh dealing with saudi arabia you know is it racist that 15 of the 19 hijackers
[02:46:44.280 --> 02:46:48.600]  came from saudi arabia is it right that i'm pointing out there from saudi arabia is that
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:53.160]  really an anti-arab sentiment that's the kind of thing cnn would ask back when clinton was
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:58.360]  selling all our secrets out to the communist chinese leadership cnn called me once i don't think they
[02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:01.960]  even had me on most of the time they call they don't have you on they go we know when you're
[02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:06.520]  radio show we're just to have conservatives on and i'm like i'm really a libertarian thank you
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:12.520]  constitutionalist that that you know there's a lot of criticism of uh china and and missile
[02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:17.240]  secrets and things are you saying that because you're against chinese people and i said excuse me
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:21.800]  that's like if you criticize israeli espionage they'll say it's anti-semitic
[02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:26.280]  no i don't want the chinese involved in espionage i don't want the white president at the time
[02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:31.960]  involved in espionage i don't want the israelis involved in espionage i don't want the russians
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:37.080]  involved in espionage and it's not because i dislike russians it's not because i dislike jews
[02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:43.480]  it's not because i dislike erebs i dislike being stolen from i dislike being screwed with i dislike
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:49.640]  being robbed but see they want to change the subject ladies and gentlemen the controlled media
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:54.640]  at first wouldn't say most of the knockout game, his racist blacks targeting whites and
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:59.120]  others until Al Sharpton knew it was going to blow up in their face so he came out and
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:03.400]  said it needs to stop because it was inherently a racial attack that was going on.
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:09.600]  The media is so controlled that that's what they do because they're not wedded to covering
[02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:12.120]  up black on white crime, that's not what it is.
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:19.880]  They're wedded on keeping the divide and conquer going but doing it from a leftist perspective.
[02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:25.440]  Let's go to some phone calls here, JD in California, thanks for holding, good to hear from you.
[02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:30.160]  Yep, straight to the point, I had an idea about, after seeing what happened with you
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:35.200]  in Dallas and talking about suing the Pittsburgh police and stuff, I was thinking maybe we
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:41.360]  need a team of specialized protesters in every city that know how to take a beating without
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:47.480]  fighting back and have a team of lawyers that work pro bono and start exposing it and get
[02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:51.200]  some funding for the info or in the meantime.
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:54.280]  You know, here's my issue, I agree they're violating the First Amendment everywhere under
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:58.240]  federal guidelines and it's important to sue and we have sued Pittsburgh and Wynne.
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:03.320]  I haven't sued the sheriff's department because it was really the feds that ordered it and
[02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:09.120]  I kind of got to pick my battles, I mean I could probably, good chance win a lawsuit
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:14.840]  but I mean, it's just like it's taxpayer money, somebody else needs to do it because
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:20.000]  I literally can't even keep my operation going to the next level if I get distracted
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:25.800]  but I do think it's important for people to stop bowling to government, we've bowed
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:30.640]  to government so long the government thinks the proper citizen position is on our knees
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:33.720]  or bent over a barrel.
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:35.640]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:41.040]  I mean literally I expect the new salute to the police is bend over grab your ankles.
[02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:46.400]  I'm not joking, I mean they're doing proctology exams all over the US now viciously without
[02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:51.480]  even probable cause because it's all an act of domination over us, they're food.
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:56.320]  Well, because most people do sit there and take it because they all, everyone's been
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:50:01.360]  taught that you can't fight the government, that they are too big, too powerful and that
[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:05.440]  you might as well just, you know, you're a lot safer to just go along with it and just
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:11.040]  you know, keep quiet and let them do their thing.
[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:12.760]  Very well said brother, anything else?
[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:16.520]  Well, I'll let you get the next call man, amen.
[02:50:16.520 --> 02:50:20.400]  This just popped up on DrudgeReport.com, we're going to put it up on InfoWars.com, this is
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:21.560]  a top story.
[02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:26.200]  You know they've used the gun database in New York, Illinois to then come confiscate
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:30.840]  guns, California now has a gun database and they're going to use it to confiscate guns
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:35.920]  because they're already taking legal guns and it's in the Sacramento Bee, it goes on
[02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:44.200]  to break down that they've begun the national database through the states and California
[02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:48.920]  Department of Justice will retain informational long gun purchases, data had formerly been
[02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:53.440]  compelled to destroy within five days, dealers will need to register purchases with the state
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:58.080]  and they will use that to confiscate your guns, you cannot buy guns in California.
[02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:05.080]  I'm telling you folks, you're in deep trouble.

[02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:21.200]  We're back live, final segment on the jamming, a few final phone calls here, maybe do some
[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:29.240]  overdrive, take rest of the calls from Terry and Mike and Tony and Michael and a few others.
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:32.640]  Here's some good news on the gun grabbing front, sheriffs refused to enforce laws on
[02:54:32.640 --> 02:54:38.080]  gun control all over Colorado and other areas of the country, they're just pointing out
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:40.680]  they're not going to persecute people, they're not going to take people to jail that have
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:45.360]  a 30 round mag just because it might have been purchased after the ban and that they're
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:48.760]  not, I mean they've already nullified not arresting illegal aliens nationwide and that's
[02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:54.280]  against the law to not do that, something's not constitutional, don't follow it.
[02:54:54.280 --> 02:55:02.480]  This is from New York Post and it's basically everything we put in my 9-11 films, the fact
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:07.040]  that the 15 hijackers were working for the U.S. government, they were protected, we don't
[02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:11.600]  know what really happened, we just know it's a cover-up, just like Tamerlan Zarnev was
[02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:17.200]  working for the CIA, that's confirmed, there was a drill, there was a stand-down, there
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:24.040]  was a cover-up, they tried to kill both brothers, the other brothers said he's not guilty, I'm
[02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:31.520]  telling you folks, it's a setup, so Murdoch's New York Post today backs something we put
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:36.920]  out, here we go, Google's racing robots give Amazon's drones a run for their money, yeah
[02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:41.680]  you can forget drones delivering packages, that's a PR stunt, 18-wheelers and cars delivering
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:45.600]  packages and freight by robot, they're already getting all the laws passed to do that, then
[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:48.640]  they're going to say the robots are safer than you, it's already begun, and then ban
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:54.360]  you from driving, first they're going to charge you more, Russia's station is candor missiles
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:57.960]  in western region with nukes, threatening to basically nuke Europe, I mean this is
[02:55:57.960 --> 02:56:02.840]  getting serious, meanwhile the police are all being trying to take on the American people
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:07.680]  during a collapse scenario, I know the average police are not bad, I want to say that because
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:11.760]  I've learned that, but you better be doing something to speak out against this and say
[02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:17.960]  no, and that's starting to happen, there's a lot of good news happening, but the battle
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:23.080]  is on and the globalists push, we push back, they stop, then they push back when we quit,
[02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:28.560]  we've got to want to win it, just like a football game, stay in it for four quarters, 100%,
[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:32.680]  we will beat them, we have the moral high ground, but it's going to take serious focus, finally
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:38.360]  in the shower, we have personally branded the highest quality dash cam systems with
[02:56:38.360 --> 02:56:44.560]  a free 4 gig megabyte system, high def, that can videotape wildlife, the police when they're
[02:56:44.560 --> 02:56:50.760]  out of control, road ragers, double rainbows, whatever the case is, I use it in my car,
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:55.560]  I'm going to shoot a video showing it later in the next few weeks, we have these discounted
[02:56:55.560 --> 02:57:02.080]  $30 less than the leading competitor of the exact same system, this is $150 to $130, we
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:10.960]  have it for $99.95 with the free memory stick, high def at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLifes.com

[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:20.000]  fluoride shield, it has the nascent iodine in it, but five other key ingredients, the
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:25.560]  turbo charge, the other survival shield nascent iodine, when you get a bottle of nascent iodine
[02:57:25.560 --> 02:57:30.440]  for the regular price of $30, you get the two ounce bottle double the size of fluoride
[02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:37.520]  shield $10 off, so you get both bottles for $59.95, this blows away the leading competitors,
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:41.960]  this stuff is very expensive to produce compared to other, I mean I just got to tell you, I'm
[02:57:41.960 --> 02:57:45.880]  really getting into this learning what's going on, this is the highest quality and it supports
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:54.600]  the broadcast, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLifes.com and this is a great gift to give for Christmas,

[02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:51.080]  that's racist, the red hat is really a clan hat folks, I need to be arrested.
[02:58:51.080 --> 02:58:56.320]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers, the prognosis for the entire planetary
[02:58:56.320 --> 02:59:01.920]  economic system runs from bad to worse, the globalist model is to shut down societies
[02:59:01.920 --> 02:59:06.800]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover, that's why we've
[02:59:06.800 --> 02:59:12.720]  assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com, these are items

[02:59:51.920 --> 02:59:58.920]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:22.920 --> 03:00:27.040]  You know we emailed Camille Pagli a few months ago and she said she might come on in the
[03:00:27.040 --> 03:00:30.520]  new year but she's too busy right now with a book and debating and everything, but I
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:35.040]  really want to get her on, it's up on DrudgeReport right now, DrudgeReport.com, it's a man's
[03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:39.560]  world and it will always be, the modern economy is a male epic in which women have found a
[03:00:39.560 --> 03:00:44.880]  productive role but women were not its author, well men are the strength of women and women
[03:00:44.880 --> 03:00:48.880]  are the strength of men, but I want to cover more of this article tomorrow because I really
[03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:55.240]  agree with her breakdown on society, really a genius level lady and a real liberal, I
[03:00:55.240 --> 03:00:59.200]  would use that term like a Thomas Jefferson type, for real freedom and real empowerment
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:04.200]  of men and women together, not a war between men and women played off by the controlled
[03:01:04.200 --> 03:01:05.200]  left.
[03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:09.880]  Let's talk to Terry in Illinois, Terry you're on the air, thanks for holding, welcome.
[03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:11.880]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[03:01:11.880 --> 03:01:12.880]  Good brother, good.
[03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:17.960]  I wanted to compliment you on your son's interview you did with the Fun Facts and the Science
[03:01:17.960 --> 03:01:21.480]  of the Head, you need to make him an anchor, give him an anchor position.
[03:01:21.480 --> 03:01:26.720]  He loves to talk, he's smarter than I am, 11 years old and we've almost got Mama convinced
[03:01:26.720 --> 03:01:31.280]  to let him come down here and work one day a week in the office but, well think about
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:34.920]  it like this, you'll reach a whole different audience and the young ones will listen to
[03:01:34.920 --> 03:01:38.400]  him because he's so intelligent and he knows what he's talking about.
[03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:41.760]  I know, I know, I mean he doesn't want to be on the air to be famous, he can care less
[03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:45.680]  about stuff like that, he can care less about Hollywood and all the rest of stuff but he
[03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:49.880]  really loves to talk to people and he is a great son, it's one of my greatest blessings.
[03:01:49.880 --> 03:01:52.520]  Well it will help you reach a new audience.
[03:01:52.520 --> 03:01:57.400]  Now the thought that I had, did you know anything about the Batman movie when it came out in
[03:01:57.400 --> 03:01:58.400]  the fall?
[03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:03.400]  It showed Batman standing at a desk, guess what's written on the desk?
[03:02:03.400 --> 03:02:04.400]  Sandy Hook.
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:05.400]  Sandy Hook.
[03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:12.640]  And then on the end sign, we said, hold on a second, in the background over Colorado
[03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:14.680]  30 minutes later in the same movie.
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:15.680]  I know.
[03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:21.760]  And that came out in the fall and Sandy Hook in a war happened in the spring.
[03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:27.160]  Did you know, we said that Batman would be used for triggers of operatives, mind control
[03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:30.280]  operatives before the movie came out?
[03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:33.600]  Did you know the name of that movie is The Dark Knight Rises?
[03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:39.320]  I did and in Bane I said it's supposed to be a French Revolution character and later
[03:02:39.320 --> 03:02:44.600]  the writer of it admitted that and in the national media said, am I trying to one up
[03:02:44.600 --> 03:02:45.600]  you?
[03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:46.600]  I'm just agreeing with you.
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:49.080]  Hey, I don't have much time so you gotta let me get here.
[03:02:49.080 --> 03:02:55.680]  Proverbs 29-2 says, when someone wicked rules the people sigh.
[03:02:55.680 --> 03:02:56.680]  God bless you.
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:02:58.000]  Very well said, brother.
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  Great call, Terry.
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000]  Let's talk to Bill in North Carolina.
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:02.560]  No, no, no, Bill's not next.
[03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:03.560]  It's Michael.
[03:03:03.560 --> 03:03:04.560]  Michael, you're on the air in Arizona.
[03:03:04.560 --> 03:03:05.560]  I'm in Arizona.
[03:03:05.560 --> 03:03:06.560]  Yeah, Michael.
[03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:07.560]  How you doing?
[03:03:07.560 --> 03:03:08.560]  Hello, Alex.
[03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:10.560]  Nice to talk to you again.
[03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:13.120]  Still looking forward to meeting with you.
[03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:20.040]  I'll tell you what, I remember what you just said about that Batman movie.
[03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:27.040]  I remember you predicting that, your prediction and I don't watch those things, man.
[03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:28.040]  I don't watch.
[03:03:28.040 --> 03:03:29.040]  I watch documentaries.
[03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:31.520]  Well, again, it's not that all movies have subliminals.
[03:03:31.520 --> 03:03:32.520]  We've learned that.
[03:03:32.520 --> 03:03:37.240]  But you called it out before it came out and I remember that, brother.
[03:03:37.240 --> 03:03:38.240]  Well, thank you.
[03:03:38.240 --> 03:03:42.320]  But the point is, is that it's not every movie we've learned that franchise is used
[03:03:42.320 --> 03:03:43.320]  for programming.
[03:03:43.320 --> 03:03:44.320]  Go ahead.
[03:03:44.320 --> 03:03:45.320]  Right on.
[03:03:45.320 --> 03:03:46.320]  Yeah.
[03:03:46.320 --> 03:03:47.320]  Okay.
[03:03:47.320 --> 03:03:51.040]  Um, my thing is, um, what I want to say today, then I'll make it real quick.
[03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:57.920]  I've got a couple of examples and I've got another one coming up is, um, how they, whether
[03:03:57.920 --> 03:04:03.240]  it's local, federal, state, or whatever they'd like to sugarcoat things.
[03:04:03.240 --> 03:04:09.920]  Oh, I mean, Obamacare, when they first started talking about it, when Obama first came into
[03:04:09.920 --> 03:04:12.280]  office, it sounded like a good thing.
[03:04:12.280 --> 03:04:18.800]  While it went to hell, excuse my language, drones, I got out of the military in 92.
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:24.640]  They came out with drones and they were saying back then, you know, in the early nineties,
[03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:30.000]  they were going to, um, monitor the battlefields.
[03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:31.000]  Okay.
[03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:32.000]  That's fine.
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:33.000]  That sounds good.
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:34.000]  That's going to save our lives.
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.000]  But now they're making it a battlefield here.
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  What was your other point?
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:43.680]  When they weaponized them, I, I thought to myself being a veteran myself, which means
[03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:50.240]  I'm a racist, I guess, or a terrorist or whatever, but I said, that's going to be trouble.
[03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:55.240]  You said two plus two equals four and use common sense and think it for yourself as conspiracy
[03:04:55.240 --> 03:04:56.240]  theory.
[03:04:56.240 --> 03:05:10.200]  And that's why it's illegal and wrong, two plus two equals five.
