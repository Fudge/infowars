[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:13.000 --> 00:35.000]  Well, I don't normally dance around like a happy leprechaun. I just found a thousand buckets of gold.
[00:35.000 --> 00:44.000]  But you notice yesterday I did a lot of celebrating on air because I know the smell of blood in the water.
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  And there's blood in the water. There's blood on the street. It's up to my ankles.
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  That's the blood of tyrants politically beginning to bleed out.
[00:57.000 --> 01:07.000]  Big Tech has crossed the Rubicon. They've engaged in massive 2020 election meddling and they've been caught doing it on so many fronts it makes my head spin.
[01:07.000 --> 01:20.000]  And when their director of censorship that has an Orwellian name got caught red handed by Project Veritas,
[01:20.000 --> 01:30.000]  Google yesterday pulled the Project Veritas video and is threatening to suspend their account.
[01:30.000 --> 01:38.000]  Guess what happened? The House of Representatives responded by uploading it to House.gov.
[01:38.000 --> 01:47.000]  And now the Streisand effect just hit in with beautiful white hot afterburners.
[01:47.000 --> 02:04.000]  Congressman Louis Gohmert of Texas has uploaded it. The censored 25 minute report is posted front and center at infowars.com and newswars.com today right under the live news feed.
[02:04.000 --> 02:20.000]  With the headline, Watch Life. Google's attempt to cover up their election meddling 2020 blows up in their face.
[02:20.000 --> 02:35.000]  We have the arrogant head of their operations censoring admitting that they'll do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want and that Congress can go to hell.
[02:35.000 --> 02:45.000]  This is the proof of the criminal activity, the proof of the meddling, the proof of the lying to Congress, the perjury.
[02:45.000 --> 03:03.000]  It's beautiful. It's big. It's massive. And if you get the articles out that are on infowars.com and newswars.com like see the report Google censored about their election meddling in 2020
[03:03.000 --> 03:22.000]  with Jen Jenay, head of responsible innovation at Google, that's the name of their censorship system. Bragging about how they control everyone and they shadow ban everyone and they ban everyone and that they're not going to let Trump get reelected.
[03:22.000 --> 03:37.000]  They have the murder tape, like when a serial killer videotapes them torturing a kid to death, you have an open and shut dead to rights, dead as a doornail politically movement.
[03:37.000 --> 03:53.000]  There's been a lot of big trouble now. And we've got a whole bunch of articles on this with the censored video and the bombshell interview with Project Veritas head yesterday that's so good.
[03:53.000 --> 04:07.000]  I rarely asked the War Room to air something I did. I rarely asked David Knight to air something we did. They both re-aired it. I'm going to air 10 minutes of the interview on the other side with James O'Keefe because guess what?
[04:07.000 --> 04:19.000]  That's a whole other story. We've confirmed that a bunch of people have uploaded this to YouTube and it's been taken down more than 15 times by prestigious channels that thought it was newsworthy.
[04:19.000 --> 04:28.000]  It's been taken off their channels. And so that's a whole other story. Now James O'Keefe being interviewed, being taken down, telling you that more insiders are coming.
[04:28.000 --> 04:44.000]  That article is on infowars.com. We'll put it back on screen for viewers from newswars.com. That's the real site we need to go to with James O'Keefe saying that more whistleblowers are coming forward.
[04:44.000 --> 05:00.000]  More whistleblowers. This will stop them stealing the election. This is the heart of the fight. This is the key to the fight. But it's up to you. Spread those newswars.com links. Newswars.
[05:00.000 --> 05:13.000]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square. The other thing that's unique about infowars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[05:13.000 --> 05:19.000]  That's not backed by some billionaire. That's not being funded by a secret foreign government. It is completely independent of all that.
[05:19.000 --> 05:34.000]  The old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[05:34.000 --> 05:46.000]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear.
[05:46.000 --> 06:00.000]  Newswars audience has broken through that. They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom. And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation, lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[06:16.000 --> 06:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Google has really stepped in and created a giant Streisand effect event. The head of Google's operations that runs censorship got caught on hidden camera along with other executives bragging
[06:45.000 --> 06:53.000]  about how they were going to block Trump from being reelected in 2020 and named their secret operational headquarters that's carrying all this out.
[06:53.000 --> 07:04.000]  The full interview and expose has been taken off YouTube by Google. Congress is now investigating the House and Senate have re-uploaded the video so the public can see it at House.gov.
[07:04.000 --> 07:16.000]  We have re-uploaded the full censored 25 minute expose and our censored interview with James O'Keeffe to infowars.com and newswars.com. Get it and email it out to everyone you know.
[07:16.000 --> 07:23.000]  But here's part of the James O'Keeffe interview from yesterday in Project Veritas. They don't want you to see.
[07:23.000 --> 07:38.000]  Thanks, Alex. Yeah, it is a 25 minute report. We uploaded it this morning. It's on Drudge and Red. And this is a video recording of an insider that's someone who currently works for Google blowing the whistle.
[07:38.000 --> 07:46.000]  It comes on the heels of a story from a Pinterest insider which I know your audience saw. So there's this sort of watershed moment where they're all coming forward.
[07:46.000 --> 07:54.000]  Now what this video shows is it shows the insider talking about algorithmic unfairness. That's a term you probably haven't heard before.
[07:54.000 --> 08:00.000]  The confidential documents which I have a copy of here and appear in the video. And I'm going to read from the document.
[08:00.000 --> 08:08.000]  It says, quote, in some cases it may be appropriate to take no action if the system that's Google accurately affects reality.
[08:08.000 --> 08:16.000]  While in other cases it may be desirable to consider how he might help society reach a more fair and equitable state via product intervention.
[08:16.000 --> 08:31.000]  So these documents show algorithmic unfairness. The executive named Janai on the secret recording obtained by Project Veritas shows how they want to affect the 2020 election outcome.
[08:31.000 --> 08:42.000]  All these things corroborate each other. It is a huge story, Alex. An insider, whistleblower, secret recordings of the executives inside of Google and the documents.
[08:42.000 --> 08:55.000]  And it shows Google's efforts to basically augment reality and to quote the Google documents basically have an impact on the masses to get the agenda they want.
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.000]  James, when I got up this morning and saw this, nothing gives me butterflies, nothing gives me short of breath.
[09:01.000 --> 09:08.000]  I almost had an anxiety attack on how in the hell am I going to make a big enough deal about this. And then a text message came in from the producer.
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  Oh, we've got James O'Keefe. I was like, I mean, because I want to beat these people and we know they've been doing it. You've caught them a bunch yourself.
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  We've caught them. They brag about it. And now you've got like the holy grail, the Rosetta Stone, the skeleton key.
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  I mean, she's on there. Others are on there just admitting it. And there's term product intervention.
[09:26.000 --> 09:34.000]  Sundar is up before Congress eight months ago saying we don't intervene in anything. I mean, the perjury alone.
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.000]  Yeah. And one of the things that this Jen Jani, who's the head of Google Innovation says, you just showed the quote.
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.000]  She said that we're not changing. Congress can pressure us, but we don't want to show up. We're not changing.
[09:46.000 --> 09:54.000]  So I think one of the one of the things the insider told me was how there he is. Congress can pressure us, but we're not changing.
[09:54.000 --> 10:04.000]  And she specifically says that Liz Warren, she's I like Liz Warren, but you know, Liz Warren has some problems because if they break Google Up says this Jen Jani,
[10:04.000 --> 10:13.000]  then small companies won't be able to stop Trump. But we can. We can prevent a big company can prevent Trump's situation where smaller companies cannot.
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.000]  So the issue is, Alex, that the Google is classified as a public platform.
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  I understand. Section 230 back in 60. James O'Keefe, the legend.
[10:25.000 --> 10:33.000]  Okay, I've been interviewing James O'Keefe for 10 years since he blew open Acorn.
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  And I've seen all the devastating victories and then proud to indict him and their failures.
[10:39.000 --> 10:48.000]  But to sit here and have him have the head of Google censorship with this weird Orwellian name of the office caught in undercover video.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  You realize how hard it is to get this to penetrate, to infiltrate.
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.000]  This is like the allies in 1941 getting the enigma code from the Nazis.
[10:59.000 --> 11:05.000]  Okay, if Congress and the president don't act and then they must be complicit, which we know Trump isn't.
[11:05.000 --> 11:11.000]  But his underlings are bought off by Google and keep, you know, he's not lobbying and taking lobbying money, but they are.
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  This is gone to the president. It needs to go mega viral.
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.000]  It's at drugsreport.com, infowars.com, projectveritas.com, get it out.
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  25 minute report. Total evidence of Google election meddling in 2020.
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  Trump must act now.
[11:26.000 --> 11:34.000]  Reddit blocks project Veritas group exposes Google election meddling insider blows whistle on exec reveals Google plan to prevent Trump situation.
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  2020, they are scared of this.
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.000]  This is kryptonite to their fraud.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  So we've got you got eight and a half minutes to work break.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  You've got to go. You've got the floor.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  Am I right in saying this is probably the most important thing you've ever broken?
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  This is the total price.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  This is by far the biggest thing we ever broke.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  I mean, a lot of people are thinking what's going to happen?
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  Well, first of all, the story just came out.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  I think Congress is going to hold hearings.
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  The lawmakers are telling me sort of here.
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  They're texting me. We're going to have hearings in July.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  But I mean, the video is 25 minutes long.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  So I mean, I've only got about eight minutes.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  So let me just try to get through some of the facts here and maybe talk about it.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  I'm not one to characterize people.
[12:12.000 --> 12:13.000]  I'm just going to quote them.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  Okay, Alex, I'm not going to characterize them.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  That that man in the shadow you see, the insider is a current Google employee.
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  And one of the things he said to me as I was interviewing him, he said, James,
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  people would think this is a conspiracy theory if it weren't for the documents.
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  And one of the documents he gave me says, I'm going to quote them.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  This is Google, not me, not you.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  It says, it says, quote, training data are collected and classified.
[12:36.000 --> 12:37.000]  Algorithms are programmed.
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.000]  Media are filtered, ranked, aggregated and generated.
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  People like us are programmed.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  That's a direct quote.
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  People like us are programmed.
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.000]  And one of the things that this executive says is that people who believe
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.000]  and agree with President Trump will not like our definition of, quote, fairness.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  That's Jen Jenai, the woman you're looking at right there.
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.000]  People who voted for the current president do not agree with our definition of fairness.
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.000]  So what's interesting, Alex, is that Google is saying here that they're able to define fairness
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  and this algorithmic unfairness, and they have product intervention.
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  So what the Google insider did is he sat down with me and he Googled Hillary Clinton's emails.
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  That's just a phrase.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  And you can do it right now at your home computer.
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  And it doesn't autocomplete, even though millions of people search for that.
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  But then he typed in Donald Trump's emails and it did autocomplete,
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  even though very few people search for that.
[13:32.000 --> 13:39.000]  So Google is actually meddling in an election by virtue of defining what is fair and what is not fair.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  And they would never admit this publicly.
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  And right now they're in a huge world of trouble because that is not a low-level ranking employee.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  That is the head of their entire innovation department.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  And she, as well as Gorov Gite, corroborated the Google algorithmic unfairness document.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  Now, Alex, one thing I must tell you.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  That's the censorship blueprint.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  She's the head of innovation, which is ending the old algorithm
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  when it's popular going to censorship.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  I mean, you couldn't get better descriptors for the names of the departments
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  if you went to Orwell or the protagonist Winston in 1984 who edits out,
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  remember that movie where he edits out all the newspapers?
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  Yeah, Ministry of Truth is the Ministry of Law.
[14:15.000 --> 14:16.000]  Ministry of Truth.
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.000]  I mean, this document's called Definition of Algorithmic Unfairness.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  It's labeled privileged and confidential.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  Now, many of you are wondering, wow, these people are real heroes for blowing the whistle.
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  Hell, yeah, they're heroes.
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  They make a lot of money and they don't care.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  And one of the things he said, the man in the silhouette there who works for Google,
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  he said, I'm nothing but an ant.
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  He says, I'm going after Goliath here.
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  And I said, are you scared?
[14:41.000 --> 14:42.000]  Are you frightened?
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.000]  He said, you know what?
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  I hope I get away with it, but there are some things bigger than me.
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  He said this to me.
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  Beautiful.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  He said, there are some things bigger than me.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  And you know what's happened in the last few hours?
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  I've already had a dozen more people email me.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  And I think you're seeing a watershed moment right now, right here today.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  As I said, you were people.
[15:00.000 --> 15:06.000]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is a watershed moment because more whistleblowers have come forward.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  I'm told it's even more devastating.
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  And Google is working with Facebook and Twitter.
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  We've confirmed to block anyone trying to upload the video or anyone trying to share it.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  But here's the good news.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  DrudgeReport.com right in the middle column has red-linked it all.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  So it stands out.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  Update.
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  Inside reveals Google plan to prevent Trump situation in 2020.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Manipulative Algorithm.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  YouTube pulls video.
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  Corporate media ignores.
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.000]  The Corporate Media Ignores article is a Jamie White infowars.com article.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  And we're adding to that the banned video.
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  And we're adding the James O'Keefe full interview to that article.

[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[16:02.000 --> 16:08.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.000]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[16:11.000 --> 16:12.000]  Bill Hyde here.
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.000]  right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  So here's what you should do right now.
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[16:49.000 --> 16:50.000]  And the best part?

[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventive
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[18:22.000 --> 18:23.000]  That's it.
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:28.000 --> 18:29.000]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.000 --> 18:30.000]  I agree entirely.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.000]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  You've won a lot of battles.
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  And there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.000]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War, and even if something does happen to you or your show,
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.000]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[18:57.000 --> 19:26.000]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[19:27.000 --> 19:54.000]  Thank you.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  We need the funding. Thank you for your support.
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[19:59.000 --> 20:03.000]  We're not going to back down.
[20:03.000 --> 20:23.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  He said, there are some things bigger than me.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  And you know what's happened in the last few hours?
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  I've already had a dozen more people email me.
[20:30.000 --> 20:35.000]  And I think you're seeing a watershed moment right now, right here today, as I said,
[20:35.000 --> 20:38.000]  where people are going to come forward, Alex,
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  because they want the people to know what's going on.
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  You said it, James. It's not high.
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  You can feel the history.
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  This is watershed.
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.000]  And all the whistleblowers, it's now just cascading.
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  And you look at the arrogance of their head of censorship under this Orwellian term,
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  and she goes, it doesn't matter what Congress does.
[20:56.000 --> 21:01.000]  Well, you notice Sundar wouldn't even go to Congress a year ago and testify.
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.000]  And then they gave all the secrets that the Pentagon had given them to the Chinese
[21:04.000 --> 21:09.000]  with their dragonfly operation, their censorship office, and their AI project.
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  And then now suddenly they're having to grovel a bit at the executive level,
[21:12.000 --> 21:17.000]  but still their employees, like you said, are programmed cult members still carrying this out.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  This is incredible.
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  Their words not yours.
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  They say that they're trying to quote, program the people.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  And one of the things that Janai says is the reasons we launched the artificial intelligence principles,
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  there it is, ML Fairness, is because people were not putting that line in the sand,
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  that they were not saying what's fair and what's equitable.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  So we're like, we're a big company. We're going to say it.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  So what Janai is saying is, don't bust us up, Elizabeth Warren.
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  By the way, I'm actually seeing what Elizabeth Warren has to say about this,
[21:44.000 --> 21:47.000]  because she's being attacked by this Google executive.
[21:47.000 --> 21:51.000]  What they're saying is, don't break us up. Don't get involved, antitrust.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  Because we need to stay the Leviathan.
[21:53.000 --> 21:58.000]  We need to be large such that we can continue to define what is real.
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  She's saying we need to be the big global monopoly to bully these evil conservatives
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  that don't want to sexualize their five-year-olds or open the borders.
[22:06.000 --> 22:11.000]  Yes, she's saying keep us large so that we can change the outcome.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  If 2016 happened again, would the outcome be...
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  I love you guys, producer. Your producers are so fast.
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  You pull it up as soon as I'm bringing it up.
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  If the algorithms happened again, would we have a different outcome than 2016?
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.000]  That's the quote.
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  And Alex, I think there's going to be hearings as a result of this.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  I think there's going to be whistleblowers, I think.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  And I've known you for nine or ten years.
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  I don't think you think. The dam has broken.
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[22:36.000 --> 22:42.000]  I really think this is the moment that we have been waiting for, where the hero is amongst us.
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  Because it's one thing, Alex, if I infiltrate or I go undercover,
[22:45.000 --> 22:49.000]  this is them. This is them giving us the information.
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  So I'm just really excited, and I know there's going to be more news to break.
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  No, I agree. Remember two years ago, you brought it out and it later came out in the news.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  Google is more afraid of whistleblowers than anybody,
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.000]  and is running NSA-level spying on their own people.
[23:04.000 --> 23:09.000]  I think what we really need, though, is we need people to contact Google.
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  Your listeners are, what can I do? What can I do?
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  Well, other than blow the whistle inside a company, I think,
[23:15.000 --> 23:21.000]  and you can do that by sending us an encrypted email, veritas-tips-at-protonmail.com.
[23:21.000 --> 23:22.000]  Beautiful.
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.000]  But what I think what we need to do is, I think if you just press,
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  I think it's, I don't have the email address in front of me,
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  but the press office at Google, we've got to email them and get a comment.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  We've got to get a statement from Google about this. We've got to get a reaction.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  Well, they're going to try to cover this up,
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  but internally this is going to run through all their employees, and they know they're in a cult.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  They know it's getting more out of control.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  Let's shift to the minutes we have left, and please come back soon.
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  Oh, you're working very hard. James O'Keefe Project, veritas.com.
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.000]  The audience here can override the AI, and that's why you're here.
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.000]  The audience has to email this, Facebook at call talk radio, call C-SPAN, call the White House.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  Trump has to act now on this.
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  I mean, this, like you said, congressional hearings coming in July.
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  You've got Congress people calling you, obviously senators calling you.
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  You have given them the mother load.
[24:05.000 --> 24:09.000]  This is like Al Capone being caught, you know, with his, with dead bodies.
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  But most people are on the take.
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.000]  I mean, right? That's the whole, the New York Times is supposed to be no fear or favor.
[24:15.000 --> 24:20.000]  The bottom line is most people in this country are either afraid, or they are on the take.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  That Google is such a powerful company.
[24:22.000 --> 24:28.000]  I mean, most people are afraid that they publish a story about a company that can censor and define their income,
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  because most distribution happens to the social media companies.
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  So Project Veritas does not have any advertisers.
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  I can't be boycott. I can't be bought or sold.
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  I refuse to compromise on my principles.
[24:39.000 --> 24:42.000]  I refuse to settle lawsuits, Alex. I've won five lawsuits.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  I'll go all the way to a jury verdict, which I did and I won.
[24:45.000 --> 24:51.000]  And I think that people are, that the Goliath fears the little guy if the little guy stands on principle, right?
[24:51.000 --> 24:56.000]  Oh, I got to say in these games that people want to see a thoroughbred Americana hero and a crew that have gone through the fire.
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  You're it. InfoWars has done it. Only a few others.
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.000]  You are the example. And we just salute you and thank you for all your courage and everything you've done.
[25:05.000 --> 25:10.000]  And I guess you've got even, I'm told, you told me a few months ago, really big stuff coming.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  What else is coming? Big stuff?
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  All these people are coming to me in the last 24 hours, more insiders.
[25:17.000 --> 25:24.000]  Yes, I just learned last night there's another person in the company that wants to come forward.
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.000]  It doesn't get better than that. VeritasTips at protonmail.com.
[25:28.000 --> 25:36.000]  I urge you, if you work for one of these organizations and you do want to tell the truth to people, contact us. We'll work with you.
[25:36.000 --> 25:43.000]  James, fabulous. I admire you and your whole crew. You are the blood of freedom. We salute you.
[25:43.000 --> 25:51.000]  The reason why I decided to come to Project Veritas is because people need to know what's actually going on with Google.
[25:51.000 --> 25:59.000]  There's this facade about what they're doing, but what they're actually doing, what the employees are actually seeing inside the company, is different.
[25:59.000 --> 26:05.000]  The reason we launched our AI principles is because people were not putting a line in the sign that they were not saying it's fair and exact.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  So we're like, well, we are a big company. We're going to say it.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  People so open for the current president do not agree with our definition of heritage.
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.000]  They're not objective piece. They're not an objective source of information.
[26:18.000 --> 26:26.000]  But then there are teams. It's about M.L. Fairness. M.L. Fairness. Fairness. You know, you need to be fair.
[26:26.000 --> 26:34.000]  If we were also training our algorithms like this 2016 company again, it wouldn't be different.
[26:34.000 --> 26:42.000]  They are a highly biased political machine that is bent on never letting somebody like Donald Trump come to power again.
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.000]  2020 is certainly on top of my old organization, Justice 80, on top of mine.
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  They've been working on it since 2016 to make sure we're ready for 2020.
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.000]  This is a Goliathime, but a David trying to say that the emperor has no clothes.
[26:57.000 --> 27:04.000]  He got called in for the Congress multiple times, making pressures for not changing.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  Being a small ant, I can be crushed and I'm aware of that.
[27:08.000 --> 27:14.000]  But this is something that is bigger than me. This is something that needs to be said to the American public.
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  Elizabeth Warren is saying that we should break up Google.
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  I love her, but she's very misguided. That will not make it better. It will make it worse.
[27:23.000 --> 27:30.000]  Because now all these smaller companies, we don't have the same resources that we do, will be charged with preventing the next sort of situation.
[27:30.000 --> 27:40.000]  And it's like...
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.000]  Earlier this year, a Facebook insider exposed deboosting of conservatives on Facebook.
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.000]  That insider inspired someone at Pinterest to come to Prajaparatas with his story.
[27:59.000 --> 28:08.000]  Last week, we released a report from the Pinterest insider Eric Cochran detailing censorship of pro-life and Christian content.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  The tech companies can't fight us all.
[28:11.000 --> 28:20.000]  Today, we bring you a Google Insider, a brave man who came forward and brought us a story that will scare you.
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  I think sunlight is the best disinfectant and people need to start asking questions.
[28:24.000 --> 28:32.000]  A couple weeks before the Google Insider came forward, Prajaparatas secretly recorded with Jen Jenai, a Google executive.
[28:32.000 --> 28:59.000]  Jenai talks about making sure when people search for things...
[28:59.000 --> 29:05.000]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.000]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[29:10.000 --> 29:18.000]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[29:18.000 --> 29:26.000]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[29:26.000 --> 29:37.000]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[29:37.000 --> 29:47.000]  Don't miss this one. Stake your claim today. Call 800-600-3388. That's 800-600-3388. These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[29:47.000 --> 29:52.000]  Call now 800-600-3388. 800-600-3388.
[29:52.000 --> 30:00.000]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell the security which requires an offering document.
[30:00.000 --> 30:05.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[30:05.000 --> 30:24.000]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[30:24.000 --> 30:39.000]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart. I want you to know that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[30:39.000 --> 30:50.000]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important. The enemy could win. We're a key chess piece in this fight. We're being used by God. You're being used by God.
[30:50.000 --> 30:55.000]  This is Providence, so I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[30:55.000 --> 31:00.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[31:00.000 --> 31:12.000]  Infowars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so. It's Orwellian. It's biblical. It's authoritarian. It's insane.
[31:12.000 --> 31:25.000]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking. I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat.
[31:25.000 --> 31:33.000]  But this is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, Infowars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[31:33.000 --> 31:39.000]  And so we've reached that point. It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we have withstood so many of their attacks.
[31:39.000 --> 31:45.000]  We've gone through so much because of your support. You have, you have been there, but let me tell you, they are pissed.
[31:45.000 --> 31:48.000]  They haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault.
[31:48.000 --> 31:55.000]  So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now at infoworksport.com. It's your fight.
[31:55.000 --> 32:00.000]  Decide whether or not you want Infowars to continue because we could be shut down.
[32:00.000 --> 32:10.000]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[32:10.000 --> 32:19.000]  The false claim that you purposely sent kitty porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false.
[32:19.000 --> 32:24.000]  It's a smear. Somebody sends you something that's encrypted. You don't even open it.
[32:24.000 --> 32:31.000]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents and then it's blamed on you. This is Kafkaesque.
[32:31.000 --> 32:38.000]  This is bizarre. But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say, Jones sent kitty porn is really outrageous.
[32:38.000 --> 32:44.000]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified.
[32:44.000 --> 32:48.000]  But I wonder, where are the big boys? Where's the Wall Street Journal? Where's Associated Press?
[32:48.000 --> 32:54.000]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate?
[32:54.000 --> 33:19.000]  So we both need your help and I urge folks to continue to support Infowars with your dollars.
[33:24.000 --> 33:35.000]  Let's go back to DrudgeReport.com for TV viewers, for radio listeners. I'm going to read these links out.
[33:35.000 --> 33:44.000]  Now, when I smell blood, I smell blood. Easier way to say it is like the colonel in Apocalypse Now goes,
[33:44.000 --> 34:01.000]  I love the smell of napalm. Napalm in the morning smells like victory. I smell victory. I smell big victory.
[34:01.000 --> 34:16.000]  Big time. You have the head of Google censorship saying we're going to stop Trump being reelected and saying we don't care what Congress does.
[34:16.000 --> 34:26.000]  We're going to keep doing it. That's the zealot criminal focus and conviction of these people to engage in mutiny against this republic
[34:26.000 --> 34:32.000]  and not let nationalist conservatives and Christians communicate. In fact, I didn't even get to it yesterday.
[34:32.000 --> 34:37.000]  Well, you guys bring me yesterday's stack. Without even looking for it, it was all over the news.
[34:37.000 --> 34:47.000]  Mainline Christian sites being censored by Google, Apple, Twitter, YouTube, all of it.
[34:47.000 --> 34:53.000]  This is the takeover. The Internet is telecommunications. It is the modern communication systems.
[34:53.000 --> 35:00.000]  It's already replaced landlines. And they're coming in saying on the WhatsApp owned by Facebook and other systems,
[35:00.000 --> 35:06.000]  we're going to control what you can say live over an app talking to one person.
[35:06.000 --> 35:12.000]  They now have AI systems that are censoring person to person.
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.000]  What do you think Facebook was saying two months ago when they said you will no longer say Alex Jones's name
[35:18.000 --> 35:26.000]  or M4Wars.com unless it's negative. If it's negative, you're allowed to.
[35:26.000 --> 35:36.000]  My God, again, that is beyond a Jim Jones cult. That is beyond the worst stuff we heard about the branch of Indians.
[35:36.000 --> 35:43.000]  That is beyond what goes on in the old Soviet Union. That is crazy. Oh, but the Koch brothers.
[35:43.000 --> 35:49.000]  I never played that last week. Can we queue up a Tucker Carlson goes after the Koch brothers?
[35:49.000 --> 35:54.000]  Because if I had a dollar for every time I got an email or somebody told me that I work for the Koch brothers,
[35:54.000 --> 36:00.000]  I'd have a million dollars. The Koch brothers were the Clinton's biggest financiers.
[36:00.000 --> 36:06.000]  The Koch brothers were deeply in bed with the Democrats. They wanted monopolies.
[36:06.000 --> 36:14.000]  The Koch brothers want open borders where you subsidize their workers, their illegal alien workers, their total fake libertarians,
[36:14.000 --> 36:23.000]  not good little L but big L. They're corporate raiders. They make their money off corporate money that they get through
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.000]  crony capitalism and government contracts and subsidies paid to illegal aliens.
[36:28.000 --> 36:37.000]  And the Koch brothers finance all the big think tanks and work with the neocons to try to defeat Trump.
[36:37.000 --> 36:45.000]  They gave their money to Hillary. But I always have leftist, tautle up to me and say,
[36:45.000 --> 36:52.000]  oh, you work for the Koch brothers, the Koch brothers. The Koch brothers are neocons.
[36:52.000 --> 36:58.000]  The Koch brothers, let me explain this. They're just like Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett always says, I mail a check every year
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  for a few thousand dollars of the treasury because I don't pay enough taxes.
[37:02.000 --> 37:08.000]  Then he structures things where he pays zero tax himself, takes the capital gains offshore,
[37:08.000 --> 37:16.000]  and was the biggest recipient of the banker bailout, 300 plus million dollars the first year,
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  and then he got 180 something million the next year in the bailout.
[37:20.000 --> 37:27.000]  It comes out to 400 plus billion dollars, almost 500 billion that Warren Buffett got.
[37:27.000 --> 37:34.000]  Look it up. Type in Warren Buffett, biggest recipient of banker bailout, click Google Web,
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  and you'll get it if they haven't censored that.
[37:37.000 --> 37:43.000]  Oh, but he hadn't paid enough taxes. He wants the middle class making $100,000 a year to pay more taxes
[37:43.000 --> 37:49.000]  because he swindles it up into his coffers, and that's how the Koch brothers work.
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  In fact, let's just, since I mentioned it, let's play the Tucker Carlson piece,
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  to understand crony capitalist versus real capitalist.
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  And then you've got the Koch brothers saying they're against crony capitalist,
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  but they want open borders and illegal aliens in here.
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.000]  They want open borders, and then we subsidize them all with welfare and food stamps,
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.000]  and then they work in their paper mills and their meat packing plants and their facilities.
[38:13.000 --> 38:20.000]  That goes up on newswars.com. Tucker calls out Koch brothers for working with the ADL to censor conservative online.
[38:20.000 --> 38:27.000]  They're the ones. It's the Democrats in bed with the Koch brothers. Here it is.
[38:27.000 --> 38:30.000]  Charles and David Koch are two of the richest men in the world.
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  Each one of them is worth tens of billions of dollars.
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  Some of their money is inherited, much of it they made themselves.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  But to their credit, the Kochs have never been content merely to get richer.
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  They are engaged intellectuals. They have a sincere desire to change the world.
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.000]  So for years, the brothers had been the single most important funders of Republican politics in Washington and the country.
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.000]  The Koch network of donors spends hundreds of millions of dollars every election cycle.
[38:55.000 --> 39:01.000]  Virtually every major conservative nonprofit in Washington takes Koch money, often a lot of it.
[39:01.000 --> 39:05.000]  Koch organizations train political organizers and candidates.
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  Many Republican lawmakers owe their careers to the Kochs and are happy to say so.
[39:10.000 --> 39:17.000]  For people whose main business is making fertilizer and paper towels, the Kochs have been remarkably effective in American politics.
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  And not surprisingly, the left hates them for it.
[39:21.000 --> 39:28.000]  Both the Koch brothers and their families, who by the way are very nice people, have been grotesquely and repeatedly maligned by the media.
[39:28.000 --> 39:33.000]  This in turn has convinced many conservatives that the Kochs must be on their side.
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.000]  Anyone who's been slandered by the New York Times has got to be doing something right. That's the idea.
[39:38.000 --> 39:46.000]  It's not a bad standard, but in this case, in the case of the Kochs, conservatives might want to pause and rethink the relationship.
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.000]  As it turns out, the Kochs don't have much in common with conservatives.
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  They are in fact totally opposed to most conservative policy goals.
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.000]  The Kochs are libertarian ideologues. They're passionate and inflexible about what they believe.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  America first, the Kochs find the very notion of that absurd, if not fascist.
[40:04.000 --> 40:09.000]  An economic policy that seeks to strengthen families, the Kochs denounce that as quote,
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.000]  crony capitalism or picking winners and losers. They think it's immoral and they'll tell you so.
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.000]  Controlling our borders, the Kochs consider that racist.
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.000]  A few years ago, in fact, Bernie Sanders noted that the Koch brothers are far to the left of him on immigration.
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  Open borders, quote, that's a Koch brothers proposal, Bernie Sanders said.
[40:28.000 --> 40:31.000]  And he was right. But in fact, it's more than a proposal.
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.000]  It's in effect what we have now in this country, open borders, and that's thanks in part to the Kochs.
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.000]  The overwhelming majority of Republicans want to secure border unless immigration.
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.000]  That's why they voted for Donald Trump. Two and a half years later, though, the border is more porous than ever.
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.000]  A tide of humanities flooding in illegally.
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  Republicans in Congress have done almost nothing to help with the situation. Why?
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  Well, you can thank the Kochs for that.
[40:55.000 --> 41:00.000]  In 2018, Koch backed organizations, the Freedom Network and Americans for Prosperity,
[41:00.000 --> 41:07.000]  pressured Republicans in Congress to use their limited post-election lame duck session to pass an amnesty for the so-called dreamers.
[41:07.000 --> 41:13.000]  Going into this election, the 2020 race, amnesty remains the Koch's top legislative priority.
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.000]  So if you're wondering why the Republican Party often seems completely out of sync with its own voters, this is why.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  And it's not just on immigration.
[41:21.000 --> 41:27.000]  The Koch Network has also successfully pushed Republicans to join the left in going soft on crime.
[41:27.000 --> 41:33.000]  The Kochs aggressively backed the First Step Act, which is currently allowing drug traffickers to leave prison early.
[41:33.000 --> 41:37.000]  They support the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  That would cut required penalties for heroin and cocaine traffickers in half.
[41:41.000 --> 41:47.000]  Now, keep in mind, they're doing all of this in the middle of the deadliest drug epidemic in American history.
[41:47.000 --> 41:53.000]  The Kochs don't even bother to argue that these so-called reforms would help any law-abiding American in any way.
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  Well, we're going to go to break, and we're going to come back with the rest of this.
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.000]  And Robert Barnes is in studio with the fall of the House of Google.
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.000]  It could happen, at least the fall of the censors that have hijacked it and are running it.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  It's all coming up next segment.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  But we're going to finish up where he gets into the Kochs working to censor conservative speech with the ADL.
[42:12.000 --> 42:13.000]  That's right.
[42:13.000 --> 42:20.000]  So next time a leftist comes up and says, oh, you're fighting by the Koch brothers. Remember, these are ignorant moron fools, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:20.000 --> 42:28.000]  And remember, the Koch brothers know, just like the Walmart dynasty, Walmart put out memos what a decade ago,
[42:28.000 --> 42:37.000]  telling employees, oh, we pay you not enough to live on, so you qualify for food stamps and welfare so then you can live nice.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  Taxpayers subsidize Walmart.
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.000]  Taxpayers subsidize the Koch brothers. I'm sick of it. You're not libertarians.
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  What you are is the crony capitalist you claim you're fighting.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  Just like Warren, biggest recipient of the banker bailout, Buffett.
[42:52.000 --> 42:59.000]  We'll be right back, though, with Tucker getting into the Koch brothers censoring conservatives, their main enemy.
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[43:04.000 --> 43:14.000]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[43:14.000 --> 43:19.000]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[43:19.000 --> 43:29.000]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up,
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.000]  the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting Infowars.
[43:34.000 --> 43:43.000]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[43:43.000 --> 43:51.000]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[43:51.000 --> 43:59.000]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  Well, we're very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[44:02.000 --> 44:10.000]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega-counts we have through their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[44:10.000 --> 44:20.000]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year. We need it in here. We need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[44:20.000 --> 44:26.000]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin. I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[44:26.000 --> 44:31.000]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[44:31.000 --> 44:37.000]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds. I need gas. I need ammo politically now.
[44:37.000 --> 44:44.000]  But literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable. We're unstoppable together.
[44:44.000 --> 44:53.000]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy. I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and I will never back down.
[44:53.000 --> 45:00.000]  You have my commitment. This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[45:00.000 --> 45:06.000]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget this is the maximum alert. We wouldn't be here without you. I thank you for your support and your help.
[45:06.000 --> 45:14.000]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight, but we need financial support and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at infowarstore.com.
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.000]  We want to just give us straight donations. There's a P.L. box. We want to mail us a check. We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  We need money to fight back and to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.
[45:22.000 --> 45:37.000]  InfoWarsStore.com is the main page. We have a huge sale going. Save InfoWars, Super Special, Emergency Special, 50% off, all InfoWars bestselling live products, all of them, 50% off.
[45:37.000 --> 46:00.000]  We need a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night. We're not going to back down.
[46:00.000 --> 46:09.000]  Announcing the greatest show on earth, reparations, free health care, free college free homes, free money forever.
[46:09.000 --> 46:20.000]  Yay! It's Cloud World 2019, the Democratic Party's two-night extravaganza debate. Let's meet the candidates.
[46:20.000 --> 46:30.000]  All-Star Beto Root. Oh my gosh, Cory Booker, the amazing. Oh, Pocahontas. Joe Biden.
[46:30.000 --> 46:37.000]  Swallowswell says he'll nuke gun owners. Yay! Bernie Sanders loves the Soviet Union.
[46:37.000 --> 46:43.000]  Camilla Harris and so many more. It's the greatest show on earth at infowars.com.
[46:43.000 --> 46:52.000]  The greatest comedy show on earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and tons of laughs.
[46:52.000 --> 47:14.000]  June 26th and 27th, coverage starts at 7pm at infowars.com forward slash show.
[47:22.000 --> 47:37.000]  We're going to be going deep into the censorship wars.
[47:37.000 --> 47:44.000]  Next hour, the constitutional lawyer, Robert Barnes, Chief Counsel at infowars. You'll notice this here a good week out of the month.
[47:44.000 --> 47:49.000]  We'll be here for the next week. We're very honored to have him. A lot of exciting things coming up, a lot of big developments.
[47:49.000 --> 47:55.000]  You'll hear a little bit about this week and next week, but they're going to be launched coming up in about a week and a half or so.
[47:55.000 --> 48:02.000]  This is going to be a major offensive against the globalists, and obviously all of you aren't just essential. You are critical.
[48:02.000 --> 48:08.000]  You are beyond critical. You are everything that is defeating the globalists, so that's all coming up.
[48:08.000 --> 48:18.000]  I wanted to finish up with Tucker Carlson before he left the Tokyo, where he's been broadcasting from, pointing out that it's the Koch brothers that want open borders.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  It's the Koch brothers that finance the Clintons along with Tyson.
[48:22.000 --> 48:30.000]  It's the Koch brothers that are financing the fake libertarian Republican think tanks that say, oh, companies can do whatever they want,
[48:30.000 --> 48:38.000]  including censor or control or, say, the Republican Party's official policy is Nazism on the front page of Google.
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.000]  And now Drudge has moved the Project Veritas links to the top.
[48:43.000 --> 48:52.000]  So let's click on the fourth link there at drudgereport.com. LinkedIn red corporate media ignores.
[48:52.000 --> 49:01.000]  And when you scroll down in that info wars.com article, blacklisted MSM ignores Project Veritas bombshell, you see update number one.
[49:01.000 --> 49:07.000]  Fox News also blacklisted Project Veritas Google bombshell story.
[49:07.000 --> 49:16.000]  Well, you'd think almost two days into this earth shaking event, the head of Google censorship admitting that they're not going to let Trump win and how they censor people.
[49:16.000 --> 49:25.000]  We call it fairness. Update number two is the actual censored video that Congress has had to upload because Google is banning it.
[49:25.000 --> 49:30.000]  We have our own servers as Drudge advised four years ago here in studio.
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  And there it is, our own servers.
[49:33.000 --> 49:39.000]  See the video Google censored on their plans to steal 2020 election and scroll down.
[49:39.000 --> 49:45.000]  You can then see watershed event, more Google whistleblowers to go public.
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  They've pulled that off every place we've seen it posted.
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.000]  I've gotten a bunch of calls from major channels saying this is newsworthy and they're pulling it down.
[49:55.000 --> 49:59.000]  Even excerpts of it. They are scared.
[49:59.000 --> 50:12.000]  So again, everyone go to drudgereport.com, the biggest news site in the world, the second largest site in the world, and get those four links and share them and take screenshots of the front of Drudge and share it.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  And then let Facebook and Twitter censor you.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  We're getting reports of that.
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  Send us screenshots to showtipsandinfowars.com.
[50:19.000 --> 50:28.000]  That'll be big news for the congressional hearings already announced on these companies working in coordination.
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.000]  When monopoly is working coordination, it's called a cartel.
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.000]  That's the popular parlance. It's known really illegal as a combine.
[50:36.000 --> 50:42.000]  So we have these combines working in tandem right now.
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  In conjunction, it's called organized crime.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  And we've got the walls closing in.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  We say the walls close in.
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  It's not like made up Democrat talking points against Trump.
[50:51.000 --> 50:54.000]  When I started saying the walls are closing in and the blood's in the water.
[50:54.000 --> 50:57.000]  I told you yesterday before any of this was blood in the water.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  Congress will try to stop us.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  They are not going to stop anything.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  Like a supervillain bragging in a movie.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  I'm going to flood the city and kill everybody.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  And you won't stop me, Batman.
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  I mean, this is what criminals do.
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  It's why you see it in comic books.
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  It's a reflection of reality.
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  And now the archetypes are here.
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  They already lost $136 million for their censorship this month.
[51:18.000 --> 51:19.000]  They don't care.
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.000]  They don't care.
[51:20.000 --> 51:21.000]  They don't care.
[51:21.000 --> 51:22.000]  They don't care.
[51:22.000 --> 51:27.000]  They don't care.
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  They're zealots.
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  They wouldn't work with the Pentagon on AI.
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  They work with China.
[51:33.000 --> 51:37.000]  So the dyes cast in Congress is slow to wake up,
[51:37.000 --> 51:41.000]  says $70 billion, that was $136 billion just two weeks ago.
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  So it's grown since then.
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  That's an older article, April, guys.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  Click late May.
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  No, it was June.
[51:49.000 --> 51:54.720]  week of June, 136 billion lost in one day. That's your headline. I'll find it in the
[51:54.720 --> 51:58.440]  break. You're doing a great job. Click news. You'll find it. So let's finish up with Tucker
[51:58.440 --> 52:02.000]  Carlson. And then we're going to tell you what's coming up. But this is history. You
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.520]  may not be on Google. You may not have a cell phone. God bless you. There it is. Google
[52:06.520 --> 52:13.800]  Facebook, Amazon falls 136 billion over government probe. So it was all three of them together.
[52:13.800 --> 52:18.040]  But most of it was Google. So good job finding that guys. That's front page magazine. Okay,
[52:18.040 --> 52:23.120]  let's go ahead now and go to the rest of Tucker Carlson pointing out most of the so-called
[52:23.120 --> 52:26.640]  conservatives have been bought and paid for. Trump's really a populist. That's why they're
[52:26.640 --> 52:31.600]  pissed. Here it is. The Kochs don't even bother to argue that these so-called reforms would
[52:31.600 --> 52:37.080]  help any law abiding American in any way. They just believe it's the right thing, the libertarian
[52:37.080 --> 52:42.200]  thing to do. So they're pushing for it. On economics, meanwhile, you won't be surprised
[52:42.200 --> 52:45.880]  to learn that the Kochs hold views that bear no resemblance at all to what most Republican
[52:45.880 --> 52:50.720]  voters believe. The Kochs have pushed for cuts to social security in Medicare, for example.
[52:50.720 --> 52:56.280]  A vast majority of Americans are opposed to that. Most Republicans are opposed to that.
[52:56.280 --> 52:59.920]  Like almost everyone else, by the way, Republicans want lower drug prices. Drugs are expensive
[52:59.920 --> 53:03.360]  in getting more so. And yet the Kochs are working to kill a bill introduced by Senators
[53:03.360 --> 53:07.720]  Josh Hawley and Rick Scott. They'll prevent drug companies from charging Americans more
[53:07.720 --> 53:12.640]  than they charge the people of Canada or France. That seems like a fair idea to most people.
[53:12.640 --> 53:17.720]  The Kochs are preventing it from happening. Then the Kochs helped draft the 2017 tax cut.
[53:17.720 --> 53:20.960]  That turned out to be a far better deal for corporate America than it was for the American
[53:20.960 --> 53:25.680]  middle class. A majority of Republicans support capping interest rates on credit cards and
[53:25.680 --> 53:30.160]  payday loans. The Kochs think that idea is ridiculous. In fact, some years ago, when
[53:30.160 --> 53:35.160]  David Koch ran for vice president as a libertarian, abolishing all usury laws was part of his
[53:35.160 --> 53:39.520]  platform. Now, there's nothing surprising about any of this or illegitimate. It's what
[53:39.520 --> 53:44.520]  many rich liberals believe. It's just not what most Republicans believe. And that's
[53:44.520 --> 53:50.240]  a problem. Give that the Kochs are the single most powerful figures in the Republican Party.
[53:50.240 --> 53:53.840]  The Kochs don't seem interested in hearing you complain about that or anything else,
[53:53.840 --> 53:58.360]  actually. Remarkably, they have now joined the left-wing campaign against free speech
[53:58.360 --> 54:03.640]  in America. Next month, the Charles Koch Institute will hold a summit with the Anti-Defamation
[54:03.640 --> 54:09.240]  League and executives from major tech companies, including Pinterest, Airbnb, Patreon, Mozilla.
[54:09.240 --> 54:13.760]  The stated purpose of the meeting is to formulate, quote, best practices on the fight against
[54:13.760 --> 54:19.480]  hate and extremism online, end quote. But you know exactly what that really means. It
[54:19.480 --> 54:25.640]  means censorship of your views. For the left, fighting extremism always entails crushing
[54:25.640 --> 54:30.400]  normal conservatives. That's why Pinterest has censored live action. It's why Patreon
[54:30.400 --> 54:35.440]  banned Milo Yiannopoulos. It's why Mozilla drove out Brendan Eich for the crime of donating
[54:35.440 --> 54:41.000]  to the wrong political campaign. Big tech has become a far greater threat to your freedom
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.840]  than the federal government. The Kochs don't care about that. Nothing Google does violates
[54:45.840 --> 54:50.440]  libertarian orthodoxy. More to the point, the Kochs don't care about Republican voters
[54:50.440 --> 54:57.040]  or what happens to them. Okay, that's fine. No law requiring them to care. But then why
[54:57.040 --> 55:01.400]  are they running the Republican Party? That's a question Republicans should start asking
[55:01.400 --> 55:02.400]  themselves.
[55:02.400 --> 55:07.160]  Well, Tucker Carlson is amazing. And he's a national treasure. He's going through a
[55:07.160 --> 55:14.480]  lot behind the scenes. Antifa is a set to attack his house on July 4th. Literally, they've
[55:14.480 --> 55:20.160]  got an army trying to shut down Trump's celebration of America event. And they intend to go over
[55:20.160 --> 55:26.360]  to his house and attack it. And I'm going to leave it at that. That story's up on newswords.com.
[55:26.360 --> 55:31.440]  We're going to break them back with Robert Barnes for the next hour with the man that
[55:31.440 --> 55:37.160]  wrote the U.S. Biological Weapons Treaty. And he was an expert on war crimes. Dr. Francis
[55:37.160 --> 55:44.920]  Boyle will join us to break down how smart it was that Trump did not strike Iran. And
[55:44.920 --> 55:52.120]  then syndicated radio and TV host will be joining us after that to talk about some of
[55:52.120 --> 55:58.520]  the latest setups in the left financing extremist groups to demonize the mainline right wing.
[55:58.520 --> 56:04.440]  That's at least train a hand coming up at Robert Barnes on the other side. Please don't forget.
[56:04.440 --> 56:12.800]  Please don't forget that this is war. We're delivering. I told you this Veritas thing would
[56:12.800 --> 56:17.360]  have congressional hearings and would devastate them. And I can feel it spiritually, okay,
[56:17.360 --> 56:22.360]  at a gut level. I know when something's a winner. If you get involved, if you share
[56:22.360 --> 56:26.640]  the links, if you call, talk radio, if you keep this project Veritas video alive, that's
[56:26.640 --> 56:31.080]  linked at info wars dot com. If you get the link at the middle of drugs report dot com,
[56:31.080 --> 56:35.920]  linked in red, media is ignoring this. We show what they're ignoring. If you humanly promote
[56:35.920 --> 56:42.040]  that corporate media ignores that link right there. They're done. This is them admitting
[56:42.040 --> 56:46.800]  your crime still in the election. And if you financially support us and get great products
[56:46.800 --> 56:50.640]  you already need, whatever the highest rated water filter is, I go out and buy it and bulk

[56:58.280 --> 57:04.440]  hundreds. Why is Jones doing that? Because I believe in karma, folks, report you so I
[57:04.440 --> 57:10.200]  don't sell you something unless it's the best. Do you find something more expensive? Yeah,

[57:43.360 --> 57:49.160]  of this heavyweight boxing match, we've got three rounds left and we're winning.
[57:49.160 --> 57:56.160]  Announcing the greatest show on earth, reparations, free health care, free college, free homes,
[57:56.160 --> 58:06.160]  free money forever. Yay. It's Cloud World 2019, the Democratic Party's two night extravaganza
[58:06.160 --> 58:15.160]  debate. Let's meet the candidates. All star, Beto Roy. Oh my gosh, Corey Booker, the amazing
[58:15.160 --> 58:23.160]  show, Pocahontas, Joe Biden, Swallowswell, sister of new gun owners, yay, Bernie Sanders,
[58:23.160 --> 58:30.800]  love the Soviet Union, Camila Harris, and so many more. It's the greatest show on earth
[58:30.800 --> 58:36.400]  at infowars.com for its last show, Wednesday and Thursday night. The greatest comedy show
[58:36.400 --> 58:43.960]  on earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and tons of laughs. June 26th and 27th, coverage
[58:43.960 --> 58:53.520]  starts at 7 p.m. at infowars.com forward slash show. Infowars and free speech and your right
[58:53.520 --> 58:59.320]  to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so. It's Orwellian, it's
[58:59.320 --> 59:04.920]  biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane. And I keep trying to judge, engage, when is
[59:04.920 --> 59:10.840]  the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say,
[59:10.840 --> 59:15.400]  hey, we're sinking, I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat, but
[59:15.400 --> 59:20.280]  this is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting,
[59:20.280 --> 59:25.560]  infowars will be shut down, not just crippled. And so we've reached that point. It'll make
[59:25.560 --> 59:29.360]  the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we have stood so many of their attacks, we've
[59:29.360 --> 59:34.240]  gone through so much because of your support, you have been there. But let me tell you,
[59:34.240 --> 59:38.040]  they are pissed, they haven't been successful, and they're giving us their full assault,
[59:38.040 --> 59:44.200]  so we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now at infowarscore.com.
[59:44.200 --> 59:48.440]  It's your fight. Decide whether or not you want infowars to continue because we could
[59:48.440 --> 59:53.560]  be shut down.
[59:53.560 --> 1:00:13.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening
[1:00:13.960 --> 1:00:26.840]  to the Alex Jones show. Nobody introduces their radio show with the Duke of New York.
[1:00:26.840 --> 1:00:44.720]  Now, we're going to have a big concert of 80s techno. Whoever you want to call it, synthesizer
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:45.720]  music.
[1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:46.720]  Robert Barnes is going to have you back with us for next week. Absolutely. What a great
[1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:47.720]  American. Most stations carry this, but some don't. So we'll kind of recap the next segment,
[1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:51.240]  but I have quite a full palette here, and I know you've got a lot you want to cover
[1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:59.160]  as well, but we have the left caught running all these false flags. We've got leftists
[1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:03.920]  saying Trump raped them, but saying it's really sexy to get raped. They seem to be going insane.
[1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:07.600]  Small it. They've released incredible video. We'll play at the bottom of the hour of him
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:12.720]  and his get up with the rope around his neck. 45 minutes after he said the attack happened.
[1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:19.120]  I mean, all of this insanity is coming up. Robert Barnes constitutional lawyer. So much
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:25.200]  happening like you said two weeks ago, three weeks ago here in studio, 136 billion lost
[1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:31.160]  by big tech led by Google in just one day over censorship. They admitted to prospectus
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:35.560]  and to shareholders. They said, no, it's our censorship, but we're willing to do it. And
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:39.120]  they're their latest executive. We'll get to it next segment. The head of censorship.
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:42.480]  She says, we're willing to pay financially for this. And then Sundar was interviewed
[1:01:42.480 --> 1:01:46.880]  by CNN about it and about people rejecting their smart cities. He said, well, we don't
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:51.280]  care. We have a long-term plan. You will accept it. So they've got some real institutional
[1:01:51.280 --> 1:01:55.760]  arrogance, which I kind of like because pride goes before the fall.
[1:01:55.760 --> 1:02:00.280]  I no doubt about it. It reminds me of you going after the Google CEO in Congress just
[1:02:00.280 --> 1:02:06.480]  several months ago up in Washington, DC. So it's the Google is evil. And in fact, Google
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:11.680]  is going to have more news next week. Next week in Omaha, Nebraska, 20 attorney generals
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:17.160]  are meeting to discuss launching state antitrust investigations against Google. And many of
[1:02:17.160 --> 1:02:21.320]  them on the Republican or the conservative or other side of the aisle. So they're serious
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:24.760]  about it. So the degree of investigations that they're going to be under, they're going
[1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:28.960]  to be under antitrust investigation from the United States or under ongoing antitrust
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:32.880]  investigation from various European governments. They'll now be under antitrust investigation
[1:02:32.880 --> 1:02:37.200]  from anywhere from between 12 and 20 different state attorney generals. There's people
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:41.720]  look gab and other people are looking at filing antitrust suits against them civilly to sort
[1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:42.720]  of piggyback.
[1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:46.640]  And the Supreme Court, as you know, ruled not just in Apple, but they said in general,
[1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:47.640]  big tax open season.
[1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:51.600]  I no doubt about it. All the assumptions, not only that Senator Hawley has two bills
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:56.040]  pending before the Senate. One is to remove their Section 230 immunity unless they comply
[1:02:56.040 --> 1:03:01.280]  with First Amendment standards and stop censoring. The second aspect is that he is also requiring
[1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:08.960]  them to disclose in detail the amount of private information they obtain and the monetary value
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:09.960]  of that information.
[1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:16.000]  That's significant in the antitrust context because the way Google got away with its monopolistic
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:20.880]  practices was pretending it was providing a free service so that thus there was no consumer
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:24.920]  antitrust claim to be brought. The point that Senator Hawley is making is that that's completely
[1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:25.920]  a fiction.
[1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:28.240]  Because they're stealing all your data that's incredibly valuable.
[1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:32.720]  Exactly. They're monetizing it. The best example of this is if Google tried to use blockchain
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:36.360]  so that people could privately protect their own information whenever it was accessed along
[1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:40.000]  the line, then Google would immediately lose money and go bankrupt overnight.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  So the myth...
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:44.640]  Well, it'd be like if you raped someone and said no money was exchanged or something
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:45.640]  issue.
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:50.200]  Exactly. I mean, the reality is nothing about big tech is free. Big tech is very, very,
[1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:54.240]  very expensive. And the expense is that it doesn't disclose to you...
[1:03:54.240 --> 1:03:55.240]  Is your soul.
[1:03:55.240 --> 1:03:59.320]  Exactly. You're giving it away on a routine and regular basis. And because of that, that's
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:00.560]  why they're at the place of...
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:02.920]  And then it builds systems to screw you further.
[1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:07.680]  Oh, precisely. And not only that, Google has been manipulating its monopolistic power
[1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:10.920]  to not only do what it did with YouTube, which they never should have allowed the Google
[1:04:10.920 --> 1:04:16.200]  purchase of YouTube in the first place, but to use their combined power to control other...
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:20.160]  I mean, Google, not only people forget, Google owns Android. So Google owns a large market
[1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:25.760]  share of cell phones, search engines, video engines, almost any mechanism of video content
[1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:27.760]  delivery. Over 90% is Google-owned.
[1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:32.680]  And then Google uses brainwashing cults to control their employees and does not allow
[1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:35.760]  any dissension.
[1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:36.760]  Dissention is wearing a cross.
[1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:39.520]  Well, not only that, today the Wall Street Journal disclosed the number one donor for
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:43.240]  Elizabeth Sanders, the number one donor for Bernie Sanders coming up for the debates this
[1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:45.760]  week, Google employees.
[1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:49.960]  So if they're actually serious about regulating Google, why are Google employees giving them
[1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:50.960]  money?
[1:04:50.960 --> 1:04:51.960]  Did their number one...
[1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:55.680]  Sure, absolutely. That's their operatives that want censorship. That's their Trojanors.
[1:04:55.680 --> 1:04:59.080]  That's their Briar Patch.
[1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:06.200]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee. And luckily,
[1:05:06.200 --> 1:05:11.320]  our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stocked full of high quality, Info Wars
[1:05:11.320 --> 1:05:14.600]  store, Patriot Blend coffee.
[1:05:14.600 --> 1:05:21.320]  Even in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO

[1:06:04.600 --> 1:06:34.560]  That promo is about 10 years old.
[1:06:34.560 --> 1:07:00.680]  It's
[1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:08.400]  meaningful, saying life's beautiful, but I have articles up on infowars.com and newswars.com
[1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:17.160]  where famous pedophile writers that write about sex with children, because sex with
[1:07:17.160 --> 1:07:22.960]  children is illegal, but they write these sick novels and those are legal, salivating
[1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:29.960]  over Desmond is amazing, the little kid that they bring to the pedo bars, and one of my
[1:07:29.960 --> 1:07:35.840]  writers wrote an article about it for newswars.com and it got flooded with the left saying, oh
[1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:42.960]  Jones, there's the headline, pedophile author says 11 year old drag queen Desmond is hot,
[1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:48.000]  we're getting far from just a celebration of gender diversity, and on the info wars
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:55.900]  comments, it's spammed with Jones, you're the one caught with child porn. No, I'm the
[1:07:55.900 --> 1:08:03.440]  one sent child porn right after I got sued with hidden links that we couldn't find, and
[1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:07.960]  then once they subpoenaed it, they found it and put it in the news and said I sent it
[1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:11.520]  to Sandy Hook parents. No, they were never sent it, their lawyers were sent it hidden
[1:08:11.520 --> 1:08:17.000]  in emails sent to me right after I got sued last year, and then they sued and scanned
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:22.680]  it to find the hidden links. Oh, and the same law firm, I'm not saying they planted that,
[1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:27.080]  the media's gotten that wrong, but that same law firm had a transcript made for the court
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:32.520]  last week saying when I said white Jew boy, talking about their lawyers when they got
[1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:38.480]  me sanctioned, the judge agrees, he said this is terrible, and it turned out we don't know
[1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:43.560]  where the transcript came from, it was unsigned just given to the court, but we had two other
[1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:49.480]  court mainline groups that do it in Connecticut, they all said white shoe boy, which means
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:58.720]  a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant from Yale or Harvard, typically lawyers who wear white
[1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:03.320]  shoes in their fraternities, and they've had to retract that in raw story and a bunch
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:06.960]  of other publications, the reason I reopened this hour before we get into net censorship,
[1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:12.120]  the web, the globalists want to censor us off the internet so we can't respond when
[1:09:12.120 --> 1:09:16.640]  they put out outrageous lies, but imagine they've confirmed Koskof and Koskof, the
[1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:23.320]  most powerful firm in Connecticut, Democrats, former federal prosecutors appointed by Democrats,
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:28.760]  brought forward a transcript of unknown providence, but Robert Barnes, Constitutional Lawyer believes
[1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:32.440]  he knows who, so we've caught him before, and entered into the record for the national
[1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:41.440]  news, who says white shoe boy, the terms never been used, white shoe boy is known in the vernacular
[1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:49.160]  in Connecticut, meaning elites from Yale, and is the different differential, not Jewish
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:53.960]  or Semitic, but Anglo-Saxon, I mean this is unbelievable.
[1:09:53.960 --> 1:09:57.120]  I mean white shoe is old school country club, the kind of people that were anti-Semitic
[1:09:57.120 --> 1:10:02.640]  historically, that your old sort of literally meant the sort of white shoe law firms that
[1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:07.600]  held themselves out as being prestigious, as being of a certain, and isn't that a perfect
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:08.600]  inversion though?
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:14.240]  Oh, completely, it's no one would ever say white shoe boy, that's not a common phrase
[1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:18.920]  that doesn't make any sense, every single person who heard the broadcast, watched the
[1:10:18.920 --> 1:10:23.280]  broadcast knew it meant white shoe, and the end of the lawyer it was being discussed about
[1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:27.560]  is not Jewish at all, I mean none of it made any sense in terms of what the falsification
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:31.560]  of the transcript was, and the people who tried to run fake news stories knew that, corrected
[1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:35.440]  it themselves quickly when they were called on the carpet for it, so the question is how
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:40.400]  did this fake transcript get into the court record, where did it come from?
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:42.640]  Because later the law firms also corrected themselves.
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:45.560]  Where did the child porn come from, sent to our servers?
[1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:50.440]  There's no question that there's an effort, an onslaught of people whose interest is outside
[1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:54.640]  of the legal environment, this isn't necessarily the lawyers or the court actors or others,
[1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:59.040]  but there's been an effort in the press, there's been an effort by political adversaries to
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:03.560]  target you in a discriminant and disparate way, there's no question that's the case,
[1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:06.880]  there's no other way to describe it or define it, you look at what's happened in terms of
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:10.760]  hacking attempts, you look at what's happened in the bogus emails that were being sent,
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:15.760]  you look at what happened in attempts to entrap attempts to set up, all of them fit a similar
[1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:19.640]  pattern of behavior, and it's where the left is going these days, where they deliberately
[1:11:19.640 --> 1:11:24.600]  send false emails or false information or put false comments, fake comments on websites
[1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:27.880]  to try to make it look like the audience is threatening someone, and by the way they
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:32.080]  admit they're doing this, yeah in fact they brag about it, I mean that's where you see
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:37.080]  Carter, you saw reporters who went after Tucker Carlson, you saw other reporters who've gone
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:42.000]  after Stephen Crowder, all of them brag about how they want to de-platform people, their
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:46.640]  goal is to de-platform people, and part of that de-platforming is defaming them.
[1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:50.880]  Alright and exactly, and the reason I brought myself up is, because I'm sick of hearing
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:54.920]  about it just like you are, the tricks are going to get dirtier, they're getting more
[1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:59.360]  desperate, now let's shift gears to the big enchilada, I have so much world news to get
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:02.960]  to, a bunch of other guests coming on, but I'm so glad that Mr. Barnes is here, our
[1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:07.400]  chief legal counsel, working on some of our counter-offenses that are being announced
[1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:11.480]  the next few weeks, it was the best defense's good offense, but that'll be unveiled the
[1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:14.440]  next week or so while he's in the studio.
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:18.920]  How do you quantify, recap how big this Google is, am I right, this is blood in the water,
[1:12:18.920 --> 1:12:24.040]  a Death Star being blown up, level event, you mean that is a political allegory, not literally,
[1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:27.600]  that they've been caught with their head of censorship, saying screw Congress, we're
[1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:31.480]  gonna do it anyways, we'll stop cover being re-elected, we're censoring everyone because
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:36.240]  that's fair, using our welly in terms, they've lost $137 billion, the other companies are
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:41.560]  hemorrhaging out, but they can't stop, Drudge is top link to it, Fox News still not covering
[1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:47.040]  Project Veritas Google bombshell, that's linked in the DrudgeReport.com article, where Google
[1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:51.880]  has taken down the video showing their chief executive over censorship, admitting the censorship
[1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:57.640]  arrogantly, I mean, as a guy that goes on the offense and the defense, as a defense
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:02.880]  lawyer and as a litigant, am I wrong saying this is a holy grail video for Project Veritas?
[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:06.480]  If it wasn't a holy grail video, you wouldn't have, Google wouldn't have censored it, you
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:09.600]  wouldn't have Google removing it from YouTube, after it had a million views in less than
[1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:14.640]  24 hours, you wouldn't have mainstream, and 99% likes, exactly, and you wouldn't have
[1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:18.920]  mainstream media refusing to cover it, you had New York Times reporters making embarrassing
[1:13:18.920 --> 1:13:25.560]  fools of themselves on social media yesterday, including on Twitter, exposing how little
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:29.020]  little technology they had, they're basically saying, oh, this couldn't be what this says
[1:13:29.020 --> 1:13:30.020]  it is, right?
[1:13:30.020 --> 1:13:33.280]  And you had a bunch of software engineers responding, that's not an algorithm, it's people going
[1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:37.520]  in and deleting and blocking things, precisely, it's manipulating the algorithm for the purposes
[1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:42.400]  of creating a fake news story, which by the way, is its own form of libel years ago, a
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:47.480]  major lawyer, it's Gadnarps wrote a law review article, and they represent and do a lot of
[1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:52.240]  work for Google, admitting that a potential source of Google's liability would be if they
[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:57.040]  were manipulating the algorithm to put people's names or impressions and create a false light
[1:13:57.040 --> 1:14:01.840]  impression of various individuals, that is precisely what James O'Keefe and Project Veritas
[1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:06.920]  documented in detail, and this evidence is so compelling, that the entire mainstream
[1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:11.840]  press has to pretend it doesn't exist, because this discredits their entire operating system,
[1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:16.960]  and you've got all the other big tech is blocking, Facebook and Twitter right now are working
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:19.800]  over time, so is Apple blocking this information.
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:26.000]  It's real collusion, it's big tech, big media collusion to enforce their economic and gatekeeping
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:31.160]  cartel on information and data in the social media public square of today.
[1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:34.600]  So if you needed any further proof that this is what this is, this is the real collusion
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:41.040]  scandal, election meddling scandal of 2020, and it was really the potential one of 2016,
[1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:43.560]  probably did happen in 2017 and 2018.
[1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:45.680]  But it wasn't enough, I mean, that's why they panicked.
[1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:49.440]  Exactly, and then they're accelerating it to new levels while denying that they're doing
[1:14:49.440 --> 1:14:51.240]  it, while pretending that they're not doing it.
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:53.040]  But now they're at least scared.
[1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:55.880]  No doubt, because if they weren't scared, they wouldn't be censoring the video.
[1:14:55.880 --> 1:15:00.200]  If they weren't scared, they wouldn't have requested their big media allies completely
[1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:01.200]  sit on this.
[1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:04.840]  Was I right to celebrate when I first saw this yesterday morning, just at a gut level
[1:15:04.840 --> 1:15:09.200]  I smelled blood, and now the Streisand effects totally kicked in, Congress is having hearings
[1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:14.280]  are announced, everyone's posting it, they're still trying to censor it and play whack-a-mole
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:18.400]  when the lights are all on, it's like cockroaches are on the table eating the cake, you turn
[1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:20.000]  the light on, they just keep eating.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:24.560]  Oh exactly, and the person who actually is the main whistleblower, accidental whistleblower,
[1:15:24.560 --> 1:15:29.080]  because they're undercover videotape, has admitted that it's accurate, hasn't challenged
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:33.120]  or contested any aspect of what it said, yes, they caught me, so they all know it's true,
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:34.120]  they all know it's accurate.
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:36.400]  That's right, they said you caught me, but I'm not powerful.
[1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:40.560]  Exactly, that was their excuse, their excuse was don't really worry about it, yes it's
[1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:46.560]  true, but it's not really, really true, you know, it's a totally Orwellian word.
[1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:52.880]  Oh my, folks, if you get the video out from Rudgerport.com, if you share our article
[1:15:52.880 --> 1:15:57.040]  with Rudgerport.com, it's over for good, over.

[1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:15.960]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.

[1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:28.520]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale

[1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:28.040]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:17:28.040 --> 1:17:31.960]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:17:31.960 --> 1:17:33.520]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:36.480]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:17:36.480 --> 1:17:39.720]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[1:17:39.720 --> 1:17:42.000]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:43.320]  I can help you too.
[1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:46.320]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:48.560]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:17:48.560 --> 1:17:59.080]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:17:59.080 --> 1:18:03.120]  I just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against
[1:18:03.120 --> 1:18:04.120]  this.
[1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:07.840]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off but we make
[1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:11.120]  only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:15.440]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton of it, okay?
[1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:19.520]  If you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get $20,000, that doesn't
[1:18:19.520 --> 1:18:21.960]  pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew.
[1:18:21.960 --> 1:18:24.960]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars a product.
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:29.160]  I want to expand, not contract and for six months we've not been able to stand still.
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:33.680]  The enemy's been winning and I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:34.680]  I like to be expanding.
[1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:35.680]  I like to be winning.
[1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:36.680]  I like to be fighting.
[1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:37.680]  And we are winning the Info War.
[1:18:37.680 --> 1:18:38.680]  That's why we're so hated.
[1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:39.680]  But we need to be retreaded.
[1:18:39.680 --> 1:18:40.680]  We need to be tuned up.
[1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:42.200]  We need to be fixed up.
[1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:43.520]  We never have time to get into drive up.
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:48.400]  We got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really
[1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:50.000]  going to plant child porn on us.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:51.880]  Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else.
[1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:55.280]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign
[1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:56.280]  banks and the Chai comms.
[1:18:56.280 --> 1:18:59.000]  So go to infowarsstore.com.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:02.960]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[1:19:02.960 --> 1:19:07.320]  The other thing that's unique about Infowars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[1:19:07.320 --> 1:19:11.200]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed
[1:19:11.200 --> 1:19:14.640]  by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:16.560]  It is completely independent of all that.
[1:19:16.560 --> 1:19:22.240]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:26.120]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[1:19:26.120 --> 1:19:30.440]  the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:32.440]  because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:35.840]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big
[1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:39.840]  corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[1:19:39.840 --> 1:19:44.400]  what news and views the person is allowed to have or express or hear and the infowars
[1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:49.200]  audience has broken through that, that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern
[1:19:49.200 --> 1:19:53.120]  age ultimate American democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[1:19:53.120 --> 1:20:19.280]  onslaught of the black warming defamation, lawfare and libel targeting you.
[1:20:19.280 --> 1:20:25.360]  I have a turn on you, you look too good to me, the media I take a copy into and I just
[1:20:25.360 --> 1:20:36.160]  can't let you be, but it's a feat for all and the heart is dead, you can bet your life,
[1:20:36.160 --> 1:20:52.960]  the heart shrink too fast is shut.
[1:20:52.960 --> 1:20:57.080]  The heart, the heart shrink in my face is a no-tear-
[1:20:57.080 --> 1:21:00.480]  Ok, lets get this serious, I got Mea Radio and TV network it's a free-for-all.
[1:21:00.480 --> 1:21:03.860]  Turns out Google isn't all powerful like they thought they were.
[1:21:03.860 --> 1:21:13.420]  Let's get serious.
[1:21:13.420 --> 1:21:14.420]  You've got the floor here.
[1:21:14.420 --> 1:21:19.020]  Let's talk about how big this is, what's coming together, the congressional hearings.
[1:21:19.020 --> 1:21:21.420]  You can smell that it blew up in their face.
[1:21:21.420 --> 1:21:25.960]  All the other news, Toronto doesn't want their smart city where you Google runs everything
[1:21:25.960 --> 1:21:27.780]  and takes control of your life.
[1:21:27.780 --> 1:21:30.140]  People's instincts are kicking in.
[1:21:30.140 --> 1:21:31.780]  Big tech's in trouble.
[1:21:31.780 --> 1:21:33.660]  Trump says he's about to take action.
[1:21:33.660 --> 1:21:38.740]  This is all perfect timing with Veritas and others and this audience have done and all
[1:21:38.740 --> 1:21:40.420]  the censorship we've witnessed.
[1:21:40.420 --> 1:21:42.700]  How do you think though Google could strike back?
[1:21:42.700 --> 1:21:43.700]  Because I smell victory.
[1:21:43.700 --> 1:21:44.700]  I feel victory.
[1:21:44.700 --> 1:21:45.700]  You agree.
[1:21:45.700 --> 1:21:46.700]  But let's get into this.
[1:21:46.700 --> 1:21:47.700]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer.
[1:21:47.700 --> 1:21:48.700]  Well, there's no doubt.
[1:21:48.700 --> 1:21:53.340]  I mean, Google's individual employees are already the leading contributors to Senator
[1:21:53.340 --> 1:21:59.180]  Sanders and Senator Warren, the supposedly anti-big tech Democratic candidates for president.
[1:21:59.180 --> 1:22:01.980]  So you're already seeing their attempts to, they've already doubled and tripled their
[1:22:01.980 --> 1:22:04.460]  lobbying budget in Washington, DC.
[1:22:04.460 --> 1:22:08.380]  So they're already trying the traditional conventional path of trying to use big money
[1:22:08.380 --> 1:22:13.540]  influence and big media connections to try to silence this dissident political effort
[1:22:13.540 --> 1:22:17.660]  to hold them responsible and accountable and bring them back to American standards of freedom
[1:22:17.660 --> 1:22:22.780]  and in the Democratic experiment in terms of antitrust litigation and investigation
[1:22:22.780 --> 1:22:26.500]  that's taking place at the federal level by the Department of Justice, also the Federal
[1:22:26.500 --> 1:22:30.380]  Trade Commission, and now being taken by the state attorney generals across the country
[1:22:30.380 --> 1:22:33.940]  who are organizing next week for the purposes of not only launching their own individual
[1:22:33.940 --> 1:22:38.740]  antitrust investigations, but to coordinate those investigations in the most effective
[1:22:38.740 --> 1:22:40.300]  and efficacious way.
[1:22:40.300 --> 1:22:44.700]  You have other competitors of Google, as was leaked today in the Wall Street Journal,
[1:22:44.700 --> 1:22:48.780]  that are going to private competitors, people like Gab, who have been discriminated against
[1:22:48.780 --> 1:22:54.500]  by Google, by Apple, by Twitter, by others, who are organizing and aggregating their information
[1:22:54.500 --> 1:22:59.500]  with other economic competitors who have been shut out and suppressed and censored or been
[1:22:59.500 --> 1:23:04.380]  unable to meaningfully compete because of the monopolistic efforts of Google and others
[1:23:04.380 --> 1:23:09.140]  to leverage their monopolistic power, to increase their monopolistic market influence
[1:23:09.140 --> 1:23:14.340]  in a wider range of areas, from their Android control to their purchase of YouTube, to their
[1:23:14.340 --> 1:23:19.180]  search market engine domination, to their creating their own Chrome browser and trying
[1:23:19.180 --> 1:23:22.660]  to force feed people into it by the way they operate their app store.
[1:23:22.660 --> 1:23:27.220]  All of this has been done to manipulate their monopolistic power to have control over people
[1:23:27.220 --> 1:23:28.340]  economically.
[1:23:28.340 --> 1:23:32.860]  But now they're taking it a step further and try to control people's thoughts, mindsets,
[1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:34.460]  votes, what news they can see.
[1:23:34.460 --> 1:23:39.580]  Their giant power grab went too far and you can see it's now collapsing.
[1:23:39.580 --> 1:23:40.580]  Absolutely.
[1:23:40.580 --> 1:23:41.580]  People are shocked by it.
[1:23:41.580 --> 1:23:46.020]  And so they are not only facing federal antitrust issues and facing state attorney generals
[1:23:46.020 --> 1:23:50.020]  launching their own independent investigative inquiries, but they're also seeing potential
[1:23:50.020 --> 1:23:53.980]  civil suits coming down that are going to be piggybacking off of those federal investigations
[1:23:53.980 --> 1:23:55.140]  and on top of that.
[1:23:55.140 --> 1:23:57.060]  And this is going to supercharge it.
[1:23:57.060 --> 1:23:58.060]  Absolutely.
[1:23:58.060 --> 1:24:01.940]  And this preside, not only that you're going to see, they also just lost a couple of weeks
[1:24:01.940 --> 1:24:05.380]  ago up in San Francisco.
[1:24:05.380 --> 1:24:09.380]  They lost a major class action case brought on behalf of James DeMore and other people
[1:24:09.380 --> 1:24:14.220]  that are talking about Google's internal hiring practices and employment practices discriminating
[1:24:14.220 --> 1:24:18.260]  against people based on ideological viewpoint and intellectual dissident thinking.
[1:24:18.260 --> 1:24:19.860]  So they're facing a major class action.
[1:24:19.860 --> 1:24:23.140]  And all the more said is, should we let conservatives have freedom?
[1:24:23.140 --> 1:24:24.140]  Exactly.
[1:24:24.140 --> 1:24:25.940]  That was asking a question is not allowed.
[1:24:25.940 --> 1:24:26.940]  Precisely.
[1:24:26.940 --> 1:24:31.660]  And now they have all of this risk from so many different angles that the last thing
[1:24:31.660 --> 1:24:36.100]  they're holding onto is they still have monopolistic influence over search engines.
[1:24:36.100 --> 1:24:38.820]  And they've been maximizing their manipulation in that arena.
[1:24:38.820 --> 1:24:40.660]  But that's very easy to prove.
[1:24:40.660 --> 1:24:41.660]  Precisely.
[1:24:41.660 --> 1:24:44.540]  In fact, that was one of my arguments yesterday with a New York Times reporter who was trying
[1:24:44.540 --> 1:24:47.500]  to deny or dispute the Project Veritas report.
[1:24:47.500 --> 1:24:49.060]  I said, just do it for yourself.
[1:24:49.060 --> 1:24:53.540]  Go to Goju Duck Duck Go, go to Bing, and then go to Google and search in any politically
[1:24:53.540 --> 1:24:57.420]  controversial topic or personality, and you'll see radically different things.
[1:24:57.420 --> 1:24:59.780]  They can do it by just searching Alex Jones.
[1:24:59.780 --> 1:25:03.700]  Search Alex Jones in Duck Duck Go or Bing, it's going to be infowars.com is going to
[1:25:03.700 --> 1:25:04.700]  be one of the top ones.
[1:25:04.700 --> 1:25:07.540]  There's going to be a mixture of positive and negative articles.
[1:25:07.540 --> 1:25:09.620]  And there's going to be a lot of info wars links.
[1:25:09.620 --> 1:25:13.660]  And if you go into Google search engine, and by the way, this was caught a couple of weeks
[1:25:13.660 --> 1:25:18.660]  ago because right after Google, the antitrust investigation was announced.
[1:25:18.660 --> 1:25:22.500]  For a couple of days, Google changed their algorithm to quit manipulating searches related
[1:25:22.500 --> 1:25:23.500]  to Alex Jones.
[1:25:23.500 --> 1:25:25.140]  And it went back to the way of merit.
[1:25:25.140 --> 1:25:26.140]  We were all the top ones.
[1:25:26.140 --> 1:25:27.140]  Exactly.
[1:25:27.140 --> 1:25:30.540]  But then the ADL bitch and the Southern Prairie Law Center bitch and Media Matters bitch,
[1:25:30.540 --> 1:25:31.540]  they flipped it back.
[1:25:31.540 --> 1:25:32.540]  Precisely.
[1:25:32.540 --> 1:25:35.980]  And so now the easiest proof is the Alex Jones search, but you can also search different
[1:25:35.980 --> 1:25:40.340]  things related to Donald Trump, Hillary, Hillary Clinton, related to emails.
[1:25:40.340 --> 1:25:41.340]  You'll get different things.
[1:25:41.340 --> 1:25:44.820]  I mean, like right now you'll search and it'll say, if you sir, a man can get pregnant, whereas
[1:25:44.820 --> 1:25:47.100]  it'll search a woman can do man activities.
[1:25:47.100 --> 1:25:50.940]  I mean, these are just wide ranging social ideological manipulation.
[1:25:50.940 --> 1:25:53.540]  It's because nothing against men to think they're women.
[1:25:53.540 --> 1:25:58.500]  I'm a libertarian at that point, but they admit the San Francisco deal, like half the executives
[1:25:58.500 --> 1:26:03.140]  are transvestites or whatever you call it, transitional people.
[1:26:03.140 --> 1:26:04.900]  I mean, it's a cult.
[1:26:04.900 --> 1:26:09.500]  I am wondering if it was a group, it's one half of 1% or whatever, how it's the new ruling
[1:26:09.500 --> 1:26:10.500]  class.
[1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:14.740]  Men that think they're women on women's hormones, that that's the new, who would write a science
[1:26:14.740 --> 1:26:19.180]  fiction book like that with men with handbags with private jet copters and you know, have
[1:26:19.180 --> 1:26:24.460]  executed, okay, but it's okay because they're like, oh, I have handbags.
[1:26:24.460 --> 1:26:27.740]  I mean, who would make up a nightmare scenario like that?
[1:26:27.740 --> 1:26:28.740]  It's very dystopian.
[1:26:28.740 --> 1:26:34.060]  And to a certain degree, it's the old debate, the old Edmund Burkean debate between conservatism
[1:26:34.060 --> 1:26:40.300]  and liberalism, that when you tear down tradition, when you disregard conventional mores, that
[1:26:40.300 --> 1:26:43.980]  the effect of it is you obliterate mores and you end up with a guillotine culture or society
[1:26:43.980 --> 1:26:45.420]  like the French Revolution.
[1:26:45.420 --> 1:26:46.740]  And the same thing can happen in terms of...
[1:26:46.740 --> 1:26:47.740]  That's it.
[1:26:47.740 --> 1:26:49.300]  Men running giant guillotines.
[1:26:49.300 --> 1:26:51.300]  It's actually happened in the French Revolution.
[1:26:51.300 --> 1:26:52.860]  Yeah, aspects of it did.
[1:26:52.860 --> 1:26:53.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:26:53.860 --> 1:26:54.860]  The...
[1:26:54.860 --> 1:26:55.860]  I mean, sadism, sort of.
[1:26:55.860 --> 1:26:56.860]  When the dudes start wearing dresses, prepare to die.
[1:26:56.860 --> 1:26:57.860]  It's like, you know...
[1:26:57.860 --> 1:27:02.020]  Well, it's just once you restrain yourself and you remove all those self-restraints,
[1:27:02.020 --> 1:27:03.020]  then what happens?
[1:27:03.020 --> 1:27:04.420]  And it tends to unleash a wide range of...
[1:27:04.420 --> 1:27:06.420]  What would happen if I sort of wear an address?
[1:27:06.420 --> 1:27:08.900]  I think people would have a different reaction to it, but you never know.
[1:27:08.900 --> 1:27:09.900]  So the...
[1:27:09.900 --> 1:27:10.900]  I mean, I think it's just...
[1:27:10.900 --> 1:27:11.900]  I'm not used to that.
[1:27:11.900 --> 1:27:12.900]  Yeah, it would be a very different...
[1:27:12.900 --> 1:27:13.900]  Let me be Scottish, I guess.
[1:27:13.900 --> 1:27:14.900]  You know, a little bit Scottish, but...
[1:27:14.900 --> 1:27:15.900]  It's like the Kilt's War, man.
[1:27:15.900 --> 1:27:17.900]  Yeah, the Kilt's War, yeah, the flower pattern.
[1:27:17.900 --> 1:27:19.900]  Yeah, that would be a little different.
[1:27:19.900 --> 1:27:20.900]  Barter belts, like...
[1:27:20.900 --> 1:27:21.900]  I don't know.
[1:27:21.900 --> 1:27:22.900]  Maybe the left would like you, then.
[1:27:22.900 --> 1:27:23.900]  The...
[1:27:23.900 --> 1:27:24.900]  You know, I actually was a biological woman.
[1:27:24.900 --> 1:27:25.900]  You didn't believe my transition?
[1:27:25.900 --> 1:27:26.900]  Yeah, no, I did not.
[1:27:26.900 --> 1:27:27.900]  I don't have a feminine frame.
[1:27:27.900 --> 1:27:28.900]  Yeah, unfortunately, no.
[1:27:28.900 --> 1:27:29.900]  The...
[1:27:29.900 --> 1:27:35.340]  But I mean, due to the nature of it, I think that there's a certain degree of the sort
[1:27:35.340 --> 1:27:38.740]  of the whole logic and ideology that they've sort of got caught up in and the sort of
[1:27:38.740 --> 1:27:39.740]  cultist culture.
[1:27:39.740 --> 1:27:43.500]  There's a recent study they've done where they've surveyed college-educated liberals
[1:27:43.500 --> 1:27:47.580]  versus college-educated conservatives and other groups, and what they find is the group
[1:27:47.580 --> 1:27:52.220]  in the whole country that has the least understanding of its political adversaries are college-educated
[1:27:52.220 --> 1:27:53.220]  liberals.
[1:27:53.220 --> 1:27:57.460]  And it's because in the Google world, that's intensified times 10, they live in their own
[1:27:57.460 --> 1:27:59.500]  incredible echo chamber, and they've been...
[1:27:59.500 --> 1:28:05.020]  Where the execs make everyone come into these amplitheaters and go, I'm a beautiful dragonette.
[1:28:05.020 --> 1:28:07.100]  You're a beautiful dragonette.
[1:28:07.100 --> 1:28:10.900]  I'm a beautiful ornate building, and they're all wearing like propeller hats and stuff,
[1:28:10.900 --> 1:28:14.660]  and they're just like, oh, I mean, it's total mental illness.
[1:28:14.660 --> 1:28:18.660]  It's a world where, for them, that is normal, and going to church is totally abnormal and
[1:28:18.660 --> 1:28:19.660]  freakish.
[1:28:19.660 --> 1:28:22.460]  And I mean, it's the reason why Joe Biden continues to dominate the Democratic Party.
[1:28:22.460 --> 1:28:24.980]  Don't they get people who are going to church thousands of years ago?
[1:28:24.980 --> 1:28:28.940]  Because when they didn't, it would be like, let's sacrifice our kids, or let's cut our
[1:28:28.940 --> 1:28:29.940]  genitals off.
[1:28:29.940 --> 1:28:32.300]  You know, the Aztecs did that, like, we've done this before.
[1:28:32.300 --> 1:28:35.740]  It's like, what is the thing, we're, hey, I got to not eat a day, let me chop my cock
[1:28:35.740 --> 1:28:36.740]  off.
[1:28:36.740 --> 1:28:37.740]  Oh, delay that.
[1:28:37.740 --> 1:28:38.980]  I mean, I don't understand, like...
[1:28:38.980 --> 1:28:39.980]  Yeah.
[1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:40.980]  It's a different mindset, different mentality.
[1:28:40.980 --> 1:28:45.980]  That's sitting in your kitchen, you see a blender, you think, let me, let me stick my
[1:28:45.980 --> 1:28:46.980]  arm in that.
[1:28:46.980 --> 1:28:47.980]  See how that feels.
[1:28:47.980 --> 1:28:48.980]  Don't do that, folks.
[1:28:48.980 --> 1:28:49.980]  I'm, we'll be right back.
[1:28:49.980 --> 1:28:52.580]  Actually, what have I, that's trans-able.
[1:28:52.580 --> 1:28:54.100]  People chop their own arms and legs off.
[1:28:54.100 --> 1:28:55.100]  It's very liberal.
[1:28:55.100 --> 1:28:57.300]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:57.300 --> 1:28:59.980]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[1:28:59.980 --> 1:29:04.460]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but we're waiting for prices
[1:29:04.460 --> 1:29:08.500]  too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[1:29:08.500 --> 1:29:12.380]  We'll hide here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on
[1:29:12.380 --> 1:29:16.980]  our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[1:29:16.980 --> 1:29:17.980]  off the grid.
[1:29:17.980 --> 1:29:21.860]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here, right on the East
[1:29:21.860 --> 1:29:23.360]  Bank of the Mississippi.
[1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:27.180]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[1:29:27.180 --> 1:29:30.940]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[1:29:30.940 --> 1:29:35.300]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[1:29:35.300 --> 1:29:36.660]  So here's what you should do right now.
[1:29:36.660 --> 1:29:40.980]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.

[1:30:18.380 --> 1:30:48.340]  The greatest comedy show on Earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and
[1:30:48.340 --> 1:30:49.340]  tons of laughs.
[1:30:49.340 --> 1:30:58.340]  June 26th and 27th, coverage starts at 7 p.m. at infowars.com forward slash show.
[1:30:58.340 --> 1:31:04.060]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[1:31:04.060 --> 1:31:08.620]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented
[1:31:08.620 --> 1:31:12.860]  evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom
[1:31:12.860 --> 1:31:16.900]  of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw all those lies against
[1:31:16.900 --> 1:31:20.780]  us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars,
[1:31:20.780 --> 1:31:22.500]  you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[1:31:22.500 --> 1:31:27.020]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in
[1:31:27.020 --> 1:31:28.020]  my heart.
[1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:30.900]  I want you to know that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for all you've
[1:31:30.900 --> 1:31:34.900]  done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support because I'm committed
[1:31:34.900 --> 1:31:39.780]  to fight to the end, but I want to win and without you, I'm going to be destroyed and
[1:31:39.780 --> 1:31:42.340]  it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important.
[1:31:42.340 --> 1:31:43.620]  The enemy could win.
[1:31:43.620 --> 1:31:45.740]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[1:31:45.740 --> 1:31:46.980]  You're being used by God.
[1:31:46.980 --> 1:31:47.980]  You're being used by God.
[1:31:47.980 --> 1:31:52.060]  This is Providence, so I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom
[1:31:52.060 --> 1:31:53.060]  of my heart.
[1:31:53.060 --> 1:31:58.780]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[1:31:58.780 --> 1:32:03.740]  Infowars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[1:32:03.740 --> 1:32:05.460]  the last year or so.
[1:32:05.460 --> 1:32:12.020]  It's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane and I keep trying to judge and
[1:32:12.020 --> 1:32:17.860]  engage, when is the right time to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation
[1:32:17.860 --> 1:32:22.380]  and say, hey, we're sinking, I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping
[1:32:22.380 --> 1:32:24.660]  us afloat, but this is the real SOS.
[1:32:24.660 --> 1:32:28.740]  If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, Infowars
[1:32:28.740 --> 1:32:31.620]  will be shut down, not just crippled.
[1:32:31.620 --> 1:32:32.620]  And so we've reached that point.
[1:32:32.620 --> 1:32:36.420]  It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we have withstood so many of their
[1:32:36.420 --> 1:32:37.420]  attacks.
[1:32:37.420 --> 1:32:39.820]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[1:32:39.820 --> 1:32:41.220]  You have, you have been there.
[1:32:41.220 --> 1:32:45.140]  Let me tell you, they are pissed, they haven't been successful and they're giving us their
[1:32:45.140 --> 1:32:46.140]  full assault.
[1:32:46.140 --> 1:32:52.100]  So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now at Infowars.com.
[1:32:52.100 --> 1:32:53.100]  It's your fight.
[1:32:53.100 --> 1:33:01.420]  Decide whether or not you want Infowars to continue because we could be shut down.
[1:33:01.420 --> 1:33:12.420]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:12.420 --> 1:33:22.420]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Robert Barnes, my sister's lawyer's wife, Scott Denweathers.
[1:33:22.420 --> 1:33:26.580]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see the amazing graphic, our crew put together.
[1:33:26.580 --> 1:33:32.380]  We have coming up this Wednesday and Thursday night, I believe that's already tomorrow night,
[1:33:32.380 --> 1:33:38.140]  seven to past whenever central, one hour of live coverage before the clown show, the
[1:33:38.140 --> 1:33:43.820]  Democratic party, first presidential debate for so many of them, they've got to split
[1:33:43.820 --> 1:33:44.820]  it into two nights.
[1:33:44.820 --> 1:33:49.060]  And then Thursday, 7 p.m. then we'll have kind of mystery science theater only during
[1:33:49.060 --> 1:33:54.460]  the long pauses or applause is what we have quick one liners analysis, but our crew including
[1:33:54.460 --> 1:33:56.900]  Robert Barnes will be with us will be writing notes.
[1:33:56.900 --> 1:34:02.340]  And then as soon as it's over, we will the analysis and take an hour or so of phone calls.
[1:34:02.340 --> 1:34:07.540]  So Clown World greatest show on earth and I've told you, more and more, we're doing
[1:34:07.540 --> 1:34:09.460]  limited edition t-shirts.
[1:34:09.460 --> 1:34:16.580]  Our newest one is Space Force 2020 Infowars American flag edition.
[1:34:16.580 --> 1:34:22.340]  And we're only going to sell that shirt until September and then a new variant of it is
[1:34:22.340 --> 1:34:28.380]  the best seller will come out, it'll be similar, but it'll still be a collector, but some shirts
[1:34:28.380 --> 1:34:31.220]  we're going to sell will be sold with one run.
[1:34:31.220 --> 1:34:37.860]  We're printing 5,000 of these made and printed in America.
[1:34:37.860 --> 1:34:39.540]  And when they're gone, they're gone.
[1:34:39.540 --> 1:34:45.580]  That means whatever sizes we get, we have large extra large and double large and we'll
[1:34:45.580 --> 1:34:47.260]  have some smalls as well.
[1:34:47.260 --> 1:34:51.100]  We're also going to come up with some children's shirts as well with some of the future products,
[1:34:51.100 --> 1:34:55.860]  so it's clownworldinfowars.com on the front with the image of the planet with the clown,
[1:34:55.860 --> 1:34:56.860]  very popular.

[1:35:04.180 --> 1:35:08.180]  to you by infowars.com, Clown World 2020.
[1:35:08.180 --> 1:35:12.820]  Now there's only 5,000 of these that we're going to be able to sell and I think that's
[1:35:12.820 --> 1:35:14.940]  the number we'll sell in the next week.
[1:35:14.940 --> 1:35:20.420]  So if you want it, it's being printed right now in America, what in Pennsylvania, it's

[1:36:08.060 --> 1:36:13.660]  Here's a little promo that was cut for it.
[1:36:13.660 --> 1:36:21.420]  Welcome to the greatest show on earth, it's Clown World 2020, who commemorates this exciting

[1:36:33.340 --> 1:36:35.180]  the info war.

[1:37:10.380 --> 1:37:14.620]  Now let's be clear, that's another thing I forgot to tell you, we're going to crown,
[1:37:14.620 --> 1:37:19.140]  we're going to have votes each night on infowars.com where you can vote who you think the top clown
[1:37:19.140 --> 1:37:23.380]  is, we're going to integrate those together and then either ringmaster with the rest of
[1:37:23.380 --> 1:37:27.220]  the crew, we will decide who the top clown is, there will be another limited edition
[1:37:27.220 --> 1:37:36.260]  shirt, only 1000 of it will be made, King Clown, so there's going to be a King Clown
[1:37:36.260 --> 1:37:38.700]  shirt, Robert Barnes are you excited about this?
[1:37:38.700 --> 1:37:43.220]  Oh yeah, it'll be a lot of fun, I mean it's always interesting to watch the debates, I
[1:37:43.220 --> 1:37:47.300]  watch it from a sort of multiple perspective, I also watch it from a betting perspective,
[1:37:47.300 --> 1:37:52.860]  so like 2016 was fantastic, so like before every debate you would sell Trump because
[1:37:52.860 --> 1:37:56.660]  the media would come out and say he did terrible, terrible debate and then you'd get a discounted
[1:37:56.660 --> 1:37:59.420]  value, you'd buy him right away because when the polls came out it would show Trump did
[1:37:59.420 --> 1:38:03.340]  great the debate, and so it was like easy money, it was like 24 hour easy cash, you could
[1:38:03.340 --> 1:38:08.380]  make 20% profit just a day's turnover, and so I watched the Democratic process not only
[1:38:08.380 --> 1:38:12.300]  from a sort of an idea, what ideas are getting popular, what ideas are starting to circulate,
[1:38:12.300 --> 1:38:16.820]  what ideas resonate, who does well on the stage, who has certain sort of skill and stamina,
[1:38:16.820 --> 1:38:20.140]  but also looking at how the press is going to spin it and how the public is going to
[1:38:20.140 --> 1:38:24.020]  react to it from a political betting market perspective, so slightly different from an
[1:38:24.020 --> 1:38:28.820]  overall political perspective because it incorporates a different component to it, but this year
[1:38:28.820 --> 1:38:33.900]  for example will be the largest trading markets and betting markets surrounding a Democratic
[1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:38.500]  presidential debate in political betting history, by the way Esquire all of them say, Politico
[1:38:38.500 --> 1:38:42.660]  say you're the biggest political gambler in the world, yeah I've had the most success
[1:38:42.660 --> 1:38:48.300]  of any American political gambler, most successful, yeah most successful by far, and 2016 was
[1:38:48.300 --> 1:38:54.620]  particularly nice, but all of 2016 was great, you had Brexit, did you make like 300,000
[1:38:54.620 --> 1:38:57.940]  just in Ireland on Trump, just in Ireland just on the November election, so it made
[1:38:57.940 --> 1:39:02.220]  a lot of money before that on Brexit, made a lot of money before that on Trump during
[1:39:02.220 --> 1:39:06.100]  the primaries, which was fantastic, so I think you're going to see it'll be interesting
[1:39:06.100 --> 1:39:10.180]  to watch, they really need to take out Biden over the next two days, because Biden has
[1:39:10.180 --> 1:39:14.060]  almost an impregnable wall amongst older African Americans, well sure also though they're
[1:39:14.060 --> 1:39:17.740]  just giving him all the polls, but let's talk about that, and I don't just say this
[1:39:17.740 --> 1:39:24.780]  to say it, he's like a toy that's wound down the batteries out, he's like, I mean he's
[1:39:24.780 --> 1:39:30.020]  looking worse than Hillary did, do you agree with that A, B, get into the strategy, you
[1:39:30.020 --> 1:39:35.820]  know, picking, you know, top, here's the headline, top sports, most successful, most successful
[1:39:35.820 --> 1:39:41.380]  political better, breaks down the 2020 Democratic field, so why does he have to go, and then
[1:39:41.380 --> 1:39:43.700]  who's the leader, Camilla Harris, what do you say?
[1:39:43.700 --> 1:39:48.860]  The no Democratic candidate has won the presidential nomination without being the lead candidate
[1:39:48.860 --> 1:39:54.700]  of African American voters in the Democratic primary process since 1980, since 1992, so
[1:39:54.700 --> 1:39:58.540]  in fact if you factor out the two times Jesse ran, basically the leading candidate amongst
[1:39:58.540 --> 1:40:03.620]  African American voters has won the Democratic nomination every single time since 1976, so
[1:40:03.620 --> 1:40:07.940]  that's how strong the Democratic nomination process is amongst the African American vote,
[1:40:07.940 --> 1:40:13.540]  and the leading African American voter is an African American woman over 45 who goes
[1:40:13.540 --> 1:40:19.500]  to church, often in southern and rural areas, this is not the social media version of race
[1:40:19.500 --> 1:40:25.100]  reparations politics, many of them are conservative in terms of their cultural and social values,
[1:40:25.100 --> 1:40:28.940]  they're sort of populist in their economic instincts and impulses, and right now Biden
[1:40:28.940 --> 1:40:33.980]  is living off of living in the shadow of Barack Obama, so like right now, like in the old
[1:40:33.980 --> 1:40:37.660]  days they used to say African Americans in the 1920s, if you went to their home, there
[1:40:37.660 --> 1:40:41.780]  was a picture of Jesus and right next to it was a picture of Abraham Lincoln, and by the
[1:40:41.780 --> 1:40:48.220]  1980s that was Jesus and Martin Luther King, today frankly it's Jesus and Barack Obama,
[1:40:48.220 --> 1:40:52.300]  and as long as Joe Biden can live in the shadow of Barack Obama, he's going to be the next
[1:40:52.300 --> 1:40:56.020]  Democratic nominee, that's why all of the other candidates have to, and Politico had
[1:40:56.020 --> 1:41:00.020]  a big article about it today, all the Democrats are nervous, be all the big wigs, all the
[1:41:00.020 --> 1:41:03.820]  big money folks, all the anti-Trump folks are nervous because they're afraid the debates
[1:41:03.820 --> 1:41:09.260]  are going to expose all the Democratic candidates as they cannibalize one another and then they're
[1:41:09.260 --> 1:41:13.740]  seeking power for themselves, and that will be the, and they have to cannibalize Joe Biden.
[1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:16.220]  And they're all going to go way left, that's what's going to be clown world.
[1:41:16.220 --> 1:41:20.100]  Exactly, that's why they have no choice, they have to go way left number one and at the
[1:41:20.100 --> 1:41:24.220]  same time find a way to take out Joe Biden, because right now Bernie Sanders is in the
[1:41:24.220 --> 1:41:28.780]  low double digits, so is Elizabeth Warren, everybody else is in the single digits, only
[1:41:28.780 --> 1:41:29.780]  Biden-
[1:41:29.780 --> 1:41:32.660]  So what happens, we probably end up with Biden and then he's, you agree his batteries are
[1:41:32.660 --> 1:41:33.660]  running low?
[1:41:33.660 --> 1:41:37.020]  I think if you're Donald Trump, you want Joe Biden to be your nominee, I don't think there's
[1:41:37.020 --> 1:41:40.860]  any Democrat you really worry about, someone like Tulsi Gabbard would be unique, but there's
[1:41:40.860 --> 1:41:43.700]  no chance the Democratic Party is ever going to allow her to go-
[1:41:43.700 --> 1:41:48.100]  So right now you're calling, unless he has a stroke or something, Sleepy Joe and Wild
[1:41:48.100 --> 1:41:49.100]  Donnie?
[1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:52.940]  Exactly, it's going to be Sleepy Creepy Joe against Donald Trump, and for Trump that's
[1:41:52.940 --> 1:41:53.940]  a godsend.
[1:41:53.940 --> 1:41:55.940]  So for all of the things people can criticize-
[1:41:55.940 --> 1:42:00.100]  Sleepy Creepy, that's kind of the name of the king of the clowns, I think we already
[1:42:00.100 --> 1:42:01.100]  kind of know the winner.
[1:42:01.100 --> 1:42:02.100]  Exactly.
[1:42:02.100 --> 1:42:03.100]  Sleepy Creepy.
[1:42:03.100 --> 1:42:05.100]  Hi kids, it's Sleepy Creepy.
[1:42:05.100 --> 1:42:06.100]  If you see the image-
[1:42:06.100 --> 1:42:07.100]  Let me touch it, huh?
[1:42:07.100 --> 1:42:10.980]  He looks like the Joker behind us, I mean he looks the most naturally and natively like
[1:42:10.980 --> 1:42:11.980]  the Joker.
[1:42:11.980 --> 1:42:12.980]  So the-
[1:42:12.980 --> 1:42:13.980]  He does, look at it.
[1:42:13.980 --> 1:42:14.980]  Can we zoom in on him?
[1:42:14.980 --> 1:42:15.980]  You're also going to have a unique-
[1:42:15.980 --> 1:42:16.980]  Hi kids.
[1:42:16.980 --> 1:42:20.560]  You're going to have a unique dynamic in that there's actually, they're setting up betting
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:24.420]  odds on whether or not what President Trump will tweet because he's going to live tweet
[1:42:24.420 --> 1:42:25.740]  the Democratic debates as well.
[1:42:25.740 --> 1:42:29.580]  And by the way, whoever did this great graphic on our crew, knew that he was the Joker.
[1:42:29.580 --> 1:42:30.580]  He's purple.
[1:42:30.580 --> 1:42:31.580]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[1:42:31.580 --> 1:42:32.580]  Everything about it.
[1:42:32.580 --> 1:42:33.580]  He looks it, he fits it.
[1:42:33.580 --> 1:42:37.580]  I mean, when I was, there's a lot of history of Joe Biden's corruption.
[1:42:37.580 --> 1:42:40.460]  Gosh, look at Cory Booker though, he looks like a psychotic.
[1:42:40.460 --> 1:42:44.860]  Yeah, well I mean the amazing thing is, in fact Congressman Clyburn, who's from South
[1:42:44.860 --> 1:42:49.060]  Carolina, coming out on this, neither African-American candidate Kamala Harris or Cory Booker has
[1:42:49.060 --> 1:42:51.260]  made any real head roads in the African-American community.
[1:42:51.260 --> 1:42:54.860]  All right, we come back, let's get back to where we were, the fall of the house of Google.
[1:42:54.860 --> 1:42:55.860]  What will it look like?
[1:42:55.860 --> 1:42:56.860]  Because we take them out.
[1:42:56.860 --> 1:43:01.860]  Announcing the greatest show on earth, reparations, free health care, free college, free homes,
[1:43:01.860 --> 1:43:02.860]  free money forever.
[1:43:02.860 --> 1:43:03.860]  Yay!
[1:43:03.860 --> 1:43:12.860]  It's Club World 2019, the Democratic Party's two-night extravaganza debate.
[1:43:12.860 --> 1:43:16.860]  Let's meet the candidates.
[1:43:16.860 --> 1:43:26.860]  All-Star, Beto O'Rourke, oh my gosh, Cory Booker, the amazing, oh, Pocahontas, Joe Biden.
[1:43:26.860 --> 1:43:29.860]  Swallowswell says he'll nuke gun owners, yay!
[1:43:29.860 --> 1:43:36.860]  Buddy, that does, love the Soviet Union, Kamala Harris, and so many more.
[1:43:36.860 --> 1:43:42.860]  It's the greatest show on earth at infowars.com forward slash show Wednesday and Thursday nights.
[1:43:42.860 --> 1:43:48.860]  The greatest comedy show on earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and tons of laughs.
[1:43:48.860 --> 1:43:56.860]  June 26th and 27th, coverage starts at 7 p.m. at infowars.com forward slash show.
[1:43:56.860 --> 1:44:01.860]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with
[1:44:01.860 --> 1:44:06.860]  the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[1:44:06.860 --> 1:44:13.860]  The false claim that you purposely said kiddie porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous,
[1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:15.860]  as well as false.
[1:44:15.860 --> 1:44:16.860]  It's a smear.
[1:44:16.860 --> 1:44:18.860]  Somebody sends you something that's encrypted.
[1:44:18.860 --> 1:44:20.860]  You don't even open it.
[1:44:20.860 --> 1:44:25.860]  It ends up, swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents, and then it's blamed on you.
[1:44:25.860 --> 1:44:27.860]  This is Kafkaesque.
[1:44:27.860 --> 1:44:28.860]  This is bizarre.
[1:44:28.860 --> 1:44:34.860]  But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say, Jones sent kiddie porn is really outrageous.
[1:44:34.860 --> 1:44:40.860]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified.
[1:44:40.860 --> 1:44:42.860]  But I wonder, where are the big boys?
[1:44:42.860 --> 1:44:43.860]  Where's the Wall Street Journal?
[1:44:43.860 --> 1:44:44.860]  Where's Associated Press?
[1:44:44.860 --> 1:44:50.860]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake, and what they said about you was inaccurate?
[1:44:50.860 --> 1:44:58.860]  So we both need your help, and I urge folks to continue to support Infowars with your dollars.
[1:44:58.860 --> 1:45:02.860]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[1:45:02.860 --> 1:45:07.860]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[1:45:07.860 --> 1:45:12.860]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[1:45:12.860 --> 1:45:13.860]  one another.
[1:45:13.860 --> 1:45:17.860]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[1:45:17.860 --> 1:45:22.860]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[1:45:22.860 --> 1:45:27.860]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up,
[1:45:27.860 --> 1:45:32.860]  the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting Infowars.
[1:45:32.860 --> 1:45:37.860]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products
[1:45:37.860 --> 1:45:41.860]  that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[1:45:41.860 --> 1:45:45.860]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech,
[1:45:45.860 --> 1:45:49.860]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[1:45:49.860 --> 1:45:54.860]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of
[1:45:54.860 --> 1:45:57.860]  free press and free speech with free markets.
[1:45:57.860 --> 1:46:00.860]  Well, we're very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[1:46:00.860 --> 1:46:04.860]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final
[1:46:04.860 --> 1:46:08.860]  mega-counts we have, do their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[1:46:08.860 --> 1:46:12.860]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[1:46:12.860 --> 1:46:16.860]  We need to end here. We need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment
[1:46:16.860 --> 1:46:19.860]  that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[1:46:19.860 --> 1:46:23.860]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[1:46:23.860 --> 1:46:25.860]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[1:46:25.860 --> 1:46:28.860]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[1:46:28.860 --> 1:46:30.860]  That just brings more people here.
[1:46:30.860 --> 1:46:33.860]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[1:46:33.860 --> 1:46:36.860]  I need gas. I need ammo politically now.
[1:46:36.860 --> 1:46:40.860]  But literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases
[1:46:40.860 --> 1:46:43.860]  and flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable. We're unstoppable together.
[1:46:43.860 --> 1:46:45.860]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[1:46:45.860 --> 1:46:49.860]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing
[1:46:49.860 --> 1:46:53.860]  and that you will stand with us and I will never back down to have my commitment.
[1:46:53.860 --> 1:46:56.860]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing
[1:46:56.860 --> 1:47:11.860]  and that we were right about this.
[1:47:26.860 --> 1:47:36.860]  We're on the highway looking for adventure and whatever comes our way.
[1:47:36.860 --> 1:47:42.860]  Yeah darling, go make it happen. Take the world in a loving place.
[1:47:42.860 --> 1:47:49.860]  Buy all that you've got in your pocket and explode into space.
[1:47:49.860 --> 1:48:02.860]  All right, there's a lot of bad stuff happening in the world.
[1:48:02.860 --> 1:48:05.860]  But it does seem humanity is starting to awaken.
[1:48:05.860 --> 1:48:09.860]  But the left is only going more crazy. We didn't get to the Jesse Smollett stuff.
[1:48:09.860 --> 1:48:11.860]  We didn't get to...
[1:48:11.860 --> 1:48:13.860]  Trump rape accuser says rape is sexy.
[1:48:13.860 --> 1:48:17.860]  He gave earlier interviews that she's obsessed with rape and being raped.
[1:48:17.860 --> 1:48:20.860]  And she has no proof that she ever even met Donald Trump.
[1:48:20.860 --> 1:48:23.860]  So I want to cover all that with you.
[1:48:23.860 --> 1:48:25.860]  Towards the end of this segment, the next segment ahead of our next guest,
[1:48:25.860 --> 1:48:28.860]  you're welcome to write a shot down or get back to the work you're doing for us here,
[1:48:28.860 --> 1:48:30.860]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer.
[1:48:30.860 --> 1:48:37.860]  But recapping, I don't sit up here and say something's devastating to the establishment
[1:48:37.860 --> 1:48:39.860]  unless it really is devastating.
[1:48:39.860 --> 1:48:42.860]  They're constantly saying, again, walls are closing in, we're all screwed,
[1:48:42.860 --> 1:48:45.860]  Trump's not going to win, Alex Jones is going to be off the air.
[1:48:45.860 --> 1:48:50.860]  All this garbage that isn't true, but they're trying to make us believe it
[1:48:50.860 --> 1:48:53.860]  so we just lay down our weapons politically and walk away.
[1:48:53.860 --> 1:48:57.860]  But I don't see how Google, after all the testimonies and all the lies
[1:48:57.860 --> 1:48:59.860]  and all the arrogance and all the times they've been caught,
[1:48:59.860 --> 1:49:03.860]  now to have the head person over Google's program of censorship
[1:49:03.860 --> 1:49:06.860]  describing how censorship is this Orwellian name.
[1:49:06.860 --> 1:49:08.860]  And then now they're saying, well, she did say it,
[1:49:08.860 --> 1:49:12.860]  but she's not really that important even though she's the head of the program.
[1:49:12.860 --> 1:49:16.860]  And then now Sundar's smart cities are in trouble.
[1:49:16.860 --> 1:49:18.860]  And everyone's going, man, this is toxic.
[1:49:18.860 --> 1:49:20.860]  Why do we let this in our home?
[1:49:20.860 --> 1:49:22.860]  Why do we just let them do whatever they want,
[1:49:22.860 --> 1:49:27.860]  especially when not just libertarians or Christians or conservatives,
[1:49:27.860 --> 1:49:32.860]  but just competent people have all experienced censorship
[1:49:32.860 --> 1:49:34.860]  because the control is so great now.
[1:49:34.860 --> 1:49:38.860]  And once someone gets censored and gets told they haven't been censored,
[1:49:38.860 --> 1:49:43.860]  it hardens them, it makes them then, instead of being passive and asleep,
[1:49:43.860 --> 1:49:45.860]  go into a mode of being awakened.
[1:49:45.860 --> 1:49:47.860]  How would you quantify this development?
[1:49:47.860 --> 1:49:51.860]  It's a major breakthrough because it's the first time we've had inside information
[1:49:51.860 --> 1:49:54.860]  that confirms what everybody is seeing and witnessing and experiencing.
[1:49:54.860 --> 1:49:58.860]  So people already knew from their experience that Google was censoring,
[1:49:58.860 --> 1:50:01.860]  that Google was controlling, that Google was manipulating,
[1:50:01.860 --> 1:50:04.860]  that Google went to control people's ideas and thoughts
[1:50:04.860 --> 1:50:07.860]  by how they saw information, when they saw information,
[1:50:07.860 --> 1:50:10.860]  how that information was ranked on algorithms,
[1:50:10.860 --> 1:50:13.860]  whether the YouTube videos were recommended or not.
[1:50:13.860 --> 1:50:17.860]  So people like Lauren Chen yesterday go through the details of the same details
[1:50:17.860 --> 1:50:21.860]  that Dave Rubin had also found in research that he'd been doing over the last several months,
[1:50:21.860 --> 1:50:25.860]  where they saw through their own website and their own YouTube videos
[1:50:25.860 --> 1:50:30.860]  were suddenly no longer being recommended on a systematic and systemic basis.
[1:50:30.860 --> 1:50:33.860]  So we've all seen that, but that's what you would call indirect evidence,
[1:50:33.860 --> 1:50:35.860]  sort of circumstantial evidence.
[1:50:35.860 --> 1:50:40.860]  What James O'Keeffe and Project Veritas documented was intent evidence.
[1:50:40.860 --> 1:50:45.860]  Words from their own mouths on videotape, on a 25-minute videotape.
[1:50:45.860 --> 1:50:50.860]  This is the stuff that when you always hear about manslaughter, murder, capital murder,
[1:50:50.860 --> 1:50:53.860]  is when they have the videotape of the logs where the three people get together
[1:50:53.860 --> 1:50:56.860]  and describe how they're going to kidnap them, how they're going to torture them to death,
[1:50:56.860 --> 1:51:00.860]  how they're going to find the gold, how they're going to kill them, how they're going to bury it.
[1:51:00.860 --> 1:51:04.860]  What the alibis are, the premeditation gets you capital one or executed.
[1:51:04.860 --> 1:51:06.860]  Exactly, it's the motive and the method.
[1:51:06.860 --> 1:51:10.860]  And this individual on this videotape discloses both.
[1:51:10.860 --> 1:51:14.860]  She goes through the motive, the motive being to never let 2016 happen again,
[1:51:14.860 --> 1:51:18.860]  never let Donald Trump or the populist movement succeed ever again,
[1:51:18.860 --> 1:51:23.860]  never allow any part of that movement to have success in the world of ideas or the world of elections.
[1:51:23.860 --> 1:51:25.860]  And then she goes into how we're going to do it.
[1:51:25.860 --> 1:51:26.860]  Exactly, the method.
[1:51:26.860 --> 1:51:30.860]  And the method is the details, literally like having a killer explain why he wanted to kill someone,
[1:51:30.860 --> 1:51:34.860]  what his motive was to kill them, and the method and means by which he was going to go about killing them.
[1:51:34.860 --> 1:51:36.860]  Then I took her and I chopped her up.
[1:51:36.860 --> 1:51:40.860]  Exactly, the detail, I'm going to do this, and then I'm going to do this, and then I'm going to do this.
[1:51:40.860 --> 1:51:42.860]  And everybody's witnessed that actually happened.
[1:51:42.860 --> 1:51:44.860]  And then we have the commission.
[1:51:44.860 --> 1:51:45.860]  Oh, the...
[1:51:45.860 --> 1:51:46.860]  Then they carry it out.
[1:51:46.860 --> 1:51:47.860]  All right, exactly.
[1:51:47.860 --> 1:51:49.860]  And as we've seen it, as we've seen the evidence...
[1:51:49.860 --> 1:51:51.860]  This isn't a plan they just hatched and didn't execute.
[1:51:51.860 --> 1:51:53.860]  Exactly, we've already seen the dead bodies everywhere.
[1:51:53.860 --> 1:51:54.860]  We've seen the corpses.
[1:51:54.860 --> 1:51:57.860]  We've seen the cut-up corpses of what they've done.
[1:51:57.860 --> 1:52:00.860]  And here they describe...
[1:52:00.860 --> 1:52:01.860]  Absolutely.
[1:52:01.860 --> 1:52:02.860]  In fact, over the last...
[1:52:02.860 --> 1:52:03.860]  And standard lighting.
[1:52:03.860 --> 1:52:04.860]  We never affect any search.
[1:52:04.860 --> 1:52:07.860]  We never look at the computer to lie.
[1:52:07.860 --> 1:52:10.860]  Well, I mean, you had media matters bragging about it.
[1:52:10.860 --> 1:52:13.860]  And in fact, media matters now is targeting Caitlin Bennett.
[1:52:13.860 --> 1:52:16.860]  Media matters is now targeting anybody.
[1:52:16.860 --> 1:52:18.860]  You're going to see the smile of somebody.
[1:52:18.860 --> 1:52:19.860]  Exactly.
[1:52:19.860 --> 1:52:21.860]  It's that mindset, it's that mentality.
[1:52:21.860 --> 1:52:25.860]  Then they're so used to winning, so used to prevailing, so used to dominating.
[1:52:25.860 --> 1:52:26.860]  They don't know what failure, it looks like.
[1:52:26.860 --> 1:52:29.860]  And because they live in the Necco Chamber world,
[1:52:29.860 --> 1:52:32.860]  now they're facing class action lawsuits brought by Harmeet Dillon.
[1:52:32.860 --> 1:52:35.860]  Can we roll some of Sundar with the Prang Manus, dude?
[1:52:35.860 --> 1:52:37.860]  Just in the background, a little bit of Sundar with the Prang Manus person.
[1:52:37.860 --> 1:52:38.860]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1:52:38.860 --> 1:52:39.860]  Oh, yeah.
[1:52:39.860 --> 1:52:43.860]  Well, yesterday, your video of going around after him in D.C. in the Capitol Hill
[1:52:43.860 --> 1:52:45.860]  was getting viral on various social media platforms
[1:52:45.860 --> 1:52:47.860]  because people realized what you were talking about then
[1:52:47.860 --> 1:52:50.860]  has now come to fruition for everybody to witness.
[1:52:50.860 --> 1:52:52.860]  They can no longer call it a conspiracy theory
[1:52:52.860 --> 1:52:56.860]  when the person on tape is describing the motive of the conspiracy,
[1:52:56.860 --> 1:52:57.860]  the means of the conspiracy,
[1:52:57.860 --> 1:53:01.860]  and the whole world can see the consequences of that conspiracy in action.
[1:53:01.860 --> 1:53:03.860]  Nobody can even claim it anymore.
[1:53:03.860 --> 1:53:05.860]  So the ability to have that illusion...
[1:53:05.860 --> 1:53:08.860]  But isn't it okay that Tim Cook also helps,
[1:53:08.860 --> 1:53:11.860]  because he has slave factories, but he's gay.
[1:53:11.860 --> 1:53:14.860]  And this other guy dresses like a woman and looks like a Prang Manus.
[1:53:14.860 --> 1:53:16.860]  So I don't care that he dresses like a Prang Manus,
[1:53:16.860 --> 1:53:19.860]  but he's allowed to censor us because he looks like a Prang Manus, right?
[1:53:19.860 --> 1:53:22.860]  Yeah, it sort of looks like that character from Saturday Night Live
[1:53:22.860 --> 1:53:24.860]  we've been telling us that he or she...
[1:53:24.860 --> 1:53:25.860]  Pat.
[1:53:25.860 --> 1:53:27.860]  Pat, yeah, that's Pat from Saturday Night Live.
[1:53:27.860 --> 1:53:28.860]  Really good.
[1:53:28.860 --> 1:53:30.860]  You know, Pat's become a journalist now.
[1:53:30.860 --> 1:53:33.860]  So it's the new brave world.
[1:53:33.860 --> 1:53:37.860]  When I originally saw this, I didn't see the Axios part.
[1:53:37.860 --> 1:53:38.860]  I thought it was a Prank video.
[1:53:38.860 --> 1:53:40.860]  That's what everybody else thought.
[1:53:40.860 --> 1:53:41.860]  I was like, you know...
[1:53:41.860 --> 1:53:42.860]  Son of a...
[1:53:42.860 --> 1:53:43.860]  Son of a...
[1:53:43.860 --> 1:53:44.860]  Son of a...
[1:53:44.860 --> 1:53:45.860]  Son of a...
[1:53:45.860 --> 1:53:46.860]  It's very much like a Bond villain.
[1:53:46.860 --> 1:53:49.860]  All these big tech billionaires are Bond villain-esque
[1:53:49.860 --> 1:53:52.860]  and they're a complete disconnect from the real world.
[1:53:52.860 --> 1:53:55.860]  Like that one who raised the fake money to create the DNA testing
[1:53:55.860 --> 1:53:57.860]  and is now a Thurnos, I believe it was called,
[1:53:57.860 --> 1:54:01.860]  the big documentary on now facing big federal criminal prosecution,
[1:54:01.860 --> 1:54:03.860]  completely under the illusion that that would never happen
[1:54:03.860 --> 1:54:05.860]  because of her political connections.
[1:54:05.860 --> 1:54:09.860]  Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, other people like that who are promoting...
[1:54:09.860 --> 1:54:12.860]  All that power is being swept away by the desire of populism
[1:54:12.860 --> 1:54:15.860]  in the hearts of humanity for every race, color, and creed.
[1:54:15.860 --> 1:54:17.860]  Since we raised this, if you're a TV viewer, you can see it,
[1:54:17.860 --> 1:54:18.860]  radio listeners will describe it.
[1:54:18.860 --> 1:54:20.860]  And Derek wants to talk about his cousin that's going to a college
[1:54:20.860 --> 1:54:21.860]  and what happened there.
[1:54:21.860 --> 1:54:24.860]  He's now identifying as an Apache attack helicopter
[1:54:24.860 --> 1:54:26.860]  as his sexual orientation.
[1:54:26.860 --> 1:54:29.860]  And so here we go.
[1:54:29.860 --> 1:54:31.860]  It's an image of all these genders.
[1:54:31.860 --> 1:54:34.860]  That's a small group of the new genders.
[1:54:34.860 --> 1:54:36.860]  There's over 50 that Facebook recognizes.
[1:54:36.860 --> 1:54:37.860]  There's over 500 total.
[1:54:37.860 --> 1:54:41.860]  But the genders are male and female there on the left-hand side.
[1:54:41.860 --> 1:54:43.860]  But as you go through the groups of them,
[1:54:43.860 --> 1:54:46.860]  there's all the middle disorders like trans-abled,
[1:54:46.860 --> 1:54:49.860]  you know, blinding yourself with bleach or the rest of it.
[1:54:49.860 --> 1:54:53.860]  But there's even stuff where if you're Native American and you're trans,
[1:54:53.860 --> 1:54:54.860]  well, you're something else as well.
[1:54:54.860 --> 1:54:58.860]  So it's up to 500 of these now, Robert Barnes.
[1:54:58.860 --> 1:55:00.860]  And again, I literally am not against mentally ill people.
[1:55:00.860 --> 1:55:03.860]  If someone's a libertarian and a man really wants to do this themselves,
[1:55:03.860 --> 1:55:04.860]  that's different.
[1:55:04.860 --> 1:55:08.860]  But just don't make it the center of the universe that we all have to abide by.
[1:55:08.860 --> 1:55:11.860]  If we want to say it's mentally illness to chop your genitals off
[1:55:11.860 --> 1:55:14.860]  or pour bleach in your eyes, that's all right to do it.
[1:55:14.860 --> 1:55:15.860]  It's certainly all right.
[1:55:15.860 --> 1:55:22.860]  But places like Connecticut are now legalizing kids having their genitals cut off.
[1:55:22.860 --> 1:55:23.860]  And we've got to pay for it.
[1:55:23.860 --> 1:55:24.860]  I think that's very immoral.
[1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:25.860]  Oh, it's very dangerous.
[1:55:25.860 --> 1:55:30.860]  I mean, when you had the Canadian judge allow certain things to happen over parental objection,
[1:55:30.860 --> 1:55:34.860]  that's a dangerous, but you had the UK case recently that fortunately was overturned.
[1:55:34.860 --> 1:55:38.860]  But originally, the judge was going to require for someone to have an abortion
[1:55:38.860 --> 1:55:42.860]  who didn't want to have an abortion simply because of didn't like her mental state,
[1:55:42.860 --> 1:55:44.860]  which goes back to the forced sterilization.
[1:55:44.860 --> 1:55:48.860]  Eugenics, exactly eugenics, which the American eugenics was the found amongst the
[1:55:48.860 --> 1:55:55.860]  the economic and political elite of America was who the Nazis cited as the foundation of their ideas.
[1:55:55.860 --> 1:55:56.860]  That's right.
[1:55:56.860 --> 1:56:02.860]  Let's put back on screen this scientific chart because they say there's only 100,000 genders.
[1:56:02.860 --> 1:56:03.860]  We say in scientific there's only two.
[1:56:03.860 --> 1:56:04.860]  That's a fact.
[1:56:04.860 --> 1:56:06.860]  So there's our scientific chart.
[1:56:06.860 --> 1:56:08.860]  I want to bring in Derek here.
[1:56:08.860 --> 1:56:10.860]  Derek, you were telling me about some of your family that's going to college
[1:56:10.860 --> 1:56:14.860]  and they officially identified on their college card as an attack helicopter.
[1:56:14.860 --> 1:56:15.860]  Go ahead.
[1:56:15.860 --> 1:56:18.860]  Well, it's actually one of my friends and he works for this.
[1:56:18.860 --> 1:56:19.860]  Oh, I misunderstood you.
[1:56:19.860 --> 1:56:20.860]  It's one of your friends.
[1:56:20.860 --> 1:56:24.860]  He works for this major university on the East Coast.
[1:56:24.860 --> 1:56:28.860]  I don't know if I'm really at liberty to say.
[1:56:28.860 --> 1:56:29.860]  Well, you might get in trouble.
[1:56:29.860 --> 1:56:30.860]  Precisely.
[1:56:30.860 --> 1:56:33.860]  We're not we're not discriminating as attack helicopters.
[1:56:33.860 --> 1:56:34.860]  No, definitely not.
[1:56:34.860 --> 1:56:37.860]  That's a sexual movement that's identified if you like to have sexual machines.
[1:56:37.860 --> 1:56:38.860]  Precisely.
[1:56:38.860 --> 1:56:42.860]  And if you have a sexual disorder, like you need to address that, like it's getting pretty
[1:56:42.860 --> 1:56:43.860]  out of hand.
[1:56:43.860 --> 1:56:47.860]  But anyways, this microphone is looking pretty good right here.
[1:56:47.860 --> 1:56:48.860]  Yeah.
[1:56:48.860 --> 1:56:58.860]  But anyways, on his bio for his work, it has like a little spot to place what gender pronouns
[1:56:58.860 --> 1:57:01.860]  you want to be referred to as.
[1:57:01.860 --> 1:57:06.860]  And on his, it says apache apachim apaches.
[1:57:06.860 --> 1:57:10.860]  And then I don't know if you can zoom in on this or what, but it has a little attack
[1:57:10.860 --> 1:57:12.860]  helicopter right next to it.
[1:57:12.860 --> 1:57:14.860]  It's just absurd.
[1:57:14.860 --> 1:57:16.860]  Well, these are growing.
[1:57:16.860 --> 1:57:19.860]  Why are you being hateful to people that are attack helicopters?
[1:57:19.860 --> 1:57:21.860]  Well, it's mental.
[1:57:21.860 --> 1:57:22.860]  It's a mental illness, Alex.
[1:57:22.860 --> 1:57:23.860]  It needs to be addressed.
[1:57:23.860 --> 1:57:25.860]  And how do we stop?
[1:57:25.860 --> 1:57:26.860]  I don't know.
[1:57:26.860 --> 1:57:28.860]  Have you ever been close to an attack helicopter?
[1:57:28.860 --> 1:57:29.860]  Pretty sexy.
[1:57:29.860 --> 1:57:30.860]  What do you think?
[1:57:30.860 --> 1:57:32.860]  It's biology denialism.
[1:57:32.860 --> 1:57:35.860]  Are you saying an attack helicopter can't have a baby?
[1:57:35.860 --> 1:57:36.860]  Probably not.
[1:57:36.860 --> 1:57:38.860]  Oh, that's like saying men can't.
[1:57:38.860 --> 1:57:39.860]  Wow.
[1:57:39.860 --> 1:57:40.860]  Robert Barnes put his foot in it.
[1:57:40.860 --> 1:57:42.860]  Yo, show us what your buddy's saying.

[1:58:45.860 --> 1:58:47.860]  We're not going to back down.
[1:58:47.860 --> 1:58:49.860]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[1:58:49.860 --> 1:58:50.860]  Marcus here on the air.
[1:58:50.860 --> 1:58:51.860]  Thanks for holding.
[1:58:51.860 --> 1:58:54.860]  Hey, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[1:58:54.860 --> 1:58:58.860]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that
[1:58:58.860 --> 1:59:00.860]  almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[1:59:00.860 --> 1:59:04.860]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[1:59:04.860 --> 1:59:08.860]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public.
[1:59:08.860 --> 1:59:09.860]  The approaching 2020.
[1:59:09.860 --> 1:59:10.860]  That's it.
[1:59:10.860 --> 1:59:12.860]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[1:59:12.860 --> 1:59:15.860]  It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him.
[1:59:15.860 --> 1:59:17.860]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[1:59:17.860 --> 1:59:18.860]  I agree entirely.
[1:59:18.860 --> 1:59:21.860]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[1:59:21.860 --> 1:59:23.860]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[1:59:23.860 --> 1:59:26.860]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[1:59:26.860 --> 1:59:28.860]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[1:59:28.860 --> 1:59:31.860]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[1:59:31.860 --> 1:59:33.860]  You've won a lot of battles.
[1:59:33.860 --> 1:59:37.860]  And there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[1:59:37.860 --> 1:59:39.860]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[1:59:39.860 --> 1:59:43.860]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten
[1:59:43.860 --> 1:59:45.860]  a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[1:59:45.860 --> 1:59:47.860]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[1:59:47.860 --> 1:59:54.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:17.860 --> 2:00:23.860]  So what would you call the psychological weirdness?
[2:00:23.860 --> 2:00:26.860]  Robert Barnes is a smart lawyer that the Democrats are going through.
[2:00:26.860 --> 2:00:30.860]  Jesse Smallett obviously staged the attack on himself as cartoonish.
[2:00:30.860 --> 2:00:33.860]  The system isn't prosecuting him to protect him.
[2:00:33.860 --> 2:00:36.860]  But still everybody knows the Covington kids being set up now.
[2:00:36.860 --> 2:00:39.860]  Trump rape accuser says rape is sexy.
[2:00:39.860 --> 2:00:42.860]  You want to play that first during bizarre CNN meltdown.
[2:00:42.860 --> 2:00:45.860]  It turns out years ago, she fetishizes rape.
[2:00:45.860 --> 2:00:50.860]  What is this thing where police even admit it turns out half of rape allegations are fake.
[2:00:50.860 --> 2:00:55.860]  90 plus percent of hate crimes are fake, which then protects really the bad guys.
[2:00:55.860 --> 2:00:56.860]  What's happening here?
[2:00:56.860 --> 2:01:00.860]  Well, the rape accusations is just as rape is a crime of power.
[2:01:00.860 --> 2:01:03.860]  The accusation is a means and tool of power.
[2:01:03.860 --> 2:01:10.860]  So you're always going to have some risk that people for whatever reason will make up a false accusation of a crime against somebody.
[2:01:10.860 --> 2:01:20.860]  And it is a particular kind of crime that often doesn't necessarily have documented physical evidence if it's not reported until years after the fact.
[2:01:20.860 --> 2:01:23.860]  So what you have here is someone who honestly had sort of crazy eyes.
[2:01:23.860 --> 2:01:25.860]  And Anderson Cooper is interviewing her.
[2:01:25.860 --> 2:01:32.860]  And Anderson Cooper is clearly unsettled by her mindset, by her words, by her vocabulary, by her behavior.
[2:01:32.860 --> 2:01:39.860]  Feels deeply uncomfortable, tries to edit out and cut off the interview at key junctures where she's embarrassing herself in a wide range of ways.
[2:01:39.860 --> 2:01:46.860]  As soon as this anybody who has, I've done a lot of cases representing victims of domestic abuse, victims of sexual assault.
[2:01:46.860 --> 2:01:48.860]  There are certain patterns and abusers.
[2:01:48.860 --> 2:01:51.860]  And Donald Trump doesn't have any of those patterns.
[2:01:51.860 --> 2:01:56.860]  If anything, if Donald Trump might have run into issues, it would be with adultery allegations.
[2:01:56.860 --> 2:01:58.860]  It's not going to be with abuse allegations.
[2:01:58.860 --> 2:02:01.860]  Oh, by the way, I know some of the women he's dated are people that know him well.
[2:02:01.860 --> 2:02:05.860]  They say Trump is super nice to women, puts them on a pedestal.
[2:02:05.860 --> 2:02:09.860]  But if they're rude or mess with him a couple of times, he's done.
[2:02:09.860 --> 2:02:11.860]  But it's like he's so nice to women, it's ridiculous.
[2:02:11.860 --> 2:02:13.860]  Oh, yeah, he's, well, he's a mama's boy at heart.
[2:02:13.860 --> 2:02:19.860]  I mean, you can tell if you've ever seen interviews with his mother, there's a very caring relationship between the two of them.
[2:02:19.860 --> 2:02:23.860]  And if anything, maybe he was a little bit spoiled, some might say, by his mom.
[2:02:23.860 --> 2:02:25.860]  So he comes at those kind of personalities.
[2:02:25.860 --> 2:02:32.860]  They believe, they walk into the room and believe, you know, for whatever their cause, whether it's good or not, they think every woman in the room loves them.
[2:02:32.860 --> 2:02:36.860]  That they have no question about it, they don't doubt it, they don't second guess it, they don't challenge that.
[2:02:36.860 --> 2:02:44.860]  So nothing about Trump's pattern of behavior, his psychology, his profile, fit at all any of these crazy allegations of abuse and assault.
[2:02:44.860 --> 2:02:46.860]  They were clearly manufactured out of...
[2:02:46.860 --> 2:02:48.860]  What is the rape or serial rape as fittings?
[2:02:48.860 --> 2:02:50.860]  I don't even imagine making a woman have sex with me.
[2:02:50.860 --> 2:02:52.860]  The whole point is they want it. That's what's exciting.
[2:02:52.860 --> 2:02:54.860]  What kind of person wants to rape?
[2:02:54.860 --> 2:03:00.860]  There are people that have usually had sort of, not only rejecting, they've had no positive parental presence of any kind, parent or grandparent,
[2:03:00.860 --> 2:03:03.860]  of uncle, aunt, community, person, whatever.
[2:03:03.860 --> 2:03:07.860]  And usually they've been violated by somebody close to them and usually by the parent of the opposite gender.
[2:03:07.860 --> 2:03:11.860]  So you see that repeatedly.
[2:03:11.860 --> 2:03:15.860]  So the common pattern you'll find, you won't find any rapists that have happy family lives.
[2:03:15.860 --> 2:03:17.860]  If you hear that, they're lying about their family.
[2:03:17.860 --> 2:03:20.860]  Like Bill Clinton, broken family, mother was a prostitute, never home.
[2:03:20.860 --> 2:03:25.860]  Correct, exactly. And you have someone who feels abused, who feels violated, who feels his space...
[2:03:25.860 --> 2:03:26.860]  Trump's the opposite.
[2:03:26.860 --> 2:03:28.860]  That's totally engaged, mother totally engaged.
[2:03:28.860 --> 2:03:31.860]  Yeah, completely. I mean, everything about that, you look at Trump's kids.
[2:03:31.860 --> 2:03:34.860]  I mean, how many people do you know that are billionaires that have been highly successful,
[2:03:34.860 --> 2:03:38.860]  that are in the public eye, that have a high-profile divorce note less, with their mother,
[2:03:38.860 --> 2:03:42.860]  have kids that are basically pretty as normal as possible?
[2:03:42.860 --> 2:03:44.860]  And usually you never see the kids with billionaires.
[2:03:44.860 --> 2:03:45.860]  Oh, exactly.
[2:03:45.860 --> 2:03:46.860]  Instead, they're everywhere.
[2:03:46.860 --> 2:03:50.860]  Correct. I mean, hear that they're out in the public eye in a major way with no major problems.
[2:03:50.860 --> 2:03:52.860]  That does not happen by accident.
[2:03:52.860 --> 2:03:55.860]  Anyone who's ever raped kids knows that doesn't happen by accident.
[2:03:55.860 --> 2:03:57.860]  That's somebody telling you, you're great when you're great, you're bad when you're bad.
[2:03:57.860 --> 2:04:01.860]  Precisely. And someone who's come up with a protective, but disciplined environment,
[2:04:01.860 --> 2:04:05.860]  that did not either over-reward them or under-reward them for their behavior.
[2:04:05.860 --> 2:04:09.860]  And so they're very normal kids, very well-adjusted individuals as a whole,
[2:04:09.860 --> 2:04:13.860]  particularly given the culture and society and economic privileges.
[2:04:13.860 --> 2:04:17.860]  But then, meanwhile, we have a cute up to her saying how great rape is. Here it is.
[2:04:17.860 --> 2:04:18.860]  Yes, she said it.
[2:04:18.860 --> 2:04:19.860]  You don't feel it.
[2:04:19.860 --> 2:04:21.860]  I was not thrown on the ground and ravished.
[2:04:21.860 --> 2:04:26.860]  Which, the word rape carries so many sexual connotations.
[2:04:26.860 --> 2:04:31.860]  This was not sexual. It hurt.
[2:04:31.860 --> 2:04:37.860]  I think most people think of rape as a violent assault.
[2:04:37.860 --> 2:04:41.860]  I think most people think of rape as being sexy.
[2:04:41.860 --> 2:04:44.860]  Not in my planet, you lunatic.
[2:04:44.860 --> 2:04:46.860]  Just look at those eyes.
[2:04:46.860 --> 2:04:49.860]  That is a loon ball.
[2:04:49.860 --> 2:04:56.860]  Great job, Robert. We'll talk to you soon. Coming up with a special guest.
[2:05:20.860 --> 2:05:25.860]  This is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting,
[2:05:25.860 --> 2:05:28.860]  info wars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[2:05:28.860 --> 2:05:30.860]  And so we've reached that point.
[2:05:30.860 --> 2:05:32.860]  It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever.
[2:05:32.860 --> 2:05:34.860]  We have withstood so many of their attacks.
[2:05:34.860 --> 2:05:37.860]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[2:05:37.860 --> 2:05:38.860]  You have been there.
[2:05:38.860 --> 2:05:40.860]  But let me tell you, they are pissed.
[2:05:40.860 --> 2:05:41.860]  They haven't been successful.
[2:05:41.860 --> 2:05:43.860]  And they're giving us their full assault.
[2:05:43.860 --> 2:05:47.860]  So we need your prayers, your financial support, and your word of mouth now
[2:05:47.860 --> 2:05:49.860]  at infowarshot.com.
[2:05:49.860 --> 2:05:50.860]  It's your fight.
[2:05:50.860 --> 2:05:56.860]  Decide whether or not you want info wars to continue, because we could be shut down.
[2:05:56.860 --> 2:05:59.860]  Google would love to have me arrested and killed.
[2:05:59.860 --> 2:06:01.860]  Guaranteed.
[2:06:04.860 --> 2:06:08.860]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party
[2:06:08.860 --> 2:06:10.860]  and multinational corporations in Big Tech
[2:06:10.860 --> 2:06:13.860]  to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[2:06:13.860 --> 2:06:18.860]  Infowars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[2:06:18.860 --> 2:06:21.860]  Sundar, you know Google is helping China with Dragonfly,
[2:06:21.860 --> 2:06:23.860]  and you know that they're helping censor,
[2:06:23.860 --> 2:06:26.860]  and you know that you've sold this country out,
[2:06:26.860 --> 2:06:28.860]  and you won't even help the Pentagon, you'll help the Chai comms.
[2:06:28.860 --> 2:06:30.860]  You bet on the wrong country, Sundar.
[2:06:30.860 --> 2:06:32.860]  We're aware of his lying to Congress.
[2:06:32.860 --> 2:06:34.860]  We're aware of him and the Dragonfly Project.
[2:06:34.860 --> 2:06:36.860]  It's already been operational for years inside the Chinese government.
[2:06:36.860 --> 2:06:38.860]  Now it's just being rolled out to the general public.
[2:06:38.860 --> 2:06:40.860]  Sundar, you're engaged in treason.
[2:06:40.860 --> 2:06:44.860]  You've had Google executives lie to Congress that you're not censoring conservatives.
[2:06:44.860 --> 2:06:47.860]  The Big Tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with
[2:06:47.860 --> 2:06:50.860]  Senator Warner, who's running this whole thing,
[2:06:50.860 --> 2:06:52.860]  to begin shutting down conservatives,
[2:06:52.860 --> 2:06:55.860]  or the Democrats threatened to federalize Big Tech
[2:06:55.860 --> 2:06:57.860]  if they did not basically roll over to them.
[2:06:57.860 --> 2:07:00.860]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier
[2:07:00.860 --> 2:07:02.860]  promoting conspiracy theories.
[2:07:02.860 --> 2:07:06.860]  Alex Jones obviously is one of the conspiracy theorists whose brand is bullying.
[2:07:06.860 --> 2:07:08.860]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[2:07:08.860 --> 2:07:10.860]  I have a right to fix my accusers.
[2:07:10.860 --> 2:07:13.860]  And you, Congressman Deutsch, are a liar and a fraud.
[2:07:13.860 --> 2:07:17.860]  Google is evil. Google is evil. Google is evil.
[2:07:17.860 --> 2:07:23.860]  Twitter is planning to permanently suspend Alex Jones' personal account at InfoWars.
[2:07:23.860 --> 2:07:27.860]  This comes after Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey was on Capitol Hill yesterday
[2:07:27.860 --> 2:07:28.860]  speaking with lawmakers.
[2:07:28.860 --> 2:07:31.860]  Twitter gives Alex Jones the boot,
[2:07:31.860 --> 2:07:36.860]  the social networking site permanently banning he and his media company InfoWars.
[2:07:36.860 --> 2:07:39.860]  I appreciate you bringing us to the amendment.
[2:07:39.860 --> 2:07:41.860]  But I have a right to face my accusers, Jack.
[2:07:41.860 --> 2:07:43.860]  They're lying about me and they're trying to de-platform me.
[2:07:43.860 --> 2:07:46.860]  26 companies working in concert, violating the Sherman-Eddie Trust Act,
[2:07:46.860 --> 2:07:49.860]  and now Senator Warner and Senator Wyden have said,
[2:07:49.860 --> 2:07:52.860]  quote, there's thousands of sites worse than Alex Jones.
[2:07:52.860 --> 2:07:54.860]  So we're becoming like Cuba. We're becoming like Vietnam.
[2:07:54.860 --> 2:07:55.860]  We're becoming like China.
[2:07:55.860 --> 2:07:58.860]  So regardless of what we'll think about me or the straw men,
[2:07:58.860 --> 2:08:01.860]  should I have a First Amendment or should these companies be able
[2:08:01.860 --> 2:08:06.860]  to violate the whole Safe Arbor Act and all that and then ban conservatives en masse?
[2:08:06.860 --> 2:08:08.860]  Yeah, I don't know anything about your site, man.
[2:08:08.860 --> 2:08:14.860]  And we're also standing up to social media censorship. That's the new thing.
[2:08:14.860 --> 2:08:19.860]  Our interview was cut short because he was confronted by Alex Jones of InfoWars
[2:08:19.860 --> 2:08:20.860]  right here in the hallway.
[2:08:20.860 --> 2:08:21.860]  It's weird, man.
[2:08:21.860 --> 2:08:23.860]  Oh, yeah, it's really weird. There's no purge of conservatives.
[2:08:23.860 --> 2:08:24.860]  I don't know.
[2:08:24.860 --> 2:08:25.860]  There's no shadow banning.
[2:08:25.860 --> 2:08:27.860]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[2:08:27.860 --> 2:08:28.860]  Yeah, who's this guy? We de-platform him.
[2:08:28.860 --> 2:08:30.860]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[2:08:30.860 --> 2:08:33.860]  Well, I think the bigger bias is against freedom of expression.
[2:08:33.860 --> 2:08:35.860]  Everybody should be. There's a look.
[2:08:35.860 --> 2:08:37.860]  I support going after it.
[2:08:37.860 --> 2:08:38.860]  It's happening here, but you say I don't exist.
[2:08:38.860 --> 2:08:39.860]  Is that a heckler?
[2:08:53.860 --> 2:08:55.860]  Well, Professor Francis Say Boyle, I won't go over his little pile.
[2:08:55.860 --> 2:08:57.860]  I'll take up the 20 minutes we have.
[2:08:57.860 --> 2:09:01.860]  He's been coming on the show more than 15, 16 years.
[2:09:01.860 --> 2:09:06.860]  He has helped write major U.S. treaties, biological weapons.
[2:09:06.860 --> 2:09:11.860]  He's a best-selling author on geopolitical developments and events.
[2:09:11.860 --> 2:09:14.860]  And he also delivered the Bertrand Russell peace lectures.
[2:09:14.860 --> 2:09:18.860]  He went to the same PhD that only has one or two people go through the year at Harvard
[2:09:18.860 --> 2:09:20.860]  that Kissinger went through.
[2:09:20.860 --> 2:09:25.860]  He was meant to be one of them, but he was obviously there as a rebel against that.
[2:09:25.860 --> 2:09:32.860]  And he wrote an article or a paper days before it happened advising Trump
[2:09:32.860 --> 2:09:35.860]  not to attack Iran preemptively that it would be a war crime.
[2:09:35.860 --> 2:09:40.860]  And Tucker Carlson, I know, and others talked to the president daily and convinced him not to do it.
[2:09:40.860 --> 2:09:43.860]  And I've confirmed that directly, talking to Tucker.
[2:09:43.860 --> 2:09:46.860]  But Trump unleashes on Bolton.
[2:09:46.860 --> 2:09:49.860]  We'd be fighting the whole world at one time.
[2:09:49.860 --> 2:09:51.860]  That's up on newswars.com.
[2:09:51.860 --> 2:09:56.860]  I'm no fan of Iran, folks, but the point is the neocons, as I've said, I'm no fan of Venezuela.
[2:09:56.860 --> 2:10:00.860]  But we're being lured into something to set the president up.
[2:10:00.860 --> 2:10:01.860]  And I think Trump gets that.
[2:10:01.860 --> 2:10:05.860]  The question is why in hell is Bolton in there?
[2:10:05.860 --> 2:10:11.860]  And who would somebody like Francis Boyle advise that Trump should have advising him?
[2:10:11.860 --> 2:10:14.860]  Well, Trump's instincts are right to make peace with Russia.
[2:10:14.860 --> 2:10:18.860]  His instincts are right to try to make peace with Iran and to get out of the strategy of tension,
[2:10:18.860 --> 2:10:21.860]  have a strategy of peace.
[2:10:21.860 --> 2:10:26.860]  But we'll get Mr. Boyle's take on why the establishment is so upset at Trump
[2:10:26.860 --> 2:10:32.860]  and his inside baseball take on what's currently happening as he takes off his lunch break as a professor.
[2:10:32.860 --> 2:10:34.860]  Thanks for joining us. Good to have you on.
[2:10:34.860 --> 2:10:37.860]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[2:10:37.860 --> 2:10:41.860]  I'm glad the two of us were not censored off here.
[2:10:41.860 --> 2:10:44.860]  Well, we still on a few hundred radio stations and still on our own platform,
[2:10:44.860 --> 2:10:47.860]  but they've censored us pretty much everywhere else.
[2:10:47.860 --> 2:10:49.860]  Right, I know.
[2:10:49.860 --> 2:10:54.860]  And I can't understand why they censored your colleague there, Mr. Knight.
[2:10:54.860 --> 2:10:56.860]  I've given him several interviews.
[2:10:56.860 --> 2:10:59.860]  He's a very low key type guy.
[2:10:59.860 --> 2:11:02.860]  He's a very calm, professorly person, isn't he?
[2:11:02.860 --> 2:11:05.860]  And he had nine million subscribers on iTunes,
[2:11:05.860 --> 2:11:07.860]  just where he was, had more than I did.
[2:11:07.860 --> 2:11:09.860]  And they just, they banned him.
[2:11:09.860 --> 2:11:11.860]  Isn't that horrible?
[2:11:11.860 --> 2:11:12.860]  It is.
[2:11:12.860 --> 2:11:16.860]  And they're doing, you know, in fairness, they're doing the same thing to the left, too.
[2:11:16.860 --> 2:11:22.860]  I know I said a little note there to Mr. Knight when I heard he had heart surgery
[2:11:22.860 --> 2:11:24.860]  and wishing him well.
[2:11:24.860 --> 2:11:26.860]  Well, he's doing good.
[2:11:26.860 --> 2:11:33.860]  So, I mean, how would you quantify the geopolitical point we're at right now, Professor?
[2:11:33.860 --> 2:11:39.860]  Well, you know, following Mr. Trump from the beginning,
[2:11:39.860 --> 2:11:45.860]  I think you're right that, you know, his, his pronounced instincts have been correct.
[2:11:45.860 --> 2:11:51.860]  But right now, he has what could only be said.
[2:11:51.860 --> 2:11:57.860]  You know, these, these highly ideological neo-conservative warmongers,
[2:11:57.860 --> 2:12:03.860]  like Bolton and Pompeo, giving him advice.
[2:12:03.860 --> 2:12:09.860]  And, and I'm not here to, you know, criticize President Trump for this.
[2:12:09.860 --> 2:12:12.860]  He was a businessman making a fortune.
[2:12:12.860 --> 2:12:14.860]  Professor, we're not, we're not a cult.
[2:12:14.860 --> 2:12:16.860]  We're going to criticize Trump all you want.
[2:12:16.860 --> 2:12:19.860]  I agree with your call to impeach people like Bolton before they start World War III,
[2:12:19.860 --> 2:12:22.860]  because this will derail our recovery and start a larger war.
[2:12:22.860 --> 2:12:23.860]  So just go right at it.
[2:12:23.860 --> 2:12:25.860]  What do you think is really happening here?
[2:12:25.860 --> 2:12:26.860]  Right.
[2:12:26.860 --> 2:12:34.860]  Well, I think Trump should immediately fire Bolton and also Pompeo and get rid of both of them.
[2:12:34.860 --> 2:12:43.860]  They were encouraging him to attack Iran, which would have set off a massive war between our two countries.
[2:12:43.860 --> 2:12:51.860]  Also, Bolton and Pompeo sabotage that Hanoi agreement that President Trump was,
[2:12:51.860 --> 2:12:59.860]  was about to conclude with Kim Jong-un over North Korea and the denuclearization of nuclear weapons.
[2:12:59.860 --> 2:13:01.860]  And you said that at the time last year.
[2:13:01.860 --> 2:13:04.860]  That's now been confirmed that they did sabotage it.
[2:13:04.860 --> 2:13:05.860]  They sabotage it.
[2:13:05.860 --> 2:13:07.860]  I mean, that, that agreement was there.
[2:13:07.860 --> 2:13:14.860]  And, and certainly, well, I mean, Bolton is about my age, Yale Law School.
[2:13:14.860 --> 2:13:15.860]  Okay.
[2:13:15.860 --> 2:13:18.860]  Pompeo behind me at Harvard Law School.
[2:13:18.860 --> 2:13:36.860]  Certainly they knew that when they sabotage that in Hanoi, that was done deliberately to cause grave loss of face for Kim Jong-un back in Korea in that Asian culture, which he did.
[2:13:36.860 --> 2:13:39.860]  Now, again, I'm not criticizing President Trump.
[2:13:39.860 --> 2:13:44.860]  These are the two advisors he has surrounding him.
[2:13:44.860 --> 2:13:50.860]  What do you think the thinking was to bring in, because you could say Pompeo wasn't as bad, but now he's shown himself to be in line with Neocons.
[2:13:50.860 --> 2:13:57.860]  Bolton, I mean, I get having your enemies close, but Bolton, I wouldn't trust Bolton as far as I could throw him.
[2:13:57.860 --> 2:13:58.860]  Well, that's right.
[2:13:58.860 --> 2:14:01.860]  I think you and I discussed this before with respect to Bolton.
[2:14:01.860 --> 2:14:09.860]  But all the reports were that Bolton was the bootlicker of Sheldon Adelson.
[2:14:09.860 --> 2:14:19.860]  Adelson is a big contributor and supporter for the Republican Party and President Trump, and that's who got him the job.
[2:14:19.860 --> 2:14:22.860]  Which, by the way, no Koch brother money, no Wall Street money.
[2:14:22.860 --> 2:14:23.860]  You're right.
[2:14:23.860 --> 2:14:26.860]  Adelson reportedly put in $100 million.
[2:14:26.860 --> 2:14:27.860]  Yeah.
[2:14:27.860 --> 2:14:29.860]  There's a large amount of money.
[2:14:29.860 --> 2:14:34.860]  So Bolton's position there was bought and paid for by Adelson.
[2:14:34.860 --> 2:14:40.860]  And I think President Trump needs to fire him and Pompeo immediately.
[2:14:40.860 --> 2:14:41.860]  Well, let me ask Adelson this.
[2:14:41.860 --> 2:14:43.860]  I'm not against Israel existing.
[2:14:43.860 --> 2:14:46.860]  But what is Adelson thinks going to happen when we attack Iran?
[2:14:46.860 --> 2:14:48.860]  They're going to attack Israel.
[2:14:48.860 --> 2:14:50.860]  So that is correct.
[2:14:50.860 --> 2:15:08.860]  Well, as a matter of fact, last week, Israel had massive war maneuvers right there on the border with Lebanon, clearly anticipating an attack on Iran that would then blow up with Hezbollah attacking them.
[2:15:08.860 --> 2:15:11.860]  And they've got maybe 20,000 missiles there.
[2:15:11.860 --> 2:15:23.860]  So yeah, if President Trump had followed the advice of Pompeo and Bolton and also bloody Gina Haspel of the CIA, we'd be at war with Iran right now.
[2:15:23.860 --> 2:15:24.860]  Massive war.
[2:15:24.860 --> 2:15:35.860]  The whole Middle East would have blown up all the way from Turkey and Lebanon down through Israel to the boot of the Saudi Peninsula.
[2:15:35.860 --> 2:15:40.860]  There's no question about it and massive loss of life on all sides.
[2:15:40.860 --> 2:15:47.860]  So fortunately, the president at the last minute, I think, realized this and rejected this.
[2:15:47.860 --> 2:15:48.860]  Well, stay there.
[2:15:48.860 --> 2:15:50.860]  Let's talk about, Professor, why do you think he realized that?
[2:15:50.860 --> 2:15:52.860]  And you've been a top advisor on these treaties.
[2:15:52.860 --> 2:16:21.860]  What do you think Trump should do?
[2:16:23.860 --> 2:16:25.860]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[2:16:25.860 --> 2:16:29.860]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:16:29.860 --> 2:16:30.860]  I sued the IRS in one.
[2:16:30.860 --> 2:16:33.860]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:16:33.860 --> 2:16:39.860]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[2:16:39.860 --> 2:16:40.860]  I can help you too.
[2:16:40.860 --> 2:16:43.860]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[2:16:43.860 --> 2:16:45.860]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[2:16:45.860 --> 2:16:53.860]  Call 834-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[2:17:16.860 --> 2:17:19.860]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[2:17:19.860 --> 2:17:21.860]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[2:17:21.860 --> 2:17:26.860]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[2:17:26.860 --> 2:17:28.860]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:17:28.860 --> 2:17:56.860]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[2:17:56.860 --> 2:18:02.860]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[2:18:02.860 --> 2:18:11.860]  And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stocked full of high quality Info Wars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[2:18:11.860 --> 2:18:23.860]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[2:18:23.860 --> 2:18:28.860]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[2:18:28.860 --> 2:18:32.860]  There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars.
[2:18:32.860 --> 2:18:39.860]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[2:18:39.860 --> 2:18:42.860]  Order now at the Info Wars store.
[2:18:42.860 --> 2:18:50.860]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door.
[2:18:50.860 --> 2:18:55.860]  At InfoWarsStore.com
[2:19:20.860 --> 2:19:28.860]  This is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, Info Wars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[2:19:28.860 --> 2:19:34.860]  And so we've reached that point. It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we have withstood so many of their attacks.
[2:19:34.860 --> 2:19:38.860]  We've gone through so much because of your support. You have been there.
[2:19:38.860 --> 2:19:43.860]  But let me tell you, they are pissed they haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault.
[2:19:43.860 --> 2:19:49.860]  So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:19:49.860 --> 2:19:55.860]  It's your fight. Decide whether or not you want InfoWars to continue because we could be shut down.
[2:20:19.860 --> 2:20:47.860]  If you... Do you feel like you were being pushed into military action against Iran by any of your advisers?
[2:20:47.860 --> 2:20:52.860]  I have two groups of people. I have doves and I have hawks. I have some hawks.
[2:20:52.860 --> 2:20:57.860]  John Bolden is absolutely a hawk. It's up to him. He'd take on the whole world at one time.
[2:20:57.860 --> 2:21:01.860]  But that doesn't matter because I want both sides. Some people said, why did you put...
[2:21:01.860 --> 2:21:05.860]  You know, I was against going into Iraq for years and years and before it ever happened.
[2:21:05.860 --> 2:21:09.860]  I was against going into Iraq and some people said, oh, I don't know. I was totally against.
[2:21:09.860 --> 2:21:14.860]  I was a private citizen. It never made sense to me. I was against going into the Middle East.
[2:21:14.860 --> 2:21:18.860]  We spent $7 trillion in the Middle East right now.
[2:21:18.860 --> 2:21:26.860]  Yeah, that's why I supported President Trump. He was a Republican that wasn't foaming at the mouth, wanting to attack everybody.
[2:21:26.860 --> 2:21:32.860]  The Democrats in major polls, Gallup polls, support war now because they think it's anti-Trump.
[2:21:32.860 --> 2:21:36.860]  Trump's has pulled out of Afghanistan. The Pentagon ignored him.
[2:21:36.860 --> 2:21:40.860]  And that's the neocons at the top of it. The average military person is great.
[2:21:40.860 --> 2:21:44.860]  After Professor Boyle leaves this, I was told about this by James O'Keefe this morning.
[2:21:44.860 --> 2:21:47.860]  My producer was, he said, watch for it.
[2:21:47.860 --> 2:21:54.860]  Breaking new Google document leak described Shapiro Prager as Nazis using dog whistles, calls for them to be shut down.
[2:21:54.860 --> 2:21:59.860]  Ted Cruz grills Google executives in hearing following explosive by Project Veritas.
[2:21:59.860 --> 2:22:05.860]  This video is all coming up in the fourth hour with Paul Joseph Watson today. This is a big deal.
[2:22:05.860 --> 2:22:11.860]  Getting back to Professor Dr. Francis Boyle, who's advised U.S. government on biological weapons treaties.
[2:22:11.860 --> 2:22:14.860]  Help co-author him. You name it. Really smart cookie.
[2:22:14.860 --> 2:22:20.860]  Finishing up, I don't think the world understands. This isn't like we go into Libya and it's a banana republic.
[2:22:20.860 --> 2:22:24.860]  Or we go into Iraq and we've got already owned half their operatives and they stand down.
[2:22:24.860 --> 2:22:31.860]  This is Iran. And I've talked to family that's been in special operations, officers down to special forces, down to helicopter pilots.
[2:22:31.860 --> 2:22:37.860]  Iran's had nukes for a long time. They don't have delivery systems. They are ready for war with no technology.
[2:22:37.860 --> 2:22:42.860]  They killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. We killed over a million of them in the Iran-Iraq war.
[2:22:42.860 --> 2:22:47.860]  They've got sleeper cells all over the place. They've got 100,000 missiles aimed at Israel.
[2:22:47.860 --> 2:22:51.860]  Why would certain, because I'm not anti-Israel. I want peace.
[2:22:51.860 --> 2:23:00.860]  Why would certain elements of Israel and Saudi Arabia want war with Iran knowing it's going to, I think, be unwinnable
[2:23:00.860 --> 2:23:07.860]  with the stay-behind networks of Hezbollah that they've got all over the world, especially when Israel, what, seven, eight years ago,
[2:23:07.860 --> 2:23:15.860]  lost a war against Hezbollah in, you know, just north of Israel and Lebanon?
[2:23:15.860 --> 2:23:22.860]  Well, I can't speak for Israel and Saudi Arabia. I can only speak for the United States of America.
[2:23:22.860 --> 2:23:33.860]  I'm a citizen of law professor. And right now, if Oltan and Pompeo stay in there, they're going to get us into a war with Iran.
[2:23:33.860 --> 2:23:51.860]  The latest steps just taken yesterday, the cyber attack, the crashing of the Ayatollah Khomeini, the sanctioning of the foreign minister.
[2:23:51.860 --> 2:23:58.860]  I saw President Trump reading from a script. That script obviously had been given to him by someone else.
[2:23:58.860 --> 2:24:05.860]  No, I agree. So let's say this. They're trying to start a war. They may get one. A, how do we stop it? B, I'm not for war with Venezuela,
[2:24:05.860 --> 2:24:12.860]  but wouldn't the neocons wanted that? Wouldn't they have been satiated with a regime change there? Wouldn't taking out, I'm not saying do it,
[2:24:12.860 --> 2:24:19.860]  professor, law professor, but also historian, wouldn't it be better to take out Venezuela and less dangerous than Iran?
[2:24:19.860 --> 2:24:30.860]  Well, we don't have to do either. I mean, again, my assessment of the situation, President Trump can negotiate settlements here with Iran,
[2:24:30.860 --> 2:24:43.860]  with North Korea, with Venezuela, with China, with Russia. I follow all of these conflicts and disputes. He is never going to settle any of them with Oltan and Pompeo there.
[2:24:43.860 --> 2:24:52.860]  So I think he's got to get rid of Oltan and Pompeo immediately. Secretary of State, I would recommend bringing in Senator Rand Paul,
[2:24:52.860 --> 2:25:00.860]  who's made a lot of sense. Senator, I think he'd do a great job.
[2:25:00.860 --> 2:25:08.860]  Can he do that? I mean, constitutionally, I mean, because we need that Kentucky seat. Can he be an official advisor on the cabinet,
[2:25:08.860 --> 2:25:18.860]  at the same time? No, he would have to leave. And I don't know how that would work out politically there in Kentucky.
[2:25:18.860 --> 2:25:28.860]  But just looking around the Republican establishment, which unfortunately, you know, he had a lot of raving lunatics there these days.
[2:25:28.860 --> 2:25:34.860]  It wasn't that way when I was a kid. But I think Senator Paul is the most reasonable one they have.
[2:25:34.860 --> 2:25:41.860]  He might do it for the good of the country, because really, right now, we need someone like Senator Paul and Pompeo to get out of there.
[2:25:41.860 --> 2:25:55.860]  You have to understand Pompeo is a member of this fretteless society that are highly ideological, diehard, neoconservative, warmonger, totalitarian.
[2:25:55.860 --> 2:26:03.860]  You and I have discussed the fretteless society before and how pernicious and nefarious they are.
[2:26:03.860 --> 2:26:09.860]  And I want you to come back for a full hour soon. We can even do a commercial free hour or two hours, a special report going through the whole history of this,
[2:26:09.860 --> 2:26:16.860]  because I know you're one of the primitive experts, but the two minutes or three minutes we have left, I was taught a lot by Roger Stone before he was gagged.
[2:26:16.860 --> 2:26:21.860]  And when you say Roger's good, he's bad. But when it comes to Trump watching, he knows his stuff. He said, watch.
[2:26:21.860 --> 2:26:27.860]  When Trump's praising somebody, he likes them. They're on their way out. When he starts saying, are they good? Are they crazy?
[2:26:27.860 --> 2:26:34.860]  That means he's already planning to get rid of them. When he says they're causing a problem, what do they want me to do? He plans to get rid of them.
[2:26:34.860 --> 2:26:40.860]  And so when Trump says, do you want to fight the whole world and that Bolton's nuts? That means he is planning to get rid of him.
[2:26:40.860 --> 2:26:45.860]  The problem is, it means Trump's looking for a replacement. So I think you've gone there. That'd be a Rand Paul.
[2:26:45.860 --> 2:26:48.860]  Rand Paul would be excellent. Yes.
[2:26:48.860 --> 2:26:52.860]  Who else then? Because he probably won't leave the Senate.
[2:26:52.860 --> 2:27:00.860]  We need someone like Senator Paul in there. And I'd be happy to help Senator Paul if he wanted my help. Sure.
[2:27:00.860 --> 2:27:08.860]  Who else if Paul can't do it? He's going to probably stay in the Senate. Who else is out there that could be on a list for Trump to get that isn't a warmonger?
[2:27:08.860 --> 2:27:12.860]  Well, I don't know. I really have to think of it between you and me.
[2:27:12.860 --> 2:27:19.860]  Because there's not a big pool for Trump to pull from. People keep asking why he has all these bad people. This is the swamp. It's filled with these creatures.
[2:27:19.860 --> 2:27:30.860]  You're correct. And we have the Neoconservatives, the Heritage Foundation, this new acting Secretary of Defense, Espers from the Heritage Foundation.
[2:27:30.860 --> 2:27:41.860]  They're all raving lunatics over there, along with Bolton. And remember, Alex Bolton was on the project for the New American Century Report, which we discussed before.
[2:27:41.860 --> 2:27:43.860]  Which is the blueprint for 9-11.
[2:27:43.860 --> 2:27:54.860]  Right. That calls for a new Pearl Harbor. Well, we almost had that last week when Bolton sent that PC Orion up there.
[2:27:54.860 --> 2:28:09.860]  As we know, and hands have been reported, not only was a drone up there, but they sent an Orion into questionable areas by the drone, hoping the Iranians would think both were global hawks and shoot them both down.
[2:28:09.860 --> 2:28:24.860]  That's correct. I think your assessment of that situation is correct. That Bolton and the rest of them were dangling that PC Orion out there as bait for the Iranians to take to set off a war.
[2:28:24.860 --> 2:28:39.860]  And we're fortunate that the Iranians only shot down the drone and realized the implication of shooting down an Orion and killing those 27 service people. We'd be at war today.
[2:28:39.860 --> 2:28:44.860]  Professor Boyle, we're out of time. What's the best website for folks to visit, or what's your newest book?
[2:28:44.860 --> 2:28:53.860]  My newest book, Poems Against the Empire. My poetic reflections on 50 years of fighting the American Empire.
[2:28:53.860 --> 2:28:54.860]  All right.

[2:33:13.860 --> 2:33:24.860]  Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:33:24.860 --> 2:33:31.860]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:31.860 --> 2:33:45.860]  Let's go to grudgereport.com again. Oh, there's billions of websites. There's only one grudgereport.com. And that's where, at the top of the middle column,
[2:33:45.860 --> 2:33:54.860]  Update. Insider reveals Google plan to prevent Trump situation in 2020. Manipulating algorithm. YouTube pulls video showing their head of censorship.
[2:33:54.860 --> 2:34:00.860]  Saying we'll stop Trump from winning. Admitting all the censorship. Admitting they perjured themselves to Congress.
[2:34:00.860 --> 2:34:08.860]  Corporate media ignores. And now Google execs. Delete social media accounts that were James O'Keeffe's latest expose.
[2:34:08.860 --> 2:34:17.860]  And then we've got even more. Infowars.com. Kit Daniels out of the park article.
[2:34:17.860 --> 2:34:33.860]  Fox News is two days into this. Fox News is two days into this. And they've not reported on Project Veritas Google bombshell report where they admit
[2:34:33.860 --> 2:34:42.860]  they're stealing the election in every way. I just had my producer in here were doing hand signals and I'm not good at hand signals.
[2:34:42.860 --> 2:34:48.860]  Oh, it's not a big deal. Because I texted it to you and my phone's been messed up. It doesn't send text anymore.
[2:34:48.860 --> 2:34:54.860]  They got updated a few weeks ago and it's essentially worthless at this point. I'm going to have to get a whole new phone number, probably.
[2:34:54.860 --> 2:35:00.860]  So we have a corruption of the file or something along those lines. Everybody goes, oh, your phone's working fine.
[2:35:00.860 --> 2:35:16.860]  Even though half of folks can't text. Judge to reconsider dismissal motion in rally defamation case. Or just type Alex Jones into Google or into go or pop, pop, go or Bing or whatever you want.
[2:35:16.860 --> 2:35:25.860]  And you'll get the Martinsville bulletin. Judge to reconsider dismissal motion in rally defamation case.
[2:35:25.860 --> 2:35:37.860]  And we'll spend a few hours waiting for that. Everything's good. And then we'll talk about it. But as I was saying, ladies and gentlemen, a lot of big historical things are unfolding.
[2:35:37.860 --> 2:35:47.860]  A lot of big historical things are taking place. And the fact that big mega tech has been set up by DARPA and our government to dominate the world.
[2:35:47.860 --> 2:35:57.860]  Well, now they've the globalists have taken it over this being used to dominate us. And so we've spent years hammering that Google's been compromised in Apple and Facebook and Twitter.
[2:35:57.860 --> 2:36:11.860]  And they just go to Congress and they lie about it all. And they say none of us true. And then we get the head Google executive over censorship via project veritas on video admitting it all.
[2:36:11.860 --> 2:36:24.860]  And it's an incredible moment. An absolutely incredible moment as the whole thing falls apart. Now, this isn't about Alex Jones. This is about reality.
[2:36:24.860 --> 2:36:34.860]  But you saw the law firm Democratic Party law firm suing me in Connecticut for stuff I never said about Sandy Hook, which if I said it, I have a right to say.
[2:36:34.860 --> 2:36:50.860]  And then they they provided a transcript unsigned last week saying I said white Jew boy. When I said these elite white shoe boy firms, which is the definition is Yale and Harvard aren't going to stop me.
[2:36:50.860 --> 2:37:00.860]  They're like, Oh, we'll stop you. White Jew boy. We'll put that up. But you know, it all got retracted. Just like the child molestation stuff, you know, all that stuff.
[2:37:00.860 --> 2:37:10.860]  None of it's working. The child porn garbage, all of it. Yeah, that's the original story. They go to raw story. They retracted it.
[2:37:10.860 --> 2:37:17.860]  So, so that's where all this is going. And that's how these groups operate.
[2:37:17.860 --> 2:37:35.860]  And it just shows they'll go to any length necessary. Even though these groups don't believe in due process, they will use our due process system against us.
[2:37:35.860 --> 2:37:53.860]  So the issues we're going to cover here today are absolutely essential. But you can bet that whether it's the Democratic Party saying that.
[2:37:53.860 --> 2:38:06.860]  Judge Kavanaugh. Rape them and none of it's true or whether it's them saying I'm sending child porn out that isn't true or I'm running around saying white Jew boy that isn't true.
[2:38:06.860 --> 2:38:21.860]  They don't have any rules. Like the weird Trump rape accusers saying rape is sexy during was our CNN meltdown or Jesse smaller any of this these are followers who believe in the system.
[2:38:21.860 --> 2:38:29.860]  And they believe if they just break the rules for the system, they'll be rewarded, but they're not being rewarded.
[2:38:29.860 --> 2:38:37.860]  Now, I wanted to bring syndicated radio host least training on because it's not about least training and it's not about all Jones.
[2:38:37.860 --> 2:38:46.860]  It's about remember a year and a half ago that lawsuit filed in Virginia against he and I and sweet little Leanne McAdoo.
[2:38:46.860 --> 2:38:55.860]  She's smart, but she's sweet. She had him on as a guest. He said nothing, but she was sued to teach her to shut her mouth.
[2:38:55.860 --> 2:39:01.860]  And they said that we said stuff we never said.
[2:39:01.860 --> 2:39:12.860]  And so the judge allowed the lawsuit to go forward preliminary and believe things in their brief that were not true.
[2:39:12.860 --> 2:39:22.860]  Well, guess what? The judge did something rare. He's announced another hearing, not just on jurisdiction, but in general, we're being told because he's gotten the word.
[2:39:22.860 --> 2:39:28.860]  I'm talking to lawyers have a show today about this that what they were told in these briefings is not accurate.
[2:39:28.860 --> 2:39:37.860]  Now, it's one thing for lawyers to play games and filings, but when they're totally not true, it's another animal entirely.
[2:39:37.860 --> 2:39:45.860]  So again, yeah, everybody knows the Democrats lie will wait till they sue you.
[2:39:45.860 --> 2:39:54.860]  All we ever said is George Soros funded Nazis in Ukraine with very same tiki torches to March and overthrow the government.
[2:39:54.860 --> 2:40:02.860]  It wasn't funny that a lot of these former Democrats that work for Obama that work for his campaign a year later and it worked for Hillary were carrying tiki torches.
[2:40:02.860 --> 2:40:08.860]  We said it funny, a guy that worked the State Department for Hillary, he catches lady getting killed on camera. They just knew it was going to be a melee.
[2:40:08.860 --> 2:40:18.860]  Soros funded the leftist anti for to come out. We think the right wing was funded. There's a lot of evidence it was to create a false riot.
[2:40:18.860 --> 2:40:23.860]  Now, whether that's right or not, it's our right to ask that question. And a lot of evidence shows that's the case.
[2:40:23.860 --> 2:40:32.860]  We never said that the man that photoed journalists that took the photography of the woman dying that he was that he killed her.
[2:40:32.860 --> 2:40:45.860]  We said he was a leftist in all part of this big conflagration and that Soros ordered the police to stand down and the Democrats ordered that and then it was their fault, not his, but Soros's.
[2:40:45.860 --> 2:40:55.860]  And in America, we were sued for that to teach us to shut our mouths so that we wouldn't be around at future events.
[2:40:55.860 --> 2:41:03.860]  So that we wouldn't question future events because it turned out there was crisis actor companies that hired people for a month for the event.
[2:41:03.860 --> 2:41:16.860]  I mean, there weren't real white supremacist or real method antifa, but most of them on both sides were hired to say things and do things with all this nation full of people that want to be actors that want to have a Netflix show.
[2:41:16.860 --> 2:41:25.860]  Hell, half the kids you talk to want to be actors. There's not the slots, but there were real companies that hired real crisis actors, real protesters.
[2:41:25.860 --> 2:41:33.860]  You can hire a fake protest if you want online in for a couple thousand dollars, 20 people show up for a hundred thousand dollars.
[2:41:33.860 --> 2:41:39.860]  Thousands will show up. Tens of thousands of you spend a million. It's called a rent a mob.
[2:41:39.860 --> 2:41:44.860]  So for pointing out Astro Turf and a rent a mob, this happened. Lee, we got shot late.
[2:41:44.860 --> 2:41:47.860]  I apologize. We're going to go to break. Come back and finish with you.
[2:41:47.860 --> 2:41:55.860]  I want you to set the record straight because the judge has suddenly reversed himself and said he's going to have another hearing on this. This is pretty good news.
[2:41:55.860 --> 2:42:03.860]  Well, yeah, I'm really glad that they're going to have another hearing, Alex, because, you know, one of the things I'm just going to be the most minor point.
[2:42:03.860 --> 2:42:08.860]  It's not a free speech point. They claim that I'm a resident of Texas.
[2:42:08.860 --> 2:42:17.860]  I have literally not lived in Texas for, I think, three or four years now. I used to live in Dallas and I haven't lived there.
[2:42:17.860 --> 2:42:23.860]  And the reason they did this is a minor technical point. But the reason they did it were being sued in a Virginia court.
[2:42:23.860 --> 2:42:30.860]  I live in Virginia and they can't sue federally if I'm a resident of Virginia. So they blatantly lied.
[2:42:30.860 --> 2:42:35.860]  I've been doing a radio show. Anybody can check my social media records, everything.
[2:42:35.860 --> 2:42:41.860]  I live in Virginia now. I've been living in Virginia since about just a couple months after the inauguration.
[2:42:41.860 --> 2:42:48.860]  I moved out here when I was with Breitbart. And then I've left Breitbart since then, host a radio show, a radio sputnik.
[2:42:48.860 --> 2:42:53.860]  But I've been out here. That basic point needs to be adjudicated again.
[2:42:53.860 --> 2:43:01.860]  And aside from info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so.
[2:43:01.860 --> 2:43:05.860]  It's Orwellian. It's biblical. It's authoritarian. It's insane.
[2:43:05.860 --> 2:43:14.860]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say,
[2:43:14.860 --> 2:43:19.860]  hey, we're sinking. I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat.
[2:43:19.860 --> 2:43:27.860]  But this is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, info wars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[2:43:27.860 --> 2:43:33.860]  And so we've reached that point. It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we have withstood so many of their attacks.
[2:43:33.860 --> 2:43:39.860]  We've gone through so much because of your support. You have, you have been there, but let me tell you, they are pissed.
[2:43:39.860 --> 2:43:42.860]  They haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault.
[2:43:42.860 --> 2:43:48.860]  So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now at info wars.com.
[2:43:48.860 --> 2:43:54.860]  It's your fight. Decide whether or not you want info wars to continue because we could be shut down.
[2:43:54.860 --> 2:43:58.860]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[2:43:58.860 --> 2:44:06.860]  The other thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[2:44:06.860 --> 2:44:10.860]  That's not backed by some billionaire. That's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[2:44:10.860 --> 2:44:12.860]  It is completely independent of all that.
[2:44:12.860 --> 2:44:19.860]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech.
[2:44:19.860 --> 2:44:26.860]  That in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[2:44:26.860 --> 2:44:28.860]  because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[2:44:28.860 --> 2:44:33.860]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[2:44:33.860 --> 2:44:39.860]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear.
[2:44:39.860 --> 2:44:42.860]  And the info wars audience has broken through that.
[2:44:42.860 --> 2:44:47.860]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[2:44:47.860 --> 2:44:54.860]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation, lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[2:44:56.860 --> 2:45:00.860]  I just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[2:45:00.860 --> 2:45:04.860]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50% off.
[2:45:04.860 --> 2:45:08.860]  But we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[2:45:08.860 --> 2:45:10.860]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price.
[2:45:10.860 --> 2:45:12.860]  And we're moving a ton of it.
[2:45:12.860 --> 2:45:17.860]  Okay, but you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get $20,000.
[2:45:17.860 --> 2:45:19.860]  That doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew.
[2:45:19.860 --> 2:45:22.860]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product.
[2:45:22.860 --> 2:45:24.860]  I want to expand, not contract.
[2:45:24.860 --> 2:45:26.860]  And for six months we've not decided to stand still.
[2:45:26.860 --> 2:45:27.860]  The enemy's been winning.
[2:45:27.860 --> 2:45:31.860]  And I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[2:45:31.860 --> 2:45:33.860]  I like to be expanding. I like to be winning. I like to be fighting.
[2:45:33.860 --> 2:45:35.860]  And we are winning the info war. That's why we're so hated.
[2:45:35.860 --> 2:45:37.860]  But we need to be retreaded.
[2:45:37.860 --> 2:45:39.860]  We need to be tuned up. We need to be fixed up.
[2:45:39.860 --> 2:45:42.860]  We never have time to get it dried up. We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[2:45:42.860 --> 2:45:44.860]  And the enemy wants to silence us.
[2:45:44.860 --> 2:45:47.860]  Then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[2:45:47.860 --> 2:45:49.860]  Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else.
[2:45:49.860 --> 2:45:53.860]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks and the Chai comms.
[2:45:53.860 --> 2:45:55.860]  So go to infowarstore.com.
[2:45:55.860 --> 2:45:58.860]  I want to be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[2:45:58.860 --> 2:46:00.860]  We're going into the season of war.
[2:46:00.860 --> 2:46:03.860]  And they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have.
[2:46:03.860 --> 2:46:06.860]  Do their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[2:46:06.860 --> 2:46:10.860]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[2:46:10.860 --> 2:46:12.860]  We need to end here. We need to be provisioned.
[2:46:12.860 --> 2:46:16.860]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[2:46:16.860 --> 2:46:20.860]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[2:46:20.860 --> 2:46:22.860]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[2:46:22.860 --> 2:46:26.860]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[2:46:26.860 --> 2:46:27.860]  That just brings more people here.
[2:46:27.860 --> 2:46:29.860]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you.
[2:46:29.860 --> 2:46:33.860]  And I need war bonds. I need gas. I need ammo politically now.
[2:46:33.860 --> 2:46:37.860]  But literally if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases
[2:46:37.860 --> 2:46:41.860]  and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable. We're unstoppable together.
[2:46:41.860 --> 2:46:44.860]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy. I want to raise a couple million dollars right now
[2:46:44.860 --> 2:46:48.860]  to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us.
[2:46:48.860 --> 2:46:50.860]  And I will never back down to have my commitment.
[2:46:50.860 --> 2:47:05.860]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[2:47:20.860 --> 2:47:22.860]  We're skipping right to the end.
[2:47:22.860 --> 2:47:27.860]  At the distance. I'm going to stop.
[2:47:27.860 --> 2:47:35.860]  Just a man is willing to survive.
[2:47:35.860 --> 2:47:37.860]  All right, coming up next segment.
[2:47:37.860 --> 2:47:40.860]  Ted Cruz today just happened to be a big Google hearing.
[2:47:40.860 --> 2:47:43.860]  Senator took him to the woodshed and knocked it out of the park.
[2:47:43.860 --> 2:47:46.860]  And Paul Watson's coming up.
[2:47:46.860 --> 2:47:51.860]  Getting back to the least strand of hand, Lee, you're bringing up the fact that the way you've gotten this new hearing
[2:47:51.860 --> 2:47:55.860]  is the evidence that the jurisdictionally they're wrong.
[2:47:55.860 --> 2:48:04.860]  And it's rare, I'm told by my lawyers, three of them, including one over DC, one in Connecticut, one in LA.
[2:48:04.860 --> 2:48:06.860]  This would happen. So this bodes well.
[2:48:06.860 --> 2:48:11.860]  They say not just on the jurisdictional, but that they now have been listening to you and others.
[2:48:11.860 --> 2:48:14.860]  And the briefs that we never said any of the stuff that's there.
[2:48:14.860 --> 2:48:17.860]  These are false quotes. These are false statements that we've been demanding.
[2:48:17.860 --> 2:48:19.860]  They bring forth the real quotes.
[2:48:19.860 --> 2:48:24.860]  Just like they said with me and the jubilee comment that I never said that they're getting desperate.
[2:48:24.860 --> 2:48:29.860]  So I want to get to the jurisdictional, but let's get back because you're the expert on this recap.
[2:48:29.860 --> 2:48:34.860]  We never said this thing about white supremacy claim.
[2:48:34.860 --> 2:48:42.860]  You were talking about Ukraine, which is admitted that the Ukraine opposition was funded by Soros and the State Department.
[2:48:42.860 --> 2:48:45.860]  I mean, hell, the State Department admitted that.
[2:48:45.860 --> 2:48:49.860]  Well, not just that, Alex. Let's point out what they're really afraid of here.
[2:48:49.860 --> 2:48:52.860]  This has now come out in the past few months.
[2:48:52.860 --> 2:48:59.860]  I've been reporting it on, you know, including on Info Wars for two years now,
[2:48:59.860 --> 2:49:05.860]  that a lot of what we're seeing with this Trump-Russia hoax ties into Ukraine.
[2:49:05.860 --> 2:49:07.860]  It directly ties to Ukraine.
[2:49:07.860 --> 2:49:15.860]  For instance, I've talked about the fact that a DNC operative named Alexander Chalupa met with people in the Ukrainian embassy.
[2:49:15.860 --> 2:49:17.860]  She was targeting Paul Manafort.
[2:49:17.860 --> 2:49:25.860]  She was saying that Trump was connected to Russia before Mueller even said that the supposed DNC hack ever happened.
[2:49:25.860 --> 2:49:28.860]  This was a setup the entire time.
[2:49:28.860 --> 2:49:31.860]  I was reporting from the White House on CrowdStrike.
[2:49:31.860 --> 2:49:35.860]  All these things were happening prior to this lawsuit happening.
[2:49:35.860 --> 2:49:40.860]  So what happened was, Alex, there's a film that I saw called Ukraine on Fire
[2:49:40.860 --> 2:49:44.860]  that explains how the United States government under Barack Obama
[2:49:44.860 --> 2:49:48.860]  overthrew the democratically elected government of Ukraine.
[2:49:48.860 --> 2:49:54.860]  And I was saying that what happened after that was they set up a thing called Naboo,
[2:49:54.860 --> 2:49:56.860]  the National Anti-Corruption Bureau Ukraine.
[2:49:56.860 --> 2:49:58.860]  Now, you remember Paul Manafort?
[2:49:58.860 --> 2:50:00.860]  He was the head of the Trump campaign.
[2:50:00.860 --> 2:50:03.860]  In August of 2016, he was taken out.
[2:50:03.860 --> 2:50:05.860]  Why was he taken out?
[2:50:05.860 --> 2:50:10.860]  Because of this fake black ledger that came out through Naboo.
[2:50:10.860 --> 2:50:15.860]  The FBI, James Comey's FBI, has an office at Naboo.
[2:50:15.860 --> 2:50:20.860]  Now, in that film Ukraine on Fire, and by the way, I got to point out part of what they're really afraid of
[2:50:20.860 --> 2:50:24.860]  is in about two weeks the sequel to that film is coming out.
[2:50:24.860 --> 2:50:27.860]  And I'm one of the journalists in that film.
[2:50:27.860 --> 2:50:34.860]  I'm pretty significantly featured in that sequel that's going to be coming out as premiering in July.
[2:50:34.860 --> 2:50:41.860]  And we've shown how the Ukraine connection, and by the way, I didn't just pick Ukraine through a dart,
[2:50:41.860 --> 2:50:48.860]  the malware that was supposedly used, that they claimed was used to do the DNC hack was Ukrainian.
[2:50:48.860 --> 2:50:51.860]  There are these Ukrainian connections everywhere.
[2:50:51.860 --> 2:50:59.860]  So I was reporting on that, and I had seen this film Ukraine on Fire, which showed every January 1st,
[2:50:59.860 --> 2:51:03.860]  they do these, the Nazis over there, these are real Nazis.
[2:51:03.860 --> 2:51:11.860]  These are, you know, the bad guys in Ukraine do a tiki torch march.
[2:51:11.860 --> 2:51:20.860]  And I pointed out when I saw Charlottesville, I was like, hey, that's the thing that I just had seen in this movie a few days ago.
[2:51:20.860 --> 2:51:28.860]  And then the more I looked into it, now it's come out, the FBI has said, they did it in this little Los Angeles court filing,
[2:51:28.860 --> 2:51:36.860]  they connected some of the bad actors in Charlottesville, some of the neo-Nazis had actually gone over to Ukraine.
[2:51:36.860 --> 2:51:39.860]  This is what the FBI said subsequently.
[2:51:39.860 --> 2:51:42.860]  So all I did was point out two things.
[2:51:42.860 --> 2:51:46.860]  Oh, by the way, who is the biggest funder of NGOs in Ukraine?
[2:51:46.860 --> 2:51:48.860]  George Soros, right?
[2:51:48.860 --> 2:51:51.860]  So this guy is suing us, Brennan Gilmore.
[2:51:51.860 --> 2:52:00.860]  He worked for a congressman who was running for governor, who received major funding from George Soros.
[2:52:00.860 --> 2:52:07.860]  Now, he didn't win the gubernatorial raise, but guess who the congressman now works for, literally works for?
[2:52:07.860 --> 2:52:08.860]  George Soros.
[2:52:08.860 --> 2:52:11.860]  He went to work for the Open Societies Foundation.
[2:52:11.860 --> 2:52:15.860]  So there's nothing illegal about pointing out the facts.
[2:52:15.860 --> 2:52:22.860]  Brennan Gilmore, who's the person who shot that, the vehicular murder of Heather Hyer, which I have never said anything,
[2:52:22.860 --> 2:52:24.860]  but that is a horrible crime.
[2:52:24.860 --> 2:52:31.860]  I've never said this guy was, like you said, never said he was responsible for it, never said anything like that.
[2:52:31.860 --> 2:52:37.860]  I pointed out that he worked for the State Department, true, he admits it, and that he had connections to Soros,
[2:52:37.860 --> 2:52:40.860]  and that I saw this Ukraine connection.
[2:52:40.860 --> 2:52:47.860]  And if you look at the Ukrainian real Nazi-Tiki tortures that got put into power by the State Department and Obama
[2:52:47.860 --> 2:52:52.860]  to overthrow Russian control of Eastern Ukraine, it's almost identical.
[2:52:52.860 --> 2:53:00.860]  And then it turns out they did PR hiring on record where Democrats went out and did hire people to come to this.
[2:53:00.860 --> 2:53:05.860]  So it's all been everything we've said is true, so they almost don't even want this to go to trial.
[2:53:05.860 --> 2:53:11.860]  A lot of lawyers I know say, Alex, let it go. Including Barnes in there is like, are you kidding?
[2:53:11.860 --> 2:53:15.860]  Because Barnes knows all this stuff too, and he's like, they're going to be destroyed.
[2:53:15.860 --> 2:53:23.860]  No, that's right. And I really believe, Alex, that part of what's going on here is that they know that this Ukraine connection,
[2:53:23.860 --> 2:53:27.860]  which John Solomon over the hill, finally, after me reporting on it for two years,
[2:53:27.860 --> 2:53:37.860]  Fox News, you know, they're a little slow on this stuff, Alex. Fox News, about two, three months ago, started finally reporting on the Ukraine stuff.
[2:53:37.860 --> 2:53:43.860]  This was after Petro Poroshenko, the guy who was beat by a comedian in the last election.
[2:53:43.860 --> 2:53:49.860]  So you got to understand, don't forget, we overthrew the Democratic, the U.S. government, not you and me,
[2:53:49.860 --> 2:53:53.860]  the U.S. government overthrew the democratically elected government of Ukraine,
[2:53:53.860 --> 2:54:01.860]  put into place Poroshenko, who was behind the coup attempt on Donald Trump.
[2:54:01.860 --> 2:54:05.860]  He was, he never wanted Trump to get elected. He wanted Hillary to get elected.
[2:54:05.860 --> 2:54:08.860]  He was supported by Victor Pinschuk.
[2:54:08.860 --> 2:54:13.860]  They used all the money poured into overthrowing Ukraine to run election meddling in the U.S.
[2:54:13.860 --> 2:54:15.860]  You said it years ago, it's all been confirmed.
[2:54:15.860 --> 2:54:21.860]  In closing, let me ask you this. Why did they sue us then just to teach us to shut our mouths?
[2:54:21.860 --> 2:54:23.860]  Because they're not going to make us shut our mouths.
[2:54:23.860 --> 2:54:25.860]  That just makes us pay more attention to this.
[2:54:25.860 --> 2:54:27.860]  Because they say things we never said.
[2:54:27.860 --> 2:54:31.860]  We just said, looks like Soros is funding the same group in Ukraine and groups here,
[2:54:31.860 --> 2:54:35.860]  and it turns out it's the truth that they just started a big fight in Virginia.
[2:54:35.860 --> 2:54:38.860]  We're not saying the photographer killed that woman. That's asinine.
[2:54:38.860 --> 2:54:44.860]  Not at all. You know, we're literally being sued, Alex, because I shrugged my shoulders.
[2:54:44.860 --> 2:54:49.860]  They say it, they can't point out a single thing that I said that was incorrect.
[2:54:49.860 --> 2:54:53.860]  So what happened was I went like this, and they take that to mean...
[2:54:53.860 --> 2:54:57.860]  Wait, I'm suing you. Do it again, I'll see you twice.
[2:54:57.860 --> 2:54:59.860]  You don't shrug your shoulders at me, buddy.
[2:54:59.860 --> 2:55:01.860]  Do you know why I said that?
[2:55:01.860 --> 2:55:09.860]  Because I had seen this film a few days earlier, and I thought it was a weird sort of cosmic coincidence that a couple days later...
[2:55:09.860 --> 2:55:15.860]  And now the FBI says, oh, lo and behold, international extremism is being funded by people.
[2:55:15.860 --> 2:55:20.860]  No, that's exactly right. So I have been saying for...
[2:55:20.860 --> 2:55:28.860]  I've been a broken record on it that the real scandal here involves elements of the Ukraine.
[2:55:28.860 --> 2:55:34.860]  And by the way, this directly connects to the FBI. It connects to James Comey's FBI.
[2:55:34.860 --> 2:55:38.860]  Sure, the whole fake thing. They use international operations to do domestic things.
[2:55:38.860 --> 2:55:42.860]  Look, they don't want people going out to these events to document what's happening.
[2:55:42.860 --> 2:55:45.860]  They want to punish people, but folks are going to go there because they did this.
[2:55:45.860 --> 2:55:48.860]  All right, Lee Stranahan, thank you for the great work. You do.
[2:55:48.860 --> 2:55:51.860]  CitizensInternalismSchool.com, populist.tv.
[2:55:51.860 --> 2:55:55.860]  You have your weekday morning show that broadcasts all over the world out of D.C.
[2:55:55.860 --> 2:56:00.860]  And that's Fault Lines with you and your great host, Mr. Garland. Thank you.
[2:56:00.860 --> 2:56:02.860]  Thank you, Alex. Keep up the fight.
[2:56:02.860 --> 2:56:08.860]  I'll try. Okay, I've got to get to this Google thing before Paul takes over, and I can talk to Stranahan for five hours.
[2:56:08.860 --> 2:56:13.860]  I just, my lawyers are like, why are we going to fight going to court? Let's just get to a jury trial.
[2:56:13.860 --> 2:56:18.860]  You're going to win. I'm just like, my gut says, stole this as long as possible because more is going to come out,
[2:56:18.860 --> 2:56:24.860]  more smulleting, more, more scams, more staging. I just, my gut's never wrong.
[2:56:24.860 --> 2:56:28.860]  But yeah, we're not scared of jury trials, folks. Nothing they say is real.
[2:56:28.860 --> 2:56:37.860]  They file reports saying, I'm screaming white Jew boy on air, or that I'm sending child porn to people.
[2:56:37.860 --> 2:56:41.860]  Why the hell would I do it? Of course they go later. Well, he didn't actually do it.
[2:56:41.860 --> 2:56:46.860]  But they're like, you like how that feels? Knock yourselves out, man.
[2:56:46.860 --> 2:56:51.860]  Nothing, including a bullet in my head is going to stop us, except our listeners not supporting us.
[2:56:51.860 --> 2:56:55.860]  We're running a giant sale. It's got to end this weekend, store-wide free shipping,
[2:56:55.860 --> 2:57:03.860]  50% off all the award-winning supplements, double-patria points, save info wars, emergency special.
[2:57:03.860 --> 2:57:11.860]  And you can, it says pre-order, but I told them just have order on there because it's already being printed.
[2:57:11.860 --> 2:57:21.860]  Within two weeks, your new ultra limited audition clown world t-shirt will be shipped out to you.
[2:57:21.860 --> 2:57:29.860]  So there's no pre-order, not in the production meeting a week ago, not the one on Monday and not the one on Tuesday.
[2:57:29.860 --> 2:57:33.860]  It is essentially going to be shipped out to you.
[2:57:33.860 --> 2:57:39.860]  We have clown world coverage of the debates tomorrow night and Thursday night. That's right.
[2:57:39.860 --> 2:57:44.860]  We'll be back with the fall of Google and Ted Cruz.
[2:57:44.860 --> 2:57:47.860]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[2:57:47.860 --> 2:57:50.860]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[2:57:50.860 --> 2:57:56.860]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[2:57:56.860 --> 2:58:05.860]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[2:58:05.860 --> 2:58:11.860]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him.
[2:58:11.860 --> 2:58:13.860]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[2:58:13.860 --> 2:58:19.860]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[2:58:19.860 --> 2:58:24.860]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[2:58:24.860 --> 2:58:29.860]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles.
[2:58:29.860 --> 2:58:33.860]  And there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[2:58:33.860 --> 2:58:35.860]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War.
[2:58:35.860 --> 2:58:42.860]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[2:58:42.860 --> 2:58:54.860]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[2:59:13.860 --> 2:59:18.860]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[2:59:18.860 --> 2:59:22.860]  There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars.
[2:59:22.860 --> 2:59:29.860]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[2:59:29.860 --> 2:59:32.860]  Order now at the Info War store.
[2:59:32.860 --> 2:59:40.860]  Sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door.
[2:59:40.860 --> 2:59:47.860]  At infowarstore.com
[2:59:47.860 --> 2:59:54.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:54.860 --> 3:00:05.860]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:05.860 --> 3:00:10.860]  You know, you think cracking Google up is impossible. It's not.
[3:00:10.860 --> 3:00:21.860]  And once there's institutional resistance to something, it's hard to get people to get out of where they've been of letting Google spy on you,
[3:00:21.860 --> 3:00:24.860]  letting Facebook spy on you, letting these groups abuse you.
[3:00:24.860 --> 3:00:26.860]  But once you do it, it's game over.
[3:00:26.860 --> 3:00:36.860]  That's why it made such a big deal out of having the top Google executive or censorship admitting they're going to steal the 2020 election.
[3:00:36.860 --> 3:00:40.860]  So here's Ted Cruz. It's up on infowars.com.
[3:00:40.860 --> 3:00:43.860]  Grilling Google and hearings today about it.
[3:00:43.860 --> 3:00:45.860]  Then Paul Watts is taken over. Here it is.
[3:00:45.860 --> 3:00:55.860]  A lot of Americans have concerns that big tech media companies and Google in particular are engaged in political censorship and bias.
[3:00:55.860 --> 3:01:02.860]  As you know, Google enjoys a special immunity from liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
[3:01:02.860 --> 3:01:11.860]  The predicate for that immunity was that Google and other big tech media companies would be neutral public fora.
[3:01:11.860 --> 3:01:15.860]  Does Google consider itself a neutral public forum?
[3:01:15.860 --> 3:01:19.860]  Thank you, Senator. Yes, it does.
[3:01:19.860 --> 3:01:35.860]  Are you familiar with a report that was released yesterday from Veritas that included a whistleblower from within Google that included videos from a senior executive at Google
[3:01:35.860 --> 3:01:41.860]  and then included documents that are purportedly internal PowerPoint documents from Google?
[3:01:41.860 --> 3:01:46.860]  Yes, I heard about that report in industry news.
[3:01:46.860 --> 3:01:50.860]  Have you seen the report? No, I have not.
[3:01:50.860 --> 3:01:52.860]  So you didn't review the report to prepare for this hearing?
[3:01:52.860 --> 3:01:57.860]  It's been a busy day and I have a day job, which is digital well-being at Google.
[3:01:57.860 --> 3:01:59.860]  So I'm trying to make sure I keep the trains on the track.
[3:01:59.860 --> 3:02:01.860]  Sorry, this hearing isn't pinging on your day job.
[3:02:01.860 --> 3:02:04.860]  It's a great opportunity. Thank you.
[3:02:04.860 --> 3:02:12.860]  Well, one of the things in that report, and I would recommend people interested in political bias at Google watch the entire report and judge for yourself.
[3:02:12.860 --> 3:02:16.860]  There's a video from a woman, Jen Jenai.
[3:02:16.860 --> 3:02:18.860]  It's a secret video that was recorded.
[3:02:18.860 --> 3:02:23.860]  Jen Jenai, as I understand it, is the head of, quote, responsible innovation for Google.
[3:02:23.860 --> 3:02:26.860]  Are you familiar with Ms. Jenai?
[3:02:26.860 --> 3:02:37.860]  I work in user experience and I believe that AI group is somebody we worked with on the AI principles, but it's a big company and I don't work directly with Jen.
[3:02:37.860 --> 3:02:39.860]  Do you know her or no?
[3:02:39.860 --> 3:02:41.860]  I do not know Jen.
[3:02:41.860 --> 3:02:50.860]  As I understand it, she has shown in the video saying, and this is a quote, Elizabeth Warren is saying that we should break up Google.
[3:02:50.860 --> 3:02:54.860]  And like I love her, but she's very misguided.
[3:02:54.860 --> 3:02:56.860]  Like that will not make it better.
[3:02:56.860 --> 3:02:58.860]  It will make it worse.
[3:02:58.860 --> 3:03:07.860]  Because all these smaller companies who don't have the same resources that we do will be charged with preventing the next Trump situation.
[3:03:07.860 --> 3:03:12.860]  It's like a small company cannot do that.
[3:03:12.860 --> 3:03:18.860]  Do you think it's Google's job to, quote, prevent the next Trump situation?
[3:03:18.860 --> 3:03:20.860]  Thank you, Senator.
[3:03:20.860 --> 3:03:22.860]  I don't agree with that.
[3:03:22.860 --> 3:03:23.860]  No, sir.
[3:03:23.860 --> 3:03:29.860]  So a different individual, a whistleblower, identified simply as an insider at Google with knowledge of the algorithm.
[3:03:29.860 --> 3:03:39.860]  It's quoted on the same report as saying Google, quote, is bent on never letting somebody like Donald Trump come to power again.
[3:03:39.860 --> 3:03:47.860]  Do you think it's Google's job to make sure, quote, somebody like Donald Trump never comes to power again?
[3:03:47.860 --> 3:03:48.860]  No, sir.
[3:03:48.860 --> 3:03:50.860]  I don't think that is Google's job.
[3:03:50.860 --> 3:04:03.860]  And we build for everyone, including every single religious belief, every single demographic, every single region, and certainly every political affiliation.
[3:04:03.860 --> 3:04:07.860]  Well, I have to say that that certainly does not appear to be the case.
[3:04:07.860 --> 3:04:14.860]  Of the senior executives at Google, do you know of a single one who voted for Donald Trump?
[3:04:14.860 --> 3:04:15.860]  Thank you, Senator.
[3:04:15.860 --> 3:04:21.860]  I'm a user experience director, and I work on Google Digital Well-Being, and I can tell you we have diverse views.
[3:04:21.860 --> 3:04:22.860]  It's a simple question.
[3:04:22.860 --> 3:04:25.860]  Do you know of anyone who voted for Trump?
[3:04:25.860 --> 3:04:28.860]  I definitely know of people who voted for Trump.
[3:04:28.860 --> 3:04:29.860]  Of the senior executives at Google.
[3:04:29.860 --> 3:04:31.860]  I don't talk politics with my work fate.
[3:04:31.860 --> 3:04:33.860]  Is that a no?
[3:04:33.860 --> 3:04:35.860]  Sorry, is that a no to what?
[3:04:35.860 --> 3:04:41.860]  Do you know of any senior executives, even a single senior executive at the company who voted for Donald Trump?
[3:04:41.860 --> 3:04:46.860]  As the Digital Well-Being expert, I don't think this is in my purview to comment on that.
[3:04:46.860 --> 3:04:47.860]  So you don't know it?
[3:04:47.860 --> 3:04:48.860]  That's all right.
[3:04:48.860 --> 3:04:49.860]  You don't have to know.
[3:04:49.860 --> 3:04:50.860]  I definitely do.
[3:04:53.860 --> 3:05:03.860]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[3:05:03.860 --> 3:05:12.860]  The false claim that you purposely said kitty porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous, as well as false.
[3:05:12.860 --> 3:05:13.860]  It's a smear.
[3:05:13.860 --> 3:05:15.860]  Somebody sends you something that's encrypted.
[3:05:15.860 --> 3:05:17.860]  You don't even open it.
[3:05:17.860 --> 3:05:22.860]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents, and then it's blamed on you.
[3:05:22.860 --> 3:05:24.860]  This is Kafkaesque.
[3:05:24.860 --> 3:05:25.860]  This is bizarre.
[3:05:25.860 --> 3:05:31.860]  But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say, Jones said kitty porn is really outrageous.
[3:05:31.860 --> 3:05:37.860]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified.
[3:05:37.860 --> 3:05:38.860]  But I wonder where are the big boys?
[3:05:38.860 --> 3:05:39.860]  Where's the Wall Street Journal?
[3:05:39.860 --> 3:05:41.860]  Where's Associated Press?
[3:05:41.860 --> 3:05:47.860]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate?
[3:05:47.860 --> 3:06:04.860]  So we both need your help and I urge folks to continue to support Infowars with your dollars.
[3:06:04.860 --> 3:06:13.860]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:06:13.860 --> 3:06:17.860]  I know when I smell blood, I know when stuff's unfolding.
[3:06:17.860 --> 3:06:23.860]  And Google was set up by the NSA and Garpa and the CIA to dominate the world for America.
[3:06:23.860 --> 3:06:28.860]  That's what they told Congress and taxpayers 40 years ago when they set up the whole Internet.
[3:06:28.860 --> 3:06:32.860]  But the whole time it was to set up a world government to survey on script for the banks.
[3:06:32.860 --> 3:06:35.860]  Well, people got aware of that.
[3:06:35.860 --> 3:06:41.860]  And so Google and Facebook and all of them have been lying about the censorship for years.
[3:06:41.860 --> 3:06:44.860]  But now they've been caught red-handed.
[3:06:44.860 --> 3:06:48.860]  And the article Corporate Media ignores, red-linked on dredgerport.com,
[3:06:48.860 --> 3:06:52.860]  taking down the video of their own head of censorship admitting it all.
[3:06:52.860 --> 3:06:57.860]  And we have the censored video posted there and they hope you don't go to dredgerport.com
[3:06:57.860 --> 3:07:05.860]  and find that Infowars.com or NewsWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or Summit.News.
[3:07:05.860 --> 3:07:09.860]  That's Paul's site and spread it.
[3:07:09.860 --> 3:07:11.860]  They think you're morons.
[3:07:11.860 --> 3:07:16.860]  They think they'll sit there and brag how they're going to steal 2020 and you'll do nothing but the truth is,
[3:07:16.860 --> 3:07:22.860]  congressional hearings are already called, criminal investigations, perjury, it's all happening.
[3:07:22.860 --> 3:07:27.860]  Now separately, as I turn this over to Paul Joseph Watson from the UK, the great job he's going to do,
[3:07:27.860 --> 3:07:33.860]  just remember it's listener support that makes this broadcast possible.
[3:07:33.860 --> 3:07:39.860]  And it's human communication that strengthens people, not communication by bots, not broken text messages,
[3:07:39.860 --> 3:07:42.860]  not no one wanting to communicate and all this mental illness.
[3:07:42.860 --> 3:07:44.860]  We're basic human communications breaking down.
[3:07:44.860 --> 3:07:50.860]  Real human communication and having a memory will be the most valuable thing going into the future
[3:07:50.860 --> 3:07:54.860]  because the average person has less of a memory than a goldfish.
[3:07:54.860 --> 3:07:56.860]  I love my crew. They're amazing people.
[3:07:56.860 --> 3:08:03.860]  I've had three meetings and a fort this morning because so much is happening around here. I forget stuff too.
[3:08:03.860 --> 3:08:05.860]  That's why I'm saying this is the great asset.
[3:08:05.860 --> 3:08:11.860]  And I said a few weeks ago, I want a clown world shirt for the debates.
[3:08:11.860 --> 3:08:14.860]  A limited edition clown world shirt.
[3:08:14.860 --> 3:08:19.860]  And I said because it's being printed right now, it's not going to be pre-order because we always say pre-order,
[3:08:19.860 --> 3:08:21.860]  but never when you're going to be shipped.
[3:08:21.860 --> 3:08:26.860]  I can have 100 meetings. Once the vortex of resistance begins subconsciously,
[3:08:26.860 --> 3:08:29.860]  it cannot be countermanded or defeated, I've learned.
[3:08:29.860 --> 3:08:32.860]  So I say, hey, we're not going to say when it's getting delivered.
[3:08:32.860 --> 3:08:36.860]  Even though it says pre-ship and pre-order, even though everybody else would tell you,
[3:08:36.860 --> 3:08:40.860]  nobody orders it because it doesn't say, we know that'll never happen.
[3:08:40.860 --> 3:08:47.860]  So in four meetings, including one this morning, I said we're going to say takes two weeks for delivery
[3:08:47.860 --> 3:08:49.860]  because it's being printed right now.
[3:08:49.860 --> 3:08:51.860]  We'll have it in a week. It'll be shipped to you.
[3:08:51.860 --> 3:08:53.860]  It'd say that. That's fine.
[3:08:53.860 --> 3:08:57.860]  I'm going to interdimensionally defeat it right now on air.
[3:08:57.860 --> 3:09:00.860]  Watch this. Watch it.
[3:09:00.860 --> 3:09:03.860]  Fifth meeting live on air. Let's have it.
[3:09:03.860 --> 3:09:07.860]  Clownworldinfowars.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:09:07.860 --> 3:09:09.860]  This is just our test one. It's going to be even bigger on the front,
[3:09:09.860 --> 3:09:11.860]  bigger clown world for everybody.
[3:09:11.860 --> 3:09:15.860]  And on the back, look at this, like a concert T-shirt, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:09:15.860 --> 3:09:20.860]  Clownworld 2020, Cory Booker and all the rest of the usual suspects.
[3:09:20.860 --> 3:09:21.860]  And we're going to have live coverage.
[3:09:21.860 --> 3:09:25.860]  And there's only 5,000 of these being printed.
[3:09:25.860 --> 3:09:29.860]  5,000, and that's it. And it funds the operation.
[3:09:29.860 --> 3:09:31.860]  So it's been changed since the break.
[3:09:31.860 --> 3:09:33.860]  It's a clown world.
[3:09:33.860 --> 3:09:37.860]  And we're just living it and celebrate the circus and its democratic debates.
[3:09:37.860 --> 3:09:40.860]  This exclusive limited time clown world shirt.
[3:09:40.860 --> 3:09:47.860]  1995, really soft, nice, high quality fabric, whole nine yards for everybody.
[3:09:47.860 --> 3:09:51.860]  No reviews yet because nobody's gotten the shirt yet, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:09:51.860 --> 3:09:58.860]  And again, it's not pre-order because it ships within two weeks.
[3:09:58.860 --> 3:10:01.860]  Done, done, done.
[3:10:01.860 --> 3:10:06.860]  And yes, we're running store-wide free shipping,
[3:10:06.860 --> 3:10:14.860]  50% off the supplements in double-patria points, and that's how we fund this operation.
[3:10:14.860 --> 3:10:17.860]  But listen, don't worry about getting your next two of your fish oil
[3:10:17.860 --> 3:10:22.860]  or the 50% off bodies, ultimate turmeric formula or any of it with this great crew.
[3:10:22.860 --> 3:10:27.860]  Just go to DrudgeReport.com and get that Jamie White article
[3:10:27.860 --> 3:10:31.860]  how the entire corporate media, including Fox News,
[3:10:31.860 --> 3:10:39.860]  is ignoring the huge Project Veritas smoking gun, holy grail information.
[3:10:39.860 --> 3:10:42.860]  That's all I'm asking.
[3:10:42.860 --> 3:10:45.860]  Fox News still not covering Project Veritas Google
[3:10:45.860 --> 3:10:47.860]  because they're part of the corporate elite.
[3:10:47.860 --> 3:10:49.860]  They want the censorship of their competition.
[3:10:49.860 --> 3:10:52.860]  They want to treat us country bums like we're idiots.
[3:10:52.860 --> 3:10:55.860]  It fell off a turnip truck last week, but we're not.
[3:10:55.860 --> 3:11:00.860]  Thanks to you, the amazing audience and this amazing crew and everybody else.
[3:11:00.860 --> 3:11:03.860]  We will prevail.
[3:11:03.860 --> 3:11:04.860]  Aren't you glad I'm throwing fits on there?
[3:11:04.860 --> 3:11:06.860]  Because if I would, we wouldn't be here.
[3:11:06.860 --> 3:11:08.860]  I love the crew. I love you, everybody, but I'm pissed.
[3:11:08.860 --> 3:11:12.860]  And I want to show Silicon Valley and Eric Schmidt and Sundar Pichai
[3:11:12.860 --> 3:11:16.860]  and all these chicken neck criminals that you're not better than us
[3:11:16.860 --> 3:11:19.860]  and that you bet on the wrong country and you're going to be defeated.
[3:11:19.860 --> 3:11:22.860]  Now from his glorious Highnesses,
[3:11:22.860 --> 3:11:26.860]  Britannic Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, England.
[3:11:26.860 --> 3:11:33.860]  We are joined by Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:11:33.860 --> 3:11:35.860]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[3:11:35.860 --> 3:11:39.860]  Yeah, big updates on the James O'Keefe Project Veritas story.
[3:11:39.860 --> 3:11:41.860]  They've got another leak today, of course.
[3:11:41.860 --> 3:11:44.860]  He was on your show yesterday talking about new whistleblowers
[3:11:44.860 --> 3:11:49.860]  that are about to come out in their droves specifically from Google.
[3:11:49.860 --> 3:11:52.860]  So now they've got a new leak today from Google.
[3:11:52.860 --> 3:11:57.860]  It's up on projectveritas.com, breaking new Google document leaked,
[3:11:57.860 --> 3:12:02.860]  describing Shapiro Prager as Nazis using the dog whistles.
[3:12:02.860 --> 3:12:08.860]  This is a leaked document from a member of Google's transparency and ethics group.
[3:12:08.860 --> 3:12:14.860]  And in this message, which is being ping-ponged around the inner sanctum of Google
[3:12:14.860 --> 3:12:18.860]  in terms of algorithmic manipulation of content,
[3:12:18.860 --> 3:12:23.860]  they say, quote, one of these Google insiders says, quote,
[3:12:23.860 --> 3:12:25.860]  remember this is transparency and ethics.
[3:12:25.860 --> 3:12:30.860]  If we understand that Prager you, Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro et al.
[3:12:30.860 --> 3:12:34.860]  are Nazis using the dog whistles.
[3:12:34.860 --> 3:12:39.860]  Okay, Prager you, Ben Shapiro, that is a Jewish operation.
[3:12:39.860 --> 3:12:41.860]  Ben Shapiro is Jewish.
[3:12:41.860 --> 3:12:44.860]  And now they're literally putting them into the Nazi category.
[3:12:44.860 --> 3:12:48.860]  For what purpose? Well, they go on to say.
[3:12:48.860 --> 3:12:52.860]  But you notice that Ben Shapiro and others, Paul, you know, said, oh, it's free market, do it.
[3:12:52.860 --> 3:12:53.860]  So now it's going to happen to him.
[3:12:53.860 --> 3:12:57.860]  They always come for everybody because we don't stand together.
[3:12:57.860 --> 3:13:00.860]  Precisely, you know, Dennis Prager is Jewish. Ben Shapiro is Jewish.
[3:13:00.860 --> 3:13:04.860]  They're literally in their conversation calling them Nazis and then saying, quote,
[3:13:04.860 --> 3:13:09.860]  I don't think correctly identifying far right content is beyond our capabilities.
[3:13:09.860 --> 3:13:13.860]  This is now Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson are far right.
[3:13:13.860 --> 3:13:19.860]  But if it is, why not go with Meredith's suggestion of disabling the suggestion feature?
[3:13:19.860 --> 3:13:24.860]  Okay, the vast majority or at least the clear majority of views that go to YouTube videos
[3:13:24.860 --> 3:13:28.860]  are via YouTube search suggestion feature.
[3:13:28.860 --> 3:13:33.860]  I think it's second only after the subscription feature when subscribers get notified.
[3:13:33.860 --> 3:13:37.860]  Then the large majority of views after that come from that suggestion feature.
[3:13:37.860 --> 3:13:44.860]  So this, again, is clear election meddling, manipulating their own algorithm to downrank
[3:13:44.860 --> 3:13:50.860]  people like Ben Shapiro, Dennis Prager, Jordan Peterson, because they're called Nazis.
[3:13:50.860 --> 3:13:55.860]  Obviously, that is on the face of it, a completely ludicrous and absurd claim.
[3:13:55.860 --> 3:13:58.860]  So this only backs up what came out yesterday.
[3:13:58.860 --> 3:14:02.860]  Again, with the Google insider saying they're not going to let Trump 2020 happen.
[3:14:02.860 --> 3:14:07.860]  And then it's going to use algorithmic manipulation to ensure that does not take place.
[3:14:07.860 --> 3:14:12.860]  Now they're literally naming specific people saying these are the people we need to target
[3:14:12.860 --> 3:14:14.860]  because they're Nazis.
[3:14:14.860 --> 3:14:18.860]  And they've already been doing this for best part of a year, probably more.
[3:14:18.860 --> 3:14:25.860]  As we've highlighted, you can search the exact title of a YouTube video by someone like Mark Dice
[3:14:25.860 --> 3:14:28.860]  about Michelle Obama, for example.
[3:14:28.860 --> 3:14:33.860]  And the actual result, the video you're looking for will not come up until something ridiculous
[3:14:33.860 --> 3:14:40.860]  like page 30, buried beneath a wall of mainstream media results that have nothing to do with what you
[3:14:40.860 --> 3:14:41.860]  searched for.
[3:14:41.860 --> 3:14:45.860]  They've literally broken not only YouTube, which is the second biggest search engine in
[3:14:45.860 --> 3:14:48.860]  the world, but also Google.com itself.
[3:14:48.860 --> 3:14:50.860]  They've broken their own search engine.
[3:14:50.860 --> 3:14:56.860]  That is the extent that this election meddling, that this algorithmic censorship is taking place
[3:14:56.860 --> 3:14:57.860]  right now.
[3:14:57.860 --> 3:14:59.860]  You can search right now.
[3:14:59.860 --> 3:15:01.860]  Paul Joseph Watson, YouTube.
[3:15:01.860 --> 3:15:07.860]  And the top result is some YouTube channel that's about a tenth the size of mine, somebody
[3:15:07.860 --> 3:15:09.860]  doing an impression of me.
[3:15:09.860 --> 3:15:10.860]  Okay.
[3:15:10.860 --> 3:15:14.860]  They've broken their own search engine to suppress conservative commentators.
[3:15:14.860 --> 3:15:16.860]  They've done it deliberately.
[3:15:16.860 --> 3:15:20.860]  Sundar Pitcher, I got up in front of hearing and lied about it.
[3:15:20.860 --> 3:15:25.860]  It was perjury saying they had no partisan algorithmic manipulation.
[3:15:25.860 --> 3:15:27.860]  We already knew they've been doing it for months.
[3:15:27.860 --> 3:15:32.860]  Now they've got a document from inside Google where it's a Google executive or at least
[3:15:32.860 --> 3:15:38.860]  an engineer admitting that they want to remove views from conservative commentators based
[3:15:38.860 --> 3:15:45.860]  on this hysterical Trump derangement syndrome position that Ben Shapiro, a Jewish guy, is
[3:15:45.860 --> 3:15:46.860]  a Nazi.
[3:15:46.860 --> 3:15:48.860]  This is how bad it's become.
[3:15:48.860 --> 3:15:50.860]  We'll be back in forward.com.
[3:15:50.860 --> 3:15:51.860]  Hi.
[3:15:51.860 --> 3:15:53.860]  I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:53.860 --> 3:15:57.860]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:57.860 --> 3:15:59.860]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:15:59.860 --> 3:16:02.860]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:02.860 --> 3:16:05.860]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:16:05.860 --> 3:16:07.860]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:07.860 --> 3:16:08.860]  I can help you too.
[3:16:08.860 --> 3:16:11.860]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:16:11.860 --> 3:16:13.860]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:16:13.860 --> 3:16:18.860]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[3:16:18.860 --> 3:16:21.860]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:16:21.860 --> 3:16:27.860]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[3:16:27.860 --> 3:16:28.860]  the world.
[3:16:28.860 --> 3:16:31.860]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[3:16:31.860 --> 3:16:37.860]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[3:16:37.860 --> 3:16:41.860]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[3:16:41.860 --> 3:16:42.860]  Was there ever a vote?
[3:16:42.860 --> 3:16:43.860]  Who do we fight for?
[3:16:43.860 --> 3:16:46.860]  The deep state began with World War I.
[3:16:46.860 --> 3:16:52.860]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[3:16:52.860 --> 3:16:58.860]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you
[3:16:58.860 --> 3:17:03.860]  now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.
[3:17:03.860 --> 3:17:09.860]  Because now, Sunny Bay heating wraps and pillows are available at both Amazon and Walmart.
[3:17:09.860 --> 3:17:10.860]  Yes.
[3:17:10.860 --> 3:17:16.860]  Sunny Bay's 4.5 to 5-star customer reviews on Amazon.com or Walmart.com.
[3:17:16.860 --> 3:17:21.860]  Our microwavable heat wraps, heatable neck pillows, and extra large body wraps are designed
[3:17:21.860 --> 3:17:24.860]  better for perfect support where and when you need it.
[3:17:24.860 --> 3:17:29.860]  Even while driving, Sunny Bay wraps will not burn and stay balanced to provide soothing,
[3:17:29.860 --> 3:17:33.860]  hot, or cold therapy to help treat temporary or chronic pain.
[3:17:33.860 --> 3:17:38.860]  And the best part, Sunny Bay quality products started under $20.
[3:17:38.860 --> 3:17:43.860]  Between thousands of happy customers and see why Sunny Bay products have a lifetime 100%
[3:17:43.860 --> 3:17:46.860]  positive rating on both Amazon and Etsy.
[3:17:46.860 --> 3:17:47.860]  It's easy.
[3:17:47.860 --> 3:18:15.860]  That's it.
[3:18:15.860 --> 3:18:18.860]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[3:18:18.860 --> 3:18:21.860]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[3:18:21.860 --> 3:18:22.860]  It's the time to be praying, my friend.
[3:18:22.860 --> 3:18:23.860]  I agree entirely.
[3:18:23.860 --> 3:18:26.860]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[3:18:26.860 --> 3:18:28.860]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[3:18:28.860 --> 3:18:31.860]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[3:18:31.860 --> 3:18:33.860]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[3:18:33.860 --> 3:18:36.860]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[3:18:36.860 --> 3:18:38.860]  You've won a lot of battles.
[3:18:38.860 --> 3:18:42.860]  And there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[3:18:42.860 --> 3:18:46.860]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War, and even if something does happen to you or your show,
[3:18:46.860 --> 3:18:50.860]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[3:18:50.860 --> 3:19:19.860]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[3:19:20.860 --> 3:19:46.860]  Thank you, sir.
[3:19:46.860 --> 3:20:12.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:12.860 --> 3:20:20.860]  It's the Alex Jones show, and now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:20.860 --> 3:20:26.860]  People seem to forget that we already have red flag smoking gun evidence of election meddling
[3:20:26.860 --> 3:20:29.860]  when it comes to Google, which owns YouTube.
[3:20:29.860 --> 3:20:35.860]  Remember the referendum in Ireland on abortion, whether to legalize it in Ireland earlier this year?
[3:20:35.860 --> 3:20:41.860]  Well, days before that vote in Ireland, you had an article by a slate writer
[3:20:41.860 --> 3:20:49.860]  who was complaining that there were too many pro-life videos at the top of YouTube's search results,
[3:20:49.860 --> 3:20:52.860]  YouTube being the second biggest search engine in the world.
[3:20:52.860 --> 3:20:57.860]  Days before a referendum on legalizing abortion in Ireland,
[3:20:57.860 --> 3:21:02.860]  she complained to Google-owned YouTube on the Friday.
[3:21:02.860 --> 3:21:07.860]  By the Monday, they had changed the search results for the first page of search results
[3:21:07.860 --> 3:21:11.860]  when people search for abortion or pro-life terms.
[3:21:11.860 --> 3:21:17.860]  Again, doing the bidding immediately caving to these activists who pretend to be journalists
[3:21:17.860 --> 3:21:22.860]  days before an election to manipulate their own search engine,
[3:21:22.860 --> 3:21:26.860]  which is the studies of Dr. Robert Epstein of Proven,
[3:21:26.860 --> 3:21:30.860]  can shift millions of votes on election day.
[3:21:30.860 --> 3:21:36.860]  He said, quote, I estimate conservatively they could shift upwards of 12 million votes.
[3:21:36.860 --> 3:21:40.860]  That was based on a study of the biggest democratic election in the world in India.
[3:21:40.860 --> 3:21:45.860]  He also said Google helped shift two to three million votes in Hillary Clinton's favor,
[3:21:45.860 --> 3:21:52.860]  simply with bias search algorithms, simply by ranking certain search results above others.
[3:21:52.860 --> 3:21:55.860]  You saw it yesterday with the insider whistleblower from Google,
[3:21:55.860 --> 3:21:59.860]  where they would type in Hillary Clinton emails.
[3:21:59.860 --> 3:22:02.860]  The autocomplete suggestion was removed.
[3:22:02.860 --> 3:22:07.860]  It wasn't removed for Donald Trump emails, despite there being vast interest
[3:22:07.860 --> 3:22:13.860]  right before the election in Hillary Clinton's deleted emails.
[3:22:13.860 --> 3:22:19.860]  So you had an exact concrete example of election meddling with the Irish abortion referendum question,
[3:22:19.860 --> 3:22:21.860]  and everybody seems to gloss over that.
[3:22:21.860 --> 3:22:26.860]  Pitch-eye gets up in front of a hearing under Elf and says they don't, quote,
[3:22:26.860 --> 3:22:32.860]  necessarily intervene for partisan purposes. Yes, they do. They did it then,
[3:22:32.860 --> 3:22:39.860]  days before a national referendum on a massive subject in a major western country.
[3:22:39.860 --> 3:22:42.860]  How is that not an example of election meddling?
[3:22:42.860 --> 3:22:47.860]  And these New York Times journalists and others react to the latest project,
[3:22:47.860 --> 3:22:51.860]  Veritas release, and say, I don't see any evidence of partisan bias in this.
[3:22:51.860 --> 3:22:57.860]  They've literally got a leaked document from a discussion of Google transparency and ethics people
[3:22:57.860 --> 3:23:03.860]  from within Google saying we need to censor Ben Shapiro because he's a Nazi.
[3:23:03.860 --> 3:23:10.860]  How is that not political bias? How obvious does it need to get?
[3:23:10.860 --> 3:23:15.860]  I mean, you've got the bill by Senator Hawley right now to strip them of immunity
[3:23:15.860 --> 3:23:18.860]  under Section 230 of the Decency Communications Act.
[3:23:18.860 --> 3:23:26.860]  You've got Ted Cruz talking about it. Now slowly we see today some actual mainstream news coverage
[3:23:26.860 --> 3:23:31.860]  of this huge project, Veritas bombshell, but only in British newspapers.
[3:23:31.860 --> 3:23:34.860]  You've got the sun. You've got the Daily Mail talking about it.
[3:23:34.860 --> 3:23:41.860]  As Alex Jones said, Fox News have done nothing whatsoever because Fox News are the token conservatives
[3:23:41.860 --> 3:23:46.860]  for big tech. As long as they say, oh, we're not doing anything mean to Fox News,
[3:23:46.860 --> 3:23:52.860]  so we're not bias, that's how they can justify that warped suggestion,
[3:23:52.860 --> 3:23:59.860]  that warped excuse in their own minds even though you've got flagrant proof of it happening right before your eyes.
[3:23:59.860 --> 3:24:05.860]  And I've talked about it before. They've literally broken their own search engines to the point where
[3:24:05.860 --> 3:24:11.860]  I can search for articles with the almost exact headline with my name that I wrote
[3:24:11.860 --> 3:24:15.860]  because I reference back articles when I'm writing about the same subjects
[3:24:15.860 --> 3:24:19.860]  or I can search for a Breitbart article about a subject.
[3:24:19.860 --> 3:24:26.860]  For example, I was doing it the other day. I was trying to search for the statistics on knife crime in the UK
[3:24:26.860 --> 3:24:31.860]  and who was committing the knife crime because I remember that Breitbart had done an entire article
[3:24:31.860 --> 3:24:35.860]  quoting the government body about the statistics on knife crime in the UK.
[3:24:35.860 --> 3:24:40.860]  You type into Google and it's just a bunch of hit pieces against Breitbart.
[3:24:40.860 --> 3:24:46.860]  You can't even find what you need anymore because they've broken their own search engine to that extent.
[3:24:46.860 --> 3:24:51.860]  You go on duck-duck-go, you go on even Bing, you get completely different results.
[3:24:51.860 --> 3:24:57.860]  They are changing the course of reality. They are censoring people via their algorithms
[3:24:57.860 --> 3:25:01.860]  and they are meddling in elections. What was it, Facebook?
[3:25:01.860 --> 3:25:08.860]  The Russians spent a total of what was it, like $4,000 on ads on Facebook for the entire election campaign.
[3:25:08.860 --> 3:25:13.860]  We had a hysterical news cycle that was repeated over and over again
[3:25:13.860 --> 3:25:19.860]  that Russians meddled in the election with Facebook ads, that Russians meddled in Brexit with Facebook ads.
[3:25:19.860 --> 3:25:24.860]  They spent virtually nothing on ads and some of those ads were left wing.
[3:25:24.860 --> 3:25:27.860]  They were pro-Black Lives Matter stuff.
[3:25:27.860 --> 3:25:34.860]  The media hyperventilates over Russians buying Facebook ads to the tune of $4,000, which is absolutely nothing.
[3:25:34.860 --> 3:25:38.860]  It's a pathetic amount of money. That goes on for years.
[3:25:38.860 --> 3:25:45.860]  Now we have Google insiders openly admitting they break their own search engine to meddle in elections.
[3:25:45.860 --> 3:25:49.860]  Trump 2020, the Irish abortion referendum.
[3:25:49.860 --> 3:25:54.860]  We had Spain, the Vox party in Spain days before the election.
[3:25:54.860 --> 3:26:00.860]  Their pages, millions of people who were supporting the Vox populist party in Spain.
[3:26:00.860 --> 3:26:07.860]  Millions of people on numerous large pages completely deleted by Facebook days before a national election.
[3:26:07.860 --> 3:26:10.860]  That is election meddling.
[3:26:10.860 --> 3:26:14.860]  Vox's YouTube channel was completely deleted last week.
[3:26:14.860 --> 3:26:18.860]  Again, that is meddling in the policies of a country.
[3:26:18.860 --> 3:26:24.860]  How many other examples do we need to see before we have some actual teeth in any actual bills
[3:26:24.860 --> 3:26:28.860]  or before we get conservative ink behind this?
[3:26:28.860 --> 3:26:32.860]  How many people need to be banned? How many people need to be shadow banned?
[3:26:32.860 --> 3:26:35.860]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:26:35.860 --> 3:26:39.860]  Again, this shifts millions of votes on election day.
[3:26:39.860 --> 3:26:43.860]  You had Candice Owens' Blagsit website completely buried.
[3:26:43.860 --> 3:26:47.860]  When you searched for Candice Owens' Blagsit website, it was buried on page 2.
[3:26:47.860 --> 3:26:52.860]  Some completely unrelated website was thrown up in first place.
[3:26:52.860 --> 3:26:54.860]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:26:54.860 --> 3:27:01.860]  Then, of course, you have the whole demonetization issue, which came to the fore with Crowder and Vox a couple of weeks ago,
[3:27:01.860 --> 3:27:09.860]  where it's now to the point that I can upload a video which is not advertiser-friendly, none of them are,
[3:27:09.860 --> 3:27:20.860]  but it becomes advertiser-friendly when a third party claims copyright on a tiny bit of music that runs for like three seconds in that video.
[3:27:20.860 --> 3:27:25.860]  I don't really care. It's better than the old system where they would just take down the video immediately.
[3:27:25.860 --> 3:27:34.860]  But why does my video only become advertiser-friendly when a large corporation claims income from it?
[3:27:34.860 --> 3:27:37.860]  Their system is completely broke.
[3:27:37.860 --> 3:27:50.860]  And then you've got a tier of premier privileged creators like CNN, like all the Comedy Central left-wing late-night comedy shows, who can talk about any subject whatsoever.
[3:27:50.860 --> 3:27:52.860]  They can talk about ISIS terrorism.
[3:27:52.860 --> 3:27:54.860]  They can talk about immigration.
[3:27:54.860 --> 3:27:58.860]  They can make homophobic jokes like Stephen Colbert did.
[3:27:58.860 --> 3:28:00.860]  Does it affect their advertising?
[3:28:00.860 --> 3:28:21.860]  No, ads on every single video because they're in the special class. They are immune from YouTube's own terms of service, which are then deliberately altered, skewed to punish conservative commentators and anyone else that basically defers from the progressive orthodoxy.
[3:28:21.860 --> 3:28:23.860]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:28:23.860 --> 3:28:33.860]  Back I'm going to talk about another big tech platform, WordPress, who recently deleted a blog called the Heart East blog, which again was right-of-center commentary.
[3:28:33.860 --> 3:28:47.860]  And now they're giving a platform to a literal pedophile and a convicted child porn peddler to say how much he's attracted to. Desmond is amazing, the 12-year-old drag queen kid.
[3:28:47.860 --> 3:28:50.860]  We'll be back with that and more on the Alex Jones Show Live infowars.com.
[3:28:50.860 --> 3:28:52.860]  Don't go away.
[3:28:52.860 --> 3:28:54.860]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[3:28:54.860 --> 3:29:01.860]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[3:29:01.860 --> 3:29:09.860]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:29:09.860 --> 3:29:15.860]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[3:29:15.860 --> 3:29:19.860]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[3:29:19.860 --> 3:29:26.860]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[3:29:26.860 --> 3:29:34.860]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[3:30:05.860 --> 3:30:12.860]  I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week,
[3:30:12.860 --> 3:30:17.860]  the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[3:30:17.860 --> 3:30:22.860]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[3:30:22.860 --> 3:30:28.860]  I want you to know that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support
[3:30:28.860 --> 3:30:35.860]  because I'm committed to fight to the end but I want to win and without you, I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun.
[3:30:35.860 --> 3:30:40.860]  But that's not what's important. The enemy could win. We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[3:30:40.860 --> 3:30:43.860]  We're being used by God. You're being used by God. This is Providence.
[3:30:43.860 --> 3:30:47.860]  So I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[3:30:47.860 --> 3:30:53.860]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[3:30:53.860 --> 3:30:59.860]  Infowars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so.
[3:30:59.860 --> 3:31:04.860]  It's Orwellian. It's biblical. It's authoritarian. It's insane.
[3:31:04.860 --> 3:31:12.860]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation
[3:31:12.860 --> 3:31:17.860]  and say, hey, we're sinking. I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat.
[3:31:17.860 --> 3:31:22.860]  But this is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting,
[3:31:22.860 --> 3:31:27.860]  Infowars will be shut down, not just crippled. And so we've reached that point.
[3:31:27.860 --> 3:31:31.860]  It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we have withstood so many of their attacks.
[3:31:31.860 --> 3:31:35.860]  We've gone through so much because of your support. You have, you have been there.
[3:31:35.860 --> 3:31:40.860]  But let me tell you, they are pissed. They haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault.
[3:31:40.860 --> 3:31:46.860]  So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now at Infowars.com.
[3:31:46.860 --> 3:31:53.860]  It's your fight. Decide whether or not you want Infowars to continue because we could be shut down.
[3:31:53.860 --> 3:31:57.860]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[3:31:57.860 --> 3:32:04.860]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech
[3:32:04.860 --> 3:32:10.860]  by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another. It is the only independent press
[3:32:10.860 --> 3:32:13.860]  of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[3:32:13.860 --> 3:32:20.860]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic structure
[3:32:20.860 --> 3:32:26.860]  that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached
[3:32:26.860 --> 3:32:30.860]  by their choices and supporting Infowars. And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is,
[3:32:30.860 --> 3:32:34.860]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want
[3:32:34.860 --> 3:32:38.860]  that actually compete with the corporate-driven model and the ability to do that
[3:32:38.860 --> 3:32:44.860]  and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see
[3:32:44.860 --> 3:32:49.860]  and what views they want to hold. And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment
[3:32:49.860 --> 3:33:01.860]  that is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[3:33:20.860 --> 3:33:26.860]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:26.860 --> 3:33:31.860]  So remember when Vice.com, which absolutely hates my guts and it's hilarious,
[3:33:31.860 --> 3:33:37.860]  they literally send spies to comedy nights in London to spy on my reaction to jokes.
[3:33:37.860 --> 3:33:43.860]  That's how obsessed they are. Remember when Vice gave a platform to Todd Nickerson
[3:33:43.860 --> 3:33:50.860]  and admitted pedophile and they gave him a platform to talk about how much he'd lost after six-year-old girls,
[3:33:50.860 --> 3:33:55.860]  literally while playing dreamy footage of a little girl twirling in the background
[3:33:55.860 --> 3:33:59.860]  as he talked about masturbating over her. They literally did that.
[3:33:59.860 --> 3:34:06.860]  I mean, salon.com did it before them, but at least salon.com was moral enough to delete their articles
[3:34:06.860 --> 3:34:12.860]  which were penned by this monster whining about how right-wing people don't like him.
[3:34:12.860 --> 3:34:16.860]  His article is still up at Vice.com, of course. He's the victim.
[3:34:16.860 --> 3:34:21.860]  He's targeted by vigilantes, the literal wannabe child molester.
[3:34:21.860 --> 3:34:24.860]  So they will give a platform to pedophiles.
[3:34:24.860 --> 3:34:30.860]  Another big tech platform which has given a platform to an admitted pedophile is WordPress.
[3:34:30.860 --> 3:34:36.860]  You remember that WordPress a couple of months ago now banned a blog called Heart East.
[3:34:36.860 --> 3:34:41.860]  It was called Chateau Heart East. It was a right-of-center commentary blog.
[3:34:41.860 --> 3:34:45.860]  It wasn't a white supremacist blog. It wasn't a neo-Nazi blog.
[3:34:45.860 --> 3:34:48.860]  It was right-of-center. They banned the blog entirely.
[3:34:48.860 --> 3:34:53.860]  The guy's entire, what, three-four-year archive of posts was immediately deleted.
[3:34:53.860 --> 3:34:56.860]  Some people would say, why didn't you get a dot-com?
[3:34:56.860 --> 3:35:01.860]  I mean, that is a good point. Why would anyone be stupid enough to trust WordPress
[3:35:01.860 --> 3:35:04.860]  with their entire back catalogue of work?
[3:35:04.860 --> 3:35:09.860]  But the fact is they banned him, de-platformed him, got rid of his entire blog.
[3:35:09.860 --> 3:35:14.860]  Somebody who's still got a blog on WordPress is an individual called Tom O'Carroll.
[3:35:14.860 --> 3:35:21.860]  Tom O'Carroll is a former chairman of the now disbanded Pedophile Information Exchange.
[3:35:21.860 --> 3:35:26.860]  Remember that? That was a big pedophile normalization group
[3:35:26.860 --> 3:35:30.860]  which included members of the left-wing Labour Party in Britain,
[3:35:30.860 --> 3:35:36.860]  a group that campaigned for the age of consent to be lowered to four years old.
[3:35:36.860 --> 3:35:41.860]  He was the chairman of that group. This is who WordPress is giving a platform right now.
[3:35:41.860 --> 3:35:47.860]  He was also a member of the International Pedophile and Child Emancipation Group.
[3:35:47.860 --> 3:35:54.860]  Now, O'Carroll was jailed in December 2006, convicted and jailed for two and a half years
[3:35:54.860 --> 3:36:00.860]  for conspiring to distribute a cache of child pornography obtained from his co-defendant,
[3:36:00.860 --> 3:36:05.860]  which contained 50,000 indecent images of children.
[3:36:05.860 --> 3:36:11.860]  O'Carroll has repeatedly campaigned for the normalization of sexual relations with children
[3:36:11.860 --> 3:36:14.860]  and sees nothing wrong with pedophilia.
[3:36:14.860 --> 3:36:20.860]  And this is all in the article up on Summit.News called Pedophile and Convicted Child Porn Peddler
[3:36:20.860 --> 3:36:25.860]  says Desmond is amazing is, quote, hot.
[3:36:25.860 --> 3:36:29.860]  He's written an article which is linked in this Summit.News article.
[3:36:29.860 --> 3:36:33.860]  If you want to read it, it's disgusting in which he writes, quote,
[3:36:33.860 --> 3:36:39.860]  Child Drag Artist Desmond is amazing is indeed amazing and hot.
[3:36:39.860 --> 3:36:46.860]  No wonder 11-year-old Desmond Napoli and other kids daringly diving into drag culture right now
[3:36:46.860 --> 3:36:51.860]  have provoked right-wing reactionaries into paroxysms of moral outrage.
[3:36:51.860 --> 3:36:57.860]  Yes, because where the bat got, the people who point out that having 11-year-old children
[3:36:57.860 --> 3:37:02.860]  dance around in skimpy outfits in front of people in gay bars in New York
[3:37:02.860 --> 3:37:06.860]  while they throw money at him. Where the bat guys?
[3:37:06.860 --> 3:37:08.860]  We're not progressive enough.
[3:37:08.860 --> 3:37:14.860]  So in this article, he goes on to argue that, quote, a scantily clad Desmond, those are his words,
[3:37:14.860 --> 3:37:19.860]  accepting, quote, tips from an audience apparently wild with excitement.
[3:37:19.860 --> 3:37:21.860]  He's talking about the New York gay bar.
[3:37:21.860 --> 3:37:25.860]  It's, quote, far more than just a celebration of gender diversity
[3:37:25.860 --> 3:37:28.860]  or an innocent display of precocious performance talent.
[3:37:28.860 --> 3:37:33.860]  Remember, as I read these words, this is a guy who is an admitted pedophile
[3:37:33.860 --> 3:37:39.860]  and who has been convicted and jailed for distributing and viewing child pornography.
[3:37:39.860 --> 3:37:44.860]  He's lost after an 11-year-old kid. He was 11 at this point. I think he's 12 now.
[3:37:44.860 --> 3:37:49.860]  He's justifying, saying that it was right for people to be wild with excitement
[3:37:49.860 --> 3:37:53.860]  as this poor victim of a child, that's how I look at him,
[3:37:53.860 --> 3:37:58.860]  was made to dance around a New York gay bar while people threw money at him.
[3:37:58.860 --> 3:38:01.860]  That's completely normal. There you see his mother,
[3:38:01.860 --> 3:38:04.860]  and we had the article about 10 days ago now,
[3:38:04.860 --> 3:38:07.860]  appearing on Australian television,
[3:38:07.860 --> 3:38:12.860]  saying that it was completely normal for him to be dancing in front of a gay club in New York
[3:38:12.860 --> 3:38:14.860]  while people threw money at him.
[3:38:14.860 --> 3:38:20.860]  In fact, her own words were, quote, I don't understand what the controversy is.
[3:38:20.860 --> 3:38:24.860]  So this pedophile, convicted child pornographer,
[3:38:24.860 --> 3:38:28.860]  writes in his blog, which is hosted by WordPress,
[3:38:28.860 --> 3:38:31.860]  which de-platforms right-wing people for hate speech,
[3:38:31.860 --> 3:38:34.860]  but allows pedophiles to lust after children,
[3:38:34.860 --> 3:38:40.860]  quote, it says, loud and proud, I am a sexy kid with sexy feelings.
[3:38:40.860 --> 3:38:43.860]  It's totally cool for grown-ups to get turned on by me. I love it.
[3:38:43.860 --> 3:38:47.860]  That's why I do this stuff. It's great. It's fun. It's me.
[3:38:47.860 --> 3:38:51.860]  Those are his words, talking about an 11-year-old child
[3:38:51.860 --> 3:38:55.860]  saying that it's great for him to be turning on adults,
[3:38:55.860 --> 3:38:59.860]  by which he means pedophiles like himself.
[3:38:59.860 --> 3:39:03.860]  He goes on to call conservatives desperate to pretend that, quote,
[3:39:03.860 --> 3:39:06.860]  kids have no erotic dimension.
[3:39:06.860 --> 3:39:10.860]  Now, I haven't read WordPress's terms of service,
[3:39:10.860 --> 3:39:16.860]  but I would tend to imagine that they don't allow pedophiles on there to lust after children.
[3:39:16.860 --> 3:39:19.860]  This blog has been up for over a month.
[3:39:19.860 --> 3:39:22.860]  People have talked about it. People have complained about it.
[3:39:22.860 --> 3:39:25.860]  It's still there. Now, I don't even care if they de-platform him.
[3:39:25.860 --> 3:39:28.860]  I don't want them to ban him because I'd rather monsters like this
[3:39:28.860 --> 3:39:31.860]  be out in the open where we can see what they're doing
[3:39:31.860 --> 3:39:33.860]  and what they're saying.
[3:39:33.860 --> 3:39:35.860]  But again, it shows you the absolute double standard
[3:39:35.860 --> 3:39:39.860]  and it shows you the sickness that riddles society,
[3:39:39.860 --> 3:39:42.860]  where all these big mainstream media networks
[3:39:42.860 --> 3:39:46.860]  put this poor victim of a child on a stage
[3:39:46.860 --> 3:39:49.860]  to normalize drag queen children
[3:39:49.860 --> 3:39:52.860]  and to put him in front of actual pedophiles
[3:39:52.860 --> 3:39:56.860]  like this old carol monster to lust after him on the Internet.
[3:39:56.860 --> 3:39:59.860]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:39:59.860 --> 3:40:01.860]  And of course Desmond is amazing,
[3:40:01.860 --> 3:40:04.860]  was previously involved in drag queen story time
[3:40:04.860 --> 3:40:07.860]  in which drag queens visit schools and libraries across America
[3:40:07.860 --> 3:40:11.860]  to read to children because it's progressive.
[3:40:11.860 --> 3:40:13.860]  As we covered many times before,
[3:40:13.860 --> 3:40:17.860]  one of the participants at a drag queen story time event in Houston,
[3:40:17.860 --> 3:40:19.860]  30-year-old Albert Garza,
[3:40:19.860 --> 3:40:22.860]  later turned out to be a registered sex offender
[3:40:22.860 --> 3:40:26.860]  who was convicted of assaulting an eight-year-old boy in 2008.
[3:40:26.860 --> 3:40:29.860]  This guy who's talking about lusting after a kid
[3:40:29.860 --> 3:40:33.860]  is an admitted pedophile, a convicted child pornographer,
[3:40:33.860 --> 3:40:38.860]  and he's allowed to have a blog on WordPress in which he describes
[3:40:38.860 --> 3:40:41.860]  in great detail how he thinks this, quote,
[3:40:41.860 --> 3:40:45.860]  scantily clad boy is sexy and hot.
[3:40:45.860 --> 3:40:49.860]  This is literally on a WordPress blog right now.
[3:40:49.860 --> 3:40:52.860]  Are they going to de-platform him or are they going to ban him?
[3:40:52.860 --> 3:40:54.860]  I guess nothing whatsoever is going to happen,
[3:40:54.860 --> 3:40:56.860]  but they will continue to ban people
[3:40:56.860 --> 3:41:00.860]  who have right-of-center opinions because they're progressive.
[3:41:00.860 --> 3:41:03.860]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:41:03.860 --> 3:41:05.860]  Then we have this upon Summit.News.
[3:41:05.860 --> 3:41:08.860]  New Vermont law would require taxpayers to fund
[3:41:08.860 --> 3:41:11.860]  sex change operations for children.
[3:41:11.860 --> 3:41:13.860]  Now, I've talked about this in the UK.
[3:41:13.860 --> 3:41:15.860]  You have tons of surgeons and doctors
[3:41:15.860 --> 3:41:18.860]  at the Tavis.Institute in London
[3:41:18.860 --> 3:41:21.860]  quitting because they're being forced to perform
[3:41:21.860 --> 3:41:27.860]  sex reassignment treatment on children as young as six.
[3:41:27.860 --> 3:41:29.860]  And I quote at the numbers.
[3:41:29.860 --> 3:41:33.860]  It went from a few dozen minors
[3:41:33.860 --> 3:41:36.860]  asking for this treatment back,
[3:41:36.860 --> 3:41:38.860]  I think it was less than 10 years ago,
[3:41:38.860 --> 3:41:40.860]  to now it's over 2,000.
[3:41:40.860 --> 3:41:43.860]  So it's probably times by about 500%
[3:41:43.860 --> 3:41:45.860]  over the past 10 years.
[3:41:45.860 --> 3:41:49.860]  And obviously that is because this warped gender ideology
[3:41:49.860 --> 3:41:51.860]  is being imposed on them by their parents.
[3:41:51.860 --> 3:41:54.860]  They're the victims, and now huge numbers of people
[3:41:54.860 --> 3:41:58.860]  are quitting because they're refusing to conduct this treatment
[3:41:58.860 --> 3:42:02.860]  on little boys and girls as young as six.
[3:42:02.860 --> 3:42:04.860]  So a New York law in Vermont would require taxpayers
[3:42:04.860 --> 3:42:06.860]  to fund sex change operations for minors
[3:42:06.860 --> 3:42:09.860]  and could even allow such procedures to occur
[3:42:09.860 --> 3:42:11.860]  without parental permission.
[3:42:11.860 --> 3:42:15.860]  This is a new regulation from the Department of Health Access
[3:42:15.860 --> 3:42:18.860]  which would require, said it would require persons
[3:42:18.860 --> 3:42:21.860]  under the age of 18 to get parental consent.
[3:42:21.860 --> 3:42:26.860]  But then it says, if the minor is emancipated by court order,
[3:42:26.860 --> 3:42:30.860]  parental guardian permission is not required.
[3:42:30.860 --> 3:42:33.860]  So this would allow for the first time,
[3:42:33.860 --> 3:42:36.860]  minors under the age of 21,
[3:42:36.860 --> 3:42:39.860]  to get a sex change reassignment operation
[3:42:39.860 --> 3:42:41.860]  on taxpayer expense.
[3:42:41.860 --> 3:42:44.860]  How do you feel about that if you live in Vermont?
[3:42:44.860 --> 3:42:47.860]  You will literally be asked to pay through your taxes
[3:42:47.860 --> 3:42:50.860]  to fund sex change operations for children.
[3:42:50.860 --> 3:42:52.860]  Absolutely sick.
[3:42:52.860 --> 3:42:56.860]  Info wars and free speech and your right to speech
[3:42:56.860 --> 3:42:59.860]  has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so.
[3:42:59.860 --> 3:43:03.860]  It's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane.
[3:43:03.860 --> 3:43:07.860]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time
[3:43:07.860 --> 3:43:11.860]  to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation
[3:43:11.860 --> 3:43:15.860]  and say, hey, we're sinking, I've begged for your support before
[3:43:15.860 --> 3:43:18.860]  and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real SOS.
[3:43:18.860 --> 3:43:21.860]  If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word
[3:43:21.860 --> 3:43:25.860]  and keep fighting, info wars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[3:43:25.860 --> 3:43:27.860]  And so we've reached that point.
[3:43:27.860 --> 3:43:29.860]  We'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever,
[3:43:29.860 --> 3:43:31.860]  we have withstood so many of their attacks,
[3:43:31.860 --> 3:43:33.860]  we've gone through so much because of your support,
[3:43:33.860 --> 3:43:35.860]  you have been there.
[3:43:35.860 --> 3:43:38.860]  But let me tell you, they are pissed they haven't been successful
[3:43:38.860 --> 3:43:40.860]  and they're giving us their full assault.
[3:43:40.860 --> 3:43:43.860]  So we need your prayers, your financial support
[3:43:43.860 --> 3:43:46.860]  and your word of mouth now at infowarscore.com.
[3:43:46.860 --> 3:43:47.860]  It's your fight.
[3:43:47.860 --> 3:43:50.860]  Decide whether or not you want info wars to continue
[3:43:50.860 --> 3:43:52.860]  because we could be shut down.
[3:43:52.860 --> 3:43:55.860]  We'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[3:43:55.860 --> 3:43:58.860]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches
[3:43:58.860 --> 3:44:00.860]  from shutting down the final mega counts we have,
[3:44:00.860 --> 3:44:03.860]  do their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[3:44:03.860 --> 3:44:06.860]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[3:44:06.860 --> 3:44:07.860]  We need the in here.
[3:44:07.860 --> 3:44:10.860]  We need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment
[3:44:10.860 --> 3:44:13.860]  that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[3:44:13.860 --> 3:44:17.860]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[3:44:17.860 --> 3:44:19.860]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[3:44:19.860 --> 3:44:22.860]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[3:44:22.860 --> 3:44:24.860]  That just brings more people here.
[3:44:24.860 --> 3:44:27.860]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[3:44:27.860 --> 3:44:28.860]  I need gas.
[3:44:28.860 --> 3:44:30.860]  I need ammo politically now.
[3:44:30.860 --> 3:44:32.860]  But literally if you flood us with money
[3:44:32.860 --> 3:44:34.860]  and if you flood us with product purchases
[3:44:34.860 --> 3:44:36.860]  and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[3:44:36.860 --> 3:44:37.860]  We're unstoppable together.
[3:44:37.860 --> 3:44:39.860]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[3:44:39.860 --> 3:44:41.860]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now
[3:44:41.860 --> 3:44:43.860]  to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing
[3:44:43.860 --> 3:44:46.860]  and that you will stand with us and I will never back down.
[3:44:46.860 --> 3:44:47.860]  You have my commitment.
[3:44:47.860 --> 3:44:49.860]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding
[3:44:49.860 --> 3:44:53.860]  of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[3:44:53.860 --> 3:44:55.860]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget.
[3:44:55.860 --> 3:44:56.860]  This is the Maximum Alert.

[3:45:00.860 --> 3:45:03.860]  but we need financial support and we're going to put up more prominent

[3:45:11.860 --> 3:45:13.860]  We need money to fight back and to let them know

[3:48:54.860 --> 3:48:59.860]  Now, let's talk about Trump's rape accuser because obviously she had a complete bizarro
[3:48:59.860 --> 3:49:07.860]  meltdown on CNN last night with Anderson Cooper telling him that rape is sexy.
[3:49:07.860 --> 3:49:12.860]  Now, first, she said that basically Trump didn't rape or he threw her down.
[3:49:12.860 --> 3:49:15.860]  Trump, of course, denies everything.
[3:49:15.860 --> 3:49:19.860]  Cooper said, I think most people think of rape as violent assault.
[3:49:19.860 --> 3:49:24.860]  And E Gene Carroll responded by saying, quote, I think most people think of rape as being
[3:49:24.860 --> 3:49:26.860]  sexy.
[3:49:26.860 --> 3:49:32.860]  And as Cooper desperately fumbled around and tried to cut to the adverts, she followed
[3:49:32.860 --> 3:49:35.860]  up with quote, think of the fantasies.
[3:49:35.860 --> 3:49:41.860]  And as you can see in this, she fixes in with a glare and says, you're fascinating to talk
[3:49:41.860 --> 3:49:42.860]  to.
[3:49:42.860 --> 3:49:47.860]  And then Anderson Cooper kind of laughs nervously and she looks absolutely cuckoo for cocoa
[3:49:47.860 --> 3:49:48.860]  puffs.
[3:49:48.860 --> 3:49:51.860]  And he finally manages to cut to a break.
[3:49:51.860 --> 3:49:54.860]  Now, that made the rounds this morning for the right reasons.
[3:49:54.860 --> 3:49:56.860]  It was absolutely insane.
[3:49:56.860 --> 3:50:03.860]  What most people don't realize is Mrs Carol seems to have had a rape fixation for quite
[3:50:03.860 --> 3:50:04.860]  a while.
[3:50:04.860 --> 3:50:07.860]  Specifically for 25 years.
[3:50:07.860 --> 3:50:10.860]  We have another story at Summit.News.
[3:50:10.860 --> 3:50:15.860]  Trump rape accused the one said, quote, women love the idea of being dragged into a cave
[3:50:15.860 --> 3:50:17.860]  by a man.
[3:50:17.860 --> 3:50:23.860]  So this was a conversation on Charlie Rose's show, who, by the way, later got accused by
[3:50:23.860 --> 3:50:32.860]  35 different women of sexual abuse and assault back in 1995, nearly 25 years ago.
[3:50:32.860 --> 3:50:37.860]  The topic of conversation veered into how, according to Carol, women were obsessed with
[3:50:37.860 --> 3:50:38.860]  men.
[3:50:38.860 --> 3:50:43.860]  Now her fellow guest on the show commented, quote, yeah, but there's a lot of rules.
[3:50:43.860 --> 3:50:48.860]  You can't walk out of a cave with a club and drag a woman back.
[3:50:48.860 --> 3:50:59.860]  Trump's rape accuser, Miss E Jean Carol responded by saying, Jimmy, women love that.
[3:50:59.860 --> 3:51:05.860]  So she's basically saying that women love at least rape fantasies, if not rape itself.
[3:51:05.860 --> 3:51:10.860]  That is the connotation of what she's saying with that response.
[3:51:10.860 --> 3:51:17.860]  She then asked Charlie Rose, when was the last time you took a big old club?
[3:51:17.860 --> 3:51:19.860]  Yeah, this actually happened.
[3:51:19.860 --> 3:51:25.860]  So she's on, I think it was CNN back then when Charlie Rose was on, I think it was.
[3:51:25.860 --> 3:51:32.860]  25 years ago, basically saying that women find it a sexy, women love it, the idea of
[3:51:32.860 --> 3:51:38.860]  a man with a club, a caveman with a club dragging them back into a cave, and you know what happens
[3:51:38.860 --> 3:51:39.860]  next.
[3:51:39.860 --> 3:51:43.860]  So she was talking about rape fantasies 25 years ago.
[3:51:43.860 --> 3:51:49.860]  She was on Anderson Cooper talking about rape fantasies last night.
[3:51:49.860 --> 3:51:53.860]  This is their big credible rape accuser with Trump.
[3:51:53.860 --> 3:51:55.860]  Kind of collapsed, hasn't it?
[3:51:55.860 --> 3:51:56.860]  Just like all the others.
[3:51:56.860 --> 3:52:04.860]  There was one back in 2017, I remember, who went on Megan Kelly's show and said that
[3:52:04.860 --> 3:52:09.860]  Trump asked her for her phone number and she described that as sexual assault.
[3:52:09.860 --> 3:52:12.860]  The bar is pretty low at this point.
[3:52:12.860 --> 3:52:15.860]  But again, they always go back to the Access Hollywood tape.
[3:52:15.860 --> 3:52:17.860]  They let you grab them by the pussy.
[3:52:17.860 --> 3:52:22.860]  Well, even though that was someone call it disgusting locker room talk, his own rhetoric
[3:52:22.860 --> 3:52:23.860]  suggested consent.
[3:52:23.860 --> 3:52:29.860]  And this woman was literally on CNN 25 years ago talking about rape fantasies.
[3:52:29.860 --> 3:52:32.860]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:52:32.860 --> 3:52:38.860]  But Newsbusters reports ABCCBS omit Trump accuser describing rape as sexy to Anderson
[3:52:38.860 --> 3:52:39.860]  Cooper.
[3:52:39.860 --> 3:52:44.860]  All three networks Tuesday morning covered the sexual assault allegations by L magazine
[3:52:44.860 --> 3:52:47.860]  columnist Eugene Carroll against President Trump.
[3:52:47.860 --> 3:52:52.860]  With NBC being the only network of the three to just do a brief on the story.
[3:52:52.860 --> 3:52:58.860]  However, the networks omitted the accuser's very odd behavior and comments during the
[3:52:58.860 --> 3:53:00.860]  interview with Anderson Cooper.
[3:53:00.860 --> 3:53:03.860]  ABC gave a full-fledged report on the accusation.
[3:53:03.860 --> 3:53:08.860]  Now, Good Morning America anchor Cecilia Vega described Trump's response to Carroll's
[3:53:08.860 --> 3:53:11.860]  allegation with a disgusted look on her face.
[3:53:11.860 --> 3:53:18.860]  But then when it came to Carol herself, they omitted the worst part of her conversation
[3:53:18.860 --> 3:53:24.860]  with Anderson Cooper, where she said that most people think rape is sexy.
[3:53:24.860 --> 3:53:26.860]  Ask yourself why they would omit that.
[3:53:26.860 --> 3:53:33.860]  Does that show a hint of partisan journalistic bias that the very moment where her credibility
[3:53:33.860 --> 3:53:40.860]  completely collapsed, as if it hadn't already, is edited out by the big news networks?
[3:53:40.860 --> 3:53:45.860]  Don't think we'll be seeing much more of Mrs. Carroll in the near future.
[3:53:45.860 --> 3:53:51.860]  Moving on, UK Lloyds bank off as its staff acid attack guidance, because diversity is
[3:53:51.860 --> 3:53:52.860]  a strength.
[3:53:52.860 --> 3:53:56.860]  Lloyds banking group in the UK is offering its staff acid attack guidance as corrosive
[3:53:56.860 --> 3:54:00.860]  substance attacks continue to rise across the country.
[3:54:00.860 --> 3:54:03.860]  Here you see one on video right now.
[3:54:03.860 --> 3:54:08.860]  These two individuals who got back in the car and sped off after acid attacking two
[3:54:08.860 --> 3:54:14.860]  other individuals had reportedly carried out a separate acid attack in London early the
[3:54:14.860 --> 3:54:22.860]  same day, dressed in Islamic headscarves to hide their identity because diversity is a
[3:54:22.860 --> 3:54:23.860]  strength.
[3:54:23.860 --> 3:54:28.860]  And now an image posted to social media shows a sheet of instructions telling employees
[3:54:28.860 --> 3:54:30.860]  what to do in the event of an attack.
[3:54:30.860 --> 3:54:37.860]  So this information guideline was posted at a branch, I presume it's a branch, of Lloyds
[3:54:37.860 --> 3:54:39.860]  bank, somewhere in the United Kingdom.
[3:54:39.860 --> 3:54:41.860]  It's been circulating on social media.
[3:54:41.860 --> 3:54:45.860]  It says, quote, immediately wash affected body part of patient with plenty of fresh
[3:54:45.860 --> 3:54:46.860]  water.
[3:54:46.860 --> 3:54:50.860]  Lean forward so the water does not move the acid to other parts of your face and body.
[3:54:50.860 --> 3:54:56.860]  And they've been convenient enough to include under this instruction sheet, four large
[3:54:56.860 --> 3:55:02.860]  bottles of water, which can be used for the next acid attack victim to treat them in
[3:55:02.860 --> 3:55:07.860]  their branch that's very considerate of them because diversity is a strength.
[3:55:07.860 --> 3:55:12.860]  According to the National Police Chiefs Council, London now has one of the highest rates of
[3:55:12.860 --> 3:55:16.860]  recorded acid and corrosive substance attacks per capita in the world.
[3:55:16.860 --> 3:55:19.860]  We also have the knife crime that's just an added little bonus.
[3:55:19.860 --> 3:55:26.860]  There are 15 acid attacks in the UK every week with three quarters taking place in London.
[3:55:26.860 --> 3:55:33.860]  This compares to just two a month from 2007 to 2011.
[3:55:33.860 --> 3:55:38.860]  So it sparked rapidly after 2011 after the London riots.
[3:55:38.860 --> 3:55:41.860]  Knife crime across the country also continues to rise.
[3:55:41.860 --> 3:55:45.860]  And in terms of knife crime, in fact, I've got a video coming out probably tomorrow.
[3:55:45.860 --> 3:55:52.860]  London is a bleephole, that's what it's called, where they ask city Khan once again what he's
[3:55:52.860 --> 3:55:54.860]  going to do about violent crime.
[3:55:54.860 --> 3:55:56.860]  What he's going to do about all crime?
[3:55:56.860 --> 3:56:01.860]  Robberies are up 65% in London since city Khan took power.
[3:56:01.860 --> 3:56:04.860]  As mayor, knife crime is up 55%.
[3:56:04.860 --> 3:56:07.860]  Rape is up 45%.
[3:56:07.860 --> 3:56:11.860]  So in a committing eating, they confronted city Khan with these statistics.
[3:56:11.860 --> 3:56:13.860]  And what was his response?
[3:56:13.860 --> 3:56:17.860]  His response was to say London is safe.
[3:56:17.860 --> 3:56:21.860]  And diversity is always a strength.
[3:56:21.860 --> 3:56:27.860]  Black SNUI professor says he feels happy seeing white homeless people begging for food.
[3:56:27.860 --> 3:56:32.860]  This was in an article called Seeing Poor White People Makes Me Happy,
[3:56:32.860 --> 3:56:37.860]  where he literally talks about how Martin Luther King was completely wrong,
[3:56:37.860 --> 3:56:40.860]  and that you shouldn't judge people on the content of their character.
[3:56:40.860 --> 3:56:45.860]  You should judge them on the colour of their skin, the exact opposite message of MLK.
[3:56:45.860 --> 3:56:49.860]  And he said white people begging us for food feels like justice.
[3:56:49.860 --> 3:56:53.860]  It feels like Afrofuturism after America falls.
[3:56:53.860 --> 3:56:55.860]  It feels like a black nationalist wet dream.
[3:56:55.860 --> 3:56:59.860]  It has the feels I rarely feel, a hunger for historical vengeance.
[3:56:59.860 --> 3:57:02.860]  Satisfied so well I rubbed my belly.
[3:57:02.860 --> 3:57:10.860]  What kind of sick, demented, soulless, inhumane freak would see a poor homeless person on the street?
[3:57:10.860 --> 3:57:17.860]  Be they black or white and be glad about it and be happy about it because they're the racist.
[3:57:17.860 --> 3:57:21.860]  Basically he's written an article saying, I'm a racist. I hate white people.
[3:57:21.860 --> 3:57:23.860]  I want them all to die.
[3:57:23.860 --> 3:57:28.860]  And of course he's a professor at SNUI. He's teaching your kids.
[3:57:28.860 --> 3:57:31.860]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.

[3:58:42.860 --> 3:58:46.860]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus here on the air. Thanks for holding.
[3:58:46.860 --> 3:58:49.860]  Hey Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[3:58:49.860 --> 3:58:51.860]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City.
[3:58:51.860 --> 3:58:55.860]  And one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[3:58:55.860 --> 3:58:59.860]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war
[3:58:59.860 --> 3:59:03.860]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public.
[3:59:03.860 --> 3:59:05.860]  The approaching 2020.
[3:59:05.860 --> 3:59:08.860]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[3:59:08.860 --> 3:59:11.860]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[3:59:11.860 --> 3:59:12.860]  It's the time to be praying, my friend.
[3:59:12.860 --> 3:59:16.860]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[3:59:16.860 --> 3:59:18.860]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[3:59:18.860 --> 3:59:21.860]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[3:59:21.860 --> 3:59:23.860]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[3:59:23.860 --> 3:59:26.860]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[3:59:26.860 --> 3:59:30.860]  You've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself
[3:59:30.860 --> 3:59:32.860]  and many others who are going to continue.
[3:59:32.860 --> 3:59:34.860]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War.
[3:59:34.860 --> 3:59:36.860]  And even if something does happen to you or your show,
[3:59:36.860 --> 3:59:40.860]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[3:59:40.860 --> 3:59:57.860]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
