[00:30.000 --> 00:39.920]  I'm all about the truth.
[00:39.920 --> 00:41.120]  And that's what I'm going to lay out here.
[00:41.120 --> 00:42.120]  I'm teleprompter free.
[00:42.120 --> 00:46.480]  I'm not getting talking points from Trump, the CIA, Santa Claus, anybody.
[00:46.480 --> 00:49.520]  It's all from my own research, what I believe in my integrity.
[00:49.520 --> 00:53.080]  So I'll just have integrity here.
[00:53.080 --> 00:59.980]  Trump or whoever runs this Twitter sent on a tweet today that Matt Drudge did not support
[00:59.980 --> 01:06.560]  Trump in 2016 and that Matt Drudge must have confused Joe Biden as the candidate who has
[01:06.560 --> 01:11.160]  cognitive problems and not 74 year old Donald Trump.
[01:11.160 --> 01:13.840]  So let's just talk about the reality.
[01:13.840 --> 01:20.440]  Drudge report was critical in getting President Trump elected and in game changing as the
[01:20.440 --> 01:22.160]  number one news site in the world at that time.
[01:22.160 --> 01:24.400]  It's still right up there at the top.
[01:24.400 --> 01:26.560]  Now that said, I've met Matt Drudge.
[01:26.560 --> 01:27.960]  He's a big fan of the show.
[01:27.960 --> 01:29.800]  He came here and had dinner with us once.
[01:29.800 --> 01:33.920]  I don't know why he's turned against Trump the way he has.
[01:33.920 --> 01:34.920]  That's a separate issue.
[01:34.920 --> 01:35.920]  And it's a free country.
[01:35.920 --> 01:37.840]  You can do what he wants.
[01:37.840 --> 01:42.040]  You notice I don't really talk about Drudge as much because it's not sometimes the game
[01:42.040 --> 01:43.400]  changing links like it was.
[01:43.400 --> 01:47.280]  It's just kind of more like a smorgasbord of what the establishment's saying.
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.720]  But that that's fine.
[01:50.720 --> 01:54.040]  Drudge was critical just like the impoverished audience of activists getting Trump elected.
[01:54.040 --> 01:55.040]  Okay.
[01:55.040 --> 01:56.280]  So that's a false tweet by the president.
[01:56.280 --> 02:01.840]  You don't see a lot of lies out of Trump, but I can document that one is a doozy.
[02:01.840 --> 02:07.600]  But let's roll this video of Trump in a factory and he's dragging one of his legs just a
[02:07.600 --> 02:12.560]  little bit and, you know, kind of be a Mr. Slick about it.
[02:12.560 --> 02:14.840]  I have a torn Achilles.
[02:14.840 --> 02:16.840]  I hobble.
[02:16.840 --> 02:18.560]  Trump's 74.
[02:18.560 --> 02:19.560]  He's had issues.
[02:19.560 --> 02:23.240]  He did go down that gantry, you know, a few months ago with that general at a commencement
[02:23.240 --> 02:25.000]  and kind of watched his step because it was wet.
[02:25.000 --> 02:26.000]  I do that too.
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.440]  I'm all like a penguin sometimes when things are wet and I can't see what's going on.
[02:29.440 --> 02:30.760]  He's 74.
[02:30.760 --> 02:37.680]  The issue is to try to compare Trump's cognitive ability and physical ability to Biden is ridiculous.
[02:37.680 --> 02:43.840]  I mean, Trump's stamina to work 15, 16, 18 hours a day on the spot.
[02:43.840 --> 02:44.840]  Live interviews.
[02:44.840 --> 02:45.840]  The guy is incredible.
[02:45.840 --> 02:46.840]  He was 30 years old.
[02:46.840 --> 02:47.840]  He'd be amazing.
[02:47.840 --> 02:51.640]  And out there playing golf all day, whatever, you know, Biden ride a bicycle, so could a
[02:51.640 --> 02:52.640]  train monkey.
[02:52.640 --> 02:55.280]  Biden can't string a sentence together.
[02:55.280 --> 02:58.000]  Biden says billions died from COVID.
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.000]  Biden has had multiple strokes on record, major brain surgeries, and the Democrats have
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.000]  him as a placeholder.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.120]  So they know they've got big problems in that Biden has cognitive issues.
[03:08.120 --> 03:12.840]  And so it's a democratic talking point to say that Trump has all these problems.
[03:12.840 --> 03:16.080]  And I've heard that Drudge sold out the Democrats.
[03:16.080 --> 03:19.320]  I've heard Drudge, but I don't, there's no proof of that.
[03:19.320 --> 03:26.200]  But this going with many strokes without evidence or showing a leg, which is a little weird,
[03:26.200 --> 03:30.480]  but I don't know what that he's got a Trump connection like Elvis or something, it doesn't
[03:30.480 --> 03:31.480]  hold water.
[03:31.480 --> 03:36.640]  And this is election style stuff, 62 days out, so I'm not judging Trump.
[03:36.640 --> 03:37.720]  I'm not judging Drudge.
[03:37.720 --> 03:39.280]  I'm glad to know both of them.
[03:39.280 --> 03:45.600]  They're both interesting men, but both are full of crap on this.
[03:45.600 --> 03:47.760]  Drudge got Trump elected.
[03:47.760 --> 03:51.840]  I don't know what happened between him or the schism.
[03:51.840 --> 03:59.800]  And on the other side, I don't see that Trump's had this big stroke and all the rest is garbage.
[03:59.800 --> 04:04.480]  If you want to know who's expiration date is up and who obviously has serious problems
[04:04.480 --> 04:09.360]  this show Biden, but hey, Trump's 74, his brother just died a week ago.
[04:09.360 --> 04:12.560]  I mean, we're not saying he couldn't fall over dead tomorrow.
[04:12.560 --> 04:19.160]  It's just that obviously the timer clicked, the egg clock tick, the egg timer.
[04:19.160 --> 04:22.680]  I mean, Joe Biden's finale, he's over.
[04:22.680 --> 04:26.120]  And so that's what's so frightening as a Democrats will try to push something like
[04:26.120 --> 04:32.200]  this on us back to the live transmission tonight with election countdown with Deanna Lorraine.
[04:32.200 --> 04:33.200]  All right.
[04:33.200 --> 04:36.120]  That's a little bit of what was on the show last night thought I'd start the broadcast
[04:36.120 --> 04:37.120]  with that.
[04:37.120 --> 04:39.040]  We've got over the top important information.
[04:39.040 --> 04:42.880]  The U.N. has launched his planetary takeover, it's been going on a while, but that was all
[04:42.880 --> 04:44.280]  the preparatory phase.
[04:44.280 --> 04:47.400]  They're now launching the full takeover and if people don't respond to it, understand
[04:47.400 --> 04:49.680]  what they're being hit by, they'll be defeated by it.
[04:49.680 --> 04:54.520]  But thanks to you, thanks to this transmission and to Patriots Worldwide, we will prevail.
[04:54.520 --> 04:57.520]  God bless you.
[04:57.520 --> 05:00.440]  I'm not going to lie to you.
[05:00.440 --> 05:04.560]  I want to stay in the fight against Soros of Hillary and the New World Order and the
[05:04.560 --> 05:10.520]  only way I do is if you buy a lot of products at infowarstore.com, you got to sell a lot
[05:10.520 --> 05:15.440]  of vitamins and a lot of minerals and a lot of fish oil and a lot of t-shirts and a lot
[05:15.440 --> 05:20.440]  of water filters to fund an operation in the face of the globalist and all the DNC lawsuits,
[05:20.440 --> 05:23.360]  but they're so close to losing right now.
[05:23.360 --> 05:28.960]  Plus I go out just like with info and I bring you the very best items, the very best products
[05:28.960 --> 05:31.720]  that I personally use and I love.
[05:31.720 --> 05:37.320]  So go to infowarstore.com, check out the products, get some today, share them with friends, review
[05:37.320 --> 05:41.840]  them and know that you cannot lose because you're funding the info war, let's fight the
[05:41.840 --> 05:46.240]  globalist, plus these are great products, but I want to thank you for keeping me in
[05:46.240 --> 05:47.240]  the game.
[05:47.240 --> 05:51.560]  I want to thank you for funding our operation, so continue to spread the word and fund info
[05:51.560 --> 05:55.560]  wars and infowarstore.com and I salute you once again, once again, once again, once
[05:55.560 --> 06:19.560]  again, once again, once again, once again.
[06:19.560 --> 06:26.000]  Sixty days my friends, sixty days until a referendum on nationalism and freedom and
[06:26.000 --> 06:32.600]  capitalism and Christianity against Satanism, the end of humanity, the post-human era and
[06:32.600 --> 06:36.960]  the new world order of Satan.
[06:36.960 --> 06:42.760]  That's really not hyperbole, that's what it is.
[06:42.760 --> 06:46.480]  I've been saying for years this election is a referendum on good versus evil and now
[06:46.480 --> 06:49.680]  that's the mainline sentiment of just the general public, people that don't even believe
[06:49.680 --> 06:57.240]  in God, suddenly do and say, I'm seeing people act like demon-possessed crazies on the left.
[06:57.240 --> 06:59.320]  What's wrong with them?
[06:59.320 --> 07:01.160]  It really is a spirit.
[07:01.160 --> 07:04.040]  It's like they're enchanted by something destructive.
[07:04.040 --> 07:08.760]  Trump even talked about that yesterday and he also talked about stupid rich people in
[07:08.760 --> 07:14.080]  dark shadows trying to fund a violent revolution that will only blow up in their face but they
[07:14.080 --> 07:15.520]  can't stop.
[07:15.520 --> 07:16.520]  They're in epic time to be alive.
[07:16.520 --> 07:20.840]  Let me give you the quadrants here of the different news we have to cover.
[07:20.840 --> 07:27.040]  It is now not just official, from the drawing board 14 months ago when we first started
[07:27.040 --> 07:30.920]  telling you they're going to contest the election with mail-in ballots and say that when Trump
[07:30.920 --> 07:35.600]  can test that fraud, he should be removed by the military.
[07:35.600 --> 07:43.120]  Well then you saw them begin to prepare it, roll it out and now Bloomberg, now Facebook,
[07:43.120 --> 07:51.860]  Mark Zuckerberg have given hundreds of millions of dollars to push the mail-in fraudulent
[07:51.860 --> 07:55.720]  ballots that they're bombing the country with to gum things up so that the election
[07:55.720 --> 08:01.720]  is put into question, which is what John Podesta and Hillary and others are on record saying
[08:01.720 --> 08:03.120]  they want to do.
[08:03.120 --> 08:11.120]  And now they've got what they're calling the red, the red mirage that when you see Trump
[08:11.120 --> 08:16.880]  win almost every state, when you see a giant electoral college victory, well it doesn't
[08:16.880 --> 08:23.120]  count because there'll be such a disaster with ballots designed to create a disaster
[08:23.120 --> 08:27.280]  that they're going to hold up the election weeks or months, which is the admitted plan.
[08:27.280 --> 08:29.520]  And I know I keep harping on this.
[08:29.520 --> 08:31.600]  There's hundreds, hundreds of incredible stories.
[08:31.600 --> 08:34.840]  I've got 30 plus incredible clips.
[08:34.840 --> 08:38.000]  If I just wanted to put on an entertaining show, we could have a show that was way more
[08:38.000 --> 08:39.000]  entertaining.
[08:39.000 --> 08:40.520]  But that's not what this is.
[08:40.520 --> 08:43.320]  This is an emergency transmission to defeat these people.
[08:43.320 --> 08:49.120]  So we have a problem, you have a problem that once we know something, we tend to move on.
[08:49.120 --> 08:53.760]  But if something's the key of what the enemy's going to do in 61 days, we just can't let
[08:53.760 --> 08:54.960]  them gloss over it.
[08:54.960 --> 08:59.200]  They're all over the news saying Trump's going to win in a landslide.
[08:59.200 --> 09:00.840]  They know internally they've cratered.
[09:00.840 --> 09:04.960]  They know the riots and the intimidation and the saying that pulled out all the monuments
[09:04.960 --> 09:10.240]  and that the police are all evil and America sucks and Hispanics are rejecting it in record
[09:10.240 --> 09:11.240]  numbers.
[09:11.240 --> 09:12.240]  Blacks are rejecting it.
[09:12.240 --> 09:17.320]  Whites are rejecting it unless they're liberal academic types who think they're the ruling
[09:17.320 --> 09:18.320]  class.
[09:18.320 --> 09:24.720]  And so the globalists have really failed, just like they did a year and a half ago with
[09:24.720 --> 09:28.880]  the whole or two years ago with the whole Brexit thing when they tried to repeal Brexit
[09:28.880 --> 09:33.200]  and they called everyone racist and they said the national anthem was evil and they said
[09:33.200 --> 09:36.400]  get rid of the UK entirely.
[09:36.400 --> 09:41.640]  And people that were bullied, classical liberals that believed in openness and freedom, realized
[09:41.640 --> 09:47.400]  they were being exploited and voted in Boris Johnson who's gone sideways with COVID and
[09:47.400 --> 09:53.560]  things but is at least not a globalist and Nigel Farage got him into power.
[09:53.560 --> 09:59.360]  And so this is a really big moment we've reached here but I've got that whole area exclusive.
[09:59.360 --> 10:03.600]  Bloomberg Group warns Trump will appear to win big on election night but won't.
[10:03.600 --> 10:07.520]  JPMorgan says key markets brace for contested election.
[10:07.520 --> 10:13.800]  The Democrats say they will contest it but again he's not allowed to contest their contesting.
[10:13.800 --> 10:16.440]  According to the Democrat talking points but why are they scared?
[10:16.440 --> 10:21.040]  New tracking polls show Trump surges 28% support among black Americans.
[10:21.040 --> 10:23.560]  We got 8% last time.
[10:23.560 --> 10:29.160]  Two polls show black support for Trump more than doubled since 2016 and other polls are
[10:29.160 --> 10:32.200]  showing similar numbers and that's what internal polling is showing.
[10:32.200 --> 10:36.600]  So you have to ask yourself well they did fake polls last time, it basically destroyed
[10:36.600 --> 10:37.600]  the polling industry.
[10:37.600 --> 10:39.080]  Why are they being more honest this time?
[10:39.080 --> 10:42.400]  Well they're still oversampling 10 to 15 points more Democrats.
[10:42.400 --> 10:43.400]  That's just in the sauce.
[10:43.400 --> 10:47.800]  They say there's more Democrats than Republicans, it's not true but that's how they always skew
[10:47.800 --> 10:51.320]  it so people then that are on the fence go well I want to vote for a winner and it's
[10:51.320 --> 10:55.160]  the bandwagon effect or people don't go vote because they think well you know my candidate's
[10:55.160 --> 10:56.160]  going to lose.
[10:56.160 --> 11:06.440]  It's a deception management manipulation but because of the fact that they know that people
[11:06.440 --> 11:10.320]  don't believe the polls anymore well why should they just put out lies and fake polls and
[11:10.320 --> 11:15.280]  the Democrats even come out on CNN last week and with official talking points it said Trump
[11:15.280 --> 11:18.560]  doesn't follow the polls, he doesn't believe them, the public doesn't so we're not going
[11:18.560 --> 11:22.840]  to really push them anymore either which probably means they will later but right now they're
[11:22.840 --> 11:28.520]  pushing polls that aren't as deceptive because they want credibility on election night for
[11:28.520 --> 11:33.000]  the landslide which they then say is the red mirage because oh Democrats were all scared
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.720]  of COVID yeah right they're all busy sending in the ballots under the name of their dead
[11:36.720 --> 11:41.400]  dad their dead neighbor their dead mom their dead cat that will confuse the system it'll
[11:41.400 --> 11:47.200]  be impossible to process it all and then you will have a jackknife sabotage election.
[11:47.200 --> 11:53.920]  So I've got a whole stack of news on this I'm not going to get into it until later in
[11:53.920 --> 11:57.840]  the second hour I wanted to take more calls yesterday I dropped the ball I made people
[11:57.840 --> 12:01.120]  sit on hold and I apologize and I'm getting better about not doing that most of the time
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.600]  but I'm going to open the phones up today at the bottom of the hour and then I'm going
[12:05.600 --> 12:11.280]  to take calls right through until the end of the next hour and then we have that incredible
[12:11.280 --> 12:18.760]  individual Mr. Zapata that gave that powerful two-minute citizens communications Carlos Zapata
[12:18.760 --> 12:26.120]  a better orator than I am he is going to be joining us he's a veteran and he's a patriot
[12:26.120 --> 12:32.880]  and he laid it all on the line so this will be his first big interview since he came out
[12:32.880 --> 12:38.040]  of the shadows and blew him away and that's really our ace of spades that's our trump
[12:38.040 --> 12:42.760]  card is that there's all these men and women who are good hardworking people who don't
[12:42.760 --> 12:46.320]  want the spotlight who don't want to be in power who just want to be left alone and
[12:46.320 --> 12:50.000]  raise their families and have their businesses that are being put in the corner and you're
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.960]  going to see coming out of every angle Hispanic black white old young male female gay straight
[12:55.960 --> 13:00.840]  you name it you're going to see people across the board that say I'm not your slave I know
[13:00.840 --> 13:05.600]  you're trying to enslave me I know you're a liar and you can't stop us all if you keep
[13:05.600 --> 13:12.400]  pushing it's going to get bloody and they already tried to get us into a bloody situation
[13:12.400 --> 13:16.000]  that's why they've already pressured us and already pushed us and we don't want that
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.840]  but I said if they steal the election if they're rounding people up and arresting them if they're
[13:19.840 --> 13:23.880]  doing all this politically you reach a point where if they're running a classic communist
[13:23.880 --> 13:28.240]  operation where they have control of the cities you don't want to just wait in the countryside
[13:28.240 --> 13:33.240]  or they come later to get you a year or two later when the food's cut off you have to
[13:33.240 --> 13:37.600]  go into the cities and remove the globalist and then you got to have fallback positions
[13:37.600 --> 13:42.040]  of that fails in the countryside for the resistance you've got to be identifying who the communist
[13:42.040 --> 13:46.240]  and globalist operatives are in your town now this isn't a game folks okay this isn't
[13:46.240 --> 13:51.160]  larping and is it cute stuff this isn't make believe stuff this is the real world okay
[13:51.160 --> 13:56.840]  this is the real deal so I say offensively fix the country peacefully that's our offense
[13:56.840 --> 14:01.080]  but you have to defensively really understand that they're saying we're going to take over
[14:01.080 --> 14:04.760]  and have a bloody purge of you and your family we're going to come dig you out of your houses
[14:04.760 --> 14:08.560]  and put you in a forced labor camp that's your children your wife they're going to kill
[14:08.560 --> 14:12.600]  you and they're saying they are and that's their blueprint how do I know what they're
[14:12.600 --> 14:15.720]  going to do next I've got their blueprints we've got their blueprints we know who they
[14:15.720 --> 14:19.760]  are they're going to fail I believe in this if we're active and we're vigilant and we
[14:19.760 --> 14:27.720]  get in their face but if they win this first round and come for us if they're crazy enough
[14:27.720 --> 14:32.840]  to do that you have to realize that there are books written about the resistance against
[14:32.840 --> 14:36.600]  the Nazis that are good like total resistance I read back when I was a teenager you know
[14:36.600 --> 14:40.880]  that's in print there are other books about guerrilla warfare you can read about there's
[14:40.880 --> 14:47.640]  a lot of 21st century overlays to all of that but the key is if we go to something like
[14:47.640 --> 14:53.000]  that the enemy is going to have their moron fodder decoys out that they pay 200 bucks
[14:53.000 --> 14:59.680]  a day to go burn things hoping you come down to engage their decoys you don't in a war
[14:59.680 --> 15:04.960]  engage the cannon fodder that's that's World War one and before stuff you go after the
[15:04.960 --> 15:09.640]  command and control and the leadership of an enemy operation and I'm not planning any
[15:09.640 --> 15:13.760]  of that and I'm not a military person though I study more than most people in the military
[15:13.760 --> 15:19.960]  do most of them are just politicals that follow orders but this is the wheelhouse we're entering
[15:19.960 --> 15:26.400]  now with a communist globalist funded foreign combine planning the shutdown of the country
[15:26.400 --> 15:32.160]  the total breakdown of the country bringing us to our knees now speaking of that you go
[15:32.160 --> 15:36.120]  to the top headline in four words dot com today I announced that the United Nations
[15:36.120 --> 15:40.120]  is now engaged the takeover of much of the planet I'll tell you who's behind it what

[18:52.000 --> 19:01.040]  steeds they ride they come to take your life again ladies and gentlemen thank you so much
[19:01.040 --> 19:10.680]  for joining us on this live september second wednesday 2020 transmission we are 61 days
[19:10.680 --> 19:21.080]  out ladies and gentlemen okay let's get into it right now i want this to sink in real good
[19:21.080 --> 19:29.600]  for everybody because the john burt society and the liberty movement starting in the
[19:29.600 --> 19:44.120]  fifties had the actual takeover plan because army officers and cia operatives and officers
[19:44.120 --> 19:49.480]  who believe they were working for the u.s. government were inside the compartmentalized
[19:49.480 --> 19:56.040]  operations and saw the global plan for the world the u.n. taking over the nation states
[19:56.040 --> 20:03.320]  dictating medicine religion economics the family of the end of the family forced the
[20:03.320 --> 20:11.000]  population through starvation through forced inoculations i mean you go back and you watch
[20:11.000 --> 20:16.600]  the speeches from the fifties of the john burt society in the sixties and i'm not a member
[20:16.600 --> 20:21.240]  of the john burt society my dad grew up reading about it and seeing it and went and gave some
[20:21.240 --> 20:27.320]  anti-communist speeches and did a radio show when he was a kid in dallas once a week against
[20:27.320 --> 20:33.000]  the communist he didn't try to get me into radio i didn't know he did that till later
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.800]  i went and did it and i discovered all that a lot of stuff i didn't know about my dad
[20:37.800 --> 20:46.360]  but i guess chip off the old block and this was no knowledge that you had state department
[20:46.360 --> 20:54.800]  of random 7277 which describes how they incrementally disarmed the people then the military and
[20:54.800 --> 20:59.400]  the police and only the u.n. is armed and it's a hunger game scenario how they then
[20:59.400 --> 21:07.400]  have certain districts in each sub district 10 global regions 3 mega regions 10 sub regions
[21:07.400 --> 21:14.360]  within each of the 10 sub regions 3 mega regions 10 sub regions 10 sub regions per region i
[21:14.360 --> 21:21.960]  mean it's the 10 regions of fema and europe has 10 regions and then each country has
[21:21.960 --> 21:32.200]  10 regions i mean this is all official and so i remember the good old boys even when
[21:32.200 --> 21:36.600]  i was like six seven years old talking about the cfr and the new world order and david
[21:36.600 --> 21:40.520]  rockabeller and sabignin brzezinski and my dad had all their books on the table and
[21:40.520 --> 21:44.760]  you know he was reading all about what they were saying and doing and
[21:47.400 --> 21:51.240]  and my mom's dad would come over to the house they'd rant and ram about it i mean and the
[21:51.240 --> 21:56.040]  chinese they gave me the icbms and the russians and the plan to nuke the russians with the chinese
[21:56.040 --> 22:01.240]  and i mean i'm sitting there listening to all this stuff and to me that's just background noise
[22:01.240 --> 22:11.640]  and then all these years later it all came true it all happened and we're up to the point are you
[22:11.640 --> 22:17.080]  ready for the rest of it to happen because it just gets horrible from here on out i mean all this
[22:17.080 --> 22:23.240]  is built up like they're rolling the big boulder up the hill to roll it down on us and they've
[22:23.240 --> 22:34.120]  got it up at the top of the hill now and they are releasing it as we speak
[22:34.920 --> 22:39.320]  and so when you think of a peaceful world they mean getting rid of men getting rid of families
[22:39.320 --> 22:43.720]  corporately controlling everyone ending the normal human cycle because the carney endowment
[22:43.720 --> 22:48.200]  after world war one and then world war two the main job was to create a world government to
[22:48.200 --> 22:55.000]  end war and the scientists came back and said in the family in men being aggressive in private
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.720]  property but none of that was really even the plan it was about a super elite getting total control
[22:59.720 --> 23:11.320]  over everyone and so once i got on air 26 years ago people thought well when the un comes with
[23:11.320 --> 23:15.000]  their blue helmets we're going to get them and i always told you they're not going to come in
[23:15.000 --> 23:19.400]  blue helmets they're going to come with agenda 21 agenda 2030 they're going to come with regulations
[23:19.400 --> 23:23.000]  they're going to come with shutting the economy down they're going to come with taking our fuel away
[23:23.000 --> 23:28.520]  and our factories they're going to come through the educational system dumbing us down sexualizing
[23:28.520 --> 23:34.440]  our children getting us into debt undermining our morals this is their plan it's all on record
[23:34.440 --> 23:42.680]  and then finally when they drop the hammer they're going to kill the dollar
[23:45.320 --> 23:51.080]  they're going to trigger riots all over the united states and they're going to have a bio weapon
[23:51.080 --> 23:55.880]  release that i've been telling you for years as the cover to keep people locked down and other
[23:55.880 --> 24:01.720]  people off balance so that you can segue from one martial law into another martial law and
[24:01.720 --> 24:07.320]  whether trump loses or wins they plan to segue into real martial law with race riots they're
[24:07.320 --> 24:11.640]  going to trigger whether trump wins or loses they're going to continue on because we don't have full
[24:11.640 --> 24:16.440]  control of the country and we haven't arrested the leadership of the globalist operation
[24:16.440 --> 24:21.320]  which trump is starting to talk about to congress you got to arrest sorrows you got to arrest these
[24:21.320 --> 24:29.800]  people they're literally engaged in criminal activity on a mass scale so finally the establishment
[24:29.800 --> 24:35.000]  that is it totally suicidal and insane gets this isn't the old game of selling us out to china and
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.200]  making a bunch of money we're done they're gonna butcher the hog they're gonna kill the golden goose
[24:40.200 --> 24:44.920]  you cannot let them do this the games are over it's an existential battle we were set up to be
[24:44.920 --> 24:50.840]  sold out by china we have to say no and come back to life now and rally the forces politically
[24:50.840 --> 24:55.800]  culturally spiritually economically militarily and through law enforcement in the general public
[24:55.800 --> 25:04.040]  to absolutely expose this foreign attack override it and reject it fully you can't just recognize
[25:04.040 --> 25:08.120]  you've been given poison pills you got to stick your fingers down your throat and you got to throw
[25:08.120 --> 25:13.640]  them up and they got to take a bunch of activated charcoal politically you got to vomit the rest
[25:13.640 --> 25:22.360]  of it out you got to get it out of your guts now or you will die we have been poisoned
[25:22.360 --> 25:29.240]  and recognizing it is not enough you have to reject the enemy let them know they're the enemy
[25:29.240 --> 25:33.400]  and let their stupid minions know that you're not going i'm a liberal i believe in your speech
[25:33.400 --> 25:38.040]  why are you attacking me because they're not liberals they're fascist globalist chai com
[25:38.040 --> 25:43.400]  controlled monsters who've been promised power and they've never had any power in their lives
[25:44.120 --> 25:47.240]  they're on welfare they're on drugs they're devil worshiping they're doing everything
[25:47.240 --> 25:53.080]  else the media told them to be successful and they're not successful and the enemies tell them again
[25:53.080 --> 25:59.080]  if you just go out and do all this you'll finally be a real boy you'll finally have power and that's
[25:59.080 --> 26:04.440]  where we are so when we come back it's the headline on info wars dot com it's official we've got
[26:04.440 --> 26:10.520]  unbelievable footage australia has fallen to you and control mass arrest begin and i'm going to give

[26:52.040 --> 27:00.840]  about australia they're coming here next there's a nauseating sense to it not a sense of triumph
[27:00.840 --> 27:11.480]  on a sense of victory not a sense of completion the sense of the sixth nausea though we were right
[27:11.480 --> 27:17.000]  about the world government we were right about the anti-human plans we were right about all the horrible
[27:17.880 --> 27:23.080]  things the globalists and their satanic order want to do to us now we sit here

[27:30.040 --> 27:36.520]  what revelations and god's word says it's coming so you can't stop it and it's in that understanding
[27:36.520 --> 27:42.840]  that we're part of guards larger plan than he come to the point in our own psyche our own spirit
[27:42.840 --> 27:49.400]  in our own will that we submit to god and realize god's in charge of god as a part and the devil
[27:49.400 --> 27:54.200]  is set as a tester now it's up to us to make the right decision that's what's really always been

[29:53.800 --> 30:09.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[30:24.520 --> 30:30.520]  here's what i'm trying to say this is the main assault this is the beginning of things just
[30:30.520 --> 30:34.920]  getting crazier i don't tell you that to scare you i tell you that because you're going to be
[30:34.920 --> 30:41.960]  victorious everybody that's sitting on their ass and making jokes about abortion and devil worship
[30:41.960 --> 30:47.320]  and all the satanism they're going to be forced to worship their god they're going to be forced to
[30:47.320 --> 30:55.640]  see what satan really is they're going to be torn limb from limb so remember that this is the end
[30:55.640 --> 31:01.640]  of the games the end of the decadence the end of the fraud and the more it drains away from them the
[31:01.640 --> 31:05.720]  more they're going to clutch to it and the more they're going to try to be self-destructive to
[31:05.720 --> 31:12.600]  hurt us but in the end they've only dug the pit for themselves and they're shoveling themselves
[31:12.600 --> 31:18.280]  into their psychic grave pools all right let's get into it right now
[31:22.600 --> 31:27.800]  i am not here because you know used to i would just say things on air that i learned people
[31:27.800 --> 31:34.200]  interpret things differently than what i believe i'm saying so that's why i talk about myself a lot
[31:34.200 --> 31:40.840]  not in some narcissistic way but and so you understand where i'm coming from jason jones
[31:40.840 --> 31:46.600]  is a very successful filmmaker author researcher and he comes here and he's like i just really
[31:46.600 --> 31:51.960]  appreciate how much you care about hawaii and the indigenous people and you know how much you know
[31:51.960 --> 31:56.360]  about their history and what they went through and and and how you really care how they have
[31:56.360 --> 32:01.560]  checkpoints and force testing and are saying force inoculations coming and i looked at him and i
[32:01.560 --> 32:06.440]  said jason i know you're a nice guy and a big christian and help people but there's a perspective
[32:06.440 --> 32:13.880]  thing here you understand they're beta testing in hawaii for everybody i mean they admit that
[32:15.320 --> 32:20.840]  so i'm a cow being sent through a squeeze shoe at a slaughterhouse and i see other cows being
[32:20.840 --> 32:25.160]  chopped up 50 feet in front of me i'm gonna be bucking and kicking and trying to get out and
[32:25.160 --> 32:31.240]  i care about the cow getting chopped up but i really care about me me and see that's the thing is
[32:31.240 --> 32:36.120]  everybody thinks one-dimensional and jason's a smart guy i'm not putting down people say what
[32:36.120 --> 32:40.520]  do you care about australia well that's that's the other side of the planet well that's an 18-hour
[32:40.520 --> 32:47.720]  plane flight australia is being run by the very same international institutions and is a beta test
[32:47.720 --> 32:54.360]  to show us the images just like we saw in china of a horrible dystopic science fiction nightmare
[32:54.360 --> 33:00.520]  dystopia and they admit and the un is bragging that they're preparing to export that to blue
[33:00.520 --> 33:06.200]  cities and blue states and then finally to red areas and i'm the cops come to arrest me for my
[33:06.200 --> 33:12.840]  speech saying covid's a fraud i'm resisting and see that's the thing though there's a line in the
[33:12.840 --> 33:18.600]  sand and this is it you're forced inoculations arresting people i've sworn to only tell you what
[33:18.600 --> 33:23.640]  i really believe and i and i'm gonna tell you australians should really be having a public
[33:23.640 --> 33:28.520]  discussion about who you're occupied by who's taking you over and what these police are doing
[33:28.520 --> 33:32.920]  because these police are following orders but that won't cut it with a nuremberg and the geneva
[33:32.920 --> 33:38.680]  convention so i don't want to make them the distraction though they're not where this is
[33:38.680 --> 33:44.040]  coming from they're being told in select leftist cities like melbourne notice it's not conservative
[33:44.040 --> 33:50.760]  areas are doing it's the same thing like the u.s to do this and now they're going to people's houses
[33:50.760 --> 33:59.160]  i'm gonna show you a video in a moment in this test city and arresting pregnant women
[34:01.320 --> 34:08.360]  in front of their children and dragging them off to jail for having anti lockdown rallies
[34:08.360 --> 34:15.640]  and folks in at least five major cities of australia and on the phones up for aussies to call in
[34:15.640 --> 34:19.320]  they don't even let people out of their apartment blocks for up to eight weeks you don't leave
[34:19.320 --> 34:26.920]  the house this is a globalist power grab and the un has said you're under un control we dictate
[34:26.920 --> 34:32.440]  what you do and australia is following un guidelines trups getting us out of the un and here's examples
[34:32.440 --> 34:43.480]  of this un condemns us for gun violence jacob blake shooting and the un has put out a press release
[34:43.480 --> 34:51.080]  saying america's bad what in the world in god's green creation is the un doing telling us what
[34:51.080 --> 34:55.240]  to do with our guns they have unity or meaning saying their goals are totally disarmous it's
[34:55.240 --> 35:00.280]  seven two seven seven complete in general disarmament where only the un has guns not the police
[35:00.280 --> 35:04.200]  not the military we used to read that stuff and go how are they gonna disarm the police military
[35:05.960 --> 35:10.120]  because you have the un is the overseer via the strong cities initiative worldwide they come in
[35:10.120 --> 35:15.160]  and cherry pick a bad event and then say the whole department is bad and then when you go under un
[35:15.160 --> 35:20.600]  control you no longer have the left of the media attacking you and stirring up mobs to bring down
[35:20.600 --> 35:26.120]  your country that's all this is it's very elementary it's very simple so before i get into all these
[35:26.120 --> 35:32.040]  articles and give the number out look at this right here un condemns us for gun violence taken
[35:32.040 --> 35:37.240]  blake shooting in theory the united nations is just solely to prevent another world war
[35:37.240 --> 35:41.320]  well it lasted longer than the last attempt and the thing the league of nations it hasn't really
[35:41.320 --> 35:45.960]  stopped many wars so far no it just runs child kidnapping and drug dealing its international
[35:45.960 --> 35:53.640]  crime unit instead the un spends a fair bit of its time giving jumped up dictatorships
[35:53.640 --> 35:59.080]  the supposed authority to band together in particular united states for stuff that really
[35:59.080 --> 36:04.680]  none of their business the latest example the un human rights office has condemned the us over
[36:04.680 --> 36:11.240]  jake of blake shooting and ongoing gun violence in our cities and they have the spokesperson for
[36:11.240 --> 36:15.400]  the un high commission criticizing us and saying we're committing crimes against humanity ladies
[36:15.400 --> 36:21.080]  and gentlemen that's un control and it's the un that gets the corporate money the corporate
[36:21.080 --> 36:26.600]  governance then beneath it's the un so it's a consortium of corporate governance and dictatorships
[36:26.600 --> 36:31.640]  on the top corporate governances are dictatorships globally and then countries are dictatorships
[36:31.640 --> 36:36.360]  by communist china they write the policies as shareholders is what they call themselves
[36:36.360 --> 36:42.280]  then the offices of the un put out policy in our countries have signed on to treaties like unesco
[36:42.280 --> 36:46.680]  treaty that trump holds out of three years ago that make it where our education our medicine
[36:46.680 --> 36:52.440]  our culture our regulations are under the un but even when trump pulls us out of those bureaucracies
[36:52.440 --> 36:57.560]  they continue to follow the treaties and the agreements because there's corporate sponsorship
[36:57.560 --> 37:03.960]  into global governance as well not just us money going to the un so that's how bill gates is in
[37:03.960 --> 37:13.240]  control of world vaccine law and other medicine so australia pregnant woman arrested in her home
[37:13.240 --> 37:20.840]  in full wars dot com paul joseph watch an article in anti lockdown facebook post shocking video
[37:20.840 --> 37:26.520]  from melbourne australia shows a pregnant woman being arrested in front of her children in her own
[37:26.520 --> 37:32.840]  home for the crime of organizing an anti lockdown protest on facebook and facebook of course reported
[37:32.840 --> 37:36.280]  her so it's one thing if they want to say there's a lot of arrested if you go out and have a protest
[37:36.280 --> 37:40.360]  but blm in the same town can have them the muslims can demonstrate it's just the general public that
[37:40.360 --> 37:46.360]  can't because you're the slaves that's criminal as well but to say she doesn't have the right to
[37:46.360 --> 37:50.920]  say we should organize and march to demonstrate just like that they've banned your free speech and
[37:50.920 --> 37:56.440]  your right to petition which they supposedly have in their australian constitution so this is the same
[37:56.440 --> 38:01.640]  thing here churches can't open restaurants can't open unless you're a democrat but
[38:02.920 --> 38:08.040]  blm and the left can do whatever they want that's all this is is selective martial law we'll come
[38:08.040 --> 38:14.280]  back with this footage and the un bragging how they're in control of it but this is the un in
[38:14.280 --> 38:20.440]  control and try to take control of our guns of our police of our society because the federal
[38:20.440 --> 38:26.680]  government goes oh we won't control what the states or locals do we're hands off we're handcuffed by the
[38:26.680 --> 38:32.520]  aclu and the liberals and george soros's uh people he's gotten appointed and elected everywhere as
[38:32.520 --> 38:36.440]  district attorneys and so the republicans sit there like they're still living in america while the
[38:36.440 --> 38:42.280]  un and soros and their gangs totally take over and the same thing in australia australians this is
[38:42.280 --> 38:47.800]  an international takeover putting you under permanent martial law i had a force inoculations
[38:47.800 --> 38:54.600]  that will sterilize you it is your right and your duty to say no and the police are guilty of treason
[38:54.600 --> 39:00.520]  against the people of australia when a sycophantic followers they follow these orders shame on you
[39:00.520 --> 39:06.680]  you are enemies of humanity enemies of the people and you are on notice and anybody in the
[39:06.680 --> 39:12.280]  constabulary and the united states or europe or anywhere else that goes by this is enemies and are
[39:12.280 --> 39:18.120]  dangerous violating the geneva convention and the nuremberg code of force inoculation force
[39:18.120 --> 39:25.320]  medical testing and experimentation you are joseph mingolas henchman you are criminal tyrants
[39:25.320 --> 39:30.840]  who've been trained to follow the orders now if you live in australia you can't call 1-800 as some
[39:30.840 --> 39:39.160]  can all the country access code in 512-646-1776 512-646-1776 the toll-free line many can call
[39:39.160 --> 39:52.280]  from australia on that 877-789-2539 877-789 alex 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 first calls only from australia
[39:53.560 --> 39:58.440]  this isn't about me taking credit in fact it's the opposite it's about getting you to understand
[39:58.440 --> 40:04.040]  that you have all the power going back three weeks ago they had the entire austin greenbelt
[40:04.040 --> 40:09.720]  shut down and they had the spillway by martin springs shut down as well as the main pool
[40:10.360 --> 40:16.040]  that's always been paying for the last 50 years or so it's a damned up spring well we went down
[40:16.040 --> 40:22.440]  there and we got in the park at different areas around town in the last few weeks and educated
[40:22.440 --> 40:27.400]  people that it was all a giant fraud and now despite the fact that they still say the parks are
[40:27.400 --> 40:33.160]  closed you get out of any area you'll see dozens if not hundreds of people depending where you're at
[40:33.160 --> 40:38.760]  actually using bart springs here in austin texas so bill gates and the globalists give the orders
[40:38.760 --> 40:44.040]  to the un the un gives the orders down through the national health services like our nih and we
[40:44.040 --> 40:50.200]  all follow it like dutiful slaves stop complying with your own enslavement stop following the
[40:50.200 --> 40:55.800]  orders of these globalist traders start being free again going back more than 20 years ago i
[40:55.800 --> 41:01.640]  coined the term the false left right paradigm from reading the books by carol quickley's
[41:01.640 --> 41:08.680]  speaking brazilian others how they described powerful institutions and foundations successful
[41:08.680 --> 41:15.560]  takeover of the left parties and right parties in europe and the united states it didn't mean that
[41:15.560 --> 41:20.200]  those parties didn't have differences before they were able to get control the leadership of both
[41:20.200 --> 41:25.000]  and manipulate the public with the illusion of change and the illusion of a fight going on like
[41:25.000 --> 41:30.920]  w w f wrestling or something with trump and with our populist movement taking over the republicans
[41:30.920 --> 41:35.640]  this is a real populist movement doesn't mean it's perfect and you know it's real because the
[41:35.640 --> 41:41.000]  democrats the power structure the china comms and the entire old republican leadership have all
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.360]  endorsed joe biden that's why i'm supporting trump it's about americanism not globalism it's about
[41:46.360 --> 41:50.600]  ending the one-sided trade deals but defending our borders but defending the right to second
[41:50.600 --> 41:57.000]  amendment and pro-life and trump's doing all of that the new world order is a planetary corporate
[41:57.000 --> 42:05.480]  plan for world government but world government is only the control grid now inner members of the
[42:05.480 --> 42:11.480]  cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality but the price
[42:11.480 --> 42:18.440]  for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based line forms that's why they
[42:18.440 --> 42:25.080]  say carbon is bad they are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet they are playing god
[42:25.080 --> 42:30.920]  they believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them
[42:30.920 --> 42:37.880]  advanced technology to carry out this transformation i know this sounds insane but if you read the
[42:37.880 --> 42:45.160]  writings of the globalist it's all on record you have been warned you have been given the
[42:45.160 --> 42:52.280]  information to say no to this plan this is the end of all life on earth as we know it this is
[42:52.280 --> 42:58.840]  the alien takeover of earth it was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones
[42:58.840 --> 43:04.920]  would track your gps location i read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me
[43:04.920 --> 43:11.000]  because that was unamerican now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are
[43:11.000 --> 43:17.000]  on apple and androids don't just track your location but your surfing history where you go
[43:17.000 --> 43:22.280]  who you talk to your relationships and they all share the data with each other of what you're
[43:22.280 --> 43:28.280]  doing on the apps as well including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just
[43:28.280 --> 43:34.440]  like siri or alexa do and then putting databases transcripts of everything you say into those
[43:34.440 --> 43:39.800]  systems to be saved forever your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance
[43:39.800 --> 43:45.240]  scores based on information this is the global chinese communist social credit score get your
[43:45.240 --> 43:51.480]  protection privacy pockets at info or store dot com and cut big brother off dead in his filthy tracks
[43:51.480 --> 43:53.080]  info or store dot com
[43:53.080 --> 44:11.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[44:11.560 --> 44:29.640]  if i sound like i'm concerned i am i'm also very very exciting humanity is making a good
[44:29.640 --> 44:34.920]  showing as we awaken to battle in the globalist that we've got them back on their heels and we
[44:34.920 --> 44:40.760]  just realize who they are and they're the enemy and just put our head down and politically tear
[44:40.760 --> 44:47.320]  their arms and legs off it's over also have problems to deal with but humanity's got an
[44:47.320 --> 44:51.560]  incredible future ahead of us but we've got to stop these new world order globalists first
[44:51.560 --> 44:56.920]  they're just the scum of the planet now we've got one call from australia i know it's
[44:56.920 --> 45:00.440]  depending on the time over there one two three four in the morning i guess four time zones
[45:01.720 --> 45:06.760]  you got john and adelaide australia to go to him in a moment but since i mentioned this there's
[45:06.760 --> 45:12.360]  literally too many videos of them particularly on the news choking women even wearing masks that's
[45:12.360 --> 45:17.000]  not enough you're not allowed to go outside in some areas during the day and i go why are they
[45:17.000 --> 45:21.320]  choking women in front of cameras when they would never do it to a muslim or do it to a
[45:21.320 --> 45:25.400]  black lives matter thing that they have in melbourne and other cities and allow them
[45:25.400 --> 45:29.080]  because it's about training you that they can do whatever the hell they want
[45:30.440 --> 45:35.160]  and you notice these are leftist officers in leftist departments who are monkey see monkey do
[45:35.160 --> 45:40.760]  order to do this to make other departments behave like this across australia they've been to australia
[45:40.760 --> 45:44.840]  known a lot of australians know folks that live there hard work and nice tough funny people
[45:44.840 --> 45:48.200]  but it was a prisoner colony at first for people that hadn't done anything
[45:49.000 --> 45:52.520]  you know if you couldn't pay your bills 200 something years ago they'd throw you there
[45:52.520 --> 45:56.840]  the united states was set up a lot of us were brought here as prisoners as indentured servants
[45:56.840 --> 46:03.640]  that's over you know good stock but uh so the united states has a lot of similar things in australia
[46:03.640 --> 46:09.000]  while while west they they got their own but they've been a prison colony and the police have
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.720]  got a tight grip on a lot of folks they killed the real crocodile get done deep the guy based off
[46:13.720 --> 46:18.840]  that movie looked just like him just like the guy in the movie they killed him back in the
[46:18.840 --> 46:23.160]  nineties came to his house wouldn't turn in his rifle cops started shooting at him he killed two
[46:23.160 --> 46:28.120]  cops where they killed him so i'm not against police that are dutiful under the constitution
[46:28.120 --> 46:33.320]  and under common law of the west and they're good people on average but evil once control the police
[46:33.320 --> 46:37.640]  and once it gets control which it wants they don't want to abolish them they want control
[46:37.640 --> 46:43.880]  like they got melbourne or in beijing or in madrid i mean the police in madrid i know folks that
[46:43.880 --> 46:49.480]  are there paul watson is in spain his parents live there and uh i mean if you're not wearing a mask
[46:49.480 --> 46:55.320]  in public the police crack you over the head of the billy club well they never got out of fascism
[46:55.320 --> 47:00.360]  franco was with hitler franco never got rid of the fascism spain is not a free country it's a
[47:00.360 --> 47:06.600]  beautiful country i was there took a picture of a church cops come over and they go erase that he
[47:06.600 --> 47:12.760]  was and i said what if i don't he said don't make me hurt you and he was just as a matter of fact
[47:12.760 --> 47:17.880]  about it so see you go under communism and globalism oh you're gonna have the police they're telling you
[47:17.880 --> 47:23.800]  our police are like oh yeah right the globalist or communist country you call the police about
[47:23.800 --> 47:28.360]  family violence or shooting they don't even show up most of the time they're there to collect money
[47:28.360 --> 47:33.080]  off you and that's it so australia ought to be ashamed of itself and i'm gonna say this again
[47:33.080 --> 47:40.040]  before we play this and go to your calls everybody goes oh you really cared about that black woman
[47:40.040 --> 47:45.000]  police wrongfully shot in dc well yeah i don't care what color she is if it's in the wrong it's the
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.520]  wrong or you why do you care about australia so much because it's the new words global government
[47:50.520 --> 47:56.920]  they're the beta test they admit they are this is all coming here trump's trying to block it

[51:32.760 --> 51:37.400]  with this un global government takeover as the head of the un said last week no one must be
[51:37.400 --> 51:42.440]  allowed to protest and no one must be allowed to say no to our vaccines that aren't even approved
[51:44.280 --> 51:49.000]  they're coming everyone i know that was in the military had members of the unit die from vaccines
[51:49.000 --> 51:54.040]  everybody knows this they're coming to attack you violently and these stupid cops don't know

[58:38.120 --> 58:44.280]  from at the moment i can see where we're at around the world and of course my own country and uh
[58:44.280 --> 58:49.960]  there's too many sheep over here mate and they've got to wake up because um we're getting to the
[58:49.960 --> 58:59.000]  gritty end the point in the six that's right describe what it's like describe what you've been under
[58:59.000 --> 59:04.040]  well there's there's a lot of sheep over here there's the the upside of all this crazy stupidity
[59:04.040 --> 59:09.720]  going on it's waking a lot of people up and i'm i'm constantly sharing articles i tune into the show
[59:09.720 --> 59:15.400]  every single day my wife i think is getting tired of me constantly talking about her but
[59:15.400 --> 59:20.440]  she's not the arguing about whether i'm right or wrong is is slowly disappearing as she's starting
[59:20.440 --> 59:25.800]  to think more and more and it's just it's pretty surreal mate that we we have to put up with this
[59:25.800 --> 59:34.040]  sort of craziness that not more people can actually connect the dots and get off the dot and actually
[59:34.040 --> 59:41.080]  do something about it you're absolutely right you know my wife is you know was apolitical
[59:41.080 --> 59:46.040]  and now she saw all this she's totally on board and she's ready to go to war i mean this is really
[59:46.040 --> 59:54.840]  waking people up right now well i can tell you right now um i'm 44 years old and there's no
[59:54.840 --> 1:00:00.360]  hope that he'll i will be taking any goddamn vaccine created by bill and then the gates
[1:00:00.360 --> 1:00:05.880]  when the only the other third bank statistic pieces of garbage they can all go and take
[1:00:05.880 --> 1:00:13.880]  a flying leap um there's no way i mean the upside is i'm talking to people all the time
[1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:23.320]  and you are correct they are really sort of hungry and looking for information and i'm
[1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:28.760]  constantly sharing articles i'm constantly printing articles i'm constantly giving stuff away to
[1:00:28.760 --> 1:00:33.800]  people say hey go and read this go and check that out i'm constantly giving the links to
[1:00:33.800 --> 1:00:40.840]  the to not only your show but mike and all the rest of them and um i'm just hoping i can wake
[1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:46.680]  enough people up quick enough to put the brakes on this stupidity absolutely because people need
[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:51.160]  to understand the compartmentalized police are following orders that still won't get them off
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:57.160]  you know the conviction like the nazis but this is a directed plan so we know the next phases and
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:02.680]  i should create a one sheet with factoids with a bibliography saying first they lock you down
[1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:08.040]  this way next they do that nexus contact tracing nexus an app to move around nexus force inoculations
[1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:13.640]  they admit that's where this leads by next year and and and australia has been chosen
[1:01:14.360 --> 1:01:16.840]  we're gonna go to break i want you to finish up john don't hang on that i promise i'll get
[1:01:16.840 --> 1:01:22.120]  to everybody else 60 second break why has australia been chosen i've never been to australia i've
[1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:26.440]  been invited to go speak there and then i heard they had some restriction on me coming there two
[1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:30.120]  years ago and they blocked a bunch of other people coming saying we're coming to stir up trouble
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:35.160]  and i said to the ossees then i said the fact that they're restricting people coming into your
[1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:40.840]  country or into the uk for their speech shows it'll be you next and now a woman arrested
[1:01:41.400 --> 1:01:45.400]  for posting on facebook that she was going to go to a protest we'll tell you who that lady is on
[1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:46.920]  the other side we're back in 60 seconds
[1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:57.960]  constantly whether it's the new york times the washington post or howard stern of a blue
[1:01:57.960 --> 1:02:03.080]  name and they come out and they attack him full war saying jones claims civil wars coming and
[1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:08.840]  financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses and he tells people they should get off
[1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:14.440]  the grid and get prepared and have horrible food if they can and now everything i've warned people
[1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:20.680]  about is coming true because it was all in the rockfeller foundation documents like lockstep this
[1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:27.400]  is the corporate planetary takeover so yes i stand by what i said 10 years ago what i said a year ago
[1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:32.840]  and what i said last week more than ever get your high quality storeable foods at info or store.com
[1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:38.520]  that's one of the key checkmarks of the check boxes you've got to have checked off info or store.com
[1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:44.680]  and their delivery is now one to two weeks get it before the next big rush comes take action get
[1:02:44.680 --> 1:03:00.600]  the best horrible food at the best price now at info or store.com and it supports the info
[1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:16.280]  oh you can hear it
[1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:19.560]  i'm just getting near now
[1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:29.000]  because you can face it they're coming with a medical ID they're coming with force inoculations
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:34.840]  and they're telling you it doesn't protect you and it makes you sick that means they failed in the
[1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:41.960]  cover-up of what vaccines really are sterilants you know they shot up the black people here
[1:03:41.960 --> 1:03:47.320]  with syphilis and other sterilants the suski experiment you know they shot up the
[1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:52.280]  aborigines in australia it wasn't the ossees that did it it was the medical corps
[1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:56.600]  and compartmentalized groups you know they tried to recruit my dad into that
[1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:00.920]  that's one reason all these years later i knew about this when i was a kid because i was told
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:05.880]  about by my dad and i thought everybody just knew this stuff but see my dad didn't join in with him
[1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:11.160]  he was taught his class in texas in high school already at college and i and i used that story
[1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:15.000]  because that's what this is and there's the stuff that adults know and there's the stuff
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:21.720]  that children think they know so if you just joined us there's all this election news and all this
[1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:26.200]  incredible stuff happening and i'll cover it next hour we have an amazing guest next hour
[1:04:26.200 --> 1:04:32.520]  carlo sapata who was on fire and what did he say he said you keep pushing we will physically take
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:37.400]  you out and that isn't a threat it's a guarantee and you won't stop us you can hear in his very voice
[1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:42.120]  all of it's completely real it's a commitment and it's going to happen so i don't get up here
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:46.360]  and call these cops tyrants and evil and agents of corruption to act tough and to say they're
[1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:53.160]  really cruising for trouble it's it's i'm scared of what i'm gonna do i'm not scared of them
[1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:57.240]  and and again you're like well wait a minute you like the cops now they're the bad guys no no
[1:04:57.240 --> 1:05:02.840]  good constitutional police following the law and going after bad guys are wonderful when they
[1:05:02.840 --> 1:05:08.440]  start telling you that you don't have a right to go out and speak for a made-up overblown virus
[1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:13.080]  that's been proven to be a fraud and they keep people locked down for 10 weeks in their apartment
[1:05:13.080 --> 1:05:17.080]  saying they can't even leave and suicides are off the chart the people are dying of all these
[1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:23.080]  illnesses and the hospitals are closed they tell you they're full it's a fraud all right i'm gonna
[1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:31.160]  stop ranting and go to your calls but it's freedom day valorant sturt street valorant central
[1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:40.360]  vic hosted by zoe lee remember that name she's like the rows of parks of australia peaceful protest
[1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:45.960]  all social distancing will be followed so they even go along with the stuff please wear a mask
[1:05:45.960 --> 1:05:50.040]  unless you have a medical reason not to but in in melbourne they wouldn't let you out with a mask if
[1:05:50.040 --> 1:05:57.000]  you want to arrest them september 5th is freedom day that's three days from now as some of you
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:01.880]  may have seen the government has gone to extreme measures and are using scare tactics through
[1:06:01.880 --> 1:06:07.240]  the media to prevent the melbourne protest here in valorant we can be a voice for those
[1:06:07.800 --> 1:06:12.920]  in stage four lockdowns who came leave their apartment towers we can be seen and heard and
[1:06:12.920 --> 1:06:18.280]  hopefully make a difference this is a woman fighting back against the martial law in lockdowns
[1:06:18.280 --> 1:06:25.000]  stand for human rights we live in a free country meet at the bottom of strut street into bridge
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:29.800]  mall 11 a.m make a sign see you there and they arrested her and seized her computers because
[1:06:29.800 --> 1:06:35.720]  they think ossees are cowards just like i think americans are cowards but we're not this i predict
[1:06:35.720 --> 1:06:40.600]  will make the crowd 10 times bigger and i predict is the tiniest stuff that will bring them down
[1:06:41.720 --> 1:06:46.280]  show the footage as i talk to these callers of the huge rally in london the the rallies and uh
[1:06:47.080 --> 1:06:51.080]  burgland and others this weekend this is incredible in fact in solidarity for this lady
[1:06:51.080 --> 1:06:59.080]  what is the fifth that'll be saturday yeah saturday we're having a rally in austin
[1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:05.000]  i'll figure out a good spot for it we're having one in solidarity we're gonna have the zolee
[1:07:07.960 --> 1:07:13.400]  america's a free country event or we'll call it free australia event i mean because this is all
[1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:17.640]  in solidarity people they're coming after it's all i said i go to your calls we got calls loaded
[1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:22.120]  now from australia having got done with john in adelaide australia finish up your point
[1:07:22.120 --> 1:07:28.120]  why did they pick australia as the un uh base uh i mean they've said to where this is for the
[1:07:28.120 --> 1:07:32.760]  planetary regime they already did china as the example of a lockdown now you're the example
[1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:40.040]  why do you think they did that i think because mate the people tend to believe unfortunately too
[1:07:40.040 --> 1:07:48.440]  much that the mainstream media the tv is their god now that's not always that's not everyone
[1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:53.560]  i've done a lot of reading a lot of research and i'm and i'm more and more so now passing on
[1:07:53.560 --> 1:08:01.080]  information who a few years ago people would laugh at me today they're asking for it so and let's
[1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:06.200]  be clear look at burlina that's like a million people you're a leader they're a leader zoe's
[1:08:06.200 --> 1:08:14.040]  don't you think this lady zoe lee is a leader i admire her mate if i could give her a medal i would
[1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:19.560]  if i could support her i would but with the current craziness climate i'm getting really
[1:08:19.560 --> 1:08:24.680]  strong urges i've had it in the past but even stronger now to go and buy a piece of property
[1:08:24.680 --> 1:08:31.880]  out in the country somewhere and get off the grid the biggest problem we got is here is we are too
[1:08:31.880 --> 1:08:37.880]  apathetic there are too many people who do it's the she'll be right attitude i'm not sure if your
[1:08:37.880 --> 1:08:44.280]  calls are familiar with that that too but the strange callers will be but they don't actually
[1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:50.360]  care until it actually gets to their doorstep and by then it's it's the old sort of adage of it's
[1:08:50.360 --> 1:08:55.880]  it's too late to do anything about it you're absolutely right god bless you sir this is a
[1:08:55.880 --> 1:09:01.000]  crime against humanity this is a nazi level event putting these masks on children suicides are up
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:06.120]  five-fold in australia they're up four-fold here god bless you and thanks for the call okay we got

[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:24.280]  go ahead i'd like to agree with everything that john said and the answer to your question is that
[1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:30.760]  we've been disarmed we can't even buy a pea shooter in this country and haven't been able to for the
[1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:37.320]  past 20 years well brother you're here on air where do you think all this is going i think it's all
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:44.520]  going down here real quick in australia but even worse in new zealand well tell us what you think
[1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:50.600]  should be done about it and what you think the your fellow ossees are gonna do i don't know what we
[1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:57.640]  can do we disarmed we've got a conservative government in government and we've only got a
[1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:04.280]  leftist option in a two-party system well the answer is the people just not complying what
[1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:09.320]  do you predict the arrest of this young mother who was pregnant for the crime of organizing a
[1:10:09.320 --> 1:10:15.640]  demonstration what do you think this will trigger i hope they're all australians will stand up and
[1:10:15.640 --> 1:10:21.240]  stand behind them but because we're all segregated into the four different places
[1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:28.360]  in territories and we can't cross borders this month that's right you're under a form of martial
[1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:35.800]  law so they stop you passing into other states absolutely if we try and go from the new south
[1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:45.960]  miles to victoria they actually have the military on the border god almighty anything else pat no

[1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:18.280]  line let's go ahead and talk to mason in bristol queensland or brisman queensland thanks for calling
[1:11:19.400 --> 1:11:25.080]  hey elix it's nathan um it's really good to speak to you and um i'm actually american
[1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:31.000]  citizens as well so i can relate to you very well and to be honest i'm not like all about
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:35.800]  trump but i feel like trump is somewhat the lighthouse for everybody in this world currently
[1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:40.760]  at this current moment and i've been watching what trump's been doing since he was elected into the
[1:11:40.760 --> 1:11:47.480]  presidency as i'm sure you have as well um i live in queensland which i'm kind of away from
[1:11:48.040 --> 1:11:52.760]  melbourne but i've got friends in melbourne and i feel like to be honest right now what's happening
[1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:57.880]  is everybody's too afraid to do anything because of that whole martial law situation
[1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:02.120]  everyone's locked out of every state pretty much no one can move anywhere else other than the state
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:09.160]  they're in um but i think that a lot of businesses are really becoming uh ended with this whole
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:12.040]  situation they just don't want to deal with it anymore and i feel like a lot of businesses
[1:12:12.040 --> 1:12:15.800]  are going to stand up against this so that's going to create an issue with the government and i feel
[1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:19.480]  like at some point they're going to be a fight between the people i don't know what kind of
[1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:23.800]  fight that'll be but that's what i think will happen nathan in brisman queensland don't hang
[1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:28.120]  up i'm gonna come right back to you to talk about the sense of the public what they're thinking
[1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:34.600]  what you make of this great lady zoe lee being arrested after facebook reported her for thought
[1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:41.880]  crime it's all coming up and then jim in queensland australia roger in washington from australia

[1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:57.640]  attention to anyone that still wants to live in a free country the new world order chi com global
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:03.720]  a syndicate is making its move to implode the dollar and thrust the united states into a civil war
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:09.240]  by contesting the election they are openly wargaming this at the highest levels of democratic party
[1:13:09.240 --> 1:13:13.720]  nancy polosi and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election
[1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:19.720]  prep is going they will hold a separate inauguration for biden and kamala harris and that anyone
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:24.280]  challenging that will be called a racist they will then trigger race riots and violence they've
[1:13:24.280 --> 1:13:30.600]  already beta tested around the country we are not living in normal times when these types of things
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:35.240]  happen in history people are usually caught flat footed because they can't believe they're living
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:41.080]  in such a criminal era we are we are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:46.280]  that's been feeding on america is being exposed and removed now is the time for all good men and
[1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:51.880]  women to come to their aid of the country spread the word now paul reveres this is a maximum alert
[1:13:51.880 --> 1:13:58.120]  a maximum alert as of taping this alert you're 82 days out from the election as many of you know
[1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:02.680]  in the last year i've pointed out statements out of the council on foreign relations and other
[1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:08.520]  globalist organs that they know trump is going to win in a landslide so their strategy will be
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:15.160]  to contest the election if they fail to successfully steal it then they are openly now wargaming this
[1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:20.920]  is in the new york times having democrat states and cities secede from the union just like they've
[1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:26.200]  ignored trump's policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down that is nothing but a
[1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:31.160]  dress rehearsal they are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration not in dc
[1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:38.280]  they said in another city colostia said this when they crown biden and kamala harris ladies and
[1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:44.920]  gentlemen this is the organized civil war this is their public criminal plan we should be praying
[1:14:44.920 --> 1:14:48.840]  we should be spreading the word we should be demanding triple on the office to expose this
[1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:56.040]  criminal activity you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:11.880]  i've got a tiger by the tail that's way to see i won't be much when you get through with me
[1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:21.000]  he never gives up he's alex jones broadcasting from deep in the heart of texas worldwide
[1:15:22.280 --> 1:15:27.000]  and we're taking calls from australia where the un is in control and it's expanded
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:32.120]  martial law with the military on the state borders major cities a shutdown where you can
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:38.280]  even leave your house or your condo uh total collapse the economy mothers that plan demonstrations
[1:15:38.280 --> 1:15:43.160]  against it being arrested for inciting basically terrorism at their homes we showed the footage
[1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:48.920]  earlier we're taking calls right now nathan what is the sense in australia uh i mean do the people
[1:15:48.920 --> 1:15:53.240]  know that the covet numbers have barely killed how many have died in australia even with inflated
[1:15:53.240 --> 1:15:58.040]  numbers they now admit here that almost no one's died of that it's been a big hoax to shut down
[1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:02.360]  the world economy and now they want to use australia as an example to scare the rest of the world
[1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:10.200]  into martial law um alex i feel like the people they they probably understand to a degree but i
[1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:14.200]  don't think that a lot of people really are researching for themselves and i think that's
[1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:19.640]  just the trait of the australian in general um i don't i don't know if that's going to be the
[1:16:19.640 --> 1:16:23.880]  case forever though because i feel like at this current moment people are starting to wake up
[1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:28.280]  and like the previous callers were saying that other states are seeing things happen in other
[1:16:28.280 --> 1:16:32.680]  states and then they're kind of questioning what's going on and it doesn't fit right with people so
[1:16:32.680 --> 1:16:36.600]  like at some point there's going to be some sort of rejection how they're going to do that i don't
[1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:41.160]  know but what's going on with melbourne why are they doing the most draconian stuff in melbourne
[1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:47.000]  um personally my personal opinion is because there's a lot more immigrants into melbourne
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:51.800]  and that's easier to control because it brought a lot of immigrants into that state
[1:16:51.800 --> 1:16:59.080]  that's right they always do the draconian controls on a group that's doesn't have as many rights but
[1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:03.480]  then it's always exported to everybody else yeah well they don't know their rights as well as an
[1:17:03.480 --> 1:17:06.840]  australian does but at the same time we don't really know how to write the world a lot of people
[1:17:06.840 --> 1:17:12.040]  don't stand up for the rights anyway if they do very well said points nathan um how long do you
[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:18.040]  think we'll put up with the lockdown they're talking about a lockdown forever now i don't i don't
[1:17:18.040 --> 1:17:22.280]  think we can keep a human being down like that especially if they've had freedom um it's different
[1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:26.120]  when they're in from you know places like north korea but i feel like there's going to be a point
[1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:30.280]  where people fight back i don't know how long that'll be but it'll happen all right that's what i
[1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:35.400]  think anyway that's my opinion do you know off the top of your head i mean i saw the numbers it's
[1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:41.640]  like minuscule that have died in australia from covet 19 it's less than one percent i've done the
[1:17:41.640 --> 1:17:46.760]  maximum majority and that's that's like that's a really high number i mean the actual numbers it
[1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:50.760]  was like i'd see articles like in one city 10 deaths and then we know most that's made up and
[1:17:50.760 --> 1:17:55.320]  just what's into the world for something not even as bad as the flu very very scary world thank you
[1:17:55.320 --> 1:18:02.200]  so much all right let's go ahead and go to jim in queensland australia talking about store harassment
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:10.920]  and sar covid tracing go ahead hey alex uh we're uh dual citizens my father was an american and my
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:17.160]  mom's australian and we live in uh sunshine coast which is north in queensland north of where the
[1:18:17.160 --> 1:18:22.520]  previous caller in brisbane called from uh and this is what's important because this doesn't get out
[1:18:22.520 --> 1:18:28.440]  in our news okay and i hope the people in australia that listen to your show a lot do uh we'll hear
[1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:35.400]  this okay my sister was a member of our local council and that's like your uh your city councilman
[1:18:35.400 --> 1:18:41.880]  same thing but they have more power in australia and britain the british system my sister was in
[1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:48.760]  doing her shopping and her mask wasn't on and she's this you know she's an advocate for standing up
[1:18:48.760 --> 1:18:55.960]  against the hoax you know similar thing to like what you do and she was snatched out of the store
[1:18:55.960 --> 1:18:59.800]  and now before i say this i'm gonna tell you where she was taken because i want the people to hear
[1:18:59.800 --> 1:19:07.640]  that she was taken to camber barracks in western australia she was snatched out of the store by the
[1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:15.640]  australian sas they are doing the same things now at least in queensland that the british sas
[1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:23.320]  did in northern ireland with the ira anybody that is in a local council that is against the
[1:19:23.320 --> 1:19:30.520]  vaccination the mandatory lockdown the and they're called the sas regiment they're taking the
[1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:36.760]  camber barracks my sister was held there for three weeks and then just recently released and the
[1:19:36.760 --> 1:19:43.160]  family's all going to america now she's scared the sas snatched her just like they the british guys
[1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:47.960]  did to the irish men indoors well let's explain special air services was also caught staging
[1:19:47.960 --> 1:19:53.640]  bombings and blaming it on the ira and leading the ira i had steak knife on right about month
[1:19:53.640 --> 1:19:57.080]  before they murdered him i didn't realize how big a guess it was when i had him on he was a former
[1:19:57.080 --> 1:20:02.280]  british high-level opium commando but for those that don't know this is all you in this is the
[1:20:02.280 --> 1:20:07.640]  globalist taking back control of australia this isn't even your government and of course she wasn't
[1:20:07.640 --> 1:20:12.760]  grabbed for not wearing a mask she was grabbed because she's been a leader and been critical of
[1:20:12.760 --> 1:20:17.320]  them just like they grabbed this woman that was organizing a demonstration in melbourne they're
[1:20:17.320 --> 1:20:23.640]  they're going after the leaders this is criminal joseph mingala nazi-level stuff and and shame on
[1:20:23.640 --> 1:20:29.480]  the australian leadership but this has never happened before in australia where they they
[1:20:29.480 --> 1:20:36.760]  used the sas against australian now that the police special branches yes they've gotten like
[1:20:36.760 --> 1:20:43.800]  aboriginal leaders that were advocating terrorism or stuff like that but this is the very first time
[1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:52.600]  it is inconceivable in the state that you know like a marine recon unit or the army green berets
[1:20:52.600 --> 1:20:58.840]  would would go and kidnap citizens and take them for interrogation sir i want to get your name and
[1:20:58.840 --> 1:21:03.000]  number and info and i know your sister's probably scared but the minute she goes public with her
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:07.400]  name and info this will be international and and and they're going to be in a lot of trouble
[1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:10.920]  there i guess they tried to intimidate her and just scare her to shut up i mean how did they
[1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:16.440]  what did they do when she was in captivity well we haven't had a chance to talk to her yet she's
[1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:22.200]  still in transit but uh from what we've heard from my brother-in-law the first thing they did is
[1:21:22.200 --> 1:21:29.400]  they isolated her as if she was a criminal for two days then they put all and i guess there's uh
[1:21:29.400 --> 1:21:35.160]  council members from all over australia that they're taking them to campbell barracks that's in western
[1:21:35.160 --> 1:21:40.920]  australia and that's where the essay the sas are they call them in australia sir i can tell you're
[1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:44.520]  totally credible but but i mean tell she's a public figure then tell us the name of the town
[1:21:44.520 --> 1:21:53.000]  and tell us her name um it is sunshine coast and i'd rather not give her name everybody in
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:58.840]  sunshine coast knows who it is because you know she's the popular rabble rouser yeah so the military
[1:21:58.840 --> 1:22:03.800]  is kidnapping australian citizens to silence them i mean this is one step away from death camps
[1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:09.320]  yes exactly and she's not the only one she said there were people from all over australia and
[1:22:09.320 --> 1:22:16.840]  like you said from south australia melbourne area especially the sas had all of these council members
[1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:22.440]  from all the different little towns primarily from south australia which is where melbourne is
[1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:26.600]  which is where all of this so they're well why do you why do you think they released her
[1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:31.240]  you think they broke her i mean because i heard she wants to leave now is what you heard well we're
[1:22:31.240 --> 1:22:37.640]  dual citizens okay so my brother again i haven't talked to them but there's a strong possibility
[1:22:37.640 --> 1:22:45.320]  that the american embassy in canberra contacted uh the ministry of oh so that's the only reason she
[1:22:45.320 --> 1:22:51.880]  got out oh my god god almighty so even our own country our state department knows about this alec
[1:22:54.040 --> 1:22:59.480]  well sir this is a martial law drill they admit and they say you will be arrested if you don't
[1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:03.960]  take the vaccines starting next year in the democrats win and it's going to be i mean this is it the
[1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:07.880]  sound they start and then like when they come for the conservatives and patriots and they oh
[1:23:07.880 --> 1:23:11.960]  we're not coming for you as your conservative the computer showed you have covid see how the fraud
[1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:19.720]  works absolutely and my sister was a vocal opponent as were as were all of these other council

[1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:54.120]  of all these comebacks so great job you built what we've done i salute you're listening to the alex
[1:26:54.120 --> 1:27:09.320]  jones show all right folks we're back the last caller sounded very credible my bs detector was
[1:27:09.320 --> 1:27:14.280]  at zero and i've already seen them arresting women and beating up women and arresting people for
[1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:19.640]  leaving their houses after eight nine weeks of level four lockdown and they've had 1400 deaths in
[1:27:19.640 --> 1:27:24.280]  australia most of them died of other things show to put that in perspective they've had probably
[1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:29.160]  10 times the deaths from honorable accidents of them a covet 19 this this is a total power grab
[1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:34.200]  it's all admitted and the more you submit the worse it gets you're not a hero wearing a mask
[1:27:34.200 --> 1:27:39.640]  you're not a hero going along with it you are riding your own destruction now we got other
[1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:45.080]  huge news breaking i told you this was coming there's a new video it's on info wars dot com
[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:50.840]  bill and hillary warn biden do not concede under any circumstance drag it out contest it
[1:27:51.880 --> 1:27:55.480]  same thing they've been saying now it's official more of that coming up next hour
[1:27:56.680 --> 1:28:02.680]  when carlo sapata an amazingly well-spoken veteran joins us who laid out the fact that
[1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:07.640]  it war is coming to these tyrants don't back down let's go to these callers in australia we've got
[1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:14.360]  adam grant and roger and again i love how we have an audience i can say i want to call from israel
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:19.480]  i want calls from russia i want calls from canada calls from mexico and we'll get good calls so i'm
[1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:22.920]  very very honored you're calling in very very honored you're there listening as this shows
[1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:26.920]  how huge info wars is thanks to our listeners spread the word across the world this is so
[1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:30.680]  important to be here now so they don't have information dominance and control
[1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:36.920]  because martin twain said a lie goes halfway around the world before truth puts its pants on
[1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:42.920]  but once the truth puts its pants on it wins the race i added that last part kind of jazzing
[1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:47.080]  out there improving on what he said uh one of the callers just hung up or maybe they're coming
[1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:52.280]  back to see what happens roger's in washington from australia then adam and melbourne roger what
[1:28:52.280 --> 1:28:58.440]  are the hell's going on in australia there are the alex long-time listener first-time caller
[1:28:58.440 --> 1:29:05.400]  australian by birth but american by the grace of god first and i've been watching this happen
[1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:12.120]  around us and compare the differences between australia and america pretty much where the same
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:19.480]  people the difference is america's backed by the greatest constitution in the world known to mankind
[1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:27.960]  period and the thing is australia doesn't have that and they've been de-armed the population
[1:29:27.960 --> 1:29:34.600]  has then what's happened on top of that the media is in complete overdrive pushing this narrative
[1:29:36.040 --> 1:29:48.040]  about the covid about the blm the vaccinations and all about that go with it and pretty much
[1:29:48.040 --> 1:29:52.440]  australians are buying the whole hook wire and sinker except for the few and the few that do with
[1:29:52.440 --> 1:29:59.160]  this like your um previous caller said they're probably taken away today to re-education camp
[1:30:00.040 --> 1:30:05.880]  um i don't know what happened to that lady that was there from the sunshine coast but if she's a
[1:30:05.880 --> 1:30:11.480]  dual citizen i'd be returning back to america because i believe a quickening is happening
[1:30:11.480 --> 1:30:17.880]  around us right now alex that's squalable and people need to get right with god people need
[1:30:17.880 --> 1:30:23.640]  to get right with people that are like-minded and we we start pushing back on what's happening
[1:30:23.640 --> 1:30:28.280]  no i agree more than guns more than water more than food that's all important we need friendship
[1:30:28.280 --> 1:30:32.920]  and like-minded people the brethren that is what that we need to have we can do anything together
[1:30:32.920 --> 1:30:38.920]  we need that moral support they want to isolate us they want us alone and and you're you're right
[1:30:38.920 --> 1:30:46.840]  about that you know this um george floyd incident it was time too perfect to create a smokescreen
[1:30:46.840 --> 1:30:53.000]  on top of this covid i i don't believe that i don't know whether mk ultra or some sort of
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:58.440]  mine control was put in but that licked the match around the world and all western countries
[1:30:59.800 --> 1:31:09.240]  the australia the uk america they all go into this narrative where um you know
[1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:14.920]  keep all people's lives matter but it created the largest division amongst the masses
[1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:23.880]  and that just seems to perfectly time that we're dealing with one one one lie and now we're
[1:31:23.880 --> 1:31:27.880]  absolutely and remember they took most of the guns in australia 20 years ago and now we knew
[1:31:27.880 --> 1:31:33.880]  it would come it's the same model and it's an island sparsely populated and so they're beta
[1:31:33.880 --> 1:31:38.520]  testing just like they're doing in hawaii and admitting it's coming here that's why we've
[1:31:38.520 --> 1:31:43.720]  got to resist we've got to say no because the agenda gets worse they don't let the news off our neck
[1:31:43.720 --> 1:31:50.840]  when we don't struggle they tighten it rogers go ahead roger what what happened in australia 28
[1:31:50.840 --> 1:31:56.520]  years ago there was a mass shooting in tasmania in port arpa and that's where the where australia's
[1:31:56.520 --> 1:32:01.560]  gun lords changed forever that story was total that was total mine control as well very suspicious
[1:32:02.200 --> 1:32:07.800]  i can't believe an autistic person could handle a rifle that well where he could shoot a barrier
[1:32:07.800 --> 1:32:13.880]  triple into a car which is two for the windscreen one through the radiator and then do that for people
[1:32:13.880 --> 1:32:18.840]  i find that very hard to believe now it was obviously special operations units and then they
[1:32:18.840 --> 1:32:22.840]  pick a merely retarded person because they can't defend themselves exactly god bless you sir i
[1:32:22.840 --> 1:32:27.240]  appreciate your call call me back again amazing calls adam in melbourne australia you're on the
[1:32:27.240 --> 1:32:32.280]  year go ahead hey going um some for mobilness just thought you might want a melbourne view on
[1:32:32.280 --> 1:32:36.360]  everything that's going on at the moment please sir um basically what the other basically what
[1:32:36.360 --> 1:32:40.920]  all the other call of the thing is basically true everyone here has so much faith i'm in the mainstream
[1:32:40.920 --> 1:32:45.720]  media the politicians um and the police and i don't really question anything for themselves more
[1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:51.160]  like whatever they see they believe um and i think that's obviously like a major concern and a problem
[1:32:51.160 --> 1:32:57.640]  here um and i think people are starting to kind of work out what's going on but i think we're
[1:32:57.640 --> 1:33:05.800]  still a long way away um for making a big difference why do you think australia is the new beta test
[1:33:05.800 --> 1:33:10.200]  because it's so controlled by china or what's going on the china was the beta test to scare us
[1:33:10.200 --> 1:33:15.080]  all now they're using australia as the new image to scare us here showing us images saying we need
[1:33:15.080 --> 1:33:20.200]  to never leave our houses we need to wear masks inside our houses you know we need to you know go
[1:33:20.200 --> 1:33:28.600]  under human control why do you think australia was chosen in a way a bit of a rebellious country
[1:33:28.600 --> 1:33:33.720]  where um we don't always follow um you know what what we're told so i think it was kind of a good
[1:33:33.720 --> 1:33:38.040]  testing ground to see how we would react um to everything um if we would abide with what they
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:42.760]  say um that's probably a good starting point for what it chose us in my view
[1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:49.960]  well they're talking about never ending the lockdown and forced inoculations and tracker
[1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:54.120]  tracing i mean i wonder will the aussies just be a closed country from now on and never leave their
[1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:58.520]  houses and all just starve to death because the economy is already breaking down worldwide what's
[1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:05.560]  the economy like in australia oh we just announced that we're in um a largest recession um uh you
[1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:10.680]  said i've got an ounce so the economy definitely isn't doing well here um contact tracing that's
[1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:15.720]  already started i think it's definitely going to be rolled out further um i think people are going
[1:34:15.720 --> 1:34:22.840]  to start realizing what's going on and i think once it gets um you know to a point beyond uh
[1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:26.600]  you know where people are happy with that's when they'll start um you know i think and talking up
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:31.160]  but until then um i just hope that more people can really come to the census and find out what
[1:34:31.160 --> 1:34:34.520]  you know what's actually happening here absolutely adam god bless you i appreciate
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:38.440]  your calling from australia all right we got eight nine calls from australia a few had to
[1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:42.920]  hang up i'm sorry i didn't get to you um if you can still get in from australia eight seven seven
[1:34:42.920 --> 1:34:46.840]  seven eight nine two five three nine i know it's on average like four in the morning over there
[1:34:46.840 --> 1:34:51.960]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine dollar your country access code five one two
[1:34:51.960 --> 1:35:00.040]  six four six seventeen seventy six but i've got a lot of other news other areas to cover but why
[1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:07.800]  did i leave with australia for an hour and 40 minutes so far because folks this is the un the
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:12.280]  un says america should turn its guns in the un said australia should turn its guns in the
[1:35:12.280 --> 1:35:16.760]  un says switzerland israel should turn their guns in now they're starting to turn their guns in
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:21.000]  and now the un says our police are bad they're going to control them meanwhile nancy polosi
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:26.040]  is running around getting her hair done lightfoot's getting her hair done and she says well i'm a
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:31.400]  public figure i'm important i get my hair done you don't get your hair done so they're just bringing
[1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:36.760]  back the class system where the new royalty is the bureaucrats and the liberals and the democrats
[1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:42.680]  and you've got boris johnson in in the uk and you've got the australian leader as well so-called
[1:35:42.680 --> 1:35:48.040]  conservatives going along with this but they catch boris johnson out at places without his mask
[1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:53.160]  and polosi and all of because it's a fraud boris johnson didn't have coven 19 he needs to get sick
[1:35:54.040 --> 1:36:03.480]  all pr stunts is disgusting and it is the main globalist power move it's that simple we're going
[1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:08.680]  to come back i see the phone lines loading up set more calls from australia we'll find out but
[1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:13.880]  you just joined us the articles on info wars dot com a pregnant woman of two who organized a
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:19.560]  demonstration in melbourne coming up this saturday she even said social distance where your mask
[1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:23.800]  blm's allowed to march the islamists are allowed to march everybody else is allowed to march they
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:29.240]  say they should but not people against coven itself not people they're saying it's overblown
[1:36:29.240 --> 1:36:33.160]  not people saying it's a power grab the perfect way to shut down speech and they're even saying
[1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:38.760]  trump should have the rnc but democrats can have all their events they can have the mtv music awards
[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:45.960]  it's all monkey see monkey do cult programming what orders will you follow what will you submit to
[1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:53.400]  i will submit to nothing it was a sleeper product it wasn't popular at first but as people tried
[1:36:53.400 --> 1:36:58.920]  it it's become one of our top five best sellers i'm talking about the eight pack power stack 13
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:04.120]  different pills filled with super nutrients vitamins minerals and more that you take in

[1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:51.400]  free shipping biggest deal on this ever going back more than 20 years ago i coined the term the
[1:37:51.400 --> 1:37:57.800]  false left right paradigm from reading the books by carol quickly speaking brazilian others how they
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:06.920]  described powerful institutions and foundations successful takeover of the left parties and
[1:38:06.920 --> 1:38:10.840]  right parties in europe and the united states it didn't mean that those parties didn't have
[1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:15.800]  differences before they were able to get control the leadership of both and manipulate the public
[1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:21.080]  with the illusion of change and the illusion of a fight going on like w w f wrestling or something
[1:38:21.640 --> 1:38:27.320]  with trump and with our populist movement taking over the republicans this is a real populist movement
[1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:31.560]  doesn't mean it's perfect and you know it's real because the democrats the power structure the
[1:38:31.560 --> 1:38:37.400]  chai comms and the entire old republican leadership have all endorsed joe biden that's why i'm
[1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:42.600]  supporting trump it's about americanism not globalism it's about ending the one-sided trade deals
[1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:47.080]  for defending our borders for defending the right to second amendment and pro-life and trump's doing
[1:38:47.080 --> 1:39:00.200]  all of that you hear that that's the march of the united nations and the bill of malin the gage
[1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:06.760]  foundation coming with their battle plan psychological warfare operation with the forced
[1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:12.920]  inoculations and the permanent lockdown of civilization and society they're outlawing
[1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:18.360]  people being able to get colds or the flu they're creating artificial phobias for normal death that
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:24.200]  takes place they're not even promising to have a cure to it all they're just inflicting new phobias
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:30.360]  on everyone to bring in their planetary regime directed by the w ho with vaccines that actually

[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:19.720]  worldwide world government takeover on record that it's never going to end the united nations has

[1:45:23.560 --> 1:45:27.480]  in america they're good people and they think everybody's like them and they project their
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:32.440]  niceness onto people i mean you think that's the problem well they just believe everyone believes
[1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:37.720]  mainstream media i i can't even take um i can't even take tank water to my family and have them
[1:45:37.720 --> 1:45:43.960]  drink it they prefer to drink buddy the water out of the tap is full of fluoride i give them uh

[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:53.880]  brother i think australia is ahead of us in some ways but behind us and others and i and
[1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:58.120]  ossees always calling her awake or mad about it i get it 10 years ago nobody cared about
[1:45:58.120 --> 1:46:01.960]  fluoride in the water now everybody does i think you guys are behind us because you've had a little
[1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:07.640]  bit better than we had in some ways uh things have gotten crazy here and so i know they're crazy
[1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:11.800]  there too but i don't be mad at people they're gonna wake up later they're gonna laugh today
[1:46:11.800 --> 1:46:17.240]  they're gonna cry later what really matters is we we wake enough up that before it's too far gone
[1:46:17.240 --> 1:46:22.040]  we can win and and and then my friend you'll be celebrated not that that's a good thing but
[1:46:22.040 --> 1:46:29.080]  you know it's it's just a fact god bless you what did mark twain say in the beginning a patriot is
[1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:36.760]  a scarce man hated feared and scorned but later what has caused succeeds the timid joined him
[1:46:36.760 --> 1:46:42.440]  because then it cost nothing to be a patriot think about that quote in the beginning a patriot is a
[1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:54.680]  scarce man hated feared and scorned but in the end when his cause succeeds timid joined him
[1:46:56.200 --> 1:47:01.000]  because then it costs nothing to be a patriot and we're not mad at the lemmings they're
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:05.800]  followers there might be one leader out of 50 people if you're lucky
[1:47:07.800 --> 1:47:11.880]  and a lot of people in join evil once they're a leader they go you know i'm a leader
[1:47:11.880 --> 1:47:17.640]  and the system comes you and says hey you're a leader join us and most people go i will join you
[1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:23.960]  another call in australia then i'm going to hit all this news that was special guest joining us
[1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:28.120]  there's so much breaking linden in australia thanks for holding where you're calling from in australia
[1:47:29.560 --> 1:47:38.920]  today i'm in melbourne i'm in the outer suburbs and i'm just basically disgusted with our government
[1:47:38.920 --> 1:47:44.760]  at the moment i can't believe what they're doing we're living under martial law basically
[1:47:46.360 --> 1:47:53.320]  we're in a curfew you can't go out after eight p.m you can't get up before five a.m
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  my girls have to carry work papers and go through roadblocks manned by the military
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:11.080]  with their soviet style papers to just to go to work and that's they're lucky enough to work in a
[1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:16.040]  food industry that actually gets to go to work a lot of people just don't even
[1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:25.560]  have jobs at the moment and it's let me ask you this sir what is it like to be under this and to
[1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:31.080]  know that it's all based on a pretty much a hoax i mean an overblown 90 plus percent
[1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:36.120]  overblown situation i mean do ossees know how overblown it is i mean you've had 1400 people
[1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:40.360]  died from this and most of those died from something else and it's the un directing it
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:50.600]  well i i think most people are just basically have no idea because our media is like every channel
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:49:03.000]  is cnn our national broadcaster abc is totally left-wing cnn style and every commercial channel
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:14.360]  we only have the abc and three major channels and they're all 24 seven bashing this covid
[1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:21.640]  um narrative into everyone and everyone believes it because there's not there's not a lot of
[1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:27.480]  alternative media well that's it so it's a total cult of information which is so dangerous wow
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:31.160]  that's that's and that's why they want to shut in fours now there's not much independent media
[1:49:31.160 --> 1:49:39.560]  left here in the us either yeah and some most people just australia if they knew they would wake
[1:49:39.560 --> 1:49:48.120]  up instantly but it's just the the narrative is just so controlled by the mainstream media and we
[1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:55.560]  don't have like i don't think many people are listening to info wars because it's four a.m in
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:50:03.960]  the morning i'm a long time fan and i'm i just want to say thank you alex you were you're a
[1:50:03.960 --> 1:50:09.720]  modern day saint you're a john the baptist well listen brother you are too we're all just not
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:13.880]  wanting to get taken over and once the economy implodes they call it the global reset they want
[1:50:13.880 --> 1:50:17.640]  to make you all poor make me poor to control us so i'm just trying to survive god bless you brother
[1:50:17.640 --> 1:50:21.960]  we appreciate you speaking of this i haven't really plugged the last two hours and if i don't we won't
[1:50:21.960 --> 1:50:26.520]  be here because we're barely bringing enough money to operate i'd love to expand i'd love to launch
[1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:30.680]  a bunch of other operations and like operation hydra i was talking about my crew this morning
[1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:36.120]  about trying to inspire folks but go to info wars store dot com especially if you live in the u.s
[1:50:36.120 --> 1:50:41.480]  or canada where we can ship stuff to you easy and and and take advantage and get books and films
[1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:46.200]  and water filter and air filter and really high quality storeable food everybody needs storeable
[1:50:46.200 --> 1:50:50.360]  food we can ship it in one to two weeks the other places don't even have food the food prices are
[1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:54.920]  going up the food distribution systems are breaking down and and and this is insurance you can eat
[1:50:54.920 --> 1:50:59.400]  it's high quality food and some of it tastes okay some of it tastes gourmet compared to the leading
[1:50:59.400 --> 1:51:04.200]  competitors it's amazing so i went out and found you the best product i could it's how we fund
[1:51:04.200 --> 1:51:09.320]  ourselves and i believe if you don't have a three month six month year supply you're crazy and you
[1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:14.520]  need water filters we have the highest rated systems both pro pure and and elixir pure uh that you
[1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:19.640]  can get water out of a swamp 10 000 20 000 gallons depending on the unit these are basic things you
[1:51:19.640 --> 1:51:25.720]  need i'm selling them it's how we stay on air uh but uh just a crazy crazy time folks and thanks
[1:51:25.720 --> 1:51:29.800]  my blood boil watch them do this these women particularly but these aren't australians these
[1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:33.800]  are globalist venues just like here in the u.s they'll be back with hour number three with a very
[1:51:33.800 --> 1:51:40.680]  special guest you'll want to stay with us this isn't about me taking credit in fact it's the
[1:51:40.680 --> 1:51:46.280]  opposite it's about getting you to understand that you have all the power going back three weeks ago
[1:51:46.280 --> 1:51:52.120]  they had the entire austin green belt shut down and they had the spillway by martin springs
[1:51:52.120 --> 1:51:58.200]  shut down as well as the main pool that's always been paying for the last 50 years or so it's a
[1:51:58.200 --> 1:52:05.560]  damned up spring well we went down there and we got in the park at different areas around town
[1:52:05.560 --> 1:52:10.680]  in the last few weeks and educated people that it was all a giant fraud and now despite the
[1:52:10.680 --> 1:52:15.480]  effects they still say the parks are closed you get out to any area you'll see dozens if not
[1:52:15.480 --> 1:52:19.960]  hundreds of people depending where you're at actually using barton springs here in austin texas
[1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:25.720]  so bill gates and the globalists give the orders to the u.n the u.n gives the orders down through
[1:52:25.720 --> 1:52:30.920]  the national health services like our nih and we all follow it like beautiful slaves stop
[1:52:30.920 --> 1:52:37.080]  complying with your own enslavement stop following the orders of these globalist traders start being
[1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:54.040]  free again the answer to 1984 is 1776
[1:52:54.040 --> 1:52:59.080]  info wars has been banned arrested
[1:52:59.080 --> 1:53:10.280]  attacked and threatened because we are effective the great awakening is here
[1:53:10.280 --> 1:53:20.920]  go to banned dot video download the videos and share support the information war at infowarstore.com
[1:53:20.920 --> 1:53:29.720]  and never give up the fight
[1:53:35.320 --> 1:53:37.720]  info wars dot com
[1:53:37.720 --> 1:53:48.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:56.200 --> 1:53:58.920]  our on alex jones here back live carlos sapata
[1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:04.520]  who spoke a few weeks ago he got a california city council he got real
[1:54:04.520 --> 1:54:09.160]  well and a lot of great attention is what he said was all dead on said better than i could say it
[1:54:09.160 --> 1:54:15.480]  he'll be joining us coming up i just spent two hours on australia because the u.n is in control
[1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:23.000]  of national policy of every country but a few the u.s was under their policy at the w.h.o.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:32.040]  entered unesco trumps pulled out of both pulled out of unesco three years ago because when you
[1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:36.440]  signed on to that tree the u.n is in control of your immigration policy i was bringing us refugees
[1:54:36.440 --> 1:54:43.720]  that were 80 plus percent islamic age you know a military man and so trump pulled us out of that
[1:54:43.720 --> 1:54:48.360]  and then a few months ago as you know he pulled us out of the w.h.o. this is the real deal folks
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:55.880]  and then the the w.h.o. has come out and criticized us owning guns and said we're racist and our
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:55:01.240]  police are bad when there are some bad cops good fry them when they're bad but i mean statistically
[1:55:01.240 --> 1:55:05.880]  if you're a black man getting shot by cops is like about 14 black men are killed wrongly a year by
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:11.320]  cops even with mainline numbers i mean but every time it happens it's like burn all these cities
[1:55:11.320 --> 1:55:16.680]  and try to destabilize the country as connie west came out and said 22 plus million black people
[1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:23.640]  have been killed that clip's coming up in fact let's just do this let's air the clinton's came
[1:55:23.640 --> 1:55:28.120]  out again now with bill and said contest the election no matter what even though they admit
[1:55:28.120 --> 1:55:31.880]  trump's gonna win in the poll numbers they're still gonna contest it with their mail-in ballots
[1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:38.840]  and then play the clip of connie uh he came out and said black lives matter's fake if you cared
[1:55:38.840 --> 1:55:44.200]  about black lives you care about abortion passed by margaret sanger to kill black people on record
[1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:51.160]  so here's both those clips and i i said my advice to joe biden and i've told the campaign this
[1:55:51.160 --> 1:55:59.080]  obviously is do not concede under any circumstances because i believe the other side is going to
[1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:08.360]  cheat and and sneak and he says if he loses he's not going to leave if he loses and so we're
[1:56:08.360 --> 1:56:13.240]  you know we're going to be resolved and we're going to be strong and we're going to be you know
[1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:17.480]  on that front line and uh we're going to get our country back that's our plan
[1:56:17.480 --> 1:56:22.680]  and we're going to go because it was a hit possible place a second we're going to get our
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:28.680]  country back that's the plan the no borders no walls no usa at all america sucks globalism
[1:56:28.680 --> 1:56:33.720]  sell us out to common to china have hollywood demoralizes have horrible policies for the
[1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:38.280]  military has record suicides all of this promote pedophilia and she's like we're going to get our
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:44.120]  country back smiling like a little goblin demon with bill the pervert pedophile in the background
[1:56:44.120 --> 1:56:52.200]  here it is it's cognac to the war so because it was a setup right now okay so let us get to
[1:56:52.200 --> 1:57:03.880]  let's get to life um in 50 years there's 20 there's been 22 million over 22 million 500 000
[1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:14.200]  million black people aborted strategically and on purpose plan parenthood was set up and placed
[1:57:14.200 --> 1:57:24.360]  in minority communities to kill black people you're talking about uh when margaret sanger
[1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:29.800]  the originator of plan parent in the time because a lot of people when when you say things like that
[1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:35.240]  to in their defense they say well plan parenthood today is a different organization but the but
[1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:41.480]  what you do here we go but what you cannot deny is these facts that you're about to give you right
[1:57:41.480 --> 1:57:47.960]  now here we go margaret sanger the founder of plan parenthood was an avowed racist whose goal
[1:57:47.960 --> 1:57:54.200]  was to reduce the black population in america and she succeeded 80 percent of abortion clinics
[1:57:54.200 --> 1:58:02.120]  and america are in minority neighborhoods over 22 million 500 000 black babies have been aborted
[1:58:02.120 --> 1:58:13.960]  in 50 years over 1000 black babies are aborted every day so that means we are inside of it as we
[1:58:13.960 --> 1:58:19.320]  speak this is genocide so wait we are inside of genocide so what about the people that are
[1:58:19.320 --> 1:58:24.840]  going to argue and say but all right last segment of this hour i'm going to play more of this but
[1:58:25.560 --> 1:58:30.760]  imagine 14 black dudes killed wrongly by the cops maybe each year versus hundreds of thousands
[1:58:30.760 --> 1:58:35.720]  millions killed each year again it's the genocide group running the black leadership that's what
[1:58:35.720 --> 1:58:41.000]  margaret sanger went and did is they hired the black leadership and created the n double acp and
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:50.840]  all of it to exterminate black people constantly whether it's the new york times the washington
[1:58:50.840 --> 1:58:55.320]  post or howard stern of a blue name and they come out and they attack him full war saying
[1:58:55.320 --> 1:59:01.720]  jones claims civil wars coming and financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses
[1:59:01.720 --> 1:59:06.680]  and he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have horrible food if they
[1:59:06.680 --> 1:59:12.280]  can and now everything i've warned people about is coming true because it was all in the rockefeller
[1:59:12.280 --> 1:59:18.920]  foundation documents like lockstep this is the corporate planetary takeover so yes i stand by
[1:59:18.920 --> 1:59:24.520]  what i said 10 years ago what i said a year ago and what i said last week more than ever get your

[1:59:52.520 --> 2:00:06.520]  you
[2:00:06.520 --> 2:00:14.520]  so
[2:00:16.840 --> 2:00:20.280]  speaking at a city council about a week and a half ago
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:29.400]  carlo sapata a business owner a father a veteran of the iraq war laid out what was really happening
[2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:33.960]  and i think did a hundred percent dead on job better than i could have done in two minutes
[2:00:33.960 --> 2:00:38.360]  in citizens communications to challenge their arrogance to lay out the facts and let them know
[2:00:38.360 --> 2:00:44.760]  the reality that even a minority of us are highly motivated and stand up they cannot stop us here's
[2:00:44.760 --> 2:00:51.000]  what he had to say sapata um i wasn't going to speak i was asked to speak here you know uh
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:55.640]  sheriff can see uh i'm telling you guys you know i'm pretty appalled at what's going on you know at
[2:00:55.640 --> 2:01:00.200]  first we sat as concerned citizens that we all want to figure out how to best navigate our way
[2:01:00.200 --> 2:01:05.880]  through this whole covid thing you know and uh as as we realized that it's not quite as dangerous
[2:01:05.880 --> 2:01:08.680]  we thought it'd be you know i was absolutely appalled to cowardice you know and as you're
[2:01:08.680 --> 2:01:12.840]  sitting there with your masks on i don't blame you for wearing masks because i'd be hiding my face
[2:01:12.840 --> 2:01:16.200]  too if i was you for what you're doing this absolutely horrendous what you're doing to these
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:21.160]  people i'm a business owner and uh and i'm telling you our families are starving you know you guys
[2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:24.200]  can sit here with your jobs you can sit here you're gonna get paid you can fall asleep in your chair
[2:01:24.200 --> 2:01:29.000]  like that gentleman's doing behind his mask right there okay and i'm telling you right now that right
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:33.560]  now we're being peaceful and you better be happy that we're we're good citizens that we're peaceful
[2:01:33.560 --> 2:01:37.640]  citizens but it's not going to be peaceful much longer okay and this is in a threat i'm not a
[2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:41.080]  criminal that haven't been a criminal but i'm telling you good citizens are going to turn to
[2:01:41.080 --> 2:01:46.520]  real concerned and revolutionary citizens real soon and nobody else is going to say that i'm probably
[2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:51.320]  the only person that has the balls to say what i'm saying right now that we're building we're organizing
[2:01:52.040 --> 2:01:56.680]  and we'll work with law enforcement or without law enforcement but you won't stop us when time comes
[2:01:56.680 --> 2:02:01.880]  because our families are starving and if you don't hear the seriousness of my voice i hope you open
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:07.320]  your ears you absolutely listen to what i'm saying because this is a warning for what's coming it's not
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:10.920]  gonna be peaceful much longer it's not gonna be raw raw it's not gonna be speeches it's not gonna be
[2:02:10.920 --> 2:02:15.080]  gathered outside saying a pledge of allegiance it's not gonna be waving flags it's gonna be real
[2:02:16.360 --> 2:02:21.000]  when you see the things that i've seen i went to war for this country i've seen the ugliest
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:26.440]  dirtiest part of humanity i've been in combat and i never wanted to go back again but i'm telling
[2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:30.760]  you what i will to save this country if it has to be against our own citizens it will happen
[2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:37.800]  and there's a million people like me and you won't stop us open the county let our citizens do what
[2:02:37.800 --> 2:02:42.600]  they need to do let owners of businesses do what they need to do to feed their families
[2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:49.000]  take the masks off quit masking and muslin your children the psychological damage you're doing
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:53.960]  to them is horrible i've had six friends kill themselves since it's happened veterans who lost
[2:02:53.960 --> 2:02:58.440]  their jobs how do you feel about being complicit in perpetuating that the greatest host ever
[2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:02.680]  perpetuated on the american people and you're part of it why they wear your masks in shasta county
[2:03:02.680 --> 2:03:07.480]  we're supposed to be red country up here not blue country or red country up here you guys know that
[2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:11.080]  i don't you claim to be conservatives maybe you're not maybe you're liberals i don't know
[2:03:11.800 --> 2:03:17.160]  but by god we're americans and remember that take your mask off quit muslin yourselves join us fight
[2:03:17.160 --> 2:03:25.880]  with us against what's going on Sacramento carlo sapata joins us recent video on the viral in
[2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:31.320]  which carlo sapata tongue lashed the shasta county border supervisors in redding california for
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:36.040]  invasive mask and lockdown policies similar what we see in australia related to covet 19
[2:03:36.040 --> 2:03:40.840]  he's a former marine husband father of four iraq veteran brazil jiu-jitsu black belt and teacher
[2:03:40.840 --> 2:03:46.760]  he is a resident of hollow credo california and a patriot the owner of the palomino room in red
[2:03:46.760 --> 2:03:51.640]  bluff california and he joins us so carlos we really appreciate you we love what you said it's
[2:03:51.640 --> 2:03:56.200]  totally true uh you've got the floor i could ask a hundred questions of why you went and spoke what
[2:03:56.200 --> 2:04:00.360]  happened since what's happening with the exodus from california where that you see this going
[2:04:00.360 --> 2:04:05.240]  but just you got the floor my friend let us have it thanks for having me thanks for what you're
[2:04:05.240 --> 2:04:09.080]  doing you know you're really getting a lot of good word out there and uh you're saying things
[2:04:09.080 --> 2:04:12.840]  that are resonating with a lot of people where maybe a year ago people would have thought folks
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:17.400]  like us are crazy now they're listening and uh they're they're tuned into our platforms because
[2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:22.440]  we're saying exactly what they're thinking and uh yeah so obviously they started a couple weeks ago
[2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:28.600]  and i never had any plans to to speak or to be so vocal about the things that i was thinking you
[2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:34.040]  know i'd been vocal in small circles you know within my group of friends within my small scope of
[2:04:34.040 --> 2:04:38.920]  influence but uh never would i have dreamed that this was going to go this far on this big but
[2:04:38.920 --> 2:04:44.200]  that day that night i sort of got thrown in by a friend of mine who's been a great organizer elissa
[2:04:44.200 --> 2:04:48.680]  mcqueen has been an awesome organizer here in our community and she threw me to the front of the line
[2:04:49.400 --> 2:04:53.560]  at the board supervisors meeting and i figured i had two minutes to give them everything that i had
[2:04:53.560 --> 2:04:58.520]  and to put as much information as i could possibly put in front of them you know and then put the
[2:04:58.520 --> 2:05:02.840]  ball in their court because they've absolutely dropped the ball you know and what happens here
[2:05:02.840 --> 2:05:09.400]  like most counties across the country is that they are beholden to the state governments for money
[2:05:09.400 --> 2:05:13.960]  you know we have a tyrant of a governor here in california which you well know gavin usum
[2:05:13.960 --> 2:05:20.040]  who's holding uh a lot of money over their heads and if they don't comply if they don't obey what
[2:05:20.040 --> 2:05:26.840]  what his tyrannical dictatorship is is is mandated then the counties aren't getting that money
[2:05:26.840 --> 2:05:31.400]  but we're to the point now where we want the county supervisors to understand that the money
[2:05:31.400 --> 2:05:35.080]  doesn't come from the government it comes from most of the citizens comes from business owners
[2:05:35.080 --> 2:05:39.880]  it comes from people being able to do commerce here locally and and you know outside of the area
[2:05:40.520 --> 2:05:44.920]  and uh and that's where we're at so you guys saw what i said i think the only incorrect thing i said
[2:05:44.920 --> 2:05:49.240]  was that there's a million people like me i think there's more like probably 30 million people like
[2:05:49.240 --> 2:05:54.760]  me who who would fight and i think there's probably 30 million ready to fight now and as soon as we
[2:05:54.760 --> 2:06:00.040]  would did that we'd have 100 million behind us i mean victory's there as long as they don't distract
[2:06:00.040 --> 2:06:04.600]  us off if things get physical into some side fight but i don't see that happening i just see them
[2:06:04.600 --> 2:06:08.520]  taking our kindness as weakness what where do you think this is all going gut level you seem to have
[2:06:08.520 --> 2:06:15.160]  your head screwed on i'll tell you what alex uh nobody wants war you know especially those of
[2:06:15.160 --> 2:06:20.040]  us who have been there don't want to repeat that but i don't see any way out the one thing i know
[2:06:20.040 --> 2:06:24.120]  about the socialist programs that they want to instill they want to turn this into a socialist
[2:06:24.120 --> 2:06:28.360]  communist country let's make no mistake about it and you can't vote your way out of socialism and
[2:06:28.360 --> 2:06:32.680]  this is what they wanted to to feed down our throats forever right well if you don't like
[2:06:32.680 --> 2:06:36.600]  what's going on when you wait two or four years and then you vote that person out you know and you
[2:06:36.600 --> 2:06:42.360]  get newly elected officials that hopefully uh you know resonate with with what you want them to do
[2:06:42.360 --> 2:06:48.440]  but that's not the way that socialism works once it takes root into any country i know this because
[2:06:48.440 --> 2:06:52.680]  my parents came from peru and my family came from chili and they came from these countries that were
[2:06:52.680 --> 2:06:56.360]  ravaged by socialism and had they been able to vote their way out maybe they would have stayed in
[2:06:56.360 --> 2:07:01.240]  chains of country but the only way that you get out of a socialist state or a communist state is
[2:07:01.240 --> 2:07:05.880]  you either have to leave it or you have to fight and there's nowhere else for us to go my dad said
[2:07:05.880 --> 2:07:09.720]  to me a couple days ago he said son we came here because it's the last pillar of freedom where we
[2:07:09.720 --> 2:07:13.480]  gonna go from here we have no other country that we can pack up our stuff and our families and move
[2:07:13.480 --> 2:07:17.640]  to start a new life and this is it my go feeling alex is that we're at that boiling point where
[2:07:17.640 --> 2:07:23.320]  there's a lot of angry people like myself that have been criminalized for doing the most fundamental
[2:07:23.320 --> 2:07:29.000]  thing which is to open our businesses and earn a living for our for our families and uh and the
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:34.680]  only way that i see out of this is to fight if they fail to uh to listen to our words because
[2:07:34.680 --> 2:07:39.400]  they've completely completely failed to listen to our words at this point now you know the mandates
[2:07:39.400 --> 2:07:44.040]  just get more straight and more regulations come down to pipeline and it's almost like they feed
[2:07:44.040 --> 2:07:47.480]  you a little bit of a carrot right every couple weeks the governor gets on he says hey we're getting
[2:07:47.480 --> 2:07:51.160]  closer to opening it again and then boom they take it right back from you and if he asks you
[2:07:51.160 --> 2:07:55.320]  personally i think it's an experiment it's a game oh they admit it's a giant experiment and all they
[2:07:55.320 --> 2:08:00.600]  do is tighten tighten tighten tighten tighten into their cult and bill gates admits it's a
[2:08:00.600 --> 2:08:05.240]  post industrial world it's it's total economic control so they can dictate us as you said in
[2:08:05.240 --> 2:08:09.800]  latin america anywhere rich powerful countries till they go communists and socialists because they do
[2:08:09.800 --> 2:08:16.840]  it on purpose to make people poor to dictate to them absolutely this has nothing to do with equitable
[2:08:16.840 --> 2:08:22.760]  wealth has nothing to do with creating a sense of equality you know for everybody as socialism
[2:08:22.760 --> 2:08:27.320]  sells itself uh and and this is not a long ahead alex you know they're not even trying to hide or
[2:08:27.320 --> 2:08:33.880]  disguise this anymore you know even castor himself in cuba tried to disguise what he was selling uh
[2:08:33.880 --> 2:08:38.440]  from a centrist point of view right he told people that uh that this was gonna be good for everybody
[2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:42.600]  and he made promises you know he was a secret communist you know your history he was a secret
[2:08:42.600 --> 2:08:47.880]  communist 100% and these guys now they're not even secret anymore you know here we are
[2:08:47.880 --> 2:08:52.920]  united states of america 2020 and and it's no secret what they want to do where they used words
[2:08:52.920 --> 2:08:57.560]  like progressive uh and liberal before now now they're just admitting that they're straight socialists
[2:08:57.560 --> 2:09:02.600]  and we all know that communism is the next step to carlo sapata you you're on you're exploding
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:06.120]  you're on fire when we come back what do you want to cover next i got a lot of questions but what do
[2:09:06.120 --> 2:09:10.600]  you want to get to next you know what alex let's just talk about where where our country's going
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:13.880]  and and how we got here i think we need to understand how we got here in order in order to
[2:09:13.880 --> 2:09:17.640]  understand where we're going exactly know how we got here to know where we are know where we're
[2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:22.840]  gonna go and make that decision everybody to know no more procrastination now folks we're in the
[2:09:22.840 --> 2:09:27.480]  jaws of the fight and if we fight back we're gonna win but if we go along with the creature that's
[2:09:27.480 --> 2:09:32.360]  got it's in its jaws we're gonna lose don't forget the news websites are info wars dot com

[2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:05.960]  radical left has taken over the democratic party and joe viden is marching in lockstep with them
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:12.120]  biden and the far left are promising to crush middle class families with trillions in new taxes

[2:11:37.720 --> 2:11:44.040]  they've already taken over joe biden and the democratic party don't let them take over america
[2:11:44.040 --> 2:11:55.720]  uh you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:02.120 --> 2:12:12.200]  from the front lines from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones so folks used
[2:12:12.200 --> 2:12:17.240]  to hear us 20 something years ago talking about all this and that sounds crazy nobody throw away
[2:12:17.240 --> 2:12:21.880]  america and tell you all this freedom and all the wealth we got problems but no one would throw it
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:28.120]  away for north korea or cuba you understand there's powerful interests behind it that want that it's
[2:12:28.120 --> 2:12:32.520]  it's not kim jong-un or kim jong-il or for the elcastro you're fighting it's the multinational
[2:12:32.520 --> 2:12:38.840]  banks it's the it's the consortiums that are now out in the open that intend to do it and now people
[2:12:38.840 --> 2:12:43.560]  aren't laughing which is a good thing people are starting to wake up i agree with carlos
[2:12:43.560 --> 2:12:47.400]  sapata and i watched his video the other day i think i even said that on there i said this is
[2:12:47.400 --> 2:12:51.880]  like a perfect two minutes except i think it's more than a million he's right but will those more
[2:12:51.880 --> 2:12:56.280]  than a million stand up speak out so let's talk about how we got here next time we'll talk about
[2:12:56.280 --> 2:13:04.040]  where we're going carlos take over hey i'm sorry so i've been a student of history my whole life
[2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:08.600]  you know it's history major in college which doesn't really mean anything but uh but i've read a lot
[2:13:08.600 --> 2:13:12.840]  and i've experienced a lot you know and i'll tell you that i've always felt like there's an attack
[2:13:12.840 --> 2:13:19.080]  on uh on on the american male an attack on the alpha male you know and from the time that we were
[2:13:19.080 --> 2:13:23.640]  kids we were told you can't fight you can't cut you can't talk aggressively you can't make fast
[2:13:23.640 --> 2:13:29.160]  decisions you can't uh you can't win you know and we're to the point now where you got to think
[2:13:29.160 --> 2:13:33.800]  about this you know we've got to the point in america in the world where we actually play sports
[2:13:33.800 --> 2:13:37.880]  we don't allow a team to win think about how ludicrous that is if you don't think that that
[2:13:37.880 --> 2:13:43.400]  eats away at the soul of a man or a soul of a human then then you're absolutely blind you know because
[2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:49.800]  you're doing nobody any favors you're not doing any of a participation trophy and this is a community
[2:13:49.800 --> 2:13:55.320]  a society that we live in now and you got to ask yourself why are they doing this are they really
[2:13:55.320 --> 2:14:00.520]  doing it because they want that loser kid to feel better about himself or that person that maybe
[2:14:01.160 --> 2:14:05.400]  makes a bad decision and not to feel the consequences of it no they do this because
[2:14:05.400 --> 2:14:11.640]  they know that if they eat away at our drive to win and they can start to inject and interject
[2:14:11.640 --> 2:14:15.320]  these socialist policies and these communist policies they know that eventually they're going to try
[2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:19.960]  to make us all the same where there's no winners no losers and we've seen this coming right i mean
[2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:24.520]  i have four children and i think that's maybe why why i have a voice in the community because i'm
[2:14:24.520 --> 2:14:28.280]  every dad i'm every american you know i have a business i have a family and i see some like
[2:14:28.280 --> 2:14:35.000]  kids you know where our kids are being raised now uh to to to feel guilty if they're better than the
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:41.480]  next kid they're made to feel like they need to regress or be less in order to be like everybody
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:48.200]  else you know and if you have half a brain between your ears you know that that leads to absolute
[2:14:48.200 --> 2:14:54.760]  absolute uh just loss loss of culture loss of well exactly they don't want to put the economy
[2:14:54.760 --> 2:14:59.960]  loss of everything go ahead they don't want to put pressure on kids to make them excel and i
[2:14:59.960 --> 2:15:03.800]  remember i was not a good soccer player and i was like six years old they put me in soccer
[2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:07.160]  i remember being at the pizza place at the end of the year and they were giving out the
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:12.040]  participation trophies and nobody told me what they were but i knew i wasn't good at it so it
[2:15:12.040 --> 2:15:15.960]  it made me want to quit because i wasn't mad at the kids that got the big trophy i knew i didn't
[2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:21.720]  deserve it and and even as this is a mammal as a male as a human i knew there was something wrong
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:26.520]  with that that i didn't deserve that you're so you come out the other side of it the kids that
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:31.400]  excel they're saying you're you excelling doesn't matter and then that takes the drive out of people
[2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:38.600]  which makes them soulless 100 you know a thousand percent and and people like you people like me
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:41.960]  people like the kids that that were raised and understand this understand that there's a loser
[2:15:41.960 --> 2:15:48.440]  and there's a winner and here's the deal you know it's okay to make mistakes it's okay to fail right
[2:15:48.440 --> 2:15:52.200]  but we can't live in a society where we don't allow people to fail because it's in all the failures
[2:15:52.200 --> 2:15:59.800]  that i found my success that i found my way around uh towards success right so you can't make a good
[2:15:59.800 --> 2:16:04.920]  decision unless you know what a bad decision feels like smells like you know and and i've made plenty
[2:16:04.920 --> 2:16:11.320]  of those you know which is why i am where i am but uh you know alex i think we're in the most
[2:16:11.320 --> 2:16:16.040]  existential crisis that we've ever been in in our lives you know in my 41 years on this earth
[2:16:16.040 --> 2:16:20.200]  i never would have thought that we'd be fighting for our very identity and i know you've talked
[2:16:20.200 --> 2:16:25.320]  about this before but when we're knocking down statues of our history um that's knocking down a
[2:16:25.320 --> 2:16:32.120]  statue of who we are today you know of who i am as a person now am i a racist no have i ever been
[2:16:32.120 --> 2:16:39.800]  a racist no will i ever be a racist no uh but you know to say that i'm a bad person because
[2:16:39.800 --> 2:16:44.760]  i think that we should have confederate statues in the south uh does not make me a bad person it
[2:16:44.760 --> 2:16:50.680]  makes me a student of history a person that understands that if we erase how we got here we
[2:16:50.680 --> 2:16:53.880]  erase our identity and that's what they want at the end of the day they want a bunch of robots
[2:16:53.880 --> 2:16:58.440]  that are simply going to do what they say and we're seeing that we're seeing the result listen
[2:16:58.440 --> 2:17:02.600]  they are i hate to admit it but they're winning you know they've gotten us to a point where i go
[2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:07.000]  to our local growth i live in a town of 1200 people and i go to the grocery store and i see people
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:12.280]  who are otherwise pretty tough country living people wearing masks all of a sudden where you
[2:17:12.280 --> 2:17:16.200]  know three months ago they weren't but they've been talked into this they've been felt guilty
[2:17:16.200 --> 2:17:20.280]  and when i asked them why are you wearing this mask they said well i just don't want the confrontation
[2:17:20.280 --> 2:17:25.240]  you know i'm i just get anxiety uh from thinking that somebody's gonna approach me and tell me to
[2:17:25.240 --> 2:17:29.160]  put a mask on i said well you know that's the problem the problem is is that is that going back
[2:17:29.160 --> 2:17:32.040]  to what i said earlier we've been taught the confrontation is bad we've been taught the
[2:17:32.040 --> 2:17:37.480]  fight is bad we've been taught that stand up for yourself is bad you know and uh and i don't know
[2:17:37.480 --> 2:17:41.000]  i've been a fighter my whole life i i love to fight so i have no problem walking by somebody
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:46.280]  and once they get you as you know mr sapata to give up on the one thing now it's going to be
[2:17:46.280 --> 2:17:49.880]  contact tracing california has announced when you go to any grocery store or business they're
[2:17:49.880 --> 2:17:54.280]  gonna write on who you are put in a database and then comes the contact tracing then comes the force
[2:17:54.280 --> 2:17:59.240]  inoculation they admit it's not like we're speculating this is coming very soon you talk about war
[2:17:59.240 --> 2:18:05.480]  it's one thing it's no speculation at all keep going sorry no it's it's no longer speculation
[2:18:05.480 --> 2:18:09.000]  at all the days coming where they're gonna tell me that i cannot have a business license unless i
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:16.200]  have a vaccine for this covid fake covid virus i'm telling you it's coming no i agree so when you
[2:18:16.200 --> 2:18:20.600]  say why in the stand i'm ready to go to war i mean it's not like we're starting a fight they're
[2:18:20.600 --> 2:18:25.640]  coming with medical tyranny have you seen australia where they're beating up women and arresting
[2:18:25.640 --> 2:18:31.080]  women that organize demonstrations yes and and that's coming soon so things that we're seeing
[2:18:31.080 --> 2:18:36.120]  now even in our own cities right look look at portland look at seattle we're seeing things that
[2:18:36.120 --> 2:18:40.920]  five years ago we were watching on news in third world countries and thanking god that we were
[2:18:40.920 --> 2:18:45.320]  americans that that and that would never happen here and here we are now having this conversation
[2:18:45.320 --> 2:18:50.040]  alex where you know six hours away people are killing people because of who they're voting for
[2:18:50.040 --> 2:18:53.320]  you know because the guy's a trump supporter and he's getting killed because we thought it could
[2:18:53.320 --> 2:18:58.280]  never have that's key get into that we have just been sleeping on our laurels living on our laurels
[2:18:58.280 --> 2:19:02.840]  and and people need to get know the assaults now this isn't another probe it's not a joke this is
[2:19:02.840 --> 2:19:07.480]  the attack yeah we are here they've crossed the line of departure i've been called a domestic
[2:19:07.480 --> 2:19:12.120]  terrorist since my speech i've been called an insider i've been called a lot of things
[2:19:12.120 --> 2:19:18.120]  by by by some people but let me tell you that i've gotten literally hundreds of thousands of
[2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:24.440]  text messages emails facebook messages instagram messages twitter okay of people that say just
[2:19:24.440 --> 2:19:28.760]  let us know when and we will be there if i put up the balloon right now i said hey i need a million
[2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:33.400]  people here with guns they would show up and that's leadership brother exactly and that's what scares
[2:19:33.400 --> 2:19:39.320]  the system i think they jumped the gun they were planning this later but trump made them launch a
[2:19:39.320 --> 2:19:44.440]  plan that they had planned maybe a decade from now yeah and they've underestimated guys like me and
[2:19:44.440 --> 2:19:49.720]  guys like you they've underestimated uh the fact that you know what us veterans we we look forward
[2:19:49.720 --> 2:19:53.880]  to peaceful lives and raising our families in the way that we see fit but if we have to go to war
[2:19:53.880 --> 2:19:59.560]  we have to remember that the oath that we swore the oath when i raised my right hand uh as a younger
[2:19:59.560 --> 2:20:04.840]  man to uphold and defend the constitution against all armies foreign and domestic that did not end
[2:20:04.840 --> 2:20:10.200]  with my contract that they're not the day that i left active duty that contract between me and
[2:20:10.200 --> 2:20:15.880]  the constitution between me and my country stays stay very much alive and until the day that i died
[2:20:15.880 --> 2:20:20.600]  so the day that i take my last breath you know i have to uphold that that that oath you know of

[2:24:33.080 --> 2:24:37.000]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen and sometimes you gotta lose you know how to win
[2:24:37.720 --> 2:24:43.080]  i am alex jones your host carlo sapata is our guest at marine corps veteran of iraq and a
[2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:49.960]  father and a business owner out in california and shasta county dealing with all this garbage with
[2:24:49.960 --> 2:24:54.600]  the supervisors in redding and he gave that speech but i want people understand something we're not
[2:24:54.600 --> 2:25:00.840]  up here trying to act dramatic this is the whole buildup of the takeover the globalists admit now
[2:25:00.840 --> 2:25:05.240]  at davos this is their reset this is to teach you to be poor this is to get rid of small businesses
[2:25:05.240 --> 2:25:09.800]  you talk about discrimination they talk about black or white all day what about small businesses
[2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:15.880]  can't be opened at walmart and target and governor nusum's wineries can this is so obvious and then
[2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:22.760]  they admit it's a vertical integration so you talked about in that speech things are going to get
[2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:27.080]  physical because you're physically starving us you're physically trying to forcibly inoculate us
[2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:35.480]  you're physically you are attacking us with you know fifth generational warfare and and as a man as
[2:25:35.480 --> 2:25:41.640]  a father i'm not trying to prove myself i'm not looking for a fight but genetically at a cellular
[2:25:41.640 --> 2:25:47.400]  level i can't get my mind out of it now as i see we're under assault i'd be in stock home syndrome
[2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:52.440]  if i decided to just go along with it so how do we get the public not to go under stock home syndrome
[2:25:52.440 --> 2:25:57.800]  but not start a shooting war is there a third rail a way to get out of this before it's too late
[2:25:59.400 --> 2:26:04.360]  you know the mechanisms are set in place through our constitution you know but the palm is alex
[2:26:04.360 --> 2:26:10.840]  at the constitution has been completely disregarded at this point you know if we were still uh operating
[2:26:10.840 --> 2:26:15.400]  under constitutional law and constitutional ideals we wouldn't be having this conversation because
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:19.800]  those mechanisms of how we deal with this would be there then biggest mechanism that we have that
[2:26:19.800 --> 2:26:24.760]  was granted upon us is obviously our second amendment we can talk to we're blue in the face
[2:26:24.760 --> 2:26:29.480]  but if our message does not have teeth behind it if we don't have that bottom line but we're
[2:26:29.480 --> 2:26:35.480]  actually willing to go into a kinetic type of warfare for our ideas then our message means
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:39.000]  absolutely nothing and and and that's what's happened you know that they've taken advantage
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:42.920]  of our kindness of our weak or that they've mistaken our kindness for weakness because they
[2:26:42.920 --> 2:26:48.280]  thought that we would never actually go into that kinetic fight and and and we will and we have to
[2:26:48.280 --> 2:26:53.480]  because listen i've done well for myself but i can't afford to lose any more money i can't
[2:26:53.480 --> 2:26:58.200]  afford to have a closed business that i've put half a million dollars of my own money into in the
[2:26:58.200 --> 2:27:02.840]  last year you know and there's other businesses that aren't going to be okay other businesses that
[2:27:02.840 --> 2:27:07.800]  won't open again so you've taken away our most fundamental right which is what the pursuit of
[2:27:07.800 --> 2:27:14.520]  happiness right the pursuit of happiness was put it was written for a reason because somebody knew
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:20.360]  that one day we would be able to open our business but they also knew that someday somebody was going
[2:27:20.360 --> 2:27:25.000]  to be able to take that away from us and and the foresight that our forefathers had is absolutely
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:29.880]  divine if we can't see that if we can't see it these were the most intelligent men that ever
[2:27:29.880 --> 2:27:34.360]  lived that wrote a constitution that we're just simply not american and we hate our culture we
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:40.200]  hate our country but that's why we're here and these these piranhas i call them these liberal
[2:27:40.200 --> 2:27:45.640]  piranhas are so good at feeding off of the vulnerable right so let's talk about what's
[2:27:45.640 --> 2:27:50.200]  happened in central america what happened there they prayed on the least of these right they
[2:27:50.200 --> 2:27:54.520]  prayed on the native population that was uneducated and they turned them against the white man against
[2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:58.360]  the european man right and they told them that it was their fault that they were where they were
[2:27:58.360 --> 2:28:02.440]  it was their fault that they weren't educated it was their fault they didn't have good schools or
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:08.040]  housing or whatever you know and they're doing the exact same here but let's call it the black
[2:28:08.040 --> 2:28:13.400]  population okay they've taken a black population of fatherless society and turned them against
[2:28:13.400 --> 2:28:18.840]  everybody else this is what we're seeing blm and antifa gaining ground in this country without
[2:28:18.840 --> 2:28:23.000]  that population they would have nothing because the rest of us aren't going to fall for that now
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:28.280]  this is this is not a knock on a black community in fact i have uh you're talking about liberation
[2:28:28.280 --> 2:28:33.800]  theology the cia the foundations it's on record they take schisms and manipulate them for division
[2:28:34.520 --> 2:28:39.000]  100 and there's some great black leaders coming out of this and i think that that the black community
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:43.480]  is awakening now and seeing that they've been taken advantage of they're being raped and and they
[2:28:43.480 --> 2:28:51.880]  absolutely uh are looking at the west 100 look at folks like david harris jr that that's a good
[2:28:51.880 --> 2:28:55.320]  friend of mine you know people who are intelligent coming out and saying look we need to address the
[2:28:55.320 --> 2:29:00.440]  problem and if it makes me a racist to address a serious problem because i want you to fix it
[2:29:00.440 --> 2:29:05.080]  that then label me what you will but i'll say that look i'm trying to fix a problem if unless we
[2:29:05.080 --> 2:29:10.600]  identify what the issue is we can't fix it right uh so what is the heart of the matter it's the
[2:29:10.600 --> 2:29:16.440]  megacorporations playing us against each other using psychological warfare cheating what did
[2:29:16.440 --> 2:29:21.640]  they need to be brought to justice it's absolute this is this whole thing's a psychological operation
[2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:25.880]  you know uh i i had an opportunity to work with with the i was i was in the marine court but i
[2:29:25.880 --> 2:29:32.360]  worked with the army scythe guys when i was in iraq and and i'm seeing exactly uh the playbook
[2:29:32.360 --> 2:29:36.360]  that they would use you know if i was in a controlled population i would use the playbook
[2:29:36.360 --> 2:29:39.560]  that's been set out for these guys already all you have to do is read the book you know what
[2:29:39.560 --> 2:29:43.400]  we're going this does not end well for us not today not tomorrow not 10 years from now it never
[2:29:43.400 --> 2:29:49.880]  ends well for us the only way is to realize the game and not play it oh you have to and go back
[2:29:49.880 --> 2:29:54.200]  to what i said earlier i am absolutely appalled and i'm disgusted i want to throw up every time i
[2:29:54.200 --> 2:29:59.240]  see a friend of mine or somebody that i that i respected before play the game simply because
[2:29:59.240 --> 2:30:06.360]  well well i can't afford not to i have to keep my job you know i have to comply well i'm trying to
[2:30:06.360 --> 2:30:10.840]  save my words you know because i don't want to here's the book no it's excessive approximation
[2:30:10.840 --> 2:30:16.600]  we're being walked into total slavery complying doesn't get you ahead now it it it means the
[2:30:16.600 --> 2:30:21.720]  takeover like venezuela absolutely and people say they say well you know it's just a mask right oh
[2:30:21.720 --> 2:30:26.520]  yeah it's just a mask you gotta tell me you can't put on a mask you can go fight for this country
[2:30:26.520 --> 2:30:31.560]  no it's what that mass signifies that mass signifies absolute control it abs it signifies
[2:30:31.560 --> 2:30:37.240]  silencing myself silencing my children it signifies going under groups of my identity
[2:30:38.040 --> 2:30:42.360]  what do you make 100 years ago the muslims sorry go ahead the muslims
[2:30:42.360 --> 2:30:47.400]  100 years ago the muslims knew that if they covered somebody's face it would take their
[2:30:47.400 --> 2:30:51.320]  identity it would take their self-worth if you take away our self-worth you eat away at the very
[2:30:51.320 --> 2:30:54.760]  soul of what makes us great and that's what's happening let's talk about that in a moment
[2:30:54.760 --> 2:30:58.840]  because i interrupted you but what do you make of all the democrats caught eating at restaurants
[2:30:58.840 --> 2:31:05.480]  they own uh going to salons not wearing masks i mean they know it's a fraud so they'll arrest you
[2:31:05.480 --> 2:31:08.600]  if it's not their business but if it's their pet business then they can do it
[2:31:08.600 --> 2:31:15.640]  you know i don't think much of it it doesn't surprise me one bit you know i was not even
[2:31:15.640 --> 2:31:20.440]  shocked at all from what i saw at nancy pelosi video we know this about it this is not a surprise
[2:31:20.440 --> 2:31:25.160]  they're not hiding it they're elitists they hate the middle class they want to eradicate the middle
[2:31:25.160 --> 2:31:29.400]  class you know because they can't control the middle class they can control the lower classes
[2:31:29.400 --> 2:31:34.280]  with money they can't control people like me you know and uh they want domesticated people in a
[2:31:34.280 --> 2:31:39.080]  world of money the middle class is the free undomesticated person they want to kill the
[2:31:39.080 --> 2:31:43.720]  pioneer spirit remember while we're out here i live out west you know uh the west was won by
[2:31:43.720 --> 2:31:49.000]  pioneers were willing to fight for what they wanted you know with with no promise of victory
[2:31:49.000 --> 2:31:52.840]  you know they fought with no promise of victory knowing that there might be something else over
[2:31:52.840 --> 2:31:57.480]  the horizon you know that might benefit their families so that pioneer spirit out here out west
[2:31:57.480 --> 2:32:02.360]  i live in rural america uh that's being trampled on you know people but it's the very people
[2:32:02.360 --> 2:32:06.040]  they're being trampled on they're going to fight people like me will fight and and like i said
[2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:10.600]  before i think you said what 30 40 let's let's call it 50 million people that would fight with us right
[2:32:10.600 --> 2:32:17.080]  now that's right let me play a short clip of a few months ago this mirrors pelosi of lightfoot
[2:32:17.880 --> 2:32:22.040]  caught out at a salon and she goes well i'm a public figure i need to have my hair done
[2:32:22.040 --> 2:32:26.520]  oh no one else needs a haircut i had that haircut and you know in a while i shaved my
[2:32:26.520 --> 2:32:32.920]  head when this was coming i knew it was coming but i mean the elitism where it's insane to say
[2:32:32.920 --> 2:32:39.320]  i'm an elitist i don't i'm i mean they're they're even blind to their elitism this is beyond
[2:32:39.320 --> 2:32:44.200]  quote racism this is classism meaning in america we all have the same rights not under them it's
[2:32:44.200 --> 2:32:54.120]  it's incredible here it is you guys got lightfoot player i'm out in the public eye and you know i'm
[2:32:54.120 --> 2:33:01.000]  a i'm i'm a person who i take my personal hygiene very seriously as i said i felt like i needed to
[2:33:01.640 --> 2:33:07.080]  have a haircut i'm not able to do that myself and so i got a haircut and again the full press
[2:33:07.080 --> 2:33:12.040]  conference is she was arresting people opening their barbershops but she goes but i need a haircut
[2:33:12.040 --> 2:33:19.960]  i mean this woman is totally blind and totally unself aware how the hell do you say you are
[2:33:19.960 --> 2:33:25.000]  arrested if you go get your he even said the speech like a week before i'll catch you in a barbershop
[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:29.560]  or i'll catch you in a bar or i'll catch you in a restaurant you're arrested you're like well i'm
[2:33:29.560 --> 2:33:36.840]  i'm important i mean i gotta get my hair done what the hell and same thing with polosi oh my god
[2:33:36.840 --> 2:33:44.840]  nuisance let me just admiral ag bar whatever it is we'll be right back this is a maximum alert a
[2:33:44.840 --> 2:33:51.000]  maximum alert as of taking this alert we're 82 days out from the election as many of you know in
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:55.480]  the last year i've pointed out statements out of the council on foreign relations and other
[2:33:55.480 --> 2:34:01.320]  globalist organs that they know trump is going to win in a landslide so their strategy will be
[2:34:01.320 --> 2:34:07.960]  to contest the election if they fail to successfully steal it then they are openly now wargaming this
[2:34:07.960 --> 2:34:13.640]  is in the new york times having democrat states and cities secede from the union just like they've
[2:34:13.640 --> 2:34:19.000]  ignored trump's policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down that is nothing but a
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:23.880]  dress rehearsal they are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration not in dc
[2:34:23.880 --> 2:34:31.080]  they said in another city polosia said this when they crown bighton and kamala harris ladies and
[2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:37.640]  gentlemen this is the organized civil war this is their public criminal plan we should be praying
[2:34:37.640 --> 2:34:41.640]  we should be spreading the word we should be demanding trouble in the office to expose this
[2:34:41.640 --> 2:34:51.000]  criminal activity there's a nauseating sense to it not a sense of triumph not a sense of victory
[2:34:51.960 --> 2:35:00.040]  not a sense of completion a sense of sixth nausea though we were right about the world
[2:35:00.040 --> 2:35:04.920]  government we were right about the anti-human plans we were right about all the horrible
[2:35:04.920 --> 2:35:11.080]  things the globalists and their satanic order want to do to us now we sit here
[2:35:12.760 --> 2:35:17.800]  warning people for decades trying to get people ready trying to stop what was coming but you
[2:35:17.800 --> 2:35:23.960]  know what revelations and god's word says it's coming so you can't stop it and it's in that
[2:35:23.960 --> 2:35:29.960]  understanding that we're part of guards larger plan than he come to the point in our own psyche
[2:35:29.960 --> 2:35:35.560]  our own spirit in our own will that we submit to god and realize god's in charge of god's power
[2:35:36.680 --> 2:35:41.400]  and the devil is set as a tester now it's up to us to make the right decision that's what's
[2:35:41.400 --> 2:35:48.120]  really always been about i'm not gonna lie to you i want to stay in the fight against soros of

[2:37:59.400 --> 2:38:04.920]  things are cliches because they're true people say i'm over and over again well it's always
[2:38:04.920 --> 2:38:09.960]  darkest before the dawn there's another cliche you don't ever meet your heroes will disappoint you
[2:38:09.960 --> 2:38:14.680]  well meeting carlo sapata who is a hero to us all and it's just common sense two minutes
[2:38:15.400 --> 2:38:18.360]  has not been disappointing it's been empowering and i want to invite him back
[2:38:19.320 --> 2:38:23.480]  on the war room on the election countdown on the day of the night show
[2:38:23.480 --> 2:38:28.520]  to get his analysis and and topics he wants to cover and things that are unfolding carlos let
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:33.160]  me ask you this question i mean we went to break you had another topic you were on i said hold over
[2:38:33.160 --> 2:38:39.080]  i forget what it was but what do you think the globalists are thinking i think they're just
[2:38:39.080 --> 2:38:43.400]  testing and probing to see what we'll put up with and the fact that they the leadership never get
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:48.760]  in trouble that's why they think invisible why they think that they are invincible your thoughts
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:53.880]  on that and and just on the election and on the destabilization and and everything else that's
[2:38:53.880 --> 2:38:58.520]  happening i think they push a little bit further every time every time something like this happens
[2:38:58.520 --> 2:39:03.640]  they're gonna push a little bit further to see how how global we are and we prove over and over
[2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:10.680]  again to be very global we prove that will allow them to push the line more and more and things that
[2:39:10.680 --> 2:39:17.080]  if you would have asked us a year ago hey at what point would you fight against a tyrannical government
[2:39:17.080 --> 2:39:21.400]  you know people say oh well if they made me shut down my business i might fight well here we are
[2:39:21.400 --> 2:39:24.600]  they shut down our businesses that they more maybe wear a mask i might fight well here we are
[2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:29.640]  wearing a mask and we're not fighting so we're telling them you know and silence is consent
[2:39:29.640 --> 2:39:35.160]  and i'm not silent you're not silent people like us aren't silent but there's very many people that
[2:39:35.160 --> 2:39:39.240]  are and as long as we're consenting and they see that consent they're gonna continue to move the
[2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:45.160]  line and people like us will be labeled the terrorist will be labeled the fringe right
[2:39:46.600 --> 2:39:52.120]  but you know alex like i said this doesn't end well for us unless we change course and we change
[2:39:52.120 --> 2:39:57.800]  course now and right now we have the most important election in the history of our country coming up
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:40:03.000]  where my mother was sitting here in my living room last week and she said son this is no longer about
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:09.320]  joe biden versus donald trump this is literally in a very real way a choice between liberty and
[2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:15.720]  freedom and tyranny and that's it and if we choose tyranny this time around we will never ever ever
[2:40:15.720 --> 2:40:20.840]  be able to go back to where we want to be and you've been through this you saw this in peru
[2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:26.760]  your family did i mean the globalist this is this is a total takeover they described to people
[2:40:26.760 --> 2:40:31.000]  with your historical understanding what it will look like if they win what the future is
[2:40:33.320 --> 2:40:38.840]  if they win it's going to be be a free for all alex i'm going to tell you what's going to happen
[2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:46.680]  if joe biden wins in november uh they're going to absolutely push their agenda in a way that is
[2:40:46.680 --> 2:40:51.400]  so fast and so uncontrollable that we will not have a choice we won't be able to stop it
[2:40:51.400 --> 2:40:56.360]  unless we take the streets there's going to be bloodshed in the streets because uh at at that
[2:40:56.360 --> 2:41:01.080]  point they know they've won and at that point they are going to be so rooted for the next four
[2:41:01.080 --> 2:41:05.720]  day years that we will never be able to catch up again uh and like i said before we won't be able
[2:41:05.720 --> 2:41:10.840]  to vote ourselves out of this this time around we barely voted our way out of it you know from
[2:41:10.840 --> 2:41:16.520]  the obama years and we won't be able to do it this time around and uh their infrastructure is there
[2:41:17.240 --> 2:41:22.520]  they have their plan in place and that's right they've gone weaponized we barely got a reprieve
[2:41:22.520 --> 2:41:28.920]  believe trump held on under total coup d'etat and now they know if they get in they're going to go
[2:41:28.920 --> 2:41:34.280]  for the they say we're going to quote wipe his supporters out wipe out americans wipe out the
[2:41:34.280 --> 2:41:39.640]  middle class i mean they're on tv saying they're going to quote level us wipe us out your family
[2:41:39.640 --> 2:41:43.720]  experience of that what does the wipe out look like the the they're they're telling us what's
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:46.840]  going to look like it's going to be like you losing all your wealth it's going to be like
[2:41:46.840 --> 2:41:50.120]  guys like me going to the bank one day not having any money in the account because my
[2:41:50.120 --> 2:41:54.840]  accounts are frozen and i'll be able to access them you know it's going to look like them telling
[2:41:54.840 --> 2:41:58.840]  me that i can't run my business because i don't have a vaccine or my kids aren't vaccinated it's
[2:41:58.840 --> 2:42:04.200]  going to look like my kids not because that's the cover for their communism is going to be the the
[2:42:04.200 --> 2:42:11.640]  the microsoft bill gates from contact tracing that's their cover so so we know the playbook right
[2:42:11.640 --> 2:42:17.480]  they create uh they created an obstacle they create a problem okay then they wait for a reaction
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:21.000]  and then they create a solution right but the solution is not a real solution the solution is
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:25.560]  just furthering their own agenda by whatever action they take and in this case it's going to be
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:29.960]  the i think the inoculation the contact tracing it's going to be a very globalist
[2:42:31.160 --> 2:42:37.320]  control over us and we have nowhere to go from here alex i can't pack up i said this
[2:42:37.320 --> 2:42:41.240]  early i can't pack up my family sell my things and go to another country to start over again
[2:42:41.240 --> 2:42:44.840]  and there's nowhere to run i love america but i've said if there was some free country the
[2:42:44.840 --> 2:42:49.160]  folks that got it i would have left because uh we would have gone we would have gone because i love
[2:42:49.160 --> 2:42:54.600]  my freedom one i love my country and i love my country because of my freedom beautifully said
[2:42:54.600 --> 2:42:59.800]  so wow sounds like your folks are great and we forgive talk about your parents they are you
[2:42:59.800 --> 2:43:05.240]  know okay my parents you know i say this all the time that my parents we came from very humble
[2:43:05.240 --> 2:43:11.800]  beginnings okay um my parents families have done very well in peru in latin america in fact i'll
[2:43:11.800 --> 2:43:17.880]  tell you something that i haven't said on any show before is that uh my grandfather was an ayende
[2:43:17.880 --> 2:43:22.360]  related to salvador ayende who was the communist leader of chili and we know what happened to him
[2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:28.360]  you know uh in that coup d'etat and so that is my family history we come from the ayende family
[2:43:28.360 --> 2:43:35.720]  we come from a socialist communist father was a leader of the socialist party in peru you know
[2:43:35.720 --> 2:43:39.480]  he fled chili and he became a leader of the socialist party in peru and so i've seen how this
[2:43:39.480 --> 2:43:44.920]  crushed that country how it crushed uh you know not not only the government but but the people
[2:43:44.920 --> 2:43:49.400]  and the culture of that country it's a beautiful country so so i know this my family was part of
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:55.240]  this history you know so let me tell you that this does not end well for free people okay so here i am
[2:43:55.240 --> 2:44:00.520]  now a proud american i'm an american if you ask me i'm not a peruvian american not a lat american
[2:44:00.520 --> 2:44:05.880]  i am a red but i can tell if i ask about your folks i can tell you know what you're talking about
[2:44:05.880 --> 2:44:09.800]  not just from the in the military being american but you you had some expert understanding
[2:44:11.160 --> 2:44:16.520]  yeah and my parents are great people listen they lost absolutely everything you know whatever
[2:44:16.520 --> 2:44:21.160]  families had amassed and wealth was completely lost they came to this country uh my father's
[2:44:21.160 --> 2:44:26.360]  a pre-trades a pastor of a church no i get it there's nothing like experience to make you be
[2:44:26.360 --> 2:44:33.560]  intelligent and informed absolutely nothing else you know so let me talk about this for one second
[2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:37.960]  alex if you don't mind me jumping around a little bit what you just said about experience
[2:44:37.960 --> 2:44:43.400]  is something that that you can't replicate you have to understand things based on experience right
[2:44:44.520 --> 2:44:50.760]  what have we done you know to to our society over the last 30 years i was raised in a community
[2:44:50.760 --> 2:44:54.360]  that told you that if you don't go to college you're gonna end up being a plumber okay well
[2:44:54.360 --> 2:44:59.480]  plumber makes 150 an hour and if they own their own business they make more right so and people
[2:44:59.480 --> 2:45:05.800]  the college degree on average are back in grocery sorry 100 so i'm going somewhere with this right
[2:45:05.800 --> 2:45:10.360]  and that we were all funneled into this pipeline of indoctrination you were told that you have to
[2:45:10.360 --> 2:45:14.360]  go to college because if you don't go to college you're gonna be a dummy you're gonna go work in
[2:45:14.360 --> 2:45:17.800]  the trades well guess what some of the smartest people i know never went to college some of the
[2:45:17.800 --> 2:45:22.440]  smartest most intelligent capable people i know work in the trades okay but why do they want us
[2:45:22.440 --> 2:45:29.400]  all to go to college because this conditioning had to have a vessel and that vessel was academia
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:33.720]  right that vessel was universities and colleges around the country where they could funnel also
[2:45:33.720 --> 2:45:39.480]  all in there and get brainwashed essentially to where we are now in the political army you know
[2:45:39.480 --> 2:45:44.760]  and create a political army and allies because they knew that uh that this day would come where
[2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:50.360]  they would need every last person you know and they need to give them educations that disenfranchise
[2:45:50.360 --> 2:45:54.600]  them so they're desperate and scared and will follow the cult leaders who've already abused
[2:45:54.600 --> 2:46:01.720]  them under Stockholm syndrome to then direct them against the rest of the country 100 you know it's
[2:46:01.720 --> 2:46:05.560]  all conditioning and i won't even go into all the studies that have been done we could go into that
[2:46:05.560 --> 2:46:10.760]  another time but you know studies of how easily easily conditioned people are you know and i'm
[2:46:10.760 --> 2:46:21.160]  milgram stanford you name it yep well listen you need to join us again you when you want to come back on with the show i would love to you tell me i

[2:47:11.800 --> 2:47:17.240]  one thing that i will not buy into is the fact that based on the color of my skin you know being
[2:47:17.240 --> 2:47:21.800]  unHispanic uh that i need to vote a certain way you know because there's so many like us you know

[2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:32.360]  isn't real stuff by all sides out there but the globalist corporates with their sociology

[2:49:36.760 --> 2:49:43.000]  term the false left right paradigm from reading the books by carol quickly speaking brisinski and
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:52.360]  others how they described powerful institutions and foundations successful takeover of the left
[2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:56.520]  parties and right parties in europe and the united states it didn't mean that those parties
[2:49:56.520 --> 2:50:01.400]  didn't have differences before they were able to get control the leadership of both and manipulate
[2:50:01.400 --> 2:50:06.680]  the public with the illusion of change and the illusion of a fight going on like w w f wrestling
[2:50:06.680 --> 2:50:12.120]  or something with trump and with our populist movement taking over the republicans this is a
[2:50:12.120 --> 2:50:16.760]  real populist movement doesn't mean it's perfect and you know it's real because the democrats the
[2:50:16.760 --> 2:50:22.920]  power structure the chai comms and the entire old republican leadership have all endorsed joe biden
[2:50:22.920 --> 2:50:28.040]  that's why i'm supporting trump it's about americanism not globalism it's about ending the one-sided
[2:50:28.040 --> 2:50:32.360]  trade deals by defending our borders by defending the right to second amendment and pro-life and
[2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:44.840]  trump's doing all of that you're listening to the alex jones show we are drugged out we are
[2:50:44.840 --> 2:50:53.480]  following other people's opinions we are controlled by the media today it all changes this reality has
[2:50:53.480 --> 2:50:59.240]  been forced upon us it is a choice just like when i said slavery is a choice istein says the
[2:50:59.240 --> 2:51:04.280]  definite insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result so we keep on saying i hate you
[2:51:04.280 --> 2:51:09.480]  i hate you you you you how are we gonna get a different result out of hate why don't we just
[2:51:09.480 --> 2:51:17.400]  try love why don't we just try love we have the resources for a peaceful world you know sometimes
[2:51:17.400 --> 2:51:23.400]  you need some crazy mother to change something steve jobs is crazy now we all know Steve jobs
[2:51:23.400 --> 2:51:29.480]  phones they say trunks crazy they say i'm crazy but i'm here to show love it's a bigger plan and
[2:51:29.480 --> 2:51:39.400]  i'm just doing what the universe told me resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[2:51:41.400 --> 2:51:45.160]  all right i played part of the kanya clip earlier but i want to play the whole thing right now
[2:51:46.360 --> 2:51:51.400]  and then i've got some news so good so powerful and we've been breaking a lot of big news here
[2:51:51.400 --> 2:51:57.320]  today but this is really exciting trump is doing exactly what we blew up a few months ago and said
[2:51:57.320 --> 2:52:01.880]  he should do it i'm not saying he's listening to us maybe he's listening to the same angel that god sent
[2:52:01.880 --> 2:52:07.640]  but he is definitely hitting on all cylinders right now we'll tell you about when we come back
[2:52:07.640 --> 2:52:11.960]  and then general report takes over but uh michael levin did a great job breaking things down this is
[2:52:11.960 --> 2:52:18.120]  next segment i want to stay with us but uh here's what kanya kanya had to say about the real it's
[2:52:18.120 --> 2:52:22.280]  not about virtues so when the black people you know i know they train a lot of black folks be
[2:52:22.280 --> 2:52:26.520]  racist and mean to white people a lot of white folks didn't do anything uh and then they get pissed
[2:52:26.520 --> 2:52:30.120]  and start hating black people that that's just like showing blacks cops killing blacks and they
[2:52:30.120 --> 2:52:36.120]  think all the whites want to kill them it's all manipulation but there's a larger plan
[2:52:36.920 --> 2:52:40.920]  and if we just expose how blacks have been put on the globalist plantation as a beta test
[2:52:42.840 --> 2:52:47.240]  like australia is a beta test right now it's game over we come together we'll still have problems
[2:52:47.240 --> 2:52:51.960]  still have issues but it's nothing compared to the post-human new world order that doesn't
[2:52:51.960 --> 2:52:58.520]  want any people got that here's what kanya had to say last night's big to the war so because
[2:52:58.520 --> 2:53:07.400]  it was a setup right now okay so let us get to let's get to life um in 50 years there's 20
[2:53:07.400 --> 2:53:19.000]  there's been 22 million over 22 million 500 000 black people aborted strategically and on purpose
[2:53:20.200 --> 2:53:30.040]  planned parenthood was set up and placed in minority communities to kill black people
[2:53:30.040 --> 2:53:36.120]  you're talking about uh when margaret sanger the originator of plant parent at the time
[2:53:36.120 --> 2:53:40.440]  because a lot of people when when you say things like that to in their defense they say well
[2:53:40.440 --> 2:53:47.240]  plan parenthood today is a different organization but the but what you do here we go but what you
[2:53:47.240 --> 2:53:53.080]  cannot deny is these facts that yay is about to give you right now here we go margaret sanger the
[2:53:53.080 --> 2:53:59.000]  founder of plan parenthood was an avowed racist whose goal was to reduce the black population
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:06.760]  in america and she succeeded 80 of abortion clinics in america are in minority neighborhoods
[2:54:06.760 --> 2:54:15.800]  over 22 million 500 000 black babies have been aborted in 50 years over 1000 black babies are
[2:54:15.800 --> 2:54:25.240]  aborted every day so that means we are inside of it as we speak this is genocide so wait we are
[2:54:25.240 --> 2:54:31.880]  inside of genocide so what about the people that are going to argue and say but you know kanya
[2:54:31.880 --> 2:54:37.000]  doesn't have the right to speak on that uh because he's not a woman uh the fact that
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:40.920]  planned parenthood does a lot of amazing things and they're in those communities because they
[2:54:40.920 --> 2:54:46.440]  need to be in those communities well i have to go to the word god says he knew you before you were
[2:54:46.440 --> 2:54:55.160]  in the womb yep jeremiah 15 yeah so i got a one one other statistic abortion is the number one killer
[2:54:55.160 --> 2:55:02.040]  of black lives in the united states according to the centers for disease control and prevention
[2:55:02.840 --> 2:55:13.480]  abortion kills more black people than hiv homicide diabetes accidents cancer and heart disease watch
[2:55:13.480 --> 2:55:20.360]  this one combined then they pump in the vaccines the fluoride that dumps us all down they give us
[2:55:20.360 --> 2:55:24.680]  gangster rap they have us kill each other and then they sit back and try to make us all kill each
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:30.200]  other again it's real simple this is a globalist takeover of full videos on info wars dot com and
[2:55:30.200 --> 2:55:35.080]  news wars dot com that's why this broadcast is so important that's why funding of it is critical
[2:55:35.080 --> 2:55:43.000]  because without your money we're not going to be on air in full war store dot com the new world order
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  is a planetary corporate plan for world government but world government is only the control grid now
[2:55:51.720 --> 2:55:57.240]  inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain
[2:55:57.240 --> 2:56:04.040]  immortality but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based
[2:56:04.040 --> 2:56:10.360]  line forms that's why they say carbon is bad they are rewriting the entire genetic code of the
[2:56:10.360 --> 2:56:17.480]  planet they are playing god they believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities
[2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:24.520]  that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation i know this sounds insane
[2:56:24.520 --> 2:56:31.640]  but if you read the writings of the globalist it's all on record you have been warned you have
[2:56:31.640 --> 2:56:38.760]  been given the information to say no to this plan this is the end of all life on earth as we know it
[2:56:38.760 --> 2:57:08.520]  this is the alien takeover of earth giving back my bullets this is my first amendment
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:20.600]  all right let's talk about it
[2:57:22.600 --> 2:57:28.680]  you want to talk about victory i have told trump and obviously this is a common sense thing it's
[2:57:28.680 --> 2:57:32.440]  the right thing to do anyways and the funny how the right thing to do is always the right thing
[2:57:32.440 --> 2:57:41.160]  to do anyways new york's true nursing home death toll cloaked in secrecy that's not info wars dot
[2:57:41.160 --> 2:57:48.840]  com headline that's ap see everybody was saying 44 percent of the deaths were in nursing homes
[2:57:50.200 --> 2:57:56.120]  there was like 6 000 new york but we had a group that crunched the numbers two months ago it was
[2:57:56.120 --> 2:58:03.240]  over 10 000 what just what numbers publicly available the word is they probably wiped out 15 000 old
[2:58:03.240 --> 2:58:08.600]  people in new york alone and in nine other states and now they think it's 60 percent of the coveted
[2:58:08.600 --> 2:58:13.880]  deaths were old people they sent people with flu and pneumonia into the nursing homes told the
[2:58:13.880 --> 2:58:20.280]  families they couldn't be there so they could cover them up and kill them so leticia james
[2:58:20.280 --> 2:58:24.920]  under orders of the governor ordered nursing homes that said we're not going to put sick people in
[2:58:24.920 --> 2:58:29.800]  nursing home that's a disaster she said i'll arrest you if you don't so that criminal apicia
[2:58:29.800 --> 2:58:36.280]  james and the criminal governor qualmo are in trouble when ap puts it out they're in a lot of
[2:58:36.280 --> 2:58:44.360]  trouble new york's true nursing home death toll cloaked in secrecy and the same thing in michigan
[2:58:45.080 --> 2:58:50.520]  and pennsylvania and all over the place these are some evil people they knew the doctors told them
[2:58:50.520 --> 2:58:55.720]  that you do this it's death sentence now mike levin on his show on the blaze led it out to the great
[2:58:55.720 --> 2:59:01.960]  job and pointed out that months ago we first reported this qualmo erased his executive order
[2:59:01.960 --> 2:59:07.320]  ordering all this and hopes you forget about it and hopes all leticia james attacks on the nra and
[2:59:07.320 --> 2:59:12.040]  info wars make you forget that they're the real criminals they're the ones that are mass murderers
[2:59:12.040 --> 2:59:17.640]  on record and ordered mass murder and deserve to be put in prison for the rest of their dirty
[2:59:17.640 --> 2:59:23.000]  stinking lives and now we're getting closer to real justice that's a beautiful thing and then
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:30.840]  john rapaport takes over but here's mike levin it's amazing again that this guy qualmo has a major
[2:59:30.840 --> 2:59:37.480]  speaking part during the lead up to the nomination of biden while they continue to trash the president
[2:59:37.480 --> 2:59:42.920]  united states this is why i spent a big chunk of time maybe too much time in this program going
[2:59:42.920 --> 2:59:47.880]  through the list of the things the trump administration did and when they did it quickly
[2:59:48.680 --> 2:59:54.120]  their actions have been ubiquitous they really seem to leave no stone on turn and then we have one
[2:59:54.120 --> 3:00:00.840]  guy running a state who makes the biggest boneheaded decision you can imagine and the minute i heard
[3:00:00.840 --> 3:00:08.760]  it when i got that call as i pointed out last i couldn't believe it now business insider governor
[3:00:08.760 --> 3:00:15.480]  qualmo's march 25 order that required nursing homes to admit patients who were suspected to have
[3:00:15.480 --> 3:00:23.320]  or had tested positive for cova 19 has been deleted and this is some time ago from the state of new
[3:00:23.320 --> 3:00:29.480]  york's website fox news reported the state of new york's website displayed an error message
[3:00:29.480 --> 3:00:35.320]  stating the page that you are looking for is not found in place of a link to the original document
[3:00:35.320 --> 3:00:41.640]  the march 25 order is only accessible through an archive version of the web page posted by the
[3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:47.560]  internet archives way back machine so he's trying to cover up his tracks here and he's lied about
[3:00:47.560 --> 3:00:52.520]  he's given multiple excuses for this in the past federal guidelines required a federal guidelines
[3:00:52.520 --> 3:00:57.480]  required no such thing you could have used that medical ship that was effectively empty well they
[3:00:57.480 --> 3:01:01.160]  didn't tell me i could but you didn't ask they would have allowed you to use it just as they
[3:01:01.160 --> 3:01:07.320]  allowed you to use the uh the javits center for people who had the covid virus so over and over
[3:01:07.320 --> 3:01:15.080]  again he lies before qualmo released new guidelines on may 10 mandating that hospitals could not send
[3:01:15.080 --> 3:01:21.560]  cova 19 positive patients back to nursing homes until they tested negative for the virus got that
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:27.560]  so he reversed his course the controversial order stated that quote no resident shall be denied
[3:01:27.560 --> 3:01:32.600]  readmission or admission to the nursing home solely based when they confirmed or suspected
[3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:39.640]  diagnosis of cova 19 in other words you have no say and so that person who's sick you can bring
[3:01:39.640 --> 3:01:44.680]  them into a healthy population and the senior citizens are in nursing homes you're in a nursing
[3:01:44.680 --> 3:01:52.600]  home that's the last resort that's where you're going to wind up mostly passing there being taken
[3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:58.440]  to a hospital and many people are very very frail you expect your parents or grandparents to be
[3:01:58.440 --> 3:02:03.640]  treated with respect and to get all the care necessary you're paying a fortune for that
[3:02:03.640 --> 3:02:08.440]  nursing home coverage as well but you're just assuming they're getting the best care possible
[3:02:08.440 --> 3:02:13.720]  when you go through this as a as a son or a daughter or grandson or granddaughter and here
[3:02:13.720 --> 3:02:21.960]  this governor is taking victory laps for what he did now this order from march 25th also said
[3:02:21.960 --> 3:02:29.000]  nursing homes and adult facilities were quote prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:34.920]  who was determined medically stable to be tested for cova 19 prior to admission or readmission
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:41.000]  so if you know they have the virus you can't turn them away and you can't test them in advance to
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:46.120]  find out if they have been the virus because you can't turn them away so what the hell are you
[3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:50.680]  going to do when you're a nursing home operator or medical director you're you're stuck all these
[3:02:50.680 --> 3:02:54.360]  people you're caring for and many of them become friends they're there some of them are there for
[3:02:54.360 --> 3:03:01.640]  a couple of years you know they're going to be exposed to this unbelievable coma's office told
[3:03:01.640 --> 3:03:07.080]  fox the time that the state department of health regularly updates its website to avoid confusion
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:13.000]  though his office insisted the may 10 order was not a backtrack of its previous order it's unclear
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:17.240]  if coma's office or the state's health department had a role in the removal of the march document
[3:03:17.240 --> 3:03:26.040]  this is so sleazy and then this from the associated press last week new york's true nursing home
[3:03:26.040 --> 3:03:34.840]  death toll cloaked in secrecy you know if the government wasn't doing this if coma was the
[3:03:34.840 --> 3:03:41.880]  head of let's say a massive nursing home conglomeration and he had put out that order to his
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:47.480]  his nursing homes and to the person other work there this man would be up on charges i mean criminal
[3:03:47.480 --> 3:03:54.520]  charges now he takes a victory lap riverdale nursing home and the bronx appears on paper to
[3:03:54.520 --> 3:04:00.600]  have escaped the worst of the coronavirus pandemic when an official state count of just four deaths
[3:04:00.600 --> 3:04:09.640]  in its 146 bed facility the truth though according to the home is far worse 21 dead most transported
[3:04:09.640 --> 3:04:17.080]  to hospitals before they succumbed it was a cascading effect administrator email physio recalled
[3:04:17.720 --> 3:04:23.560]  one after the other new york's coronavirus death toll in nursing homes already among the
[3:04:23.560 --> 3:04:29.800]  highest of the nation could actually be a significant undercount unlike every other state with major
[3:04:29.800 --> 3:04:36.440]  outbreaks every other state new york only counts residents who died on nursing home property not
[3:04:36.440 --> 3:04:44.920]  those who were transported to hospitals and then died that statistic could add thousands
[3:04:44.920 --> 3:04:52.200]  to the state's official care home death toll of just over 6600 but so far the administration
[3:04:52.200 --> 3:04:57.880]  of governor andrew qualma has refused to divulge the number leading to speculation the state is
[3:04:57.880 --> 3:05:03.400]  manipulating the figures to make it appear it's doing much better than the other states and to
[3:05:03.400 --> 3:05:12.680]  make a tragic situation less dire that's a problem bro state senator gustav revered democrat told
[3:05:12.680 --> 3:05:18.280]  new york health commissioner howard zuckers you saw during that legislative session how big a
[3:05:18.280 --> 3:05:23.800]  difference could it make since may federal regulators have requested nursing homes to submit
[3:05:23.800 --> 3:05:30.760]  data on coronavirus deaths every week whether or not residents died in the facility or at a hospital
[3:05:30.760 --> 3:05:36.120]  so in other words the trump administration's trying to get true numbers unlike the qualma
[3:05:36.120 --> 3:05:41.480]  administration because the requirement came after the height of new york's outbreak the available
[3:05:41.480 --> 3:05:47.800]  data is relatively small now they obviously the federal government decided that put in this
[3:05:47.800 --> 3:05:52.440]  rule in place because of qualma because as i read earlier all the other states were already
[3:05:52.440 --> 3:05:58.040]  doing it so qualma wasn't doing it according to the federal data roughly a fifth of the state's
[3:05:58.040 --> 3:06:06.360]  homes reported residents deaths from early june to mid july a tally of 323 dead 65 higher than the
[3:06:06.360 --> 3:06:13.000]  state's count of 195 during that time period even if half that undercount had held true from the
[3:06:13.000 --> 3:06:18.840]  start of the pandemic that would translate into thousands more nursing home resident deaths
[3:06:18.840 --> 3:06:25.080]  than the state has acknowledged let me tell you a little secret i think when this is finally over
[3:06:25.080 --> 3:06:30.120]  and we get the real data these cover-ups sent by qualm when some of these other governors you're
[3:06:30.120 --> 3:06:35.560]  going to find that half of all the people who died as a result of this virus were nursing homes
[3:06:35.560 --> 3:06:43.720]  and assisted living facilities it was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all new
[3:06:43.720 --> 3:06:49.880]  cell phones would track your gps location i read from the federal law and listeners couldn't
[3:06:49.880 --> 3:06:55.800]  believe me because that was unamerican now the media admits that almost every app and every
[3:06:55.800 --> 3:07:01.640]  company that are on apple and androids don't just track your location but your surfing history
[3:07:01.640 --> 3:07:07.720]  where you go who you talk to your relationships and they all share the data with each other of what
[3:07:07.720 --> 3:07:13.560]  you're doing on the apps as well including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying
[3:07:13.560 --> 3:07:19.800]  just like siri or alexa do and then putting databases transcripts of everything you say into
[3:07:19.800 --> 3:07:24.600]  those systems to be saved forever your phone is spying on you and companies are generating
[3:07:24.600 --> 3:07:29.320]  secret surveillance scores based on information this is the global chinese communist social
[3:07:29.320 --> 3:07:35.240]  credit score get your protection privacy pockets at info war store dot com and cut big brother
[3:07:35.240 --> 3:07:42.680]  off dead in his filthy tracks info or store dot com this isn't about me taking credit in fact it's the
[3:07:42.680 --> 3:07:47.880]  opposite it's about getting you to understand that you have all the power going back three weeks
[3:07:47.880 --> 3:07:54.120]  ago they had the entire austin greenbelt shut down and they had the spillway by barton springs
[3:07:54.120 --> 3:08:00.200]  shut down as well as the main pool that's always been paid for the last 50 years or so it's a
[3:08:00.200 --> 3:08:07.560]  damned up spring well we went down there and we got in the park at different areas around town
[3:08:07.560 --> 3:08:12.680]  in the last few weeks and educated people that it was all a giant fraud and now despite the
[3:08:12.680 --> 3:08:17.560]  fact that they still say the parks are closed you get out of any area you'll see dozens if not
[3:08:17.560 --> 3:08:21.960]  hundreds of people depending where you're at actually using barton springs there in austin texas
[3:08:22.600 --> 3:08:27.320]  show bill gates and the globalists give the orders to you and the un gives the orders
[3:08:27.320 --> 3:08:32.440]  down through the national health services like our nih and we all follow it like dutiful slaves
[3:08:32.440 --> 3:08:38.600]  stop complying with your own enslavement stop following the orders of these globalist traders
[3:08:38.600 --> 3:08:39.640]  start being free again
[3:08:39.640 --> 3:08:56.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:59.960 --> 3:09:07.080]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're listening to the alex jones
[3:09:07.080 --> 3:09:18.440]  show and now your host john rapaport okay here we are again another meeting
[3:09:20.360 --> 3:09:27.560]  and big news very big news several major developments that i want to go over in
[3:09:27.560 --> 3:09:39.960]  uh detail because we have to because it's real because things are happening in all sorts of
[3:09:40.920 --> 3:09:44.040]  strange ways so let's start with this
[3:09:44.040 --> 3:09:55.080]  the cdc quietly released numbers about cova deaths in the u.s
[3:09:57.560 --> 3:10:02.840]  and basically what the numbers and the comments revealed was
[3:10:05.480 --> 3:10:10.440]  that out of let's call it 161 000 deaths something on that order
[3:10:10.440 --> 3:10:22.360]  actually six percent about 9 000 deaths could be attributed to only the virus
[3:10:24.840 --> 3:10:28.920]  94 percent of those reported cova deaths
[3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:40.040]  were in people elderly people who had several prior serious medical conditions
[3:10:43.400 --> 3:10:47.080]  this is a bombshell a gigantic bombshell
[3:10:50.520 --> 3:10:58.280]  it speaks to the possibility actually that there is some sort of an interagency war going on
[3:10:58.280 --> 3:11:09.960]  between the cdc and maybe nih maybe even fauci who knows cdc has been backed into a corner several
[3:11:09.960 --> 3:11:22.280]  times during this covet insanity and they haven't liked how it feels we'll see about that but i
[3:11:22.280 --> 3:11:29.960]  want to explain what this revelation means in terms of the numbers so on
[3:11:32.440 --> 3:11:41.720]  first of all the cover story on this is yes we had 94 percent of these deaths were in elderly
[3:11:41.720 --> 3:11:49.400]  people that had serious prior medical conditions but the actual cause of death is still the virus
[3:11:49.400 --> 3:12:04.200]  SARS-CoV-2 oloni oloni thick cut oloni that's part of the cover the truth of the matter is
[3:12:05.880 --> 3:12:15.640]  here's what causes these people to die they're elderly they're delicate they're vulnerable
[3:12:15.640 --> 3:12:23.480]  physically and psychologically they have serious health conditions going back years even decades
[3:12:24.440 --> 3:12:29.160]  they've been treated for years decades with toxic medical drugs
[3:12:31.080 --> 3:12:38.360]  they are terrified of being diagnosed with COVID-19 for all that they've been hearing about it
[3:12:38.360 --> 3:12:46.280]  and then they are diagnosed with COVID-19 on no basis whatsoever a phony test
[3:12:47.800 --> 3:12:54.920]  and then to top it all off they are isolated and completely cut off from family and friends
[3:12:57.640 --> 3:13:06.200]  alone some of them even put on ventilators breathing ventilators and they die
[3:13:06.200 --> 3:13:09.960]  they check out they die they go
[3:13:13.240 --> 3:13:18.360]  no virus required no virus necessary
[3:13:21.160 --> 3:13:24.440]  what i've just explained is all you need
[3:13:26.760 --> 3:13:32.440]  and you don't even need the ventilators which are killers in another cell
[3:13:32.440 --> 3:13:46.520]  so for the CDC to admit that 94 percent of COVID deaths the official number in the U.S.
[3:13:48.360 --> 3:13:56.360]  really occurred in the elderly who have several prior serious medical conditions
[3:13:56.360 --> 3:14:01.960]  is tantamount to an admission that the entire thing is a complete hoax
[3:14:04.120 --> 3:14:10.920]  the entire virus story the entire COVID fear porn the entire COVID operation
[3:14:11.800 --> 3:14:21.800]  the entire lockdown the entire social distancing the masks the isolation the quarantines the
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:32.360]  economic destruction all a complete and utter fabrication hoax based on nothing
[3:14:33.640 --> 3:14:41.960]  as in nothing that's the takeaway that's the revelation if you understand it and go below
[3:14:41.960 --> 3:14:49.880]  the surface it's very important to grasp this because the propaganda will give you
[3:14:49.880 --> 3:14:57.000]  you time and time and time again no no no no no no yes it's the elderly and they have
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:15:03.080]  prior medical conditions but they are uniquely susceptible to the virus and the virus is
[3:15:03.080 --> 3:15:09.400]  actually killing them anyway blah blah blah blah wrong wrong wrong wrong
[3:15:09.400 --> 3:15:20.360]  wrong nonsense complete crap irrelevant
[3:15:20.360 --> 3:15:29.720]  so you can take the death figures for COVID in the United States thus far and you can
[3:15:29.720 --> 3:15:41.560]  chop off 94 percent of those and you would end up with roughly 9 000 instead of 160 000
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:51.080]  9 000 does not a pandemic make does not an epidemic make and of course as many of you know
[3:15:51.080 --> 3:15:57.160]  and my readers know i would take it much further than that because for the last several months
[3:15:57.160 --> 3:16:03.960]  i've been offering compelling evidence that they never isolated or purified or discovered a new
[3:16:03.960 --> 3:16:10.680]  virus in the first place that's another whole issue which i've gone over many times on the show here
[3:16:11.800 --> 3:16:21.720]  for now we're putting that to the side based on the official cdc admission and the truth
[3:16:21.720 --> 3:16:33.320]  you could say in the united states 9 000 COVID-19 deaths by official statistics
[3:16:35.560 --> 3:16:43.560]  that's not a bad flu season that's not a severe flu season that's not an ordinary flu season
[3:16:43.560 --> 3:16:55.400]  again by official numbers that's a very minor flu season that's no reason to do anything but go
[3:16:55.400 --> 3:17:04.840]  about your life your work your business the whole deal utterly incredible
[3:17:04.840 --> 3:17:18.920]  confession from the cdc it's been reported but always with these conditions and obscuring
[3:17:18.920 --> 3:17:25.800]  and so forth and we give you this we take that away we admit that we don't admit this all of
[3:17:25.800 --> 3:17:34.040]  that insanity that's just the first gigantic development this week there's more and i'll
[3:17:34.040 --> 3:17:41.240]  give it to you after the break don't go anywhere the social engineers bet on you not having a memory
[3:17:41.240 --> 3:17:45.640]  more than anything and they also bet because they constantly talk about it in their own words
[3:17:45.640 --> 3:17:51.400]  that you will adapt to being a slave that you will learn incrementally to submit so think about
[3:17:51.400 --> 3:17:57.240]  and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud remember that everything he said has been a premeditated
[3:17:57.240 --> 3:18:03.080]  lie they lied about where it came from they lied about person to person the un covered it all up
[3:18:03.080 --> 3:18:11.320]  then exaggerated the death rate at four percent but it's actually 0.032 now and dropping then they
[3:18:11.320 --> 3:18:16.120]  set the test up to count almost all false positives they put the names of people that died of other
[3:18:16.120 --> 3:18:21.480]  diseases in the covet column they only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown now we're six months later
[3:18:21.480 --> 3:18:26.040]  now they say it's permanent you got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations are coming and
[3:18:26.040 --> 3:18:30.120]  they're going to track everywhere you go and what you do the global social credit score and the un is
[3:18:30.120 --> 3:18:35.000]  the boss anybody questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job that's called 24
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:39.880]  century tyranny that's called world government takeover constantly whether it's the new york
[3:18:39.880 --> 3:18:44.840]  times the washington post or howard stern of a blue name and they come out and they attack him full
[3:18:44.840 --> 3:18:51.160]  war saying jones claims civil wars coming and financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using
[3:18:51.160 --> 3:18:56.680]  viruses and he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have horrible food
[3:18:56.680 --> 3:19:02.120]  if they can and now everything i've warned people about is coming true because it was all in the
[3:19:02.120 --> 3:19:08.440]  rockefeller foundation documents like lockstep this is the corporate planetary takeover so
[3:19:08.440 --> 3:19:13.960]  yes i stand by what i said 10 years ago what i said a year ago and what i said last week more than
[3:19:13.960 --> 3:19:19.480]  ever get your high quality storeable foods at info or store.com that's one of the key check marks of
[3:19:19.480 --> 3:19:24.760]  the check boxes you've got to have checked off info or store.com and their delivery is now
[3:19:24.760 --> 3:19:30.760]  one to two weeks get it before the next big rush comes take action get the best horrible food at
[3:19:30.760 --> 3:19:39.240]  the best price now at info or store.com and it supports the info war attention attention attention
[3:19:39.240 --> 3:19:45.560]  to anyone that still wants to live in a free country the new world order chi-com globalist syndicate
[3:19:45.560 --> 3:19:50.840]  is making its move to implode the dollar and thrust the united states into a civil war by
[3:19:50.840 --> 3:19:55.480]  contesting the election they are openly work ending this at the highest levels of democratic
[3:19:55.480 --> 3:20:00.680]  party nancy polosi and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election
[3:20:00.680 --> 3:20:06.680]  prep is going they will hold a separate inauguration for biden and kamala harris and that anyone
[3:20:06.680 --> 3:20:11.240]  challenging that will be called a racist they will then trigger race riots and violence they've
[3:20:11.240 --> 3:20:17.560]  already beta tested around the country we are not living in normal times when these type of things
[3:20:17.560 --> 3:20:22.200]  happen history people are usually caught flat footed because they can't believe they're living
[3:20:22.200 --> 3:20:28.040]  in such a criminal era we are we are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate
[3:20:28.040 --> 3:20:33.240]  that's been feeding on america is being exposed and removed now is the time for all good men and
[3:20:33.240 --> 3:20:42.360]  women to come to their aid of the country spread the word now paul reveres you're listening to the
[3:20:42.360 --> 3:20:54.680]  alex jones show
[3:20:58.600 --> 3:21:05.800]  okay we're back second gigantic development this week this is out of the new york times
[3:21:05.800 --> 3:21:17.560]  up to 90 percent of all people who have tested positive for the virus
[3:21:19.880 --> 3:21:29.880]  are false positive that's the beginning of that article and the reason that the times gives and
[3:21:29.880 --> 3:21:39.400]  they quote various public health experts and so on is because quote the amount of virus found in
[3:21:39.400 --> 3:21:49.560]  the bodies of these people is so infinitesimal that it couldn't possibly do that person or a
[3:21:49.560 --> 3:22:00.200]  flea any harm and it wouldn't be it would not be contagious from person to person that's in the
[3:22:00.200 --> 3:22:12.600]  times article right there up to 90 percent and this means case numbers we're talking about because
[3:22:12.600 --> 3:22:25.320]  a positive test for the virus the pcr test translates into case number same idea same definition
[3:22:27.960 --> 3:22:36.440]  but now it's like wait a minute you could subtract 90 percent of all the cases
[3:22:36.440 --> 3:22:47.160]  based on positive tests and then you would be left with 10 percent which you would then call
[3:22:48.520 --> 3:23:01.080]  actual cases another stunning revelation another chop down fantastic chop down of
[3:23:01.080 --> 3:23:10.200]  percentages and numbers that leave the story completely crippled the covert off crippled
[3:23:10.920 --> 3:23:18.920]  the fakery crippled now of course what the times does from that point on in the story
[3:23:18.920 --> 3:23:31.240]  is turned right around and say the solution is more testing of course town hall website pointed
[3:23:31.240 --> 3:23:42.680]  this out more testing better testing and so on and so forth now there are levels below this that
[3:23:42.680 --> 3:23:51.560]  we can probe into about the test what are we talking about here actually the test is not
[3:23:51.560 --> 3:24:00.520]  even testing for a virus at all infinitesimal amounts larger amounts little amounts medium
[3:24:00.520 --> 3:24:11.240]  amounts forget it the test is based on RNA which is assumed to be part of a virus but not proven
[3:24:11.240 --> 3:24:22.280]  proven ever so that takes us even further from the truth much further and as the times actually
[3:24:22.280 --> 3:24:28.600]  reveals if you read far enough in the article although it does it in a pretty muddy fashion
[3:24:30.040 --> 3:24:35.640]  the mechanism of doing this pcr test which is rather complicated
[3:24:35.640 --> 3:24:46.360]  it gives you whatever you want to get you do enough what's called cycles of the test
[3:24:47.160 --> 3:24:55.320]  where you keep on amplifying these infinitesimal amounts of whatever you'll get all kinds of
[3:24:55.320 --> 3:25:02.360]  results from that oh we didn't see this we didn't see that we didn't see this much in the same way
[3:25:02.360 --> 3:25:08.680]  that if you were to take an ordinary photograph and say blow it up 100 million times you would begin
[3:25:08.680 --> 3:25:14.520]  to see what is that and hey hey what is this little thing floating around it becomes meaningless
[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:20.280]  at which point you could say pretty much we found anything we want to
[3:25:20.280 --> 3:25:31.480]  do including a virus or whatever in the amplified test the test is a sham a scam
[3:25:32.280 --> 3:25:39.160]  i've approached it 19 different ways and proved it over and over again the test itself
[3:25:40.040 --> 3:25:48.920]  has never been validated for its use as a diagnostic tool the inventor of the test
[3:25:48.920 --> 3:25:55.960]  Carrie Mullis who won a Nobel Prize for it said that it should not be used as a diagnostic tool
[3:25:55.960 --> 3:26:05.080]  in disease the kind of large coherent study that should have been done before the pcr test
[3:26:05.080 --> 3:26:11.320]  was ever approved for public use was never done in fact there were several types of studies that
[3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:18.920]  should have been done one for instance to show what happens if you take a test sample from a patient
[3:26:18.920 --> 3:26:27.480]  and you send it to 50 different labs each of which does their own pcr test are you going
[3:26:27.480 --> 3:26:34.760]  to get back the same results from all 50 labs are you going to get back 15 different results
[3:26:34.760 --> 3:26:41.640]  30 different results 42 different results that large study has never been done
[3:26:42.840 --> 3:26:49.720]  with say a thousand patients and tissue samples from each one and 50 different labs never done
[3:26:51.640 --> 3:26:59.640]  another large study on the pcr test that has never been done never will be done is its ability to
[3:26:59.640 --> 3:27:08.920]  predict who is sick or who will get sick large-scale study never been done i've outlined how it could
[3:27:08.920 --> 3:27:15.400]  be done in the real world not in the lab using again a thousand patients you take samples from each
[3:27:15.400 --> 3:27:24.520]  one and you say to the lab now tell us which patients have huge amounts of virus in their
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:33.560]  bodies because they will surely be sick that's supposedly how you get sick with millions or
[3:27:33.560 --> 3:27:40.520]  even billions of virus actually actually replicating in the body and then the lab would come back and
[3:27:40.520 --> 3:27:49.640]  say okay patient number 23 46 52 187 326 they are all very sick because they all have huge amounts
[3:27:49.640 --> 3:27:57.400]  of virus in their body now you unblind those patients are they indeed sick or are they running
[3:27:57.400 --> 3:28:04.680]  marathons and swimming across the english channel let's find out large-scale study like that on say
[3:28:04.680 --> 3:28:11.960]  a thousand patients never been done never will be done why because the people who are making
[3:28:11.960 --> 3:28:20.280]  money off the test and using the test to frighten the population and do fakes numbers of covet
[3:28:21.640 --> 3:28:29.800]  victims don't want the truth to be known these are just some of the issues that underlie the
[3:28:29.800 --> 3:28:37.960]  times article which they don't want to get into but they say enough in the opening paragraphs of
[3:28:37.960 --> 3:28:48.840]  the article that up to 90 percent of all people who have been diagnosed with covet in the u.s as
[3:28:48.840 --> 3:29:06.600]  a result of these tests are false positive 90 percent leaving by their estimate 10 percent
[3:29:06.600 --> 3:29:18.200]  of the figure that we've been fed i mean that is completely outrageous and there it is in black
[3:29:18.200 --> 3:29:27.800]  and white i've quoted it from the times so now take the two revelations that i've explained here
[3:29:27.800 --> 3:29:38.920]  the fake covet death numbers it's really only six percent of the actual figure of the official
[3:29:38.920 --> 3:29:49.560]  figure and the times revelation that up to 90 percent of all covet cases are false positive
[3:29:49.560 --> 3:30:01.480]  they're not real cases and from those two revelations alone what would any sane person conclude if
[3:30:01.480 --> 3:30:10.600]  they knew nothing else it's over it's done it's finished whatever we were calling this pandemic
[3:30:10.600 --> 3:30:19.400]  epidemic outbreak whatever it's over it's finished come out outdoors no more lockdowns no more
[3:30:19.400 --> 3:30:27.880]  masks no more distancing go back to work the economy's wide open no more regulations no more
[3:30:27.880 --> 3:30:34.120]  crap no more insanity no more new world order backed after the break
[3:30:37.800 --> 3:30:42.920]  the democrats are just going more and more left many positive about socialism liking it more than
[3:30:42.920 --> 3:30:50.680]  capitalism many of the ideas we fought for that were considered radical on now mainstream the radical
[3:30:50.680 --> 3:30:57.640]  left has taken over the democratic party and joe biden is marching in lockstep with them biden and
[3:30:57.640 --> 3:31:03.720]  the far left are promising to crush middle-class families with trillions in new taxes if you elect
[3:31:03.720 --> 3:31:09.080]  me your taxes are going to be raised not cut promising amnesty and health care for 11 million
[3:31:09.080 --> 3:31:15.240]  illegal immigrants citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks promising to shut down energy
[3:31:15.240 --> 3:31:22.120]  exploration killing jobs and hurting america's economy i guarantee we're gonna end fossil fuel
[3:31:22.120 --> 3:31:28.840]  in joe biden's america the radical left get whatever they want and you get to pay for it
[3:31:28.840 --> 3:31:35.160]  they've already taken over joe biden and the democratic party don't let them take over america
[3:31:35.160 --> 3:31:47.160]  there's a nauseating sense to it not a sense of triumph not a sense of victory not a sense of
[3:31:47.800 --> 3:31:55.240]  completion the sense of sixth nausea though we were right about the world government we were
[3:31:55.240 --> 3:32:01.320]  right about the anti-human plans we were right about all the horrible things the globalists
[3:32:01.320 --> 3:32:09.160]  and their satanic order wanted us now we sit here warning people for decades trying to get
[3:32:09.160 --> 3:32:15.720]  people ready trying to stop what was coming but you know what revelations and god's word says
[3:32:15.720 --> 3:32:20.200]  it's coming so you can't stop it and it's in that understanding that we're part of guards larger
[3:32:20.200 --> 3:32:27.800]  plan than he come to the point in our own psyche our own spirit our own will that we submit to god
[3:32:27.800 --> 3:32:34.600]  and realize god's in charge god has power and the devil is set as a tester and now it's up to us
[3:32:34.600 --> 3:32:40.520]  to make the right decision that's what's really always been about i'm not gonna lie to you i want
[3:32:40.520 --> 3:32:45.400]  to stay in the fight against soros and hillary and the new world order and the only way i do
[3:32:45.400 --> 3:32:51.160]  is if you buy a lot of products at info or short.com you gotta sell a lot of vitamins and a lot of

[3:34:28.360 --> 3:34:34.760]  defiance of george soros the globalist hillary and all these compacts so great job you built what
[3:34:34.760 --> 3:35:04.200]  we've done you're listening to the alex jones show news analysis reports it's the alex jones
[3:35:04.200 --> 3:35:16.200]  show and now your host john rabba boy third big time story of the past week
[3:35:18.760 --> 3:35:27.320]  someone discovered this goes back to the pcr test again test covid test
[3:35:27.320 --> 3:35:36.600]  that one of the so-called primers and i'll try to explain that minute used in the test
[3:35:38.360 --> 3:35:49.480]  is a section of dna that is identical to a little sequence of dna present in apparently all humans
[3:35:49.480 --> 3:36:01.640]  it's just there so the implication of that would be that the test would simply be testing for
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:10.040]  a bit of human dna that's already there and everybody and if it registers positive that's
[3:36:10.040 --> 3:36:21.480]  what it's registering positive about boom recently watched an interview done by javadike
[3:36:21.480 --> 3:36:31.320]  with dr andrew kauffman in which kauffman said yes he verified this that is so and apparently this
[3:36:31.320 --> 3:36:36.680]  is a world health organization pcr test you have to understand there's about
[3:36:36.680 --> 3:36:45.560]  about at last count from what i've been told about 33 different pcr tests that are being
[3:36:45.560 --> 3:36:55.080]  used around the world the world health organization has their test so my first question was
[3:36:56.680 --> 3:37:03.560]  to myself and to anybody who wanted to try to answer it so you mean that anybody who's tested
[3:37:03.560 --> 3:37:08.680]  using the world health organization test is automatically going to test positive for the
[3:37:08.680 --> 3:37:15.640]  virus because it's just registering on this piece of human dna that's already in everybody
[3:37:18.840 --> 3:37:27.480]  and so i've been going back and forth with that because that's a bit dangerous in other words
[3:37:27.480 --> 3:37:34.600]  for the well world health organization to risk being discovered using a test that would be 100
[3:37:34.600 --> 3:37:43.880]  percent positive on everybody so how could they manipulate and rig and slide and slither and slip
[3:37:43.880 --> 3:37:50.280]  and slide in order to make things work out for them well there are several ways and i'll just
[3:37:50.280 --> 3:37:57.160]  mention one of them and that would be for example suppose the world health organization
[3:37:57.160 --> 3:38:05.320]  has four or five different pcr tests and they kind of mix and mingle them all together under one
[3:38:05.320 --> 3:38:14.920]  basic umbrella label so it looks like it's only one test but it's actually several and in one of
[3:38:14.920 --> 3:38:25.560]  those they use this little piece of dna which is called a primer it helps in amplifying the test
[3:38:25.560 --> 3:38:35.320]  sample that they're they're using it's part of the process of amplification and in that particular
[3:38:35.320 --> 3:38:46.680]  test people will test positive they hide out they obfuscate they obscure etc etc there's
[3:38:46.680 --> 3:38:56.680]  more to be learned about this but it's another giant revelation that a test could actually be
[3:38:57.720 --> 3:39:07.480]  looking for melding with registering positive on a piece of human dna that's in everybody
[3:39:07.480 --> 3:39:18.520]  that has nothing to do with disease that's just part of the deal of being human yeah
[3:39:19.480 --> 3:39:28.120]  amazing stuff this week another giant rally in berlin huge numbers of people robert of
[3:39:28.120 --> 3:39:37.640]  kennedy jr addressed the crowd big rally in london trefalgar square david ike talked among others
[3:39:38.680 --> 3:39:49.240]  fantastic work on the part of the organizers the speakers yeah i watched a long video of this
[3:39:50.120 --> 3:39:55.640]  as first i thought oh jeez it looks like there's only a hundred people there maybe 50 whatever
[3:39:55.640 --> 3:40:01.320]  and i kept on moving ahead moving ahead and the crowd kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger
[3:40:01.320 --> 3:40:08.760]  and bigger and bigger there's david for those of you watching a rousing great talk
[3:40:12.040 --> 3:40:17.720]  ended with freedom that's what we're talking about freedom
[3:40:17.720 --> 3:40:27.080]  so all the data that i've been giving you here and the analysis of that data is all based
[3:40:27.720 --> 3:40:30.040]  on showing that the whole thing is a charade
[3:40:32.360 --> 3:40:39.640]  from the beginning it was a charade it was a con a hustle a tap dance a plan
[3:40:39.640 --> 3:40:50.280]  and put in place as a bridge as a gateway to take us into another age another era another
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:41:00.840]  world a world invented for us not the world you want not the world i want not the world you
[3:41:00.840 --> 3:41:10.840]  want to imagine and invent and live not the world i want to invent imagine and live their creation
[3:41:12.040 --> 3:41:23.000]  globalist creation technocratic creation imposed upon us under the pretext that things have gotten
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:28.600]  so bad that we can never go back to the way it was and we have to have global governance and no more
[3:41:28.600 --> 3:41:35.800]  borders and we have to have top-down control to make sure that we don't have another horrible
[3:41:35.800 --> 3:41:42.600]  worldwide pandemic that means real-time surveillance wall-to-wall of the entire planet
[3:41:45.480 --> 3:41:48.680]  china which is the model for all of this
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:56.200]  is now in the process and i've mentioned this on the show before but i'll mention it again because
[3:41:56.200 --> 3:42:06.120]  it bears understanding their objective as announced by the top of the regime in china
[3:42:07.800 --> 3:42:19.000]  is to have real-time surveillance of every inch of the country indoors outdoors all the time
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:28.440]  can you grasp that and this is not just some oh yeah we'd like to have no this is a program
[3:42:29.080 --> 3:42:39.880]  this is a priority this is a gigantic expanding infrastructure of government attached institutes
[3:42:39.880 --> 3:42:53.320]  and companies in china working to achieve this that's the model to know in real time what is
[3:42:53.320 --> 3:43:02.680]  happening who's doing what who's saying what everything that can be learned about what is
[3:43:02.680 --> 3:43:10.040]  going on in every inch of square space inside outdoors in all of china
[3:43:14.040 --> 3:43:21.720]  a panopticon effect not just from one point of view but from so many different vectors which
[3:43:21.720 --> 3:43:31.800]  would be cameras swarms of drones some of which are disguised as dubs with cameras and so on and so
[3:43:31.800 --> 3:43:41.400]  forth all manner of this kind of surveillance including sensors that would be placed inside
[3:43:41.400 --> 3:43:48.520]  the body to report out real-time physiological data on changes happening in the body and brain
[3:43:48.520 --> 3:44:02.280]  all of this registered recorded observed in real time and the biggest job of all
[3:44:02.280 --> 3:44:20.840]  to collate it organize it into profiles of everybody and use it use it for social credit
[3:44:20.840 --> 3:44:29.240]  for control for behavior modification for surveillance for pre-knowledge and free prediction
[3:44:29.240 --> 3:44:40.280]  of what people are going to do this is all announced i'm not giving you something that is
[3:44:40.280 --> 3:44:49.240]  you know in secret files this is all there to be known to be seen and it is the model and china is
[3:44:49.240 --> 3:45:01.480]  already exporting this model to other countries pieces of it they love to do this for example in
[3:45:01.480 --> 3:45:07.560]  impoverished countries and chaos rich countries where they can say to the government we know you
[3:45:07.560 --> 3:45:15.320]  can't afford what we have to sell you but we'll make a deal with you a draconian deal this is
[3:45:15.320 --> 3:45:22.520]  just the beginning of understanding all of this but i wanted to include this at the end of today
[3:45:22.520 --> 3:45:46.840]  many thanks
