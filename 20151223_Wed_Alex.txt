[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:29.120]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host on this Wednesday December 23rd 2015
[00:29.120 --> 00:34.680]  Christmas is getting close and we have a literal war on Christmas we've got Brunei
[00:34.680 --> 00:39.960]  which has just come under Sharia law according to the Sultan of Brunei he is
[00:39.960 --> 00:44.120]  having a war on Christmas we're going to talk about that of course the war on
[00:44.120 --> 00:50.080]  drugs is still with us and we've got a war on drugs war on Christmas case where
[00:50.080 --> 00:56.960]  family's home is literally torn apart as the police first created a siege looking
[00:56.960 --> 01:01.880]  for a non-existent person that was not at the house and then proceeded in their
[01:01.880 --> 01:07.120]  frustration and anger to completely demolish that house the TSA if you're
[01:07.120 --> 01:12.120]  traveling the TSA has now quietly announced that they are going to do
[01:12.120 --> 01:17.160]  away with your opt-out capabilities of course since they put in the naked body
[01:17.160 --> 01:23.480]  scanners as a way to modify the public's concerns they said well we'll let you
[01:23.480 --> 01:27.640]  opt-out we know if you want to you can either let us take naked pictures of you
[01:27.640 --> 01:32.160]  or we can pat you down and touch you okay so you had your choice as to what
[01:32.160 --> 01:35.840]  you wanted to do now they're going to say well we're not going to give you that
[01:35.840 --> 01:41.240]  choice anymore see that's the way this always rolls it's a gradual incremental
[01:41.240 --> 01:46.720]  movement against your liberty and so now that's going away we see that in
[01:46.720 --> 01:51.480]  Virginia the Attorney General there has announced that he is going to stop
[01:51.480 --> 01:56.440]  recognizing concealed carry gun permits from 25 states so we're going to talk
[01:56.440 --> 02:00.680]  about what's going on with that as well as a pushback on it and we have a story
[02:00.680 --> 02:05.200]  that we're going to focus on first today that is the story that Alex talked
[02:05.200 --> 02:07.640]  about a bit yesterday we have a lot more information about it today we're
[02:07.640 --> 02:11.440]  going to play you a couple of videos about what's going on in China of course
[02:11.440 --> 02:15.760]  China has incrementally isn't it interesting how the tyranny always
[02:15.760 --> 02:21.720]  works incrementally they have incrementally been exercising control over
[02:21.720 --> 02:26.680]  the Internet they see that as one of their greatest problems and they're
[02:26.680 --> 02:32.680]  right about that they've identified something that is really a threat to
[02:32.680 --> 02:37.640]  their lives and of course this goes back to real concerns go back to 2011 there
[02:37.640 --> 02:41.000]  was a train wreck in China the government was telling everybody one story
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.040]  and then eyewitnesses started telling a very different story an embarrassing
[02:46.040 --> 02:49.640]  story to the Chinese government at that point they got very serious about
[02:49.640 --> 02:54.560]  cracking down on social media they created the great firewall of China as
[02:54.560 --> 03:00.240]  many experts in the rest of the world call it the great firewall essentially
[03:00.240 --> 03:05.520]  shutting down communication from certain sites shutting down communication from
[03:05.520 --> 03:09.000]  certain areas that's not good enough for them though they're going to take the
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.520]  next step and what they're doing is they're introducing a kind of gaming
[03:13.520 --> 03:17.040]  approach they're making a game out of it this is all very fun isn't it you're
[03:17.040 --> 03:20.880]  going to go to alibaba you're going to get your sesame credit score I guess it's
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.760]  kind of like you know open sesame now it's really like the sesame seed the
[03:25.760 --> 03:31.000]  sesame credit and what they will do is give you some credit scores based on
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.640]  first what kind of merchandise you buy very different from what they're doing
[03:35.640 --> 03:40.120]  here in the United States United States you get credit it is based on your
[03:40.120 --> 03:44.160]  credit scores based on how you use that credit how you pay it back in other
[03:44.160 --> 03:47.680]  words but there they're going to be looking at what you buy but more
[03:47.680 --> 03:52.080]  importantly they're going to be looking at what you say and what your friends
[03:52.080 --> 03:57.080]  say now in the United States they're a little bit behind that aren't we we're
[03:57.080 --> 04:01.880]  just at the point of outlawing privacy and encryption there was a lot of push
[04:01.880 --> 04:07.680]  back against Apple's CEO Tim Cook he's talked about this back in June saying
[04:07.680 --> 04:13.000]  that they were going to put encryption on everything Apple has a lot to prove
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.760]  to the American public especially after some of the Snowden leaks especially
[04:16.760 --> 04:22.600]  after the NSA bragged that the iPhone was big brother and that who would have
[04:22.600 --> 04:28.800]  thought in 1984 when Steve Jobs was running that famous Mac commercial the
[04:28.800 --> 04:33.040]  very first commercial where they use 1984 they said who would have thought in
[04:33.040 --> 04:37.640]  1984 that this the iPhone would be big brother and that the zombies would line
[04:37.640 --> 04:41.920]  up to pay for it so they have a real state to try to prove to the public
[04:41.920 --> 04:44.600]  whether it's true or not that they're going to try to protect your data so
[04:44.600 --> 04:48.480]  we're going to talk about encryption privacy and third-party information a
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.280]  lot to cover today Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the second hour stay

[05:21.080 --> 05:25.000]  people of color perpetuates the idea that white is naturally good and that
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.400]  other colors are bad and we feel that that's a that's a microaggression here's

[08:34.080 --> 08:38.780]  second hour will be alex jones he'll be coming in to talk especially about this
[08:38.780 --> 08:43.560]  story about what's happening in China there's a great deal of things to look
[08:43.560 --> 08:47.400]  at this incremental tyranny that is rolling out in China and that's the
[08:47.400 --> 08:50.800]  first article we're gonna talk about we've got a article up on the dredge
[08:50.800 --> 08:53.960]  report by Paul Joseph Watson we're gonna unpack that for you but we have a lot
[08:53.960 --> 08:58.040]  of different articles we're gonna talk about a related issue which came to the
[08:58.040 --> 09:03.280]  forefront again this last Sunday on 60 minutes apples CEO Tim Cook was on 60
[09:03.280 --> 09:06.960]  minutes and he was talking about encryption and privacy and immediately
[09:06.960 --> 09:12.160]  he got a lot of pushback from a senator he got a pushback from a state attorney
[09:12.160 --> 09:17.240]  general very angry that anybody in this day and age in America should think that
[09:17.240 --> 09:22.440]  they would have privacy or encryption only criminals have that were told only
[09:22.440 --> 09:28.200]  criminals only and they literally said only drug dealers child pornographers
[09:28.200 --> 09:32.480]  and terrorists would have privacy maybe that explains why the federal
[09:32.480 --> 09:36.720]  government wants it so badly because they fit all three of those categories
[09:36.720 --> 09:40.640]  and we'll talk about that as well now evangelist Franklin Graham says he's
[09:40.640 --> 09:45.120]  going to quit the Republican Party he's angry that they have funded Planned
[09:45.120 --> 09:50.680]  Parenthood and of course that's part of the omnibus bill the bill that funds
[09:50.680 --> 09:55.840]  everything and makes the country go bust the bill that betrayed Republican
[09:55.840 --> 09:59.280]  principle replayed not Republican principles okay I don't know the
[09:59.280 --> 10:04.280]  Republicans have any principles okay it betrayed the wishes of the Republican
[10:04.280 --> 10:09.840]  voters and so he's he's fed up with that he's spoke well of Donald Trump he
[10:09.840 --> 10:14.080]  wants to see outsiders come in and you know I think that's a very important part
[10:14.080 --> 10:20.320]  of the Trump campaign if the GOP establishment wants to try to go to a
[10:20.320 --> 10:26.360]  brokered rigged convention then he could very well run third party he could do
[10:26.360 --> 10:30.040]  very well if he got a position on the libertarian party ballot I know they're
[10:30.040 --> 10:33.640]  going to have their convention before that but they could very easily change
[10:33.640 --> 10:38.080]  that after the fact I believe nevertheless whether or not he would run
[10:38.080 --> 10:43.800]  third party that is really really going to be the final straw for the American
[10:43.800 --> 10:49.080]  public to realize the total fraud of the system so if the GOP wants to rig that
[10:49.080 --> 10:54.160]  convention I'd say yeah you feel lucky punk go ahead make my day I'd like to see
[10:54.160 --> 10:57.400]  the fireworks when that happens we're also going to be talking about the TSA
[10:57.400 --> 11:02.320]  they're now saying that they can force you through a body scanner they're going
[11:02.320 --> 11:05.840]  to radiate you they're gonna take naked pictures of you know in the past they
[11:05.840 --> 11:09.800]  were very accommodating they said well we'll either take naked pictures of you
[11:09.800 --> 11:13.680]  or we'll feel you up now they're not going to give you the feel you up option
[11:13.680 --> 11:18.600]  they're just going to force you to be irradiated that's how this all works it's
[11:18.600 --> 11:24.520]  a gradual process they gradually get you acclimated to it and that brings us
[11:24.520 --> 11:29.640]  back to the gradual acclimation of the control of the Internet so I was
[11:29.640 --> 11:34.440]  pointing out to people who are the last segment China's move to try to a sense of
[11:34.440 --> 11:39.200]  the Internet began in small steps but it initially took its first step in
[11:39.200 --> 11:45.880]  earnest I think most people would say after this massive issue in 2011 they
[11:45.880 --> 11:49.560]  had a train wreck there was one story from the government their official story
[11:49.560 --> 11:54.840]  there was a different story that surfaced on social media very embarrassing
[11:54.840 --> 11:59.600]  to the Chinese government to be caught lying to the people who would think that
[11:59.600 --> 12:04.560]  a government would lie to its people that was shocking shocking but it was
[12:04.560 --> 12:08.320]  shocking for the Chinese and I can tell you I mentioned it yesterday in the
[12:08.320 --> 12:13.200]  fourth hour when we adopted my daughter from China she was given a letter by the
[12:13.200 --> 12:16.960]  foster home that she had been in for about six months before we adopted her
[12:16.960 --> 12:21.280]  she'd been in an orphanage for several years prior to that and you know it was
[12:21.280 --> 12:25.360]  we got it translated and it said you know obey your government be a good
[12:25.360 --> 12:29.160]  servant to your government that's the attitude of the Chinese people you know
[12:29.160 --> 12:32.640]  that's an attitude a lot of people in America have I keep hearing people
[12:32.640 --> 12:37.760]  repeat that that thing that JFK said you know that's not what you can do for
[12:37.760 --> 12:41.680]  your country as what your country can do for you rather ask what you can do for
[12:41.680 --> 12:46.040]  your country well you know that's fine at one level but you have to understand
[12:46.040 --> 12:51.040]  that the purpose of government is to serve the people it's not the people's
[12:51.040 --> 12:55.400]  purpose to be servants of the government you understand that's a Chinese
[12:55.400 --> 13:01.280]  communist attitude that's a slaves attitude that I am here to serve the
[13:01.280 --> 13:05.600]  government no I am not here to serve the government the government is here to
[13:05.600 --> 13:09.680]  serve me that is what the Declaration of Independence was about
[13:09.680 --> 13:15.240]  governments are instituted instituted amongst men to protect our God given
[13:15.240 --> 13:20.000]  natural rights that's why we have governments when governments become
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.960]  destructive of those rights it is our duty to change that government not only
[13:26.960 --> 13:31.800]  our right but our duty to alter or abolish that government that's what
[13:31.800 --> 13:36.520]  this country was founded upon that's the opening paragraph of the Declaration of
[13:36.520 --> 13:39.960]  Independence in case they haven't taught that to you in school because they're
[13:39.960 --> 13:44.000]  too busy telling you about white privilege and microaggressions they
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  don't talk about the Declaration of Independence and when I was in school they
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.080]  had us memorize the first half of the paragraph about how we have life
[13:51.080 --> 13:54.880]  liberty in the pursuit of happiness but they didn't want us to memorize that
[13:54.880 --> 13:59.960]  second half that when the government destroys those rights it's our duty and
[13:59.960 --> 14:05.160]  our right to alter or abolish that government so instead of asking what you
[14:05.160 --> 14:09.280]  can do for your country ask why your country's doing what it's doing ask why
[14:09.280 --> 14:14.840]  they're hiding what they're doing and ask what you can do to alter or abolish
[14:14.840 --> 14:18.920]  that criminal government that's what you should be doing as a citizen now let's
[14:18.920 --> 14:23.360]  go back to the situation in China because they're a long way from where we need
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.680]  to be in America but we're heading on the China direction we're not heading in
[14:27.680 --> 14:33.520]  the 1776 direction we need to change that mindset we are not servants of the
[14:33.520 --> 14:38.200]  government the government should be our servants Paul Joseph Watson points out
[14:38.200 --> 14:41.400]  in this article it's on the dread report China's largest social networks have
[14:41.400 --> 14:45.320]  partnered with the country's communist government to create a credit score
[14:45.320 --> 14:50.160]  system that will measure how obedient its citizens are he says it's a chilling
[14:50.160 --> 14:55.240]  prospect that could one day arrive in America if social justice warriors get
[14:55.240 --> 14:59.360]  their way precisely because what we're seeing with the social justice warriors
[14:59.360 --> 15:04.880]  is intolerance being enacted censorship being enacted and of course they're
[15:04.880 --> 15:09.640]  doing this censorship and intolerance in the name of tolerance but it is far
[15:09.640 --> 15:14.960]  from tolerant it is far from the free speech principles that we had established
[15:14.960 --> 15:21.400]  America to protect continuing on with a quote from zero hedge says aim this aims
[15:21.400 --> 15:27.520]  to create a docile compliant citizenry who are fiscally and morally responsible
[15:27.520 --> 15:33.480]  by employing a game-like format to create self-imposed group social control
[15:33.480 --> 15:37.840]  in other words China gamified peer pressure to control its citizenry and
[15:37.840 --> 15:42.160]  through the scheme it hasn't though the scheme hasn't been fully implemented yet
[15:42.160 --> 15:46.000]  it is already working and we're going to talk about how that works but first I
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.440]  want to play a video for you that's embedded in this article at info wars
[15:49.440 --> 15:53.920]  dot com that kind of breaks this down so it's something you can listen to on the
[15:53.920 --> 15:57.840]  radio is something you can watch if you're watching the video broadcast
[15:57.840 --> 16:02.720]  let's go to that video going under the innocuous name of sesame credit China
[16:02.720 --> 16:07.440]  has created a score for how good a citizen you are and that's one of the
[16:07.440 --> 16:11.760]  scariest things I've heard in quite a while it's jointly run by Tencent yes
[16:11.760 --> 16:15.720]  that Tencent the one that owns Riot Games and has a significant share in epic
[16:15.720 --> 16:19.600]  and Activision Blizzard and also the ascendant Chinese competitor to Amazon
[16:19.600 --> 16:23.920]  Alibaba hence the name Sesame so the owners of China's largest social
[16:23.920 --> 16:26.840]  networks have partnered with the government to create something akin to
[16:26.840 --> 16:30.560]  the US credit score but instead of measuring how regularly you pay your
[16:30.560 --> 16:35.120]  bills it measures how obediently you follow the party line they dread data
[16:35.120 --> 16:39.080]  from your social network so if you post pictures of Tiananmen Square or share a
[16:39.080 --> 16:42.600]  link about the recent stock market collapse your sesame credit score goes
[16:42.600 --> 16:46.320]  down share a link from the state-sponsored news agency about how good the
[16:46.320 --> 16:50.400]  economy is doing and your score goes up but Alibaba and Tencent are also the
[16:50.400 --> 16:54.520]  largest online retailers in China so sesame credit is also able to pull data
[16:54.520 --> 16:58.240]  from your purchases if you're making purchases the state deems valuable like
[16:58.240 --> 17:02.400]  work shoes or local agricultural products your score goes up if you import
[17:02.400 --> 17:06.600]  anime from Japan though down the score goes and this score has real-world
[17:06.600 --> 17:11.080]  consequences like many games sesame credit has tiers and levels and having a
[17:11.080 --> 17:14.920]  high score gives you special benefits like making it easier to get the paperwork
[17:14.920 --> 17:19.040]  you need to travel or making it easier to get a loan now currently there are no
[17:19.040 --> 17:22.640]  consequences for having a low score but there's been talk about implementing
[17:22.640 --> 17:26.800]  penalties once the system becomes mandatory in 2020 penalties like slower
[17:26.800 --> 17:30.920]  internet speeds for low-scoring citizens or even restricting the jobs that a low
[17:30.920 --> 17:34.800]  scoring person's allowed to hold but there's one more layer to sesame credit
[17:34.800 --> 17:38.760]  and here's where this goes from being repulsive to downright insidious because
[17:38.760 --> 17:43.200]  this is all part of a social network it also scans your friends so you will lose
[17:43.200 --> 17:46.960]  points for having friends with low-obedience scores and it tells you
[17:46.960 --> 17:51.120]  this at any point anybody can check anyone else's score and when you check
[17:51.120 --> 17:55.000]  your own score sesame credit provides a handy map of your friends to show you
[17:55.000 --> 17:58.560]  who's dragging your score down have you ever had that thing where you play a
[17:58.560 --> 18:02.000]  game with somebody who wasn't doing very well and you've tried to change their
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.640]  behavior to make them do better or maybe after a while you just sort of stopped
[18:05.640 --> 18:09.160]  playing with the people who were holding you back that's at the heart of how this
[18:09.160 --> 18:13.320]  system works and it's also what makes this one of the most terrifying tools of
[18:13.320 --> 18:17.600]  authoritarian oppression I've ever read about because like mass censorship jail
[18:17.600 --> 18:21.560]  time assassinations those are all big messy implements for keeping a
[18:21.560 --> 18:26.040]  population in line that messiness and severity foster resentment eventually
[18:26.040 --> 18:29.800]  rebellion they're expensive they're unwieldy in the end those tools are
[18:29.800 --> 18:34.480]  impossible to maintain but social pressure ostracization those things are
[18:34.480 --> 18:38.240]  free they happen on their own and as a government tool they don't have nearly
[18:38.240 --> 18:42.160]  the same potential for going embarrassingly disastrously wrong with
[18:42.160 --> 18:46.000]  a system like this in place a government doesn't even have to tell neighbor to
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.800]  spy on neighbor to rat each other out because that's all built into a
[18:49.800 --> 18:54.280]  seemingly innocuous game system the government need not step in reeducation
[18:54.280 --> 18:58.000]  will be handled for them by friends classmates and relatives who want to
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.520]  maintain a high score and if that doesn't work then potentially dangerous
[19:01.520 --> 19:05.360]  ideas still end up quarantined by the social isolation this game system
[19:05.360 --> 19:09.800]  causes express or help to spread too many radical ideas and people will stop
[19:09.800 --> 19:13.480]  associating with you and not because some jackbooted thugs showed up at the
[19:13.480 --> 19:16.800]  door with threats but simply because associating with somebody with those
[19:16.800 --> 19:20.480]  ideas will lose them all the privileges they've worked so hard to obtain
[19:20.480 --> 19:23.480]  alright we're gonna come back you can see the rest of that video at info wars
[19:23.480 --> 19:27.880]  comm in the article of Paul Joseph Watson has he's exactly right to tie this
[19:27.880 --> 19:32.640]  into the social warrior scheme into political correctness we cannot
[19:32.640 --> 19:37.400]  unoverestimate how dangerous political correctness is so when we come back we're
[19:37.400 --> 19:40.600]  gonna break down what's going on with that we're going to break down where

[23:55.360 --> 24:16.440]  when you can take charge of it
[24:16.440 --> 24:20.080]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show and of course that's Charlie Brown Christmas
[24:20.080 --> 24:25.480]  was an article that I saw recently about a school that where they banned their
[24:25.480 --> 24:30.080]  play of Charlie Brown Christmas because you know as part of that one the
[24:30.080 --> 24:37.080]  characters what's his name it reads reads the gospel from Luke Linus reads that
[24:37.080 --> 24:40.560]  gospel from Luke so you can't have that can't have that as part of a school but
[24:40.560 --> 24:46.440]  of course they can have the children learn to write and say in Arabic the
[24:46.440 --> 24:52.320]  confession of faith that there is no God but Allah that's what's going on in our
[24:52.320 --> 24:55.640]  schools and that happened in multiple states at the same time understand
[24:55.640 --> 24:59.480]  that's something that is coming from Washington that's an agenda that's being
[24:59.480 --> 25:03.240]  pushed by Washington now we've been talking about what's going on in China
[25:03.240 --> 25:08.560]  about this move to actually coming across as a game you know because
[25:08.560 --> 25:11.760]  everybody likes to look at their scores you know they like to give people a
[25:11.760 --> 25:14.280]  score you know you got the year permanent record when you're in school
[25:14.280 --> 25:18.480]  but you also always like to have some kind of a measure of how you're doing
[25:18.480 --> 25:21.520]  and of course it's something that we have in America something for you to
[25:21.520 --> 25:25.760]  think about this Christmas your credit score how is that credit score going
[25:25.760 --> 25:30.760]  here you're only going to be scored on how much money you take out and the
[25:30.760 --> 25:34.160]  manner in which you pay it back but of course in China they want to look at
[25:34.160 --> 25:38.120]  what you're buying with that you buy a video game or something that they don't
[25:38.120 --> 25:43.640]  approve of they will knock your score down they want to have you buy certain
[25:43.640 --> 25:46.920]  things are going to put that message out there for you but they will also knock
[25:46.920 --> 25:50.600]  your score down as we saw in that video in the last section they'll also knock
[25:50.600 --> 25:54.280]  your score down if you say things about the government that they don't like or
[25:54.280 --> 25:59.080]  you talk about the government in ways that are not approved that's what is so
[25:59.080 --> 26:03.240]  insidious about it you think that's not going to come here to America of course
[26:03.240 --> 26:06.320]  there's another article that came out today in Daily Mail talking about how and
[26:06.320 --> 26:11.040]  this is on Drudge as well could we soon implant memories into other people
[26:11.040 --> 26:18.000]  electrodes in the brain may make Star Trek style mind melds a reality and
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.920]  where's this coming from it's coming from your friends at DARPA the dark
[26:23.920 --> 26:29.680]  research agency that gets involved in this over-the-top creepy stuff that
[26:29.680 --> 26:34.040]  they're creating all the time things that there's another picture on Drudge
[26:34.040 --> 26:40.560]  reported the robotic reindeer from Boston Dynamics pulling a sleigh with their
[26:40.560 --> 26:46.320]  legs bending the wrong way with no heads just antlers coming out of them we need
[26:46.320 --> 26:50.960]  to be very concerned about the direction that the military research is going I
[26:50.960 --> 26:54.560]  think it is totally out of control we have to understand if you don't think
[26:54.560 --> 26:58.480]  this kind of stuff like they're doing in China is coming to America understand
[26:58.480 --> 27:03.120]  that what China is doing is just kind of old-style tyranny shutting down free
[27:03.120 --> 27:07.800]  speech yes it's insidious and how it is incremental yes there is a connection as
[27:07.800 --> 27:11.280]  Paul Joseph Watson points out in the article on info wars.com there is a
[27:11.280 --> 27:16.280]  connection with political correctness with the social justice warriors with
[27:16.280 --> 27:19.240]  that kind of intimidation that they're putting up here well that's what is so
[27:19.240 --> 27:23.960]  valuable about the Donald Trump candidacy he's just laughing at their
[27:23.960 --> 27:27.720]  political correctness he will not be intimidated it is a template for how we
[27:27.720 --> 27:33.600]  all need to respond to this we need to shut this down and ridicule this is an
[27:33.600 --> 27:38.400]  insidious form of censorship and it's going they're going to extend it into a
[27:38.400 --> 27:42.440]  more formal system but in terms of what our government will do just understand
[27:42.440 --> 27:46.680]  that the internet was originally created by DARPA not only was it created by
[27:46.680 --> 27:51.240]  DARPA it was created by a behavioral scientist at DARPA now he became a
[27:51.240 --> 27:56.120]  computer scientist but that was his original field his name was licked
[27:56.120 --> 28:01.400]  lighter and he called it the intergalactic computer network the
[28:01.400 --> 28:06.360]  intergalactic computer network they shortened it to internet for a while it
[28:06.360 --> 28:10.560]  was available in the early days we used it it was called DARPA net but then it
[28:10.560 --> 28:14.200]  eventually became just the internet in general but he designed it and he
[28:14.200 --> 28:21.240]  designed it as a tool of control understand that now we have used it as a
[28:21.240 --> 28:27.520]  tool of free speech because whenever they create a weapon it can be used for
[28:27.520 --> 28:32.880]  good or it can be used for evil just like a gun guns are not totally bad yes
[28:32.880 --> 28:38.440]  guns are designed to kill however they can be used to defend people without
[28:38.440 --> 28:46.080]  ever even firing them my my grandfather used a gun in that way he had his his
[28:46.080 --> 28:50.680]  brother-in-law had been killed as part of a robbery they had a route where they
[28:50.680 --> 28:55.160]  would collect money it been killed in a robbery with a hatchet stuffed in the
[28:55.160 --> 28:58.560]  back of the truck the police had been looking for him as a missing person
[28:58.560 --> 29:03.040]  they didn't find him my grandfather found him shortly after that because
[29:03.040 --> 29:07.160]  they're both working the same job shortly after that he walked up to his
[29:07.160 --> 29:10.480]  car he was more careful there was a guy in the back of his car with a hatchet
[29:10.480 --> 29:13.880]  waiting for him to get in do the same thing to him he pulled out his gun
[29:13.880 --> 29:17.560]  because he carried a gun in those days he didn't need a permit he didn't use a
[29:17.560 --> 29:21.360]  permit he didn't ask for a permit he didn't live his life by permission he
[29:21.360 --> 29:26.200]  pointed the gun at the guy and he says if I ever see you again I won't give you
[29:26.200 --> 29:30.200]  a warning and he wasn't bothered anymore with that people got the word that he
[29:30.200 --> 29:35.240]  was carrying and of course the Virginia Attorney General has just shut down
[29:35.240 --> 29:38.920]  concealed carry recognition for 25 states that's another article we're going to
[29:38.920 --> 29:42.560]  talk about when we come back stay with us we'll be right back
[29:42.560 --> 29:56.480]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.760 --> 30:04.120]  the website the Daily Beast has accused info wars of putting on a mock mass
[30:04.120 --> 30:08.800]  shooting that we had nothing to do with their article is titled conspiracy
[30:08.800 --> 30:13.360]  theorists terrorized our town in which they write info wars worst humans
[30:13.360 --> 30:18.520]  invaded Texas to stage a mass shooting we counter protested being the author
[30:18.520 --> 30:23.280]  and his friends outnumbering them 20 to 1 they still don't believe that Sandy
[30:23.280 --> 30:28.280]  Hook ever happened as far as the Sandy Hook accusation we discussed that in
[30:28.280 --> 30:33.520]  great detail on the December 21st 2015 edition of the Alex Jones show so I'll
[30:33.520 --> 30:37.880]  focus on the rest of the article the author who took great pride in making
[30:37.880 --> 30:42.200]  fart noises like a seven-year-old child went on to accuse us of stringing the
[30:42.200 --> 30:47.000]  media along and then hosting the event in an area with no cameras once again we
[30:47.000 --> 30:51.240]  did report on the event like dozens of other news agencies but we had nothing
[30:51.240 --> 30:59.800]  to do with it you can find more reports on info wars com in the 15-year history

[33:23.040 --> 33:28.720]  the resistance we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center it's
[33:28.720 --> 33:34.280]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host
[33:34.280 --> 33:37.160]  we've been talking about our story that's up on the Dredge report from
[33:37.160 --> 33:42.080]  Paul Joseph Watson coming to America Chinese introduce credit score for
[33:42.080 --> 33:47.280]  obedient citizens yes that's something that they're very big into of course they
[33:47.280 --> 33:51.440]  have over a hundred thousand people have posted their status and of course they
[33:51.440 --> 33:56.160]  do it as a video game they do it as a status symbol it's that kind of social
[33:56.160 --> 34:02.440]  pressure they've posted their score online on Weibo the Chinese equivalent of
[34:02.440 --> 34:05.480]  Twitter they're very proud of it so they're bragging about it they turn it
[34:05.480 --> 34:10.760]  into a game but understand this come 2020 it's going to become mandatory and
[34:10.760 --> 34:14.360]  this is not like we talked about in the United States not just how you borrow
[34:14.360 --> 34:18.880]  money and pay it back this is scoring you based on what you're buying making sure
[34:18.880 --> 34:21.480]  that you're not buying things the government doesn't want you to buy
[34:21.480 --> 34:26.120]  buying things that they want you to buy you get those a carrot and it's a stick
[34:26.120 --> 34:31.080]  it's both of those things and understand that once this thing goes out they're
[34:31.080 --> 34:34.880]  then going to be looking at political opinion so if you post on your social
[34:34.880 --> 34:38.440]  media political opinions without prior permission if you talk about describing
[34:38.440 --> 34:42.720]  a or you describe a different history than the official one they don't just
[34:42.720 --> 34:47.600]  ridicule you as a conspiracy theorist that's the FBI's technique going back
[34:47.600 --> 34:51.240]  to the JFK assassination they're just ridicule you as a conspiracy theorist
[34:51.240 --> 34:57.920]  what they do is they change your score now that's not just going to hurt your
[34:57.920 --> 35:02.480]  feelings with your friends that's going to have some real penalties attached to
[35:02.480 --> 35:08.520]  it and not only that but whether your friends are doing unapproved government
[35:08.520 --> 35:13.280]  things so your friends scores will pull you down so what they're trying to do is
[35:13.280 --> 35:19.640]  ostracize and ghetto eyes anybody that doesn't tow the official line anybody
[35:19.640 --> 35:23.880]  that doesn't do what the government wants to do but Paul Joseph Watson is
[35:23.880 --> 35:31.560]  very spot-on in terms of making this an extension of political correctness
[35:31.560 --> 35:35.520]  because that's where we are right now that kind of soft tyranny and if we
[35:35.520 --> 35:39.720]  don't push back against that if we don't ridicule that if we don't laugh in
[35:39.720 --> 35:43.920]  their face about that as Donald Trump is doing and good for him for doing that
[35:43.920 --> 35:49.640]  if we don't shut it down that way then this is where we are headed folks the
[35:49.640 --> 35:53.200]  internet was as I mentioned before was originally designed by DARPA was designed
[35:53.200 --> 35:57.560]  by behavioral psychologists to control and monitor us and of course they do
[35:57.560 --> 36:01.600]  that a great deal with it we have other uses that for it and they're trying to
[36:01.600 --> 36:06.640]  shut those other uses down they want to play for you a little bit of the second
[36:06.640 --> 36:10.880]  video that is embedded in Paul Watson's article here and this is something from
[36:10.880 --> 36:15.960]  the prisoner this is a series that was back in the 1960s I've seen it multiple
[36:15.960 --> 36:21.640]  times I loved this series I thought it was very creepy and I was amazed when I
[36:21.640 --> 36:27.040]  went back and looked at again after seeing it in the 1960s 70s I saw the
[36:27.040 --> 36:33.960]  replay of it it was it was very creepy very Orwellian there were cameras
[36:33.960 --> 36:38.720]  everywhere this guy basically it was Patrick McGowan who you remember in
[36:38.720 --> 36:44.840]  America from the secret agent man series they extended it and in a sense it
[36:44.840 --> 36:50.520]  was his idea to do this and he at the very beginning of it he resigns from
[36:50.520 --> 36:55.120]  being a spy for the British government and what happens is they gas him kidnap
[36:55.120 --> 36:59.400]  him and take him to an island trying to interrogate him and of course part of
[36:59.400 --> 37:02.680]  that interrogation is they can walk around freely but they can't escape this
[37:02.680 --> 37:06.360]  island and everything that they do is monitored there are cameras everywhere
[37:06.360 --> 37:10.320]  and it's like wow that is that's really creepy watching people being monitored
[37:10.320 --> 37:15.280]  all the time it is so tame when you look at it today after knowing what our
[37:15.280 --> 37:19.560]  government is doing we were so over the top with what we do out in the open the
[37:19.560 --> 37:25.200]  cameras are not covert like many of them were and on the in the village where he
[37:25.200 --> 37:29.800]  was we have clusters of cameras everywhere on the corners of the
[37:29.800 --> 37:35.440]  buildings now and they don't just watch us there they monitor everything we're
[37:35.440 --> 37:39.480]  doing just like these credit scores let's play a little bit of this clip from
[37:39.480 --> 37:44.880]  the prisoner where they are coming after him for being unmutual because he's not
[37:44.880 --> 37:49.040]  part of the group that kind of peer pressure the kind of group pressure let's
[37:49.040 --> 37:53.240]  play that clip we are bound to classify you as
[37:53.240 --> 37:59.600]  unmutual we must warn you that if any further complaint is lodged against you
[37:59.600 --> 38:05.160]  it will be necessary to propose you for the treatment known as instant social
[38:05.160 --> 38:25.080]  conversion and of course this is a mutualism number six more you must now
[38:25.080 --> 38:29.000]  agree than just a game they are socially conscious citizens and are provoked by
[38:29.000 --> 38:42.040]  the loathsome presence of an unmutual they are sheep yeah I always loved this
[38:42.040 --> 38:48.920]  series the prisoner I tell you his attitude between Patrick McGowan's
[38:48.920 --> 38:53.960]  prisoner character and Thomas Jefferson that was those are my inspirations an
[38:53.960 --> 38:57.000]  excellent series you'll have to see this is a really more of a video clip for you
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.120]  watch and you can see that in the article at info wars.com it's linked on
[39:01.120 --> 39:05.040]  the drudge report breaking this down and we need to kind of understand that this
[39:05.040 --> 39:10.440]  is coming at us gradually we see transportation controls coming on us
[39:10.440 --> 39:14.320]  gradually and this is a great headline from the new American talking about how
[39:14.320 --> 39:20.480]  the IRS is going to be exerting control on our movement how they can take our
[39:20.480 --> 39:24.480]  passport so headline was a new law threatens to revoke Al Sharpton's
[39:24.480 --> 39:30.040]  passport for unpaid taxes so in terms of Al Sharpton because he's got a
[39:30.040 --> 39:33.960]  evidently a large tax bill but understand that that's just the beginning
[39:33.960 --> 39:37.160]  you know they'll come out and say well this is for the people have really large
[39:37.160 --> 39:43.520]  tax bills but when they get self-driving cars and I don't like to use that let's
[39:43.520 --> 39:48.760]  talk about a autonomous driven not even that that's not even a good war because
[39:48.760 --> 39:52.840]  you know what automobile which is what we've called them for over a hundred
[39:52.840 --> 39:57.960]  years that was about you driving yourself when I get in my car and I drive
[39:57.960 --> 40:02.200]  the car it is self-driving I'm driving it the difference is these are going to
[40:02.200 --> 40:06.400]  be robot cars that are controlled by the government it's going to be the
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.920]  government driving you the government monitoring you the government will turn
[40:10.920 --> 40:16.120]  off your car just like they will shut down your passport if you owe them too
[40:16.120 --> 40:20.280]  much taxes okay this is what's happening is a gradual incrementalism that's
[40:20.280 --> 40:25.200]  where this is headed it's about controlling your movements and that's
[40:25.200 --> 40:28.640]  what we need to be concerned about the incrementalism of it you know first
[40:28.640 --> 40:32.040]  they do these types of things for the internet but they are going to constrict
[40:32.040 --> 40:37.000]  your physical movement as well once they outlaw you being able to drive and it
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.880]  will be a gradual process first they will offer incentives just like we see
[40:41.880 --> 40:45.920]  with the Chinese internet you know it's like oh this is great you can show your
[40:45.920 --> 40:49.200]  friends that you've got a really high score and we'll make a game out of it and
[40:49.200 --> 40:53.040]  that sort of thing they'll do that with the robotic cars that the government
[40:53.040 --> 40:57.600]  controls and monitors first they'll say yeah that's great you don't have to you
[40:57.600 --> 41:01.840]  don't have to drive that mind-numbing commute that you have every day you can
[41:01.840 --> 41:04.800]  sit there and you can play with Twitter all day while you're driving instead of
[41:04.800 --> 41:08.400]  having to pay attention what's going on understand that that'd be fine if they
[41:08.400 --> 41:13.720]  would leave it voluntary but they're not going to stop there instead what they
[41:13.720 --> 41:17.720]  will do is they will gradually use the carrot and stick of the insurance
[41:17.720 --> 41:22.520]  companies to make it impossible for you to afford to drive yourself they'll
[41:22.520 --> 41:27.320]  constantly monitor your car we're going to have talking cars mandated by the
[41:27.320 --> 41:30.680]  federal Department of Transportation they're going to start mandating this
[41:30.680 --> 41:34.080]  expensive equipment be added to all new cars and of course those cars are going
[41:34.080 --> 41:39.080]  to be talking about you they're going to be talking about how you are driving are
[41:39.080 --> 41:45.040]  you driving mutually are you driving unmutually are you driving too fast are
[41:45.040 --> 41:49.000]  you changing lanes too much all this type of stuff they're going to feed that back
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.760]  to the government so they can ticket you they'll feed it to the insurance
[41:51.760 --> 41:56.040]  company so that they can raise your rates and before you know it you won't be
[41:56.040 --> 42:00.440]  able to afford to drive yourself that's where this is all headed it's going to
[42:00.440 --> 42:05.840]  be a gradual shutdown and it'll come at you just the same way as the Chinese are
[42:05.840 --> 42:09.080]  coming after their own people there they're going to tell people you know
[42:09.080 --> 42:15.480]  hello only pigs drive gas guzzling self-driving cars everybody else is in
[42:15.480 --> 42:20.200]  these little electric robotic cars and that's that's mutual that's that's
[42:20.200 --> 42:23.480]  politically correct to drive a car like that but if you want to drive yourself
[42:23.480 --> 42:28.120]  that's very politically incorrect now I want to get to what's going on in
[42:28.120 --> 42:33.600]  Virginia with the Attorney General there revoking concealed carry gun permits
[42:33.600 --> 42:38.040]  from 25 states in other words they're not going to recognize them for 25 states
[42:38.040 --> 42:41.920]  it's a reciprocity that states have had we're going to talk about the issues
[42:41.920 --> 42:47.360]  behind that and what he is saying that's his Christmas present to 6.3
[42:47.360 --> 42:52.600]  million people who have gone through the lengthy process to get certified for
[42:52.600 --> 42:56.320]  concealed carry who have submitted themselves to background checks who
[42:56.320 --> 43:00.840]  have submitted them their fundamental right as a privilege to the government
[43:00.840 --> 43:03.480]  trying to get along with the government I understand that I understand that I
[43:03.480 --> 43:10.200]  bought my first gun at retail this last weekend I typically don't like to go to
[43:10.200 --> 43:14.280]  government for permission for anything but you try to get along as much as you
[43:14.280 --> 43:17.720]  can but now they're going to try to slap that down there's going to be a fight
[43:17.720 --> 43:20.520]  about that we're going to talk about that in just a moment before we do I want
[43:20.520 --> 43:23.680]  to let you know about the specials that we have of course we have a lot of
[43:23.680 --> 43:29.200]  things at info wars store.com still health products that you can give the

[44:40.020 --> 44:44.520]  people up show them let them see a documentary on a particular subject we
[44:44.520 --> 44:49.440]  try to go into as much background as we can but we can't go into the entire
[44:49.440 --> 44:52.920]  background of an issue every day otherwise we would never get through any
[44:52.920 --> 44:57.520]  news here so we can't go as deep on a daily news program as we'd like to but
[44:57.520 --> 45:00.840]  if you get a documentary and of course we have all of Alex Jones's documentaries

[45:18.360 --> 45:24.120]  for free 10 cents a day and it supports our operation let's talk about concealed
[45:24.120 --> 45:28.960]  carry right now Washington Post reports Virginia to stop recognizing concealed
[45:28.960 --> 45:33.600]  carry gun permits from 25 states this is Virginia Attorney General Mark R.
[45:33.600 --> 45:39.440]  Herring and when I looked at this I thought R. Herring does that stand for
[45:39.440 --> 45:44.000]  red is that Attorney General Red Herring I think that's what we need to call him
[45:44.000 --> 45:50.800]  because that is essentially what this gun law is it is a red herring now in a
[45:50.800 --> 45:55.560]  rare moment of candor the Washington Post says that this is part of a national
[45:55.560 --> 46:02.240]  push to circumvent legislatures who are opposed to gun control who are opposed to
[46:02.240 --> 46:08.080]  tightening gun laws and this is a red herring folks this is not a problem that
[46:08.080 --> 46:12.600]  needs to be solved how many people do you think have committed crimes that are
[46:12.600 --> 46:16.520]  on the concealed carry gun permit he doesn't even talk about that because it
[46:16.520 --> 46:22.560]  is probably virtually non-existent these are the most thoroughly vetted most
[46:22.560 --> 46:28.320]  investigated most law-abiding citizens you can find people who subject
[46:28.320 --> 46:32.640]  themselves to this kind of background check and it is absolutely insane
[46:32.640 --> 46:40.560]  posturing for Attorney General Red Herring to say that this is a problem
[46:40.560 --> 46:45.480]  and to say that he's not going to recognize these permits from 25 states
[46:45.480 --> 46:50.320]  essentially saying you know nobody else in the country really does a job of
[46:50.320 --> 46:54.680]  vetting these people except for Virginia I think he's got like five states that
[46:54.680 --> 47:00.760]  he's he's okay with vetting this and here's here's the point New American
[47:00.760 --> 47:05.120]  points out that he wants to take this position and one of the states that he
[47:05.120 --> 47:10.400]  has said he's not going to recognize because he doesn't think that they vet
[47:10.400 --> 47:13.960]  their concealed carry people sufficiently one of those states is
[47:13.960 --> 47:18.040]  Kentucky let me tell you what Kentucky does this is point out by the New
[47:18.040 --> 47:21.440]  American they said this is a strange claim considering one of the states
[47:21.440 --> 47:27.680]  Kentucky performs monthly monthly background checks on permit holders to
[47:27.680 --> 47:32.280]  ensure that they are still qualified to hold the permit monthly checks on these
[47:32.280 --> 47:37.960]  permit holders if they fail their permit is revoked what do they check them for
[47:37.960 --> 47:43.240]  felony conviction or imprisonment indictment on any charge that carries
[47:43.240 --> 47:46.240]  with an imprisonment for up to a year's time so they don't have to be convicted
[47:46.240 --> 47:50.720]  just indicted subject to restraining order did they renounce their US
[47:50.720 --> 47:54.560]  citizenship did they get a dishonorable discharge from the armed forces do they
[47:54.560 --> 47:59.040]  have documented mental illness do they have drug abuse or treatment for drug
[47:59.040 --> 48:02.640]  abuse do they have a misdemeanor or felony charge of domestic assault any
[48:02.640 --> 48:06.240]  of those things they check every month in Kentucky the people that have a
[48:06.240 --> 48:09.520]  concealed carry permit if they have any of those things they revoke them but
[48:09.520 --> 48:14.000]  that's not good enough for the Virginia Attorney General red herring and I say
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.800]  red herring understand you know where that expression comes from right it was
[48:17.800 --> 48:22.000]  people in Britain who were opposed to fox hunting isn't it appropriate isn't
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.560]  appropriate they were opposed to fox hunting and so to stop the fox hunt as
[48:27.560 --> 48:31.840]  the fox would run by these guys would run out of the bushes with a stinky fish
[48:31.840 --> 48:36.400]  a red herring and they would you know run it all over the the trail of the fox
[48:36.400 --> 48:41.480]  to throw the hounds off the scent that's exactly what Virginia Attorney General
[48:41.480 --> 48:47.080]  red herring is doing that's what they mark our herring and I don't see what
[48:47.080 --> 48:50.760]  the R stands for they point out in the in the Washington Post this will affect
[48:50.760 --> 48:56.280]  6.3 million people who could legally carry concealed handguns in Virginia
[48:56.280 --> 49:00.640]  today will lose that privilege once the change takes effect next year you know
[49:00.640 --> 49:03.560]  what you don't need to change the gun laws you need to change Attorney General
[49:03.560 --> 49:09.200]  red herring you need to get a movement up to recall this guy to get him out and
[49:09.200 --> 49:13.000]  understand here that they want to say and this is what the Washington Post says
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.200]  I said well you know this is all a reaction to these high-profile mass
[49:17.200 --> 49:21.640]  shootings they've sent policymakers searching for ways to strengthen the
[49:21.640 --> 49:25.200]  gun laws and of course they want to talk about San Bernardino let's take the
[49:25.200 --> 49:28.440]  government's official story about San Bernardino on the face value let's say
[49:28.440 --> 49:34.280]  that it sees two people who did the shooting were they concealed carry
[49:34.280 --> 49:40.760]  holders no were they vetted when they came into the country as migrant jihadis
[49:40.760 --> 49:46.480]  no she wasn't okay did they look at this guy and they did have some
[49:46.480 --> 49:49.040]  investigations they shut that down they said you know what that would be
[49:49.040 --> 49:53.160]  politically incorrect to take a look at that so they purposely look the other
[49:53.160 --> 49:58.800]  way they don't that people who are coming into this country from an area that
[49:58.800 --> 50:03.720]  is at war with the United States let's just understand that they're at war with
[50:03.720 --> 50:06.720]  the United States they're at war with our way of life they hate our culture they
[50:06.720 --> 50:10.620]  hate our religion and with good reason they hate the United States we've
[50:10.620 --> 50:14.160]  started wars in their countries and we've killed innocent people in those
[50:14.160 --> 50:17.640]  countries but nevertheless we are allowing people to come in even if it's
[50:17.640 --> 50:21.840]  only a tiny minority of the number of people that we're letting in we have
[50:21.840 --> 50:25.920]  had hundreds of thousands of people already come in there have been over a
[50:25.920 --> 50:30.920]  million people admitted into the EU just this last year four times the number
[50:30.920 --> 50:36.800]  they had in 2014 nobody is vetting them and that's what Donald Trump was saying
[50:36.800 --> 50:40.640]  they want to say that he wants to ban all Muslims no what he said was we want
[50:40.640 --> 50:45.560]  to have a temporary ban until we can figure out what's going on they don't
[50:45.560 --> 50:51.400]  report it that way but they want to ban law-abiding gun owners from exercising
[50:51.400 --> 50:55.800]  their natural God-given constitutionally protected rights stay with us we'll be

[54:09.880 --> 54:15.240]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this December 23rd 2015 Christmas is
[54:15.240 --> 54:18.880]  just around the corner coming quickly as you can hear from the music I want to
[54:18.880 --> 54:22.360]  go back to the story briefly because we got a video about a from a
[54:22.360 --> 54:26.600]  transhumanist site in Brazil talking about their capabilities of grain of
[54:26.600 --> 54:30.720]  brain repair and management and of course we've been hearing this for a while
[54:30.720 --> 54:35.720]  from DARPA talking about the fact that they could help soldiers who were
[54:35.720 --> 54:42.200]  suffering from PTSD well if you want to help soldiers on PTSD first you could
[54:42.200 --> 54:46.600]  start by stopping the unnecessary unconstitutional wars that you've been
[54:46.600 --> 54:50.600]  sending them to okay let's start there first DARPA but we also need to
[54:50.600 --> 54:56.640]  understand that they always couch these things in very benign terms yeah we can
[54:56.640 --> 55:00.680]  use this to help epilepsy patients or people who are suffering from Alzheimer's
[55:00.680 --> 55:04.480]  or whatever they're saying now US military wants to treat shell shock
[55:04.480 --> 55:08.920]  soldiers and other people with memory loss so they're going to they're working
[55:08.920 --> 55:14.000]  on a way that they can read your memory that they can transfer your memory that
[55:14.000 --> 55:21.880]  they can do a direct implant into your mind okay understand that DARPA is about
[55:21.880 --> 55:27.120]  creating military weapons it's not about helping people medically anything that
[55:27.120 --> 55:33.160]  comes out of that is simply a side issue but they sell it that way they sell it
[55:33.160 --> 55:37.880]  that way you need to go back and look in and Alex interviewed the lady that wrote
[55:37.880 --> 55:43.840]  the Pentagon's brain very good book it'll give you a long history of DARPA
[55:43.840 --> 55:49.400]  you'll put this in perspective and it will forever destroy the presumption
[55:49.400 --> 55:54.880]  that DARPA is there doing things to help you know they are creating military
[55:54.880 --> 56:01.280]  weapons to make life on earth hell on earth swarms of autonomous killing
[56:01.280 --> 56:06.880]  robots a complete monitoring and manipulation of everything that's going
[56:06.880 --> 56:14.600]  on all the way into your brain let's play this clip from Brazil I think it's
[56:14.600 --> 56:19.920]  quite reasonable to think about several parts of the brain being understood
[56:19.920 --> 56:27.760]  well enough that we can develop not just mathematical models but silicon
[56:27.760 --> 56:33.680]  models microchip models of how those parts of the brain work we've learned
[56:33.680 --> 56:39.080]  enough about how of what long-term memories are when they're in code that
[56:39.080 --> 56:45.480]  we can identify long-term memory codes in the behaving rat brain and so we can
[56:45.480 --> 56:51.200]  say oh they're right there that is the code for the the bar that the animals
[56:51.200 --> 56:56.040]  good going to press to get water we can say that's the code and so we can
[56:56.040 --> 57:00.240]  recognize these things we can see what they are we can manipulate them in some
[57:00.240 --> 57:10.520]  ways and so within a couple of years we will have the ability to form new
[57:10.520 --> 57:14.320]  long-term memories the same way they're formed in the brain but there are several
[57:14.320 --> 57:19.960]  parts of the brain like this that are ready for this next generation analysis
[57:19.960 --> 57:26.920]  that will allow us to to create a mathematical model of how some of their
[57:26.920 --> 57:33.880]  functions work and we'll be able to reproduce those in mathematical models
[57:33.880 --> 57:39.480]  and we'll be able to reproduce those in microchip form well we need to sit down
[57:39.480 --> 57:45.240]  and commit ourselves to the two goals of these kind of goals yeah they do have
[57:45.240 --> 57:48.760]  some goals they have a lot of funding to we got the brain initiative from Obama
[57:48.760 --> 57:52.600]  I think it's a hundred million dollars or more of course there's European
[57:52.600 --> 57:58.600]  equivalents to that this is about mind control this has been a goal of DARPA the
[57:58.600 --> 58:01.920]  CIA the government for a very long time they've worked on drugs now they're
[58:01.920 --> 58:05.520]  working on the electronics of the brain of course if you talk about it we were
[58:05.520 --> 58:10.880]  always ridiculed as tin foil had conspiracy theorists you know what
[58:10.880 --> 58:15.520]  they're bragging about it constantly we need to be very concerned about our
[58:15.520 --> 58:21.400]  government's desire to control our minds to control and monitor our behavior
[58:21.400 --> 58:24.880]  that is what's fundamentally behind this now when we come back we'll go at a
[58:24.880 --> 58:29.560]  special report from John Bowne on Psy Hersh's expose and we're gonna break that
[58:29.560 --> 58:34.800]  down more completely when we return stay with us we'll be right back

[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.720]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host Alex Jones is
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.920]  gonna be joining us in this hour I want to play a special report because it's
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.800]  very important that you understand what Cy Hirsch a Pulitzer Prize winning
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:39.360]  journalist and author his expose about what is truly going on in Syria what's
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:44.280]  truly going on with ISIS we have the candidates who are running for office
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:49.280]  pretending that ISIS is something that is external no there's a lot of
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.920]  involvement from the American government we helped to create this and he breaks
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:58.080]  this down and he breaks down how good people in the military responded to what
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.120]  was going on in the Obama administration but here's that special report from
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:06.280]  John Bowne Cy Hirsch has revealed in his latest offering titled military to
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:10.920]  military that while Obama continued his campaign of lies regarding President
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:15.960]  Bashar al-Assad's tenuous hold on power the Joint Chiefs of Staff were altering
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:19.440]  the playing field with shared intelligence Pulitzer Prize winner
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.280]  Hirsch has broken new ground once again divulging a quiet alliance between
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:29.520]  Germany Israel and Russia of shared tactical intelligence in order to freeze
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:36.000]  the advance of Al-Nusra and ISIS in the fall of 2013 do I think that our actions
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.120]  in any way violate the war powers resolution the answer is no President
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:45.880]  Obama and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's failed foreign policy aimed
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.880]  at toppling Gaddafi's Libya and Morsi's Egypt resulted in a power vacuum
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:55.160]  immediately filled with Islamic fundamental extremism Obama's constant
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.400]  demand that Assad must go chaotically echoed the previous coups and if
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:03.560]  accomplished could give the Islamic State the upper hand in the region do you
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:09.680]  know any major Arab ally that embraces ISIL I know major Arab allies who fund
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.640]  them General Dempsey and the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that Obama's
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.960]  meddling in the Middle East had to be countered the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.120]  quietly shared intelligence with key allies in order to give Syria the
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:25.520]  tactical advantage however Syria had to agree to these four terms
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:30.480]  Sy Hirsch writes first Assad must keep Hezbollah from attacking Israel second
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.440]  he must renew negotiations with Israel on the Golan Heights third he must accept
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.200]  Russian and other outside military advisors and fourth he must commit to
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.480]  holding open elections after the war with a wide range of factions Assad
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.280]  essentially agreed to these conditions over time and that led to major shifts
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:52.200]  in the war that are generally now known to the public meanwhile the Obama
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.560]  administration was touting the narrative that an anti-Islamic state coalition
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:00.840]  with Russia would prove to be impossible and non-beneficial however by
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.960]  allying with Russian military General Dempsey and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:08.760]  proved that not only was a coalition possible the shared knowledge of the
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:12.560]  Islamic State between Russia and the United States would serve to weaken
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:16.600]  their advance into Syria Russia had been fighting Islamic State leaders in the
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:21.400]  two Chechen Wars that began in 1994 and they were very familiar with the ISIS
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.520]  leadership while the US had been training foreign fighters for years this
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.480]  experience in a long-standing tradition applying target information with
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:34.280]  massive sums of money would prove to be devastating to ISIS's leadership and as
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:39.000]  the coalition quietly made progress it became abundantly clear that the so
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.080]  called Syrian moderate rebels Obama kept referring to were more of a fantasy than
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.720]  a reality to this day retired General Dempsey is perplexed by Obama's bold
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.280]  face lie that Turkey's Erdogan is a staunch ally with the United States in
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.280]  the fight against the Islamic State Sy Hirsch writes Dempsey and his
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:02.280]  associates remained mystified by Obama's continued public defense of Erdogan
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:06.320]  given the American intelligence community strong case against him and the
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:11.680]  evidence that Obama in private accepts that case Hirsch wrote last spring Obama
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:16.000]  said to Turkey's intelligence chief we know what you're doing with the radicals
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.680]  in Syria after Dempsey retired in September General Dunford and an
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:25.480]  entirely new and obedient staff was installed to back up all of Obama's
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:30.240]  lies as is evident by their communal hatred of Donald Trump Sy Hirsch has
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:34.360]  presented nothing less than another testament to Obama's pitiful leadership
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:39.720]  of the US military built upon a pile of half-baked falsehoods now proven without
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:44.160]  a shadow of a doubt to be treasonous support for the Islamic State John

[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:24.400]  follow up on that report we just heard from John bound excellent report you
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:30.880]  can see that on our Alex Jones YouTube channel breaking down this summarizing
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:35.000]  this very lengthy article from Psy Hirsch the Pulitzer Prize winning a
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.400]  journalist and author breaking down the what he calls military to military now
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:44.520]  what does he mean by that and he goes back to the summer of 2013 of course
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.640]  that was a time you remember there was that seren gas attack is a horrific
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:51.440]  attack we were told that there was only one possibility that had to have come
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.440]  from the Syrian government a seren gas attack on civilians and we pointed out
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.960]  at the time we pushed very hard against this and we said that's not the only
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.120]  possibility there had been previous seren gas attacks that had been proven to
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:09.480]  not be the Syrian government and so we talked about the different sources of
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:15.320]  this as a matter of fact there were leaks from well we went back to reports
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:19.120]  from the United Nations looking at these earlier seren gas attacks there were
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:24.840]  also reports from Russia and then as this continued to move on we got reports
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:30.560]  from the US military talking about the same thing saying we cannot be sure
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.840]  that this is just because it's seren gas it doesn't mean that it came from the
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:38.280]  Syrian government as a matter of fact this doesn't look like it came from the
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:42.520]  Syrian government we had people holding up signs that were in the military saying
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.080]  we will not be al-Qaeda's air force remember that that was a summer of 2013
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.440]  the Obama administration was pushing very hard to escalate the war to get us
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:53.920]  involved in that and of course we pointed out at the time this was something
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:57.800]  going back to Wesley Clark saying that he had seen a list of countries that we
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:04.040]  were going to destabilize to destroy and of course Syria was one on that list so
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:08.440]  he said let's not go down this path let's pay attention to this well now we
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.960]  learn from Seymour Hirsch and sources that he has inside the Pentagon that the
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:17.280]  same that there was a pushback inside the Pentagon he says in the summer of
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:24.240]  2013 there was an all-source appraisal and by that he means all different types
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.800]  of military intelligence signals intelligence satellite intelligence
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:35.400]  human intelligence all sources were telling them that this was not the case
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:39.360]  they were saying the Obama's administration's insistence on continuing
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.920]  to finance an arm so-called moderate rebel groups was a very bad idea they
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.840]  were told this by the Defense Intelligence Agency the DIA the Joint
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.920]  Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey they were all telling this to the Obama
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.680]  administration but guess what the Obama administration didn't want to hear this
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.880]  they kept telling him that the new intelligence estimate singled out Turkey
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:05.480]  as a major impediment to Obama's Syrian policy the document showed the
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:10.280]  advisor said that talk to Sy Hirsch that what was started as a covert U.S.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.680]  program to arm and support the moderate rebels fighting Assad had been co-opted
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.920]  by Turkey had morphed into an across-the-board technical arms and
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:24.840]  logistical program for all of the opposition including ISIS and al-Nusra
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.960]  okay the so-called moderates had evaporated the free Syrian army that
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.600]  we hear all about those are the guys that supposedly John McCain is meeting
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:38.440]  with these moderate Muslims his friends his buddies okay he says that was
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.840]  nothing but a rump group stationed at an air base in Turkey the assessment was
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.840]  bleak they told the president there was no viable moderate opposition to Assad
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:54.320]  and the U.S. was arming extremists we said it at the time the Joint Chiefs of
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:59.120]  Staff now we learn we're telling that to Obama as if he didn't know okay now what
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.680]  did they do they said you know the idea that anybody else is better than Assad
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:09.920]  is Obama's policy but it's not a good policy the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.240]  according to Sy Hirsch said that a direct challenge to Obama's policy would
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:18.200]  have had quote a zero chance of success according to his sources understand
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:22.720]  that Obama doesn't want to hear it Obama knows what's going on we know what's
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:26.360]  going on you can look at this and tell what's going we know that this is a
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:29.280]  deliberate policy we know that they started these revolutions for the
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:34.120]  Muslim Brotherhood of course Huma Abedin Hillary Clinton's very special
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:39.320]  friend her mother her family are in the Muslim Brotherhood they're connected
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.800]  into that so we understand what's going on with these revolutions that they've
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:48.280]  been setting up and we know that these so-called moderate groups are entirely
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:52.000]  a fiction that was something that was very clear and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.280]  explain this with all of their different signals intelligence satellite human
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.840]  intelligence the Obama administration's turning a deaf ear to it so you've got
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:06.080]  some good people in the military and they do not want to arm ISIS and we made
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.040]  this very clear you can continue to see this I mean there was a situation in
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.320]  Houston for I mean they're sending everything to these people especially
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:16.280]  channeling it through Turkey and that's what he points out in his research the
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:21.120]  stuff was going a lot of it was being channeled through Saudi Arabia into
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.720]  Turkey from Turkey to ISIS and that sort of thing we even had a guy here in
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.880]  Houston who had a plumbing business and and that came up again it was reported
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:33.800]  about a year ago he traded in his car in Houston in his truck and he said he
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.520]  started taking off the sign that was on the head name of his business in his
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.920]  phone and the dealer says no no no take that off you might damage the paint
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:45.160]  we'll remove that he goes all right not too long after that he sees pictures on
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.440]  the internet that ISIS is putting up where they've mounted weapons to his
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:52.200]  truck and they're doing videos ISIS videos and it still has the name of his
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:55.960]  business and the phone number on the side and he's getting death threats from
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:00.400]  people thinking that he is part of ISIS because they left that on that the truck
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:06.120]  was sold to Syria to Turkey rather and Turkey finds its way into ISIS and of
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:09.480]  course you can see that on the map you can if you look at the map of ISIS
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:13.920]  controlled areas it looks like blood dripping down from Turkey we know what's
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.160]  going on we know that Turkey is buying the oil from ISIS and financing them
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.200]  through that it's a very well-known thing and Sy Hirsch breaks us down but
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:25.120]  here's the interesting thing he points out that the way the military approached
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:28.360]  this was they they didn't want to see this happen they know that Obama is
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:32.320]  turning a deaf ear he's going to follow his policy of arming and equipping ISIS
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.560]  even though they tell him what's going on so they came up with an idea that they
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:42.440]  would work with Germany Israel and Russia military to military they said you
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.960]  know what we've got this information what if we shared that information with
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.840]  Germany what if we shared it with Israel what if we shared it with Russia
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:53.040]  Germany feared according to Sy Hirsch Germany feared what might happen amongst
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:58.320]  its own population of six million Muslims if the Islamic State ISIS expanded
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:02.040]  Israel of course is concerned of border security Russia had an alliance
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.680]  long-standing with Syria they're worried about the threat not only to their
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:12.480]  Syrian ally but also to their only naval base on the Mediterranean at TARDIS so
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:17.080]  they give this information to Germany Israel and Russia they well you know
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:20.960]  here's what we've got if you guys want to do something with it that's up to you
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:26.600]  and it's very interesting as he breaks down this article and talks about how
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:31.800]  you know Saudi Arabia continues to fund these people with $700 million you
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:36.440]  know that that wonderful ally of ours that is going to chop off a record
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:41.840]  number of heads today this year they've executed with just beheadings more
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:46.000]  people than ISIS has as a matter of fact but there are allies they've been our
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.800]  allies ever since Richard Nixon created the petrodollar with them and it's kind
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:55.360]  of concerning as to who's running this I mean is this an equal partnership or
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:59.880]  are they telling us what to do there's an article and we talk about that later
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:04.040]  about people being concerned about that in the UK there's been a secret
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:08.560]  memorandum of understanding between the Cameron government and Saudi Arabia
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:13.680]  people are very concerned about that especially because of what Saudi Arabia
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.880]  is known to be doing so this is interesting article and we could go
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.200]  into a lot more details a very long article I'd recommend you reading it if
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:24.440]  you want to know what's going on but there was an article that came out on
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:28.360]  Monday by Wayne Madsen here at info wars did you know that the CIA planned a
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.120]  Muslim invasion of Russia this is something's been going on for a very
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.200]  long time the same tactic and guess what this is a top-secret CIA bulletin
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:42.880]  declassified now going back to 1952 so for 63 years they've been using this
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:48.760]  tactic of surrogate jihadis understand that it doesn't even go back to just the
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:56.400]  Afghanistan war where they created the the forces to fight against Russia and
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:03.200]  Afghanistan no it doesn't start with that it goes back to 1952 and he points out
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.600]  the article CIA had embarked on a program to ferment nationalism amongst the
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.440]  used Uzbek tribes of Afghanistan order that it might spill across the border
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:16.680]  into Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic he says it means that the current attempt
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.760]  by such anti-russian US official and quasi official intelligence policymakers
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:25.240]  including former president Jimmy Carter's national security advisors big
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:31.120]  new Brzezinski had hedge fund tycoon George Soros CIA director John Brennan to
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:34.320]  bring about a radical Muslim destabilization of the Russian Federation
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:40.600]  is nothing new and of course we've seen articles from some of the people who are
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:45.840]  now leaders of al-Nusra leaders of ISIS one of them in particular saying yeah we
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:51.400]  were working in Chechnya as terrorists against Russia and the CIA brought us
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.840]  over here because there just wasn't enough happening there right now they
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:18:00.440]  wanted to get this done so they imported us from Chechnya to Syria they had been
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:08.400]  using these surrogates you know back in 1952 63 years ago use them against the
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:11.680]  Soviet Union they've been using them ever since and here's the issue folks
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:16.000]  they're using them against they're gonna use them against us in the same way
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.200]  that's why Obama against what the American people want against all
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.960]  common sense is not only opening up the borders but paying to fly people in from
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:31.880]  areas that are at war with us that is precisely what they're doing to us what
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:36.200]  they have been doing to Russia for 63 years what they have been doing in Syria
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:43.160]  for years they are now trying to do in America that is why they want to ignore
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.040]  all common sense you know there was an article that came out the end of the
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:51.760]  week last week majority of Americans 55% support Trump's Muslim ban and again
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.880]  it's not a ban saying we want a temporary ban until we can figure out what's
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:00.000]  going on 72% of Republicans 45% of Democrats why is it that most of the
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:07.960]  Republicans want to side with the 30% instead of with the 70% why is it that
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:15.520]  most of the Democrat politicians want to side with the 50 with the 45% the
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:20.640]  majority who don't want this okay understand that this is a bipartisan
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:25.680]  effort to remake the demographics of our country to set up an internal fifth
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:32.160]  column to create conflict to alter our society and it's not just a demographic
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.240]  push to get their Democrat voters in this is something that they've been
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.240]  doing to Russia for a very long time we need to call it what it is we need to
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:43.760]  understand what this is about this is why they look the other way with all
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:49.280]  these dangers in the same way that Obama look the other way when his when the
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.880]  Defense Department came to him and said we know that we're arming the wrong
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.080]  people he doesn't care he wasn't arming the wrong people he knows exactly what
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:00.560]  he's doing it's not incompetence we'll be right back 59 when he collapsed from a

[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:16.760]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host and we were just
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:22.120]  talking in the last segment about not the incompetence of Obama in terms of
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:27.560]  arming ISIS in terms of letting mistakenly letting arms fall into their
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:34.480]  hands know the deliberate rejection of all-source intelligence every source
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:40.400]  every organization within the military was telling him your arming ISIS and
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:45.000]  they continue to do it so the military then gave their intelligence to the
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.920]  Germans to Israel to Russia and said do something about ISIS that's how bad
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:55.640]  things are and as I point out it is not a mistake it is not incompetence it is
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.720]  deliberate and of course Hillary Clinton is involved in that as well we had an
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:04.360]  article that was put up right after the debate by Kurt Nemo this last weekend he
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.320]  says during the Democrat debate on Saturday Hillary Clinton blamed Bashar
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:12.240]  al Assad for the situation in Syria she says Assad is killed by last count a
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.640]  quarter of a million Syrians reason we're at the mess we're in is that ISIS
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:20.320]  and that ISIS has a territory it has is because of Assad no as we just pointed
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:24.200]  out to you as multiple sources have pointed out to you it's the revolutions
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:29.080]  that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Obama created
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:33.960]  everywhere this is something that ought to be rejected out of hand by
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:39.240]  Democrat voters I can't understand why she is as popular as she is and of course
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:42.760]  I was just handed an article by Kit Daniels talking about how her popularity
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:46.880]  has is falling and of course there's good reasons for that amongst the
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:50.200]  Democrats Democrats are typically saying they don't want war they reject the
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:55.000]  military industrial complex but they give it a pass when somebody wearing their
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  team uniform does I we're gonna play a clip later in the show from a new
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.920]  Republican Senator Ben Sasse and he laid this out very well for Democrats and
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:11.440]  for Republicans talking about how you need to not give people a pass out of
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:16.040]  partisan blind partisan loyalty but of course as Kurt Nemo pointed out this
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:19.760]  Civil War was orchestrated by us and they're just trying to create this
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.000]  paranoia to get people to overreact at the same time we got an article from the
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.360]  Daily News Daily Caller News Foundation says that a whistleblower pointed out
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.240]  and we've I think we've covered this before as well this is something that
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:35.320]  happened about a week or so ago someone who was under pressure from the
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:39.000]  Department of State working for Homeland Security who is tracking these people
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.400]  who came in as San Bernardino the official story and he said he was told
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:48.400]  to shut this down the administration he said was more concerned about civil
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.120]  rights and liberties of foreign Islamic groups with terrorist ties than they
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:56.440]  were the safety and the security of Americans no I don't think so I mean
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.120]  you could read it that way but I think that they really do want to do the same
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:05.040]  thing to America that they've been doing to Russia for 63 years essentially
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:11.760]  using Islamic jihadis as a way to take down this country now we're going to
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:15.920]  come back after the break and we're going to talk about some politics we're
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:19.080]  also going to talk about an amazing admission by the drugs are but before

[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.360]  admission by the drug czar you know that was something that always bothered me
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:19.840]  why do we have somebody in America that has the title czar that's about as
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:24.640]  authoritarian as you can get we have a drug czar now amazingly this is maybe
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.600]  the only thing that I've ever seen Obama do the best thing he's ever do is have a
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:32.640]  drug czar who says that he doesn't like the term he says the war on drugs is a
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:36.520]  failure but guess what he's not gonna stop it we'll talk about that when we
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:47.120]  come back stay with us we'll be right back
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:56.600]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:03.440]  GOP presidential hopeful ran Paul as introduced legislation intended to
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:07.040]  block any effort by the incumbent president to enforce gun control by
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:11.880]  executive action Paul's legislation named the separation of powers restoration
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:15.440]  and Second Amendment Protection Act would render any action on gun
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:20.000]  legislation by the president which circumvents Congress as advisory only in
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.520]  nature Paul's bill would apply to any executive action on gun control that
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:28.400]  either infringes upon congressional authority or potentially violates the
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:32.480]  Second Amendment the bill then mandates that once an executive action has been
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:37.200]  classified as advisory only it would require Congress to pass it in order for
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:41.400]  it to take effect the bill also outlines that it is within their power for a
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:45.760]  state official member of Congress or a person affected by an executive action
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:50.200]  on gun control to launch a civil lawsuit the legislation will be fast tracked

[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.840]  listening to you here at the office while I have a working vacation you're
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:37.160]  filling in well I have to take care of a lot of the new operations we're going to
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.640]  be launching in the new year including getting this this radio TV show and
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:46.120]  more UHFVHF and cable systems already got quite a few but we're into the big
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:51.880]  push coming up in the start of the new year so again it's just great to have
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:56.960]  you and the entire team working so hard all of our reporters and I just want to
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:00.280]  commend the work of the entire info wars crew and staff as we accelerate towards
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:04.320]  the end of 2015 and also all of our friends out there who love freedom
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:08.240]  across the world not just the listeners the sponsors but all the folks that
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:13.720]  pray for us and also all the prominent people from top generals to people like
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:17.320]  Kurt Russell coming out and saying hey I'm against you know the tyranny that we
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:21.360]  face and we need to all speak out and get involved so we talk about the great
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:24.720]  awakening I want to speak some about the great awakening then also want to
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:28.400]  discuss how the Empire is going to be striking back against that great
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:31.880]  awakening for this segment and the segment only I'm gonna hand the baton
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:37.160]  back to you and I know also you did it's a wonderful life a few years ago that
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:42.240]  really is something we should show every year because it's it's a wonderful
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:47.720]  life tied into the private Federal Reserve and the activities that they are
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:51.360]  involved in and how they've been in slayers in fact you have another name
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:54.520]  for it yeah it's a wonderful lie as well as that is kind of the globalist
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.240]  Christmas present to us because everybody needs to remember that was done
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:01.040]  and the dead of night and you know what it may happen again this year Alex with
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.760]  the Trans-Pacific Partnership they could run that thing through very very
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:07.520]  quickly they always like to do these things while people are distracted while
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:10.400]  they're not looking and so that's the thing we need to be aware of but so we're
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:13.760]  gonna go back and revisit again this reported it a couple years ago was on
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:18.400]  the 100th anniversary of that great deception that's right 2013 two years
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:22.520]  ago and it's part of the great awakening because we put that video out on the
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:26.640]  main info wars channel that has you know 600 million views on it and it got
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:31.320]  about 500,000 views in just a couple days and they came and they put a strike
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:37.000]  on us and basically removed it and then the next time I did to another channel
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.840]  I challenged it literally had to sign affidavits in court that it was fair
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:44.640]  use because it is fair use total commentary on a major social issue
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:49.680]  through a piece of media that it turns out the copyright is basically open on
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:53.640]  so on so many fronts they were wrong now it only has 20,000 views on your
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:57.240]  sub channel this is how they try to censor this info so we're asking
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:02.440]  everybody to go get it's a wonderful lie report that's been censored multiple
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:06.200]  times and to go where it's still available and get it out to everybody you
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:09.320]  know and you know at the same time they were doing that Alex there was the
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:14.640]  entire movie available to watch on Google as a matter of fact that's where I got
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:19.520]  my clips from that I used it's all it had it up for multiple that had it up for
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.880]  I think three years they had over 800,000 views over those three years of
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:28.760]  it's a wonderful life the entire movie and yet we put it up with fair use a few
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:32.640]  little clips from the little clips with commentary review exactly a review and
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:36.600]  an apparel that would only cause people that claim they own derivatives of it
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:39.640]  you know remastered copies they don't own the originals remastered copies it's
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:44.000]  not a copyright would only promote what they're doing I mean the lawyers said
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.320]  hands down it's very use yeah they did it because they don't want to be seen and
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:50.200]  that's gonna tie in with a great awakening here in just a moment
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:54.640]  censorship here in America Google I'm not attacking Google it's just true when
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:59.840]  Obama deception came out seven years ago we had a Google shopping cart for just
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:04.080]  about a year had products on it and they said oh this is racist in an official
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:09.000]  email and terminated our account so see we can't engage in commerce because the
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.520]  Obama deception criticizes a president that is supposedly half African-American
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:17.800]  nothing about him being black nothing about black people being bad but even if
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.920]  we were being racist we should have a right to sell our paraphernalia and our
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:28.720]  info in a free country but no no no they judged as racist and and and Apple
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:32.880]  iTunes won't accept any of our info Google more and more won't accept our
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.560]  info it's very very serious now YouTube's left this alone which is a
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:39.960]  subsidiary of Google the last few years I've actually talked to some of their
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:44.560]  executives are pretty good folks and and they're they're actually protecting us
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:47.800]  to a certain extent to allow us to operate and continue because they believe
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:50.880]  in what we're doing so there's even good people in Google let's be clear of all
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:56.600]  the evil companies you know probably Microsoft Facebook I mean that's when
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:00.480]  you really really really I mean we've been given this Facebook mentions thing
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:04.400]  that only a few hundred people have and now they're expanding it or any and some
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:07.080]  of the videos we do get two three million views I mean it's definitely high
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.200]  power but we've kind of gotten the message hey you might want to be a
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:14.720]  little nicer if you want to keep this well you know what we're gonna talk
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:18.160]  about it because those little messages yeah because I'm not gonna sit here and
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:22.800]  play games with us so I'm gonna get into my report the great awakening ladies
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:27.440]  and gentlemen the great awakening is absolutely undoubted here's a story
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:30.840]  that is going up on info wars.com in the next five minutes they're in their
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:34.200]  proofreading it right now but I said this is so important the Daily Beast
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:41.800]  reported on of course Kurt Russell going on TV shows and they keep asking
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:44.840]  what's this about guns and he keeps defending it now he goes look I'm a
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:48.640]  hardcore libertarian watch out I don't want to go all the way here Hollywood's
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:51.800]  full of fake conservatives and liberals who aren't patriots I believe in the
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:55.880]  founding fathers I believe in 1776 I mean I've been told he's a listener he
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:39:00.080]  doesn't like to get political but we are reaching out to him and again I was told
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:04.720]  by a director here in town years ago that well I mean it's Rick Linklater
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:08.420]  came on the show and talked about Bruce Willis being awake and then a few
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:11.600]  months later he was in Vanity Fair about the New World Order Kennedy being
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:15.920]  killed and that I woke up Bruce Willis and again I'm not bragging about this
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:21.800]  that interviews on record it shows the power of this little show because they
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:29.360]  were making I guess it was eight nine years ago they were making the big film
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:35.140]  here in town with Robert Rodriguez that had him in it what's the one with her in
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:39.680]  New York City and it's like Gotham Sin City Sin City and then he was also doing
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:43.880]  some work with Linklater and literally heard my radio show tuned in got the
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:48.960]  films and woke up just being here in town a month so that shows he went from
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:51.840]  being a Republican he said this in Vanity Fair I used to be a Republican
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:54.640]  now I see they're all controlled by the same people the people that killed
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:58.640]  Kennedy run America today there's been a coup since then so I never reached out
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.320]  to Willis we are reaching out to him now I don't expect him to come on because
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:04.880]  these people get threatened and intimidated then I was told that you
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:09.880]  know Kurt Russell's in town too and you know he likes your show and again he
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:13.240]  was already a libertarian I was even told then it's just that this show
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:17.320]  accelerated his awakening and so I'm not bragging when Jeff Bridges calls me
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:21.120]  and you know since he's a huge fan of the show and listens all the time I'm not
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:27.160]  on a power trip about Alex Jones you need to know this signifies just because
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:31.360]  I'm a public figure so they're able to reach out to me or I get these pings you
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:35.960]  have this info like Viggo Mortensen I was at a media event saw an info or
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:39.720]  flag on a on a mic said hey I like Alex Jones I'll come on you know here's my
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:44.360]  number came on listens every week and that's Viggo Mortensen super ultra
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:49.800]  liberal but a real liberal yeah she's actually educated informed so and you
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:52.680]  can disagree with us on some issues you know but people who are really there
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:57.600]  look people like John Cusack I mean he has his hardcore Democrat but he came
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:02.960]  out against Obama because of what Obama did with the NSA and with wars and other
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:06.280]  things you have integrity as a liberal or a conservative exactly when
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:09.320]  Republicans do bad stuff we go after him I'm not a Republican I'm a libertarian
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:13.800]  but that's historically more allied with Republicans because of guns and you
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:17.720]  know things like that lower taxes but there is a takeover of the Republican
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:21.840]  Party happening by the realty party movement not the one they tried to co-opt
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:26.200]  fragments of it and they admit that's the main threat so again going over all
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.880]  this I may have to go to the next segment because I'm you know ranting off
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.120]  another subjects this huge awakening is happening and now Kurt Russell's not
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:38.920]  backing down he's doubling down saying I'm a hardcore libertarian I'm sick of the
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:43.720]  left-right system you know we need to get back to our original roots 1776 the
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:48.040]  article is going live as we speak at info wars.com you need to hit refresh on
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:51.440]  that we have links to the video and audio of where he says it that's great
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.040]  because you want to listen to that whole interview he's trying to plug the film
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:57.800]  hateful 8 that's coming out and he's he's got an interview with a guy and the
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.240]  guy keeps coming after him about guns and gun culture and gun control and he
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:04.320]  keeps saying I'm here to talk about a movie this is about art I don't want to
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:08.000]  talk about politics but the guy keeps on and after a while when you hear that
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.720]  interview he just loses it so now what's happened instead of him not wanting to be
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:16.400]  public being prodded he's not going on the view and now other shows that is
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:20.520]  getting more hardcore that's the new video and audio at info wars.com now
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:24.240]  continuing here they're gonna counter strike against us because this big
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:27.840]  awakening is happening Congress has a 9% approval rating three years running
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:31.480]  people know college is a fraud now because there are no jobs or
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:34.760]  infrastructure for it it's more of an indoctrination center the system is
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:38.320]  tripling and quadrupling down on oppression and the harder they squeeze
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:41.920]  like a beach ball into the water the more it's coming up these are historical
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:48.560]  paradigms that we are extremely well aware of now continuing what is their
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:53.320]  counter strike gonna be it's going to be social shunning like they did in
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:43:00.720]  Nazi Germany from 1933 until about 1939 Hitler didn't start rounding up his
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:04.480]  political opposition whether they were conservative liberal it didn't matter
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:08.600]  whether they were Jewish communists you know German high command until 39 at
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:12.480]  first it was demonization first it will don't give you licenses at first it's
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:15.880]  not let you do business at first it's telling people don't do business with
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:21.600]  them or you'll be shunned then by 37 38 they start knocking the windows out then
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:24.920]  they start burning people's businesses down then they say you go to this ghetto
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:29.560]  and you live there to all these different political groups and then they
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:34.440]  start arresting you and and and selectively going after folks breaking
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:37.440]  down the communities getting people to tattle tail on each other setting up
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:41.440]  controllers like George Soros and others who would manage ghettos and then make
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:44.440]  the Jews and others think they were on their side and then feed on them that's
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:47.400]  what the ADL Southern Parvy Law Center all these groups are literally the
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:51.680]  children of the people that were the master Judas goats to feed on those
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:55.640]  groups that's a microcosm the Soviets do the same thing they invented the term
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:44:00.280]  back in the 30s a political correct or correct political speech is what it
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:05.040]  translates out of they had commas ours political officers thought police it
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:11.160]  would go around pushing this stuff with the NKVD and other groups but they
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:13.880]  didn't have to enforce it themselves because there were throngs of people
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:18.720]  that would fawn to the black uniforms the black boots to all of it and and
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:22.960]  want to prove their worthiness so domestically they're coming in with a
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:28.480]  strong cities you an initiative that actually in DC and LA and Chicago are
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:36.160]  building UN substations UN embassies that will nexus with police and others to
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.200]  make sure the police and local governments are behaving correctly now
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:41.680]  why do they want local police Swartz and Eger heads up the
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:45.560]  immunization program of the UN they can't get the states to go along with
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:49.800]  carbon taxes or the feds to pass it so Obama does it by executive at the top
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:54.000]  illegally they come into the cities fly these mayors and people around
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:59.640]  literally to the finest $5,000 nine hotels jet copters hookers they don't
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:02.040]  call them that just here's your I mean folks I've talked to them it's come out
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:06.560]  in the news they go your city can get diplomatic immunity you can get a UN
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:10.600]  card and go to these UN junkets around the world and have immunity show so
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:14.080]  this is new forms of royalty so they're setting up the new forms of royalty
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:17.560]  they're gonna then come in with these commissions these these truth and
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:20.960]  reconciliation commissions that's all the demonization of police is about a lot
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:26.320]  of it legitimate but the end is evil to then globalize them and if they get
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:30.800]  certified by the UN if they fall and become political police and go after
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:34.800]  people's speech and guns and the rest of it the UN will give them political
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:39.880]  cover and sucker aiding and abetting a sucker so this is the system you already
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:44.360]  see the UN at the border saying you know we're gonna sue Arizona we're gonna sue
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:48.120]  Arpaio and they are now because you're arresting people you're following the law
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:51.760]  if somebody doesn't have ID and is drunk driving I mean in Travis County other
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:54.960]  cities they are above the law illegals we're not against the illegals it just
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:58.440]  shows how they're a protected group because it's part of a program now
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:02.080]  continuing there's hundreds of ways they're gonna counter strike us but make
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:07.200]  no mistake they they legalize the CIA operating domestically was already
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:11.040]  happening with quote deception last year that was in the Washington Post that was
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:16.760]  in foreign affairs we played the Pentagon press releases literally saying don't
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:20.680]  run we're your friends quote the army undersecretary undersecretary defense
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:24.800]  you can watch the hour video saying we're sorry we've lied to you now we're
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.120]  gonna be involved in every town in the city interfacing with you with the truth
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:33.040]  and so they've embedded all these psyops people that overthrow other countries
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:39.360]  and controlled Iraq and over through Ukraine they are now embedded and people
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:43.040]  are getting off on it people are walking up to Hollywood Stars saying watch it
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:47.040]  I'm CIA flashing badges and they're literally just been in it six months
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:52.200]  they're not even CIA they're just adjunct commas are literal let me just give
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:56.840]  you more data we need more data just remember three months ago it was
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:00.240]  mainstream build newspaper people didn't believe it when info wars reported on
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:06.180]  it they're actually hiring at Facebook in Germany former high-level Stasi the
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:11.400]  worst police state ever to work at Facebook and censor people and then
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:14.880]  report to police and people are fined or arrested for just saying I don't think
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.840]  we should have open borders I mean Germany is under martial law show is
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:22.840]  France demonstrations are banned but the left is allowed to and attack police
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:25.880]  because they're getting ready to overthrow even the local governments
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:29.280]  folks this is the central empires have taken over the countries they're now
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.840]  going in taken over the local jurisdiction so the great awakening has
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:41.600]  happened and people like Kurt Russell people like Matt Drudge people who
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:45.800]  who everybody knew was a patriot I mean I knew that six seven eight years ago but
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:49.200]  now they're coming out saying it's here they're coming it's tyranny it's real
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:53.960]  they're ringing the alarm which is a normal man would do okay and in a world
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:57.560]  of cowards it is heroic to do what Matt Drudge has done I mean the guy is an
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:01.080]  absolute hero and not because he links to us it gives us traffic it's about a
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:05.360]  war folks he's putting on the line he's chosen not to crap his pants and he's
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:09.960]  chosen to take security measures watch what he's doing but at the same time
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:13.080]  double down because he's been harassed he's been threatened he's been messed
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:16.960]  with so if we instead of being a coward he goes he's going all the way Russell I
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:20.640]  guarantee you behind the scenes has been threatened I met with special forces
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:24.440]  people last week I have been talked to generals on and on fair obviously had the
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:27.840]  former head of the NSA on yesterday technical group they actually ran the

[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:38.320]  dentist he was the head guy but then talk to other dentists he goes I will my
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:43.320]  dad called like 15 dentist and at different firms and places people he
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:46.720]  knew that it worked for them they said most of them had gotten visits in the
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:49.720]  last year or others hadn't but they could call a month later and say yeah they
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:54.960]  were here different groups I mean folks this is a full show the slash Nazi
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:00.440]  rollout okay and let me tell you they're they're identifying people the
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:04.480]  idiots they send don't know they're all compartmentalized who they know could be
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:07.800]  leaders but then a lot of people won't resist the system if they've already
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:13.480]  been approached and said oh we think you're a good guy join with us so 15
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:16.560]  years ago they were getting the CEOs of major companies 10 years ago they were
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:19.280]  getting the mid-level people and the heads of power plants and chemical
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:23.480]  plants and folks that really might need an emergency license to kill here's your
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:26.960]  card you got a concealed carry you went through our secret course if you see
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:30.120]  somebody planting a bomb you know or something at the power plant take them
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:33.800]  out well that's what all citizens is civil defense should do so they take
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:37.320]  something that sounds reasonable you know they go into farmer groups just come
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:41.560]  out in the news under the rural affairs commission run by the Pentagon under
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:44.800]  Obama look this up they go we need you to look for Alcada in your area in the
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.080]  cornfields in Missouri or wherever they go to the hotel meeting it's a two-day
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:52.360]  thing they show them a five-minute deal of ISIS and within five to ten minutes
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:55.880]  they're already into patriots they're already into gun owners they're already
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:58.760]  into veterans they mix it in to look for drugs you know because hopefully they
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:02.760]  can find some of that and you're like oh drugs aren't good they're shipping them
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:07.400]  in folks so so I'm saying we're there's a huge awakening happening there's a
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:13.240]  giant explosive time here but at the same time they're also now going to pure
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:16.840]  lies pure demonization saying we run demonstrations we have nothing to do
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:21.720]  with saying we terrorized Austin had you know scare gun scares going zero
[01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:27.640]  involvement saying I hate black people are saying I'm a drug dealer saying I'm
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:33.760]  a just you name it in mainstream news in concerted efforts hundreds of articles
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:38.760]  per day per day Matt I was in over 300 on Monday
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:44.120]  Chicago Tribune Washington Post I mean Miami Herald I mean Austin American
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:47.160]  States when I got calls about it people going you didn't you think we had a
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:51.720]  moon landing you you know you don't you're not involved the Boston bombing I
[01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:57.800]  mean folks you're talking hardcore so in the past they would just kill me but
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:02.600]  because of the info war that would make me a martyr plus like shark teeth I've
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:07.760]  got rows of people ready to replace me okay and so instead they are murdering
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:13.760]  who I am right now they are killing who Alex Jones is and look Jesse Ventura has
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:16.880]  his problems politically I don't agree with him on quite a bit of things but
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:22.280]  he he did get politically assassinate you know the whole Chris Kyle thing they
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:26.800]  could pull similar things on me this is all a sign we're having a huge effect
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:30.840]  they wouldn't be doing all of this if we weren't hitting the zeitgeist and when
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:34.440]  info wars is growing exponentially right now so I want to give you kind of the
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:39.560]  state of the info wars union here on the success we're having and realize when
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:42.760]  you tell friends and family to tune in when you direct them info wars dot com
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:46.840]  forward slash show they can download the podcast watch the live feeds you know
[01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:50.760]  whatever if you're listening on AM and FM stations tell your friends and family
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:56.280]  to tune into that you are the info warriors now they're gonna strike back a
[01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:58.960]  bunch of ways I'm gonna be doing some special reports that go through how
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:03.360]  they're doing this but the model because it's total totalitarianism in China they
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:07.800]  admit this in Australia the US you name it the model for internet censorship is
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:13.720]  gonna be phased in Chinese style net censorship net IDs net taxes three
[01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:17.880]  strikes in your outnet rules but before they get to that they're gonna phase in
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:23.040]  it started starts this next year just you know ten days or so or less I guess
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:29.520]  nine days in China and they're already lining up with Facebook Google all of
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:35.440]  McGreen with China Microsoft to implement these systems where China already
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:39.960]  does it and then they beta test there and then bring in here and our stories on
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:45.160]  drudge report dot com we do a document cam over here and of course drudge gets
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:48.400]  how incredibly important this is we've been mentioning this for the last few
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:51.440]  months but now it's a critical mass because the Chinese have released the
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:58.400]  full details everything you do everything you do in China from your credit
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:03.280]  score to what you buy to discount cards your internet records to what you say on
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:07.880]  social networks is integrated into an algorithm and if you criticize the
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:12.120]  government basically wants you can't even buy or sell you can't get a hotel
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:15.480]  you can't travel I notice all this is being phased in here with the IRS saying
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:18.880]  if we start auditing you or don't even start an investigation you can't fly
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:24.520]  internal checkpoints I mean it's on folks show Europe's doing the same thing
[01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:29.160]  this is all being brought in it's being implemented I mean this is classical
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:33.080]  tyranny it's here and again the Supreme Court Justice told drudge next year
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:35.840]  they're coming for you and then they have the head of the you know the heads
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:39.780]  of the FCC and yeah we're coming for your free speech talk radio internet you
[01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:44.200]  name it I mean because they can't beat us folks they're flaming tyrants they're
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:49.600]  flaming crooks annihilating our country spying on us illegally opening our
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:53.280]  borders having the border patrol complete the smuggling process I mean this
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:58.040]  is the globalist offensive this is the war against America and globally there's
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:01.280]  a world awakening so they know in algorithms and they admit this that
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:04.040]  revolutions are coming just because food prices in the third world have gone
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:07.320]  up past 50% they know at that point riot start they already have their
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:11.640]  operatives ready to steer the revolutions into radical al-Qaeda radical
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:16.000]  ISIS radical al-Nusra Saudi Arabian driven same thing here they're gonna
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.280]  have a big communist kill the cops shoot the cops burn the cities they're gonna
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:23.640]  let them do it order the cops to stand down and then say cops it's your fault

[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:34.200]  real coup 100% what I'm telling you's happening now I knew this was coming but
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:39.120]  to see it actually happen is so bold is so over the top that I get why people
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:42.760]  just can't believe it that's why they came out and said Alex Jones believes
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:46.800]  martial law this summer when we never said that we said Jade Helm was a beta
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:49.280]  test and I'm sorry I talked to folks involved in it they said you're
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:52.520]  absolutely right shook my hand and they said and we're not stupid when they're
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:57.280]  telling us that this is for America we're absolutely waking up so the good
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:00.200]  ace in the hole one of the big ones we got quite a few aces in the hole we got
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:04.400]  the ace of spades baby we got all four of the aces is that the military we
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:08.960]  preemptively warned them they're not stupid either the police and others and
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:12.240]  we got the jump on the globalist if we use the fact that we have this info the
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:17.480]  great awakening is here it's on but everyone's to go to drudgereport.com
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:21.440]  everyone should use this Christmas holiday season they want to focus you
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:25.400]  talking about terrorism and fear so that you give your rights up now this
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:28.480]  Christmas talk about how the globalist run the terror how the FBI was ordered
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:31.800]  on to stop the two shooters in San Bernardino how they actually did have
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:37.200]  all their NSA data and use that to block the FBI they use the NSA this is on
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:42.880]  record the Justice Department did to send it Justice Department Civil Rights
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:49.240]  Crimes Task Force to investigate the FBI in San Bernardino two years ago to shut
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:54.560]  down the investigation in the mosque and of the two shooters whether whatever you
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:58.320]  think happened with the case they was ordered to stand out boom inside job in
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:04.120]  that the globalist did that then when we got attacked the answers give us more
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:06.880]  power a hundred billion a year in intelligence domestically isn't enough
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:12.320]  see this is the coup this is the takeover of infrastructure of information of
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:17.320]  spying on the public of the smart grids of the taxes of the control of taxing you
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:22.600]  by the mile of driverless cars of the smart meters of the stingrays and yes
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:25.840]  it sounds overwhelming and the globalist one reason they leave me alone
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:30.280]  they're demonizing me assassinating my character straw man but but another
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:34.840]  reason it's an argument they have and I've been told this and this argument's
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:39.800]  now failing but they believed a long time ago that I was so real that we were
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:43.200]  so hardcore cuz I just I just believe I don't care most people are cowards I'm
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:46.440]  looking for real men and women that aren't realized the real fear is letting
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:50.160]  this take over happen I'm looking for real it's not you know all the chumps and
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:53.200]  all the followers and all the cowards could suck their thumbs and delusionally
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:56.440]  feel like winners all day but not be real winners I'm going all the way and
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:58:00.820]  that resonates with a few good men out there and it's expanding like Matt
[01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:04.360]  Drudge like Kurt Russell like David Knight like Jakari Jackson like Darren
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:07.600]  McBrain like Rob do like the people in our you know like Nico in there and

[01:59:49.040 --> 02:00:13.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:21.600]  we are on the march the empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:27.360]  network welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and with me now is
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:32.240]  Alex Jones and he's been doing a dynamite job breaking down the awakening of
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:34.960]  people of course as he was talking about Kurt Russell one of the things Kurt
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:38.760]  Russell said was hey dude we need to have guns because if you're gonna try to
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:42.040]  pull something you need to be worried about what I'm gonna do and that's
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:45.800]  exactly what Alex was talking about anyone to say this is for corrupt
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:49.600]  government yeah yeah and he's come out with more stuff as they attack him
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:53.120]  doubling down and that's the spirit and so they're really trying to intimidate
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:57.320]  prominent people because if Hollywood starts going public and saying we're not
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:01.360]  liberal we're not conservative we're patriots that unifies America 1776 we
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:04.840]  want freedom we want lower taxes we don't want global banks exempt we don't
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:07.360]  want bailouts we don't want all these foreign wars we don't want to find
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:12.760]  al-Qaeda that unifies America unifies black white police citizen everybody
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:18.640]  teacher you know doctor lawyer it doesn't matter come together folks but to
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:22.360]  see the oldest nibbling enemies they've got in the controlled media that have
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:25.160]  been given the green light I mean stuff they never do just stuff we can win
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:30.040]  lawsuits all day it shows they're going for broke I mean they are going for
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:34.920]  broke they have been authorized because this is government directed just like
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:37.800]  vaccine makers put out stuff they're directed to you know put all sorts of
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:41.120]  horrible stuff in because they've been given immunity well these people haven't
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:44.520]  been given immunity from God they haven't been given immunity from justice and the
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:51.720]  law of nature and we are the response to that you are the response to that so we
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:54.720]  have new listeners though they're like yeah right a credit score for your
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:58.200]  political views and criticizing the government and if your friends aren't
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:02.440]  the proper people your score gets lowered oh yeah that's not happening I know
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:09.120]  we have new listeners that are still in denial here's BBC October 2015 this is
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:13.720]  months ago China social credit Beijing sets up huge system and it goes through
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:18.280]  and admits it all and acts like it's good see because England is bringing in
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:23.480]  this stuff where you go out to a drop Prophet Muhammad event at a church and
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:26.840]  everybody gets arrested and they're not allowed to that stirves the peace that's
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:31.120]  going to upset somebody your free speech free speech came out of Magna
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:36.160]  Carta 1215 Tony Blair before he left office said I'm proud of the fact that
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:41.360]  I killed Magna Carta that was a headline my goal is to kill Magna Carta in 2000
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:46.720]  in 1996 we got elected years later he said I killed Magna Carta I mean these
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:51.120]  are declarations of naked tyranny and so you can go read the story at Drudge
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:57.760]  Report.com where it actually admits all this and this is the ultimate form of
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:03.480]  wearing a yellow armband on your arm I mean I'm telling you we need to go down
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:07.120]  to UT and actually say we're gonna have conservatives and gun owners wear
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:10.160]  armbands or we're gonna show people that have said racist things that were
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:15.600]  armbands so we know who they are and you say Obama wants it or it's for
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:20.760]  Hillary in Austin it's 8 out of 10 will sign it in LA 9 out of 10 these are real
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:24.160]  interviews we do I mean we show you people going yeah we should abort kids up
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:28.320]  stage three you know for Obama we want to abort children up days three
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:32.360]  absolutely because again they're under mind control they feel like winners
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:35.320]  because they're part of the winning team even though it's screwing them over
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:39.880]  taking their future bankrupting them they don't have any solidarity because
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:44.560]  they were never taught kinship honor they were never taught how business is
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:49.920]  really done on handshakes on people knowing you're for real they've killed
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:53.720]  real culture and I just see these floundering men everywhere and floundering
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:57.760]  women that don't understand how the world really works folks even if you were
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:01.240]  as sociopaths a lot of sociopathic they get ahead in this system not caring
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:04.920]  about anybody you actually really get ahead long-term caring about folks
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:08.480]  building real communities and the fake left gets a lot of the good well-meaning
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:11.560]  people under their control with that message if you want to be a real

[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:30.800]  Alex was just talking about Kurt Russell talking about how he just gave
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:34.600]  another interview speaking with a journalist Marlo Stern he says I'm a
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:39.120]  hardcore libertarian great to hear that because you know it was really good to
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:42.960]  hear him as I pointed out when Alex and I were talking about this when he he did
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:45.600]  that interview with Jeffrey Wells and Jeffrey Wells kept pushing him on the
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:49.400]  gun issue pushing pushing pushing and Kurt wanted to talk about the movie that
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:53.680]  he's doing hateful eight and finally he just lost it he goes look understand
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:56.880]  where you're coming from he kept saying you know it's a movie it's set in the
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:01.400]  Civil War it's a piece of art it's like a painting or it's like a piece of music
[02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:04.160]  or something you're trying to make this political I'm trying to talk about the
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:07.640]  movie but that's all the guy wanted to talk about was the movie want to put it
[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:11.120]  in the perspective saying we need to take people's guns because we've had this
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:16.000]  terrorist shooting in San Bernardino and he says like you're gonna have people
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:21.240]  have guns for a reason it goes you need to understand that if somebody's there
[02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:25.840]  they need to know just like in a hockey game if I'm coming at the goalie he's
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:28.720]  wondering what I'm gonna do so these people need to wonder what we're going
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:32.000]  to do then he broke it down further he started talking about the founding
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.880]  fathers on a subsequent interview but this is what he had to say with Marlo
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:38.560]  Stern he said I'm not a Bill Maurer liberal libertarian that's faux
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:42.240]  libertarianism the other thing I found is a lot of liberals and Hollywood are
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:47.520]  faux liberals yeah like people who will just follow the crowd they they want the
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:50.560]  guy with that uniform a lot of Republicans in Hollywood are faux
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:54.720]  conservatives he says when I was a young guy I was finding myself not quite
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:58.120]  being able to see the things that were going on and buying into a political
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:01.400]  culture I didn't know what to do so I finally said hey when I go back and see
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:04.720]  what the founding fathers were all about see how that stacked up because then I
[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:09.600]  found libertarianism they were pretty radical guys they were damn smart I just
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:14.880]  believe in that old-time stuff I think they had great ideas me too you know when
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:20.320]  I looked at this it was amazing to me to go back and to read some of the things
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:25.480]  that Thomas Jefferson wrote I mean one of the things that really just made me
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:30.800]  set up and pay attention I remember my wife got a book for me that had all the
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:35.560]  inaugural addresses of the presidents and I was sick at the time so I had
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:38.960]  nothing better do I mean it's kind of a dry read you would think wouldn't you but
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:44.880]  when I got to Thomas Jefferson and he said I'm proud to announce and this is
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:49.760]  beginning of his second term I'm proud to announce that by eliminating useless
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:54.280]  offices and other things we have been able to eliminate all internal taxation
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:12:00.040]  in the United States so we can say what laborer what farmer what mechanic knows
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:06.360]  a tax man wow that's powerful that's powerful stuff that was his goal we
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:09.800]  could do that again you know we could eliminate the income tax you know to
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:13.280]  talk about libertarians let's talk about Harry Brown ran a couple of times and on
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:17.040]  the libertarian party and he had a very good insight at the time he said you
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:22.280]  know he went back he did the numbers and he said what would it take to eliminate
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:26.360]  the income tax completely how far would we have to roll government back
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:31.200]  government spending it's just a couple of years and he would you and today I did
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:34.840]  the numbers myself today because if you look at the amount of money that comes
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:39.000]  in from the personal income tax as a percentage of what they spend and you
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  take that back and you take the budget back a proportion amount you have to go
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.720]  back to 2004 could we live with a government that was the size that it
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:50.280]  was in 2004 would that be a total catastrophe did what you know were we
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:54.200]  dying in the streets when we didn't have a gigantic government like we today
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:57.800]  course they're they're growing by leaps and bounds aren't they Republicans and
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:01.880]  Democrats are pushing for that but we could get rid I mean not talking about
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:06.120]  playing with the the tax brackets and saying well anybody that makes this much
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:08.840]  or more we're gonna go to this percentage or that percentage yeah that's what
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:12.440]  they they get down all that detail they'll argue about that on the GOP
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:16.720]  debate or what I got a better tax plan this guy hey how about a tax plan that
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:21.920]  gets rid of the personal income tax completely and backs it up with only
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:27.560]  enough cuts to go back to the size that it was in 2004 now see that's that's what
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:30.960]  libertarianism is about libertarianism is about making sure that you're not a
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:34.680]  slave of the government that the government serves you that the government
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:38.960]  is there to protect your individual liberties that's how we started out with
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:46.000]  this now I want to talk about something that oh before I go to the drug war yeah
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.920]  to back up what Kurt Russell was saying you know he said you know there's a lot
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:53.600]  of faux conservatives out there there's a lot of faux Republicans in Hollywood
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:57.480]  yeah there's a lot of faux conservatives and and liberals everywhere it's not
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:01.520]  just Hollywood it's everywhere there are people out there who say oh well you
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:06.120]  know I'm I'm voting Democrat because I like this policy I'm voting Republican
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:10.600]  because I like this policy but when their guy gets in and violates their
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:15.200]  principles they'll give them a pass because they're Republican or Democrat we
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:18.120]  do have some real liberals out there who will stand up and fight it like I
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:23.000]  mentioned it to Alex and in the last segment when he is there John Cusack
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:30.720]  opposed very vehemently Obama's moves against civil liberties he's not going
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:35.040]  to play the party line I want to play for you a new Republican senator they
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:38.880]  got elected he recently just started gave some of his first speeches I think
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:41.520]  his first one was back in mid-November I'm not sure if it was this speech or
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:45.720]  not is a 15 minute speech I just want to play you the first one minute of it
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:50.240]  this is Senator Ben Sasse from Nebraska and he talks about the danger of
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:55.680]  signing on to government by executive order from the president how dangerous
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:15:01.440]  is that that folks is dictatorship dictators are essentially people who
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:06.240]  speak the law the law is in their mouth whatever they say goes they don't have a
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:10.480]  legislative procedure they don't have a Congress that's going to enact this or
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:15.200]  legislature they just say it and it's law that is fundamentally what executive
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:18.560]  orders are about it's a violation of the Constitution it's a violation of
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:22.560]  everything we've come to understand what democracy and good government and a
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:27.200]  republic is all about and that is that we have a rule of law we protect
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:31.080]  individual liberty and we have principles in this country let's listen to what
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:36.320]  this Republican senator says to both Republicans and the Democrats imagine
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:40.880]  President Trump has been propelled into the White House with 300 electoral
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:46.200]  votes having one mainly by the force of his personality by calling BS on this
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:52.000]  town and by his promise to get things done by acting unilaterally the first
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:57.840]  hundred days are huge he signs an order that turns the Peace Corps into stone
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:02.840]  masons to build the southern wall he shutters the Department of Education and
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:07.000]  by executive order he turns the Department of Interior into the
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:14.120]  classiest oil company the world has ever known what happens next with those
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:18.000]  who've stayed silent about executive overreach over the last seven years
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:23.080]  suddenly find religion after years of legislative atrophy would Congress
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:27.480]  spring into action and remember its supposed power of the purse and what
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:32.200]  about Republicans after having raged against a supposedly lawless president
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:36.760]  would many suddenly find that they're actually okay with a strongman president
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:43.840]  so long as he's wearing the same colored jersey they are exactly great speech and
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:48.640]  he goes on unpacking that for the senators who really most of them don't
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:53.720]  care it's really for the American people a great new senator Ben sass and what
[02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:57.200]  he's pointing out to them is you want to you want to stand by and let this guy
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:01.640]  get away with being a dictator because he wears your team uniform guess what
[02:17:01.640 --> 02:17:05.440]  you're gonna get a dictator who stands against everything that you believe and
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:08.960]  the other side is gonna support him as well that's one of the reasons why the
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:12.760]  Republicans don't impeach Obama when he exceeds his constitutional authority
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:16.560]  because they're waiting in line because they want that same kind of power
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:20.000]  that's what we've seen in the Speaker of the House situation we saw them
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:25.480]  complain about Nancy Pelosi dumping massive thousand multi thousand page
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:29.360]  bills on them at the very last minute saying you got to pass this we only got
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:32.800]  24 hours you got to pass this we're gonna shut the government down then what
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:38.480]  did they do with Boehner he did exactly the same thing and here we are now we
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:44.840]  got Paul Ryan oh the very first thing that he does is a massive massive
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:48.400]  spending bill and we're gonna talk about that when we come back but I want to
[02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:54.720]  talk first about what's going on with our new drugs are and as a way of
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:58.720]  introducing this I'm gonna come back well I will still get a couple of minutes
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:02.120]  in this segment here's an article from the Washington Post the pot business
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:06.600]  may be legal but newspapers cannot run ads for it says the US Postal Service
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:10.360]  they say newspapers and half the states are breaking the law if they mail
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:14.600]  publications containing ads for marijuana products even though the states
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:19.200]  have legalized pot says the US Post Office now they make an interesting
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:23.760]  admission in this they say it's still legal and still illegal under federal
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:28.920]  law understand that then the feds are not going in and arresting people in
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:32.960]  Colorado Washington and Oregon for violating this law why are they not
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:38.640]  arresting them if it's still illegal under federal law why do we have a drug
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:43.520]  czar who goes on 60 minutes this last weekend and says don't call me drugs are
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:47.880]  I don't like to be associated with the kind of failed policies that we've had
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:53.560]  and he says really failed policies yes yes it's a total failure but he's not
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:57.320]  going to stop it he's not going to stop it he's going to continue doing it
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:01.760]  because you know part he is required in that position we talked about that when
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:07.960]  we come back he's required in that position to never do anything again to
[02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:12.280]  support drugs that are illegal he can't even fund studies to see if any of the
[02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:18.080]  drugs that are on schedule one have any uses understand where these things came
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:22.160]  from just like we're talking about with the climate changes as Alex was talking
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:28.440]  about with the movement of our police under a UN agenda with the movement of
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:33.800]  climate as a UN agenda the drug war was a UN agenda understand that
[02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:38.160]  conservatives need to understand those four schedules those magic schedules
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:41.520]  schedule one through four where they categorize all these drugs that was
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:47.080]  laid out verbatim by the United Nations ten years before it was repeated verbatim
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:50.680]  by Richard Nixon as he began and declared the war on drugs we come back
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:54.960]  we're going to break that down for you we'll be right back

[02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:14.040]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today we're
[02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:17.240]  going to go back to what I was just talking about in the last segment the
[02:24:17.240 --> 02:24:20.800]  Washington Post article saying that the pot business may be legal in many
[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:26.280]  states but now the US Postal Service is sending out notifications to newspapers
[02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:31.240]  that they cannot run ads for what is has been declared in their state as a legal
[02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:37.920]  business and this brings up a core issue on how we get our freedom back many
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:41.760]  people on the right get motivated by guns many people on the left get
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:46.240]  motivated by this insane war on drugs we've got a drug czar who went on CBS
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:51.600]  60 minutes this last Sunday and said don't call me a drug czar he says reminds
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:56.160]  me of an authoritarian approach he doesn't like I'm putting words in his
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:25:01.440]  mouth what he says is go quote its failed policies and failed practices for
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:06.160]  the last 44 years that this has been involved with us and I have to say to
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:13.080]  the conservatives who support this insane failed policy that this is a UN
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:16.360]  agenda you need to understand where this is coming from you need to understand
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:20.640]  why they did this and of course he talks about it in terms of it being failed he
[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:25.000]  says it's it's given us a costly bloated prison system it has failed to
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:30.560]  curtail Americans drug habits yeah that's the obvious outcome about it but
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:36.640]  also understand that this has given us a militarized police force to fight this
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:42.200]  war that they have declared on American users this is far worse than alcohol
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:45.440]  prohibition they never went after the users with that they never militarized
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:51.240]  the police with that it didn't last that long interestingly though it was done
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:55.640]  constitutionally unlike this and when we go back to the story this is what brings
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:25:59.840]  up the interesting legal issues they point out that in November in Portland
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:03.880]  a postal the postal district there issued a memo to newspaper publishers
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:08.760]  telling them they're breaking the law by running ads for pot and then using the
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:14.160]  U.S. mail to deliver their papers well what about that Democrats in the state
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:16.640]  were upset about that they said the agency should respect the voters
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:21.160]  decisions to legalize pot well why would they respect that they don't
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:24.720]  respect the Constitution they swore to they said in this article from the
[02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:28.360]  Washington Post there's a twist the postal service apparently has no
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:34.080]  authority to stop the mailers if their publications contain pot ads the new
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:38.720]  policy directs postmasters to send a report to the local postal inspection
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:43.080]  service a law enforcement arm of the post office well guess what not only do
[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:47.840]  they not have any authority to do anything about this they don't have any
[02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:53.600]  authority for their entire prohibition war just as I said how did we get two of
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:58.120]  the 20 some odd amendments that are in the Constitution one of them gave
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:03.040]  specific authority to outlaw alcohol why did they need that why did they go to
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:05.800]  all the trouble to create a constitutional amendment it's because
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:10.480]  there is no authority for the federal government to prohibit anything
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:14.400]  understand that anything and that includes your prescription drugs with the
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:19.120]  FDA because the FDA has got their own prohibition program going as well so
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:22.400]  they have this illegal war on drugs we got two constitutional amendments one of
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:26.920]  them to prohibit give them the power and the authority to prohibit alcohol
[02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:31.800]  another one to revoke that those are two of the 20 some odd amendments but we
[02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:35.520]  don't have any amendment for pot we don't have one for a heroin or cocaine or
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:39.320]  any of these things now the interesting thing that this guy had to say as I
[02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:43.600]  pointed out was okay we've got a giant prison system yeah talk about it being
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:47.360]  bloated we got more people per capita than any country in the history of the
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:52.400]  world many times more than you see in authoritarian regimes like China and it
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:55.240]  hasn't done anything to get people off drugs but it's given us a militarized
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:59.080]  police force it's given us corrupted law enforcement and court systems where they
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:04.040]  act as thieves on the road with the fiction of civil asset forfeiture where
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:07.440]  they do not give you due process they say no this is a civil action I'm coming
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:12.680]  after your property you see them saying the US versus a stack of cash and
[02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:17.000]  certain denominations the US versus a car the US versus a plane they just
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:21.520]  steal your property under the legal fiction and it is total fiction that
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:26.520]  somehow it was involved in this crime that is a lie that is an Alice in
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:30.400]  Wonderland lie it is absolutely corrupted our legal system it has turned
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:34.360]  our police who use this who often fund their police departments off of this it
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:39.560]  has turned them into highway robbers it's also given a lucrative monopoly to
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:44.920]  organize crime and it has had not only has it not stopped drug use but understand
[02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:49.920]  that just like alcohol it has increased the intensity of what they're trying to
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:53.960]  prohibit it always does that and it increases the diversity and the
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:58.440]  availability of it when you create a black market out of something and so this
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:02.280]  guy comes back and he comes at it from a perspective this is Michael Botticelli
[02:29:02.280 --> 02:29:07.840]  he's now the current drugs are and he says that he takes this position because
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:12.200]  he was once an alcoholic now how did he get off of that what you've been saved
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:17.320]  by an amendment to prohibit alcohol no course he wouldn't but he went through
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:21.440]  it with he had to confront this he says he was arrested he lost his apartment he
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:24.840]  lost all of his money the judge said to him well you can continue to lose
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:29.400]  everything and go to jail or you can get some help and at that point he went to
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:34.640]  AA and he talks about how we need to treat this as a medical issue exactly
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:39.880]  right but he will not stop treating it like it's a law enforcement issue that's
[02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:44.440]  the problem that's the lie they're trying to save face by talking about this
[02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:48.080]  because I don't want you to realize they have no legal authority stay with us
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:56.200]  we'll be right back the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:58.480 --> 02:30:03.960]  the website the Daily Beast has accused info wars of putting on a mock mass
[02:30:03.960 --> 02:30:08.640]  shooting that we had nothing to do with their article is titled conspiracy
[02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:13.180]  theorists terrorized our town in which they write info wars worse humans
[02:30:13.180 --> 02:30:18.440]  invaded Texas to stage a mass shooting we counter-protested being the author and
[02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:23.120]  his friends outnumbering them 20 into one they still don't believe that Sandy
[02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:28.080]  Hook ever happened as far as the Sandy Hook accusation we discussed that in
[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:33.320]  great detail on the December 21st 2015 edition of the Alex Jones show so I'll
[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:37.680]  focus on the rest of the article the author who took great pride in making
[02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:42.040]  fart noises like a seven-year-old child went on to accuse us of stringing the
[02:30:42.040 --> 02:30:46.840]  media along and then hosting the event in an area with no cameras once again we
[02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:51.280]  did report on the event like dozens of other news agencies but we had nothing

[02:33:08.280 --> 02:33:16.440]  war welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we were just
[02:33:16.440 --> 02:33:21.040]  talking about this new drugs are the fact that he says we're in a failed
[02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:27.600]  policy a failed war on drugs going on for 44 years and of course this is
[02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:31.120]  something the office that he is in right now was created in 1988 it was
[02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:36.000]  bipartisan effort the first time the term drugs are which this current drugs are
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:40.640]  Michael Botticelli doesn't like first time that was used in the media
[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:46.320]  publicly was by Joe Biden say that's the guys on the inside the guys who push
[02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:52.480]  these head fakes these illegal unauthorized unconstitutional massive
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:57.280]  movements from the United Nations these guys get rewarded with vice
[02:33:57.280 --> 02:34:04.080]  presidencies and that sort of thing okay it's also enacted first by George HW
[02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:09.320]  Bush let me tell you something this ought to be anathema to liberals just in
[02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:14.120]  terms of the legal situations the mandatory minimums a number of people
[02:34:14.120 --> 02:34:16.800]  that they lock up who are innocent people it ought to be anathema to
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:20.200]  conservatives the fact that the government would come in and confiscate
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:24.200]  your property things like cars airplanes without even charging you with a crime
[02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:27.120]  let alone finding you can evicted they ought to be concerned about that
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:30.240]  encroachment on their property ought to be concerned about how much this costs
[02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:34.280]  this guy has been alcohol-free that's why he's talking about treatment or
[02:34:34.280 --> 02:34:39.160]  things been alcohol-free for 27 years but now he's in charge of a 26 billion
[02:34:39.160 --> 02:34:45.520]  dollar budget 26 billion dollar budget 15 government agencies to wage this
[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:49.000]  idiotic war on drugs that was created by the United Nations that's another
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:53.320]  reason for conservatives to oppose this understand that by law the drugs are
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:59.480]  must oppose any attempt to legalize the use in any form of illicit drugs they
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:04.640]  cannot even appropriate any funds to study any of these drugs to see if they
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:10.600]  have reasonable uses and of course they do and of course we know that marijuana
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:14.680]  even though it's a schedule one drug which says there is no medical use for
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:19.920]  this drug we know that's a lie everything about this is is based on a lie
[02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:24.120]  and conservatives and liberals need to call this for what it is they need to
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:28.220]  say the drugs are has no clothes now I want to go to a quick video report here
[02:35:28.220 --> 02:35:31.660]  this is an article about cops demolishing a single mom's home by
[02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:34.960]  mistake destroying the children's Christmas presents and offering no
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:39.160]  help what is this based on where did we get this kind of action this is a
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:43.680]  product of the war on drugs these SWAT teams that smash into people's homes
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:50.120]  let's play that report it's not pretty Vonda Macklin picks up the pieces it's
[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:53.720]  like a destroying of your dream you know after authorities tore up her
[02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:58.120]  neighbor's home poking holes in the walls with an armored military vehicle to
[02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:02.800]  coax out the suspect Joplin honky member Doug Alexis Cherokee County Sheriff
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:06.680]  David Grove says when authorities first entered the home they used an infrared
[02:36:06.680 --> 02:36:12.680]  camera and discovered heat coming from the attic it appeared using that tool
[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:17.840]  that there was somebody in the attic as it turns out now we know that that was
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:21.880]  incorrect but nonetheless that was the information we were operating under at
[02:36:21.880 --> 02:36:26.360]  the time the standoff lasted more than 20 hours although it was long sheriff
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:30.400]  Grove says waiting it out was the safest strategy for law enforcement and
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:34.760]  residents some may suggest you just rush in and we could have cleared that house
[02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:39.200]  in a matter of minutes and that's true but if there was a suspect in there and
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:43.360]  he was shot one of our officers or something else happened and he was able
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:49.360]  to breach the perimeter and jeopardize the safety of the residents nearby that's
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:53.400]  not a risk I'm willing to take Vonda says the homeowner repeatedly told
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:59.120]  authorities Alexis was not inside you know obviously they didn't know you know
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:02.820]  this going by somebody's tip that obviously wasn't a good tip friends and
[02:37:02.820 --> 02:37:06.240]  neighbors like Vonda collect the family's belongings and board up the
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:11.040]  windows to deter looters she says the single mother of sex is devastated after
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:14.960]  this ordeal probably the most hardest part of seeing them there was a rip her
[02:37:14.960 --> 02:37:19.440]  Christmas tree up and you know and out the window it goes in Galena dying
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:24.120]  Gerson vowed Fox 14 news that is a perfect metaphor for what the war on
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:27.640]  drugs is doing to our country as a whole here these guys show up there's some
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:31.640]  boogeyman they think in the attic he's not even there they pull back out
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:35.800]  surround the house do a siege for 20 hours and then come back in and proceed
[02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:39.120]  to destroy everything in the house they said it's like destroying your dream you
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:41.960]  know as she said probably the hardest thing is seeing that they ripped the
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:45.120]  Christmas tree apart and out the window it goes they say instead of
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:49.420]  apologizing or offering to help clean up the mess this guy said referred them
[02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:53.480]  to some vague FBI program they say that allegedly cleans up after cops wrongfully
[02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:57.760]  destroy a person's home what about when they wrongfully kill somebody so these
[02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:03.720]  no-knock militarized raids are product of this insane ineffective war on drugs
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:07.640]  it's not helping anybody it is destroying our country and now they're
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:12.520]  taking it to the next level with this quote-unquote war on terrorism now just
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:16.120]  so you know there is a free thought project has started a go fund me
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:19.360]  campaign to help Ms. Lane and her children so you might want to take a look
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:22.600]  at that see if you can help these people but let's do something to help our
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:27.120]  country let's do something to keep this from continually victimizing people
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:32.680]  this war on drugs is insane and of course it also involves the FDA the FDA
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:35.800]  wants to come in and say well you know even though you're a cancer patient and
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:39.120]  you're on a you know you've got a life-threatening disease we're not
[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:43.320]  going to give you access to this until we allow it until we test it see
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:49.720]  everything is prohibited unless expressly permitted that is exactly upside down
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:54.360]  from the way our country was set up now I want to go to this report without
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:57.600]  taking any more time because I want to be able to play the full thing as Alex
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:00.960]  was talking about we had I did a report a couple years ago called it's a
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:05.640]  wonderful lie based on it's a wonderful life because the Federal Reserve is
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:10.160]  based on a fundamental lie it was 100th anniversary at the time we did it and
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:13.520]  of course this was something that was ushered in in the wee hours of the
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:18.080]  morning on Christmas Eve just as we saw Obama push through the NDAA on a New
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:22.040]  Year's Eve we see this kind of stuff happening I think personally that
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:25.100]  they're going to do that with the Trans-Pacific Partnership I think is a
[02:39:25.100 --> 02:39:28.320]  very good chance they'll do that this year who knows they're always pushing
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:31.000]  this kind of stuff through but this breaks us down and it was very
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:35.360]  interesting because it continually got taken down you can now see it on because
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:37.680]  I've given us so much trouble on the main channel we don't put it on that
[02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:41.800]  anymore we put on our side channel this info wars news HD that's my YouTube
[02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:44.080]  channel there so you can see it there we're going to play it for you right
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:48.000]  now it's a wonderful lie
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:52.920]  over the last 100 years the Federal Reserve has created bubbles and burst
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:57.000]  them enslaved us with debt and destroyed our purchasing power through
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:02.760]  inflation yes it's been a wonderful lie for the bankers there are striking
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:06.640]  parallels in Frank Capra's it's a wonderful life to the lies and tricks
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:10.600]  that real bankers used to create the Federal Reserve human nature doesn't
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:16.760]  change and the greedy elite of 1913 in 2013 look and act a lot like Potter the
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:22.400]  banker in the movie and many Americans are left like George Bailey staring into
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:26.440]  the abyss as their dreams collapse and they face financial ruin do we live in
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:29.760]  a country that looks a lot more like Pottersville than Bedford Falls what
[02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:33.960]  does Frank Capra's film show us about how we got here and how we can get out
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:37.840]  when the Federal Reserve was created two days before Christmas a hundred years
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:43.440]  ago it was a culmination of six years of fraud fear and manipulation I've never
[02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:48.080]  really seen one but that's got all the air marks of being a run the panic of
[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:52.520]  1907 was used to shape public support for the Fed the panic was triggered by
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:56.280]  rumors that two major banks were about to become insolvent just as we see in the
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:41:01.440]  movie George there is a rumor around town that you close your doors is that
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:08.400]  true I am going all out to help in this crisis I have just guaranteed the bank
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:14.120]  sufficient funds to meet their needs they will close up for a week and then
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:20.760]  reopen just took over the bank I may lose a fortune but I am willing to
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:26.400]  guarantee your people too just tell them to bring their shares over here and I
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:31.880]  will pay 50 cents on the dollar or you never miss a trick do you Potter unfortunately
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:36.040]  JP Morgan got away with a deception and was able to shut down competitors and
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:41.280]  snapped up assets at fire cell prices take during the Depression for instance
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:46.680]  you and I were the only ones that kept our heads you saved the building alone I
[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:52.400]  saved all the rest yes well most people say you stole all the rest the envious
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:57.080]  ones say that George the suckers Charles Lindbergh senior warned people at the
[02:41:57.080 --> 02:42:00.240]  time of the creation of the Federal Reserve that it would not stop boom and
[02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:03.760]  bust cycles but would actually create them in order to benefit its private
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:08.120]  owners here's what he said the cause high prices all the Federal Reserve Board
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:12.400]  will do will be to lower the re-discount rate producing an expansion of credit
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:15.880]  and a rising stock market then when businessmen are adjusted to these
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:19.680]  conditions it can check prosperity and mid-career by arbitrarily raising the
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:23.120]  rate of interest they can cause a pendulum of a rising and falling market
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:27.320]  to swing gently back and forth or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate
[02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:32.160]  variation and in either case it will possess inside information as to the
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:35.160]  financial conditions and advanced knowledge of the coming change either
[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:40.200]  up or down this is the strangest most dangerous advantage ever placed in the
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:44.360]  hands of a special privilege class by any government that ever existed the
[02:42:44.360 --> 02:42:48.280]  system is private conducted for the sole purpose of a painting the greatest
[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:52.160]  possible profits from the use of other people's money they know in advance when
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:56.560]  to create panics to their advantage and they know when to stop panic inflation
[02:42:56.560 --> 02:43:01.680]  and deflation work equally well for them when they control the finance as we see
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:06.680]  in the movie not all lending institutions have the same motivations now
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:12.600]  you take this one is a pretty bishop you know the fellow that sits around all
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:19.080]  day on his brains in his taxi you know I happen to know the bank turned down this
[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:25.560]  loan but he comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:30.840]  dollars why well I handled that mr. Potter you have all the papers there is
[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:35.160]  salary insurance I can personally vouch for his character plenty of you yes sir
[02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:41.040]  huh you see if you shoot pool with some employee here you can come and borrow
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:48.440]  money what is that get us a discontented lazy rabble instead of a thrifty
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:53.240]  working class as a former FDIC chair said all too often the large banks use
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:56.760]  their models and their algorithms and if you don't fit in their boxes you don't
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:00.600]  get the loan and Dodd Frank legislation is tying the hands of small lenders
[02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:04.320]  shutting out buyers and shutting down lenders today there are fewer lenders
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:08.400]  than at any time the government has kept records ten thousand banks disappeared
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:14.040]  between 1984 and 2011 this town needs this measly one-horse institution if
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:19.440]  only to have some place where people can come without crawling the potter and the
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:22.840]  movie George gets to see what happens to the small town if Potter didn't have
[02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:26.880]  competition from credit unions and smaller lenders if it hadn't been for you
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:31.480]  yeah it hadn't been for me everybody be a lot better off my wife and my kids and
[02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:35.520]  my friends I mean look little fella what you go up and haunt somebody else yeah
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:42.160]  so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier I don't
[02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:47.880]  know I guess you're right it's both been better if I've never been born at all
[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:53.120]  Potter'sville the only businesses thriving are vice people are angry the
[02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:57.440]  town is filled with signs like keep moving keep off the grass Bert the cop
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:07.440]  actually shoots at George when he's running away and is no threat to anyone
[02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:12.560]  everyone is a renter no one has a stake now you're any bishop and you live in
[02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:16.200]  Bailey Park with your wife and kids look but what's the idea I live in a shack in
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:19.320]  Pottersville my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid and I never
[02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:23.600]  seen you before in my life see private property and everyone having a stake is
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:28.040]  the antidote to Pottersville here you're all businessman here daughter to make
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:31.160]  them better citizens doesn't make them better customers but whether it's the
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:35.840]  trans-specific partnership or a global carbon tax the global elite don't see you
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:40.760]  as a stakeholder they want to turn us all into serfs and treat us like cattle
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:44.800]  just remember this mr. Potter that this rabble you're talking about they do
[02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:48.800]  most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community well is
[02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:51.600]  it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent
[02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:57.120]  rooms in a bath anyway my father didn't think so people were human beings to him
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:46:02.240]  but to you a warped frustrated old man their cattle well in my book he died a
[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:06.000]  much richer man than you'll ever be I'm not interested in your book I'm talking
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:10.040]  about the building and loan I know very well what you're talking about you're
[02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:13.560]  talking about something you can't get your fingers on speaking of riches do
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:17.760]  you find the salary amounts amusing when Potter tries to buy George off look
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:31.480]  at your side young man 27 28 married make me say 40 a week 45 45 45 George I'll
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:36.800]  start you out at $20,000 a year
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:46.280]  $20,000 a year but you wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town buying
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:51.120]  your wife a lot of fine clothes a couple of business trips to New York a year
[02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:54.800]  maybe once in a while Europe you wouldn't mind that what you don't
[02:46:54.800 --> 02:47:00.200]  would I even if George had saved a lot of his $20,000 salary would it have
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:04.560]  bought much a couple of decades later by even the government's very conservative
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:10.280]  estimate of inflation the dollar has lost 90% of its value since 1947 when the
[02:47:10.280 --> 02:47:14.400]  movie was made the feds deliberate inflation is devastating to anyone trying
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:18.920]  to accumulate wealth through hard work and saving so what is the answer to all
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:22.320]  the George Bailey's out there a hundred years after the government gave control
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:26.640]  of our money supply to private bankers like Potter well Potter had more money
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:31.680]  than he could spend but would any of you want to be Potter you sit around here
[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:34.560]  and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:39.040]  you and your money well it doesn't mr. Potter in the in the whole vast
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:43.560]  configuration of things I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider George
[02:47:43.560 --> 02:47:47.480]  Bailey finally sees how rich his own life is as he sees the fruits of
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:51.720]  relationship honesty and compassion
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:48:00.880]  happy new year to you in jail going home they're waiting for you and if the
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:04.400]  public can awaken to the lies of the Federal Reserve if it could even be
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:11.080]  audited it would be a huge step to breaking the chains that enslave all
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:16.400]  us but ultimately it is God that changes minds and changes hearts God hates
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:21.200]  oppression and we can and should confidently pray that he will stop it I
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:29.520]  owe everything to George Bailey help him dear father Joseph Jesus and Mary
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:37.600]  help my friend mr. Bailey help my son George tonight he never thinks about
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:43.440]  himself God that's why he's in trouble George is a good guy give him a break
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:50.920]  God I love him dear Lord watch over him tonight please God something's the matter
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:55.240]  with daddy please spend a day there
[02:48:55.240 --> 02:49:14.880]  I'm not a praying man if you're up there and you can hear me
[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:21.600]  the info wars nightly news I'm David Knight of course that was a report that
[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:25.680]  they took down multiple times as a point out with Alex Jones I took those clips
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:30.640]  on YouTube that we used under fair use with commentary I took those clips from
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:35.600]  the entire movie that at the time had been up for I think it was three years
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:40.760]  had over 800,000 views and it was up on YouTube yet they continually would take
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:43.760]  that down we'd ask other people to repost it because it became an issue we
[02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:46.320]  wrote articles about it at the time other people would repost that they would
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:50.040]  take it down you can see it now after and they continue to do that for about
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:54.520]  seven months until we got into the summer and then they took the restriction
[02:49:54.520 --> 02:50:01.200]  off of my my channel so I posted it again and you can see that on info wars
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:05.160]  news HD that's where it's living right now because we don't want to get another
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:08.800]  hit on that but what it does that is so dangerous to them why do they want to
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:12.720]  suppress that information why would they take down a small fair use commentary
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:18.000]  because it exposes the poverty of those who are so greedy like mr. Potter those
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:22.960]  who control the Federal Reserve those who have written this secret trade
[02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:27.000]  agreement that we still don't know exactly what's in it those who seek to
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:32.640]  turn all of us into slaves or only they are stakeholders those who create the
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:38.080]  booms and the busts just as we saw with mr. Potter that's what it exposes
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:41.400]  that's what you need to understand that's what we need to fight against stay
[02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:45.000]  with us we come back we've got a couple of Christmas stories that involve

[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:43.200]  talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership just as we played that report
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:47.560]  about how the globalist elite want to turn us all into slaves to control us
[02:55:47.560 --> 02:55:51.960]  I think it's interesting to look at this story it was up on Drudge Mary Christmas
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:58.200]  Brunei it was from the Washington Times talking about one of our Muslim allies
[02:55:58.200 --> 02:56:03.160]  this is the Sultan of Brunei of course we seem to have an administration and it's
[02:56:03.160 --> 02:56:07.120]  not just the Obama administration they've been really bad about this Obama and
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:12.280]  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton but of course it went back to George W. Bush
[02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:17.480]  as well they love to support these dictators and they love to create wars
[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:21.560]  in areas where Christians and Muslims have coexisted for centuries to the
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:25.680]  extent that now in these areas that we have invaded that we've had these failed
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:31.200]  interventions now you basically don't have any Christians there anymore but
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:34.360]  let's take a look at what's going on in Brunei of course the Sultan of Brunei
[02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:38.720]  who's a dictator he has now threatened Muslims with five years in prison if
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:42.080]  they celebrate Christmas how's that for war and Christmas Christians are told
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:46.600]  that their celebrations must remain secret or they will be jailed as well
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:52.280]  because last year Brunei implemented Sharia law offenses such as conversion to
[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:55.320]  another religion from Islam are now punishable by religious courts next
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:59.960]  year Brunei will introduce Islamic punishments of whipping and amputation
[02:56:59.960 --> 02:57:05.040]  for some offenses finally Brunei will join Afghanistan Iran and Saudi Arabia
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:10.360]  all our allies okay as nations that stone people to death for adultery or
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:14.720]  for insulting Muhammad or the Quran and they point out that if you want to
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:20.040]  insult Brunei well good luck because first of all you're not going to know
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:23.840]  what products are coming from Brunei if we buy anything from them because of
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:27.720]  the requirements of the Trans-Pacific Partnership if it gets pushed through the
[02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:32.720]  Obama administration has included this brutal dictatorship under Sharia law
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:36.720]  under this Sultan they've included them in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and as
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:39.960]  they point out in the Washington Times under the TPP it's even arguable that
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:44.480]  citizen boycotts of the products of a certain nation could open the individuals
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:50.320]  up to litigation okay and they point out Donald Trump to said that this is the
[02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:54.960]  Obama regime has negotiated a lousy deal look it's not a deal okay it's not about
[02:57:54.960 --> 02:57:59.880]  free trade this is a betrayal of sovereign of sovereign nation of our
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:03.360]  sovereignty it's a betrayal of individual liberty on a number of different
[02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:08.800]  issues on the freedom of the internet it is not fundamentally even a bad trade
[02:58:08.800 --> 02:58:12.800]  deal because it's not fundamentally about trade on the other hand on the
[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:16.640]  other hand we have some Muslims just two days ago who shielded Christians on a
[02:58:16.640 --> 02:58:20.240]  Kenyan bus as they were being attacked by al-Shabaab terrorists this is on Monday
[02:58:20.240 --> 02:58:25.040]  the Muslim passengers refused to identify the Christians even gave them
[02:58:25.040 --> 02:58:29.480]  covering and other Islamic things to protect them said if you want to kill
[02:58:29.480 --> 02:58:33.600]  us then kill us there's no Christians here that's what we can do if we get rid
[02:58:33.600 --> 02:58:37.840]  of these dictators and that's coming from the globalists and from our
[02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:41.560]  administration stay with us Rob do will be right back

[03:00:19.280 --> 03:00:25.160]  of the info war welcome back I'm David and I'm gonna do one more segment here
[03:00:25.160 --> 03:00:28.840]  because I didn't quite get finished with what I wanted to say I wanted to finish
[03:00:28.840 --> 03:00:32.360]  what I was talking about with this particular terrorist attack just as we
[03:00:32.360 --> 03:00:38.240]  point out there are horrible regimes like Saudi Arabia like Brunei that we are
[03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:43.760]  so closely tied to that we support we have overthrown other countries where
[03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:47.880]  there wasn't war people places like Libya as as Hillary Clinton was involved
[03:00:47.880 --> 03:00:54.800]  in Benghazi turning it into a radical jihadist wonderland creating total
[03:00:54.800 --> 03:00:59.400]  chaos that's the legacy of our American foreign policy a legacy where we have
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:04.480]  destroyed Christians and Muslims getting together being able to live
[03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:07.480]  together at some level of tolerance yes I know it's not the same kind of
[03:01:07.480 --> 03:01:10.960]  tolerance that we see here in America but there were Christian churches in
[03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:15.840]  these countries before our foreign policy now there are none it is a
[03:01:15.840 --> 03:01:20.160]  deliberate foreign policy by our government to create this kind of
[03:01:20.160 --> 03:01:24.440]  persecution to put people like the Sultan of Brunei back them up so that they
[03:01:24.440 --> 03:01:28.320]  can enact their Islamic dictatorships but at the lower level just as we're
[03:01:28.320 --> 03:01:33.400]  talking about with the it's a wonderful lie at the lower level person to person
[03:01:33.400 --> 03:01:39.120]  many people will do the right thing if we can get rid of this overarching
[03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:43.200]  control by the people at the top I want to play for you a one-minute report here
[03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:47.520]  from CNN talking about this particular terrorist attack how the Muslims
[03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:53.720]  shielded Christians there in Kenya there in two groups one group with one
[03:01:53.720 --> 03:02:00.040]  other group so I immediately see people running to the road to stop us and they
[03:02:00.040 --> 03:02:09.080]  told us to get those Muslims to come out go go back to class go back to
[03:02:09.080 --> 03:02:15.360]  bus a man on the bus told CNN there were 12 Christians on board the gunman
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:20.800]  wanted to identify them and execute them he says Muslim passengers helped hide
[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:25.560]  some of them on the bus and they gave the Christian woman head scarves before
[03:02:25.560 --> 03:02:29.920]  the gunman made them line up on the road they stood strong said the witness
[03:02:29.920 --> 03:02:34.680]  telling the gunman quote if you want to kill us then kill us there are no
[03:02:34.680 --> 03:02:41.720]  Christians here al-Shabaab then fled we are all Kenyans we are not separated by
[03:02:41.720 --> 03:02:47.520]  religion everybody can profess is one religion but we see we are one country
[03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:54.000]  we are one people that was a very good message see at the lower level not the
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:58.360]  people atop not the people like Obama or Hillary Clinton or George HW Bush but at
[03:02:58.360 --> 03:03:03.200]  the lower level we can stand up against this insane violence so what they said
[03:03:03.200 --> 03:03:06.960]  they as you heard in the report they gave them some clothing to help them hide
[03:03:06.960 --> 03:03:10.160]  from these terrorists they said if you want to kill us then kill us there are
[03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:13.600]  no Christians here and actually they did kill two people three others were
[03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:18.640]  injured but they could have killed more than a dozen Christians that's how we
[03:03:18.640 --> 03:03:23.160]  can transcend this we need to transcend this we need to stand together against
[03:03:23.160 --> 03:03:26.880]  this kind of political oppression and just real briefly we see as people are
[03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:30.880]  pushing a back against the idea that we need to vet people coming to this
[03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:35.320]  country from areas that are at war with the United States areas where we are
[03:03:35.320 --> 03:03:39.280]  running these Islamic jihadists and will probably bring them in that's what
[03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:43.800]  really scares me about this I know that our government has created and funded
[03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:48.880]  ISIS and the Mujahideen all these Islamic surrogates that they have done
[03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:53.080]  using them to try to overthrow Russia 63 years ago using them again in
[03:03:53.080 --> 03:03:57.280]  Afghanistan using them in Libya using them in Syria they're going to bring
[03:03:57.280 --> 03:04:00.880]  them here folks and that's what Donald Trump was talking about when he said
[03:04:00.880 --> 03:04:03.840]  we need a temporary ban on this Rand Paul had done the same thing he had
[03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:08.440]  introduced a bill there was no support for that bill in the Senate what does
[03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:12.400]  that tell you it's a bipartisan move it's not just Obama that's trying to do
[03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:15.280]  this and so we've got a polling organization coming out of Raleigh
[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:19.320]  North Carolina I would call them really more of a trolling organization they do
[03:04:19.320 --> 03:04:23.840]  all these different polls that are pushing people towards a democratic
[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:28.160]  position they had a poll earlier this week they asked Republican and Democrat
[03:04:28.160 --> 03:04:32.760]  voters if they would agree to bomb Agrabah now of course that is a fictional
[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:36.320]  city from Aladdin and then they talk about oh yeah well this many Republicans
[03:04:36.320 --> 03:04:41.320]  would do it this many Democrats would do it look they're simply trying to do a
[03:04:41.320 --> 03:04:45.560]  push-pull to tell people that we should not be concerned about what our
[03:04:45.560 --> 03:04:50.720]  government is doing to undermine not only Syria but America stay with us when
[03:04:50.720 --> 03:04:55.440]  we come back Rob do Joe Biggs and guests will be talking about what's going on
[03:04:55.440 --> 03:05:00.080]  there and what's going on with the TSA
[03:05:05.720 --> 03:05:11.120]  the best-selling single of all time in excess of a hundred million copies sold
[03:05:11.120 --> 03:05:16.520]  worldwide but our college kids raised in a narrative of white privilege and
[03:05:16.520 --> 03:05:21.000]  microaggression I think it's an offense to people of color it's insulting to
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:24.920]  people of color perpetuates the idea that white is naturally good and that
[03:05:24.920 --> 03:05:29.320]  other colors are bad and we feel that that's a that's a microaggression here's
[03:05:29.320 --> 03:05:36.720]  a clue boys and girls it's about snow the government educational establishment
[03:05:36.720 --> 03:05:40.840]  is destroying any connection to existing culture so that they can create a
[03:05:40.840 --> 03:05:46.240]  new political culture one of censorship and intolerance done in the name of
[03:05:46.240 --> 03:05:51.160]  tolerance fight back give the gift of knowledge send your friends to info
[03:05:51.160 --> 03:05:57.560]  wars the cure for political correctness and tell them Merry Christmas
[03:06:01.160 --> 03:06:05.920]  and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop
[03:06:05.920 --> 03:06:10.480]  a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[03:06:10.480 --> 03:06:14.920]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music

[03:06:24.200 --> 03:06:27.800]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[03:06:27.800 --> 03:06:32.040]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with
[03:06:32.040 --> 03:06:35.120]  the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take
[03:06:35.120 --> 03:06:38.640]  we worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are
[03:06:38.640 --> 03:06:42.400]  safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula

[03:08:23.320 --> 03:08:26.960]  this is the fourth hour of overdrive and sitting next to me over here is Joe
[03:08:26.960 --> 03:08:33.000]  Biggs former staff sergeant in the army and he's got some interesting war
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:36.760]  memorabilia he's gonna show you guys that someone sent to him and also we're
[03:08:36.760 --> 03:08:41.520]  gonna talk about some Trump news last night we we did a video actually I
[03:08:41.520 --> 03:08:46.800]  shot it and Biggs was the I guess the reporter on that video talking about how
[03:08:46.800 --> 03:08:52.040]  a co-chair from Illinois of the Republican one of K6 minions went out
[03:08:52.040 --> 03:08:55.520]  and said that you know the only way to take out Trump is with a headshot which
[03:08:55.520 --> 03:08:59.080]  sounds like an assassination attempt to me I don't care how you spend it when I
[03:08:59.080 --> 03:09:04.040]  think of headshot and talking about a president I think about JFK and this is
[03:09:04.040 --> 03:09:06.800]  the thing though when you actually go listen to the audio it's not that bad
[03:09:06.800 --> 03:09:10.560]  but here's the thing see hypocrisy yeah if you or I were to say something like
[03:09:10.560 --> 03:09:13.400]  that and we were to tweet it out or be on a radio show like what do you think
[03:09:13.400 --> 03:09:16.200]  about Hillary Clinton yeah well the only to take that woman out you know is with
[03:09:16.200 --> 03:09:20.360]  a headshot right minutes you're gonna have stormtroopers coming in secret
[03:09:20.360 --> 03:09:24.840]  service cops FBI everyone coming in doing background checks they're gonna
[03:09:24.840 --> 03:09:28.880]  oh this guy had PTSD oh he has guns let's take it all the ways throw him away
[03:09:28.880 --> 03:09:32.280]  and lock the key you know that's what happens that's ridiculous but this guy's
[03:09:32.280 --> 03:09:35.360]  gonna go out there and you haven't heard anything about it today I haven't seen
[03:09:35.360 --> 03:09:38.840]  John Kasich issue an apology haven't seen anything about that nothing Trump's
[03:09:38.840 --> 03:09:42.520]  campaign said hey we want an apology from Kasich that is ridiculous that your
[03:09:42.520 --> 03:09:46.280]  guy is gonna go out there Kasich is literally the barbed wire man he jumps
[03:09:46.280 --> 03:09:50.600]  on the barbed wire for everybody else to run over top of him to attack David
[03:09:50.600 --> 03:09:54.360]  Knight said it back in one of the debate shows because that's exactly what he is
[03:09:54.360 --> 03:09:58.280]  he's just a total hit man for you know the Republican Party to try and take out
[03:09:58.280 --> 03:10:02.720]  Trump and you know and I'm not even one way or another against Trump there's
[03:10:02.720 --> 03:10:04.960]  some things that he says that I don't like there's a lot of things he says
[03:10:04.960 --> 03:10:08.720]  that I do like but I you know he gets demonized for saying the word schlong
[03:10:08.720 --> 03:10:14.000]  and they talk about it endlessly on TV with the talking heads yet somebody
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:17.360]  says you know the only way to take him out with a headshot but if someone said
[03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:21.440]  that about Hillary Clinton right all over the me all over oh poor Hillary oh
[03:10:21.440 --> 03:10:26.040]  she would love news like that and the reason also I brought you in here
[03:10:26.040 --> 03:10:29.880]  there's an article from the American Mirror it came out yesterday video
[03:10:29.880 --> 03:10:35.680]  women defy media narrative love Trump at packed Michigan rally and I guess one
[03:10:35.680 --> 03:10:39.440]  of the thumb that the thumbnail the video is a young lady wearing one of our
[03:10:39.440 --> 03:10:44.040]  own Hillary for plit prison t-shirts there there is right there and her name
[03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:49.660]  is Linda Lechage Lechage is that how you say it I believe I'm calling her
[03:10:49.660 --> 03:10:53.020]  Trump girl down Trump girl yeah so we're gonna have her on in a little bit to
[03:10:53.020 --> 03:10:58.880]  talk about why she did this but just you know and she did it because her uncle I
[03:10:58.880 --> 03:11:03.440]  guess is a fan of info wars and you know bought her a shirt and so she decided
[03:11:03.440 --> 03:11:07.160]  to get active get off the couch and go do something and then she's interviewed
[03:11:07.160 --> 03:11:09.960]  by the media she gets to put out the idea about the left-right paradigm I
[03:11:09.960 --> 03:11:12.960]  mean all kind of stuff just happens just by wearing a shirt to an event it's an
[03:11:12.960 --> 03:11:15.680]  amazing shirt I mean that's why I always encourage people to go and pick one up
[03:11:15.680 --> 03:11:21.800]  because you know when I wore it on the shirt there it is right there you know I
[03:11:21.800 --> 03:11:25.520]  wore it back to the Trump rally had an ovation about like 10,000 people
[03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:28.920]  everyone to take pictures you know getting a conversation debate over it
[03:11:28.920 --> 03:11:32.080]  whether I liked it or not everybody there obviously liked it outdoors not so
[03:11:32.080 --> 03:11:36.200]  much the one with the Hillary Clinton rally and then I wore it there amongst
[03:11:36.200 --> 03:11:39.320]  the wolves yeah you know and there was a lot of supporters on the outside of
[03:11:39.320 --> 03:11:42.280]  the fence that were there so I mean it's a great shirt to stir up debate talk
[03:11:42.280 --> 03:11:46.400]  about issues and it's really awesome to see the people smile when they see it
[03:11:46.400 --> 03:11:50.320]  because you can tell who's not a lifeless soul walking around like some
[03:11:50.320 --> 03:11:54.040]  zombie that's just really ready to vote for Hillary totally totally agree we're
[03:11:54.040 --> 03:11:57.840]  gonna get into some TSA news as well coming up and also I want to take your

[03:13:01.280 --> 03:13:04.320]  first chance you could get in I remember I think I was 18 when I was able to vote
[03:13:04.320 --> 03:13:09.600]  the first time and that was a Clinton election it's how old I am but anyway

[03:13:19.760 --> 03:13:26.200]  silent eye at the end of the J Lechai so yeah Linda tell us why you decided to
[03:13:26.200 --> 03:13:30.600]  wear the Hillary for put prison shirt to that Trump rally and talk about you know
[03:13:30.600 --> 03:13:33.000]  I know you got interviewed by the media but what were other people coming up and
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:39.720]  saying to you well I decided to get the shirt when I was buying deep plans as a
[03:13:39.720 --> 03:13:44.280]  conversation starter and I've worn it a lot of places I've worn it around campus
[03:13:44.280 --> 03:13:50.800]  and I decided to wear it to the Trump rally because I know people there are
[03:13:50.800 --> 03:13:55.000]  awake and I wanted it as a conversation starter you know when I wore it around
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:14:01.000]  campus a lot of people just laughed it off and until I started talking to them
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:05.320]  about it and about why Hillary should be in prison about the
[03:14:05.320 --> 03:14:12.360]  big guys he scandal and about her emails in the video and it really amazes me how
[03:14:12.360 --> 03:14:18.280]  not awake the general public is well they're too busy about issues of no
[03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:23.240]  significance you know they're concerned about Star Wars or what's what was his
[03:14:23.240 --> 03:14:28.960]  name or whether we could say white Christmas or not I mean long Donald
[03:14:28.960 --> 03:14:34.840]  Trump I think it's the political correctness wave that's going on that
[03:14:34.840 --> 03:14:40.000]  people are scared to take a stand yeah so they'd rather be sheep and not say
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:47.840]  anything and not be involved and people look both ways before they talk so they're
[03:14:47.840 --> 03:14:52.840]  scared of someone what do students say to you around college campus because my
[03:14:52.840 --> 03:14:57.880]  my experience at college campuses here in Texas like at UT they're super
[03:14:57.880 --> 03:15:02.080]  liberal they love Hillary Clinton they're ready for her like I'm ready for a
[03:15:02.080 --> 03:15:05.680]  brand-new gun for Christmas so what kind of a response is do you get there on
[03:15:05.680 --> 03:15:14.240]  campus I get a lot of laughs I get a lot of told that I'm racist and that I have
[03:15:14.240 --> 03:15:22.400]  it all wrong but I try to enlighten them and tell them are you involved are you
[03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:26.960]  really educated you watch the committees that are taking place trying to
[03:15:26.960 --> 03:15:31.560]  investigate in the Hillary Clinton Benghazi scandal and most of the time
[03:15:31.560 --> 03:15:36.880]  people say that they don't believe it and they think that it's a Republican scam
[03:15:36.880 --> 03:15:41.680]  to try to bring her down yeah that's the way they always frame any time
[03:15:41.680 --> 03:15:44.800]  somebody has caught doing wrong Republican or Democrat they say oh it's
[03:15:44.800 --> 03:15:48.840]  just politics it's really not anything lying killing people it's all politics
[03:15:48.840 --> 03:15:52.240]  has nothing to do with you know real life and if we were to do the things that
[03:15:52.240 --> 03:15:55.360]  Hillary Clinton has done we would all be in prison exactly that's just that's
[03:15:55.360 --> 03:15:58.360]  just it you know and talk you know I guess you're going through this
[03:15:58.360 --> 03:16:01.860]  political correctness stuff being on campus when when I was in college in the
[03:16:01.860 --> 03:16:07.000]  90s it was there but not nearly as bad as it is now I mean it's off the hook now
[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:10.680]  and now we've had this story come out from Paul Joseph Watson coming to
[03:16:10.680 --> 03:16:14.960]  America China introduces credit score for obedient citizens and what's
[03:16:14.960 --> 03:16:18.720]  happening now at your colleges is what's gonna come to the rest of us it's
[03:16:18.720 --> 03:16:22.920]  gonna be a bunch of nittying whining people trendies running around telling
[03:16:22.920 --> 03:16:26.320]  you what you can say and what you can say it's a citizen report card it's no
[03:16:26.320 --> 03:16:30.480]  longer a record card for your education but it's your permanent record report
[03:16:30.480 --> 03:16:35.840]  card about how you act Linda are what kind of stuff are they doing just in
[03:16:35.840 --> 03:16:38.760]  general not necessarily to you but like at your school have they banned the word
[03:16:38.760 --> 03:16:43.160]  Christmas have they banned Christmas decorations have they banned certain
[03:16:43.160 --> 03:16:48.520]  sayings what what are they doing at your school not necessarily I don't really see
[03:16:48.520 --> 03:16:55.280]  much of that I just see the students more so being quiet the students not
[03:16:55.280 --> 03:17:01.760]  wanting to engage in talking about the news more people like to talk about the
[03:17:01.760 --> 03:17:09.360]  latest trends or what's gonna happen on e-news a lot of people aren't involved
[03:17:09.360 --> 03:17:14.520]  in knowing what is happening in the government nor do they want to be that's
[03:17:14.520 --> 03:17:18.440]  why but I was actually very surprised because once that when I went to the
[03:17:18.440 --> 03:17:22.440]  Trump rally we drove about three hours to go there there was a lot of young
[03:17:22.440 --> 03:17:27.360]  people there so I was very pleased about that yeah you know I found especially
[03:17:27.360 --> 03:17:30.400]  with the internet people who really want to get informed and who aren't just
[03:17:30.400 --> 03:17:35.240]  interested in the basic American culture you know that pop culture out there are
[03:17:35.240 --> 03:17:39.640]  able to get the information get informed and get active because I gotta say the
[03:17:39.640 --> 03:17:41.960]  tools that are out there with the internet now you can really reach a lot
[03:17:41.960 --> 03:17:45.320]  more people than you could with just you know standing at a street corner well
[03:17:45.320 --> 03:17:49.680]  I don't get is how people are so you know into the pop culture stuff though
[03:17:49.680 --> 03:17:52.960]  because of the drama guess what get into politics there's a lot of drama there's
[03:17:52.960 --> 03:17:57.160]  a lot of stuff going on there's a lot of backstabbing it is better than reality
[03:17:57.160 --> 03:18:01.760]  TV it is reality it is happening and it affects your future and everyone else's
[03:18:01.760 --> 03:18:05.520]  so I just understand why people more people aren't really into the politics
[03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:09.600]  why they aren't you know just diving in and trying to find out about what's
[03:18:09.600 --> 03:18:13.040]  going on because it's better than today I mean who cares what Kanye West or
[03:18:13.040 --> 03:18:16.840]  Kim Kardashian do that's ridiculous exactly and you know I'll go ahead go
[03:18:16.840 --> 03:18:22.880]  ahead Linda I really think that people on take for granted what America is right
[03:18:22.880 --> 03:18:27.360]  now having their free speech they don't really realize that it could all be
[03:18:27.360 --> 03:18:33.480]  changed in a matter of months years and I think people really need to wake up and
[03:18:33.480 --> 03:18:38.880]  realize that this is a very important election that America the government has
[03:18:38.880 --> 03:18:43.680]  been totally corrupt Washington is totally corrupt I think that people
[03:18:43.680 --> 03:18:49.080]  don't realize that this all can change that pop culture won't matter soon enough
[03:18:49.080 --> 03:18:54.120]  and what exactly what you said what Kanye West is where and Kim Kardashian is
[03:18:54.120 --> 03:18:59.120]  wearing that's why the youth needs to wake up and everyone the general public
[03:18:59.120 --> 03:19:05.360]  needs to wake up and really get informed and vote because this election is one
[03:19:05.360 --> 03:19:08.800]  that's really going to determine the fate of America do you share the show
[03:19:08.800 --> 03:19:11.360]  often you're are you able to get the show out to other people and help them

[03:24:16.640 --> 03:24:21.600]  Rob do joining me is Joe Biggs and we were just talking to Linda Lashay she's
[03:24:21.600 --> 03:24:26.160]  a 20-year-old engineering student at Michigan State University I want to say
[03:24:26.160 --> 03:24:29.640]  Michigan because that's the big rivalry is Michigan Michigan the only thing I
[03:24:29.640 --> 03:24:32.240]  like about Michigan though Tom Brady came from there so that's awesome oh
[03:24:32.240 --> 03:24:37.680]  leave it that okay American more football propaganda you know the debates
[03:24:37.680 --> 03:24:42.280]  actually did better than the NFL this last debate that had drew more people
[03:24:42.280 --> 03:24:45.520]  than the NFL that's good that's a good sign people are at least getting into
[03:24:45.520 --> 03:24:50.680]  this and just like our guest you know 20 years old got some deep cleanse
[03:24:50.680 --> 03:24:54.160]  bought a hillary for prison shirts started wearing it around wore to a
[03:24:54.160 --> 03:24:58.800]  Trump rally ends up you know on on video talking about right paradigm starts
[03:24:58.800 --> 03:25:02.280]  with a cleanse and then all the sudden she's yeah breaking out and all this
[03:25:02.280 --> 03:25:05.440]  it's awesome so Linda are you doing anything else on campus to get people
[03:25:05.440 --> 03:25:09.880]  active are you gonna start a group or what's what's your future plans I would
[03:25:09.880 --> 03:25:14.960]  love to do that I'm really trying to start word of mouth my friends Michael's
[03:25:14.960 --> 03:25:19.560]  friends to get them involved but I would love to start something to make it
[03:25:19.560 --> 03:25:23.720]  broader to engage a lot of people on campus all right well do you want to give
[03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:27.720]  out a Twitter handle or anything like that to bring people to you and wherever
[03:25:27.720 --> 03:25:33.120]  you're doing your you know activism getting people active sure my Twitter
[03:25:33.120 --> 03:25:39.960]  name is Lynn and then to underscores L all right see guys see if y'all can pull
[03:25:39.960 --> 03:25:45.920]  that up Lynn to underscores L and yeah and do you have anything else you want
[03:25:45.920 --> 03:25:48.840]  to add young people out there who might be thinking about just sitting on the
[03:25:48.840 --> 03:25:52.800]  couch for the rest you know the rest of their college career and phoning it in
[03:25:52.800 --> 03:25:57.080]  as I should say right three I just want to say that the reason I like Trump is
[03:25:57.080 --> 03:26:02.280]  because I think that he's saying a lot of what the people that are actually
[03:26:02.280 --> 03:26:06.800]  involved in knowing what their government is doing and are informed
[03:26:06.800 --> 03:26:11.080]  about the correctness I feel like he's actually saying it out loud and telling
[03:26:11.080 --> 03:26:14.760]  us like no other politician has told us he exposed the client he exposed
[03:26:14.760 --> 03:26:22.200]  exposed the bushes um I think that young people and older people like that
[03:26:22.200 --> 03:26:27.520]  aren't involved need to think about what they want for their children and what
[03:26:27.520 --> 03:26:32.600]  they want to do in life if you want to pay tax pay high taxes your whole life
[03:26:32.600 --> 03:26:38.640]  if you want to not own your own business if you want to not be your own boss one
[03:26:38.640 --> 03:26:44.320]  day or even make a great living you need to really educate yourself and think
[03:26:44.320 --> 03:26:48.160]  about who you want to vote for right do you want to be a slave or do you want to
[03:26:48.160 --> 03:26:51.280]  have freedom because right now we're going towards tyranny we're going
[03:26:51.280 --> 03:26:55.200]  towards a Chinese style sesame credit system where you're gonna have neighbors
[03:26:55.200 --> 03:26:58.520]  and peers spying on you telling you how to behave and you're gonna have higher
[03:26:58.520 --> 03:27:02.160]  taxes you're gonna have more regulations where you can't do as much without
[03:27:02.160 --> 03:27:05.640]  filling out some government form or getting a stamp for government approval
[03:27:05.640 --> 03:27:10.600]  that's the road we're going down and if we don't stop it you know five years from
[03:27:10.600 --> 03:27:12.960]  now we're gonna be just like China ten years from now we're gonna be worse than
[03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:18.560]  China you know it's just it's just a matter of time exactly yeah so well
[03:27:18.560 --> 03:27:21.960]  thanks for joining us Linda Hillary for prison Hillary for prison thanks for

[03:28:19.640 --> 03:28:23.000]  Calvary this is from when he was in Sicily and this is when he moved over
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:28.600]  into Patton's unit now while over there in combat he was able to you know take
[03:28:28.600 --> 03:28:32.120]  out some of these Nazi soldiers so this is from the uniform this is like a
[03:28:32.120 --> 03:28:37.320]  breastplate part right here on the front of the uniform the insignia and then you
[03:28:37.320 --> 03:28:40.720]  know I showed this to Alex earlier and he just flipped out over it said it's
[03:28:40.720 --> 03:28:44.120]  probably worth you know quite a few thousand dollars or whatever but this is
[03:28:44.120 --> 03:28:48.880]  an original Nazi belt worn by a soldier over there and he just you know sent me
[03:28:48.880 --> 03:28:51.960]  a story and said hey I wanted you to have something like this because I knew
[03:28:51.960 --> 03:28:56.720]  that you would appreciate it and you know that's definitely one of those wars
[03:28:56.720 --> 03:29:02.040]  that people fought you know hard hard for and I don't know too much German but
[03:29:02.040 --> 03:29:07.240]  I know mit means with God with us or something like God with us me that means yeah look at
[03:29:07.240 --> 03:29:12.640]  that so the Nazis thought they had got on their side back in the day trying to
[03:29:12.640 --> 03:29:16.560]  purify the world and and take it over with the help of the British government
[03:29:16.560 --> 03:29:22.040]  yeah by the way so when we come back we're gonna take your phone calls we're
[03:29:22.040 --> 03:29:26.040]  gonna get into some TSA news and now they're gonna they're gonna ban opt out
[03:29:26.040 --> 03:29:30.120]  so I think it might be time to look at starting a new opt-out protest because
[03:29:30.120 --> 03:29:35.080]  it's time once again to tell the TSA that you're not going to to look at our
[03:29:35.080 --> 03:29:38.520]  bodies and share images and do all this other nonsense that you want to do in
[03:29:38.520 --> 03:29:41.320]  the name of fake security we'll be right back it's the fourth hour of overdrive
[03:29:41.320 --> 03:29:46.960]  I'm your host Rob do thanks for watching and listening info wars.com
[03:29:46.960 --> 03:29:53.960]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[03:29:53.960 --> 03:30:03.120]  network GOP presidential hopeful Rand Paul has introduced legislation intended
[03:30:03.120 --> 03:30:06.800]  to block any effort by the incumbent president to enforce gun control by
[03:30:06.800 --> 03:30:11.640]  executive action Paul's legislation named the separation of powers restoration
[03:30:11.640 --> 03:30:15.200]  and Second Amendment Protection Act would render any action on gun
[03:30:15.200 --> 03:30:19.800]  legislation by the president which circumvents Congress as advisory only in
[03:30:19.800 --> 03:30:24.320]  nature Paul's bill would apply to any executive action on gun control that
[03:30:24.320 --> 03:30:28.200]  either infringes upon congressional authority or potentially violates the
[03:30:28.200 --> 03:30:32.280]  Second Amendment the bill then mandates that once an executive action has been
[03:30:32.280 --> 03:30:36.760]  classified as advisory only it would require Congress to pass it in order
[03:30:36.760 --> 03:30:40.800]  for it to take effect the bill also outlines that it is within their power
[03:30:40.800 --> 03:30:45.160]  for a state official member of Congress or a person affected by an executive
[03:30:45.160 --> 03:30:49.520]  action on gun control to launch a civil lawsuit the legislation will be fast
[03:30:49.520 --> 03:30:53.000]  tracked through the Senate and is expected to be made priority after the
[03:30:53.000 --> 03:30:58.120]  Christmas recess you can find more reports on info wars.com

[03:33:43.800 --> 03:33:48.600]  patches from Patton's what what is the correct term Patton's and Sherman
[03:33:48.600 --> 03:33:51.920]  Sherman tank seventh Calvary seven carries that a battalion what is that

[03:34:03.280 --> 03:34:07.840]  a video a little bit later I think I'm gonna play part of Watson's piece
[03:34:07.840 --> 03:34:14.960]  talking about the new book that who's that guy that wrote it now and his name
[03:34:14.960 --> 03:34:19.280]  just blanked on me Seymour Hirsch Seymour Hirsch has a new book it's been
[03:34:19.280 --> 03:34:24.760]  reviewed it's all about how Obama basically has been funding ISIS from the
[03:34:24.760 --> 03:34:28.320]  beginning all these guys knew this I mean Bush knew that there was gonna be
[03:34:28.320 --> 03:34:31.720]  turmoil if they went in and broke up Iraq that's why they did it so they could
[03:34:31.720 --> 03:34:35.440]  create a breeding ground but then Obama took it a step further went in
[03:34:35.440 --> 03:34:39.640]  destroyed Libya destroyed Egypt started trying to destroy Syria tried to
[03:34:39.640 --> 03:34:42.340]  declare war on Syria and basically the American people stood up and said no
[03:34:42.340 --> 03:34:45.960]  we're not gonna do it the military has stood up and so I think we're gonna play
[03:34:45.960 --> 03:34:50.600]  Watson's report and I think we're gonna put all these all in one post stunner
[03:34:50.600 --> 03:34:54.440]  Pentagon in secret revolt against Obama so we'll play that and we'll play part of

[03:37:45.360 --> 03:37:48.200]  them reaching their pocket and they pull out like their supermail vitality or
[03:37:48.200 --> 03:37:52.000]  their survival shield or the X2 you know the nace and iodine whatever all the

[03:37:58.560 --> 03:38:01.360]  you're putting out we want to let you know that we're supporting that and it's
[03:38:01.360 --> 03:38:06.400]  not just supporting us it's good stuff I use the nace and iodine just about
[03:38:06.400 --> 03:38:10.040]  every day silver is good too the silver is amazing and I use it in a variety
[03:38:10.040 --> 03:38:12.760]  of different applications I'm a big proponent of silver been using it for
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:18.760]  over 12 years now and I mean it's I think I've been in since I've been
[03:38:18.760 --> 03:38:22.000]  using silver I've probably been to the doctor two or three times everybody
[03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:25.080]  ran to when I was on that surf and trip in Hawaii everyone had the silver yeah
[03:38:25.080 --> 03:38:28.560]  they were drinking with tea they're drinking with stuff in the morning it
[03:38:28.560 --> 03:38:32.000]  clears you out whatever you need so let's go let's go to some calls first
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:34.960]  let's go to I guess Chris in New York is our first caller he wants to talk about
[03:38:34.960 --> 03:38:39.320]  that China credit system his sesame credits sesame open sesame so Chris
[03:38:39.320 --> 03:38:48.120]  what's going on yeah I saw that news about China firewall great firewall and
[03:38:48.120 --> 03:38:55.680]  the use of some type of credit incentive or maybe penalizing you for your
[03:38:55.680 --> 03:39:01.520]  defense it seems to me like it's the same tax that ISIS is engaging on
[03:39:01.520 --> 03:39:09.360]  Christians in the Middle East and also pretty much to end any political
[03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:14.680]  dissent and anything that has to do with the libertarian or the national
[03:39:14.680 --> 03:39:22.360]  nationality because any expression of nationalities consider hate speech now
[03:39:22.360 --> 03:39:27.760]  you have to identify with religion or with race because the big new Brzezinski
[03:39:27.760 --> 03:39:32.640]  says the nationality is no longer a viable option and this is the same type
[03:39:32.640 --> 03:39:37.960]  of propaganda that is being taken to Europe United States of course and the
[03:39:37.960 --> 03:39:43.080]  United States with George Soros and the Clinton administration and the
[03:39:43.080 --> 03:39:47.880]  Obama administration rather are taking it to the Dominican Republic with the
[03:39:47.880 --> 03:39:51.760]  demographic bomb of undocumented Haitians yeah and that is the goal of
[03:39:51.760 --> 03:39:55.160]  the globalist is to wipe out nation barriers so they can create a one world
[03:39:55.160 --> 03:39:58.680]  government where there are no nation states there is no sovereignty there's
[03:39:58.680 --> 03:40:02.720]  one body of unelected officials who's making laws and rules for everybody and
[03:40:02.720 --> 03:40:06.240]  if you don't well at first it's going to be a nice little system like the
[03:40:06.240 --> 03:40:09.560]  sesame credit system where they just keep tabs on you and they let you know
[03:40:09.560 --> 03:40:12.480]  that they're watching you and that you said something bad today you better
[03:40:12.480 --> 03:40:16.840]  change your ways and you know you go to places where ISIS is in control and
[03:40:16.840 --> 03:40:20.200]  they're you know cutting your head off so that's where it's going to lead to
[03:40:20.200 --> 03:40:25.320]  eventually you know regimes like Saudi Arabia Chris you got any final comments go
[03:40:25.320 --> 03:40:30.400]  ahead yeah they're cutting your head off in the commercial way which is for your
[03:40:30.400 --> 03:40:34.360]  credit without credit you have nothing right now they're creating refugees all
[03:40:34.360 --> 03:40:40.760]  over the world where some of these people don't even apply to for that refugee
[03:40:40.760 --> 03:40:46.360]  state mm-hmm yeah it's a virtual decapitation you're exactly right but
[03:40:46.360 --> 03:40:49.800]  what you're gonna see is you're gonna see people in China who are inventive and
[03:40:49.800 --> 03:40:52.960]  resourceful just like they are in the United States work around this system
[03:40:52.960 --> 03:40:56.240]  you know they're gonna create they're gonna figure out how to game the system
[03:40:56.240 --> 03:40:59.800]  because that's what humans do when they see a system and how it's it's being
[03:40:59.800 --> 03:41:04.280]  skewed one way they'll figure out a way to game it and so I you know I'm I don't
[03:41:04.280 --> 03:41:07.480]  take any stock in this I mean I take stock that they're trying to do this but
[03:41:07.480 --> 03:41:10.760]  like that it's gonna be successful in the end it's gonna fall in itself because
[03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:14.000]  only if people willingly get into something will you have something
[03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:16.920]  successful when you force people to get into something and force them into
[03:41:16.920 --> 03:41:20.600]  something it doesn't work it just doesn't work Luke in Washington what's on
[03:41:20.600 --> 03:41:22.720]  your mind

[03:42:12.040 --> 03:42:17.040]  thought criminal why thank you sir I appreciate it and you know that racist
[03:42:17.040 --> 03:42:20.200]  comment about Christmas right there that's uh yeah that's that's great are
[03:42:20.200 --> 03:42:26.360]  you are you wishing us a white Christmas by any chance I can't believe that they
[03:42:26.360 --> 03:42:31.000]  want to be like yeah we got a band this is white Christmas it just has to be
[03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:34.720]  Christmas and then Christmas is offensive so you can't say Christmas
[03:42:34.720 --> 03:42:39.080]  it'll just be moss happy moss and you know I'm talking about this pushback you
[03:42:39.080 --> 03:42:41.440]  know they're trying to take guns away from people in Germany sales of guns
[03:42:41.440 --> 03:42:46.080]  pepper spray surge across Germany as migrant crime rape wave explodes and
[03:42:46.080 --> 03:42:50.560]  oh people are defending themselves because their government is not helping
[03:42:50.560 --> 03:42:53.160]  them but yeah they're they're they're they're a part of the problem they're
[03:42:53.160 --> 03:42:56.360]  creating a problem they're allowing the problem to happen you know when when I
[03:42:56.360 --> 03:42:58.480]  was in Paris you know I was sitting there listening to these guys he's
[03:42:58.480 --> 03:43:01.760]  Washington and their insiders they're saying yeah the reason this attack
[03:43:01.760 --> 03:43:05.240]  happened is simply and purely before because of the fact that the borders were
[03:43:05.240 --> 03:43:08.400]  wide open mm-hmm and then the fact that we're allowing these people to come in
[03:43:08.400 --> 03:43:11.640]  unchecked and vetted that's what allowed this to happen and then you've got
[03:43:11.640 --> 03:43:15.240]  these fake passports popping up but all this stuff going on they want it to
[03:43:15.240 --> 03:43:18.640]  happen and it seems like they're anti-gun but at the same time when you
[03:43:18.640 --> 03:43:21.640]  look at a lot of these people these politicians they've got money in these
[03:43:21.640 --> 03:43:24.960]  gun industries so by creating this fear they know they're also going to create
[03:43:24.960 --> 03:43:30.280]  another market which is an explosion of cells in these guns right you know gun
[03:43:30.280 --> 03:43:34.440]  cells are out of this roof right now commander-in-chief gun control executive
[03:43:34.440 --> 03:43:38.880]  orders expected within weeks and then we have on info wars calm firearms top
[03:43:38.880 --> 03:43:43.080]  American Christmas list like you said but the last seven months it's been like
[03:43:43.080 --> 03:43:47.560]  the largest spike in cells yep I mean it's it's ridiculous I mean seventh
[03:43:47.560 --> 03:43:51.200]  consecutive months to see record number of checks yeah black Friday they said
[03:43:51.200 --> 03:43:55.160]  the most guns I think sold in a long long time I don't know the exact date
[03:43:55.160 --> 03:43:58.480]  yeah we're sold on this black Friday that's when I got my Chris Vector that's
[03:43:58.480 --> 03:44:02.200]  when you know when I was in that store packed there were lines you had to take
[03:44:02.200 --> 03:44:05.640]  a number to wait to be able to come to the counter and approach someone about
[03:44:05.640 --> 03:44:09.480]  getting one it's because like you said they're creating this problem and now
[03:44:09.480 --> 03:44:13.040]  people are going hey why are you talking about gun control in the news no we
[03:44:13.040 --> 03:44:16.200]  don't need gun control I need the ability to protect myself because you guys
[03:44:16.200 --> 03:44:19.920]  aren't doing a damn thing about it we need border control and I want to go to
[03:44:19.920 --> 03:44:22.960]  this video about Paul Joseph Watson it's about three minutes long stunner
[03:44:22.960 --> 03:44:26.880]  Pentagon in secret revolt against Obama this is really what it's gonna take it's
[03:44:26.880 --> 03:44:30.480]  gonna take the boots on the ground to just say no we're not gonna do what you
[03:44:30.480 --> 03:44:33.160]  say we're not gonna fund these people we're not gonna give them weapons so
[03:44:33.160 --> 03:44:37.520]  let's go to that video remember in the summer of 2013 when the Obama
[03:44:37.520 --> 03:44:41.760]  administration was on the verge of attacking Syria and toppling President
[03:44:41.760 --> 03:44:46.600]  Bashar al-Assad Twitter was flooded with images of US service members expressing
[03:44:46.600 --> 03:44:52.320]  their staunch opposition to being forced to act as al Qaeda's Air Force reports at
[03:44:52.320 --> 03:44:56.560]  the time also confirmed that US military officials were dead against air strikes
[03:44:56.560 --> 03:45:01.240]  now an explosive investigation by Seymour Hirsch has confirmed that the
[03:45:01.240 --> 03:45:07.040]  Pentagon was engaged in a secret revolt against the Obama White House a highly
[03:45:07.040 --> 03:45:11.640]  classified DIA and joint chiefs of staff report predicted that arming the rebels
[03:45:11.640 --> 03:45:17.080]  and toppling Assad would lead to the rise of ISIS the Pentagon knew that Obama
[03:45:17.080 --> 03:45:23.200]  was arming Islamic extremists and that the Free Syrian Army had evaporated but
[03:45:23.200 --> 03:45:27.840]  the Obama administration didn't want to hear the truth and the report was
[03:45:27.840 --> 03:45:33.400]  deliberately buried so the Pentagon bypassed the White House entirely and
[03:45:33.400 --> 03:45:39.080]  handed intelligence on the same jihadist that Obama was arming to Israel
[03:45:39.080 --> 03:45:45.520]  Germany and Russia this intel was then directly passed to Assad who used it to
[03:45:45.520 --> 03:45:51.160]  turn the tide against the jihadists almost certainly saving Syria from being
[03:45:51.160 --> 03:45:56.280]  completely taken over by the Islamic State the bottom line is that many of
[03:45:56.280 --> 03:46:01.600]  the top brass in the Pentagon knew that Obama's policy would lead to an even
[03:46:01.600 --> 03:46:08.320]  bigger disaster than what we have now and took decisive action to derail it the
[03:46:08.320 --> 03:46:13.240]  secret measure was also partly a payback after Assad had helped fight al Qaeda
[03:46:13.240 --> 03:46:18.040]  after 9-11 and Syrian intelligence had stopped an al Qaeda attack on the
[03:46:18.040 --> 03:46:23.720]  headquarters of the US Navy's 5th fleet in Bahrain the US military also defied
[03:46:23.720 --> 03:46:29.920]  Obama by deliberately providing the rebels with outdated weapons according
[03:46:29.920 --> 03:46:34.880]  to Seymour Hirsch's Pentagon source but this was derailed by Saudi Arabia Qatar
[03:46:34.880 --> 03:46:40.320]  and Turkey who gave the ISIS jihadist modern weaponry in order to help them
[03:46:40.320 --> 03:46:45.840]  topple Assad in his report Hirsch also drops the bombshell that Turkey's
[03:46:45.840 --> 03:46:53.240]  support for ISIS is because Erdogan wants to restore the Ottoman Empire he
[03:46:53.240 --> 03:46:59.680]  shares virtually the same goal as ISIS who want to establish an Islamic caliphate
[03:46:59.680 --> 03:47:05.720]  or empire stretching into Europe just as Muslim crusaders did before the
[03:47:05.720 --> 03:47:10.520]  Christian Crusades this report is stunning because it confirms why the
[03:47:10.520 --> 03:47:16.920]  Obama White House failed to properly target ISIS for at least 15 months in
[03:47:16.920 --> 03:47:23.640]  his obsession with isolating Assad Obama knowingly armed ISIS and along with
[03:47:23.640 --> 03:47:29.920]  Turkey helped the terror organization build its caliphate now elements of the
[03:47:29.920 --> 03:47:36.880]  Pentagon are an open revolt against this insanity and will continue to be should
[03:47:36.880 --> 03:47:43.760]  Hillary Clinton capture the White House in so many ways 2016 is shaping up to be
[03:47:43.760 --> 03:47:49.800]  a pivotal year for the future of the Middle East the future of radical Islam
[03:47:49.800 --> 03:47:58.680]  and the future of the free world everything is at stake and that was
[03:47:58.680 --> 03:48:03.320]  Paul Joseph Watson was some incredible analysis and I have up here on our our
[03:48:03.320 --> 03:48:07.440]  little iMac in here Obama added his ISIS architect by Pulitzer Prize winning
[03:48:07.440 --> 03:48:12.280]  journalist and that has links to all three videos that we've produced one by
[03:48:12.280 --> 03:48:16.200]  Alex Jones which kind of gives you a big background of this one that's a little
[03:48:16.200 --> 03:48:21.440]  more in detail with John Bowne site Hirsch exposes Obama's ISIS and then
[03:48:21.440 --> 03:48:27.000]  what you just saw stunner Pentagon in secret revolt against Obama and that
[03:48:27.000 --> 03:48:30.800]  article is very important to get out to people right now they need to watch
[03:48:30.800 --> 03:48:34.080]  these videos they need to spread them to others we need to get lots of views on
[03:48:34.080 --> 03:48:38.360]  these videos to make them go viral so other people get like woken up to this
[03:48:38.360 --> 03:48:41.600]  because they think ISIS is this magic creation that happened in the middle of
[03:48:41.600 --> 03:48:45.160]  the desert by just sprinkling a little water in it and that's not how it happened
[03:48:45.160 --> 03:48:50.160]  and the works for a long very long time I mean you can go back to Zbigniew
[03:48:50.160 --> 03:48:54.080]  Brzezinski in the 80s you know funding Osama bin Laden you know I didn't really
[03:48:54.080 --> 03:48:57.560]  get popular until you know like a little over a year ago but I mean the people
[03:48:57.560 --> 03:49:02.160]  that we were fighting in Iraq like Al-Zarkali and stuff like that he was
[03:49:02.160 --> 03:49:06.920]  one of the main founders of ISIS you know and they took him out with two
[03:49:06.920 --> 03:49:12.720]  huge bombs we were out there around they was Camp Anaconda so I mean this
[03:49:12.720 --> 03:49:15.440]  has been going on for a while it's just now making the news but this stuff has
[03:49:15.440 --> 03:49:18.800]  been being built up they've been getting these people prepped and ready to go
[03:49:18.800 --> 03:49:22.320]  after Syria that's been one of their big ones they want to take out it was
[03:49:22.320 --> 03:49:26.160]  listed in the axis of evil you know so they've been they've been calling for
[03:49:26.160 --> 03:49:30.040]  Syria for a long time in fact my old band I was in we wrote a song called
[03:49:30.040 --> 03:49:34.200]  shock and all when we invaded Iraq and and we said in the song Syria your butt
[03:49:34.200 --> 03:49:40.400]  is next we didn't say but though let's go to Madwit in Michigan he wants to talk
[03:49:40.400 --> 03:49:45.040]  about the Second Amendment how's it going Madwit I'm not bad Rob thanks for
[03:49:45.040 --> 03:49:48.680]  taking my call Merry Christmas to you and Joe Merry Christmas to you too may all
[03:49:48.680 --> 03:49:51.640]  your Christmases be white
[03:49:51.640 --> 03:49:54.000]  we're gonna get one here in Michigan though looks like it's gonna rain yeah
[03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:57.640]  we're not gonna get one in Texas no not not Austin the only thing that's white
[03:49:57.640 --> 03:50:03.560]  to my hair there you go mine too hey listen all due respect you guys do a
[03:50:03.560 --> 03:50:06.640]  great job but I got a couple of bones to pick and you guys are wrong about a
[03:50:06.640 --> 03:50:10.320]  few things and I want to correct just one of them today if I can all right and
[03:50:10.320 --> 03:50:14.600]  it has to do with the Second Amendment now I know you had Ted Nugent on
[03:50:14.600 --> 03:50:19.600]  recently from the NRA and I've heard Larry Pratt and I've gone through all
[03:50:19.600 --> 03:50:23.960]  those organizations I I just I can't get anybody to actually understand
[03:50:23.960 --> 03:50:26.880]  this or respond to it but I've tried with you guys and I want to do it one
[03:50:26.880 --> 03:50:30.920]  more time first of all you can't defend the Second Amendment okay you can't
[03:50:30.920 --> 03:50:34.000]  defend it no matter how many times people say they're gonna defend it
[03:50:34.000 --> 03:50:39.000]  there's nothing to defend it's like Joe Biggs taken a crew armed and and a man
[03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:42.680]  to a position to take on the enemy and the enemy's not there there's nobody
[03:50:42.680 --> 03:50:46.520]  there you can't defend the Second Amendment because it's not something you
[03:50:46.520 --> 03:50:51.320]  defend it's something that you enforce and different hold that thought we're
[03:50:51.320 --> 03:50:54.160]  going to break I'm gonna let you finish up and I'll let you re-encapsulate what
[03:50:54.160 --> 03:50:57.800]  you just said stay tuned the final segment of the fourth hour can the
[03:50:57.800 --> 03:51:00.080]  Second Amendment be defended we're gonna answer that question my name is Don
[03:51:00.080 --> 03:51:05.200]  whiskin in 1994 I lost my 62 year old father to complications of bypass
[03:51:05.200 --> 03:51:10.520]  surgery in 1977 my 44 year old brother was found dead in his apartment he
[03:51:10.520 --> 03:51:14.920]  suffered a heart attack in January of 98 my mother had a stroke and passed away
[03:51:14.920 --> 03:51:19.920]  in her bed 21 days later my 53 year old brother passed away on his arrival to the
[03:51:19.920 --> 03:51:24.920]  hospital he waited too long in June that same year I almost joined them at 42

[03:54:05.840 --> 03:54:09.840]  final segment of the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show this is overdrive I'm your host Rob
[03:54:09.840 --> 03:54:13.840]  dude sitting next to me riding shotguns been Joe Biggs and if you guys want to pull up the
[03:54:13.840 --> 03:54:17.840]  computer this is actually footage of Joe yesterday we're not going to have time to play this but I encourage
[03:54:17.840 --> 03:54:21.840]  you to go check it out for yourself liberal trendies
[03:54:21.840 --> 03:54:25.840]  want to bring unvetted Syrian refugees to the US Joe went out
[03:54:25.840 --> 03:54:29.840]  and got people to sign a petition to bring in Syrian refugees and
[03:54:29.840 --> 03:54:33.840]  it's amazing you also ask them you know if they want to sponsor
[03:54:33.840 --> 03:54:37.840]  if they want to sponsor people when they come in most of them said no
[03:54:37.840 --> 03:54:41.840]  they want to bring them in well it was interesting you got these liberals out there they're like
[03:54:41.840 --> 03:54:45.840]  oh we hate Donald Trump bring Syrian refugees
[03:54:45.840 --> 03:54:49.840]  unvetted mmm that sounds delicious I was like well would you like
[03:54:49.840 --> 03:54:53.840]  to house them because you don't want to bring whole bunch of people over here to make them homeless and then
[03:54:53.840 --> 03:54:57.840]  they have to live off of our welfare system and screw that all up oh no
[03:54:57.840 --> 03:55:01.840]  I don't have room for that I was like well you want to bring them over here not give them
[03:55:01.840 --> 03:55:05.840]  place to stay I guess you're not too liberal you're liberal enough to destroy us but
[03:55:05.840 --> 03:55:09.840]  not liberal enough to take that uh well the government's got all the money the government
[03:55:09.840 --> 03:55:13.840]  can help you know you got people with families like yeah we'll sign up bring them on in
[03:55:13.840 --> 03:55:17.840]  we don't care and then you look at places like Germany where the crime is rampant
[03:55:17.840 --> 03:55:21.840]  because they're not vetting these people there was three people I talked to you from Sudan that came up
[03:55:21.840 --> 03:55:25.840]  and two of them said yeah I'll house them and the other girl was like oh she's like
[03:55:25.840 --> 03:55:29.840]  are you crazy she's like do you know what goes on she's like I'm not doing that
[03:55:29.840 --> 03:55:33.840]  and speaking of Syria here it is from Sputnik scores
[03:55:33.840 --> 03:55:37.840]  Germany with fake Syrian passports similar to Paris attackers
[03:55:37.840 --> 03:55:41.840]  so they're buying these for about two thousand dollars a piece they say they're nearly flawless
[03:55:41.840 --> 03:55:45.840]  well here's the thing though ISIS is the most profitable terrorist organization today
[03:55:45.840 --> 03:55:49.840]  they got money billions they got tons of money they're season oil fields
[03:55:49.840 --> 03:55:53.840]  they're you know holding people hostage how much does a passport machine
[03:55:53.840 --> 03:55:57.840]  cost yeah probably ten thousand dollars yeah they've got enough money to do exactly
[03:55:57.840 --> 03:56:01.840]  so it's not few far and beyond that this is happening and they're just going to plant people in with groups
[03:56:01.840 --> 03:56:05.840]  and they're going to be sleeper cells and they're going to come in and find people and get stuff
[03:56:05.840 --> 03:56:09.840]  right and they're going to unleash havoc but you know they're just not just going to sneak in there they're going to
[03:56:09.840 --> 03:56:13.840]  threaten people they're like all right I'm coming in with your family
[03:56:13.840 --> 03:56:19.840]  or we're going to kill your family back here I'll make sure that you guys are protected through this whole process to look at the US
[03:56:19.840 --> 03:56:23.840]  and after that as long as you help me in you let you know you fake that I'm in here
[03:56:23.840 --> 03:56:29.840]  all right mad wit finish up we got a couple minutes left finish up how we cannot defend the second amendment
[03:56:29.840 --> 03:56:33.840]  yeah my basic premise is you can't defend the second amendment you have to enforce it
[03:56:33.840 --> 03:56:39.840]  I just want to quote or paraphrase a guy Marcus Aurelius with Caesar he was general the armies
[03:56:39.840 --> 03:56:43.840]  he wrote in his meditation that in order to solve any problem and I'm paraphrasing
[03:56:43.840 --> 03:56:47.840]  first thing you have to do is know it for what it is in and of itself and what I'm going to tell you is this
[03:56:47.840 --> 03:56:51.840]  the second amendment doesn't provide any right the bill of rights don't provide any
[03:56:51.840 --> 03:56:55.840]  rights you can't enforce your rights through the second amendment what you do
[03:56:55.840 --> 03:57:01.840]  and what you do is that you enforce the second amendment on the people that swore the oath to uphold it
[03:57:01.840 --> 03:57:07.840]  there's only military political and judicial and law enforcement that swear that oath
[03:57:07.840 --> 03:57:11.840]  that oath says that they will never make a law they will never infringe they were never a bridge
[03:57:11.840 --> 03:57:17.840]  they never allene the rights that are listed under the bill of rights but there are rights for us
[03:57:17.840 --> 03:57:23.840]  their responsibilities for the government the people that swear the oath now when people go out there like
[03:57:23.840 --> 03:57:29.840]  Ted Nugent or Larry Pratt talk about defending the second amendment they tell you to be in a defensive mode
[03:57:29.840 --> 03:57:33.840]  to dig your feet in and to get ready to fight to defend something but there's nothing there
[03:57:33.840 --> 03:57:37.840]  in fact what it is it's a requirement of the people that swear the oath
[03:57:37.840 --> 03:57:43.840]  that they'll never create any laws or bring anything in regards that might in some way interfere with your
[03:57:43.840 --> 03:57:49.840]  God-given rights what they do is they plan God and say they're your God and that's what we've got a problem with
[03:57:49.840 --> 03:57:55.840]  because when we talk about these rights we double think it i've heard alex many times double think it he'll say you're exactly right
[03:57:55.840 --> 03:58:01.840]  God gives you your right blah blah blah then he'll turn right around and say we've got to defend our second amendment right
[03:58:01.840 --> 03:58:07.840]  you don't defend it you prosecute people that failed to uphold their oath what you've got just since 1968
[03:58:07.840 --> 03:58:13.840]  an additional member since then is a whole bunch of people that swore the oath that committed treason by failing
[03:58:13.840 --> 03:58:19.840]  to uphold their oath and it could be said over and over again but until people get rid of that double thing
[03:58:19.840 --> 03:58:25.840]  and it's the biggest organizations done to the gun owners of america the national rifle association that perpetrate
[03:58:25.840 --> 03:58:29.840]  this perspective all right hey thanks thanks for that madwin we're out of time
[03:58:29.840 --> 03:58:35.840]  it's definitely something to think about enforce the second amendment i'm rob dudes the fourth hour of overdrive thanks for watching
[03:58:35.840 --> 03:58:45.840]  join us again tomorrow at 11 am central america
