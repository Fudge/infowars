[00:52.360 --> 00:58.640]  high holy day that was then adopted by the Illuminati in the 1770s and then later by the
[00:58.640 --> 01:06.560]  Marxist and communist and coming up at the bottom of the second hour I'm gonna take a
[01:06.560 --> 01:13.400]  few minutes out to break down the history of May day for folks out there in the meantime
[01:13.400 --> 01:24.120]  obviously there have been giant developments on the Baltimore Freddie Gray situation separating
[01:24.120 --> 01:30.640]  out Freddie Gray separating out militarization of police separating out the thugification of
[01:30.640 --> 01:40.000]  the country in general black white Hispanic Asian cop non-cop separating all that out this
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.600]  story is being pushed by the controlled media and the bad guys to cause destabilization in this
[01:46.600 --> 01:52.120]  country people say well what are you about the cops I'm the guy that made four films and wrote
[01:52.120 --> 01:57.520]  a book and it's known as Mr. Anti-Police State I'm against the police state that doesn't mean
[01:57.520 --> 02:08.120]  I'm against the police because I understand the State Department of Random 7277 that's
[02:08.120 --> 02:17.120]  been out since 1962 the UN UNESCO general and complete plan for total disarmament of the people
[02:17.120 --> 02:25.040]  then the states and the police then the feds with only the UN being armed and you can search
[02:25.040 --> 02:32.320]  memorandum 7277 you can click Google images you can find the entire original manual you can read
[02:32.320 --> 02:40.800]  the text of it it's a big deal and to understand what's happening you have to get the facts that
[02:40.800 --> 02:48.080]  they use civil wars that the globalist stage in Libya or Syria or Ukraine or countless other
[02:48.080 --> 02:58.080]  places to then bring in the globalist forces and the IMF World Bank bailout whether they're
[02:58.080 --> 03:05.040]  as saviors not as occupiers that's how it's sold after long periods of civil unrest and again if
[03:05.040 --> 03:10.400]  you just Google State Department memorandum 7277 you can click on up in the upper corner there
[03:10.400 --> 03:15.840]  the blue version that is the that is the original version right there and they've got the entire
[03:15.840 --> 03:21.040]  scans online for folks that want to read it the United States program for general and complete
[03:21.040 --> 03:26.640]  disarmament in a peaceful world this is official policy you see right down there in the images
[03:26.640 --> 03:33.680]  guys where it shows the UN helmets see the helmets there underneath the UN symbol there's a block of
[03:33.680 --> 03:40.720]  right there see and it goes through the US has its troops phased out Russia has theirs phased out
[03:40.720 --> 03:45.840]  every other power has their troops phased down including their police and then the peacekeeping
[03:45.840 --> 03:52.880]  machinery the UN forces their helmets get bigger they build up while we build down to use the Orwellian
[03:53.440 --> 04:01.120]  Pentagon term for reducing the military so the old timers sir saw this heard all this went crazy
[04:01.120 --> 04:08.720]  warned everybody we've held it back a long time but it's now here and Michael Moore is gone public
[04:08.720 --> 04:18.080]  we have video of it it's up on info wars.com I told you this was coming last week and yesterday

[04:42.960 --> 04:43.280]  wants
[04:46.400 --> 04:53.280]  prisons clear just release all the criminals and take all the guns from everybody but the
[04:53.280 --> 04:58.080]  federal government told you that was coming and after the civil war they're gonna try to pass it
[04:58.080 --> 05:06.480]  the reverend Al Sharpton wants to federalize cops and fight against state's rights and he is calling
[05:06.480 --> 05:13.360]  for the justice department to take over the policing of america this idea is of course at
[05:13.360 --> 05:19.520]  odds with the philosophy of the constitution and the declaration of independence but it hasn't stopped
[05:19.520 --> 05:25.280]  Al Sharpton or the Obama administration from wanting to federalize state and local police
[05:25.280 --> 05:32.800]  police earlier this year Obama introduced a task force on 21st century policing and it advocates
[05:32.800 --> 05:38.960]  the federalization of police departments across the country the task force includes three mayors
[05:39.520 --> 05:46.880]  one of which just happens to be Mayor Stephanie Rawlings Blake of Baltimore imagine that for

[08:52.400 --> 08:59.680]  we have moved them to next week because there is just so much to cover before i go any further
[09:00.800 --> 09:06.880]  all the pieces have clicked together the battle plan the globalist destabilization program
[09:07.520 --> 09:15.360]  all of it is exactly as we basically predicted the problem is i have gone into false flag i've
[09:15.360 --> 09:21.040]  gone into federalization globalization i've gone into hegelian dialectics i've gone into
[09:21.040 --> 09:25.760]  the admitted stand down of the police under orders which is now official and admitted
[09:25.760 --> 09:31.440]  so things we get out of hand i've explained the plan to destabilize the country but i want to go
[09:32.080 --> 09:37.920]  specifically to the document itself here then we're going to open the phones up
[09:37.920 --> 09:50.400]  7277 state department memorandum and public law 7277 you can go to scribs you can go anywhere i'm
[09:50.400 --> 09:55.200]  posting the whole document with the scans the original document that was not passed by congress
[09:55.200 --> 10:00.160]  but was implemented by the bureaucracy under the un treaty with unesco
[10:00.160 --> 10:08.560]  1961 became public law via executive action 1962
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.520]  freedom from war the united states program for general and complete disarmament in the
[10:15.520 --> 10:20.640]  peaceful world department of state disarmament series five
[10:21.920 --> 10:27.920]  office of public services bureau public affairs in it they have the graphs that show
[10:27.920 --> 10:32.480]  the u.s. military being phased out every other world army being phased down to zero
[10:33.040 --> 10:40.080]  and a giant un global peacekeeper force based in the hag taking conscripts from every country
[10:40.720 --> 10:46.160]  from every district no i didn't get this from the hunger games the hunger games got it from this
[10:48.640 --> 10:55.920]  the white uniforms everything it is it is right out of star wars because this is all
[10:55.920 --> 11:04.080]  art imitating life the big empire and the united nation said on july 7 2000
[11:07.760 --> 11:11.760]  that they wanted to have the office of unity or the small arms disarmament bureau
[11:12.320 --> 11:16.800]  move to have the complete abolition of civilian ownership of firearms because
[11:18.640 --> 11:23.760]  civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state
[11:23.760 --> 11:29.360]  that's an exact quote civilian ownership of firearms threatens
[11:31.600 --> 11:36.080]  the legitimate power monopoly of the state it's a very true statement except for one word legitimate
[11:37.040 --> 11:40.480]  there's nothing legitimate about a power monopoly unless you want to live in north korea
[11:40.480 --> 11:44.080]  or nancy germany or malice china or soviet russia
[11:46.880 --> 11:51.680]  now i said and i just got chills and i don't just say that as an effect i mean i i get chills when
[11:51.680 --> 11:58.400]  we talk about this because it's all happening i said yesterday and i said the day before
[12:00.000 --> 12:06.000]  and i said two weeks ago before i left town for five days that you would then hear the white house
[12:06.560 --> 12:14.160]  and michael more call for the complete disarmament of local police departments unless they go under
[12:14.160 --> 12:21.840]  total federal control this is the seven two seven seven plan first they disarm the people then they
[12:21.840 --> 12:27.280]  disarm the police the state police the local police except for special paramilitary special
[12:27.280 --> 12:32.960]  event police that are the new praetorian guard and then they serve under the un that's why austin police
[12:33.840 --> 12:39.520]  dc police new york police are all in these international exchange programs sound reasonable
[12:39.520 --> 12:45.360]  on the surface but they're all being unified into one global standardized command
[12:46.640 --> 12:53.200]  all in seven two seven seven and subsequent meetings and events and it doesn't happen overnight
[12:53.200 --> 12:59.760]  it's done as a process you don't wake up and it's martial law you don't
[13:03.280 --> 13:07.520]  one day it suddenly everything's changed it's done incrementally so they can always say
[13:07.520 --> 13:12.560]  where's the nsa spying where's the open borders where's the gun confiscation well you notice
[13:13.440 --> 13:18.320]  a lot of that's already happened but it's not really announced sure it's buried in the paper the
[13:18.320 --> 13:23.440]  border's gone the illegals can come in everything is paid for vouchers sure they're taking the vets
[13:23.440 --> 13:27.920]  guns right now in a bunch of states they're they're they're they're taking people's guns outside of
[13:27.920 --> 13:33.440]  law sure sure they're disappearing some people sure some drone strikes have killed some us citizens
[13:33.440 --> 13:40.800]  sure sure the nsa spy on everything but they just kind of kind of phase it in well michael more has
[13:40.800 --> 13:46.240]  now come out and news 12 is reporting on it bloomberg is also carrying it michael more calls for full
[13:46.240 --> 13:56.320]  disarmament of police wants prisons empty and again he should have said of nonviolent marijuana
[13:56.320 --> 14:00.880]  offenders that fill it up so they can't keep the violence i mean it would be a disaster if they
[14:00.880 --> 14:05.680]  released the hardened criminals in fact they do release them studies you can look them up show
[14:05.680 --> 14:09.600]  they release violent offenders quicker than nonviolent because they cost money they don't
[14:09.600 --> 14:14.800]  make money they want the little pothead who got caught with a half pound of weed he was selling
[14:15.360 --> 14:20.400]  because he'll work good in the call center or making license plates or furniture in prison
[14:20.400 --> 14:26.000]  industries people say well make them prisoners work they don't even have air conditioning in texas folks
[14:26.000 --> 14:33.520]  you know i guess they're like 110 here and people die you're like good they're all prisoners wait
[14:33.520 --> 14:40.320]  till you're in there for no reason and they release violent offenders back on the street and they
[14:40.320 --> 14:46.720]  keep the nonviolent and then you say well make the prisoners work they're competing against you
[14:46.720 --> 14:51.920]  on the high scale for 25 cents an hour you think illegal aliens are driving down your wages
[14:51.920 --> 14:57.760]  i mean use your brains folks there's four million people in prison other seven million in the system
[14:57.760 --> 15:01.360]  with the largest prison population in the world and it doesn't make things better
[15:02.960 --> 15:09.120]  but see michael more uses a real problem and just says release everyone that's what communists always
[15:09.120 --> 15:15.280]  do that's what stalin did and then made him his enforcers that's why they're now hiring criminals
[15:15.280 --> 15:21.840]  with criminal backgrounds as police even felonies and they're hiring illegals as police i mean welcome
[15:22.480 --> 15:25.840]  to the communist model applied by fascists running the show
[15:27.760 --> 15:32.560]  so michael more calls for full disarmament of police wants prisons cleared
[15:35.600 --> 15:40.320]  he turned to twitter thursday morning devoices demands we have video of a newscast where they
[15:40.320 --> 15:45.680]  read the tweets to society in the wake of civil unrest in baltimore we're going to go over some
[15:45.680 --> 15:52.160]  of those in a moment we're going to play a newscast that breaks that down but understand
[15:52.160 --> 15:56.720]  you've got the white house saying that's the police's fault they're going to federalize them
[15:56.720 --> 16:01.840]  you've got the the mayor basically saying that and now freddie gray's death has been ruled a
[16:01.840 --> 16:08.480]  homicide officers face charges some witnesses in the patty wagon say he was beating his
[16:08.480 --> 16:12.880]  head against the wall who knows if that's true others are saying that they were beating him
[16:13.920 --> 16:17.680]  i mean are there bad cops could they have killed him could they covered it up absolutely
[16:17.680 --> 16:22.720]  do we need to have a civil war over it with michael more and george soros involved george
[16:22.720 --> 16:28.720]  soros 33 million just in ferguson trying to get a race war this guy just overthrew ukraine
[16:28.720 --> 16:32.480]  a year and a half ago pulling the same garbage playing two groups off against each other
[16:32.480 --> 16:39.760]  catholics and orthodox and everybody just dances to his tune he plays the he plays the
[16:40.240 --> 16:45.440]  flute and everybody follows the pied piper i mean does everyone have to be chomped by george
[16:45.440 --> 16:54.720]  soros and michael more every time it's just insane it's 7277 create unrest create civil wars
[16:55.360 --> 16:59.680]  disarm the locals disarm the people checkmate world government
[16:59.680 --> 17:05.680]  what do you think these mop up operations are around the world freddie gray's death ruled a
[17:05.680 --> 17:13.920]  homicide officers face charges state attorney maryland mosby she looks like a clone of the
[17:14.640 --> 17:18.640]  mayor the chief prosecutor for baltimore announced this warning that her office has
[17:18.640 --> 17:24.080]  also found probable cause to pursue criminal charges in connection with the case mosby
[17:24.080 --> 17:29.200]  announced a series of charges now facing the six police officers involved in putting gray
[17:29.200 --> 17:34.240]  in custody and transporting him to the police wagon on the morning of april 12th the charges
[17:34.240 --> 17:39.200]  vary for each individual but includes several counts of manslaughter second degree assault
[17:39.200 --> 17:44.640]  misconduct in the office and false imprisonment among others they're now ruling his arrestee
[17:44.640 --> 17:50.320]  legal so they're calling it a false imprisonment and it may be and they may have beat him to death
[17:50.320 --> 17:53.120]  and then and manslaughter would be the charge i don't think they knew they were killing him
[17:53.120 --> 18:02.000]  and look i'm not even defending the cops folks and i'm not saying all eastern cops are bad in my
[18:02.000 --> 18:10.800]  experience east coast cops have at least been the most rude and mean to me um but i've run into some
[18:10.800 --> 18:16.640]  bad ones in rural areas in texas as well as just unaccountable bullies some departments aren't
[18:16.640 --> 18:22.320]  like that but the federal culture has been pushing them in this direction giving them the armaments
[18:22.320 --> 18:27.600]  driving the phony drug war incarcerating the peaceful people giving them this killer training
[18:28.400 --> 18:32.560]  turning them from peace officers and guardians of the republic more and more into these attack
[18:32.560 --> 18:39.440]  dog enforcers and then they sit back and watch the fire they started consume the country hyping
[18:39.440 --> 18:43.440]  every event up even though police violence is actually flat you look at the studies out there
[18:46.800 --> 18:51.760]  and all i can say is man you drive through a poor white area poor black area poor mixed area
[18:51.760 --> 18:54.160]  i drove through east austin down manor road yesterday
[18:57.440 --> 19:01.920]  because my dad's semi-retired so he does dentistry that's kind of like a community service he still
[19:01.920 --> 19:06.480]  does it for poor kids and stuff like that so i drove way out to where he works sometimes part
[19:06.480 --> 19:11.920]  time as pediatric dentist and i drove back from far east austin it's actually kind of nice to
[19:11.920 --> 19:17.280]  right through east austin and let me tell you folks most those people aren't working and i mean
[19:17.280 --> 19:25.200]  i'ma say it big giant groups of thug white people black people hispanics mixed gangs
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.120]  um and they were acting like gangs they were bugging their eyes out they were saying stuff to
[19:29.120 --> 19:34.400]  me at red lights and and i had to control myself not rolled on the window i mean it's
[19:34.960 --> 19:40.480]  you want to just like charles barkley said hey you want to disarm the local police man
[19:41.200 --> 19:45.520]  and then disarm the people do you know what's coming because let me tell you i'm not knocking
[19:45.520 --> 19:48.720]  everybody out in east austin there's some nice restaurants and nice people over there but

[24:17.120 --> 24:23.920]  nothing this is part of the federal and global training and this is part of the federalization
[24:25.440 --> 24:30.560]  steve watson's written a story about it it's on info wars dot com by the way the guy's white
[24:31.840 --> 24:39.840]  being attacked and when you look at this you understand the federal government is the group
[24:39.840 --> 24:46.640]  ignoring the bill of rights and constitution on borders and debt and sovereignty and energy
[24:46.640 --> 24:52.480]  and military operations on every front now it's come out witnesses are going to testify to congress
[24:52.480 --> 24:58.240]  that the nsa spied on the supreme court and blackmailed them of course how do you think they've
[24:58.240 --> 25:04.560]  got so-called conservative justices getting ready to vote to uh you know teach five-year-old boys
[25:04.560 --> 25:16.960]  how to wear dresses and have internships with leslie of austin fame and we've got michael more
[25:16.960 --> 25:26.400]  quote next to man disarmed the police and he goes through more of these quotes i want every
[25:26.400 --> 25:30.640]  african-american currently incarcerated for drug crimes or nonviolent offenses released
[25:30.640 --> 25:36.080]  from prison today how about everybody more see it's it's it's it's just sick
[25:40.880 --> 25:47.200]  and michael more goes on you know he's not eating michelle's lunches pushing this
[25:47.200 --> 25:51.440]  michael more calls for full disarmament of police once prisons basically empty
[25:52.880 --> 26:00.080]  and then we have a memorandum 7277 that was enacted outside of law but then on september
[26:00.080 --> 26:12.400]  26 1961 public law 87-297 was signed by kennedy we even have the seal on the scan authentication
[26:12.400 --> 26:18.400]  u.s. government information gpo we have a document cam shot on that for tv viewers
[26:20.960 --> 26:23.200]  should just just pull back and i'll show him there you go there it is
[26:24.640 --> 26:28.800]  again if you're a radio listener there's a whole other dimension to this show info wars dot
[26:28.800 --> 26:34.800]  com forward slash show and send that link to friends family email at facebook twitter
[26:35.440 --> 26:39.360]  that's how we get more people to actually watch what we're doing to see that we're not making this
[26:39.360 --> 26:45.920]  stuff up so that's the plan i mean the feds give the tanks give the training the police
[26:47.040 --> 26:53.760]  hollywood promotes on every cop show i watch i mean i watched on a plane ride back from la
[26:53.760 --> 27:00.320]  giving a speech a month ago i talked about it uh chicago pd's name of the show and they tortured
[27:00.320 --> 27:06.560]  someone every five minutes it was basically torture porn and the way they situationally
[27:06.560 --> 27:12.240]  set it up i would have tortured people too i mean the way that cops are good guys in the show
[27:12.240 --> 27:16.240]  they're doing it for the right reason they turn out to be right that's another real world works
[27:16.240 --> 27:21.680]  when you start torturing people you get tyranny you get fake confessions that's why free country's
[27:21.680 --> 27:27.920]  ban it that's why tyrannical countries love it north korea loves it george washington would
[27:27.920 --> 27:34.320]  execute you to be caught you're doing it because you lose the moral high ground you get bad intel
[27:35.280 --> 27:42.240]  it is the blood of tyranny it is the ether of corruption it is the oxygen of oppression
[27:42.240 --> 27:48.480]  to have torture and secret arrest and spying and not having to process so cops are watching these
[27:48.480 --> 27:54.640]  cop shows where they're slamming people's head in the ground and busting down doors and releasing
[27:54.640 --> 27:59.120]  police dogs on people without warrants and they go out thinking that's cool to do and you know what
[27:59.120 --> 28:03.600]  a lot of the times they're right and it is a bad guy and they find the drugs they find the child
[28:03.600 --> 28:09.200]  porn they they find the underage prostitutes they find the meth lab there are a bunch of degenerates
[28:09.200 --> 28:17.520]  with a starving kid and a you know baby carriage in the back or a crib but it erodes everything and
[28:17.520 --> 28:22.560]  then none of us are safe and a greater evil comes in that's how you corrupt the country and it's
[28:22.560 --> 28:30.080]  happened and now they've politically charged these police may be reasonable may not be but you know
[28:30.080 --> 28:34.400]  if they don't get convicted and if they don't get life in prison nothing else will be enough
[28:36.160 --> 28:41.520]  i saw there were more uh more unrest in philadelphia now yesterday and it's spreading to other areas
[28:41.520 --> 28:47.280]  and what about if you go to the hip hop rock star websites every day there's new videos of white people
[28:47.840 --> 28:50.560]  all over the country being beaten up because they're white
[28:52.960 --> 28:59.760]  i talk about east austin you can't hardly go at night into the edge of east austin where they
[28:59.760 --> 29:06.240]  have really nice restaurants and a lot of cool stuff by the way it wasn't this way 15 years ago
[29:06.240 --> 29:11.360]  20 years ago i used to be on access televisions where i started 20 years ago and i was still there
[29:11.360 --> 29:15.520]  up till 10 years ago the 20 fans were showing up so i had to quit using them they had nice studios
[29:15.520 --> 29:19.920]  still over there and i'd eaten all the barbecue places all the places that and all the soul food
[29:19.920 --> 29:26.000]  places that are still there and really popular today and areas were dangerous where the drugs were
[29:26.000 --> 29:30.640]  sold but other than that if you were white you didn't get attacked because you were white you do get
[29:30.640 --> 29:37.120]  attacked now and the media tries to cover it up but it's serious so where's the anger and the riots
[29:37.120 --> 29:41.680]  for all the white people getting beaten to death and getting shot by racist black people see
[29:42.720 --> 29:47.920]  because it's being framed as a race war not as anti militarization of police and the feds
[29:47.920 --> 29:55.440]  are posing as saviors we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:59.680 --> 30:06.160]  the dallas morning news is the latest mainstream publication to attack alex jones and info wars
[30:06.160 --> 30:12.960]  over our coverage of the jade helm military exercise with a hit piece that dwells on b12
[30:12.960 --> 30:19.920]  vitamins rather than addressing any of the issues surrounding the actual drill in a piece entitled
[30:19.920 --> 30:26.800]  mission accomplished mr abbot alex jones is over the moon for you mike drago's article doesn't set
[30:26.800 --> 30:33.920]  a high bar for accuracy getting basic facts wrong like info wars being a web only tv show
[30:33.920 --> 30:41.520]  though after labeling jones a weasley purveyor of baseless conspiracy theories drago proceeds to
[30:41.520 --> 30:49.040]  rip into texas governor greg abbot for his tactic endorsement of jones's silly theory on operation
[30:49.040 --> 30:56.400]  jade helm 15 and you can get more details on this hit piece right now at info wars dot com

[37:04.880 --> 37:12.640]  later in the next hour there were hundreds of new articles today over a hundred with the term
[37:12.640 --> 37:18.000]  jade helm alex jones in them there were 365 yesterday so they're they're cooling down a
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.720]  bit for now i guess catching their breath uh to follow the new talking points but mission
[37:22.720 --> 37:29.600]  accomplished this is in the dallas morning news today mr abbot alex jones is over the moon for you
[37:30.400 --> 37:37.280]  by mike drago i guess he's a dragon that wants to eat our freedoms and he just goes into making fun
[37:37.280 --> 37:44.240]  of me and the governor how dare the governor try to stop obama opening the borders how dare the
[37:44.240 --> 37:50.160]  governor uh want to actually not shut down all our power plants and how dare i say that he's doing
[37:50.160 --> 37:57.040]  a good job so far which is very rare in this country uh with telling them the us military
[37:57.040 --> 38:02.400]  under obama's command do not engage in unconstitutional operations i mean abbot knows
[38:02.400 --> 38:07.840]  there's a power grab going on half of congress has been quoted saying we're going into total tyranny
[38:07.840 --> 38:12.800]  and that the president's operating as a dictator i mean is anybody looking around we're just supposed
[38:12.800 --> 38:18.800]  to you know be ridiculed oh you're saying there's a power grab haha i'm mike drago
[38:18.800 --> 38:34.000]  it's insane it's over the top and this is just one that i had time to scan over and they follow
[38:34.000 --> 38:41.520]  up the same talking point as was in the statesman and i can't tell you i've looked at more than 30
[38:41.520 --> 38:46.560]  or 40 articles that that had this narrative in it so see they follow an exact narrative
[38:46.560 --> 38:52.000]  of they make fun of the fact that we sell vitamins and minerals on the website
[38:54.880 --> 39:01.440]  of course if you go to the dallas morning news they have ads for vitamins and minerals as well
[39:03.360 --> 39:07.920]  in fact i was on this morning and noticed because of what was in the keywords in the article
[39:07.920 --> 39:13.760]  there were actually articles for vitamins and minerals right next to it isn't it horrible we
[39:13.760 --> 39:20.880]  sell methylcobalamin that's much more bioavailable and basically able to be absorbed by the body
[39:24.160 --> 39:28.560]  we sell basically the pharmaceutical grade to the public that's what methylcobalamin is
[39:28.560 --> 39:34.640]  is what you inject but this is for in the mouth isn't it horrible that we fund ourselves and we
[39:34.640 --> 39:40.000]  don't get government contracts and government payment for pr like the dallas morning news and
[39:40.000 --> 39:48.640]  below is on record doing oh my gosh that just it's terrible did you hear alex jones
[39:50.720 --> 39:57.680]  did you hear he he funds his own operation he sells t-shirts and books and videos and non-gmo
[39:57.680 --> 40:05.840]  seeds and high quality water filters and then he funds his own operation that is so evil it's so
[40:05.840 --> 40:10.160]  shameful it's like he's a televangelist preacher or something
[40:18.560 --> 40:27.520]  and then they go on to say that you can get vitamin b12 bottle twice as big for $19 on amazon
[40:27.520 --> 40:38.720]  and ours is 1995 when it's on sale 2495 when it's not do you understand you could buy a bottle of
[40:40.640 --> 40:45.840]  b vitamins for like five dollars but it's synthetic absolute toxic crud
[40:46.800 --> 40:52.400]  i mean do you understand that it cost me more than ten dollars a bottle for secret 12
[40:52.400 --> 40:59.360]  and then we mark it up and fund the operation but most vitamin companies mark it up four five six
[40:59.360 --> 41:06.720]  seven times we mark it up once or once and a half unprecedented quality dna force has over
[41:06.720 --> 41:15.760]  50 dollars of product in it that's an industry game changer we've got products that are 1495
[41:15.760 --> 41:23.920]  that are high quality we got stuff it's 130 we're not ashamed of it oxy powder life changing
[41:24.640 --> 41:32.560]  it's not even marked up 100 percent it's marked up like 75 percent how do you think i pay for
[41:32.560 --> 41:38.240]  reporters and plane tickets and tv studios and satellites and in bandwidth it's incredible how
[41:38.240 --> 41:45.280]  expensive this is and by the grace of god and your support we're able to continue to be on air
[41:45.280 --> 41:48.560]  and even grow some but in the face of the enemy i want to really grow
[41:53.680 --> 41:56.880]  i want to really fight these people but it just doesn't work it shows
[41:57.440 --> 42:03.120]  how there's a talking point on how to attack us and these people all then plagiarize each other
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.240]  that's what it is this is almost a carbon copy of the austin america statesman
[42:08.240 --> 42:15.440]  written by another guy it was another guy wrote down can we check there's a bunch of these
[42:15.440 --> 42:17.680]  is this all the same guy i don't think so i saw different names
[42:20.400 --> 42:24.640]  mission accomplished mr abbott alex jones is over the moon
[42:26.880 --> 42:34.240]  for you no i'm not i had ron paul on yesterday highly respected statesman all over the world
[42:34.240 --> 42:39.040]  he speaks to parliaments around the planet everything he's talked about is coming true
[42:39.040 --> 42:42.480]  and he said no i think abbot's doing a pretty good job right now and i didn't even support him
[42:43.600 --> 42:44.160]  paul said
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.240]  but he said yeah he's he's really doing good that's so refreshing and he may disappoint
[42:54.240 --> 42:59.840]  us god i hope he doesn't but if he does disappoint us it's because scum like the dallas warning news
[42:59.840 --> 43:05.600]  have bullied him or his staff into believing that that they're in control it was the patriots that
[43:05.600 --> 43:12.560]  put governor abbott in texas and he knows that and he knows like they talk about in the article
[43:13.440 --> 43:19.440]  that a lot of wealthy powerful people who are patriots in texas know what's going on and don't
[43:19.440 --> 43:24.320]  want to destroy the country and they didn't make their money ripping people off like george soros
[43:24.320 --> 43:29.440]  uh or warren buffett and manker bailouts and currency evaluations they made their money by
[43:29.440 --> 43:36.400]  companies and having thousands of employees and building a civilization in texas and we don't
[43:36.400 --> 43:42.080]  want to see our guns taken and our country collapse and our factories shut down we're fighting to
[43:42.080 --> 43:48.960]  build a future it's why like lifeboats people are piling out of new york and california and illinois
[43:48.960 --> 43:56.000]  and former great states like michigan with great people they're here flooding 500 people
[43:56.000 --> 44:01.360]  moved to austin a day it was like that a year ago a week
[44:04.160 --> 44:08.560]  flooding to dallas flooding to houston flooding to san antonio and it's not that we're perfect
[44:09.200 --> 44:16.160]  it's just that we're polite people are nice there's still jobs there's lower taxes cost of
[44:16.160 --> 44:21.600]  living's lower but the thing is the people coming here from the states they destroyed
[44:21.600 --> 44:26.080]  don't even know why they're come they don't know why they're coming here other than they can get a
[44:26.080 --> 44:31.120]  job and then they try to they honk at you for no reason they cuss at you they yell at you they cut
[44:31.120 --> 44:36.400]  in front of you i was sitting there a few weekends ago with my kids and my hand on the counter uh
[44:36.400 --> 44:43.680]  ordering food at this little diner and this woman jerked the menu out from under my elbow
[44:43.680 --> 44:47.440]  and there was a whole stack of them right by there and she aggressively looked at me wanting to have
[44:47.440 --> 44:52.000]  a petty power trip and i just said i forgive you i understand you don't have any power in your life
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.840]  and you wanted to be aggressive there's a whole stack of menus right there and she started going
[44:55.840 --> 45:00.160]  what what i started giggling and i went it's okay did you just move here in the last six months
[45:00.160 --> 45:05.920]  from california and she went i did you texans i told the story one time as i was driving my truck
[45:05.920 --> 45:11.040]  around at a p terry's hamburger place with my kids after i took him to barton springs
[45:11.040 --> 45:18.400]  and it's a local hamburger chain i don't eat it chains you know national chains it's a local one
[45:20.640 --> 45:24.320]  and these women just walk in front of me when i'm already rolling like one mile an hour up to the
[45:24.320 --> 45:28.320]  window and they went what's your problem what's your look at that big truck look at that big truck
[45:28.320 --> 45:32.560]  what's what's your now what hey i'm not here to get barked at by you i'm real friendly to get my
[45:32.560 --> 45:37.680]  face well you're from california aren't you by the way i'm not knocking good california is the
[45:37.680 --> 45:42.480]  best people in the world we got a lot of affiliates in california beautiful wonderful state my gosh
[45:42.480 --> 45:49.040]  your new port beach in the south places like uh shana cruise in the central area i mean it's
[45:49.040 --> 45:55.200]  i'd live there used to be like texas 50 years ago much oklahomans in texas settled it but not
[45:55.200 --> 45:59.280]  any more folks and now the people who can't get jobs in california are coming here maybe that will
[45:59.280 --> 46:04.560]  fix california and then there were more people walking up to the window there because they also
[46:04.560 --> 46:08.160]  have a middle window people to walk up to get food and they're like what's your problem buddy
[46:08.160 --> 46:13.120]  for these trendies and i went what's my problem she just bowed up and got my face and started
[46:13.120 --> 46:18.400]  cussing at me i forgot that part in front of my kids i'm just simply speaking back and i'm in a
[46:18.400 --> 46:22.880]  in a somewhat raised tone explaining that uh you know it's not bad that i have a truck
[46:23.680 --> 46:29.920]  and that you know my family lives here and they got so angry they got so upset we're going to
[46:29.920 --> 46:36.000]  launch the phone system up there and then after we uh boot that i'm going to uh give the phone
[46:36.000 --> 46:45.680]  number out the toll-free number to join us is 800 259 92 31 where do you think jade helm and the
[46:45.680 --> 46:50.560]  move to federalized police is going will they be successful starting riots this summer there's now
[46:50.560 --> 46:58.080]  no doubt it doesn't mean the police state's good but they're they're contriving the anger now
[46:58.080 --> 47:03.520]  because this is their problem reaction solution what do we do to derail it can it be stopped 800
[47:03.520 --> 47:10.080]  259 92 31 freddy gray's death has been ruled a homicide homicers face charges
[47:12.800 --> 47:18.960]  the man who filmed the freddy gray video has been arrested at gunpoint that sounds very suspicious
[47:18.960 --> 47:23.920]  and real police state activity and absolutely the type of thing that'll discredit the police
[47:23.920 --> 47:28.640]  department and allow them to be federalized but see it's an inside job they're already federalized
[47:28.640 --> 47:32.800]  through their mayor and others that are best buddies of obama who ordered the stand-down
[47:34.240 --> 47:39.360]  if the cops did wrong you got to hang them out to dry kevin more the man who filmed freddy gray's
[47:39.360 --> 47:43.440]  brutal arrest has now him shelf and arrested following harassment and intimidation from
[47:43.440 --> 47:47.600]  multiple police more was arrested at gunpoint last night one with two other members of cop watch
[47:47.600 --> 47:53.680]  group dedicated to filming documenting police work the video of gray's arrest shot shortly before
[47:55.520 --> 47:59.840]  the man suffered spinal injuries which the police custody that led to his death
[48:02.640 --> 48:07.200]  more claims that despite having co-operated with two detectives in baltimore police department's
[48:07.200 --> 48:11.840]  office of internal oversight and given them the video police posted his photo and told the public
[48:11.840 --> 48:17.200]  that he was wanted for questioning asking police to identify him so they came out and got him
[48:17.200 --> 48:25.600]  that is pure harassment if true i rate congressman gives cops easy rule just follow the bleeping
[48:25.600 --> 48:34.240]  constitution but again michael more just says the answer is just our police no that's not the
[48:34.240 --> 48:38.320]  answer that's why you got to watch out when they say don't let police have semi-autos don't let
[48:38.320 --> 48:43.120]  them have rifles you know don't let them in big cities have an armored vehicle it's one thing
[48:43.120 --> 48:47.840]  that they got one armored vehicle for a hostage situation or bank robbery a few times a year
[48:49.120 --> 48:52.800]  or swat team raids on actual violent you know known killers
[48:54.640 --> 48:58.960]  but to have fleets of them to have general police being trained to have it being expanded to have
[48:58.960 --> 49:05.280]  those tactics that was very dangerous but i don't care police have a uh 223 rifle in case somebody
[49:05.280 --> 49:10.240]  shooting at folks from a hundred yards away and they got to shoot them i mean look let the public
[49:10.240 --> 49:19.120]  have guns but the police have guns that's how you circumvent public law 87-297 in the memorandum from
[49:19.120 --> 49:26.720]  the un 7277 that says they'll use civil unrest in different countries including the us for total
[49:26.720 --> 49:31.200]  disarmament and that that is their plan read it and weep did you know there's a law in the books
[49:31.200 --> 49:38.880]  for total disarmament they're just afraid to try to implement it now to the dallas morning news
[49:38.880 --> 49:44.400]  chagrin when i read this this morning i came in and said you know what you don't like us selling
[49:44.400 --> 49:51.120]  high quality colloidal silver or super male vitality or high quality vitamin b12 uh methyl
[49:51.120 --> 49:55.360]  cabalamin the highest quality just it's it's it's it's i've taken because i have a prescription

[50:20.080 --> 50:24.000]  don't say jade helm isn't real they don't say we're not militarized they lie and say that i say
[50:24.000 --> 50:30.320]  total marshal law is coming no it's already here to a great extent and they lie and say that uh

[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.800]  update and then i will just phone calls the entire broadcast interspersed with news i've got to settle
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.440]  down because if i get wound up for three hours which i can do i'm just dead after the show and
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.200]  can't get all the business stuff done of news and analysis and planning yesterday i was so hyped up
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:23.520]  that i was just a wreck for about two hours after the show uh let's go ahead and talk to ironhead
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.280]  you're on the air for in washington welcome hey there how you doing but you almost give you
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:37.040]  wound up too hey do you remember back about the year two before bush left office he flew into
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:43.920]  tokyo for a one-hour meeting we only had a g7 at the time there was no g10 do you remember when
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:51.280]  he sat down with amijin adad and it was mededved not putin who was in position putin replaced
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:59.520]  mededved shortly thereafter and then we had the spitznet crews coming into uh for colin's for the
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:08.720]  disarmament drills can you tie it together in terms of what you see with the un and jade helm
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:17.360]  well there are giant covert agendas going on and the globalists though think we're stupid so they
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.440]  think we don't read books which the general public doesn't and then we read you what they've said in
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:25.280]  the books and show you the documents and the dallas morning news the new york times just says
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:31.280]  that doesn't exist he's a liar knowing people won't go check like memorandum 7277 or public law
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:38.640]  87-297 and that story's up on info wars dot com right now uh kit daniels did you know a
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.600]  law is on the books to disarm all americans incredibly important article we need to red
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:50.160]  link it and again i've known all this forever for 25 years uh this i mean i knew about this
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.560]  before i was really politically awake i knew about the un plan but it just becomes a rumor
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:00.400]  hey there's a un plan to get the guns well yeah it's on the books and a treaty and that's why
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:07.600]  government just moves forward uh to try to get all this done but if you look at the russian
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:14.240]  troops inspecting the facilities and training for anti-terrorism drills uh that's going on and then
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:19.360]  now it looks like there's been double crossing going on so that deal's breaking down but then a
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:25.280]  lot of the high level generals i've talked to former and current say no that's a scam as well
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:31.920]  above that the russians are actually working with the top bankers uh the truth is they're all double
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:38.640]  crossing each other it's like a james bond movie with with specter uh the the establishment doesn't
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:44.880]  even know who's on whose side right now that's why they're always jockeying and changing position and
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.560]  rebalancing in kissinger's words but you notice they're good at that these mega banks that sit
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:56.400]  above the countries as our nation's going to more debt as we implode as our birth rates drop in the
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:03.520]  west the globalist agenda moves forward on a planetary scale so uh they are right now winning
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.920]  but they're slowing their win they're slowing their role they're getting more opposition as people
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:17.760]  become aware of their their philosophy their mo their program how they operate uh but that's
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:23.200]  basically what's happening but yes that's why they have to have the u.s military ready for gun
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.320]  confiscation and why since the 60s they've been publicly training for it it's just now
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:33.520]  the training has gone from a one to about an 80 on a scale of a one to a hundred i mean it's
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:39.840]  exponential and so they're gearing up for something big ironhead you want to stay on hold after jacari
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:44.080]  leaves us in about 10 minutes and come back with a comment on that yeah i do have one quick comment
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.320]  okay well stay there stay there then and then i promise it's just going to roll with your calls
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:55.200]  john i am it's a little blasphemous from florida adam phil and others hey we're all bad i'm not judging
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:04.880]  as protests over police brutality erupt across the nation i'm reminded of this passage from the
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:12.320]  capitalist conspiracy booklet written by g edward griffin in 1971 if those who seek world dominion
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:18.560]  can stimulate leftist mobs into violent confrontation with local law enforcement and also provide
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:24.880]  exhaustive news coverage so that the entire nation can see and tremble then the peaceful
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:30.880]  and freedom loving majority can be programmed to accept a vast expansion of government powers
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:37.280]  and even a national police force offered supposedly to end the violence we're witnessing that same old
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:43.200]  hegelian dialectic today by stimulating unrest and allowing it to spiral out of control the federal
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:48.800]  government can offer itself up as the solution sacrificing ourselves for the king's nefarious

[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:08.720]  passed the mark one million youtube subscribers without ever really promoting it on the alex
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:15.120]  jones channel one million youtube subscribers imagine if the one million subscribers on our
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:20.080]  youtube channel that has over 500 million views imagine if you picked out some of the most important
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:25.920]  videos of more than 30 a day we post and sent those to friends and family in email posted it
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:31.920]  to twitter and facebook the power of that is incredible we have i keep seeing 800 million but
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:39.280]  i'd forgotten that uh they had removed about a third of our views and the rest of youtube's
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:43.440]  a few years ago when sony got caught gaming the views they just took everybody's views
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:49.600]  away because of an advertising thing that i think is illegitimate by youtube but the point is
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.960]  that it's more like 700 800 million on our channel you add that to other channels we're well over a
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:01.760]  billion views on youtube right now even if you don't count the views they took away a billion
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:08.480]  views mcdonald says billions and billions served well we can say billions and billions served
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:14.560]  and that's one reason the system's upset and youtube is about 20 of our listeners in the metric
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.960]  but youtube's important because it hits people that would never see us
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:26.320]  but when you talk about talk radio baby uh on stations like ksco that's the number one station
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.160]  with many of its shows depending on what's time format uh there in the central coast area up into
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.360]  the edge of san francisco even shows up in the ratings in san francisco well they got two stations
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:44.240]  i mean their ratings are sometimes they've got 80 000 to 100 000 people tuning in well msnbc
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:50.800]  has 100 000 viewers or less on their average show i mean they're the mouse that roared
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:56.400]  we have over 180 affiliates big ones and little ones in places like chicago and
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:03.280]  rochester new york and uh we're back on again in orlando where we were number one against rush
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:08.000]  limbaugh it was in the news there that we beat rush limbaugh on a small station
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.520]  well the smallest 10 000 watts but compared to the station he was almost 50 uh it was a medium
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:18.800]  style station uh i mean we're having an effect and i'm not bragging about alex jones
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.720]  i'm saying freedom is popular like ron paul says let's legalize freedom again
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:31.040]  and when i see all these new people coming online all these new shows all these new people
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.960]  making great films i don't go oh my gosh competition look at those whipper snappers we
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:40.400]  got to get going crack the whip i'm like thank god we're not the only x-wings going in here
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:45.600]  there's swarms of them going against his death star it's very exciting and then if we can just
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:50.240]  stop the coantel pro from getting in there and manipulating and teaching them to end fight with
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:54.720]  each other uh because they'll test you say something bad about you trying to get you to fight
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.480]  don't do it just ignore it continue on the target get the ammo down range stay on target stay on
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:06.960]  target that is the key so very very exciting uh again briefly because the austin america
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.640]  statesman dallas morning news and over 30 publications that i had time to look at it's
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:16.000]  probably more than that the last three days have attacked the fact that we sell t-shirts water filters

[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:25.840]  street with the police officers directing traffic so yes there has been a high amount of tension
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:30.160]  but it seems like after the charges were brought today not the indictment but the charges on the
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:36.880]  six officers people are ready to try to begin a new beginning and move forward hopefully with a
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:42.160]  healthy relationship between the police and the people out here as far as the police presence
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:47.280]  it is overwhelming as officers walk behind me right now there are officers posted on every corner
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.480]  around here national guard posted a little bit down the street so they are ready in case anything
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.880]  should happen negatively but after the news we heard today of the multiple charges on the
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:02.240]  multiple officers i believe the highest charge was second degree murder i don't anticipate any
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.920]  large problems you know you could always have a contingent of people who want to come out here and
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:10.960]  do harm but as you can see the real people of baltimore are out here trying to have a healthy
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:16.720]  celebration alongside the police now as far as the walmart we had a chance to go to the other day
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.920]  as you were saying earlier alex you are correct within the city of baltimore they don't really
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.480]  sell guns and ammunition we call it a walmartness and no we don't sell guns or we don't sell ammunition
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:32.800]  within city limits so we had to go outside baltimore about 30 minutes to a walmart talked to him on the
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:37.520]  phone and we got there and you can see in the video the shells were stripped bare and i asked
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:41.360]  one of the gentlemen i said hey what's going on out here he said we had to take all the things
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:46.880]  off the shelves off the guns the knives in the bb guns the ammunition because in case the riots
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.760]  come out here we don't want to be caught with our pants down and have our our store ransacked now i
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:56.720]  can understand they don't want any type of looting to happen in their store but as far as people being
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.640]  able to protect themselves i wish they would at least had it set up we could walk up there and
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:04.880]  request you know a box of nine millimeter ammunition and they go retrieve it for you out there
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:10.880]  sure jacari what it shows is the default position that that you take the guns from the people and
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:14.880]  the right to self-defense you called you have the walmart representatives say over the phone the
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:22.320]  same thing that the representative tells you or partner they have some weird word for walmart
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:26.480]  workers what's it called partner thank you all right yes partners because they're not actually
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:32.000]  i guess employs some corporate legalese and they confirm this this shows what walmart's gonna do
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.600]  nationwide during civil unrest so folks need to have their guns their ammo their prep supplies
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:42.960]  ahead of that now i hear deafening honking going on jacari what's what's happening there is that part
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:47.680]  of the celebration oh yes there are people driving all the way up and down the street just a few
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.560]  minutes ago a very large military convoy rolled around here as well as you can see i've joked
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.840]  with these guys walking across the street they i don't know if they're doing shift changes
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:01.520]  but officers continue to move strongly throughout this area it's a huge celebration it's pretty much
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:08.000]  like a block party of sorts just with a bunch of police finding but you know it is a very much
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.800]  a celebration and everybody out here is so far is on their best behavior and i have every reason
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:19.040]  to believe that it's going to continue well jacari with the work you and and joe did going over the
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:23.440]  border i'm gonna run out of money giving you guys bonuses you're just doing a great job that was
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:29.120]  bigs and joes but me and bigs have done plenty no i know i'm saying you're up there in a dangerous
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:34.400]  situation as well so you guys are doing a fabulous job and you guys are a great team uh we've got uh
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:38.800]  joe bigs they're on camera and then you're on camera for him wonderful reporters that we salute
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:44.960]  your work take us out to break with any other observations jacari well we spin around and show
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:57.040]  the people more yeah what happened is they just the mic plug just came out of the camera i can
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:04.080]  tell i think some folks bumped into the mic cord it's all right check yeah that's good we got your
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:07.760]  audio we're gonna skip this break it's so important and then talk to the other five minutes and go
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:12.480]  back to ironhead john uh em and adam and fill in others i promise callers we're gonna go to you
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:16.800]  in just a moment so we're skipping the break jacari so you've got more time to pan around this is
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:23.360]  some pretty powerful skype video we're we're seeing here yeah we're gonna move a little bit
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:30.880]  around so you guys get more of a feel of the area like so this is pennsylvania avenue and west north
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:37.760]  avenue as you can see many people out here celebrating many people out here on the sidewalks
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:43.440]  as well uh there's uh i believe a minister down the street blasting over his loud speaker
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.840]  talking to the people many people getting interviewed he smiles no riots no looting no
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:55.120]  molotov cocktails just smiling happy people and i'm sure this is what they want to see in their
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:59.600]  communities you know they didn't like the the riots and the looting the things that happened
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:04.800]  here at the cvs they want their city to be represented as it is now people standing together
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:09.680]  in solidarity and yes this is a predominantly black neighborhood but you also have white people
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:13.920]  out here you have young people you have old people everybody's out here just trying to have a healthy
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:19.360]  time that's right a celebration a time of healing for the city of baltimore well we had photos and
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:23.840]  videos up in article yesterday what the media is not showing of people of all race colors and creeds
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:28.160]  coming together to try to block the looters and rioters only a few hundred of them that mainly
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:33.840]  came from other areas to take advantage of it as an excuse to rob and then we called them thugs and
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:39.520]  they claimed that was racist but even obama called them thugs and you know you've got thuggism
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:46.080]  throughout the culture period that has to be called what it is my concern is i think they
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.520]  would have indicted these cops if they really thought they were doing something wrong which
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.520]  they've now done they do that all the time i mean i see it every day where cops are getting
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:57.200]  indicted it's it's a dangerous job because if you use too much force and kill somebody you're
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:02.880]  probably going to get charged i'm concerned that people will think that looting caused these charges
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:08.960]  to come down i don't think the looting had anything to do with that jacari no i mean when
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:14.000]  the evidence came out we saw the press conference uh with the uh the prosecutor earlier today miss
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.520]  moseley most believe and she laid out all the charges everything from a second degree murder
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:24.560]  on down to manslaughter reckless endangerment all types of various charges so once the evidence
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.880]  came out and people could see that not only was this man arrested in a very harsh manner but the
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:35.040]  failure to render aid definitely contributed heavily to his demise and i'm glad that they
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:40.240]  had the foresight to really look into this and not just sweep it under the rug because this is
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:44.960]  not a situation where something under the rug would have been a good thing well being macho
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:49.200]  and tough doesn't mean you beat people to death and they don't give them aid uh that's not what
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:54.080]  being tough is being tough is when you actually get attacked taking somebody out uh but just
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:59.600]  beating up people in handcuffs or whatever is the ultimate cowardice and most police aren't like this
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:06.000]  but police departments are trying in many areas to recruit thugs uh and the feds i see are the ones
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.040]  behind it most of the time then they turn around and want to federalize is the answer now michael
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.760]  more came out and said the founding fathers said we had guns to protect ourselves from police
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:21.200]  let's disarm police we've got some of these bizarre tweets that's the final un model of a
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:28.080]  communist revolution is where they say disarm the police guns to the people uh he this is a what
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:32.800]  soros just did a year and a half ago in ukraine people are asking why is he saying we have guns
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:37.280]  to protect ourselves from government because they're now moving into the final equation if they
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:43.200]  can't take over and get our guns that way they'll use the guns to take over this is a very sickening
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:49.200]  statement by the snake that is michael more uh again next to man disarm the police we have four
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:54.240]  billion second amendment guns in our homes for protection we'll survive till the right cops are
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:59.280]  hired and then he goes on to basically call for revolution and stuff what do you make of him
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:06.560]  saying that michael more said that the filmmaker yes that's completely new to me uh michael more
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.640]  we know the guy has armed bodyguards and all this stuff and i think it's really more pandering to
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:14.960]  the audience i mean i don't know the guy personally but it just seems like a very convenient statement
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:19.520]  to make but you know as far as disarming the police i think we definitely need to retrain the police
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:24.800]  i think uh when we give these guys these big federally funded vehicles the m wraps and all that
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.720]  and then we say well the answer is more federalization it's federalization that gave these
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.800]  guys this equipment in the first place but if we could have more things like what we're seeing today
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:38.240]  the police co-mingling with the people yes you do have the SWAT teams and stuff on standby but you
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:43.280]  have the police captains and national guardsmen out here trying to talk peacefully to the people
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.240]  and treat them like they're human beings if we have more of that
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:53.440]  that's right we lost his mic again uh those those wireless systems are great or those wired
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:59.520]  systems sometimes they they they get unplugged well jacari jackson great job uh joe biggs is welcome
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:04.400]  later to pop in if he wants to uh in fact you can switch around if you want right now or you
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:10.240]  can interview joe biggs uh he can just aim the camera at the crowd ask his uh 90 second take on
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:17.040]  things okay we'll just do a quick switch right here again that's jacari jackson and joe biggs
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:22.560]  doing another fabulous job i love those guys they make a great team it's just so exciting as the
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:27.360]  leader of this organization to have these type of men uh involved with us because they just
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:32.400]  fearlessly get out there and kick butt and work so hard well joe uh you're going to get more hazard
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:38.880]  duty pay again great job you and jacari uh one of you guys planning to come home um so far it looks
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:44.000]  like sunday who knows i mean anything could change maybe later today tomorrow who knows but
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.800]  right now we know sunday but you know the thing to look at right now is a celebration going on
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:53.360]  you know a lot of people like you said earlier heard you say did looting caused this uh the
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:58.960]  charges to come down i don't believe so at all you know i think a thorough investigation was done
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:03.760]  they had some witnesses that came forward and were able to compile some evidence some compelling
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:08.000]  evidence to charge these guys and i think that the people are happy they got what they really
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.120]  wanted because deep down a lot of these people saw what happened they knew what happened was police
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:19.440]  brutality was wrong and that's a huge rampant problem in our country the fact that it's not it's
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.920]  not even something that starts at each individual substation or police station this starts with
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:29.040]  the training we have to change the way that we're training these young police officers
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:33.760]  who have up to like zero life experience when they come into police force never really used guns
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.720]  before never been in combat and don't know how to do anything and then you give them a gun you
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:42.800]  give them a badge and they don't know how to react well beyond that you've told me many times even
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.440]  though you were in iraq and afghanistan and taking prisoners a lot you didn't treat the public like
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:52.560]  this because you knew it would cause a vicious response yeah exactly i mean obviously when
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:57.680]  in combat you're gonna have an assault rifle but we always maintain weapon discipline what that means
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:04.240]  is keeping the the muzzle of the gun pointed downward as to show uh you know a decrease in force
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.720]  you know what they're doing out here is an increase in force it's almost like the same tactics
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:13.600]  that were used in falusion with the curfews the shoot first ask questions later mentality
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:19.760]  that's a mentality that has to stop in america with our police force we need to take a step back
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.320]  and go back to being peace officers absolutely listen i don't know if you guys have been working
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:28.640]  really hard i'm sure you probably had lunch or whatever but i this this celebration is big video
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:34.880]  i really want you guys as as is my final directive you can obviously cover whatever you want a
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:38.800]  target of opportunity i want you to interview the good the bad and the ugly i want you to interview
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:44.400]  the nice folks the the happy folks but also want to interview uh you know other people i want to show
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:52.960]  a full spectrum of people on the street uh during this celebration so uh go ahead and gets ready for
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:27:00.240]  that uh i want to get to some calls right now but uh please shoot a report uh of the celebration uh
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:08.160]  and what people uh have to say and what what they want roger that alex jones we copy because i see
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.680]  people coming up wanting to say things in fact let's just randomly ask folks why they're happy
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:17.680]  just going out to break them i'll come back to break and go to calls non-stop you talking so tell
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:21.920]  us uh how you're feeling today after you found out that the the six officers involved in this
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:28.080]  entire thing are going to be charged i i feel the same way truth be told i feel the same way
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:34.000]  feel happy you're glad uh mixed feelings man so what are the mixed feelings then uh mixed feelings
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  because of the charges they was they was they was less man they was real they was real small
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.800]  match compared to the whole situation if they said they're not supposed to be charged with
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.960]  first degree murder or premeditated murder but that was their attempt they had to attempt the
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:51.920]  harm this man you see what i'm saying so i don't understand why they just got something like that
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:58.320]  and volatility you have to shout out to kill go get out so a judge could get them probation or
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:01.520]  anything or let them explain to him that they couldn't get victim on that that they'd get off
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:07.600]  if they charged him too strong i'm a lifelong resident barmore city i've been through it all
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.840]  my life with police brutality man all my life you can check my record man it ain't nothing to brag
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:18.400]  about man but yeah it's bad man i almost died a couple times so so what do you think about this
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:23.360]  you know the charges are just a first step in this entire ordeal now what happens if they
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:28.480]  don't get indicted what do you think what's gonna happen with that well it's uh there's people
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:32.000]  already spoken man they already they already showed you what they're gonna do well i mean
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.600]  we saw we saw what happened with the michael brown case you know everyone without a shadow of doubt
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:42.000]  thought that officer was going to be indicted and then it didn't happen i mean do you think it's
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.520]  going to end up like that or no or do you think there's enough evidence to go through with an
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:55.920]  indictment yes yes yes i do yes i do i really do they're being indicted about you well i think that
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:06.320]  if they don't get indicted i think we'll have a a replay of what happened on monday on monday uh

[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:39.280]  they're making fun of the colonists the idiot haysees the people think we ride horses to work
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:46.640]  and all this crap you know nasa's based in texas i'm just so tired of the public's ignorance and

[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:39.360]  clips and a lot more ironhead you wanted to make another point that we're going to john
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:46.080]  em adam fill in others go ahead and it's the laughing over the cat in your bed so watch out
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:50.320]  well i'm sorry but you know my mother did have a cat when i was a kid that would like to crap on
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:54.880]  my bed and i and i and i didn't do anything the cat except spray with water guns so i don't know
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:37:00.720]  why i'm sorry go ahead i said deny thyself maybe in for the future we'll deny thy cat maybe i
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.480]  deserved it okay but i wasn't ever really mean to animals but i would squirt them with squirt guns
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:10.080]  as we go forward i'm trying to keep these thoughts in mind trying to take ourselves
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:15.440]  to the top of the capstone and there's a capstone one of the things neural linguistic programming
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:20.880]  keywords back going back to what i said about the meeting in tokyo when trump and all the world
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:26.960]  leaders there was again a g7 not a g10 when he sat in those meetings there was a obligatory
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:32.080]  stuff came out the media was dropped in two days well one hour was constantly mentioned
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:38.800]  i read some really fast revelation 1712 and the ten horns which thou saw start ten kings
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:44.640]  which have received no kingdom as yet but received power as kings one hour with the beast
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:49.680]  the thing we're missing there is an antichrist there is a man who has taken that position
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:55.120]  and that's who those world leaders thought within tokyo back in 2007 or 2008 the port
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:00.320]  bush left office and that's what i'm saying is that the pop of the capstone there is no
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:06.720]  country they're all under one umbrella and they all answer to i think putin has jumped the fans
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:11.440]  he has jumped the shark he has gone off the reservation the dead bed was a man in that meeting
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:18.160]  well the bible says that and then they blow up uh gog and may gog absolutely uh it's it's i tell
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:25.360]  you really study the bible it describes 10 mega regions that do not have a capstone because the
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:33.200]  world government's not official yet and when you go and now here's what's crazy the globalists have
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:40.880]  created 10 global regions under the un with three sub directorships over them three mega regions
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:45.920]  10 sub regions each country is broken into 10 regions this is globally not just the us just
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:52.320]  cut chills and then you go to the un they admit it's a luciferian right i was watching in 2000
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:57.280]  with a new millennium it was really 2001 but they call it 2000 and they were having world
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:05.920]  celebrations at giza with huge giant screens worshiping lucifer on pbs uh in latin and in
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:13.840]  arabic and in egyptian and you read the literature i mean these people are crazy they're actually
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:20.480]  following it and they believe lucifer's god and they are manifesting it and they believe it's a
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:25.360]  sacrifice when they put cancer viruses in the vaccines and don't give the trips care and abort
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:33.440]  50 million babies people say oh we're not satanists we've killed 55 million babies in this country
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:40.160]  alone it's incredible god bless you yeah it's it's it's it's amazing and even i want to explain
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:46.960]  something to atheists and agnostics and people there's a fake church and a bunch of rubes and
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:55.200]  boobs and fools out there and by the way somebody says don't use the word boob it's it's anti-family
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:40:00.080]  a booby means a stupid pirate i'm sick of the attack on language it's not just politically
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:05.440]  correct people that do it the so-called right wing makes every word bad and i'm tired i'm tired of it
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:12.160]  but i've used that word and gotten emails about it that's why in caddy shacks he says you know
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:19.360]  just like a couple of boobies that means pirate it's a it's a it's a it's a china c group of pirates
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:25.360]  but just like thug isn't racist it just means killer and it's a group of arabic
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.600]  raiders that operated for a thousand years and killed two million people is estimated but
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:35.200]  i digress there again i need to go to your calls what was i getting into there and i was about to
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:41.440]  break down um well just the bible it's just too incredible and but christ they said christ why do
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:47.600]  you speak in parables or or or or why is the old testament written where it's it's hard to
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:52.080]  understand he said because it's not meant for the profane to understand it basically
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:56.960]  but if you have eyes to see and ears to hear you look at it's like whoa
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:04.080]  oh man this is knowledge i mean i've read shakespeare i've read himingway i've read i've read it
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:10.080]  pretty much all i've read schultz and etson i've read atall fitler and i've never and that's
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:14.560]  my comp's not very well written by the way hitler actually wrote it you can tell uh
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:23.840]  and i've read nothing like the bible and you know some of the levitical stuff really is just rules
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:27.840]  it's right like the health department wrote it but other than stuff like that it's very profound
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:35.040]  let's go ahead and talk to john in texas john you're on the air welcome hi alex welcome
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:41.200]  yo alex uh that video with the police dog that was one of the most terrifying videos i've ever
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:46.080]  seen i think that that really i've seen somebody other one for this one really sort of maybe mad
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:53.280]  you know just you know i'm sorry i was i popped in their ear for a moment to ask them to get
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:56.800]  that video queued up in a news article on it to print me steve watson's article and bring it
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:03.440]  to me what what were you saying john i just said that video with a police dog attacked that guy
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:08.560]  yes one of the most terrifying videos i think i've seen on here for police brutality that was
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:15.520]  that was totally uncalled for that was really just you know it's pretty sick of me just well
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:19.840]  it's in utah they're going to bring the article into me i meant to get to that earlier uh i have
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:24.400]  trouble watching this because here's the deal i want to reform the police i don't hate them the
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:28.560]  globalists have trained them to do this they've protected them now they know the public's going
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:34.000]  to come after them that's how you cause a civil war and federalize it's it's a very simple equation
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.680]  and it makes people completely outraged they're sick of it and the answer police is not to militarize
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:48.320]  further uh and attack the public the answer is to reform yourselves and realize you've been set up
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.600]  and that's what it comes down to and to get good police chiefs and sheriffs in but they have this
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:58.480]  guy with his hands up doing nothing with the police dog attacking his neck trying to kill him
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:05.680]  and the cops let him do it in attempted murder and i would have attacked the dog and they would
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:10.800]  have killed me because i mean i instinctively cannot let a dog chew my face and it goes on
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:20.080]  and on and on with the dog chewing his face and his mouth and this is america and it's just like
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:24.480]  all the footage we've seen of the dead homeless guy they shoot uh in albuquerque
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:31.520]  and they you know they and then they let they let they let the dog chew on him and make fun of his
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:37.120]  body while he basically dies and does into convulsions and uses a bathroom on himself and
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:41.680]  the cop pulling up to that scene in albuquerque he goes i'm going to kill this guy that's why he
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:47.120]  got indicted and is in is in trial right now uh these are mentally ill people and we need to get
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:51.600]  the mentally ill cops off the police forces right now but anything else you'd like to add to this
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:58.400]  report well just i know that studying history the german guards and the concentration camp
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:02.240]  soviet guards they always had police dogs when they got up when the prisoners got off the train
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:06.640]  they were there were the police dogs but the dogs chew on them and and it's just a playbook right
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:10.480]  out of that it's just you know and the youth that we wear the curtsle helmet the whole nine yards
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:15.360]  let me continue video cops break down door without warrant sick dog on man with hands up
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:18.640]  rabbit footage has emerged of cops in utah entering a man's home without a warrant
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:22.720]  and setting a canine dog on him despite the fact he was surrendering with his hands in the air
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:27.600]  the video taken from police body cam was released she didn't think this is wrong
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:33.360]  as he could have killed a guy chewed his neck and ripped his lower lip off as part of a lawsuit
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:38.160]  filed against the west jordan police department by lee huggable it who was visually attacked
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:42.800]  with a dog i want to get him on and his lawyer guys go after him and then he lays there bleeding
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:48.960]  with his throat and arteries torn open and face torn off and and this is the reign of terror tyrants
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:53.840]  always think that a reign of terror uh is the oh my god i can't even really look at this
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:57.600]  that a reign of terror is the way to go then they wonder how people start fighting back
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:03.920]  and look it's all part of the plan do you think we can avert the civil war well john just hung up
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:09.680]  eam in florida i'm sorry i thought he was calling himself i am eam in florida thanks for holding
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:17.520]  you're on the air well thanks for pronouncing it right it is eam and uh uh alex i mean that that
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:22.800]  caller leading up to me it's perfect because you know i i hesitate to call it's the fifth time in
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:28.560]  10 years and the only thing that hasn't changed in 10 years because so much has is the fact that i
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:32.560]  use my name you know i'm calling from the beach here in the town in florida that i grew up in
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:38.640]  on a cell phone with no vpn i'm not scripted i don't write down uh you know what i'm going to
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:45.200]  talk about just like you you're legit and unscripted and and that's my preface to just kind of i have
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:50.800]  two points to raise but real quickly you know my heart races more than any woman i've met in my life
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:56.000]  or anything when i call into this show and it's because all of this is very real and it's you
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:01.600]  know the question in my heart is what's next you know and exactly that's why i'm so desperate running
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:08.960]  around like a chicken with my head cut off because man we're descending into evil go ahead believably
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:16.320]  intensified global rise you know against all of us and i'm not a veteran i'm not an active duty i
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:20.560]  don't have a cache of weapons i'm just trying to raise my son and do a good job in life but
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:25.920]  because i can articulate the knowledge i have you know to the hordes of schmitties out there with a
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:34.160]  a totally uh uh inept intellectual mindset you know trained be that way uh just because i can do
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:40.640]  that i am the enemy i am the threat to this march towards a un nato world army right i mean that's
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:47.840]  it you recognize what's in your face you don't want to be a slave therefore you're evil yeah and and
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.880]  so what is next am i why do i not want to call in why does my heart pound as i'm on hold for 40
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:57.920]  minutes and why can't i i even get to my two points and i have to explain this i know my soul
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:02.080]  is what calls me to call you because this show is real and we are on the tip of most of what's
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:07.440]  going on around the world and but your flesh wants to live in denial and just enjoy itself and
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:14.320]  ignore what's happening not the denial i want to lay my knowledge and my ability to articulate it down
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:21.440]  to the feet of of of the ridicule that's been trained into these hordes of schmitties out there
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:26.080]  but to my point alex i mean all i'm raising is that what are they going to come scoop me up in
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:30.240]  the middle of the night because i don't hide who i am when i call you no no no no we're actually
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:35.200]  winning the average cop is waking up the average bureaucrats waking up there's just pockets of bad
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:41.280]  people being protected by the globalist we are on the verge of actually overturning a lot of this
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:47.440]  we need to go through our fear and realize that all of us collectively george arwell said the new
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:51.040]  world order of the system you're going to live under is a boot stomping on the human face forever
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:57.360]  well no it's not it's a police dog chewing on your children's necks forever uh while you
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:04.320]  have total control christlike knowing you'll be killed putting your hands down and letting a wild
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:10.640]  animal that thirst for blood chew your throat and face off i mean i i mean no one i've ever heard
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:15.600]  of can put their hands down and let a dog but he knew they were going to kill him so he he saw
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:21.040]  preservation focused i mean that's like beyond dune where he's got to stick his hand in the pain
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:25.760]  induction vice and it's frying i mean this is real a dog's ripping your lips off ripping your
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:31.360]  throat open with enjoyment for a minute and and and he just sits there with the cops hoping he moves
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:37.200]  so they can kill him yelling at him uh we ought to play with the audio later and he just christlike
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:41.680]  takes it i'm not saying he's a perfect person the point is without a warrant they come in that
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:48.640]  is the new world order i mean can you believe that footage alex i can't i can't believe it and back
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:52.800]  to my point and i watched it several times it disgusts me i mean i'm one of those people who's
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:58.080]  able to stare at the most disgusting things in the world so i watched the beheadings as much as
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:03.200]  you know makes me viscerally unable to eat for a day but i do i stare at it i went through the
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:08.800]  the the purge of feeling accountable for all the things i hid from before i woke up eight years ago
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:15.040]  but back to my point is is honestly the fusion center locally even they're listening and if
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:19.040]  they're doing their job which i believe they are you know they're listening and so if they were to
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:22.960]  scoop somebody up like me before i get to my two points real quick my fear you know i want to be
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:28.160]  there for my son you're gonna be scooped up by the beast system if you don't fight it and change
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:33.040]  it create a community to to resist it by by having your own infrastructure we're going to break
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:39.440]  i gotta go to adam and phil make your two points well the two points quickly all of the little
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:44.080]  commercials that all your staff are making in real time for us each day on point i can't find

[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.520]  you'll have trouble getting that conviction that charge may be too high and i don't mean
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:50.720]  in reality too high i mean in the courts the same checks and balances that protect you and i
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:58.640]  protect the police and there's not video it's all confused if they went for murder one they'd
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:04.000]  have to have proof of the cops meeting in secret and deciding to go out and kill this guy they
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:12.160]  obviously didn't do that it's manslaughter and that's going to be hard to prove i'm talking
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:16.640]  about how courts actually work not how people want them to work let's talk to adam in canada
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:22.240]  you're on the air go ahead hi alex thanks for having me back thanks for holding brother i
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:27.520]  appreciate you go ahead absolutely i wanted to verge from our conversation yesterday and talk about
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:35.200]  jade helm you know i think that um the chance of them dropping a false flag is greatly diminished
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:42.400]  by the spotlight of alex jones and kudos on getting a habit your governor there to shine the
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:48.240]  spot well i want to be clear it's not me i'm kind of like the switch in the machine of the of the
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:53.680]  spotlight the listeners are what made the phone call sent our articles out went to bass drop went
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:59.040]  to public events called the governor it's the listeners that did it absolutely and you guys
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:04.400]  and you do have some you know rabid followers uh i have been a great fan of yours for many years
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:08.240]  uh we just see things a little bit differently but getting back to jade helm
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:14.000]  i think the only way that they would successfully be able to um engage the jade helm operatives
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.680]  during a false flag would if it was a huge one uh race riots across multiple cities uh
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:24.240]  a bio attack an economic collapse sure and they'd have to have the military pre deployed
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:29.920]  to ever respond it takes too much time to move that into place that's why these drills are dangerous
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:35.280]  because the military doesn't know it could go live but i believe it could go live the the more i see
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:40.240]  the way they're freaking out about it shows we hit a nerve we cover all these drills why are they
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:46.400]  freaking out about this one well this is the largest one that's happened in in in you know in
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:51.040]  in the last 10 years apparently this is the largest one that's ever happened on american soil
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:55.920]  and i think you're right i think it is a dangerous precedent to allow these types of acts uh these
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:02.480]  types of exercises to occur in in the community they do have huge swaths of land uh allocated
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:07.200]  for the military for hood is the size of like three or four dialysis i mean the military
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:12.720]  has huge bases they're basically occupying major trailheads around the country permanently
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:17.920]  searching packers i mean this is all about acclimating the public thank you adam but the
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:22.480]  media's spinning it that we hate the military that's how dumb i think the public is no we hate
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:30.480]  the orders they're being given phil in baltimore you're on the air hello yes phil go ahead thank
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:40.240]  you for holding hey no problem there alec where we're going go ahead i just want to get on i
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:44.560]  just want to get on the whole thing with what's been going on up here in baltimore because it's
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:52.000]  just been ridiculous seeing these humbees and stuff driving around and i watch the news a lot
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:58.560]  and i'm sitting here they're talking about all the stuff going on down on north avenue in pennsylvania
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:06.160]  but they have not once mentioned the shots fired or the cop getting stabbed down in the brooklyn area
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:12.960]  well i think they've had like 25 police wounded a couple of them shot stabbed yeah
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:16.400]  the media is not covering that and that's the thing the police are being attacked
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:21.200]  that's going to make them either quit or get ramped up to start acting crazy because i mean
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:25.120]  believe me i couldn't be a cop i mean if i was in these bad neighborhoods dealing with all this
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:32.560]  craziness uh constantly i would end up going you know very aggressive uh maybe that's why you
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:37.680]  don't need people like me to be in bad areas as a police officer i mean it takes like a social
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:43.280]  worker type to uh be able to not go crazy in situations that are really stressful i mean
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:48.400]  i grew up in dalis and i went and i went into bad areas sometimes and it's it's pretty scary and
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:52.720]  let me tell you go in the wrong poor white area in east texas you'll get shot at too as well
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:55.920]  stay there i want to come back to you phil you finish your point then we're gonna get an update
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:05:02.160]  from jacari jackson and joe bitch the reporters committee for freedom of the press and eight news
[02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:06.480]  media organizations have formed a coalition to demand that a federal court in north carolina
[02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:11.600]  unseal a senate sing memorandum and related letters in the case of david patrice the court
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:16.560]  document says the public has an especially strong interest in obtaining a full understanding
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:22.320]  but what did patrice leak seven black books that contained classified information regarding the
[02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:28.000]  identities of covert officers war strategy intelligence capabilities quotes and deliberative
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.880]  discussions from high-level national security council meetings but compare patrice's punishment
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:40.080]  to what john kiriyaku a cia officer who exposed the cia's illegal torture program got the whistleblower
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:45.440]  got two years in jail for exposing government crime but the general who exposed information
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:50.720]  that really could have hurt national security got a fine equivalent to 75 percent of what he gets
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:56.320]  paid for a single speech and not two years in prison but two years probation for info wars dot

[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:26.560]  were covering at the john bird society since the 60s people would go to the library they'd go to
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:31.200]  congress they would go to the national archives they didn't believe me that public law on the
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:38.560]  books 87-297 calls for an incremental program by the year 2000 which they're behind on to disarm
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:45.360]  all police all citizens except for a un peacekeeper force to be in every u.s city well the story is
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:51.440]  up on info wars dot com right now by kit daniels did you know a law is on the books to disarm all
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:57.440]  americans law provides impetus for ultimate world disarmament and un control over the military only
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:03.520]  the un can be armed because they're not for war they're the peace army lay down your arms we are
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:10.560]  here to help so on the books since 61 and i and just ask kitty did a great job putting this out
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:15.840]  real fast when i asked him to start the show having just go to the actual manual and show
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:21.840]  screenshots of the u.s military getting smaller the helmet's getting smaller and the un helmet's
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:26.320]  getting bigger where we're disarmed and then they occupy because because folks are in the
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:30.560]  comments going is this real we've got links to congress links to everything but look at the
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:38.720]  document camp if you're a tv viewer authenticated u.s government information gpo it even has a seal
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:50.640]  on it from the original past title one public law 87-297 september 26 1961
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:58.560]  yes this is real and they said the foreign policy is the total disarmament of our military
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:03.920]  our police and our citizens with a national stability force run by the un and that's the
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:09.040]  ran corporation plan that comes out a decade later and is updated yearly and is public
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:15.600]  to put troops on every street corner it doesn't matter if they have 360 something news articles
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:24.720]  a day saying i'm a liar 360 yesterday it's over 100 a day saying i'm a liar hoping they can pray on
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:31.120]  you hoping you're stupid hoping you're lazy hoping you just won't check me out i'm not lying about
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:37.760]  anything do i make mistakes sometimes you better believe it i don't want a civil war i don't want
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:43.840]  the new protest to shoot cops that the the soros affiliated groups are pushing i know the cops are
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:48.320]  doing horrible stuff in some areas because of the training and what's happened it's been designed
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:54.480]  inner of psychological mental spiritual virus into the country that brings us down
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:11:00.000]  and it's here everything we warned you about you can just see us marching into it
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:06.320]  the good news is people a lot of people know what's happening and for every bad department
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:11.760]  of crazy goons that like to sick dogs on this person's face like we just showed last hour
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:18.640]  that's on info wars dot com the cops i talked to around the country are probably one of the
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:26.000]  biggest groups of awake people military first then police the problem is they're not in control
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:30.480]  and the higher you go up in the most of these departments the more political and the worse
[02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:34.640]  it gets you find out your police chief is getting awards from the southern property law center in
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:44.720]  the adl of the most made up degenerate false lying slanderous basically msnbc talking points
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:49.920]  the same one's cheering on the cops being indicted and it's the cops and if we just
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:55.840]  bring the local cops down that's how we'll have revolution you won't fix it just blaming the police
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:12:00.880]  you know what rolls down hill that's my point yeah after we've arrested the globalist and the
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:05.760]  clintons and kicked out the federal reserve and cut taxes and restored our power plants and
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:11.120]  gotten clean vaccines and got the floor out of the water after we've done all that
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:17.840]  but if we want to have some big cleanup of bad police department sure but you're not gonna fix
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:25.360]  things shooting cops or protesting or yay cop six cops been indicted yay
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:32.160]  it's just it's being directed by michael more and george soros that's all i'm saying
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.520]  and now there'll be more of these shootings and some will be real some won't some will be
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:43.520]  bad cops some won't like the brown case some will be 50 50 zimmerman you know acting foolish but
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:48.400]  also the other guy being a you know out of control black witnesses said he was bouncing out on the
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:57.120]  ground i mean i'll be honest with you i wasn't a thug when i was growing up but i was mean
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:01.040]  and if some guy was walking through the park i live somewhere some guy walk up with a gun and
[02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:06.880]  pointed at me i had a problem i might have done what he did i might have got killed in fact i don't
[02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:10.160]  want to tell these stories because they sound just too ridiculous but i mean you know true
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:17.840]  straight fiction i've had people pull guns on me twice but both times they were thugs and i just
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:23.040]  think my lucky stars i'm still alive oh my god the things i did i was not trained to take guns
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:34.480]  away from people but i still just did it and um one time two guys on a country road we're going
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:41.440]  out to pick up some girlfriends in another town me and a friend mark and this guy got right upon
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:47.040]  our tail mark put on his brakes the guy swung around almost hit us pulled in front slammer's
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:55.680]  brakes mark gets out these two guys get out and they've got deer rifles and mark just charges up
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:14:01.040]  takes starts taking a rifle away the other guy takes it with the barrel with the sight on it and
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:06.880]  puts it in his head and rips it open so it's bleeding and i kicked the guy in the chest knocking
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:11.680]  down and the guy goes that's it i'm pulling the trigger and i said go ahead and murder me you
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:16.160]  coward or put the gun down and stand up fight the guy just let us get out of here and they
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:22.160]  got in their car and drove off so i can't really sit there and talk about
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:31.120]  trevon martin because the difference is though it was raining he was i get young people wear
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:34.480]  hoodies people see somebody creeping around a hoodie it looks suspicious looking at things we
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:38.000]  don't know the truth what happened but but it's hard to judge each side of that and i'm and i'm
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:41.680]  now digressing there was another time somebody pulled a gun on me and i'm not even going to tell
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:50.800]  that story uh but let's just say thank god my children are being raised in austin instead of
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:54.720]  dallas texas and i can tell you now austin's becoming more like dallas where i grew up
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:58.560]  and with it the cops are going to get more out of control because it's going to be a
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:04.320]  hellish job i would not want their job i mean i you either get out of it in a bad area or you
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:08.880]  go crazy and i've known people i mean i grew up working every summer for a large animal vet and
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:13.840]  then i was kicked out of school for fighting when i was 16 for 12 months or about 11 months i worked
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:19.360]  for a large animal vet and i got these big giant industrial beef farms where the cows were wild
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:23.520]  they were out on grass and they got vaccinated every few years but were wild they weren't like
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:28.640]  more domesticated cows big you know big beef ranches basically what that produced hamburger
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:34.240]  meat not steaks that's the kind of meat uh it's really healthy meat and uh there'd be 500 cattle
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:37.680]  in each one of these big pins sometimes a couple thousand we had to go through in a day and i'd
[02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:41.840]  watch all these cowboys pull up who are the real deal he never sees people on tv they'll make a
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:46.800]  reality tv show but nobody can watch it and they would get all hyped up like like coyotes or something
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:51.280]  chasing and and like go out there for like 12 hours they had to pay them a lot by the way or
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:55.360]  they wouldn't get them to get real cowboys up there usually like we're hauling gravel part-time
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:58.960]  or owned a few dump trucks and we're really crazy i'm not gonna tell all the stories man you can
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:05.520]  make a movie about it i mean these guys were the real deal i guess i could i'd see it's not family
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:09.760]  oriented i can't tell any of it and man they'd sit there and go you little wimp you think you're
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:17.840]  dug in it and they were just in there electric dehorners you know just like real cattle prods
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:23.120]  not hot shots in there with wild cattle if you didn't say keep them intimidated they overran you
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:29.440]  immediately um very dangerous people got killed all the time i never saw you about get killed
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:32.960]  but the vet i worked for had almost been killed and a lot of guys couldn't do any more because
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:38.400]  they'd been hurt uh it's a very macho job and the same thing happens with police you just get
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:43.920]  fired up in these bad areas and it's and then you become what you think you're fighting there i've
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:46.480]  given you some psychology behind that why i have an understanding of it
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:56.720]  i mean sometimes those guys were so macho those cowboys that when i was first doing it a few
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:00.560]  summers they had me working mainly at ranches and then i got put in working for the actual
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:07.200]  large animal vet that did the big industrial stuff and you'd have a full-sized steer and i'd
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:10.720]  be in there with a bunch of them and jump over a fence when they rammed into the wall or something
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:14.480]  go you're gonna get killed you little blaper acting like that you're gonna get in like this
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:19.440]  and just run over like something six foot four guy go like 45 years old go just grab a full
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:24.240]  steer and with by the horns and flop it over the ground and go that's what you do you little
[02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:28.160]  wimp i bet you think you're tough down here fighting the dollars i won't beat your ass right
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:34.400]  now they were like worse than drill sergeants i mean that's the kind of stuff i've seen
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:39.360]  i guess that's where i come from that's why i'm i'm just telling you folks that's where
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:44.320]  all this is coming from and it's going to blow up in a civil war and it's not a good situation
[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:47.680]  phil and baltimore thanks for holding so long you're on the air go ahead

[02:17:56.720 --> 02:18:03.280]  yeah like it's it's just gotten crazy the night after their original riots all the stuff over
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:09.840]  in brooklyn started happening haven't seen anything and then i've been watching on uh twitter and
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:16.400]  everything and a bunch of my friends of ours had been talking about it saying that if that the
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:22.640]  indictments don't go through and if they're acquitted how monday's want to seem like nothing
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:29.440]  compared to what's coming and that's got me wanting to get me my daughter out of baltimore for a while
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:37.200]  well i tell you you notice it's all these so-called liberal cities where this is going on
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:41.760]  i don't know if it's going to be this summer the next summer this country's unsustainable
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:46.080]  of a hundred million people on welfare it's a thug culture in all the groups that's growing
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:49.760]  including the cops this country's going under judgment brother that's my view
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:59.920]  yeah and it is it's definitely hard here like trying to find a job it's even i know people

[02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:28.000]  now joe biggs and jacarie jackson join us from baltimore maryland the scene of the last week's
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:33.520]  globalist extravaganza and the police stand down now six police indicted what are the
[02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:39.920]  latest developments joe biggs and jacarie jackson roger that joe biggs here and occupied baltimore
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:46.240]  north and pin where right now we have a convoy of umby uh moving into a formation right now there
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:51.280]  is a huge military presence and one of the key things to note here is if we get a look at some
[02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:56.720]  of the magazines on these weapons they actually have the magazines in place today um the other
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:01.680]  day we saw them they had no magazines in the wells whatsoever today they actually have them inside
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:06.560]  so whether or not they're locked and loaded i don't know but they've definitely uh the images
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:12.480]  change on how they're presenting themselves out here to the public today well you had said that
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:18.800]  you hope that they don't reescalate like you saw in ferguson talk about that well the thing with that
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:23.760]  is i don't think it's gonna happen now based off the fact that they've come down with charges but
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:28.560]  here's the key thing though this is only a first step in the entire process like we said before
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:33.280]  they still have to decide whether or not they will indict these officers and if it comes down to the
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:38.320]  fact that they they go through a whole bunch of hearings and decide not to indict then it's going
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:44.080]  to be that vacuum that then that's when baltimore will be ten times worse than this previous monday
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:49.840]  you know this is a much bigger city than ferguson this has a much more dynamic crowd of people uh
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:55.200]  a lot more area to cover so hopefully something like that doesn't happen but if it does i'm sure
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:26:02.800]  we'll be back out here covering that again as well other observations go well so far everyone
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:08.560]  we've talked to is extremely happy about what's happened today with the six officers being charged
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:15.120]  now a few people aren't so happy that they didn't all get the highest charge possible you know but
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:19.360]  obviously not everybody was involved as much as another officer would be but i think at the end
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:24.000]  of the day most people know that some people are going to go to jail in this entire ordeal
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:29.360]  and that's kind of enough they fill for justice to make a statement fit for the rest of america
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:33.920]  that justice can be served and that police brutality is being brought to the forefront of
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:39.280]  america's minds and they're actually seeing this stuff finally for what the people of baltimore
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:48.320]  have seen their entire lives it really is surreal to see uh the national guard in full combat gear
[02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:54.320]  with loaded magazines uh deploying and one of them is about to walk right up we'll see
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:59.120]  me tries to get you to move uh this is uh he is honking at you this is really over the top let's see
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:03.440]  if he tries to order you out of the way let's see what happens here uh jr maybe you can talk to him
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:08.080]  here in a second but uh do you feel like you're back in iraq or have you understand yeah it's a
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:13.280]  little weird being on the other end now you know i'm used to being up on uh the up armored vehicle
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:18.000]  and now i'm down here and the street is actually seen from that side well that's good he didn't
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:22.160]  act like thug cops do sometimes he uh just got out of your way went to the other side instead of
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:27.840]  ordering around let's see if uh how's the military been acting i i think you said earlier pretty polite
[02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:32.960]  yeah so far they've all been pretty polite they know that their place here is not a number one
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:38.960]  in priority when it comes to uh dealing with the crowds and any kind of civil disobedience
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:44.240]  whatsoever they know that they're here more if worst-case scenario happens they're back up
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:48.720]  so they know their role they've been playing it pretty well but you know like i said it's really
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:53.920]  awkward people when they watch tv they think that that the curfew means that just people
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:58.320]  have to go home know what what this means is this isn't like ferguson where there was a curfew for
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:06.240]  that area that specific area in the uh st louis area all of baltimore is essentially locked down
[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:10.640]  come eight o'clock you cannot go to a restaurant at night jacarria and i tried to go have dinner
[02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:14.880]  last night we had to beg the cook to keep the line open just a little bit longer so we could
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:19.360]  actually eat something you can't do anything eight o'clock comes they shut it down then 10 o'clock
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:23.760]  comes you can't be on the roads you can't be out if you are you're subject to arrest the
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:29.840]  helicopters are flying in the air given orders the cops are out the the military is out this is
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:36.720]  a complete and total war zone so to say and how it's an occupied country well it makes me think
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:42.960]  of the gentleman they offer a piece that he put out with ice tea like 25 years ago where he simulates
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:50.400]  martial law and the announcement being made stay in your homes anyone caught outside their sector
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:57.680]  after dark will be shot i mean it's just ridiculous that this continues to happen and it all came out
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:04.320]  of a stand down with a couple hundred thugs burning and and and shooting when they just
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:09.200]  should have arrested them and if they resisted shot them and and then you'd had no more thugs ever
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:15.280]  anywhere doing this instead they've escalated it now and now it looks like looting is what made
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:18.720]  the cops get indicted when it probably would already happen it's like the cop that shot
[02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:22.640]  the guy in the back he's already been indicted most of the time they get indicted the reason
[02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:26.080]  the cops didn't get indicted with the brown situation it's because the witnesses came out
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:34.000]  and he charged him in attacking Joe want to come back to you with some final comments amazing
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.640]  but i want to during the video feed during the break let's just keep keep the camera going Joe

[02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:16.080]  our country is falling apart because people have forgotten to fight to stand up in the face of tyranny

[02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:38.160]  martial law announcement we should do a more focused serious one i'm not knocking the fact
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:42.960]  there's some humor in there ourselves to announce what martial law could look like in a simulated
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:47.600]  newscast they do that for anthrax attacks or whatever it's totally legitimate to do will
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:50.480]  be attacked for doing it of course because it's so effective but well i'm going to do that next
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:53.920]  week i want that put on the board i'm going to develop it i'm going to write it with you guys
[02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:58.160]  we're going to do it going back for final comments from joe bigs and jacari jackson
[02:35:58.160 --> 02:36:03.040]  from baltimore we'll talk to otto and others that are holding uh joe i noticed the humvees have
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:08.960]  rolled out to another location other points that you need to make yeah like i said uh if you can
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:13.440]  see everybody's starting to gather all through here alex and wherever we are again in the north of
[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:19.360]  bed this has been the focal point for protests over the last week over here to my right as a cvs
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:25.760]  party so that everyone saw on tv this is the one that was looted and burnt down people have been
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:31.040]  gathering out here all day peacefully protesting the cops have kind of held back they're more
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:35.440]  helping to regulate the traffic flow in and out of this intersection so far there's a
[02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:40.880]  larger presence of military down the road a couple hundred yards that way you've got fire trucks up
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:48.720]  there the m-wraps uh seven humvees or so a couple lm tv zeppel tv's and uh swap vehicles as well
[02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:53.440]  so there's a large presence here but what they've done so far they're lining a lot of the businesses
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:58.080]  we have a look over here a lot of the police officers are lining the businesses around
[02:36:58.080 --> 02:37:03.840]  the corners of the intersection on all sides of the road so that's what's going on right now
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:07.840]  people are driving up and down the whole uh the roads clunking their horns much like
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:12.800]  happened in berguson we were there people hanging outside of the windows screaming shouting
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:17.600]  waving flags through the air and you can see uh there's people walking around with an american
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:22.800]  flag over here waving it people are just celebrating because they knew the one was done they knew
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:27.040]  that freddy kray was murdered and everybody here feels like they've gotten adjusted that they want
[02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:36.720]  so far in this healing process in Baltimore i noticed burned out businesses across the street
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:42.080]  right there i see a burned out cvs yeah that's the cvs that we uh we saw on june we'll go over here
[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:46.960]  and look but you gotta see what's going on and again he has a directional mic folks it's just
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:51.280]  deafening when loud out there i'd imagine you're getting sick of the sound of horns
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:38:03.600]  all right well joe bigs thank you so much
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:13.440]  any other points you'd like to make joe uh so far what we're going to do we're just going to go
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:19.120]  around talk to people ask people what they feel about the decision to charge these officers
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:23.120]  and see how people feel if there's any mixed emotions so far there's no negative feelings
[02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:27.600]  obviously towards it because this is we're right in the middle of their neighborhood this is where
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:32.720]  it happened all the people here are extremely happy about the charges being brought upon the
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:36.880]  officers everyone at this point is just praying for an indictment we'll see what happens it takes
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:41.920]  time all right well the justice department's obviously in there manipulating the whole thing
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:46.640]  thank you so much yo bigs thank you alex does jacari have any other points you'd like to make
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:52.960]  no all right well you guys get those interviews and then if you want you we're gonna stay till

[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:06.960]  activity there though i'm gonna be a new hotspot though and we'll continue to track this because
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:11.680]  there's a long hot summer coming up and they're predicting a real summer of flames
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:30.480]  well the new hobby needs to be not rioting with the police it needs to be peacefully
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:34.800]  demonstrating and and trying to get our bill of rights back and most of folks are trying to do

[02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:35.200]  anyway uh i read an article yesterday i live here in victoria of texas and um on this jade helm
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:42.000]  it said a realistic military training canceled in crossroads and uh i guess it says that the uh
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:47.840]  controversial jade helm is expected to be in this summer will not take place victoria and golead
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:52.800]  counties the victoria county sheriff's office confirmed wednesday and i guess uh back in
[02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:56.400]  december they had another article said that it was going to be here i'm not sure how i know a lot
[02:42:56.400 --> 02:43:02.240]  of the citizens are here asking a lot of questions and i'm not sure how i got canceled in these
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:10.160]  counties but just what the article said really say that again you're saying uh oh there it is
[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:15.520]  victoria advocate realistic military training canceled in crossroads oh please print that out
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:22.000]  that's big news uh breaking yesterday a lot of towns i know we're cutting it back because it was
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:27.120]  going to be snatched and grabbed gun confiscation we've seen this in arcadia iowa and all over the
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:32.480]  drills we could read the documents and tell that was going to be peppered in there um but yeah there's
[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:38.640]  a big big backlash against this and that's good because we're not against the troops we're against
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:44.080]  the globalists trying to condition us to accept being occupied by them and that's why the public
[02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:52.480]  knows something's afoot everybody senses that the other day i was pulling out onto the road and you
[02:43:52.480 --> 02:43:58.080]  can't really see where i live when cars are coming but they don't come very often and i thought i better
[02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:03.040]  look both ways be really safe and some car was like speeding came shooting by there was a car
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:07.200]  parked out there i couldn't see it and i would have been hit but it's kind of that six cents
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:12.800]  and people see the signs they feel it we don't know exactly what's going to happen but we
[02:44:12.800 --> 02:44:20.640]  don't trust anything this occupied government's saying auto no i agree i think the people around
[02:44:20.640 --> 02:44:24.320]  here are definitely i know a lot of the citizens and people have talked to around here everyone kind
[02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:28.160]  of was aware of it even since fact of December because there's another article saying that you
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:32.000]  know if you saw anything you're supposed to report it because it was supposed to be a failure and then
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.080]  when the stuff broke about jade helm everybody kind of put two and two together i guess that was
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:40.000]  probably the same thing and then well sure and they're they're creating citizen spies to spy on
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:46.240]  the tea party i mean you're not on drug dealers or or or a hobbyist but there's the article i'll
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:50.000]  read part of it thanks for bringing it to our attention a controversial special operations
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:54.880]  realistic training expected to begin this summer will not take place in victoria and golead counties
[02:44:54.880 --> 02:45:00.720]  the victoria sheriff's department said uh after the exercise in the release of an unclassified
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:05.280]  document labeling both texas and utah is hostile theorists began to question whether the realistic
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:11.040]  exercise on his jade helm was a preparation for martial law but see implying we were saying it's
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:17.360]  going to happen no of course it's preparation uh chief deputy roi boyd told the advocate in
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:22.160]  december the us army operations command chose the crossroads because victoria and golead
[02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:27.680]  counties offered an ideal terrain and then it just goes on uh they would not offer any details about
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:35.840]  why it was canceled okay thank you so much caller rich in new york thanks for holding hey alex how
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:41.200]  you doing man good brother all right alex what we have here is uh the gothels bridge is a bridge
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:49.360]  that connects new jersey to statin island new york and apparently go on si live dot com there's going
[02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:55.600]  to be uh drills between i think it's one in eight or something like that the military is doing drills
[02:45:55.600 --> 02:46:04.400]  on this bridge really and and again where is that located exactly okay that's located that is the
[02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:09.760]  one of the bridge connecting bridges between new jersey and statin island new york like i said si
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:14.480]  live if you go on that si live dot com it says something about it there like people need to
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:19.200]  know about this they need to get out there you know and we need to uh monitor this like monitor
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:27.040]  everything else well absolutely it's just gotten bonkers crazy uh how much of this
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:32.880]  crud is going on and again it's i don't have a way to have a metric but i've been following this
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:39.040]  for 20 years really 18 intensely but i've been falling for 20 and on a scale of 1 to 100 it's
[02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:43.040]  gone from like a one or two and it was still illegal unconstitutional we had government
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:47.520]  documents that it was about conditioning the public to accept it so so we knew the plan
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:53.680]  so i was freaked out about it now it's like an 80 uh you know from a one or two i mean it's just
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:59.040]  everywhere and then you learn they've got infra guard clergy response spy teams federalized
[02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:05.520]  police all this gear and they're training with attack dogs and machine guns and robots and armored
[02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:11.520]  vehicles and surveillance and kill switches and their own cell phone grids i mean it's like a
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:18.880]  manhattan project times a hundred it's just a huge giant submerged tyranny that's starting to rise up

[02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:43.280]  nice to do that right now to just be able to do treasonous treasonous acts should be it should
[02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:47.440]  be answered well i'll say this they deserve a jury trial we need to take the country back
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:51.840]  and then we need to have the trials and we need to give them jury trials and when people have done
[02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:57.520]  open treason against the country uh they need to be sent to prison for life we'll be right back

[02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:16.640]  but right out of time today is mayday it's known as a communist holiday but the communist
[02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:23.120]  were a cultist it goes back to the druids there were human sacrifices made on mayday but also
[02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:27.600]  flower festivals a lot of other stuff that's basically what mayday is and notice obama always
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:34.640]  makes a bunch of big announcements on mayday as if communism is for the people but communism comes
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:41.360]  out of the jackabins in france in the illuminati that's in mainline history books it's an ancient
[02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:46.560]  norther hemisphere spring festival and usually a public holiday it's also a traditional spring holiday
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:51.840]  in many cultures dances singing and kegs are usually part of it the 19th century mayday was
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:56.480]  chosen the day for international workers day by socialist and communists in the second international
[02:54:56.480 --> 02:55:01.840]  to commemorate the haymarket affair in chicago in those countries to celebrate international
[02:55:01.840 --> 02:55:08.000]  workers day the day many also may be referred to as mayday but it is a different celebration
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:15.360]  from the traditional mayday and let's go back to your calls and i'll do a little bit of overdrive
[02:55:15.360 --> 02:55:19.200]  and finish some of the news and the economy and world news haven't gotten to chris thank you for
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:25.280]  holding from north carolina you're on the air hey alec um i want to talk talk about the logo for
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:32.880]  jade hill um i've seen a video on youtube and some other places the blob in the middle where the
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:41.840]  arrows crossed through the sword it's like a a wooden shoe like a clog and the guy was tied
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:47.760]  it into the wooden shoes that they wore at the uh concentration camp i thought that was uh pretty
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:54.080]  interesting well the main jade helps symbol i've seen in the army documents is a sword cutting
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:56:00.160]  through arrows and that's a symbol of the arrows is american might an american defense which should
[02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:06.320]  be american gun owners in my view and the dagger uh is shattering them i mean i i'm that's what it
[02:56:06.320 --> 02:56:12.800]  means it means take out a other military force and it's shown as arrows that the united states
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:17.760]  is a deception with the eagle with the olive branch in one hand but the weapons in the other
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:22.480]  is the arrows so that's the jade helms symbol i've seen what what jade helms symbol are you
[02:56:22.480 --> 02:56:28.400]  talking about it's the main one it's just the where you where it looks like the arrows are breaking
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:36.320]  it's not it's uh almost like a translucent shoe but the guy zooms in and uh no i do see it i see
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:44.160]  it looks like a shoe and uh and i saw it yeah it's like a wooden clog with a design on the front
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:47.520]  i do see it you're right
[02:56:49.680 --> 02:56:55.840]  so he was tying that into the you know prison camps in germany because they wore wooden clogs
[02:56:55.840 --> 02:57:01.520]  and i thought it was kind of freaky it's bizarre this does have hidden images in it
[02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:05.360]  i didn't even notice that i thought it was like a bad graphic when i looked at it a month ago we
[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:13.120]  broke it it's amazing but again this show broke jade helm but you sent us the email listeners
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:18.960]  and then you got the word out you broke jade helm this is the inverse of cnn or these other channels

[02:58:05.760 --> 02:58:11.600]  facebook and i was trying to um link them to a bunch of studies but they were just constantly
[02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:17.040]  censoring my uh posts oh yeah studies we don't need no stinking studies to be in mainstream media
[02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:20.800]  now more and more you've got to be a liar and you've got to censor people and you've got to be
[02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:25.440]  afraid of reality but just keep doing it they don't have many listeners it doesn't matter just keep

[03:00:53.680 --> 03:00:58.960]  from david night host of info works nightly news on the jade helm symbol that we were just discussing
[03:00:58.960 --> 03:01:03.520]  david yeah alex a lot of people have raised questions about what that shoe might mean i
[03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:09.520]  didn't notice it for quite some time some people have made ties to the bund shoe revolution which
[03:01:09.520 --> 03:01:14.400]  is a german revolution that had a lot of parallels to the people that are being oppressed now uh
[03:01:14.400 --> 03:01:20.000]  also the uh the reference to the uh people who are in prison camps that's also true that had
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:24.000]  wooden shoes but the way the military has explained it is that are those wooden shoes are
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:29.520]  called sabo and it's where we get the word sabotage i think that's the most likely explanation
[03:01:29.520 --> 03:01:34.560]  and we should remember that the special forces that are putting this out there they're they're
[03:01:34.560 --> 03:01:39.360]  working on sabotage they're working on psyops that's really what they're talking about when
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:44.960]  they talk about sabotage means uh i guess in french sandal wooden sandal to stick it machinery wow
[03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:49.440]  there it is i think that's the answer it means sabotage america yes and then they're going to
[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:54.400]  tell low level troops as a psyop this is for overseas in the main mission directive so they
[03:01:54.400 --> 03:01:59.360]  think we're liars but once they get to the actual mission there will be cadres uh who are training
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:03.360]  to take over local towns that's admitted yes absolutely that's why we need to be concerned
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:07.920]  about this quite frankly if this is something that's being used for overseas i'm quite i'm
[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:14.000]  quite concerned about a an american government that is constantly focused on sabotage assassination
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:17.520]  and the overthrow of other governments and i think we as a people need to have a discussion
[03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:21.600]  about that that's one of the things that i had family out of the army that were domestic
[03:02:21.600 --> 03:02:25.600]  assassins for the government they're running around everywhere the course this is for america
[03:02:25.600 --> 03:02:29.600]  yes absolutely but of course it has dual use overseas as well who's hosting the nightly news

[03:02:41.840 --> 03:02:47.680]  i just wanted to bring up a point about the uh apa colluding with the cia for and secretly to
[03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:52.880]  institute secretly the torture programs and and all of that and the implications of tasks
[03:02:52.880 --> 03:02:57.840]  with this and five sure go ahead leading into the also leading into the soviet style noxious
[03:02:57.840 --> 03:03:01.600]  style diagnosis yeah they say you're mentally ill if you don't like big government to turn
[03:03:01.600 --> 03:03:05.200]  your guns in so you've got to be taken to a reeducation center that's the model and they're
[03:03:05.200 --> 03:03:09.760]  using it on the veterans right now disarming hundreds of thousands every few months the
[03:03:09.760 --> 03:03:16.800]  persecution is on my god they got them on secret death list it's here it's here and i'm a student
[03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:22.400]  pursuing an american family therapy license and the things like oppositional defiance disorder and
[03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:26.960]  from the other personality disorders it's just the implications in the new dsm are just are just
[03:03:26.960 --> 03:03:31.920]  out there and it's really scary because it's it's almost like it's almost like we're living in
[03:03:31.920 --> 03:03:37.040]  nazi germany in the mid 30s yep though it's not like it's it's here but it won't be racial this
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:40.640]  time except within fighting it's going to be going after the middle class claiming to make
[03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:45.840]  125 thousand a year you're the rich pig that has to be i mean it's it's look we have cancer
[03:03:45.840 --> 03:03:51.120]  every other country's fallen to tyranny or gone through this it's here folks there's no doubt
[03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:58.160]  we're in deep you know what one last point i go to the dsm and of course all that the them
[03:03:58.160 --> 03:04:03.360]  colluding went to institute you know all this torture uh it's just it's just scary and the fact
[03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:08.720]  that they did it secretly just blows me away but but the big thing for the dsm um is that's the
[03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:14.720]  diagnostic manual for psychology that they add scores of things to every year right and and
[03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:20.160]  the big the big thing about that is to me is a lot of the a lot of the diagnosis one there's
[03:04:20.160 --> 03:04:25.040]  not really that kind of deep research along the two in the research scientific research behind it
[03:04:25.040 --> 03:04:30.080]  and two a lot of this just common sense common depressions that we all experience i mean like
[03:04:30.080 --> 03:04:34.640]  you ranting on air sometimes you know so that's exactly it's normal to get upset about tyranny
[03:04:34.640 --> 03:04:39.760]  they call that manic or bunch of other stuff thank you so much and at this credit's real psychology
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:43.440]  even there's a lot of stuff to be learned from psychology that's some good elements but it's
[03:04:43.440 --> 03:04:48.160]  run by bad people it's used for oppression there there's no doubt about that okay i'm out of time
