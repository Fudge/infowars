[00:00.000 --> 00:13.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.960 --> 00:24.480]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it is Friday
[00:24.480 --> 00:36.240]  December 4th 2009 we're gonna be live here for the next four hours I want to
[00:36.240 --> 00:43.400]  illustrate today that climate gave is a great victory against the globalist it
[00:43.400 --> 00:49.560]  is the centerpiece to their global government taxation regulation program
[00:49.560 --> 00:55.320]  the system of shutting off resources to world populations to bankrupt the
[00:55.320 --> 00:58.960]  general population so we're dependent on government and whereas at the
[00:58.960 --> 01:03.360]  international level we're having great victories against the Copenhagen agenda
[01:03.360 --> 01:10.320]  Australia had the votes a week ago to pass massive carbon taxing legislation
[01:10.320 --> 01:16.200]  over every facet of Australians lives that was soundly defeated and much of
[01:16.200 --> 01:20.640]  the government has now resigned the parliament is in the final stages of
[01:20.640 --> 01:28.240]  collapsing but still in Australia Canada England Europe the United States many
[01:28.240 --> 01:33.320]  areas of Latin America China they are still implementing at the local level
[01:33.320 --> 01:47.360]  and the regional level the state level massive absolutely massive carbon taxes
[01:47.360 --> 01:50.960]  and environmental taxes that have nothing to do with the environment so I
[01:50.960 --> 01:57.440]  want to go over this today also we're seeing some deceptive job numbers
[01:57.440 --> 02:03.160]  they're claiming it's gone from 10.2 down to 10 when all of the private
[02:03.160 --> 02:08.360]  institutions out there even CNBC zone number 17.5 so when you see headlines
[02:08.360 --> 02:13.960]  like oh jobless numbers so good it's almost unbelievable because it is
[02:13.960 --> 02:17.760]  unbelievable it's a fraud it's a lie the good news is the people are waking up to
[02:17.760 --> 02:21.320]  the real government the illegitimate shadow banking government Rasmussen
[02:21.320 --> 02:25.840]  polls just 21% favor Bernanke's reappointment as Fed chairman he's been
[02:25.840 --> 02:30.960]  massively grilled that's coming up in the next segment we're going to break it
[02:30.960 --> 02:42.960]  all down today and we're also going to open the phones up we're gonna open the
[02:42.960 --> 02:48.080]  phones up for the full four hours to talk about any news item any issue anything
[02:48.080 --> 02:52.840]  happening in your area climategate what's happening to the dollar the
[02:52.840 --> 02:59.640]  expansion of the war by Obama massively here's the toll-free number to join us
[02:59.640 --> 03:10.480]  you're going to need it 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 in fact I'm going to come
[03:10.480 --> 03:13.960]  back after this quick break and just take calls until the bottom of the hour
[03:13.960 --> 03:18.800]  then I'm going to do a news blitz on climategate banking gate and so much
[03:18.800 --> 03:23.720]  more and cover all the latest developments on climategate and then
[03:23.720 --> 03:27.560]  cover how they're still moving forward though yes we're having victories but
[03:27.560 --> 03:32.080]  they're moving forward at the local state and regional level not just in the
[03:32.080 --> 03:35.360]  United States but across the planet the toll-free number to join us again on
[03:35.360 --> 03:41.000]  air is 1-800-259-9231 I know a lot of people email me and write me letters
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.240]  saying I've tried to call in for years I can't ever get in what you do is as soon
[03:44.240 --> 03:48.200]  as you hear a caller hang up as soon as I let a caller go start dialing we're
[03:48.200 --> 03:56.520]  going to get you on air 1-800-259-9231 also there are more mainstream media
[03:56.520 --> 04:00.400]  reports of military checkpoints and warrantless police checkpoints going
[04:00.400 --> 04:06.520]  on all over the country we're being eased in to a form of martial law so we
[04:06.520 --> 04:09.400]  also want to get your reports on that more and more YouTube videos popping up
[04:09.400 --> 04:13.960]  every few days of a different listeners of this show predominantly who are
[04:13.960 --> 04:18.800]  driving through their towns all over the country and running into military
[04:18.800 --> 04:23.600]  checkpoints with National Guard regular Army Marine Corps this is a huge
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.200]  story we've been tracking for 14 years and it's really beginning to come to a
[04:27.200 --> 04:31.640]  head the quiet behind the scenes militarization of police and their
[04:31.640 --> 04:38.560]  integration with regular military it is all coming up today 1-800-259-9231
[04:38.560 --> 04:42.800]  Ron Paul is going to be on with us next week I want to just tell you that we're
[04:42.800 --> 04:45.800]  going to have Lord Moncton on for at least one report perhaps two or three
[04:45.800 --> 04:50.040]  reports Jesse Ventura is going to pop back in about his show being the highest
[04:50.040 --> 04:58.120]  rated ever on true TV big victory there so much is coming up today this is the
[04:58.120 --> 05:01.920]  GCN radio network stay with us this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about

[06:02.200 --> 06:06.080]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[06:06.080 --> 06:10.040]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[06:10.040 --> 06:13.960]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[06:13.960 --> 06:18.120]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[06:18.120 --> 06:22.600]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[06:22.600 --> 06:27.320]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[06:27.320 --> 06:31.120]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[06:31.120 --> 06:34.800]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[06:34.800 --> 06:39.120]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[06:39.120 --> 06:42.280]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[07:59.680 --> 08:05.320]  the tour that we about to take is designed to promote awareness of the
[08:05.320 --> 08:08.760]  challenges that we face from climate change and the kind of things that we
[08:08.760 --> 08:14.200]  can do together to overcome those challenges. In California we already
[08:14.200 --> 08:19.360]  seeing the signs of a change in climate. Average temperatures in our state
[08:19.360 --> 08:23.200]  rose nearly two degrees and if greenhouse gas emissions are not
[08:23.200 --> 08:27.840]  substantially reduced scientists tell us that temperatures in California could
[08:27.840 --> 08:32.640]  rise an additional seven degrees during this century. Perhaps one of the
[08:32.640 --> 08:36.720]  greatest risks from climate change is a less reliable water supply. The
[08:36.720 --> 08:41.600]  Californians have long struggled with water shortages. In those shortages I
[08:41.600 --> 08:46.360]  expected to get worse as temperatures rise and as we lose our precious Sierra
[08:46.360 --> 08:50.960]  snowpack. Projects shown here indicate that if global warming continues
[08:50.960 --> 08:55.800]  unabated the spring snowpack in Sierra Nevada will virtually disappear by the
[08:55.800 --> 09:00.680]  end of the century. This would pose extreme challenges to water managers,
[09:00.680 --> 09:06.120]  hampa hydropower generation and nearly eliminates skiing, snowboarding and
[09:06.120 --> 09:11.320]  other recreational activities. Now another area of concern for California is our
[09:11.320 --> 09:19.360]  1100 miles of scenic coastline. Our coast home to over 25 million people is
[09:19.360 --> 09:25.720]  vulnerable to a range of natural hazards including storms, high tides and rising
[09:25.720 --> 09:30.160]  sea levels. By investing in green technology we can create a new economic
[09:30.160 --> 09:36.160]  foundation for the 21st century that is built on clean fuel, clean energy and
[09:36.160 --> 09:40.960]  clean cars. Now one terrific example is for instance the car company called
[09:40.960 --> 09:47.280]  Tesla Motors. Tesla manufactures cars that are 100% electric. They produce
[09:47.280 --> 09:54.120]  zero greenhouse gases and did I mention they can go from zero to 60 in 3.9
[09:54.120 --> 09:59.240]  seconds. I'm proud that because of California's aggressive environmental
[09:59.240 --> 10:04.800]  policies Tesla is manufacturing their cars and creating their great jobs right
[10:04.800 --> 10:09.480]  here in California. In fact a wave of green innovation is washing over our
[10:09.480 --> 10:15.440]  state. We are proving that it is possible to protect both the environment and the
[10:15.440 --> 10:17.920]  economy.
[10:17.920 --> 10:32.520]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does
[10:32.520 --> 10:40.080]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[10:40.080 --> 10:53.040]  Alex Jones. It is Friday the 4th day of December 2009. Wide open phones. The
[10:53.040 --> 10:59.640]  latest on climate aid. The battle to remove private Federal Reserve Chairman
[10:59.640 --> 11:04.920]  Ben Bernanke. It's all coming up today on our once a week visit with Bob Chapman
[11:04.920 --> 11:09.120]  on the economy. Now I just played that Schwarzenegger clip and later I'm going
[11:09.120 --> 11:13.480]  to play a bunch of audio and video clips here on air dealing with Climate Gate
[11:13.480 --> 11:17.280]  but I did just want to start the second segment of the show with that clip
[11:17.280 --> 11:23.880]  because it's all lies. I have a Daily Mail article here out of Canada. Arnold
[11:23.880 --> 11:28.680]  Schwarzenegger unveils dramatic climate change map which shows flooded San
[11:28.680 --> 11:34.360]  Francisco of the future. It shows Alcatraz and Treasure Island being
[11:34.360 --> 11:38.640]  completely under water. Water would have to raise over 40 feet for that to
[11:38.640 --> 11:43.560]  happen. This is the equivalent of telling children that the boogeyman is
[11:43.560 --> 11:49.200]  going to sneak into their rooms at night and chop their heads off if they don't
[11:49.200 --> 11:54.120]  do what their parents tell them. This is just complete and total fraud. The
[11:54.120 --> 12:01.200]  official United Nations IPCC fraud, their numbers coming from the East Anglia
[12:01.200 --> 12:07.460]  Weather Center that that was their main group they colluded with, say that sea
[12:07.460 --> 12:12.080]  levels will rise by a foot in the next three decades and that's been proven to
[12:12.080 --> 12:17.000]  be a fraud. Not 30 feet, not 40 feet like Schwarzenegger saying. John P.
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  Holdren got grilled a few days ago in Congress, the White House science are,
[12:22.000 --> 12:29.040]  saying that sea levels would rise 13 to 14 feet and the senator pulled out the
[12:29.040 --> 12:37.880]  UN's own report saying one foot, it's all lies. And Schwarzenegger talks about
[12:37.880 --> 12:41.440]  clean energy, fun cars, you know, that's the candy coating to make it sound
[12:41.440 --> 12:45.840]  reasonable. No, this is the government dictatorially outside of the legislature,
[12:45.840 --> 12:50.480]  the executive in California saying we're banning TVs over 40 inches, we're putting
[12:50.480 --> 12:54.200]  taxes on all the rest. They announced that three weeks ago, just said I'm just
[12:54.200 --> 13:00.920]  ordering the energy agency in California to do this. You see, real profits are in
[13:00.920 --> 13:05.160]  artificial scarcity and artificial monopolies and cartels.
[13:05.160 --> 13:12.280]  Schwarzenegger, I was no fan of Governor Gray Davis and you live, you learn. And I
[13:12.280 --> 13:17.680]  got fooled. What was it? Six years ago, seven years ago, back during that recall,
[13:17.680 --> 13:22.480]  because he was an anti-gun guy. He wanted to ban guns outright. He was a big
[13:22.480 --> 13:27.480]  government pimp. And so I got behind some of the state senators that were
[13:27.480 --> 13:33.640]  trying to recall him. They then stepped aside and Schwarzenegger was inserted in
[13:33.640 --> 13:42.560]  riding on the wave of indignation and anger against the state for charging
[13:42.560 --> 13:47.520]  billions of dollars a week, in some cases, more for energy than what it really
[13:47.520 --> 13:52.520]  cost for electricity. Now, it turned out Gray Davis was actually fighting that.
[13:52.520 --> 13:56.600]  That's why they did the recall. Gray Davis was a bad guy, but he was right in
[13:56.600 --> 14:00.840]  blaming Enron. It later came out Enron, who ran the system through the government,
[14:00.840 --> 14:05.160]  was defrauding people and saying there wasn't enough power and double, triple,
[14:05.160 --> 14:09.960]  quadruple, and even some cases higher, some cases 10 times what electricity was
[14:09.960 --> 14:13.240]  really costing. They were just claiming that that was the cost because they
[14:13.240 --> 14:20.600]  controlled the mercantile exchange system in California. And so they just robbed
[14:20.600 --> 14:25.520]  everybody and it came out internal memos that Enron would turn the power off a
[14:25.520 --> 14:30.360]  few minutes or even an hour or longer every day to create the perception that
[14:30.360 --> 14:34.400]  there was no power so people would accept higher prices for power.
[14:34.400 --> 14:39.440]  Schwarzenegger then ran for governor against Enron and it turned out that he'd
[14:39.440 --> 14:44.400]  been in secret meetings a year before the scam started with Enron head and other
[14:44.400 --> 14:49.960]  energy heads preparing the whole recall the entire scam. That came out in the
[14:49.960 --> 14:55.720]  news, but just buried in the articles. And so now the government is just going to
[14:55.720 --> 15:01.840]  run the scam on a wider scale. Arnold Alos Schwarzenegger is an un-American
[15:01.840 --> 15:07.720]  piece of filth and trash in a degenerate criminal period. He is worse than
[15:07.720 --> 15:11.880]  Al Gore. Al Gore is trying to set up the global scam and wants the carbon credits
[15:11.880 --> 15:16.080]  to be paid to him and he's getting a lot of the quote green funding money for
[15:16.080 --> 15:20.920]  startup companies that he owns, runs, or controls. And that's bad. But
[15:20.920 --> 15:26.560]  Schwarzenegger in control of the seventh largest economy in the world, by itself
[15:26.560 --> 15:32.760]  it's the seventh largest economy in the world, is literally raping the people.
[15:32.760 --> 15:41.040]  And to have him sit up there with maps of San Francisco underwater is a fraud,
[15:41.040 --> 15:47.040]  a biblical proportions. It is a lie that sea levels are going to rise a foot.
[15:47.040 --> 15:49.440]  It is a lie that they're going to rise two feet. It's a lie that they're going to
[15:49.440 --> 15:53.840]  rise five feet, 10 feet, 20 feet, 30 feet. This guy's saying over 30 feet.
[15:53.840 --> 15:59.280]  It is a complete and total fraud. And even if the earth did heat up and even
[15:59.280 --> 16:05.520]  if sea levels did rise dramatically, that is because of the sun. But now that
[16:05.520 --> 16:11.160]  warming trend has been reversed for at least the last nine years. And since
[16:11.160 --> 16:16.880]  1961, the warming trend stabilized. It's now dropping. And we have the internal
[16:16.880 --> 16:22.080]  UN climate research facility documents on this. So understand, yeah, we're having
[16:22.080 --> 16:26.200]  a big victory with climate gate documents and emails coming out. And yes, Al Gore
[16:26.200 --> 16:30.280]  is canceling a lot of his speaking engagements and trips to Copenhagen. And
[16:30.280 --> 16:35.760]  yes, they're in retreat on many fronts. But understand, there are hundreds and
[16:35.760 --> 16:41.200]  hundreds and hundreds of climate taxes all over the nation already in place.
[16:41.200 --> 16:46.120]  And we need to start routing them out because they're based on this fraud.
[16:46.120 --> 16:50.480]  They already put a lot of their criminality in place before we were able
[16:50.480 --> 16:53.560]  to turn this around. And we're just now starting to turn it around. But it's
[16:53.560 --> 16:58.920]  like a battleship. You may turn the wheel, but it takes a long time to get it to
[16:58.920 --> 17:06.640]  begin really turning. And it's still basically plowing right into us. In
[17:06.640 --> 17:10.840]  other climate gate news, we're going to detail in more detail later, climate
[17:10.840 --> 17:15.040]  investigator is member of the elementary pro man made global warming
[17:15.040 --> 17:19.920]  organization. So the people they're hiring in England, the people they're
[17:19.920 --> 17:23.480]  hiring in the US, the people they're hiring in Australia to investigate
[17:23.480 --> 17:29.040]  climate gate are people intimately involved in it. Kind of like they called
[17:29.040 --> 17:33.320]  the Waco investigation independent when Janet Reno and the Justice
[17:33.320 --> 17:39.360]  Department that carried out the attack of Waco on April 19th, 1993 ran the
[17:39.360 --> 17:43.320]  investigation themselves or Bush appointing the two chairman of the 911
[17:43.320 --> 17:48.800]  Commission and calling it an independent investigation. No, it's not
[17:48.800 --> 17:54.400]  independent. It's all fraud. The sea levels aren't going to rise 40 feet or
[17:54.400 --> 17:58.680]  11 feet or 14 feet. Polar bears aren't grounding. Polar bear numbers aren't
[17:58.680 --> 18:07.280]  down. It's a fraud that the United Nations is going to do an independent
[18:07.280 --> 18:10.000]  investigation or the British government is going to do a pen independent
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.320]  investigation because they're the governments that want this new system of
[18:13.320 --> 18:18.200]  feudalism of Neo's feudal surfdom. They are the progenitors. They are the
[18:18.200 --> 18:22.960]  people that want it. And so these investigations are frauds and will be
[18:22.960 --> 18:27.000]  frauds. That's why Senator Boxer over the committee within off won't allow an
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.440]  investigation by that committee. She says I may have an investigation of who
[18:30.440 --> 18:33.760]  stole the emails turning it around backwards.
[18:36.880 --> 18:40.920]  Now it's clear it's a hoax that these weren't even hacked emails. The police
[18:40.920 --> 18:45.960]  just said that it was investigators inside people that were working inside
[18:45.960 --> 18:50.600]  the university that leaked it to the BBC and others. How do we know? The
[18:50.600 --> 18:53.920]  media's had to admit. Well, yes, there were internal people working there that
[18:53.920 --> 18:59.080]  did contact us, but we didn't publish what they gave us. So then someone just
[18:59.080 --> 19:03.080]  put it on a public server at the university and let people know because
[19:03.080 --> 19:07.040]  there have been four year request that had been blocked criminally by the
[19:07.040 --> 19:11.880]  university heads in collusion with the government. That's in the emails. This is
[19:11.880 --> 19:17.480]  the people's data by law. It was by law is meant to be released, but it wasn't.
[19:19.040 --> 19:22.000]  Alright, I'm already getting into this. It's just that the plot is thickening
[19:22.000 --> 19:26.240]  and they are now turning on each other.
[19:28.560 --> 19:36.000]  Professor Piltdown man, Professor man in Pennsylvania is now turning against Mr
[19:36.000 --> 19:42.800]  Jones, the head ringleader of the climate scam. It's all coming up. But first
[19:42.800 --> 19:47.880]  your calls straight ahead. Kelly, Jeff Scott, Eddie, James and others. I'm
[19:47.880 --> 19:50.680]  going straight to your calls and I'm giving each person one minute. No

[24:22.480 --> 24:26.280]  drowning, that there's no ice caps, that are telling people their homes are going

[24:30.120 --> 24:36.080]  drowning. Listen, you criminals, we're going to rout you out worldwide. We're

[24:41.720 --> 24:49.760]  some calls. Kelly in Idaho, you're on the air. Yes Kelly, go ahead.
[24:49.760 --> 24:56.480]  I didn't hear you call my name. Hey Alex, it's good talking with you. I am
[24:56.480 --> 25:01.000]  chairman of Idaho for the Independent American Party. Do you mind if I get a
[25:01.000 --> 25:11.720]  website or two out? Yes sir. usiap.org, homelandinsacurity.info,
[25:11.720 --> 25:19.240]  homelandinsacurity.info, usiap.org. Hey, you know, my beginning to all this
[25:19.240 --> 25:25.000]  started with a guy in Austin, Texas by the name of Alex Jones years ago and I
[25:25.000 --> 25:31.360]  appreciate profusely what the stuff you do. But one thing, you know, studying the
[25:31.360 --> 25:37.420]  founding fathers and reading books and doing research myself, I just, I feel
[25:37.420 --> 25:43.520]  strongly that they were advocates of public and private prayer. And if I do
[25:43.520 --> 25:48.040]  have a message from the founders for you today, this is your radio show, you know,
[25:48.040 --> 25:51.320]  I hear you every so often, Tenor, Rat and Rave a little bit, this is your show
[25:51.320 --> 25:54.960]  you don't like to be included with all the tangents and all those things, but
[25:54.960 --> 26:02.080]  Alex Jones, I believe, can if he wants to start and end this program every day
[26:02.080 --> 26:06.360]  with prayer. I believe you can do that. I believe it'd be good for America. Okay, I
[26:06.360 --> 26:10.760]  appreciate your call, Kelly. Let's talk to Jeff in Oregon. Jeff, you're on the
[26:10.760 --> 26:18.680]  ear. Yes, good morning, Alex. Hey, buddy. Hey, I just wanted to tell you and ask you
[26:18.680 --> 26:22.800]  a question on this. I viewed Michael Rupert's new film, the debut of it
[26:22.800 --> 26:29.360]  collapsed in Portland, Oregon last night. Have you heard of the film? Yes, it's
[26:29.360 --> 26:35.400]  basically kind of a George Soros view that the Earth's resources are running
[26:35.400 --> 26:39.480]  out, global warming's real. I know Mike writes articles about how we've got to
[26:39.480 --> 26:45.800]  reduce the population and it's basically the establishment's angle of they can't
[26:45.800 --> 26:49.240]  beat the conspiracy theorists, as we're known by the mainstream media, so join
[26:49.240 --> 26:53.920]  them. And it's all about how he predicted the banking crisis when anybody who
[26:53.920 --> 26:58.040]  could research what was happening, Ron Paul predicted it 30 years ago, could
[26:58.040 --> 27:01.080]  understand that the fractional reserve banking system was going to do this to
[27:01.080 --> 27:06.280]  us. And it's basically kind of like an Al Gore type movie. I haven't seen it, but
[27:06.280 --> 27:10.120]  I've seen the trailer and read the synopsis and I know that it's made by
[27:10.120 --> 27:13.560]  the same guy that made a movie about the yes men. We know the yes men are
[27:13.560 --> 27:18.280]  funded by the Soros crowd, but you know, Mike's written a lot of bad things
[27:18.280 --> 27:22.560]  about me and attacked me over the years. And after I stopped having him on the
[27:22.560 --> 27:26.240]  show, when he started getting into all this stuff, I think he's done good
[27:26.240 --> 27:32.720]  research on government drug dealing, the CIA, narcotics trafficking. But yeah, I
[27:32.720 --> 27:38.520]  mean, this is what we can expect from folks. So I really don't have anything
[27:38.520 --> 27:41.520]  to say about it. I'm not going to be seeing it and I'm not even really going
[27:41.520 --> 27:45.640]  to give it any attention on my show. But I mean, you can give us your take on it
[27:45.640 --> 27:50.880]  if you like. Well, my take on it was pretty much how you just broke it down.
[27:50.880 --> 27:54.880]  I mean, I never heard of Michael Rupert. He was there. I met him at the
[27:54.880 --> 28:00.160]  premiere. Seemed like a nice guy. And yeah, he did do a lot of great things
[28:00.160 --> 28:05.520]  about exposing drug trafficking, drug trafficking in the CIA. But I got the
[28:05.520 --> 28:11.440]  feeling that his movie was somewhere between fall of the republic and
[28:11.440 --> 28:16.920]  Michael Moore's documentary. In other words, yes, he agrees there's going to be
[28:16.920 --> 28:22.120]  a collapse. But I asked him because he had a Q&A at the end of the film. And I
[28:22.120 --> 28:25.520]  asked him, you know, it just seems to me, Michael, that there's an elephant in the
[28:25.520 --> 28:31.000]  living room here. And that is, you just delete the fact that there's a
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.160]  coordinated global elite that would not even allow us to have these resources if
[28:37.160 --> 28:41.640]  there were any resources for the shortages that you're suggesting. Exactly. The
[28:41.640 --> 28:46.960]  globalist in all their U.N. documents, Maurice Strong, all of them say, we want
[28:46.960 --> 28:51.960]  to shut their resources off by design. We're going to tell people there are no
[28:51.960 --> 28:57.960]  resources. They openly fund the peak oil scam, the global warning scam, all of it.
[28:57.960 --> 29:02.160]  And they know they can't sell it to the public now from the establishment
[29:02.160 --> 29:07.480]  position. So now they come as the grassroots. Oh, there's a profit letting
[29:07.480 --> 29:11.800]  you in on the inside. You know, our society is going to collapse. Yes,
[29:11.800 --> 29:16.880]  because the banks by design, it's come out in the Clatchy newspapers. They got
[29:16.880 --> 29:21.160]  the internal Goldman Sachs documents where they were betting secretly
[29:21.160 --> 29:25.080]  against housing while selling housing and telling people to get involved so
[29:25.080 --> 29:29.920]  they could consolidate power. They're shutting off our resources and telling
[29:29.920 --> 29:34.960]  us it's because there are no more resources when it's a complete and total
[29:34.960 --> 29:40.520]  fraud. So I appreciate your call. It's not going to work. Okay. I mean, anytime
[29:40.520 --> 29:45.000]  somebody hears them saying that the sea levels are going to rise by 10 to 40
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.320]  feet, it's a complete lie. The U.N. themselves with fraudulent numbers says
[29:49.320 --> 29:57.040]  one foot. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN
[29:57.040 --> 30:04.960]  Radio Network. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century
[30:04.960 --> 30:09.760]  alone. This is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off
[30:09.760 --> 30:14.000]  this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[30:14.000 --> 30:18.960]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[30:18.960 --> 30:23.680]  are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[30:23.680 --> 30:28.000]  citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[30:28.000 --> 30:33.280]  nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[30:33.280 --> 30:37.560]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists
[30:37.560 --> 30:41.080]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[30:41.080 --> 30:46.320]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[30:46.320 --> 30:51.240]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on

[31:03.920 --> 31:07.800]  you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm how much

[31:24.800 --> 31:28.560]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[31:28.560 --> 31:32.520]  yourself will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out
[31:32.520 --> 31:36.960]  all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to
[31:36.960 --> 31:41.520]  fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How

[33:26.880 --> 33:32.080]  that are kidnapping people's children. I go after the government that is using
[33:32.080 --> 33:40.120]  illegitimate fraudulently grabbed power outside of due process to abuse people
[33:40.120 --> 33:44.600]  and so that's why you haven't really heard me get into reviews of films and
[33:44.600 --> 33:50.160]  books and you know materials by little guys who are kind of pushing the
[33:50.160 --> 33:58.400]  establishment agenda but from our angle because we've got so many big fish to
[33:58.400 --> 34:04.640]  fry here. Ladies and gentlemen so much is going on and happening. If I just cover
[34:04.640 --> 34:09.200]  the basics of how the new order fraud works, how their scams work, what their
[34:09.200 --> 34:13.920]  eugenics agenda is of cutting off your resources, controlling you, bankrupting
[34:13.920 --> 34:18.080]  you to make you dependent on them, then when you read a book or see a movie or
[34:18.080 --> 34:22.720]  watch a television show you're going to see the propaganda for yourself and then
[34:22.720 --> 34:29.680]  you can make the decision for yourself what you're going to do, what you're
[34:29.680 --> 34:33.960]  going to say, what you're going to promote. I mean really that's the bottom
[34:33.960 --> 34:38.440]  line here. A few weeks ago when I watched the trailers for that film and read
[34:38.440 --> 34:42.640]  about it a little bit I was like because I'd read previous stuff he'd written and
[34:42.640 --> 34:45.400]  I was like man this is a new order agenda but I just said I'm not going to talk
[34:45.400 --> 34:48.400]  about it. People can figure that out for themselves if they run into it because
[34:48.400 --> 34:53.080]  I'm not going to spend time promoting it. I need to spend time talking about the
[34:53.080 --> 34:58.880]  solutions and the biggest solution is identifying the global architecture, the
[34:58.880 --> 35:02.200]  system of world government, how they plan on funding it and that is
[35:02.200 --> 35:09.400]  predominantly through fake climate taxes, through just the thousands of
[35:09.400 --> 35:13.960]  different things they're going to do like taxing you for the meat you eat and
[35:13.960 --> 35:19.680]  for products you buy or sell that have a quote high carbon footprint and putting
[35:19.680 --> 35:25.000]  tracker boxes in your car to tax you by the mile and to control your life so
[35:25.000 --> 35:29.240]  that they can't force you to not commute and force you to not have free
[35:29.240 --> 35:36.360]  mobility and track everything you do. I mean there's just so many things coming
[35:36.360 --> 35:40.800]  at us and that's why I made fall the Republic that's why I made the Obama
[35:40.800 --> 35:45.080]  deception both of these films cover the climate tax the climate fraud the
[35:45.080 --> 35:49.720]  control how they're not just federalizing but internationalizing all of our
[35:49.720 --> 35:53.800]  counties and cities and states through these international agendas the big
[35:53.800 --> 35:59.520]  banks come in and tell counties and cities and states oh we'll give you this
[35:59.520 --> 36:04.280]  big loan we'll give you this bond project but you've got to agree to do to
[36:04.280 --> 36:08.240]  follow all these stipulations it's exactly what the IMF and World Bank have
[36:08.240 --> 36:12.520]  done for 50 years plus in the third world they come in and say we're gonna
[36:12.520 --> 36:20.040]  loan you $5 billion say in Nigeria at 30% compounding interest but you've got
[36:20.040 --> 36:25.400]  to agree to only spend the money with this list of corporations which are the
[36:25.400 --> 36:29.600]  same corporations that are owned by the same private central banks that loan
[36:29.600 --> 36:36.480]  that third world nation taxpayer money at interest see how the scam works you
[36:36.480 --> 36:40.720]  know there's an article today oh Bank of America pays back the entire 45 billion
[36:40.720 --> 36:46.720]  they got of the tarp funds well there's several levels to that fraud that was
[36:46.720 --> 36:54.520]  only one group of monies that the banks got in that first 700 billion it's over
[36:54.520 --> 37:02.080]  23.7 and that number is four months old in the first 10 months of the looting
[37:02.080 --> 37:07.640]  they stole 23.7 trillion according to Congress in Bloomberg who knows what it
[37:07.640 --> 37:13.160]  is now no doubt over 30 trillion at the at the graph point where it left off if
[37:13.160 --> 37:20.920]  you keep following the graph but 23.7 trillion and they're talking about
[37:20.920 --> 37:25.400]  paying back 45 billion what they did is they take the 45 billion they fractionally
[37:25.400 --> 37:34.760]  reserve it they loan out 10 times that conservatively so 45 billion turns into
[37:35.400 --> 37:40.160]  half a trillion then they loan that at the subsidiaries it gets loaned out again
[37:40.160 --> 37:43.960]  and again and again and then with the fiat money they pay it back with digital
[37:43.960 --> 37:48.200]  money they pay back the original money that they leveraged see when you put one
[37:48.200 --> 37:52.400]  dollar in a bank they can loan out $10 but under the Glass-Steagall Act being
[37:52.400 --> 37:57.400]  ended in 1999 they just said we can have unlimited fractional reserve banking we
[37:57.400 --> 38:01.320]  can turn one dollar into a billion dollars so no one even knows what they've
[38:01.320 --> 38:10.440]  done we just know it's 1.5 quadrillion in imaginary made-up currency and credit
[38:10.440 --> 38:15.000]  that the banks made up that they then bought the planet with and now they want
[38:15.000 --> 38:18.840]  to shut your resources off to make you poor destitute slaves their own white
[38:18.840 --> 38:24.600]  paper state this is not my opinion and anyone that does any research on it
[38:24.600 --> 38:30.680]  knows we have more oil more natural gas more coal but the globalists want to
[38:30.680 --> 38:35.240]  shut that off they built the society and the civilization and the
[38:35.240 --> 38:41.640]  infrastructure on those systems our society in the west is laid out for
[38:41.640 --> 38:49.080]  automobiles so what do they do they take one of the oldest programs out of the
[38:49.080 --> 38:56.200]  playbook of war siege and say they're gonna totally shut down society the
[38:56.200 --> 39:00.000]  Soviets had plenty of resources and their own manuals have been declassified
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.280]  where they would shut off resources on purpose to make people be so destitute
[39:04.280 --> 39:08.240]  they couldn't rise up or stand up so you'd be standing in line for five six
[39:08.240 --> 39:12.800]  seven eight hours a day just to get half a loaf of bread and one sausage to go
[39:12.800 --> 39:20.080]  home and feed your family don't you understand that this is the system we're
[39:20.080 --> 39:24.960]  going into that's why they want government-run health care I've got an
[39:24.960 --> 39:29.680]  article today where the Democrats vote in the Senate to block a Republican
[39:29.680 --> 39:35.120]  amendment to not cut Medicare and Medicaid now what type of upside down
[39:35.120 --> 39:39.720]  world is that where the Democrats now that see see they want to take over with
[39:39.720 --> 39:46.760]  government health care and then cut what you get they just want to control since
[39:46.760 --> 39:50.640]  when is it the Republicans saying don't cut people's Medicare and Medicaid
[39:50.640 --> 39:56.160]  that's associated press I'm not even saying the Republicans are good if we
[39:56.160 --> 39:58.760]  never would have gotten government control which we already have a great
[39:58.760 --> 40:02.760]  extent of health care they couldn't be bringing us fully under their control
[40:02.760 --> 40:07.520]  right now but but but what type of backwards world is it where the
[40:07.520 --> 40:16.840]  Republicans don't want people's health care cut like where is that that in my
[40:16.840 --> 40:30.400]  finance section no it's here in my stack but that's going on oh it's in the
[40:30.400 --> 40:41.920]  miscellaneous stack I'm gonna find it Senate votes down GOP plan to notice this
[40:41.920 --> 40:48.800]  headline from the Washington Post Senate votes down GOP plan to strip Medicare
[40:48.800 --> 40:55.440]  cuts from bill Senate Republicans lost their first major challenge to the
[40:55.440 --> 40:59.840]  Democrat plan overall the health care system as the chamber voted Thursday to
[40:59.840 --> 41:04.480]  reject the GOP proposal to strip the package of nearly 500 billion in
[41:04.480 --> 41:12.960]  Medicare cuts it's most important source of financing see Obama can cut your
[41:12.960 --> 41:17.280]  health care and be hailed as a loving socialist Obama can put 80,000 more
[41:17.280 --> 41:22.160]  troops it's not 35 you already put 40 something in the last 10 months he can
[41:22.160 --> 41:27.320]  put in 80,000 more troops and start bombing Pakistan and Code Pink runs out
[41:27.320 --> 41:36.600]  and starts hailing it he can cut your medical care and you love it because it
[41:36.600 --> 41:40.560]  makes you feel like a winner to have him up there you feel like oh he beat John
[41:40.560 --> 41:46.040]  McCain it was all theater they boil it down to basically a Coke Pepsi Ford
[41:46.040 --> 41:51.320]  Chevy Dallas Cowboys versus the Redskins they just boil it down to a
[41:51.320 --> 41:58.840]  mindless gruel and then force feeds you with it none of what you hear it on the
[41:58.840 --> 42:07.280]  news is real it's just all spin you know the big stories you hear about on
[42:07.280 --> 42:11.760]  television every night oh the the the truth is in the newspapers but it's all

[42:19.160 --> 42:26.360]  area of the economy take the auto bailouts of five months ago six months
[42:26.360 --> 42:37.960]  ago on record the 50 plus billion dollars injected into the automakers went
[42:37.960 --> 42:45.600]  with strings attached so that GM could move to Europe China Mexico and Brazil
[42:45.600 --> 42:51.240]  just Google the headline one billion of bailout one billion of auto bailout goes
[42:51.240 --> 42:57.400]  to GM plant in Brazil but that's just one article I remember from memory one
[42:57.400 --> 43:04.800]  billion of automaker bailout goes to GM in Brazil and then you can read oh three
[43:04.800 --> 43:11.200]  billion to opal in Germany oh five billion to China they're paying the
[43:11.200 --> 43:18.120]  government is paying to take your jobs away fools hello by my love you bail out

[44:22.680 --> 44:29.680]  it they've got 1.5 quadrillion in cash they made up that they pulled out of a
[44:29.680 --> 44:34.160]  magic hat out of their top hat like a magician pulls a rabbit out with red
[44:34.160 --> 44:39.120]  eyes while you were watching the beautiful assistant while you were
[44:39.120 --> 44:44.680]  watching the NFL and drinking beer you didn't watch what the bankers did they
[44:44.680 --> 44:50.800]  were distracting you with the beautiful assistant with the porn and the partying

[44:54.600 --> 44:57.640]  big banks are in power because they're ruthless they're cunning they're
[44:57.640 --> 45:04.120]  intelligent so of course they're going to come out with fake grassroots movies
[45:04.120 --> 45:07.880]  teaching you while you're about to lose everything you've got and then blaming
[45:07.880 --> 45:11.400]  it on the very bankers you know George Soros always goes up before Congress in

[48:52.080 --> 48:56.800]  how are you man you know it's the best of times and yes I hear you yes I was
[48:56.800 --> 49:01.360]  doing it is the best of times and it was the worst of times I hear you I got a
[49:01.360 --> 49:04.800]  couple points I don't know if you've touched on these but you might have I
[49:04.800 --> 49:09.280]  haven't caught every show so I saw a couple weeks ago an announcement of a
[49:09.280 --> 49:13.480]  ship made out of the steel of the Twin Towers and I know a lot of people wanted
[49:13.480 --> 49:16.080]  to get there you know for a re-investigation that was going to be
[49:16.080 --> 49:19.720]  important part of the proposal to get the residue off the steel and everything
[49:19.720 --> 49:23.920]  what do you think about that and the other question I had is that I heard
[49:23.920 --> 49:28.640]  propaganda or it might be not propaganda of Iran saying that they refuse to
[49:28.640 --> 49:33.120]  cooperate they're gonna build 10 more nuclear facilities that was on CNN this
[49:33.120 --> 49:38.000]  weekend so between those two I'd like to hear your reaction yes they did build a
[49:38.000 --> 49:43.840]  giant missile cruiser I forget its name on the steel but the USS New York but
[49:43.840 --> 49:51.200]  you can't you can't get residue out of steel that's been re-smelted but from
[49:51.200 --> 49:54.880]  different community centers and others that got pieces of the steel that was
[49:54.880 --> 49:59.360]  given to them by the government folks were able to get the residue from those
[49:59.360 --> 50:04.080]  and find the thermite the explosive thermate in it on the subject of Iran
[50:04.080 --> 50:09.960]  Iran gave into the UN even more than any other country totally peaceful reactors
[50:09.960 --> 50:14.680]  can't produce anything near the fissile material they need and yes Iran has said
[50:14.680 --> 50:20.240]  look we're building our own energy reactors period and so the West is
[50:20.240 --> 50:23.360]  saying well we're gonna blow the daylights out of you and they've had
[50:23.360 --> 50:30.440]  hoaxes where they say oh my gosh we found a secret Iranian facility yes a
[50:30.440 --> 50:34.680]  week after Iran put out a press release saying yeah in six months to a year we'll
[50:34.680 --> 50:39.920]  open this new plant you can come inspect it now and Iran goes why should we even
[50:39.920 --> 50:44.200]  let you in here if you run around making up hoaxes that we're hiding
[50:44.200 --> 50:49.040]  facilities so I mean again this is a government in the media that tells you
[50:49.040 --> 50:52.720]  polar bears can't swim this is a government in a media that told you he
[50:52.720 --> 50:57.160]  got yellow cake uranium in Iraq from Africa and that they had missiles that
[50:57.160 --> 51:02.280]  could blow up the US in 45 minutes just it's all lies hounded by debt collectors
[51:02.280 --> 51:06.960]  with phone calls and letters thinking of calling a debt relief company don't
[51:06.960 --> 51:12.520]  greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands why pay when you can get

[55:24.040 --> 55:31.200]  Dave you're on the air hey Alex there's a new book out architects of ruin how big
[55:31.200 --> 55:35.360]  government liberals wrecked the global economy and how they'll do it again if
[55:35.360 --> 55:40.880]  no one stops him it's by Peter Schweizer and it's at Barnes and Nobel starting
[55:40.880 --> 55:47.160]  the 1960s left-wing radicals Barack Obama Rahm Emanuel Jesse Jackson Barney
[55:47.160 --> 55:53.600]  Frank Robert Rubin Andrew Cuomo Chris Dodd Janet Reno David Patrick Deval
[55:53.600 --> 55:59.600]  Patrick Henry Cisneros Nancy Pelosi Ted Kennedy Charles Schumer Hillbillory
[55:59.600 --> 56:04.720]  Clinton and Sololensky and many others aggressively pushed banks to make
[56:04.720 --> 56:09.960]  trillions of dollars in subprime liar loans to individuals who should never
[56:09.960 --> 56:14.800]  have received them in the name of social justice meanwhile Clinton forged a new
[56:14.800 --> 56:19.720]  form of state capitalism in which the Big Wall Street financial companies were
[56:19.720 --> 56:24.920]  repeatedly bailed out with their profits intact from a series of costly errors
[56:24.920 --> 56:30.000]  leading them to take ever larger risk well day number one do me a big favor
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.360]  and turn your radio off because I really really do want to be able to hear what
[56:33.360 --> 56:36.720]  you're having to say and it becomes a distraction number two I'm familiar with
[56:36.720 --> 56:41.520]  that book I've seen the media promoting it but that's only one wing on this bird
[56:41.520 --> 56:45.800]  of prey when they call it a leftist plan and whereas it's true that Bill
[56:45.800 --> 56:50.400]  Clinton got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act along with the Republicans and
[56:50.400 --> 56:56.400]  whereas it is true the Democrats pushed to give the subprime mortgage loans to
[56:56.400 --> 57:00.400]  poor people that had no way of paying it back at loan sharking you know rates
[57:00.400 --> 57:07.720]  later the Republicans were predominantly involved as well and so and you
[57:07.720 --> 57:10.720]  notice you were reading the back of the book it was you know the mistakes the
[57:10.720 --> 57:14.000]  liberals made they didn't make mistakes they're not liberals they're not
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.360]  conservatives they're big banks who create all this money out of nothing and
[57:18.360 --> 57:22.880]  then tie it to the national debt to literally enslave us that that's how
[57:22.880 --> 57:26.640]  the banks get the real power they don't want you to pay off the loan on the
[57:26.640 --> 57:31.520]  farm they want the farm it's something very simple that farmers knew 100 years
[57:31.520 --> 57:38.640]  ago in this country but I mean Reagan started some of this business saying
[57:38.640 --> 57:42.440]  let Wall Street do whatever it wants and Clinton expanded on it and then
[57:42.440 --> 57:47.480]  George W. Bush expanded and then Obama is expanding because as long as we say
[57:47.480 --> 57:50.040]  oh it's the liberals oh it's the conservatives you know the Democrats
[57:50.040 --> 57:53.480]  think when a Democrat gets in there saved and when Republicans think when
[57:53.480 --> 57:57.520]  a Republican gets in there saved and no we're not gonna have a good chief
[57:57.520 --> 58:01.640]  executive unless it's somebody like Ron Paul they've got to recognize the real
[58:01.640 --> 58:07.800]  problem yeah I don't have my radio on that's bleed over under my phone line
[58:07.800 --> 58:13.640]  maybe from a tap or something but just one other thing they took one seven
[58:13.640 --> 58:18.480]  ton beam of that from the towers there and put it on that ship I mean that's
[58:18.480 --> 58:25.080]  like one little handle on it the plate on it but that's all they used interesting

[1:00:55.600 --> 1:01:00.800]  Holdren's absurd alarmism about sea levels in desperate effort to prop up

[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:36.280]  ladies and gentlemen let's go ahead and go straight back to the calls let's
[1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:44.640]  talk to Chris in Georgia you're on the air Chris Alex yes sir I conducted an
[1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:51.240]  exit poll for our city of Clarks Georgia this week and the state and the
[1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:56.800]  county set out some officials to mess me up and try to close me down called the
[1:01:56.800 --> 1:02:02.720]  Clarkston cops Clarkston cops came out and supported me okay so you try to do
[1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:05.960]  an exit poll of what and somebody tried to violate your first amendment and the
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:11.320]  police acted as peace officers and guardians of the republic yes well
[1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:18.400]  tell us what happened well the exit poll is on it's a paper ballot poll done
[1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:24.080]  outside of the election precinct the official election precinct they sent
[1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:29.400]  out a goon and I spotted exactly what he was trying to do and he tried to
[1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:37.240]  intimidate me to move 150 feet away to the location of where the campaigners
[1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:42.400]  for the elections and the candidates have to be but the law says in Georgia at
[1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:47.680]  least that I have to be 25 feet away I was actually 80 feet away and he tried
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:52.840]  to intimidate me and I thought I told him he was a liar or that he was lying
[1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:57.920]  and that he should go home and go to bed then he proceeded to call the cops and
[1:02:57.920 --> 1:03:02.880]  when the Clarkson police came out he tried to intimidate the police officer
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:09.640]  but police officer just did his job and figured that it was a civil matter and
[1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:14.280]  he didn't understand and he said as long as I remain orderly I can conduct the
[1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:19.720]  poll and the significance of this for Georgia is that the people fighting to
[1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:26.520]  bring paper ballot back and get rid of the devolved machines need an incident
[1:03:26.520 --> 1:03:32.040]  such as this to support them in the Georgia Supreme Court well let me just
[1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:36.880]  expand on something we've seen the countless videos of union goons beating
[1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:41.280]  up tea party folks all over the country and then the media spends it and claims
[1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:45.640]  tea party people are doing it when it's actually the opposite over and over again
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:50.280]  it's the anti-tea party people beating everybody up every video I've seen new
[1:03:50.280 --> 1:03:53.760]  one came out last week from Florida where they were beating people up and
[1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:58.160]  they got in trouble but notice these morons from the unions think you're
[1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:03.520]  there trying to take their jobs when the bailout money has been used to move our
[1:04:03.520 --> 1:04:08.680]  industry overseas again as I mentioned last hour in the excellent
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:15.240]  illustrative case of the 50 plus billion for the auto bailout most of it spent to
[1:04:15.240 --> 1:04:21.320]  move the factories to Brazil to Europe and to China and to Mexico and that's
[1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:26.280]  on record I mean people ought to go to these moron union people and have
[1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:31.240]  articles printed up and go look okay I'm trying to keep our jobs here you fools
[1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:36.160]  but they don't like you coming to congressional events they use union
[1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:41.920]  goons to try to stop you and you handle him right not getting in his face but
[1:04:41.920 --> 1:04:44.320]  being in charge like you're talking to a dog

[1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:40.920]  Schwarzenegger attempts to rescue collapsing global warming fraud with
[1:08:40.920 --> 1:08:48.080]  alarmist PR stunt Arnie invokes the White House science ours absurd alarmism
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:52.320]  about sea levels in desperate effort to prop up crumbling edifice of climate
[1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:57.000]  change scam we're going to play all these videos including Holderman grilled in

[1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:09.240]  gonna go back to your calls in a moment but I wanted to play a few minutes from
[1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:14.360]  John Stuart a few days ago when even John Stuart wants to keep some of his
[1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:17.600]  credibility he's been promoting manmade global warming and global taxes and New
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:23.280]  World Order he even had to admit that this looks super bad with these internal
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:27.480]  emails getting leaked now two weeks ago so here's a few minutes of that the full
[1:09:27.480 --> 1:09:31.840]  videos linked up at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and an article written
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:39.160]  by Aaron Dykes titled it's over Al Gore it has that video posted in it if you
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:42.600]  want to see it here it is
[1:09:45.120 --> 1:09:49.840]  a hacker in England got hold of emails between leading scientists which
[1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:55.360]  skeptics say show a clear effort to raise fears about global warming and hide
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:10:00.040]  evidence against it. Oh for f**k's sake
[1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:11.320]  poor Al Gore global warming completely debunked via the very internet you
[1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:21.360]  invented oh the irony the irony knee actually the real story is not quite
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:24.560]  that sensational basically emails stolen from scientists at one of the leading
[1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:29.440]  study centers for global warming show them discussing their work a bit how do
[1:10:29.440 --> 1:10:35.120]  we put this casually he wrote the fact is we can't account for the lack of
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:39.040]  warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't I've just
[1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:43.800]  completed Mike's nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the
[1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:50.360]  last 20 years ie from 1981 onwards and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the
[1:10:50.360 --> 1:11:00.480]  decline he was just using a trick to hide the decline it's just scientists speak
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:04.840]  for using the standard statistical technique recalibrating data in order
[1:11:04.840 --> 1:11:13.280]  to trick you into not knowing about the decline but here's what's great about
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:18.120]  science in disagreement we go back and look at the raw data. University
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:24.360]  scientists say raw data from the 1980s was thrown out. Oh for f**k's sake
[1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:31.560]  why would you throw out raw data from the 80s I still have penthouses from the 70s
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:40.400]  laminated what did you keep the scientists say they kept something
[1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:48.080]  called value added data value added data what is that numbers four to five
[1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:57.200]  with art truth plus now with lemon it doesn't look good now does it disprove
[1:11:57.200 --> 1:12:02.880]  global warming no of course not but it does put a fresh set of energizers in
[1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:07.880]  the Senate's resident denier bunny the fact that this whole idea on the global
[1:12:07.880 --> 1:12:16.320]  warming of the glad that's over gone and we won you lost your life we knew
[1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:19.880]  Inhofe was going to say that I mean that guy thinks global warming is debunked
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:25.480]  every time he drinks a slushie and gets a brain freeze all right so he's trying
[1:12:25.480 --> 1:12:29.400]  to be in the middle of the road there he says is this being global warming is
[1:12:29.400 --> 1:12:34.920]  debunked of course not well actually it does this is the head climate research
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:42.440]  facility of the United Nations that they chose to publish the data they
[1:12:42.440 --> 1:12:46.640]  produced the fraudulent data this is the head organization that gives Goddard
[1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:51.000]  Space Center in the US it's data that gives the UN it's data this is the king
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:54.680]  pens and in these thousands of emails and internal documents they're in
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:12:59.000]  conversations with the top fraudulent professors at the other two big
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:03.800]  universities used by the UN three universities are used all three are in
[1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:10.560]  the emails colluding to engage in fraud on record but even worse to persecute
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:14.360]  other scientists to keep their papers from being published in prestigious
[1:13:14.360 --> 1:13:18.800]  peer-reviewed journals to block journals from publishing them to get
[1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:24.160]  people's funding cut that's where the real civil lawsuits are these professors
[1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:27.720]  caught talking about how they're persecuting people and how they're
[1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:31.080]  communicating with governments and funding institutions to persecute
[1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:35.200]  scientists that are exposing them as frauds that is racketeering that is an
[1:13:35.200 --> 1:13:39.080]  attempt to chill free speech and to shut down people's careers and to lie about
[1:13:39.080 --> 1:13:44.080]  them but then it gets worse the computer program got leaked that they used
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:49.760]  to crunch the climate data that value added data and what happens in there
[1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:54.080]  there are notes from the computer programmer how to carry out the fraud
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:59.560]  and cook the books to hide the decline the whole thing is a blueprint a road
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:06.680]  map a manual on fraud and it gets even worse from there then the emails you
[1:14:06.680 --> 1:14:09.440]  can go read these online mainstream media has been reporting on them now for
[1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:14.480]  almost two weeks we have hundreds of the emails posted on info wars dot com
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:18.160]  and prison planet dot com with links to the full files worse stuff comes out
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:24.000]  every day as people read through them not only do they hide the decline and say
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.560]  oh it's horrible there's getting colder how do we cover this up how do we
[1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:31.880]  persecute scientist no they're then and they're talking to the u.s. and
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:36.800]  british governments about how to block the release of university data that
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:41.120]  taxpayers paid for through grants going oh yes i talked to the head of the
[1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:44.360]  group they're gonna block it from the public because this is too damning yes
[1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:47.320]  i'm working with them to block it they're not gonna release it so they're
[1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:52.840]  also caught working with the government in a criminal conspiracy to cover all
[1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:57.160]  of this up hundreds of the emails deal with that all right i said i'm going to
[1:14:57.160 --> 1:15:00.080]  your calls coming up in about 15 minutes we're gonna start going into these
[1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:04.040]  videos and swartz and agar attempts to rescue collapsing global warming fraud
[1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:09.440]  with alarmist p.r. stunt two weeks ago when these documents first came out i
[1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:13.400]  said this was the equivalent of the death star plans being stolen but that we
[1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:16.800]  had to get this information out and force into the mainstream media now
[1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:20.160]  people are resigning the australian government just voted down carbon taxes
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:23.600]  al gore's canceling speaking engagements and speaking in Copenhagen
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:26.280]  Denmark because he knows people are gonna be there shouting him down and
[1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:32.640]  protesting him their entire program is in retreat so sorts and anger comes out
[1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:37.360]  with the press conference and says san francisco will be under water ladies and
[1:15:37.360 --> 1:15:42.520]  gentlemen there are parts of san francisco the hills of san francisco 600
[1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:48.360]  feet above sea level and that we've got to have an article here the la times is
[1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:53.280]  going to report on this and so is the mail but we need to in fact pull up
[1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:57.920]  san francisco sea levels for me i only happened to know the sea levels because
[1:15:57.920 --> 1:16:01.160]  i pulled them up this morning and they were it was listing different hills in
[1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:04.960]  san francisco one was 600 and something feet above sea level that's a big hill
[1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:10.280]  a mountain's 300 feet above 3,000 feet above sea level a big hill is 600 feet
[1:16:10.280 --> 1:16:17.200]  i mean the water is gonna rise 600 feet huh really the un zone climate data says
[1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:21.920]  one foot and that's cooked numbers from the university of east anglia because
[1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:26.080]  we're gonna carry out a fraud you've only got to use one group because you
[1:16:26.080 --> 1:16:30.040]  don't want others to find out about it crimes are committed by very few people
[1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:33.200]  people always say well there was all these crimes going on it would be leaked
[1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:37.880]  there would be whistleblowers there are whistleblowers there's whistleblowers on
[1:16:37.880 --> 1:16:44.040]  9 11 speaking of the devil out in california the defense language school

[1:24:11.400 --> 1:24:25.060]  I have to apologize. I've said I googled the highest point in San Francisco this morning.
[1:24:25.060 --> 1:24:31.060]  The sports network says it's going to be underwater. And I'd said I found a 600-plus-foot
[1:24:31.060 --> 1:24:37.100]  hill. I'm sorry, it's Mount Davidson in San Francisco. It isn't really a mountain, they
[1:24:37.100 --> 1:24:44.500]  call it that. It's 900. I didn't print that sheet yet from their almanac. It's 930.
[1:24:44.500 --> 1:24:52.300]  Mount Davidson, how many feet is it? 938. Mount Davidson, 938 feet. So according to
[1:24:52.300 --> 1:25:00.320]  Schwarzenegger, water is going to raise 938 feet. Now, the United Nations says even with
[1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:08.500]  their cook numbers one foot or less. Well, it's now 938, according to Schwarzenegger.
[1:25:08.500 --> 1:25:13.700]  I looked up the sea level of Treasure Island. He said in his press conference it was going
[1:25:13.700 --> 1:25:19.980]  to be completely underwater. It's one of the bigger islands out in the channel. I was searching
[1:25:19.980 --> 1:25:23.180]  quickly this morning before I ran out the door and I believe it's 45 feet above sea
[1:25:23.180 --> 1:25:28.660]  level. But let's just do it again. I just want to read an article. Just the problem
[1:25:28.660 --> 1:25:33.180]  is they're frauds. Everything they say is a lie and a fraud. By the way, while we were
[1:25:33.180 --> 1:25:37.660]  searching sea levels, we happened to get tidal levels for the last 100-plus years measured
[1:25:37.660 --> 1:25:42.780]  from San Francisco. It's at the lowest point it's been since the early 1990s. The water
[1:25:42.780 --> 1:25:49.300]  level is lowering in San Francisco. And the few times that it's been higher was only for
[1:25:49.300 --> 1:25:54.620]  a day or so when there's been an offshore earthquake that thrust up underwater mountains
[1:25:54.620 --> 1:26:01.620]  and raised it a few feet. So it has nothing to do with man-made. I'm already getting into
[1:26:01.620 --> 1:26:06.820]  this and I'm going to get into it later. It's just I can't handle these people anymore.
[1:26:06.820 --> 1:26:11.060]  Schwarzenegger is as bad as Al Gore saying polar bears can't swim, one of the greatest
[1:26:11.060 --> 1:26:15.780]  land swimmers on earth and hunts seals on ice packs. They're not out there stranded.
[1:26:15.780 --> 1:26:21.540]  They showed children. A week ago on local TV, KVUE in Austin, they did another report saying
[1:26:21.540 --> 1:26:28.020]  polar bears are dying and can't swim. Polar bear numbers have more than tripled. There's
[1:26:28.020 --> 1:26:32.140]  people used to shoot them. Now the government stops you from it so they're breeding everywhere,
[1:26:32.140 --> 1:26:37.980]  running around attacking people. A polar bear will annihilate a grizzly bear. That's why
[1:26:37.980 --> 1:26:40.660]  there's not a lot of grizzly bears in their range because they'll kill them. It's the
[1:26:40.660 --> 1:26:47.900]  biggest bear in the world. There's no land animal meaner or tougher. It was originally
[1:26:47.900 --> 1:26:52.940]  known in the Greek translation to mean water bear because the sailors that saw them hundreds
[1:26:52.940 --> 1:26:56.740]  of years ago said these things are always swimming around. But doesn't matter if you're
[1:26:56.740 --> 1:27:00.700]  the greatest land swimmer. If Al Gore says he invented the Internet, he did it. And if
[1:27:00.700 --> 1:27:06.540]  Al Gore, in fact, right now outside our office, I talked about this yesterday, it's freezing
[1:27:06.540 --> 1:27:12.300]  and there's snowflakes coming down and there's a semiconductor factory a hundred yards from
[1:27:12.300 --> 1:27:21.060]  where I sit, maybe 130 yards. And they've got these big air conditioning heating systems
[1:27:21.060 --> 1:27:25.700]  and in the summer, you see nothing coming out of them. And in the winter, there's like
[1:27:25.700 --> 1:27:30.460]  a hundred foot white smoke coming out. The media always aims their cameras at stacks
[1:27:30.460 --> 1:27:34.380]  and says, oh, look at the smoke. There's nothing in it but water vapor. It's like when you
[1:27:34.380 --> 1:27:39.420]  breathe out, you in cold weather, you see what looks like smoke. It's not smoke. And
[1:27:39.420 --> 1:27:44.060]  I know most of you know that, but school kids don't. They're being taught that it's pollution
[1:27:44.060 --> 1:27:52.540]  coming out of power plants when nothing comes out of them, but water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[1:27:52.540 --> 1:27:59.020]  And so they go, look at all the pollution. Polar bears can't swim. Water vapor is evil.
[1:27:59.020 --> 1:28:02.020]  You know, this has given me a headache. I actually got a headache earlier when I walked
[1:28:02.020 --> 1:28:05.900]  out there and pulled up the numbers for the sea level in San Francisco and found out it's
[1:28:05.900 --> 1:28:11.860]  dropped the last eight years massively. And when I went and found out that it's 900 plus
[1:28:11.860 --> 1:28:17.060]  feet above sea level in San Francisco, we need to find the median or the average sea
[1:28:17.060 --> 1:28:23.660]  level. I mean, San Francisco is up on big old hills. Doesn't matter to Schwarzenegger,
[1:28:23.660 --> 1:28:29.260]  that un-American piece of trash. When he's not posing for gay porno mags, he's running
[1:28:29.260 --> 1:28:35.620]  around stealing from everybody and banning television sets above 40 inches. This guy
[1:28:35.620 --> 1:28:41.800]  is a usurper. He's an outlander. Get out of my country. You degenerate. We have nothing
[1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:46.100]  against Austria, nothing against Germany, but I'm not over in your country becoming
[1:28:46.100 --> 1:28:51.620]  your governor trying to rob you. He's a criminal pirate and we don't want him and we don't
[1:28:51.620 --> 1:28:57.460]  want Al Gore. And he is a criminal pirate, by the way, been caught in all sorts of inside
[1:28:57.460 --> 1:29:01.700]  scams and deals and working with Enron on the energy scam. And then they blamed it on
[1:29:01.700 --> 1:29:05.740]  Gray Davis. So he could come into power and I was fooled by all that.
[1:29:05.740 --> 1:29:12.740]  Gray Davis was a gun grabber. So I got behind the recall thinking it'd be some good Republican
[1:29:12.740 --> 1:29:19.540]  senator or something that would run. No, Schwarzenegger. He's left of Mao Zedong. And by the
[1:29:19.540 --> 1:29:23.140]  way, I don't want just Schwarzenegger protested everywhere and people to infiltrate his meetings
[1:29:23.140 --> 1:29:27.940]  and then scream the truth at him. I want Newt Gennrich, that New World Order pimp running
[1:29:27.940 --> 1:29:33.940]  around calling for global carbon taxes. I want him routed, not just that lying scam artist
[1:29:33.940 --> 1:29:38.580]  Al Gore. Even Limbaugh is calling him a crook now. Good job, Limbaugh. Finally waking up.
[1:29:38.580 --> 1:29:43.820]  These are criminals. These are criminals. These are criminals. They are criminals. They are
[1:29:43.820 --> 1:29:48.820]  criminals. They want to lie to your children, lie to you, take over your local governments
[1:29:48.820 --> 1:29:51.700]  and raise taxes.

[1:32:00.540 --> 1:32:05.220]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:32:05.220 --> 1:32:09.540]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:32:09.540 --> 1:32:13.860]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:32:13.860 --> 1:32:18.920]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[1:32:18.920 --> 1:32:23.580]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[1:32:23.580 --> 1:32:29.220]  is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:32:29.220 --> 1:32:33.540]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[1:32:33.540 --> 1:32:38.220]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[1:32:38.220 --> 1:32:42.420]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[1:32:42.420 --> 1:32:46.500]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can

[1:33:12.460 --> 1:33:18.100]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen. Live, live, live. We've been live for the last hour and
[1:33:18.100 --> 1:33:22.860]  33 minutes. I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central as 12 noon
[1:33:22.860 --> 1:33:28.780]  to 4 p.m. Eastern. I come back with an abbreviated live broadcast Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m. Because
[1:33:28.780 --> 1:33:33.100]  you can't stop the signal. You can't stop freedom. The people are standing up, getting
[1:33:33.100 --> 1:33:37.100]  involved, shattering the left-right paradigm. By the way, Jesse Ventura's television show
[1:33:37.100 --> 1:33:42.260]  that I was a major consultant on, and I also appear in quite a few of the episodes. The
[1:33:42.260 --> 1:33:51.500]  first episode aired Wednesday, the highest ratings ever for true TV, formerly Court TV.
[1:33:51.500 --> 1:33:56.540]  This is bigger opening ratings than Glenn Beck got with his first shows on Fox News. And
[1:33:56.540 --> 1:33:59.940]  the rating services, I'm going to go over this article later, are trending that by the
[1:33:59.940 --> 1:34:05.300]  end of the series, it's only a seven-parter for January, it'll probably have over 4 million
[1:34:05.300 --> 1:34:11.580]  viewers or dwarfing Glenn Beck. Man, I'm really excited because they've already told me if
[1:34:11.580 --> 1:34:15.540]  it gets picked back up, which I'm sure it will now, I'm going to be an even bigger part
[1:34:15.540 --> 1:34:21.420]  of the production as you heard Jesse Ventura say last week with us coming up. So very
[1:34:21.420 --> 1:34:27.060]  excited and people are shocked that it's anti-New World Order, it's our view, it's our angle,
[1:34:27.060 --> 1:34:30.700]  and people can't believe this is on television. They can't believe Ventura is going on Larry
[1:34:30.700 --> 1:34:34.940]  King Live's, you know, saying 9-Eleven's an inside job. They can't believe, yes, Ventura
[1:34:34.940 --> 1:34:40.860]  is for real. I really started waking him up with others about four years ago. And as
[1:34:40.860 --> 1:34:44.300]  he's talked about here on air, and he's got a book coming out about the New World Order,
[1:34:44.300 --> 1:34:51.820]  we're really educating him quickly. And so very, very exciting to see this happening.
[1:34:51.820 --> 1:34:57.180]  Ventura is not perfect, none of us are, but he's for real. He's real. What you see is
[1:34:57.180 --> 1:35:01.340]  what you get, and we are really educating him as you heard in that Hour Plus interview
[1:35:01.340 --> 1:35:06.340]  last week. So we're going to get into that. Let me tell you who's not real. This guy,
[1:35:06.340 --> 1:35:11.140]  Arnold Schwarzenegger. This guy is a complete fraud. Now you can prove everything he's
[1:35:11.140 --> 1:35:21.060]  saying is a fraud in about five minutes. Two segments ago, two breaks ago, I was here reading
[1:35:21.060 --> 1:35:35.340]  this global warming news article about Schwarzenegger, where he says that Treasure Island, Alcatraz,
[1:35:35.340 --> 1:35:42.020]  and much of San Francisco will be under as much as 35 to 40 feet of water. Now the United
[1:35:42.020 --> 1:35:50.820]  Nations IPCC, who has been caught cooking the books at three major universities, we
[1:35:50.820 --> 1:35:53.980]  have the emails between the universities, the head universities, their head climate
[1:35:53.980 --> 1:35:59.580]  centers engage in fraud, even with their cooked data, it's less than a foot that they're
[1:35:59.580 --> 1:36:06.740]  saying it's going to race. The White House science are is running around telling people
[1:36:06.740 --> 1:36:13.060]  13 feet, literally pulling it out of. Well, we have children listening. I'm not going
[1:36:13.060 --> 1:36:16.940]  to say where he's pulling it out from. You know what monkeys do at the zoo, though? The
[1:36:16.940 --> 1:36:22.540]  point is where do monkeys get what they throw? I'm sorry. I just can't handle it anymore.
[1:36:22.540 --> 1:36:26.780]  Schwarzenegger looks like such a monkey with it with his hair implants up on top and his
[1:36:26.780 --> 1:36:32.620]  little steroided out eyes. I mean, that guy is just a piece of trash. Get out of my country,
[1:36:32.620 --> 1:36:38.420]  you un-American piece of garbage. Just get out. Get out. Al Gore, get out of here, you
[1:36:38.420 --> 1:36:43.020]  piece of trash. All right. I'm not going to get mad. Been a long time since I've been
[1:36:43.020 --> 1:36:48.980]  in Alex Jones' rant. And you know when I rant? It's when I get a headache because it's
[1:36:48.980 --> 1:36:53.020]  like overload, like Robbie the robot cannot compute, cannot compute too much corruption,
[1:36:53.020 --> 1:36:56.980]  too much proof, too much fraud, hundreds of world leaders calling for global government,
[1:36:56.980 --> 1:37:01.740]  the public still dumbed down, not waking up, cannot compute, cannot compute. You know,
[1:37:01.740 --> 1:37:15.340]  and then I started screaming. But in one break, we Google the term highest point in San Francisco.
[1:37:15.340 --> 1:37:20.900]  Did you guys run me the mountain in the print offs yet? This just happened 10 minutes ago.
[1:37:20.900 --> 1:37:29.940]  938 feet. Put it up on screen. Mount Davidson is the highest point in San Francisco. I'm
[1:37:29.940 --> 1:37:37.860]  going to read off that in a moment. 900 feet. Now, yeah, it's going to be underwater, Schwarzenegger.
[1:37:37.860 --> 1:37:45.540]  A city on hills. But then in our first Google search, we put in sea level in San Francisco
[1:37:45.540 --> 1:37:51.220]  and instead got their title data of the last 100 years. And guess what it shows? Except
[1:37:51.220 --> 1:37:56.580]  for when there's earthquakes, the overall sea level of San Francisco is dropping. And
[1:37:56.580 --> 1:38:02.380]  in the last eight years, it's dropped a massive amount. The sea level is dropping. And of
[1:38:02.380 --> 1:38:06.980]  course, the earth was heating. Then it started cooling. Nine years ago is the internal climate
[1:38:06.980 --> 1:38:11.980]  data shows. And so, oh, eight years ago, blow that up on screen for people watching us at
[1:38:11.980 --> 1:38:19.340]  prisonplanet.tv. You average them together. You can see a few points where it raised when
[1:38:19.340 --> 1:38:24.860]  they had earthquakes and it's you go to the data page. It reports that. But you see an
[1:38:24.860 --> 1:38:29.340]  overall dropping since the last big earthquake in 2005. That was the only time it went up
[1:38:29.340 --> 1:38:34.340]  for a while. And then you see a drop this year from last year and the year before and
[1:38:34.340 --> 1:38:40.060]  the year before that. And then a dropping before that going back to before 2000. And
[1:38:40.060 --> 1:38:48.100]  then we have a 140 year graph because it's been a big seaport and the sailors are meticulous
[1:38:48.100 --> 1:38:56.420]  about recording those. So we have that recorded back to 1850. We have sea levels recorded
[1:38:56.420 --> 1:39:09.020]  in San Francisco to 1850. And from 1850 until 1940, there was a trend up several feet and
[1:39:09.020 --> 1:39:19.980]  then in 1940, a massive drop until 1960, a little bit of a rise, a little bit of a rise
[1:39:19.980 --> 1:39:27.300]  rising up into 1980 and now dropping. So there you have it. And of course, if these numbers
[1:39:27.300 --> 1:39:30.100]  showed it was spiking up, we'd have to go get our own numbers because the scientists
[1:39:30.100 --> 1:39:36.220]  all get caught lying. But again, these are numbers just collected by the, well, now
[1:39:36.220 --> 1:39:40.180]  the government of San Francisco and the federal government, but again, sailors have always
[1:39:40.180 --> 1:39:45.600]  had a penchant for recording sea levels. This is something they want to know and understand.
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:53.460]  But the issue is here is Schwarzenegger saying that, let me read the quote, global warming
[1:39:53.460 --> 1:39:57.820]  California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger puts his hand on top of a map over San Francisco
[1:39:57.820 --> 1:40:05.300]  Treasure Island to show how it could be submerged in just a century. And then they're putting
[1:40:05.300 --> 1:40:09.540]  out these tourist reports and saying, Oh, there won't be any wineries if it keeps heating.
[1:40:09.540 --> 1:40:14.500]  Oh, if you go back to the Middle Ages, the last time it really heated up, more wine
[1:40:14.500 --> 1:40:20.100]  was produced, more grapes, Northern England was growing good grapes. They can't now.
[1:40:20.100 --> 1:40:23.140]  So he lies about that and says, you're not going to have any wine. Oh, there won't be
[1:40:23.140 --> 1:40:27.180]  any snowboarding. You know, none of this is going to happen because Oh, and then he lies
[1:40:27.180 --> 1:40:31.900]  in the video and says, Oh, there's no water. Yeah, because it ate different major reservoirs,
[1:40:31.900 --> 1:40:36.060]  mountain reservoirs, the government for environmental reasons in the last two years, as you've seen
[1:40:36.060 --> 1:40:41.100]  all over television has cut the water off to the people. Just like Schwarzenegger and
[1:40:41.100 --> 1:40:45.420]  Enron cut the power off to everybody before he was even governor. He was involved in those
[1:40:45.420 --> 1:40:53.940]  meetings to jack up prices and make huge profits. He made money off that. So I need Paul Watson
[1:40:53.940 --> 1:41:00.420]  or Kurt Nemo or Aaron Dykes or Steve Watson, one of our writers to just go get the data
[1:41:00.420 --> 1:41:07.220]  and show that a, the UN itself says the water level is going to go up by one foot and they
[1:41:07.220 --> 1:41:10.780]  might be right because it fluctuates, might go down two feet, might go up five feet. The
[1:41:10.780 --> 1:41:17.620]  point is they're saying that Schwarzenegger is lying and saying much of San Francisco
[1:41:17.620 --> 1:41:21.820]  will be underwater. Ladies and gentlemen, I've been to San Francisco many times. You
[1:41:21.820 --> 1:41:25.540]  go back a quarter mile from the side of the ocean and you're in the hills. I mean, this
[1:41:25.540 --> 1:41:32.460]  is asinine. The UN says one foot, one foot, and that's a fraud. The truth is they don't
[1:41:32.460 --> 1:41:36.500]  know what's going to happen because the earth is always changing. First it's global freezing,
[1:41:36.500 --> 1:41:41.460]  then it's global warming. Now they say climate change. Every time it's hot in the summer,
[1:41:41.460 --> 1:41:45.580]  they tell kids on Nickelodeon, oh my God, we're all roasting. You know, it's hot outside
[1:41:45.580 --> 1:41:49.220]  because of global warming. No, it's hot because the earth, the part of the earth we're on
[1:41:49.220 --> 1:41:57.620]  is tilted towards the sun. I'm going to stop ranting. Just play the Schwarzenegger brainwashing
[1:41:57.620 --> 1:42:03.740]  video they put out. And then I'm going to play two days ago, John P. Holdren, the White
[1:42:03.740 --> 1:42:11.300]  House science are who wrote eco science. You know, I've been showing this book every
[1:42:11.300 --> 1:42:15.140]  day for the last year where the White House science are wrote, writes a textbook saying
[1:42:15.140 --> 1:42:18.940]  he wants to put poison in the water to sterilize you and wants to reduce world population under
[1:42:18.940 --> 1:42:24.820]  global government. These are quotes. Don't believe me. Just Google eco science. John
[1:42:24.820 --> 1:42:33.380]  P. Holdren, you'll get Reuters AP with the stinking quotes in it. This guy getting grilled.
[1:42:33.380 --> 1:42:38.980]  So that's coming up. But first let's play Schwarzenegger, the liar. Here it is. The
[1:42:38.980 --> 1:42:43.300]  tour that we're about to take is designed to promote awareness of the challenges that
[1:42:43.300 --> 1:42:47.820]  we face from climate change and the kind of things that we can do together to overcome
[1:42:47.820 --> 1:42:54.500]  those challenges. In California, you're already seeing this. When I was a bodybuilder, it
[1:42:54.500 --> 1:42:59.300]  came out, I would rip people off on shows I put on and the movie I made and never paid
[1:42:59.300 --> 1:43:04.860]  them. And I was always scamming everyone and laughing about how stupid everybody is and
[1:43:04.860 --> 1:43:09.700]  how I get it over on them and how pathetic. And I would hand out records of Hitler speeches
[1:43:09.700 --> 1:43:15.340]  to people and dressed up like a Nazi at parties and run into run into the gym screaming down
[1:43:15.340 --> 1:43:21.060]  with the blacks down with them. They're not humans. Oh, it's so funny. What I've done
[1:43:21.060 --> 1:43:28.620]  to everybody how stupid you are. I want your guns. I want open borders. There's 30% unemployment
[1:43:28.620 --> 1:43:34.180]  in many areas of California. Give me that article. I saw you guys printing it earlier.
[1:43:34.180 --> 1:43:39.980]  All of this is so funny. Now let me scare you like you're a bunch of little stupid children
[1:43:39.980 --> 1:43:46.140]  and tell you you're all going to drown. You're all going to drown. If you don't let me tax
[1:43:46.140 --> 1:43:51.980]  everything and if the legislature won't pass a law for me to ban TVs and tax them, then
[1:43:51.980 --> 1:43:57.740]  I'll just do it myself because I'm a dictator. I always dreamed of the being a dictator like
[1:43:57.740 --> 1:44:05.740]  Hitler. That's a quote Rolling Stone. Oh, El Centro holds position for highest jobless
[1:44:05.740 --> 1:44:16.620]  rate in the country. Seeing in money 32.2% 32% you like it. I know you do. I know you
[1:44:16.620 --> 1:44:22.340]  love it now. You're going to enjoy it a lot more that pull up Schwarzenegger race quotes.
[1:44:22.340 --> 1:44:26.620]  I want everybody to see this live on TV and radio. Just go to Google or start page dot
[1:44:26.620 --> 1:44:33.020]  com or the other great search engine and type in Schwarzenegger Hitler quotes and I didn't
[1:44:33.020 --> 1:44:38.180]  when I made martial law that has a section on Schwarzenegger in 2005. I didn't just believe
[1:44:38.180 --> 1:44:44.100]  the newspapers about this. I actually ordered the Rolling Stone where he gave the interview
[1:44:44.100 --> 1:44:48.540]  saying I've all I've always dreamed about powerful people like Hitler and being worshiped
[1:44:48.540 --> 1:44:52.940]  like no longer like a dictator. I want to be king of the world. I'm going to be king
[1:44:52.940 --> 1:44:58.860]  of the world and you're not going to be able to top me. You're not going to be able to
[1:44:58.860 --> 1:45:06.020]  top me because you're also stupid and one thing and I never get over how pathetic people
[1:45:06.020 --> 1:45:12.580]  are dumb. They are. I love to dominate stupid people. I'm not stupid. Get out of here. You
[1:45:12.580 --> 1:45:19.180]  supper crook. All these stupid Republican groups don't talk about army. We like it.
[1:45:19.180 --> 1:45:29.500]  Put in our guns. No, just bring up Arnold Schwarzenegger Hitler quote. Arnold Schwarzenegger
[1:45:29.500 --> 1:45:35.700]  quotes Rolling Stones. That'll get it for you. I wouldn't use Yahoo. Sorry, they don't
[1:45:35.700 --> 1:45:45.100]  have the best search engine in town. No offense to Yahoo. Okay, whatever. We'll pull those
[1:45:45.100 --> 1:45:50.980]  quotes up. They're in my film martial law to with copies of the Rolling Stone and others.
[1:45:50.980 --> 1:45:54.740]  They were going to release a few years ago. The outtakes of him saying it on video for
[1:45:54.740 --> 1:45:58.500]  pumping iron, but he bought the film for like five times what it was worth just so that
[1:45:58.500 --> 1:46:06.140]  wouldn't be released. Schwarzenegger now owns pumping iron. I'm going to go ahead now.
[1:46:06.140 --> 1:46:11.580]  Like I said, you'll want to search it in another search engine. I want to go ahead and just
[1:46:11.580 --> 1:46:15.580]  play finish up with Schwarzenegger. Then I'm going to play Holdren being grilled. Stay
[1:46:15.580 --> 1:46:23.140]  with us. Average temperatures in our state rose nearly two degrees. And if greenhouse
[1:46:23.140 --> 1:46:28.780]  gas emissions are not substantially reduced, scientists tell us that temperatures in California
[1:46:28.780 --> 1:46:35.220]  could rise an additional seven degrees during this century. Back it up. Back it up. I mean,
[1:46:35.220 --> 1:46:41.940]  this is just all lies. He uses the same IPCC hockey stick graph right there. That's all
[1:46:41.940 --> 1:46:48.860]  another scandal. I'll guarantee you that that's a fraud right there. When they have fires,
[1:46:48.860 --> 1:46:52.980]  everybody in LA knows the police know you have nuts that go around setting fires everywhere
[1:46:52.980 --> 1:46:58.620]  when the winds get up every year and they go, look, the fires, the global warming, the
[1:46:58.620 --> 1:47:04.700]  global warming, you're giving me your money. No, it's that you got 10 million people in
[1:47:04.700 --> 1:47:08.620]  LA with a couple thousand lunatics that go into the rich areas and try to burn everything
[1:47:08.620 --> 1:47:14.300]  down because they hate wealth. It's not the global warming doing it. Let's go back to
[1:47:14.300 --> 1:47:20.340]  the global warming man. I am all Schwarzenegger. Here he is. And if greenhouse gas emissions
[1:47:20.340 --> 1:47:25.300]  are not substantially reduced, scientists tell us that temperatures in California could
[1:47:25.300 --> 1:47:30.500]  rise an additional seven degrees during this century. Oh, yeah. Perhaps one of the greatest
[1:47:30.500 --> 1:47:35.980]  risks from climate change is a less reliable water supply. The Californians have long
[1:47:35.980 --> 1:47:41.820]  struggled to find a long struggle. See, he knows that people are aware of the water
[1:47:41.820 --> 1:47:47.900]  supply and the fact the government's cutting it off at every front, but they don't care.
[1:47:47.900 --> 1:47:51.300]  He's going to tell you humans have never had problems with water supply and we shouldn't
[1:47:51.300 --> 1:47:55.900]  dig more wells or build desalination or not let the government keep the water back. No,
[1:47:55.900 --> 1:48:03.100]  it's climate change is doing it back to the liar. In those shortages, I expected to get
[1:48:03.100 --> 1:48:08.620]  worse as temperatures rise and as we lose our precious Sierra snow pack projects and
[1:48:08.620 --> 1:48:13.900]  shown here indicate that if global warming continues unabated, the spring snow pack in
[1:48:13.900 --> 1:48:19.700]  a Sierra Nevada will virtually disappear by the end of the century. This would pose extreme
[1:48:19.700 --> 1:48:26.540]  challenges to water managers, hamper hydropower generation and nearly eliminate skiing, snowboarding
[1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:33.380]  and other recreational activities. Now, another area of concern for California is our 1,100
[1:48:33.380 --> 1:48:40.740]  miles of scenic coastline. Our coast, home to over 25 million people, is vulnerable to
[1:48:40.740 --> 1:48:47.940]  a range of natural hazards, including storms, high tides and rising sea levels. By investing
[1:48:47.940 --> 1:48:54.260]  in green technology, we can create a new economic foundation for the 21st century that is built
[1:48:54.260 --> 1:49:00.580]  on clean fuel, clean energy and clean cars. Now, one terrific example is for instance,
[1:49:00.580 --> 1:49:05.700]  the car company called Tesla Motors. Tesla manufactures. That's enough from him and you
[1:49:05.700 --> 1:49:10.340]  can go watch his press conference online saying San Francisco will be under water and they
[1:49:10.340 --> 1:49:15.980]  can decode things like clean cars, new technology sounds good, it's taxes. They just put a bunch
[1:49:15.980 --> 1:49:19.940]  of things that sound reasonable up front so people hear it and it sounds reasonable and
[1:49:19.940 --> 1:49:25.060]  they can get on board with it. Now, remember, Schwarzenegger got in trouble with Kirk Volltime,
[1:49:25.060 --> 1:49:29.420]  the top Nazi, who was also the head of the UN, turned out the UN knew he was an SS officer
[1:49:29.420 --> 1:49:35.420]  just like Schwarzenegger's dad. And Volltime of course was a eugenicist for world population
[1:49:35.420 --> 1:49:40.340]  reduction. So of course, Schwarzenegger is going to be for eugenics. Global warming is
[1:49:40.340 --> 1:49:45.860]  the eugenics front. They're excused to shut off your resources. Now, when we come back
[1:49:45.860 --> 1:49:52.660]  from break, I am going to, yeah, you can go to ArnoldExpose.com. You notice you found
[1:49:52.660 --> 1:49:58.260]  one of my websites and that actually has the quotes. Go to the quotes. See on the side,
[1:49:58.260 --> 1:50:06.540]  it says the quote links and it has his quotes. I thought about the fame about just being
[1:50:06.540 --> 1:50:10.980]  the greatest. I was dreaming about being some dictator of a country or some savior like
[1:50:10.980 --> 1:50:14.620]  Jesus.
[1:50:14.620 --> 1:50:19.700]  My relationship to power and authority is I'm all for it. Arnold Schwarzenegger, US
[1:50:19.700 --> 1:50:25.660]  News and World Report 1990. People need somebody to watch over them. 95% of the people in the
[1:50:25.660 --> 1:50:30.620]  world need to be told what to do and how to behave. Arnold Schwarzenegger, US News and
[1:50:30.620 --> 1:50:35.380]  World Report. My friends don't want me to mention Kurt's name because of all the recent
[1:50:35.380 --> 1:50:40.620]  Nazi stuff and the Eugenics controversy, but I love him and Maria does too. And so thank
[1:50:40.620 --> 1:50:46.100]  you Kurt. Arnold Schwarzenegger on his friend and fellow Austrian Kurt Volta, the Nazi war
[1:50:46.100 --> 1:50:50.620]  criminal. I was born to be a leader. I love the fact that millions of people look up to
[1:50:50.620 --> 1:50:55.820]  me. I'll find you some Hitler quotes here in a minute. We'll be right back, ladies and
[1:50:55.820 --> 1:51:01.780]  gentlemen. Stay with us. We'll show you Holdren being grilled straight ahead.
[1:51:01.780 --> 1:51:05.340]  Things have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary
[1:51:05.340 --> 1:51:09.780]  to maintain good health with so many places to choose from deciding where and what to

[1:51:57.260 --> 1:52:05.420]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[1:52:05.420 --> 1:52:10.220]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[1:52:10.220 --> 1:52:14.060]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[1:52:14.060 --> 1:52:17.540]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[1:52:17.540 --> 1:52:22.100]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect

[1:54:02.580 --> 1:54:08.940]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[1:54:08.940 --> 1:54:11.140]  a war on for your mind.
[1:54:11.140 --> 1:54:15.060]  Standing up to scammers, crooks, criminals, usurpers everywhere. Thank you for joining
[1:54:15.060 --> 1:54:19.380]  us. This is a 5.5-minute clip. This segment's 5 minutes. We're going to play part of it.
[1:54:19.380 --> 1:54:22.940]  Come back with the rest and Bob Chapman and your phone calls will shift into the economy
[1:54:22.940 --> 1:54:28.220]  and a bunch of other climate-gate news that's coming out as their whole fraud crashes and
[1:54:28.220 --> 1:54:34.500]  burns beautifully. But here's Senator Sensenbrenner grilling the chief eugenicist, the White House
[1:54:34.500 --> 1:54:39.620]  science czar, John P. Holdren. Here is that video and audio.
[1:54:39.620 --> 1:54:46.060]  Back to the emails that ended up being placed in the public record. And I don't want to
[1:54:46.060 --> 1:54:51.420]  get to whether or not they were legally placed in the public record. The question is whether
[1:54:51.420 --> 1:54:56.700]  or not they were accurate. Because if they were accurate, it's profoundly disturbing.
[1:54:56.700 --> 1:55:02.420]  And it does end up putting the question all of the size of climate change.
[1:55:02.420 --> 1:55:09.740]  Now, the data from the Climate Research Unit at the UEA in England is one of only three
[1:55:09.740 --> 1:55:17.780]  major data sets, but they considerably overlap. And they've been used as a basis for the IPCC
[1:55:17.780 --> 1:55:22.900]  report, as well as the U.S. Global Change Research Program. And that means that these
[1:55:22.900 --> 1:55:28.300]  two booklets that were passed out this morning, you know, at best need to have a thorough
[1:55:28.300 --> 1:55:34.260]  review in the light of this information that has been disclosed. And at worst, it's junk
[1:55:34.260 --> 1:55:39.420]  science and it is a part of a massive international scientific fraud.
[1:55:39.420 --> 1:55:44.780]  Now, Dr. Holdren, you've been in the middle of a lot of this. And I've got a couple of
[1:55:44.780 --> 1:55:51.620]  questions based upon your statements before you joined the Obama administration. You gave
[1:55:51.620 --> 1:55:59.900]  an interview in August of 2006 with BBC News in the U.K. And you said that a sea level
[1:55:59.900 --> 1:56:07.420]  rise of up to 13 feet was in the realm of possibility. However, that's 11 feet higher
[1:56:07.420 --> 1:56:13.860]  than what the IPCC has estimated over this period of time, which is somewhere between
[1:56:13.860 --> 1:56:20.260]  7 and 23 inches. Now, with respect to the hockey stick theory, which the chairman has
[1:56:20.260 --> 1:56:29.340]  referred to, that's been pretty much discredited in the scientific community. And yet, near
[1:56:29.340 --> 1:56:37.660]  October 13th email, which is now in the public record, you aggressively attacked the two scientists
[1:56:37.660 --> 1:56:47.820]  that put this together, a Dr. Willie Soon and a Dr. Sally Ballyunis for that.
[1:56:47.820 --> 1:56:55.660]  Now, I think it's pretty clear that in both cases you were wrong. And I guess I'd like
[1:56:55.660 --> 1:57:00.140]  to know if you're concerned now that you're in the White House and representing all of
[1:57:00.140 --> 1:57:05.180]  the public, whether you're concerned about the misrepresentation of the state of science
[1:57:05.180 --> 1:57:11.100]  with respect to global warming. And I'd also like to know if you still support the principal
[1:57:11.100 --> 1:57:21.300]  critic of those who trashed the hockey stick theory, and that is a Dr. Michael Mann, knowing
[1:57:21.300 --> 1:57:27.300]  of his efforts now to hide his data and to encourage his colleagues to shut out journals
[1:57:27.300 --> 1:57:32.380]  like climate research to publish works contrary to his own bias.
[1:57:32.380 --> 1:57:40.220]  Congressman, let me try to take those in the order you asked them. And the very first part
[1:57:40.220 --> 1:57:45.820]  of your statement, with respect, I would disagree with you that this current uproar calls into
[1:57:45.820 --> 1:57:50.820]  question all of climate science. I do not believe that it were going to come back and
[1:57:50.820 --> 1:57:56.980]  finish the last few minutes of pinhead up there lying. But you notice he said uproar.
[1:57:56.980 --> 1:58:01.940]  They know it's an uproar. That's why Gore is now canceling a lot of his speaking engagements
[1:58:01.940 --> 1:58:06.140]  and in Copenhagen canceling his big engagement because everywhere they go, people are shouting
[1:58:06.140 --> 1:58:10.900]  them down bringing up climate. They just can't sit up there and push their fraud now without
[1:58:10.900 --> 1:58:16.700]  being challenged. People are challenging them everywhere. And so they're kind of retreating
[1:58:16.700 --> 1:58:20.460]  for now, hoping we forget about this so they can come back and continue setting up their
[1:58:20.460 --> 1:58:24.980]  global government. And that's Bandkai Moon, head of the U.N. Secretary General saying
[1:58:24.980 --> 1:58:29.580]  the carbon tax is the funding mechanism for the world government. That's what I report
[1:58:29.580 --> 1:58:35.020]  in my film, Fall of the Republic. It exposes the whole climate gate fraud. That's why everybody
[1:58:35.020 --> 1:58:40.340]  needs to get it on DVD and infowars.com and get a free Obama t-shirt, anti-Obama t-shirt
[1:58:40.340 --> 1:58:47.260]  when they do America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade.

[2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:48.140]  fraud now into week number two and here's Holdren after he was just exposed as a fraud
[2:00:48.140 --> 2:00:52.100]  saying, well, I don't think this uproar brings into question that sea levels are going to
[2:00:52.100 --> 2:00:56.440]  rise 13 feet when no one's saying that but him and Schwarzenegger literally just making
[2:00:56.440 --> 2:01:01.500]  this up and sea levels have actually dropped in San Francisco. Here we go. Here's the rest
[2:01:01.500 --> 2:01:08.100]  of it. Take those in the order you asked them and the very first part of your statement.
[2:01:08.100 --> 2:01:13.460]  With respect, I would disagree with you that this current uproar calls into question all
[2:01:13.460 --> 2:01:16.460]  of climate science. I do not believe that it remotely has that.
[2:01:16.460 --> 2:01:21.160]  Well, sir, I didn't say that. I said it ought to be looked at again and there's increasing
[2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:26.780]  evidence of scientific fascism that's going on and I think as policymakers who are making
[2:01:26.780 --> 2:01:31.940]  decisions about the state of the American economy for the next several generations that
[2:01:31.940 --> 2:01:36.820]  we ought to have accurate science and it appears there's enough question on whether the science
[2:01:36.820 --> 2:01:42.780]  we have is accurate. That's got to be. Yeah, yeah, back up a few seconds. That's key. See,
[2:01:42.780 --> 2:01:46.780]  this is a private group of banks that are openly Goldman Sachs and others financing
[2:01:46.780 --> 2:01:51.780]  the carbon taxes. Al Gore and others where you will pay taxes directly to them, then
[2:01:51.780 --> 2:01:56.980]  they give some of it to the U.N. And they share it with your local communities, hence federalizing
[2:01:56.980 --> 2:02:04.540]  internationalizing and privatizing. This is piracy. This is a takeover of our entire economy.
[2:02:04.540 --> 2:02:09.460]  They said they want to abolish coal powered fuel. 51% of our power comes from coal. This
[2:02:09.460 --> 2:02:16.060]  is a total hijacking by these criminals that want a monopoly. This is a takeover. Go back
[2:02:16.060 --> 2:02:23.140]  to it. Several generations that we ought to have accurate science and it appears there's
[2:02:23.140 --> 2:02:27.620]  enough question on whether the science we have is accurate. That's got to be resolved
[2:02:27.620 --> 2:02:31.940]  and I wish we could have done it in this hearing, but the chairman wouldn't let us. Go ahead.
[2:02:31.940 --> 2:02:37.820]  I very much agree that we need to resolve the current issue. It's important to understand
[2:02:37.820 --> 2:02:42.300]  what has really gone on here to get to the bottom of it. As I indicated before, that's
[2:02:42.300 --> 2:02:45.980]  been one of the strengths of science over the years, the capacity to get to the bottom
[2:02:45.980 --> 2:02:52.460]  of the controversies that emerge in this book. Ecoscience where he says he wants to drug
[2:02:52.460 --> 2:02:57.020]  the water supply to sterilize you and set up a planetary regime to carry out forced one
[2:02:57.020 --> 2:03:01.060]  child policies. They're now teaching that in public schools worldwide. Right here in
[2:03:01.060 --> 2:03:04.740]  the U.S. It's being taught. We have the U.N. documents where they talk about other brainwashing
[2:03:04.740 --> 2:03:09.300]  your kids through the Department of Education. In here, he said we were going to have an
[2:03:09.300 --> 2:03:22.540]  ice age by 2000. He wrote this in what 1976? Was it 1974? I've got Ecoscience. 1977. Where's
[2:03:22.540 --> 2:03:27.300]  the ice age? You are a scientific fraud by design and you're not going to investigate
[2:03:27.300 --> 2:03:32.220]  your own scientist engaged in fraud for you. You're in the emails, Holdren. You're involved
[2:03:32.220 --> 2:03:37.660]  in the fraud, you criminal. Back to him. We will get to the bottom of this one, but the
[2:03:37.660 --> 2:03:43.940]  key point is, however, this particular controversy comes out, the result will not call into question
[2:03:43.940 --> 2:03:49.340]  the bulk of our understanding of how the climate works or how humans are affecting it.
[2:03:49.340 --> 2:03:53.500]  You mentioned an interview of mine a few years ago.
[2:03:53.500 --> 2:04:02.260]  I can't help it. The U.N. Zone IPCC fairy tale says that the ocean is going to be between
[2:04:02.260 --> 2:04:08.060]  seven inches and 23 inches, but you really read they say the means about one foot, 12
[2:04:08.060 --> 2:04:13.860]  inches. Then he says it's settled that men, that man is changing the climate. The U.N.
[2:04:13.860 --> 2:04:19.860]  Zone report says man is three to 4% of the gases that they claim are heating things up.
[2:04:19.860 --> 2:04:25.380]  It's a fraud. One volcano puts out more than man's put out in the last 100 years. He's
[2:04:25.380 --> 2:04:30.460]  a complete liar. Let's come back from break. Play the last minute of this and then go to
[2:04:30.460 --> 2:04:34.340]  Bob Chapman, but I'm really getting a headache here. Just looking at this. This is a sinister
[2:04:34.340 --> 2:04:45.980]  little eugenicist, little population reducer. This guy makes me sick. Stay where this Bob
[2:04:45.980 --> 2:04:49.540]  Chapman coming up with the latest with the fellow reserve being rounded. So much other
[2:04:49.540 --> 2:04:54.180]  good news. More on climate. Get your phone calls. We'll be right back on the other side.
[2:04:54.180 --> 2:04:58.540]  This is the one, the only GCN radio network. We're also simulcasting via television at

[2:05:06.380 --> 2:05:11.980]  This is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[2:05:11.980 --> 2:05:16.580]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence
[2:05:16.580 --> 2:05:21.940]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent
[2:05:21.940 --> 2:05:27.860]  upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the
[2:05:27.860 --> 2:05:33.500]  enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:05:33.500 --> 2:05:38.420]  and on its ashes, constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists, they're
[2:05:38.420 --> 2:05:42.580]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to today
[2:05:42.580 --> 2:05:48.580]  seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, DC, we have seen a fall of
[2:05:48.580 --> 2:05:55.060]  the republic. Get your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at info wars.com or watching

[2:08:13.420 --> 2:08:19.660]  Holdren a criminal, he's involved with the criminal emails helping cover it up, helping persecute scientists
[2:08:19.660 --> 2:08:24.540]  that were telling the truth. And he's involved wanting to bring in an economic system that will
[2:08:24.540 --> 2:08:31.340]  at least double our energy prices. That's only one facet of it and will devastate American families
[2:08:31.340 --> 2:08:36.060]  for his own profit and Al Gore's profit. Now if that is it criminal, as Lord Moncton has said, they
[2:08:36.060 --> 2:08:40.220]  should all be arrested. And Lord Moncton wouldn't come out with that unless we had clear evidence.
[2:08:40.220 --> 2:08:45.100]  These people are despicable. Let's finish up with Holdren. Here it is. In which I talked about the
[2:08:45.100 --> 2:08:51.340]  possibility of a sea level rise in this century as much as 13 feet. That was based on scientific
[2:08:51.340 --> 2:08:56.380]  peer-reviewed publications that appeared in the early 2000s. Good pause. That indicated that over
[2:08:57.500 --> 2:09:01.980]  and all of that data came from these three climate research units that are all together
[2:09:01.980 --> 2:09:07.660]  in the emails cooking the books. See, they keep saying, okay, forget climate, we have peer-reviewed
[2:09:07.660 --> 2:09:13.900]  journals that are based on the fraud. See, everything he says is a debunkable lie instantly when you
[2:09:13.900 --> 2:09:20.140]  know the facts. Back to Holdren. The logic time in periods of natural climate change. There had
[2:09:20.140 --> 2:09:25.260]  been episodes in which the rate of sea level rise increased by as much as two to five meters per
[2:09:25.260 --> 2:09:30.060]  century and that this could not be ruled out at the temperatures for which we were heading
[2:09:30.060 --> 2:09:36.940]  in the 21st century as a result of our activity. You're still 11 feet above what the IPCC was
[2:09:36.940 --> 2:09:43.980]  recommending. My time is almost up and I'd just like to say that there's an awful lot of scientific
[2:09:43.980 --> 2:09:51.340]  McCarthyism, meaning name calling going on, because I quote from your email of October 13th, 2003,
[2:09:51.340 --> 2:09:58.060]  saying, doing this will reveal that soon and Baliunas are essentially amateurs in the interpretation
[2:09:58.060 --> 2:10:04.780]  of historical and paleoclimatology records of climate change. You're not dealing with their
[2:10:04.780 --> 2:10:09.420]  issue, you're calling them names. And I think we ought to get to the bottom of this without having
[2:10:09.420 --> 2:10:16.060]  the name calling. And I wish that you, as the president's science advisor and a former employee
[2:10:16.060 --> 2:10:20.540]  of one of the most distinguished universities in the world, would be able to get beyond the
[2:10:20.540 --> 2:10:25.900]  name calling and get to it. My time is up and I yield back. I would be happy to answer all of
[2:10:25.900 --> 2:10:33.100]  the congressman's questions if I'm allowed. You will be given enough time, but let me turn
[2:10:33.100 --> 2:10:37.100]  right now and recognize the gentleman from Washington state. Yeah, let's not let that
[2:10:37.100 --> 2:10:43.500]  information come out. Bob Chapman was in army intelligence. Bob Chapman had the biggest private
[2:10:43.500 --> 2:10:48.220]  newsletter till he retired. He came back one of the biggest again, the international forecaster.com.
[2:10:48.220 --> 2:10:53.660]  Bob has been at one time the biggest private silver and gold broker. And we always enjoy
[2:10:53.660 --> 2:10:58.540]  having him visit with us at least once a week here on the Friday edition. Bob, before we get
[2:10:58.540 --> 2:11:03.180]  into the economy and the manipulation of gold and what's happening with the dollar and the stock market
[2:11:03.180 --> 2:11:07.500]  and the economy and the real unemployment numbers and the fellow reserve being around it and that
[2:11:07.500 --> 2:11:12.220]  huge victory that's happening with it passing out a committee. They clearly have the votes to vote
[2:11:12.220 --> 2:11:17.580]  for an audit in the house with a super majority. Before we get into all that, climate gate,
[2:11:17.580 --> 2:11:23.100]  your take on what we're witnessing, Bob Chapman. Well, I never thought you'd ask because I've
[2:11:23.100 --> 2:11:29.900]  just done about 30 radio programs on it. And one of the things that I uncovered was that,
[2:11:29.900 --> 2:11:33.660]  and I don't know if you mentioned it or not, because I just cut in toward the end,
[2:11:34.460 --> 2:11:42.460]  the CRU received $23 million in taxpayers funds. Did you highlight that? Yes, we wrote stories
[2:11:42.460 --> 2:11:48.060]  about that last week. That's just one funding group going to Professor Phil Jones at East Anglia.
[2:11:48.060 --> 2:11:56.780]  Yeah, Phil is no longer there, as you well know. I guess his comment was it was so gracious of
[2:11:56.780 --> 2:12:05.660]  them to let me go. And I think he's extremely worried about getting criminal charges brought
[2:12:05.660 --> 2:12:10.620]  against him. And of course, the university didn't want to have anything to do with him anymore.
[2:12:10.620 --> 2:12:19.020]  The phrase was, I am so grateful to the university for agreeing to this. But anyway,
[2:12:19.020 --> 2:12:24.220]  it is... And that's for those that don't know, Phil Jones is the head kingpin for the UN over
[2:12:24.220 --> 2:12:29.820]  all the universities getting this data together. This is the head guy caught with Holdren and
[2:12:29.820 --> 2:12:37.260]  everybody else engaged in fraud. Well, hopefully this will stop cap and trade and knock the Copenhagen
[2:12:37.260 --> 2:12:43.900]  meeting on its ear. And I don't know whether that'll happen because these people are so arrogant,
[2:12:43.900 --> 2:12:50.700]  they don't care what happens. They do what they want to do. But I think we got them on the run here,
[2:12:51.260 --> 2:12:55.900]  and especially with Congress getting into it quickly the way that they have,
[2:12:56.620 --> 2:13:02.940]  it just shows you how criminal these people are. So we switch away from
[2:13:02.940 --> 2:13:10.700]  academic fraud to financial fraud. And the financial fraud, of course, is going on on Wall
[2:13:10.700 --> 2:13:16.220]  Street. And the same fraudsters from Wall Street are the ones Kinley and others and Madoff that
[2:13:16.220 --> 2:13:21.180]  engineered this and are working with Al Gore and others. Break that down as a segue into the economy.
[2:13:22.540 --> 2:13:31.420]  Well, the whole thing is about taxation. And so is the Copenhagen. And they want to hit them
[2:13:31.420 --> 2:13:40.380]  on both of them. They have taxpayers from Western Europe and the United States for about 20% increase
[2:13:40.380 --> 2:13:47.420]  in their taxation from each. So if you pay in 30% and five to the state, and you get 40 on top of
[2:13:47.420 --> 2:13:54.700]  that, you're in for 75 plus all the little taxes. So it's pretty devastating. And it's really a tax
[2:13:54.700 --> 2:14:02.380]  enslavement. It is Bob. So much is going on with this. We'll get back into it later and
[2:14:02.380 --> 2:14:07.980]  take some phone calls. But where do you want to start the good news with open talk by Senator
[2:14:07.980 --> 2:14:15.100]  Sanders and others of blocking the confirmation, the reconformation of the private Fed Chairman,
[2:14:15.100 --> 2:14:19.980]  Ben Bernanke, the fact that, as you know, a week and a half ago, it passed out a committee to audit
[2:14:19.980 --> 2:14:25.340]  the Fed. It looks like the Senate may try to block it. But still, this is a huge success.
[2:14:25.340 --> 2:14:28.060]  Or the lies about unemployment numbers. Where do we begin?
[2:14:29.260 --> 2:14:34.620]  Well, the unemployment numbers are to be expected. And the scenario today, and I don't know if Ted
[2:14:34.620 --> 2:14:41.500]  is coming on later, but he would have something strong to say about this. But the unemployment
[2:14:41.500 --> 2:14:48.220]  numbers are totally bogus. I'll show you the coincidence of events that happened last Thursday
[2:14:48.220 --> 2:14:54.620]  when Dubai was announced. And, of course, they picked that day because the American market was
[2:14:54.620 --> 2:15:00.620]  closed. And they did that so that the market wouldn't fall 500 points. It only fell 150.
[2:15:00.620 --> 2:15:07.660]  And it was managing the Dow Jones Industrial and S&P and Nasdaq indexes, if you may.
[2:15:08.380 --> 2:15:14.300]  At the same time, they had a goal for $50. It came back to a minus 12. The following day,
[2:15:14.300 --> 2:15:21.100]  it went up, and then Monday the same. And then, of course, they came in today and attacked voraciously.
[2:15:21.100 --> 2:15:27.100]  They hit goals for $50 again like they did before. And they're not hitting the physical market.
[2:15:27.100 --> 2:15:31.580]  They're hitting it with derivatives. And they did the same thing with silver, but not in this
[2:15:31.580 --> 2:15:40.460]  big a way. And they have the dollar up almost a point today on the USDX index. This is all
[2:15:40.460 --> 2:15:52.140]  coordinated. The numbers come out. The numbers are phony. The Dubai thing, they knew about that for
[2:15:52.140 --> 2:15:57.900]  months. They just picked a date and coordinated all this together. And so what's going to happen?
[2:15:58.620 --> 2:16:03.020]  The dollar's going to go back down again because there's too many sellers out there.
[2:16:03.020 --> 2:16:07.580]  Gold and silver are going to go back up again. So it gives you a great opportunity to be a buyer
[2:16:07.580 --> 2:16:14.060]  when you wouldn't normally have this opportunity. And the stock markets are going to start getting
[2:16:14.060 --> 2:16:23.340]  weaker again. And they'll paper Dubai over probably over the next several years. It looks to be that
[2:16:23.340 --> 2:16:30.780]  they're probably offside over there somewhere between $80 and $120 billion, which in the
[2:16:30.780 --> 2:16:37.580]  circumference of everything is really not a great amount. It might seem that it is, but nowadays when
[2:16:37.580 --> 2:16:44.860]  you have the Fed lending out $12.7 trillion, another $100 billion is easy to cover up.
[2:16:44.860 --> 2:16:49.420]  Well, let me stop you for a moment because you're an expert on this and I'm not. We had Dr. Paul
[2:16:49.420 --> 2:16:53.180]  Craig Roberts on two weeks ago who for those that don't know is a former editor of the Wall
[2:16:53.180 --> 2:16:59.100]  Street Journal, former head of policy department of treasury under Reagan. And he predicted on air
[2:16:59.100 --> 2:17:04.380]  that the dollar in the next few weeks would go back up because of this reverse carry trade that
[2:17:04.380 --> 2:17:09.900]  they have to cover themselves. And can you explain that to people and that gold will go down for a
[2:17:09.900 --> 2:17:14.620]  while, but then go back up even higher because they can drive stuff down now as part of their
[2:17:14.620 --> 2:17:20.700]  manipulation, but they can't hold it down. That's true. And we brought this out. You and I in this
[2:17:20.700 --> 2:17:25.740]  program a number of times, they affect the market for a day or two or three. And that's it. And it's
[2:17:25.740 --> 2:17:31.020]  the same thing with the currency market. A goodness, they trade over $4 trillion a day on the forex,
[2:17:31.740 --> 2:17:37.820]  of which probably two to two and a half trillion is in dollars. And so you try to manipulate that
[2:17:37.820 --> 2:17:45.100]  market more than one day, forget it. And it's going to be a coordinated effort where all of the bids
[2:17:45.100 --> 2:17:51.900]  on the other currencies in the USDX are hit. And then that's what they're doing. They're not making
[2:17:51.900 --> 2:17:58.060]  the dollar go up. They're making the other ones go down. The other ones being the pound, the end,
[2:17:58.060 --> 2:18:06.620]  the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, and the British pound, and the Swedish corona. And so
[2:18:06.620 --> 2:18:13.260]  they just hit the bids on them. And that was what the $500 billion currency swap was all about
[2:18:13.260 --> 2:18:21.740]  about six or seven months ago, because the other five nations that were involved received dollars.
[2:18:21.740 --> 2:18:27.100]  And they take those dollars and they go to buy treasures with them, US treasures. At the same
[2:18:27.100 --> 2:18:33.260]  time, the foreign currencies that were received by the Federal Reserve, they take those foreign
[2:18:33.260 --> 2:18:38.540]  currencies and they go in and sell them, making the foreign currencies go down and making the
[2:18:38.540 --> 2:18:44.220]  dollar go up. That's the game they're playing. And that's what Chapman you've said in the past in
[2:18:44.220 --> 2:18:49.260]  the last few weeks. That's exactly what Roberts said. What's the time frame then for gold that's
[2:18:49.260 --> 2:18:56.940]  down $45 today? It's at $1,162. What's the best-guest time frame on when it'll go back up and when
[2:18:56.940 --> 2:19:03.420]  the dollar's going to drop? Middle of next week? Probably. And another thing, too, is for those
[2:19:03.420 --> 2:19:10.540]  of you who, and I'm going to try to make this as simple as possible, in the pits of the comics,
[2:19:11.660 --> 2:19:16.860]  there are what they call the commercial traders in both silver and gold. And in this case,
[2:19:17.420 --> 2:19:22.220]  they're the same play as to some extent. JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, City Group,
[2:19:22.780 --> 2:19:31.180]  Hong Kong, Shanghai Bank, etc. And in gold, they have a short position, net, because they have
[2:19:31.180 --> 2:19:39.900]  longs and shorts at the same time, net of 306,000 contracts. That's the highest it's ever been.
[2:19:41.100 --> 2:19:47.740]  A normal contract for the short position for the commercials, as they're called, is 95,000.
[2:19:48.620 --> 2:19:52.460]  So it's just about triple. And they're really hung out to dry.
[2:19:53.260 --> 2:19:59.100]  Explain what that means in layman's terms on the other side as we break down the rig market
[2:19:59.100 --> 2:20:01.180]  with Bob Chapman.
[2:20:59.340 --> 2:21:05.900]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate,
[2:21:05.900 --> 2:21:10.620]  and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do. You can buy it at
[2:21:10.620 --> 2:21:16.540]  here'swhatyoudo.net as an ebook for six bucks or the book for 10 bucks. And we have an audio book
[2:21:16.540 --> 2:21:21.980]  on its way for you commuters as well. Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive
[2:21:21.980 --> 2:21:27.900]  and thrive in these harsh economic times. This book will work for anyone rich, poor, middle class,
[2:21:27.900 --> 2:21:32.300]  it doesn't matter. This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it
[2:21:32.300 --> 2:21:36.460]  will tell you how to protect your wealth as well. You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[2:21:36.460 --> 2:21:40.700]  You need to look out for yourself. The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[2:21:40.700 --> 2:21:44.700]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your
[2:21:44.700 --> 2:21:52.220]  loved ones. Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today. Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.

[2:22:01.340 --> 2:22:06.380]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[2:22:06.380 --> 2:22:11.900]  and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy,
[2:22:11.900 --> 2:22:17.020]  housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line. Is this a flaw for
[2:22:17.020 --> 2:22:21.580]  the enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual
[2:22:21.580 --> 2:22:26.540]  debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions and more can be answered by reading
[2:22:26.540 --> 2:22:31.100]  G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states,
[2:22:31.100 --> 2:22:35.980]  it's what every American needs to know about central bank power. A gripping adventure into the
[2:22:35.980 --> 2:22:40.860]  secret world of international banking cartel. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver
[2:22:40.860 --> 2:22:48.700]  dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book. Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy

[2:23:04.380 --> 2:23:11.260]  doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall. I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard
[2:23:11.260 --> 2:23:17.260]  trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[2:23:17.260 --> 2:23:24.620]  Rely on oxysilver instead. Oxysilver's broad spectrum action makes all vaccinations and
[2:23:24.620 --> 2:23:31.340]  antibiotics unnecessary. Oxysilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal
[2:23:31.340 --> 2:23:37.500]  silvers. It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family. It has
[2:23:37.500 --> 2:23:44.460]  been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel. So get it while you still can. Order oxysilver
[2:23:44.460 --> 2:23:50.860]  online at oxysilver.com. If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.

[2:23:59.340 --> 2:24:13.260]  your life. All right, Bob, you were getting into market manipulation and going over how they're
[2:24:13.260 --> 2:24:17.180]  triple short what they normally would be for people that aren't involved in the stock market or
[2:24:17.180 --> 2:24:20.940]  things they don't understand. Then coming back, I want to get into the good news. The fellow
[2:24:20.940 --> 2:24:27.500]  reserve is in a lot of trouble. National polls show that just 21% favor Ben Bernanke being reappointed
[2:24:27.500 --> 2:24:32.380]  as the Fed chairman. So we're going to be talking about that and playing some clips of his grilling
[2:24:33.260 --> 2:24:40.380]  yesterday. But Bob Chapman, continue. Well, when you're short something like gold bullion or silver
[2:24:40.380 --> 2:24:47.180]  bullion or gold stocks and silver stocks, you bet they're going to go down. And what you have to do
[2:24:47.180 --> 2:24:52.860]  eventually is you have to buy back the security that you sold, even though you didn't own it.
[2:24:53.740 --> 2:24:57.660]  And in this case, it's gold bullion that we're talking about. And there's a silver bullion
[2:24:57.660 --> 2:25:03.180]  market. And I cover that all the time in the international forecaster. But this is a record
[2:25:03.180 --> 2:25:08.700]  short. Now, who's short? The United States government's short. They're the ones who are in
[2:25:08.700 --> 2:25:15.340]  there shorting the gold and silver market. And they're shorting the shares as well. And at least
[2:25:15.340 --> 2:25:23.100]  with the shares, we get a good idea of the breakdown of who's doing what on the bullion exchange or
[2:25:23.100 --> 2:25:30.060]  the comics. You can't tell because they won't tell you. They just give you a total whole figure
[2:25:30.060 --> 2:25:34.380]  of what they call commercials. But in the shares, you can tell because they have to state their
[2:25:34.380 --> 2:25:42.140]  positions. So we know that J.P. Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of New York, City Group,
[2:25:43.020 --> 2:25:48.780]  Barclays, and on and on, these are the shorts in there. And we know how much they're short,
[2:25:48.780 --> 2:25:54.540]  just like we do in the bullion market. And so there's a concentrated effort for the last couple
[2:25:54.540 --> 2:26:00.540]  of months to drive down all of those prices. And also, even in the commodity market as well,
[2:26:00.540 --> 2:26:05.020]  trying to hold those prices down. But that's a little bit more difficult to do because they're
[2:26:05.020 --> 2:26:10.220]  wider markets. And so that's what our government is doing in the market right now. And at the same
[2:26:10.220 --> 2:26:15.420]  time, they're trying to make the dollar grow, go up, as I explained, and how they do that.
[2:26:16.300 --> 2:26:20.300]  And they also are trying to keep the stock market from falling.
[2:26:20.300 --> 2:26:25.500]  So they're coming in with mountains. They're coming in with mountains of fiat derivatives,
[2:26:25.500 --> 2:26:32.940]  made up money, debt, and they're manipulating the market, trying to drive gold down. Please continue.
[2:26:34.060 --> 2:26:38.140]  And they're not, as Alex said, and as Mr. Roberts said,
[2:26:39.980 --> 2:26:43.260]  at best they can, they can keep it going for a day or two. And that's it.
[2:26:44.460 --> 2:26:48.220]  The dollar's going to go back down, the market's going to go back down, commodities are going to
[2:26:48.220 --> 2:26:53.020]  go back up, and gold and service going to go back up. So what do you do to take advantage of the
[2:26:53.020 --> 2:27:00.700]  fact that the gold shares are down 10 percent, the coins are probably off 3 or 4 or 5 percent,
[2:27:00.700 --> 2:27:06.060]  and you go in and you buy if you can. You add to your collection if you can.
[2:27:06.780 --> 2:27:14.380]  You take advantage of an abnormal dip. It's my projection that the gold will test
[2:27:14.380 --> 2:27:30.060]  $1,650 by the first of April. And I think that we'll get that high. I think that's
[2:27:31.900 --> 2:27:37.820]  where this run is going. And I think that we would have had a normal mini-correction anyway.
[2:27:37.820 --> 2:27:45.340]  I mean, no markets go, we had 21 of the 23 up-days in gold. Well, you're going to have a
[2:27:45.340 --> 2:27:51.180]  correction. People take profits. Not everybody is invested. Some of them are traders. So
[2:27:51.820 --> 2:27:59.420]  I expected somewhere between 25 and 150 points, and that would take gold back to
[2:28:00.540 --> 2:28:04.460]  somewhere in the vicinity of 1,100. Well, they've already done that for us.
[2:28:04.460 --> 2:28:11.980]  So what we have done is corrected the technical situation of being overbought.
[2:28:13.580 --> 2:28:17.100]  We'll get a little ground floor somewhere in here and then go right back up again.
[2:28:17.100 --> 2:28:21.580]  Let me ask you this, Bob Chapman. Again, your predictions have always been devastatingly accurate
[2:28:21.580 --> 2:28:27.020]  here on air, so people are really taking notes. Two weeks ago, they tried to dump, as you know,
[2:28:27.020 --> 2:28:30.300]  billions and billions, tens of billions of dollars of gold in the market, thinking that
[2:28:30.300 --> 2:28:34.940]  would drive it down. But instead, the Indians, the Chinese, and others grabbed it all up.
[2:28:35.500 --> 2:28:39.820]  Why was that manipulation to drive it down not successful, but this one has been?
[2:28:41.980 --> 2:28:48.460]  I think that what they've done is they've gone and talked to these entities,
[2:28:49.340 --> 2:28:54.940]  such as India. Why did you go out and take 200 tons of gold down? And Sarah Lanker and Mauritanius,
[2:28:54.940 --> 2:29:02.220]  whose orders were relatively inconsequential. But I think they really leaned on the Chinese,
[2:29:02.220 --> 2:29:07.420]  because the Chinese came out and said, well, we hope that this isn't a gold bubble here.
[2:29:08.220 --> 2:29:13.020]  Well, you've got to be kidding me. The Chinese thought that's stupid. So that means that they
[2:29:13.020 --> 2:29:20.140]  were asked to say that to keep the price of gold from running further. And I'm sure the story that
[2:29:20.140 --> 2:29:28.380]  was given by Geithner to the Chinese was, look, if it backs off, you can buy it cheaper. We just
[2:29:28.380 --> 2:29:34.220]  told them, we want it down for right now. And believe me, this sort of thing goes on.
[2:29:34.940 --> 2:29:39.100]  And so the Chinese come out and said something, and that didn't help the market to back up.
[2:29:39.100 --> 2:29:41.260]  What are the Chinese doing today? They're in their buying.
[2:29:43.180 --> 2:29:46.700]  All right. I want to shift gears out of this area and get into what's happening with the
[2:29:46.700 --> 2:29:53.020]  Federal Reserve and unemployment numbers. We'll be right back. We're on the march.
[2:29:53.020 --> 2:29:58.380]  The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[2:33:28.380 --> 2:33:46.380]  there's a burden at the center.
[2:33:50.060 --> 2:33:55.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have identified the private film reserve as the enemy of the Republic.
[2:33:55.020 --> 2:33:59.900]  The beginning of the end is here. Keep rolling it for everybody out there.
[2:34:01.020 --> 2:34:05.260]  You take my life, but I take yours too. You fire musket, but I run you through.
[2:34:15.820 --> 2:34:21.020]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Thank you so much for joining us. Bob
[2:34:21.020 --> 2:34:28.060]  Chapman is our guest. I want to play a few clips here of the grilling of
[2:34:28.860 --> 2:34:34.780]  Ben Bernanke and others yesterday as the truth of what these guys have done. These are the same
[2:34:34.780 --> 2:34:40.060]  bankers who changed the policies to just, and when the government wouldn't give them unlimited
[2:34:40.060 --> 2:34:43.740]  trillions last October, they went out on the news and said, we're going to have martial law,
[2:34:43.740 --> 2:34:48.300]  depression, if you don't do this, the market dropped several thousand points. The government
[2:34:48.300 --> 2:34:53.580]  panicked, passed it. They stole the money and said, we won't say where it went. Now they
[2:34:53.580 --> 2:34:59.420]  want even more money. These are the made off, can lay type criminals. This is the criminal group.
[2:34:59.420 --> 2:35:03.900]  These are the illegitimate people that run our country and run our government and are running
[2:35:03.900 --> 2:35:11.420]  it into the ground. And so I want to go ahead and play a short clip with Judge Napolitano
[2:35:11.420 --> 2:35:19.180]  yesterday. And there's hours of this where Republicans and Democrats said, we want you
[2:35:19.180 --> 2:35:24.060]  gone Bernanke, but you know, they're throwing Phil Jones under the bus for climate fraud. He's
[2:35:24.060 --> 2:35:28.540]  only the kingpin of the scientists low level compared to Al Gore and George Soros. They're
[2:35:28.540 --> 2:35:33.260]  throwing him under the bus. They're trying to throw Bernanke under the bus. No, it's not going to
[2:35:33.260 --> 2:35:39.340]  end there. You can't just give the public a sacrificial hog. Okay. We want them all. We're
[2:35:39.340 --> 2:35:46.140]  going to talk about that with Bob Chapman here in just a moment. But first here is Judge Napolitano.
[2:35:52.620 --> 2:35:58.620]  Go ahead and play it whenever you guys are. Okay. I thought we had that save the computer. Well,
[2:35:58.620 --> 2:36:02.860]  okay, man, these computers are just having a meltdown in there lately. Nothing's working.
[2:36:02.860 --> 2:36:09.500]  It's used to like always work. And now it doesn't. Do you, you know, I think we have too many videos
[2:36:09.500 --> 2:36:14.140]  loaded in on that system. And so we're going to have to go to something else here because this
[2:36:14.140 --> 2:36:21.180]  is just not working live on radio. Not not not working at all. What about the other clip we've
[2:36:21.180 --> 2:36:26.540]  got from the hearings? Do you have that from that Asian news channel? Okay, we'll play whatever you
[2:36:26.540 --> 2:36:35.820]  can. Here we go. Term at the helm of the central bank expires next month faced unusually blunt talk
[2:36:35.820 --> 2:36:41.980]  from lawmakers critical of the fed's actions during the crisis. Senator Jim Bunning is a Republican
[2:36:41.980 --> 2:36:47.820]  from Kentucky. You put the printing presses into overdrive to fund the government spending and hand
[2:36:47.820 --> 2:36:55.580]  out cheap money to your masters on Wall Street, which they used to rake in record profits while
[2:36:55.580 --> 2:37:01.740]  ordinary Americans and small businesses can't even get loans for their everyday needs.
[2:37:02.300 --> 2:37:07.980]  But in a forceful defense of the fed's efforts during the crisis, many of them unprecedented,
[2:37:07.980 --> 2:37:13.580]  Bernanke said authorities prevented a calamity as severe as the effects of the financial crisis
[2:37:13.580 --> 2:37:17.900]  have been. However, the outcome could have been markedly worse without the strong actions taken
[2:37:17.900 --> 2:37:22.540]  by the Congress, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance
[2:37:22.540 --> 2:37:29.340]  Corporation, and other authorities both here and abroad. He also said the economy appears to be on
[2:37:29.340 --> 2:37:34.300]  the mend. Today, most indicators suggest that financial markets are stabilizing and that the
[2:37:34.300 --> 2:37:41.580]  economy is emerging from the recession. Yet our task is far from complete. Far too many Americans
[2:37:41.580 --> 2:37:47.020]  are without jobs and unemployment could remain high for some time, even if, as we anticipate,
[2:37:47.020 --> 2:37:52.860]  a moderate economic growth continues. Despite the tough questioning, a second term for Bernanke
[2:37:52.860 --> 2:38:01.340]  does not appear in doubt. Okay, and then we're going to try this other clip one more time here
[2:38:02.300 --> 2:38:05.900]  where there's some other grilling that goes on. Here it is.
[2:38:08.700 --> 2:38:15.020]  Dean Denwright, some members of the Senate Banking Committee. Bernanke wants that second term as
[2:38:15.020 --> 2:38:21.420]  head of the Federal Reserve, but Republican Senator Jim Bunning called him, quote, a moral hazard,
[2:38:21.420 --> 2:38:29.740]  and then added this. Where I come from, we punish failure, not rewarded. That is certainly the way
[2:38:29.740 --> 2:38:37.980]  it was when I played baseball, and it is the way across all America presently. Judging by the
[2:38:37.980 --> 2:38:45.100]  current treasurer secretary, some may think Washington does reward failure, but that should not be
[2:38:45.100 --> 2:38:53.740]  the case. I will do everything I can to stop your nomination and drag out this process as long as I
[2:38:53.740 --> 2:39:00.220]  can. Now, independent and socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has threatened to put a hold
[2:39:00.220 --> 2:39:06.860]  on Ben Bernanke's nomination. Let's see, a conservative and a socialist agree on at least
[2:39:06.860 --> 2:39:16.220]  one thing, no more Bernanke. With me now, no fan of the Fed, Congressman Ron Paul of Texas,
[2:39:16.220 --> 2:39:21.100]  Congressman... Okay, so there's a few minutes of that, and you can just go to YouTube and type in
[2:39:21.100 --> 2:39:25.740]  Bernanke Grilled, and there's just hundreds of these in the last few months. They've gone from
[2:39:25.740 --> 2:39:30.220]  treating them with reverence and shaking when he comes in. Oh, Federal Reserve, oh, you are the god
[2:39:30.220 --> 2:39:34.860]  of our country. Thank you for all you do. Now to, hey, you're a bunch of crooks. We know you
[2:39:34.860 --> 2:39:39.580]  engineered this. We know you gave the money to yourself. You need to get in trouble. And now,
[2:39:41.020 --> 2:39:46.060]  311 sponsors, it's passed out a committee to audit the Fed, a strong bill to audit the Fed,
[2:39:46.060 --> 2:39:50.540]  auditing the Fed, as Bernanke has said will destroy the Fed, since it's a private holding
[2:39:50.540 --> 2:39:54.540]  company for the big central banks. Bob Chapman, for those that may have just joined us, explain
[2:39:54.540 --> 2:39:59.900]  to people what the Federal Reserve is, how big this is that we have 80 plus percent of Americans
[2:39:59.900 --> 2:40:07.660]  in some polls wanting to abolish or audit the Fed. We have a new poll out, just 21% from Rasmussen,
[2:40:07.660 --> 2:40:14.060]  favor Bernanke's reappointment as Fed Chairman, but it's not just Bernanke. It's like shark teeth.
[2:40:14.060 --> 2:40:18.780]  You pull out one tooth, another tooth rolls forward. We have to get rid of the shark itself,
[2:40:18.780 --> 2:40:21.500]  the private Federal Reserve banking dictatorship, don't we?
[2:40:22.620 --> 2:40:25.340]  We certainly do, and I think we're well on our way to doing that.
[2:40:25.340 --> 2:40:34.300]  And, you know, there's about 310 or 311 cosponses of the House bill, and it certainly looks like
[2:40:34.300 --> 2:40:41.100]  it's going to pass. And after the grilling that went on and the exposure that got right down to
[2:40:41.100 --> 2:40:47.580]  the nitty-gritty of what was going on, it's going to throw this thing forward to be passed,
[2:40:47.580 --> 2:40:53.180]  and I think it'll be passed in the Senate. And I think we'll have a hard look at what goes on in
[2:40:53.180 --> 2:40:57.980]  the Fed, and the people aren't going to like it because it's been going on for 96 years.
[2:40:57.980 --> 2:41:03.020]  And when they look back and see all of these cycles, they were deliberately created.
[2:41:03.980 --> 2:41:08.860]  You know, maybe their predecessors at the Treasury Department during the 1870s and
[2:41:08.860 --> 2:41:16.140]  80s and 90s and up until 1905 did a terrible job. Maybe they did, but these guys have done
[2:41:16.140 --> 2:41:21.980]  a hell of a lot worse, let me tell you. And so the Federal Reserve is privately owned,
[2:41:21.980 --> 2:41:27.740]  as Alex said, and there's 12 banks that own it. And then they have the top shareholders who have
[2:41:27.740 --> 2:41:34.460]  held the stock in the Fed since 1913, and they are American and European bankers.
[2:41:35.260 --> 2:41:44.540]  And the core, the very heart, the nexus of what goes on within the power behind government
[2:41:44.540 --> 2:41:52.860]  emanates from the Fed. This is the handmaiden of control of our entire country, our economy,
[2:41:52.860 --> 2:41:59.420]  our foreign policy. They control Congress through campaign contributions. From both,
[2:41:59.420 --> 2:42:05.340]  you know, both parties are involved. It isn't a Democrat or a Republican thing. It's both of them.
[2:42:06.220 --> 2:42:13.740]  And I'm glad to see that Bernie was involved. And I like seeing socialists and conservatives
[2:42:13.740 --> 2:42:19.420]  together because like you say, Alex, it throws out the left, right paradigm.
[2:42:19.420 --> 2:42:24.700]  Let's do what's good for America. And we'll sort all the other stuff out later. And so
[2:42:24.700 --> 2:42:29.740]  people were headed with this thing. Well, Bob, here's the problem. Like they did last October
[2:42:29.740 --> 2:42:34.460]  and like they've done in the last month, the private Fed chairman, the Treasury head,
[2:42:34.460 --> 2:42:39.740]  they come out and threaten and say, if you try to audit the Fed, that will cause the economy to
[2:42:39.740 --> 2:42:45.260]  implode. If you don't give us more money, the economy will implode. And it's just like one
[2:42:45.260 --> 2:42:49.340]  of the professors says and follow the Republic. This is like the end of blazing saddles where
[2:42:49.340 --> 2:42:53.100]  they have the sheriff surrounded, the corrupt sheriff, and he puts a gun to his head and says,
[2:42:53.100 --> 2:43:00.300]  stop or I'll shoot. This is like suicide by cop. You know, they're saying you do what we say or
[2:43:00.300 --> 2:43:05.180]  we will destroy the economy. But we do what they say and they destroy the economy because they
[2:43:05.180 --> 2:43:10.220]  want to consolidate it. I mean, this is not going to be clean. This is going to be messy. But the
[2:43:10.220 --> 2:43:16.460]  beginning of the end for these people has begun because now we've gone from 10 years ago, maybe
[2:43:16.460 --> 2:43:22.140]  one out of 20 people knowing the Fed was the real government, the shadow government to now over 80%
[2:43:22.140 --> 2:43:27.580]  knowing it's the real government. And so they're not addressing puppet Obama, puppet Bush, puppet
[2:43:27.580 --> 2:43:33.580]  McCain, puppet Pelosi. They're addressing the real government. We're having a real dialogue now.
[2:43:33.580 --> 2:43:41.340]  Yeah, we're attacking the real core of what's going on. And all of the peripheral things that
[2:43:41.340 --> 2:43:51.500]  you've just mentioned are secondary and important. And so I am amazed, amazed that this 80% of the
[2:43:51.500 --> 2:44:00.380]  people and you know, it shows up on the other side with the 21% who are back Bernanke. I mean,
[2:44:00.380 --> 2:44:07.180]  that's 80% going the other way that don't. And so the public on this issue from listening to your
[2:44:07.180 --> 2:44:15.020]  program and programs like it and on the internet, they got themselves educated. And very, very quickly,
[2:44:15.020 --> 2:44:21.900]  I think over the last two years, we've had this build up of knowledge, which is fantastic. And
[2:44:21.900 --> 2:44:28.620]  if we can shut down the Fed and give the job back to the Treasury Department in whatever form they
[2:44:28.620 --> 2:44:35.420]  want and get rid of private bankers, private Fed representatives in the Treasury. I was just going
[2:44:35.420 --> 2:44:42.060]  to say we got to stop the revolving door between Wall Street and the Treasury Department. We do
[2:44:42.060 --> 2:44:50.620]  those two things and we resurrect Andrew Jackson and we get it made. But this crew is going to
[2:44:50.620 --> 2:44:56.620]  stage terror attacks, wars, martial law before they let us do it. But since the people are now
[2:44:56.620 --> 2:45:02.300]  awake to all of that, it's only a matter of time before these people fall. I mean, that's why they
[2:45:02.300 --> 2:45:06.700]  would never say the Federal Reserve was private. That's why we would read official UN documents
[2:45:06.700 --> 2:45:11.100]  calling for world government. The media would say we were nuts. It didn't exist because they could
[2:45:11.100 --> 2:45:16.380]  never admit that there was an illegitimate shadow global corporate government because then people
[2:45:16.380 --> 2:45:21.020]  would stop being distracted by the puppets and actually start having a debate about the real
[2:45:21.020 --> 2:45:25.420]  power structure. And now that people know there's a global government, now that it's admitted we're
[2:45:25.420 --> 2:45:30.940]  going into world government, now more and more whistleblowers are coming out exposing them.
[2:45:30.940 --> 2:45:37.260]  I mean, we've got a long, hard road to follow here, but at the end of it, we're going to beat
[2:45:37.260 --> 2:45:42.940]  these people. We are and we're going to get our country back and it is going to be nasty and they
[2:45:42.940 --> 2:45:49.180]  do have the ability to take the economy down anytime they feel like it. And so if we challenge them
[2:45:49.180 --> 2:45:52.940]  and they lose, they are going to take it down, but it's going to go down anyway. And it should
[2:45:52.940 --> 2:45:57.580]  have went down in the first place. That's classical economics. We don't stand around
[2:45:58.220 --> 2:46:04.780]  and allow the Federal Reserve the likes of it to do what they've done. We take the economy down.
[2:46:04.780 --> 2:46:10.860]  In 1921, we had the same situation and the President just walked away and said, look,
[2:46:10.860 --> 2:46:16.780]  let it take its course and it did. And we were out of the recession in a year and it boomed
[2:46:16.780 --> 2:46:22.220]  during the 20s, of course, too much. And then of course, the Fed pulled the plug again. And this
[2:46:22.220 --> 2:46:29.260]  is all rigged. It's all contrived to make gazillions of dollars for these people and ensconce them
[2:46:29.260 --> 2:46:35.820]  greater, greater, greater power. But they've clearly overplayed their hand this time because
[2:46:35.820 --> 2:46:42.460]  resistance to them is just mounting. Well, that's why we've got to keep on hammering on. And that's
[2:46:42.460 --> 2:46:50.140]  like with you yourself and myself. We went hammer and tong after that climate gate. And it was a
[2:46:50.140 --> 2:46:57.100]  tremendous issue. I mean, I'm getting on stations I would have never got on before Fox Calm emailed
[2:46:57.100 --> 2:47:05.820]  me and asked me to go on. We had Rush and O'Reilly used tapes of Mayan from the shows that I've been
[2:47:05.820 --> 2:47:12.700]  on on the air. I mean, they're trying to capture the flavor of the things so they can continue to
[2:47:12.700 --> 2:47:17.180]  get their ratings. And the ratings aren't there for them. They're falling off in their ratings.
[2:47:17.180 --> 2:47:20.380]  And that's why they're doing that. And Alex, you pointed that out before.
[2:47:21.900 --> 2:47:26.620]  Well, absolutely. The founder of the Tea Parties, the guy that actually started it to be nonpartisan,
[2:47:26.620 --> 2:47:32.860]  anti-fetal reserve, he went on Fox of all places and said, Glenn Beck and the fake Republicans
[2:47:32.860 --> 2:47:40.460]  have hijacked our movement. And so, and then Jesse Ventura's new TV show gets the highest ratings
[2:47:40.460 --> 2:47:47.900]  true TVs ever had. And it should. All Jesse's doing is say, Hey, look at this. This is the
[2:47:47.900 --> 2:47:53.340]  truth. This is the way it is. And this is all the people want. Tell us the truth and which
[2:47:53.340 --> 2:48:00.140]  direction we should go. Well, folks, there is some positive things happening, but we're not out of
[2:48:00.140 --> 2:48:05.260]  the woods yet, as they say. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but we've got miles to go before
[2:48:05.260 --> 2:48:11.260]  we sleep. Somebody pull up that poem for me. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have miles
[2:48:11.260 --> 2:48:15.900]  to go before I sleep. I want to read that poem later. Bob, I want to take some calls. They're
[2:48:15.900 --> 2:48:20.700]  all over the map from earlier, but you can comment on any issue. Let's talk to Jake in California.
[2:48:20.700 --> 2:48:27.740]  Jake, you're on the air. Hey, man. I'm enjoying the program this morning. I have, I just wanted
[2:48:27.740 --> 2:48:32.940]  to say hi. I got a friend in northern Mississippi that listens to you regularly. Susie Q. So,
[2:48:32.940 --> 2:48:37.740]  anyhow, let me just say, uh, first of all, I wanted to make a comment on what you guys just
[2:48:37.740 --> 2:48:43.100]  said regarding the economy, but Alex, I'd like to make a request. Would you please have Dr.
[2:48:43.100 --> 2:48:49.660]  Deagle on sometime in the near future to discuss your point, sir? I go ahead and make your point.
[2:48:49.660 --> 2:48:53.820]  Okay. Well, the point I wanted to make is I completely disagree with what you guys just
[2:48:53.820 --> 2:48:58.060]  said that we're going to get this country back. Literally, that would take a miracle.
[2:48:58.060 --> 2:49:01.900]  That's not going to be us. It's going to be a miracle. There is a course that's been set.
[2:49:01.900 --> 2:49:07.580]  You actually have been a proponent of that. You've been speaking about it. And so we don't
[2:49:07.580 --> 2:49:12.620]  just have some miraculous turnaround. Wow. I mean, this is a really defeatist phone call here,
[2:49:12.620 --> 2:49:18.540]  Jack. No, it's, it's, it's not a defeatist phone call. It's what it is. It's a realistic
[2:49:18.540 --> 2:49:24.700]  phone call. And a lot of it is based on the data that you've passed in the past. So, I mean,
[2:49:24.700 --> 2:49:29.340]  when you, you know, when you pass data to us and tell us that, you know, basically,
[2:49:29.340 --> 2:49:34.540]  basically, we're in an enormous amount of trouble, which is true. We can see that. And then in the
[2:49:34.540 --> 2:49:39.660]  next breath to say, we're going to win this thing, we're not, but we've got listen, not listen.
[2:49:39.660 --> 2:49:44.700]  You got the wrong show then, bro. Okay. You've got the wrong radio show since we're not going
[2:49:44.700 --> 2:49:49.500]  to beat anything, go out and party and have a great time. Okay. You got the wrong show.
[2:49:49.500 --> 2:49:53.420]  The climate gate is devastating and Copenhagen is going to fail. They're still going to try
[2:49:53.420 --> 2:49:58.220]  to implement all this at the grassroots level. We've got to go out with a winning attitude
[2:49:58.220 --> 2:50:02.780]  and engage these people at the local level and take our communities back by standing up against
[2:50:02.780 --> 2:50:08.060]  them. The federal reserve, we just pointed out all the stuff they're going to try to pull on us.
[2:50:08.620 --> 2:50:16.540]  But the beginning of the end is happening for them. And I mean, I just don't even know what to say
[2:50:16.540 --> 2:50:22.780]  where I'm bad for saying we can win this thing. This is a process. It's not going to happen overnight,
[2:50:22.780 --> 2:50:28.780]  but we have to reach out to people. We've got to get involved and I know history and I know the
[2:50:28.780 --> 2:50:33.820]  situation we're facing and I know we've got a chance to reverse this. Bob, I want to get your
[2:50:33.820 --> 2:50:43.900]  take on that call when we come back. I mean, I just, people don't understand what attitude is about
[2:50:43.900 --> 2:50:48.700]  and initiative and knowing we're in the right and standing up and saying, we're going to win.
[2:50:48.700 --> 2:50:52.940]  They don't understand warfare. They don't understand info war. They don't understand we've got the
[2:50:52.940 --> 2:50:57.660]  truth. We've got the ultimate weapon on our side. They don't understand that the enemy is imploding
[2:50:57.660 --> 2:51:04.140]  at every level. Man, that makes me sick. We all know that the Berkey water purification systems

[2:52:11.100 --> 2:52:17.660]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president
[2:52:17.660 --> 2:52:23.580]  in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[2:52:23.580 --> 2:52:29.260]  as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[2:52:29.260 --> 2:52:35.260]  the criminal offshore cartel, hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[2:52:35.260 --> 2:52:40.140]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and
[2:52:40.140 --> 2:52:44.940]  the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right
[2:52:44.940 --> 2:52:51.820]  now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your copy of full of the republic

[2:54:07.020 --> 2:54:11.900]  Look, I'm going to get Bob's take of what we just heard. But first I just want to say this.
[2:54:11.900 --> 2:54:17.740]  We have gotten into this position where we've been taken over and usurped by foreign
[2:54:17.740 --> 2:54:22.140]  offshore banks and corporations because we got an attitude that we're the biggest,
[2:54:22.140 --> 2:54:26.460]  we're the best. There's no corruption in government. I could just go play golf all day
[2:54:26.460 --> 2:54:29.980]  and never care about who's getting elected or never care about what's happening with special
[2:54:29.980 --> 2:54:34.700]  interest. I can just go to sleep. And I know that if we have that attitude, things are only going
[2:54:34.700 --> 2:54:40.620]  to get worse. We are having successes that are so giant. The spirit in this country and the world is
[2:54:40.620 --> 2:54:48.140]  shifting and awakening. I'm seeing everywhere I go in foreign countries and other cities,
[2:54:48.140 --> 2:54:52.940]  masses of people come up to Alex Jones on the street and say, we're awake. We're fighting.
[2:54:52.940 --> 2:54:59.900]  And I'm just one guy. So you may not have a face they recognize, the caller from California, Dave.
[2:54:59.900 --> 2:55:05.580]  And so you may think that, you know, that I'm blowing smoke and you may see decadent,
[2:55:05.580 --> 2:55:11.420]  soulless people around you who aren't awake and think we're doomed. I know we're in a lot
[2:55:11.420 --> 2:55:15.020]  better position than we were a year ago, two years ago, 10 years ago.
[2:55:15.020 --> 2:55:19.820]  Bob Chapman's been doing this for almost 50 years. Okay. He's an icon and fighting the
[2:55:19.820 --> 2:55:23.420]  New World Order and he doesn't have a loser attitude. And I'm not going to, I'm not calling
[2:55:23.420 --> 2:55:29.020]  you a loser, sir, but I don't need to be rebuked for getting up here and saying things are really
[2:55:29.020 --> 2:55:32.300]  bad. These people are really bad. That's like, if your house is on fire and I go call the fire
[2:55:32.300 --> 2:55:37.020]  department, it's on fire. I'm not being negative. I'm telling you the truth. But the fire department
[2:55:37.020 --> 2:55:41.420]  pulled up, they put out fires in a couple of rooms. Looks like we're going to be able to save the house
[2:55:42.060 --> 2:55:49.020]  if you'll stop telling the firemen to stand down. Okay. Now they told the founding fathers,
[2:55:49.020 --> 2:55:52.300]  they couldn't win. They've told everybody they couldn't win. They've told inventors,
[2:55:52.300 --> 2:55:59.260]  they couldn't invent things. It is an attitude, a loser attitude that we have going on here,
[2:55:59.260 --> 2:56:03.980]  that we've got to route out. We have to go look at these criminals in government,
[2:56:03.980 --> 2:56:08.940]  beat the drum that they're criminals, expose their system and they will fall because they've
[2:56:08.940 --> 2:56:13.980]  triggered criminal operations that are going to hurt people financially. And so even lazy,
[2:56:13.980 --> 2:56:18.380]  decadent people are now looking for the truth and rubbing the sleep out of their eyes and getting
[2:56:18.380 --> 2:56:24.940]  awake and getting involved. And it is a lie to say that there's no way to stand up against this
[2:56:24.940 --> 2:56:31.260]  or to stop this. Look at what's happening. Every time we stand up, we win. The problem is most
[2:56:31.260 --> 2:56:37.660]  the time people don't stand up because they don't have any respect for themselves in this fight.
[2:56:37.660 --> 2:56:43.100]  Bob Chapman. Well, I agree, but I think it's good to have the dialogue and have the other
[2:56:44.060 --> 2:56:49.980]  side. Like the gentleman said, I don't believe it. I don't think it's going to work.
[2:56:49.980 --> 2:56:56.940]  He understands the problem. He said he did. And his take, you've said, is incorrect. I agree
[2:56:56.940 --> 2:57:04.620]  with you. And it is incorrect. And the key word, and you mentioned it just a minute or two ago,
[2:57:04.620 --> 2:57:11.340]  is we know what the problem is and we have to have the spirit of American citizens in our
[2:57:11.340 --> 2:57:17.420]  country and we have to go forward and stop these people. And better, we should go forward and be
[2:57:17.420 --> 2:57:25.980]  defeated. Then not go forward at all and just give up and give these people world government
[2:57:25.980 --> 2:57:32.780]  and world tourney and we become vassals of some vast state. We've got to stop them here and we
[2:57:32.780 --> 2:57:38.540]  got to make sure they don't do it again. And that's spirit. It's just like a sports team goes out,
[2:57:38.540 --> 2:57:43.740]  they're going to have interaction with another team, no matter what the sport. And you all talk
[2:57:43.740 --> 2:57:48.460]  together and say, look, we know these other guys or these other gals are really good,
[2:57:49.420 --> 2:57:53.660]  but we get the spirit and we really want to win this game and we're going to do it.
[2:57:55.020 --> 2:57:59.980]  And then you look at the fact that the globalists are a bunch of potbellied, wicked, corrupt people.
[2:57:59.980 --> 2:58:03.740]  Sure, they've got the money and the power, but it's all fraudulent. If you really look at the
[2:58:03.740 --> 2:58:10.300]  strength of the people, we're like a million feet tall, weigh six trillion pounds, and they're 125
[2:58:10.300 --> 2:58:17.020]  pound potbellied goblin that's gotten up there full of arrogance and Hootspur or whatever and beat
[2:58:17.020 --> 2:58:24.140]  its chest and told us we're beaten, told us that we can't win. I mean, when they were dropping A-bombs
[2:58:24.140 --> 2:58:31.020]  on Tokyo or on Hiroshima and Nakasaki, the Imperial Japanese were broadcasting, we'd lost the war.
[2:58:31.020 --> 2:58:36.860]  It's like Baghdad Bob getting up there and saying that the U.S. had lost as explosions were going
[2:58:36.860 --> 2:58:44.780]  off behind him. It's a crock of baloney. We'll be right back. Thank you for listening to GCN.

[2:58:51.500 --> 2:58:56.220]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[2:58:56.220 --> 2:59:00.940]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[2:59:00.940 --> 2:59:06.220]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only
[2:59:06.220 --> 2:59:11.500]  ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will
[2:59:11.500 --> 2:59:16.060]  you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it
[2:59:16.060 --> 2:59:20.460]  make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the
[2:59:20.460 --> 2:59:26.140]  gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:59:26.140 --> 2:59:31.580]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[2:59:31.580 --> 2:59:36.940]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live
[2:59:36.940 --> 2:59:45.980]  to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again,
[2:59:45.980 --> 3:00:03.100]  that number 1-800-409-5633. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[3:00:08.220 --> 3:00:15.500]  Stopping by the woods on a snowy evening, Robert Frost. Whose woods these are, I think I know?
[3:00:15.500 --> 3:00:21.740]  His house is in the village, though. He will not see me stopping here to watch his woods
[3:00:21.740 --> 3:00:28.300]  fill up with snow. My little horse must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near,
[3:00:28.300 --> 3:00:35.900]  between the woods and frozen lake, the darkest evening of the year. He gives his little harness
[3:00:35.900 --> 3:00:46.140]  bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake. The only other sounds the sweep of easy wind
[3:00:46.140 --> 3:00:53.740]  and downy flake. The woods are lovely dark and deep, but I have promises to keep and miles to go
[3:00:53.740 --> 3:01:03.740]  before I sleep and miles to go before I sleep. Nice little wintertime poem. I wish I was in
[3:01:03.740 --> 3:01:07.100]  the woods riding a horse, but I have to be right here fighting the New World Order.
[3:01:10.460 --> 3:01:14.060]  If people would just go to their city councils, their county commissioners, their state houses,
[3:01:14.620 --> 3:01:20.300]  confront them, speak out, go to public events, call in the talk radio, call Congress,
[3:01:21.180 --> 3:01:26.380]  go and confront the land grabbers, go and confront the CPS, stand up for your rights,
[3:01:26.380 --> 3:01:31.980]  demonstrate rallies so they can't ban it, go to public events, confront globalists. Al Gore
[3:01:31.980 --> 3:01:36.620]  is canceling much of his speaking tours because everywhere he goes, he's being protested and
[3:01:36.620 --> 3:01:41.580]  that's making it in the newspaper and he looks bad. These people don't have total control.
[3:01:41.580 --> 3:01:46.860]  So many people that serve the system serve it because they think we're kooks because they were
[3:01:46.860 --> 3:01:52.700]  told we were kooks by the media, but now because of people 20, 30, 40 years ago telling the truth,
[3:01:52.700 --> 3:01:57.420]  everybody heard the truth. So now that it's been proven to be the truth, people are ready to wake
[3:01:57.420 --> 3:02:04.300]  up. What is it that that caller can't understand about that, Bob? He isn't rejoicing at all the
[3:02:04.300 --> 3:02:10.540]  successes we're having. He isn't rejoicing at the enemy and retreat on multi fronts. Every
[3:02:10.540 --> 3:02:17.820]  time we fight, we win, but how do we get the people to stand up, Bob? By telling them the truth
[3:02:17.820 --> 3:02:25.820]  and continuing to cite all of the instances that you brought up today about cap and trade and the
[3:02:25.820 --> 3:02:33.180]  scandal in Climate Gate and the power of what's going on in Congress with the Federal Reserve
[3:02:33.180 --> 3:02:40.460]  and the eminent passage of Ron Paul's 1207 and the 604 in the Senate, all these are very positive
[3:02:40.460 --> 3:02:47.740]  things. We're showing people that all the things that they suspected are really going on and the
[3:02:47.740 --> 3:02:54.700]  reason we couldn't find out is everything is behind closed doors. Alex and you and I,
[3:02:54.700 --> 3:03:01.260]  we back into a lot of things because we can't get the information sometimes and you put the puzzle
[3:03:01.260 --> 3:03:07.020]  together and all of a sudden you've discovered, well, that's what they're doing and most people
[3:03:07.020 --> 3:03:11.900]  don't want to bother to do that. They'd rather throw their hands in the air and live in an
[3:03:11.900 --> 3:03:16.620]  internment camp and evidently that's what that fellow would like to do. And on top of that,
[3:03:16.620 --> 3:03:21.180]  we're gonna come back and take calls. I promise for John, Alan, Mike, Scott and others, we get
[3:03:21.180 --> 3:03:26.860]  internal congressional reports. We get internal ADL reports. We get internal reports from the
[3:03:26.860 --> 3:03:31.900]  big think tanks and look at all these emails from the top UN climate fraudsters. They're pulling
[3:03:31.900 --> 3:03:37.100]  their hair out going. They're exposing us. How do we stop them? They may beat us. They're behind
[3:03:37.100 --> 3:03:41.740]  the scenes. They're just, aha, they're everywhere. They're waking up to us out in the public. They're
[3:03:41.740 --> 3:03:46.300]  like, we're winning. Everything's fine because they understand they've got to put that good face
[3:03:46.300 --> 3:03:51.340]  on their fraud. But when we come out and say, we're starting to win, that's real. Folks, they're
[3:03:51.340 --> 3:04:04.620]  scared to death of us. That's a fact. That's a fact. I am just, it is. It is. I know these people.
[3:04:04.620 --> 3:04:10.380]  I've debated them just like you have. And they don't want to talk about anything on the plane
[3:04:10.380 --> 3:04:15.660]  that we want to talk about. There's no open discussion. I mean, Ron Paul for the first time
[3:04:15.660 --> 3:04:20.460]  in the last couple of weeks get on major television, CNBC and things like that.
[3:04:21.260 --> 3:04:27.260]  They're now recognizing that the feeling of disenchantment by the public is so great
[3:04:27.260 --> 3:04:33.340]  that they have to use more propaganda and face up to the fact that there is opposition,
[3:04:33.340 --> 3:04:40.220]  just like the gentleman called in. He's an opposition to trying to win, evidently.
[3:04:40.220 --> 3:04:46.540]  And these people, they want to hold on to what they've got, this power, this enormous amount
[3:04:46.540 --> 3:04:52.140]  of money that controls the people. Well, Bob, there's also a lot of people that expect we're
[3:04:52.140 --> 3:04:58.060]  going to lose and can't believe anything ever positive is going to happen. But the globalist
[3:04:58.060 --> 3:05:03.900]  are just criminals, ladies and gentlemen. The illusion created by the power elite is a lie
[3:05:03.900 --> 3:05:08.300]  that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center,
[3:05:08.300 --> 3:05:13.020]  buying their processed food that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[3:05:13.020 --> 3:05:18.060]  You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution. Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife

[3:07:02.700 --> 3:07:07.740]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[3:07:07.740 --> 3:07:13.100]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power
[3:07:13.100 --> 3:07:17.980]  your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity
[3:07:17.980 --> 3:07:22.940]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[3:07:22.940 --> 3:07:28.460]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[3:07:28.460 --> 3:07:33.660]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands
[3:07:33.660 --> 3:07:38.380]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[3:07:38.380 --> 3:07:42.860]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[3:07:42.860 --> 3:07:47.580]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information

[3:08:03.980 --> 3:08:12.860]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind. All right, going back to your
[3:08:12.860 --> 3:08:19.980]  calls, my final point on the loser spirit that some people still have out there, the sense of
[3:08:19.980 --> 3:08:26.380]  defeatism. The globalists are slick criminals and they're good at feeding on people that don't have
[3:08:26.380 --> 3:08:31.740]  a lot of information, people that are lazy, people that are weak, people that go along to get along,
[3:08:31.740 --> 3:08:39.980]  people that buy into slick corporate hype. But the globalists are threatened by strong,
[3:08:39.980 --> 3:08:46.460]  focused men and women that know the truth and will warn the people. And now, every time we stand up,
[3:08:46.460 --> 3:08:51.260]  we win. The problem is, we can't get people to stand up. People don't see themselves as leaders.
[3:08:51.260 --> 3:08:55.740]  I get thousands of emails every month saying, oh, we're glad you're there doing the job. No,
[3:08:55.740 --> 3:09:00.620]  folks, I'm just one person in this fight. That's what's so beautiful about We Are Change and the
[3:09:00.620 --> 3:09:04.300]  Tea Parties and other groups that are out confronting Gore and all these other globalists
[3:09:04.300 --> 3:09:07.740]  everywhere they go. People should be confronting Schwarzenegger everywhere he goes. They should
[3:09:07.740 --> 3:09:14.780]  be confronting all these other climate change fraudsters like Newt Gennrich. It's on both parties
[3:09:15.420 --> 3:09:19.740]  and the left-right paradigm where they divide us into two parties to make us fight with each other
[3:09:19.740 --> 3:09:25.100]  and make us think the power structure ends with the president. That mirage is coming crashing down
[3:09:25.100 --> 3:09:30.300]  right now. So the media plays up these gatecrashers for a week and a half who went to the White House
[3:09:30.300 --> 3:09:34.300]  and got into that party to make it look like, oh, getting into the party is the greatest thing in
[3:09:34.300 --> 3:09:40.060]  the world. Oh, you know, getting to meet with the president, meeting with the God. The establishment,
[3:09:40.060 --> 3:09:45.020]  I told you, would build up Obama and then destroy him and then bring in somebody new and build him
[3:09:45.020 --> 3:09:50.060]  up and destroy them. It's theater. Let's go to phone calls here. John in Texas, you're on the
[3:09:50.060 --> 3:09:55.340]  air with Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com. Go ahead, John. Hi, Alex. Hi, Bob.
[3:09:55.340 --> 3:10:05.260]  Yes, sir. One time I think you said that you knew Leon DeGrelle. Very well. Could you explain a
[3:10:05.260 --> 3:10:09.500]  little bit about him? I read his book campaign in Russia and the guy was really a brave soldier,
[3:10:09.500 --> 3:10:13.900]  really. It's really an excellent book on a war in the Eastern Front. I guess he said he told you
[3:10:13.900 --> 3:10:17.900]  a few things about World War II history in post-war Europe. I wonder if you could elaborate a bit on it.
[3:10:17.900 --> 3:10:26.460]  Well, I don't think this is the right time to do it, but Leon was a very well-read gentleman.
[3:10:27.420 --> 3:10:33.580]  He was an attorney. He was the head of the Rex's party in Belgium. He was a reporter.
[3:10:34.300 --> 3:10:41.500]  He was an eloquent speaker, although he never learned English, and we always had to converse
[3:10:41.500 --> 3:10:50.220]  in French or in German. His exploits during the Second World War, as a soldier, were second to
[3:10:50.220 --> 3:11:01.340]  none in any army. He was a survivor, and he was a very nice man. All right. Thanks a lot, Bob.
[3:11:03.340 --> 3:11:08.140]  All right. Let's go ahead and talk to Alan in Kentucky. Alan, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:11:08.140 --> 3:11:18.540]  Gentlemen, thank you very much for opening my eyes to so much. I have so much anger at these people
[3:11:18.540 --> 3:11:23.740]  because I've had a very good life. I'm in my sixties, and I appreciate everything that this
[3:11:23.740 --> 3:11:30.060]  country has done and given to me, but I'm afraid that my children and my grandchildren are not
[3:11:30.060 --> 3:11:36.940]  going to have it as well as I did. I'm one of these old fighters in this Info War, Alex.
[3:11:36.940 --> 3:11:43.660]  I've bought many of your movies. I've made copies of them, and I want to tell those people out there
[3:11:43.660 --> 3:11:49.740]  who have this defeatist attitude. It's not going to happen. Things are going to probably get tougher
[3:11:49.740 --> 3:11:56.380]  than they are. I'm very scared, a little bit afraid now that as we push the New World Order
[3:11:56.380 --> 3:12:01.740]  into a corner, and I think we have pushed them into a corner, that they are going to become
[3:12:01.740 --> 3:12:07.260]  more desperate. But at least it's on our terms. How many years have I explained that when they
[3:12:07.260 --> 3:12:13.180]  announced their plan, there'd be a huge awakening, and it's not going to be all roses for these people,
[3:12:13.180 --> 3:12:17.100]  but at least we don't just lay here and let them carry it out the way they want.
[3:12:17.100 --> 3:12:21.660]  We make them escalate. We make them fight. We make them come out in the open.
[3:12:23.660 --> 3:12:28.220]  And because of you, Alex, we know their game plan. We know what they have in their repertoire. We
[3:12:28.220 --> 3:12:35.260]  know what the possibilities are, and we can prepare for that. And I do have one question
[3:12:35.260 --> 3:12:43.980]  that I'd like to get Bob's take on, if I may. Go ahead. And all my life, I've paid my taxes,
[3:12:43.980 --> 3:12:49.820]  and I've never cheated on my taxes, and yet I'm feeling very conflicted about that right now,
[3:12:49.820 --> 3:12:54.860]  since I know exactly where that money is going. And I think a lot of Americans
[3:12:54.860 --> 3:13:00.460]  are coming to that same conclusion, and I'm not advocating this to anybody.
[3:13:01.020 --> 3:13:05.180]  No, but record numbers are not paying now because they know, as Ronald Reagan's commission
[3:13:05.180 --> 3:13:10.940]  showed in 1981, not one red cent of your income tax money goes to run the country.
[3:13:10.940 --> 3:13:16.940]  It all goes to the private banks. Go ahead. What would happen if a large number of us
[3:13:16.940 --> 3:13:20.620]  came to that same conclusion? That's what I'd like to know.
[3:13:20.620 --> 3:13:28.300]  Bob? I think historically, about 32% of people who own their own small businesses
[3:13:29.100 --> 3:13:36.940]  do not file at all. And that figure, I understand, is now risen to 38%. And if this thing keeps on
[3:13:36.940 --> 3:13:45.260]  going the way it's going, it's probably going to go up to 60 or 70%. And these people aren't
[3:13:45.260 --> 3:13:51.260]  captive because they own their own businesses. But there is a groundswell of people who are
[3:13:51.260 --> 3:13:56.060]  saying, no, I'm not going to do that anymore, and I'm not going to pay them, and there's millions of
[3:13:56.060 --> 3:14:02.540]  us. And so if I get caught, and I have to go up against the government, well, I'm willing to do
[3:14:02.540 --> 3:14:08.220]  that. And that's what's happening. And I can understand why you're questioning what's going
[3:14:08.220 --> 3:14:13.900]  on. And it's a good time to do it. I mean, the people who work in companies, they don't have
[3:14:13.900 --> 3:14:18.700]  that luxury. They receive a paycheck, and they take everything out, and then they give you what's
[3:14:18.700 --> 3:14:24.380]  left. But private individuals who have their own companies, they're in a different situation.
[3:14:24.380 --> 3:14:28.380]  Yeah, I appreciate your call. Let me make this point. That's your decision to make.
[3:14:28.380 --> 3:14:32.140]  People are going, well, how do they fund the government if it isn't the income tax? It's
[3:14:32.140 --> 3:14:36.860]  all the hundreds of other taxes. And when you read what the UN says, and you read what the
[3:14:36.860 --> 3:14:42.620]  federal government has stated, they want a global carbon tax system that's going to be on an ID card
[3:14:42.620 --> 3:14:48.300]  with your carbon credits. And when those run out, more taxes will kick in, not just taxes on each
[3:14:48.300 --> 3:14:54.300]  item that's passed on to the manufacturing process or through transportation and at all the other
[3:14:54.300 --> 3:14:59.340]  points of all these taxes that are added, but they want it so they can track what you're buying,
[3:14:59.340 --> 3:15:03.500]  what you're doing. And the system under Homeland Security, and they've stated this, will be,
[3:15:03.500 --> 3:15:07.980]  you won't have a job. You won't get on a plane. You won't buy a gun. You won't be able to buy
[3:15:07.980 --> 3:15:14.060]  anything unless you're in good terms with the federal government. That's what the New World Order
[3:15:14.060 --> 3:15:20.460]  Cashless Society is all about. So they're racing to put that in place. We have to really stand up
[3:15:20.460 --> 3:15:24.940]  against them now and slow them down because once their cashless control grid's in place,
[3:15:24.940 --> 3:15:30.700]  it's going to be a lot harder, correct, Bob? Absolutely. And this is part of world government,
[3:15:30.700 --> 3:15:35.900]  and that's what they're headed for. And all the defeatists out there are willing to accept that.
[3:15:35.900 --> 3:15:41.820]  Well, Alex and I are not, and you aren't, and most of the audience isn't, and that's what we're
[3:15:41.820 --> 3:15:45.820]  going to continue to do. We're going to go after them. When we're going to wait for them to come
[3:15:45.820 --> 3:15:51.500]  to us, we're going to engage them, and we're going to attack them. And you know something? We're
[3:15:51.500 --> 3:15:57.900]  going to conquer them. Let's go because, see, once the system is fully discredited, they stage
[3:15:57.900 --> 3:16:02.540]  terror attacks. It won't work. They start new wars. It won't work. I mean, they're getting so
[3:16:02.540 --> 3:16:07.340]  discredited that when they attack myself and others now, people go, oh, Alex must be good.
[3:16:07.340 --> 3:16:12.460]  They're attacking you. I mean, there's a certain point where people don't buy anything they say
[3:16:12.460 --> 3:16:16.300]  or do. Let's talk to Allen in Kentucky. Allen, you're on the air with Bob Chapman. Go ahead.
[3:16:20.300 --> 3:16:22.940]  I'm sorry I doubled that. Mike in New York. Mike, go ahead.
[3:16:23.660 --> 3:16:31.420]  Oh, how you doing, Alex and Bob? Excuse me. Yeah, I've been listening and I heard that
[3:16:31.420 --> 3:16:36.380]  caller. And you know, I'm not going to give up. I'm going to go out. I'm going to do what I can
[3:16:36.380 --> 3:16:44.780]  too. And you know, if it means handing out DVDs to people, which what I've been doing,
[3:16:44.780 --> 3:16:50.460]  then I'm going to do it. I'm going to do whatever I can to help wake some people up. And it has
[3:16:50.460 --> 3:16:55.820]  been, you know, I have been having, you know, in effect, people have been seeing the DVDs and
[3:16:55.820 --> 3:17:02.460]  and and they see what's going on now clearly. And a lot of people, they've been making copies
[3:17:02.460 --> 3:17:08.540]  and I and handed it out to friends and then people that they know. And and that's the way
[3:17:08.540 --> 3:17:13.980]  you do it. I mean, you have to, you have to do something. And, you know, if that's one effective
[3:17:13.980 --> 3:17:21.100]  way to do it, then, then, then let's do it, right? In the Homeland Security Literature,
[3:17:21.100 --> 3:17:26.620]  they are so angry about my films and other films being duplicated and handed out because the lie
[3:17:26.620 --> 3:17:31.980]  has to be reapplied every day. Once somebody sees the truth, they already knew most of it. It
[3:17:31.980 --> 3:17:39.500]  suddenly makes sense. The mind is unlocked. It only takes one dose of a fall the republic or
[3:17:39.500 --> 3:17:45.740]  Obama deception or American freedom to fascism for somebody to really wake up. It only takes one
[3:17:45.740 --> 3:17:51.740]  dose. And that's why they're punishing people. There's an article up at prisonplanet.com and
[3:17:51.740 --> 3:17:57.660]  info wars.com America freedom to fascism star Sherri Jackson, IRS agent is being murdered in
[3:17:57.660 --> 3:18:03.420]  prison right now. And we've got her letter about how they're killing her and not giving her a
[3:18:03.420 --> 3:18:09.340]  medication. They want to let other federal agents know that if they come out and admit that internally
[3:18:09.340 --> 3:18:14.060]  the IRS knows they work for the private fellow reserve, they know of their own people. You know,
[3:18:14.060 --> 3:18:18.860]  there's a famous photo that my parents brought back to me from East Germany after it fell,
[3:18:18.860 --> 3:18:25.420]  but it's a famous photo of right after they closed the wall back in the fifties of a little toddler.
[3:18:25.420 --> 3:18:30.220]  His parents had gone through, he got caught in the wire and an East German soldier comes over,
[3:18:30.220 --> 3:18:35.740]  untangles him. The parents are begging and he gives the child to them. They took that guy and
[3:18:35.740 --> 3:18:41.260]  tortured him to death, but he saved a child. He's a real man. And that photo is very famous in
[3:18:41.260 --> 3:18:48.060]  Germany today. And so just like they're torturing her to death, they tortured him to death and
[3:18:48.060 --> 3:18:53.740]  because they want to punish their, their, their Nazi forces, they want, when one of their forces
[3:18:53.740 --> 3:18:59.500]  does the right thing, they want to throw in the deepest dungeon or kill them to everybody needs
[3:18:59.500 --> 3:19:03.260]  to call. We have the phone numbers up there and let these criminals know that we know they're
[3:19:03.260 --> 3:19:09.260]  murdering her. Bob Chapman. I'm running that letter tomorrow in the international forecaster
[3:19:09.260 --> 3:19:17.580]  and I received it like you did. And I, I think it's tragic and there's so many people you never
[3:19:17.580 --> 3:19:25.340]  hear about that get thrown in, in, into prison for victimless crimes, we'll call them. Alan
[3:19:25.340 --> 3:19:31.900]  Stang, you know, who just died recently, he was thrown in prison because he fought the tax system.
[3:19:32.540 --> 3:19:37.100]  And of course, you know what the outcome was, the court doesn't listen and the judges do what
[3:19:37.100 --> 3:19:43.500]  they're told to do and off Alan went for a couple of years in, in prison. And, and so this is what
[3:19:43.500 --> 3:19:48.300]  they do when they get you there. Alan told me that when he was in there, they did everything
[3:19:48.300 --> 3:19:52.540]  possible to stay there. Bob, let's do one more segment. I want you to finish that story. These
[3:19:52.540 --> 3:19:57.420]  are real heroes. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what we're up against, but we're winning. Well,

[3:21:03.260 --> 3:21:07.820]  irresponsible federal deficit spending? Increasing the money supply without increasing
[3:21:07.820 --> 3:21:12.540]  productive output leads to inflation. You get less for your money. If you want to protect the
[3:21:12.540 --> 3:21:20.620]  buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Mitis Resources, 800-686-2237

[3:22:03.100 --> 3:22:07.100]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:22:07.100 --> 3:22:11.820]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[3:22:11.820 --> 3:22:17.900]  we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've turned an innocent influence on our
[3:22:17.900 --> 3:22:24.380]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[3:22:24.380 --> 3:22:29.980]  as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[3:22:29.980 --> 3:22:36.380]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[3:22:36.380 --> 3:22:41.340]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress
[3:22:41.340 --> 3:22:46.060]  is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[3:22:46.060 --> 3:22:53.660]  Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD

[3:23:03.900 --> 3:23:09.500]  This is not a drill. Repeat. This is not a drill. Gun cells are on a staggering pace.
[3:23:09.500 --> 3:23:13.420]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate vicious criminals

[3:24:15.660 --> 3:24:21.260]  Sherry Jackson IRS agent went public, exposed the fraud. They arrested her through her in prison.
[3:24:21.260 --> 3:24:26.620]  They have special tax courts that are outside of the regular law but these judges do whatever they
[3:24:26.620 --> 3:24:32.460]  want. This is the private taxing system of the offshore banks that are raping and robbing us.
[3:24:32.460 --> 3:24:37.020]  And I have a special message to the police and military and others coming up in the next segment
[3:24:37.020 --> 3:24:41.980]  but finishing up the story. He were telling about Alan Sting who died this year. Alan Sting being
[3:24:43.020 --> 3:24:48.300]  some of the things they did to him in jail. Well they did everything possible he said to
[3:24:48.300 --> 3:24:57.420]  try him to get the rules so that they could mistreat him. And fortunately for him he was
[3:24:57.420 --> 3:25:04.380]  very very careful and it didn't happen. But these kinds of cold criminals are treated that way
[3:25:04.380 --> 3:25:11.100]  because they influence society in a big way. And anybody who is a tax protester which Alan
[3:25:11.100 --> 3:25:19.980]  was at one time has a field of influence. And so that's why they did what they did to him.
[3:25:20.540 --> 3:25:26.460]  And of course as you know we wrote a number of books and there's one we've been advertising
[3:25:26.460 --> 3:25:33.900]  Pastroika Sunset which is a very good book about what happened to our men in Southeast Asia.
[3:25:34.460 --> 3:25:40.620]  And we do have a few copies of it left. But anyway that's what you can expect
[3:25:40.620 --> 3:25:46.140]  from government. They are in control. If you do lose and have to go to jail you keep your
[3:25:46.140 --> 3:25:54.140]  mouth shut and just hope that you don't have to go through with that which this
[3:25:54.780 --> 3:26:03.100]  IRS, former IRS agent has gone through. Absolutely Bob. Well in closing I'm going to come back and
[3:26:03.100 --> 3:26:06.860]  take calls and cover some news. We're going to let you go. We appreciate your weekly visit with us.
[3:26:06.860 --> 3:26:11.500]  People can go to the internationalforecaster.com. Get a free issue there. It comes out twice a week
[3:26:11.500 --> 3:26:16.940]  in the E4 amount a few times a month in the hard copy. In closing I didn't want to get into this
[3:26:16.940 --> 3:26:21.260]  whole discussion about loser attitude. That's happened one time before when a caller called in
[3:26:21.820 --> 3:26:27.820]  and said something similar. But I'm not putting a good face on it to say that we're having the
[3:26:27.820 --> 3:26:32.940]  biggest victories we've ever had week after week now. More victories than we would have in 10 years
[3:26:32.940 --> 3:26:37.980]  previously we're having in a week now. And that's only the beginning of this if people get up and
[3:26:37.980 --> 3:26:43.500]  stand up because the population is ready to hear the truth worldwide right now and the people are
[3:26:43.500 --> 3:26:49.340]  discovering this global government grid. And I just hope that everyone redoubles their efforts
[3:26:49.340 --> 3:26:54.700]  going into the new year to wake up as many people as they can and to take over their towns and cities
[3:26:54.700 --> 3:27:00.060]  peacefully through the political process. It's been the crooks and the liars and the parasites.
[3:27:00.060 --> 3:27:03.420]  They know the power of taking action so they've gone in and taken over.
[3:27:07.180 --> 3:27:11.500]  Your comments on that statement. You know they've taken over because we've allowed them to. We
[3:27:11.500 --> 3:27:18.620]  were too busy doing something else. And now with high unemployment, an economy that's spiraling
[3:27:18.620 --> 3:27:26.220]  downward, there is no recovery going on. That's just more propaganda. And unless they increase
[3:27:26.220 --> 3:27:32.460]  and have another stimulus plan, we're going to go into depression. And before we get there,
[3:27:32.460 --> 3:27:39.420]  there's going to be a lot of inflation. And so the public's going to wake up. They got to say
[3:27:39.420 --> 3:27:44.060]  to themselves, well, gee, why did this all happen? And get outside the box and listen
[3:27:44.060 --> 3:27:49.260]  to Alex and people like him who are talking about this. Well, Bob, I read earlier an L
[3:27:49.260 --> 3:27:55.740]  Centro holds position for the highest jobless rate in the country seeing in money of 32.2 percent.
[3:27:55.740 --> 3:28:03.180]  All the real indexes nationally are over 20. CNBC says 17.5. But Obama says unemployment is dropping,
[3:28:03.180 --> 3:28:10.700]  Bob. Well, yeah, the U3 is what they call that. And it just dropped from 10.2 to 10 percent.
[3:28:10.700 --> 3:28:17.660]  And you know, I have the breakdown on the jobs here. And payroll at builders declined 27,000
[3:28:17.660 --> 3:28:27.180]  after falling 56,000 the month before. And the factory payrolls fell 41,000 after decreasing
[3:28:27.180 --> 3:28:32.380]  51,000 the month before. These are the high paying jobs. Now, let's go over to where the
[3:28:32.940 --> 3:28:38.220]  jobs were created. And I'll preface this by saying these are the lowest paying jobs
[3:28:38.220 --> 3:28:43.660]  in the economy. Banks, insurance companies, restaurants and retailers.
[3:28:43.660 --> 3:28:48.300]  And that's only a microscopic Christmas bump.
[3:28:50.780 --> 3:28:58.700]  Well, it is not a truthful annual take on this thing because, you know, they
[3:28:58.700 --> 3:29:03.740]  retail is at people because it's Christmas time, as you point out. And then restaurants do more
[3:29:03.740 --> 3:29:08.220]  business because people are rushing from here to there because it's a holiday season.
[3:29:08.940 --> 3:29:13.420]  And banks and insurance companies, I don't know how many put they put on, but I don't think it was
[3:29:13.420 --> 3:29:21.420]  very many. Amazing. Bob Chapman will talk to you again coming up live next Friday in the one
[3:29:21.420 --> 3:29:26.300]  o'clock hour. Thank you for spending time with us. Have a great weekend. Thank you, Alex and
[3:29:26.300 --> 3:29:32.380]  audience. Thank you very much. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back after this quick
[3:29:32.380 --> 3:29:41.660]  break. I want to go over this. Sherri Jackson IRS agent being being slowly murdered in prison.
[3:29:41.660 --> 3:29:46.300]  I've got a message to the people out there in government to think of us as animals and think
[3:29:46.300 --> 3:29:50.620]  all their sins are cute and funny. It's not cute and you're going to be judged.
[3:29:51.820 --> 3:29:58.540]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[3:30:58.300 --> 3:31:08.540]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[3:31:08.540 --> 3:31:13.660]  relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[3:31:13.660 --> 3:31:19.900]  the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[3:31:19.900 --> 3:31:26.140]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:31:26.140 --> 3:31:31.980]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell
[3:31:31.980 --> 3:31:37.020]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[3:31:37.020 --> 3:31:41.340]  Bernanke, and arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[3:31:41.340 --> 3:31:45.980]  who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington,
[3:31:45.980 --> 3:31:53.020]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on dvd

[3:32:01.660 --> 3:32:06.380]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[3:32:06.380 --> 3:32:11.260]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all
[3:32:11.260 --> 3:32:17.100]  I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[3:32:17.100 --> 3:32:22.380]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[3:32:22.380 --> 3:32:27.020]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[3:32:27.020 --> 3:32:31.580]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:32:31.580 --> 3:32:36.300]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:32:36.300 --> 3:32:41.740]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[3:32:41.740 --> 3:32:47.100]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live
[3:32:47.100 --> 3:32:55.820]  to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:32:55.820 --> 3:33:25.420]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633. I just realized I've done two hours, three hours,
[3:33:25.820 --> 3:33:31.580]  and 33 minutes. Three hours and 33 minutes of radio. I haven't even plugged any of our sponsors.
[3:33:31.580 --> 3:33:35.340]  I'm going to do that. Then I'm going to have a little message to the police, military,
[3:33:35.340 --> 3:33:40.540]  government bureaucrats. I understand your mindset, your psychology. I'm going to talk directly to you
[3:33:40.540 --> 3:33:43.900]  here in just a moment. First, I want to tell you about some of our sponsors. You've heard all the
[3:33:43.900 --> 3:33:48.300]  medical doctors here on the show talking about colloidal silver, nano silver, how good it is
[3:33:48.300 --> 3:33:53.340]  against bacteria and viruses. And one of the greatest delivery systems is the lungs, and they
[3:33:53.340 --> 3:34:02.060]  have details about that at silverlungs.com. Silverlungs.com, the silver lung generator is a
[3:34:02.060 --> 3:34:06.060]  highly-caused, effective colloidal silver generator, and lung delivery system that produces pure and
[3:34:06.060 --> 3:34:10.460]  endless colloidal silver and delivers the solution directly in the bloodstream. The mucous membranes
[3:34:10.460 --> 3:34:13.900]  of the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens. The silver
[3:34:13.900 --> 3:34:18.940]  lung generator instantly arms these mucous membranes with nano-sized silver. Go to silverlungs.com
[3:34:18.940 --> 3:34:22.460]  and be sure to check out their complete line of colloidal silver generators and very affordable
[3:34:22.460 --> 3:34:28.140]  ready-made ionic silver solutions, or check out their banner on prisonplanet.com at silverlungs.com.
[3:34:28.140 --> 3:34:34.620]  Also, the atmospheric water generator, it grabs seven and a half gallons a day in average humidity
[3:34:34.620 --> 3:34:38.380]  out of the air. That's their smaller unit. Looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on
[3:34:38.380 --> 3:34:45.900]  top. It's a coloblue, a coloblue.com, a fabulous line of products. The atmospheric water generator
[3:34:45.900 --> 3:34:54.540]  I use in my home, a coloblue.com, or give them a call at 800-691-6043. That's 800-691-6043.
[3:34:55.500 --> 3:35:00.540]  Yes, there is water in the atmosphere and you can grab it out. Then it goes through seven stage
[3:35:00.540 --> 3:35:05.740]  filter process and is stored in a tank stainless steel on the bottom. It has hot water and cold
[3:35:05.740 --> 3:35:13.020]  water. It's just a really great unit, a coloblue.com, 800-691-6043. And finally, I want to tell you
[3:35:13.020 --> 3:35:18.460]  about Front Sight Firearms Training, FrontSight.com, like the front of your rifle. FrontSight.com is
[3:35:18.460 --> 3:35:23.020]  the premier private firearms training in the country. A lot of military and police go there to tune
[3:35:23.020 --> 3:35:27.020]  up their training to above law enforcement and military training. It's the biggest private
[3:35:27.980 --> 3:35:31.260]  firearms training center in the country. They have a lot of free information on their site,
[3:35:31.260 --> 3:35:35.900]  FrontSight.com. They're based outside Paramp, Nevada. There's no drill instructor or tough guy
[3:35:35.900 --> 3:35:42.060]  attitude. It's family-friendly and it's just a really great to find out about it. It's FrontSight.com.
[3:35:42.060 --> 3:35:47.740]  You can also get 30 steak and seal weapons permit, five days of world-class gun training and receive

[3:35:53.660 --> 3:36:02.620]  that's FrontSight.com. And last but not least, I have an online video bookstore with t-shirts,

[3:36:18.460 --> 3:36:22.460]  concert and people are wearing. I went to a Megadeth concert I was invited to by Dave Mustaine this
[3:36:22.460 --> 3:36:27.420]  week in Dallas and I mean I saw my shirts everywhere. Most of them were homemade. Make a homemade one

[3:37:52.860 --> 3:37:59.180]  section. Okay, I want to take about a three minute breather here before I really give this message
[3:37:59.180 --> 3:38:03.740]  to the police and military. Well, you guys get that Switzerland newscast about why Switzerland
[3:38:03.740 --> 3:38:08.860]  has the lowest, lowest crime rate. Remember that video I gave you this morning? As soon as you get
[3:38:08.860 --> 3:38:12.700]  that queued up, I want to play that because it's a message I want to put out there about why their
[3:38:12.700 --> 3:38:17.900]  crime rate is so low and how our founding fathers went off the Swiss model. That's really where
[3:38:17.900 --> 3:38:23.740]  our model came from, where everyone must own a gun by law and you have to do drills where you
[3:38:23.740 --> 3:38:27.980]  practice hiding them from the government in case the government is taken over by tyranny. The
[3:38:27.980 --> 3:38:32.700]  government teaches the people if the government ever says give your guns in, that's a tyranny
[3:38:32.700 --> 3:38:38.140]  and under federal law, they are to resist it with lethal force. That's what our founders fought too.
[3:38:38.140 --> 3:38:43.020]  I mean, as soon as they say give us your guns, they are criminal, they are corrupt, they are bad,
[3:38:43.020 --> 3:38:50.300]  they are illegitimate, they are evil. And we have just put up with this for far too long in this
[3:38:50.300 --> 3:38:54.220]  society. So I want to play this clip and then come back with a special message to those in the
[3:38:54.220 --> 3:38:59.180]  establishment that are violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution and are not guardians of the
[3:38:59.180 --> 3:39:08.060]  Republic. 50. It's designed to destroy anything standing within its 400 meter trajectory.
[3:39:08.060 --> 3:39:16.060]  And there are over 500,000 of them kept in Swiss homes. Guns and shooting are a strong Swiss tradition.
[3:39:16.060 --> 3:39:22.060]  Basic military training is mandatory for young men and afterwards they're required to keep their
[3:39:22.060 --> 3:39:28.300]  weapon at home. Mark Heim is the Titrina representative for the lobby group Protel.
[3:39:28.300 --> 3:39:41.420]  Basically this was my father's military rifle and of course he got to keep it when he was finished.
[3:39:42.540 --> 3:39:50.380]  I have my grandfather's rifle in the office hanging on the wall. This was mine when I did
[3:39:50.380 --> 3:39:58.860]  service, which is quite an old one. It was introduced in 1957. It was used until 1990.
[3:39:59.420 --> 3:40:06.620]  And this is my son's. That's the current model. That's what's being used today.
[3:40:07.900 --> 3:40:10.700]  That's what we'll be using to shoot the Feldschießen today.
[3:40:11.500 --> 3:40:16.940]  The Feldschießen, or Tiro Federale in Campania as it's known in these parts, is an annual Swiss
[3:40:16.940 --> 3:40:22.940]  event and it's also the largest shooting festival in the world. Roughly 200,000 people come out to
[3:40:22.940 --> 3:40:29.980]  target practice all across the country. Ammunition is provided by the government. Heim goes regularly
[3:40:29.980 --> 3:40:37.500]  to this range and it's often a family affair. It was organized by the government to have a very
[3:40:37.500 --> 3:40:43.900]  high state of readiness for the Swiss military and population. The target has always been that
[3:40:43.900 --> 3:40:51.660]  within 24 to 48 hours, Switzerland could mobilize a pretty large army, I mean, even by European standards.
[3:40:58.140 --> 3:41:02.060]  But it wasn't the militia that sparked Heim's interest in Ganges, a young man.
[3:41:02.620 --> 3:41:09.420]  It was an unassuming trip to a Holocaust museum. I was going through all the exhibits and the soap
[3:41:09.420 --> 3:41:17.500]  and the lampshades made of people's skin and while I was looking I heard a funny noise and there
[3:41:17.500 --> 3:41:28.220]  was an old woman maybe two meters from me and she was trying not to cry. She was sort of sobbing
[3:41:28.220 --> 3:41:31.580]  very quietly. She was holding it back. If she had been a few meters further away, I wouldn't have
[3:41:31.580 --> 3:41:40.140]  heard her and she obviously had gone through that. That's when the whole impact of it hit me and I
[3:41:40.140 --> 3:41:48.860]  promised myself I would never be in her situation. I would want to be free, never in a situation where
[3:41:48.860 --> 3:41:56.620]  somebody could, you know, march us off to ovens or prisons or just take away our freedom. The
[3:41:56.620 --> 3:42:02.460]  key to freedom is the ability to be able to defend yourself and if you don't have the tools to do
[3:42:02.460 --> 3:42:09.900]  that then you are at the mercy of whoever wants to put you away and the tools for that are guns.
[3:42:13.020 --> 3:42:22.860]  Absolutely well well said there in that short video. You see we got the secret homeland security
[3:42:22.860 --> 3:42:27.820]  and Mayak documents earlier in the year. We broke it. People couldn't believe it when it said Ron
[3:42:27.820 --> 3:42:32.380]  Paul supporters were terrorists, gun owners were terrorists, returning veterans with the main threat
[3:42:32.380 --> 3:42:38.140]  that homeland security was really built to rob the American people. It's a internal police force
[3:42:38.140 --> 3:42:44.300]  like the Soviets or the Nazis had to make you thumb scan, face scan, national ID card to buy and
[3:42:44.300 --> 3:42:48.220]  sell. They're now seeing if you're on the no fly list that they just put you on with no evidence.
[3:42:48.220 --> 3:42:53.900]  You won't be able to buy a gun. This is the hardcore tyranny and I know the police and
[3:42:53.900 --> 3:42:58.140]  military are brainwashed how the public doesn't like them and they're the only line of defense
[3:42:59.340 --> 3:43:05.820]  against anarchy and oh they're out there stopping lawlessness and to a great extent that's true
[3:43:05.820 --> 3:43:09.500]  because they're doing some things that are good and then a lot of things that are bad as well
[3:43:10.620 --> 3:43:15.500]  and you have a federal government that has been taken over by private offshore banks
[3:43:15.500 --> 3:43:19.900]  and it's illegitimate and criminal and violates the bill of rights and constitution from one
[3:43:19.900 --> 3:43:27.740]  end to the other and that's a very simple equation that I know you can understand
[3:43:28.780 --> 3:43:35.180]  servants of the system. I have seen police. I have seen judges. I have seen bureaucrats relish
[3:43:35.180 --> 3:43:40.940]  setting people up relish framing people relish beating somebody up and then saying that they
[3:43:40.940 --> 3:43:49.820]  assaulted you. I have seen how we've been trained that evil and corruption and deception is manly
[3:43:49.820 --> 3:43:56.780]  and cool and Jack Bauer on 24 tortures innocent people but he's a good guy and all these other
[3:43:56.780 --> 3:44:04.140]  programs brainwashing us turning the American people into evil corrupt creatures. Our country
[3:44:04.140 --> 3:44:09.100]  has been illegitimately hijacked. It's bigger than the political parties. It's a financial
[3:44:09.100 --> 3:44:16.540]  dictatorship and the government is a crooked corrupt fraud period. Now the American people
[3:44:16.540 --> 3:44:21.900]  don't want physical war with the criminal system but it's going to want physical war and it's
[3:44:21.900 --> 3:44:30.060]  engaged in physical war against us every day and people everywhere are waking up to this injustice
[3:44:30.060 --> 3:44:35.580]  and I just want the police and military and bureaucrats and everyone else to realize
[3:44:35.580 --> 3:44:42.140]  the American people and the people of the world who are being tyrannized are human beings. We have
[3:44:42.140 --> 3:44:48.860]  value when you falsely charge us or falsely arrest us or falsely persecute us or when these
[3:44:48.860 --> 3:44:54.540]  grand juries become kept creatures of the of the of the prosecutor and engage in corruption against
[3:44:54.540 --> 3:45:01.020]  good people throw the book at innocent patriots but release violent offenders. You are committing
[3:45:01.020 --> 3:45:06.540]  massive frauds and massive crimes and it doesn't matter if your corrupt system gives you a green
[3:45:06.540 --> 3:45:12.220]  light to do it and tells you it's okay. You know in your gut it's wrong and it's not cute and it's
[3:45:12.220 --> 3:45:24.940]  not funny. Now as a society we are at a crossroads and I just ask servants of the establishment
[3:45:24.940 --> 3:45:30.220]  even if you've engaged in corruption and lied to yourself about it and rationalized why you're
[3:45:30.220 --> 3:45:36.700]  doing it it's not too late for you to turn back and just at least start being a better person and
[3:45:36.700 --> 3:45:41.420]  start treating people like human beings and stop engaging in corruption and violations of the
[3:45:41.420 --> 3:45:46.220]  Bill of Rights and Constitution because the bankers have decided to bring us into depression. They
[3:45:46.220 --> 3:45:51.260]  decided to set up a police state. They decided to try to forcibly inoculate people. They've decided
[3:45:51.260 --> 3:45:56.620]  to corner people and force the population to fight back and more and more of that is going to happen
[3:45:56.620 --> 3:46:03.260]  and in the end the police and military that try to engage the American people in tyranny
[3:46:03.980 --> 3:46:09.580]  are going to be known as enemies of the republic and are going to be known in history as scum
[3:46:09.580 --> 3:46:14.220]  and are going to be brought to justice so you need to listen to me very careful right now.
[3:46:14.220 --> 3:46:19.900]  It is time for you to unharden your hearts and to really reflect this weekend on who you are
[3:46:19.900 --> 3:46:27.420]  and what you are and who you want to be in this short life. It is now time for you to do the right
[3:46:27.420 --> 3:46:35.180]  thing. I hope you'll do the right thing but at least reflect on what our country and what our
[3:46:35.180 --> 3:46:42.940]  world has turned into and ask yourself do you want to change course in your life because if you
[3:46:42.940 --> 3:46:48.060]  don't know this government's corrupt if you don't know our society's imploding if you don't know
[3:46:48.060 --> 3:46:52.700]  that the government's illegitimate and if you don't understand it's growing like a cancer
[3:46:52.700 --> 3:46:57.740]  you are blind something is wrong with you something is fundamentally screwed up with you
[3:46:59.740 --> 3:47:07.660]  there I've said it now we have an article up on info wars.com America from the fascism star
[3:47:07.660 --> 3:47:14.620]  sherry jackson is being murdered I would have the headline valiant inside irs whistleblower
[3:47:14.620 --> 3:47:19.340]  being politically persecuted and tortured I don't know about being a star I don't ever think of
[3:47:19.340 --> 3:47:25.660]  this work we do is being stars but my heart breaks how do those continue to sit by as our
[3:47:25.660 --> 3:47:30.220]  fellow human beings are put behind bars and treated as subhuman have we lost touch with our
[3:47:30.220 --> 3:47:36.940]  humanity yes and when we lose touch with our humanity then everybody starts getting abused
[3:47:36.940 --> 3:47:42.060]  because people then accept it I see hundreds of movies now every movie where they show tasering
[3:47:42.060 --> 3:47:47.980]  and being tortured is fun they're selling us that torture is cute and funny I pray for those behind

[3:48:47.900 --> 3:48:52.780]  because i am concerned that my health and my life prior to becoming a political prisoner i was the
[3:48:52.780 --> 3:48:58.620]  picture of health in late june 2009 i started experiencing a rapid heartbeat on an irregular
[3:48:58.620 --> 3:49:07.180]  basis that's because it's all gmo all um soy which is filled with estrogen all msg that
[3:49:07.180 --> 3:49:12.060]  it's a chemical weapons what they feed people in prison since this has happened and frequently in
[3:49:12.060 --> 3:49:16.140]  the past i did not think much of it however in mid july it started happening on a regular basis
[3:49:16.140 --> 3:49:21.020]  and i became concerned i wanted the medical staff twice in mid july only to be given one
[3:49:21.740 --> 3:49:27.100]  minute ekg tests and powerful meds without proper diagnosis i did not take the meds because i had
[3:49:27.100 --> 3:49:35.820]  not seen a specialist one week later on july 21st i felt the i let the dormant flip flops to go tell
[3:49:35.820 --> 3:49:39.980]  the officers i was having a heart attack the officers on duty called the ambulance and the
[3:49:39.980 --> 3:49:45.660]  ambulance checked my heart for their profile ekg system machine it was beating at 150 beats per
[3:49:45.660 --> 3:49:51.660]  minute they took me to a hospital where i remained until friday during my hospital say it was determined
[3:49:51.660 --> 3:49:56.300]  that my heart was healthy but my thyroid was producing too much hormones see everybody's
[3:49:56.300 --> 3:50:00.380]  having their their thyroids removed right now from all the chemicals in the food thus speeding up my
[3:50:00.380 --> 3:50:06.220]  heart this is called hyperthyroidism or grave disease i was given two medications for the hospital
[3:50:07.020 --> 3:50:12.460]  and then it goes on the hospital doctor told me four weeks later the prison medical unit
[3:50:12.460 --> 3:50:16.220]  was to do blood tests to determine how the thyroid medication was affecting my body the blood test
[3:50:16.220 --> 3:50:21.100]  was taken in late august and i was told i would be placed on the appropriate schedule and it goes on
[3:50:21.100 --> 3:50:27.820]  from there and then it just goes into how they're now denying her care even though they admit she
[3:50:27.820 --> 3:50:36.460]  has this problem and it's just unbelievable it's it's a long letter it's up on the site but it's
