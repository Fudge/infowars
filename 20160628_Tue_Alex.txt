[00:00.000 --> 00:25.960]  This is going to be another incredible broadcast, but particularly sub.
[00:25.960 --> 00:31.640]  I spent hours this morning, uh, riveted, watching the press conference of the Republican
[00:31.640 --> 00:37.040]  congressional findings on Benghazi that dovetails with our own research.
[00:37.040 --> 00:38.360]  Of course, it goes a lot further.
[00:38.360 --> 00:42.720]  We've known since day one what Benghazi was really about, but this just confirms our
[00:42.720 --> 00:45.120]  own sources, our own whistleblowers.
[00:45.120 --> 00:49.200]  And then I spent some time this morning trying to read part of the report, but it's over
[00:49.200 --> 00:51.400]  800 pages long.
[00:51.400 --> 00:57.240]  There's a supplemental report about the political actions around it, and Hillary's emails admitting
[00:57.240 --> 01:01.800]  they had to cover it up, had to lie that it was a terrorist attack, uh, because they
[01:01.800 --> 01:06.440]  were 50-something days out from an election, uh, extremely powerful information.
[01:06.440 --> 01:10.600]  And if this doesn't bring Hillary down, nothing will.
[01:10.600 --> 01:14.120]  But after the break, I'm going to go into exactly why all this unfolded.
[01:14.120 --> 01:21.440]  If you go back to our first interviews with Colonel Shaffer and, uh, Dr. Steve Pacinic,
[01:21.440 --> 01:28.600]  and of course, uh, a lot of other people like, uh, the famous CIA contractor, whistleblower,
[01:28.600 --> 01:34.080]  Tosh Plumlee, everything they said has turned out to be absolutely dead on.
[01:34.080 --> 01:37.920]  And, and, and by the way, whenever I have Colonel Shaffer or Plumlee or other people
[01:37.920 --> 01:41.680]  on who, uh, and Shaffer's been a contributor to Fox News, you know, they get calls from
[01:41.680 --> 01:46.600]  Fox reporters, and they're always wanting to go report on it, including CNN has wanted
[01:46.600 --> 01:48.280]  to report, and then they're told they can't.
[01:48.280 --> 01:53.480]  So the reason we get these incredible whistleblowers on and, and, uh, insiders is because other
[01:53.480 --> 01:55.440]  folks are just too scared to do it.
[01:55.440 --> 02:00.680]  Uh, speaking of that, it was two years ago this month that Jakari Jackson had done Salazar
[02:00.680 --> 02:04.640]  and the rest of our great crew like Kit Daniels, uh, and the camera crew, John Bown, you name
[02:04.640 --> 02:09.480]  it, went down to the border and showed the illegals being brought in by the board patrol
[02:09.480 --> 02:14.320]  under orders and put on buses and shipped to Democratic party facilities.
[02:14.320 --> 02:18.280]  We sent our crew back down there because finally local news is admitting that's happening
[02:18.280 --> 02:21.480]  and our crew got some of the most powerful footage ever.
[02:21.480 --> 02:25.400]  Board patrol agent admits that Obama orders them to ship people in with diseases.
[02:25.400 --> 02:28.840]  Uh, we have our reporters confronting illegals coming across.
[02:28.840 --> 02:30.240]  This is huge.
[02:30.240 --> 02:35.320]  But first I want to play part of Nigel Farage, leader of the UKIP party in the EU parliament
[02:35.320 --> 02:40.720]  that's, that's a ceremonial group, uh, saying you're not laughing now.
[02:40.720 --> 02:41.720]  Isn't it funny?
[02:41.720 --> 02:48.240]  You know, when I came here 17 years ago and I said, but I wanted to lead a campaign to
[02:48.240 --> 02:53.600]  get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me.
[02:53.600 --> 02:56.600]  Well, I have to say you're not laughing now.
[02:56.600 --> 02:57.600]  Are you?
[02:57.600 --> 03:04.680]  And the reason you're so upset, the reason you're so angry has been perfectly clear from
[03:04.680 --> 03:07.440]  all the angry exchanges this morning.
[03:07.440 --> 03:11.720]  You as a political project are in denial.
[03:11.720 --> 03:15.080]  You're in denial that your currency is failing.
[03:15.080 --> 03:17.080]  You're in denial.
[03:17.080 --> 03:20.680]  Well, just, well, just look at the Mediterranean.
[03:20.680 --> 03:27.360]  No, no, no, as a, as a policy to impose poverty on Greece and the rest of the Mediterranean,
[03:27.360 --> 03:28.920]  you've done very well.
[03:28.920 --> 03:36.680]  And you're in denial over Mrs Merkel's call last year for as many, any people as possible
[03:36.680 --> 03:41.760]  to cross the Mediterranean into the European Union has led to massive divisions between
[03:41.760 --> 03:44.000]  countries and within countries.
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.680]  But the biggest problem you've got and the reason, the main reason the United Kingdom
[03:49.680 --> 03:57.600]  voted the way that it did is you have by stealth, by deception, without ever telling the truth
[03:57.600 --> 04:02.240]  to the British or the rest of the peoples of Europe.
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.840]  You have imposed upon them a political union.
[04:06.840 --> 04:12.920]  You've imposed upon them a political union and when the people in 2005 in the Netherlands
[04:12.920 --> 04:18.240]  and France voted against that political union, when they rejected the constitution, you simply
[04:18.240 --> 04:20.960]  ignored them and brought the Lisbon Treaty in.
[04:20.960 --> 04:23.360]  Let's fade that down.
[04:23.360 --> 04:27.000]  Now later the broadcast, if I have time, I'm going to illustrate the raw feed of what happened
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.520]  versus that BBC edit that that's got about a minute left or two minutes left when they
[04:31.520 --> 04:37.960]  have the EU president confront Nigel Farage, kind of the Ron Paul slash, you know, info
[04:37.960 --> 04:40.200]  wars of Europe.
[04:40.200 --> 04:44.120]  They're yelling at him and won't let him talk and calling him names when he counters them
[04:44.120 --> 04:47.080]  and says, you know, you were laughing before you're not laughing now.
[04:47.080 --> 04:52.280]  But when you go to CNN or BBC with the clips, it's like Farage insults them, is mean out
[04:52.280 --> 04:54.480]  of the gates and taunts them.
[04:54.480 --> 04:59.040]  So he was responding to them, screaming names of him.
[04:59.040 --> 05:04.480]  Tis the season for the thought police headline from the Daily Caller.
[05:04.480 --> 05:09.360]  The University of North Carolina Christmas Vacation is a microaggression now at the
[05:09.360 --> 05:12.160]  University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.
[05:12.160 --> 05:17.920]  The taxpayer funded guide entitled Career Corner understanding microaggressions identifies
[05:17.920 --> 05:23.880]  golf outings and the words boyfriend and girlfriend as microaggressions.
[05:23.880 --> 05:29.400]  Simply saying to a woman, I love your shoes is a microaggression because it insists that
[05:29.400 --> 05:35.240]  the shoe admirer values appearances more than intellectual contributions.
[05:35.240 --> 05:40.320]  Asking anyone where are you from is now a microaggression since it implies that you're
[05:40.320 --> 05:43.520]  not American and you do not belong in the community.
[05:43.520 --> 05:49.880]  Even scheduling your vacation around religious observations such as Christmas diminishes non-Christian
[05:49.880 --> 05:52.680]  spiritual rituals and observances.
[05:52.680 --> 05:58.680]  This has been Ashley Beckford reporting, you can find more special reports at Infowars.com.

[08:14.200 --> 08:43.720]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday, the 28th day of June 2000 and 16.
[08:43.720 --> 08:51.000]  It's hard to believe this year is already half over.
[08:51.000 --> 08:52.160]  Where should we start?
[08:52.160 --> 08:54.960]  Where should we begin today?
[08:54.960 --> 08:59.480]  Well coming up we have Gerald Salente, the Trends forecaster.
[08:59.480 --> 09:05.280]  We have Congressman David Bratt who of course defeated one of the Republican establishment
[09:05.280 --> 09:12.120]  minions and who is a populist firebrand joining us to talk about a host of issues and we're
[09:12.120 --> 09:16.520]  all show going to have Paul Joseph Watson from London, England hosting the Overdrive
[09:16.520 --> 09:19.960]  4th Hour.
[09:19.960 --> 09:24.200]  But I do want to also open the phones up in that third hour and I'm going to try to open
[09:24.200 --> 09:30.920]  the phones up in this first hour and not hog all the airtime to my shelf.
[09:30.920 --> 09:35.720]  A lot has happened, obviously there's the new Republican Benghazi report, I watched
[09:35.720 --> 09:42.440]  most of the Hour Plus long press conference this morning and really couldn't find any fault
[09:42.440 --> 09:43.440]  with what they were saying.
[09:43.440 --> 09:47.840]  Though they had one Republican female congresswoman and she spoke so quick I couldn't write her
[09:47.840 --> 09:48.840]  name down.
[09:48.840 --> 09:52.680]  I want to go to the transcript, she goes, we're just lucky Gaddafi's militia didn't
[09:52.680 --> 09:59.000]  strike as much as they stood down and I was like what?
[09:59.000 --> 10:04.320]  These were Wahhabist al-Qaeda people who'd taken over Benghazi who were overthrowing
[10:04.320 --> 10:09.160]  the country and who had overthrown it and who were transferring weapons into Syria to
[10:09.160 --> 10:16.280]  take over the next country and Gaddafi had been fighting al-Qaeda.
[10:16.280 --> 10:20.200]  Gaddafi had nothing to do with Benghazi but other than that, I mean the whole thing was
[10:20.200 --> 10:21.200]  pretty accurate.
[10:21.200 --> 10:25.840]  I haven't had time obviously to read the whole A&R to Page report, I've got a synopsis of
[10:25.840 --> 10:30.640]  it, we're printing off the report as we speak.
[10:30.640 --> 10:38.880]  But they did point out that you could read this report in less time than they stood down.
[10:38.880 --> 10:45.120]  But I'm going to get in a nutshell to what Benghazi really was and it's the same thing
[10:45.120 --> 10:48.480]  I said four years ago and it's the same thing that's now been vetted out and proven that
[10:48.480 --> 10:54.400]  we were dead on with our sources four years ago.
[10:54.400 --> 10:58.120]  But Obama didn't just order a stand down in Benghazi so that weapons could be transferred
[10:58.120 --> 11:02.880]  to Syria and the ambassador and the security forces didn't all evacuate like they were
[11:02.880 --> 11:08.960]  ordered to and the al-Qaeda folks showed up to get their weapons and the ambassador did
[11:08.960 --> 11:12.480]  his job and he was killed and there was a stand down.
[11:12.480 --> 11:17.160]  It was the Benghazi security forces that came and did this.
[11:17.160 --> 11:25.800]  We've known that since the week it happened from Colonel Shaffer, from Tash Plumlee, from
[11:25.800 --> 11:32.360]  Steve Pachanik, I just had Steve Pachanik on again yesterday but I'm really tempted
[11:32.360 --> 11:34.840]  to get him on for like 10 minutes today just on this report.
[11:34.840 --> 11:39.800]  In fact, let's see if we can do that at the start of one, just for one segment, his statement
[11:39.800 --> 11:46.760]  on Benghazi because you can go back to Pachanik a week after Benghazi or even less coming
[11:46.760 --> 11:52.480]  on and laying everything out.
[11:52.480 --> 12:01.120]  And that's because he just has all the sources, all of them, being someone that was one of
[12:01.120 --> 12:08.240]  the expert brain trusts with General Boykin and others, Schumacher and others, Schumacher
[12:08.240 --> 12:14.960]  shedding up Delta Force and other units and of course being the undersecretary of Assistant
[12:14.960 --> 12:20.200]  to State, he haunched so many operations that then he was able to immediately break down
[12:20.200 --> 12:23.000]  exactly what happened.
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.880]  But let me tell you, it's creepy, it's not fun to be first on so many issues and to
[12:28.880 --> 12:29.880]  be proven right.
[12:29.880 --> 12:35.960]  It's a very scary position, it's a very dangerous position, it's very frustrating to know that
[12:35.960 --> 12:40.600]  mainstream media has access to a lot of these same sources and chooses instead to cover
[12:40.600 --> 12:43.160]  up or focus on side issues.
[12:43.160 --> 12:46.880]  But I'm going to speak more about that today but I'll tell you, watching that press conference
[12:46.880 --> 12:52.040]  reminded me of a lot of things that I'd forgotten about or kind of shelved in the back of my
[12:52.040 --> 13:08.400]  mind and it also just illustrated how twisted the Obama administration and the Clintons are
[13:08.400 --> 13:13.400]  because I'd forgotten that the State Department withheld requested weapons to agents because
[13:13.400 --> 13:17.360]  they were not aesthetically pleasing.
[13:17.360 --> 13:22.840]  These people are so anti the image of a human with a gun to protect themselves that if a
[13:22.840 --> 13:27.840]  gun's scary looking, they'd even let their own protectors have them.
[13:27.840 --> 13:32.360]  That's the deep mental illness of these people.
[13:32.360 --> 13:36.480]  That's like George Clinton, he doesn't get the irony or Michael Moore that on average
[13:36.480 --> 13:39.040]  they have five or six bodyguards.
[13:39.040 --> 13:43.480]  There were news reports that one villa, he has over $100 million in Europe, has more
[13:43.480 --> 13:46.480]  than 10 armed security personnel when he's there.
[13:46.480 --> 13:51.440]  He has guys with submachine guns guarding him but he doesn't want a single mom living
[13:51.440 --> 13:57.160]  in Detroit, Michigan working two jobs to have a 38 revolver under her pillow to protect
[13:57.160 --> 13:59.760]  herself.
[13:59.760 --> 14:03.360]  He just gets up there arrogantly on TV and says, no, turn your guns in, you shouldn't
[14:03.360 --> 14:05.840]  be able to have them.
[14:05.840 --> 14:10.320]  And then he walks out off a set, there's guys in suits, former commandos, you know,
[14:10.320 --> 14:13.160]  with guns strapped to their hips.
[14:13.160 --> 14:19.400]  You go, hey, you got bodyguards and they just go, shut up, right wing racist.
[14:19.400 --> 14:23.280]  It's like Bono and you too, who's made billions of dollars.
[14:23.280 --> 14:25.800]  I keep harping on this because it's so incredible.
[14:25.800 --> 14:31.040]  He was giving less than 1% and when he got in trouble for it, he gave like 1.2% and he
[14:31.040 --> 14:34.800]  got up on TV and say, send us money, we're going to give money to starving Africans.
[14:34.800 --> 14:40.160]  It's so cold-blooded but because he wears little trendy outfits and red sunglasses and
[14:40.160 --> 14:45.280]  acts all foppish and liberal, it's okay.
[14:45.280 --> 14:52.240]  It's like Kanye West saying, I'm broke, send me $25 million and it turns out he's worth
[14:52.240 --> 14:53.800]  hundreds of millions and it didn't broke.
[14:53.800 --> 14:56.600]  He just wanted to pimp his audience.
[14:56.600 --> 14:57.600]  He hates them.
[14:57.600 --> 15:00.240]  Why wouldn't you love your supporters and fans?
[15:00.240 --> 15:03.120]  I just don't get it.
[15:03.120 --> 15:06.960]  He's so upside down but that's the nature of a predator.
[15:06.960 --> 15:16.320]  That's the nature of a Bono or a Zuckerberg or a Cayenne West as I call him, aka Gayfish.
[15:16.320 --> 15:19.880]  It's just frustrating.
[15:19.880 --> 15:23.800]  These people are so, you look at Kanye West's eyes.
[15:23.800 --> 15:29.640]  He is so immature and so evil and so narcissistic and so unhappy.
[15:29.640 --> 15:31.200]  He looks like a spoiled three-year-old.
[15:31.200 --> 15:36.240]  There's been a really spoiled three-year-old kid, little boy that has that angry little
[15:36.240 --> 15:39.040]  petulant potentate look in their eye.
[15:39.040 --> 15:40.040]  That's what he's got.
[15:40.040 --> 15:41.040]  That's what Zuckerberg's got.
[15:41.040 --> 15:45.960]  He's at a press conference and he goes, yeah, my users that trust me to not share their
[15:45.960 --> 15:50.720]  data are a bunch of dumb Fs.
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.360]  Unlike the famous Andy Griffith face from the crowd film, 1957, I just watched that
[15:55.360 --> 15:56.360]  last week again.
[15:56.360 --> 15:57.360]  It's so powerful.
[15:57.360 --> 16:01.880]  It made him so famous where he's like, you know, this supposed guy that cares for everybody
[16:01.880 --> 16:06.360]  but he gets caught with a hot mic calling his supporters a bunch of dumb scum.
[16:06.360 --> 16:10.520]  I remember watching that movie when I was a kid with my mom who were down here one summer
[16:10.520 --> 16:11.520]  visiting family in Austin.
[16:11.520 --> 16:13.680]  She took me to the Paramount and saw it.
[16:13.680 --> 16:17.440]  I remember thinking, that's not really how that works because somebody that's so popular
[16:17.440 --> 16:22.520]  with their fans and getting rich, you know, in the media with their fans should love their
[16:22.520 --> 16:23.520]  fans.
[16:23.520 --> 16:28.080]  It's like a plant loving sunlight.
[16:28.080 --> 16:35.700]  But as I grew older, I realized, no, no, no, no, the predators get off on doing bad things.
[16:35.700 --> 16:40.240]  The predators enjoy it, but look, look, I'm digressing.
[16:40.240 --> 16:45.120]  It's just that all these liberal supporters, particularly right now, because that's the
[16:45.120 --> 16:48.120]  cutting edge of the establishment's attack right now is via the left, they'll switch
[16:48.120 --> 16:49.680]  back to control right soon enough.
[16:49.680 --> 16:50.680]  Don't worry.
[16:50.680 --> 16:55.680]  That's what they do historically, but their fans, their supporters believe they're on
[16:55.680 --> 17:03.000]  some winning bandwagon and the joke is on them.
[17:03.000 --> 17:09.640]  The joke is on them completely and totally and really irrevocably in many cases because
[17:09.640 --> 17:13.560]  people can't admit they've been conned and look, I've told this story probably a hundred
[17:13.560 --> 17:14.560]  times.
[17:14.560 --> 17:15.560]  I'll tell it briefly again.
[17:15.560 --> 17:19.160]  We're going to go to break back with all the news.
[17:19.160 --> 17:24.440]  When the whole Nigerian email scam started 20 years ago, I instantly obviously found
[17:24.440 --> 17:28.200]  out it was a scam, just because someone's not going to say, send me $5,000, I'm going
[17:28.200 --> 17:29.600]  to send you a million dollars.
[17:29.600 --> 17:33.400]  But people want to believe that they finally hit it rich.
[17:33.400 --> 17:41.600]  So 10 years into the scam, I would tell people I knew, even some family, not real close cousins,
[17:41.600 --> 17:42.600]  that it was a scam.
[17:42.600 --> 17:44.800]  And they would get mad at me saying, you're just jealous.
[17:44.800 --> 17:45.800]  I've got this opportunity.
[17:45.800 --> 17:53.220]  I'm going to get to meet Prince, whatever his name is at the point.
[17:53.220 --> 17:58.840]  And there was even a talk show host on GCN, it was like 13, 14 years ago, who hadn't even
[17:58.840 --> 17:59.840]  listened to their show.
[17:59.840 --> 18:00.840]  I don't listen to hardly any of the shows.
[18:00.840 --> 18:02.680]  I'm too busy.
[18:02.680 --> 18:05.480]  But I heard they were saying, yes, I'm going to have millions of dollars from this Nigerian
[18:05.480 --> 18:06.480]  Prince.
[18:06.480 --> 18:07.480]  Somebody told me, so I called them up.
[18:07.480 --> 18:12.080]  I got their number from the network and I said, listen, that's a well-known scam.
[18:12.080 --> 18:13.080]  You're not getting $10 million.
[18:13.080 --> 18:14.880]  I said, have you already sent them some money?
[18:14.880 --> 18:15.880]  And I said, let me guess.
[18:15.880 --> 18:16.880]  First, it was a million.
[18:16.880 --> 18:17.880]  You sent them $5,000.
[18:17.880 --> 18:20.440]  Now you send them $20,000 and you get $10 million.
[18:20.440 --> 18:21.440]  Well, yeah.
[18:21.440 --> 18:22.440]  How do you know that?
[18:22.440 --> 18:23.920]  I said, it's a scam.
[18:23.920 --> 18:28.760]  Well, later, when the person didn't get the money, they got mad at me on air and said,
[18:28.760 --> 18:35.920]  I must have called, in this case, Prince Aboubou, actually called Aboubou.
[18:35.920 --> 18:40.320]  And I had stopped them from getting the $10 million.
[18:40.320 --> 18:45.920]  If you understand that mental illness, you understand everything.
[18:45.920 --> 18:53.320]  If you understand that level of derangement, people don't want to admit, hey, Obamacare
[18:53.320 --> 18:54.320]  was supposed to be free.
[18:54.320 --> 18:55.800]  It's doubled, drippled prices.
[18:55.800 --> 18:57.240]  Hey, there are death panels.
[18:57.240 --> 19:00.040]  You don't want to admit black unemployment's doubled under Obama.
[19:00.040 --> 19:05.080]  You don't want to admit that he's run by foreign banks and is about as liberal as Adolf
[19:05.080 --> 19:06.080]  Hitler.
[19:06.080 --> 19:09.280]  I'm not talking to our general audience, but to new listeners.
[19:09.280 --> 19:11.040]  I mean, you are conned.
[19:11.040 --> 19:13.120]  There is no debating.
[19:13.120 --> 19:16.360]  There's no way you can argue that we're wrong.
[19:16.360 --> 19:18.480]  We have the facts.
[19:18.480 --> 19:20.120]  And then your answer is like, what are you for the Republicans?
[19:20.120 --> 19:22.600]  No, I'm not for the establishment Republicans.
[19:22.600 --> 19:24.000]  And look at how they're working with Obama.
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.880]  I mean, all of this is so clear.
[19:28.880 --> 19:32.120]  So if you don't believe me about the Nigerian scam and want to call me a conspiracy terrorist,
[19:32.120 --> 19:33.120]  that's really what it is.
[19:33.120 --> 19:38.280]  A lot of mainstream media, it hit me today, are really fiction writers for the establishment.
[19:38.280 --> 19:42.380]  They know they're con artists, they've taken over the world with fraud, and they hate those
[19:42.380 --> 19:48.960]  of us that start questioning their narratives that have been proven to be faulty, disingenuative,
[19:48.960 --> 19:51.460]  and deceptive.
[19:51.460 --> 19:53.600]  And we're just here questioning known liars.
[19:53.600 --> 19:57.640]  They call that being a modern heretic, which is a conspiracy theorist, but I'm honored to
[19:57.640 --> 19:58.640]  be called that.
[19:58.640 --> 20:00.040]  We'll be back with the rest on Benghazi.
[20:00.040 --> 20:01.720]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.

[20:14.800 --> 20:18.160]  We should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times.

[20:20.960 --> 20:26.480]  A U.S. company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.

[20:38.240 --> 20:42.480]  With a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right, you can literally freeze dry anything you

[22:09.960 --> 22:12.960]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[22:12.960 --> 22:17.640]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[23:56.680 --> 24:21.440]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[24:21.440 --> 24:32.760]  By the way, you know the new Muslim Mayor of London?
[24:32.760 --> 24:38.840]  The guy that has announced they're not going to let any images of women in bathing suits
[24:38.840 --> 24:40.840]  be on the side of buses.
[24:40.840 --> 24:41.840]  That's how it's starting.
[24:41.840 --> 24:42.840]  He's just ordering.
[24:42.840 --> 24:46.600]  You can't have any images of women in bikinis or bathing suits or short dresses in any
[24:46.600 --> 24:52.880]  city-owned buses or advertising space, and he said that they need to not be, quote, Uncle
[24:52.880 --> 24:57.680]  Tom's about Islam.
[24:57.680 --> 25:06.880]  He has come out and he has said that in the evening standard, quote, take back control.
[25:06.880 --> 25:15.000]  He pronounced his name, Sadiq Khan calls for more powers for London to protect capital
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.800]  after a rigged vote, and you read it.
[25:17.800 --> 25:19.960]  What it is is called communalization.
[25:19.960 --> 25:24.200]  Arnold Schwarzenegger six years ago, when the global carbon treaty failed because it
[25:24.200 --> 25:27.800]  got leaked that it was a total fraud, and they were hiding the decline in temperature.
[25:27.800 --> 25:28.800]  Remember all that?
[25:28.800 --> 25:32.960]  Arnold took over the UN program for communalization.
[25:32.960 --> 25:43.640]  You know of it as strong cities when it comes to the UN police and border takeover system,
[25:43.640 --> 25:48.240]  but in this case with communalization, they just go in and whine and dine the mayors and
[25:48.240 --> 25:53.040]  the leaders of cities and get them to sign on and basically pay them off to agree to
[25:53.040 --> 26:01.440]  city-wide carbon taxes, regulations, zoning, and agenda 21, and that is basically what
[26:01.440 --> 26:04.880]  this mayor is saying in a lengthy article.
[26:04.880 --> 26:10.280]  He's come out and said we must take control of our own destiny, override what the rest
[26:10.280 --> 26:15.360]  of the country and the federal government's doing, and we will just tell everybody that
[26:15.360 --> 26:18.400]  Syria legally or whatever you want, stay here.
[26:18.400 --> 26:22.760]  That's why almost unanimously Muslims voted to stay in the Euro because it's working
[26:22.760 --> 26:25.280]  with them to conquer the continent.
[26:25.280 --> 26:28.240]  You cannot make the magnitude of this up.
[26:28.240 --> 26:33.160]  The mayor, Khan, today called for London to take back control of its own destiny, the
[26:33.160 --> 26:37.720]  aftermath of e-referendum, the mayor issued a demand for more tax-raising powers.
[26:37.720 --> 26:44.360]  Oh, yeah, how great, right now, right now, more taxes, right now, yeah, 75% taxes in
[26:44.360 --> 26:48.840]  London on average aren't enough, as well as far-reaching command of public services.
[26:48.840 --> 26:57.560]  Absolutely, give us control now, my power.
[26:57.560 --> 27:01.440]  His de-evolution wish list stopped short of calling for London, the only English region
[27:01.440 --> 27:06.440]  to vote, stay within the EU, as a city-state, but he stressed the extra powers that would
[27:06.440 --> 27:11.120]  be necessary to protect the capital's economy, jobs and prosperity from the uncertainty of
[27:11.120 --> 27:12.120]  the Briggs ahead.
[27:12.120 --> 27:18.560]  Yeah, the city of Austin is a immunized city, and it is basically under UN regulations.
[27:18.560 --> 27:20.160]  And we just covered this yesterday.
[27:20.160 --> 27:25.040]  ABC News goes, oh, yeah, the United Nations is telling us to prepare for more refugees
[27:25.040 --> 27:30.080]  from Latin America, and then you read deeper, the UN runs, and we have the board patrol
[27:30.080 --> 27:36.400]  saying on tape, yes, the UN sues us, the UN is down here monitoring us, the UN is basically
[27:36.400 --> 27:40.640]  telling Obama what to do, and then Obama comes out and says, I'm not going to enforce, in
[27:40.640 --> 27:45.680]  fact, I'm going to load illegals with diseases on buses and ship them into the U.S., even
[27:45.680 --> 27:50.880]  at the Supreme Court rules, you can't do it, and Jacari Jackson and Salazar and Michael
[27:50.880 --> 27:54.560]  Zimmerman have just done over-the-top great jobs.
[27:54.560 --> 27:59.920]  They have interviews with board patrol, who, by the way, have a lot of courage.
[27:59.920 --> 28:03.240]  Board patrol has said before Congress, if they speak to the media about what they've
[28:03.240 --> 28:08.840]  been ordered to do, they are reprimanded, fired, or even arrested.
[28:08.840 --> 28:13.760]  They are indicting board patrol agents, claiming they violate national security when they expose
[28:13.760 --> 28:17.760]  they've been ordered to stand down and violate law, but I guess the board patrol now has
[28:17.760 --> 28:22.440]  the Supreme Court behind them and have just gone too far.
[28:22.440 --> 28:26.520]  Now I want to be clear, I'm not dehumanizing the poor people trying to get here from their
[28:26.520 --> 28:28.400]  collapsing hell holes.
[28:28.400 --> 28:33.960]  The globalists are bringing them here, unvetted, to collapse us, that's the plan.
[28:33.960 --> 28:38.120]  So I'm not against taking people to lifeboat, but the lifeboat's going to sink.
[28:38.120 --> 28:41.920]  We have to vet people, we have to test them for diseases, every other country in the world
[28:41.920 --> 28:42.920]  does that.
[28:42.920 --> 28:46.920]  Mexico tortures you if you're caught there illegally, but they're allowed to come up,
[28:46.920 --> 28:53.280]  get on trains, stay on one major conduit out of Guatemala, this is on record, and to come
[28:53.280 --> 28:57.960]  up to Texas, Arizona, and California, that's it.
[28:57.960 --> 29:03.840]  If they get off and they don't comply, they are put in forced labor or they are tortured
[29:03.840 --> 29:06.920]  or they're a woman, they are almost universally raped.
[29:06.920 --> 29:13.360]  There's an Amazon international report out today basically saying that the majority of
[29:13.360 --> 29:25.240]  Mexican police and military are raping women, and all I'm saying is, why isn't we only
[29:25.240 --> 29:29.280]  hearing that America is evil and bad when by so many metrics, we're a really good country
[29:29.280 --> 29:32.320]  of good people, no matter what color we are.
[29:32.320 --> 29:36.400]  Why is it all day we don't give enough, we don't pay enough, we don't put up with enough
[29:36.400 --> 29:41.640]  when we are the most, but then it's also now hard to become a legal citizen because they
[29:41.640 --> 29:42.640]  don't want you doing that.
[29:42.640 --> 29:46.680]  They want to make it illegal because the Democrats can then manage that illegal group and protect
[29:46.680 --> 29:49.600]  them, but make them their slaves, and that's what this is.
[29:49.600 --> 29:53.320]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:53.320 --> 29:56.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:56.320 --> 30:02.600]  Tis the season for the Thought Police.
[30:02.600 --> 30:07.680]  Headline from the Daily Caller, the University of North Carolina, Christmas Vacation is a
[30:07.680 --> 30:09.200]  microaggression now.
[30:09.200 --> 30:14.280]  At the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, the taxpayer-funded guide entitled
[30:14.280 --> 30:20.760]  Career Corner, Understanding Microaggressions, identifies golf outings and the words boyfriend
[30:20.760 --> 30:23.840]  and girlfriend as microaggressions.
[30:23.840 --> 30:29.360]  Simply saying to a woman, I love your shoes, is a microaggression because it insists that
[30:29.360 --> 30:35.160]  the shoe admirer values appearances more than intellectual contributions.
[30:35.160 --> 30:40.240]  Asking anyone where are you from is now a microaggression since it implies that you're
[30:40.240 --> 30:43.440]  not American and you do not belong in the community.
[30:43.440 --> 30:49.800]  Even scheduling your vacation around religious observations such as Christmas diminishes non-Christian
[30:49.800 --> 30:52.640]  spiritual rituals and observances.
[30:52.640 --> 30:54.840]  This has been Ashley Beckford reporting.
[30:54.840 --> 30:58.600]  You can find more special reports at infowars.com.
[30:58.600 --> 31:01.920]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[31:01.920 --> 31:03.320]  It took you over a year to do it.
[31:03.320 --> 31:05.040]  Why is this so good?
[31:05.040 --> 31:09.720]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[31:09.720 --> 31:14.360]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[31:14.360 --> 31:15.360]  my system.
[31:15.360 --> 31:21.360]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[31:21.360 --> 31:23.400]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[31:23.400 --> 31:28.480]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[31:28.480 --> 31:29.760]  going on everywhere.
[31:29.760 --> 31:30.760]  These are all parasites.
[31:30.760 --> 31:33.480]  Tell us about all the stuff that said there's so many things that are in it.
[31:33.480 --> 31:34.720]  You have the neem in there.
[31:34.720 --> 31:37.800]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[31:37.800 --> 31:41.080]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[31:41.080 --> 31:42.080]  All right.
[31:42.080 --> 31:44.280]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[31:44.280 --> 31:48.160]  We just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose.

[32:29.920 --> 32:33.400]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[32:33.400 --> 32:38.640]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[32:38.640 --> 32:41.800]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[33:13.560 --> 33:25.440]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:25.440 --> 33:30.560]  When you live under a tyranny, the government believes its authority is absolute.
[33:30.560 --> 33:35.640]  There are many different political combines that want total control, want dictatorial control
[33:35.640 --> 33:41.280]  because they're in a battle with other elites for total global domination.
[33:41.280 --> 33:47.680]  Well, the little people, we don't even register in their analysis.
[33:47.680 --> 33:52.040]  That's why we have to not comply with corruption, not comply with arrogance, not comply with
[33:52.040 --> 33:59.680]  tyranny, and not make it easy for these oppressive historical systems to be established.
[33:59.680 --> 34:04.160]  Because once they're established, they only go downhill and they begin to eat themselves.
[34:04.160 --> 34:08.680]  And folks go, well good, they'll fall, but when they fall, it kills tens of millions
[34:08.680 --> 34:11.480]  of people in ancient times.
[34:11.480 --> 34:17.680]  In World War I and World War II, 30, 40, 50 million people died per event.
[34:17.680 --> 34:21.760]  In global depressions, tens of millions die.
[34:21.760 --> 34:28.640]  Conservatively, 7 million here alone in the Great Depression from starvation.
[34:28.640 --> 34:29.640]  Look it up.
[34:29.640 --> 34:31.960]  We have a very short memory.
[34:31.960 --> 34:33.840]  We just sit there going, hey, everything's great.
[34:33.840 --> 34:37.520]  The local bar is always going to have beer, they'll always be food at the grocery store
[34:37.520 --> 34:44.120]  as the elites start retreating to their bunkers and with private security firms.
[34:44.120 --> 34:53.640]  As scores of nations every few months collapse into complete bedlam.
[34:53.640 --> 34:58.880]  From Western Europe to Eastern Europe, Southern Europe to Africa to Asia to the Middle East
[34:58.880 --> 35:04.640]  to South America to Central America to Mexico, pretty much the majority of Mexican cities
[35:04.640 --> 35:08.800]  have collapsed into lawlessness, mass graves are found everywhere.
[35:08.800 --> 35:13.240]  Students protest, 35 are killed, another 20 are killed, it's not even in our news.
[35:13.240 --> 35:19.400]  There's a few little bubbles protected zones like Cancun where the elites themselves have
[35:19.400 --> 35:25.520]  agreed not to kill each other, that their crime rates are tenable.
[35:25.520 --> 35:29.120]  And that's the same model we're now going under here.
[35:29.120 --> 35:35.440]  I want to get to these reports that are reporters filed that are up on infowars.com.
[35:35.440 --> 35:40.560]  I want to get into what really happened with Benghazi and the latest quote findings that
[35:40.560 --> 35:45.040]  really aren't new findings, but I think it's helpful to illustrate that we've been lied
[35:45.040 --> 35:50.480]  to but also look at the incredible arrogance of Hillary.
[35:50.480 --> 35:54.280]  Scores of times telling the public one thing, oh, it's about a YouTube video and behind
[35:54.280 --> 35:58.720]  the scenes saying we've got to cover up these optics, we don't want to blame this on Arabs.
[35:58.720 --> 36:06.040]  That's politically incorrect because they were busy creating an al-Qaeda proxy army
[36:06.040 --> 36:13.560]  to overthrow Assad next.
[36:13.560 --> 36:20.080]  And the ambassador would not give the three warehouses of missiles and high-impact weapons
[36:20.080 --> 36:26.560]  to the Turkish ambassador to be delivered to al-Qaeda, now known as ISIS, and so he had
[36:26.560 --> 36:27.560]  to die.
[36:27.560 --> 36:35.240]  And everyone was told to evacuate in the weeks while the weapons were being stockpiled, support
[36:35.240 --> 36:39.600]  was pulled more and more until there was no one there.
[36:39.600 --> 36:44.520]  And then they said the ambassador had such courage, all the security was pulled for weeks
[36:44.520 --> 36:48.840]  down to nothing.
[36:48.840 --> 36:57.120]  And then he stayed, well, he stayed because he wasn't going to go along with the transfer.
[36:57.120 --> 37:03.360]  And the Turkish ambassador left angry that morning and what started a few hours later.
[37:03.360 --> 37:08.960]  That's Benghazi, folks, that's what happened.
[37:08.960 --> 37:10.880]  They had him killed.
[37:10.880 --> 37:17.440]  I told you that the week of Benghazi and that's the little piece, of course there was a stand-down.
[37:17.440 --> 37:18.800]  That's all come out.
[37:18.800 --> 37:25.040]  We told you that four years ago because we have the sources that were there, we have
[37:25.040 --> 37:40.880]  the sources that were watching at CENTCOM and AFRICOM, watching with their own eyeballs
[37:40.880 --> 37:46.320]  what was happening on those feeds and Southcom could see it and Northcom could see it and
[37:46.320 --> 37:51.720]  everybody could see the drones for 13 hours circling, eight hours of firefights.
[37:51.720 --> 37:55.840]  And then we sit here and have all these commissions and reports to figure out Hillary Clinton's
[37:55.840 --> 37:56.840]  lying.
[37:56.840 --> 38:06.200]  And they're calling in Politico, final Benghazi report details administration failures.
[38:06.200 --> 38:15.360]  They talk about that evil demonic chipmunk meets the Joker, Hillary, that man in drag.
[38:15.360 --> 38:18.360]  They talk about how she screwed up.
[38:18.360 --> 38:20.720]  She meant to go to Libya and make it a failed state.
[38:20.720 --> 38:24.680]  She meant to go to Libya and destabilize it and bring in Al Qaeda.
[38:24.680 --> 38:26.760]  She meant to do that all over the Middle East.
[38:26.760 --> 38:29.160]  That's the deal they made with Saudi Arabia.
[38:29.160 --> 38:30.320]  That's the program.
[38:30.320 --> 38:31.520]  That's the operation.
[38:31.520 --> 38:33.600]  That's what they're doing.
[38:33.600 --> 38:35.280]  Everyone, oh, Hillary's so inept.
[38:35.280 --> 38:38.000]  Oh, Hillary's so bad.
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  She's such an idiot.
[38:39.000 --> 38:40.000]  No.
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.440]  Hillary thinks you're a moron.
[38:41.440 --> 38:45.840]  And I watched all these male congressmen up there making really good points off the commission
[38:45.840 --> 38:49.520]  and then there was this female congresswoman and again, I'm at the right under name, but
[38:49.520 --> 38:57.240]  she was off the stage and was this Republican going, and it's horrible that we stood down.
[38:57.240 --> 38:58.240]  What would have happened?
[38:58.240 --> 39:03.040]  It could have been much worse if Gaddafi's militia would have attacked.
[39:03.040 --> 39:08.840]  I was kind of halfway watching while I was lifting weights and I went, what?
[39:08.840 --> 39:15.640]  And that's why we're in trouble because I've seen polls where 37% of Americans think Gaddafi
[39:15.640 --> 39:19.800]  ran al-Qaeda, Gaddafi was fighting al-Qaeda.
[39:19.800 --> 39:25.520]  Gaddafi, eight years before, made a deal with the West to invest all the country's money
[39:25.520 --> 39:31.400]  with like BP and Halliburton and for a return for their population and infrastructure he
[39:31.400 --> 39:33.080]  brought in all the Western hotels.
[39:33.080 --> 39:40.400]  He said, I'm sorry, I'll pay reparations for fighting you for 30% years.
[39:40.400 --> 39:43.520]  And they set him up, folks, to put al-Qaeda in charge.
[39:43.520 --> 39:47.480]  You're like, well, he deserves that, really, the people of Libya deserve to have al-Qaeda
[39:47.480 --> 39:48.480]  killing him.
[39:48.480 --> 39:51.360]  We talk about Obama loving Africans.
[39:51.360 --> 39:55.080]  Al-Qaeda is one of the most racist organizations out there going back to Arabs running the
[39:55.080 --> 39:56.080]  slave trade.
[39:56.080 --> 40:01.520]  Look it up, they killed Muslim blacks, everyone they could find.
[40:01.520 --> 40:09.440]  Look it up, look up, al-Qaeda or rebels in Libya killing blacks because they're like,
[40:09.440 --> 40:11.600]  hey, this is our North Africa.
[40:11.600 --> 40:14.960]  That doesn't belong to black people, nowhere belongs to you, go to the moon, we're going
[40:14.960 --> 40:15.960]  to kill you.
[40:15.960 --> 40:21.000]  And they also know that black Libyans tended to be loyal to Muammar Gaddafi who, I don't
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.880]  adore socialism, but if you're going to have it, it could be under Gaddafi because the
[40:23.880 --> 40:28.000]  guy lived in a tent and his palace was like an eight-foot wall of a swimming pool like
[40:28.000 --> 40:35.320]  a blue collar house and he distributed 99% of the oil money to build infrastructure and
[40:35.320 --> 40:37.880]  just with lotteries to the public.
[40:37.880 --> 40:44.120]  Just here, here's money, boom, 65% of college graduates were women.
[40:44.120 --> 40:50.840]  He was sending money all over Africa to build wells and aquifers and power stations.
[40:50.840 --> 40:53.400]  They killed him better than hammer folks.
[40:53.400 --> 40:59.560]  Now this world that daily Obama-backed rebels killing Libyan blacks, and that's why Lois
[40:59.560 --> 41:06.880]  Farrakhan who knew Muammar Gaddafi finally came out against Obama and said basically,
[41:06.880 --> 41:11.560]  you know, to hell with Obama because he killed Gaddafi and that's absolutely true.
[41:11.560 --> 41:17.920]  I mean for all Gaddafi's problems, he was an honorable, brave, good person compared
[41:17.920 --> 41:27.960]  to Barack Obama and a truly anti-racist and that's what our elite did to them and it's
[41:27.960 --> 41:30.200]  the same thing with Assad up there.
[41:30.200 --> 41:34.040]  Everybody living in peace, women going to college, industrializing the nation, opening
[41:34.040 --> 41:38.200]  up to the West, bringing in Western money going, okay, I'll start transferring out of
[41:38.200 --> 41:42.840]  power, we'll have elections and they double cross them and bring in al-Qaeda to just wreck
[41:42.840 --> 41:43.840]  the whole place.
[41:43.840 --> 41:47.320]  I mean let me tell you something, Syria before the Civil War five years ago that the West
[41:47.320 --> 41:50.600]  started was an incredible place to live or visit.
[41:50.600 --> 41:53.480]  I've talked to folks here, Europeans loved it.
[41:53.480 --> 41:57.360]  I mean they say the most beautiful coral reefs, the most beautiful markets, the most
[41:57.360 --> 42:03.800]  nicest people, well the globalists don't like non-radical foaming at the mouth Muslims
[42:03.800 --> 42:14.280]  because the truth is up until about what, 600 years ago or so or less, Syria was Christian,
[42:14.280 --> 42:17.800]  one of the oldest Christian communities in the world and the truth is most of the Arabs
[42:17.800 --> 42:23.880]  there, most of the Muslims there, even people that had come in later as Arabs, they were
[42:23.880 --> 42:30.760]  secretly practicing Christians and had been crypto-Christians as it's called forever
[42:30.760 --> 42:35.560]  and that's why Saudi Arabia continues to invade them.
[42:35.560 --> 42:42.920]  They've invaded them three times in the last century, Saudi Arabia has and they just start
[42:42.920 --> 42:49.040]  killing everybody and bringing in their new settlers because they know full well that
[42:49.040 --> 42:52.840]  that's why Assad goes to the Christian masses, that's why he goes and Easter and Christmas
[42:52.840 --> 42:57.280]  to the churches because then we give you a little news flash, they're Christians folks,
[42:57.280 --> 43:04.880]  they're Christians, they're Christians and they've kept it under occupation off and on
[43:04.880 --> 43:10.840]  for hundreds of years under the table, just like the Russian church was never completely
[43:10.840 --> 43:11.840]  extinguished.
[43:11.840 --> 43:15.160]  I'm going to stop right there because I need to get into Jakari's reports, they're very
[43:15.160 --> 43:21.880]  powerful and more, they're up on infowars.com and full, briefly talking about taking action
[43:21.880 --> 43:28.960]  but on Salazar wrote an article last week, top trending question on Google for a week,
[43:28.960 --> 43:33.720]  is Hillary Clinton going to jail?
[43:33.720 --> 43:36.880]  And then we go through the fact that on CNN and everywhere else, Fox, people are standing
[43:36.880 --> 43:45.560]  up with Hillary for prison shirts, it has had a really, really, really massive effect
[43:45.560 --> 43:51.360]  so I want to commend everybody, in fact we found another article that's similar to it,
[43:51.360 --> 43:55.840]  this is from Breitbart, we can actually put our info wars version of that up, top trending
[43:55.840 --> 43:58.200]  question on Google, is Hillary Clinton going to jail?
[43:58.200 --> 44:01.720]  I want to put the infowars.com version of that because it's a larger article and actually
[44:01.720 --> 44:07.360]  shows screenshots for TV viewers and videos, people all over national TV, getting in the
[44:07.360 --> 44:12.120]  shot with the Hillary for prison shirt, folks hacking highway signs all over the country,
[44:12.120 --> 44:15.800]  not just in Texas now, putting Hillary for prison up on them, I don't really condone
[44:15.800 --> 44:18.920]  that but I mean whatever she is, a dictator, would be a dictator.
[44:18.920 --> 44:23.280]  By the way, former secret service agents come out and said she's a dictator, yeah there's
[44:23.280 --> 44:27.320]  our version, let's scroll down and then you can see screenshots of it, you can see the
[44:27.320 --> 44:31.720]  trend over the last few years, how it's now, one of the top trends and then you can scroll
[44:31.720 --> 44:35.640]  down and see how Donald Trump's now picking it up and then below that we have the highway
[44:35.640 --> 44:40.720]  signs getting taken over, people on CNN, all of that, it's very, very powerful.
[44:40.720 --> 44:55.400]  That second generation shirt sold out, version 3 arrived today, this morning on an 18 wheeler.
[44:55.400 --> 44:58.880]  And ladies and gentlemen, I believe it's the best version yet, it's just a good clean Hillary
[44:58.880 --> 45:02.840]  for prison 2016, looks like the election shirt, like the last two versions, but on the right
[45:02.840 --> 45:09.320]  hand shoulder it says infowars.com, very handsomely in red and on the back it says Hillary for
[45:09.320 --> 45:19.360]  prison, on the back it says legalizefreedom, infowars.com, so I think it's the most handsome
[45:19.360 --> 45:23.800]  shirt we ever put out and it absolutely rattles them, shakes them up, you'll meet light-minded
[45:23.800 --> 45:29.720]  people and again it just sold out a day ago, we have the new version in, if you want it,
[45:29.720 --> 45:39.280]  infowarstore.com or call toll 3-888-2533-139, 888-2533-139, this is about solidarity,
[45:39.280 --> 45:44.400]  it's about meeting light-minded people, it's about really seeing the power of the infowar.
[45:44.400 --> 45:47.720]  By the way, I love the fact that there are literally hundreds of sites now selling their
[45:47.720 --> 45:53.840]  own versions, copies of ours, variants, I don't care, great, wonderful, buy it somewhere
[45:53.840 --> 46:04.120]  else, just whatever you do, whatever you do, ladies and gentlemen, get an infowar shirt,
[46:04.120 --> 46:12.680]  get a moan, go out in public, practice the first amendment or lose it, separately deep
[46:12.680 --> 46:23.600]  cleanse that is just a whole spectrum of compounds that are known to absolutely pull toxins out
[46:23.600 --> 46:24.600]  of the body.
[46:24.600 --> 46:35.200]  I'm going to read about the science, see the informational videos and more at infowarslife.com
[46:35.200 --> 46:45.320]  where we have our nutraceuticals, but this has it all and it just goes in with the zeolites,
[46:45.320 --> 46:50.960]  with the shilligy, the shilligy is basically herb oil from hundreds of thousands of years,
[46:50.960 --> 46:57.760]  they say millions, from Russia, from the Himalayas, we have both sources, totally organic, that
[46:57.760 --> 47:03.520]  just comes out of the rocks in the summer, it is so ancient, it's just thousands of
[47:03.520 --> 47:08.040]  different species of plants, they're ancient oils and this is what was discovered back
[47:08.040 --> 47:11.720]  in the 50s, they thought the Russians were on steroids during the Olympics, they kept
[47:11.720 --> 47:16.160]  testing them and couldn't find it and then turned out it was shilligy and the shilligy
[47:16.160 --> 47:21.400]  alone is just, no one knows why it's so amazing, this is true Russian or depending on which
[47:21.400 --> 47:27.040]  batch it is, we have to go to both places Himalayan, same thing as Himalayas, shilligy,
[47:27.040 --> 47:30.640]  it's in deep cleanse, it's one of the key ingredients in there and it's amazing, that's

[48:00.880 --> 48:09.880]  Now continuing here, let me get to this news, these videos and articles are up on infowars.com,
[48:09.880 --> 48:16.560]  they really are a huge deal because we know Obama has been shipping people in from all
[48:16.560 --> 48:20.320]  of the world and advertising to come here for many years and ordering the board patrol
[48:20.320 --> 48:24.520]  to stand down, it started with them ordering the board patrol not to pursue people or to
[48:24.520 --> 48:29.600]  go and pick up trash instead of grabbing illegals or drug smugglers and now it's just moved
[48:29.600 --> 48:34.440]  to confirm the last three years that we broke as the board patrol contacted us and I'm not
[48:34.440 --> 48:40.200]  bragging about that, it's very sad that we broke it, that in places like McAllen, Texas
[48:40.200 --> 48:44.400]  they order them to stand down, load them on buses and then the feds are ordered to give
[48:44.400 --> 48:49.360]  them money, vouchers to go anywhere they want in the country, they're not checked for diseases
[48:49.360 --> 48:57.600]  none of it and I was thinking about this morning, I was in the shower, I was just thinking
[48:57.600 --> 49:01.120]  how do I come up with words, I'm gonna skip this network break, how do I come up with
[49:01.120 --> 49:11.720]  words, strong enough to describe the over the topness of this, I fly in from Isla Mejara's
[49:11.720 --> 49:22.040]  via Cancun, from fishing with my family and snorkeling Saturday and they give me not the
[49:22.040 --> 49:28.880]  third degree but we all get interrogated and I'm looking at the guy and he sees on the
[49:28.880 --> 49:34.360]  screen, I have no criminal record and I go, I'm just looking at him like, okay, yeah,
[49:34.360 --> 49:41.080]  but see I'm a milk cow, I'm a slave, I've got to be kept in line, they want to attract
[49:41.080 --> 49:47.600]  new slaves to the fly paper, the slaves come in, the slaves don't go out and so it's like
[49:47.600 --> 49:53.880]  everything's free, come here, it's wonderful, hum de la dee, an actor's life for me, you
[49:53.880 --> 49:58.520]  know, I can Pinocchio, come on the slave ship, it's fun, haha, yeah you're gonna be a jackass
[49:58.520 --> 49:59.520]  too.
[49:59.520 --> 50:04.000]  Here, take a Gardasil shot, you'll never have a child again, sweetheart, none of this shot
[50:04.000 --> 50:10.280]  works properly, enjoy all the uterine problems and ovary meltdowns you're gonna have, and
[50:10.280 --> 50:20.200]  you very insist, we love you, LaRosa's not gonna warn you, it works for somebody special,
[50:20.200 --> 50:24.320]  who's running the operation down there right now to make sure you end up in the mass grave,
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.600]  oh I'm sorry, the government loves us, I'm sorry, that is people running our government
[50:28.600 --> 50:34.400]  do not love us, our low-level government's very good, and so I was sitting there trying
[50:34.400 --> 50:42.680]  to come up with words this morning to 22% of the people that the government's vetting
[50:42.680 --> 50:48.840]  and bringing in to Minnesota alone, Associated Press, have TB and most of it's drug-resistant
[50:48.840 --> 50:56.440]  or drug-immune and it's killing people, and it was on the news today that they are in
[50:56.440 --> 50:59.520]  all these states complaining that people are getting sick because they're sticking these
[50:59.520 --> 51:06.160]  kids in elementary, middle school, and high school, I mean think about a federal government,
[51:06.160 --> 51:10.360]  it'd be one thing if they grabbed folks, tested them, held them in some center, and then just
[51:10.360 --> 51:15.760]  let them go, that'd be illegal and the Supreme Court's ruled it's illegal, but it'd still
[51:15.760 --> 51:21.200]  be kind of okay, whatever, they don't even allow the Board of Patrol to hold them or
[51:21.200 --> 51:25.920]  check them, they just give them a voucher, in some cases worth a thousand dollars for
[51:25.920 --> 51:33.120]  food at Greyhound facilities and Greyhound buses, that's just one of the vouchers they
[51:33.120 --> 51:39.040]  give, and in some cases it's private bus lines, they have contractors in big beautiful buses,
[51:39.040 --> 51:43.520]  nicer than the bus I get when I go around with my crew, I mean these are like million
[51:43.520 --> 51:48.000]  and a half dollar buses, I'm driving around on a $150,000 bus, I'm not complaining, but
[51:48.000 --> 51:57.520]  I mean it's just like wow, I mean just Rolls Royce level quality, and they're coming in
[51:57.520 --> 52:01.440]  and they look completely happy and like wow thank you, you're so nice to me, I mean I
[52:01.440 --> 52:06.680]  don't dislike these people, these desperate people, I have humanity, but my humanity's
[52:06.680 --> 52:12.320]  being manipulated, if you had humanity for these women and these children and these
[52:12.320 --> 52:19.440]  men, you would test them for the hundreds of parasites, for the drug resistant TB, and
[52:19.440 --> 52:28.080]  for all the other stuff, the whooping cough, the polio, that's bad in Latin America folks,
[52:28.080 --> 52:35.360]  that's really bad down there, and suddenly you can type into the news, CDC admits diseases
[52:35.360 --> 52:42.320]  once that didn't exist in the United States are now back, like polio, and their answer
[52:42.320 --> 52:50.240]  is take the polio vaccine, which no one had to take anymore because it was gone, supposedly,
[52:50.240 --> 52:55.480]  and then the polio vaccine's dangerous, I mean I'm just going man these people are really
[52:55.480 --> 53:04.360]  out to get us, I mean the globalists run America, Obama's the boss, it's his house, supposedly,
[53:04.360 --> 53:08.680]  but the elites that run this country want to bring it down, they really want to destroy
[53:08.680 --> 53:16.240]  it, and I've always known that's their aim, my first film was America Destroyed by Design,
[53:16.240 --> 53:27.360]  1997, 18 years ago, 1997, almost 19 years ago, shot some of it in 1996, but the point
[53:27.360 --> 53:34.000]  is it's 17 to 18 years old, and I say there's a plan to destroy our republic and free market
[53:34.000 --> 53:39.720]  by design, here's their plan to bankrupt us, third world populations cutting off our resources,
[53:39.720 --> 53:43.680]  cutting off our factories, cutting off our coal, and people go yeah I see this film on
[53:43.680 --> 53:48.880]  YouTube, they go how did this guy, how did this young Alex Jones at you know 24 years
[53:48.880 --> 53:54.360]  old know all this, I didn't know it, the UN and the globalists write the white papers
[53:54.360 --> 54:03.600]  that UNESCO puts out as policy versus their PR, but they got a battle plan, it'd be like
[54:03.600 --> 54:07.680]  if you know some guy was planning to rob a bank and he had a plan to do it and it fell
[54:07.680 --> 54:13.920]  out of his pocket and I found it, and then I brought it to the police and they said
[54:13.920 --> 54:17.600]  okay we have the date they're gonna rob it, we're gonna stake it out and then sure enough
[54:17.600 --> 54:24.040]  he pulls up with his people in a van to rob it, I mean we have the battle plan, we have
[54:24.040 --> 54:28.720]  the codes, it's like no one of the Japanese are gonna attack a year before in doing nothing,
[54:28.720 --> 54:35.200]  you know in World War II or whatever, they just do it a week before they did nothing,
[54:35.200 --> 54:44.440]  I mean this isn't my opinion, but still I get why the population couldn't believe it,
[54:44.440 --> 54:48.920]  that you mean they ship them in and give them money, well yeah then they advertise come
[54:48.920 --> 54:52.120]  here, that's why the numbers are getting so big, just like they advertise in Europe,
[54:52.120 --> 54:57.240]  come here Arab Spring, come here there are, the EU allowed ads to be put out saying we
[54:57.240 --> 55:10.280]  have blonde women for you and free money, this is the plan folks, and it's so crazy
[55:10.280 --> 55:15.200]  and in Europe they don't test for disease, so let's go to this first Yukari Jackson
[55:15.200 --> 55:21.200]  report but just think about this, the Board of Patrol is now talking to our reporters
[55:21.200 --> 55:27.760]  and they've been on congressional reviews or they get indicted, they get fired, they
[55:27.760 --> 55:32.360]  get reprimanded, it runs the gamut for speaking out, why did the Board of Patrol talk to us,
[55:32.360 --> 55:39.080]  they usually blur their faces out, you know we usually do it, sitting there at their headquarters
[55:39.080 --> 55:43.920]  or in their truck talking to them off record and scrambling their voice and they trust
[55:43.920 --> 55:51.200]  us, they know that we come, edit it, scramble their voice and destroy the files.
[55:51.200 --> 55:54.400]  Now the Board of Patrol is just like yeah we'll talk to you, sure yes, we're ordered
[55:54.400 --> 55:58.880]  to ship people in with diseases, I'm going to play just a short clip of this and come
[55:58.880 --> 56:02.720]  back with all of it but now this is Board of Patrol agent, vast majority are released
[56:02.720 --> 56:06.800]  in the country, disease or no disease and the real headline is, Board of Patrol ordered
[56:06.800 --> 56:10.640]  by Obama to let people in that had diseases, here it is.
[56:10.640 --> 56:14.520]  Chikara Jackson here in McAllen, Texas we ran into Chris Cabrera, he is the vice president
[56:14.520 --> 56:18.360]  of the local Board of Patrol Union, now Chris recently we saw the Supreme Court that struck
[56:18.360 --> 56:22.920]  down Obama's immigration policy, do you think that's going to affect what you guys see out
[56:22.920 --> 56:23.920]  here on the border?
[56:23.920 --> 56:29.160]  Yeah you know I actually do, just by the initial ruling it affected people coming out here,
[56:29.160 --> 56:33.040]  more people thought that they had to be here by a certain date, nobody really knew what
[56:33.040 --> 56:38.000]  that date was, it was more of a phantom date and now that it got struck down, people don't
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.200]  know what's going to happen if Donald Trump wins, if Hillary wins or whoever takes office
[56:42.200 --> 56:47.840]  so more people are starting to come and surge in even more so just because they need to
[56:47.840 --> 56:50.160]  beat some phantom deadline.
[56:50.160 --> 56:54.600]  And speaking of Trump, does the Board of Patrol have any particular view of the wall for it
[56:54.600 --> 56:56.000]  against it and different?
[56:56.000 --> 57:01.520]  You know the wall as far as the Board of Patrol aspect is it's tool, it's something you can
[57:01.520 --> 57:07.160]  use granted it's not a be all end all stop gap measure but it is something that can slow
[57:07.160 --> 57:11.000]  people down or funnel them into a certain direction, however if you just have a wall
[57:11.000 --> 57:17.480]  with no manpower on that wall, no electronic surveillance, no helicopters, nothing then
[57:17.480 --> 57:22.720]  it's just, it's pointless, when we first put that wall up we had an 18 foot wall, we started
[57:22.720 --> 57:26.440]  getting 19 foot ladders on a daily basis, we had so many they had to tell us to stop
[57:26.440 --> 57:28.680]  bringing them into the station and destroy them in place.
[57:28.680 --> 57:30.880]  Oh wow that's really interesting.
[57:30.880 --> 57:34.320]  Now as far as the Board of Patrol is today, do you feel that the Board of Patrol as a
[57:34.320 --> 57:38.840]  whole has adequate resources to combat what you guys see out there on a daily basis?
[57:38.840 --> 57:43.440]  No I don't, I mean it's one thing that we don't have enough people and enough resources
[57:43.440 --> 57:47.920]  and then you have the layers upon layers of bureaucratic red tape that makes getting
[57:47.920 --> 57:51.840]  anything done in a timely manner almost impossible.
[57:51.840 --> 57:57.320]  And as far as crime on the Board, do you think that the, pretty much the way it is now is
[57:57.320 --> 58:02.280]  it allowing people who are criminals or people from terrorist organizations to enter the
[58:02.280 --> 58:04.560]  country more easily?
[58:04.560 --> 58:09.000]  Well you know one in five people that we catch has some type of criminal history here in
[58:09.000 --> 58:13.880]  the United States, on top of that we only catch 40% of what's coming across as actual
[58:13.880 --> 58:20.120]  in this area, so that's 20% of what we catch are known bad guys, you can only imagine what
[58:20.120 --> 58:23.960]  the other 60% of people that are coming across who they are or what their plans are, we have
[58:23.960 --> 58:24.960]  no idea.
[58:24.960 --> 58:25.960]  Alright, pause.
[58:25.960 --> 58:29.480]  I want this a little bit late, we come back to Bombshell where he talks about, we don't
[58:29.480 --> 58:32.920]  test him for diseases, we're told just release him into the US.
[58:32.920 --> 58:38.680]  That is the Bombshell, it's coming up, second hour is 70 seconds away, infowars.com.

[59:44.440 --> 59:52.640]  at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives, check it out for yourself today.
[59:52.640 --> 01:00:02.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:09.320]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:18.760]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:23.600]  So we're told we're a nation of laws and citizens have to get interrogated and have to have
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:27.800]  all these papers that even fly around inside the country.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.080]  But when you get across the border illegally, you're not sent to a refugee center, you're
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:36.320]  not tested, none of that happens, you're just giving money and vouchers and sent deeper
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.320]  into the country.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:43.400]  And our reporters broke that two years ago and it was picked up by ABC News finally down
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:49.280]  on the border admitting yes, there's a huge wave, the UN runs it, they're coming in.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.880]  And so Jakari Jackson went down and talked to the board patrol union head and he was
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.600]  talking to the gentleman in the clip, we were just playing sort of getting into the fact
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.080]  that a good percentage of people that come in are already known criminals, they're only
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.880]  catching 40%.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:11.040]  So let's go back to the rest of that clip where the board patrol union head there in
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.800]  McAllen, Texas in that sector gets into the big issue that their order did not test people
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.240]  for diseases and just let them go into America.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.120]  Folks, if a hospital knows you have TB and they don't give you treatment or test to see
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:31.560]  if it's drug resistant, they're held liable as felons.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:35.480]  And our government takes these people in under political correctness and puts them in schools
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:40.000]  next to your kids and doesn't even do the favor of testing these kids to even get them
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  well.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.600]  That's a way down the economy, way down the culture, way down the country in bankruptcy.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.400]  This is an attempt to take the country down, just like they're doing Europe right now,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.400]  here it is.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.880]  Now as far as the board patrol is today, do you feel that the board patrol as a whole
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.520]  as adequate resources to combat what you guys see out there on a daily basis?
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:03.120]  No, I don't. I mean, it's one thing that we don't have enough people and enough resources
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.600]  and then you have the layers upon layers of bureaucratic red tape that makes getting
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.200]  anything done in a timely manner almost impossible.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.200]  Okay.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:17.480]  And as far as crime on the border, do you think that pretty much the way it is now, is it
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:21.960]  allowing people who are criminals or people from terrorist organizations to enter the
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.640]  country more easily?
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:28.480]  Well, you know, one in five people that we catch has had some type of criminal history
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.040]  here in the United States.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.360]  On top of that, we only catch 40% of what's coming across this actual in this area.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:39.040]  So that's 20% of what we catch are known bad guys.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.480]  You can only imagine what the other 60% of people that are coming across, who they are
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.120]  or what their plans are, we have no idea.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.400]  The interesting part is they're not staying here in the Rio Grande Valley.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:53.120]  A lot of these folks are using it as a waypoint to move forward, whether it's the people themselves
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.120]  or drugs.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:59.360]  It's all going through the area and it's going into larger communities like the San Antonio's,
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.760]  the Austin's, the Dallas, all the way up to Virginia, Maryland, DC, Chicago.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:04.840]  They're all headed that way.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:10.160]  So we do have an issue as far as the traffic coming through, but the crime is being spread
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.020]  out evenly across the United States.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:16.720]  And on that topic of the drugs, it's not just people coming over, but bringing drugs
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.720]  on a general, let's say a month.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.880]  What type of drugs do you encounter and what quantities?
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.520]  The most common is marijuana.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.280]  We see thousands upon thousands of pounds weekly.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.800]  We do see a lot of cocaine.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.440]  We're starting to see heroin and meth a lot more.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.600]  Usually those were reserved for the ports of entry, but now they started running those
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.960]  across the river as well.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:43.560]  And as far as the people coming over, are your agents encountering any type of infectious
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.400]  diseases, people with illnesses as they cross the border?
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.400]  Most definitely.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:52.600]  There's tuberculosis pretty regularly, scabies more often than not.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:57.600]  We have large amounts of infectious diseases as far as scabies go.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:03.440]  And the interesting part with that is it's not actually seen on the body during the infectious
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.440]  period.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.920]  And so these people clear through our system and then they go into the rest of the country
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.360]  with that disease.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:16.040]  We see a lot of measles, a lot of chickenpox, a lot of unidentified illnesses that a lot
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.840]  of lung infections that we have no idea what they are.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.520]  And again, that's just what we catch.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.520]  Right.
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:27.160]  Okay, now we've seen reports of the quarantine facilities at your Border Patrol stations,
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.760]  some reports saying that they're just a piece of yellow tape.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.960]  Since then, has the situation improved at all?
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.960]  No, not at all.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.880]  You know, we do still have the yellow tape.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.880]  Sometimes they use a red tape.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.840]  I don't know if there's any significance there.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:42.440]  We do have nurses and doctors that are on staff that are there, but as far as a quarantine
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:49.560]  facility or an actual method of treating these people and really quarantining them so it
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.360]  doesn't spread, we don't have that.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.080]  Yeah, they just released them.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.080]  The full interview is up on infowars.com.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.080]  We've got more.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.360]  Our reporters actually confront the illegals coming up.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.640]  Both GOP nominee Donald Trump and leftist investor George Soros have predicted the complete
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.800]  downfall of the European Union, despite Trump being a nationalist and Soros a globalist.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.360]  The two billionaires both independently declared that they believe a domino effect has been
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:16.080]  started by Britain's decision to leave the EU, and the process will be difficult for
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.680]  anyone to stop, as reported by Steve Watson.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:22.720]  Soros said, quote, Now the catastrophic scenario that many feared has materialized, making
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.520]  the disintegration of the EU practically irreversible.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:28.960]  Trump also predicted a complete breakup of the EU and also warned that the continent
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.920]  would be completely unrecognizable within 10 years if strict immigration controls are
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.080]  not enacted.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.400]  Trump told reporters, quote, The people have spoken.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.000]  I think the EU is going to break up.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.320]  I think the EU might break up before anyone thinks in terms of Scotland.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:45.080]  Trump is referring to the resistance Scottish politicians are still giving Brexit.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:48.960]  He continued stating that, I really think that without the immigration issue, the EU
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.840]  wouldn't have had a chance of breaking up.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.520]  The people are fed up, whether it's here or in other countries.
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.520]  You watch.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.520]  Other countries will follow.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.520]  For more news, visit infoworse.com.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.520]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:02.880]  Hey, everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.720]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:10.600]  You all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.440]  nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:19.080]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.360]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.480]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:28.200]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.120]  your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate

[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.680]  That's infoworseteam.com.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:03.760]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from infoworselife.com.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.760]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:11.240]  and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:16.640]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at infoworselife.com is loaded with a full
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:21.880]  month supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.880]  needs.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:27.120]  In the history of InfoWorse Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:30.560]  Shield X2, SuperMell Vitality, and so many others.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:35.440]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:40.240]  system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.600]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:50.000]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.760]  quality lab standard.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.200]  That means it's clean.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.200]  That means it's pure.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.280]  That's infoworselife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:01.400]  Make action now before we sell out.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:07.320]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.120]  a war on for your mind.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:15.400]  So our reporters have gotten an account in Texas where they first, two years ago, documented
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:21.000]  thanks to ICE whistleblowers, that the government ships in the illegals.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  It's a UN program.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.560]  They told us that, and that's in ABC News this week.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:33.160]  Now admitting it's a UN program, they advertise, come to the U.S., the people get here desperately
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:39.960]  from Central South America, China, the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, you name it.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.960]  They get here.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:46.560]  The board patrols order to get them, give them basic medical treatment, but don't treat
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:51.880]  any diseases like TB or ebonic plague or scabies or any of this.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:55.640]  And then just give them money, vouchers, and load them on buses.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:59.160]  That's finally on ABC News, two years after we broke it with our own video.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:04.240]  So we sent our crew back down there, and what did they catch?
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.480]  Drugs being shipped across.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.360]  That was a few months ago when they went down there.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:13.920]  Yesterday, just people pouring across anywhere they are, just randomly, giant groups of people.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.920]  It's so massive.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:22.680]  And then they talked to the board of patrol union head of that sector, Mr. Cabrera, who's
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.520]  got courage to even talk, even though he's the union head, because they persecute people
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520]  to do this.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:31.320]  And he says, listen, we don't even test them for diseases, we're ordered to let them through.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.320]  That is such a vicious act.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:39.480]  Ellis Island was about quarantine to make sure people weren't sick or got well.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:43.120]  If you care about these people coming in who are just being used as pawns, you don't just
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.120]  let them come across.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:49.280]  If you wanted to do a doctor's office and they didn't treat you for TB, you are culpable
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:50.560]  if you let them go.
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.800]  This is drug resistant.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.680]  I want to play that clip and ask Joe Salente about this first and look at other trends,
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.400]  the Brexit that he, of course, predicted and others did.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:06.160]  What that signifies, they've officially announced an EU army to block countries leaving.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.160]  That's the headline on infowars.com.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:17.400]  Brexit insider, EU army being established to block countries exiting.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:21.160]  They're saying it themselves, unelected bureaucracy.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:24.320]  In fact, here's the actual headline.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.560]  I'm pulling it up right now on infowars.com.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.560]  We might check this.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:31.560]  I saw this today and I saw it yesterday on a lot of platforms.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.920]  I think infowars is getting slow.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.320]  We need to check it.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:41.120]  Brexit insider, EU plans, occupational army to keep nations from exiting.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.400]  And they've actually put the proposal out, the super state.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.920]  I can't even believe it's getting to this point.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.720]  New York Benghazi, shipping any legals with diseases.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.160]  The Supreme Court says you can't do it.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.160]  They move ahead with it.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.800]  I mean, what are the elite really trying here?
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.440]  I mean, are they, are they this and that?
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:02.280]  No, they're working hard to do this, but here's that clip on the infectious diseases.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.280]  It's bombshell.
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:09.080]  And as far as the people coming over, are your agents encountering in type of infectious
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.560]  diseases, people with illnesses as they cross the border?
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.560]  Oh, most definitely.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:18.120]  I see tuberculosis pretty regularly, scabies more often than not.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:23.120]  We have large amounts of infectious diseases as far as scabies go.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:28.520]  And the interesting part with that is it's, it's not actually seen on the body during
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.880]  the infectious period.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:33.440]  And so these people clear through our system and then they go into the rest of the country
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.880]  with that disease.
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:41.080]  We see a lot of measles, a lot of chickenpox, a lot of unidentified illnesses that, that
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:45.360]  you know, a lot of lung infections that we have no idea what they are.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.040]  And again, that's just what we catch.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040]  Right.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.040]  Okay.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:52.720]  Now we've seen reports of the quarantine facilities at your Border Patrol stations.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.320]  Some reports saying that they're just a piece of yellow tape.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.440]  Since then has the situation improved at all?
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:58.440]  No, not at all.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.400]  You know, we do still have the yellow tape.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.400]  Sometimes they use a red tape.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.400]  I don't know if there's any significance there.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.960]  We do have nurses and doctors that are on staff that are there, but as far as a quarantine
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:15.080]  facility or an actual method of treating these people and really quarantining them so it
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.520]  doesn't spread, we don't have that.
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:21.920]  And is there any type of policy, anything in the works to help you guys better identify
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.360]  and possibly even treat what's coming over?
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.320]  Well, you know, what we do is we send them to the hospital, they get cleared and unfortunately
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.880]  we release them into the country.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:36.240]  The vast majority of people that we catch probably 80%, if not more, we release into
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.040]  the country disease or no disease.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.520]  All right, now let's stop right there.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:43.800]  Disease or no disease, 80% we release, felons, you name it.
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.360]  And when the Border Patrol takes them to a center to then have them deported, Obama
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.560]  just releases them.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:54.520]  I've studied history and I've never seen anything this insane, but it's a policy.
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.800]  Europe's doing the same thing.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.120]  And now they're putting them in schools next to kids.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.520]  That's in the news.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.320]  People say, oh, why aren't you being nice to these poor immigrants?
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.160]  The globalists have a policy to destabilize things.
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.880]  I want to ask Gerald Salente why he thinks this is happening, then get into the Brexit.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.080]  It's a short interview within the day.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:18.040]  They have a congressman coming on as well to break down a lot of this.
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:23.760]  But what is the short suite of it, Gerald Salente?
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.040]  Because clearly we know the white shoe boys from Harvard think they're God and are incompetent
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.960]  in many ways, but they're competently doing everything evil they can.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.400]  I mean, if they were just incompetent, they'd do some things right, some things wrong.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:40.120]  I mean, they seem to really have an evil genius for doing the most over-the-top horrible
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.240]  stuff to bankrupt the country.
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:46.000]  All these local cities are going bankrupt at their hospitals and facilities and having
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  to house these people.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  What is going on, Gerald?
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.880]  Well, you know, in staying with the, in listening to these interviews about the people pouring
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:01.920]  over the border, but yet they rob us of our rights every day from the Supreme Court.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:12.480]  To the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, every politician out there, all of our bill of rights, constitutional
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:21.000]  rights, rob from us in the name of protecting us from them lone wolves and them terrorists
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.040]  that are just lurking out there, ready to pounce on us as people are pouring over the
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.840]  border as you're showing and proving by the hundreds of thousands.
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:39.600]  And they can't stop them, but yet they keep coming out with this lie that their intelligence
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:46.280]  is going to prevent the next terrorist strike and how we should honor all of those people
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:51.120]  that are doing everything they can to protect us by listening to every phone conversation
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:57.360]  we have by listening to everything that we do online or offline, walking down the street,
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:04.560]  going to sleep, whatever you buy, everything they do to watch us rob us of our rights.
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:09.880]  And then you've got this fraud going on with hundreds of thousands of people, millions,
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.120]  when you add them up, flooding over the border.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:16.720]  They can't stop, don't even know who they are, and they keep coming in.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.440]  So how come that's not being brought up?
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:19.840]  So what is the method of the madness?
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.120]  I mean, what is the plan?
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.840]  Because they're following the exact same plan in Europe, too.
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.320]  I mean, this is a plan.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:30.180]  Well, the plan is, again, you know, it's when things break down, that's their excuse as
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:35.600]  you were pointing out to have that EU army to keep you in check.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:41.720]  So when things break down, then they come out again and say, we got to protect you.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.520]  We got to stop this from happening.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.680]  It'll never happen again.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:47.360]  So that's what they do.
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:52.920]  They create the violent situations, and then they cover it up by saying, we're not going
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.160]  to let this happen again.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.640]  Yeah, but you created it.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:00.280]  And because we've had the death of common sense, they never get held accountable that
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:04.320]  I mean, used to, they do something five years before and then pretend to save us five years
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.320]  later.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:12.120]  Now, they do it one month, block the FBI from actually stopping real terrorists, but then
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:15.320]  take more of our rights after the terrorist attack, who they allowed to come in.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.640]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.640]  Yeah.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:22.120]  And then again, when you look at the entire picture, when they talk about terrorism, you
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:31.000]  know, if I was born in Iraq or Yemen or Libya or Syria or Afghanistan, and a foreign country
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:38.240]  came in and bombed my whole country into ruins, killed everybody that I love.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.640]  And I'm a young kid.
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:40.640]  My parents are dead.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:45.360]  My aunts and uncles, everybody, my friends, I have no future.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.720]  They think I'd be radicalized.
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:53.520]  You think I'd want to blow the brains out of the people that blew the brains out of
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.400]  the people that I love.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:59.240]  And then they say, we got to stop this terrorism from happening.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.840]  You created it.
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.960]  And they're creating this situation.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:06.480]  Look, go back to the Great Depression.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.960]  When the Great Depression came about, they stopped immigration from coming into this
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.360]  country.
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.080]  You couldn't come into the country after World War II.
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.480]  I had relatives from Italy that couldn't come over.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.960]  They had quotas.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:25.400]  They stopped it to stabilize the nation after the Great Depression because the people here
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.880]  didn't have jobs.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.360]  We certainly weren't going to bring others in.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.080]  So this isn't about Mexicans or Muslims.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.960]  It's about common sense.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:40.560]  And the common sense is if your house is full, you can't get any more people in the doors.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.440]  You ran out of food.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.320]  You're going to bring more in.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.520]  So that is the issue.
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.480]  But going back to the whole immigration issue, by the way, and I've been writing about this
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:56.880]  since the mid-80s, was a national association of manufacturers when we had manufacturers
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:00.840]  and then later on, Silicon Valley, the con men out there.
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:04.440]  Yeah, they want to drive ledges down, even though it ultimately will destroy their own
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.440]  market.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.440]  Yeah.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.040]  They brought in all the cheap labor.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.600]  That's what they wanted.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.760]  And they got it.
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.760]  And now our whole standard of living's declined.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.400]  And that's what the Brexit vote was about.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.480]  You look at the facts, it's the data not making it up.
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:24.920]  The major issues were the migrants coming in, coming in from Romania and Poland, cheaper
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.120]  labor, putting the people out of work.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.680]  And the second thing is they didn't want to lose their nationality.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.160]  And how dare you don't want to lose your nationality?
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.560]  You should become vanilla.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.600]  EU will put you in a vanilla package.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:45.320]  And you, how dare you want to maintain your ancestral heritage?
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.240]  That's what the vote was really about.
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.680]  And the people had enough of it.
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:54.720]  Oh, and there's this other great con going on, now they want to do another vote.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.720]  What do you mean you want to do another vote?
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.120]  You lost the other one.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:03.160]  Oh, no, but we don't like losing because we have the establishment.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:08.520]  Can you imagine if that vote went the other way and they voted to remain?
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:13.680]  And the people that wanted to leave called for another vote, they would be laughing at
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:14.680]  them.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:19.840]  But as you call them and I call them, the prostitutes and media whores, no, no, because
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.920]  the establishment wanted to remain.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.040]  Even Obama went over there.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:29.080]  And if you're going to get bad in the back of the queue, if you leave, Abe went over
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:30.080]  there.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:34.880]  They're all the Jamie diamonds, the white shoe boys, all telling them to stay.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.000]  And they left.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.840]  Now they want a new vote.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:40.560]  They are actually trying to make this legitimate.
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.920]  Oh, you lost the ball.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:47.600]  And we predicted they do that because, listen, France and others voted to leave in 2005.
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.480]  And they just said, sorry, can't.
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:54.120]  So, so we've already seen the EU as people try to get out of it, become more tutorial.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:57.800]  And I just can't believe they're actually saying, we're creating a new army and it's
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.080]  going to take over your army so you can't leave.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:04.120]  I mean, this is, we haven't seen stuff like this since Hitler.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.800]  And it's got all these weird leftist groups promoting it.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.480]  What is this weird, because, you know, I'm not right when you're left-wing.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.480]  You're not either.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.480]  You're like a political atheist.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:13.480]  I'm just in the liberty.
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:19.040]  What is this new love affair that the left has with radical Islam and with the Talitarianism?
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.240]  Because I mean, we attacked Bush for what he did.
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:26.580]  But my gosh, the left worldwide seems like they have gone start raving mad.
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:27.580]  That's one question.
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:31.240]  A, then B, Joe Salente, top trends forecaster, I want to ask you this question.
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:34.320]  I know you write about it at trendsresearch.com.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:38.680]  He wrote decades ago about when the meltdown happens worldwide in the third world first,
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:42.240]  they will flood the borders and then that could completely swamp civilization.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:48.240]  Well, even a new FEMA report has come out dealing with 395 percent food spikes being
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:52.400]  a possibility starting next year and then running through the next decade.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:53.600]  So that's over a decade, folks.
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:56.320]  It's not in one year, but still ultra massive.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:02.440]  And they talk in the report about the crisis causing a global collapse from crop failure
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.440]  to system failure.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:10.120]  Well, as you wrote about five, six years ago there of spring, they manipulated the prices
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:14.920]  in North Africa, knowing that when prices go above 50 percent of your paycheck going
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.640]  to food, that causes civil unrest.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:20.520]  So they're manipulating civil unrest and posing as the saviors.
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:24.760]  So it's pretty clear they're orchestrating global meltdown to get more control.
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:25.960]  But it got so bad.
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.600]  They were so arrogant.
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:30.680]  The EU was meant to collapse financially.
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.680]  And then a super state was meant to come out of that, holding them hostage.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.200]  I mean, that's what Davos admitted.
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:39.960]  Instead, the member states see it coming because you and others in UKIP are informing them,
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.120]  Drudge is informing them, others are informing them.
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:45.160]  And so the people are informed, they're pulling out beforehand.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.200]  The global government project is in deep trouble.
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:49.320]  Now, that's a lot, but please tackle it.
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:52.160]  Yes, the global government is in deep trouble.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.040]  The central banks have failed.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:57.240]  They've run out of, they don't have any weapons left.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:02.720]  A study just came out by the United Nations, as you know, last week.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:09.680]  This is the greatest migrant refugee crisis in world history, bigger than World War II.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.640]  It's just begun.
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:15.040]  All of the 65 million people have fled.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.960]  It's bigger than World War II.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.840]  Now let's just do the numbers.
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:23.520]  Back in World War II, there were 2.3 billion people on the planet.
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:28.080]  We now have added 5 billion people since.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.640]  Now let's go around the world.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.640]  Hey, how about Nigeria?
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:35.920]  Oh yeah, the biggest country in Africa, what, 147 million people?
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.240]  There's more than that now.
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:39.600]  Yeah, and the economies collapse.
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.440]  Oil prices collapse, they're leaving.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.360]  There's revolution going on.
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.920]  Go to Venezuela, take a trip to Brazil.
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:51.520]  Go around the world, gone to South Africa, Zambia, name the country, name the place.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:56.640]  Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the UK, everything's unraveling.
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:01.960]  Right here in the US with cook numbers, we have a 1.8% growth rate, that's a depression.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:05.200]  So that's what I'm saying, the whole thing is collapsing.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.960]  Now let's go back to the Orlando, what happened there a few weeks ago.
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:18.920]  So one guy ostensibly goes nuts, and it's a big issue, let's stop this from happening
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:24.280]  again by robbing us of our Second Amendment rights, as if that would have anything to
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:25.760]  do to stop anything.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:32.080]  I'm making that point because when the next explosive element hits, they're going to use
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:40.800]  it as an excuse to take more of our rights away and to keep us down, quiet, and put in
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:41.800]  place.
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.320]  So the big trend, as you've been saying, is they're coming after the guns, they're coming
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:48.200]  after the private property, they're coming after the cash, they're coming after the farmers'
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:50.480]  rights, they're coming after true sustainability.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:54.920]  The good news is I'm seeing more and more local police departments, and governments start
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:24:00.000]  to actually figure this out and openly realize that the federal government's run by a bunch
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.560]  of multinational criminals who plan to absolutely bring us to our knees.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:15.720]  That's what the Brexit vote was about, it's no different whether it's the EU or Washington.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:25.640]  No, it's a bunch of clowns over there, a chorus of what, 536 congressmen and senators
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.720]  telling 320 million people how to tie their shoes?
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:31.560]  I mean, who made this stuff up?
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.720]  So it's no different.
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:40.000]  So yeah, this isn't 1778, I mean, come on, there's a whole different world right now.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.320]  We don't need these people to run our lives, and by the way, what's going on now with the
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:50.320]  Brexit, I want to read this to you, this was 8 days, it was our trend alert, so I'm sure
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.240]  you guys got 10 days before the Brexit vote.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:25:00.880]  On a broader socio-economic and political scale, with anti-immigration and anti-EU populism
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:08.960]  movements rapidly spreading throughout Europe, should British citizens vote to exit, we forecast
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:17.800]  similar direct democracy referendums igniting across the continent to leave the EU swiftly
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:24.720]  leading to the disillusion of Brussels' central government control, elimination of the Euro
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.160]  and a return to national currencies.
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.400]  The war has begun.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:35.320]  That's right, and now within two days of it happening, we're now five days in, eight countries
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:39.200]  have lined up and the polls show they're going to exit, and I just got chills, Gerald, and
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:44.080]  the EU, unelected bureaucracy announced, we are ready to take your military over, you
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:47.520]  can't leave, that is so sensational.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.360]  So give us your forecast, what do you expect the arrogant bureaucrats in their own lala
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.000]  land to do next?
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.760]  They will fight and do anything they can to remain in power and rob us of our rights.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:07.960]  They will start wars, they will enslave their own people, rob us of more of our rights.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:10.440]  They'll start race wars?
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.440]  Everything.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:16.600]  You name it, they're going to do it, they will do anything to remain in control.
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:23.200]  And again, you know, GCs, 3Gs, guns, gold, and a getaway plan, you know, you never know
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:28.520]  what's going to happen, and you see what's going on with gold, and if you well know,
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.240]  we've been forecasting this, you know, as you have.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:34.080]  Oh yeah, the elites have been hoarding it while telling us not to get it, that's why
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.640]  I didn't sell any of my gold and bought more.
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:38.280]  And I told Lester, well, I don't know what's going to happen, but my gut tells me it's
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.240]  going to go up over time, which is starting to do.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:45.080]  Let me ask you this then, we see FEMA internal reports getting leaked, where they think 395
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:48.520]  percent food price increases what they're wargaming in the next decade.
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:52.280]  Now that's year by year, but that's still ultra massive, as you know, just 10, 20 percent
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:57.360]  a year will cause, you know, riots worldwide, and they talk about civil unrest, collapse
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:03.080]  of society, while they stockpile weapons and guns, what do you think they think is going
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.080]  to happen?
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.720]  I mean, are they going to trigger an implosion, or is the implosion already begun, and they
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.800]  just think they're going to ride it to power?
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:13.400]  They can't stop it, it's the central banks have failed, they have negative interest rate
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:19.600]  policies, negative, what, 40 percent of the bonds being sold, you buy the bond and when
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.880]  you cash it in, you get less money, and you can't make this stuff up, negative yields,
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:24.880]  the way chew boys go.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:29.360]  Well, meanwhile, I predict that you will see the mainstream media admit it's gone bankrupt,
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:34.080]  and basically even the facades will be taken down now, because they literally have 6 percent
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.680]  trust rates and polls, they have no viewers or readers anymore, I predict in the next
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:43.760]  year you're going to see massive media collapse, more than you've seen the last 10 years combined,
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:48.240]  Gerald, you can stick a fork in them, you can see them only intensifying their lying
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:50.480]  and it's not working, what do you think about my prediction?
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:55.200]  Well, I think you're right to an extent, but they still have a lot of power, because it's
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:02.360]  the mass media, and so, we're talking about Brexit, for example, two days before the Brexit
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:13.400]  vote, only 26 percent of Americans even knew about it, and so what I'm saying is they still
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:18.360]  have a lot of power even at that low level, because they'll put out the main message,
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:22.280]  but of course, they're losing it, and people like yourself and myself...
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:26.840]  No, I get it, they can still unify and push a fraud, but the frauds deteriorate in a few
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:29.840]  days now, used to take years to expose them.
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:35.040]  Exactly, now the other issue, what you were saying about the price of food, it's not that
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:40.400]  the prices are going to go up, it's the value of the currencies are going to decline.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.400]  Exactly.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.160]  So, that's what we're looking at.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:47.520]  So, they're spinning it, it's not that food's going up, it's the money's going to devalue.
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:48.520]  You got it.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.800]  So, it's not a supply and demand issue.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:54.400]  Well, see, everything's a deception, that headline's a deception, you're right.
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:29:00.080]  It's the devaluation will make your food cost more, not that food prices are going up.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:05.840]  Right, and that's what I'm trying to say about the central bank failures, because what you're
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:11.720]  seeing now, the great fear of Europe, and you mentioned the other countries, France and
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:19.280]  Netherlands, and Italy, and others that now want referendums to leave, they had an election
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:25.200]  in Italy with the five-star movement, what, two weeks ago, a woman, Virginia Rajee, she
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:30.520]  became mayor of Rome, they won in Torino, the five-star movement.
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:36.040]  Incredible, incredible, Gerald Salente, please come back for a full hour next week, you can
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:40.840]  do it, trendsresearch.com, invaluable information, folks, for people that want to be informed.
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:41.840]  Thank you so much, Gerald.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.840]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:49.360]  We have the congressman, David Bratt, joining us today with us.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:53.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:00.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:05.080]  UN official found dead was set to testify against Hillary Clinton's same day, barbell fell
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.080]  on his neck.
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.600]  That's right, the former president of the UN General Assembly was awaiting trial in
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:13.040]  a bribery scandal when he died during a weightlifting accident.
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:18.240]  Dr. Ashar, Westchester County's medical examiner, says the cause of death was traumatic asphyxia,
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.800]  though she did not perform the autopsy herself.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:24.240]  The local police department said in a statement that the death appears accidental, but provided
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.880]  little information otherwise.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:26.880]  Here are the facts.
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:31.280]  John Ash was preparing to go to trial for what Reuters called a wide-ranging corruption
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.280]  scheme.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:38.000]  His codifinit was Ing Lap Singh, a 1998 Senate report identified Ing as the man who was funneling
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.480]  thousands of dollars through an Arkansas restaurant, which then went to the Democratic
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:44.320]  National Committee, and this was all during the Clinton administration.
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:48.640]  In fact, Ing and Ash have even been photographed several times visiting President Clinton
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.360]  and then First Lady Hillary.
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:54.720]  So if you have any ties to the Clintons whatsoever, you better not go into the gym by yourself
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.480]  and definitely not without a spotter.
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:00.120]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.600]  Clean pure drinking water.

[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.200]  like no other.

[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:03.080]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.800]  Why is this so good?
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.320]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:14.120]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:19.800]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:23.160]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:28.240]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.480]  going on everywhere.
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:30.480]  These are all parasites.
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:33.200]  Tell us about all the stuff that said that there's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.440]  You have the neem in there.
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:37.520]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:40.840]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:44.000]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.160]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:47.000]  Living Defense, InfowarsLive.com.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.840]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:54.080]  And you support the broadcast, InfowarsLive.com.
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.320]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:33:03.320]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:44.320]  Well, he's the guy that beat Eric Cantor, even though the power structure threw everything
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.360]  they had against him.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:50.120]  And he's the best-selling author of American Underdog.
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:56.080]  And as I said when this happened a few years ago, this is a major bellwether for populism,
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:59.000]  not just here, but all over the world.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.240]  Classic Americana populism became the model of freedom worldwide after our victory that
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.160]  was kicked off in 1776.
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:10.320]  But by the year 1800, the United States became the model of countries that wanted to get
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.760]  away from tyranny.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:15.800]  And most people know who David Brad is, who I'll have to go into his whole bio, but we're
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.800]  excited to have him on with us till the end of the hour.
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:22.120]  And I'm going to open the phones up in the third hour and into the new Benghazi report
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:27.000]  that's just shocking and so much more, we're also going to get into our reporters who are
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.960]  down on the border that have talked to the Border Patrol who admit that they're ordered
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:36.240]  to release people that have TB and scabies.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:40.120]  I mean, it is just sensationally over the top.
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:44.880]  And it's getting worse since the Supreme Court ruling came out, because people think
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.720]  that's going to stop them so they're just flooding.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:49.920]  But Obama says he's going to ignore it.
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:54.840]  This is just really hard to believe that a president would do something like this.
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:57.840]  If you're going to bring people in, why not get a medical treatment at least?
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:00.760]  I mean, you know, that's what they did at Ellis Island.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:09.120]  People always say, Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, okay, well, they had quarantine there.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.120]  Real quarantine.
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:14.320]  We're going to talk to Congressman David Brad of davidbrad.com here in just a moment before
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:17.240]  we go any further just briefly.
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:21.840]  First week for an entire week, and it's one of the top trends for the last few months,
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:24.000]  is Hillary Clinton going to jail?
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.680]  Was the top search term also massive uninformed people that haven't really been in the system
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:31.760]  or haven't been voting that Trump's talked about, they're starting to get informed.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:37.360]  That was the second most searched term, millions of searches a day.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:40.080]  What party is Hillary Clinton in?
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:46.720]  So I've talked to the Trump people, it's a report I haven't put out yet, but they've
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:51.640]  got internal polling that shows Trump's really actually had when people aren't scared that
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:53.520]  their name's going to be released.
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:56.320]  So again, there's this intimidation that you're going to be called a racist.
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.320]  That's what's going on.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:01.040]  There's a lot of closeted Trump supporters need to come out of the closet, but let's
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:05.840]  just digress from that and go to somebody who is a successful individual who's taken
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:06.840]  action.
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:09.120]  That's our guest, David Brad.
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:11.400]  But look, we've sold out of two versions of these.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.040]  They sold out a few days ago.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.720]  We have the third version in, it's a collector's edition.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:18.520]  It has infowars.com on the right soldier.
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:25.760]  On the back, it says legalizedfreedominfowars.com on the front, Hillary for president 2016.
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:29.600]  This is what, this is the meme that Trump picked up eight months ago with our listeners
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.920]  at his rallies.
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:37.600]  This is the meme that has folks on CNN, Fox News, on camera and people hacking highway
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:40.440]  signs and saying, Hillary for president, please don't do that folks.
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:47.400]  But I mean, this has become a big meme and infowarriors who got the shirts, you are the
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:50.320]  reason this is going so viral all over the place.
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:54.280]  This has really reached critical mass and I've got an exciting announcement to make
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:56.000]  that we're going to our guest.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.440]  We've sold 50,000 of these.
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:00.920]  Now you'd think, wow, that ought to fund our operation.
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:03.680]  No, I've got 50 plus crew members just hired more reporters.
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:07.680]  It's very expensive to run a news operation and we do it not with advertising mainly,
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:15.680]  not with self-funding, true populism, non-GMO seeds, t-shirts, books, videos, G-Shock watches,
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:22.640]  optics at really low prices, non-GMO, high quality, storeable foods, infowarriorsstore.com.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:26.520]  Things like that, things people need.
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:29.160]  And we have sold a lot of these shirts because a lot of times we're selling them for sale
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:33.360]  for $9.95, sometimes it costs for $5.
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:36.960]  We're not doing this with this current batch because we need to fund our operation.
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:39.320]  You support the InfoWar, you see the effect we're having.
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:43.480]  These are $19.95 that printed and produced right here in America.
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:47.760]  It supports the broadcast, it's the third version of the shirt, it may be the final
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:48.760]  version.

[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.240]  in today.

[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.800]  cleanse and things like that that have done it.

[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:27.800]  to stop right there.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:32.760]  Now, talking about a true populist, the book is out, it's already a best-seller American
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:33.760]  underdog.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:39.920]  He is the guy that of course shot down Eric Cantor, the big establishment compromising
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.960]  Republican in the vein of Boehner having to leave and all the rest of these people.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:48.400]  So exciting and DavidBratt.com again is his website.
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:51.360]  Thank you so much for coming on with us for the next 20 minutes.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:56.400]  So this hour ends, I'd like to give you the floor for your view on populism, what's happening
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:01.720]  in Congress and where this country is going and do you think Trump is neck and neck a
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:02.840]  header behind?
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:06.000]  What does your gut instinct tell you Congressman?
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.360]  Yeah, my gut, well I think you set it up really well right there.
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.640]  I mean you look at the Brexit thing right now.
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:17.680]  I'll just start with that because it just shows you that this thing is international
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:24.080]  in scope and my book highlights three pillars that made the United States great but it's
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:30.120]  equally applies over across the pond, the Judeo-Christian tradition and then the rule
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:35.960]  of law and then the innovation of the free market system that has to be chosen.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:41.480]  And Britain was first to the punch on all that stuff right, I mean they preceded us
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:48.400]  and now Brexit, it's just interesting the commentary, Brexit by itself isn't enough to ensure success.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:54.360]  They have to go back to restoring their culture which is the Judeo-Christian tradition and
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:58.920]  then the rule of law and restoring their borders and they have to go back to free market.
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:04.480]  But they continue doing the socialized thing and the PC thing like we're doing that there's
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:11.040]  no clear path forward for them either and so it's just amazing to me to see the same
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:16.400]  exact stuff going on here on the rule of law, our borders immigration was a huge issue.
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:22.280]  I ran on, Trump is running on it, it's 80% issue and the leadership in Congress, they're
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:28.680]  not tone deaf, they exactly know it's a huge issue but they're just scared after the Romney
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:34.160]  loss, they went to this autopsy report and that report basically taught us that we should
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:39.840]  all be scared of our own voters instead of being courageous and so in the budget last
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:47.080]  year instead of doing refugee cutting off all the hot spots and state sponsors of terror
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:50.920]  they didn't put that bill in, Brian Babin and I were working on that, instead of doing
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:57.760]  that bill they increased H2B visas by 400% and so there's your rule of law in terms
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:03.000]  of the Judeo-Christian tradition, religious toleration is becoming a safe zone where you
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.440]  got to sign up before you can go to church it looks like and then on the free market
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:12.880]  system, not much in DC, it's free market at all, it's all cronies and elitists running
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:18.520]  the world either from Brussels or else from fancy hot spots around the world but none
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:21.480]  of it's being run through constituents back home in our districts.
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:25.720]  And of course the contemporary of yours would be something like Nigel Farage, a true populist
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:30.320]  and patriot, a true conservative and nationalist, he gave a speech to the parliament of the
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:34.920]  EU yesterday that's ceremonial, he said, look you're not laughing now, you were laughing,
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:40.760]  I'm getting from you Congressman, the Washington rhinos and Democrats and liberals, they're
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:45.160]  not laughing anymore, they're more scared, why don't they just embrace what made us
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:48.920]  great because they've got to see the writing on the wall, no amount of illegals they're
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:53.560]  shipping in or no amount of jihadis they think are their babies are going to counterbalance
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:57.840]  this populist awakening, or am I being too optimistic Mr. Brett?
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:03.560]  No, you're being too optimistic but you're right, I mean if you got a patriotic sense
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:09.320]  that you do but the one variable you're missing is the one I taught for 20 years in economics
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:15.120]  just always follow the money and so if the people want a certain outcome but it doesn't
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:20.600]  help the elitist control $4 trillion a year in the budget, it ain't going to happen and
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:24.880]  that's what's going wrong, right, we don't have term limits, we got folks that are just
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:29.840]  shooting to be leaders in DC for the sake of being leaders but they're not leading
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:33.000]  on the main levers that will move our country into a better world.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.120]  Sure, they're listening to the elites and not the people, so let me ask you this question
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:39.560]  because you bring it up and I never used to be on the whole bandwagon, you know, obsessing
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:42.560]  on Islam all day but now they've opened us up to it, they're bringing in the most radical
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:47.840]  elements, the evening standards reporting the new Muslim mayor came out, I'm sure you
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:53.000]  already know this, we had said no more women in bathing suits or scantily clad in billboards
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.680]  in London on buses or government property, he goes we're going to start bringing in Sharia
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:02.840]  law basically and now he said we're going to take back control of London and ignore it
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:06.200]  and bring in more foreigners and basically make a breakaway state.
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:13.280]  He's actually saying this, I mean this is seditious and I see the left truly allied with Islam,
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:18.880]  the Orthodox which is aggressive, Jihad Islam and I used to hear this five, ten years ago
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:23.160]  from conservatives and I'd go you guys are being overboard, look I know there's terrorists
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:27.520]  and stuff but our elites aren't going to ally with this, I'm sorry Obama and others have
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:30.800]  allied with it, am I wrong congressman, what's going on here?
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:36.320]  No, you nailed it but there's some severe splits and contradictions coming up on the
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:41.680]  left, you just identified one of the huge ones and that's what I try to outline in the
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:48.120]  book right, I go through the western synthesis of basically reason coming out of the Greeks
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:54.160]  lining up with a Judeo-Christian tradition and ISIS across the way doesn't know of this
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:59.600]  tradition in any way shape or form and so our guys Madison and Jefferson were utopian
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:03.920]  in some sense, they were conservatives and knew that human nature is fallen but they
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:09.600]  thought they could design a system that would separate power such that we could have religious
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:14.880]  toleration, what they could never envision a day where a certain religion would be intolerant
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:15.880]  period.
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:20.040]  Yeah, they thought freedom would be so popular nothing could compete with it but when it
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:26.640]  meets psycho cavemen who don't even understand it, what do we do then?
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:32.000]  Yeah well and that's right but the guys back then it was reasoned freedom right, it was
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.480]  freedom in the pursuit of truth and reason and we've left that part off, now it's just
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:40.040]  the 60s freedom, do whatever the heck you want and so that's
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:44.240]  And so what are the liberals going to do when they're trying to say Trump is homophobic
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:48.320]  and it's his fault Orlando happened, when this guy's a jihadi and a Hillary supporter,
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:52.200]  I mean they seem completely conflicted as you said.
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:56.320]  Well and deep down I'm friends with the Democrats up in DC too, they know it's not true, he's
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:01.360]  been in Manhattan for 50 years right and all of a sudden this week he's all these bad things,
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:05.680]  I mean they all smile up there, they know that's not true but it's just the left doing
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:07.760]  their thing.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:11.360]  Wow Congressman David Bratt is our guest, tell us about the book underdog, I haven't
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:16.160]  read it yet but I intend to because obviously your success story, what you did to the Republican
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:21.400]  establishment I would say is the big chink in the armor, was the first big bellwether
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:23.440]  in this cycle?
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:30.400]  Yeah well the main frustration I taught economics for 20 years and I taught 20 year old kids
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:35.480]  sitting in front of me, they were just awesome, we had fun every day and I went to seminary
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:39.760]  before I did my PhD in economics so I always taught them you got to put ethics and economics
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:44.640]  together and you know that gathers a chuckle these days, people think it's cute but I meant
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:50.360]  it, we've racked up 19 trillion in debt, there's 100 trillion in unfunded liabilities and the
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:53.840]  next generation is not going to see social security and welfare.
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:58.920]  Yeah where are the ethics, we're totally screwing ourselves now and the next generation and
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:01.680]  they just say oh who cares about them.
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:06.840]  And so everything these days in the modern world has devolved into just this policy debate,
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:11.760]  right, policy, policy, policy and if you lose your culture it doesn't matter what you try
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:13.720]  to do on the policy front, it's gone.
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:20.240]  So you've got to restore those basic institutions we had, Harvard, Harvard when it was founded,
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:26.160]  their motto was truth for Christ in church in 1640, right, when the Puritans who they
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:30.320]  mocked today founded Yale, Princeton, Harvard, Stanford etc.
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:33.760]  Yeah I love how they mock the founders who actually made them so great.
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:38.080]  Yeah so that's right and then Jefferson and Madison and Madison went to roughly speaking
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:43.880]  Princeton Seminary and studied Hebrew for kicks and so these were hugely educated folks
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:50.120]  that put basic first principles down on paper and made us the most successful, richest and
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:54.800]  the most just country, right, if you want to look at women's participation in the workforce,
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:47:00.360]  civil liberties, political rights, and the left, the left, I don't call the left, the
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:04.800]  totalitarian mental patients, invert that and claim we're the source of all the evil.
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:05.800]  Why do they do that?
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:12.960]  Right, well yeah and that's the funny part, the left they can't name a serious philosopher
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:19.240]  of note that they use to ground their system, right, I mean they got Karl Marx and Rousseau
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:24.720]  and a few other lefties from Paris or something but they were losing to a tradition that can't
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:29.760]  name a serious moral philosopher and so that tells you we just don't have to fight in us
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:33.400]  you know and most conservatives are just decent people, they go into business and make a living,
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:37.360]  they just assume, well of course you know the Judeo-Christian tradition is going to be
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:41.560]  around free markets, we're always going to be free to do this and the rule of law is
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:47.280]  fine and everyone will of course respect the police until none of those are the case anymore.
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:51.680]  Right now if you say God bless you to a kid that sneezes in school you get reprimanded
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:55.760]  and the whole thing is being assaulted step by step by step so I try to lay it out in
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:00.360]  the book and show people how these things have made us great in the first place and
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:04.080]  then show the assault on these basic institutions.
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:08.960]  Well absolutely and the corruption in the system uses that corruption to further bring
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:12.960]  down what was good in the old system and to bring in more tyranny, it's like the UN and
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:17.720]  their Strong Cities Initiative and the Justice Department comes in and corrupts police with
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:22.400]  unconstitutional actions then turns around and blames all police nationwide and then
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.200]  attempts to globalize them and federalize them is just incredible.
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:33.720]  Yeah, no that's exactly right and last week on the, they know assault rifles for people
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:40.160]  on the terrorist wait list and the left forgot a couple key features, one is no due process
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:44.660]  but more importantly guess who was going to be in charge of the private secret list.
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:51.520]  That was going to be this jihadi guy who said at the FBI he wouldn't work against fellow
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:52.520]  Muslims.
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:59.480]  Right, right in the AG Loretta Lynch right is going to be like she's targeting conservative
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:05.200]  groups along with the IRS and the Obama administration and we're supposed to trust them to be the
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:07.760]  school monitor over truth and goodness.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:12.440]  Sure but I forget his name I saw the article in Breitbart and a bunch of others a few days
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.040]  ago the guy that was going to run the list for her is a Muslim.
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:17.040]  Oh guy yeah.
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:20.800]  Yeah yeah who with the FBI wouldn't go after jihadis.
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:26.400]  Right, no I know it's inverted right and so Obama's goal at the outset I think most
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:31.920]  of us were somewhat aware of the anti-colonial innings but his view is if you downgrade
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:38.000]  the United States the world will be a better place and that he's working on that systematically.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.800]  Instead of after World War II the United States and Britain and France set up the modern liberal
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:49.200]  order Bretton Woods and worked with our archenemies Germany and Japan and we were trading with
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:55.400]  them and had good relations and it was a win-win and now the leftists are taking control and
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:57.720]  those relationships are falling apart.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:01.600]  That's right and again Hitler was a socialist you can call him a fascist but whatever he
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:06.520]  came from the left a command and control guy so was Stalin and they sit there I mean they
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:10.520]  don't understand the left historically look at the French Revolution it was a nightmare
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:14.600]  they just run around murdering people I don't know what's wrong with them.
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:20.720]  Yeah well in that in the getting rid of history in the in the K-12 agenda right now is one
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:25.520]  of the most troubling things and so that's another reason I put the book together American
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:30.840]  underdog at proof that principles matter right and that's what I'm trying to show the kids
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:33.920]  that these principles will affect their life period.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:37.480]  Well I'm finding the youth are very hungry to find the truth and I mean people should
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:41.480]  get your book they should put it in libraries they should get it out to everybody because
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:46.200]  you I want to talk about the election where you think it's going and and and where Obama
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:49.500]  is going with the open borders ignoring the Supreme Court I mean there's got to be will
[01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:52.680]  Hillary get in trouble from Benghazi what about the new report well Benghazi and a lot

[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:14.240]  former head of psyops for the State Department and one of the founders of Delta Force top
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:18.920]  counterterrorism specialist he's going to pop in he was our source a week after Benghazi
[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:23.160]  that laid everything out of what really happened a lot of it from really secret sources even
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:28.680]  got a visit from the FBI over some of it Colonel Shaffer got called in got chewed out he was
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:34.520]  on that same week basically told us the same thing Tosh Plumlee many others it goes beyond
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:39.680]  Hillary screwing up she sat there for 13 hours because they were going to transfer the weapons
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:46.160]  and the ambassador wouldn't do it and so they just pull that all the security and then some
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:49.960]  security said no we're not pulling out and that's why they weren't able to go in and
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:56.920]  just take him out quickly so that was about shipping weapons to Turkey and then to Al Qaeda
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:01.120]  later ISIS okay we're going to talk to him just for 10 minutes next hour and then I'm
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:05.320]  going to your phone calls eight hundred two five nine nine two three one now Congressman
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:09.200]  I don't want to get you in hot water here get into subjects you know like that and going
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:14.560]  further with Benghazi but Hillary's lot about it all her emails show that where do you think
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:18.720]  this is going because if she gets away with this doesn't this set the precedent for anything
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:26.160]  to go sir yeah no I agree with that and I mean the left kind of just says there's no there
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:31.360]  there but they're eight hundred page report in the few new pieces I've heard coming out
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:36.840]  today seem pretty significant and those guys if you've got Gowdy and Jim Jordan telling
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:42.080]  you some their truth tellers they don't mess around and so I think we got the real deal
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:50.280]  this time well what do we do then move for hearings on Hillary or I mean the grand jury
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:56.040]  in Dider what do we do yeah well that's they're going to have to follow up but we're having
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:01.320]  a hard enough time taking out Koskin and the head of the IRS our own leadership has to
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:06.400]  get in on the fight and I heard one of the guys today I don't want to identify but he
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:11.800]  was saying there's a little hint that our leadership is not in any hurry to get into
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:16.680]  a fight over this so we got to convince them it's the right thing to do and we haven't
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:21.640]  fought seven years against Obama I came in a year and a half ago on the unconstitutional
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:26.920]  amnesty and we still haven't put up a fight on that one and so that that's why the people
[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:31.520]  are getting fed up with our brand right now they want to see a fight and so I'm not on
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:37.080]  that committee but I'll encourage a fight every every bit along the way well we know
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:40.680]  you're in there fighting and speaking of that the Supreme Court says hey you got to follow
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:45.080]  the law so Obama comes out says I'm not going to follow it and it's beyond just not enforcing
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:49.600]  they complete the smuggling process as you know and we just got new video congressman
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:54.360]  will send it to you with the border patrol in McCallan saying we're ordered to ship people
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:59.560]  in that have TB and skabies I mean that's that's sensational Obama orders border patrol
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:08.240]  to ship in TB yeah no I mean the problem with that issue is it's just huge the passports
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:15.280]  the refugees the open border the drug channels the ISIS channels and there it's just too
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:20.240]  much but I finally I think we're getting to a critical point the folks DC are starting
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:25.960]  to get the memo and there's enough the average person at home is starting to see the impact
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:29.720]  when you're paying the tax bill for all of this and you all of a sudden you see your
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:34.880]  state and the governor doesn't even know there's facilities all over your state people being
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:40.400]  shipped in I've heard they get to change state based on their feelings these days that you
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:44.920]  can guess where I'm going with that one oh listen oh listen they don't even the most
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:51.720]  of me just get released to democratic party facilities yeah I've been followed in Virginia
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:56.720]  where we're keeping our eyes on several facilities in my own seventh district they won't even
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:01.320]  tell our governor the numbers they won't even tell the governor of Texas the numbers yeah
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:06.880]  well so this you're you're getting to the key point here is our government is demand
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:12.360]  driven right I mean it ultimately the citizens have to get fed up and so you're educating
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.400]  people I'm educated that's what's got to happen and we got to educate the next generation
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.600]  that you got to put up a fight if you would like to keep living in this country the way

[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:57.360]  all this going why all this lawlessness why all these attempts to bankrupt the country
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:01:04.600]  well we're run by big central mega banks that control trillions and made up assets trillions
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:09.360]  and real assets who control the issuance of currency and credit worldwide who've established
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:19.160]  a planetary three part world government that they're now rolling out publicly and they
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:23.080]  need to go ahead and just break our will they need to just go ahead and set the precedent
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:28.880]  that they can do anything they want in any way they want at any time they want that's
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:38.560]  the attempt it is a breaking of the will and that's what this London evening standards
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:44.080]  reporting with the new Muslim mayor who says you're not going to show women in bathing suits
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:53.480]  anymore on billboards or buses and we're going to promote sharia law and we're going to ignore
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:57.480]  the brexit and we're going to bring in whoever we want this will be our own country that's
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:04.120]  why they had radical jihadist imams that call for killing gays and killing women and all
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:08.800]  the rest of it coming out in support of the euro because the euro is allied with that
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:19.840]  because it's allied with totalitarianism it's allied with evil
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:28.360]  and I'm not going to sit here and be lectured anymore first he said the buses were declared
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:32.960]  glory to all of us oh isn't that cute then it's by the way you're not going to show
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:43.760]  women in bathing suits or next if we don't show women's faces isn't that just the cutest
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:52.640]  thing you've ever seen in your life and then I'm sitting here as a libertarian as a patriot
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:57.280]  as a constitutionalist conservative in many respects you mean conserve the bill of rights
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:07.280]  conserve the constitution the left you know gave him coverage they gave him left cover
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:12.360]  saying oh he's moving to ban body shaming ads from london transport remember the liberal
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:16.480]  groups wanted in new york the beach body ad that just shows a woman that I would even
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:20.920]  say is anorexic she's a little little skinny for my liking I like the classic va voom
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:29.640]  look of a Marilyn Monroe the love shoe was tied but hey whatever I like the mature woman
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:38.320]  now 16 I was attracted to the other teens I was attacked I was attracted to college girls
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:41.960]  and college girls look like little girls me now they look I'm attracted to them but the
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:46.720]  point is is that it's an issue of taste you want to put a woman in a bathing suit it's
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:51.200]  not fat shaming that's seen by a lot of young people is what looks good looks like a Barbie
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:58.360]  doll that's your right as a company to run that ad as long as it's not deemed obscene
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:02.040]  by other standards and if the TV can show it or whatever that's fine but they start with
[02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:08.240]  city controlled things and the notice no it's it's it's it's career law being phased in
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:14.760]  and you got the left there allied with it saying oh yeah we need to have fat shaming
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:21.280]  down so that's just some of what's going on we're going to cover Benghazi for one segment
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:27.360]  and one segment only with Dr. Steve Pachennick because he was on in the week after Benghazi
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:33.200]  and laid out everything that really happened at Benghazi and so did our other guest and
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:36.920]  I just want to tell you I mean we were right again we were up front again we took the rest
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:42.480]  again put it out there because it's our job to break the ice like an icebreaker for the
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:47.120]  rest of the fleet to come in that's why I don't care about being criticized or demonized
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:51.440]  or even lied about because I realize it's a mission against known criminals I'm in a
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:55.800]  war I know I have personal integrity I know I'm doing my best job I can't tell the truth
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:00.280]  I'm not always totally accurate but but by design I try to tell the truth.
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:05.920]  Joe Biggs here with info wars dot com final Benghazi report details administration failures
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:09.920]  the 800 page report was released on Tuesday and marks the culmination of a two year long

[02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:21.560]  I mean Hillary I mean Hillary has consistently slammed the probe as a political Vandetta
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:25.160]  Republicans have denied those accusations and Chairman Trey Gowdy's committee offered
[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:30.280]  new details about how Clinton State Department fell to protect the diplomatic outpost in
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:35.340]  Libya and while the attack was happening in Benghazi the State Department was more worried
[02:05:35.340 --> 02:05:41.880]  about Marine Corps uniforms during the attack an attack that left four Americans dead the
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:46.760]  report also said the CIA missed the looming threat despite warnings and wrote faulty intelligence
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:52.840]  reports after the attack look Hillary Clinton belongs in one place in one place only prison
[02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:57.240]  handcuffed Hillary Hillary for prison 2016 pick up here Hillary for prison t-shirt today

[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:31.520]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on the toll free number to join us coming
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:35.520]  up in the next segment balance of this hour before Paul Watson takes over from London
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:45.960]  England in the fourth hour of overdrive is 800-259-9231 825-99231 now sometimes we have
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:49.360]  Dr. Steve Chinick on every three or four months sometimes he comes on every week sometimes
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:54.600]  couple times in a week when his expertise is absolutely needed he was on and if you
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:09:00.120]  go back to the week after Benghazi four years ago when we had colonel Schaefer and a few
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:07.480]  other experts on who broke down what really happened at Benghazi there was a stand down
[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:12.520]  they did pull the security out in the weeks before the Turkish ambassador was there there
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:19.600]  was an argument over what weapons be shipped into Syria did ambassador Stevens say no
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:28.440]  to that so he had to be taken out or were they just tying up loose ends so that there
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:36.200]  would be no witnesses to the three warehouses of impad missiles stinger missiles anti-tank
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:41.320]  tow missiles things like that that's what I've been told by Tosh Plumlee and everybody
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:45.680]  else and Tosh came on a few months after and by the way he'd have the Justice Department
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:49.640]  call to threaten him right after that happened he talked about Hillary and her foundation
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:57.080]  and using the State Department to transfer the weapons out and to be able to get around
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:02.320]  export bans all of this has turned out to be accurate but Dr. Steve Pachennick who was
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:06.720]  high level in the State Department and go through his bio on that one of the founders
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:12.760]  of Delta Forest ran the camp David Accord's medical doctor psychiatrist also has a degree
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:16.440]  from MIT I'm going to stop right there people know who he is we only got 10 minutes before
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:20.480]  we go to break so it's a quick report from him about this new report that Congress has
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:25.320]  come out with which I don't really think has too much new in it but it kind of codifies
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:31.080]  a lot of it together and then you see Congress scared to go the next step of saying hey you
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:36.840]  did this on purpose and you were caught lying you witch when it's completely evident so
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:41.800]  in the final summation what really happened from all your sources and then tell Dr. Steve
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:46.480]  Pachennick because you you hit it right on the head four years ago well four years later
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:52.440]  what are the optics now well the worst optic that I can tell you in the audience is the
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:58.600]  fact that no one man will be more responsible for the ascension of Hillary Clinton to the
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:06.920]  presidency not Trump not even Hillary Clinton then Trey Gowdy that man was so incompetent
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:15.320]  so stupid in and arising and creating an 11 hour interrogation of a Secretary of State
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:22.600]  who correctly identified that none of the areas within that secured area was really State
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:30.000]  Department in fact it was CIA, DIA, MI and the people who should have been held accountable
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.800]  was not Eric Boswell who's the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security it wasn't
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:41.120]  Pat Kennedy who's the Under Secretary of Management both of them work for me they only follow
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:45.840]  orders the people who should have been held accountable was Hillary Clinton for having
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:52.040]  gone into Libya but Gowdy never discussed this issue never went into the real problem
[02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:58.800]  of how she created a chaotic state and a terrorist state the building itself was not a State
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:05.600]  Department building it was a secure counselor which basically goes under the CIA and in
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:11.800]  the movie 13 hours you see it brilliantly they basically say look we have 23 operatives
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:17.360]  here I won't identify who they are as well as the fact we have diplomatic security and
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:23.960]  on top of that we had mercenaries who had been SEAL operatives so who's responsible for this
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:28.600]  the person who was the director of the CIA at the time was a general David Petraeus we
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:35.200]  never heard a word from him and subsequently after we had put him in into the CIA Obama
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:40.800]  blew him out for having said that this man had a sexual relationship with his biographer
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:46.400]  so he's at fault then we have Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta who was also director
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:51.720]  of the CIA and knew very well that he had ordered a stand down to every one of his military
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:57.640]  officers including Martin Debsey who should have intervened because in fact they were
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:02.440]  So your issue is it's not just Hillary it's a whole bunch of people and why did they invade
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:07.640]  Libya why did they back Al Qaeda why did you know I mean here's the problem the problem
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:14.120]  is the gaudies of the Republican Party and the Democratic Party they are not they do
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:19.040]  not spend the time to learn the issues they do not spend the time to understand the issues
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:25.840]  but they have no problem asking for 12 million dollars from the American public to initiate
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:31.360]  an investigation which had nothing really to do with Hillary Clinton if anything gaudy
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:37.280]  has insulated her so well that no one else in the political campaign particularly in
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:42.040]  the Democratic campaign could have done a more brilliant job of showing Hillary to be
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:50.680]  historic resilient forceful and calm when I watched that over 11 hours I said this man
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:56.800]  gaudy has to be an absolute moron he has to be the stupidest prosecutor I had ever seen
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:02.960]  in my life because what he did for free or cost us 11 dollars but for free for Hillary
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:09.920]  was to basically guarantee her ascension to the White House if you were gaudy and have
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:13.560]  the Secretary of State in front of you what would you have said I mean points you would
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:16.640]  have gone into I wouldn't have brought up the Secretary of State she had nothing to
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:21.240]  do with it nor would I brought up Pat Kennedy or Eric Boswell I would have brought up the
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:27.320]  DCI the director of the CIA I would have brought up Susan Rice national security advisor who
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:31.720]  said that there was a video that went on I would have brought up general okay so you're
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:34.960]  saying you're saying they're actually I know you don't like Hillary Clinton but you're
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:39.640]  saying they're scapegoating Hillary Clinton well I'm saying is worse than that look I
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:44.400]  have said a lot of negative things about Hillary and I understand her exceedingly well over
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:51.160]  20 years but I grant my opposition the traits and talents that she has she's tough she's
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:57.480]  really resilient she knows how to work under stress and what he did gaudy as a prosecutor
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:03.040]  prosecutor hasn't has to know his witness has to understand the psychology what he did
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:08.760]  is what we call a bear trap in the financial markets he fell right into the trap and he
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:13.720]  got caught he didn't know what he was saying he had no idea what he was talking about when
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:18.080]  in fact sure basically displaying everything she had always okay well let's get back to
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:21.360]  this and get away from it for a moment what is the bottom lines what you said for years
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:27.360]  ago the bottom line nothing will happen ambassador Stevens unfortunately went on his own whether
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:33.120]  he's also a member of a three-lettered agency I don't want to say but my suspicion is he
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:38.200]  wasn't just a ambassador in the state department the state department did the best it could
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:43.800]  it had no real jurisdiction over a counselor service or a an entity which is really under
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:49.240]  a covert operation which belongs primarily to the CIA and it's right there in that movie
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:56.280]  13 hours when the CIA DCI and the station chief said listen you've got eight hours of
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:00.920]  drones on me when are you going to give us help and the military refused that help so
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:07.120]  you've got Panetta and you've got Martin Debbsney to answer for those questions it's not an
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:11.440]  issue for Hillary Clinton it was not an issue for Pat Kennedy it was not an issue for Eric
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:16.520]  Boswell it was an issue for General Hamm who was head of AFRICOM and the Navy admirals
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:21.480]  who were only two to three hours away that's the issue okay well then who ordered the stand
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:25.560]  down then what was the whole goal of Benghazi what really happened what really happened
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:31.560]  in Benghazi was the fact that they were putting in a unit which they knew could not be an embassy
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:37.400]  and instead they used it as we use all over the world a place which is under the jurisdiction
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:44.080]  of the CIA or DIA or MI military intelligence to make it a covert operation in that place
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:49.640]  where they had transferred guns going into Turkey and Syria that's a legitimate entity
[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:56.240]  within our covert operations within the intelligence community what is not legitimate and was not
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:17:02.200]  appropriate was the fact that Hillary Susan Rice and Samantha Powers all three women the
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:09.280]  tripartite of incompetency in the White House decided to take down Gaddafi that's the issue
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:15.600]  that should have been analyzed and handled neither one of them including the DCI Betrayers
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:21.560]  knew how to take down Gaddafi and understand the consequences of that regime change and
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:26.920]  that's what in fact happened but Suey Jenner is the fact that she was in charge of a consulate
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:33.000]  that was under covert operations the answer is no I'm sorry my dogs are barking but basically
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:39.400]  the dogs of war are barking basically what I'm saying is Gowdy had transferred the whole
[02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:48.280]  optics away from the real issue of incompetency and regime change to one of really enforcing
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:53.120]  Hillary Clinton's strongest traits resiliency commitment
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:58.560]  just to be clear though you're supporting Trump you're not supporting Hillary Trump
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:04.280]  but I think Trump has a problem now Trump had wanted to have Trey Gowdy as the attorney
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:08.920]  general that was a big mistake Trey Gowdy went after Rubio which I suspected but the
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:14.600]  real issue here is that this is a warning to Trump whom I do admire and I think he has
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:19.880]  a real problem now and understanding what the Benghazi issue was all about and so do
[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:26.200]  his his coterie of Republican hacks I mean he's hired a whole bunch of Republicans who
[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:32.800]  have been part of the Cheney Bush administration Kevin Kellum Manafort I mean he is not really
[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:39.040]  changing what has happened over 14 years when he was left alone and Corey Landowski helped
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:43.480]  him out that was the Trump that we supported now many of us are beginning to say wait a
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:49.840]  minute you're bringing in the same guys who were under Cheney and Bush and others in Manafort
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:54.640]  is the man of the system he brought in Kevin Kellum you look up Kevin Kellum he was director
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:19:00.480]  of communications for Cheney so basically what's happening now is the co-optation of
[02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:07.520]  Trump and the insulation of Hillary Clinton by none other than Trey Gowdy this is what
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:12.880]  happens when you're not very bright when you're not very competent and when you're narcissistic
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:18.320]  and you're being and you're underwritten by the American taxpayer welcome to the American

[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:43.600]  an e-year but it's unelected and their own documents admit they want total planetary
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:50.000]  control towards eugenics it might not be a good idea and they know the average person
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:55.400]  i want to fight some global tyranny so they just go that doesn't exist that's a tinfoil
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:25:01.440]  hat the average lazy person says okay i want to believe that but then pretty soon you turn
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:06.120]  on local news and it goes to u n's in charge of bringing in the refugees into texas you're
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:11.040]  going to pay for it and by the way 22 of them got tb and we're not going to treat them or
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:16.320]  test them we're going to put them in school with your kids in high schools all over the
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:25.040]  country are reporting refugees raping young girls those report out of germany where the
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:31.560]  two migrants raped a woman that's on info wars dot com today and the headline was migrants
[02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:39.440]  told police the reason they raped her was they'd had a bad day just a german woman there
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:45.920]  in the middle of the day at the flower garden having her lunch sitting back having a ten
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:51.960]  minute snooze on a park bench who hadn't done that after having her lunch they just raped
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:58.160]  the living daylights out of her they admit it they said it's a woman that's what you
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:05.000]  do you just a woman there you rape her now there's the headline muslim asylum seekers
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:10.200]  in germany having a bad day so they raped a woman and it gets weirder and weirder and
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:15.440]  weirder and in third world countries and a lot of these cultures this goes on i mean
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:23.320]  look at mexico police troops routinely rape-arrest women amnesty international reports and that's
[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:27.520]  because you've had the collapse of civilization that stuff goes on here too now i don't want
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:32.320]  a civil war with the police but i'm going to fight for our police how to turn into this
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:37.000]  and in some areas they have that doesn't mean having some civil war though that george soros
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:42.440]  finances is going to fix it taking our country back look the police being corrupt is a reflection
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:48.320]  of the general people we need to change that and by the way if you don't think we can't
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:51.800]  go the way mexico has gone you're gravely mistaken most societies end up collapsing
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:57.960]  into this and then only groups of thugs will take the jobs because good people won't be
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:04.640]  part of it and then more evil gets in and that's how you go i mean i studied the sociology
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:09.360]  fifty years ago mexico had a lower crime rate than most u.s. cities and the people it was
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:13.960]  all family-oriented super nice and honorable in almost all areas and there weren't police
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:19.200]  raping women if you raped a woman their family can kill you but mexico's had guns to a certain
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:24.360]  extent back then see mexico's been through the liberalization process you see where
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:30.520]  government's god and we're going there too a lot of places they won't by the way now
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:35.120]  they're admitting okay we did arrest people in idaho and there was a sexual assault and
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:38.440]  all this but you know the prosecutors now threatening people they're trying to cover
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:43.920]  that up it's the same story cover up for the muslims because you can get away with that
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:49.400]  and get away with anything ties are too busy you know telling men they shouldn't wear pants
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:53.520]  that's the real problem isn't it sheila in main you're on to the air go ahead thanks
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:28:02.120]  for holding hi alex it's an honor to talk to you honor as well go ahead thank you listen
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:08.960]  i just um i went on and looked up uh about john ash you know related to the clinton
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:17.040]  thing you know the uh so-called uh weightlifting yes sorry you faded out there you said the
[02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:22.720]  so-called what uh i'm sorry uh you know john ash when you were saying about the weightlifting
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:31.720]  incident yes okay would you try and look it up on bing or google and that doesn't even
[02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:41.360]  show up so i was trying to say was that they're they're monitoring or filtering uh you know
[02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:47.960]  so you know when the information comes up they don't want you to see it well ma'am uh
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:51.480]  you you've got the secret service agents and you've got the fbi agents that have worked
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:54.560]  around the clintons with our punching bill clinton and our screaming and threatening
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:59.600]  to kill people and her with all her girlfriends and her you know on drugs or whatever when
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:05.560]  she was younger when you try to search you know hillary uh criminal investigation it
[02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:10.760]  goes to her and crime bills so yes google admits they've been censoring for her and they meet
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:15.760]  weekly with her campaign to help gain everything that's why you've got to go seek out the key
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:20.760]  knowledge when you find it create records of it yourself print it out always print print
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:26.440]  articles out for myself and then when you find key intel or key videos save those get
[02:29:26.440 --> 02:29:30.720]  those out to people share those links and it's a fight between artificial intelligence
[02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:35.440]  already being programmed by technocrats and we the people that matter how much censorship
[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:39.960]  they do that they can't stop us sending emails to people without totally turning off the
[02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:43.560]  you know the lights that's why everybody should sign up for the free newsletter info wars dot
[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:47.720]  com or slash newsletters we could send you stuff they try to censor it but great great

[02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:34.160]  all right i'm gonna run through your calls as quickly as possible scottish john
[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:38.800]  i tried to call in sonny never had a chance to we're gonna go to him right now then chris and kasey
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:48.560]  and mike and jason and others jason says he sees un marked cars pulling over cars you know i would
[02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:52.560]  think that'd be a hoax phone call we're gonna go to him but but i'm telling you now they have brand
[02:33:52.560 --> 02:34:00.480]  new armored vehicles coming in at ports being shipped around the us and they're pre-deploying
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:05.360]  un peacekeeping equipment it's not like 20 years ago when people would find some old thing in louis
[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:10.880]  ganna that was like a couple thousand old trucks from the 70s and 80s that had un on the side that
[02:34:10.880 --> 02:34:17.360]  would have been shipped into the us for scrap and then i'd get on air and say no i don't think this
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:22.400]  is a un invasion but they are training for gun confiscation here's a training manual or here's
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:28.720]  the military training to do it and then have their operatives go you're covering up the the un
[02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:36.240]  launches the takeover next month fed and of course they wouldn't launch the takeover next month the
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:41.120]  the truth is not going to be one big takeover it's just oh the un suing sure of a pile oh the un
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:45.920]  tells us to let the refugees in oh obama gets his authority to do all this and go into syria from
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:52.480]  the un oh obama doesn't need congress oh strong cities initiative is going to sue local police
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:58.640]  departments that don't sign on the democratic party operation and look the democrats are taken over
[02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:03.200]  to be the one final party the republicans at the top are just their operatives and collaborators
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:09.360]  but the democrats are the takeover group it's clear and so it's not that the un's taking over
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:17.360]  globalists set up the un to transfer power to it but it was the rockefellers but we really are
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:21.600]  going into a world government program that's what the unelected euro is just like they say you can't
[02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:26.800]  get out from underneath our system and then as we told you england voted to get out and they're
[02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:31.280]  saying oh sorry we're going to trigger in this clause we the bureaucrats wrote that you have to
[02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:38.480]  have another vote and then another vote another five years drags on or even if you vote to get out
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:45.680]  like was it five different countries or referendums it was um but it was france and one other
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:52.000]  country in 2005 and they voted like with 70 something percent france to get out are they out of the
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:59.280]  eu no they're not and now the EU says we're preparing a military leadership to take over all
[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:03.360]  the militaries and merge them into one you're not allowed to leave i mean it's just sensational
[02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:08.800]  but they'll have beckham you know the soccer player get up there with his wife you know oh the
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:14.320]  spice girl and i think it's really good and loving for the immigrants and if you're handsome like me
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:20.480]  you forward and then all the girls go out and protest and get we like beckham open the borders
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:29.360]  and media player oh i mean it's just triumph of idiocy but even when we triumph they just go sorry
[02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:34.880]  we're not going to stop it and all the liberals that hang around the jihadi mayor and go i love
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:42.000]  islam you're like here's footage of him killing a thousand you know homosexuals right shut up homophobe
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:47.360]  you're like you know that doesn't make sense that's a logical you're mentally ill they go
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:52.240]  i know we are we're in charge but see they're not they run nothing they're no bodies but they just
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:57.440]  accept whatever the screw job is and play fantasy land that they're in charge it's called mass stock
[02:36:57.440 --> 02:37:04.640]  home syndrome it's called learned helplessness it's called the normalcy bias on pcp scottish
[02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:10.080]  john scottish tree i met this guy years ago protest scottish john lives in texas scottish john
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:14.960]  what is your take on all this hey alex how you doing good my friend go ahead
[02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:20.480]  hey i don't know if you heard but do you know that england got knocked out of the european
[02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:25.200]  soccer championships yesterday uh yes and i know they're going to knock them out of everything and
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:29.600]  say you're not part of europe now even though they could compete in europe before the dictatorship
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:34.480]  says you can't be part of anything now i just thought it was funny they managed to exit europe
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:42.320]  twice in the one week and listen what you were saying earlier about older women you know what they
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:49.040]  say about older women the older the fiddle the sweet of the tune now i want to go back i want to
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:53.440]  go back a couple of years ago when i was on your show talking about the scottish independence
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:38:00.560]  referendum and which we lost and it wasn't too long after the votes were announced or the result
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:05.920]  rather was announced that we started seeing evidence of vote fraud and even the leader of the scottish
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:12.720]  tori party ruth davidson she announced on television that she had actually sampled postal votes from
[02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:18.240]  the the islands and that's against the law she was questioned by the police but we never ever heard
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:23.520]  anything about it anyhow further down the line there was a young fella who's a big big fan of
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:29.360]  viewers was listening to that show and he actually started his own youtube channel and subsequently
[02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:34.880]  got his own radio show on a network called truth frequency and we eventually found each other
[02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:39.520]  and he's heard me as a guest on his show several times and it was on last thursday and we were
[02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:45.360]  talking about the brexit and of course we weren't expecting it to happen the way it did now he had
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:51.280]  another guest on a guy called chris everard who's a documentary filmmaker and he also has a show on
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:58.000]  tfr and i heard him on sunday afternoon alex talking to leo zagami and he happened to mention
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:07.360]  that he figured that uh nicolas sturgeon the leader of the snp is actually mi5 and that
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:13.520]  raises a very very very interesting question because my friend in glasgow his name's kev baker
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:20.560]  we could we correspond every day and he's never met anyone who actually voted to stay in europe
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:26.240]  so there's something very fishy going on sure sure listen what they did is
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:30.720]  is i've thought because they because they can constitutionally even though they never voted
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:35.920]  to be part of it say you have a second vote and then it narrowly you know loses next time
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:44.800]  the exit polls show that it was much higher people voting to uh leave europe than we're voting
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:50.400]  to stay so i agree with you major hankie pankie scott shon good good to hear you calling the
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:57.120]  broadcast and i don't mind shoutouts and he he does it nicely but i tell you every line he said
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:00.880]  was a shoutout that that's all his buddies that's great but you know i really like shoutouts like
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:06.640]  mom hey mom it's goddess john from austin texas kc in origan you're on the air welcome
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:14.640]  i came up with a term called the unexit it's about the editing the un and i was going to see
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:21.040]  what you thought about holding a vote uh for the us to believe the un i think it's a beautiful idea
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:27.280]  we should have the un exit and we should start a petition at whitehouse.gov you know they started
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:30.800]  that to just act like they listened to you but as soon as we started dominating and others did
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:34.160]  they started making him be a hundred thousand signatures or whatever and we got that they said
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:41.600]  oh more but yes we should start a movement uh to exit uh the uh the united nations criminal
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:46.240]  operation i totally agree and they try to hold us hostage they're the parasites that are trying
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:51.040]  to dictate to us and and the us funds have to you in so i'm sure the un'll tell us the sky's
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:55.440]  going to fall if we don't you know stop letting them run our lives like having some deadbeat
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:59.840]  husband that beats his wife and she works two jobs he says honey you're not gonna have a i mean i
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:05.760]  can't tell you in my life years ago the bullies in some cases the bad employees that you catch
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:09.760]  doing really horrible stuff haven't had bad employees a long time crew members and they
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:13.840]  literally look at you and say you're going to collapse without me and i'd say okay great have
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:18.560]  a nice day uh but it's just how delusional these people are and you look at the bureaucrats it's
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:24.480]  when Nigel Farage uh said to the EU bureaucrats yesterday he said most of you never worked a
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:30.400]  day in your life and most of them haven't i mean they are just the appointees of big megabanks
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:35.200]  who first set up the euro it's an unelected pollut bureau where they hand the power down to the next
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:42.800]  person so the debate is over uh casey because this is something that they never voted to enter go ahead
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:49.280]  i was going to say also we could possibly might be the right climate for people to accept after
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:55.360]  the break that happened to do maybe possibly a meme contest on the un exit yeah i'd actually
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:41:58.960]  have to have crew members though to judge it and post the meme and make sure it got the full
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:02.880]  traction's why we haven't been doing a lot of contest because we'll get a thousand entries and
[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:06.800]  we can't even process it all so we're trying to hire a few more crew members get them trained
[02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:11.760]  that's a process as well so we can actually try to you know reach out and actually uh
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:16.800]  interface with more folks but uh great points casey thank you uh let's go ahead and talk to
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:22.880]  mike in california mike you're listening on 1340 a.m i should add uh go ahead hi there
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:32.640]  hello can you hear me i can hear you oh cool hey um i wanted to ask you uh to mention
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:39.280]  something because you've done it before about faith based initiative um you know you talked
[02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:46.720]  about some of these uh parishes sponsoring illegal immigrants um as a transfer point and
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:55.520]  also too if you could consider a possible interview with oliver stone to discuss snowden
[02:42:56.480 --> 02:43:01.760]  as well as uh this uh 2016 election and maybe trump i think a lot of listeners would be interested
[02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:10.400]  well i know this um snowden has come out and criticized putin for his warrantless spying
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:14.480]  which i think is admirable he's been trying to get out of russia and get into another country
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:18.800]  and i'm not demonizing russia overall but i mean in many cases it's just as bad
[02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:24.240]  as the stuff going on here people say well that means it's okay then no it's it's it's not okay
[02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:30.240]  um but uh i think snowden is a hero i think he is for real i think what he's done is very very
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:35.360]  important to to to to force this giant criminal operation out in the open that isn't there to
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:41.520]  keep us safe but is there overall uh to absolutely control our lives i mean look i'm all for open
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:47.120]  intelligence gathering on the open web to track things because i mean in private companies do that
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:51.840]  websites do that that's just data you know to be marketing but when you sit there and actually
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:55.520]  listen to phones and read emails you know google didn't tell people till we made a big deal out of
[02:43:55.520 --> 02:44:01.440]  it and others did that they read your emails with ai computers well that's not right you know uh so
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:10.400]  as for oliver stone you know i've known his son john stone for probably eight years or so i co-hosted
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:16.000]  with deterrent him a season of a show not knowing pretty darn good he's been on here in there um and
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:20.480]  i've just nicely said hey i'll ask your dad to come on him and but at the same time his dad i
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:24.400]  disagree with him on some issues i think he has a lot of courage probably some of the most courage
[02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:29.520]  in hollywood with his alternative history series and the stunt movie he's got coming out he kind of
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:36.240]  put out a 9-11 movie that went with the official narrative uh i'll be quite honest with you i'm not
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:41.120]  five ten years ago i would be thrilled to have oliver stone on the show but i really
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:46.240]  it's kind of boring you know i'm kind of past oliver stone and i don't mean i'm better than
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:50.400]  oliver stone or i'm more accomplished in oliver stone i mean it'd be nice to have him on to talk
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:55.040]  about his pieces and get him to say what he thinks of them and and maybe news making if he said
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:45:02.240]  something controversial sure that'd be great uh you know it's like uh david lynch big fan of a
[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:08.160]  lot of his movies and then i he comes to austin i talk to him privately and he says you know one
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:16.800]  thing to me and then he comes on my show and is scared to say any of it and it's like i'm not mad
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:21.280]  at david lynch for that at least he's one of the hollywood people that's willing to come on if i told
[02:45:21.280 --> 02:45:28.880]  people and this was kind of fun ten years ago you know um all the people in hollywood that have
[02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:33.440]  contacted me and all the rest of it and you know oh come out here let's talk about a film project
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:38.400]  and you fly out to la you fly to new york or they want you to fly to the the rikea veck or fly to
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:42.080]  london yeah and they want you to come meet with them and you go meet with them and it's just
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:48.880]  them wanting to be political but scared of doing it it just really gets old and so that's why i said
[02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:54.800]  like like i can go out to la and meet chris carter who says that the new x file series is a
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:58.480]  character based on me and that i'm a good guy and i like chris carter he's a really smart guy

[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:06.560]  but it's just kind of like almost like leave him over there it's like i kind of don't worry
[02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:10.400]  or like like like joe rogan i've been friends with him since like 1998 he's hanging out with him a
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:14.960]  lot he's gotten busy i've gotten busy he's always saying come on my show i say come on mine never
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:18.720]  happens last you know year or so people always ask i finally got mad and just said look forget
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:22.000]  joe rogan he has this show i have my show and then joe texted me and said hey here's my new
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:25.600]  number maybe didn't have it but i want you to come on buddy you know love you i love you too okay

[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:35.120]  were talking the other day and it's like we just but it's not like we're even jaded it's just kind
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:40.480]  of like he does his thing i do my thing and it's kind of all over stone does his thing and then i do
[02:46:40.480 --> 02:46:44.880]  my thing but i have a talk show so i should try to get these folks on i only get people on him i'm
[02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:50.240]  trying to learn something from him um like i want to see what this congressman says
[02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:55.920]  and then i wasn't eavesdropping on him i wanted to go talk to him during a break he didn't know
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:59.920]  i was listening and i got to hear behind the scenes stuff where he was saying all these really nice
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:04.560]  things and i said hey go ahead to shut that down i don't want him to you know he doesn't know i'm
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:10.640]  listening so turn it off you know you just kind of pick up stuff or to have pochinicon that guy's a
[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:16.080]  total character or or all these other folks we have on that's what i'm really into i mean look
[02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:22.800]  it was way more fulfilling to have matt drudge show up almost had a heart attack super reclusive
[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:27.360]  and he's got a reason to be and then to be on my show and he's only he does like one show every
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:35.920]  few years that was way more cool to me than being in a party with brad pit with like 50 other people
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:42.080]  and and and you know stuff like that or you know talking to brad pit for 30 minutes whoop
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:48.000]  did i wasn't really into it then you know being in a party that george cloney's at being in a
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:54.640]  party with like four people and you know there's uh what's his name from fast times at richmond high
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:59.680]  you know or or or you i mean it's like you almost don't want to be behind the scenes
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:06.000]  with josh brolin and uh shan pin because they're just sitting there like basking arrogantly that
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:11.440]  they must go just even when they're at a dinner going oh we're god oh my god we're on movies
[02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:16.960]  and i can still go see a movie like cicaro and brolin plays a good part the movie's pretty
[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:22.160]  accurate and like josh brolin or when he played double you but i like them as an actor i don't
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:28.480]  know i literally could care less about josh brolin he is like an arrogant five-year-old
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:36.640]  child uh shan pin is like a lobotomized monkey uh you know uh brad pit's got has to work i think
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:41.600]  it's makeup or cream to cover up pop marks in his face i don't wear makeup i don't care i'm a fire
[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:47.840]  breathing caveman and it's not about me okay but but but i want to talk to people that want to
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:52.640]  build space stations i want to talk to astronauts i want to talk to test pilots i want to talk to
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:58.880]  gardeners i want to talk to a hortic hortic hortulist hortic hortulist i'm having trouble saying that
[02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:08.880]  word i want to talk to uh quantum physicist i want to uh you know read poetry i don't want to be in
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:15.040]  this whole fakes fantasy land that is just total garbage i don't mean to go into a rant i really
[02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:23.680]  apologize that the that wasn't right i just cannot explain to people how free it is to not care what
[02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:28.080]  people think about me to not care about hollywood and i never really cared but i cared a little
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:34.960]  and i guess because i got to see behind the scenes the top of hollywood the top of music
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:43.440]  the top of politics for whatever reason and i realized it's cold it's dark it's empty
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:48.720]  and i don't want to be any part of it so don't feel inadequate the one power they have over so many
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:53.760]  people is women at the magazine racks buying whole thing about the stars and how do they look good
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:57.280]  and they show you an anorexic woman so that you think you need to look like something that isn't
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:00.640]  natural and this everything's meant to sell you something that's bad they're not even selling
[02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:04.320]  something's good i'm not gonna get selling something so they need i'm all about that that's
[02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:09.360]  symbiosis i'm not gonna sell you something that i don't think you really need or want that i don't
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:14.320]  believe in because i already realized when i sell you i sell myself and comes right back on me
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:20.640]  i'm not a rapist there's these guys that want power over women they want the power because
[02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:27.440]  they don't have power they want some weird fake power i want a woman to be in ecstasy i want them
[02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:34.000]  to have pleasure that's my pleasure that's kind of guy i am and i'm not appreciate i'm a great guy
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:38.640]  or anything the point is i realize i'm all like so many other people that don't have power don't
[02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:44.240]  have an eight power don't have primal energy don't have primal force who are just scrabbling
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:49.680]  around like a bunch of rats trying to build this world that they control to make you feel inadequate
[02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:55.680]  so you've got to come to them to get all the answers god gave you the answers in the genetics

[02:58:56.000 --> 02:59:01.200]  to want to miss this important message here's why my friends we already see major power grid
[02:59:01.200 --> 02:59:05.840]  problems and it's getting worse so please listen solar generators really do provide
[02:59:05.840 --> 02:59:10.560]  lifesaving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar generators run silently
[02:59:10.560 --> 02:59:15.680]  emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun whether it's dangerous summer storms
[02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:20.720]  blackouts intensifying civil unrest you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of
[02:59:20.720 --> 02:59:25.360]  the sheep and here's the best news if you want to get one this week solutions from science has a big
[02:59:25.360 --> 02:59:31.040]  sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth
[02:59:31.040 --> 02:59:36.400]  of off the grid gear in addition to the low price for info wars listeners so it's a good time to check
[02:59:36.400 --> 02:59:42.480]  it out go to grid wars dot com that's grid wars dot com it's a great opportunity to generate maximum
[02:59:42.480 --> 02:59:47.200]  electricity with minimum money go to grid wars dot com that's grid wars dot com
[02:59:52.160 --> 02:59:58.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:59:58.720 --> 03:00:00.720]  you
[03:00:10.480 --> 03:00:16.640]  today's interview is the guy that wrote this song is a dangerous place not because of evil
[03:00:16.640 --> 03:00:24.320]  but because of those who look on and do nothing if you are receiving this transmission you are the
[03:00:24.320 --> 03:00:33.920]  resistance we now take you live to the central texas command center it's alex jones they control
[03:00:33.920 --> 03:00:38.960]  our lives and our culture i know i'm stating the obvious by holding up these false icons of sports
[03:00:38.960 --> 03:00:45.360]  hollywood all of them and making them heroes because the media said so it should be trailblazers
[03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:56.080]  innovators people who have courage that's what built great systems and and and i want to know
[03:00:56.080 --> 03:00:59.680]  the people that love freedom and are involved i don't want to just know somebody
[03:01:00.320 --> 03:01:06.000]  because they're good-looking and can read off a script and i know that's
[03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:11.760]  an obvious statement but man you ought to see politicians world leaders
[03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:17.600]  grovel to celebrities and it's because there's really nothing inside of them they hope they're
[03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:22.960]  going to find enlightenment by being with somebody else and you're not going to find it in this modern
[03:01:22.960 --> 03:01:26.880]  culture i want to go to neil and todd and others here in a moment paul watch is coming up from
[03:01:26.880 --> 03:01:33.360]  monday nil and tons of news obviously but the caller neil i'm gonna go back to him if you just joined
[03:01:33.360 --> 03:01:43.120]  us was saying they wouldn't let me basically vote for donald trump in the poll there's hundreds of
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:47.440]  ways they run this camp hillary's the worst they admit they're doing it's like a lady earlier saying
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:52.640]  they're controlling search engine results where you can't find out about hillary's corruption
[03:01:52.640 --> 03:01:58.560]  they admit they're doing that that's what's crazy and people just can't believe it yes they admit
[03:01:58.560 --> 03:02:04.160]  and and take polls it's to create the perception that trump's losing their internal polling i'll
[03:02:04.160 --> 03:02:10.320]  talk about this every time he calls is that he's dead even or 10 points ahead seven points ahead
[03:02:10.320 --> 03:02:18.560]  and others but people are scared to say it in any type of polling where they actually twist the
[03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:23.600]  poll to say you know are you upset about trump's racism or are you concerned about these statements
[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:27.680]  or those statements and then they ask will you support trump so there's all sorts of things
[03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:31.920]  they're doing there's push polls there's polls where you call up with a bunch of fake you know
[03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:36.480]  horrible things somebody did to demonize them it's not even a bottom poll but bottom line with this
[03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:43.200]  poll they're running a poll where it's programmed into the phone where a certain number of phone
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:48.960]  calls it doesn't let you vote for trump a lot of the phone calls do get to vote and then it creates
[03:02:48.960 --> 03:02:53.360]  the perception that oh see we have a new poll out showing hillary's 10 points ahead say in
[03:02:53.360 --> 03:03:00.400]  pennsylvania where trump in most polls actually been ahead so that's how they operate is she's
[03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:05.840]  arrogant enough to you know steal states were super popular like georgia or new york i mean
[03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:12.000]  there's no into it but but neil it's important for you and everybody out there to just keep an
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:17.200]  iphone or a smartphone or whatever near you or keep video camera and just when you get these calls
[03:03:17.200 --> 03:03:21.840]  put it on speaker videotape it because you never know what you're going to catch because it's one
[03:03:21.840 --> 03:03:25.360]  thing for you to tell us this we all probably know it's true we need to get this on video because
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:30.400]  that could really illustrate for things neil absolutely and you know what i actually google
[03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:35.120]  search the company name is a gmi survey company like i don't know who owns it or anything but
[03:03:35.120 --> 03:03:39.840]  i google search they came up because they actually said that over the survey well let me ask you
[03:03:39.840 --> 03:03:44.240]  this question who are who are they mainly pollsters for it are they democrat or republican or both
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:49.440]  well that's what i'm gonna say is i'm actually a registered democrat so that's why i get these
[03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:54.480]  calls of usually for the democratic uh you know politicians in my local area and in pennsylvania
[03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:59.600]  and uh you know things like this actually just help open my eyes up and say you know what
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:04.400]  you know it's it's rigged you know it actually just as a registered democrat it's it's pushing me
[03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:08.960]  more towards trump and right now you know as a democrat i'm actually probably gonna vote for
[03:04:08.960 --> 03:04:15.200]  trump you know because two reasons on the small business owner my son goes to college he works
[03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:20.320]  part time he uh made ninety eight hundred dollars last year and still had to pay sixty
[03:04:20.320 --> 03:04:26.080]  dollars in federal income tax total bull and then there's all the fika and social security
[03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:29.920]  and then all the other and all the cell phone taxes there are hundreds of so-called federal
[03:04:29.920 --> 03:04:35.520]  taxes most of them are totally unconstitutional thank you neil uh yeah i don't know why a lot
[03:04:35.520 --> 03:04:39.200]  of democrats aren't voting for trump i mean quite frankly in a lot of his history and
[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:44.320]  activities he's kind of a liberal populist on many issues i just don't think he has it out for the
[03:04:44.320 --> 03:04:49.280]  country that's why the global is for real or so angry at him i'm going to come back and take a
[03:04:49.280 --> 03:04:55.680]  few more calls quickly and then i'm going to give you some inside baseball on trump and then

[03:09:44.800 --> 03:09:54.960]  importing me into the us what we're trying to go ahead i uh i just wanted to make a comment about uh
[03:09:54.960 --> 03:10:00.800]  doc what dr patik said and the congressman said forget the politicians forget the republicans
[03:10:00.800 --> 03:10:06.800]  forget the democrats just get out there and do what we're supposed to do as american citizens
[03:10:06.800 --> 03:10:15.280]  and we will win we can't put all of our faith in trump like dr patik said you know he's kind of
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:22.000]  making people think he's going over to the dark side now and what the congressman said you know
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:28.400]  we got to stick to those three rules and we can work it out and what you do i'm a first time caller
[03:10:28.400 --> 03:10:37.680]  i'm kind of excited but uh i just think like my mom i'm a 55 year old man i stay home take care of
[03:10:37.680 --> 03:10:45.360]  my 76 year old dad and i talk to my mom all the time just to kill time and she hates trump she
[03:10:45.360 --> 03:10:53.920]  hates hillary worse but she does not trust trump not for a minute so you know we can't keep going in
[03:10:53.920 --> 03:10:59.200]  this big circle i was a big fox news fan until you know all this i hear you i absolutely hear you
[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:03.200]  and in a few minutes i'm going to speak to this on trump but but i absolutely get your point
[03:11:03.200 --> 03:11:08.400]  we've got to trust ourselves trust god take action change our own personal lives reach out to others
[03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:12.720]  and the world will change and then the manifestation of that will be populist movements like nigel
[03:11:12.720 --> 03:11:18.800]  forage in ukep and trump and others god bless you i appreciate your call todd i want to go to walter
[03:11:18.800 --> 03:11:24.560]  in new york and chris and johnny and others and i'll probably leave those callers for for paul
[03:11:24.560 --> 03:11:28.640]  watson and he chooses to take him i don't mean to dismiss your calls or be rude about him but i've
[03:11:28.640 --> 03:11:35.280]  got a hand of a tonda watson uh here in just a moment he's waiting in the wings but let me go
[03:11:35.280 --> 03:11:40.160]  ahead and just give you some of the inside baseball trump news let me go ahead and just break down
[03:11:40.160 --> 03:11:48.880]  some of the things happening uh in trumpland donald trump has gotten a bunch of establishment
[03:11:48.880 --> 03:11:56.240]  republicans into his campaign that helps some pretty good backgrounds working for reagan and
[03:11:56.240 --> 03:12:02.160]  others and some libertarian stripes as well like his pollsters and others so there's not all bad
[03:12:02.160 --> 03:12:08.720]  signs there because that's who knows how the party system works that's the people that know how to
[03:12:08.720 --> 03:12:17.440]  stop them trying to steal the nominations still in cleveland that's the folks that know the obscure
[03:12:18.880 --> 03:12:25.680]  arcania it's it's it's it's beyond parliamentary the the obscure arcania
[03:12:27.440 --> 03:12:33.200]  archaic systems that have been all twisted and and changed with super delegates and all the rest of
[03:12:33.200 --> 03:12:39.760]  it so i never expected trump charging into a goblins nest to not get some goblin vomit and
[03:12:39.760 --> 03:12:46.320]  slop and blood on him i just don't want to catch him in bed with a goblin but if he's in there
[03:12:46.320 --> 03:12:51.200]  rolling around hacking him up and he's got a goblin guide you know taking him into the cave
[03:12:52.240 --> 03:12:57.600]  i'm not expecting him to not get dirty especially up to his ankles i don't want to see him kissing
[03:12:57.600 --> 03:13:04.560]  goblins having political succubus with goblins i don't want to see him ingratiating goblins
[03:13:07.280 --> 03:13:12.880]  and so what are we expecting to do he he runs for office for the first time ever gets the nomination
[03:13:12.880 --> 03:13:20.160]  presumptively without spending outside money and spends 40 plus million of his own and loses hundreds
[03:13:20.160 --> 03:13:26.880]  of millions of tv shows and contract deals and beauty pageant deals and hotel deals i mean he
[03:13:26.880 --> 03:13:32.880]  has paid a big price and the guy says he's got 10 million dollars that's hotels and assets the big
[03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:38.960]  secret is donald trump um probably he might be able to get hold of a billion dollars cash
[03:13:41.680 --> 03:13:45.840]  and that's not from stone i i just bounce stuff off stone from other sources of my own research
[03:13:45.840 --> 03:13:51.600]  and he you know basically tells me if i'm accurate or i'm not but i don't think anyone knows exactly
[03:13:51.600 --> 03:13:55.520]  how much trump has but you've seen the media even claim he's not as rich as he says he is well there's
[03:13:55.520 --> 03:14:00.080]  different ways to look at things you know they could say my info or company's worth you know
[03:14:00.080 --> 03:14:05.520]  50 million dollars oh really it go go downhill in a month if i wasn't here it's actually a deficit
[03:14:06.320 --> 03:14:10.160]  but they've got all these done in brad street things saying i'm worth 50 million dollars i mean
[03:14:10.160 --> 03:14:15.840]  you know it's like if i had some painting somebody hypothetically valued at 10 million dollars but i
[03:14:15.840 --> 03:14:21.280]  can't sell it for that it's not worth that i bought the painting at a five and dime it's worth five
[03:14:21.280 --> 03:14:26.080]  dollars i don't really have a painting that's supposed to be worthy it's an analogy it's
[03:14:27.680 --> 03:14:30.320]  so here's what i'm trying to get at and then i'm gonna go to watson
[03:14:32.080 --> 03:14:35.120]  maybe i should shoot a special report on this i kind of get tired towards the end of the show and
[03:14:35.120 --> 03:14:40.480]  i don't want to i don't want to butcher this i got a whole page of notes here from different sources
[03:14:40.480 --> 03:14:46.400]  but this is this has to be done very very delicately to quote the wicked witch of the west
[03:14:46.400 --> 03:14:53.200]  you want trump to be this populace you want him to go in there and defeat him without any establishment
[03:14:53.200 --> 03:14:58.720]  money he does something no one's ever done now he's standing there in a fight he's gone to the next
[03:14:58.720 --> 03:15:04.560]  level the gladiatorial battle the ultimate level and hillary has got a machine gun fully loaded
[03:15:04.560 --> 03:15:11.840]  and a battle axe and donald trump doesn't have any of that he doesn't have any political funding
[03:15:11.840 --> 03:15:15.680]  he doesn't have the infrastructure he doesn't have anything to get at the party machine because
[03:15:15.680 --> 03:15:21.680]  the party machine won't support him because they know he isn't going along with them they know he
[03:15:21.680 --> 03:15:27.040]  really is a populist they'd be supporting him in a minute over hillary if he was a shill
[03:15:29.040 --> 03:15:33.680]  and that's really my best dead reckoning on it is trump kind of an ego maniac does the guy think
[03:15:33.680 --> 03:15:37.200]  he's you know the best things in slide spread yeah but any successful person's got to have that view
[03:15:37.760 --> 03:15:45.200]  they're scared of him for a reason though and internally in his campaign they're trying to
[03:15:45.200 --> 03:15:50.560]  get him to actually set up super packs and do all this stuff and actually take big people's money
[03:15:50.560 --> 03:15:55.360]  but when the big guys come like adelson and here's the big news and offer him a hundred million
[03:15:55.360 --> 03:15:59.920]  to take newt gendrich and then 200 million he says no adelson's not giving him anything now
[03:16:01.600 --> 03:16:05.760]  and it's the same none of the big donors none of the biggest establishment guys are giving him
[03:16:05.760 --> 03:16:10.640]  anything folks because they know he won't do what they say and he tells them i'll take your money
[03:16:10.640 --> 03:16:16.560]  but no strings attached and so i'm sitting here going why don't you
[03:16:20.880 --> 03:16:25.680]  reach out to kind of mid-tier donors and say listen you really want to change this gift
[03:16:26.560 --> 03:16:31.840]  so that's what it comes down to and i'll tell trump this what a casinos in golden palaces mean
[03:16:31.840 --> 03:16:36.240]  you know they're empty you just put up casinos in golden palaces because you know the public
[03:16:36.240 --> 03:16:42.720]  resonates to something shiny like a fish going up at 10 000 feet in the marionist trench to a
[03:16:43.360 --> 03:16:49.040]  angler fish the shyness just brings them in i don't think you're really that empty you certainly
[03:16:49.040 --> 03:16:53.360]  don't care how you look which is a good sign that you you know are beyond you know you know the
[03:16:53.360 --> 03:16:58.000]  things of childhood down becomes a message to trump
[03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:08.400]  so you're all into this thing your name everything will be completely tainted destroyed
[03:17:09.120 --> 03:17:12.400]  if they claim you were a huxer before which i don't think you are you're a salesman
[03:17:14.400 --> 03:17:18.320]  you will become that huxer forever if you fail and they will come after you and never
[03:17:18.320 --> 03:17:24.560]  rehabilitate you if you don't go all in so you know that i know that you're fully committed
[03:17:24.560 --> 03:17:31.200]  you need to just go ahead and take everything you have i mean you're out there with people
[03:17:31.200 --> 03:17:33.840]  wanting to kill you ready to die i totally admire that
[03:17:37.200 --> 03:17:40.800]  so you're you're you're you're you're committed trying to save the republic you're trying to
[03:17:40.800 --> 03:17:46.640]  step into george washington's shoes here bro at a critical juncture they say history and the
[03:17:46.640 --> 03:17:52.240]  circumstance makes the man you've got the right stuff but now you've got to take that next step
[03:17:52.240 --> 03:17:58.160]  into history and trump needs to go ahead and put down a hundred million 200 million 300 million
[03:17:58.800 --> 03:18:03.360]  and then shame all these other people in to coming and doing that to crush hillary clinton
[03:18:05.920 --> 03:18:10.960]  i mean i know this i will give of what i've majorly have saved is just emergency back up a lot
[03:18:10.960 --> 03:18:17.520]  more money to super PACs you name it if i see trump commit to the next level and trump needs to
[03:18:17.520 --> 03:18:25.760]  sell buildings sell golf courses he needs to go into trust funds he needs to go in none of that's
[03:18:25.760 --> 03:18:29.040]  going to be there when you're dead bro and you know that and you need to really go to the next
[03:18:29.040 --> 03:18:35.200]  level and just dump it you need to dump it i mean if i was you i would do that immediately
[03:18:36.480 --> 03:18:42.800]  so do it dump the money in you are now in a death battle with the globalist i'ma skip this
[03:18:42.800 --> 03:18:48.480]  network break go to paul joseph watson paul you've heard my points on this subject i mean people
[03:18:48.480 --> 03:18:53.280]  could sit there and say trump needs to you know not hire anybody from the republican party to
[03:18:53.280 --> 03:18:57.680]  run things well that's like saying don't hire anybody that has a nuclear physics degree an
[03:18:57.680 --> 03:19:04.880]  engineering degree and a nuclear chemical degree to run a nuclear power plant i mean or or that's
[03:19:04.880 --> 03:19:08.880]  like you know if i was going into new guinea and i wanted a guide to make a documentary about cannibals
[03:19:08.880 --> 03:19:14.000]  i would go hire one of the local chiefs and you know paying to be my guide so i'd be safe
[03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:19.440]  and i'd also get the inside scoop on you know where they shrink the heads um and they all know
[03:19:19.440 --> 03:19:25.120]  trump is is is hiring them to use them which isn't a bad term i mean he's he's hiring them you know
[03:19:25.120 --> 03:19:30.320]  they all know which end is up they all know he's the alpha dog that's why they're sabotaging him
[03:19:30.320 --> 03:19:35.520]  not joining him i mean this is just such proof that he's floundering unable to raise money won't
[03:19:35.520 --> 03:19:41.280]  take money from the big guys they won't give it they pledge it so we pledge a hundred million
[03:19:41.280 --> 03:19:46.080]  and yenridge loves you i'm adelson i'll give you 200 million just just do what i want he meets with
[03:19:46.080 --> 03:19:50.240]  him and comes out and then doesn't get the money adelson may give a couple million you know for
[03:19:50.240 --> 03:19:56.800]  this or that just to hurt trump because people know he's really working with hillary uh i mean
[03:19:56.800 --> 03:20:02.080]  paul you just heard my just stalled there what do you think of it well i mean it it would be
[03:20:02.080 --> 03:20:07.200]  completely naive to suggest that they wouldn't try and infiltrate this i mean it's the same process
[03:20:07.200 --> 03:20:12.480]  we've seen after brexit as soon as it happened i said watch what they're gonna do they're gonna
[03:20:12.480 --> 03:20:18.400]  try and put globalists in there to infiltrate this to sabotage this to throw it off course
[03:20:18.400 --> 03:20:23.200]  so it's no surprise that they're doing that with trump but he did just come out with a big speech
[03:20:23.200 --> 03:20:27.360]  drudge has got the big red headline up there and again he's come out and said we're gonna get out
[03:20:27.360 --> 03:20:32.480]  of the tpp hillary's a globalist i'm sorry to interrupt you but the religion of peace is struck
[03:20:32.480 --> 03:20:37.200]  again they'll probably live in on the tea party reuters is reporting two explosions at istanbul
[03:20:37.200 --> 03:20:43.520]  formerly konstantinople the airport's been hit multiple injuries turkish officials so the religion
[03:20:43.520 --> 03:20:50.160]  of peace is struck again sorry paul well that's again no surprise given that you know turkeys
[03:20:50.160 --> 03:20:54.480]  helped ices along the way they're getting some blowback from it but as i said it's just like
[03:20:54.480 --> 03:20:59.760]  this post brexit process they're gonna try and sabotage it the globalists aren't gonna go quietly
[03:20:59.760 --> 03:21:06.080]  into the night they're gonna do everything within their power to try and derail this populist revolt
[03:21:06.080 --> 03:21:10.880]  which is what it is but his speech that he just gave again he's put hillary on the rack for being
[03:21:10.880 --> 03:21:16.800]  a globalist he's directly confronted the globalist so despite his meetings with you know richard
[03:21:16.800 --> 03:21:22.000]  harsh and henry kissinger he's maintained the course he hasn't switched his allegiance from
[03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:26.160]  everything he said sure and then a posh and kissinger have come out and endorse hillary
[03:21:27.440 --> 03:21:33.360]  yeah so obviously he has to play to a certain extent by their rules to beat them at their own
[03:21:33.360 --> 03:21:38.560]  game i mean he can't expect him to be some you know fringe candidate that's not going to follow
[03:21:38.560 --> 03:21:41.840]  the trend that he needs he's got to play by their rules to beat them at their game
[03:21:42.880 --> 03:21:47.840]  exactly but you know if he follows up on his rhetoric then that's the proof is in the pudding
[03:21:47.840 --> 03:21:52.800]  we have to take that risk because we know what we're going to get with hillary we know the
[03:21:52.800 --> 03:21:58.240]  devil is in the details so at least we need to give trump a chance um because from everything
[03:21:58.240 --> 03:22:04.400]  that he said and everything that he's done so far he stands in direct opposition to the globalists
[03:22:04.400 --> 03:22:10.000]  who are trying to derail him at every point and again the bushes and the clinton's vacation
[03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:16.240]  together hillary vacations with kissinger who how gross all those pedophiles and scum i'm just so
[03:22:16.240 --> 03:22:22.560]  sick of them and pedophile planes and clinton's god help us man what do you think of the left
[03:22:22.560 --> 03:22:28.800]  just worshiping this demon woman well it's it's completely par for the course i mean
[03:22:28.800 --> 03:22:33.200]  what was it half of bernie sanders supporter said they wouldn't vote for her i bet that
[03:22:33.200 --> 03:22:39.040]  number's not that high when posh comes to shove but i mean look look at what soros is saying today
[03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:44.480]  this is what i wanted to cover brexit vote must be overturned or the european union is doomed
[03:22:44.480 --> 03:22:51.120]  so he's saying that this democratic vote by the majority of the british people must be annulled
[03:22:51.120 --> 03:22:56.560]  he's now openly saying this is a freakish nazi collaborators that literally has an oxygen tank
[03:22:56.560 --> 03:23:02.800]  and a white cat still crawling around tearing up trouble i mean just soros crawling the grave
[03:23:02.800 --> 03:23:10.800]  put some dirt on it and go away he's openly advocating and legitimizing this petition
[03:23:10.800 --> 03:23:17.440]  that has been completely ridiculed this petition for a second referendum okay 25 000 people from
[03:23:17.440 --> 03:23:23.120]  north korea signed it a bunch of four chan trolls signed it the electoral commission says it's
[03:23:23.120 --> 03:23:27.520]  completely fraudulent they're not even going to consider it cameron came out and said no we're
[03:23:27.520 --> 03:23:33.280]  not going to consider it and he's still pushing this ridiculous petition from all these virtue
[03:23:33.280 --> 03:23:38.320]  signaling leftists who didn't even bother to turn up to vote in the first place that shows how
[03:23:38.320 --> 03:23:43.360]  desperate they are to sabotage brexit it's an ongoing process and that's what we need we need
[03:23:43.360 --> 03:23:47.120]  to keep holding their feet to the fire because the battle is not over on this
[03:23:49.280 --> 03:23:54.080]  and paul i was given this article an hour ago but i i i've fallen to my own trap i criticized
[03:23:54.080 --> 03:23:58.400]  our reporters never reporting on what we're doing or thinking of info wars is something important
[03:23:58.960 --> 03:24:02.800]  not even though we're cutting edge obviously but kit daniel's brought me this article i read
[03:24:02.800 --> 03:24:07.360]  the actual quotes it's insane but it's really what they're doing didn't even cover it last hour
[03:24:07.360 --> 03:24:12.960]  or a mexican president demands us merge with mexico canada e u style north american union
[03:24:12.960 --> 03:24:19.280]  that's that's a quote would kill us national sovereignty he has tweeted out that we must merge
[03:24:19.280 --> 03:24:24.640]  and create a union yeah so we can have corrupt mexican officials merging with ours making
[03:24:24.640 --> 03:24:29.600]  decisions for us and look under these trade agreements many of which haven't been ratified
[03:24:29.600 --> 03:24:34.160]  they're making these deals already just like the e u without us voting on it paul joseph
[03:24:34.160 --> 03:24:40.560]  watson that's on info wars dot com i mean this is crazy well what i mean what did you see with
[03:24:40.560 --> 03:24:46.000]  the e u as soon as brexit happened they doubled down they said we're gonna take away any remaining
[03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:50.400]  sovereignty you have because they're panicking at this domino effect that we're gonna see in france
[03:24:50.400 --> 03:24:56.000]  that we're gonna see in the netherlands and other countries and now that germany the afd party in
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:25:00.400]  germany which is the big conservative part that's had a lot of electoral success recently
[03:25:00.400 --> 03:25:07.840]  they've come out and said they want a dexit an exit poll for deutschland and the response is well
[03:25:07.840 --> 03:25:15.120]  hitler abused national referendums so we're not going to allow you to do that so because hitler had
[03:25:15.120 --> 03:25:21.040]  referendums like if hitler ate sausage he was a vegetarian but let's say hitler ate tomatoes you
[03:25:21.040 --> 03:25:26.080]  can't ever have tomatoes now and because hitler once voted in election you can't you can't vote this
[03:25:26.080 --> 03:25:31.760]  is the new political correctness literally the most anti-intellectual reason you could think
[03:25:31.760 --> 03:25:38.960]  who said that god wins law just invoke hitler who said that completely ludicrous and then the other
[03:25:38.960 --> 03:25:46.320]  aspect is again you know today we've got these virtue signaling leftist morons these authoritarian
[03:25:46.320 --> 03:25:53.600]  trendies out on the streets of trafalgar square in london protesting against democracy they're out
[03:25:53.600 --> 03:25:58.640]  there on the streets with racist signs saying you know old white people need to die this whole
[03:25:58.640 --> 03:26:04.640]  post praxit thing has been about the dumb stupid millenials who know absolutely no no it's all
[03:26:04.640 --> 03:26:11.120]  these trendy women literally in two in tutus saying old whites need to die i love islam
[03:26:11.120 --> 03:26:15.520]  like that woman we have crying going i'm a feminist i love islam these are mental patients
[03:26:16.640 --> 03:26:21.600]  yeah while the vote leave supporters are being blamed for these isolated racist incidents like
[03:26:21.600 --> 03:26:27.280]  someone telling someone to go back to africa on a on a bus you know if the british people were half
[03:26:27.280 --> 03:26:34.560]  as outraged as they are at that about the rotherham sex scandal you know 1400 young girls abused by
[03:26:34.560 --> 03:26:39.440]  muslim rape gangs again it was hardly in the media police covered it up most people are really nice
[03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:44.720]  to be in mexico but i was wearing a shirt that had a little texas on it and a guy said oh you're
[03:26:44.720 --> 03:26:50.240]  from texas that's mexico go back and i laughed at him and then he said something kind of friendly
[03:26:50.240 --> 03:26:55.200]  as i walked off but i mean you know i imagine if i had a new whole news article i was in mexico
[03:26:55.200 --> 03:27:02.560]  and he said go back to texas well alex you think that these anti-trump protesters are done when
[03:27:02.560 --> 03:27:08.240]  we've talked to them and you know aides grill x call the cook the older black guy who's debating
[03:27:08.240 --> 03:27:13.760]  the 16 year old trump supporter and said that trump's wife was an illegal immigrant you haven't
[03:27:13.760 --> 03:27:17.600]  you've seen you ain't seen nothing yet i mean we've got the most amazing footage i'm going to do a
[03:27:17.600 --> 03:27:24.480]  video on it tomorrow i've literally found footage where a 22 year old girl in britain is crying her
[03:27:24.480 --> 03:27:30.800]  eyes out because she thinks that the brexit vote will result in nandos which is a restaurant
[03:27:31.440 --> 03:27:37.920]  chain based out of south africa it will result in nandos immediately closing all their restaurants
[03:27:37.920 --> 03:27:43.200]  oh my god so she has no idea that a chain can come anywhere it wants to just pay the fee and start a
[03:27:43.200 --> 03:27:50.320]  chain exactly and again tons of other videos the euro allows her to have mcdonald's and nandos
[03:27:51.280 --> 03:27:57.840]  yeah again they actually think that we're leaving continent of europe you've got leftists on video
[03:27:57.840 --> 03:28:02.960]  saying oh i will have to now pay to travel to france the government's not going to pay for
[03:28:02.960 --> 03:28:08.480]  me to travel to france anymore they think that all the food from europe is just going to stop coming
[03:28:08.480 --> 03:28:13.200]  in all the restaurants that aren't british are going to close no we'll leave you just will be able
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:19.200]  to make your own laws and you'll be able to make your own laws on how the uu make the laws go back
[03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:23.680]  for me there was i want to do a video on this who in the government is saying hitler had
[03:28:23.680 --> 03:28:29.760]  referendums so we can't have them this is the german government the headline is now far right
[03:28:29.760 --> 03:28:35.120]  demands dexit poll for deutschland but referendums are banned because hitler abused polls it's an
[03:28:35.120 --> 03:28:40.480]  article in the daily mail well wait the referendums are banned in germany because hitler did that's
[03:28:40.480 --> 03:28:47.520]  what the article says yeah it's not the daily mail it's so direct democracy is banned because hitler
[03:28:47.520 --> 03:28:52.400]  used it once so that means all other elections have to be banned because hitler got elected and
[03:28:52.400 --> 03:28:59.760]  yes folks he got elected absolutely amazing that what they're resorting to the other thing we've
[03:28:59.760 --> 03:29:04.640]  heard and this is what soros is talking about again they're claiming that everyone who voted
[03:29:04.640 --> 03:29:09.680]  leave in the united kingdom has buyers remorse and now because they regret it that means we
[03:29:09.680 --> 03:29:15.840]  should have another referendum complete nonsense you look at the polls more people who voted remain
[03:29:15.840 --> 03:29:22.400]  are happy only one percent of people who voted leave are unhappy so it's four to one it's complete
[03:29:22.400 --> 03:29:27.520]  bs yet they're pushing this claim but everyone regrets it they're just dumb stupid again it's
[03:29:27.520 --> 03:29:31.760]  this arrogant all right paul i'm turning things over to you and i'm sorry the callers i can't
[03:29:31.760 --> 03:29:36.000]  get to you and paul uh if you want to take calls it's fine i'm not let us know paul watson taking

[03:30:04.960 --> 03:30:09.600]  on his neck that's right the former president of the un general assembly was awaiting trial in a
[03:30:09.600 --> 03:30:15.040]  bribery scandal when he died during a weightlifting accident dr ashar westchester county's medical
[03:30:15.040 --> 03:30:19.840]  examiner says the cause of death was traumatic asphyxia though she did not perform the autopsy
[03:30:19.840 --> 03:30:23.520]  herself the local police department said in a statement that the death appears accidental
[03:30:23.520 --> 03:30:28.640]  but provided little information otherwise here are the facts john ash was preparing to go to trial
[03:30:28.640 --> 03:30:34.880]  for what reuters called a wide-ranging corruption scheme his co-defendant was eng lapsing a 1998
[03:30:34.880 --> 03:30:39.520]  senate report identified eng as the man who was funneling thousands of dollars through an arkansas
[03:30:39.520 --> 03:30:43.280]  restaurant which then went to the democratic national committee and this was all during the
[03:30:43.280 --> 03:30:47.760]  clinton administration in fact eng and ash have even been photographed several times visiting

[03:33:16.960 --> 03:33:22.880]  for our lives of the alex jones show later in this segment we're going to play a report from
[03:33:22.880 --> 03:33:29.520]  faith goldie now they received emails at the rebel media from a school in canada that has
[03:33:29.520 --> 03:33:38.000]  admitted syrian refugees to a high school they're 22 years old they have full beards
[03:33:38.000 --> 03:33:45.440]  they're well-built they're hitting on 14 and 15 year old girls they're praising terrorist attacks
[03:33:45.440 --> 03:33:49.680]  this is the cultural enrichment that we're now importing and again the school has done
[03:33:49.680 --> 03:33:55.600]  absolutely nothing about it finally these emails have been released but again due to concerns over
[03:33:55.600 --> 03:34:03.840]  political correctness they're just letting 22 year old grown men you know cat call 14 and 15
[03:34:03.840 --> 03:34:09.200]  year old absolutely ludicrous situation we're going to get to that report but as i was talking
[03:34:09.200 --> 03:34:15.760]  about before the break you had a bunch of clueless leftist virtue signaling morons descend on
[03:34:15.760 --> 03:34:22.800]  trafalgar square in london today to protest against democracy now here's what's funny about this
[03:34:23.360 --> 03:34:29.520]  the initial the rally was initially cancelled because police feared overcrowding they thought that
[03:34:30.160 --> 03:34:36.560]  over 50 000 people were going to turn up the problem with that was that they were basing it
[03:34:36.560 --> 03:34:43.200]  off of facebook so 50 000 people said they were going to show up on facebook you actually look
[03:34:43.200 --> 03:34:49.040]  at the pictures it's in the hundreds it's three four hundred people actually turned up because
[03:34:49.040 --> 03:34:55.840]  these people are nothing more than virtue signalers they care more about looking progressive and
[03:34:55.840 --> 03:35:02.240]  trendy in front of their facebook friends than they actually do bothering getting up off their
[03:35:02.240 --> 03:35:10.240]  butts and voting i mean look at the brexit referendum 36 percent only 36 percent of people
[03:35:10.240 --> 03:35:19.680]  in the 18 to 24 year old category actually voted 64 percent in that age group did not vote so you've
[03:35:19.680 --> 03:35:28.080]  got 36 compared to 72 percent national turnout and they have the gall they have the temerity
[03:35:28.080 --> 03:35:34.800]  to claim that this doesn't represent britain you know here's the message only 36 percent of you
[03:35:34.800 --> 03:35:43.040]  bothered to vote whining on facebook doesn't count who knew again these are people living in
[03:35:43.040 --> 03:35:51.760]  london swank pads paid for by their rich parents and now they're out there again subverting democracy
[03:35:52.320 --> 03:35:58.000]  saying that this democratic referendum should just be annulled because suddenly they're not happy
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:03.600]  about it because a lot of their friends had a hissy fit on facebook well i'm sorry it doesn't count
[03:36:03.600 --> 03:36:10.160]  for jack if you don't bother to get off your butt go to a polling station you know in most cases it's
[03:36:10.160 --> 03:36:16.080]  literally across the road from people but they don't care they don't actually care about voting they
[03:36:16.080 --> 03:36:21.520]  only care about looking trendy that's the whole point that's why they're out there on the streets
[03:36:21.520 --> 03:36:27.280]  of trafalgar square right now again lecturing old people we've got this narrative in the british media
[03:36:27.280 --> 03:36:33.920]  the old people must die they ruined our future they're not going to be around for much longer
[03:36:33.920 --> 03:36:40.400]  anyway why do we even let them vote in the first place these are the people whose fathers literally
[03:36:40.400 --> 03:36:48.560]  fought and died for britain not to be ruled from germany and now these punk millennial idiots who
[03:36:48.560 --> 03:36:55.200]  are completely uninformed completely ignorant lecturing old people about the mere fact that
[03:36:55.200 --> 03:37:01.360]  they had to the chance to vote in fact here's a tweet i retweeted it just a while ago dear young
[03:37:01.360 --> 03:37:10.320]  remainers 65 years old plus new rationing 75 years old plus new the Luftwaffe 90 years old plus new
[03:37:10.320 --> 03:37:18.800]  panzers they didn't steal your future they gave you one yet these punks are all over youtube all
[03:37:18.800 --> 03:37:25.680]  over facebook arguing and with in some cases backed up by the leftist media saying that
[03:37:25.680 --> 03:37:31.040]  because the older generation stole their future the old people shouldn't be allowed to vote anymore
[03:37:31.680 --> 03:37:38.560]  because you know youth unemployment is really great in in europe isn't it you know 45 youth
[03:37:38.560 --> 03:37:45.680]  unemployment in spain 50 youth unemployment in greece if that's a bright future then what the
[03:37:45.680 --> 03:37:53.040]  hell are these people thinking absolutely ridiculous yet again they're being legitimized by the media
[03:37:53.040 --> 03:37:59.680]  by labor mps by idiots like richard branson who is also calling for a second referendum
[03:37:59.680 --> 03:38:07.920]  and by billionaire globalists inside a trading crocs like george soros and isn't it ironic
[03:38:07.920 --> 03:38:14.880]  that all these quo anarchists are out there on the streets protesting in favor of the political
[03:38:14.880 --> 03:38:22.640]  establishment in favor of the status quo protesting in favor of the big banks i mean leftists are all
[03:38:22.640 --> 03:38:29.600]  suddenly concerned about barkley's bank losing some money again they're complete frauds so now
[03:38:29.600 --> 03:38:36.080]  we got soros we got this article out of bright bar soros brexit vote must be overturned or the european
[03:38:36.080 --> 03:38:41.440]  union is doomed the hungarian american open borders advocate and billionaire george soros has
[03:38:41.440 --> 03:38:47.280]  declared brexit could easily be overturned you know that pesky democracy causing problems once
[03:38:47.280 --> 03:38:52.080]  again and that the european union must then be remade with power transferred from national
[03:38:52.080 --> 03:39:00.000]  governments to EU bodies again exactly as we saw yesterday they're talking about scrapping the last
[03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:05.760]  remaining vestiges of sovereignty that these countries have got in a desperate last minute bid
[03:39:05.760 --> 03:39:12.080]  to solidify to integrate into that political federal super state that they had planned all along
[03:39:12.080 --> 03:39:15.760]  meanwhile all these countries are going to be asking for a referendum this is going to be a
[03:39:15.760 --> 03:39:21.360]  domino effect but don't think they're going to go quietly into the night as i said they're trying
[03:39:21.360 --> 03:39:30.320]  every trick in the book to sabotage this soros went on to slam illiberal democracies like hungary
[03:39:30.320 --> 03:39:36.080]  which he said must be remodeled on european values oh you mean countries like hungary that
[03:39:36.080 --> 03:39:43.200]  actually try to protect their own borders that try to preserve any kind of national identity
[03:39:43.200 --> 03:39:50.320]  whatsoever this creature is a total enemy of everything that's good everything that's sovereign
[03:39:50.320 --> 03:39:55.360]  everything that's independent mr soros was appearing on a panel at the annual council meeting of the
[03:39:55.360 --> 03:39:59.920]  european council on foreign relations on the topic of britain's eu referendum he claimed that the
[03:39:59.920 --> 03:40:05.520]  british public were shocked that voters chose brexit and stated those who voted leave had genuine
[03:40:05.520 --> 03:40:13.280]  bias remorse well as i pointed out before the break you actually look at the polls only one
[03:40:13.280 --> 03:40:20.640]  percent of leave voters are unhappy only one percent regret that vote according to the polls
[03:40:20.640 --> 03:40:28.880]  meanwhile four percent of remain voters are happy with the referendum result again suggesting that
[03:40:28.880 --> 03:40:34.960]  four percent regret their vote on the remain side so it's four to one and yet you've got this entire
[03:40:34.960 --> 03:40:41.600]  media narrative which has now been seized on by soros claiming that oh ed we were just too dumb
[03:40:41.600 --> 03:40:46.720]  and stupid to understand the consequences now we regret what we did and we're so sorry and
[03:40:46.720 --> 03:40:51.680]  let's have another referendum because we don't really know what we're doing let's just hand back
[03:40:51.680 --> 03:40:58.800]  power to the technocrats and the experts because they know what's best for us complete another BS
[03:41:00.560 --> 03:41:06.800]  and again as i predicted we've got people within the british political establishment
[03:41:06.800 --> 03:41:12.400]  trying to sabotage the brexit vote this is not just coming from brussels in fact many voices in
[03:41:12.400 --> 03:41:18.160]  brussels have been more urgent to get this process done because they want to move on quickly they've
[03:41:18.160 --> 03:41:23.920]  been totally embarrassed but here in the uk it's a different story here's another headline for arch
[03:41:23.920 --> 03:41:30.880]  tori levers already backsliding on referendum outcome effectively selling out uk independence
[03:41:30.880 --> 03:41:35.920]  party leader nizel for arch who of course gave the historic speech in front of the eu parliament
[03:41:35.920 --> 03:41:40.720]  earlier today has raised questions over boris johnson and leaders leaders of the official
[03:41:40.720 --> 03:41:45.040]  tori led vote leave campaign claiming that he believes they are backsliding over the referendum
[03:41:45.040 --> 03:41:52.400]  result and of course he's right they've been largely absent in the four or five days since
[03:41:52.400 --> 03:41:58.640]  the referendum vote suggesting that they're not even that keen on triggering the article 50 of
[03:41:58.640 --> 03:42:05.120]  the lisbon treaty and getting this done getting us out of the eu following through on what the
[03:42:05.120 --> 03:42:11.360]  british people voted for this is another thing i warned about many of the people who were spear
[03:42:11.360 --> 03:42:17.680]  heading that vote leave campaign were compromised that's why they didn't even bring up the topic
[03:42:17.680 --> 03:42:23.040]  of immigration which was one of the key issues which swung the vote in the end until the last minute
[03:42:25.680 --> 03:42:31.680]  so they're compromised now they're recommending all these people to lead the conservative
[03:42:31.680 --> 03:42:38.800]  government who are globalists boris johnson himself has been almost completely absent
[03:42:38.800 --> 03:42:44.880]  in the four or five days you know since the referendum dan hernan mep who's a member of
[03:42:44.880 --> 03:42:50.560]  the official leave campaign and parts of the tori establishment have long advocated a leave
[03:42:50.560 --> 03:42:56.640]  light settlement as first exposed by brightbot vote leave boss dominic coming is on record
[03:42:56.640 --> 03:43:01.040]  saying that he thinks a second referendum is a distinct possibility and believes the uk should
[03:43:01.040 --> 03:43:07.200]  not invoke article 50 of the lisbon treaty so the exact thing we voted for the very people
[03:43:07.200 --> 03:43:13.040]  within the vote leave campaign right at the top are saying well maybe we'll just take our time on
[03:43:13.040 --> 03:43:19.280]  this will will drag our heels a little bit and maybe we won't invoke article 50 no that's not
[03:43:19.280 --> 03:43:26.720]  good enough that's not what we voted for so all that energy all that vitriol that was directed
[03:43:26.720 --> 03:43:32.160]  towards the opposite side during this brexit campaign it looks like we're now going to have
[03:43:32.160 --> 03:43:38.240]  to switch that to the people who actually won the referendum and again this was all painfully
[03:43:38.240 --> 03:43:44.800]  predictable from the very beginning you know farad just got his unfavorable ratings in the
[03:43:44.800 --> 03:43:51.200]  uk he's a divisive figure but at least he's honest and he's the one calling them out
[03:43:52.160 --> 03:43:58.320]  and that's why we need to continue to hold their feet to the fire and continue to divide debunk
[03:43:58.320 --> 03:44:05.120]  discredit and ridicule these idiot social justice warrior leftists who are out on the streets of
[03:44:05.120 --> 03:44:11.280]  london every day basically calling for old white people to die or at least have their voting rights
[03:44:11.280 --> 03:44:19.280]  stripped from them calling for democracy to be annulled absolutely shameful given the fact that
[03:44:19.280 --> 03:44:25.600]  they're completely completely misinformed i mean you've seen the videos as i said earlier there's
[03:44:25.600 --> 03:44:33.520]  literally a video of a 22 year old girl in london crying because she thinks that the uk leaving the
[03:44:33.520 --> 03:44:42.000]  eu means that the nando's restaurant chain will be closing and they had the temerity to call
[03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:48.320]  vote leave supporters quote low information you saw the video up yesterday on info wars.com
[03:44:49.280 --> 03:44:54.880]  of the young woman the vote remain supporter saying how upset she was that now the government
[03:44:54.880 --> 03:45:04.160]  wouldn't pay for her to travel to france because we're going to leave the eu now everybody's
[03:45:04.160 --> 03:45:10.080]  opinions won't be the same because we're going to leave the eu this is the level of information
[03:45:10.080 --> 03:45:16.160]  that these complete idiots are basing their opinions on so we're going to continue to watch that
[03:45:16.960 --> 03:45:20.160]  but now we're running out of time so we're going to go to this faith gold eclip
[03:45:20.160 --> 03:45:26.320]  a school in canada a high school in canada which has been admitting syrian refugees
[03:45:27.440 --> 03:45:32.880]  has basically been covering up finally the emails have been released these 22 year old
[03:45:32.880 --> 03:45:37.920]  muslim migrants with full beards well bill they've allowed them to attend the high school
[03:45:38.560 --> 03:45:44.640]  and now they're hitting on 14 to 15 year old girls here's that clip i never intended on becoming
[03:45:44.640 --> 03:45:51.120]  the voice for north american children victimized by our government's sloppy syrian migrant policies
[03:45:51.120 --> 03:45:56.640]  but regrettably that is exactly what it's come to viewers might remember my trip to halifax earlier
[03:45:56.640 --> 03:46:01.680]  this year interviews with no viscosa parents teachers and elementary school students at
[03:46:01.680 --> 03:46:08.720]  shabak do heights revealed a school sanctioned cover-up muslim migrant boys in a canadian school
[03:46:08.720 --> 03:46:15.280]  slapping choking and threatening young schoolgirls almost daily a principal unwilling to discipline
[03:46:15.280 --> 03:46:21.360]  the delinquents and a school board that dismissed the allegations as a byproduct of bigotry well
[03:46:21.360 --> 03:46:26.480]  after we ran that report right here on the rebel dot media we launched an e-tip line tips at the
[03:46:26.480 --> 03:46:31.600]  rebel dot media where we encouraged anyone whose child was being bullied without recourse to contact
[03:46:31.600 --> 03:46:37.200]  us so we could get to the bottom of it one of the emails we received included a facebook post
[03:46:37.200 --> 03:46:43.520]  that post was made by a parent whose child goes to frederickton high school in new brunswick canada
[03:46:43.520 --> 03:46:50.000]  the parent claims that school is bringing in quote an interesting mix of migrant students
[03:46:50.000 --> 03:46:57.600]  ranging from 11 to 22 years of age the parent claimed that some of the adult men in that school
[03:46:57.600 --> 03:47:03.200]  had full beards and were trying to hit on 14 to 15 year old female classmates but after being
[03:47:03.200 --> 03:47:09.360]  brushed off these adult migrant men took to successfully hitting on the girls in the years
[03:47:09.360 --> 03:47:15.200]  below the parents said that the canadian boys at frederickton high school have become frustrated
[03:47:15.200 --> 03:47:22.000]  but are too scared to speak up because quote they know how dangerous the euroracist label will be
[03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:28.240]  for the rest of their lives so we here at the rebel followed up we filed a freedom of information
[03:47:28.240 --> 03:47:33.840]  request with the school we asked for any information regarding problems or issues surrounding the
[03:47:33.840 --> 03:47:40.000]  integration of Syrian migrant students at frederickton high school well we finally got some answers
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:47.040]  some two thousand and seven hundred documents were sent our way and we've been promised yet
[03:47:47.040 --> 03:47:53.760]  another batch sometimes soon what we found inside those documents is scandalous if not fearfully
[03:47:53.760 --> 03:48:00.560]  expected emails between teachers reveal 20 year old migrant men in classrooms with 14 year old
[03:48:00.560 --> 03:48:07.280]  girls aggressively challenging teachers and other students particularly the girls migrant men using
[03:48:07.280 --> 03:48:13.840]  vulgar sexual language in arabic in front of the girls in the classroom the results of an opinion
[03:48:13.840 --> 03:48:20.880]  survey given to the syrian migrants in which shy of 20 percent said that marital rape and forced

[03:54:49.200 --> 03:54:54.480]  istanbul a turkish official has said with reports around 40 people being wounded gunfire was
[03:54:54.480 --> 03:54:59.280]  reportedly heard istanbul at the turk airport while footage showed people running for cover
[03:55:00.160 --> 03:55:04.240]  turkish broadcaster haber turk said that 40 people have been taken to hospital
[03:55:04.240 --> 03:55:09.200]  government officials said two suspects blew themselves up at the airport turkeys largest
[03:55:09.840 --> 03:55:16.880]  now of course they they've suffered um attacks from Kurdish mutton groups but from the mo it
[03:55:16.880 --> 03:55:23.280]  looks like it could be islamic state despite the fact that turkeys been funding arming islamic
[03:55:23.280 --> 03:55:28.640]  state treating their soldiers allowing them to cross back and forth between the border
[03:55:29.360 --> 03:55:36.080]  they've been hit once again another sterling illustration of why it was such a hairbrained
[03:55:36.080 --> 03:55:43.120]  ridiculous idea to stay in the EU given the fact that millions of turks expressed their desire
[03:55:43.120 --> 03:55:48.720]  to move to the united kingdom given that the EU is now talking with turkey about them obtaining
[03:55:48.720 --> 03:55:57.760]  a new membership again the paris mastermind bragged that they had exploited this refugee wave
[03:55:57.760 --> 03:56:03.360]  this migrant wave to carry out those attacks isis has bragged about it in numerous different
[03:56:03.360 --> 03:56:09.920]  instances and now turkey has been hit once again so we'll continue to cover that at info wars.com
[03:56:11.280 --> 03:56:15.920]  more cultural enrichment news out of the daily wire muslim asylum seekers in Germany
[03:56:15.920 --> 03:56:23.360]  having a bad day so they rape a woman again that's how they justified this act this woman
[03:56:23.360 --> 03:56:28.320]  was raped in a park they justified the act in front of the judge by saying well we were having
[03:56:28.320 --> 03:56:34.000]  a bad day so we just went ahead and did that it's perfectly normal if you disagree with that well
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:39.840]  maybe you're an islamic folk we've got the pope saying that the church the catholic church that
[03:56:39.840 --> 03:56:46.320]  should apologize to gays for the Orlando shooting yeah i know that sounds ridiculous but i actually
[03:56:46.320 --> 03:56:51.040]  read the quotes if you thought the afghan muslim we shot up the pulse nightclub and pledged allegiance
[03:56:51.040 --> 03:56:56.400]  to abu bakal bag daddy of the islamic state was to blame for the massacre you're wrong it was christians
[03:56:56.400 --> 03:57:05.040]  and they need to get to apologizing basically at this point the pope is an unabashed islamist he
[03:57:05.040 --> 03:57:12.240]  needs to ex-communicate himself now in aftermath of brexit we've still got these quote racist
[03:57:12.240 --> 03:57:19.920]  incidents occurring in the uk random drunk people and basically chabs hurling racial abuse at people
[03:57:19.920 --> 03:57:26.160]  on buses national outrage being blamed on brexit supporters you know millions of views on these
[03:57:26.160 --> 03:57:34.640]  videos on facebook again noticeably less concerned about the 1400 young girls in rotherham alone
[03:57:34.640 --> 03:57:41.600]  that were abused by pakistani muslim rape gangs over the course of more than a decade
[03:57:41.600 --> 03:57:49.680]  of course it wasn't only in rotherham it was in numerous other areas the market has picked up
[03:57:49.680 --> 03:57:54.480]  again today well what do you know godzilla didn't rampage through the streets we didn't have another
[03:57:54.480 --> 03:58:00.000]  great depression after brexit europe stocks closed 2.5 percent high after two days of losses
[03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:08.320]  footsie up 2.5 percent and again the pound has also recovered many of its losses since the brexit
[03:58:08.320 --> 03:58:13.280]  vote so again they feel wronged about it they said there would be a new great depression
[03:58:13.840 --> 03:58:17.760]  they're going to blame any downturn in the market on brexit they're going to blame any
[03:58:17.760 --> 03:58:23.680]  isis terror attack in europe on brexit that's the narrative they're trying to push to sabotage
[03:58:23.680 --> 03:58:30.160]  this vote we can't let them do it you have to hold that post brexit government's feet to the fire
[03:58:30.160 --> 03:58:34.560]  and demand they follow through on our democratic will that's going to wrap it up for the show
