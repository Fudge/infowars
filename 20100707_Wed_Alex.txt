[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:28.280]  alright my friends I want you to listen up and please listen to me very very
[00:28.280 --> 00:36.520]  carefully listen and listen good because I want the information we're
[00:36.520 --> 00:44.800]  gonna cover today to sink in and I want people to really buck up and consciously
[00:44.800 --> 00:58.480]  face what we're dealing with the creeping death that is this predatory
[00:58.480 --> 01:07.120]  social engineering experiment known as the New World Order we are being
[01:07.120 --> 01:15.160]  acclimated to accept total absolute draconian martial law in the United
[01:15.160 --> 01:26.200]  States I became aware more than 15 years ago of a covert program to acclimate
[01:26.200 --> 01:31.400]  the public the police and the military and the state legislatures to accept
[01:31.400 --> 01:41.960]  open military occupation of the American people and they've used lots of
[01:41.960 --> 01:49.120]  different excuses lots of different pretext oh it's post 9-11 we're gonna
[01:49.120 --> 01:53.680]  have guys stand around in New York and Boston and Chicago and LA with machine
[01:53.680 --> 01:58.320]  guns and asking citizens questions which does nothing to stop terrorist even if
[01:58.320 --> 02:04.840]  you believe that's real and oh the Marine Corps is going to have checkpoints in
[02:04.840 --> 02:09.200]  California a hundred miles in randomly searching vehicles on Friday and
[02:09.200 --> 02:13.400]  Saturday night looking for drunk drivers you're not for drunk drivers are you and
[02:13.400 --> 02:19.640]  then I learned that back in the late 80s they had regular Marine Corps with the
[02:19.640 --> 02:25.480]  local police in Norfolk Virginia and other areas raiding gun dealer legal
[02:25.480 --> 02:30.760]  gun dealers homes as part of a covert program to acclimate the military and
[02:30.760 --> 02:35.560]  the police to accept total military takeover the United States and of course
[02:35.560 --> 02:39.520]  since then we've had kernels on it with the National Guard doing drills in
[02:39.520 --> 02:44.240]  Arcadia Iowa where they were doing a lockdown of the town and a gun
[02:44.240 --> 02:48.600]  confiscation door-to-door drill that was all admitted in the newspaper and then
[02:48.600 --> 02:52.360]  when we covered it and became a political firestorm they said well Mr. Jones is a
[02:52.360 --> 02:56.840]  kook yeah we're doing gun confiscation drills but still his interpretation of
[02:56.840 --> 03:07.400]  it is kooky and since then we've seen Illinois and the city of Chicago in the
[03:07.400 --> 03:13.120]  last year and a half call for regular Army and National Guard checkpoints
[03:13.120 --> 03:18.520]  looking for illegal guns and door-to-door quote weapons sweeps I have played the
[03:18.520 --> 03:25.240]  press conferences here on air guess what now they're doing it and I have
[03:25.240 --> 03:31.360]  video out of Albany, New York of the National Guard back from Iraq with
[03:31.360 --> 03:37.800]  giant scanners x-ray machines making people drive through the x-ray machines
[03:37.800 --> 03:43.240]  in their cars literally hundreds of times more powerful than a chest x-ray
[03:43.240 --> 03:48.320]  and of course now they admit that it is 20 to 50 times depending on the
[03:48.320 --> 03:55.240]  system more in fact we reprinted from a few days ago more radiation in government
[03:55.240 --> 03:59.400]  admits more radiation and body scanners than previously thought I need that
[03:59.400 --> 04:01.880]  article I want to have the specifics I believe it was even higher in one of the
[04:01.880 --> 04:09.880]  systems in 50 times high powered cancer risk now they're gonna make you go
[04:09.880 --> 04:14.520]  through driving your car through super high powered x-rays that shoot through
[04:14.520 --> 04:19.320]  the metal of the car and here's the kicker here is what shook me to my very
[04:19.320 --> 04:26.080]  core I do this was going on covertly it is on the Albany, New York TV that
[04:26.080 --> 04:33.320]  they're looking for guns as if guns are illegal in New York and they go oh look
[04:33.320 --> 04:39.760]  we found a rifle the military has been turned into a tool against the American
[04:39.760 --> 04:44.600]  people I'm gonna cover it all when we come back my friends it is so incredible
[04:44.600 --> 04:49.400]  and we just had our camera crew get back as you know from Chicago that video has
[04:49.400 --> 04:53.800]  been posted to prisonplanet.tv a 25-minute exclusive report with foreign
[04:53.800 --> 04:57.600]  troops trained to take on American citizens and confiscate our guns all

[08:12.280 --> 08:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.800 --> 08:23.320]  Alex Jones
[08:32.240 --> 08:38.880]  I am immersed in finding the new order I am obsessed with studying legislation
[08:38.880 --> 08:45.440]  government white papers think tank white papers interviewing whistleblowers and
[08:45.440 --> 08:53.320]  eyewitnesses and I discovered back in 1995 when I first got on air that there
[08:53.320 --> 08:58.280]  were covert military gun confiscation programs going on around the country I
[08:58.280 --> 09:04.280]  was sent video shot by military people that were concerned that showed
[09:04.280 --> 09:09.320]  cooperative nugget 95 in Louisiana with foreign troops training with people
[09:09.320 --> 09:14.880]  playing the role of US citizens being stopped at checkpoints in mock US cities
[09:14.880 --> 09:20.720]  in small towns and having their firearms taken I then traveled to urban warfare
[09:20.720 --> 09:25.360]  drills across the country and witnessed Marines Army National Guard training to
[09:25.360 --> 09:29.480]  take the American people's guns and admitting it I would then see a CNN
[09:29.480 --> 09:33.560]  report in my hotel room at night of the drills and they would say troops are
[09:33.560 --> 09:40.240]  training for Bosnia troops are training for any future Iraq missions and I had
[09:40.240 --> 09:44.280]  been at the drills and I knew it was for America and I made films about it I
[09:44.280 --> 09:50.760]  desperately tried to warn people and this has been a long-term strategic
[09:50.760 --> 09:57.520]  covert operation do you realize how creepy and how evil that is not only is
[09:57.520 --> 10:01.400]  the military being acclimated and trained to confiscate our guns and run
[10:01.400 --> 10:06.480]  checkpoints and detention centers publicly in NLE09 and so many other
[10:06.480 --> 10:12.200]  drills and to set up FEMA camps in a matter of hours at sports stadiums part
[10:12.200 --> 10:18.280]  of top-off one top-off two and other drills but it's been a covert long-term
[10:18.280 --> 10:25.280]  program the earliest examples I can find of it are 1987 in Norfolk Virginia with
[10:25.280 --> 10:35.240]  regular Marines officers the Krim Dala Krim in police windbreakers raiding
[10:35.240 --> 10:43.760]  legal gun shop owners homes so they have been forging these treasonous
[10:43.760 --> 10:53.720]  relationships for 23 years that I know Eisenhower had a drill in 1960 that
[10:53.720 --> 11:01.040]  newspapers picked up on practicing taking over several US cities and that
[11:01.040 --> 11:04.360]  was because the Republicans of course had passed the first Civil Rights Act and
[11:04.360 --> 11:07.680]  they were preparing for that but but this is completely different this is
[11:07.680 --> 11:13.000]  door-to-door lock-mound cities cordon and confiscate guns and of course you
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.080]  know last year we got the Colonel on it was in the Arcadia newspaper in Iowa
[11:17.080 --> 11:20.600]  and they said oh yes they're working with a local gun shop he's playing the
[11:20.600 --> 11:24.200]  part of the terrorist militia member and he won't turn his guns in and we're
[11:24.200 --> 11:27.880]  doing door-to-door gun confiscation drills and the citizens have allowed us
[11:27.880 --> 11:31.440]  to lock down the city and go to their houses and search them search their
[11:31.440 --> 11:38.040]  cupboards was a quote and then we saw Blagojevich right before he got
[11:38.040 --> 11:41.720]  disgraced saying I'm gonna have army checkpoints we're gonna have sweeps all
[11:41.720 --> 11:44.320]  over the state for guns and we're gonna have troops go door-to-door
[11:44.320 --> 11:48.480]  confiscating guns I played the news conference now the city councils announced
[11:48.480 --> 11:52.600]  it other members of the legislature have announced it it's now going on my
[11:52.600 --> 11:58.160]  guys two weeks ago we're in Chicago the 25 minute report just went up on
[11:58.160 --> 12:04.760]  prisonplanet.tv last night of Polish and other Eastern Bloc country trips
[12:04.760 --> 12:10.400]  training to take on quote American terrorists and with weapon sweeps now
[12:10.400 --> 12:17.680]  it all comes home and hits you when you get a press release by the chips last
[12:17.680 --> 12:20.880]  year the California Highway Patrol and it says the Marines are going to be
[12:20.880 --> 12:25.320]  helping us in the next month at daytime and nighttime checkpoints in the
[12:25.320 --> 12:30.440]  county looking for drunk drivers and then the Marines were armed we talked to
[12:30.440 --> 12:35.760]  the local newspapers the eyewitnesses and our Marines pull you over search your
[12:35.760 --> 12:41.280]  vehicle take your guns puts you in a squad car and send you to jail and if
[12:41.280 --> 12:44.960]  guns are found you're just taken to jail doesn't matter of their legal now
[12:44.960 --> 12:52.360]  that is confirmed confirmed treason and I don't just throw the word treason
[12:52.360 --> 12:58.920]  around here boys and girls I walked in here 30 minutes before show time and
[12:58.920 --> 13:02.200]  Matt Ryan said you're gonna want to see this because he'd seen the Fox News
[13:02.200 --> 13:06.600]  report out of Albany that oh tonight National Guard to be on the streets of
[13:06.600 --> 13:13.760]  New York in New York State in door-to-door anti-drug sweeps and I
[13:13.760 --> 13:17.120]  said you watch that's gonna be guns as well because they mix the word drugs
[13:17.120 --> 13:20.720]  with guns to demonize guns and I walked in he said you're gonna want to watch
[13:20.720 --> 13:24.840]  this and I saw it and I had an adrenaline rush I started breathing heavy I
[13:24.840 --> 13:29.320]  started pumping my fists because as a red-blooded American I know a red dawn
[13:29.320 --> 13:35.040]  takeover when I see one and that it's such creeping death though you're
[13:35.040 --> 13:38.280]  noticing they're using the army to confiscate guns in Katrina five years
[13:38.280 --> 13:42.400]  ago you notice all over the Gulf now they're using the army backing up police
[13:42.400 --> 13:46.560]  to say felony federal charges under the orders of the Coast Guard if anybody
[13:46.560 --> 13:52.320]  videotapes what BP's doing or the chlor exit in the toxins they're dumping by
[13:52.320 --> 13:58.320]  the millions of gallons out I mean this is the end of America every chance they
[13:58.320 --> 14:01.760]  get they set the parameters and the precedent to we're not gonna bring your
[14:01.760 --> 14:05.600]  food and water we're gonna block anybody trying to evacuate on their own we're
[14:05.600 --> 14:08.360]  gonna come into your house and put you in plastic handcuffs and take your guns
[14:08.360 --> 14:16.080]  and and take you to a buses and put you forcibly on them and when the oil comes
[14:16.080 --> 14:20.520]  in they're gonna try that in the Gulf this is all drills this is all being
[14:20.520 --> 14:25.280]  done to acclimate the population and it's done to warp the minds of our men
[14:25.280 --> 14:29.000]  and women in uniform both police and military please for heaven's sakes be
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.360]  smart enough to research I mean why were they covertly having secret military
[14:34.360 --> 14:40.000]  gun confiscation in 87 why do they have Marines out doing PR stunts at drunk
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.440]  driving checkpoints from Kentucky to Alabama to California why do regular
[14:45.440 --> 14:49.440]  arm Marines come out when they have a shooting in a small town and then our
[14:49.440 --> 14:55.360]  Marines show up why do they have for security at the Kentucky Derby regular
[14:55.360 --> 14:59.120]  Army and National Guard and when people run out on the field they go and beat
[14:59.120 --> 15:05.240]  them up with 45 side arms loaded they don't let the troops on the border the
[15:05.240 --> 15:08.800]  few thousand that are down there for show in quote drug interdiction that are
[15:08.800 --> 15:11.280]  kept 10 miles off the border because the Mexican troops will shoot at them
[15:11.280 --> 15:16.600]  because they're ready for war they haven't been castrated they don't even
[15:16.600 --> 15:20.480]  let them have loaded weapons but you better believe they got 45s folks I've
[15:20.480 --> 15:24.800]  had more I've had regular army come over to me in New York with 45s on their
[15:24.800 --> 15:28.200]  side it's in my film in game come running across the street because I'm
[15:28.200 --> 15:38.000]  videotaping and scream and cuss at me with 45s on their sides loaded 45s a
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.400]  PC because I'm the enemy not those Mexican troops firing at people killing
[15:44.400 --> 15:48.720]  and when police interdict drugs they'll race across the border now up to 25
[15:48.720 --> 15:52.880]  miles in first it was a mile then three miles and six miles and 10 miles they
[15:52.880 --> 15:57.520]  control over 80 miles in sheriffs are begging for emergency help there's
[15:57.520 --> 16:00.520]  thousands of deaths but the whole neighborhoods are being burned down in
[16:00.520 --> 16:05.680]  Arizona rocket attacks in south Texas car bombs in Dallas and it's back of the
[16:05.680 --> 16:10.720]  newspaper and what is the treasonous treacherous federal government do it
[16:10.720 --> 16:14.960]  violates the 9th 10th and 11th amendment you know the 11th amendment says the
[16:14.960 --> 16:18.880]  federal government can't sue a state and it can't sue an individual on behalf of
[16:18.880 --> 16:22.520]  a foreign power why did the states that was the first amendment after the first
[16:22.520 --> 16:29.240]  10 1797 because there were already foreign powers coming in and lobbying
[16:29.240 --> 16:34.200]  federal bureaucrats to make sweetheart deals to harass certain states using the
[16:34.200 --> 16:39.240]  commerce clause so that foreign powers made larger profits on their exports and
[16:39.240 --> 16:42.880]  imports and so they had to pass an amendment go and look the federal
[16:42.880 --> 16:45.840]  government is on and was almost a revolution over it that troops actually
[16:45.840 --> 16:49.200]  from the state started marching marching on New York which was the
[16:49.200 --> 16:53.120]  Capitol at the time this is on record have you studied the history the state
[16:53.120 --> 17:00.040]  started marching on the Washington what is Washington today of course New
[17:00.040 --> 17:10.160]  York they started marching on New York on the Capitol because they were
[17:10.160 --> 17:15.040]  globalist special interest came in it was called mercantilism at the time and
[17:15.040 --> 17:19.080]  they were using federal regulators to sue and harass and mess with the states
[17:19.080 --> 17:24.520]  and so they had to pass the 11th amendment it's all there in the
[17:24.520 --> 17:30.080]  Constitution have you read the stinking thing now violating the 9th the 10th
[17:30.080 --> 17:34.600]  and the 11th amendment this is treason fed sue to block Arizona illegal
[17:34.600 --> 17:42.000]  immigrant law Mexico is a failed state it has collapsed now Arizona is
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.480]  collapsing and a third of the state conservatively is now denied
[17:46.480 --> 17:50.680]  sheriffs in three counties are saying they can't even basically leave their
[17:50.680 --> 17:55.880]  offices there are murder bounties out on the sheriffs that have called for help
[17:55.880 --> 18:00.520]  that's mainstream news and people are making jokes in the blogs and the quote

[24:34.600 --> 24:41.760]  before they even officially set it up after 9-11 to deploy federalized police
[24:41.760 --> 24:48.560]  in threat fusion centers with regular military to surveil the American people
[24:48.560 --> 24:55.640]  and carry out just unbelievable acts of oppression and now it's the times of the

[25:01.720 --> 25:06.480]  out with 4,000 and then we get their internal training documents and they're
[25:06.480 --> 25:10.760]  training to take us on and we get the New York Times and it shows explorer
[25:10.760 --> 25:15.560]  scouts training with Homeland Security to quote take on disgruntled vets our
[25:15.560 --> 25:21.160]  current military and our police are trained to take on gun owning Americans

[25:54.640 --> 25:58.920]  these young law enforcement people who run power trips and they really teach
[25:58.920 --> 26:03.000]  them that these patriots are bad and these gun owners are bad and they love
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.040]  it when the good people get out or go to a smaller department to get away from
[26:06.040 --> 26:12.160]  it because all they've got left is steroid head lunatic socialist and I'm
[26:12.160 --> 26:16.120]  telling you they're gearing up and training hard for war with the American
[26:16.120 --> 26:20.080]  people and look at how the federal government's waging war on our borders
[26:20.080 --> 26:25.480]  waging war on Arizona they love the fact that California is going bankrupt

[26:34.600 --> 26:38.360]  in bomb countries using our muscle then they come in and give them loans to
[26:38.360 --> 26:43.600]  rebuild them well they've used derivatives as a financial bomb to take us
[26:43.600 --> 26:51.200]  down and I keep repeating this because I wanted to really sink in and I wanted to
[26:51.200 --> 26:56.560]  get out there into the nomenclature this is all premeditated this isn't
[26:56.560 --> 27:01.480]  Obama this isn't George Bush this isn't Bill Clinton this isn't George senior
[27:01.480 --> 27:09.200]  this isn't Ronald Reagan they're just puppets they have been covertly since
[27:09.200 --> 27:14.520]  the mid-1980s this is in congressional hearings preparing for a military slash
[27:14.520 --> 27:18.760]  police takeover of the United States the government in congressional hearings
[27:18.760 --> 27:23.600]  in the 90s admits they ship narcotics in to destabilize this country and then
[27:23.600 --> 27:27.920]  they put young troops out on the streets with body scanners mobile body
[27:27.920 --> 27:32.440]  scanners this is on the local news and car scanners and they have you drive
[27:32.440 --> 27:41.040]  through it this is on the news them them having people drive through giant army
[27:41.040 --> 27:48.040]  car scanners and here's the mail online airport body scanners could give you
[27:48.040 --> 27:52.440]  cancer warrants expert here's another one Columbia University body scanners
[27:52.440 --> 27:57.840]  increase risk of skin cancer 20 times higher or more than previously after
[27:57.840 --> 28:03.280]  made it with just the lowest radiation emitting x-ray system and they are a
[28:03.280 --> 28:08.040]  form of x-ray 20 times and of course now they admit oh yeah we are recording
[28:08.040 --> 28:15.240]  your naked body and everyone must do it this is all dog training why are we all
[28:15.240 --> 28:22.080]  destroying ourselves police military I read to you Fox News where Maryland's
[28:22.080 --> 28:30.000]  banned that chemical added to plastic which sterilizes men I've got the
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.520]  government documents where they decided in the 50s to make that standardized and
[28:33.520 --> 28:38.640]  phase it in by the 70s and that's why your fertility is way down you're under
[28:38.640 --> 28:44.560]  attack why do you buy into this fake al-qaeda fiction I told you they were
[28:44.560 --> 28:47.880]  going to put troops on the streets in the name of fighting al-qaeda and that
[28:47.880 --> 28:51.440]  next it would be gun confiscation and now I've got local newscasts in Illinois
[28:51.440 --> 28:55.840]  California and New York all announcing that they're trying to take your guns
[28:55.840 --> 29:02.400]  and I've got newscast out of Oakland and out of Boston and out of Dallas where
[29:02.400 --> 29:05.480]  they say well the police are asking to come in your house and search for guns
[29:05.480 --> 29:09.360]  and then I've got one out of Boston where they force their way in I mean they
[29:09.360 --> 29:13.320]  put hardcore crimes on TV where the police force their way in without a
[29:13.320 --> 29:17.480]  warrant to search for guns they want your guns the first thing they did in
[29:17.480 --> 29:20.880]  Katrina was say let's set a precedent let's get their guns and that was under
[29:20.880 --> 29:29.560]  Bush and remember I'll go back to this remember what happened in Tennessee last
[29:29.560 --> 29:34.360]  year I had a state rep on the governor was in the newspaper in Tennessee
[29:34.360 --> 29:38.680]  Homeland Security had all four branches of the military out searching people
[29:38.680 --> 29:41.840]  shutting down whole highways that was video and photos of it it's in my new
[29:41.840 --> 29:45.680]  police state film police state for and when the governor said no the army in
[29:45.680 --> 29:49.520]  the military said we're gonna do it anyways it's a total federal takeover

[30:15.560 --> 30:19.480]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:19.480 --> 30:23.760]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:23.760 --> 30:27.920]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:27.920 --> 30:32.240]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.240 --> 30:35.960]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[30:35.960 --> 30:40.120]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[35:14.520 --> 35:20.280]  themselves in an even more insane way than I can even describe let me boil this
[35:20.280 --> 35:25.040]  down very simply here the New World Order are social engineers their
[35:25.040 --> 35:29.280]  psychologists their anthropologist their scientist in their own words they
[35:29.280 --> 35:32.800]  describe themselves as that they understand full spectrum dominance
[35:32.800 --> 35:36.560]  they've made a cold-blooded decision that we are subhuman because we are not
[35:36.560 --> 35:39.640]  members of the elite that is proof self-evident that we're not members of
[35:39.640 --> 35:43.860]  the elite and so we are obviously subhuman and that we're hurting the
[35:43.860 --> 35:48.280]  earth and that we need to be removed and of course most of the people that are
[35:48.280 --> 35:51.960]  in the sub strata of this themselves are being soft killed and are too weak
[35:51.960 --> 35:56.600]  minded to even admit that to themselves and get off on the power trip of knowing
[35:56.600 --> 36:03.360]  about the soft kill but just accepting it that's very simple first they've got to
[36:03.360 --> 36:07.600]  take over economically and they've got to take over of the agriculture and
[36:07.600 --> 36:13.120]  they've pretty much done that to the entire Western world and then they
[36:13.120 --> 36:16.880]  bankrupt us economically and they know that we're gonna get angry and try to
[36:16.880 --> 36:21.120]  take our government back and they're there with oppressive mechanisms to keep
[36:21.120 --> 36:26.880]  us in line they have been quietly gearing up a high-tech surveillance system
[36:26.880 --> 36:31.560]  with cameras microphones all fed into the NSA face scanning license plate
[36:31.560 --> 36:35.040]  scanning everything being tracked everywhere you go those of us that would
[36:35.040 --> 36:37.840]  try to warn you they would just call us kooks and nuts even when we have the
[36:37.840 --> 36:40.760]  documents but now you notice they're saying yeah we're listening to you with
[36:40.760 --> 36:43.880]  microphones yeah we're tracking your cell phone yeah there's no need to go
[36:43.880 --> 36:47.240]  through the toll road anymore and put money in we're tracking your your your
[36:47.240 --> 36:52.240]  license plate with license plate readers yeah we're controlling everything you
[36:52.240 --> 36:57.200]  do mm-hmm yeah we took your baby's blood at birth 38 years ago yeah it's
[36:57.200 --> 37:00.600]  independent on database for bio weapons yeah yeah we're gonna start
[37:00.600 --> 37:05.640]  censoring the internet yeah okay we are talking about putting lithium in the
[37:05.640 --> 37:10.440]  water to calm you by the way they're already doing it every major water
[37:10.440 --> 37:14.800]  supply they're adding it to if you if you go pay to have a test done that's
[37:14.800 --> 37:18.240]  one of the hundreds of chemicals they put in you're under chemical warfare
[37:18.240 --> 37:21.520]  attack and they know most of your two-week minded to even admit that
[37:21.520 --> 37:25.480]  you're not gonna go research it because at your core you're a coward at your core
[37:25.480 --> 37:29.760]  you won't admit up to hardcore things that are going on you won't even look
[37:29.760 --> 37:36.240]  into it and that's why they can come out in Fox News and say yeah okay all men
[37:36.240 --> 37:39.880]  have basically ingested things to reduce their fertility and it causes cancer and
[37:39.880 --> 37:44.920]  also causes breast cancer and women remember I read that headline yesterday
[37:44.920 --> 37:48.200]  what you gonna do about it you're gonna do nothing you're gonna sit there and
[37:48.200 --> 37:54.880]  you're gonna die and you're gonna take it I mean why why 99.9% of us are going
[37:54.880 --> 38:00.040]  to be hurt and destroyed by this and it doesn't matter they give you petty power
[38:00.040 --> 38:04.320]  roles in your little sector of the compartmentalized system and so you
[38:04.320 --> 38:13.160]  don't care it's easy to sit there in your squad car laughing at me right now go
[38:13.160 --> 38:18.160]  ahead then go ahead shoot your kids up with mercury and cancer virus filled
[38:18.160 --> 38:22.000]  vaccines go ahead and drink all the tap water you want go ahead and eat all that
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.960]  GMO corn and food go ahead okay but I'm here to speak to the people that do
[38:27.960 --> 38:32.520]  actually care I'm here to speak to the people who aren't on petty power trips
[38:32.520 --> 38:36.800]  and to tell you that I've done the best job I can to warn you and everything we
[38:36.800 --> 38:41.560]  discuss here is real and documented on record and it's so much worse because I
[38:41.560 --> 38:45.680]  it's all interconnected and when you study this hour after hour day after day
[38:45.680 --> 38:51.760]  year after year you get such a clear image of what's going on and then so
[38:51.760 --> 38:54.720]  many times I later get a new government white paper a new university
[38:54.720 --> 38:59.240]  document sometimes written 30 40 50 years ago and it's word-for-word what
[38:59.240 --> 39:03.560]  I've already envisioned their program to be and there they are admitting it all
[39:03.560 --> 39:07.560]  and I know what the next sentence is going to say do you know what that's
[39:07.560 --> 39:15.040]  like and now all over the country we see the military rolling out and they'll
[39:15.040 --> 39:19.160]  first have a PR piece oh we're here in southern Tennessee and the armies out
[39:19.160 --> 39:23.200]  or the Marines are out of the National Guard around with the jaws of life
[39:23.200 --> 39:27.520]  helping cut people out they'll cut to a woman I was stuck in the car and the
[39:27.520 --> 39:31.840]  Marines came and helped me and put me on care flight for my broken leg thank you
[39:31.840 --> 39:39.000]  that's all PR to literally conquer you and occupy you the federal government is
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.720]  occupying you do you know why they're doing that you know why Spendley Butler
[39:42.720 --> 39:45.920]  was sent to third world countries to occupy them when that when they totally
[39:45.920 --> 39:55.160]  destroyed their standard of living when they took over their society I was
[39:55.160 --> 39:59.560]  reading this morning about all these met towns in major cities simultaneously in
[39:59.560 --> 40:04.000]  Australia doubling and tripling their water cost quote privatizing it for
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.320]  their national debt giving your water supply over to private interest that
[40:07.320 --> 40:13.520]  sold you derivatives through fraud and then doubling and tripling prices here
[40:13.520 --> 40:17.120]  in Austin they swore five years ago two years ago that they would never put
[40:17.120 --> 40:20.600]  toll roads on mopac after they'd announced they were going to do it we
[40:20.600 --> 40:23.360]  would go to the city council meetings and they'd say what are you talking about
[40:23.360 --> 40:27.000]  because an election was coming up we're not planning that we said here's your
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.280]  maps here's your press conferences they said your conspiracy theorist that was
[40:31.280 --> 40:37.680]  on the news they called us conspiracy theorist and then they announced today
[40:37.680 --> 40:42.440]  they're going to take mopac in the existing lanes the second most busy
[40:42.440 --> 40:47.720]  bridge in highway in Texas and they're going to put a toll road on it it's
[40:47.720 --> 40:50.760]  against state and federal law they don't care guess who's running it state
[40:50.760 --> 40:55.800]  senator Kirk Watson former Austin mayor who took tens of thousands of private
[40:55.800 --> 40:59.400]  property wouldn't let people build on it took it through adverse possession said
[40:59.400 --> 41:02.760]  it was going to be a nature preserve and turned around and sold it to his buddies
[41:02.760 --> 41:06.720]  and he even owns the private bank that runs all the transactions I mean this
[41:06.720 --> 41:13.760]  guy is a fat degenerate gangster this guy is an L hefe this guy is a sickening
[41:13.760 --> 41:26.160]  joke last year I was still doing my Sunday show out of the KLBJ studios and
[41:26.160 --> 41:31.480]  beyond the Beltway we'd come to town syndicated national show and that guy
[41:31.480 --> 41:34.600]  you know shook my hands and oh I like the show and all of a sudden Kirk Watson
[41:34.600 --> 41:37.240]  walks in this is about two months you know before their show starts my show
[41:37.240 --> 41:40.440]  just ended in the same studio because they were down here visiting and Kirk
[41:40.440 --> 41:45.240]  Watson started shaking hi hi Alex hi and I didn't make a scene I just said hi
[41:45.240 --> 41:53.560]  hi hi Kurt and left but he was shaking and he should be shaking because I know
[41:53.560 --> 41:57.920]  who he is I mean the farmers and ranchers who called me crying the their
[41:57.920 --> 42:02.240]  homes I went to for a decade the city wouldn't let him build on it or sell it
[42:02.240 --> 42:05.160]  but kept their property taxes up and then took it by adverse possession and
[42:05.160 --> 42:08.520]  literally gave those families some of them that had been there since Texas was
[42:08.520 --> 42:15.680]  founded back when Austin was named Waterloo and not Austin after of course
[42:15.680 --> 42:25.860]  the people involved in the founding of the state Stephen F. Austin Colonel
[42:25.860 --> 42:31.840]  Travis all of them Travis County and I just would sit there and I'd watch
[42:31.840 --> 42:36.240]  those those old ranchers and cowboys going in pulling up their old trucks
[42:36.240 --> 42:40.160]  walking in saying look I don't take my property I just want it to be a ranch and
[42:40.160 --> 42:44.160]  Watson saying it's for the salamanders it's for the earth and then I watched
[42:44.160 --> 42:51.160]  him build hotels and strip malls on it and that oh just to be ruled by mafia
[42:51.160 --> 43:01.200]  trash it's so painful and just see him announce it today in a press conference
[43:01.200 --> 43:07.480]  yeah we're gonna put toll roads on the existing road Paul Watson is doing a
[43:07.480 --> 43:11.600]  detailed report on this right now at prisonplanet.com but we have the video
[43:11.600 --> 43:17.000]  posted with a blurb by Matt Ryan this is on infowars.com treason in New
[43:17.000 --> 43:23.280]  York National Guard confiscating guns from citizens see a military kills
[43:23.280 --> 43:28.440]  people and breaks things they got National Guard regular Army they're
[43:28.440 --> 43:31.680]  already turned to the National Guard and a regular Army federalizing it training
[43:31.680 --> 43:36.120]  everywhere to take your guns and in this newscast they start out by how they're
[43:36.120 --> 43:43.680]  fighting drugs and then they segue into oh we're also going after guns and oh
[43:43.680 --> 43:47.280]  look we put you through the x-ray machine and look there's a gun hidden in
[43:47.280 --> 44:02.400]  that trunk this is really going on this is really happening and then if you get
[44:02.400 --> 44:05.920]  upset about it and try to go videotape one of these installations they came out
[44:05.920 --> 44:09.520]  and arrested that middle-class housewife and she had a gun in her trunk and they
[44:09.520 --> 44:12.720]  arrested her and trumped up terrorism charges on her when she wasn't planning
[44:12.720 --> 44:19.160]  anything because you're the enemy and all over the country now the National
[44:19.160 --> 44:24.200]  Guard and Army and Marines are part of knock-and-talk the police come into your
[44:24.200 --> 44:26.840]  door with troops saying we want to come in and look at your guns and if you say
[44:26.840 --> 44:31.200]  no on the news in Boston they pushed their way past without warrants into
[44:31.200 --> 44:40.960]  your house and then I'll say the first amendment's dead this is really happening
[44:40.960 --> 44:44.680]  they really have taken most the old National Guard Armouries and turn them
[44:44.680 --> 44:49.000]  into threat fusion threat integration centers and they have regular Army CIA
[44:49.000 --> 44:53.800]  FBI all this money they give locals in there tracking people's cell phones in
[44:53.800 --> 44:59.440]  real time they got the cameras reading the license plates of the cars they tell
[44:59.440 --> 45:03.240]  the cops in there you're federalized now you get a federal stipend on top of it
[45:03.240 --> 45:08.800]  but don't tell anyone you signed a national security letter now and here's
[45:08.800 --> 45:13.520]  Colonel Drago from Eastern Europe he's going to be your liaison I mean I see
[45:13.520 --> 45:16.520]  that all over the news now we're foreign troops are part of the threat fusion
[45:16.520 --> 45:22.360]  centers in fact here's an article out of prisonplanet.com Paul Joseph Watson we
[45:22.360 --> 45:26.960]  have the 25-minute video posted at prisonplanet.tv feast European troops
[45:26.960 --> 45:30.480]  Poland other countries training to take on the American people on video
[45:30.480 --> 45:34.680]  Polish troops trained to take on American terrorist Hurt Nemo's headline
[45:34.680 --> 45:38.720]  foreign troops training to confiscate guns of Americans and of course here's
[45:38.720 --> 45:45.840]  where you can look at the video from ABC news and also Fox 23 news treason in
[45:45.840 --> 45:50.520]  New York and it goes on National Guard confiscating guns from American
[45:50.520 --> 45:55.520]  citizens this is really going on and they just slowly ease it out there to
[45:55.520 --> 46:03.720]  condition you they tell you oh we're fighting drugs and guns and I told you
[46:03.720 --> 46:06.640]  about that Supreme Court ruling they've now passed a new law in Chicago that
[46:06.640 --> 46:10.400]  yes if we allow you to take the five-hour class and then the background
[46:10.400 --> 46:15.600]  check clears don't have to be a criminal to be denied and then if we decide that
[46:15.600 --> 46:20.320]  maybe you can be registered to have a gun locked up in your house
[46:24.840 --> 46:32.120]  let's go ahead and go to this clip of the military putting people through
[46:32.120 --> 46:37.840]  high-powered x-ray machines that shoot through car metal and I've looked up
[46:37.840 --> 46:41.320]  these systems I mean it is off the charts compared to a chest x-ray of
[46:41.320 --> 46:44.760]  course it's very dangerous to the troops running them they don't care of the troops
[46:44.760 --> 46:50.320]  dietistic ill or cancer five years from now they don't care they they are
[46:50.320 --> 46:54.840]  setting precedence to record your naked bodies in the airports and pump you
[46:54.840 --> 46:58.920]  full of high-powered radiation why not dwarf it now they're saying there's
[46:58.920 --> 47:05.920]  breast bombs breast bombs that al-Qaeda al-CIA is gonna hit us with so now they
[47:05.920 --> 47:11.240]  want chest x-rays at the airport why not the gullible American people let the
[47:11.240 --> 47:14.520]  bank steal trillions and Congress can't find out where it went why not send us
[47:14.520 --> 47:19.160]  through chest x-rays what a good way to give people cancer let's go ahead and
[47:19.160 --> 47:24.280]  play this clip here it is out of a Fox 23 Albany in tonight's Fox focus the
[47:24.280 --> 47:27.600]  New York National Guard has been part of missions around the world but they
[47:27.600 --> 47:31.360]  also have a very important one right here at home it's to keep the drugs off
[47:31.360 --> 47:34.720]  our local streets their technology and training is now free to local police
[47:34.720 --> 47:37.760]  departments and agencies if they want it this box or three is crystal lava
[47:37.760 --> 47:42.200]  explains no one's been turned away if they ask for help
[47:42.440 --> 47:46.840]  dust and desert the images most equate with the New York National Guard on the
[47:46.840 --> 47:51.720]  front lines in the Middle East fighting the war on terror these images are
[47:51.720 --> 47:56.280]  pictures of another fight a fight here at home the war on drugs is an ongoing
[47:56.280 --> 48:01.120]  war our people are committed to this fight and it's a domestic fight to
[48:01.120 --> 48:04.440]  firmly believe in it the New York National Guard's counter drug task force
[48:04.440 --> 48:08.560]  providing not only the people but the equipment law enforcement may need to
[48:08.560 --> 48:13.120]  make drug arrests and seizures we can go right on the scene with this or into a
[48:13.120 --> 48:18.000]  car you can sniff around with it or you can take a swab of a surface and put it
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.920]  into the machine and it'll tell you what it is using ionization counter drugs
[48:21.920 --> 48:26.760]  machines can detect chemicals explosives narcotics on money weapons even
[48:26.760 --> 48:31.240]  fabric a simple swap can tell you if that surface had contact with those
[48:31.240 --> 48:36.960]  substances nothing and a simple sweep of an undercarriage or a scan of a car
[48:36.960 --> 48:40.760]  can help find drugs or weapons being brought into the capital region while
[48:40.760 --> 48:44.520]  the under vehicle inspection system looks for traps or voids where anything
[48:44.520 --> 48:48.960]  could be taped or bolted in the mobile vehicle inspection system takes it one
[48:48.960 --> 48:54.840]  step further basically it's an x-ray and if you zoom in on the trunk portion you
[48:54.840 --> 49:00.120]  can see the rifle that's laid across the bottom there with a warrant a
[49:00.120 --> 49:04.240]  department can request a scam then with a swing of an arm gamma rays outline the
[49:04.240 --> 49:09.600]  car and its skeleton we scan the car and we can give them images of areas that
[49:09.600 --> 49:13.240]  they might want to look at and we'll identify anomalies for the law
[49:13.240 --> 49:18.040]  enforcement so they can check into the car further that way they don't have to
[49:18.040 --> 49:22.520]  rip the car totally apart we can show them spots with points of interest where
[49:22.520 --> 49:25.440]  they might want to check to find something this Connected E police
[49:25.440 --> 49:30.160]  department just one agency that is called in the guard for help in 2009 a
[49:30.160 --> 49:34.360]  driver was arrested his car brought to the station and scanned after an officer
[49:34.360 --> 49:39.120]  smelled marijuana coming from the car no drugs were found but that traffic stop
[49:39.120 --> 49:44.240]  and scan part of an investigation against the suspects our investigation
[49:44.240 --> 49:49.760]  continued on that individual for almost another year and he eventually was
[49:49.760 --> 49:52.760]  taken to custody for drug trafficking charges it's a great resource that we
[49:52.760 --> 49:58.280]  certainly don't have the the money to afford but as a resource available to us
[49:58.280 --> 50:05.120]  at no cost so it's a big help to us and Army helicopters it cuts to that all
[50:05.120 --> 50:13.480]  lies no cost to you that's taxpayer money from the state from the citizens
[50:13.480 --> 50:17.680]  that paid for all that cop so get that through your head you just everything is
[50:17.680 --> 50:21.960]  a lie these people lie so much they don't even know it's a lie it's just a
[50:21.960 --> 50:28.320]  world of baloney and of course remember I can play you clip after clip of Army
[50:28.320 --> 50:34.120]  and Marines growing the opium growing it and then they ship it in here and this
[50:34.120 --> 50:38.400]  guy stands around talking about body scanners now one of them they send the
[50:38.400 --> 50:42.080]  cars through on a conveyor belt the other they set upon a road and the cars
[50:42.080 --> 50:48.560]  drive through it and so I guess they're just gonna fry you with this system so
[50:48.560 --> 50:54.040]  there you have it ladies and gentlemen in your face and this trains the police
[50:54.040 --> 50:59.120]  to bring the citizens back to the threat fusion center run by the Army we'll be

[54:11.040 --> 54:14.920]  Latin America can never get up off its knees that's why much of Asia can't get
[54:14.920 --> 54:20.560]  up off its knees Eastern Europe that's why the dark ages in Western Europe went
[54:20.560 --> 54:26.920]  on for a thousand years because military warlords and now the offshore banks
[54:26.920 --> 54:32.240]  control our military and I could play at the ABC news clips of the police chief
[54:32.240 --> 54:35.320]  saying no one will be allowed to be armed everyone will have to turn their
[54:35.320 --> 54:40.680]  weapons in from New Orleans I could play you countless clips of police forcing
[54:40.680 --> 54:44.760]  their way into houses quote for gun inspections even though guns are legal
[54:44.760 --> 54:49.280]  they just want to come see your guns in Boston in Oakland you've all seen it
[54:49.280 --> 54:54.240]  this is a criminal predatory government and they're announcing they're gonna
[54:54.240 --> 54:59.600]  take a large parts of the police pension funds the cops are gonna love it you
[54:59.600 --> 55:12.800]  know at least their bosses are and it's just totally totally sick and I got a
[55:12.800 --> 55:16.680]  lot of other news coming up I was so shocked by that clip that you just heard
[55:16.680 --> 55:20.920]  in the videos up on info wars.com I never even told you Wayne Madsen's coming up
[55:20.920 --> 55:28.080]  with his intel on Gulf evacuations in about 35 minutes from now and then we
[55:28.080 --> 55:33.560]  got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts with his take on the buildup for war with Iran and
[55:33.560 --> 55:37.440]  then we've got Chris Emery one of the best researchers I know out there on
[55:37.440 --> 55:40.720]  the overall situation with the Oklahoma City bombing of course he lives up
[55:40.720 --> 55:44.040]  there in Oklahoma and he's making a film he's down here interviewing me for it
[55:44.040 --> 55:48.480]  so we'll kill two birds with one stone have him in studio so we've got Wayne
[55:48.480 --> 55:53.240]  Madsen Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and Chris Emery joining us and we will have open
[55:53.240 --> 55:56.520]  phones as well I'm gonna go ahead and give that number out but I would ask you
[55:56.520 --> 56:00.320]  specifically what do you think of them now saying federal felony charges if you
[56:00.320 --> 56:04.680]  try to videotape any of the cleanup efforts or get on the beach down there
[56:04.680 --> 56:08.760]  just no first amendment the news telling you the first amendment quote is dead
[56:08.760 --> 56:12.560]  and they kind of say it with pleasure what do you think of all over the
[56:12.560 --> 56:17.960]  country gun confiscations are now going on with the military running them and
[56:17.960 --> 56:20.960]  they don't care if your rifle or handguns legal they just go ahead and
[56:20.960 --> 56:24.400]  cesspits like New York and Illinois great people up there but their
[56:24.400 --> 56:28.680]  governments are total criminals I remember this connecting me mayor a few
[56:28.680 --> 56:32.120]  months ago said oh I want martial law here I want the army on the streets
[56:32.120 --> 56:38.120]  maybe you heard that in Illinois you heard that in Michigan I've even heard
[56:38.120 --> 56:42.120]  that in California and the feds the feds are there lobbying him to do this and
[56:42.120 --> 56:45.400]  okay well the Marines are gonna help because we don't have the resources
[56:45.400 --> 56:48.760]  locally because all the taxes go to the feds from that USA Today headline
[56:48.760 --> 56:54.440]  yesterday about how massive layoffs at county and cities of firemen and people
[56:54.440 --> 57:00.360]  that build the roads and animal control things you really need but oh the feds
[57:00.360 --> 57:05.320]  are hiring that their pay is going up because it's I mean if you want your
[57:05.320 --> 57:09.720]  hind end wiped soon they're gonna have one fed that puts handcuffs on you and
[57:09.720 --> 57:13.320]  the other that does the wiping I mean I'm sorry but that's what these vampires
[57:13.320 --> 57:17.760]  do what does Ted Bundy do he changed you down what does John Wayne Gacy do he
[57:17.760 --> 57:22.520]  changed you down what did Hitler do he changed you down before he tore your
[57:22.520 --> 57:27.520]  toenails out and pulled your teeth out with pliers that's the analogy you

[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:37.960]  committed publicly. Barack Obama the globalist sworn to establish an
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.800]  North American Union he took the baton from George W. Bush little treasonous
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:46.240]  rat who set up the North American Union in the SPP documents they say they're
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:51.960]  going to form an North American Union through border crises that they would
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.800]  get the American people and Canadians and Mexicans to accept the merger of the
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:04.120]  security apparatus via crises both military immigrant flu they mentioned
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:12.080]  flu and climate change a carbon tax on the highways in the Americas a carbon
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:16.560]  tax to fund the new North American Union government this is all public and I see
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:22.400]  seeing it in say that Rand Paul and Ron Paul are liars and no NAFTA highway plan
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:26.120]  exists even though the mayor of Kansas City's public we have all the federal
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.880]  maps it's what they do is they announce it they build it they start taking over
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:34.960]  the roads and then you come and complain and I saw the city council five years
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:38.280]  ago three years ago two years ago in Austin say we are not putting a toll
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:42.800]  road on the existing road of moped even though they publicly announced it as
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.640]  soon as the opposition mounted they said there's no fight we're not going to do
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:52.040]  that now and they always had it planned for 2011 and the city council went ahead
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.040]  and passed it quietly had a press conference this morning with Senator
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.360]  Kirk Watson the state senator used to be mayor and they said we're going to take
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.560]  your lanes and turn it into a toll road and that's just the way it is you're
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.600]  not even going to be able to get home without it seizing already existing
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:11.440]  roads violating federal and state law that's your North American Union and
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:17.400]  that's why Mexico is collapsing many of these border states are in deep
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:22.440]  trouble Arizona and others sheriffs are calling for help and the federal
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:26.360]  government files suit to throw out Arizona immigration law an act of
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:31.560]  treason an act of incredible treachery in violation of the 9th 10th and 11th
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:35.680]  amendment I shot a key video last night that Aaron is working on right now it
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:39.240]  will be up by the end of the show on info wars dot com prison planet dot com a
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:45.000]  10-minute video that breaks all of this treason down now you dovetail that with
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.280]  the fact that the military the government that runs our military thinks
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.200]  you're so stupid and thinks our military so stupid that they admit an AP
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:59.120]  Reuters Fox CNN and ABC News this is just what I've seen that our troops guard the
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.960]  opium and help grow it and that productions way up to be friends with
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:10.320]  the Afghan people they are shipping the drugs 500 billion a year into the
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:14.840]  United States alone 500 billion comes out of Afghanistan opium some of a
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:19.480]  good split up into Europe there's another 500 billion total in just all the
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.880]  drugs that come into the US so that number similar to the total amount of
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:26.640]  opium coming out but you count the cocaine the heroin all the other drugs
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.040]  that come in illegally it's estimated at 500 billion of course they run it
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:36.080]  there's always CIA aircraft crashing or you know in hurricanes full of cocaine
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.720]  Bloomberg just reported and they and Wells Fargo pled guilty to laundering
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:46.120]  drug money having drug planes of course they do I mean who do you think runs
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.440]  this country they've got to keep it illegal to keep the stinking price up
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.200]  and now to fight drugs they've got checkpoint searching your vehicles with
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.960]  National Guard in Illinois and New York not on the border but the middle of the
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:03.840]  country now I already went over this but I know new stations just joined us I
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:07.320]  just can't get over the magnitude of this we are not allowed to defend our
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.360]  border that's in the Constitution that's what the military supposed to be our
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:14.320]  military isn't allowed to be armed on the border but I have that armed National
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:19.920]  Guard come running from 50 yards away or even more cussing at me it's on video
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.280]  in in-game telling me to turn my bleeping camera off and then I can't
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:28.000]  film them and I stood up to him I screamed at him and called him treasonous
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.920]  traitors and get out of my face and what are you doing armed on the streets
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:35.480]  but see I'm an enemy I'm an American scumbag so they're allowed to have that
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:40.800]  45 against me but as soon as you retire and as soon as you're done doing your
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:45.640]  job you are now the enemy remember that the main training is for you you
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.800]  remember that and who broke it we did I'm not bragging I'm saying we've got
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:57.320]  credibility we know exactly what's going on people always say well this bastard
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.040]  was having people blow the whistle they blow the whistle 15 years ago about the
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.840]  secret DNA they take from babies they blew the whistle decades ago about the
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.880]  government shipping in narcotics it happened in Vietnam it happened in the
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:13.720]  80s after that everything gets the whistle blown on it Barry Jennings was a
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:17.080]  deputy head of New York emergency management we got an interview with him
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:22.000]  for fabled enemies and he called us and said my gosh since you aired that I'm
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.040]  getting threats and he was dead a week later you think this is a game ladies
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:35.240]  and gentlemen this isn't a game these bankers are gonna hurt you bad they're
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:38.320]  already hurting you you like losing your job getting your pay cut you ain't
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.720]  seen nothing yet alright I'm gonna shut up and go to Levi Bill Bobby Brandon I
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:48.200]  want to talk to military and police okay what side are you on what are you
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:52.920]  gonna do about what's happening I mean do you disagree with me I mean it's out
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:57.000]  in the open now Levi and Georgia who's a police officer go ahead Levi thanks for
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.520]  calling how you doing Alex I'm for women and I'm a policeman that sits in the
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:08.480]  patrol car on many nights listen you're rebroadcast and I don't laugh at you I
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.560]  totally agree with what you're saying well I appreciate you and God bless you
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:18.480]  sir and a lot of other officers out there they are a lot of them have got
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.400]  that Gestapo top mentality top me and I'll work with some and it's just a
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:32.580]  constant battle to try to keep from quitting because that that slow creep
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:37.800]  you know military type creep that keeps coming to love the law enforcement but
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:43.480]  the way I look at it is if I don't if I were to quit and get out of the law
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:48.080]  enforcement profession then I'll just be open up my slot for another one is
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:56.280]  Gestapo types so the only thing I do is when I make a stop I try to treat some
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:01.080]  one like I would myself my wife my daughter treated and I try to you know
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:05.280]  provide an example for some of the other ones that are more gun hope you know it
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.200]  right a lot of tickets for stuff that doesn't need to be written for try to
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.080]  pursue you know provide an example for them maybe they'll see the light but
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.400]  Levi it's good to have officers like you out there and I run into a lot of them
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:22.240]  and the directors of this planetary regime worldwide are trying to hire
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:29.240]  people that think it's macho to you know bully people but I understand that
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.600]  you're a dying breed but but there's still a lot of good officers out there
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:37.800]  and a lot of them are are waking up but what is your take on all over the
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:42.440]  country regular army Marines National Guard now aiding the police in the
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:50.400]  quote search for guns well police in the south you know in the south and like
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.720]  some of the other states particularly the northeast region you know they've
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:16:02.000]  got a pretty good pro-gun laws on the book I just see and a lot of the police
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.720]  officers I know are you know NRA members and second members second
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:12.200]  members supporters but you do see a lot of people in it's not only the police that
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.800]  it's the citizens on the street they will call you that they have been
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.280]  brainwashed oh no I'll be clear I mean I want to be clear I was out of Lake
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.760]  Travis this weekend shooting fireworks and I saw billboards demonizing the
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:28.560]  Second Amendment everywhere paid for with taxpayer money and believe me I know
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:35.480]  I see articles every week about people being SWAT teamed because and it's almost
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.560]  always some old man is cleaning their rifle in their garage in their tinker
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.320]  shop and some woman walks by and I'm not bashing women but that's usually who
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.520]  the report says did it and they call the police and the cops have got to
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:52.360]  respond the issue is in places like New York and Illinois they'll go ahead and
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.600]  arrest the old man and say you had 10 guns and 2000 rounds ammo this is an
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:01.480]  arsenal when there's not even a law and so that's what scary is we know what the
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:05.760]  gun grabbers want from New York in Illinois and places where they're in
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.960]  control they want the law abiding citizens guns Levi God bless you good
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.800]  to hear from you let's go get Bill in Montana who's police let's get Bill's
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:22.160]  take then Bobby Brandon Curtin others go ahead Bill oh yeah Alex good sir yeah
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:26.000]  I've been listening to you for about six months and I just wanted to say that you
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.080]  were my second greatest awakening the word of God the King James Bible was the
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:34.840]  first and I was listening to your broadcast the other day I'm a ex cop here
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:39.920]  in Billings Montana and we had a tornado touchdown here about two weeks
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.040]  ago and it's really a rare thing for tornadoes to touch down here and we've
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:48.520]  got the National Guard everywhere we've got checkpoints up and I mean it's just
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:54.760]  unbelievable I've never seen nothing like it it's a training it's all part of
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:18:00.080]  the acclamation well see I'm from Alabama I've lived here in Montana for 10 years
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:04.000]  and I was a cop down there and I got out of that police state 10 years ago I
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.240]  mean here in Montana I guess you could call it the promised land of America
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:13.240]  because there's no taxes and if there is a free place I would say Montana really
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:17.840]  is the last free place that's where people maybe could make a stand but
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:21.120]  they're just everywhere up there I've just never seen nothing like it ever and
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:25.500]  they've got them at checkpoints checking them I mean military armed gunmen no I
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:30.200]  saw that I saw local newscasts and never even got to it I mentioned it last
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:35.280]  week or two weeks ago that it showed men with guns at checkpoints and even I
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:41.800]  got conditioned that that's normal because I didn't even respond to it on
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:47.000]  air because at a subconscious level I'm now becoming acclimated and programmed
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.040]  and the message is Montanans are bad we had a few buildings torn up we better
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:56.800]  set up checkpoints so these Montanans are gonna all rob each other the message
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:03.040]  is we're criminals but what did we see the police predominantly do in New
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:07.160]  Orleans we saw them being the main looters and I'm not saying all police
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:12.760]  are looters the point is who watches the watchers because statistically it is
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.680]  government that becomes abusive because it can get away with it I mean that's
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:23.640]  why we do need some police and some control because history shows if bad
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.480]  people aren't worried about getting caught they're gonna run wild well
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:31.080]  it's the same thing government's not worried about getting caught they're
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:35.960]  running wild no one's watching them anything else Bill well no you're
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.200]  right they're not worried about getting caught and they're just gonna do what
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:42.440]  they tried to do in 1945 or 39 except the one world government you know they
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:45.520]  try to do through Hitler didn't and he moved too fast with the genocide and
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.840]  they pulled it back away from him and blamed it all on him but that's what
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.320]  they're trying to do they're gonna go for broke and you know I've just never
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.240]  seen nothing like it I thought Montana was free and I remember you were running

[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.880]  Hitler moved too fast you actually read the lumbelist white papers they talk
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.480]  about how they've got this creeping scientific dictatorship where they've
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:16.840]  taken decades to slowly militarize the police acclimate the public for the
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:21.840]  police and military to be merged and now roll the police and military out on the
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:26.640]  streets as political officers recording what you say and what you do
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:32.240]  politically and stopping you and asking you questions and having private
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.440]  security people snatch citizens off the street and throw bags over their heads
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:40.800]  and throw them into cars that happened in Pittsburgh and Toronto in the last
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:48.000]  year worldwide the same system done in the same steps admittedly I mean I've
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.680]  got the Rand Corporation documents when they talk about a private police force
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:55.800]  nationwide run by the feds and then a Pentagon police force and they talk about
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:01.400]  it out in the future in a few years it's already there and I remember what
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:06.080]  was it six years ago it's in my film matrix of evil mainstream news with a
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.520]  governor of Wisconsin said oh yes we're here at the threat fusion center we can
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:14.040]  dial in someone's name and track them in real time and listen to them over
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.960]  their phone and it was actually in the news that his handler said governor don't
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:23.120]  tell them that they're tracking you they dial your name in and listen to you no
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.400]  warrant no nothing totally illegal and of course most police haven't been told
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:31.520]  this yet I remember six seven years ago cops laughing at me on the street going
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:35.800]  Alex or the face-scanning cameras or the license plate cameras going to get me I
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:41.080]  was in the coffee room three minutes ago and they had Fox News on live
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:44.640]  reporting that oh all over the country we're tracking your license plates now
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:50.240]  see they're just suddenly announcing everything to you Bobby in Oklahoma
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:58.200]  police then Brandon Curtin others go ahead Bobby Bobby you still there
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:04.600]  hello yes sir go ahead how's it going it's going all right sir welcome thank
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:09.760]  you first thing I'm a cop or I have been a cop in a real small town so I ain't
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.920]  seeing none of the real big stuff that's going on like you say I want to hit on a
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:20.120]  couple things and ask you a question the biggest thing we've seen was a right
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:24.320]  here where I'm at a lot of people have old vehicles and stuff and this city and
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:28.680]  surrounding cities started in ordinance that if your vehicles weren't tagged
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:31.800]  setting in your yard if you're rebuilding them if it was just setting
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:34.280]  because you're not driving it whatever they were going to be able to come on to
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:38.280]  your property until the vehicles off I know the police chief and everyone real
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.960]  good down here I went down there and raised a bunch of crap you know and
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:46.960]  and pretty much got that took care of but uh you talking about billboards a
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:51.160]  little bit ago we got some pretty cool billboards up around here one of them
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:55.040]  says uh government now it's personal we're coming after you all kinds of
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:59.400]  they're on my facebook and everything too if you want to get on there see some
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:03.600]  of them they're pretty neat say that again what do the billboards say now or
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.720]  government now it's personal we're coming after you and these are right
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:14.480]  here on on the highways and everything amazing the other police officers you
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.400]  talk to I mean are they aware that all over the country they're quietly having
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.280]  the military engage in gun confiscations our biggest thing around
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:27.320]  here is I got a lot of real close friends that are cops and that ain't cops
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:31.280]  and I argue with with my buddies up I make them so mad arguing with them
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:36.040]  about this stuff I'm new to listening to you but I've been checking into this
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:40.200]  stuff for a while and I'm getting a lot of arguments but a lot of them are
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:42.400]  starting to see what I'm talking about and seeing I'm not messing around with
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:49.120]  it and saying that I'm right but the question I had is and you might have
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.800]  touched on this before I'm not sure but uh why can't we take the facts and and
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:57.800]  start getting justice done on this through courts or I mean what I agree
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.840]  well a lot of this stuff is getting overturned in court but the federal
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:04.080]  government is so illegitimate they just will continue to do something even
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:09.120]  after it's been ruled unconstitutional and so the country is waking up that's
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:12.880]  and if the country does fully wake up these bankers that have done this are
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:16.640]  going to go to prison and so that's what makes them so dangerous is they're
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:21.840]  holding us hostage with the border being opened they're holding us hostage with
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:26.840]  the financial terrorism where they can destroy our economy at any time they're
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:30.160]  holding us hostage with terrorist groups they've been financing and
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:34.040]  protecting and opening the door to you know they don't just stage terror they
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:38.320]  let terrorists attack us and they've been so they're so dangerous we have to
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:45.200]  really grow up and face just how out of control these people are and how sneaky
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:50.160]  they are and I know I keep harping on that but think about it for 38 years in
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:55.560]  every western nation there has been a secret UN slash military program it's
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:58.560]  run by the UN internationally but the military implements it through
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:04.160]  universities at the national level to take baby's blood for a secret database
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:09.680]  I mean right there this is a creepy sneaky evil group and you use just that
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.800]  one little example that's finally mainstream news and you expand on it
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:18.320]  and you under and then you read the writings of these controllers I mean I
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:21.200]  think the biggest thing to wake people up is you can bring a mainstream articles
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.240]  about GMO sterilizing them the plastic sterilizing them you can bring them John
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:28.440]  P. Holdren White House science are documents where he admits they're
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:33.840]  sterilizing us by design I mean what government individual or cop or school
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:38.480]  teacher or anybody who influences people who wouldn't wake up to that and say
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:42.240]  man this is really an out-of-control group God bless you I appreciate your
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:47.520]  call Bobby Brandon in the military Kurt in the military and others your calls

[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:21.480]  of course he worked for the National Security Agency with the Navy and
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:25.800]  security he's written for some of the biggest publications in the country and
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:30.480]  we're honored to have him joining us because he's got a lot of intel on plans
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:36.160]  for evacuations in the Gulf we now see council on farm relations members and
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:42.360]  others who are in the news like the Washington Post saying that they may
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:47.080]  have an evacuation of 20 million people when that oil comes ashore but I wanted
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:52.240]  to finish up with Brandon and Kurt both in the military and then we'll continue
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:56.560]  into the next hour discussing this headline New York National Guard units
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:03.240]  stand vehicles for gun confiscation so now they're in the in Illinois California
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:09.160]  you name it engaging in gun confiscation actual operations and that
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:15.400]  video from Fox 23 in New York is up on prisonplanet.com right now and Paul
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:19.240]  Joseph Watson's article so going to Brandon and Kurt Brandon I'll give us
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:23.800]  your take on this yes Alex thank you for having me on and thank you for what
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:27.280]  you do I'm gonna talk real quick because I know you don't have much time I was
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:32.160]  stationed in San Diego I've purchased all your DVDs I've showed my command like
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.080]  a lot of people at my command that I work with I've woken a lot of people up
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:39.400]  my apartment complex they're working on people up now I'm stationed in Virginia
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:44.640]  I've woke up my whole entire street and even my cable man I mentioned something
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:49.080]  I just got home he was hooking this stuff up by my uniform on he said thank
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:53.160]  you thank you so much for you in your stature because I was wearing my
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:58.480]  uniform that I talked because most people put them down on conspiracy
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:04.080]  theorist and stuff like that well rationalization but to not defend
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.720]  America but it's now admitted world governments here it's now admitted a
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:11.000]  private banking takeover is happening and they're creating a new global
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.400]  currency but you are saying you have had a good response what percentage of
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:21.000]  people were favorable on the military base actually I got about eight out of
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.200]  ten actually one of the my current co-workers actually called me a terrorist
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:29.160]  themselves and I was like you don't even get it but I adult from the other
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:33.400]  co-worker you're a terrorist because you believe that there's corrupt elements
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:36.760]  in the government that are taking our freedom I mean that that I mean as a
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:39.800]  member of the military you're supposed to defend the Republic from enemies
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:44.320]  foreign and domestic and you're supposed to follow the Constitution yep yep
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:49.120]  and I but uh quick to quick more things that cable guys actually when come by
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:54.320]  this week and burn a couple of your your disc copy a couple of your videos so we
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:36:00.040]  can show it to his family and the last one part of the the oil response came
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:03.480]  and we're gearing up we're leaving next week to the Gulf and a couple other
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:08.560]  guys are leaving in a couple weeks to the Gulf where they they said they're
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:14.480]  gonna issue us desert uniforms desert cammy uniforms that's kind of dumb
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:18.320]  since we all have uniforms for some reason they're gonna do that I asked
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:25.480]  about respirators and they said that was no need so I'm gonna finish up with
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.600]  this not only the government has boots on the ground but you got boots on the
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:32.760]  ground to Alex and I'll definitely keep you guys informed and update absolutely
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:37.640]  wonderful information Brandon I mean very powerful information we have so
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:43.640]  many military people calling us and snipers intelligence officers engineers
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:48.440]  which makes sense engineers being sent to the Gulf regular army and they're
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:52.640]  now talking about possible evacuation we're talking to Wayne Madsen here in
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:58.800]  just a moment about that but yeah they're on record BP is on record saying no
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:03.440]  respirators are needed there's no toxic fumes because if they admit there's
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:07.640]  toxic fumes they would then be liable everyone knows there's toxic fumes the
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:11.920]  average life expectancy of Exxon Valde workers of 51 years the government
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.120]  admits that from the dioxin and toxins and benzene and the oil and the
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:19.920]  dispersants and so a lot of these people have already died or they're in the
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:23.560]  hospital and that's why they're saying nobody can videotape nobody can talk to
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:29.880]  these workers they send them to BP hospitals BP clinics I mean this is one
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:33.840]  hell of a cover-up we're going to Wayne Madsen to get his inside scoop on that
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:37.120]  and just a moment finishing up with Kurt and we're going right to Wayne Kurt in
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:43.720]  Deutschland who's in the army welcome Kurt hello sir hello go ahead real quick
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.080]  I just wanted to tell you with all the chemicals you talk about on your show I
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:52.560]  do a lot of research on them and one of the things I've been using to sort of
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:56.160]  open people's eyes a little bit when they don't believe me is the material
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:01.440]  safety data sheets all these chemicals any chemical made has material safety
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:04.840]  data sheets made by the companies that make them all that's a great point so
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:08.000]  for sodium fluoride you show them the skull and crossbones the organ failure
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.480]  the sterilization for the silicone they put in chicken McNuggets you can show
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:17.040]  on the data sheet on that how how deadly it is for all these chemicals they put
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:20.840]  in our food and water you can you can show on the documents that's a great
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:25.120]  way to do it yeah and then I think the funniest thing is the reaction you get
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:27.920]  because first they start laughing when you start telling them yes sodium fluoride
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:31.360]  poisonous they're laughing you so I come back with the material safety data sheet
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:37.440]  and put on the table like it's poisonous there you go but uh and I just wanted to
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:41.800]  say that there is a lot of people waking up in the military I'm in the army I'm
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:47.240]  stationed in Ilisheim Germany and I have the show on while I'm at work and I
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:50.920]  talked to a lot of people about it and everybody I talked to says that they're
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:56.120]  not gonna they're not gonna take guns from American citizens from unarmed
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:01.560]  civilians it's just not gonna happen well I know I'm joining I know most the
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:05.880]  military police I talked to say that the problem is we saw what happened in
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:10.200]  Katrina most of them did follow the orders so individually they're saying
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.600]  no but in that group think they're following orders that's why we need to
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.520]  have this debate and discussion now but what do you think about this huge
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:22.680]  long-term covert operation to acclimate not just the troops and the police but
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:27.120]  the public as well to accept this I mean this is 23 years old I mean that's
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:32.280]  how far back we can prove it a huge covert gun confiscation preparation
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:37.760]  program I mean that's creepy I just don't understand how people I mean it's
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:40.880]  going on all around you that I try to tell people that just look around you
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.440]  when I'm talking to people when I call the states back home I'm trying to tell
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:47.680]  them like if you don't believe me just look around you read the news like read
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.040]  anything how can you not see this happening right in front of you God
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:54.520]  bless you card good to hear from me here's an example I was driving to my
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:00.920]  parents this weekend with my children and I was on 360 and I looked over at the
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:07.880]  fire department and I saw military uniforms with police and with no no no
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:11.680]  that was about a month ago that I saw the military and the police this was out
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:17.520]  by Lake Travis this weekend I saw the again I'm just having a flashback to
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:22.440]  this I saw the fire department military and police all running around doing some
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:25.960]  hazmat drill and I didn't have time to pull over and even look at it because I
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:29.680]  had that limited time with my family but that's just an example how it's just
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.400]  going on everywhere and it seems reasonable to have the military training
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:37.720]  with police but then they always have it first overdoing hazmat drills and the
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:43.400]  next we're gonna help you get the guns and by the way I have from 1998 the
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:48.200]  internal army documents from Fort Hood that are in my film police state to the
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:53.360]  takeover where they admit we are here for bomb disposal and for anti-fire arms
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:57.680]  operations so this has been going on quietly in the background now it's
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:01.440]  coming to the fore because they know it's almost impossible to defeat
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:08.280]  something that slowly infiltrates that slowly takes over all right Wayne
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:13.200]  Madsen of Wayne Madsen report is our guest Wayne's always given us really
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:17.120]  good intel and we just heard a military man say that he's been deployed from
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:23.440]  Virginia regular army down to the Gulf and we now see the Washington Post
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:28.880]  talking about 20 million evacuated Wayne Madsen from your intelligence agency
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.400]  sources in DC and from your sources there at the press club what's the inside
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:39.440]  scoop well I reported back in May that there were plans to evacuate millions
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:43.720]  of people first the first people to be evacuated would be those who have
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:49.480]  respiratory problems I know several who are now seeing BP doctors who are
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:54.120]  saying there's a number of people coming into these BP medical facilities the
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:59.520]  complaining of respiratory ailments and some have been diagnosed with what's
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.480]  known as chemical pneumonia I know one person who actually has been diagnosed
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:10.280]  with that by BP and now people's pets are beginning to suffer from the same
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:16.560]  ailments so we have basically BP engaged in a huge PR operation it hired
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:21.960]  every big time PR firm here and in Washington and I'm surprised that the
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:26.800]  Washington Post is even thinking at evacuations because one of the problems
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.720]  we're seeing with the press is that their editors are contacting their legal
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:36.960]  department because these companies that own the media may have vested interest
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.920]  with BP or Halliburton or these other companies involved in this oil disaster
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.440]  and and I think that's a problem that's why next week I'm going to the Gulf
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:51.000]  because I want to see for myself what's going on down there there's been
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.040]  reports of journalists and photojournalists being arrested so I'm
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:43:01.280]  going down there I'll be in and I can be in parish I'll go over to Alabama
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:05.840]  Mississippi and Pensacola Beach to see firsthand what's going on and I will
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:13.600]  document with photos and interviews and whatnot what I find out Wayne expanding
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:18.080]  on that because you did over a month and a half ago you were one of the first
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:21.640]  people that I saw start talking about how they were going to evacuate the Gulf
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:27.520]  I want to flesh that out and talk more about what your sources there in DC are
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:32.360]  telling you but specifically all the evidence I have says that this was
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:36.440]  deliberately blown that they gave orders to Anadarko and Halliburton that
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:41.200]  they knew would cause the well to come in early and to spill and that it is a
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:48.680]  pretext to sell the carbon tax that BP and Enron founded with Al Gore back in
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:52.480]  the mid 1990s because their whole program is stalled and it was meant to be a
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:44:00.920]  political distraction for the upcoming attack on Iran and now you see 70 plus
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:07.200]  almost 80 days it will be 80 days tomorrow of them blocking any type of
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:11.640]  aid or relief or the skimmerships or the counties of the cities putting up
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:16.400]  berms or jetties that's still ongoing and so from every angle I look at this
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:21.240]  this is a huge diversion it doesn't matter if it destroys Obama politically
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:27.440]  the establishment already made the decision that that his messianic image
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:30.360]  had been destroyed and so they were going to basically blame everything on
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:36.840]  him but give us your take on that well I have a story up today the company that
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:41.760]  was hired by BP to do the third party was called mud logging this is where
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:48.440]  they analyze all the sediment and rock material incrementally coming up and
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:56.120]  this was the deepest borehole ever sunk this was at 35,055 feet they knew
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:01.920]  that what kind of oil was down there I agree that this was to tie the US over
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:06.440]  in the event of a war with Iran we would have enough oil to last this country
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:12.080]  for up to eight months and I think that it was a political decision to keep
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:17.040]  drilling the slumber jay engineers said what this thing is getting ready to go
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:21.840]  there's an internal slumber jay document that shows that their crew was out there
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:28.240]  and and left that platform the deep water horizon a little after nine o'clock in
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:33.360]  the morning and that and that that's of course the explosion was later on that
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:39.000]  evening so we know this from documented evidence that we have a cost card
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.200]  report but I mean we even see conflicting how it was the 30,000 foot
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:46.120]  well or it was 18,000 feet well we've seen a lot of different conflicting
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:51.800]  information well you know it's odd what one of the sources that I'm I'm getting
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:56.160]  is from the FEMA the federal emergency management agency whoever thought after
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:01.200]  what they did with Katrina that they would be you know revealing inside
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:08.320]  information but they have been bypassed by the Coast Guard and BP FEMA that you
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:11.120]  know the rightful protectors they are part of the Department of Homeland
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:15.240]  Security but there's many people there who are absolutely upset that they're
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:21.320]  not being included in the first of all the reaction to the disaster itself
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:28.320]  and and all these all these operations to mitigate the effects of the
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:34.320]  disaster yeah where does we go I mean where does BP get the authority to tell
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:38.280]  reporters they can't videotape and now we have the Coast Guard saying federal
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:43.240]  felonies if you even try to videotape so they are acting very suspicious oh yeah
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:47.440]  well the authority comes from president Obama I mean he he put this guy
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:51.720]  that Alan the commandant of the Coast Guard in charge as a national incident
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:56.600]  commander his relationship with BP is very close I heard a rumor that even
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:01.520]  before the disaster he was going to get a job with BP after he retired now he's
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:06.280]  still with me you know he's Obama's brownie except I think he's more insidious
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:10.400]  brownie with a total incompetence that Alan knows exactly what he's doing by
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:17.200]  showing for BP he's trying to limit their exposure and and basically his
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:22.160]  Coast Guard personnel and BP's hired security people which are a lot of them
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:26.120]  are lacking and I also reported that some of the people chasing people away
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:31.880]  from the beaches are off-duty Alabama troopers that in that state so we have
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:37.920]  basically BP is running the show and and and I think this can be laid right to
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:43.960]  the doorstep of the White House the the media I had a report up yesterday that
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:49.440]  in the Pensacola area media comm the cable provider has blocked out the five
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:54.840]  530 local newscasts of the ABC and CBS affiliate because they're doing a lot of
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:48:02.280]  in-depth reporting and also blocking out the 6 p.m. national CBS and ABC news
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:06.840]  reports from the people in Pensacola people are getting a black screen when
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:11.000]  they try to tune into the local affiliates and the national networks
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:17.960]  and and I think this goes to show the extent of the censorship going on as
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:22.360]  far as this disaster Wayne Madsen I think they have a name for this this is
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:27.440]  called martial law full spectrum dominance and to have CNN reporting the
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:33.320]  first amendment is now dead in the Gulf and to have BP up to 10 miles in having
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:37.640]  police arresting reporters that just ask questions that's been on the news I
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:44.680]  mean this is martial law in America and the big issue here is what happens when
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:51.760]  that 150 million plus gallons of oil now being driven towards the shore by the
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:55.800]  tropical storms forming in the Gulf what happens when a lot of that comes to
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:01.200]  shore we know there's already respiratory problems we know 51 is the
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:06.760]  average life expectancy for exon Valdez workers from the off-gassing and toxins
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:11.320]  we know the dispersants are much worse than the oil itself we know they're so
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:15.320]  deadly they even eat the holes of boats and BP isn't allowing their workers to
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:25.120]  wear respirators I mean this is this is unbelievable in many respects because
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:32.240]  it's more widespread than Katrina it's affecting now every every Gulf state of
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:36.320]  course and every time there's a terrible or a target where they call these things
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:41.040]  that wash up the initial response is well it's from a passenger ship we've seen
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:45.240]  this time and time again with the Florida keys the dry tortugas now the Texas
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:50.720]  beaches and this is all part of an information off a pentagon grade
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:56.640]  influence operation information warfare if you will to limit the news that's
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:00.840]  coming out of the Gulf and you know it's just a shame that there's not more
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:06.280]  national media descending on the Gulf I'm not I'm going to do it next week I
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:10.080]  don't care if they arrest me or not that's you know I think we've got the
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:14.720]  First Amendment I haven't heard that Mr. Obama has abrogated it yet but he
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:17.960]  doesn't have the authority to do that well they're saying in the Associated
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:23.960]  Press and the San Francisco Chronicle that it's a federal felony punishable
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:29.240]  by a decade in jail if you videotape any of their operations or try to talk to
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:34.880]  anyone and so this is the new gulag and where'd Wayne Madsen go well he tried to
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:38.440]  be a reporter and you don't do that in the new Soviet America I want to talk
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:42.680]  to you about your sources your take on what's going to happen when that oil
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:46.280]  starts really coming ashore because we've only seen the tip of the iceberg
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:51.080]  and speaking of psyops the way the media spinning it that we've got to buy BP
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:55.840]  shares we've got to shop at BP and buy their gas or they'll go bankrupt and
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:59.960]  can't pay for the emergency and then Obama is against BP when they bankrolled
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:04.720]  him so you think the mass of Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:10.600]  think again benzene a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen is
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:14.680]  now airborne traveling hundreds even thousands of miles inland whether you
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:18.400]  lived in the Gulf or not benzene and other volatile organic compounds could
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:22.380]  cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home Noah the National

[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:41.560]  Madson the Wayne Madson report.com okay Wayne specifically what's the word on
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:48.440]  what they're planning to do when the oil starts coming ashore a and b why would
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:54.360]  Obama block the counties and states from protecting themselves with berms and
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:56:00.400]  jetties? Well I think what's going to happen if we start seeing these tropical
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:06.360]  storm hurricanes picking up this toxic soup in the Gulf and dumping it far
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:10.840]  inland we're going to see the you know we're going to see the poisoning of the
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:15.920]  freshwater supplies inland the streams the creeks the reservoirs the lakes
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:21.760]  etc and that's going to extend this disaster even further as far as Obama I
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:26.320]  think Obama is not acting as president in the United States he's taking his
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:32.360]  orders from BP and we had the corner room in here everybody was in the media
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:36.440]  phoning over her you know BP stands for British Petroleum I thought maybe I
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:43.160]  missed it but I saw no protesters in New York where she visited it was fine you
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:48.800]  know protesting the fact that one of her big companies from her nation has
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:53.160]  basically she's one of the biggest she's one of the biggest shareholders she's a
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:58.200]  eugenicist she's a globalist she's a carbon tax monster who promotes all this
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:03.200]  tearing everyone's fawning over some demonic inbred old woman that our
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:08.520]  ancestors fought a war against I mean it's a disgusting joke and that's a
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:13.520]  good point that you rave about Queen Elizabeth the second I mean what a what
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:19.960]  a fraud so so you were one of the first to say evacuations would happen or that
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:23.360]  was the info you were getting now we do see the media starting to promote it so
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:27.720]  again what is Halliburton and BP and others and and all these companies going
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:31.920]  to do as that oil comes in well I think we're going to see the censorship and the
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:39.200]  arts and continue we'll get some reports obviously from the blockade but I would
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:44.680]  note that my report on the evacuations was picked up by some websites and just
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:48.800]  in the last week they printed retractions obviously they got called by
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:57.600]  you know BP's big PR bigwigs and told to to retract or at least amend the
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.480]  original story there's what BP is doing was trying to limit the exposure of this
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:07.080]  disaster and now we have them shopping around for investment money in places
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:11.240]  like Libya they're going to go on to Kentucky to get bailed out and and
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:16.560]  other countries so I think that's what we're doing there we're aware of the
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:21.040]  environmental protection agency this Lisa Jackson came out of New York who's
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:26.040]  the administrator we've seen nothing from the EPA so the Coast Guard the EPA
[01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:31.160]  all very violent or competitive well this is globalism this is corporate
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:35.240]  governance back in 70 seconds five more minutes with Wayne Madsen then Dr. Paul

[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:36.200]  look back at that government bombing operation used to demonize
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:40.720]  conservatives and patriots as they gear up to stage more terror attacks on
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:45.640]  themselves as a pretext to attack the American people meanwhile a New York
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:51.000]  National Guard units scan vehicles for gun confiscation in the capital of New
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:57.720]  York Albany amazing report out of Fox News news 23 we have a detailed breakdown
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:01.280]  of the history of this and how they're slowly acclimating people for full bore
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:05.480]  martial law but now it's really reaching the boiling point at prison
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:11.560]  planet.com we got four minutes left with Wayne Madsen Wayne other tidbits here
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:19.080]  because I mean the statistics of the 51 year life expectancy of Exxon Valdez
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:23.240]  workers and the statistics I saw the government admits it was the dispersants
[02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:26.720]  they believe that were the main thing that really caused the autoimmune
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:30.360]  diseases and cancers to go off the charts they're using a lot more of this
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:35.240]  stuff this time than they did in in in Alaska and a lot more populated areas how
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:40.120]  does BP think they're gonna get away with this and well we're gonna buy judges
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:45.160]  and we already see them judge shopping for these several suits we see how they
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:49.720]  try to get these cases bundled put them on to put them under Wayne Hughes and
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:54.040]  Houston who has a conflict of interest he could take some money from the oil
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:58.240]  industry Martin Feldman the one in New Orleans who overturned the moratorium on
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:02.640]  drilling he's got ties to the oil industry and Mark Fuller in Montgomery
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:08.800]  Alabama is a part owner of Ocean Earring International which is
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:14.480]  supplying those deep submersible robots that we've seen taking the photos of the
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:19.800]  of the oil gusher in the Gulf what people need to do is put pressure on their
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:24.720]  members of Congress to have these three guys impeached or at least force them
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:30.400]  to be forced them to recuse themselves if they're impeached just Obama might try
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:34.800]  to put another pro oil guy in their place but fill us to that don't take any
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:39.000]  action make them go to make them go to other judges who don't who don't have
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.560]  any time to the oil industry at least these three judges and probably more
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:47.880]  are tied to the oil industry and they need to be they need to be removed
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:53.160]  recused or impeached all right here's my last question on that issue we know
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:58.680]  Obama is one of the main minions of BP we know Rahm Emanuel had his apartment
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:02.720]  for many years paid for illegally that's coming out in the Bogovitch trial
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:10.000]  there in DC where you live we know that they set up cap and trade with Enron we
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:15.120]  know this is a top New World Order globalist organization and then we have
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:19.400]  the media acting like Obama has his foot on their neck is that part of the PR
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:24.640]  ruse to try to you know not have it come out that Obama is basically on the
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:28.800]  payroll well yeah of course Obama entertain the BP executives of the
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:34.920]  White House and an announcer with his $20 billion cap on on damages and
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:39.640]  that's nowhere near to what this is going to cost I think in terms of over
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:44.080]  a trillion dollars maybe closer to two trillion dollars but what price can you
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:50.480]  put on the Gulf of Mexico and the other oceans that could be affected by this
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:54.560]  this disaster and now they say it may just go on forever now they're not even
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:58.960]  trying to talk about fixing it it's just this is the way it is now and well
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:03.040]  that's right and the people who are complacent up here it's a matter of time
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:08.160]  before this gets into the chest of pink the largest estuary in North America and
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:12.440]  we're going to see that they're already taking a emergency pursuit of making
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:16.960]  emergency plans in North Carolina when this is the outer banks so this is not
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:20.120]  going to be limited to the Gulf of Mexico and when it hits the grand banks
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:24.840]  off Newfoundland the richest fishing grounds that North America and Europe
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:29.760]  depend on then we're going to see you know basically you can just kiss off
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:35.720]  seafood as a as a staple well that's the issue as they say there's probably the
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:41.120]  two billion gallons in that one hole alone and it does go out around Florida
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:44.120]  and up into the grand banks and if it leaves the East Coast it goes up there
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:52.160]  into the Arctic and it's just horrible Wayne Madsen thanks for coming on with
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:55.840]  us we appreciate how your time with us we'll talk to you again soon thank you

[02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:03.560]  Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:07.520]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:11.760]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:16.040]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:20.400]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:24.480]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:29.040]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:33.160]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:37.120]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:40.960]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:43.680]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:49.640]  Science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:54.320]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to

[02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:09.040]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:16.320]  for the balance of the hour dr. Paul Crank Roberts former Wall Street Journal
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:20.560]  editor the head of policy department of Treasury the father of ergonomics
[02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:24.040]  syndicated columnist and best-selling author is our guest to talk about a
[02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:29.040]  host of issues but you know the main one is the gear up for the attack on Iran
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:34.720]  more and more it's being green-lighted by the Israelis the US government and a
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:39.360]  when he thinks it may happen how it can be stopped but what will happen if they
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:43.400]  hit Iran from his research but before I do that I mentioned earlier at the end
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:49.560]  of the last hour this video talking about solutions the secret of Oz by the
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:54.480]  maker of the Money Masters and we have that film available as well by Bill
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:57.760]  Still he's been all over the world Iceland you name it where they're
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:01.080]  fighting back against these people and this has some great solutions you know
[02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:05.000]  not a gold back currency because the bankers pretty much dominate that but
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.520]  a government-controlled fiat system and basically how to bring these people to
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:14.160]  justice the secret of Oz solutions for a broken economy very important film we
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:20.480]  sold out of this last week we just got more in today so get your orders in for
[02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:24.960]  the secret of Oz we have a new special running for a limited time where you can
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:31.400]  order the new films we produced police state for the rise of FEMA and of course
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:35.680]  Invisible Empire and get a copy of in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:41.240]  free we have several other choices you can make on info wars.com you can look
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:45.400]  for the banners up on the site to take you to the subsection of the shopping

[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:52.920]  gives you a tool to wake people up and to inform yourself to a higher level but
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:57.640]  also supports this transmission and the important work we're doing here and I
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:01.720]  couldn't do it without all of you out there and speaking of support prison
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:07.200]  planet TV we simulcast the least part of the radio show starting next week I'm
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:11.880]  going to simulcast the entire radio show from there on out via streaming video
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:16.920]  with the four camera shooting here at prison planet TV and we put an
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:22.600]  exclusive prison planet TV video up where I sent my guys Rob do and Jason
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:27.200]  Douglas to Chicago where they let them into the drills taking over sports
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:31.600]  stadiums using them as FEMA camps Polish troops training to quote take on
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:36.680]  American terrorist and for gun confiscation that 25-minute video is up
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:41.000]  on prison planet TV right now for members and we have this report out
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:48.800]  from Fox 23 in Albany New York New York National Guard unit scan vehicles for
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:52.160]  gun confiscations they drive you through if they find a gun they take you to
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:57.520]  jail I mean this is on the news now so the slow creeping martial law is just
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:02.600]  intensifying and and before we get into the economy and the oil spill and the
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:06.880]  Iran situation because as Roberts predicted a few years ago when governments
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:10.760]  and banks get in trouble they launch new wars let me ask him about the police
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:15.320]  state because he he writes about that Dr. Roberts good to have you back with us
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:20.240]  glad to be with you Alex there he is joining us via video Skype you've
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:24.080]  written a lot about the police state but but now we have the military more and
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:29.120]  more on the streets of America really violating posse commentatus what's
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:35.680]  your take on that well I suppose Alex they just want to make sure that we
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:40.720]  forget about the Constitution and our rights I think they they realize that
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:47.360]  they've created a mess for us both internationally and and domestically
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:53.480]  both militarily and economically and they want to be sure that the people
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:59.720]  just sort of give up and accept their fate
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:07.040]  what do you think the American people's response to this should be well I think
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:12.200]  they should get very angry and be very well armed and very well organized you
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:15.960]  know one of the problems Alex as you know very well is that so many Americans
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:22.800]  get confused about what patriotism is and they so many of them think that being
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:27.440]  patriotic means supporting the government they don't understand that it means
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:33.120]  supporting the Constitution and that the government is always an enemy of the
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:39.000]  Constitution and so the people I think they're going to have to suffer quite a
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:45.640]  bit before the before they ever wake up and realize that the founding fathers
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:53.800]  were right your worst enemy is always your government because it alone has
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:13:00.440]  the power to to break you and and control you so I think we're a long way
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:08.560]  from the vast majority of American people coming to that realization well I
[02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:12.560]  think you're absolutely right people are gonna have to get hurt a lot worse and
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:17.080]  they've already been abused and well I tell you I read Bloomberg reporting 46
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:20.960]  states are on the verge of going bankrupt federal regulators are quote
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:25.960]  ordering outside of law for large pension fund managers to quote invest in
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:33.880]  failed banks suddenly CNBC reports that the graphs mirror the 1929 1933
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:37.720]  depression graph the New York Times says third depression the London
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:42.320]  Telegraph says depression that all the numbers show depression this this is
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:46.280]  pretty scary to have the mainstream media now going from denying we were even in
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:52.200]  a recession to saying that we may be in a depression yes it is kind of funny
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:55.720]  isn't it I mean you know these things it was just the other day that we had
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:03.200]  recovery recovery recovery as you know I've said for some time that there's no
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:10.680]  recovery because there's nothing left to recover keep in mind that our pensions
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:18.520]  or what remains of them are in great danger now because if we do continue
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:24.280]  into a depression the government's budget deficit will become huge I mean
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:31.640]  it's already almost half of the current operating budget so if you're having to
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:38.240]  borrow half of your current operating budget you can see what happens if the
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:44.800]  economy gets worse and the tax revenues will fall off more so what I suspect they
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:49.640]  will do Alex they will tell all the pension fund managers the money managers
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:54.920]  that they have to purchase government bonds that they have to finance the
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:15:01.400]  government by purchasing the transition bonds now of course with the the
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:06.160]  situation being as bad as it is the bonds won't be worth very much and so
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:12.120]  that's how they will finish off our pensions alternatively they will simply
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:17.480]  say well we're gonna have a capital leaving on your pensions we're gonna
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:21.960]  take certain percentage of it to make up for the fact that it's been accumulating
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:27.960]  tax-free and and then they will use that money to finance the government you know
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:33.520]  for a while I mean it that money runs out they can only spend it once so people
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:39.480]  don't really quite know how bad it's going to be and you can see that all
[02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:45.280]  the stimulus programs despite the massive size have failed to alleviate the
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:50.920]  unemployment and apparently have failed to stop the downward
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:56.000]  percent of the economy so if you have the largest budget deficit in history in
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:03.240]  the lowest interest rates and they can't stop an economic downturn then
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:12.160]  you don't really have any policy left to use so I think we're headed into a very
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:19.720]  serious situation that will as I've said many times undermine the dollar as the
[02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:26.640]  reserve currency and therefore undermine our ability to import which will
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:31.520]  affect a whole range of product availability well sir that brings me to
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:38.800]  my next question we have of course the New York Times CNN and others last week
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:43.400]  coming out and saying oh the UN says get rid of the dollars the world reserve
[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:48.760]  currency have a SDR special drawing rights and that will still have the
[02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:52.560]  currencies of the world but we're gonna devalue those and then all that will be
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:57.600]  left is this new bank-to-bank thing backed up by the carbon tax and that it
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:01.560]  will be basically a global government run by private banks so this is out in
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:06.240]  the open and then it's clear that's why they're wrecking things by design is to
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:12.800]  force us on to the wreckage of our society that will basically be this new
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:16.200]  global government and you know like you said last time when you were on this
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:20.320]  about a month ago that clearly the government is now trying to destroy
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:27.000]  America by design can you speak to the SDR this move to a new level of the
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:38.200]  Ponzi scheme well Alex the SDR is a basket of currencies it's made up of
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:42.640]  other currencies including the dollar in fact the dollar is the largest component
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:50.360]  of the SDR so I think when when China and Russia and brought that up they were
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:58.680]  simply trying to point out that the United States was in enough financial
[02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:04.200]  difficulty that maybe the puppet states in Europe would distance themselves a
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:10.040]  little bit and stop supporting such an aggressive American policy in the rest
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:15.800]  of the world and not only toward Iran but it's also toward Russia you know we
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:23.200]  have Hillary Clinton and Georgia the other day the Buick and Russia for
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:31.280]  occupying Georgia but they don't occupy Georgia so I think that that is not meant
[02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:37.240]  as a as a serious solution to the problem and I think when when the UN
[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:45.440]  report raises it it's really meant to call attention to the fact that there
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:51.400]  isn't a stable dollar and that the whole world relies on the dollar as reserve
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:58.440]  currency and that the behavior of the United States government running up the
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:04.840]  massive budget deficits with wars they came forward with bank bailouts they
[02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:10.960]  came forward and running up massive trade deficits by offshoring the industry and
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:19.120]  the professional service jobs that the I think it's directed at calling
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:24.840]  attention to the fact that American leadership is not long for this world
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:32.880]  but it's run out because the resource base for it has run out doctor when we
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:37.680]  come back let's talk about how you see this unfolding then and how an attack on
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:42.480]  Iran factors in and and why the establishment seems to think in their
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:47.160]  own writings that a large global war as the ran corporation said two years ago
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:55.000]  would somehow prop up the Anglo-American Dutch slash Israeli alliance and and
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.240]  what you see happening in the US economy well they ride back ladies and
[02:19:58.240 --> 02:20:03.400]  gentlemen stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:07.840]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:11.880]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:15.800]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:19.800]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:24.360]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:28.360]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:32.200]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:35.800]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:40.120]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:43.320]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:46.960]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[02:20:57.320 --> 02:21:03.800]  1-877-327-0365 originally we the people have entrusted government to be the
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:08.480]  guardians of currency to ensure purity content weights and measures of gold
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:12.600]  and silver coins citizens would use for commerce this reinstalled confidence
[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:17.720]  after the demise of the fiat continental system wisdom being lost with time the
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:21.360]  government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with
[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:25.360]  private business creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country
[02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:29.800]  ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:33.000]  is not accountable to our elected government but has also caused the
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:37.080]  dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value now foreign governments
[02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:41.280]  are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency hi this

[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:21.240]  know at 11 o'clock at night reading a book about to turn the light out and go
[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:26.680]  to bed it just really dawns on me we really do have a bunch of Ponzi scheme
[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:30.960]  crooks that wrecked the most wealthy powerful wonderful nation in history
[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:36.000]  and we've gone from the apple of the world's eye the light of liberty to the
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:40.000]  country that promotes all these illegal wars we've just in basically invaded
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:45.440]  Costa Rica with 44 ships it's got their country in an uproar we were a nation
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:50.600]  that promotes torture secret arrest and it's only getting worse Dr. Roberts
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:55.800]  as we went to break I threw out the question how do you see this unfolding
[02:24:55.800 --> 02:25:02.760]  and how does an attack on Iran play into it from your historical research well
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:09.080]  Alex they want to attack Iran for several reasons and I suppose the most
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:16.520]  important is this ideology of American hegemony and this is the trouble with
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:21.920]  with the one world stuff you know it's if the Americans talk about one world
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:29.480]  what they mean is an American world and and so if you look at the Middle East
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:34.040]  what's the remaining independent countries that is what countries are not
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:41.720]  American puppet states and we have only Iran and Syria now the reasoning I'm told
[02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:47.240]  from people that I still know in Washington is that Syria they can
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:54.200]  ignore because if they knock off Iran Syria will simply voluntarily become an
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:26:01.040]  American puppet state and so they're they're after Iran they would love to have
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:08.040]  one of their color revolutions and get rid of it without military means but
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:14.840]  they they want to get rid of it at any cost and you can see that's the reason
[02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:21.480]  for all the gears of demonization and lies and most recently when the United
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:30.480]  States somehow got the Security Council of the UN to go along the sanctions what
[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:35.440]  did the Americans do the minute they got the UN sanctions Washington then added
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:40.800]  their own unilateral sanctions which Ron Paul has pointed out on the House
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:44.200]  floor and he's read the international law and our national law that's an act of
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:49.760]  war and now in Germany they're not fueling Iranian aircraft I mean this
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:56.120]  is insane yes and but you see what what Washington is doing it's using the UN
[02:26:56.120 --> 02:27:02.560]  sanctions as a basis for its own the Russians said you've double-crossed us
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:08.960]  and and the media will never differentiate between the UN sanctions
[02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:13.200]  which are not so severe and the American sanctions that have been added to them
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:20.920]  and the ships that we have dispatched allegedly to stop Iranian ships on the
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:28.440]  Hassees and inspect the cargoes and another act of war they're not going to
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:35.160]  simply be enforcing the UN sanctions so we've double-crossed the Security
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:41.520]  Council again and we're hoping that some sort of instant will come out of this so
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:51.640]  that we can have some justification some I don't know what happened to the so we
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:56.960]  can have some kind of a justification for for the attack on the ramp now if you
[02:27:56.960 --> 02:28:05.560]  go back to Bush's speech was January 29 2002 when he says there's this axis of
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:12.440]  evil there's Iran Iraq in North Korea and he sort of brought together these
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:17.760]  three countries which have nothing in common North Korea's the last communist
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:25.360]  country is isolated in the Far East Iran and Iraq had just been fighting an
[02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:30.040]  eight-year war a million casualties one is secular one is Shiite they're at each
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:35.960]  other's throats well one suit yet one was Sunni one Shiite who's been at odds
[02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:41.440]  since the 7th century nothing in common and yet Bush's neoconservative
[02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:48.160]  word crafters created that this notion of a common enemy that we we face so I
[02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:54.840]  think you know what they what they are hoping is they can somehow come come up
[02:28:54.840 --> 02:29:03.560]  with a color revolution that with all this pressure on that the forces within
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:10.560]  Iran that we've been subsidizing will somehow come out on top to avoid the
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:14.800]  conflict with America but if not I think they're prepared to try to have some
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:20.880]  sort of a major military knockout blow because anything less than that if Iran
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:24.920]  responds they probably could block the oil flows from the person go all right
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:28.240]  stay there doc long long segment coming up I want you to continue to break that
[02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:32.520]  down and we come back I'm gonna also get into the fact that this is an act of
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:36.720]  war saying they're gonna board their ships and Iran has said you start boarding
[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:40.360]  our ships we're gonna board your ships and that's exactly what Cheney wanted
[02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:44.960]  back in 2007 they came out in Newarker magazine was to actually attack our own
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:48.880]  ships and blame it on Iran so we may see a false flag in the mix here as well
[02:29:48.880 --> 02:29:56.240]  we're right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:11.480]  dr paul craig robert so you were finishing up with iran
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:15.960]  and talking about trying to get our ships in there in their own waters
[02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:19.560]  uh boarding all of their ships saying they're not allowed to have fuel
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:23.000]  they're not allowed to have any finished goods
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:26.760]  i mean this is a classic act of siege of war
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:30.520]  and the iranians are saying they're gonna resist i remember bush five years
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:34.440]  ago admitted in a white house press release that they had
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:38.440]  al-qaeda connected terror groups uh inside shiai
[02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:42.920]  iran staging terror attacks and obama admits that's continuing
[02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:47.640]  i mean i'm not saying iran is run by saints but they haven't attacked us
[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:51.880]  and they have put up with a lot i mean our criminal government admits
[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:55.080]  they're in there bombing the daylights with terrorists
[02:35:55.080 --> 02:35:59.640]  inside iran and iran lays there and takes it but i can't see iran putting up
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:03.880]  with its ships being boarded i mean and how is our media gonna spend that
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:07.960]  how dare them iranians they wouldn't let our military board their ships i mean
[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:12.600]  is there no end to the evil that this country won't engage in
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:16.360]  apparently not i mean look the israelis just got away with
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:22.360]  boarding the the aid flotilla to gaza and killing all those people and
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:26.120]  nothing has happened uh once again we protected them
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:31.320]  diplomatically so if we let them do it we probably figure we can do it too
[02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:36.360]  so i don't think you know the real question is
[02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:39.480]  why does the rest of the world go along with this now
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:44.360]  my answer to the europeans is they're all american puppet states we've bought
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:48.200]  their leadership and they they're our puppets
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:53.560]  but why russia and china for some reason russia has not never
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:58.760]  delivered the sophisticated uh missile air defense
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:03.880]  that they contracted with iran to supply and they
[02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:07.480]  haven't delivered it because we keep telling them not to so why
[02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:13.480]  does russia allow us to interfere with their contract with iran
[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:18.360]  and then look at china china has massive energy investments
[02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:23.880]  in iran and china's economy is still going gangbusters they need energy
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:29.240]  and our plan for dealing with china is uh to cut them all from energy
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:34.920]  so why would china go along with this it seems to me
[02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:39.000]  that uh those are questions that i don't i don't know the answer
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:45.800]  too but the the rest of the world is somehow complicit in this
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:51.720]  and it makes no sense because the world knows that uh bill clinton lied about
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:59.080]  the syrbian uh kosovo albanian uh dispute we know that bush lied
[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:05.640]  about uh iraq and weapons and mass destruction we have the atomic
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:09.400]  international atomic energy agency reports from the inspectors on the
[02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:14.120]  ground that there's no diversion of enriched iranian
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:17.720]  from the nuclear energy program in iran to a weapons program
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:21.160]  we have all sixteen american intelligence agencies
[02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:26.680]  last year issuing a unanimous report that iran abandoned its nuclear weapons
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:32.280]  program in 2003 or seven years ago
[02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:37.880]  why doesn't somebody ask the president how do you know they have a weapons
[02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:40.360]  program when your own intelligence agency says
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:43.880]  they don't uh how do you know they have weapons
[02:38:43.880 --> 02:38:47.560]  when all the atomic energy agency reports say they don't
[02:38:47.560 --> 02:38:51.800]  how can they possibly have weapons when your own authorities say they're not
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:55.960]  capable of enriching iranium to that extent
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:38:58.840]  no one asks these questions nobody in the media asks them
[02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:03.240]  and iran has tried on what three separate occasions to give their iranium
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:07.560]  under un supervision uh to the french to the turks
[02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:12.040]  uh to the brazilians to enrich it where it's at a level that can't be used in
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:16.360]  weapons and that only enrages the united states and israel more
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:19.560]  i mean it's just a fact we are the bad guys in this
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:23.560]  we've overthrown iran's government twice in the last century
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:26.760]  and it's just outrageous that they're positioning us this
[02:39:26.760 --> 02:39:30.200]  but from every expert i talked to reama govern top cia
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:34.760]  analyst and many others and just common sense in studying the region
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:38.920]  uh there's close to 70 million iranians they they haven't been under siege for
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:43.720]  uh a decade plus like iraq they have high tech weapons they do have sleeper
[02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:47.640]  cells as any large nation does in other countries
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:51.480]  uh and uh this is the perfect storm they attack iran
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:54.360]  they won't have to stage terror attacks once the war is on
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:58.200]  iran will strike back it'll be called terrorism and there and the system is
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:01.960]  going to use this this crisis as a pretext to crack down
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:05.720]  on domestic populations in the u.s grab pension funds
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:09.160]  and do all the other things they do when we're distracted by a war
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:12.280]  and so this is good for the system to start a war
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:15.400]  and a lot of people like to rally around the flag when we are blowing the hell
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:19.400]  out of some poor group of brown people and so i see the system going ahead with
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:23.400]  it and all the indicators we've got out of israel and out of the u.s government
[02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:27.000]  is they are moving towards a full green light on this what's your take
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:31.080]  on the green light and when you think it's coming and what the aftermath of
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:34.920]  this war will be well alex i don't think anyone knows
[02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:38.520]  when it's coming i don't even think the people planning it know that
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:42.040]  because they're looking for some sort of a rationale
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:47.800]  excuse opportunity so in the outcome i don't think
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:54.520]  there's no either if i were the iranians i wouldn't sit
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:59.640]  there and wait for the attack i mean why respond
[02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:07.080]  after you've been badly hurt uh once i knew the attack was
[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:11.160]  coming and nothing could be done about it i if i were the iranians i simply would
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:16.120]  take out the american uh aircraft carriers i would let everything
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:20.040]  that i had fall on israel and i would start
[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:24.760]  because i wouldn't sit there and and then respond with whatever i happened to
[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:28.920]  have left after i had a massive attack you know the other day
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:33.000]  the the head of the university of london's
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:38.280]  center for international affairs said that they're gearing up for the total
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:42.680]  destruction of iran you see we've got troops in 10
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:46.920]  countries surrounding iran we've stockpiled all these
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:51.080]  bunker buster bombs apparently we've even moved
[02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:54.680]  tactical nuclear weapons the eagler see him
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:42:04.520]  yes and and so uh i don't think that uh they would be doing all of this
[02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:11.400]  just in order to uh scare iran or pressure no this is a full court press
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:14.600]  just like before the invasion of iraq both times
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:18.920]  and uh you're right they've said that if iran fights back in any way under bush
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:22.760]  and obamas continue this doctrine that they will use nuclear weapons on them
[02:42:22.760 --> 02:42:27.080]  so if iran lifts of hand to protect themselves
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:29.960]  the media is going to scream like it's the end of the world
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:33.800]  and i guess americans are going to sit there while their cities are being nuked
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:38.360]  feeling powerful and running american flags out on flag polls
[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:42.440]  meanwhile the same global corporate crime syndicate is destroying america's
[02:42:42.440 --> 02:42:46.280]  future so i guess in a way of americans go along with this war
[02:42:46.280 --> 02:42:50.040]  i'm gonna have to say we're cursed and we deserve for the bankers to rape us
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:55.240]  but i don't deserve to be raped by him so what do you do as an individual
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:43:01.000]  living in nazi germany yes i uh you'd be quiet
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:04.680]  listen alex you know i i think that if they do
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:08.920]  strike iran in some of her in this way
[02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:12.840]  one possibility would be that all of the colonized
[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:19.960]  puppet state muslims would feel so absolutely wrong and
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:23.880]  powerless that they could possibly overthrow
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:27.480]  the american puppets you might see revolution
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:33.000]  in egypt in jordan you might see it even in saudi arabia
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:37.720]  it's it's entirely possible that we would simply be going
[02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:43.640]  too far and undermine all the puppet regimes that we have already
[02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:47.240]  established there so the the there are many
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:51.080]  potential downsides to this that don't appear to
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:55.400]  figure in the calculations of the americans or the israelis
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:59.320]  and of course if it disrupts oil in any
[02:43:59.320 --> 02:44:04.200]  significant way uh that would be really judgmental
[02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:08.840]  for doctor doesn't israel losing in lebanon three and a half years ago
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:13.240]  and and having other setbacks i mean i mean doesn't that give them some pause
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:16.360]  before they just had us into world war three
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:19.880]  no no you see if they get rid of iran
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:23.160]  then there's no one to support hezbollah
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:27.480]  and hamas and so that's the other reason we didn't get to
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:32.520]  for the attack on iran it it gets rid of all the support
[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:36.920]  for the forces that block israel from stealing all of palestine
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:40.600]  and southern lebanon see israel is chomping at the bed
[02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:44.520]  to simply uh evict the few remaining palestine
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:49.480]  philip palestinians and to seize southern lebanon now they want that they
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:53.400]  want pass the goal on in that in that water supply they want the water supply
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:57.160]  from southern lebanon so that's their
[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:02.600]  stake in this war they want iran out of it uh because then once
[02:45:02.600 --> 02:45:06.040]  hezbollah uses up whatever weapons it has it wouldn't
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:11.960]  have any more and uh and there would be no way to
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:15.880]  stop them from simply how does iran get the weapons in through syria
[02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:19.960]  i don't know why doesn't iran just make a deal with israel
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:23.080]  and uh you know have a peace treaty i mean because
[02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:26.840]  iran is looking down the barrel of a nuclear bomb
[02:45:26.840 --> 02:45:30.760]  i don't know that either you know i is
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:34.760]  as i've said there's so many imponderance and they're not discussed
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:39.720]  i mean why does russia stand aside well you said earlier russia has now been
[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:42.120]  betrayed we know they've been trying to make deals
[02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:46.920]  uh with barry sataro known as barack obama and then he's broken those
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:50.680]  and then separately we see the fear mongering about these 11 russian spies
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:53.800]  you notice the russian spies and then now russia admits their spies want to
[02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:57.000]  do a swap weren't infiltrating the government because that's ceremonial
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:00.760]  they were infiltrating harvard and wall street because that's that's who runs
[02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:04.440]  this country well you know they're not accused of
[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:08.200]  spying they haven't they haven't done any spy they're accused of
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:12.040]  not registering as a foreign agent but of course
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:16.280]  apac doesn't register as a foreign agent either so i you know i'm very
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:20.440]  suspicious of that whole thing and what it's about
[02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:24.120]  clearly it's not a case of spying because there's no
[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:28.600]  spy charges brought against them and uh yeah there's just agents of influence
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:32.200]  which is just what business is but we don't even know that that
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:38.200]  and it's also suspicious to me alex that one of them confessed so quickly
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:42.360]  it's almost like he's put there to confess
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:46.840]  so maybe they rolled up a double agent that's
[02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:52.600]  so maybe this is just another way of pressuring
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:57.800]  rusher to keep them sort of on the defensive and sidelined
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:03.400]  while we proceed with the roll-up of aran
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:07.480]  maybe that's maybe that's the explanation because it was very strange
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:12.200]  to have the russian president here meeting with the bomb in the white house
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:15.560]  and the russians are falling all low themselves trying to have good relations
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:19.320]  with us despite us putting missile bases in poland and
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:22.760]  everywhere else surrounding them and turning georgia into
[02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:26.920]  yeah there's new press reports of more than 10 us bases being covertly built
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:31.960]  all around russia and this hoax i've had neocons say that i'm a liar
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:37.080]  and that russia did attack georgia i mean even the cnn had to admit later
[02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:41.480]  and fox that indeed georgia had attacked south osetia
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:47.640]  and and and that was all the hoax i mean i mean it's incredible the the baloney
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:51.800]  the american people are fed i mean i'm not for russia i'm an american
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:55.720]  but but i'm not going to sit here and lie and say that
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:47:59.480]  uh russia attacked georgia i mean it's it's like saying the the moons made out
[02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:02.360]  of cheese right right but that's right in the
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:06.520]  real question though you see the european union knows that the european union
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:10.040]  has made it clear that the the georgians
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:13.800]  spurred on by the americans initiated that war
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:17.800]  so why does the european union uh continue to
[02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:21.720]  support the expansion of nato uh why does it
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:25.480]  support the american war in afghanistan you know they have
[02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:31.560]  european union troops uh and the nato flag fighting our battles in
[02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:35.800]  afghanistan so why see the real question is why do all these
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:39.640]  countries who've got nothing to gain from this and potentially
[02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:43.400]  a tremendous amount to lose why are they
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:47.640]  giving us the green light well we know why we know why and and and uh you know
[02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:51.000]  that's one reason the director was snapped up and put in prison
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:55.240]  decades after his reported crime uh is if you've seen the movie ghost writer
[02:48:55.240 --> 02:48:57.880]  it's actually based on what's been declassified
[02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:03.800]  that tony blair was mi6 and we know there's been a 50 year covert western
[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:07.400]  program to get the major leaders of europe elected or
[02:49:07.400 --> 02:49:11.160]  compromised and that much of europe is run by
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:15.320]  us british slash israeli puppets and so that's why
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:20.200]  europe goes along because most of their leaders are actually u.s intelligence
[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:23.800]  that's that's probably the case we're certainly on the payroll
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:30.600]  but why russia and china i mean you know china is a very powerful state they're
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:35.480]  our banker why why do they because they made sweetheart
[02:49:35.480 --> 02:49:39.800]  deals as you know in the 70s to get our industry and uh
[02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:43.960]  so they're they're so deeply in bed with with corporate interest
[02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:47.960]  that they they just can't get out of bed but they have it now
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:52.760]  it's they've got it they don't they don't need that anymore they've got it
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:56.360]  so i it maybe it's just they have a very short run
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:02.360]  time horizon on this particular issue uh or maybe there it's just tradition
[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:08.280]  maybe they're just going along you know for a century after the roman empire
[02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:12.280]  fell the little principalities that grew up they
[02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:16.840]  still put caesar's head on their coins
[02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:21.400]  because otherwise they thought people wouldn't trust the money
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:26.920]  so maybe it's something like that that everyone thinks that we are super
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:30.840]  powerful not a superpower look we can't finance our war
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:35.240]  we can't finance our own government but we can hold everybody hostage
[02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:40.680]  with 50 000 nuclear weapons and bio weapons maybe
[02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:43.800]  and and you know they got a lot of secret weapons as well i mean that's it i mean
[02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:46.440]  it's like a bank robber with a gun to your head and of course the very same
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:50.040]  bank robbers robbing us but uh percentage of americans still think
[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:53.560]  it's patriotic to kill people they can't find the country on a map but it
[02:50:53.560 --> 02:50:57.160]  sure feels good you know sure feels good uh

[02:54:54.360 --> 02:54:58.840]  confiscation that's right i mean what what else

[02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:14.120]  any uh answer for that i suppose they're just getting us
[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:20.360]  used to accept illegal orders you know it's like we if you fly you get
[02:55:20.360 --> 02:55:25.960]  searched without warrants it's they're just getting us used to
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:29.960]  living in a police state i suppose i don't know what else it is no that's
[02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:34.200]  it it's disgusting we've got to say no uh let's talk to jeff in new hampshire
[02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:38.120]  you're on the air thanks for holding hi elix how you doing i just want to say
[02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:41.800]  right off the bat that you are the voice of our founding fathers in the 21st
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:46.120]  century well thank you i try my best sir what's on your mind
[02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:50.040]  well basically you know listening to you talk to dr roberts i i had a
[02:55:50.040 --> 02:55:52.840]  question um you know being someone who
[02:55:52.840 --> 02:55:55.560]  has been educated you know as a degree in history
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:56:00.200]  um i did a bit of research and i found that the 16th amendment
[02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:04.040]  wasn't properly ratified i mean here in new hampshire there's no record that
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:07.240]  the state even ratified it at all now i've looked into that i mean it really
[02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:11.000]  wasn't ratified another fraud another hoax to give us the income tax and
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:14.520]  we built this country without it what's your question for roberts
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:18.920]  well what i'm wondering is is you know what the fact that our our government
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:22.200]  is a business and you know a business is there
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:26.120]  you know getting paid for their services here is the dark our government
[02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:31.800]  not acting in our best interest you know where the 16th amendment
[02:56:31.800 --> 02:56:36.520]  is an illegal amendment you know because of secretary of state not saying
[02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:39.800]  more than that it's declaration of independence we got an out of control
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:43.080]  corrupt government i appreciate your call what do we do about that and we
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:47.000]  have the declaration of independence it's not it just our right it's our duty
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:50.760]  to remove this government and reform it as we see fit
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:54.600]  but they've been quietly preparing to call us terrorists
[02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:57.480]  ahead of this collapse they were getting ready for it it's
[02:56:57.480 --> 02:57:01.000]  it's completely premeditated
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:05.560]  i mean what's your take on that i mean what do you do when you know you have a
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:12.440]  lawless government dr roberts well you know if you and i know we can't
[02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:16.120]  do much we can try to tell other people before they arrest us
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:19.960]  if everybody knew and didn't like it then they could revoke
[02:57:19.960 --> 02:57:24.280]  and i think we're that's where we are if we want to get rid of this lawless
[02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:28.280]  government it's not going to happen at the ballot box
[02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:33.400]  and it's not going to happen because we get a third party or libertarians
[02:57:33.400 --> 02:57:38.280]  it happens at all is because people catch on and
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:45.240]  do something about it and by then as you say they may be too powerful
[02:57:45.240 --> 02:57:49.320]  too powerful for us to do anything about it the caller
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:56.280]  is appealing to the law he's saying look this income tax is
[02:57:56.280 --> 02:57:59.960]  it's not legal it wasn't ratified it's still unconstitutional and yet we've
[02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:07.800]  had it for almost a hundred years and how can that be well
[02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:13.240]  we don't have any part of the constitution we don't have habeas corpus
[02:58:13.240 --> 02:58:17.480]  you know we we have laws against torture american laws
[02:58:17.480 --> 02:58:21.400]  they just this lawlessness and it's nothing you know i mean that's it we
[02:58:21.400 --> 02:58:24.440]  don't just have a corrupt government folks we have a premeditated
[02:58:24.440 --> 02:58:28.680]  lawless criminal group that is breaking and violating laws to set
[02:58:28.680 --> 02:58:31.640]  precedence they are dominating us they are enforcing

[03:00:16.840 --> 03:00:20.200]  nutter paul dredg roberts the best-selling author of the tyranny of
[03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:24.040]  good intentions former wall street journal editor father reganomics
[03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:26.600]  at a policy department of treasury under reagan
[03:00:26.600 --> 03:00:29.960]  is our guest we're just jamming in a few calls here at the tail end
[03:00:29.960 --> 03:00:34.040]  damon in south carolina quick question or comment for dr roberts
[03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:37.240]  yes sir i have one comment one question i give the comment quick i think one of
[03:00:37.240 --> 03:00:41.160]  the reasons why i ran is not really fighting back yet is
[03:00:41.160 --> 03:00:44.920]  at least some people i'm sure in the government are have bought into the whole
[03:00:44.920 --> 03:00:49.240]  martyrdom situation and that if they are sacrificed at least the rest of islam
[03:00:49.240 --> 03:00:52.200]  in the world will rise up and avenge them so to speak
[03:00:52.200 --> 03:00:55.560]  that's one thought that i have the question i have is this my wife is
[03:00:55.560 --> 03:00:58.600]  from the former soviet union the republic of bella roose
[03:00:58.600 --> 03:01:03.480]  and she tells me the story i'm 37 she's 36 she tells me a story that when she was
[03:01:03.480 --> 03:01:09.320]  younger and perestroika happened and basically her parents life savings went
[03:01:09.320 --> 03:01:13.560]  from having enough money to you know buy a lot to not enough money to even buy a
[03:01:13.560 --> 03:01:17.720]  bicycle almost overnight i mean it was a very short period of time
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:23.160]  and my question to dr roberts is um i thought about buying gold but
[03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:26.920]  you know if you have what you know roosevelt did or what um our government
[03:01:26.920 --> 03:01:29.640]  did in the uh you know almost a century ago where
[03:01:29.640 --> 03:01:33.080]  you know you have a crisis and they come in they start calling in all the gold
[03:01:33.080 --> 03:01:36.920]  well you have to ignore that at that point nothing's bulletproof nothing i mean
[03:01:36.920 --> 03:01:40.440]  you get in your car every day you may die it's the safest thing out there history
[03:01:40.440 --> 03:01:44.520]  is shown but nothing's safe dr roberts comments on that
[03:01:44.520 --> 03:01:49.320]  yet that's right roosevelt's days the americans were extremely gullible
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:55.000]  and even more naive than today but there's always silver you know go
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:58.360]  if you start going to a grocery store with gold
[03:01:58.360 --> 03:02:02.600]  you'll have you know bad times arrive you'll have trouble getting change
[03:02:02.600 --> 03:02:07.400]  and you may find armed people waiting on you when you leave the store
[03:02:07.400 --> 03:02:12.440]  so i think everybody should have some sort of
[03:02:12.440 --> 03:02:16.760]  precious metal capability to see them through a period in which the money
[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:20.760]  could be inflated away yeah i mean nothing's bulletproof
[03:02:20.760 --> 03:02:24.360]  nothing is a silver bullet the closest thing to a silver bullet is silver
[03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:27.160]  pun intended uh but no i mean that's the point in this
[03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:31.240]  tyranny nothing is safe the only thing that's safe is liberty and freedom
[03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:34.280]  that that that's the engine of everything good damon i appreciate your
[03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:38.360]  call george in connecticut last caller for dr roberts go ahead
[03:02:38.360 --> 03:02:42.920]  dr roberts uh quick insight and also a quick question i wanted to tell you
[03:02:42.920 --> 03:02:46.280]  about the chinese situation they're basically waiting for us to make our
[03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:49.960]  move so they can basically pick up the pieces from us destroying ourselves
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:53.800]  i've spent several years with the in the orient and i know the mind of these
[03:02:53.800 --> 03:02:58.520]  people and i think even people like
[03:02:58.520 --> 03:03:03.240]  jevinsky and and and kissinger basically are using them as a backdoor if this
[03:03:03.240 --> 03:03:06.680]  whole world falls apart they're going to use that as a
[03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:10.520]  place to the globalists have already moved their second base to china that's
[03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:13.640]  a great point uh what did you have a question
[03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:17.240]  yes the question is why doesn't turkey maybe get in between
[03:03:17.240 --> 03:03:21.320]  uh a united states they look you you can't do this the the u n that doesn't
[03:03:21.320 --> 03:03:24.680]  allow this we didn't agree on this well turkey has
[03:03:24.680 --> 03:03:28.280]  now said if israel doesn't apologize they're breaking off ties good points
[03:03:28.280 --> 03:03:32.600]  let's get dr roberts take on that well you know turkey is a native
[03:03:32.600 --> 03:03:40.440]  member and so they're kind of got a foot in both camps i think the
[03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:43.800]  the chinese may be betting that we will overreach
[03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:50.120]  and destroy ourselves but they're taking an enormous risk because we if we
[03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:54.760]  don't we intend to deny them access to energy
[03:03:54.760 --> 03:03:59.080]  and so they should see that as a greater threat than they do
[03:03:59.080 --> 03:04:02.440]  well that's right they're they're encircling china but then also allowing
[03:04:02.440 --> 03:04:07.000]  them to get oil but to only buy it from the western power block
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:10.760]  and uh the stated policy is to encircle russia and china
[03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:14.440]  and down the road have a war with them and i mean well how do these lunatic
[03:04:14.440 --> 03:04:18.520]  neocons that still run things sneak attack russia and now it comes out
[03:04:18.520 --> 03:04:23.000]  cheney wanted to have nuclear war i mean these people are mentally ill at their
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:26.440]  foundation yes i when i was in washington and the
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:30.360]  government and and running around with big shots
[03:04:30.360 --> 03:04:34.840]  the neocons are just they very much desired to have a war with russia they
[03:04:34.840 --> 03:04:38.680]  wanted to defeat the soviet union militarily and they've got
[03:04:38.680 --> 03:04:43.960]  very angry and reagan worked out of the oberchoff and ended the
[03:04:43.960 --> 03:04:47.800]  co-war they just got very angry they didn't like that

[03:06:03.400 --> 03:06:07.720]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double

[03:06:11.960 --> 03:06:14.840]  how much power your electric company allows you to have
[03:06:14.840 --> 03:06:19.080]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[03:06:19.080 --> 03:06:22.680]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[03:06:22.680 --> 03:06:27.160]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[03:06:27.160 --> 03:06:31.000]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:34.200]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[03:06:34.200 --> 03:06:38.120]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[03:08:04.920 --> 03:08:11.160]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[03:08:11.880 --> 03:08:15.480]  we've got 52 minutes left in broadcast today
[03:08:15.480 --> 03:08:22.600]  wednesday july 7 2010 and i know that the apple home city bombing of the
[03:08:22.600 --> 03:08:26.200]  alpapumera building was 15 years ago but it's more important than ever
[03:08:26.200 --> 03:08:29.640]  because on all these television documentaries they're
[03:08:29.640 --> 03:08:33.000]  invoking it again and saying that people that are against the new world order
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.640]  and people that are against the federal government taking over in
[03:08:35.640 --> 03:08:38.600]  health care they're terrorists they're going to kill you
[03:08:38.600 --> 03:08:41.720]  and alex jones wants violence he wants to kill you
[03:08:41.720 --> 03:08:45.160]  when we actually call for the opposite and so it's clear that they're getting
[03:08:45.160 --> 03:08:49.160]  ready to play that card the hitari even seven months
[03:08:49.160 --> 03:08:52.360]  before they got busted so they've got infiltrators in there and it turned out
[03:08:52.360 --> 03:08:54.680]  they had two the feds have covered up who they are
[03:08:54.680 --> 03:08:58.920]  but i think the fact that people exposed that there were some fake arrests there
[03:08:58.920 --> 03:09:03.160]  with at least two of the nine people caused that trial to fall apart and the
[03:09:03.160 --> 03:09:06.360]  judge said this was politically motivated and just a pr stunt
[03:09:06.360 --> 03:09:09.160]  kind of like weiko yeah they were doing some weird stuff most of it
[03:09:09.160 --> 03:09:13.320]  exaggerated they could have picked up vernan howe aka david koresh any day
[03:09:13.320 --> 03:09:16.440]  he went into town every day had an auto parts repair shop
[03:09:16.440 --> 03:09:20.360]  two miles away they wanted that big stunt and that came out of course
[03:09:20.360 --> 03:09:24.760]  in the atf documents and then that really blew up in their face so the feds
[03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:27.960]  bombed oklahoma city and the evidence is just a hundred percent
[03:09:27.960 --> 03:09:30.600]  in triplicate up one side and down the other
[03:09:30.600 --> 03:09:33.880]  that the feds bombed oklahoma city and people who work for the federal
[03:09:33.880 --> 03:09:37.080]  government need to realize that none of you are safe so we're going to be
[03:09:37.080 --> 03:09:39.880]  talking to some very interesting individuals and
[03:09:39.880 --> 03:09:43.000]  we've got two of them in here now towards the end i may try to get one of
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.240]  the other fellows in here who i've interviewed before
[03:09:45.240 --> 03:09:49.560]  who's got great connections and research between oklahoma city 15 years ago and
[03:09:49.560 --> 03:09:52.840]  9 11 9 years ago so that's coming up but in other
[03:09:52.840 --> 03:09:56.280]  news this is the type of stuff comes across my desk every day
[03:09:56.280 --> 03:10:01.000]  this is out of the korea times and it says can good emerge from bp oil spill
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:05.400]  and this is by kenneth rogoff and rogoff was the chief economist of the
[03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:09.080]  international monetary fund which is openly trying to set up world
[03:10:09.080 --> 03:10:12.280]  government and he says the fact that bp oil spill
[03:10:12.280 --> 03:10:16.040]  is on the cusp of becoming a political game changer of historic proportions
[03:10:16.040 --> 03:10:21.000]  we may get a carbon tax long advocated by a broad spectrum of economists
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:24.520]  it is a generalized version of a gas tax that hits all forms of carbon emissions
[03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:27.240]  including from coal and natural gas and principle
[03:10:27.240 --> 03:10:30.680]  one can create a cap and trade system of qualitative restrictions and
[03:10:30.680 --> 03:10:33.720]  accomplishments much the same thing and it seems to be
[03:10:33.720 --> 03:10:37.560]  more palatable to politicians who will jump through hoops to avoid using the
[03:10:37.560 --> 03:10:41.240]  word tax so the world bank and the former imf
[03:10:41.240 --> 03:10:44.840]  head because it's one group they're basically saying we're
[03:10:44.840 --> 03:10:47.480]  going to get a carbon tax out of that interesting little tidbit
[03:10:47.480 --> 03:10:51.080]  but don't worry we got thousands of emails with the heads
[03:10:51.080 --> 03:10:55.560]  of the un program hiding the fact of the earth's been cooling for 10 years
[03:10:55.560 --> 03:10:59.400]  uh stopped warming 15 years ago because the sun cooling off
[03:10:59.400 --> 03:11:04.200]  uk inquiry finds emails do not undermine climate science
[03:11:04.200 --> 03:11:07.240]  uk inquiry finds emails do not undermine climate science
[03:11:07.240 --> 03:11:11.000]  and then of course we wrote months ago about this inquiry it's all headed up by
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:14.520]  top global warming globalist this is like having
[03:11:14.520 --> 03:11:19.320]  uh joseph gerbils run the nurenberg trials on hitler
[03:11:19.320 --> 03:11:24.280]  i mean it or or having bugsy seagull run the trial of al capone
[03:11:24.280 --> 03:11:30.760]  or having the jenna vizies investigate uh the gambino's i mean it's
[03:11:30.760 --> 03:11:34.680]  it's incredible i mean it's worse than the fox guarding the henhouse
[03:11:34.680 --> 03:11:38.040]  and we have a key article by steve watson up at prison planet dot com
[03:11:38.040 --> 03:11:42.840]  climate gate whitewash complete third inquiry clears everyone involved and
[03:11:42.840 --> 03:11:46.120]  then we have our top stories today they're up on gcm live
[03:11:46.120 --> 03:11:51.480]  dot com that's gcn the initials gcm live dot com that's the
[03:11:51.480 --> 03:11:55.160]  genesis network associates this show new york national guard units scan
[03:11:55.160 --> 03:11:58.600]  vehicles for gun confiscations we have the fox news clip
[03:11:58.600 --> 03:12:03.400]  there from the local news and photos of the gun searches and confiscations
[03:12:03.400 --> 03:12:07.720]  going on in america at gcm live dot com and we also have some other reports up
[03:12:07.720 --> 03:12:11.720]  on gcm live dot com polish troops trained to take on american
[03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:16.760]  terrorist and our 25 minute video report we sent two reporters for a week
[03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:20.040]  uh two weeks ago to chicago that report is now filed
[03:12:20.040 --> 03:12:23.080]  foreign troops training for gun confiscation on video
[03:12:23.080 --> 03:12:27.080]  and to take the american people on as terrorist that's all up at gcm live
[03:12:27.080 --> 03:12:31.080]  dot com so just unbelievably uh important information
[03:12:31.080 --> 03:12:34.760]  now for the balance of the hour uh turning to guys who we could have on for
[03:12:34.760 --> 03:12:38.280]  10 hours and they have their own radio show on rule of law radio and give you
[03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:42.040]  that website uh before they uh leave us
[03:12:42.040 --> 03:12:46.120]  they're james lane and of course chris emory and they're both filmmakers
[03:12:46.120 --> 03:12:50.040]  researchers uh some of the best research out there
[03:12:50.040 --> 03:12:53.560]  and so i wanted both of them to just spend four or five minutes a piece
[03:12:53.560 --> 03:12:56.760]  explaining why oklahoma city is important giving the basic facts and then
[03:12:56.760 --> 03:13:00.760]  you had some nice government documents about jolly and west the admitted mind
[03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:03.320]  control had mk ultra doctor along with you and
[03:13:03.320 --> 03:13:07.400]  cameron being mcvay's doctor throughout this whole thing i mean you
[03:13:07.400 --> 03:13:11.400]  can't a science fiction writer couldn't come up with stuff this bizarre
[03:13:11.400 --> 03:13:15.960]  and in our face uh so we'll talk about that today and who you think mcvay
[03:13:15.960 --> 03:13:19.320]  really was uh so chris emory why don't you take it first
[03:13:19.320 --> 03:13:23.160]  well thanks for having us on alex uh the reason oklahoma city is still
[03:13:23.160 --> 03:13:27.160]  relevant today is that it is a script that the federal government has followed
[03:13:27.160 --> 03:13:32.600]  for the last i'd say 35 years and it's easy to see
[03:13:32.600 --> 03:13:36.440]  when an action comes up like 9 11 or these uh militia
[03:13:36.440 --> 03:13:39.480]  raids and so forth you know pretty much you set up a clip when you know
[03:13:39.480 --> 03:13:43.480]  exactly what's going to happen and even before i get into filmmaking and uh
[03:13:43.480 --> 03:13:46.200]  the truth movement so to speak of research in this i was listening to your
[03:13:46.200 --> 03:13:49.960]  shows and this is you know what alex is right you hit all of the points
[03:13:49.960 --> 03:13:53.400]  and it's it's easy to see how they do this and they have no compunction they're
[03:13:53.400 --> 03:13:56.520]  not embarrassed they're actually very proud of the fact that they repeat these
[03:13:56.520 --> 03:13:59.400]  and it's insidious it doesn't get any worse than that
[03:13:59.400 --> 03:14:03.320]  people need to wake up and they need to know not only oklahoma city but wake
[03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:08.120]  up it's a consistent trail of events and it gets worse the the body count is
[03:14:08.120 --> 03:14:12.280]  worse as it goes along what we're trying to do with this film is bring out a lot
[03:14:12.280 --> 03:14:14.600]  of the information that people haven't been exposed to
[03:14:14.600 --> 03:14:17.560]  of james is going to elaborate on footage that has never been seen before
[03:14:17.560 --> 03:14:20.600]  that we've has come our way we're going to highlight that you're interviewing
[03:14:20.600 --> 03:14:23.480]  uh taryn jakey's family about how they murdered him and you're getting all the
[03:14:23.480 --> 03:14:27.160]  interviews yes sir so uh anyway we want to have bring a
[03:14:27.160 --> 03:14:30.760]  completely fresh perspective on this uh information that has never been revealed
[03:14:30.760 --> 03:14:33.480]  before and we are very grateful for having the
[03:14:33.480 --> 03:14:36.360]  opportunity to be on here uh to reveal this information
[03:14:36.360 --> 03:14:38.200]  oh i'm glad to have you here this was just an
[03:14:38.200 --> 03:14:40.760]  afterthought that you're here to interview me for the film i'm honored to be part
[03:14:40.760 --> 03:14:43.640]  of that yeah but i mean but i mean get into just the
[03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:47.640]  let's say you had three minutes on national tv uh
[03:14:47.640 --> 03:14:51.000]  what would you say to the public about oklahoma city to get them to realize
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:54.840]  what really happened 12 people were involved that we know of it as many as
[03:14:54.840 --> 03:14:58.120]  18 uh the the scripted two perps and nobody
[03:14:58.120 --> 03:15:01.960]  else involved is complete bunk it is that is a slap in the face to the
[03:15:01.960 --> 03:15:05.560]  victim's family members and survivors people need to realize that we are
[03:15:05.560 --> 03:15:09.320]  going to expose information we choose to remember the deaths of these people in
[03:15:09.320 --> 03:15:12.360]  the truth versus a lie uh the second thing is that there was
[03:15:12.360 --> 03:15:15.800]  so many people so much resources there was more money spent covering up this
[03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:18.600]  case than actually investigating in the proper manner
[03:15:18.600 --> 03:15:22.040]  the federal government actually went backwards they did a complete u-turn on
[03:15:22.040 --> 03:15:25.720]  all of the ethics all of the integrity all of the resources the professional
[03:15:25.720 --> 03:15:28.920]  everything they had they threw it out the window just to make sure that this was
[03:15:28.920 --> 03:15:32.440]  covered up because we know that there were actually assets government assets
[03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:36.200]  both the united states and and elsewhere overseas that were involved
[03:15:36.200 --> 03:15:39.400]  and making sure that this thing came down they were supposed to stop it at
[03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:42.600]  last minute it backfired right in right at their feet
[03:15:42.600 --> 03:15:45.320]  well and that's what they always tell the mid-level people is oh we're going to
[03:15:45.320 --> 03:15:49.720]  stop this just like in the first world trade center attack
[03:15:49.720 --> 03:15:53.800]  right before we go i mean they hired an egyptian security
[03:15:53.800 --> 03:15:57.240]  agent amad salon had him cook a real bomb and he's going look here and let the
[03:15:57.240 --> 03:15:59.160]  bombing go forward he knew they were setting him up
[03:15:59.160 --> 03:16:02.920]  exactly so he recorded them and that came out in the new york times in cbs and
[03:16:02.920 --> 03:16:05.000]  they said look let it go ahead and happen
[03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:09.080]  we're going to do this and so that's how they always do it but i mean you have
[03:16:09.080 --> 03:16:12.760]  jane graham everybody else in the building c mcvey and the other guys
[03:16:12.760 --> 03:16:15.800]  in there planning the bombs and she thought it was gray sticks of butter
[03:16:15.800 --> 03:16:19.000]  that's right james you wanted to go ahead and add a few things on there
[03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:22.040]  yeah um i think the one thing that stood out to me the most is i'm doing my
[03:16:22.040 --> 03:16:26.200]  research was the the anfo bomb the story that it was it was info that was used
[03:16:26.200 --> 03:16:30.760]  the ammonium nitrate and fuel mixture would create a cloud of nitric gas well
[03:16:30.760 --> 03:16:33.880]  we know because of the tarenchiki story that he was there
[03:16:33.880 --> 03:16:37.320]  within minutes of the bombing point tom hall out
[03:16:37.320 --> 03:16:40.760]  nobody had any problems with respiration we know vz laughton he was
[03:16:40.760 --> 03:16:43.320]  there he's a survivor nobody smelled it it was i mean
[03:16:43.320 --> 03:16:47.160]  and of course general part in the building blown out not in right and so i
[03:16:47.160 --> 03:16:51.000]  mean if it was not if it was info there would have been a huge nitric gas cloud
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:54.280]  over the building and initially right the the minutes after the bombing that's
[03:16:54.280 --> 03:16:57.000]  the wind was blown right into the building where vz laughton was
[03:16:57.000 --> 03:17:00.280]  nobody had any problems with that so i mean that that disproves the that
[03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:04.360]  info was used we have evidence the 40 year anniversary of a
[03:17:04.360 --> 03:17:07.240]  bombing in madison wisconsin is coming up this
[03:17:07.240 --> 03:17:10.360]  august and 23 people were sent to the hospital
[03:17:10.360 --> 03:17:13.800]  after the first responders were sent to the hospital because they were
[03:17:13.800 --> 03:17:18.200]  overcome with the the fumes you know so we know that that's the pattern of it
[03:17:18.200 --> 03:17:21.720]  and they expect us to believe this it gets so cartoonish it's almost like
[03:17:21.720 --> 03:17:25.080]  wiley coyote tiptoeing in with the acme bomb you know and this is what they
[03:17:25.080 --> 03:17:28.120]  expect the american people to believe then we have the footage of them removing
[03:17:28.120 --> 03:17:31.800]  the other bombs that didn't go off i mean in the in parts of the building
[03:17:31.800 --> 03:17:34.760]  blown across the street the opposite direction of the truck bomb
[03:17:34.760 --> 03:17:38.200]  i mean it just goes on and then killing the cop that was exposing it torturing
[03:17:38.200 --> 03:17:41.560]  into death and and just just just i mean it goes on and on
[03:17:41.560 --> 03:17:45.480]  well the story of of tarenchiki you mentioned the video that we did on that
[03:17:45.480 --> 03:17:48.120]  we just thought was important for that story to be told i mean that may always
[03:17:48.120 --> 03:17:51.480]  was a was a real hero he worked himself beyond exhaustion to save people that
[03:17:51.480 --> 03:17:53.960]  day and he he said that that was the official
[03:17:53.960 --> 03:17:57.400]  story was not how it happened and you know i mean he was he was
[03:17:57.400 --> 03:18:00.120]  concerned for his safety right before they tortured him he thought he'd been
[03:18:00.120 --> 03:18:02.440]  poisoned right yeah he was sick he was they were talking
[03:18:02.440 --> 03:18:05.960]  about getting him to the hospital and he i think to protect his family he kind
[03:18:05.960 --> 03:18:09.480]  of isolated himself from them and he was on the way to a meeting
[03:18:09.480 --> 03:18:14.040]  that morning and uh he never made it you know and the they found him tortured
[03:18:14.040 --> 03:18:16.600]  to death yeah the uh rope burns possible rope
[03:18:16.600 --> 03:18:21.640]  burns on the neck uh the angle of the shot uh he uh bled out in the car
[03:18:21.640 --> 03:18:24.840]  uh went a quarter supposedly walked a quarter of a mile after bleeding out
[03:18:24.840 --> 03:18:28.840]  and then shot himself at a downward angle you know again it ruled suicide
[03:18:28.840 --> 03:18:32.200]  immediately and it's absurd the information that we're getting
[03:18:32.200 --> 03:18:33.960]  alex you let us know how you're doing on a break
[03:18:33.960 --> 03:18:37.640]  is that uh both there are good members of law enforcement local county state and
[03:18:37.640 --> 03:18:39.720]  federal level that have come forward either
[03:18:39.720 --> 03:18:43.480]  admitted their identity or wanted to be uh you know anonymous
[03:18:43.480 --> 03:18:46.760]  and there's a consistent pattern of okay this is the information that makes
[03:18:46.760 --> 03:18:48.920]  sense what the federal government and their
[03:18:48.920 --> 03:18:52.360]  like you said the cartoonist story simply can't hold his own there there is no
[03:18:52.360 --> 03:18:55.400]  factual foundation on it so we go back and we say okay
[03:18:55.400 --> 03:18:58.200]  we're going to present the information that we know is factual
[03:18:58.200 --> 03:19:01.320]  reams of documentation every single thing that we're going to have on the film
[03:19:01.320 --> 03:19:04.760]  we'll have a big bibliography and there's going to be reference on all of that so
[03:19:04.760 --> 03:19:08.200]  there's no question and we're going to paint a completely different story we
[03:19:08.200 --> 03:19:11.320]  need to get the truth out on this people will have that as a foundation just
[03:19:11.320 --> 03:19:13.800]  like a lot of your movies to make a judgment call and what's going to
[03:19:13.800 --> 03:19:17.720]  happen in the future they have to know well then you've got the fbi coming
[03:19:17.720 --> 03:19:21.400]  and brandishing guns at hoppy heidelberg the head grand juror's house
[03:19:21.400 --> 03:19:24.200]  and telling him you're not going to call these witnesses you're going to shut up
[03:19:24.200 --> 03:19:27.080]  i mean you have the motive i mean bill clinton on
[03:19:27.080 --> 03:19:30.920]  air force one a year after the attack he they said why did you get reelected
[03:19:30.920 --> 03:19:33.400]  your approval rating was way down it went way back up he said oklahoma
[03:19:33.400 --> 03:19:36.680]  said he got me reelected well i mean that's why hitler fire bombed his own
[03:19:36.680 --> 03:19:40.520]  Reichstag the whitewater documents were housed in the building
[03:19:40.520 --> 03:19:44.280]  for the whole investigation now he was going to go down like a lead balloon
[03:19:44.280 --> 03:19:46.920]  was unbelievable may of that year congressional hearings are going to
[03:19:46.920 --> 03:19:48.840]  take him down on the whitewater investigation
[03:19:48.840 --> 03:19:53.160]  let's fix this all in one shot blow that building make sure there's kids inside
[03:19:53.160 --> 03:19:58.520]  people love images of them and get rid of them documents at the same time
[03:19:58.520 --> 03:20:01.480]  we'll be right back
[03:20:01.480 --> 03:20:06.520]  they helped to create a new world order we are part of a new world order a new
[03:20:06.520 --> 03:20:11.320]  world order based upon collective action invisible empire is a damning
[03:20:11.320 --> 03:20:14.760]  indictment of the globalist through their own words and documents the new
[03:20:14.760 --> 03:20:19.000]  world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities
[03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:23.080]  it means all the world under their control the united nations would take
[03:20:23.080 --> 03:20:28.280]  over america the trilateral commission would control the world invisible empire
[03:20:28.280 --> 03:20:31.800]  chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for
[03:20:31.800 --> 03:20:35.080]  centuries to establish an oppressive world government
[03:20:35.080 --> 03:20:39.080]  i believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[03:20:39.080 --> 03:20:42.520]  for the global financial system global governance with the establishment of
[03:20:42.520 --> 03:20:45.720]  the g20 so it's going to be an inner ruling elite
[03:20:45.720 --> 03:20:49.400]  and then everyone else and i got news for you you're everyone
[03:20:49.400 --> 03:20:55.000]  invisible empire secure your copy today at info wars dot com or prison planet

[03:21:00.680 --> 03:21:04.680]  originally we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency
[03:21:04.680 --> 03:21:07.720]  to ensure purity content weights and measures
[03:21:07.720 --> 03:21:10.760]  of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce
[03:21:10.760 --> 03:21:15.240]  this reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system
[03:21:15.240 --> 03:21:19.240]  wisdom being lost with time the government we once entrusted to protect
[03:21:19.240 --> 03:21:22.040]  from counterfeit has colluded with private business
[03:21:22.040 --> 03:21:25.080]  creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country
[03:21:25.080 --> 03:21:28.600]  ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an
[03:21:28.600 --> 03:21:32.120]  institution that is not accountable to our elected government but has also

[03:24:28.200 --> 03:24:32.600]  in the winter of this year okay you were going over incredible information about
[03:24:32.600 --> 03:24:37.240]  jolly and weston you know other tidbits things that are documented on record
[03:24:37.240 --> 03:24:40.600]  but are so bizarre it's we're true the stranger than fiction get into it we've
[03:24:40.600 --> 03:24:44.760]  got a researcher wendy painting that has been uncovering these documents and
[03:24:44.760 --> 03:24:47.400]  she's actually getting through information that the fbi hadn't even
[03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:51.560]  seen that was the actual records for the defense
[03:24:51.560 --> 03:24:56.680]  and we've got a hold of jolly west resume and i always make vege doctor from
[03:24:56.680 --> 03:24:59.640]  the time he gets arrested to his execution yes
[03:24:59.640 --> 03:25:03.640]  and i always suspected that he there was some link with you know
[03:25:03.640 --> 03:25:08.200]  mind control psychological warfare and sure enough on the second page of his
[03:25:08.200 --> 03:25:12.040]  resume we've got where he worked for the tavastok institute
[03:25:12.040 --> 03:25:14.680]  which is the top british mind control operation
[03:25:14.680 --> 03:25:18.120]  and then of course he came he was in the mk ultra 77 hearings
[03:25:18.120 --> 03:25:21.240]  as the number two man in the world in the mk ultra program under
[03:25:21.240 --> 03:25:25.560]  ewing camera and now this is has a tavastok institute has direct
[03:25:25.560 --> 03:25:30.200]  links back to when the fabian fabians absorbed the national socialist science
[03:25:30.200 --> 03:25:33.160]  through project paperclip so i mean this guy was really the
[03:25:33.160 --> 03:25:38.520]  inheritor of of that knowledge uh and now he goes in uh to the the
[03:25:38.520 --> 03:25:43.320]  location there in el Reno in fact guys do it got a document cam shot of this
[03:25:43.320 --> 03:25:47.240]  i keep going and uh in el Reno and what did the
[03:25:47.240 --> 03:25:50.920]  warden say there well the the warden says he runs a clean operation that was
[03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:53.800]  at the federal correctional facility a mile and a half from where teriyaki's
[03:25:53.800 --> 03:25:57.560]  body was found by the way and when he found out that there were
[03:25:57.560 --> 03:26:03.080]  hypodermic needles on mcveys trace that's it i do not allow drugs that allow
[03:26:03.080 --> 03:26:06.280]  paraphernalia nothing in my prison what's going on here two weeks later who's
[03:26:06.280 --> 03:26:08.120]  relieved he was transferred to another facility
[03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:11.880]  and that's how the japanese created their mind control assassin
[03:26:11.880 --> 03:26:16.600]  uh uh ninjas was drugs and sex but please continue
[03:26:16.600 --> 03:26:20.040]  well uh we see that uh they said that he was so drugged up that mcvey was so
[03:26:20.040 --> 03:26:22.840]  drugged up at that point that he would have admitted to assassinating
[03:26:22.840 --> 03:26:26.840]  abraham lincoln um then uh jolly west proje
[03:26:26.840 --> 03:26:30.360]  took over after that uh dr john smith now he is currently
[03:26:30.360 --> 03:26:34.200]  in in psychiatric department at guantanamo bay so again these guys are
[03:26:34.200 --> 03:26:37.560]  there's a constant and they admit guantanamo bay has a cia base on it
[03:26:37.560 --> 03:26:41.640]  where they do mind control study that i mean that's msnbc
[03:26:41.640 --> 03:26:47.000]  wow man this is amazing um and there's transcripts that show where jolly west
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:52.440]  is talking uh about working with jack ruby i mean he goes back that far
[03:26:52.440 --> 03:26:56.600]  um you know and and the the type of situation that jack ruby was going
[03:26:56.600 --> 03:26:59.400]  through in the the mental stress that he dealt with and comparing that with
[03:26:59.400 --> 03:27:03.080]  mcvey mcvey showed signs of uh post-traumatic
[03:27:03.080 --> 03:27:07.080]  stress uh i'm sorry gulf war syndrome prior to being deployed
[03:27:07.080 --> 03:27:11.960]  um dental visits i mean just an enormous number of dental visits in the
[03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:15.000]  military uh you know that that doesn't happen you know what
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:17.640]  were they doing with this guy it's that's where they knock you out you
[03:27:17.640 --> 03:27:21.400]  disappear a few days and all right and it's enough to post solid questions
[03:27:21.400 --> 03:27:24.440]  you know well the state police when they when he got pulled over they said he
[03:27:24.440 --> 03:27:28.440]  was just you know jolly hinger yeah go over what the cop
[03:27:28.440 --> 03:27:32.680]  said of him he was out of his gourd he was surprised to see that mcvey was
[03:27:32.680 --> 03:27:36.040]  packing heat and he had uh several magazines of
[03:27:36.040 --> 03:27:40.440]  rounds and on on himself and in the car but the peculiar thing about charlie
[03:27:40.440 --> 03:27:42.920]  hangar a lot of folks don't realize it was his day off
[03:27:42.920 --> 03:27:46.680]  he's 62 miles outside of his precinct what in the world is charlie hangar
[03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:51.800]  doing zooming up by 35 going after in fact he didn't he wasn't chasing anybody
[03:27:51.800 --> 03:27:54.360]  in particular he was just cruising and he stopped mcvey
[03:27:54.360 --> 03:27:58.600]  for a speeding violation and then to find out his his tag was off uh he wasn't
[03:27:58.600 --> 03:28:01.720]  registered there was a lot of things that certainly posed a lot of questions
[03:28:01.720 --> 03:28:05.640]  number one charlie hangar wasn't supposed to be there so that's a huge red flag
[03:28:05.640 --> 03:28:10.120]  no chemical residue on mcvey at all no explosive residue they checked his ears
[03:28:10.120 --> 03:28:13.000]  and i mean nothing and of course the feds have grabbed all these
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:16.680]  surveillance tapes and and and fbi agents told the la times they've seen them
[03:28:16.680 --> 03:28:19.960]  it shows mcvey with these other men true the feds have these tapes they're
[03:28:19.960 --> 03:28:24.280]  saying they don't exist how many tapes did uh did they copy over
[03:28:24.280 --> 03:28:29.000]  580 tapes were actually uh actually copied and contracted for by the federal
[03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:33.560]  government uh there were survivors that sued for 24 the fbi lied
[03:28:33.560 --> 03:28:37.640]  said well they didn't exist and they said well we lied but here's another lie
[03:28:37.640 --> 03:28:42.040]  so out of a 580 tapes there were 120 of interest which means they had three
[03:28:42.040 --> 03:28:44.840]  copies of 120 tapes that's five times more than
[03:28:44.840 --> 03:28:47.720]  original amount that the local news talked to the fbi agents they say there's
[03:28:47.720 --> 03:28:51.000]  one from right over the truck and you can see john o number two of mcvey
[03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:54.440]  biggest dallas so all of these things this body of information
[03:28:54.440 --> 03:28:58.760]  literally comes at us by accident or by people that are conscientious
[03:28:58.760 --> 03:29:01.800]  uh sitting on it for several years and they come and say look we need to get
[03:29:01.800 --> 03:29:05.320]  this out what do you make of all these people that were in prison with him
[03:29:05.320 --> 03:29:09.400]  and uh terry nickles and others with the side affidavits that mcvey was like
[03:29:09.400 --> 03:29:12.440]  yeah i was in black ops we were setting up malicious
[03:29:12.440 --> 03:29:16.360]  i mean that fits with the mo we had their family was surprised mcvey's family
[03:29:16.360 --> 03:29:18.920]  was especially they said that he you know he worked for the government he wrote
[03:29:18.920 --> 03:29:21.480]  the letter saying that uh you know he was working for the cia
[03:29:21.480 --> 03:29:25.320]  smuggling uh drugs in uh so i mean they just assumed that he was
[03:29:25.320 --> 03:29:29.160]  he was black ops now this is on an fbi 302 witness statement it's bona fide
[03:29:29.160 --> 03:29:31.160]  people we're not pulling this stuff out of our ear
[03:29:31.160 --> 03:29:34.680]  this is documentation the federal stay there we got a long segment i'm gonna
[03:29:34.680 --> 03:29:38.280]  try to quit injection points there there's so many but let's go over who
[03:29:38.280 --> 03:29:42.200]  mcvey was let's go over what's admitted i mean i mean this guy
[03:29:42.200 --> 03:29:45.720]  and for all you black ops people out there you know they're gonna set you up
[03:29:45.720 --> 03:29:49.480]  too okay they they enjoy burning you remember the myac report they hate
[03:29:49.480 --> 03:29:55.320]  veterans they hate cops we're on the march the empires on the run

[03:34:29.160 --> 03:34:32.120]  all going to come out and then you see him on tv doing interviews just looks
[03:34:32.120 --> 03:34:36.040]  like he's bombed out of his mind looks like a complete drug addict on the
[03:34:36.040 --> 03:34:39.560]  side of the road and he's got the top mind control doctor living because
[03:34:39.560 --> 03:34:44.120]  cameron had died by then jolly and west there in you know shooting him up with
[03:34:44.120 --> 03:34:47.480]  this stuff i mean this is incredible well you know if they would just show
[03:34:47.480 --> 03:34:51.400]  us the tapes you know there's there's how many tapes that um uh jesse
[03:34:51.400 --> 03:34:55.240]  trinity i try to get jesse had contacted myself and a
[03:34:55.240 --> 03:34:58.440]  couple of the survivors member of the of the bombing committee and he says what
[03:34:58.440 --> 03:35:01.400]  locations should we ask for the tapes and we gave it to him he went to the
[03:35:01.400 --> 03:35:05.880]  federal government they obfuscated they delayed they gave him stuff of video
[03:35:05.880 --> 03:35:08.920]  footage of people walking in buildings two blocks away had nothing to do with
[03:35:08.920 --> 03:35:12.040]  the mirror building at all hallways and in the building next door i mean yeah
[03:35:12.040 --> 03:35:16.200]  this was a complete garbage and uh so he was able to get about 28 tapes but they
[03:35:16.200 --> 03:35:19.800]  were useless i told jessia says jesse they have 118 in their
[03:35:19.800 --> 03:35:22.360]  possession that we know of that they duplicated three
[03:35:22.360 --> 03:35:25.960]  and three copies of so we know that was as they say of interest
[03:35:25.960 --> 03:35:29.240]  ask for every single one of those tapes he didn't get them they say national
[03:35:29.240 --> 03:35:32.760]  security um they say that i saw that in the news and
[03:35:32.760 --> 03:35:36.920]  and papers national security on these videos because it's national security
[03:35:36.920 --> 03:35:40.280]  that the globalist blew that building up right
[03:35:40.280 --> 03:35:43.640]  and that's why we're calling the documentary a noble lie that's from
[03:35:43.640 --> 03:35:46.680]  plateaus the republic where it's the lie that the elite tell to maintain
[03:35:46.680 --> 03:35:50.120]  social harmony in their in their position you know because i mean there
[03:35:50.120 --> 03:35:53.800]  was just again it was so ridiculous they just keep perpetuating this lie
[03:35:53.800 --> 03:35:56.920]  and and expect people to believe it i guess you know national security it
[03:35:56.920 --> 03:35:59.400]  would be it would be against social harmony
[03:35:59.400 --> 03:36:03.240]  um if they would just show us the tapes you know it it would answer all the
[03:36:03.240 --> 03:36:07.560]  questions it would answer the john doe questions um you know as as far as who
[03:36:07.560 --> 03:36:10.520]  was in the truck let's go back before we get into that because we
[03:36:10.520 --> 03:36:14.840]  we left off of that who is mcvay i mean i mean this guy disappears out of the
[03:36:14.840 --> 03:36:17.720]  military he's showing up at all these militias all over the country
[03:36:17.720 --> 03:36:20.760]  he's telling family on black ops infiltrating militias
[03:36:20.760 --> 03:36:24.120]  he's telling others i'm bringing narcotics in for the government he was a
[03:36:24.120 --> 03:36:27.640]  sharpshooter in the u.s army during the first uh prison golf war in fact he was
[03:36:27.640 --> 03:36:30.840]  so good that he was on the security detail for a general short scoff which
[03:36:30.840 --> 03:36:34.760]  means you really have to get your numbers uh accuracy and everything and he was
[03:36:34.760 --> 03:36:37.880]  commended ironically enough he was giving a
[03:36:37.880 --> 03:36:41.080]  medal of commendation when he was in prison actually in the county jail in
[03:36:41.080 --> 03:36:44.840]  denver awaiting trial um that's how good he was the army was obligated to give
[03:36:44.840 --> 03:36:48.040]  him that medal after he got out um the fbl
[03:36:48.040 --> 03:36:52.040]  last track of him for well we know at least four months as as long as six
[03:36:52.040 --> 03:36:56.120]  months and that's when he turned up uh with the bill bean story up in uh
[03:36:56.120 --> 03:37:00.360]  south dakota or north dakota at uh let's see here was the national guard
[03:37:00.360 --> 03:37:03.080]  training base yeah were they actually training explosives
[03:37:03.080 --> 03:37:06.280]  so and there's clear video of him at the explosives base
[03:37:06.280 --> 03:37:09.320]  a year after he supposedly got the military and that that's all been vetted
[03:37:09.320 --> 03:37:13.160]  out by linguistics experts from the university of utah mr bean did a
[03:37:13.160 --> 03:37:16.280]  very good job superb job everything thorough research right there so that's
[03:37:16.280 --> 03:37:19.480]  ironclad um he had at least four different
[03:37:19.480 --> 03:37:23.320]  identities that we know of uh south dakota um driver's license
[03:37:23.320 --> 03:37:26.760]  michigan driver's license arizona driver's license and an arkansas driver's
[03:37:26.760 --> 03:37:30.360]  he's just like leah harvey oswald who is now has been declassified was
[03:37:30.360 --> 03:37:36.200]  at a cia base in uh japan and was allowed to infiltrate russia and
[03:37:36.200 --> 03:37:39.640]  then allowed to come back to the u.s i mean here are these spies you know
[03:37:39.640 --> 03:37:42.920]  shooting the president now the people that it's it's one thing to ask
[03:37:42.920 --> 03:37:45.720]  mcvey it's the people that he actually surrounds himself with andrea
[03:37:45.720 --> 03:37:49.320]  straussmeyer national from west germany dad's number three with a homicol
[03:37:49.320 --> 03:37:51.880]  administration traveling throughout the u.s with a
[03:37:51.880 --> 03:37:55.640]  expired visa for four years no gainful employment all of his credit card bills
[03:37:55.640 --> 03:37:59.400]  are being paid for come to find out he actually uh had the passcode to the
[03:37:59.400 --> 03:38:02.840]  federal building at downtown four worth while he's in trying to infiltrate
[03:38:02.840 --> 03:38:06.120]  these different militia groups both in texas and in oklahoma
[03:38:06.120 --> 03:38:09.080]  four weeks before oklahoma the city bombing happened he was literally
[03:38:09.080 --> 03:38:13.080]  kicked out of texas by the militia groups they actually scouted him going
[03:38:13.080 --> 03:38:15.400]  into the rear door of the federal court courthouse
[03:38:15.400 --> 03:38:19.960]  punching the keypad the security keypad 24 hours later they said look
[03:38:19.960 --> 03:38:23.160]  you got you got three days to get out of this the state or else we can't guarantee
[03:38:23.160 --> 03:38:26.920]  your safety where's he go elliom city in oklahoma unbelievable and that's got
[03:38:26.920 --> 03:38:29.960]  the southern prairie law center running it absolutely they're all over that like
[03:38:29.960 --> 03:38:33.880]  white on rice so anyway you wanted to talk about the tapes i guess we had
[03:38:33.880 --> 03:38:37.240]  other information on that well now we covered that i mean basically they're
[03:38:37.240 --> 03:38:40.280]  just that they if they just told us they caught on fire or something and be at
[03:38:40.280 --> 03:38:43.320]  least more believable but they just you know they're like well no uh
[03:38:43.320 --> 03:38:47.080]  they're that all of the tapes outside tapes in all the separate buildings
[03:38:47.080 --> 03:38:50.360]  through separate security systems all change their tapes at the same time
[03:38:50.360 --> 03:38:54.440]  you know it's it's absurd but we have fbi agents who told the la times and
[03:38:54.440 --> 03:38:58.280]  others because i've had these articles that they have seen the videos and it
[03:38:58.280 --> 03:39:01.720]  shows tim mcvay with john o number two secret service
[03:39:01.720 --> 03:39:05.000]  a memorandum actually two weeks after the bombing it's right there and that was
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:08.280]  actually entered in the state trial for terry nickles in march of
[03:39:08.280 --> 03:39:10.600]  two thousand and nickles is signed an affidavit saying
[03:39:10.600 --> 03:39:14.120]  and a mcvay was black ops yes he has no reason to make this stuff up
[03:39:14.120 --> 03:39:16.680]  terry has everything to lose and nothing to gain
[03:39:16.680 --> 03:39:19.160]  by that claim what about the new guy that i interviewed him he's not new he's
[03:39:19.160 --> 03:39:21.720]  been around for years but we were able to get the first interview and over a
[03:39:21.720 --> 03:39:26.680]  decade uh and uh mr cooper and he was saying
[03:39:26.680 --> 03:39:30.040]  uh that uh you know mcvay basically told him
[03:39:30.040 --> 03:39:34.120]  the same thing and they told him we won't execute you if you'll just shut up
[03:39:34.120 --> 03:39:37.160]  david paul hammer hammer hammer not good yeah that's right
[03:39:37.160 --> 03:39:41.000]  uh there's there's some very good information to support that again david
[03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:45.640]  has some solid info and wendy has been able to corroborate a lot of that yeah
[03:39:45.640 --> 03:39:49.560]  and chris was actually able to go out and and scout some locations that was
[03:39:49.560 --> 03:39:52.040]  talked about in the book that that there's no way
[03:39:52.040 --> 03:39:55.400]  that uh david paul hammer would have that knowledge of that unless
[03:39:55.400 --> 03:39:57.800]  someone that was there you know told him about it
[03:39:57.800 --> 03:40:01.080]  if i may preface this elix before i decided to really jump feet first into
[03:40:01.080 --> 03:40:04.760]  this project i took in fact debon is with me and we had a small film career
[03:40:04.760 --> 03:40:07.640]  literally toured five miles around the crime scene
[03:40:07.640 --> 03:40:10.680]  and we're trying to piece all of the stuff from the official story together
[03:40:10.680 --> 03:40:14.200]  didn't make any sense then we went back to what the committee had gathered in a
[03:40:14.200 --> 03:40:18.440]  572 page report the ogloma's uh bombing investigation committee
[03:40:18.440 --> 03:40:22.440]  okcbombing.net if you don't mind we'll uh plug yeah led by charles key
[03:40:22.440 --> 03:40:25.560]  unbelievable state rep so we went through that book over a matter of about
[03:40:25.560 --> 03:40:28.440]  four weeks and we're looking at all of these locations and we're literally
[03:40:28.440 --> 03:40:31.400]  painting a mosaic of yes this does make sense
[03:40:31.400 --> 03:40:34.520]  physically these guys the 12 perps and the additional six
[03:40:34.520 --> 03:40:37.320]  they may or may have not known that they're working for the government in
[03:40:37.320 --> 03:40:41.480]  various capacities they were at these locations and it was a
[03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:45.000]  at least four different groups working together in concert to make this thing go
[03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:49.240]  off it wasn't too low nuts driving a anfo truck above in front of the
[03:40:49.240 --> 03:40:52.200]  murrow building. How long will it take uh you know 30
[03:40:52.200 --> 03:40:55.880]  minutes or more for them to drive from that park in kansas to the
[03:40:55.880 --> 03:40:58.840]  location in oakland the city and by that point the
[03:40:58.840 --> 03:41:02.040]  money of nitrate fuel mixture goes inert they would have to stop it along the
[03:41:02.040 --> 03:41:06.840]  way and remixed it. The Arabs uh at least 3000 plus
[03:41:06.840 --> 03:41:10.840]  brought in by uh george bush senior and then a couple thousand by clinton
[03:41:10.840 --> 03:41:14.360]  the media investigating them claiming that they were connected in with some of
[03:41:14.360 --> 03:41:18.120]  these other people from your deep research is that a red herring because
[03:41:18.120 --> 03:41:22.040]  that looks like classic uh government ops where they just have all sorts of
[03:41:22.040 --> 03:41:25.800]  other operations coming in at the same time to create a fog of war.
[03:41:25.800 --> 03:41:29.720]  Yes it is and uh there were actually stunt doubles of mcvey that we know of
[03:41:29.720 --> 03:41:32.920]  there were two teams that carry this thing off one to actually do the dirty
[03:41:32.920 --> 03:41:36.360]  deed and of course mcvey and his useful idiots to take the fall.
[03:41:36.360 --> 03:41:39.240]  There were many concentric circles in in play.
[03:41:39.240 --> 03:41:42.760]  Exactly we we of course none of them know all of it I mean it's like the
[03:41:42.760 --> 03:41:47.400]  London 977 bombing clearly if you research that
[03:41:47.400 --> 03:41:50.440]  they hired these guys to be part of a drill they had the drill
[03:41:50.440 --> 03:41:54.440]  and uh they they blew them up on board the uh the bus and the train some of
[03:41:54.440 --> 03:41:58.120]  them got away it was even in the news at canary warf the police machine gun them
[03:41:58.120 --> 03:42:01.720]  and just said you didn't see that I mean it's so easy to do this stuff.
[03:42:01.720 --> 03:42:05.000]  It's it's amazing it just they run the same script and it is it's so
[03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:08.200]  disgusting and just it's appalling to see how they
[03:42:08.200 --> 03:42:12.040]  they pull this off. Continuing with the concentric team sorry.
[03:42:12.040 --> 03:42:16.600]  We have basically the two teams downtown there were at least
[03:42:16.600 --> 03:42:20.440]  12 individuals they recited as early as six o'clock that morning
[03:42:20.440 --> 03:42:24.040]  actually running jogging the route the escape routes they were going to take.
[03:42:24.040 --> 03:42:28.360]  Well at the same time the Oklahoma bomb squad is at the courthouse across from
[03:42:28.360 --> 03:42:32.760]  the mural building looking for explosives and they
[03:42:32.760 --> 03:42:36.520]  never found any there that's his reports eyewitness reports seeing
[03:42:36.520 --> 03:42:40.760]  that as early as what 6 a.m. 6 6 15 a.m. there was the Oklahoma County Sheriff's
[03:42:40.760 --> 03:42:45.320]  Department and the ATF actually doing a roadblock a bottleneck
[03:42:45.320 --> 03:42:49.720]  10 blocks away checking vehicles for incendiary devices and what about the
[03:42:49.720 --> 03:42:53.720]  head of the FBI anti-terrorism crew lying and saying he was in Dallas and
[03:42:53.720 --> 03:42:55.880]  then got a flight but then later it was proven
[03:42:55.880 --> 03:42:59.640]  credit card receipts he was there days before. Danny Colson drove up
[03:42:59.640 --> 03:43:03.000]  at least 18 hours before the credit card receipts at the embassy switch does
[03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:06.440]  cooperate that so we're not quite sure why he chose to as they say
[03:43:06.440 --> 03:43:09.640]  distort the truth but that's his his deal so the
[03:43:09.640 --> 03:43:13.800]  credibility right it was gone he I can't believe anything he says
[03:43:13.800 --> 03:43:18.120]  ironically Jen Arrino removed him from the case four days after the bombing
[03:43:18.120 --> 03:43:21.960]  because he had basically turned us his look I show up for work every day
[03:43:21.960 --> 03:43:25.160]  I'm supposed to do a good job on here I want to investigate this case correctly
[03:43:25.160 --> 03:43:28.360]  and she says no we don't need you on the team here we're bringing in another team
[03:43:28.360 --> 03:43:32.520]  to completely corrupt this. What about ATF because you had some of the
[03:43:32.520 --> 03:43:35.240]  emergency crews saying ATF was there in bomb gear
[03:43:35.240 --> 03:43:39.320]  and and and in their raid gear saying bandage me up I was on the ninth floor
[03:43:39.320 --> 03:43:42.280]  and they're like everybody it's on record that that thing was emptying and
[03:43:42.280 --> 03:43:45.640]  they weren't on the ninth floor the elevator was blown out that's right
[03:43:45.640 --> 03:43:49.480]  exactly in fact it was Dr. Chumley that told these guys to take a flying
[03:43:49.480 --> 03:43:52.040]  leave Tiffany Bible she was a paramedic
[03:43:52.040 --> 03:43:55.320]  she arrived four to five minutes after and they she said that there were
[03:43:55.320 --> 03:43:59.880]  agents in full full gear and then you've got other
[03:43:59.880 --> 03:44:03.640]  witnesses saying that they overheard the ATF say is this why we got the page not
[03:44:03.640 --> 03:44:07.160]  to come in today so I mean there there is a amount of evidence of
[03:44:07.160 --> 03:44:11.480]  foreknowledge the FBI evacuation of the building
[03:44:11.480 --> 03:44:14.920]  separate building that morning and it's because the very small part of the
[03:44:14.920 --> 03:44:17.560]  governments involved with foreign black ops and others
[03:44:17.560 --> 03:44:20.200]  that this does come out people always say well this stuff would come out of it
[03:44:20.200 --> 03:44:23.880]  was real it did come out yes and it's in fact it's out in full
[03:44:23.880 --> 03:44:27.240]  view right now and that's why we're able to assemble out of the information
[03:44:27.240 --> 03:44:31.000]  folks I can guarantee you right now you have never heard I'd say probably 70
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:34.680]  percent of this has never been posted on well I'll tell you what for your safety
[03:44:34.680 --> 03:44:38.520]  I mean obviously the film's coming out in the in the winter and I can't wait to
[03:44:38.520 --> 03:44:40.920]  carry it at info wars dot com and get it out to people
[03:44:40.920 --> 03:44:44.120]  so you guys are great researchers have done a lot of original work but for your
[03:44:44.120 --> 03:44:47.560]  own safety and for you know knowledge out there I know you've already released
[03:44:47.560 --> 03:44:50.360]  some of this footage it's so important tell people some of the new developments
[03:44:50.360 --> 03:44:54.680]  you've discovered well yeah we have over 10 hours of footage that hasn't been
[03:44:54.680 --> 03:44:58.200]  seen by the general public before and we and over a thousand photographs
[03:44:58.200 --> 03:45:01.880]  we've got excellent footage of the crater
[03:45:01.880 --> 03:45:05.480]  and it's completely offset from the large bite in the building and as general
[03:45:05.480 --> 03:45:09.240]  parton said that the building with the the
[03:45:09.240 --> 03:45:11.960]  first bomb would have been around the third floor
[03:45:11.960 --> 03:45:15.880]  well you can actually see I mean it's probably you know 30 40 feet offset
[03:45:15.880 --> 03:45:19.640]  from the the small crater where the car bomb was and then the floors are
[03:45:19.640 --> 03:45:22.600]  actually concave around the third floor so you
[03:45:22.600 --> 03:45:24.920]  could see where that was the biggest bite in the building
[03:45:24.920 --> 03:45:29.960]  where it blasted that out you had people said that they heard what sounded
[03:45:29.960 --> 03:45:32.440]  like a rifle shot a high-powered rifle shot
[03:45:32.440 --> 03:45:36.760]  which is it works the same way with the c4
[03:45:36.760 --> 03:45:40.200]  it wouldn't have been as loud of an explosion and that's where
[03:45:40.200 --> 03:45:43.560]  you hear all of the the survivors talk about rubble coming down
[03:45:43.560 --> 03:45:46.520]  people getting under their desks they had time to get under their desk and then
[03:45:46.520 --> 03:45:51.240]  the car bomb goes off outside yeah the bus tilts twice twice six
[03:45:51.240 --> 03:45:53.480]  blocks away 14 people were in that building had
[03:45:53.480 --> 03:45:57.480]  enough wear with all the cognitive ability to take cover that simply
[03:45:57.480 --> 03:46:00.840]  wouldn't have happened if they would have been hit just and you see the repeat
[03:46:00.840 --> 03:46:04.680]  with the feds they love to have their diversion
[03:46:04.680 --> 03:46:07.880]  you know the plane flies in then the buildings blow up
[03:46:07.880 --> 03:46:11.160]  and then no one notices the 47-story building not hit that falls in
[03:46:11.160 --> 03:46:13.560]  perfectly we interviewed the guy who was the deputy
[03:46:13.560 --> 03:46:16.040]  had emergency management he says yeah there were bodies
[03:46:16.040 --> 03:46:20.040]  you know they blew it up then he dies mysteriously but I mean it's the same
[03:46:20.040 --> 03:46:22.840]  thing here yeah real bombs go off diversionary
[03:46:22.840 --> 03:46:26.520]  truck bomb because the public's going to go well how do they get bombs inside
[03:46:26.520 --> 03:46:30.440]  I mean it's just sick how they're how their psychopathic brains work
[03:46:30.440 --> 03:46:33.960]  it's criminology they do the same stuff over and over again and the lack of
[03:46:33.960 --> 03:46:37.800]  humanity I mean the the children that were in the building well it's a gambit
[03:46:37.800 --> 03:46:41.560]  I mean when you understand the the the military officer mind
[03:46:41.560 --> 03:46:45.000]  and this goes back thousands of years they write about it you know let's say
[03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:48.360]  you're Alexander the Great or your Julius Caesar or somebody else if you
[03:46:48.360 --> 03:46:52.520]  send out a detachment to say 50 guys into a valley where you know
[03:46:52.520 --> 03:46:54.840]  an army is set but you want to draw them out and see their numbers
[03:46:54.840 --> 03:46:58.760]  you know your 50 guys are going to get cut off and killed but now your argument
[03:46:58.760 --> 03:47:02.200]  is that'll save a hundred thousand of your main army because now you've gotten
[03:47:02.200 --> 03:47:04.520]  that intel they justify the means and so the ends
[03:47:04.520 --> 03:47:08.760]  justifies the means that the noble lie and so America needs to take over the
[03:47:08.760 --> 03:47:11.640]  Arabs are dangerous we're going to blow these buildings and when we need a
[03:47:11.640 --> 03:47:15.160]  Pearl Harbor level event as the PNAC document said by the vice president
[03:47:15.160 --> 03:47:18.120]  right to get this done and it's the same thing Oklahoma City
[03:47:18.120 --> 03:47:21.400]  they've got their collectivist world government all these states were moving
[03:47:21.400 --> 03:47:24.120]  to get out of the UN and to declare detent amendment
[03:47:24.120 --> 03:47:26.200]  well we'll just blow the hell out of this building and blame it on the
[03:47:26.200 --> 03:47:28.040]  patriots and that's what they did within 10 minutes
[03:47:28.040 --> 03:47:31.080]  Bill Clinton said talk radio rush limbaugh it's your fault
[03:47:31.080 --> 03:47:34.360]  you know and they're already digging this this back up to uh demonize the
[03:47:34.360 --> 03:47:37.800]  renewed patriot movement in this country uh you know uh we've got a researcher
[03:47:37.800 --> 03:47:41.000]  Kay Beech is you know going to talk about the uh my
[03:47:41.000 --> 03:47:45.080]  acroport and the department of homeland security right-wing extremism lexicon
[03:47:45.080 --> 03:47:50.040]  and how they they use the the uh Oklahoma City bombing uh to to demonize
[03:47:50.040 --> 03:47:52.760]  the tea party it's like oh if you believe in supporting the
[03:47:52.760 --> 03:47:56.040]  Constitution and you oppose tyranny well you're you're a McVeigh
[03:47:56.040 --> 03:47:59.320]  you're one of those government haters oh no they say I'm a McVeigh
[03:47:59.320 --> 03:48:03.000]  and boy I tell you the southern probably law center in that in that uh
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:06.440]  chris matthew's documentary they call me by my first name oh alex we
[03:48:06.440 --> 03:48:09.880]  we're not saying he's going to cause violence but his followers are so so
[03:48:09.880 --> 03:48:13.240]  now I guess I'm I've never talked to these people but they're on a first
[03:48:13.240 --> 03:48:16.040]  name basis that's how much they're because I know they don't like it that I
[03:48:16.040 --> 03:48:18.600]  talk about how they were running up uh elliems city
[03:48:18.600 --> 03:48:21.960]  well we were doing the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing press
[03:48:21.960 --> 03:48:24.920]  conference at the same time there was a tea party gone going on outside at the
[03:48:24.920 --> 03:48:28.840]  in Oklahoma City and this is uh at the at the time that the there was a lot of
[03:48:28.840 --> 03:48:32.360]  talk about militias again and nobody was really even talking about they were
[03:48:32.360 --> 03:48:35.640]  talking about like a volunteer force to take uh take over because all the
[03:48:35.640 --> 03:48:38.200]  national guards deployed uh and we you know we have a lot of natural
[03:48:38.200 --> 03:48:40.840]  disaster in Oklahoma and they wanted to have some volunteers ready to go in and
[03:48:40.840 --> 03:48:44.520]  help and that's all that Charles several defense yeah 22 states have
[03:48:44.520 --> 03:48:48.040]  Charles Key wants a militia to attack the government and all of that
[03:48:48.040 --> 03:48:51.720]  information that came out was not on the tape it was not in the interview
[03:48:51.720 --> 03:48:54.920]  the editor took the the reporter story and completely
[03:48:54.920 --> 03:48:58.040]  fabricated all this stuff well no that's like Rand Paul
[03:48:58.040 --> 03:49:01.720]  you there's like a two second delay and he's like excuse me yes
[03:49:01.720 --> 03:49:05.320]  yes I can hear you oh you you agree with getting rid of the civil rights act
[03:49:05.320 --> 03:49:08.680]  uh no I don't and then they ran the headline he says get rid of the civil
[03:49:08.680 --> 03:49:13.720]  rights act I mean these are hoaxers sure these are slime bags these are crooks
[03:49:13.720 --> 03:49:16.440]  and it makes you wonder what they're cooking up because in the public mind
[03:49:16.440 --> 03:49:19.560]  they're trying to link you know patriot movement to
[03:49:19.560 --> 03:49:23.960]  militias to violence muslims yeah so now they're trying to say
[03:49:23.960 --> 03:49:27.080]  that the militias have linked up with al-qaeda
[03:49:27.080 --> 03:49:30.680]  can you believe those dirty american I mean yeah the good old boys are working
[03:49:30.680 --> 03:49:34.440]  with al-qaeda and when that's admitted CIA I mean folks they're getting ready to
[03:49:34.440 --> 03:49:37.640]  set you up the offshore banks know you're awake to what they've done and
[03:49:37.640 --> 03:49:40.920]  they're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on you unless we trump them with the
[03:49:40.920 --> 03:49:43.320]  info and let me tell you this isn't 15 years ago
[03:49:43.320 --> 03:49:47.720]  people know about false flag terror now it has entered the lexicon and that's
[03:49:47.720 --> 03:49:49.800]  why it's so important for this information to get out now because
[03:49:49.800 --> 03:49:52.440]  again they're using it to demonize the renewed patriot movement in this
[03:49:52.440 --> 03:49:55.400]  country you guys better hurry they could they could stage
[03:49:55.400 --> 03:50:02.680]  they could stage more uh stack attacks more oklahoma cities any day
[03:50:02.680 --> 03:50:06.440]  what we like to uh ask the viewers is to keep an open mind when this movie comes
[03:50:06.440 --> 03:50:09.080]  out and thanks in no small part to you alex I
[03:50:09.080 --> 03:50:11.800]  mean that you were definitely the support over the years you were the
[03:50:11.800 --> 03:50:14.680]  inspiration for us to continue on there were many times that we wanted to set
[03:50:14.680 --> 03:50:19.240]  this aside because literally cognitive and mentally it was so overwhelming it
[03:50:19.240 --> 03:50:22.680]  was so bad it was so deep it was so far down the rabbit hole
[03:50:22.680 --> 03:50:26.120]  but uh well when you know they're lying about that then
[03:50:26.120 --> 03:50:29.320]  then you start everything's a lie exactly well that's why we want to get the
[03:50:29.320 --> 03:50:31.720]  truth I mean I believe that bravery is contagious
[03:50:31.720 --> 03:50:35.400]  you know and I'm a member of we are change and I really take that to
[03:50:35.400 --> 03:50:37.720]  heart that we have to be the change that we want to see in the world it's an
[03:50:37.720 --> 03:50:40.920]  internal process we can change the outside by changing the inside
[03:50:40.920 --> 03:50:43.960]  stay there final five minutes let's talk about that on the other side
[03:50:43.960 --> 03:50:47.080]  because if we don't expose Oklahoma City we can't expose 9-11

[03:54:33.960 --> 03:54:36.520]  face life in jail and they're to be released
[03:54:36.520 --> 03:54:40.520]  because basically they're illegal aliens and god so this is your criminal
[03:54:40.520 --> 03:54:44.360]  government ladies and gentlemen who wants to take your right to defend your life
[03:54:44.360 --> 03:54:47.960]  and property just like england does uh holland
[03:54:47.960 --> 03:54:51.880]  oh vander newhoff uh is a really interesting
[03:54:51.880 --> 03:54:54.600]  fellow who i've interviewed before we'll have him back on when the film comes
[03:54:54.600 --> 03:54:57.960]  out but he's done deep research and he's part of the film team
[03:54:57.960 --> 03:55:01.720]  holland uh you've you've worked on the oklahoma city
[03:55:01.720 --> 03:55:05.320]  connections to oklahoma just real fast rattle some of those off
[03:55:05.320 --> 03:55:08.920]  well we have very a lot of concrete connections for one who's saying now
[03:55:08.920 --> 03:55:11.880]  who's saying he was named as john doe number two
[03:55:11.880 --> 03:55:15.640]  by jana davis at kflor tv in oklahoma filmed
[03:55:15.640 --> 03:55:19.080]  named specifically by witnesses on the scene as that was the man
[03:55:19.080 --> 03:55:22.760]  who was in the truck who's saying now who's saying he he later works for a
[03:55:22.760 --> 03:55:25.720]  boston's logan airport on the day of 9 11 he was a baggage handler
[03:55:25.720 --> 03:55:29.080]  and as i recall two of the hijackers floater there and that's where their
[03:55:29.080 --> 03:55:32.680]  luggage went through and they found incriminating will and so forth
[03:55:32.680 --> 03:55:36.920]  and then you have like melvin latimore a man who's uh original credit cards were
[03:55:36.920 --> 03:55:39.880]  used in the first world trade center bombing in 1993
[03:55:39.880 --> 03:55:44.360]  here's a known confederate of tim mcvee and friends of tigme vee in 1995 before
[03:55:44.360 --> 03:55:47.560]  the bombing and later on he was a roommate of the 20th
[03:55:47.560 --> 03:55:52.120]  hijacker the 20th uh 9 11 and the guy that got his head sawed off he was in
[03:55:52.120 --> 03:55:56.520]  an air base and loaned uh his laptop to one of the 9 11 people was on a bus in
[03:55:56.520 --> 03:55:59.800]  oklahoma city and loaned his laptop to one of the hijackers
[03:55:59.800 --> 03:56:03.560]  who used to email the 20th brought a bus actually loaned it to someone an
[03:56:03.560 --> 03:56:07.480]  unknown person who used to email the 20th hijacker in minnesota
[03:56:07.480 --> 03:56:11.400]  but this is like in in year 2000 i mean they did have wireless access on buses
[03:56:11.400 --> 03:56:14.920]  back then i don't think they even have it now the point is this is a spy nest
[03:56:14.920 --> 03:56:18.120]  yeah so i mean there was there was at least one researcher
[03:56:18.120 --> 03:56:20.920]  researcher who appeared before the 9 11 commission to testify that norman
[03:56:20.920 --> 03:56:24.680]  oklahoma was home to an al-qaeda cell prior to 9 11 well no one's ever been
[03:56:24.680 --> 03:56:28.280]  prosecuted or rested in this cell so obviously what was going on there may
[03:56:28.280 --> 03:56:31.640]  have been some kind of logistic logistics or support cell going on
[03:56:31.640 --> 03:56:34.520]  but there were a lot of things going on and the only way to view all of these
[03:56:34.520 --> 03:56:38.760]  events uh world trade center 93 oakland city 9 11 is that it's
[03:56:38.760 --> 03:56:41.400]  it's they're not isolated they are connected they use them the same people
[03:56:41.400 --> 03:56:44.840]  they use the same so p's the same cover-up methods
[03:56:44.840 --> 03:56:48.200]  they disregard the videotapes the videotapes of the pentagon we've never
[03:56:48.200 --> 03:56:51.480]  seen a plane crashing into the pentagon um you know we've never seen the
[03:56:51.480 --> 03:56:54.920]  videotapes what happened for the mirror building they wire a building fly a
[03:56:54.920 --> 03:56:57.960]  plane in wire building bomb a truck it's not
[03:56:57.960 --> 03:57:00.360]  bad enough that they blow up a truck bomb outside a building that they fly a
[03:57:00.360 --> 03:57:03.480]  plane in the building they got a wire the building with explosives to increase
[03:57:03.480 --> 03:57:07.000]  the body count the same so p and in less than one of the
[03:57:07.000 --> 03:57:10.200]  points about this movie is unless we confront the people are doing this
[03:57:10.200 --> 03:57:12.440]  bring them justice this is going to keep on going
[03:57:12.440 --> 03:57:15.080]  it's going to keep on happening and each time it's going to get worse how did
[03:57:15.080 --> 03:57:19.240]  you get involved in this um i'm from oklahoma i started
[03:57:19.240 --> 03:57:23.400]  research in the case and i started doing some research on my own putting a
[03:57:23.400 --> 03:57:26.600]  handprinted newsletter that would hand out and i met chris emory at an event
[03:57:26.600 --> 03:57:28.280]  where he's handing out copies of final report
[03:57:28.280 --> 03:57:31.160]  september of 05 we started to collaborate we started collaborating
[03:57:31.160 --> 03:57:34.920]  other conferences uh truth conferences low power fms
[03:57:34.920 --> 03:57:38.520]  radio shows and this is uh just another step in trying to expose the truth
[03:57:38.520 --> 03:57:41.560]  that's been an honor it's been you know this
[03:57:41.560 --> 03:57:44.520]  meeting chris really sent me on the path to find the work finding the right
[03:57:44.520 --> 03:57:48.040]  thing to do here and that's holland o vander new and hoff
[03:57:48.040 --> 03:57:50.360]  pronounce a right then didn't know and hoff vanden
[03:57:50.360 --> 03:57:53.480]  doing hoff i always get names wrong here it's all right
[03:57:53.480 --> 03:57:56.040]  well it's always good to have you on i had john what two three years ago about
[03:57:56.040 --> 03:57:58.760]  three or four years ago and when i post one of my first articles about the
[03:57:58.760 --> 03:58:01.800]  connections between i love them now that was a good story
[03:58:01.800 --> 03:58:05.080]  by may if we have a second i want to give a special mention to devon winner
[03:58:05.080 --> 03:58:07.640]  director photography and our production coordinator
[03:58:07.640 --> 03:58:11.080]  devon has actually followed a lot of your work for the last seven eight years
