[01:00.700 --> 01:05.740]  really try to supercharge a movement for liberty but to call for citizens and
[01:05.740 --> 01:10.100]  activists to try to add the type of hype to it that we saw with the State
[01:10.100 --> 01:15.880]  Department manufactured Coney 2012 so today and I haven't announced this until

[07:08.040 --> 07:11.640]  in a real meltdown non hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or
[07:11.640 --> 07:15.000]  gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.800]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at
[07:18.800 --> 07:23.240]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non hybrid seeds they
[07:23.240 --> 07:28.280]  call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient

[08:08.840 --> 08:33.040]  welcome my friends welcome to this live worldwide transmission it is Wednesday
[08:33.040 --> 08:40.560]  the 11th day of April 2012 let me just give you a breakdown of what's coming
[08:40.560 --> 08:48.200]  up today first off director writer TV host researcher Sean Stone has put
[08:48.200 --> 08:52.480]  together with our office a video that will be premiering here in about an
[08:52.480 --> 08:57.640]  hour and a half today calling for the impeachment of Obama and launching an
[08:57.640 --> 09:03.280]  impeachment movement for 2012 to say to the globalist we will punish your
[09:03.280 --> 09:11.320]  minion we will punish your frontman because that will be a rebuke of their
[09:11.320 --> 09:16.120]  entire system and everything they've done and an even bigger devastating
[09:16.120 --> 09:19.840]  victory if we can impeach Obama and the rumblings have begun legislation was
[09:19.840 --> 09:24.840]  introduced over a month ago by Congressman Jones as all of this moves
[09:24.840 --> 09:29.000]  forward we have a chance but even if we're not able to impeach him we
[09:29.000 --> 09:39.120]  publicly impeach him in the court of public opinion and so we're going to
[09:39.280 --> 09:51.240]  release this video coming up in an hour and a half so that is coming up today in
[09:51.240 --> 10:00.560]  about an hour and a half if you want to take action this is a big way to do it
[10:00.560 --> 10:05.520]  and to list all the unconstitutional things that Obama has been doing
[10:05.520 --> 10:09.480]  launching wars without congressional approving then telling Congress when they
[10:09.480 --> 10:16.240]  don't approve or give approval under law under the Constitution Obama says I
[10:16.240 --> 10:26.400]  don't need to get your approval he comes out and says I get the approval from the
[10:26.400 --> 10:32.800]  United Nations and if this goes unchallenged it sets a precedent and
[10:32.800 --> 10:35.560]  that's what the globalists are doing with all their lawyers is they're setting
[10:35.560 --> 10:39.280]  precedents that hey we're going to strip search you hey we're going to arrest you
[10:39.280 --> 10:42.920]  for no reason hey we're going to federalize everything and set up
[10:42.920 --> 10:47.120]  bulletproof checkpoints on all the highways hey we're going to give waivers
[10:47.120 --> 10:52.160]  to the illegal aliens and give them green cards and let them commit violent
[10:52.160 --> 10:56.120]  acts and release them from jail but citizens we're going to take your
[10:56.120 --> 10:59.000]  children from you when you don't vaccinate them even though there's no
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.960]  law you've got to vaccinate and we're going to take your private property and
[11:03.960 --> 11:08.200]  hand it over to private interest under the guise of the environment and we're
[11:08.200 --> 11:13.200]  going to fill your vaccines full of cancer viruses and we're going to raise
[11:13.200 --> 11:18.400]  your taxes and then spend it on corporate welfare and laugh in your face
[11:18.400 --> 11:23.440]  while we arm to the teeth with drones and illegal surveillance and the NSA
[11:23.440 --> 11:26.760]  watching everybody illegally and we're going to announce we're doing it
[11:26.760 --> 11:30.040]  illegally and we're going to announce we're torturing people including
[11:30.040 --> 11:34.080]  children sexually in front of their parents and there's nothing you're
[11:34.080 --> 11:39.600]  going to do about it do you got it that is an attempt to fully break our will a
[11:39.600 --> 11:44.480]  psychological warfare operation the good news is it's not working it works on
[11:44.480 --> 11:49.560]  small groups of people completely other people are angry and awake but they're
[11:49.560 --> 11:55.280]  passive and then there's a minority the majority are somewhat awake but passive
[11:55.280 --> 11:59.040]  and feel powerless we've got to show them the power they have but there is a
[11:59.040 --> 12:05.040]  large minority I say over 20% who really knows that we have power understands
[12:05.040 --> 12:09.240]  the score and who understand we've got to resist this it's going to be much
[12:09.240 --> 12:14.200]  worse to keep our heads down and just hope somebody else gets picked on we are
[12:14.200 --> 12:20.160]  not a school of fish where they all congregate together hoping that if a
[12:20.160 --> 12:26.320]  predator attacks that it'll be somebody else or hoping that well if there's 50
[12:26.320 --> 12:30.400]  fish that means there's a hundred eyes and they're looking at all directions for
[12:30.400 --> 12:34.720]  a predator so some of us can eat while the other ones are watching we're not
[12:34.720 --> 12:40.520]  birds we're not fish okay congregating together and just going along with
[12:40.520 --> 12:44.200]  whatever the mainstream media says and just trusting in the system is not
[12:44.200 --> 12:49.840]  going to protect us it's been designed to to distract us and divert us from the
[12:49.840 --> 12:54.440]  real world going on around us the globalist want us to be the dumb animals
[12:54.440 --> 12:59.920]  they say we are that's really the heart of this we just stop going along with
[12:59.920 --> 13:06.520]  what the system says we are and be who we truly are powerful creative dynamic
[13:06.520 --> 13:11.760]  creatures made in the image of the creator of the universe and even if you
[13:11.760 --> 13:16.400]  don't believe in God or or things so advanced that we can't even comprehend
[13:16.400 --> 13:20.640]  it even if you're stupid enough to not know that all the mathematical equations
[13:20.640 --> 13:28.960]  and top physicists all say yes this was built I mean when did it all start what
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.800]  did it come from all those questions even if you're that ignorant you've got
[13:32.800 --> 13:41.080]  to know you are of the universe you were of the timelessness that is creation
[13:41.080 --> 13:47.640]  and you're part of something big and you're special and you are in the middle
[13:47.640 --> 14:00.960]  of something amazing now let me go ahead and just just just try to tell you
[14:00.960 --> 14:10.480]  what's coming up this story came to our attention after he died it is a crime
[14:10.480 --> 14:15.320]  scene murder investigation but those who are the suspects are running the
[14:15.320 --> 14:24.960]  investigation state ceases property under green zoning laws terrorizes man to
[14:24.960 --> 14:32.160]  death Paul Joseph Watson Alex Jones a gen 21's eco fascism bears its teeth and
[14:32.160 --> 14:35.600]  Mike Adams covered this yesterday and now we have more developments this
[14:35.600 --> 14:46.040]  gentleman in Roswell Georgia continued to win in court with his grandfathered
[14:46.040 --> 14:52.200]  small private chicken farm on his property but the city that an annex the
[14:52.200 --> 14:57.400]  area years before in a what five six year battle kept coming after him even
[14:57.400 --> 15:01.080]  though he kept winning then somebody poisoned all his chickens finally they
[15:01.080 --> 15:05.840]  sent police and the house blew up kind of like they said the Davidians blew
[15:05.840 --> 15:09.680]  themselves up and later it came out of course the feds and machine gun them and
[15:09.680 --> 15:15.600]  burned them alive inside the flitter footage shows all that and so they have
[15:15.600 --> 15:20.360]  won and of course it turns out years ago they designated his property as a
[15:20.360 --> 15:28.640]  park as a green zone that that that was gonna be theirs for an agenda 21 green
[15:28.640 --> 15:32.600]  zone and of course that's just a placeholder until they end up in every
[15:32.600 --> 15:36.680]  case that I've seen across the world so standard criminal handbook take the
[15:36.680 --> 15:41.400]  property and sell it to their friends show Andrew words I thought we ought to
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.760]  later play the little Wordsworth clip from the Twilight Zone episode that we
[15:46.760 --> 15:52.760]  play quite often where he's like words Mr. Wordsworth words you are pathetic you
[15:52.760 --> 15:58.160]  are nothing and I guess they showed him didn't they and you read the story it's
[15:58.160 --> 16:04.360]  just standard operating petty power tripping boss hog behavior and then as
[16:04.360 --> 16:10.720]  you to the federal level it's boss hogs with nuclear weapons and he's dead now
[16:10.720 --> 16:15.960]  in his property the property that they well he had a mortgage on through
[16:15.960 --> 16:20.480]  another lady and that'll now be transferred over to the kingpins another
[16:20.480 --> 16:25.240]  victory they're conquerors they're militarized the country's theirs and
[16:25.240 --> 16:32.160]  worldwide is 21 is a standardized zoning system to come because they found it
[16:32.160 --> 16:36.600]  they give you an excuse first they make things that are legal illegal but give
[16:36.600 --> 16:40.840]  you a license well you can still do to get permission and then they just stop
[16:40.840 --> 16:46.280]  even following their own regulations I saw cases last week in three different
[16:46.280 --> 16:51.600]  states where they now sees in some cases even middle-class people's children
[16:51.600 --> 16:56.520]  usually they just pray on poor folks they think can't defend themselves totally
[16:56.520 --> 17:02.640]  predatory that's what criminals do just like predators prey on children because
[17:02.640 --> 17:07.640]  they think they can't defend themselves they they size up their quarry and then
[17:07.640 --> 17:10.480]  they take the newborn baby because they can get hundreds of thousands for it
[17:10.480 --> 17:14.400]  especially with blonde-haired blue-eyed look out or black-haired blue-eyed look
[17:14.400 --> 17:18.320]  out that that's what they got the top bounties on with these adoption systems
[17:18.320 --> 17:23.560]  of course the parents don't know where they came from and they don't care but a
[17:23.560 --> 17:30.320]  lot of bad karma comes along with that lot of bad mojo whatever you want to
[17:30.320 --> 17:37.440]  call it report you so comes around goes around but expanding on that in every
[17:37.440 --> 17:41.840]  authoritarian state is obsessed with taking children there's no law but they
[17:41.840 --> 17:46.600]  do it they've got criminal police criminal hospitals all in a giant
[17:46.600 --> 17:52.920]  criminal operation that's the essence of caring because well the state says so no
[17:52.920 --> 17:56.120]  judge no jury they're now grabbing children without even having the CPS go

[35:25.360 --> 35:33.120]  137 cesium 137 release of the Chernobyl accident as estimated by the U.S.
[35:33.120 --> 35:40.920]  and National Council on radiation protection and this is all confirmed
[35:40.920 --> 35:44.160]  mankind moon at the UN these are these are internal reports with their public
[35:44.160 --> 35:48.160]  this is not on the news our people dig around and find this stuff said it is no
[35:48.160 --> 35:52.560]  exaggeration to say the fate of Japan and the whole world depends on number
[35:52.560 --> 35:57.600]  four reactor this is what's being said behind the scenes in public reports but
[35:57.600 --> 36:04.360]  no news is covering it except mfo wars.com and a few others this is the
[36:04.360 --> 36:08.600]  type of stuff is in my stack every day I don't even get to I mean this was out
[36:08.600 --> 36:15.200]  last Friday I didn't even cover it roughly 85 times the amount of C.S. 137
[36:15.200 --> 36:24.840]  alone that's not cutting all the other stuff and again they've got top scientists
[36:24.840 --> 36:28.200]  and letters to mankind moon it is no exaggeration to say that the fate of
[36:28.200 --> 36:33.160]  Japan and the whole world depends on number four reactor this is confirmed by
[36:33.160 --> 36:39.680]  the most reliable experts like Dr. Arnie Gunderson and Dr. Fukima Cody he wrote
[36:39.680 --> 36:45.560]  to mankind moon the world has been made so fragile and vulnerable the role of
[36:45.560 --> 36:48.840]  the United Nations is increasingly vital so this is somebody who thinks
[36:48.840 --> 36:52.640]  they're gonna help somebody they're too busy stealing and murdering I wish the
[36:52.640 --> 36:57.680]  best of luck in your noble mission no word yet if this situation even
[36:57.680 --> 37:03.280]  registers on the UN radar it did it does the UN's made statements on it
[37:03.280 --> 37:07.080]  reissued this but there's a whole bunch of government experts and others in
[37:07.080 --> 37:13.320]  their industry experts warning people this is pretty big news and again we're
[37:13.320 --> 37:17.360]  gonna relaunch this phone system because what it does every day at the start of
[37:17.360 --> 37:25.120]  the show it's got to be relaunched because it's it shuts down and then the
[37:25.120 --> 37:31.680]  phone system is unable to make it through and then we have to do it every
[37:31.680 --> 37:36.560]  time at gearing like we just did so there you go again toll-free number to
[37:36.560 --> 37:45.860]  join us 800-25-992-31 so there you have it army stockpiling anti-radiation
[37:45.860 --> 37:50.520]  pills to protect against Fukushima fallout defense logistics agency sites
[37:50.520 --> 37:56.480]  ongoing crisis in Japan as reasons behind bulk purchases the troops support
[37:56.480 --> 38:00.960]  branch of the defense logistics agency has decided to replenish its stockpiles
[38:00.960 --> 38:05.240]  of anti-radiation pills side of the ongoing crisis at Fukushima and the
[38:05.240 --> 38:09.120]  potential for nuclear fallout as the primary reason behind the bulk
[38:09.120 --> 38:16.040]  purchase according to the solicitation of the fed biz ops.gov website the DLA is
[38:16.040 --> 38:20.920]  looking to finalize the purchase of $400,000 worth of potassium iodide pills
[38:20.920 --> 38:26.080]  which work by helping the body's thyroid gland block cancer causing radio
[38:26.080 --> 38:35.400]  iodines that are released during a Fukushima type crisis and again it's
[38:35.400 --> 38:44.080]  already released conservatively 70 plus percent or 70 plus times what Chernobyl
[38:44.080 --> 38:49.320]  did in 86 for reactors all bigger blowing up leaking and this time it's
[38:49.320 --> 38:52.840]  like drink the milk eat the food in the area everything's healthy oh people are
[38:52.840 --> 38:57.560]  dying well they're mentally ill oh your teeth are falling out your child just
[38:57.560 --> 39:03.920]  collapsed dead from heart failures what the radiation does no problem hey 14
[39:03.920 --> 39:08.720]  times increase in birth defects in Fallujah many time increase in our trips
[39:08.720 --> 39:16.920]  so why sit down and shut up radiation is good for you that's the crux that run
[39:16.920 --> 39:21.360]  our government the Goldman Sachs JP Morgan types that make 40 to 1 bets
[39:21.360 --> 39:26.120]  like MF global former head of the Goldman Sachs John Corzine caught line to
[39:26.120 --> 39:30.400]  Congress caught ordering the money stolen and he's still not in trouble five
[39:30.400 --> 39:34.800]  and a half months in because they're setting the precedent we're gonna
[39:34.800 --> 39:38.080]  grow up your children we're gonna forcibly give them shots even though
[39:38.080 --> 39:43.240]  there's no law and it's illegal we're gonna launch wars without congressional
[39:43.240 --> 39:47.360]  approval under you in command and we're gonna set up highway checkpoints and
[39:47.360 --> 39:51.800]  take your blood and forcibly inoculate you how's that sound
[39:57.920 --> 40:04.200]  I mean people like that sounds crazy Stalin killing tens of millions of
[40:04.200 --> 40:07.000]  people just because he liked to do it even though they weren't resisting
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.960]  there's famous communiques back to linen and then Stalin we can look them up
[40:10.960 --> 40:16.280]  we've covered him here on air from the NKVD in the 20s 30s 40s rather the 50s
[40:16.280 --> 40:20.200]  and they'd be in Ukraine Poland and they'd say okay we've arrested or killed
[40:20.200 --> 40:26.080]  half the village what do we do just keep killing okay but yeah these people
[40:26.080 --> 40:29.280]  are all basically slaves are ready to grow food do whatever we want doesn't
[40:29.280 --> 40:32.960]  matter I want more terror those are letters from linen particularly just
[40:32.960 --> 40:38.880]  kill more people I mean look at all the other cultures look at all the other
[40:38.880 --> 40:42.400]  tyrannies we've seen good but these crazy men who always wear black
[40:42.400 --> 40:46.840]  uniforms and always have the military around them it's all about power it's
[40:46.840 --> 40:50.000]  not enough to have all the mistresses and the money in the palaces they like
[40:50.000 --> 40:55.760]  to see buildings burn and children die and we have let them get control here
[40:55.760 --> 41:00.640]  and now they're building up a giant military against us and militarizing
[41:00.640 --> 41:04.560]  the police and the public knows it so they're buying five six seven million
[41:04.560 --> 41:11.520]  guns a month the corporate media is trying to hype up a race war right now
[41:11.520 --> 41:17.760]  publicly issuing fake edited audio of Zimmerman Justice Department hyping it
[41:17.760 --> 41:21.680]  the the Attorney General the same guy caught shipping guns into Mexico drugs
[41:21.680 --> 41:26.160]  back in the US speaks to the Al Sharpton group today basically hyping it up so
[41:26.160 --> 41:31.360]  they may they may go arrest Zimmerman our word is from Patrick Hinnison who
[41:31.360 --> 41:35.280]  talked to folks in the prosecutor's office and now I heard rumblings of it
[41:35.280 --> 41:39.480]  this morning on Fox radio that in the next 72 hours they're gonna announce a
[41:39.480 --> 41:42.520]  big announcement they got to get the police ready Zimmerman's been told to
[41:42.520 --> 41:48.320]  get out of town and that they're not going to be in dining Zimmerman because
[41:48.320 --> 41:53.320]  there's four witnesses the Trayvon Martin was on top of him beating him
[41:53.320 --> 41:58.960]  including two of them are black you never see that on the news I saw it one
[41:58.960 --> 42:04.320]  time on ABC News the black neighbor going yeah I saw the guy in the hoodie the
[42:04.320 --> 42:10.920]  gray hoodie on top the other guy in the red shirt punch it in the system has
[42:10.920 --> 42:15.080]  just chosen this now to get everybody fighting with each other so government
[42:15.080 --> 42:22.560]  can play the part of the referee ordered out of chaos destabilization
[42:22.560 --> 42:27.320]  meanwhile they're fighting to keep reactor four from completely melting
[42:27.320 --> 42:33.200]  down and blowing up and spewing out more radiation than it already has one
[42:33.200 --> 42:39.560]  deadly isotope alone cesium or is it cesium 137 it would be estimated to be
[42:39.560 --> 42:45.440]  at least 85 times the amount put out by Chernobyl which the UN says killed over
[42:45.440 --> 42:50.280]  a million people since 1986 and created giant dead zones and again where's the
[42:50.280 --> 42:57.200]  wind go right across the Pacific into the United States the West Coast the
[42:57.200 --> 43:05.360]  divine wind the kamikaze it blows across China and then across Japan out
[43:05.360 --> 43:08.880]  to the Pacific that's where the word kamikaze comes from there wasn't a
[43:08.880 --> 43:13.760]  Chinese invasion you look it up I forget how many thousands of years ago guys
[43:13.760 --> 43:18.080]  look up Chinese invasion of Japan Chinese naval invasion of Japan
[43:18.080 --> 43:23.320]  destroyed by typhoon give me the year in the dynasty I forget the names and
[43:23.320 --> 43:27.440]  that's why they call their pilots flying into our ships the kamikaze just a
[43:27.440 --> 43:32.120]  little historical factoid was here's this giant fleet it was Kubla Khan
[43:32.120 --> 43:37.400]  wasn't it he'd already taken over most of Asia and there were thousands of ships
[43:37.400 --> 43:43.840]  about to land they outnumbered the samurai over a hundred to one and here
[43:43.840 --> 43:48.320]  came a typhoon right over Japan destroying the fleet they've now found
[43:48.320 --> 43:52.400]  the other remains of the ships Mongol invasion of Japan the Mongol invasion of
[43:52.400 --> 43:58.960]  Japan of 1274 that's like 800 years ago to 1281 or major military efforts
[43:58.960 --> 44:03.240]  undertaken by Kubla Khan my memory serves to conquer the Japanese islands
[44:03.240 --> 44:10.200]  after the submission of Korea to vassal serfdom that's us under the bankers we
[44:10.200 --> 44:13.720]  are vassal serfs of Goldman Sachs through full fraud the minute you wake up to
[44:13.720 --> 44:16.800]  that and recognize the national security state homeland security is the
[44:16.800 --> 44:19.880]  criminal receivership takeover arm is the minute you begin to regain the
[44:19.880 --> 44:25.840]  liberty of the 1776 Republic anyways continuing let's go back to it despite
[44:25.840 --> 44:33.520]  their ultimate failure the invasion attempts are the came and read that from
[44:33.520 --> 44:39.320]  this distance macro historical importance yeah because they set a limit on
[44:39.320 --> 44:47.160]  Mongol expansion and rank a nation defining events in Japanese history the
[44:47.160 --> 44:50.800]  Japanese were successful in part because the Mongols lost up to 75% of their
[44:50.800 --> 44:57.480]  troops and supplies both times on the ocean as a result of major storms the
[44:57.480 --> 45:01.920]  invasions are referred to in many works of fiction and of the earliest events of
[45:01.920 --> 45:09.080]  which the word kamikaze or divine wind is widely used with the expectation of
[45:09.080 --> 45:13.440]  the occupation of Japan at the end of World War two that was a divine wind of
[45:13.440 --> 45:18.760]  fire bombs these failed invasions attempts are the closest Japan has come
[45:18.760 --> 45:25.560]  to being conquered by a foreign power in the last 1500 years okay thank you I'll
[45:25.560 --> 45:31.120]  go to your calls now the point is that divine wind is blowing scores of radio
[45:31.120 --> 45:39.080]  act radioactive goodies plutonium uranium because even though those are
[45:39.080 --> 45:46.280]  heavy elements they're getting caught on spiders and spider webs and bug parts
[45:46.280 --> 45:50.240]  and pieces of lint because you know you go up in the upper atmosphere it's just
[45:50.240 --> 45:57.080]  filled but they found multi thousand year old bugs at 50,000 feet you can look
[45:57.080 --> 46:00.680]  this up they fly around universities you with aircraft with big scoops on the
[46:00.680 --> 46:05.520]  front of the plane and it just scoops up I don't want to exaggerate but in some
[46:05.520 --> 46:09.680]  cases really old stuff and a lot more than a few thousand years look it up
[46:09.680 --> 46:13.520]  yourself I could do that we don't have time for any more factoiding and the
[46:13.520 --> 46:17.120]  point is there's all these light things there's even a piece of paper it's in a
[46:17.120 --> 46:23.040]  shopping bag in the sky like a kite and just keeps going well there are billions
[46:23.040 --> 46:27.360]  of things every year from Japan that's a conservative number that blow across and
[46:27.360 --> 46:33.000]  land over here that's why they used their own primitive drones
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.960]  firebomb blimps and firebomb balloons they would send over to try to start
[46:37.960 --> 46:42.480]  wildfires in the United States during World War two it wasn't like the V1 or
[46:42.480 --> 46:51.360]  V6 of the Germans that they rained down on England but you're getting a bird's eye
[46:51.360 --> 46:54.560]  view into my brain I'm just constantly thinking about different data just love
[46:54.560 --> 46:59.400]  information and got all this other incredible news I don't even scratch the
[46:59.400 --> 47:09.000]  surface yet quake off Indonesia triggers tsunami alert but thank God it did not
[47:09.000 --> 47:14.800]  cause a big tsunami that could have drenched the island nation of Indonesia
[47:14.800 --> 47:24.200]  or Sumatra for that matter or even hit some of the other surrounding countries
[47:24.200 --> 47:28.720]  millions breathe cyberleaf after tsunami alert is looked at following double
[47:28.720 --> 47:33.360]  quake that spread panic from Indonesia to India let's go ahead and go to some
[47:33.360 --> 47:40.560]  phone calls here let's talk to Carol or Carl in Oregon go ahead
[47:40.560 --> 47:46.360]  hello there my big brother how you doing buddy big brother wow little big
[47:46.360 --> 47:50.160]  brother I think I think you're watching and listen to me I'm not watching you
[47:50.160 --> 47:57.240]  but I hear you my friend no God bless you today Alex I it's strange how God
[47:57.240 --> 48:01.480]  answers prayers just a few months ago I was thinking by you know Alex looks
[48:01.480 --> 48:04.200]  like he's gone through so much stress that he's put on a lot of weight and I
[48:04.200 --> 48:07.120]  thought you know I'm just gonna pray for him that that he's able to continue this
[48:07.120 --> 48:11.640]  fight keep on going and sure enough yeah this gentleman come by by the name of
[48:11.640 --> 48:15.840]  Ben Fuchs that introduced these products to you and sure enough you know
[48:15.840 --> 48:18.760]  the answer is strange how God just answers prayers like that it's yeah well
[48:18.760 --> 48:23.160]  to be clear it was Ted Anderson and Michael's whirling a year and a half ago
[48:23.160 --> 48:28.920]  told me I ought to get on the longevity stuff and then I got it knew it was good
[48:28.920 --> 48:32.520]  but never really did it full-time and had a little bit of an effect and then
[48:32.520 --> 48:37.560]  Aaron Dykes started listening to Ben Fuchs on Genesis and started actually
[48:37.560 --> 48:41.760]  following it and hearing the interviews and he's now lost exactly 90 pounds he
[48:41.760 --> 48:45.480]  was telling me last week it is unbelievable he looks like a college
[48:45.480 --> 48:52.560]  prep I tell you he is he is something else yeah let me tell you about my
[48:52.560 --> 48:57.480]  story that I had because you were speaking a couple of days ago about the
[48:57.480 --> 49:02.560]  damages and problems yeah with SSRIs I had my own personal horror story the
[49:02.560 --> 49:07.280]  damages I just a recap I was mentioning that the guy that had no criminal record
[49:07.280 --> 49:15.760]  computer programmer who was acting strangely out of his mind he was on one
[49:15.760 --> 49:21.120]  of the psychotropic known to be particularly bad to cause this Xanax and
[49:21.120 --> 49:27.920]  same thing with the guy that shot the 18 people over in Iraq and I'm not saying
[49:27.920 --> 49:31.680]  they shouldn't get in some trouble but the point is they're on a hallucinogenic
[49:31.680 --> 49:36.280]  mind-altering substance that causes chemical imbalances it's on the insert
[49:36.280 --> 49:41.280]  so they're all asking why is this happening we know why go ahead I took
[49:41.280 --> 49:44.720]  the medication that you mentioned not not not Xanax not Prozac I didn't have
[49:44.720 --> 49:49.280]  problems with those but I had a bit of a depression that personary phase for a
[49:49.280 --> 49:55.120]  while and I took the medication called Paxil and with Paxil at first with the
[49:55.120 --> 49:59.360]  initial side effects or the strangest direct effects whatever you want to call
[49:59.360 --> 50:04.280]  it you have this kind of a tingling feeling down in your lower abdomen and
[50:04.280 --> 50:08.920]  groin you have the your mandible jitters like you've got the chills that goes
[50:08.920 --> 50:14.400]  I'll be honest I've never been a drug user but I have I have tried things a
[50:14.400 --> 50:20.120]  few times this and I had a girlfriend who was on one of those Prozac drugs this
[50:20.120 --> 50:24.320]  is back when I was right out of high school and I for a couple off and on
[50:24.320 --> 50:27.680]  because she said oh it'll take a few weeks for you to feel it I felt it and
[50:27.680 --> 50:31.680]  was not placebo I took it for like a week just to see what it was because I
[50:31.680 --> 50:37.560]  thought she was acting weird and my jaw felt weird I felt crazy I felt like I
[50:37.560 --> 50:41.680]  was disconnected somehow in my brain it felt really weird you ever kind of
[50:41.680 --> 50:44.960]  woke it up and feel kind of strange that's what I felt like and now that I
[50:44.960 --> 50:49.360]  know scientifically what it does it puts you in a dream like state so you're
[50:49.360 --> 50:54.000]  like in a dreaming state and then as you get on more of it and stuff I mean it's
[50:54.000 --> 50:57.880]  just it says on the insert causes you to commit mass murder and suicide stay
[50:57.880 --> 51:03.440]  there I want to hear more about it a little over a year ago I began to do a
[51:03.440 --> 51:07.560]  lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still
[51:07.560 --> 51:12.040]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[51:12.040 --> 51:14.920]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[51:14.920 --> 51:19.200]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the
[51:19.200 --> 51:24.280]  key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight
[51:24.280 --> 51:28.680]  off cancer and be healthy I've been searched out the best vitamin and

[54:36.880 --> 54:42.520]  alone didn't say much kind of quiet and shy but if you spoke at all he just said
[54:42.520 --> 54:49.920]  hi to big John somebody said he came from New Orleans where he got in a fight
[54:49.920 --> 54:55.240]  or a Cajun Queen and I crashed and blow from a huge right hand sent a Louisiana
[54:55.240 --> 55:02.760]  fella to the promised land big John all right let's go back to Carl in Oregon so
[55:02.760 --> 55:06.320]  Carl you're saying you went on one of these psychotropic drugs they're all
[55:06.320 --> 55:11.360]  basically the same same formula and what did it do to him okay let me tell you
[55:11.360 --> 55:14.760]  about my my account with it it was because I had another medication that I
[55:14.760 --> 55:19.600]  had a just a terrible reaction to that caused panic and anxiety so they put me
[55:19.600 --> 55:25.360]  on a medication say try this is brand new it's called Paxil okay so I took the
[55:25.360 --> 55:29.560]  medication and as I mentioned the the early side the area side effects or
[55:29.560 --> 55:33.560]  direct effects is actually what they really are as you had a jittering jaw
[55:33.560 --> 55:38.640]  kind of a strange lower abdomen tingle it goes away in a couple of weeks and
[55:38.640 --> 55:42.360]  then all of a sudden you find you're you're you're feeling a maybe that's a
[55:42.360 --> 55:46.400]  little bit goofy and you start laughing for no reason at certain things or
[55:46.400 --> 55:50.040]  saying things in or inappropriate things to people that you would never do
[55:50.040 --> 55:55.600]  before yeah I felt like the few times when I was a child and was sleepwalking
[55:55.600 --> 55:59.960]  one time I got up at about 5 a.m. and my dad heard me yelling I've got to catch
[55:59.960 --> 56:02.760]  the school bus because I had to walk about a quarter mile he's at the school
[56:02.760 --> 56:08.120]  bus and so I was running down the street in my underwear like 5 a.m. my dad heard
[56:08.120 --> 56:11.840]  me and had to chase me and I remember him waking me up and I for like five
[56:11.840 --> 56:17.160]  minutes felt dazed that's what they do they put you into that semi dream state
[56:17.160 --> 56:22.520]  that that's what these are and and that I mean that's on the insert that's what
[56:22.520 --> 56:28.120]  they do these people are in a mesmerized zombie state on average some people
[56:28.120 --> 56:31.600]  can handle it but I mean it's on the insert everybody has their horror
[56:31.600 --> 56:35.320]  stories but it's not like it's our opinion and and in every case I mean I
[56:35.320 --> 56:39.760]  never see a case where somebody randomly for no reason just shoots a cop
[56:39.760 --> 56:44.600]  they're always on this stuff this military guy they won't release it but
[56:44.600 --> 56:48.080]  psychiatrists are on records saying that he was in treatment and that anyone in
[56:48.080 --> 56:52.120]  that treatment for PTSD would have been prescribed this but they're they're not
[56:52.120 --> 56:57.400]  releasing that because they never want to blame the drug because they just want
[56:57.400 --> 57:01.120]  to prosecute these people and send them to jail and then more people will get
[57:01.120 --> 57:05.360]  killed because they won't stop the dangerous psychotropic they're in the
[57:05.360 --> 57:11.640]  hallucinogen class the drug insert says they are a hallucinogen go ahead
[57:11.640 --> 57:18.840]  finish up okay I I'll just make this brief in conclusion to this I I said
[57:18.840 --> 57:23.280]  some inappropriate things I would never would say in a public place as a
[57:23.280 --> 57:26.200]  matter of fact it was at a church it was a church function I said some of the
[57:26.200 --> 57:30.120]  inappropriate things and this this young lady that came out I mean she wasn't a
[57:30.120 --> 57:33.920]  dating person she was kind of a tomboy kind of a tough person herself anyway and
[57:33.920 --> 57:37.880]  she she approached me in front of me about my about my comments and so and so
[57:37.880 --> 57:42.760]  forth and you know I she just got all of a sudden out of nowhere I just hauled
[57:42.760 --> 57:46.680]  off took two hands and just shoved her to the ground I hear you God bless you
[57:46.680 --> 57:51.560]  look look the federal government spent millions studying this you can look it
[57:51.560 --> 57:58.800]  up shrimp on Prozac commit suicide birds on Prozac that's the main generic you
[57:58.800 --> 58:03.780]  know originally Eli Lilly production I mean look it up you give it to in it not
[58:03.780 --> 58:09.080]  just mammals you can give it to lizards and they start committing suicide and by
[58:09.080 --> 58:13.440]  that they'll just walk right up to their predator look it up shrimp commit
[58:13.440 --> 58:20.480]  suicide on Prozac it it takes your instinct of survival and compulsion you
[58:20.480 --> 58:24.240]  don't have compulsion control like if I ever had a thought to kill somebody
[58:24.240 --> 58:27.440]  which we've all had those thoughts at least I would imagine you have you've
[58:27.440 --> 58:30.880]  had the thought of you know instantly I'm about to you know punch that person in
[58:30.880 --> 58:35.480]  the nose you control yourself when you're on these drugs you don't oh there's a
[58:35.480 --> 58:39.760]  cop I'll just go ahead and just shoot him right in the neck
[58:42.760 --> 58:52.040]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network a little over a year ago
[58:52.040 --> 58:56.720]  I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal
[58:56.720 --> 59:00.880]  that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that
[59:00.880 --> 59:04.440]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[59:04.440 --> 59:08.360]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[59:08.360 --> 59:13.280]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[59:13.280 --> 59:17.680]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best
[59:17.680 --> 59:22.440]  vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered young Jeviti the young

[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:06.280]  rant and raving get angry because I'm sick of this I mean I am tired of every
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.400]  two or three days seeing articles where they're taking people's children who
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:14.600]  don't give their children vaccines and calling it neglect when it's illegal to
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:18.640]  do that and it freaks me out to know the government is that lawless and that
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.040]  evil and to read about some poor chicken farmer the city wanted to take his land
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:27.920]  for an environmental preserve so they killed him the police went in and the
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.240]  house blew up and they're telling people that he blew himself up and my
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:37.320]  gut is they probably deep-sixting and I've got that report that makes me
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:42.600]  absolutely want to just just just just pull my hair out let's go back to your
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.320]  calls and Sean stones joining us Danny in New York welcome oh man I think I'll
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.960]  be able to get on this fan well you are sir worldwide please hit me all right
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:57.640]  man I want to talk about entitlements today um you know Christie governor
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:01.360]  Christie came out talking about we became in an entitlement country and
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:06.360]  everything but they forced us to take social security from birth but even though
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:10.000]  we don't we don't need it this is just something that's how they do it they take
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.280]  your money steal it pay you back five cents on the dollar and then tell you
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.760]  how you're dependent as they shut your jobs down and ship them overseas with
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.360]  tax incentives they cut your legs off and then make fun of you for being
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:26.440]  crippled right well you know what I got a letter from Social Security
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.840]  Administration from several support and I'm pretty sure a lot of people have
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:35.600]  gotten this but it says and I quote the Social Security Act does not require a
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.600]  person to have a social security number to live and work in United States
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.800]  nor does it require social security numbers simply for the purpose of
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:50.880]  having one now if that's true why does all the all the businesses like what
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:56.880]  to tell you you got to have a number in order to say it is illegal to make you
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.040]  give a social security number for anything with the administration of that
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:05.680]  program that's on record and until a few years ago was on the card but because
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:11.120]  notice the illegal aliens don't need it for jobs or for in many cases or for
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:18.000]  bank accounts it's only for you the US citizen is known as the galactic chump
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.200]  have you heard my right whale analogy the right whales were down to just a few
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.400]  dozen almost extinct when they were one of the most plentiful whales in the sea
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:32.800]  a gregarious bumping boats playful with humans like dolphins very slow sweet
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.480]  trusting so the whalers call them the right whale it's the right one to kill
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:42.440]  and that's what we're known as the new order sees us and they see in in neon
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:48.880]  chump idiots they see Americans whether your old young black white Hispanic
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:54.520]  they don't care they see Americans as suckers as food on the table and we've
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:58.720]  got to wake up to that and realize we have turned into a joke not me not
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.480]  anymore I'm fighting it I just want to thank you for the last time I spoke to
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.600]  you about all the family court and you told me to start something up with
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:11.560]  with our men's program and I'm working on that you know because I'm the guy who
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:17.160]  told you that you need to persevere that you know it's not he who who wins the
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:21.440]  races like you got to go to the end I gave you a quick Bible quote the last
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.880]  time I spoke to you I'm just trying to talk fast so I was like you know I
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.920]  remember that meant a lot to me and you're absolutely right it's it's just
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.760]  like George Washington it's not about winning the battles it's about never
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:35.840]  giving up I mean I mean the North Vietnamese lost almost every battle but
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.240]  they won the war because it's about never giving up I mean even if somebody's
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.920]  clobbering you and you keep fighting hurting them it gets old for them they
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.080]  want a quick victory and you just chew on their heels chew on you'll bite them
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.960]  I mean you know that's what it comes down to here God bless your brother sorry
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:54.140]  I got to cut you off quick you know I'm so long-winded
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.880]  Sean Stone's coming up for about 50 minutes that I promise back to your phone
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:03.680]  calls and a ton of news this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:08.120]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.120]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:16.040]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:20.080]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.640]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:29.280]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:33.040]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.480]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.440]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:18.080]  your mind
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:26.920]  it is our number two we will have open phones and news including the latest on
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:30.280]  the corporate media trying to cause a race war in this country it's now
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:35.680]  completely confirmed the Justice Department MSNBC they're all involved
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:40.880]  the inside intel we've got is in the next 72 hours will now last the next 68
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.080]  hours or so they're gonna announce that they're not gonna prosecute him because
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.760]  there's four witnesses the Trayvon Martin was on top of Zimmerman punching
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.960]  him in the face this is purely about getting the American people fighting
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:57.360]  with each other does that mean that there isn't such a thing as walking
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:00.400]  while black or driving while black and the blacks do get unfairly targeted
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:05.280]  sometimes obviously that's going on I could see why people get mad but it's
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:10.400]  a manipulation by the social engineers undoubtedly that's why MSNBC has been
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.600]  caught putting out fake video fake audio red-handed make you trying to make
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:19.800]  Zimmerman sound like a racist that's why the White House has been promoting it
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:25.360]  that's why you've seen Al Sharpton all these people pushing uprisings and
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.800]  saying do you want violence in the new Black Panther Party saying we need blood
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:32.880]  in the streets kill white people this is because government run by the foreign
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.080]  banks does not want us getting together against Goldman Sachs the New World Order
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:42.240]  the TSA getting together under the Bill of Rights Constitution family private
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:46.520]  property the free market they don't want us to say no to carbon taxes they don't
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:50.120]  want us to say no to the open borders they don't want us to say no to the New
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:55.760]  World Order they don't want us to say no to tax incentives to ship our jobs to
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:01.280]  China they don't want us to wake up which is starting to happen and so they
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:06.320]  are actually trying to get riots going in this country right as they try to
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:09.360]  launch new wars they'd had the aircraft carriers last week they announced we're
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.000]  gonna leave the Persian Gulf they sent another one and have the others double
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.320]  back first time that's happened in decades that was in Reuters I covered
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.080]  Monday so the aircraft carriers it's all back on I mean this is crazy what's
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:27.200]  going on right now now about a week and a half ago
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:33.040]  Sean Stone of course a TV host director writer been in more than a hundred
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:39.840]  movies on the latest was Wall Street his father of course Oliver Stone he said
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:45.200]  look we've got to do more I know this congressman's got an impeachment bill in
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:50.480]  it's not getting attention we've got to produce something like the Coney 2012
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.200]  video but not something that's based in lies and propaganda to launch a new war
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:59.880]  something based in truth and I said well you know what what's your idea and he
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:04.920]  said I'm gonna cut an audio piece I'd like you to add video to it and I'd
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:09.480]  like you to get behind you're saying look we've got to impeach Obama and I said
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:13.400]  absolutely so a week and a half later Rob Jacobson and some of the other crew
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:20.240]  have put together this nine-minute video that we're gonna premiere at the
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.720]  bottom of the hour and then Sean will continue on with us until the hour is
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:31.040]  over and after we premiere the video an article is gonna go up at info wars.com
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:35.360]  the Kurt Nemo is putting together right now he's putting it together for a few
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.200]  days the problem is when you talk about high crimes and misdemeanors I mean
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:43.960]  it's just clear the sub articles in the Constitution you launch a war without
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:49.480]  congressional approval it's a high crime misdemeanor it is treason because
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.800]  you're trying to become a dictator that's the danger in every country
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:59.920]  throughout history from from Caesar on from Julius Caesar right through Augustus
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:06.400]  Caesar to Caligula to Nero right through to Hitler and we see this happening now
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.800]  it's what happens in third world countries all the time and he but he went
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.800]  further he said I don't just do this turning my office into a dictatorship
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:17.960]  which even mainstream newspapers are now saying last week when he told the
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:22.520]  Supreme Court he could overrule them and that they didn't count he I mean even
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:26.240]  the Washington Post said this is dictatorial behavior and again it's not
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.720]  that Obama himself would be a dictator the office is under the National
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.640]  Security Council and Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase that put him into power
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.760]  they already have installed presidents and prime ministers in a score of
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:43.960]  European countries in Eastern Europe in in in third world countries in Latin
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:47.640]  America they have Goldman Sachs people who are installed as the presidents and
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:57.800]  prime ministers Italy with Monty same thing in Greece they tried it in Iceland
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:03.960]  for a year the normally peaceful Icelanders turned into the Vikings they
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:11.720]  are and said no and it turned out 92% in that case of the debt was not theirs the
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.880]  government was signing them on to somebody else's debt Obama has done
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.200]  that he's launched wars not congressional approval he's hired nothing but
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.760]  foreign lobbyist he signed the NDAA totally unconstitutional saying they
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:26.800]  can secretly arrest us expanded torture he's now arresting journalists who talk
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.880]  to whistleblowers who expose corruption Bush didn't do that again even the
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.840]  Washington Post was like this is scary that's the establishment we have to
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:41.200]  impeach him or at least get the movement going to say to the world this
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.480]  type of illegal power grab will be blocked even if he is a power puppet
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:51.800]  he's like a wicked globalist Titan controlled by Kronos to use a analogy
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:56.600]  he's still a dangerous puppet charging over us and the Republicans bad you bet
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:01.640]  we'll try to impeach them to I tried to get Bush impeached I tried to get
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:06.440]  Clinton impeached and it worked to a certain level they voted to start the
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:10.120]  impeachment and move the trial to the Senate and then that got killed the
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.400]  point is the things Obama has done make Bill Clinton look like a choir boy as
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.800]  bad as he was all the evil he made makes Bush it at many levels look tame
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:23.560]  because and it's gonna get worse under the next president we have to reign in
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:28.400]  these criminals and so we're gonna break this down in the video he covers four
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:33.720]  big points Kurt's gonna cover a ten or more and it's gonna be an article and a
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:37.400]  video after we premiere it here on the radio the video will go live the next
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:41.640]  hour and info wars calm probably sooner with the video on YouTube to go viral
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:49.200]  and links to social media you name it and send a message to the crooks we know
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.200]  you're criminal and we're saying in the court of public opinion you are
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:56.920]  impeached in fact I think I'm gonna have another headline by Watson or
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.800]  somebody on top of this or a duplicate of the video and I'm gonna call it you
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.360]  know something like the American people have already impeached Obama court of
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:08.560]  public opinion impeaches Obama but now that added to his own because that's the
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:12.800]  point here resistance is not futile they tell you it is because you've got the
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.720]  power by the way we beat soap other back with a new bill to openly shut
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:21.360]  things down as traditionally it's all happening now Sean Stone host of the
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.400]  upcoming third season of conspiracy theory joins us with the Jesse Ventura and
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:33.800]  of course Tyrell Ventura me getting those guys on soon and he recently went to
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:39.440]  Iran and simply said that he recognizes that it's the same God that you know the
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:42.040]  Jews Christians Muslim whether you believe that or not that's what the
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.080]  Muslims believe and he was saying I recognize you as a thing of solidarity
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:51.400]  the media said he converted to Islam he was saying I recognize it's to try to
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:57.040]  deescalate things but of course the media spun that as well now going to him
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:01.400]  this is a big deal and I'm glad you're doing this and we should all do this in
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.440]  fact other people should launch their own videos saying impeaching for your own
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:08.840]  reasons just let's do something let's get this going we've got the power Sean
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:14.440]  Stone very exciting what we're launching here to the calling it Coney 2012 with
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.080]  establishment fake viral spread that blew up this is based in facts and will
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:24.320]  only grow and of course we're going to call it impeach Obama 2012 and it's
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.960]  going to be launched here today right now and it's up to the listeners and
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:33.900]  viewers on XM 166 and over a hundred AM and FM's global shortwave WWCR info
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:39.200]  wars.com it's up to you we put the work in done it now we're giving you the ball
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:43.080]  I mean we're giving you the seed you've got a planet you got to put sun on it
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:47.840]  you got to water it Sean great to have you with us break down as we go to break
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:51.320]  here in about three four minutes what's coming up in the video and why you did
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:57.800]  this hey Alex well yeah the the urgency is informing people that we you know we
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.560]  are currently as I as we call it in a state of martial law we are going towards
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:05.240]  a state of worse insanity as you're well aware of and you're one of the few
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.960]  people out there that's actually raising the alarms on this and the more I
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.240]  talk to people regarding you know why Obama so dangerous as you as you're
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:16.960]  well aware most people seem to think well you know he's a smart guy he was
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:21.400]  trained at Harvard and you know he which is usually means he's very dangerous but
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:25.000]  you know he's too smart to allow things you know things like this to take you
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.360]  know martial law and in assessing American citizens he must be justified so
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:33.920]  I wanted to make it an infomercial essentially right in contrast as you
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:38.320]  say the Coney 2012 because the point is where it's not about these wars abroad
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.280]  it's not about war with Iran or war in Uganda or war anywhere else or Syria
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.640]  anywhere else but right here at home the war on the American people that's
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:50.120]  taking place right now and is escalating as we see and you point out on a daily
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:54.280]  basis not even just the weekly basis anymore so if we don't start to activate
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:57.840]  people in the process of impeaching Obama we cannot we cannot take our
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.080]  country back you know you say it's our public you say that it's your country so
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:05.000]  I say okay fine prove it start this process of impeaching him you may not
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.280]  succeed but in the process let's spread this video let's make it viral it's
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.800]  getting millions hundreds of millions of people in America to least realize what's
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:16.040]  going on to become aware and in that process we're succeeding and you know
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.720]  forget about the election in six months we don't know if that's gonna come
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:22.880]  exactly roll over and die people don't remember what if we don't make it to
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:26.960]  know that exactly people don't throw out if we have a whole new country by then
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:30.600]  exactly if people don't throw themselves behind this and they should just roll
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:33.240]  over to die
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:39.640]  continue Sean Alex yeah I'm sorry I think sometimes Skype doesn't sink and
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.760]  then when I talk to you you can't hear me and it cuts the feed up can you hear
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:48.740]  me now all right we're having a Skype issue with him but but that's okay
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:56.200]  Sean can you hear me now okay we're gonna bring him back up after the break so
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:01.280]  it was a Skype problem there this is very very exciting this is very very
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:08.280]  important and it's true and he's put together a very nice presentation and
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:12.600]  we merged it with our video and some clips Rob Jacobson did a superlative
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:17.720]  job so did some of the other graphics guys like Marcos Morales and Darren McBrain
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:23.560]  and John Bown and others that contributed to this piece and we've done
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:28.560]  the work here we're begging you he's saying we're under UN command he has the
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:32.440]  generals telling the Congress we take orders from the UN he's saying he'll
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:36.200]  arrest and disappear citizens the NSA last week told Congress under
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.360]  presidential order they're not gonna tell Congress about the new NSA base and
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:47.640]  what it's doing in in Utah Congress passes the laws and has the money like
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:52.760]  this legislature is in charge of the state police in every state this is
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:57.240]  total criminal dictatorship by the bankers and they're just hiding it in
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:01.760]  plain view we've got an impeachment Obama the videos coming up I've seen the
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:05.360]  longevity products work for many others and so I bought a bunch of them started
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:09.360]  using them had a little bit of results but I wasn't following the regimen every
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:14.600]  day but Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds when I saw
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:18.520]  those results I said I better follow my own advice I started taking the

[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:17.040]  okay Sean said that his internet completely died that's never happened
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:21.720]  before he was telling us we hope it's just a snafu but we are launching a
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:25.960]  movement here to supercharge the impeachment now Chuck Norris came out
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:31.840]  on WorldNet Daily last week and did his analysis and and and also used info
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:36.240]  wars information and said that clearly this newest executive order is
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:40.280]  preparing for martial law another congressperson has come out in the
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:44.240]  Orlando Sentinel and said they've done an analysis and this executive order
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:49.240]  isn't if we get nuked like the old one said for martial law it's for any reason
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:53.040]  including the threat of an emergency Sean you've got the floor continue
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:58.200]  breaking down why we need to push for a movement to get impeachment going
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:02.040]  because the ball started to roll now it's going a little bit faster if we
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:07.040]  just do it these crimes are so open we've at least got a publicly say no to
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:12.480]  it or they're setting the precedent to go hog wild right now I mean we have to
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:16.080]  recognize that there is no difference between the Democratic Republican
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:19.640]  parties as they now stand we've been we've been taken over by these two
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:23.480]  factions they're ruled ultimately by the same people which is which is a
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:28.460]  financial elite noligarchy and if we as the people do not rescind the power and
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:31.520]  say we are capable of impeaching the president that is most that is most
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:34.560]  empowering act that we as American citizens can do at this point it's not
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:37.960]  to go to an election and vote for one of the two parties that are being you
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:41.680]  know promulgated upon us it's to say no you have violated your contract with the
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.080]  people Obama in this case you weak we're gonna lay out the points that were
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:50.160]  basing his impeachment upon and to say that we are not gonna stand by and
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.400]  allow you to take away our strip you strip us of our civil rights put us in
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:59.320]  a position of constant warfare and fear warfare and to continue bailout of a
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:03.360]  banking system for debts that we did not accrue as people I mean ultimately we
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.960]  know that these debts that are being paid to the banks and and being you know
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:12.800]  that the leverage is being used against our economy against our future is not
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.240]  accrued by us we're not benefiting from this the American people are not
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:18.920]  benefiting from this it's a small little faction based out of Europe and Wall
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:21.920]  Street which is an extension of the British Empire and that's it that's
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:25.840]  what he represents so impeach him to take the power back to the hands of the
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.840]  American people and then say whoever comes in next you better be afraid not
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:32.840]  we're not gonna be afraid of you you're gonna be afraid of us right that's the
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.240]  whole point that's what at least the Nixon impeachment worked on
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:39.560]  psychologically was the sense that we don't trust you and if we you know the
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:42.200]  next president that comes in you're basically should be a lame duck in our
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:45.280]  hands now unfortunately Kissinger was still there and although you know the
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:49.120]  bad guys were still around for his administration but there was was still a
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:52.520]  feeling at least of empowerment at that moment I think you've hit the heart here
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:58.280]  Sean it is an American tradition of common sense not to trust government and
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:02.920]  to keep government in line because like fire it's a dangerous servant fearful
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:08.680]  master as George Washington said instead Obama is the cynical liar who said he
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:12.600]  wouldn't hire lobbyist wouldn't hurt whistleblowers the most open government
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:18.000]  was gonna do all this he's lied about everything he's such a cynical liar he
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.080]  makes Bill Clinton look honest was what's so dangerous about him that's
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:25.600]  precisely what's what the danger is it's it's a cult leader it's someone who's
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:29.680]  mastered his his voice tone I mean if frankly if you listen to him the first
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:33.480]  time I heard him I said this is an actor you're dealing with he doesn't sound
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:36.960]  that his voice pitch doesn't sound like it like it sounds like it's trained it
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.760]  doesn't sound natural to me right and so the the tone of his voice is what
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.240]  hypnotizes crowds so they sit there and they go oh he's so smart he sounds so
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:48.160]  intelligent well yeah it's it's about how you present yourself it's not actually
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:52.120]  what's you know what is he meanwhile he speaks with one tongue about as he said
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:57.440]  you know whether it's you know not not not allowing political lobbyists or
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:03.640]  allowing what's the word transparency on the bills you know you know no signing
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:07.840]  statements a week to read the bills and he does the opposite not gonna sign the
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:12.120]  NDAA does sign it says he didn't want the power turns out he ordered the power
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:16.320]  I mean just total do it's it's so Machiavellian I mean there'll be like
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.560]  nine levels of lies with Bush it would just be in your face I'm doing this
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:25.360]  well as you pointed out when you made the Obama deception four years ago KRS-1
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:28.040]  was the guy who said you know this country was on the verge of revolution
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:32.400]  against Bush we hated Bush it was it was so open what he was doing and in terms
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:35.800]  of the neocon movement behind him that was going towards these imperialistic
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.840]  wars and in the Patriot Act all these things were they were obscene but at
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.320]  least it was like we knew it might have made a film called W about it and so I
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:46.400]  got to point out a lot of the impeachable offenses that he made but at that
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:49.520]  time what should have happened was we really needed a president who was gonna
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:53.160]  stand it stand up like an FDR or a Lincoln and say you know we're gonna
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:57.160]  basically take the strong executive start to actually bring you know help our
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:01.320]  people support build infrastructure to you know support the technological
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:05.920]  uplifting of our people again and read you know re-encourage industrialization
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:09.600]  all these things that will basically lift the level of the working man and the
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:13.720]  middle class and instead you get a guy who says that and ultimately works for
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:17.160]  Wall Street and works for the British Empire which is what's Obama and he's
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:20.400]  trying to pass all these carbon taxes and putting it through without even
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:24.200]  passing it to shut down what's left of our economy our economy's dying on the
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:27.920]  table and he's stabbing it with an ice pick going let me take care of you
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:32.640]  not feeling too good we're gonna come back with Sean Stone folks this is your
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:37.480]  chance to take action we're gonna premiere this video on the other side
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:43.440]  in peach Obama 2012 that's the political slogan that's the point that's what
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.520]  we've got to start pushing and we'll break down what's in the video and then
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:52.880]  get to it straight ahead with Sean Stone we're on the March the Empire's on the

[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:05.920]  year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:10.120]  sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:14.240]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:18.240]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost

[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:23.440]  a crawling insect an ugly misforned little creature who has no purpose here
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:30.720]  no meaning I am a human being words mr. Wordsworth that have no substance and
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:36.880]  no dimensum like air like a wind I don't care I tell you I don't care I'm a
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:43.920]  human being I exist if I speak one for a loud that thought lives even after I'm
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:34:08.400]  troubled into my great resistance to tyrants his obedience to God it's Alex
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:25.800]  Jones okay Sean Stone is our guest we're about to premiere this video that
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:30.840]  we've been working on for a week and a half and the title of the video it'll

[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:47.040]  2012 we're gonna call the video impeach Obama 2012 but it's it's it's impeach
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:52.680]  Obama 2012 movement just like Coney 2012 but this is a grassroots situation we
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:56.000]  don't have the State Department and every corporate media horse system pushing
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.720]  it it is up to you to get this video that we're about to premiere out to
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:06.680]  everybody and again this ideas with Sean Stone the audio you're gonna hear is
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:12.200]  his narration with the video and the different clips here Sean we're about
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:15.640]  to go to this video here in a moment but any other points you think that are
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:20.920]  important to make or we can make it when we come back yeah I mean just the one
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:25.000]  thing I remember is you know from the beginning I was suspicious of Obama and
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.120]  I'll tell you specifically I was at a dinner with the wife of Rupert Murdoch
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.800]  and she hosted this and so there was a quite a few wealthy individuals there
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:38.360]  and this is 2008 in the summertime coming into the election and we were
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.640]  asking you know well what do you what do you think what do you guys think about
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:44.880]  the election do you care who wins if it's McCain or Obama and the attitude was
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:49.960]  no we didn't want Hillary to run and if you recall there was some fraud that
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:52.840]  were going on those elections in Florida and Michigan I believe it was that
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:56.840]  we're not like qualified as as election as the electoral caucus going into the
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:00.640]  Democratic primaries yes that was when the deal was made for Obama for Hillary
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.840]  to come on a secretary of state and that was very clearly stated to me that the
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:07.120]  intention was not for Hillary to become president and so long as it was either
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:12.280]  Obama or McCain there was no preference and then one of the European this is a
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:17.080]  this is exactly the symptom of the oligarchy was this guy I want to tell
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:21.000]  you his name but he runs a major fund of funds they say they give their money to
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.440]  people like Soros he kind of scoffed it when I mentioned Soros Soros was supposed
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:28.280]  to be at the party and it was like Soros is a small potato we give him money
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:32.440]  that was the attitude of this guy and he's you know Anglo-French basically that
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:37.680]  imperial faction that he comes from trained at that school he he said to me
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:41.480]  in French you know I have no concern we have no concerns about Obama except for
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.640]  the fact that he's black and that was the indication what he was indicating with
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:49.320]  me was because he's black there's a potential for him to sympathize with the
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:54.640]  underclass if that was ever expressed he could be a danger but as far as we're
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:58.520]  concerned everything else he's controlled well he's shown himself
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:02.720]  particularly ruthless he doubled the funding for basically forced abortion in
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:06.080]  Africa and a lot of other things so that's really pleased the system he's
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:11.280]  been really into aborting black babies as much as he can so that I think he
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:14.840]  showed himself well to them well yeah the point was that simply there if there
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:19.160]  was ever any inclination of the man to ever have this sympathy for the
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:23.320]  underclass you know that comes as a black man in America a minority or you
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:26.240]  know whether it's Latino or black but there's this historical revolutionary
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:31.440]  tendency as we know right if that ever showed it in itself he would have been
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:35.840]  often that's why consistently throughout his presidency remember there was they
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:39.520]  always had this potential for an assassination plot and that was to
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:44.200]  trigger a race war as you've commented on the trade on was a trade on case yeah
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:47.240]  and now they're doing it it's incredible I've always said Obama could be the
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:51.480]  false flag but they have been caught MSNBC the White House the Justice
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:55.800]  Department trying to start a race war and now they've got these feds out there
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:59.760]  saying let's get white blood flowing you know their feds anybody else would be
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:03.440]  arrested yeah all these are exactly the kind of conditions they're trying to
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:06.560]  create at the end of the day they are trying because there's because they are
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.360]  opening up these doors for martial law and then creating that in the creating
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:13.720]  on the books these precedents I mean why would you announce for example that you
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:16.600]  assassinated American citizens unless you're trying to put out a warning to
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:20.600]  people to say you are next you know don't be if they understand that so why
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:23.480]  would they even announce that why not just why would they have the head of the
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:27.000]  CIA three weeks ago come out and say we're watching and listening to all of
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.840]  you without warrants we don't need warrants and last week Congress said we
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:35.400]  want to know about these giant new NSA bases and the executive said literally
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:41.520]  go to Hades right Congress was told you don't get to ask questions we are the
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.640]  bosses now I mean it's happening they need to set the precedent and the point
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:48.400]  is it's psychologically breaking the American people down to the point of
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:53.160]  this is 1984 and Brave New World all in one you know we were telling you the
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:58.240]  truth but you're so distracted by by American Idol and what what what Kim
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:02.040]  Kardashian and then some celebrity is doing that you don't give a damn that
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:05.400]  your state your country is no longer a public and if you don't take that power
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:09.160]  back let's see what we are in five years let's see how horrible it can get
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:12.320]  because no one expected that you know Nazi Germany would end up becoming as
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:15.760]  horrific and destroyed as it was I mean people weren't aware of the concentration
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:19.280]  camps you know per se they weren't you know they were aware of the wars they
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:22.000]  were aware of the of the austerity programs that were being done to them
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.880]  they were but they believed in the sacrifice for the homeland so the point
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.840]  is where where's this gonna end we don't know all we know is that we are on a
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:32.840]  course to hell right now and you know with that I would say you present the
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:41.280]  video well said my friend is it not heartening though that we've now got at
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:45.440]  least 10 different congress people talking about Obama trying to set up a
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:50.200]  police state and introducing impeachment legislation Chuck Norris came out
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:55.000]  wrote a WorldNet Daily article plugging my show and saying I was right in my
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.800]  research and yeah I mean I've had Chuck Norris on the show before but the point
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:05.680]  is Chuck Norris went against the other WorldNet daily writer that said oh this
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:10.880]  executive orders no big deal but in Chuck Norris's article he admitted that
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:16.840]  Bush was bad and engaging in imperial type activities but that Obama was
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:20.640]  trying to overthrow the Republic itself I mean that really shows that Chuck is
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:26.920]  starting to wake up my point is there's major buzz on all this there is and let's
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:30.240]  let's let's intensify and now let's bring the pressure because if we put the
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:33.840]  pressure on them the point is that this is how this is how you basically to
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:37.680]  stabilize their their takeover the more awareness you put on them the more you
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:40.560]  basically back them into a corner wherever they whatever they do now
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:43.880]  where they're pointing a finger you see that's the only way you defeat these
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:47.240]  guys and speaking of that that's why we're gonna go to this video right now
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:51.160]  and then go to break and come back and comment more but here it is in peach
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:56.600]  Obama 2012 the video the audio for radio listeners get this out to everyone
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:01.640]  after the video it'll be posted at info wars.com with a red link as the top
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:06.880]  story we've produced it we've put it together it's now up to you I hand the
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:34.680]  baton to you the info warriors
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:40.360]  on March 7 of this year representative Walter Jones of North Carolina
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:45.240]  introduced House resolution 107 into the United States Congress the resolution
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:49.000]  states whereas the cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congress's
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.600]  exclusive power to declare war under article one section 8 clause 11 of the
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:58.360]  Constitution now therefore be it resolved by the House of representatives
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:03.080]  the Senate concurring that it is the sense of Congress that accept in response
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:07.200]  to an actual or imminent attack against the territory of the United States the
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:11.280]  use of offensive military force by president prior and clear authorization
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:15.560]  of an act of Congress of violates Congress's exclusive power to declare
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:22.080]  war under article one section 8 clause 11 of the Constitution Jones intended
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:26.000]  his resolution to express the sense of Congress that the use of offensive
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.120]  military force by a president without the prior and clear authorization of an
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:34.320]  act of Congress constitutes an impeachable high-cry and misdemeanor
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:39.960]  under article 2 section 4 of the Constitution why does President Barack
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:45.760]  Obama deserve to be impeached here are four reasons doing little or nothing at
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:52.960]  all will result in even greater deficits even greater job loss even greater
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:58.920]  loss of income one the Obama administration not only endorsed at
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:04.320]  2008 bailout policy the funds from which did not go either to homeowners or for
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:10.520]  taxpayers protection but rather to the consolidation of private banks many of
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:14.520]  them in Europe there was no investment of any meaningful type in the physical
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:19.240]  economy there was no protection of the American people but rather an illegal
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:22.800]  commitment made on behalf of private banking institutions to commit the
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:27.760]  American people to paying a debt that the American people did not accrue the
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.800]  trillions of dollars that were pledged to the private banking sector are backed
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:36.320]  by the assets belonging to the American people this combines represent the most
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:40.360]  clear violation of the principle of the general welfare in the preamble to the
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:44.960]  Constitution of the United States I also want to be clear about what we will
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:52.600]  not be doing the United States is not going to deploy ground troops into Libya
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:59.120]  U.S. boots are reportedly on the ground in Libya to the Obama administration
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:03.120]  conducted a war in Libya which it claimed it did not conduct with American
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:07.080]  forces that it claimed were not involved to the purpose of overthrowing and
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:11.080]  then executing ahead of a sovereign state who was held in the custody of
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:15.320]  insurgent forces financed and militarily supported by United States
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:21.280]  France Britain and other NATO countries this was done despite the fact the United
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:24.920]  States was either attacked nor threatened with attack by the nation of
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:29.040]  Libya or the Congress not the president has the authority under the
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:33.280]  Constitution to declare war but the Obama administration believes that it has
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:37.520]  that authority do you think that you can act without Congress on to and
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:43.240]  initiate a no-fly zone in Syria without congressional approval the
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:46.560]  administration recently asserted that its actions are above the loss of the
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.800]  United States in exchange between Obama Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:56.600]  Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama our goal would be to seek international
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:01.920]  permission and we would we would come to the Congress and inform you and
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:07.200]  determine how best to approach this whether or not we would want to get
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:11.280]  permission from the Congress I think those are issues we would have to
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:16.880]  discuss as we decide what to do here what I heard you say is we're going to
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.360]  seek international approval and they will come and tell the Congress what we
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:26.040]  might do the Obama administration thus does not believe that the Congress has
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:30.360]  the exclusive power to declare war and accordingly the president should be
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:39.880]  impeached let me welcome Prime Minister Cameron the United States of New York
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:45.880]  obviously there is extraordinarily special relationship three the Obama
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:49.600]  administration sides with the imperial power of Great Britain and probably so
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:53.720]  and what has been called the special relationship through that special
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:57.400]  relationship the United States as a result of the false intelligence
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:02.440]  advocated by Tony Blair claimed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:08.160]  conducted a preventive war against Iraq in 2003 preventive war was declared a
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:13.960]  crime against humanity by the Nuremberg statutes of 1947 but now on March 13th
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:18.800]  of this year Barack Obama and David Cameron declared their intention to
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:24.840]  seek the removal of the Syrian regime of President Bashir al-Assad a regime that
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:29.200]  has shown no intent of threatening or attacking the United States Republic
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:34.040]  this shows Obama's intent to continue a policy of war for the commission of
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:38.840]  which the Nazis were sentenced to death in Nuremberg if President Obama intends
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:44.840]  to finance arm or in any way militarily support the rebel factions against the
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:49.360]  president of Syria he has a constitutional requirement to approach
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:56.200]  the Congress for a declaration of war for President Obama has committed us as
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:03.080]  a country to a policy of indefinite warfare including on American soil on
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:08.360]  December 31st 2011 Barack Obama signed into law the 2012 National Defense
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:12.440]  Authorization Act which includes provisions that state the Congress
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:16.600]  affirms that the authority of the president to use all necessary and
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:20.480]  appropriate force pursuant to the authorization for use of military force
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:25.040]  includes the authority for the armed forces of the United States to detain
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:29.880]  covered persons pending disposition under the law of war when Congress defined
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:35.400]  such covered persons exempting US citizens from the language they were
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:40.360]  rebuked by the Obama administration which told them to remove US citizens from
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:46.680]  being precluded thus as a result US citizens can also be detained by the
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:53.400]  US military indefinitely without due process or civilian trial this now
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:57.520]  allows the United States military to arrest and detain without trial
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:02.640]  American citizens who are deemed enemy combatants it abrogates the
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:07.400]  Constitution of the United States in the fourth fifth and sixth amendments the
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:10.400]  right of the people to be secure in their persons against unreasonable
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:14.120]  searches and seizures and that no person should be held to answer for a
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:19.080]  capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentiment or indictment
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:23.200]  of a grand jury and that the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:28.480]  public trial by an impartial jury all these rights have been abandoned by the
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:33.920]  United States under President Barack Obama further the president asks the
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:37.720]  country to believe him when he says that he will not use his power of the
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:44.440]  executive towards the arrest of US citizens pursuant to the NDA of 2012
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:50.160]  however the executive branch has already ordered the execution of an American
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:56.960]  citizen in November of 2011 the Obama administration is already assassinated
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:01.820]  an American citizen Anwar al-Aulaki who was never tried in
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:07.320]  abstentia but was simply indicted by a secret court according to the executive
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:11.640]  branch who then ordered his assassination a murder which also included
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:17.000]  that of his son a 16 year old boy and a family friend considering the president's
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.440]  willingness to assassinate American citizens are we really ready to entrust
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:26.320]  them with the power to indefinitely detain US citizens in the course of so
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:30.520]  called combat after all our constitution promises the trial of all crimes
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:35.760]  accepting cases of impeachment shall be by jury and such trial shall be held in
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:41.520]  state where the said crimes shall have been committed now is the time if we
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:45.520]  choose to surrender our republic to the machinations of dictatorship for fear
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:51.840]  of external threats terrorism and other amorphous enemies then we do not
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:57.240]  deserve the republic which was given to us by our forefathers and promised to us
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:02.080]  based on the pledge that is republic of the people by the people and for the
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:08.800]  people consequently as a republic belonging to us we are not accountable to
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:13.240]  the president and the congress they are accountable to us and should the
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:18.400]  president presume the pictorial powers regardless of the state of war that he
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:23.680]  may claim we are now in he must respond to our demands to protect American
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:29.120]  citizens from unauthorized illegal detention by the military and to annul
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:34.760]  this national defense authorization act 2012 and if he does not do so then he
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:41.000]  deserves to be impeached immediately but if we say nothing today where we
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:53.240]  beat tomorrow all right my friends you doing in this time ask yourself what are

[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:07.280]  audio was overdriven a bit but we're perfectionist around here at least
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:13.000]  driving towards it but but very exciting because I'm fighting back and every time
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.040]  I fight back I just have success and I get stronger and I know you're taking
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:22.080]  action as well but here's the Chuck Norris article the benign and
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:28.440]  benevolent president Obama Chuck Norris blast unprecedented reckless abuse of
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:33.520]  executive power and the last week three more Congress people have come out and
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:38.680]  said they've had the lawyers in the house look at the new executive order
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:42.360]  something we looked at three weeks ago and we're called conspiracy theorist and
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:47.880]  that it does grab unprecedented power before they had on the book since 1950
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:54.800]  that if there is a nuclear attack or a giant war and we're being bombed that
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:56:00.720]  yes civil emergencies put in by the president Obama says now for any
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:06.000]  emergency or the threat of an emergency including economic and Congress isn't
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:11.480]  involved and I saw all these neocons come out and say oh this is okay and I
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:14.160]  want to say good job Chuck Norris you know I don't normally come on here and
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:18.440]  say great job Chuck Norris the point is is that really he's flying in the face
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:24.840]  of dozens of neocon publications drudge called it like it was correctly day one
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:30.200]  Chuck Norris has called it correctly all the other neocons sites including and I
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:34.000]  like world Italy overall they wrote articles basically saying I was wrong
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.360]  and it wasn't that big of a deal I'm sorry I don't know what planet you're
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:42.480]  living on we're in trouble we're not in Kansas anymore they're sticking their
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:46.280]  hands down our pants there they're buying hundreds of millions of bullets
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:51.680]  armored mobile checkpoints federalization I mean you'd have to be
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:58.920]  crazy Sean Stone to not see that we're following a very accelerated trajectory
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:05.920]  towards open to talitarianism Sean Stone yes sir we had a question well no I
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:10.600]  mean I want your take on that this accelerated trajectory yeah I think I
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:12.760]  think it has a lot to do with economics I think it has to do with the
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:16.440]  economic meltdown that people like my friend Lynn LaRouche have talked about
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:19.600]  on your show and others have pointed out for years which is that this is not a
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:23.200]  sustainable trajectory of speculation that these that these banks have
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:25.920]  basically they've they've used the leverage of what used to be our
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:30.560]  industrial economy just you know to play games with derivatives and whatnot they
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:34.240]  they've basically leveraged themselves out they they're now bailing themselves
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:38.200]  out with up with the rest of our of our of our you know future wealth but
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:41.360]  overall they know that it's over it's in cotton you know it's contracting it's
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:44.920]  collapsing in Europe at the moment and who knows when it's going to go here I
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:48.560]  mean there's a lot behind the scenes that we don't know right Alex in terms of
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:52.880]  what the bankers are actually dealing with and assessing but I think the
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:57.160]  economic meltdown is exactly the reason why they are going rapidly towards this
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:00.760]  martial law scenario which is basically potentially you know how do you basically
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:03.440]  go to austerity measures in a country like the United States which is what
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:06.400]  they're doing in Greece for example right if you if you get those kind of
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:10.600]  austerity terms here do people come out and start revolutionary activities how
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:13.000]  do you quote it you know how do you basically make people disappear how do
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.880]  you arrest them as economic terrorists is you know whoever whatever kind of
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:19.720]  terrorists they want to name it just it's an it's a ridiculous term the point
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:22.280]  is you know it doesn't have any meaning it then they're no more no more than
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:26.520]  al-qaeda has meaning anymore because it just it's so amorphic and even military
[01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:29.600]  personnel will tell you that you know al-qaeda really doesn't exist it's
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:32.800]  what they it's what they decide to call you know that personal page part of
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:35.880]  that so don't stay there let's do five more minutes I want to hear some of the

[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:35.400]  over people but again you did a great job with the analysis you wrote the
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:42.400]  voiceover you did the video and the facts are posted info wars.com Obama
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:48.960]  impeachment 2012 in the time we have I mean this is a big deal this is this is
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:54.240]  crunch time here this is this is choke or fight back and survive we've got to
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:58.240]  scream bloody murder politically and as you said say look we know you're rigging
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:02.920]  both parties you blocked Ron Paul you're doing all this but we in the court of
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:07.120]  public opinion can and will expose you what are you asking the listeners to do
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:09.800]  I know I've begged them to get this video out to everybody they know in the
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:16.600]  article Curtin Emo wrote what are some other ideas you've got Sean no you're
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:19.600]  right I mean it's got to start with with informing the public and going through
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:23.200]  a rudimentary form of action call you congressman you know start just get
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:26.480]  politically aware have discussion I mean to me it's discussion is the
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:30.240]  launching point of all things we're launching website the war on evil.com
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:35.280]  and the premise of it is you know it is Plato said ignorance is the the stem
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:39.360]  and the root of all evil that's a great name the war on evil.com is that up
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:43.280]  yet it's it's it's up we're good we're adding content at the moment but the
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:49.160]  point is that it's up online you can just you can see a an hour long talk show
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:52.200]  that I hosted you know as a trial call what's really going on and it's my
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:56.680]  sudden it's me hosting with six people regular every day people talking in a
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:01.400]  different way I love the name the real resistance project no yeah right no
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:04.480]  the no the renaissance the real renaissance because the whole point is
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:07.160]  we want to renaissance we need a rebirth of creativity we need to spread
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:11.240]  creativity amongst our people and just think it to become aware big by becoming
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:16.760]  conscious that is the first step to see my mind read the real resistance yeah
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:20.280]  that too that we're building too man well we'll start a resistance project to
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:26.920]  no but I agree the resistance to their post-industrial eugenics gena 21 is the
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:32.720]  new renaissance I agree yeah yeah precisely because about creativity it's
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:36.280]  about inspiring the mind of man the mind of man is most powerful thing that is in
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:40.720]  the source of all wealth they can be created in society yes their monetary
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:45.280]  system which is the empire is collapsing it doesn't have real worth even gold is
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:48.600]  just the valuation what is the real gold is in the mind of man what you're able
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:53.800]  to invent what you're able to offer to you know to communicate to conceive of
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:57.400]  the world your perception that's the gold and the print the mind war is as you
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:01.080]  know you know the info war that's what's been waged and successfully won on the
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:05.280]  American people especially last 40 plus years since the cultural the counter
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:09.120]  culture revolution of our country 68 time period so now we're taking it back
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:12.840]  the new generation's gonna step up and say no we need we need to have access to
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:16.600]  democratic style forms of discussion and go back to our concept of a republic
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:20.120]  which is based on principle and right and interesting I had a good
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:22.920]  conversation with Jordan Maxwell last night who you I think you know pretty
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:26.520]  well as an Illuminati researcher and his whole point is look there's a
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:30.600]  corporation that runs the United States the US the US corporation was was it
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:34.760]  was incorporated around 1871 and they changed the constitutional constitutional
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:38.360]  verbiage from the Constitution of the United States the Constitution for the
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:42.000]  United States and that was for the new corporation that we now live under which
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  is why it's so easy for them to change the laws and so readily they don't care
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.440]  about the violent in the Constitution because the Constitution is for a
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:51.680]  corporation now not for the natural Constitution that was supposed to be
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:54.720]  given to us by our founding fathers so maybe in the course of having this
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:57.720]  impeachment process and actually going out and spreading the news will
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:01.240]  recognize the fact that wait a minute a corporation has taken over that
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:06.520]  republic which used to stand well I agree with you and we're at the
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:09.760]  crossroads right now and this is a powerful video that's been put together
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:13.560]  and I'm honored Sean that you contacted us because I know you've got a lot of

[02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:21.480]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:26.920]  okay let's go straight into your phone calls and then I'll get into the latest
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:35.320]  on Zbigniew Brzezinski a bunch of breaking news on Iran the economy we're
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:39.000]  going to get a quick update again because our reporter is on it with inside
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  sources what what Henningson said two days ago writing for info wars.com and
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.560]  here on the radio it's turned out to be true I was listening to Fox radio this
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:51.960]  morning and they were saying rumors are now in sources that they're preparing in
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:56.520]  the next 72 hours for a big announcement preparing you know lens credence to the
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:01.160]  fact that they're worried about civil unrest if they do not indict George
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:07.680]  Zimmerman and then they were cutting to reporters going well yes we're talking to
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:14.280]  people you know inside the prosecutor's office and it doesn't look like so again
[02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:20.760]  they're starting to lean towards all that but he says he has the source inside
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:24.680]  and I know Henningson does first-rate work I didn't even ask a source because
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:29.200]  it's a confidential source I mean as the editor of info wars.com I could make
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:37.600]  him tell me but I don't even want to know his source inside of the prosecutor's
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:42.520]  office there just like I had sources inside our Pios office but I had to send
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:47.480]  reporters there to confirm what my sources told me and indeed that is what
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:51.200]  they told us then on camera and of course it was Henningson out there doing
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:57.240]  those interviews as well okay and enough of that that's coming up right
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:02.040]  now let's go to Alan in Illinois Alan you're on the air welcome hey how you
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:05.880]  doing day Alex good hey I really appreciate everything you do and all
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:09.280]  the work you've been doing it means a lot to us that's a lot of us out here thank
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:13.800]  you I am I wouldn't take time to maybe talk to you for a minute about what
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:20.480]  happened with the action now I mean with the New York protests and the
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:25.440]  national protests I felt like as part of what happened here locally in Illinois
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:30.640]  I was at some of the demonstrations and the protests and it was rampant in
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:36.280]  disorganization and in people not actually knowing what they're trying to
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:40.360]  do well I mean that always happens during periods of unrest because of
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:44.080]  depressions I mean at first you're not gonna have organized groups you have the
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:47.000]  Democrats trying to take control of it and as soon as they couldn't take
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:51.840]  control of it they flushed it yes sir well you know I've been listening to
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:56.560]  you for a long time and trying to figure out the best way to try to put
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:00.480]  together what you're saying and into action and I put something together I
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:05.800]  call action now and it's it's written down here I'm putting the last you know
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:10.200]  in Zion I'm sorry I'm a little bit nervous haven't talked to you before but
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:15.760]  I'm putting the last on this and what it's doing is taking what I think is
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:20.080]  wrong and what you've been talking about whether it's the banking or the
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:24.680]  military actions or the safety of our food and water and I put it into what
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:30.520]  I call an umbrella and a tight plan and I'm hoping that maybe you would be
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:35.440]  interested in listening or taking some you know some time to help me finish
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:39.400]  this so I what I'm saying is accurate because I'm just the person who listens
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:43.280]  to what you say I'm not an expert in you know taxation I'm not an expert in
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:48.000]  economy but anyway just so I don't drag you on too much under action now just
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.560]  real quick I took each one of those letters from action now and I and I've
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:55.720]  put it into a little heading and under a it would be like abolish the American
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:12:00.520]  banking system the private banking system and in the Fed and under C you
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:04.560]  would say cancel all foreign military action offensive military action that
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:09.840]  is and under T you would say take steps to see that we have clean safe food and
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:15.000]  safe food water medicines and vaccines and on and on like you know insisting
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:19.280]  that the Constitution be reinstated and under oh I have overhauled the
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:24.680]  educational system and pop the college bubble and it goes on and on to where I
[02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:28.640]  think that one of the things that was happening when I was at this protest was
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:33.040]  everybody was standing around and it felt like everybody had an idea what
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:37.680]  they wanted but nobody had any cohesion so so that the policies could be moving
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:41.840]  forward but that was done on purpose Soros and others orchestrated everybody
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:46.680]  to show up at those meetings by leaving it nebulous and then tried to come in and
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:50.480]  act like there was no leadership and take control of it but anytime somebody
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:55.040]  brought leadership the operatives would activate and run you out they wanted
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:13:00.640]  protesters to project what the globalist wanted higher taxes to be paid to the
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:06.080]  elites as banker bailout money and when that didn't happen they had a
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:10.920]  coordinated homeland security raids in cities all over the country to arrest
[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:14.880]  and remove people I appreciate your call like interesting ideas that you raise
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:19.040]  and so that's what was done now they're moving on to trying to cause a race war
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:23.840]  as long as the people are out fighting and angry but don't know you know which
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:28.840]  direction they're going in that helps the banksters but your point about going
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:34.400]  after the private Federal Reserve it's just exposed that we don't have a
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:38.960]  legitimate government they own the two major parties at the top they're trying
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:43.760]  to take our liberties and little guys regardless of race color creed religion
[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:47.720]  have got to stick together for the Bill of Rights and Constitution and its
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:52.880]  enforcement so we don't get enslaved let's go to another call here Heather in

[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:03.040]  she actually she won in the appeals court they gave her her children back as a
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:07.360]  result of a lot of threats and intimidation I don't want to go into it
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:15.400]  too much the judge recused and they they the second judge pointed himself so she
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:20.920]  moved back home to Michigan and right now she has more paperwork in the court of
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:26.200]  appeals that she's awaiting decisions on but the fight's not over but the thing
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:31.000]  is the kids are safe they're with her and I know she wants me to thank you so
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.240]  much you're her hero but I wanted to mention the interview that you had with
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:40.640]  the IRS guy yes I totally agree with you at the end you said you know it's not
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:49.040]  about courage it's about self-preservation and you know you can only do so much
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:54.720]  Alex and you're covering the big topics everybody needs to stand up exactly
[02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:58.320]  you've got a fight in your area look God bless you ma'am I appreciate your call
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:01.280]  I want to say something about this right now that because this hit me this
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:05.120]  morning while I was exercising and hit me driving into work it hit me while she
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:10.480]  was talking the reason I get mad with people say you're a hero you've got
[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:17.120]  courage man you're one in a million you're so great I'm not I'm not I'm
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:23.720]  somebody who studied history so I recognize the signs of tyranny 20 years
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:29.920]  ago I got on air 17 years ago I took action there are people better looking
[02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:35.080]  more eloquent listening right now who have better organizational skills
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:39.840]  everything who could do better than what I've done in 17 years but I have
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:45.000]  persevered that's that's really one of the positive points and the system tries
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:48.640]  to tear me down on the image of Alex Jones they want to make it about Alex
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:53.040]  Jones so they can then destroy me and then try to destroy the idea of liberty
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:58.640]  and I have become a giant of resistance a giant of conspiracy as the mainstream
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:02.400]  media calls it not trusting known certified criminals and liars that's
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:07.080]  what a conspiracy theorist is thinking for yourself not being a chump that means
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:13.600]  conspiracy theorist but it isn't like oh great I reach tens of millions of people
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:17.720]  every week it's like wow what an incredible responsibility how do I do a
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:22.120]  better job that's why I get so excited when I see
[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:26.800]  Sean Stone doing something or Mike Adams that's why I get so excited when I
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:31.280]  see you do something is because I realize they're not gonna stop us and more
[02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:35.840]  and more people are taking action but it's not because you're a hero it's not
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:39.200]  because you're gonna go out and win every time you fight corruption it's
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:44.720]  because when you let evil take over things get very very destructive very
[02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:50.760]  very quickly there's no into it because just because you've got one level of
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:54.760]  corrupt people in place they're gonna get removed by the next level that's
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:18:00.920]  even worse and then on and on and on that's what happens we're in danger folks
[02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:08.200]  I'm not doing this because I'm a hero and I'm gonna fix it all I'm doing it
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:15.240]  because I'm trying to survive here I know history I know geopolitical systems
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:21.360]  and I've got something I want to show viewers if you go to info wars.com you
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:25.920]  can link through in the Obama impeachment article impeach Obama 2012 join
[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:29.640]  the national campaign is the name of the video but on the website it's just
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:35.600]  called Obama impeachment 2012 is the name of the article but I'm reading some of
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:40.840]  these during the last break and look at this person commenting here and I'm not
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:46.760]  mad that they're attacking me I'm sad because even if I just got involved in
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:50.560]  this they shouldn't be mad at me but the truth is I've been saying in peach
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:55.680]  Obama for over three years and I've been having the Congress people on the show
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:19:00.400]  you know how hard it is to get them on and I've been covering it I mean I've
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:03.280]  been the focal point of trying to impeach you I've been covering it every
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:09.360]  day intensely in the last year and they say it's about time somebody brings this
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:13.040]  to the service what happened to Alex Jones on this question mark question mark
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:15.800]  question mark what happened to you you certainly weren't watching the show or
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:20.880]  listening why have we not heard anything from Ron Paul I will say this we need to
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:24.000]  see more on Ron Paul about supporting the impeachment stuff I'm just I never
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:28.440]  criticized Ron Paul but he needs to go after Obama I said that day one make his
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:31.920]  campaign about that and didn't happen I said to him in the last interview I said
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:36.480]  go after him so that's what he's right on that but but don't throw the baby out
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:40.400]  of the bathwater something just doesn't seem right with his picture well some
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:44.520]  doesn't seem right with you saying I haven't been covering this and again
[02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:49.960]  don't go after people in the arena I want to see something out of all of you

[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:43.040]  i will attempt as best i can but again it's not that somebody criticizes me i
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:46.720]  don't care about that i don't care what nightline you know says i'm dangerous
[02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:51.440]  and evil i think i see that as a badge of honor that i'm drawing flak from some
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:57.680]  of the biggest enemy propaganda guns it's that when the average internet type
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:03.120]  person just always says jones is a fad and then and then that one ups to where
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:07.040]  they're a moral person because they've said they're good and i'm bad
[02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:12.320]  i know i'm good i know i'm real i know i'm a model of resistance and victory
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:16.720]  thanks to god's grace is your prayers and support and i want to live up
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:21.120]  to the great honor and potential i've been given but i really want to teach
[02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:25.280]  others that they have power and when people lie
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:29.680]  because nine nine percent of the time it's just total made-up garbage
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:33.280]  you know alex hasn't been covering obama impeachment
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:36.880]  what do you mean i've been the very tip of the spear i've been criticized for
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:40.480]  promoting it alex didn't cover in this executive order
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:44.000]  for martial law what are you talking about alex isn't
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.040]  covering india a alex isn't covering the new
[02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:51.920]  chopa bill alex what are you talking about it's all i do
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:56.560]  and i just think of the person behind their keyboard who decides to complain
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:26:01.120]  about somebody who's in the arena bloodied while they fit in the stands
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:05.120]  picking their nose and eating their boogers and i hate to use that analogy
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:08.560]  but that's basically spiritually what they're doing
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:12.560]  i mean i'm out here with a shield and a club fighting a big cyclops
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:16.720]  and i got you know all these political cuts and all sorts of stuff
[02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:21.280]  and and and dust in my eyes and and and and my throats you know dry and i'm
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:24.480]  bleeding and they're up there in the stands going he ought to be in the
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:29.360]  arena i can't believe he's in mawai right now laying out in the sun
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:32.640]  can i have another pina colada please they're actually in mawai
[02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:36.640]  watching me in the arena on a big screen tv
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:40.960]  and i'm in the arena they're in pina colada i'm gonna go surfing look at him
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:43.920]  i can't believe he's in mawai drinking a pina colada
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:49.120]  it's just like it hurts me in that i realize they're this weak
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:54.320]  they're this pathetic they're this weird i mean i have trouble criticizing
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:59.680]  people who are in the arena i i i just don't get it
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:03.280]  i'm trying to build people up i'm trying to find other leaders i'm trying to
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:06.480]  form the best resistance i can i soul search
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:10.080]  how i can be more effective i beat myself up not doing enough
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:16.160]  and then i just see somebody saying alex isn't covering impeachment i'm sick of it
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:18.960]  and people are like don't respond to the trolls alex

[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:33.440]  just want to gripe

[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:15.280]  and i've done research there's some other good filters out there that are
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:20.640]  gravity fed but if you want a lower price and the next level bigger
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:24.800]  filters faster no priming higher quality impregnated with colloidal

[02:36:58.080 --> 02:37:01.120]  levels things like fluoride designed to go through things
[02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:06.080]  it only reduces it but if you put the special fluoride filters on
[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:08.880]  that's a chemical process it reduces it down to almost nothing but there's
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:11.520]  still some the point is is that it's good for your

[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:13.600]  i feel sorry for them too because they're obviously current on their
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:16.720]  vaccines and that's what i mean the weird thing is it's like a culture of
[02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:20.640]  eh he's not doing enough it's like a it's like you make yourself big
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:25.040]  by saying somebody else isn't doing enough and it's like so pathetic and
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:28.000]  loser-ish and i noticed it not just with me
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:32.480]  it's culture wide it's like all these wimps that think they're really tough
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:37.040]  and want to tell you you know how they were at uh
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:41.040]  you know the jiu-jitsu training all day and i'm just like good good okay

[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:46.320]  tyranny it's it's like a game of one
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:49.280]  auspiceship but i'm sorry go ahead no problem at all
[02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:52.000]  listen that's the reason i called in because i called to tell you about a
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:55.200]  vaccine injury that i sustained in february
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:58.720]  uh because people need to know how sinister the system is and trying to get
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:02.320]  us vaccinated that's one of their their methods of trying to
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:06.240]  kill us you've told us that many times and this is a new level
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:10.560]  of loneliness for sure now just a very quick background when i was
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:14.720]  serving in the air force i was in an accident i broke my thoracic spine
[02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:18.560]  you know they basically frightened they basically fused it put me in a body cast
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:22.880]  and you know said good luck with that well during the 10 years that i spent
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:26.880]  fighting with the va for benefits i rehabbed myself in and out of a body
[02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:30.160]  cast and all that they couldn't care less about me
[02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:33.840]  well anyway luckily i rehabbed myself because i learned about alternative
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:38.080]  health care and organic food now so i never had to take
[02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:42.800]  any pain meds at all for the chronic pain but but a couple times a year i would
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:47.360]  get serious migraine headaches you know i know you've talked about
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:49.680]  migraines before you've had them you know they're bad
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:54.000]  that's different than chronic pain yeah it hurts so bad it feels good
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.880]  i was out i don't have a lot of migraines it's always allergy related i went
[02:39:56.880 --> 02:40:00.320]  every time i go bike riding during a really bad allergy time
[02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:05.120]  with and i was having a migraine so bad one time it was like explosions of pain
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:08.960]  and it was so painful it went beyond being painful
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:13.280]  i don't know how to explain it but go ahead well on february 7th i was in i
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:16.560]  was three days into one of those episodes and in the middle of the night i
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:19.600]  called a friend i was vomiting the whole thing
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:24.320]  and he insisted let's go the er well they had to give me heavy narcotics at first
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:28.560]  just to get the pain under control and i told them listen this is omeg nasal
[02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:32.560]  spray helps me please just to administer that yes well
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:35.280]  they tried to be you know give me attitude because i was trying to tell
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:37.920]  them what to do so long story short what happened
[02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:42.560]  so long story short they gave me two doses of this omeg and i thought how
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:45.920]  strange they gave me two doses but i was so out of it from whatever they had
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:49.840]  already given me i didn't get it and they wouldn't let my friend in with me
[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:54.720]  well after three days of uncontrollable vomiting and other bodily fluids
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:58.000]  i i ordered my medical records from the hospital
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.720]  they had given me the flu zone nasal mist they gave me
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:05.600]  one's omeg and then they gave me that flu zone
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:09.840]  nasal mist which is a flu vaccine i told them i didn't know no no no no they
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:12.640]  they forcibly do this all the time with children
[02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:16.080]  adults it's in the news they're training the medical system to just do
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:20.160]  whatever they want and since you mentioned vaccines i've talked to
[02:41:20.160 --> 02:41:24.080]  people that are only one person's like 52
[02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:28.240]  but the point is so many people that are getting the flu shots now
[02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:32.400]  go numb or get neurological disorders or get
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:35.600]  Alzheimer's when they're in their fifties it is
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:39.120]  an epidemic and old people are getting it and a lot of times
[02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:43.200]  they quote get the Alzheimer's two days after they've had the shots so now
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:47.440]  doctors are saying give kids painkillers this is in the news today
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:51.440]  it's up at info wars.com for natural news or at least give kids
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:54.880]  high-powered Tylenol when they're given a shot to help them sleep
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:58.720]  because so many of them are getting sick and complaining after the shots
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:03.680]  or even having convulsions they found if they give them an anti-inflammatory
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:09.200]  of some type that either liquid ibuprofen or
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:12.560]  for whatever reason they say that the Tylenol is having an anti-inflammatory
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:15.680]  that they won't have it that's how devastating it is
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:19.120]  is they're talking about administering painkillers with vaccines so what
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:22.720]  happened to you after the uh they got go you've got a headache
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:25.280]  you think a nasal spray will help bring down the inflammation that's what
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:27.520]  happens to me i get a big sinus thing and then boom
[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:32.240]  off the races and so they said we'll give you something lady
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:37.040]  been in bed since then and i am a yoga teacher i teach chi gong and tai chi

[02:42:40.160 --> 02:42:44.240]  and i have been in bed for two months since since february seven
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:47.600]  well listen we have a good family friend who was uh you know olympic swimmer
[02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:51.840]  whole nine yards in great shape he was supposed to go in for one stent
[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:55.040]  the doctor put like 14 stents in his heart he didn't need
[02:42:55.040 --> 02:42:58.160]  turns out that doctor did it all the time he just won a lawsuit against him
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:01.760]  and i'm not a litigious person but when they're wrong they're wrong you
[02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:06.000]  should sue them for doing a medical procedure that you told
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:09.440]  them don't give to me and you need and even if they beat it it
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:12.880]  doesn't matter you've got to teach these scumbags
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:16.480]  these little medical tyrants they're not god i appreciate your call
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:23.200]  we're going to go to jay paul um sam john and others uh here in just a
[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:26.400]  moment but i wanted to get a quick update from patrick
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:30.160]  henningsson now if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv right now i want to
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:33.680]  show you a document cam shot right here of two different articles both these
[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:40.640]  right here and on this you can see a jones report
[02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:45.040]  article from february 15th 2007 that's now a derelict
[02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:47.520]  website we had that as an ode to drudge but
[02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:50.000]  they don't have the personnel so we don't really even update that site it's
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:53.360]  kind of an emergency backup out there in case they ever seize our other servers
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:56.720]  or domains we've got jones report info wars dot net a few of the little
[02:43:56.720 --> 02:44:01.920]  juicies out there uh but the point is is that it says neo-nazi rally was
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:05.760]  organized by fbhi informant and it's got him being questioned he admits he's an
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:09.120]  fbi operative this is the same area of orlando
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:13.040]  where they always have the white supremacist on record orlando sentinel
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:16.720]  run by the government marching through the black neighborhoods on a yearly
[02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:20.160]  basis trying to start a race war so it's a key beta test area
[02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:24.480]  now they have the black panthers the new black panthers
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:28.080]  saying kill whitey there's not enough blood burned down orlando
[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:32.080]  and they don't get in trouble they're on record saying murder white people
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:36.000]  burned down florida nobody gets in trouble
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:41.520]  that's because nbc's caught editing tapes of where 911's like uh yes mr
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:47.040]  zemberman uh is he black his panic why i'm a color uh well he uh
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:51.360]  you know looks like he's black they edit that into the earlier tape where they're
[02:44:51.360 --> 02:44:54.000]  like yeah he's acting weird walking around in circles
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:57.680]  he's either up to no good or on something
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:01.600]  they edit it together yeah he's he looks like he's black
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:04.480]  he's bad
[02:45:05.840 --> 02:45:09.360]  i mean that's that these are cold-blooded crooks
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:16.080]  nbc is in bed more than anybody with obama i mean they want a race war here
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:20.640]  and i've already gotten into how turner being a federal agent that came out
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:24.880]  only federal agents are allowed to say stuff like that okay
[02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:28.480]  if you got up on air even on a small station
[02:45:28.480 --> 02:45:32.240]  and said burn down buildings start killing white people or black people
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:35.760]  and if you weren't a fed you would be arrested within
[02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:42.160]  12 hours guarantee guarantee happens all the time
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:46.320]  you're not a fed you go to jail you're a fed you can do whatever you want and
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:49.760]  they are feds 100 or they're useful idiots
[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:52.800]  and here's the latest article by patrick henningsson who's been on fire
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:56.880]  lately splc on new black panthers there's no
[02:45:56.880 --> 02:46:00.080]  such thing as hate speech patrick henningsson and
[02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:02.240]  erin dykes and they interviewed him yesterday they
[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:06.080]  he called up and got lord potock hey i want to call potock ourselves and
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:11.200]  invite him on the show the head creature over there
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:14.640]  i heard some interesting things about potock off the record from some people
[02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:19.760]  that worked there they're like oh he's a nice guy
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:25.360]  he's a i'm not even gonna go there
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:31.920]  anyways go back to okay well if you are a nice guy then repent potock
[02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:39.200]  i mean i was told how i'm not gonna get into it it'll give away who it is
[02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:42.640]  the point is is that
[02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:47.040]  you guys helped set up the elehiem city group and the whole
[02:46:47.040 --> 02:46:50.880]  mcveigh thing and that and that got covered up
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:55.520]  and then and you're involved in so much of the stuff and now you're you're not
[02:46:55.520 --> 02:46:59.360]  saying the black the new black panther party is bad he's saying new
[02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:03.360]  it's new black panther not old black panthers totally different group
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:09.120]  this is the new federal idiot group i'm not defending perfectly everything the
[02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:13.280]  old black panthers did but they did some good this is the federal model of that
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:17.360]  i take you now to patrick henningsson patrick this is a big deal tell us about
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:20.720]  your conversation with him and i want you to call him back
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:24.480]  and record the conversation let him know you're doing it tell us about
[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:28.480]  your stroke of genius which i ought to do that's common sense actually
[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:33.840]  calling up lord potock and what he said to you yeah i called mark potock um
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:38.960]  and spoke to uh southern poverty law center and i the conversation started i
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:42.800]  wanted confirmation from the uh southern poverty law center
[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:47.200]  that there were in fact neo-nazi armed patrols uh marauding through the
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:51.520]  streets of stanford and uh to rightly so they they he
[02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:56.160]  denied that those reports were uh true and of course we debunked that
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:48:00.400]  yesterday well they're attacking people and they're obviously fed run
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:03.760]  so i so i said to myself they don't want to get that shut down i'm sorry go
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:06.560]  ahead i asked him directly i said what about this radio
[02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:10.080]  broadcast with the new black panthers calling for blood in the streets get
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:13.920]  suited and booted kill cracker and so forth i said
[02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:16.560]  and a dead or alive bounty on the head of george zimmerman
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:20.960]  for ten thousand dollars and he said i said is this not hate speech can can
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:25.120]  these people be arrested he said there's no such thing as hate speech
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:28.560]  he's all because this is a group that pushes that Soviet idea
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:32.400]  of the speech no it's a terrorist threat racketeering but but obviously what
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:36.400]  they would call hate speech so now mr hate speech says it doesn't exist
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:39.120]  yeah they're selective they're they're they're targeting uh
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:42.880]  the citizen militia groups particularly minute man groups all over the country
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:46.320]  actually aren't racist it didn't do anything like the hatari who said i
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:49.680]  hope things don't get much worse we may have to defend ourselves
[02:48:49.680 --> 02:48:53.200]  exactly i told erin and i broke that down completely
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:56.400]  an article that's up on info wars dot com right now
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:01.040]  but the the breaking news alex for the zimmerman case special prosecutor is
[02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:04.960]  going to announce on wednesday that zimmerman will be charged
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:10.240]  but not with uh first-degree murder okay and this has been controlled that right
[02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:14.080]  back well wait wait wait wait stop where because you have a source inside
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:17.280]  who said that they weren't going to charge him with the
[02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:21.360]  murder or manslaughter or capital one or any of those different variants
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:24.480]  but i guess now because the pressure worried about stuff
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:28.320]  or maybe the locals understand that obama wants to have a race war breakout
[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:31.200]  that they're going to charge him what were the weapons charge or where'd you
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:35.280]  get this information i've got a source a judge inside the central
[02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:39.440]  florida court system in sanford okay so this is right in the heart of what's
[02:49:39.440 --> 02:49:42.640]  going on now this is breaking here you're saying
[02:49:42.640 --> 02:49:47.360]  you have a judge who's called you that he will be charged tell us what it is
[02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:52.080]  well um he told me they said that there might be a grand jury or a charge but
[02:49:52.080 --> 02:49:56.160]  it's not going to be for first-degree murder now this is just broken in the
[02:49:56.160 --> 02:49:58.880]  washington post about 10 minutes ago as well
[02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:02.480]  they and washington post has said uh it's all over the news media right now
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:05.920]  that zimmerman will be charged now the special
[02:50:05.920 --> 02:50:11.120]  prosecutor uh quarry in in sanford she hasn't specified what
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:15.200]  that charge is going to be so this uh does follow along the
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:19.040]  earlier leads and information that i got that said that this is being
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:22.880]  directed by the department of justice zimmerman's
[02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:26.400]  lawyers have been ordered off the case they say they've
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:29.520]  dismissed himself but they have been ordered off the case
[02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:33.440]  there's gonna be uh there's a new lawyer on and zimmerman's been transferred out
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:35.840]  of state he's out he's out of florida right now
[02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:39.520]  now what exactly were you told by the judge and i mean how do we know he's
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:43.600]  right well uh he he he gave me his best
[02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:47.760]  uh prediction which was that this uh is going to move
[02:50:47.760 --> 02:50:52.880]  away from a rate a racial uh themed event anti-gun
[02:50:52.880 --> 02:50:57.520]  yes no well too to redefining self-defense as far as the florida laws
[02:50:57.520 --> 02:51:00.080]  are concerned and this could have effects nationally
[02:51:00.080 --> 02:51:04.320]  but that of course as we know is an entree into a second amendment
[02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:07.760]  and this is something obama is going to do in the second term
[02:51:07.760 --> 02:51:10.320]  and also well that's what they've been planning so now they're gonna make it
[02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:13.120]  where you like like england you can't even shoot somebody in your own house
[02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:17.040]  basically yeah obama can't do this in his first term he has to wait till after
[02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:20.480]  the election this whole george zimmerman uh trevon martin
[02:51:20.480 --> 02:51:25.600]  escapade is basically softening the soil for what's coming in the second term
[02:51:25.600 --> 02:51:29.440]  which is an attack on gun restrictions for
[02:51:29.440 --> 02:51:32.640]  for starters and that's all obviously knocking on the door of the second
[02:51:32.640 --> 02:51:35.840]  amendment but the important thing here at alex's
[02:51:35.840 --> 02:51:41.120]  obama when he said when i have a son he he if i had a son he'd look like trevon
[02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:44.400]  martin that wasn't a random comment when the president of the
[02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:48.560]  states comments on a uh ongoing investigation that has
[02:51:48.560 --> 02:51:51.600]  nothing to do with the federal government how would ron paul
[02:51:51.600 --> 02:51:56.640]  and uh comment on that well look at msnbc and editing editing audio i mean
[02:51:56.640 --> 02:52:00.160]  these people are incredible so you're saying you talk to a judge that is in
[02:52:00.160 --> 02:52:04.640]  the town and he said it's his prediction or the intel he's got is
[02:52:04.640 --> 02:52:08.800]  they're gonna try some gun charge no he said they're gonna revisit
[02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:13.040]  the stand your ground law and i don't know but did he give you any hint of
[02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:15.440]  what type of charge they're gonna have for zimmerman
[02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:18.880]  he didn't give me any hint on charge i think that's going to be up to the
[02:52:18.880 --> 02:52:23.360]  special prosecutor but my guess is that it's not going it's going to be a gun
[02:52:23.360 --> 02:52:27.040]  charge it's not going to be a uh first-degree murder
[02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:30.160]  charge now the basically the whole the whole point of
[02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:32.800]  this is this is a uh this stinks all the way up to
[02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:36.480]  washington dc and well i mean look at mexico they had the
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:40.320]  leader of that just last week say ban your guns you cause our violence no the
[02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:43.760]  drugs your government helps produce do it and the guns our government shipped
[02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:47.440]  into it they plan to blame that so now they make it a shival rights issue this
[02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:51.840]  is already begun where blacks are like hand the guns in or you're racist
[02:52:51.840 --> 02:52:55.600]  yeah and it's going to be a controlled uh stage trial which is going to be like
[02:52:55.600 --> 02:52:59.120]  an oj simpson kind of circus and in the end uh
[02:52:59.120 --> 02:53:03.680]  if you it's quite likely that zimmerman will be a uh you won't be charged with
[02:53:03.680 --> 02:53:07.280]  any first-degree murder charge but it will open up a whole
[02:53:07.280 --> 02:53:10.640]  national conversation to be dominated on cnn fox
[02:53:10.640 --> 02:53:15.520]  nbc and all the rest of it to talk about gun restrictions in america
[02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:18.480]  and this is an entree into obama's second term
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:23.360]  where they do doj wants to do some serious damage to the second amendment
[02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:27.600]  and obama did not say that randomly that comment about trevon
[02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:30.960]  looking like his son his son that was engineered
[02:53:30.960 --> 02:53:34.240]  as you can see eric holder has come and intervened
[02:53:34.240 --> 02:53:37.600]  in in what is a florida affair it's not a federal
[02:53:37.600 --> 02:53:41.840]  a matter at all there's nothing to do with the fbi no interstate trafficking
[02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:45.360]  nothing so you we can see right here exactly what it is
[02:53:45.360 --> 02:53:49.680]  it's a top-down engineered controlled event
[02:53:49.680 --> 02:53:52.960]  all right well we're gonna watch they have announced this this morning the 72
[02:53:52.960 --> 02:53:55.600]  hour announcement so we'll know in two and a half days
[02:53:55.600 --> 02:53:59.680]  from now and we'll find out if your judge friend is uh accurate in this
[02:53:59.680 --> 02:54:04.000]  uh but they've got four witnesses saying that uh zimmerman was being attacked
[02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:07.200]  by trevon martin and and there's something else alex
[02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:11.760]  uh the there's a story and the reason this won't fly in the grand jury
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:14.320]  a year ago this is according to the police department
[02:54:14.320 --> 02:54:19.040]  george zimmerman helped a homeless black man who was beaten by the son
[02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:23.360]  of a policeman and it was covered up and zimmerman went to black churches
[02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:28.880]  and eventually got a uh help to get a conviction against a policeman's son
[02:54:28.880 --> 02:54:32.640]  that's right and he and he marched in the groups now it's it's all a total made
[02:54:32.640 --> 02:54:36.560]  up scyop and it's going to be used to go after our guns the r.a got the intel
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:40.800]  that he does plan to ban semi autos physical holding of them i mean we're
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:44.800]  talking actual confiscation next administration and and and folks believe
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:47.760]  me you've seen all this other tyranny they will try
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:52.240]  or do anything patrick thank you so much

[02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:03.360]  year alex hey buddy
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:07.680]  hey often often what you're doing with uh strong stone fly i'm so excited to be
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:10.480]  on and i've kind of been wanting to get on the last
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:15.440]  couple weeks when it hit me listening to your show and uh and then the roost
[02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:21.200]  um that this is everything if if he doesn't get impeached before the election
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:24.720]  it's everything but this is the way that we can really do it legally
[02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:28.400]  it's it's obama's first order of business and i know you covered it back at
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:34.000]  the time executive order one three four eight nine
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:38.320]  everybody can look it up and it was literally changing
[02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:41.680]  the national archive of the executive branch
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:45.760]  so that every bit of his record is exposed
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:49.600]  if we can expose that or make a congressional
[02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:53.200]  inquiry into that you're right and he's the guy that said he would be the most
[02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:57.680]  transparent i mean it's it's a new level of deception and lying
[02:55:57.680 --> 02:56:01.760]  that's why we've got to move to impeaching to rebuke all this and say
[02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:05.200]  it's illegal that's why we've launched impeach obama 2012

[02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:21.440]  even if we don't get the impeachment we rebuke it in the court of public
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:25.040]  opinion when they try to restrict our second amendment we say you're terrorist
