[00:00.000 --> 00:24.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide on July 1, 2019 from the Info Wars
[00:24.760 --> 00:29.400]  News Center in Austin in defiance of the globalist on TV and radio satellites, on hundreds of
[00:29.400 --> 00:36.040]  radio and TV stations, on global shortwave and dominating at infowars.com, newswars.com,
[00:36.040 --> 00:39.880]  prisonplanet.com and Paul Watson's great site, summit.news.
[00:39.880 --> 00:41.080]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:41.080 --> 00:45.200]  You know, I have an incredibly full plate of the Democrats' promised terror, anti-fuzz
[00:45.200 --> 00:50.440]  hitting people over the head with crowbars, throwing acid attacks on people.
[00:50.440 --> 00:51.440]  That's what it is.
[00:51.440 --> 00:53.440]  These concrete attacks have lime in them.
[00:53.440 --> 00:54.440]  It's all coming up.
[00:54.440 --> 00:59.280]  But first, I want to air this piece that I've aired Friday, Sunday and today because it's
[00:59.280 --> 01:04.320]  so important remembering how evil the globalist are and the Democrats that their operating
[01:04.320 --> 01:09.480]  system is killing children and hating humanity while they claim give them all the power because
[01:09.480 --> 01:10.480]  they love humanity.
[01:10.480 --> 01:11.880]  No, they hate children.
[01:11.880 --> 01:12.880]  They hate life.
[01:12.880 --> 01:13.880]  They hate everybody.
[01:13.880 --> 01:14.880]  They hate themselves.
[01:14.880 --> 01:15.880]  Here's the report.
[01:15.880 --> 01:20.600]  Our main story tonight concerns breast implants.
[01:20.600 --> 01:24.400]  Some are against them, others believe they're fine in rare cases, and many believe you should
[01:24.400 --> 01:27.000]  be able to get them whenever the f*** you want.
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.600]  Sorry, did I say breast implants?
[01:29.600 --> 01:30.600]  I meant abortions.
[01:30.600 --> 01:31.600]  Tonight's main topic concerns abortion.
[01:31.600 --> 01:36.600]  So tonight, in honor of America, I'd like to do a salute to abortion in the brink of
[01:36.600 --> 01:37.600]  10th annual salute to abortion.
[01:37.600 --> 01:38.600]  Get out of my behind.
[01:38.600 --> 01:39.600]  Get out of my vagina.
[01:39.600 --> 01:40.600]  Get out.
[01:40.600 --> 01:53.440]  It's a woman's body and she should not be forced to carry anything inside of it, wouldn't
[01:53.440 --> 01:54.440]  make her keep a tapeworm.
[01:54.440 --> 01:55.440]  Is that how the heart beats?
[01:55.440 --> 01:56.440]  So you're comparing a baby to a tapeworm?
[01:56.440 --> 01:57.440]  A fetus is a parasite, sweetie.
[01:57.440 --> 01:58.440]  That is not what a fetus looks like, okay?
[01:58.440 --> 01:59.440]  It's a couple of cells in 12 weeks.
[01:59.440 --> 02:00.440]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right?
[02:00.440 --> 02:01.440]  How can you do a job?
[02:01.440 --> 02:02.440]  How can you do a job?
[02:02.440 --> 02:11.440]  How many did I adopt?
[02:11.440 --> 02:12.440]  I kill my kids.
[02:12.440 --> 02:14.440]  Well, that's what you do to babies, huh?
[02:14.440 --> 02:15.440]  I love it.
[02:15.440 --> 02:16.440]  You love it, huh?
[02:16.440 --> 02:17.440]  Yeah, I do.
[02:17.440 --> 02:18.440]  Okay.
[02:18.440 --> 02:19.440]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[02:19.440 --> 02:20.440]  Oh, I'd never go to Christ.
[02:20.440 --> 02:21.440]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[02:21.440 --> 02:22.440]  No, I don't go to Christ.
[02:22.440 --> 02:23.440]  A fertilized egg is a human being.
[02:23.440 --> 02:24.440]  Yeah.
[02:24.440 --> 02:25.440]  A fertilized egg is a human being.
[02:25.440 --> 02:26.440]  You're a pain.
[02:26.440 --> 02:27.440]  Because I don't want to come to babies.
[02:27.440 --> 02:28.440]  Oh, you kill them.
[02:28.440 --> 02:33.440]  You let them live so they can starve to death.
[02:33.440 --> 02:36.440]  Why'd you spit at us?
[02:36.440 --> 02:38.440]  I don't agree with you.
[02:38.440 --> 02:41.440]  No uterus, no right to talk about it.
[02:41.440 --> 02:42.440]  Understand me, motherfucker?
[02:42.440 --> 02:49.440]  In the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother
[02:49.440 --> 02:51.940]  just prior to the birth of the baby.
[02:51.940 --> 02:58.320]  Now, you can say that that's okay, and Hillary can say that that's okay, but it's not okay
[02:58.320 --> 02:59.320]  with me.
[02:59.320 --> 03:05.200]  Well, that is not what happens in these cases, and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just
[03:05.200 --> 03:06.200]  terribly unfortunate.
[03:06.200 --> 03:12.000]  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lit up the One World Trade Center Spire in Pink to celebrate
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.760]  his radical expansion of abortion in New York.
[03:14.760 --> 03:19.520]  State lawmakers approved a law permitting abortion in the state for any reason until
[03:19.520 --> 03:23.200]  a 24th week of pregnancy and then up until birth.
[03:23.200 --> 03:26.880]  If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[03:26.880 --> 03:32.000]  The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.280]  be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion
[03:37.280 --> 03:39.880]  would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[03:39.880 --> 03:41.880]  There was a question over here.
[03:41.880 --> 03:42.880]  Yes.
[03:42.880 --> 03:45.880]  Are you for third trimester abortions?
[03:45.880 --> 03:49.880]  My answer to you is that that should be a decision that the woman makes.
[03:49.880 --> 03:56.840]  There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult
[03:56.840 --> 03:57.840] .
[03:57.840 --> 03:59.360]  Is it okay to still have children?
[03:59.360 --> 04:04.320]  How do you justify the decision to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for
[04:04.320 --> 04:05.320]  free?
[04:05.320 --> 04:06.320]  That's your time.
[04:06.320 --> 04:07.320]  Next speaker.
[04:07.320 --> 04:14.320]  Here's a new video out on informers.com of two partial birth abortions, eight-and-a-half
[04:14.320 --> 04:19.200]  month old babies, and it makes you want to kill people.
[04:19.200 --> 04:22.280]  I'm going to just be honest with you right now.
[04:22.280 --> 04:29.440]  My guts, my spirit sees a baby who got killed and its brain sucked out by some ass and then
[04:29.440 --> 04:30.760]  they make a joke out of it.
[04:30.760 --> 04:37.160]  These are abortion doctors with third trimester babies that were about to be born, the filing
[04:37.160 --> 04:40.040]  them, the jokes about them that they're having a fight.
[04:40.040 --> 04:47.720]  They're playing with dead babies in a little medical pan, and it was pretty shocking, gruesome
[04:47.720 --> 04:51.200]  stuff to see and just a total lack of regard for humanity.
[04:51.200 --> 04:52.200]  That's just absolutely amazing.
[04:52.200 --> 04:53.200]  We're going to have Debbie Johnson.
[04:53.200 --> 04:54.200]  I'm sorry.
[04:54.200 --> 04:58.200]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[04:58.200 --> 05:09.360]  The other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[05:09.360 --> 05:13.200]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed
[05:13.200 --> 05:17.440]  by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government, it is completely
[05:17.440 --> 05:18.440]  independent of all that.
[05:18.440 --> 05:24.240]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[05:24.240 --> 05:28.120]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[05:28.120 --> 05:32.440]  the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[05:32.440 --> 05:36.000]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.880]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[05:39.880 --> 05:43.960]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to
[05:43.960 --> 05:48.040]  have or express or hear and the InfoWars audience has broken through that.
[05:48.040 --> 05:52.880]  They are the bridge from the use of founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy
[05:52.880 --> 05:56.800]  and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming
[05:56.800 --> 06:03.480]  defamation, lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[06:03.480 --> 06:10.200]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[06:10.200 --> 06:29.440]  the Info War.
[06:29.440 --> 06:38.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to hear a world exclusive piece of information hiding
[06:38.320 --> 06:42.240]  in plain view.
[06:42.240 --> 06:49.960]  There are so many angles to this, but here's the fact, I have reviewed in the last two
[06:49.960 --> 06:54.600]  days more than a hundred videos, we're going to be presenting many of them here, they're
[06:54.600 --> 07:05.840]  up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, Antifa engaged in more than twenty acid attacks
[07:05.840 --> 07:16.440]  in Portland, damaging the eyesight and eating the skin off of more than 15 people's faces
[07:16.440 --> 07:23.200]  and Fox News is only focusing on one person saying he had a milkshake thrown on him.
[07:23.200 --> 07:27.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, Antifa pledged two weeks ago and again yesterday to attack the
[07:27.760 --> 07:33.240]  Trump pro-America rally coming up July 4th in D.C. They pledged to block the entrances
[07:33.240 --> 07:39.920]  to get in near the White House area and they said we are preparing acid attacks and put
[07:39.920 --> 07:45.360]  out the ingredients list and also talked about attacking Tucker Carlson's house, ladies
[07:45.360 --> 07:47.120]  and gentlemen.
[07:47.120 --> 07:58.160]  This is unprecedented evil.
[07:58.160 --> 08:03.200]  So pulling back from this, did you hear what I just said?
[08:03.200 --> 08:09.040]  We have the videos, we have the audio, we have the photos, we have them admitting it
[08:09.040 --> 08:14.360]  on the Antifa site in D.C., the Antifa site in Portland, Oregon, the Antifa sites in San
[08:14.360 --> 08:20.960]  Francisco, the Antifa sites in Austin, Texas, that there are different ways to produce acid
[08:20.960 --> 08:28.000]  compounds and to then throw them on people to blind them.
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, they themselves shared, and there's photos and videos that are on
[08:32.440 --> 08:44.360]  screen if you're a TV viewer, that they were going to mix quick-setting concrete and throw
[08:44.360 --> 08:46.080]  it in people's faces.
[08:46.080 --> 08:47.760]  Why would you do that?
[08:47.760 --> 08:53.600]  Because when it's setting, for about an hour after it gets mixed, it will put your eyes
[08:53.600 --> 09:02.400]  out because it has forms of bleach in it and lime activated by the limestone dust, calcium
[09:02.400 --> 09:14.640]  sulfate, aluminide, and amorphous silica, calcium, sulfa-aluminate, and other deadly
[09:14.640 --> 09:17.280]  chemicals when mixed.
[09:17.280 --> 09:18.680]  That's why it's quick-setting.
[09:18.680 --> 09:22.120]  It has a chemical acid reaction.
[09:22.120 --> 09:26.280]  Now I worked in construction off and on in high school and college because I could pick
[09:26.280 --> 09:30.120]  up 20 bucks an hour doing some work here, doing some work there.
[09:30.120 --> 09:33.280]  Very hard-working folks in construction.
[09:33.280 --> 09:39.240]  You wear thick industrial gloves, you wear goggles, you wear a breather if you're dealing
[09:39.240 --> 09:42.240]  with a large mix of it.
[09:42.240 --> 09:45.080]  You've got to wear rubber boots when you get into it.
[09:45.080 --> 09:50.400]  And let me tell you, it's man's work because it gets through the gloves, it gets under
[09:50.400 --> 09:55.440]  the things, it eats little holes in you.
[09:55.440 --> 09:58.280]  Portland PD report on adipomix and concrete into milkshakes.
[09:58.280 --> 10:00.560]  This creates acid-like chemical weapons.
[10:00.560 --> 10:02.440]  So, oh, Jack Pasobic gets it.
[10:02.440 --> 10:05.560]  I searched all yesterday and found no one getting this.
[10:05.560 --> 10:09.920]  So this is a chemical weapon.
[10:09.920 --> 10:15.240]  This is a chemical weapon.
[10:15.240 --> 10:28.360]  So ferrite is a dark brown crystalline phase commonly found in cements in the cement industry
[10:28.360 --> 10:30.440]  and is termed ferrite.
[10:30.440 --> 10:34.560]  It also exists in nature as a rare mineral.
[10:34.560 --> 10:36.960]  And then it goes on to talk about what it'll do to you.
[10:36.960 --> 10:44.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, lime is what the mafia dumps on top bodies to basically eat them.
[10:44.040 --> 10:46.520]  Mix acid.
[10:46.520 --> 10:51.280]  So they mix all these acid compounds together that when they come together have a chemical
[10:51.280 --> 10:58.320]  reaction that makes the concrete set quickly and fuses all of the silica together and they
[10:58.320 --> 10:59.320]  throw it in your face.
[10:59.320 --> 11:01.720]  And that's why when you look at the photos and the videos, people that were hit with
[11:01.720 --> 11:06.560]  it, their skin is all burned, their eyes are all totally bloody and bloodshot.
[11:06.560 --> 11:08.960]  They will guarantee you have vision loss.
[11:08.960 --> 11:13.040]  So what you're looking at is a mass terrorist of your TV viewer, radio listeners, the articles
[11:13.040 --> 11:19.480]  are on infowars.com, literally mixing acid attacks.
[11:19.480 --> 11:25.000]  And then notice the left is all about deception, calling it milkshake attacks.
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.840]  And then we've seen prominent Democrats, prominent BBC reporters, prominent US reporters left
[11:29.840 --> 11:37.120]  us saying they'd like to see Nigel Farage hit with an acid attack.
[11:37.120 --> 11:42.320]  Remember that prominent leftist journalist calls for acid attack on Nigel Farage.
[11:42.320 --> 11:46.080]  He says there needs to be acid in there.
[11:46.080 --> 11:51.920]  That was three weeks ago, anti-final vows to attack families trying to go to a fourth
[11:51.920 --> 11:55.160]  of July event in DC.
[11:55.160 --> 11:58.240]  They're trying to get somebody to shoot them.
[11:58.240 --> 11:59.240]  Doesn't matter.
[11:59.240 --> 12:00.480]  They dump acid right on your five-year-old's face.
[12:00.480 --> 12:02.000]  You pull a gun and shoot them.
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.600]  You will be the terrorist.
[12:03.600 --> 12:04.880]  You will be the bad guy.
[12:04.880 --> 12:09.800]  They are the little methods that work for the cities, that work for the universities
[12:09.800 --> 12:11.080]  and work for the federal government.
[12:11.080 --> 12:14.440]  That's why the Portland mayor allows them to do all this, because a lot of them are his
[12:14.440 --> 12:17.560]  staff, it's turned out.
[12:17.560 --> 12:21.680]  They are a domestic terror group.
[12:21.680 --> 12:24.840]  The Proud Boys never got designated a terror group, but the media lied.
[12:24.840 --> 12:28.800]  They lost all their bank accounts and everything because of another media hoax.
[12:28.800 --> 12:32.200]  Kind of like they said, I sent child porn to Sandy Hook families.
[12:32.200 --> 12:33.200]  Didn't know such thing.
[12:33.200 --> 12:35.520]  I sent 9.6 million emails.
[12:35.520 --> 12:40.840]  After I get sued, people put magic links that are hidden in emails about Sandy Hook.
[12:40.840 --> 12:45.240]  They subpoena the emails we never opened, find the hidden links.
[12:45.240 --> 12:50.840]  Same law firm that found that put a fake transcript into the court two weeks ago saying, I talked
[12:50.840 --> 12:56.200]  about white Jew boys on air, did no such thing, said white shoe boys.
[12:56.200 --> 12:58.600]  But again, I'm not saying that that law firm did that.
[12:58.600 --> 13:03.920]  I'm saying after I got sued, somebody sent us the child porn we never opened, but magically,
[13:03.920 --> 13:07.600]  they subpoenaed, found the hidden links, and you get that headline.
[13:07.600 --> 13:13.560]  This is total weaponization by the left, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:13.560 --> 13:15.960]  It's absolutely insane.
[13:15.960 --> 13:17.760]  It's totally out of control.
[13:17.760 --> 13:20.040]  You want to find the right article from last week?
[13:20.040 --> 13:22.240]  That's about a two-year-old article up there you put up.
[13:22.240 --> 13:26.080]  What you pull up is Raw Story did a retraction on the Jew boy comment and said, white shoe
[13:26.080 --> 13:27.080]  boy, and that's the one.
[13:27.080 --> 13:29.440]  Just put a rawstory.com at the end of your search.
[13:29.440 --> 13:31.040]  There it is.
[13:31.040 --> 13:37.480]  But this is the reality of how the globalists are operating.
[13:37.480 --> 13:39.920]  I'm going to say this again.
[13:39.920 --> 13:42.920]  Let this sink in.
[13:42.920 --> 13:48.800]  Antifa, the malice communist group in the United States set up 30 years ago that calls
[13:48.800 --> 13:54.600]  for overthrowing the government, killing their political enemies, banning free speech.
[13:54.600 --> 14:01.600]  They are now nationwide saying they're going to attack anybody at Fourth of July rallies,
[14:01.600 --> 14:06.400]  anybody that tries to go out in public, anybody that tries to support Trump, any type of veterans
[14:06.400 --> 14:11.400]  rallies, any type of free speech rallies that they're going to attack them with chemical
[14:11.400 --> 14:17.040]  weapons, with acid attacks, barring it from the Islamists who are their gods.
[14:17.040 --> 14:22.320]  They were so vicious and hateful in Portland outnumbering folks 10 to 1 that they beat
[14:22.320 --> 14:28.840]  up a, quote, gay man in a summer dress who they just decided to beat up.
[14:28.840 --> 14:30.880]  If you're in a wheelchair, they attack you.
[14:30.880 --> 14:36.720]  Any target weakness, ladies and gentlemen, and they were wearing brass knuckles, leaded
[14:36.720 --> 14:37.720]  gloves.
[14:37.720 --> 14:41.480]  When we come back, we'll play clips of the media praising it and defending it.
[14:41.480 --> 14:44.480]  These are the street level brown shirt.
[14:44.480 --> 14:46.320]  Terrorists.
[14:46.320 --> 14:54.920]  All of these videos are up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[14:54.920 --> 15:00.560]  We come back, we'll go through all the articles on infowars.com and newswars.com where we
[15:00.560 --> 15:07.880]  show the crowbar heads, the blood, all of it when we come back on the other side of
[15:07.880 --> 15:08.880]  this break.
[15:08.880 --> 15:14.040]  But acid attacks are taking place in America.
[15:14.040 --> 15:25.080]  They mixed hundreds of containers of the chemical weapon and they attacked men, women, and children
[15:25.080 --> 15:33.960]  with crowbars and with clubs and with improvised hatchets and the police stood there as terrorists
[15:33.960 --> 15:41.360]  and did nothing aiding the criminal left beating people in the head for no reason with clubs
[15:41.360 --> 15:48.960]  over and over and over again up to 30 stitches per giant slash.
[15:48.960 --> 15:55.240]  This is America while spraying pepper spray and dumping acid on their faces.
[15:55.240 --> 16:00.080]  This is the left terrorist.
[16:00.080 --> 16:05.880]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you

[17:28.320 --> 17:30.200]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[17:30.200 --> 17:34.120]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[17:34.120 --> 17:35.680]  I sued the IRS in one.
[17:35.680 --> 17:38.640]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[17:38.640 --> 17:41.920]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[17:41.920 --> 17:44.160]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[17:44.160 --> 17:45.480]  I can help you too.
[17:45.480 --> 17:48.480]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[17:48.480 --> 17:50.720]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[17:50.720 --> 17:58.200]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[17:58.200 --> 18:01.760]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[18:01.760 --> 18:02.760]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[18:02.760 --> 18:03.760]  Thanks for holding.
[18:03.760 --> 18:06.400]  Hey, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[18:06.400 --> 18:10.320]  I talk to a lot of people here in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that
[18:10.320 --> 18:12.520]  almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:12.520 --> 18:16.920]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[18:16.920 --> 18:21.200]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching
[18:21.200 --> 18:22.200]  2020.
[18:22.200 --> 18:23.200]  That's it.
[18:23.200 --> 18:25.280]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[18:25.280 --> 18:28.120]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:28.120 --> 18:29.400]  It's the time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.400 --> 18:32.600]  I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying
[18:32.600 --> 18:35.520]  to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.520 --> 18:38.480]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[18:38.480 --> 18:40.760]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:40.760 --> 18:43.960]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[18:43.960 --> 18:48.560]  You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[18:48.560 --> 18:49.560]  who are going to continue.
[18:49.560 --> 18:51.760]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[18:51.760 --> 18:55.840]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten
[18:55.840 --> 18:58.280]  a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[18:58.280 --> 19:01.320]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[19:01.320 --> 19:02.320]  The time has come.
[19:02.320 --> 19:03.320]  The time is here.
[19:03.320 --> 19:08.160]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American
[19:08.160 --> 19:11.880]  people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world could come here and
[19:11.880 --> 19:16.400]  get everything free, but that we, the citizens, have to pay for it when our nation is on the
[19:16.400 --> 19:17.800]  verge of bankruptcy.
[19:17.800 --> 19:22.640]  If we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status
[19:22.640 --> 19:27.800]  and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and the U.S.
[19:27.800 --> 19:32.800]  to collapse the countries, to kill capitalism and bring in socialism so we can go the way
[19:32.800 --> 19:35.200]  of the old Soviet Union, North Korea and Venezuela.
[19:35.200 --> 19:36.200]  This is a plan.
[19:36.200 --> 19:37.200]  That's why we've got to stay on air.
[19:37.200 --> 19:40.160]  That's why you've got to keep fighting because we're going to win this in the end.
[19:40.160 --> 19:44.120]  Thanks to you and your support, that's what makes it all possible, so I salute you and
[19:44.120 --> 19:48.280]  I thank you, but I ask you again, do your shopping with us and we will continue on the
[19:48.280 --> 19:49.280]  face of this.
[19:49.280 --> 19:53.920]  InfowarsStore.com, 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, whatever
[19:53.920 --> 19:57.800]  you do, commit now to history and know that buying products from us is one of the most
[19:57.800 --> 20:03.560]  important things you can do in the fight against the globalist.
[20:03.560 --> 20:10.560]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:33.560 --> 20:39.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, Antifa said they would start carrying out asset attacks and they
[20:39.480 --> 20:44.120]  mixed up hundreds and hundreds of containers of it in the park in Portland, came out and
[20:44.120 --> 20:50.160]  attacked men, women and children, split heads open with crowbars and Fox News is calling
[20:50.160 --> 20:55.400]  it milkshake attacks, chemical weapon asset attacks, and they're pledging to attack Trump's
[20:55.400 --> 21:02.440]  Fourth of July Celebrate America event coming up on July 4th in D.C.
[21:02.440 --> 21:04.240]  We're going to have reporters there.
[21:04.240 --> 21:07.520]  This is an incredible time to be alive in America.
[21:07.520 --> 21:11.000]  The left knows they're losing, so they're launching a violent revolution and the mainstream
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.760]  media is praising them and coming up we've got clips of the Democrats praising Antifa
[21:15.760 --> 21:17.320]  and what they've done.
[21:17.320 --> 21:19.360]  They're starting a violent war.
[21:19.360 --> 21:34.200]  Here is a clip of just some of what happened in Portland.
[21:34.200 --> 21:40.360]  Andy Ngo is hit, punched, pepper sprayed and has acid thrown his face, burning his eyes
[21:40.360 --> 21:46.440]  and face as they throw more quick set concrete.
[21:46.440 --> 21:51.600]  Some of the concrete is totally set, so their glass is full of concrete, others it's still
[21:51.600 --> 21:58.280]  setting with lime and acid.
[21:58.280 --> 22:04.640]  This is terrorism in America, mobs of cowards, ganging up, this is why we have the Second
[22:04.640 --> 22:09.040]  Amendment folks when they start coming to your houses which they pledge to do, like
[22:09.040 --> 22:13.320]  Tucker Carlson's and they're now doxing federal agents and board patrols saying they're going
[22:13.320 --> 22:16.960]  to come to your houses and kill them, they're going to find out that the acid won't beat
[22:16.960 --> 22:21.880]  bullets when we defend ourselves.
[22:21.880 --> 22:28.080]  But in any leftist system, the arch crime is defending yourself against leftist thugs.
[22:28.080 --> 22:30.520]  We have stacks of articles with that.
[22:30.520 --> 22:36.720]  Here they are beating men who are peaceful from behind with metal bars splitting their
[22:36.720 --> 22:37.720]  heads open.
[22:37.720 --> 22:45.960]  We can show some of the photos here of people literally covered in blood.
[22:45.960 --> 22:48.120]  This is the reality.
[22:48.120 --> 22:49.400]  This is what is unfolding.
[22:49.400 --> 22:57.600]  This is terrorism, leftist organized, defended terrorism in America.
[22:57.600 --> 23:02.800]  Joe Biden came out and praised Antifa's wonderful people during the debates and we've got a
[23:02.800 --> 23:08.520]  compilation of some of the other leftist praising the domestic terror group where the
[23:08.520 --> 23:13.000]  police just stand there while men, women and children are beating the head with metal bars
[23:13.000 --> 23:19.480]  up to 30 stitches and acid attacks, a chemical weapon attack.
[23:19.480 --> 23:20.840]  No one else is breaking this down.
[23:20.840 --> 23:25.280]  No one else is even getting what's happening because the left defines things.
[23:25.280 --> 23:27.480]  There aren't two genders.
[23:27.480 --> 23:29.880]  They're not terrorists when they attack you.
[23:29.880 --> 23:34.280]  And quick set concrete throw in your face to put your eyes out and eat your skin off.
[23:34.280 --> 23:38.400]  That's milk because they are God.
[23:38.400 --> 23:41.560]  And even babies after they're born should be killed now because the left shed, they're
[23:41.560 --> 23:42.760]  not human.
[23:42.760 --> 23:44.560]  Kill those little creatures.
[23:44.560 --> 23:45.800]  Ha, ha, ha.
[23:45.800 --> 23:54.320]  And there's the photos of them mixing it all, handing out hundreds and hundreds of acid
[23:54.320 --> 24:01.440]  bombs so they could come out and just split people's heads wide open.
[24:01.440 --> 24:04.720]  You know, more folks are going to show up now to Portland and D.C.
[24:04.720 --> 24:06.640]  This won't intimidate Americans.
[24:06.640 --> 24:11.080]  And I predict that mayor is going to end up getting arrested for protecting them.
[24:11.080 --> 24:16.120]  I predict that you're going to have serious stuff go down in that meth head demon infested
[24:16.120 --> 24:17.560]  area known as Portland, Oregon.
[24:17.560 --> 24:19.080]  And these folks will be identified.
[24:19.080 --> 24:21.280]  They will be going to prison.
[24:21.280 --> 24:22.280]  Unbelievable.
[24:22.280 --> 24:25.080]  This is when the scum comes out of their rat holes.
[24:25.080 --> 24:30.880]  By the way, the man that got particularly beaten badly, Adam Kelly, his head split open,
[24:30.880 --> 24:31.880]  many others did.
[24:31.880 --> 24:38.040]  He was helping a, quote, gay man in a summer dress who the Antifa just attacked because
[24:38.040 --> 24:39.040]  they thought they were weak.
[24:39.040 --> 24:42.000]  Antifa even attacks their own people.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  Like when Pelosi was forced to say they were basically terrorists a year ago because they
[24:45.000 --> 24:50.600]  were just attacking their own people at a Democrat rally event, countering a Christian
[24:50.600 --> 24:51.880]  prayer vigil.
[24:51.880 --> 24:56.840]  They're a bunch of scum who are cowards, who've never had any power, who were bullies.
[24:56.840 --> 25:00.880]  So they go out and get together and they go into feeding frenzies, beating innocent
[25:00.880 --> 25:01.880]  people.
[25:01.880 --> 25:05.320]  Here is the enemy of the American people, the globalist corporate media on the Chai
[25:05.320 --> 25:09.880]  Com payroll, celebrating their brown shirt shot tricks.
[25:09.880 --> 25:15.280]  I argue to you tonight, all punches are not equal morally.
[25:15.280 --> 25:17.960]  In the eyes of the law, yes.
[25:17.960 --> 25:20.960]  But in the eyes of good and evil, here's the argument.
[25:20.960 --> 25:26.000]  They are strictly principled anti-fascists and what they see in the Trump administration
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.920]  and what they see happening in this country, they see the neo-fascism that we see.
[25:31.920 --> 25:36.360]  And they've taken a principle stand to stand against white supremacists and white nationalists
[25:36.360 --> 25:37.840]  wherever they may show up.
[25:37.840 --> 25:43.160]  It says it right in the name, Antifa, anti-fascism, which is what they were there fighting.
[25:43.160 --> 25:46.880]  Listen, there's, you know, no organization is perfect, there are some violence.
[25:46.880 --> 25:51.240]  I think that a lot of people recognize that when pushed, self-defense is a legitimate
[25:51.240 --> 25:54.120]  response to white supremacist and neo-nazi violence.
[25:54.120 --> 26:00.080]  The problem is to equate the violence in reaction against bigotry with the bigotry itself is
[26:00.080 --> 26:05.040]  to misunderstand the fact that when you go to cancer treatment, the radiation is tough
[26:05.040 --> 26:08.760]  treatment, but it is meant to remove the cancer.
[26:08.760 --> 26:12.840]  There's a group of anti-fascists called the Black Bloc, which do tend to get violent.
[26:12.840 --> 26:17.760]  Their idea is, look, non-violence hasn't worked and we are going to try to stop this.
[26:17.760 --> 26:21.920]  But they wouldn't have been there, they wouldn't have been anywhere near there had it not been
[26:21.920 --> 26:26.920]  for the fact that white supremacists, neo-nazis, were out scaring the living daylout out of
[26:26.920 --> 26:29.080]  most of the people in that town.
[26:29.080 --> 26:32.760]  Spuggishness is spuggishness wherever it comes from politically and we should be the first
[26:32.760 --> 26:33.760]  to call it out.
[26:33.760 --> 26:34.760]  I did.
[26:34.760 --> 26:36.440]  Wow, somebody said no to it.
[26:36.440 --> 26:43.000]  Nobody knows Asian got beat over the head and had acid thrown on him and his eyes are all
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.920]  red and bloody and his face is all half eaten off, but that's okay to have a quick concrete
[26:48.920 --> 26:56.520]  thrown in your hair and your face because, again, the media said we're Nazis.
[26:56.520 --> 27:04.240]  What did Congressman Crenshaw say last week in Congress?
[27:04.240 --> 27:09.680]  The veteran in Congress, when he pointed out to Big Tech when we come back, that calling
[27:09.680 --> 27:13.680]  everyone Nazis when this country invaded a continent and millions of people were killed
[27:13.680 --> 27:17.720]  to take out the Nazis is inciting violence.
[27:17.720 --> 27:23.040]  And that's exactly what they've done, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:23.040 --> 27:30.240]  So they're out there involved in chemical weapons attacks, violent attempted murder with
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.200]  steel clubs thrown full power.
[27:35.200 --> 27:37.480]  They basically had foil swords if you really look.
[27:37.480 --> 27:44.640]  They had big, long batons that you can kill people with if you hit them in the neck.
[27:44.640 --> 27:48.680]  And this is what it's come down to because a bunch of white methods that work for the
[27:48.680 --> 27:55.720]  mayor said that an Asian guy who's just a journalist, oh, let's beat him up because
[27:55.720 --> 27:58.840]  we're a bunch of trash.
[27:58.840 --> 28:01.960]  What do you do, ladies and gentlemen, let this sink in that the corporate media is going
[28:01.960 --> 28:02.960]  to cover this up.
[28:02.960 --> 28:03.960]  They're going to defend it.
[28:03.960 --> 28:06.200]  You just saw them defend the violence.
[28:06.200 --> 28:11.800]  You just saw the left and the corporate media defend the radiation treatment you're about
[28:11.800 --> 28:13.880]  to get to teach you to submit.
[28:13.880 --> 28:17.600]  They've been breeding this in the colleges and the foundations and now they're making
[28:17.600 --> 28:18.600]  their move.
[28:18.600 --> 28:19.600]  Hillary was supposed to get in.
[28:19.600 --> 28:23.080]  They were supposed to roll all this out against us with her as president.
[28:23.080 --> 28:25.240]  But now they're doing it even though she's not in.
[28:25.240 --> 28:28.160]  So we don't have full control of the government back, folks.
[28:28.160 --> 28:32.600]  They're fighting to maintain their control and getting violent to teach us.
[28:32.600 --> 28:33.920]  Don't eat at leftist restaurants.
[28:33.920 --> 28:35.000]  Don't shop with them.
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.120]  We must separate ourselves economically in boycott Hollywood, the globalist, all their
[28:39.120 --> 28:41.800]  trash and don't visit their cities.
[28:41.800 --> 28:45.240]  Let them be in the rats and feces and heroin needles.
[28:45.240 --> 28:51.800]  Just they are absolute baby killing trash, demonic filth from the pit of hell and fight
[28:51.800 --> 28:52.800]  back.
[28:52.800 --> 28:53.800]  They want to silence you.
[28:53.800 --> 28:54.800]  They want to bully you.
[28:54.800 --> 28:59.360]  They want to stop you from spreading the word about M4Wars.com and NewsWars.com.

[30:16.160 --> 30:20.200]  much it means to me that when you saw all those lies against us last week, the worst
[30:20.200 --> 30:23.520]  things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up
[30:23.520 --> 30:24.600]  and found out the truth.
[30:24.600 --> 30:29.120]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in
[30:29.120 --> 30:30.120]  my heart.
[30:30.120 --> 30:33.000]  I want you to know that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for all you've
[30:33.000 --> 30:37.000]  done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support because I'm committed
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.880]  to fight to the end but I want to win and without you I'm going to be destroyed and
[30:41.880 --> 30:44.440]  it's not going to be fun but that's not what's important.
[30:44.440 --> 30:45.720]  The enemy could win.
[30:45.720 --> 30:47.840]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[30:47.840 --> 30:49.080]  We're being used by God.
[30:49.080 --> 30:50.080]  You're being used by God.
[30:50.080 --> 30:54.120]  This is Providence, so I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom
[30:54.120 --> 30:55.120]  of my heart.
[30:55.120 --> 31:00.960]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[31:00.960 --> 31:05.240]  There is no longer any doubt multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted
[31:05.240 --> 31:08.160]  violent, Maoist style overthrow of the U.S.
[31:08.160 --> 31:12.440]  Our borders are being totally collapsed, already born babies are being killed, world government
[31:12.440 --> 31:13.440]  is here.
[31:13.440 --> 31:14.440]  Now is the time for decision.
[31:14.440 --> 31:17.280]  Now is the time for everyone watching and listening to decide which side they're on.
[31:17.280 --> 31:20.480]  And if you decide that you want to stop the forces that are banning the American flag
[31:20.480 --> 31:24.240]  and attacking the family and that are attacking our borders and our country and our military
[31:24.240 --> 31:25.240]  and our heritage.
[31:25.240 --> 31:28.320]  If you want to defend that, then now is the time to take action and that means word of
[31:28.320 --> 31:32.800]  mouth about this broadcast and that means buying products at InfowarsStore.com and that
[31:32.800 --> 31:36.520]  means praying for Infowars and praying for President Trump and praying for yourself and
[31:36.520 --> 31:38.760]  praying for peace, praying for justice.

[34:58.680 --> 35:03.080]  well. Antifa made good. They started saying two weeks ago they're going to attack the
[35:03.080 --> 35:07.560]  4th of July event that Trump has celebrating America. We're going to have journalists covering.
[35:08.600 --> 35:12.920]  There's one of the headlines news wars.com left us advocate acid attacks against Nigel Farage.
[35:14.520 --> 35:21.240]  Unbelievable. Ladies and gentlemen, that was just May 21st. So Antifa picked up on that.
[35:21.800 --> 35:28.520]  Corporate media praises the attacks and now it's here. Now it's unfolding. Ted Cruz is calling
[35:28.520 --> 35:35.000]  for an FBI investigation. FBI investigation. Ladies and gentlemen, if I went and had a demonstration
[35:35.000 --> 35:41.080]  at a park and loaded quick set concrete into hundreds of paper cups to go tell people talk
[35:41.080 --> 35:45.080]  about mind control. Oh, it's milkshakes, but really it's acid. They brag we're going to put
[35:45.080 --> 35:53.160]  people's eyes out. They can put your eyes out. And then they go and throw it on people's faces,
[35:53.160 --> 35:58.120]  eating their skin off, burning their eyes, mashing people and hitting them in the head
[35:58.120 --> 36:04.200]  with metal clubs, splitting their heads open, giant split open heads, blood pouring everywhere
[36:04.200 --> 36:10.280]  of peaceful people and CNN goes, Oh, there was a fight in Portland when liberals attacked Nazis.
[36:12.280 --> 36:17.160]  It's like the Congressman said Crenshaw last week, naming everybody that's your opposition.
[36:17.160 --> 36:22.360]  Nazis is a form of terrorism. And then they tell all these city workers. That's mainly what it is.
[36:22.360 --> 36:26.760]  Method city workers to go attack peaceful people that dare exercise their First Amendment.
[36:26.760 --> 36:31.080]  I am so blown away. Ted Cruz calls for FBI to investigate and bring legal action against
[36:31.080 --> 36:36.600]  Portland mayor. Ted Cruz calls for legal action against Portland mayor. Democratic terrorist
[36:36.600 --> 36:42.760]  could target for this July holiday events, ABC news, but no known plots say the feds.
[36:44.120 --> 36:47.960]  Incredible domestic terrorists could target it. And of course, we know who those are no known
[36:47.960 --> 36:53.720]  plots. You just saw terrorists mixing up hundreds of cups of a chemical weapon.
[36:54.440 --> 37:00.440]  Quickset concrete has four different types of acid in it. It makes concrete fused together.
[37:01.240 --> 37:04.600]  It'll eat your eyeballs out. Ask anybody. Read the damn package.
[37:05.960 --> 37:09.560]  New video shows Antifa crowbar attack. Macing of elderly man.
[37:10.520 --> 37:16.120]  Paul Joseph Watson info wars.com news wars.com. We're going to go to Paul Watson right now.
[37:16.120 --> 37:21.880]  Paul, please remember this is why we need your support. America is going in
[37:22.520 --> 37:30.920]  the most insane times in 1776. The world is going into the most insane time we've seen.
[37:30.920 --> 37:36.760]  There's a major global realignment against tyranny and all the world from Brazil to England to the
[37:36.760 --> 37:43.400]  United States to Germany to Sweden to to Russia. They have Soros funded his sons,
[37:43.400 --> 37:50.680]  the main controller of it, funded Antifa, physically attacking people as modern brown shirts. You
[37:50.680 --> 37:57.960]  cannot make the magnitude of this up. And info wars is the vanguard of fighting it and standing
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.840]  against it with our intrepid reporters that go into this. Millie Weaver, Caitlin Bennett, Owen
[38:02.840 --> 38:07.400]  Shroyer, they met a shroyer with guns threatened to killing just last year in Austin. The police
[38:07.400 --> 38:12.040]  did nothing because we're a blue city. The police are aiding and abetting this. This is America.
[38:12.040 --> 38:17.400]  They're not going to let Trump win. They're censoring. They're preparing terror attacks.
[38:17.400 --> 38:20.680]  And if Trump doesn't move against them, doesn't matter how popular he is,
[38:20.680 --> 38:24.760]  they will sweep him from office and bring in a reign of terror. Then you'll have a civil war and
[38:24.760 --> 38:28.840]  the Second Amendment in defensive terms will come out. Remember when I got banned off Twitter last
[38:28.840 --> 38:34.280]  year? They said that I said kill journalists with guns. Never said it. I never showed you video.
[38:34.280 --> 38:38.520]  I said Antifa says they're coming to people's houses to kill them. Members of law enforcement,
[38:38.520 --> 38:45.080]  they're doxing you in Congress. You have a right to defend yourself. So be there and
[38:45.080 --> 38:49.320]  understand have your battle rivals ready. Well, now they're doxing federal law enforcement everywhere
[38:49.320 --> 38:54.440]  and say they're coming to your house to kill you. And now they're mixing up concrete with acid
[38:54.440 --> 38:58.040]  and throwing it in people's faces and beating them over the head with clubs.
[39:01.480 --> 39:05.720]  They're about to make their move. Paul Joseph Watson of summit dot news and info wars dot
[39:05.720 --> 39:09.640]  com. You have been at the epicenter. I asked you to come on last week. You were too busy
[39:09.640 --> 39:14.520]  about the threats of acid attacks against Briggs. And now it's happening in America.
[39:14.520 --> 39:19.160]  And they say coming up July 4th, they're going to hit everybody at July 4th in DC.
[39:19.160 --> 39:24.920]  My God, imagine terrorists are going to mix up acid and attack conservatives all over the world
[39:24.920 --> 39:27.800]  and our own governments aren't going to do a damn thing, Paul.
[39:30.360 --> 39:33.880]  Well, there's one congressman that's come out about an hour ago, Alex,
[39:33.880 --> 39:37.960]  and it's upon him for what's congressman calls for Antifa to be labeled a domestic terror
[39:37.960 --> 39:45.080]  organization. This was already happening back at the start of 2016. You had New Jersey Homeland
[39:45.080 --> 39:51.800]  Security Homeland Security in general, telling local and state authorities that Antifa was
[39:51.800 --> 39:58.760]  involved in quote domestic terror activities. So you already had that going back to early 2016.
[39:58.760 --> 40:04.680]  They're still getting away with it. They're now literally threatening acid attacks on a free speech
[40:04.680 --> 40:11.480]  rally next weekend. And the question is, why are they allowed to wear masks, Alex? Police have
[40:11.480 --> 40:18.600]  confiscated weapons from Antifa domestic terrorists before these masks are only being worn for one
[40:18.600 --> 40:25.640]  reason so they can get away with committing violent crime. Okay, so if they come into a protest area
[40:25.640 --> 40:30.600]  with an object which is going to be used in the process of committing a violent crime,
[40:30.600 --> 40:36.520]  why is that not being taken away from them? Ban the masks and then it's buy by Antifa because
[40:36.520 --> 40:42.920]  they can no longer hide their identities. But finally, we've got a congressman not just saying
[40:42.920 --> 40:48.440]  it needs to be investigated. He said outright declare them a domestic terrorist organization.
[40:48.440 --> 40:53.000]  They're a vowel of violence and routine intimidation, harassment and assault of Americans
[40:53.000 --> 41:00.120]  as no place in our country. So again, will we see any action or will we see potentially
[41:00.120 --> 41:05.880]  acid attacks on mass against Americans standing up for their free speech rights this weekend in
[41:05.880 --> 41:13.080]  Washington DC? Paul, they are organizing. They are serious. They are protected as you wrote
[41:13.080 --> 41:17.400]  at info wars.com today. This is all got to go viral folks. You've got to be the Paul Revere's.
[41:17.400 --> 41:24.520]  Fox is barely covering the CNN is praising Antifa as of going live today. If these articles don't
[41:24.520 --> 41:28.280]  get out, people don't even know that concrete was used and they don't even know that it was
[41:28.280 --> 41:33.720]  quick set that's acid. They don't even know about the heads being split open. This is a massive
[41:33.720 --> 41:39.800]  cover up and Antifa is flexing and testing and the police just stood there while all this happened.
[41:41.640 --> 41:46.120]  Yeah, and it's all being organized on Facebook and Twitter. I'm banned on Facebook,
[41:46.120 --> 41:51.080]  you're banned on Facebook, you're banned on Twitter. We know the group behind it, Alex is called
[41:51.080 --> 41:57.880]  Rose City and Tifa. They've literally got a post on Facebook right now celebrating the quote amazing
[41:57.880 --> 42:05.560]  success of their people smashing in old men's heads with crowbars, amazing them in the face.
[42:05.560 --> 42:11.400]  They're on Twitter, not being banned, not being suspended on Twitter. They're raising money
[42:11.400 --> 42:17.480]  from a website called rally.org. People need to contact this website called rally.org and ask
[42:17.480 --> 42:22.920]  them do you support domestic terrorism because your platform is being used to raise money
[42:22.920 --> 42:28.600]  for domestic terrorists. They've got a website who hosts their website on this website.
[42:29.320 --> 42:35.880]  They openly docks people. They list their direct address. They talk about Haley Adams who was
[42:35.880 --> 42:41.880]  attacked at one of these events last year but violently attacked again. They list her exact
[42:41.880 --> 42:47.080]  apartment, her exact address on their website. Who's hosting this website? Why are people who
[42:47.080 --> 42:53.160]  are doxing people who have been proven to commit violent crimes? You could call that attempted
[42:53.160 --> 42:58.040]  crowbar, you could call the crowbar attack attempted murder. They're allowed on Twitter, Alex.
[42:59.160 --> 43:03.960]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products

[43:53.000 --> 44:03.560]  Well, we're very, very clear with everybody about all of this. We're going into the season of war
[44:03.560 --> 44:07.000]  and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have
[44:07.000 --> 44:11.960]  through their criminal activity and their digital fraud. And we need to know that we've got capital
[44:11.960 --> 44:16.520]  to go six months a year. We need to end here. We need to be provisioned. And you've got my
[44:16.520 --> 44:20.520]  total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly. I'm
[44:20.520 --> 44:24.920]  loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin. I'm bloody and then
[44:24.920 --> 44:29.560]  I'm up politically. I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[44:29.560 --> 44:33.800]  That just brings more people here. So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war
[44:33.800 --> 44:39.320]  bonds. I need gas. I need ammo politically now. But literally, if you flood us with money and if
[44:39.320 --> 44:43.320]  you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable,
[44:43.320 --> 44:46.440]  we're unstoppable together. I want to send a strong message to the enemy. I want to raise a
[44:46.440 --> 44:50.760]  couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you

[45:55.000 --> 45:59.720]  that's what funds the info war and the big sales running right now, infowarstore.com.
[46:01.080 --> 46:06.760]  The time has come. The time is here. The globalists are openly activating their anti-american forces
[46:06.760 --> 46:11.080]  to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders and that the whole world could
[46:11.080 --> 46:15.960]  come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it. When our nation
[46:15.960 --> 46:21.160]  is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse
[46:21.160 --> 46:26.760]  into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe
[46:26.760 --> 46:32.440]  and the US to collapse the countries, to kill capitalism and bring in socialism so we can go
[46:32.440 --> 46:36.600]  the way of the old Soviet Union, North Korea and Venezuela. This is a plan. That's why we've got to
[46:36.600 --> 46:40.040]  stay on air, it's why you've got to keep fighting because we're going to win this in the end. Thanks
[46:40.040 --> 46:44.440]  to you and your support, that's what makes it all possible. So I salute you and I thank you,
[46:44.440 --> 46:48.920]  but I ask you again, do your shopping with us and we will continue on in the face of this.
[46:48.920 --> 46:54.200]  Infowarstore.com, 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double patriot points, whatever you do,
[46:54.200 --> 46:58.120]  commit now to history and know that buying products from us is one of the most important
[46:58.120 --> 47:14.040]  things you can do in the fight against the globalist. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:14.040 --> 47:31.320]  Welcome back. I'm your host Alex Jones. All watches with us for two more segments.
[47:32.200 --> 47:38.120]  We'll be hosting the second hour, fourth hour tomorrow. The second hour today,
[47:38.120 --> 47:42.040]  Stuart Rhodes of Oathkeepers, founder of Oathkeepers is going to be joining us
[47:42.040 --> 47:46.440]  and then we have Sof coming on the broadcast as well. We're talking about all the censorship
[47:46.440 --> 47:52.120]  that's been going on and Gerald Salente and I think Robert Barnes is going to be popping in
[47:52.120 --> 47:59.640]  the last 30 minutes with some information as well. I'm pretty upset right now because see,
[47:59.640 --> 48:05.160]  I'm not adapting to being enslaved. I'm not adapting to how they use Islamist, the left
[48:05.160 --> 48:09.560]  does, as their enforcers all over Europe and how they use anti-fun Europe in the U.S. as their
[48:09.560 --> 48:14.840]  vicious enforcers in every blue, cesspit, city or area around beating people up under police
[48:14.840 --> 48:22.840]  protection. I'm adapting and overcoming. I'm upset that my reporters are going to be up there in DC
[48:23.400 --> 48:27.000]  covering this where terrorists are saying they're going to throw acid on people
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.160]  and beat them up with metal bars for no reason, for exercising them the fourth of July,
[48:31.160 --> 48:34.280]  and our corporate media is defending it and saying they're heroes.
[48:34.280 --> 48:41.720]  I'm upset that Trump isn't doing anything about this. I'm upset that Trump gives lip service
[48:41.720 --> 48:45.880]  about his going to fight censorship. We all get excited and he's going to have a summit coming
[48:45.880 --> 48:53.400]  up on July 11th. Well, guess what? If I go to that summit, I'll be outside bullhorning it to get
[48:53.400 --> 48:57.640]  media attention that we don't have action. I don't care about having my being padded on the head
[48:57.640 --> 49:04.200]  inside. Just like press passes don't do anything in some rotting press office where Obama's picture
[49:04.200 --> 49:11.320]  still hangs up at the White House in the press room. The left is making the revolutionary
[49:11.320 --> 49:18.920]  terrorist move. They've now ratcheted up to organized people handing out concrete acid chemical
[49:18.920 --> 49:25.080]  weapon milkshakes. And congressman calls for Antifa to be labeled a domestic terror organization.
[49:25.080 --> 49:29.960]  Republican Congressman Jim Banks has called for Antifa to be labeled a domestic terror organization
[49:29.960 --> 49:36.120]  following the violence in Portland. The violence. You mean the left viciously attacking anybody
[49:36.120 --> 49:41.480]  and everybody. Get that article out, infowars.com, newswars.com. Send out to everybody you know.
[49:41.480 --> 49:45.720]  We're going to go back to Paul Watson right now. I was just during the break meeting with
[49:45.720 --> 49:51.000]  the warehouse folks. Our products are made in America, distributed in America. You name it.
[49:51.000 --> 49:57.400]  And they said, listen, boss, your 50% off sale has been so good, but you only mark stuff up 150%.
[49:57.400 --> 50:04.120]  Well, something 50% off, we're only making 20, 30%. If that you're selling out of X2, you're selling
[50:04.120 --> 50:07.400]  on a brain force, you're already selling on a turbo force, you're selling out of bodies,
[50:07.400 --> 50:11.400]  you're selling out of a whole bunch of stuff, you're going to have to end this sale at least
[50:11.400 --> 50:17.160]  on a bunch of products. So the 50% off store wide free shipping and double patriot points
[50:19.560 --> 50:26.040]  will end on July 5th because a bunch of stuff is about to sell out. It will end. Now we'll
[50:26.040 --> 50:29.400]  still have some stuff that's on sale because I've habituated everybody and always wanting
[50:29.400 --> 50:34.040]  50% off. And that's great. We just have to sell a lot of it to be able to operate because there's
[50:34.040 --> 50:39.400]  not a lot of profit. We've only got about 100 left of the clown world ultra limited edition
[50:39.400 --> 50:45.560]  clown world t-shirts. That's at infowarstore.com. We have the great new limited edition space shuttle
[50:45.560 --> 50:51.080]  space force shirt that's so popular and a lot of others. But whatever you do, think about how
[50:51.080 --> 50:56.200]  free speech is under attack and how critical info wars is to be the loud focused voice pointing
[50:56.200 --> 51:02.680]  out this is a chemical acid attack. Not seeing that on Fox or CNN. That's the truth. That's
[51:02.680 --> 51:07.640]  how crazy it's gotten. So read the thousands of five star reviews. Everything is 50% off
[51:07.640 --> 51:12.440]  at infowarslife.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, triple eight,
[51:12.440 --> 51:16.760]  two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, a lot of other big specials as well. Triple eight,
[51:16.760 --> 51:20.680]  two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. All right, Paul Watson, we've got the floor of the next 10
[51:20.680 --> 51:27.560]  minutes. Get into what you predicts coming next DC, the lack of action on this terror group,
[51:27.560 --> 51:32.040]  the mixing of the chemical weapon in front of everybody, the police standing down.
[51:32.040 --> 51:36.840]  This shows they're really going to go the whole way coming into 2020.
[51:38.760 --> 51:46.040]  Well, people forget that Antifa members were actually arrested back in February 2017 for
[51:46.040 --> 51:50.360]  planning an acid attack on Trump supporters. Whether Trump administration is actually going
[51:50.360 --> 51:55.640]  to do anything about literal terrorists trying to target his supporters remains to be seen,
[51:55.640 --> 52:02.360]  but there's a headline from 2017. Third arrest made in connection to planned deplorable acid attack.
[52:03.240 --> 52:08.600]  And it was a plan that involved quote, setting off butric acid bombs into the ventilation
[52:08.600 --> 52:14.840]  systems of the National Press Club, who was hosting this event. The activist allegedly planned
[52:14.840 --> 52:19.640]  the attack with members of the DC anti-fascist coalition. And again, these are some of the
[52:19.640 --> 52:25.560]  same groups that have terrorized Tucker Carlson's family there in DC at his home. Court documents
[52:25.560 --> 52:31.160]  claimed the plan was to deploy butric acid near the air ducts and or deploy bottles of butric
[52:31.160 --> 52:36.280]  acid on the floor in order to cause the ball attendees to evacuate the building as a result of
[52:36.280 --> 52:42.040]  the smell. So that was a plan. People were arrested for it. And then we have a new plan
[52:42.040 --> 52:47.720]  today, which is up on infowars.com and Tifa member threats to acid attack attendees of
[52:47.720 --> 52:54.360]  DC free speech event. And they got the telegram messages of whoever this individual is, who
[52:54.360 --> 53:03.080]  should be the subject of a FBI or DHS investigation right now. And he's using the pseudonym and he's
[53:03.080 --> 53:09.320]  using the artwork of this journalist who works for Rolling Stone magazine and Playboy magazine.
[53:09.320 --> 53:14.680]  The individual who is the journalist claims that it's not him, even though he's written pro and
[53:14.680 --> 53:21.320]  Tifa articles in the past, and the guy sending the messages is obviously pro and Tifa and using
[53:21.320 --> 53:27.320]  his symbology, but he claims it's not him. And he's literally in this telegram group chat saying,
[53:28.040 --> 53:34.120]  you can't fight if you can't see. These are his words. Quo, I just want to toss as many blooms
[53:34.120 --> 53:41.720]  of of muriatic acid in the faces of many as of many proud boys as I can. I want to blind as many
[53:41.720 --> 53:49.400]  of you bleep suckers as possible, a nice balloon filled with muriatic acid covered in wax. And
[53:49.400 --> 53:56.520]  the reason they want to cover it in wax as big big league politics explains, muriatic acid can
[53:56.520 --> 54:01.640]  be purchased in virtually any pool store or home improvement store. It's dangerous on its own.
[54:01.640 --> 54:06.760]  You can wash it off with water, but by combining it with the ax, it will immediately with a wax,
[54:06.760 --> 54:12.440]  sorry, it will immediately form a film similar to candle wax on the injured injured person's skin.
[54:12.440 --> 54:18.200]  So then that's a way of getting it into the bloodstream of the intended victim. They're literally
[54:18.200 --> 54:23.320]  talking about this in these telegram chat. It's like napalm napalm is meant to stick to your body.
[54:23.320 --> 54:26.440]  So this is an acid that sticks to your body. It's very hard to get off.
[54:26.440 --> 54:31.960]  Yeah. And they've been they plan to do that in the past. They're planning to do it again.
[54:31.960 --> 54:36.920]  Apparently, DHS and FBI are now going to provide some kind of security or they're going to have
[54:36.920 --> 54:43.640]  a presence at this DC free speech rally on the six. So it remains to be seen if they actually do
[54:43.640 --> 54:48.680]  anything. Again, why not confiscate the masks, ban the masks, then they can't turn up because
[54:48.680 --> 54:54.440]  they're wearing the masks because they're committing violent crimes, trying to hide their identities.
[54:54.440 --> 54:58.360]  Think about the magnitude of this, that they're doing this, that it's organized,
[54:58.360 --> 55:03.720]  they're making acid attack stuff in the park in front of the police. This just shows the blue
[55:03.720 --> 55:08.760]  cities are saying they represent illegal aliens now that we show borders. Beto O'Rourke is campaigning
[55:08.760 --> 55:13.720]  in Mexico. Major journalists are calling for acid attacks on Nigel Farage. I mean,
[55:13.720 --> 55:19.960]  they've just gone stark raving lunatic mad. No, precisely, and we predicted it all along.
[55:19.960 --> 55:24.840]  The media made a big joke about the milkshake attacks. Oh, it's just a milkshake snowflakes,
[55:24.840 --> 55:29.320]  what you're worried about. Bear in mind, these are the same people who are literally terrified
[55:29.320 --> 55:33.800]  of words and encountering ideas which they disagree with. Oh, but where the snowflakes,
[55:33.800 --> 55:38.120]  because we don't like being doused with milkshakes. Now the milkshakes have got acid in them.
[55:38.120 --> 55:45.560]  They've got quick drain cement in them. You had big left-wing comics on BBC radio shows a few weeks
[55:45.560 --> 55:52.440]  ago, joking about throwing acid on Nigel Farage and other people like that. And to segue Alex,
[55:53.400 --> 56:00.360]  meanwhile in the UK, they're literally treating the guy who bravely fought off the terrorist
[56:00.360 --> 56:05.720]  during the London Bridge attack where dozens of people were slashed, eight people killed.
[56:06.280 --> 56:11.560]  Now the guy who literally fought off the terrorist and said, by the way, revealed that
[56:11.560 --> 56:16.840]  during the attack, the jihadists were saying, quote, this is for Allah, Islam, Islam, Islam.
[56:16.840 --> 56:20.440]  That's what the terrorists said, according to this victim who was there on the scene.
[56:20.440 --> 56:25.240]  He was literally being slashed in the neck in the head, biting them off.
[56:25.240 --> 56:30.200]  Let's be clear, they killed eight people, stabbed 30. He charged them and basically said that,
[56:30.200 --> 56:34.520]  you know, I'm British, I'm not going to back down. They stabbed him all over his body.
[56:34.520 --> 56:38.040]  He's a hero. And now he has to go to a reeducation center. Tell them about it.
[56:38.040 --> 56:44.040]  Yeah, he's been put in the UK government. He's been put on the terror watch list.
[56:44.040 --> 56:51.000]  Okay, he's been forced to attend de-radicalization classes because some anti-Islam activists in
[56:51.000 --> 56:58.040]  the UK contacted him. So now he's a suspected potential terrorist simply because they contacted
[56:58.040 --> 57:02.040]  him. He should have been given a medal. They should have given him the George Cross,
[57:02.040 --> 57:07.320]  which is the highest civilian award that you can get, literally fighting off jihadists
[57:07.320 --> 57:11.560]  as they mowed down people in vans and stabbed people in the neck.
[57:11.560 --> 57:15.720]  This guy is now on a terror watch list. This is the situation we're at.
[57:15.720 --> 57:20.840]  Meanwhile, the British army says that if you describe yourself as a patriot, that's a sign of
[57:20.840 --> 57:26.600]  dangerous right-wing extremism. This is the clown world that we live in, in the UK right now.
[57:26.600 --> 57:29.240]  That's right. Let's talk about when we come back. The British government,
[57:29.240 --> 57:33.640]  what a month ago, put out flyers saying, look out for people that like the UK,
[57:33.640 --> 57:39.320]  that want to be in Brexit and that like to be British or Scottish or Irish.
[57:39.320 --> 57:44.680]  That's bad. The army's watching you. You, if the Muslim wants to stab you,
[57:44.680 --> 57:46.920]  you spet your neck up, you say, right here, sir.
[57:50.040 --> 57:54.040]  I just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against
[57:54.040 --> 57:58.920]  this. And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars, 50% off. But we make
[57:58.920 --> 58:04.280]  only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff. We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price.
[58:04.280 --> 58:08.680]  And we're moving a ton of it. Okay. But you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and
[58:08.680 --> 58:12.520]  you get $20,000 that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers,
[58:12.520 --> 58:16.040]  the crew. So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product.
[58:16.040 --> 58:20.120]  I want to expand, not contract. And for six months, we've not just made a standstill.
[58:20.120 --> 58:24.680]  The enemy's been winning. And I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[58:24.680 --> 58:27.960]  I like to be expanding. I like to be winning. I like to be fighting. And we are winning the
[58:27.960 --> 58:32.280]  info war. That's why we're so hated. But we need to be retreaded. We need to be tuned up. We need
[58:32.280 --> 58:36.280]  to be fixed up. We never have time to get in the drive up. We got a lot of holes shot at us. And
[58:36.280 --> 58:41.240]  the enemy wants to silence us. Then they're really going to plant child porn on us. Then they're
[58:41.240 --> 58:45.320]  going to kill me or you or anybody else. I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary
[58:45.320 --> 58:48.920]  fervor funded by foreign banks and the chai comms. So go to infowarstore.com.
[58:50.920 --> 58:55.160]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget this is the maximum alert. We wouldn't be here without you.

[59:53.160 --> 01:00:16.440]  listening to the Alex Jones show. All right, Stuart Rhodes is coming up in about 10 minutes
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:20.440]  founder of the oath keepers to give us this expert take on this. But Paul, you were saying during
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:25.640]  the break that this even shocks you that organized acid attacks mainstream media calling for acid
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:32.120]  attacks in the US in the UK against public officials doxing of law enforcement homes,
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:38.040]  saying they're coming to kill them publicly mixing up acid attack milkshakes in the park
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:43.240]  beating people's heads in burning their skin off. And they're just getting started in CNN says
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:50.840]  great job. Keep it up. Well, the thing that shocked me the most this morning was this had
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:57.080]  they've literally took the hero of the London Bridge terror attacks, the guy that valiantly
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:03.400]  fought off the terrorists. He's called the Lion of London Bridge. This stems back back to the fact
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:09.480]  that he screamed f you I'm mill wall to the terrorists as two of them were simultaneously
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:15.320]  literally stabbing him in the neck. Millwall is a football team in London, who are noted for
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:20.760]  liking to get in fights. Let's just put it that way. But this guy was rightly lionized and
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:28.440]  celebrated after the attack. He was in hospital with 80 stitches to his head, ear, arms, hands,
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:33.560]  and neck after literally fighting off two terrorists. Okay, this is why he's in the
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:39.880]  deradicalization program, because he dared to tell the public what the terrorists were saying
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:45.080]  while they were carrying out this attack, which was quote, this is for Allah and quote Islam,
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:50.680]  Islam Islam. Now there's a video horrifying video but from that attack when the terrorists are
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:55.800]  literally killing people from somebody who's coward under a chair or a table in a restaurant.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.720]  And somebody else shouts how it might even have been this guy, Royal Honor, the Lion of London
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:08.760]  Bridge. Someone else shouts out, oh, this is effing Muslims, which it was. And the Muslims
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.520]  carrying out the attack were saying this is for Allah, this is for Islam. So in the video,
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:17.560]  someone shouts out, this is effing Muslims. And then one of the victims to illustrate the
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:23.160]  Stockholm syndrome literally says in the moment when he's cowering from Islamic terrorists,
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:28.840]  Oh, no, this is not Muslim shut up. So he's literally denying that it's an Islamic terror
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.880]  attack while the terrorists are saying it's an Islamic terror attack while he's literally cowering
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:39.960]  under a table because it's more important to be politically correct than dead. So on the flip
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:46.520]  side, you've got this Royal Honor who was the hero of the whole thing. Now he's been put in a on a
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:52.360]  terror watch list by the government. And he's been forced to attend deradicalization classes.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:57.560]  He says quote, they treat me like a terrorist, but I'm not political at all. So he wasn't even
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.760]  political. And they've put him in this database, they've put him on this program. Meanwhile, as I
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:08.760]  mentioned, we had another story from back in May. British Army safe people who describe themselves
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:17.000]  as patriots are extremist right wingers. Now bear in mind, just like in America, in many cases,
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:24.520]  the army itself is being taken over by these social engineers. So they put out a TV commercial
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:31.320]  trying to recruit Muslims into the British Army by showing the Muslim soldier doing a Muslim prayer
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:36.360]  while on operation while in full British Army uniform. Problem is, that hasn't really worked,
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:43.400]  Alex, because more British Muslims joined ISIS than joined the British Army didn't really work out.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.920]  But then it got even worse because they put out this leaflet, the British Army.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:53.880]  And it says extreme right wing indicators and warnings. This is what they list as indications
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:59.640]  of right wing extremism. People who describe multicultural towns as lost, people who use the
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:05.080]  term islamo fascism, which is used by academics and everyone, people who refer to political
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:09.400]  correctness as a left wing plot, people who are angry about the loss of national identity,
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:14.040]  people who make inaccurate generalizations about the left or government, that's so vague,
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:18.200]  it could mean anything. And people who refer to those who challenge any of these views as being
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:26.040]  indoctrinated. And they include describing oneself as a quote, Patriot is an indication of right
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:31.400]  wing extremism. So they're literally saying that if you say you're a patriot who wants to join the
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.640]  British Army, you're probably a right wing extremist. Meanwhile, they're pointing out
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.440]  television commercials trying to recruit Muslims into the British Army. Paul, stay there. I want
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:45.080]  to ask you what you think is coming next as a right wing. Stay there. I want you to tell
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.840]  us what you think is coming next. And then the founder of Oak Keepers joining us to give us his

[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:23.400]  From deep in the heart of FEMA region six, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:33.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, the lion of London bridge that stopped a bunch of Muslims who had stabbed
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:38.200]  eight people to death, run over a bunch of others, injured 30 others. He fought them off,
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:43.400]  he was stabbed more than 30 times, had over 50 stitches just in his neck. They tried to slit
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:48.520]  his throat, missed his carotid arteries. It's absolutely incredible. Let me just show people
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:53.160]  a photo of this right now. Doc Mcamp shot please. Let me just look at his neck right there.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:59.000]  Absolutely insane. Stabbed over and over again. He has been sent to a reeducation camp.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.120]  That's what it is. He's been sent for anti extremist training because someone in the
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:09.800]  crowd while they're being stabbed said, oh, it's damn Muslims. We're not joking. Paul Watson
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:14.600]  just covered that. And it's just in the news. Well, he's he's on probation now. He's going
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:21.560]  for reeducation. These are globalist taking over our countries. That's why Beto O'Rourke has gone
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:26.840]  to Mexico to organize the next invasion force. When he was running for Senate, he was bragging
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:31.400]  that, oh, three caravans got in last week. Because, you know, we're putting them in concentration
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:37.560]  camps. Paul Joseph Watson looking at the anti foot chemical attacks, mixing up the hundreds of
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:44.840]  glasses of quick set concrete to put people's eyes out, splitting people's heads open.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:51.640]  And this happened Saturday and Fox News was saying, oh, you know, oh, somebody got hit in the head
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:57.560]  of the milkshake. No, people have had their head split open. They have had asset attacks on them.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:02.040]  If you or I did this to a leftist, we'd go to prison immediately. The police would do something.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:07.080]  Why is the left seen as God and able to engage in any crimes they want? And what do you predict
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:12.680]  this for the July with the coddled Antifa? Most of them government workers saying they're coming
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:17.560]  to DC to try to stop Trump's Fourth of July rally pledging to attack people with acid.
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:23.960]  Well, the media is never going to admit that these are violent domestic terrorists because
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:28.440]  their narrative radicalized them in the first place. That's the whole point. They're responsible
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:35.400]  for it by putting out this ridiculous narrative that some soy boy in a mask, some run in a mask,
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:41.640]  is on the same level as the troops storming the beaches of Normandy in that absurd comparison
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:47.720]  that they did a couple years ago, which by the way, people like Chris Cuomo on CNN actually supported.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:54.920]  They literally compared these runs to British soldiers who are actually fighting Nazi troops
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:00.600]  on the beaches in France. But what's going to happen? Probably at some point you've had
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:07.720]  ISIS's own propaganda magazine come out and say, look, we broadly support the same goals as the
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:13.800]  extreme left in America. Let's work together. Let's give them weapons. Let's give them training.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:19.640]  There was an FBI field manual, which we reported on last year, I think it was. Can't find the
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.960]  articles anymore, Alex, because Google broke its own search engine. So there's no way I'm going to
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:30.600]  find them. But I reported on it for info wars, where it was, again, Antifa, far left radicals,
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:37.640]  and ISIS Islamic terrorists looking to work together. You had a guy who tried to massacre vast
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:44.440]  numbers of people. This came out December 2017. Pius 39 terrorist was an anti-Trump
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:51.880]  and Tifa supporter. Muslim convert called every Aaron Jamison who planned to carry out a Christmas
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:57.800]  Day massacre on Pia 39 in San Francisco. You go on his Facebook page, he likes Antifa,
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:03.400]  he likes Al Jazeera, he likes BuzzFeed, he likes CNN. Of course, whenever anyone pops off
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:08.360]  a right wing extremist, which we denounce because we denounce all political violence,
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:13.080]  if he so much does like one of your tweets five years ago, then you're responsible for
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:19.880]  his violence. This guy was literally straight out of Antifa casting. He was a Muslim convert,
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:25.320]  planned a massacre, and that story disappeared. It barely made the news. So the threat obviously
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:30.360]  is, when are they going to start working together? And that is hopefully why federal
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:35.800]  authorities actually have to be on this now and treating it seriously, given what happened in
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:42.520]  Portland on Saturday. What do you make of Ted Cruz coming out and saying he wants the
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:47.080]  Portland mayor investigated? The Portland mayor has admittedly ordered police stand downs,
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:50.040]  and the police sit there, I guess, because they're leftist or want their paycheck,
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:55.000]  and allow even children to be attacked, people to be attacked with acid and metal clubs.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.480]  That is violating their oath of office. They're aiding in abetting terrorism now.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.200]  I absolutely agree. We need to see that mayor in chains.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:10.680]  Well, the guy who got smashed in the head with the metal pipe with the lacerations and absolutely
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:15.320]  shocked that he didn't get brain damage or something, he's very lucky. He said that his
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.720]  problem was not with the police because they actually came to actually try and file a report
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:25.720]  and try and investigate it. So he's blaming Wheeler, he's blaming the mayor. How much
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:30.440]  of it is the police doing a stand down? Because last year they did start confiscating the weapons
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:36.520]  in Portland from Antifa members. That obviously didn't happen on Saturday. So it looks like once
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:41.400]  again, it's coming from the mayor, it's coming from Wheeler, this stand down order, and it's to
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:46.840]  what extent you blame the police, to what extent you blame the mayor. But this guy himself, the victim,
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:53.080]  directly blamed the mayor. And you've also got to blame verified checkmarks on Twitter,
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.480]  some of them who work in the mainstream media, people like Sarah Gailey,
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:02.840]  with a verified Twitter user who said, quote, while this is all happening, if we can't throw
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:10.360]  milkshakes, I guess we'll just have to go back to bricks, literally advocating violent crime and
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:15.800]  domestic terrorism under a verified Twitter account. The tweet wasn't even deleted as last
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:20.920]  time. And Paul, let's expand on that. If you watch the videos, we have a one minute boil down,
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.080]  we've been rolling for TV viewers, we have them all unedited hours of them on infowars.com and
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.880]  newswars.com, but the audience must get out to warn the public about because mainstream media is
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:35.240]  soft soaping this or whitewashing it. Even Fox News is some of the quote milkshakes, nothing
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:41.160]  comes out. They're hardened, they're bricks camouflaged in a cup. Others are still liquid
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:46.760]  and burn their faces. You're actually more lucky to be hit by the brick than by the acid. These
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:52.600]  are assaults with deadly weapons, assaults with chemical weapons. This is just unprecedented
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:58.360]  and it just shows the ratcheting up towards 2020 as America turns towards the left as they turn
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.160]  against them. They're just going to get more and more out of control.
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:06.520]  Yeah, and it's when people are going to start paying attention. I mean, you had
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.240]  Farage being attacked, you've had other people in the UK being attacked. Matt Gaetz was attacked
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:18.040]  with a milkshake on June 1st, the Republican congressman. Now it's come out that a staffer
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:24.280]  who is on the campaign of Mayor Pete is now advocating that he be attacked with your in next
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:29.640]  time. So they always want to step it up. So it's whether it gets to the level where you have actual
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.960]  lawmakers, elected congressmen and women being viciously attacked, not just with
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:40.120]  bullets already happened. Remember, the crazy guy went from Illinois because he was mad at Trump,
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:45.000]  tried to kill the 18 members of the conservative caucus, but there was security there and took
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  him out. But not before he shot the congressman from Louisiana. I mean, this is the reality
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.480]  of what's happening. And then even CNN praised the guy, not as a terrorist, but as a hero.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:04.440]  Wolf Blitzer had guests on saying he was a hero going after the evil people and shooting
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:11.000]  congressman's police. Yeah, James T. Hodgkinson, Bernie Sanders fan was screaming about healthcare
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.840]  when he was trying to massacre a bunch of Republican congressmen. Then you had the guy who remember
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:22.520]  before the election, rushed the stage and tried to violently attack Donald Trump while he was
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:27.640]  given a speech in front of Air Force One. What happened to that him in the media, the next day
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:33.480]  he was given a sympathetic platform. He was lionized by CNN and others. So this is the whole
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:39.880]  point. The radicalization process itself has come from the mainstream media, which is now they can't,
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:45.880]  why they can't suddenly disavow Antifa because they've been in for the, for the, for the duration
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:50.120]  with them from the very start. So that's why, I mean, to be fair, there were a few like even
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:56.520]  Brian Stelter had to decry it. Jake Tapper had to decry it. So the dam is breaking a little bit,
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:01.960]  but then you've still got hundreds on Twitter who still advocate violent terrorism. And they've
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.680]  got blue check on Twitter is allowing it and condoning it and boosting it. And in closing,
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:13.240]  I've been sued by Georgetown University claiming I said some photographer killed that woman in
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:17.800]  Clarksville or whatever it was in Virginia, Charlottesville, Charlottesville teleprompter
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:23.880]  free folks. No, I said Antifa was funded by Soros. The police stood down, herded them together,
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:29.080]  knowing there'd be an explosion. And then the media tried to brand Antifa as heroes then,
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.600]  which they're not. And so that's why they're pissed at suing me is because I talked about
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:36.760]  their little darling meth head professors that dress up like Batman and go out and attack women
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:42.360]  and children. Paul, you're kicking butt with your prolific writing at news wars.com info wars.com

[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:32.200]  healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone. Anybody over 40 in the
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:37.000]  North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.800]  cardiovascular system healthy. Order your two month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.

[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.320]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:07.080]  kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago before all the
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:11.320]  censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:15.080]  are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd have doctors on an experts to explain why
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:19.080]  they were so good. And instead the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.960]  they'll shut us down. The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:25.320]  great they are and how wonderful they were. And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:32.120]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements. No, under federal law since 1996,
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.760]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:41.240]  won't look at it. But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.080]  is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:49.000]  And a lot of drugs work great. They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.320]  doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest. InfowarsStore.com or triple eight, two, five,
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:01.960]  three, three, one, three, nine. It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:06.840]  the public square. The other thing that's unique about Infowars is it is the only network of this
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:11.560]  reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy. That's not backed by some
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:15.960]  billionaire. That's not being funded by a secret foreign government. It is completely independent
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:21.640]  of all that. It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:25.960]  of press and freedom of speech that in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:30.680]  of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:34.360]  this was the kind of press they wanted. And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.440]  mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:43.720]  control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear. And
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:48.840]  the Infowars audience has broken through that. They are the bridge from the founding to the
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:53.080]  modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom. And that's why there's been an unprecedented
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:20:04.600]  onslaught of the platforming defamation, lawfare and libel targeting you. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:35.400]  Spindless from the start, suck it to the past, suck it to touch the town. You pay the need, wow.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:48.600]  Place, place, spreading his disease, living by his story. Ness, ness, volunteers suffer for his glory.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:54.360]  Imagine, ladies and gentlemen, you have photos, you have video of terrorists
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:03.240]  cooking chemical attacks in a Portland park right by the police. And then coming out and
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:11.960]  doing it, launching the attack. And it's not even national news. Quick set concrete and put your
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:17.480]  eyes out. But also they were letting it harden. They were really bricks. And they said we're
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:22.840]  going to go out and attack. They split people's heads open. And they did it all, organized
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:31.320]  criminal activity, organizing for assaults with deadly weapons, mixing quick set concrete with
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:37.960]  the lime and four types of acid in it. Anybody's ever worked with quick set concrete? No, it's
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:42.920]  you got to drop up in your eye. It's like bleach. It can blind you. One time I wouldn't listen to
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:47.320]  these guys like, man, you better be careful. I was working on a construction site. And the
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.880]  it was almost set. And I was sitting there just playing around with it, patting on it, and it
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:57.160]  burned my hands. Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers Army Veteran, has also practiced a
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:02.440]  constitutional lawyer, joins us to give us his take on this, Beto O'Rourke going and campaigning
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:07.080]  for a president in Mexico. That's even a peace headline. We're going to talk about the left
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:14.120]  clearly is going into a revolutionary mode. It's a Marxist, Leninist mode, with a malice mindset
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:17.880]  from my research. Stuart, what would you call this incredible period we're in right now?
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:26.040]  I think it's weather underground part two. I think it's the same exact pattern you saw in
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:32.440]  the late 60s, early 70s, except now, as you've already noted, they've got a mass of new voters.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:37.080]  And they're replacing Americans with new voters from other countries through illegal immigration
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:42.360]  and mass. That's why all of the Democratic candidates, they were talking to their new
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:46.920]  constituency. They weren't talking to American citizens. So President Trump is going to take
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:52.440]  decisive action right now. In addition to declaring an antifa terrorist organization,
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:57.880]  he should go ahead and just federalize the National Guard and deploy them into both California
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:03.480]  and Oregon. And while he's there, not just press antifa, but also start rounding up
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:06.280]  illegal aliens and deporting them using the National Guard, frankly.
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:14.360]  So what do you have to do? Absolutely. And they'll call that martial law. Now,
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:19.480]  we have foreign powers, the Chai comms and others funding revolution. We have the Democratic Party
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:23.800]  calling for violence in the streets. We have this video will play next segment of all these
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:29.560]  Democrats calling for violence against Republicans and against their supporters. You have major
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:34.200]  talk show hosts on the BBC calling for Nigel Farage to be acid attack. They're saying they're
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:40.200]  going to attack the 4th of July all over Twitter and Facebook with acid. They just attacked a bunch
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:46.040]  of people with acid in Portland and CNN's calling them heroes and Fox is barely reporting it. I
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:52.920]  mean, this is crazy. It is. And so we should recognize we're already in a civil war. We talked
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:58.120]  about this before with Matt Bracken. We've been in a cold civil war for years. But the left,
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:03.640]  I believe, is ramping it up. And we should just go ahead and just pull the trigger on now.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:09.160]  In the form of President Trump declaring what it is and declaring an insurrection and deploying
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:12.920]  the military on the border to seal it. And then internally, he should use a National Guard
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:16.840]  and he should call on us, the retired military that runs out there in particular,
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:22.200]  and bring us in the service too as the militia. He should do. And of course, what's happening is
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:25.880]  his advisor is telling him, well, you can't do this. You can't go after them. You can't
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:31.000]  go after the sanctuary cities or sanctuary states. You can't do any of these things or the
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.320]  country will explode. Well, let it explode. Let it explode now when he's commander in chief.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:38.760]  Let's get it over with. Otherwise, what's going to happen is they're going to steal the election.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.240]  I mean, the judicial watch already came out and said at least a million and a half. I think it's
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:48.280]  very low million and a half illegal aliens voted in midterms. I think it's far, far higher than
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:54.520]  that. So I think that's just in California. They just won their lawsuit in California. It's 1.5
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:58.760]  million. That just broke judicial watch.org. Absolutely. Proving that Trump was right when
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.880]  he said 3.5 million nationwide. I bet it was more like 10 million.
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:07.480]  Yeah, I think so too. I think it's far higher. And it'll probably be closer to 20 million
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:12.200]  those next year for 2020. That's what they're doing. And it's the only reason why all of them
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:17.480]  are catering to, you know, speaking in Spanish and catering to the illegal aliens,
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:22.120]  promising them free healthcare, promising them to decriminalize being in the United States.
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:25.640]  In other words, carte blanche. You come here. You can stay here. You won't be deported and
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:30.840]  devised. And they say on the stage, all Hispanics are insulted by us having borders. Most Hispanics,
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:34.200]  I know, aren't insane. They don't want open borders. They know it's people all over the
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.880]  world coming in. You had some ancestors that came from Mexico, but they came here legally.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:43.640]  Right. And that's the reality is a lot of American patriots in the Hispanic community
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:49.320]  are also very much in favor of secure borders. This is complete nonsense. So all that really is,
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:55.880]  is the standard leftist tool. All they have is to call us all racist and fascist and xenophobic
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:26:00.760]  while they go ahead and replace Americans of every color. Black, Hispanic, we're all being
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:05.880]  replaced, but with some of them from a third world country who has been given a free ride and be
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:10.840]  given, you know, they get a thousand dollars on their cards and free housing. We're going to
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:13.720]  walk through all that in the next segment. I'm going to try to give you the floor because
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:17.640]  you're an expert on the border and have spent thousands of days down there in the last decade
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:22.520]  covering it all and where you predict this is going. But I want to say something. What you said
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:29.080]  is incredibly profound and it's so profound that we almost just can't come on air and just kind of
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:36.200]  halfway talk about it. So I want to come back and I want to specifically get in to what you
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:40.520]  just said because it's true. I don't want a violent revolution. I don't want to offensively
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:46.600]  launch anything. But when the left is terrorist, they're far and funded. They say we don't believe
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.720]  in free speech. We're going to open for the government. We're going to kill our political
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:54.040]  opposition and they're out there chemical attacking people. They're saying we're going to
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:59.560]  attack for the July Parades. The mainstream media is promoting it. The borders have broken down.
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:05.400]  The leftist Congress won't act and is blocking the president. We're already here. We've already
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:11.560]  been brought into this crisis and we have the entire democratic stage of 20 people speaking
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:16.040]  in Spanish and pandering to those outside the country and Beto going to Mexico saying,
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:21.400]  let's tear down the border and invade. This is the globalist onslaught. This is America
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:26.200]  facing fifth generation warfare. This is the globalist move. And what you said is so profound.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:30.120]  We come back. We want to give you the floor as your military background, constitutional
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.760]  lawyer background, but also just a man who's been trained on the streets of this country
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:41.880]  traveling to all 50 states and predicting this over a decade ago that Trump's in now. Imagine
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:46.200]  if Hillary was in. Imagine if they assassinated him. And again, we're going to win this physical
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.200]  civil war, but I predict it's going to kill millions. They're going to start the fight.
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.680]  We're going to defend ourselves. They've already been punching us in the nose. They're going to
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.680]  label us terrorists. They're going to order blue city police to come after us and then it's all
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.840]  going to kick off and it's going to be Katie bar the door and then they're going to call it a race
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:09.320]  war and going to trick a lot of folks into a race war and the country is going to descend into a
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:15.400]  black hole. It's going to descend into a warlord state for several years. I would predict at least
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:19.800]  five years and the blue cities will starve to death. We're going to have to quarantine those
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:24.840]  cities and we need to let's talk about is there time to turn it around, but let's work in the
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:29.080]  scenarios of having to quarantine the blue cities as the best move during the civil war.
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:35.080]  And we know Trump's got the military for now and what the real divides are in the civil war,
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:40.520]  but it's time to really be honest about all this and why they got so upset about me last year when
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:46.280]  I said Antifa says they're coming to your houses to kill you. Congressman, federal law enforcement
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:50.520]  others, patriots, talk show host. You need to have your battle rifles ready. We're already in a civil
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:54.600]  war. They went on errands that I called for violence. They wanted me banned. No, they knew that I was
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:29:00.440]  aware of their plan and said get ready. Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:05.480]  ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS and won. I beat the IRS then and
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:09.720]  I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands

[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:02.920]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become? Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:06.840]  the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political,
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:10.840]  or legal for their illicit activities over two decades. And because of that, that's why the
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:14.760]  courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this,
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:18.280]  the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:22.360]  social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct. Otherwise, they will never
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:26.440]  change and they will become the big tech Golo Garks, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:31.000]  century who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:36.040]  to recover after the Great Depression. The inforward's audience is the fuel that flames the light of
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:41.160]  liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:46.040]  original promise of an independent free press. Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:49.960]  and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:53.720]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening. It's the ultimate form of
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:57.880]  gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:05.960]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world. The viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:10.280]  if it wasn't for you. And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen,
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:14.600]  but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:19.080]  means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:22.920]  people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth. And so I
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:27.880]  feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart. I want
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:31.720]  you to know that love is right back at you. And I want to thank you for all you've done with your
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:35.800]  word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support because I'm committed to fight to the
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:40.920]  end, but I want to win. And without you, I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun,
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:45.960]  but that's not what's important. The enemy could win. We're a key chess piece in this fight. We're
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:50.840]  being used by God. You're being used by God. This is Providence. So I salute you and I thank you for
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:57.400]  all you've done from the bottom of my heart. Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:05.000]  The time has come. The time is here. The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.320]  to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world could
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:14.200]  come here and get everything free, but that we, the citizens, have to pay for it. When our nation
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:19.400]  is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:25.000]  into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:30.680]  and the U.S. to collapse the countries to kill capitalism and bring in socialism so we can go
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:34.760]  the way of the old Soviet Union, North Korea, and Venezuela. This is a plan. That's why we've got
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:38.040]  to stay on air. It's why you've got to keep fighting because we're going to win this in the end.
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:42.760]  Thanks to you and your support. That's what makes it all possible, so I salute you and I thank you,
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:47.160]  but I ask you again, do your shopping with us and we will continue on the face of this.
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:52.520]  InfowarsStore.com, 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, whatever you do,
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:56.440]  commit now to history and know that buying products from us is one of the most important
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:09.320]  things you can do in the fight against the globalist.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:35.480]  Look at these headlines. Third arrest made in connection to plan the portable acid attack.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:40.200]  That's from two years ago where Project Veritas got video of Antifa leaders in DC
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.480]  planning chemical attacks and they're mixing other types of acids, you name it,
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:50.360]  clearly in these videos. They're saying they're doing it with quick-set concrete.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:55.880]  They're beating people in the head with steel bars. This is terrorism. Antifa plans acid attacks
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:02.600]  on DC free speech rally coming up this week. Vows to blind attendees. They say that is the
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:07.240]  goal. Far left group ratcheting up violence and then I'm going to play the clip next segment
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:12.600]  of them saying on CNN, it's like radiation treatment for a sick country. Anybody that's
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:19.160]  Republican as a Nazi, we're going to hurt you. Stewart wrote as practice constitutional law,
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:23.320]  won awards, I guess when he was at Yale for it, worked for Ron Paul,
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:29.240]  an army veteran and founder of both keepers. Really smart guy about this whole attack that's
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:34.280]  happening and the huge bombshell he dropped that we're already in a civil war. Like Patrick Henry
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:42.600]  said, the war has already begun. You can sit here and deny it to yourself. So lay this out.
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:50.600]  Well, yes, that's where we're at. The left in this country, we're in a situation where the left
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:58.280]  now a democratic party is now dominated by Marxist. AOC is the new wave. This is the mask coming off.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:04.040]  And as we already said earlier, their new constituency is the rest of the world. It's
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:08.760]  not the American people who are actually born here of any race, whether you're white, black,
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:15.000]  or brown. The new constituency is the rest of the world. They're giving a free pass to come here.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.520]  Doors wide open with no, right now there's no penalty. So this is the problem with the Trump
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:25.960]  administration's failure, frankly, to secure our border. He should be acting as commander in chief
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:31.080]  right now. He shouldn't be going hat in hand to Congress or begging some judge somewhere to let
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:35.880]  him defend the country. You should tell that judge to go stuff it. You should go to the Supreme
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:41.320]  Court with direct jurisdiction and say, until you decide, until you hear, tell her back from you,
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:45.560]  I'm going to defend this country and defend its borders and call out the military to do so,
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:51.160]  declare the cartels, international terrorist organizations, and then also declare antifa
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:56.120]  to be in a terrorist organization as well, and deploy the military on the border and seal it.
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:01.320]  All of these so-called refugees should be kept on a military base or put back to Mexico straight
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:05.320]  away. They should not be dispersed inside the United States. And they should be willing to
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:10.840]  call it out. I think Congress McCarthy has now started to speak openly about the ties between
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:15.960]  the Democrats and the cartels and calling it out for what they are. Of course, the Democrats
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:21.000]  taking barrage in the cartels is the same thing the cartels do in Mexico. So the Democrats,
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.600]  which has been done in Europe, are using these other elements. They're in line with the cartels.
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:32.680]  I believe they're in line with ISIS and Hamas and groups like that. And antifa is their military
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:37.640]  wing, their revolutionary guard. And so what's going to happen in this country is that leading
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:42.360]  up to the election, they're going to open this floodgate even more and bring in millions of
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:46.040]  more new voters into sanctuary states and sanctuary cities, and they're going to vote.
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:49.240]  That's why it's a mistake to send them there. You saw Rush Limbaugh and others saying,
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:53.800]  you know, send them all to sanctuary cities. All that does is lock in even more of a popular vote.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:59.640]  And all these states going into this alliance to give the next presidency to the popular vote
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:03.400]  is going to guarantee a Democrat in the White House. Trump would be the last Republican
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:07.720]  president unless he takes the size of action right now. And if it's going to kick off, of course,
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:12.280]  the thing that's back to your mind is, well, if we do any of these things, if he deploys a military
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:17.240]  on the border, he sends a National Guard out there and federalizes them and has them go around
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:22.520]  and round up illegal aliens, then it will cause a revolution or cause a civil war in this country.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:27.400]  Well, so be it. The left is going to go kinetic. Let it happen while Trump is commander-in-chief
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:32.200]  of the US military and in control of all of our newt. That's right. They know they've lost the
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:37.000]  hearts and minds. And unless they weaponize the third world, bring them into refugee centers,
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:41.400]  radicalize them and then bring them in, give them driver's license and have them vote,
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:45.320]  New York just legalized that. California is legalizing it. They know unless they really
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:48.760]  overthrow the country now, they're going to lose. So they're accelerating clowered and
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:53.400]  piven the Marxist-Leninist program. And they say that themselves. We're not just saying this.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:38:00.200]  This is happening. Yeah, they say openly there's no such thing as an illegal person
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:06.920]  on stolen land. You've got David Hobsick's hogs saying it's exact same thing all over Twitter
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:11.640]  and anti-flawed chance, you know, no borders, no law on the USA at all. And the Democrats
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:16.920]  platform is exactly that. To decriminalize illegal entry in the United States to end
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:23.320]  and fight against. And then say we got to pay for housing, medicine, healthcare, education.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:30.520]  That is total bankruptcy. Well, it's also just a promise. It's like Bernie promising all the, you
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:36.920]  know, all your school loans would be. Or Yang offering free money. Exactly. Folks,
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:40.520]  anytime somebody saying, communists always say, we're going to give you free money.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.920]  We just have to put all of our enemies in concentration camps. Did you see the video
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:49.480]  during the debate? We're going to play the next segment of de Blasio saying there's plenty of
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:54.440]  money. We just haven't taken it away from people yet. I mean, wow, that is, that is literally Joe
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:59.640]  Stalin. And of course, you're never going to get the super wealthy or never going to have their money
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:05.240]  confiscated and redistributed. It's just a lie to buy votes. Once the Democrats get a permanent
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:11.720]  lock on power via massive vote fraud, then of course, they'll keep promising all these things
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:15.160]  and they'll keep bleeding out the American taxpayer. And it's pretty more money to support
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:20.280]  their new constituency, which will never get another Republican in office again. And I think
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:24.440]  that if, if they were to do this and still the election, I think the political right in this
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:29.160]  country will not, will not accept the results will be in a civil war anyway. So you might as well,
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:32.360]  this is kind of like being sick and you need to throw up, right? You just take your finger
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:35.800]  down your throat and get it over with and get it over with now so that you're not, you're not as
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:39.320]  bad off later. That's where we're at. That's right. When you learn that you've eaten something
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:45.720]  poisonous. One time we were hunting when I was like 13 years old and one of my buddies stuck some
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:50.680]  pellets in the glass of water, you know, stupid teenagers and I drank it back and went in my
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:57.080]  stomach and I knew I had to get it out of me or I was going to get lead poisoning and get really,
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:01.720]  really, really, really, really sick. And I vomited up one of the pellets, but couldn't get the other
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:06.920]  out. That's super sick for days had the, you know, the, you know what, but it was terrible. But I
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:11.880]  wish I'd have gotten that second pellet out of my gut. We know poison in us and the longer we wait,
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:16.920]  the worse it's going to get. Exactly. Well, it's going to happen in the short term though,
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:24.120]  because of the failures of the Portland PD, for example, as it just failed, you had multiple
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:30.120]  persons attacked over the weekend. You had, you know, Andy, no, of course, but you had Mr. Adams
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:34.200]  who attacked him and his friend. So you had, you had, you know, on camera,
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:39.640]  they're being struck in the head with steel poles. That's a lethal force. And it's, it's a lucky for
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:43.880]  them. They weren't killed. And Andy was stuck, struck with, like you said before, cups full of
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.440]  concrete. So this is actually lethal force and eventually anti-fraud is going to kill somebody.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.160]  What's going to happen in the short term though, is that all of us out here who, who believe in
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:41:00.280]  free speech are going to wind up going there again to do their job for them. We did Berkeley in 2017.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:04.120]  We were there twice in Berkeley. There were, there were multiple events in Berkeley where American
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:09.320]  Patriots stood up. We had three, three percenters, bikers were Trump, both keepers. You had the
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:12.280]  Proud Boys. And you had just, just average, you know, America.
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:16.440]  Notice how your Proud Boys, they come after you like your enemy number one. They say it's a terror
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:20.840]  group, though they were never designated that. They are so scared of Americans standing up.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:26.520]  But to watch five or six guys beating an older gentleman in the head with steel clubs, hitting
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:32.840]  them as hard as they can. I mean, just the cowardice, the scumminess, and he was helping
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:38.600]  some transvestite gay dude they were beating up. Mr. Adams was, I mean, just-
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:45.240]  He's lucky he's alive. That's lethal force. And if he wanted to carry a firearm, he would have
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:49.800]  been justified in using that firearm to save his life. And of course, they would have prosecuted
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:53.480]  him for murder and call him a terrorist. This is where we're at though. I mean, Americans are
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:57.640]  going, it's going to happen. Americans are once again going to stand up and go and defend people
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:01.080]  in the streets of Portland. So you might wind up with a kicking off in Portland.
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:06.040]  And you just had a situation where it almost kicked off when they're, when they're a crazy governor
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:11.800]  sent the state police out trying to find the 11 Republican state senators who would not come back
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:17.320]  to deny a quorum for their insane climate change bill. That was also a powder keg. Luckily,
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:21.480]  they didn't actually try to go and arrest these state senators. Imagine if one of them had been
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:26.520]  shot and killed during the attempt at arrest. So this, this is the problem. Oregon has become
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:30.280]  a focal point and a potential powder keg in this country right now.
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:35.000]  It's funny you mentioned people defending themselves, it being called criminal.
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:40.200]  The lion of London Bridge who fought off all the Muslims that killed all the people,
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:45.000]  he's been sent to reeducation because he said it was Muslims that attacked him.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.680]  And then a man in New York, they busted in his house physically attacking. He shot and killed
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:54.120]  two intruders. They're putting him in prison for defending himself in upstate New York. We'll be right back.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:03.560]  The time has come. The time is here. The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:07.400]  to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:11.960]  world could come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:17.000]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms,
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:22.120]  we will collapse into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:28.040]  migrant waves in Europe and the US to collapse the countries, to kill capitalism and bring in
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:31.800]  socialism so we can go the way of the old Soviet Union, North Korea, and Venezuela.
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:35.480]  This is a plan. That's why we've got to stay on air. It's why you've got to keep fighting because
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:39.320]  we're going to win this in the end. Thanks to you and your support, that's what makes it all
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:43.960]  possible. So I salute you and I thank you, but I ask you again, do your shopping with us and
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:49.160]  we will continue on in the face of this. InfowarsStore.com, 50% off, store-wide free shipping,

[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:56.920]  us is one of the most important things you can do in the fight against the globalist.
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:04.520]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world. So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling,
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:09.080]  self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:14.040]  together and supporting one another and sustaining one another. It is the only independent press
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:19.640]  of this size and scale, of this public reach. It is the one model that says here's a way to have
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:25.000]  a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.400]  audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:33.720]  reached by their choices and supporting Infowars. And it's all because the audience spends their
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:38.360]  whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:42.920]  that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:48.200]  time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:52.280]  and what views they want to hold. And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:45:19.560]  experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.

[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:26.760]  I'm getting under their skin. I'm bloody and then I'm up politically. I'm banging heads with them
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.760]  and they can't help but attack back with lies. That just brings more people here. So I'm in
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:36.280]  one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds. I need gas. I need ammo politically now.
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:40.520]  But literally if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases and if you
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:44.200]  flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable. We're unstoppable together. I want to send a
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:48.120]  strong message to the enemy. I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:52.200]  know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and I will never back down.
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:56.120]  You have my commitment. This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:47:20.120]  facing and that we were right about this. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:30.920]  Welcome back. I'm your host, Alex Jones. The Democrats have openly come out and said the
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:35.000]  borders are wide open. They said they represent foreigners for free healthcare, free housing,
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.240]  free education. They say they can vote. Major States are handing out driver's license,
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:45.320]  letting them vote. California, New York and people like the Blasio and AOC and others are saying,
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:49.080]  hey, there's going to be plenty of money. We're just going to take it from rich people and give
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:56.040]  it to you. This is classic communism and it's when the establishment decides to wind up the hordes,
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:01.960]  the unwashed masses, people fleeing Venezuela that, hey, you'll finally get some free stuff,
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:05.560]  just let us into power and then, of course, all the prosperity disappears.
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:11.800]  And during one of the debates, the Blasio, the worst mayor in New York history, I think we'll
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:16.520]  take Carlson on that, said, oh, there's plenty of money. We're just going to take it all. Well,
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:21.400]  guess what? All the big rich billionaires, except Trump, fund people like him because he
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:25.960]  domesticates people. All the big ultra-rich have their money offshore. They want America to fall
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:30.040]  and do a collapse. They'll buy it all up cheap. The globalists say they've always been competing
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:34.040]  with the American system. Since the British Empire, they don't like you being an uppity.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:38.680]  You having a swimming pool? You having a nice car? You being able to do what you want? They want to
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:43.960]  make you poor. It's called feudalism. It's called serfdom. So here's the shocking announcement
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:49.480]  that they want a violent overthrow and then CNN saying Antifa's heroes, I'm going to play that,
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:55.080]  and then it gets worse. Remember what Joe Biden said a few weeks ago? He wants a physical revolution.
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:59.880]  So Stuart Rhodes of Oathkeepers.org is right. They're going into a physical revolution.
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:05.640]  Here's the Blasio, promising the poor. All these goodies, if you just let us arrest who we want,
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:09.000]  but it won't be Bloomberg. It won't be Bill Gates. Here it is.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.720]  Yes, we're supposed to be for 70% tax rate on the wealthy.
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:16.840]  Here folks say there's not enough money. What I say to them every single time is
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:21.240]  there's plenty of money in this world. There's plenty of money in this country. It's just in the
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:28.680]  wrong hands. And AOC says the world's ending in 12 years, but it's okay. She says that we
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:33.160]  can just have anything free we want. So going back to Stuart Rhodes, then I'm going to play some
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:38.040]  of these other clips. Clearly, as you said, they're going hardcore Marxists. They've been
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:41.880]  breeding this in the universities. It's always been the plan to do this down the road. But because
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:46.520]  Trump's in, nationalism's exploding, they're pulling out all the stops and going to pure
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:51.080]  authoritarianism. And I agree with you. If we don't take drastic measures that the president
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:55.160]  and others don't, we're going to lose this country. Well, yeah, the thumbing their nose at the U.S.
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:50:00.680]  Constitution and thumbing their nose at clear federal law with impunity. And so far, the
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:05.560]  Trump administration, DOJ has done nothing about this. There's been no investigations whatsoever,
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:11.560]  but I know of or indictments for harboring illegal aliens, for aiding, abetting illegal
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:17.640]  aliens, for harboring and abating and abetting terrorism, anti-fossil terrorist organization.
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:24.120]  Oh, you're right. The Oakland mayor and a bunch of others tell MS-13 when high
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:32.680]  no-knock warrants are coming of known mafia dens with sex slaves, you name it, the city calls and
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:39.080]  warns them so they can kill the feds. I forgot about that. Right. So they're in league with
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:43.640]  face facts. They're in league with the cartel because the cartels are helping them bring in
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:50.040]  a flood of new illegal voters for the Democrats. And of course, the cartels are profiting on this.
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:54.840]  I wouldn't be surprised at all to learn that the cartels are also paying the payoffs. At the same
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:59.080]  time, they're in league with radical communists inside this country who want to see an overthrow
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:03.000]  of our government overthrow of the system. Like you said before, it is cloward-piven,
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:07.560]  but it's also quite frankly an invasion with the domestic. But you agree they're making,
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:12.760]  they're making their move. Oh yeah, I think so. It's obvious. And so what they're doing is they're
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:17.560]  telling all the radical leftists who are truly Marxist and communist, they're telling them,
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:24.920]  hey, this is it. So that's their only real domestic constituency among the American people
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:29.000]  or the radical communists. That's right. They've got all the Hollywood movies trying to make blacks
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.600]  burn down the cities, all the race for stuff. That's not working. They're trying to get
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:36.840]  Hispanics to hate America. That's not working. So you go after these events, it's 90%
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:44.120]  method white professors and city workers. Right. It's young white students. I think it was,
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:49.800]  what's his name on Twitter, and on Poole. Tim Poole was saying that what this is,
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:56.440]  his antifa is an identitarian white movement. He's right. It's almost predominantly by 99%
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:02.040]  white. It's young white liberals who have been conditioned like a zombie invasion,
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:06.440]  basically, to hate their own country and to hate it with, you know, and so they'll fight to the
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:11.480]  death. And as I said before on your show, they'll go to the, they'll fight to the death, believing
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:16.520]  that they're being killed by Nazis when less veterans get up and take them and take them
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:21.400]  to task and, and, and beat them and kill them in the streets in a civil war. They will die
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:25.480]  believing with all their heart that they're fighting Nazis like their grandparents did
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:30.200]  in, in the, and let me stop you there. That's profound. I mean, veterans and people up against
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:34.520]  the general public would be, would, would, would, would, would wipe them out. But when I've watched
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:38.760]  the antifa, been there, but also watched the videos, these people are particularly pathetic.
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:42.520]  I mean, if I hit somebody with a steel club full power, they die probably. They're hitting them
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:46.440]  over and over again. It's splitting their skulls open, but it's not killing them. You hit somebody
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:51.720]  straight. You're, you tell them, I mean, these guys are so pathetic and so wimpy that if it goes
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:55.560]  to a real war, we're just going to wipe their ass out. But what you said is even more profound.
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:53:01.160]  We know MS 13. We know Hezbollah is an auxiliary for money laundering. The deals were made in
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:06.920]  fashion furious all the way into the Middle East and are actually sleeper cells. And antifa is
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:12.920]  only the decoy cover for Hezbollah. And I've been told this by high level CIA, FBI, people
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:15.880]  that have been involved wiping some of these groups out, you know, where they've just done
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:18.920]  the kill notices on them because they're foreigners and some of the worst leadership
[01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:21.480]  of it. I mean, I'm sure you've heard about that. You've got all your military forces.
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:24.920]  So we've been in a hot war for three years since Trump got in, but the Democrats in
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:28.280]  Hillary were preparing to use them as their muscle. That is so profound.
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:35.240]  Well, they're also using them as useful idiot, uh, cannon fodder. So I think what they want is
[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:43.800]  they'd love to see American veterans, you know, just kind of, you know, your sky's breaking up.
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:47.480]  I want you to do five more minutes with this. Put him on hold for a minute. I'm going to come back
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:51.000]  to him in a second and see if we do five more minutes to ask about solutions here. Folks,
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:56.360]  you cannot hype this stuff up enough. I cannot explain to you how insane, how out of control.
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:02.440]  And please remember to go to oathkeepers.org, support Stuart Rhodes and his great work as well.
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:06.520]  It's a great organization, demonized and attacked just like proud boys, but older,
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:11.160]  stronger, even more effective. If you're a veteran, you really should be part of oathkeepers.
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:14.920]  And of course, anybody can support oathkeepers, but this is it. This is a second American
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:18.520]  Revolution. We're fighting back. And I'm going to give you some inside baseball next
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:23.480]  segment with Stuart and our next guest comes on. But listen, I need financial support. I would
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:26.920]  already have like 10 more reporters. We've been much more effective. I'd have four or five more
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:31.720]  camera people and we would be able to really kick butt even despite the platforming if we had
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:36.120]  more capital. Thanks to your support. We're still here. We're still operating despite the boycotts,
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:39.880]  the attacks, the fake lawsuits, all of it. And, you know, now they're moving into even more
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:45.080]  sinister stuff to try to set me up. That's okay. I'm a big boy, but I don't want to go into political
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:50.840]  combat without the political ammo, without the crew, without the gear. I want to fight. I want
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:56.840]  to either, you know, fight and win or die trying. So I'm not a victim. I'm in the field. I love it,
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:02.440]  but I need provisions. And folks, it's a symbiotic relationship. infowarstore.com. We have the
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:07.480]  Fourth of July special, the Save the Info War special, store by 50% off, double Patriot points,
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:12.680]  store wide for shipping. We are selling out of X2. We are about to completely sell out of our
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:17.720]  survival shield X2, which we couldn't even get in for, remember for almost a year. This is your
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:23.240]  last chance to get a 50% off at infowarslife.com. The warehouse has just informed me for the show
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:27.240]  that we are about to sell out of our entire survival shield X2 inventory. It could be weeks
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:30.840]  or even months before the next shipment arrives. This is your last chance to secure your bottle
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:35.240]  survival shield X2 and learn what it does as the good halogen, the only pure iodine out there.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:41.880]  50% of infowarstore.com, 50% off right now before it's all gone. We will also be holding back bottles
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:49.560]  exclusively for auto ship customers. And you get an additional 10% off on that. And we're selling
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:55.560]  out of a bunch of other items at infowarstore.com. We've also got less than 100 of the limited
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:56:01.640]  edition clown world shirt that commemorates the debates. And as infowars.com on front and back,
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:08.600]  like a concert shirt, less than 100 left of those. But whatever you do, go to Oathkeeper's website
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:13.880]  as well. Get some of their great t-shirts because that's how we fund our operations. And we don't
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:20.200]  back down. Stuart works seven days a week over at oathkeepers.org as well. So be sure and get
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:25.400]  some of their great Oathkeeper ball caps and shirts or make a donation there. No matter who it is,
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:29.320]  folks, I've gotten the point with some activist groups where I'm just giving them donations
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:32.840]  because I know they're so effective and I never really talk about it. But back when we had more
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:37.880]  money, I was spending over a million dollars a year covertly funding other activist groups and
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:42.840]  organizations that did just such a great job. But it's gotten down to the point at this point
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:49.000]  where I can't even do that anymore. So whether it's oathkeepers.org or whether it's infowarstore.com,
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:56.040]  now is the time to be engaged. Now was the time to realize this isn't a drill. The left knows
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:57:00.440]  they're losing intellectually, culturally. We're going to come back, give Stuart the floor for five
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:06.920]  minutes about solutions, other things he's looking at, what else he thinks is about to happen. But
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:11.720]  I want to, I don't know his full view on this though I follow him and it's great research.
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:17.320]  They're doing this because they instinctively know they're losing. They're doing this because
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:22.600]  they know populism is exploding and they're doing this by basically hitting the panic button,
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:28.440]  the massive censorship, the massive violence, the bullying, dumping hot coffee and tea on
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:32.920]  me all the time when I'm out in public in any leftist area. But anytime you go outside of
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:37.640]  leftist areas, people love us. But the problem is the average person doesn't realize we're in
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:42.360]  the civil war now. They know they're losing and they're about to ratchet into a hot war.
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:45.800]  Hour number three with so many other guests as well. Please stay with us.
[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:52.120]  There is no longer any doubt multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:56.840]  violent, malice style overthrow of the US. Our borders are being totally collapsed,
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:01.240]  arty born babies are being killed, world government is here. Now is the time for decision. Now is
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:04.600]  the time for everyone watching and listening to decide which side they're on. And if you decide
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:08.440]  that you want to stop the forces that are banning the American flag and attacking the family and
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:12.360]  that are attacking our borders and our country and our military and our heritage, if you want to
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.440]  defend that, then now is the time to take action. And that means word of mouth about this broadcast.

[01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:51.160]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus here on the air. Thanks for holding.
[01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:55.320]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:59.800]  people here out in New York City. And one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees
[01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:04.280]  with these wars. I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war
[01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:08.760]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:12.840]  the approaching 2020. That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:16.280]  presidency. It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him. It's
[01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:19.880]  time to be praying, my friend. I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex,
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:24.440]  is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man. I would love
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:28.280]  to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:33.880]  80. But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles.
[01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:38.040]  And there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue. We're
[01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:42.280]  going to keep fighting in the info war. And even if something does happen to you or your show,
[01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:47.240]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty. Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:53.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:07.640]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:13.240]  I'm just an average man. Well, she's been demonized. She's been banned.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:22.120]  So interesting young lady put out some very sophisticated videos lately will be joining us.
[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:27.720]  We're going back to Stuart Rhodes of oathkeepers.org. Stuart, I know that Trump gives orders and then
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:32.280]  is ignored. So he says start the antitrust and then his people won't do it. They admit there's
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:38.200]  a mutiny. He signs documents. They won't execute them. You know, so his instincts right, but
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:46.120]  he's surrounded by people that won't do what they're told. Meanwhile, we've got all these reports
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:53.000]  pouring in CBS drama, the good fight calls for the assassination of Trump says punch anybody
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.120]  as a Trump supporter on the show. The corporate media knows what they're doing. And I just hope
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:01.400]  they know if this really kicks off, it's already kicking off, they're going to be held
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:06.440]  responsible. What does Trump need to do? And what are other angles of this? And what can we as
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:11.000]  citizens do to to whether it's going to happen or not? And I agree, we're already here basically
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:17.880]  to affect the battle space and get engaged now to make sure that we win this thing.
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:25.800]  But we have got to both push him and support him in acting as commander in chief.
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:30.920]  This is the only route he has left. And that's what's the one he should have used from day one.
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:36.360]  But you said he's surrounded by bad advisors. So we have to be able to reach, go around them
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:41.240]  and reach him with a message that he must deploy the troops on the border. He must be commander
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:46.280]  in chief. And so actually, I was contacted by a black gunnery Sergeant Marine Corps retired.
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:51.480]  We had a brilliant idea of doing a national stand to a veterans. And so we're going to do that.
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:58.360]  But we picked our Veterans Day, the weekend of Veterans Day, November 11th. There's already
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:02.360]  a rally going on of the three percenters of Arlington National Cemetery. So we're going to go
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:06.920]  ahead and join with them. But we're going to call for a national stand to all the military
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:10.840]  veterans in this country and then march from Arlington to the White House with a message to
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:15.720]  Trump for a clear message. He must act as commander in chief and deploy the military and
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:20.760]  deploy us as the militia and get this taken care of. And in between them, we're going to do state
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:27.320]  stand twos of military veterans in every state. And I picked August the 17th for that stand to.
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:32.040]  We already have Joe Biggs saying he's going to go to Portland on August 17th. So let's go ahead
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:36.360]  and make that the time when we all the military veterans come together. Of course, American
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:41.400]  Patriots were not prior service, have been doing responsibility to also stand up as well. But we
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:44.520]  want to make sure that the president gets a message from the military, from his current
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:49.240]  serving and retired military that he has to act as commander in chief. He must deploy the
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:53.400]  military on the border. He must call on the federal service, all the National Guard units of the
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:58.520]  states and put them on the border or even better, put them to work backing up eyes to go and round
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:03.800]  up the legal aliens who are going to be the voting block for the Democrats. If he does not do this
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:08.840]  and do this now, then we're done politically. The political solution window will have shut.
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:10.040]  It'll shut on 2020.
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:14.040]  No, you're right. God gave us a chance with Trump. And if we don't all execute right now,
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:17.880]  I mean, the Democrats admit we're bringing in a group to outvote you it's over. And we're going
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:22.680]  to bring in communism. So the country will be gone. This is how we get conquered. This is
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:27.400]  globalist forces, multinationals have said they're doing it. They're financing it. They're financing
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:32.040]  the refugee centers. This is an act of war. And Trump needs to cut all the funding from the UN,
[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:37.480]  doesn't he? Well, he does. But of course, the first thing he has to do is secure our nation
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:42.840]  and secure our vote. So because without the vote, the ability to actually vote for the next president,
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:47.080]  we will not accept the results. The election will be in a civil war. This is the last chance we
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:51.640]  had to fix this politically. He has got to shut that down. And by the way, everybody I know,
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:56.200]  black, white, old, young, it is sick of this. And everybody I know is just they're like,
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:04:00.760]  tell us Alex, when we stop paying taxes and we start doing whatever we want, and we start going
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:05.560]  after people. And by the way, my listeners aren't dumb. You're you're they're not dumb. People aren't
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:09.880]  going to go find antifa. We're going to I don't want this to happen. But I hope all the politicians
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:15.880]  and bureaucrats and people know Santa Claus has been making a list. Well, then you understand
[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:20.360]  that when you go into a warfare like that, a civil war, it's going to be their entire
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:24.600]  command and control. And it's going to include them being, you know, to include the journalists,
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:28.600]  it's going to include the leftist journalist or pushing them for propaganda. This is something
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:32.120]  that happens in every civil war. It's not going to that's why they've been pre preparing that
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:35.720]  Trump's attacking journalists, even though they're attacking him and causing a civil war.
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:41.560]  They want to cause the war and then make themselves victims when they get in big trouble.
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:45.320]  They're really playing with fire. They got a tiger by the tail. Thank you, Stuart Rhodes.

[02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:34.520]  to fit my dreams and plans now the pace world have been takes them when from the sales and it
[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:39.240]  looks like I've got a type of young lady who's been banned and restricted on most the internet
[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:45.080]  because she's a few potting mouth words the leftist can do that all day they can brag about
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:49.160]  killing born babies and talk about kill those little bastards take that two-year-old baby
[02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:56.280]  back some brains out that's the new trendy psychology in leftist media but if she uses the
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:07:00.920]  word poo poo or something she's got to be banned but she's put out a new video that's pretty
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:05.640]  sophisticated and I'm trying to figure out the full riddle to and we'll talk about that next
[02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:10.760]  segment here's some really good news you keep hearing about leftist judges blocking Trump's
[02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:16.360]  agenda but then it always goes to the supreme court and in almost every case he wins judicial
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:22.520]  watch org reports california begins massive voter roll cleanup notifies up to 1.5 million
[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:27.960]  inactive voters as part of judicial watch lawsuit settlement where people are voting in the names
[02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:33.320]  of dead people or folks that aren't on the voter rolls that's 1.5 million evidence of illegal
[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:38.920]  aliens voting and others in california backing up that trump says 3.3 million voted against him
[02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:44.440]  illegally in the election that was in major university studies that looked at the voter rolls
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:50.680]  so there you go they're having to purge those off that's why the california and others are saying
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:58.120]  just let illegal aliens vote many cities are letting them vote unbelievable well soph joins us
[02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:05.080]  she's uh on twitter at sur nugget um she's plagiarizing the actual given name of uh
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:11.160]  hillary clinton clearly clinton spirit animals sur nugget and of course youtube at soph
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:17.960]  and patreon.com corbis and she joins us i want to get around for a while this is an update on
[02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:23.800]  being demonized the national media people calling her a right winger i'm more probably kind of a
[02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:28.120]  libertarian provocateur but maybe i'm wrong just to get an update from you and also talk about
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:35.880]  your new video getting into the boomer generation that you think is the real culprit the real problem
[02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:43.800]  here hey alex well thanks for joining us what do you want to tackle first um i could do anything
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:48.120]  really i mean a lot of stuff has been going on lately i mean i got out of school but i had a
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:53.880]  had an eventful um last few days and i i had to talk to my principal about a few things but the
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:59.640]  new videos i uh i worked on that a lot i think it's pretty interesting as well we're gonna get to that
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:03.960]  coming up next segment just describe some of the stuff that happened your dad got threatened your
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:08.760]  family got threatened they tried to dox you uh since you were on a few months ago tell people
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:16.920]  what's unfolded um yeah so i it was an onslaught of articles about me a lot um that were sort of
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:23.320]  painting me in the wrong light taking quotes out of context and saying things i said that i never
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:28.920]  said and um i had journalists harassing my parents you know finding finding information about them
[02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:35.640]  and calling them and emailing them even contacting my grandmother at a point uh some of them were
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:39.400]  really going crazy with that sort of thing and then within the school itself i was getting
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:47.240]  a lot of harassment from my fellow students um i got assaulted technically three times and um
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:53.320]  i also had to speak with my principal and that sort of thing and uh i'm being kept from saying
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:59.560]  things by my superintendent it's a pretty crazy situation you're being kept from saying things
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:06.760]  online by the school or at school uh yeah i mean exactly a week ago i got after you know school is
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:12.040]  out it's already summer vacation and i'm transferring to a different school i uh i had to had a meeting
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:18.200]  with the principal i had this tweet where i said that uh some students who i have no idea who they
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:24.840]  are um who are trying to get a segment of like an interview with me get get try to get it removed
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:31.320]  from the yearbook i said that they are gay babies who are you know farting on the floor about it
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:36.840]  pretty much and uh he had a problem with me calling them gay because apparently that's a slur now
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:42.360]  so i had to talk to him and you know it's unclear about what i can say in my next video about
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:46.760]  everything that happened at school i mean if i can even pass judgment on the kids because in the
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:51.720]  principal's own words there's no code on what speech is disciplinable well we know in california
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:56.520]  under the ninth circuit it's american flags you can't wear in california under the ninth circuit
[02:10:56.520 --> 02:11:02.840]  but but i guess we'll have a new ruling on you though to ban you as well yeah i mean all the
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:07.640]  rules are super unclear it's pretty much if students make a big enough ruckus about you
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:14.040]  you can get punished for it so um i'm just trying to work things out right now how i can move forward
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:18.680]  and how i can talk about what's happened to me without facing negative repercussions for it
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:26.440]  what do you make of the mainstream media the corporate media the dying dinosaur media lying
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:32.280]  even more now i don't know if you're familiar with what's happened lately um ap said that i lost a
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:37.240]  lawsuit for a book about sanny hook that i never wrote the book i was interviewed for the book i
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:43.640]  didn't lose a lawsuit and they went on to say uh all these other incredible lies about me
[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:49.240]  they said that i said white jew boys about the lawyers that are suing me i said they're white
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:55.240]  shoe boys that actually means white anglo-saxon protestant uh ivy lee graduates from yale that's
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:12:02.040]  what they are uh want to be elitist and then they said that i said uh jew boys so so there's a whole
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:10.520]  new level to the weaponization in the media yeah i mean i'm unfamiliar with specific incidents but
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:16.040]  i totally believe that i mean even even people like my parents are starting to wake up with
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:21.400]  with how blatant it was before i went on the show my parents pretty much bought the the
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:26.360]  mainstream story about you because you know they have regular jobs or you know they they do work
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:30.440]  so they don't have time to go out of their way and really research these things and that's what
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:35.160]  big mainstream news sources really count on that the average viewer doesn't have the time
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:39.160]  to look into the story so they can blatantly lie and get away with it just counting on the
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:43.880]  viewer's ignorance so but but after i went on the show they realized that you're you're not crazy
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:49.160]  you're just a normal guy and you know they started even they have started to wake up to
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:52.840]  what's been happening to the mainstream media well i find it fascinating
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:13:02.440]  that howl are you i am 14 so you're 14 and my 15 year old daughter she's 15 now is as smart as
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:07.560]  you are she's just not really politically engaged my son 16 he's he's super smart he's been doing
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:11.640]  videos since he was 10 that he actually did himself people thought that i told him what to say
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:15.960]  that you compare that to a lot of young people today they seem like zombies or most adults
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:23.160]  are so stupid that it frightens me and the iq's plunging in the country it's it's really scary
[02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:30.360]  for me a you agree with that and and and b what do you think's causing it i mean i think i think
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:36.520]  that's consistent at least through millennials when it comes to gen z there's a lot more skepticism i
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:41.480]  think just because they have so many sources just getting used to the internet that they realize
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:48.200]  oh well like newspapers aren't the only source so they might not be credible um and i think the
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:54.360]  studies show that you're right why do you think why do you think then the millennials just literally
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:14:00.680]  seem on average like like lobotomized zombies i think because they just got to the internet later
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:06.040]  on so they they spend so much of their life getting used to these sources that they just have this
[02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:11.240]  unbreakable trust in them i don't know what it would take to really you know expose to them that
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:17.000]  that's that's just not true i think i think you're right but it's more than that there's a subservience
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.720]  and they think they're on the winning team they went and got two or three college degrees that are
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:26.680]  worthless by design and then the system once it catches you in a scam like a nigerian scam they
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:30.840]  get you to give a thousand dollars is you're gonna get a hundred thousand they go prince of booboo needs
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:34.760]  ten thousand now but you're gonna get a million and once you've already invested twenty thousand
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:39.800]  in the scam you're supposed to get ten million from prince booboo or whatever his name is these people
[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:44.840]  will tell their family no you're jealous i'm getting money from prince booboo and then they'll
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:50.840]  have a nigerian fly over here on get on a greyhound bus the seven people i know come to their house
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:56.680]  in a prince outfit but they have no money and they have a one week visa and then families break up
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:03.480]  and people's wives run off their husbands run off going no the prince is here i hit the jackpot
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:07.240]  so it's the same thing and then and then thought they'll sign their house over to them because now
[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:12.120]  the prince is going to give him a billion and they can never admit they got conned so the left keeps
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:16.280]  doubling down betting they're like compulsive gamblers believing they're finally going to be the
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:21.320]  ruling class their degrees are finally going to work once bernie sanders or hillary takes over
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:27.160]  she'll give them places in the whole economy but she says in the wiki leaks of my dumb constituents
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:31.640]  want money in position it doesn't exist they're all a bunch of stupid baristas who want power
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:35.800]  they don't have the intellect the will of the energy you're doing i hate my constituents
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:41.240]  because she knows who they are they've got two degrees on average they've got a meth habit
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:47.080]  they love satan and they're completely unhappy and they see other people that have energy and
[02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:51.320]  lightning in their eyes and they want to kill us and they want to hurt babies too well they're

[02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:38.680]  you know they have
[02:20:42.280 --> 02:20:49.160]  the ink blocks the war shock patterns where you show people something and one person thinks it's
[02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:55.400]  flowers other person thinks it's demons another person thinks it's a unicorn and they can get
[02:20:55.400 --> 02:21:01.720]  a good psychological idea on patterns in people's brains with those and of course people that have
[02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:08.600]  a dirty mind will hear something and think it's about sex when it's not well i saw this video
[02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:14.360]  yesterday that self put out young 14 year old girl who's been on the air for a few years and
[02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:20.920]  has millions of followers and when i was watching it i was thinking well who does the internet
[02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:25.240]  always obsessing about saying runs the whole world either say the jews or the catholics or
[02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:30.760]  they'll pick up i mean i guess the left now says white people are inherently evil and white people
[02:21:30.760 --> 02:21:34.360]  are the bad thing on ours that being whites inherently bad and we shall pay reparations
[02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:38.520]  from watching it and i'm thinking is she gonna say white dudes is she gonna say jews is she gonna
[02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:41.960]  say because i'm trying to i mean i could tell it was something along those lines back oh well
[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:45.960]  david rockefeller's not jewish that guy's not jewish this guy's not jewish i'm thinking oh cares
[02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:51.880]  is she gonna say they're all democrats well some of those are republicans and then she says boomers
[02:21:53.720 --> 02:22:00.680]  and again it's the media watching that would again project jews onto it
[02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:04.680]  because a lot of these powerful CEOs do happen to be jewish some of the leaders
[02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:10.120]  but some are liberal some are conservative but the truth is they're all boomers it's it's it's
[02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:15.240]  it's boomers creating the racial division so it's a very sophisticated video it goes on for a long
[02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:21.240]  time and it's got some profanity in it so we're not going to play all of it here but uh so what
[02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:25.400]  was your thinking and thanks for coming on short notice what was your thinking in doing this because
[02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:30.680]  i didn't talk to you before you came on uh i've kind of made my guess at it that you were it was
[02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:36.680]  like a roar shocker blot ink pattern to to kind of show that the internet's obsessed with this
[02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:40.600]  both liberal and conservative and projecting it onto everybody i mean i've got articles here
[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:45.800]  on instagram investigating alex jones post that has stoked anti-swinnik hate in the comments
[02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:51.880]  and it was a mere one socialist painting about the robber barons and and it did nothing to do with jews
[02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:57.480]  uh a couple of the guys that happen to be jewish that were in it uh and it was four percent of the
[02:22:57.480 --> 02:23:02.040]  comments out of hundreds were anti-jews so now i'm guilty for four percent of comments
[02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:09.080]  so this is a total and complete mind control uh i have that painting hanging in my office but a
[02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:13.640]  better version of me so many versions the version i have doesn't have a famous jew in it uh a few
[02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:18.440]  of them do but but i mean so what there have been famous people that are good and bad that are jewish
[02:23:18.440 --> 02:23:22.520]  i mean you know linem was jewish i'd say that was an evil guy to be jewish hitler was able to be
[02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:26.360]  you know austrian but there's been a lot of great germans you know bismarck you can say was greater
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:30.440]  there's been great englishmen and you know great great people from africa but what was your thinking
[02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:37.480]  behind all this um the the intro segment just happened to fall into place i mean i it was originally
[02:23:37.480 --> 02:23:43.000]  conceived as sort of a just a funny you know bait and switch comedic thing but it happened to
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:49.000]  sort of fit in with the rest of the the narrative which is like well there there needed to be an
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:53.800]  explanation for why the millennial generation is what it is i mean you know it didn't just
[02:23:53.800 --> 02:23:58.280]  pop out of nowhere so you trace it back maybe to the universities but what happened to academia
[02:23:58.280 --> 02:24:02.920]  didn't just happen out of nowhere so and it was happening at around the same time boomers were
[02:24:02.920 --> 02:24:08.200]  there so it just happened to you know fall into place it intuitively made sense well this is
[02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:12.920]  definitely a very original video and i don't know you know people that have degrees and media that
[02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:17.240]  could put out something as is it dark and interesting in the way it was all shot did you do this by
[02:24:17.240 --> 02:24:25.000]  yourself uh yeah i did it well technically i set up everything by myself but uh i i have a friend
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:30.600]  that i work on these videos with he's a vapor a boy on youtube and we're just friends but we
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:34.600]  you know bounce ideas off of each other and and he'll add a few things to the scripts here and
[02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:39.640]  there and we'll do you know recordings together uh but you know my parents aren't you know helping
[02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:47.160]  me set up anything you're 14 years old how's your friend that helps you uh 17 okay well let's go ahead
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:58.120]  and roll the first part of this video here it is i thought you were all fools the idea of tracing
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:04.840]  all our troubles back to a single group of people i just couldn't believe it scapegoating like that
[02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:13.160]  seemed too easy too simplistic but it pains me to say it was right it's almost like i didn't want to
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:19.720]  believe once you start seeing it you just can't stop they're everywhere the banks the media the
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:28.600]  government the federal reserve my neighborhood it doesn't take a genius to pick up on it notice
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:39.800]  anything i know you do you can't ignore the patterns the ratty face the air the nose who else could
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:47.720]  it be rather than greedy slimy money loving boomers the list of things more insufferable than
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:52.120]  dealing with boomers is a very short one it says if they have a sixth sense that allows them to
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:56.520]  strike when you're the most irritable and like a type of noise pokemon they have a characteristic
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:26:01.880]  move they love to use complaining about your use of the internet in a handful of phrases they managed
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:06.440]  to squeeze out a copious amount of superstitious gobbledygook about how much time you spent on
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:11.400]  the computer all while obnoxiously rooming over your shoulder to watch you download skyrim mods and
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:16.440]  doom wads and when their lecture is done they slither back downstairs to watch whatever mkl
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:21.400]  for programming is beaming out of their 60 inch led tv's which only makes their objections to our
[02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:26.520]  consumption of media funnier considering their happy being fed an infinite course of a politically
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:31.320]  charged and geriatric version of teletubbies and they have the gall to go bug their kids for watching
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:36.760]  tiktok compilations in their minds because their source of entertainment is under the auspices of
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:42.520]  the establishment it simply can't be wrong regardless of how trivial diversionary inconsistently
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:47.640]  untrustworthy it may be meanwhile we can access every single morsel of information known to man
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:52.200]  through the web but there are no flashy credit card ads lodged in it which basically means it
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:57.080]  can't be reliable it's almost poetic how the big screen the boomer sits in front of gives so little
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:01.640]  in the way of anything while the little screens they so despise are a window to the endless
[02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:06.600]  expanses of the internet and perhaps that's what truly annoys them the lack of main guidelines
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:11.880]  the all too open nature of the internet and all the esoteric info it offers without any filters
[02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:17.000]  the skepticism it symbolizes must really grind the gears of people whose main interest is just
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:22.360]  to not bother anymore the boomers mo is blissful ignorance the prospect of questioning the current
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:27.480]  authority is a foreign one to them true patriots don't question the government and alternatively
[02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:32.760]  true democrats don't peddle preposterous conspiracy theories boomers are perpetually tangled in the
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:38.520]  minutia of the euclidean political spectrum never able to see a bigger picture or realize how much
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:45.400]  trouble again the video is is is very interesting she's targeting boomers but she's playing on the
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:50.360]  whole bait and switch thinking that the media will project and think that it's anti-semitic
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:53.800]  and that's what i got from it that's what i thought because i know you don't engage in that type of
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:58.120]  you know religious or racial division i've just one i've seen your past videos but i wanted to
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:03.480]  give you a chance to just clarify what your video that people can see on your youtube channel stands
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:10.200]  for and again the group responsible for all of our troubles so other points you'd like to add
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:17.160]  about the video um i just think it's one of the the the points i sort of go in on there is the
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:23.000]  the trend among boomers that they're so caught up in the political you know conflict always always
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:29.800]  caught up in the you know democratic i guess uh landscape to me it seems the solution is no longer
[02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:33.640]  a political option it cannot be achieved through political means so i think it's
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:37.640]  you know something pointless for them to be so focused on that and i also think with the
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:41.560]  the millennials thing they have stockholm syndrome for the boomers in that way they've
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:46.680]  already invested so much uh just with with college that they think they still have to
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:51.480]  you know focus on all those values let's talk about what's wrong with the boomers with sof and

[02:32:08.120 --> 02:32:11.960]  marked up stuff we're making like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving
[02:32:11.960 --> 02:32:16.760]  a ton of it okay but you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get 20 000
[02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:20.440]  dollars that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to
[02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:25.400]  sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product i want to expand not contract and for
[02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:29.880]  six months we've not just made a standstill the enemy's been winning and i have labored and labored
[02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:34.200]  and labored and labored on this i like to be expanding i like to be winning i like to be fighting
[02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:38.680]  and we are winning the info war that's why we're so hated but we need to be retreaded we need to be
[02:32:38.680 --> 02:32:42.760]  tuned up we need to be fixed up we never have time to get into drive up we got a lot of holes shot at
[02:32:42.760 --> 02:32:48.200]  us and the enemy wants to silence us then they're really going to plant child porn on us then they're
[02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:52.360]  going to kill me or you or anybody else i mean the democrats now we're going into a full revolutionary
[02:32:52.360 --> 02:32:55.960]  fervor funded by foreign banks of the chicom show go to mfullworkstore.com
[02:32:59.560 --> 02:33:08.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:08.280 --> 02:33:22.680]  live from austin texas broadcasting
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:31.720]  is 14 she's been on the internet for a couple years she has millions of followers her average
[02:33:31.720 --> 02:33:36.280]  video is about a half million views and that's what the shadow band she's under well she talked about
[02:33:36.280 --> 02:33:43.640]  Greta Thunberg and got so many strikes on her youtube it was frozen because it's bullying if you
[02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:48.360]  talk about a 16 year old climate activist that means pay the Rockefellers pay obama pay the
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:53.080]  globalist carbon taxes literally at the chicago and London mercantile that's like when i was
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:58.520]  criticizing david hogg last year when he was literally saying i was a horrible person a criminal
[02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:03.800]  and i would criticize him when he was giving speeches to 10 000 people and they would they
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:09.320]  banned me they said you do not talk about david hogg who's 17 years old and so i was asking why
[02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:13.880]  no video is for two months well she's been locked out of her account uh for two months because i
[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:18.680]  guess she talked about Greta Thunberg uh tell us about that so you're 14 but you don't get to have
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:23.800]  your opinion i guess you said something mean about her um i didn't really say anything mean i mean
[02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:30.360]  the the worst thing i said was she had a square head but i said like fellow square head and youtube
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:35.480]  just classified it as harassment and cyberbullying even though she's way more famous and you know
[02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:39.960]  two years older than i am and i tried to appeal the strike but they still haven't gotten back to
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:45.240]  me on it i guess that's a tactic they use they just don't respond to your appeals i mean i just i
[02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:53.560]  just think it's insane well antifa was caught on video uh loading hundreds of uh acid bombs that
[02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:59.720]  they threw at people and beat people over the head with the steel bars splitting their skulls open
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:04.520]  but that's okay but if you disagree with someone saying the world's ending in 12 years like aoc
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:09.720]  or Greta Thunberg you're the bad person how dare you a 14 year old young woman uh criticize one
[02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:15.560]  of their lord and saviors i know it's just crazy i think yeah she's like one of their protected
[02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:20.200]  people because i think she's very affected at uh getting the message across to young people
[02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:26.040]  and that's what i commented on i mean um i think she's you know just being used as a tool to push
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:31.560]  the message of oh yeah the government's just trying to collect more taxes it's just a effort for you
[02:35:31.560 --> 02:35:37.160]  know the whole climate change thing is probably just exaggerated um by you know government employed
[02:35:37.160 --> 02:35:44.120]  scientists to collect more taxes through a carbon tax or whatever Greta Thunberg the world's ending
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:50.520]  please pay all the money to aoc or i'm dead and don't criticize that plan even though only a few
[02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:55.480]  countries have to do it and then we won't be able to economically operate against china and china
[02:35:55.480 --> 02:36:00.440]  and Saudi Arabia have been actually funding us to shut down our energy so we can only buy from them
[02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:10.120]  but that's okay i'm Greta Thunberg wow i mean well i mean it's uh well she's very articulate and
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:14.120]  then that's probably the main reason they've been striking her the if she was not articulate and she
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:19.240]  wasn't effective and she wasn't savvy at technology she wouldn't be targeted in this manner the the
[02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:23.480]  idea is that essentially there's a safe space for only protected ideas and protected classes
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:28.120]  and everyone else is subject to harassment to targeting to censorship to physical assault
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:33.240]  has happened this weekend uh it's a sad situation and google calls that internal documents project
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:41.480]  veritas video fairness that it's fair to suppress you so yeah um it's the i've i've been keen to the
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:47.160]  whole you know um google bias for like a year and a half now so i'm i'm not surprised with any of this
[02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:52.040]  project veritas stuff that's coming out i think it's just you know to be expected because it's so
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:57.640]  clear the bias that they put out on people like me while they just propel Greta Thunberg to the top
[02:36:57.640 --> 02:37:03.960]  of everything to top of you know recommended videos or whatever else it's amazing let's talk about
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:08.680]  millennials let's talk about because we're not saying all millennials are bad but statistically
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:13.080]  they steal more they don't give to charity but they tell you how to live your life more than half
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:17.960]  of them identify as communist with their smartphones and two hundred dollar skinny jeans and two hundred
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:24.040]  dollar sunglasses uh what's wrong in your view robert barnes i mean even the atlantic says the
[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:31.880]  boomers ruined everything they gave birth to the millennials maybe generation z will save us well
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:37.240]  i mean i think what happened is uh there's good articulation of this by various uh sociological
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:41.640]  sociology professors and other political science professors sociological is a hard word to say
[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:45.800]  exactly that that's what i'm trying to get to the uh but essentially what what happened was this safe
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:51.080]  space culture was impregnated into the boomer class as they were raising their kids because of the
[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:56.600]  kidnapping scares and the various child care scares that took place in the late 80s early 90s so they
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:38:01.240]  were so don't go out and and make the whole world has become a little and google's even building
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:06.920]  and so facebook little ai spy cities where you live in a done bubble exactly and you have these
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:11.480]  special safe spaces on top of other safe spaces on top of other safe spaces and they've grown up in a
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:16.600]  safe space culture that mingled with that self entitlement culture and you combine safe space
[02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:20.840]  culture and self entitlement culture and you get people who really believe without any question
[02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:25.720]  without any doubt without any reservation that they are entitled to only their voice being heard
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:29.880]  they're entitled to nobody they're the ruling class exactly very much so and that the safe
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:33.560]  space culture that they grew up with his kids with you know play dates that everything was
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:37.800]  controlled and organized it's sort of a mini version of the nanny state is how they grew up
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:42.680]  and were cultivated by their boomer liberal parents whereas my generation was the last to just
[02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:48.440]  oh you're 10 years old you want to take the shotgun i'd put a 357 on my side with with a holster
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:53.880]  and i'd get a tent a couple of my buddies and i'd i'd go out on a four-wheeler a thousand you know
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:59.640]  acres in the middle of a wilderness and just sit there and hunt and hang out two or three days
[02:38:59.640 --> 02:39:03.960]  exactly people think that's like now leftist outside major cities they're moving in like
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:08.040]  outside of land outside other areas that there's always news of this and they'll people drive by
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:12.760]  somebody's house and they'll be skinning a deer they'll call the police for animal cruelty and
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:17.400]  the cops will arrest them even though it's legal they had a license they go we still think that
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:22.680]  someone called from the nanny state yes skinning a deer is hurtful well it's it's amazing i mean i
[02:39:22.680 --> 02:39:28.120]  do think generation generation z has a lot of promise they're much more independent of they
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:32.760]  there tends to be a generational reaction to the prior generation and the generation z is sort of
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:37.320]  the anti-save space culture in place very independent understand how to reach out to each other
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:41.800]  through social media understand how to persuade and communicate through social media understand
[02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:47.000]  how to express dissident opinions and be unafraid of big tech and unafraid of big media and unafraid
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:51.480]  of having quote-unquote unapproved opinions and i think they are the generation that's going to
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:56.120]  salvage and save the american future moving forward i totally agree but you bring that up i mean
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:40:00.440]  literally when my dad was like nine ten they would send him every summer to apprentice a month here
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:05.560]  a month there in a factory at an oil rig to go to go pick cotton somewhere with family to see
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:09.400]  what the real world was like but they just throw him on a bus and he'd just go drive down there and
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:13.080]  they'd take guns to their school put him in the locker to go hunt at their friend's house and
[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:21.640]  literally i remember being a kid just just just just 33 34 years ago 35 years ago being 10 11
[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:25.880]  and nobody thought anything in the country if you were walking by a fence somebody's out there cutting
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:30.760]  stuff with a tractor that there's much little kids with 357s on their hips and shotguns that's
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:34.440]  that was totally because we were all trained it was normal nobody got hurt nowadays people flip
[02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:40.200]  out of they see an adult like that so what do you think's happened um i mean i didn't even consider
[02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:45.160]  all the safe space stuff but i think it's just the contrast of the way that uh boomers were raised
[02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:51.640]  versus generation z that's something i focus on um boomers grew up in a age of great prosperity so
[02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:56.440]  they got you know most everything was pretty much handed to them is what i focus on and i think
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:01.640]  growing up in such an environment they didn't they didn't need to learn what you know how to
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:07.480]  defend themselves or or or you know need to learn any you know good life advice financial advice
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:12.440]  because no matter what they did they got success and uh they just say assimilate do what the
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:17.240]  establishment says they're in a cult yeah well pretty the upper middle class liberal boomers
[02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:22.360]  that she's describing so for like your blue collar working class boomer what they experienced and
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:27.080]  this is you see this in the division of trump support amongst boomer generation uh the it's
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:31.800]  your non-college folks who saw their entire livelihoods ripped away and disappeared they had
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:36.280]  to serve in multiple wars that were failed wars that were dumb wars they were unsuccessful wars
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:39.560]  they were unpopular wars that killed their friends their family and their neighbors
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:43.640]  they had to grow out go go home to communities that were being ripped apart by racial politics
[02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:49.880]  by their their homes ripped apart by gender politics you're right we've got to divide the the working
[02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:54.360]  class boomers for a great people versus elite boomers we say boomers we mean elite exactly
[02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:59.560]  generally white upper class boomers privileged kids who grew up so privileged that entitlement
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:04.680]  was second nature to them no sense of scarcity one critical principle of conservatism and sort of
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:08.840]  its hardcore root is a recognition of scarcity there was no recognition of scarcity because
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:12.680]  they were just used to AOC says they go how are you going to pay for all this it's five times the
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:18.120]  budget she goes we'll just do it exactly the there must be the military must spend a whole bunch
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:22.440]  right so i mean it's just uh there's people that don't have any sense of limits don't have any sense
[02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:28.440]  of know what it's like to live with limits people if that it's a self-entitled babied culture that
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:32.760]  easily bullies others because of how easily they were babied their whole i agree so few more minutes
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:36.440]  with us and we're going to get into the other issues with barns a little bit the next hour

[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:04.040]  square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:08.440]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:12.760]  billionaire that's not being funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:18.520]  of all that it is an old-school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom
[02:44:18.520 --> 02:44:22.760]  of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning
[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:27.720]  of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this
[02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:31.160]  was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:35.320]  mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:40.520]  control and manipulate what news and views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and
[02:44:40.520 --> 02:44:45.320]  the info wars audience has broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:49.960]  to the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:58.280]  onslaught of the black warming defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth i talk about this on
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:02.440]  the air and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all
[02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:06.440]  our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship of attacks
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:10.200]  and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products are and how they were
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:14.040]  the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:18.120]  and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down
[02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:20.920]  the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:25.640]  wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:31.720]  supplements and he claims or supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:35.880]  that a supplement has been through the fda because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:40.440]  then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to
[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:44.280]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:48.680]  great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[02:45:48.680 --> 02:45:55.320]  god's medicine chest info or store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:46:01.080]  we'll be very very clear with everybody about all of this we're going into the season of war
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:05.320]  and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have do their criminal
[02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:10.120]  activity and their and their digital fraud and we need to know that we've got capital to go six
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:14.920]  months a year we need to in here we need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:19.400]  that i am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly i'm loving every minute of this
[02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:24.280]  because i know i'm getting under their skin i'm bloody and then i'm up politically i'm banging
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:28.920]  ads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies that just brings more people here so i'm
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:34.840]  in one hell of a fight so are you and i need war bonds i need gas i need ammo politically now but
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:39.000]  literally if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:42.760]  us with your word of mouth you're unstoppable we're unstoppable together i want to send a strong
[02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:46.600]  message to the enemy i want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:50.760]  that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and i will never back down you have
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:54.920]  my commitment this only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that
[02:46:54.920 --> 02:47:01.720]  we were right about this you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:07.720]  go
[02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:21.720]  ladies and gentlemen we're broadcasting worldwide from deep in the heart of the atx

[02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:40.600]  that is so critical they are probing they are testing us to normalize attacking us they call

[02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:22.360]  x2 the clean deep earth crystal pure iodine the the soil is depleted the types of iodine as you
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:28.600]  get are bound with other substances other minerals other other periodic table elements
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:36.440]  and you can't absorb it if you don't know about iodine and loss of iq and loss of energy and
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:41.080]  problems in the glands well you just don't know when i remember to take x2 four five times a week
[02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:49.400]  i have so much energy so much focus so much everything for taking it seven years ago and i
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:54.040]  was exercising all the time and couldn't drop weight i lost 50 something pounds now i basically
[02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:57.400]  have quit working out except for some elliptical so i've gained 30 of it back i'm just going back
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:01.560]  on a regimen again i'm taking all the vitamins all the minerals and i'm exercising i've already lost
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:05.720]  five pounds last week and a half and you know you're gonna see quite a transformation the next
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:10.680]  two months folks you're gonna see because i'm i'm gonna work out like i used to before i took x2
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:16.760]  the stuff has made me lazy but you take the x2 you take the fish oil you take the turmeric you take
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:24.600]  the ultimate bone broth formula they're all 50% off double patria point store for shipping i want
[02:49:24.600 --> 02:49:28.040]  to explain something everybody knows how great bone broth is you go to Whole Foods you go to
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:33.080]  other grocery stores they've got little mason jars for ten dollars or it's on sale eight bucks
[02:49:33.080 --> 02:49:37.400]  it's got the equivalent of a quarter scoop of bone broth from chicken in it and chaga mushroom and
[02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:41.800]  bee pollen and stuff that keep me to go to the store and get some of these come show you there's
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:49.800]  almost nothing in them you're talking hundreds of times more in a canister for 1995 and this is
[02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:56.280]  995 for one little mason jar that's just yellow it just has the bone broth flavor nobody's ever
[02:49:56.280 --> 02:49:59.800]  made a bone broth like this if you don't know what bone broth does for you research it i don't have
[02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:07.240]  hours to get into it all of it's 50 off info or store.com we're selling out of the x2 and we
[02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:12.600]  they put us over a barrel they get it between seven and 12,000 feet the oil company we're getting
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:17.960]  it from it's just pure crystal source it goes to the DEA to even store it before it's transferred
[02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:21.960]  into the process that makes it where you can take it because it's a controlled substance at that level
[02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:26.200]  because you can make all the stuff with it it's a it's a magic element okay they hit you with
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:30.840]  all the bad halogens like fluoride and the rest of this is the good halogen it took us over six
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:35.320]  months to get it re-secured i played guts ball i said it's discontinued i wouldn't let them raise
[02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:39.720]  the prices on us because they're gonna be like $50 a bottle they're gonna double prices on it for us
[02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:47.560]  so right now it's 1998 even though ladies and gentlemen we only make like five six bucks on it
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:54.760]  at that and maybe that so 4.9 stars 98 percent reviews original x2 at m4slife.com x3 is excellent
[02:50:54.760 --> 02:50:59.560]  it's triiodine the other two types and then the pure type because some people can't absorb just the
[02:50:59.560 --> 02:51:04.680]  pure type most folks can't absorb the bound types so i x3 was with doctors and scientists told me
[02:51:04.680 --> 02:51:08.680]  was great folks when i tell you x2 has been the best they don't want x3 to go well x2 is the
[02:51:08.680 --> 02:51:12.760]  best it's kind of like when Gillette had the best a man can get with three razors and then i don't
[02:51:12.760 --> 02:51:16.360]  kind of agree four or five is a little too much people are like hey it's the best a man can get
[02:51:16.360 --> 02:51:21.640]  don't tell me you have four blades okay fine some like three some like four some like two x3 is
[02:51:21.640 --> 02:51:28.040]  excellent as well it's not sold out uh so m4slife.com show for two old guys you know running over a
[02:51:28.040 --> 02:51:33.160]  14 year old lady here so but i really want to hear what you have to say any other key points you'd
[02:51:33.160 --> 02:51:37.480]  like to make about where you see society going the the massive censorship what you think Trump should
[02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:46.280]  do antifogist north of you uh openly producing uh you know all of these uh acid attack cocktails to
[02:51:46.280 --> 02:51:51.080]  attack people i mean it's big news when islamistus throws acid on somebody but when the liberals
[02:51:51.080 --> 02:51:56.600]  do it it's loving and we have a CNN clip saying this is a good thing i mean yeah everything
[02:51:56.600 --> 02:52:01.960]  seems to be accelerating just leading up to the election i mean all the antifa stuff is crazy
[02:52:01.960 --> 02:52:07.640]  um they're certainly doing a lot of damage but i think uh i don't think they're something that
[02:52:07.640 --> 02:52:12.200]  people should be scared of i mean it's you you see the videos it's like a whole crowd
[02:52:12.200 --> 02:52:16.600]  against one person and the one person is still able to get away proportional to the size they
[02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:21.960]  can't do much damage they're weak so if you know people can can meet back with a greater force
[02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:27.400]  which i think is easier than you know things will be good um yeah i mean we can talk more about
[02:52:27.400 --> 02:52:34.200]  boomers if you want well again i'm not up here as mr tough guy i've had my ass kick plenty of times
[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:38.200]  and i never started to fight and i got in fights with people like state wrestling champs and folks
[02:52:38.200 --> 02:52:41.480]  that have your head in the concrete in 10 seconds didn't matter what you did you couldn't kick their
[02:52:41.480 --> 02:52:46.440]  ass but i've certainly you know won most of the fights i've been in but i can tell you this if
[02:52:46.440 --> 02:52:51.240]  somebody tried to hit me in the head with the metal club they're gonna die i mean i or i'm gonna die
[02:52:51.240 --> 02:52:54.600]  because i'm gonna get on top of them and i'm gonna ram your head in the concrete and by the way
[02:52:54.600 --> 02:52:59.320]  that's not premeditated you try to kill me or you hurt me that's when you really get hurt
[02:52:59.320 --> 02:53:02.760]  because the state wrestling champion i said i didn't beat him actually did break his tricky
[02:53:02.760 --> 02:53:07.720]  head i've crushed his win pipe he had to get tracheotomy in the hospital but so i guess i did
[02:53:07.720 --> 02:53:13.880]  kind of win but the point is he had he had he had pal drive me and thought he kicked my ass and i
[02:53:13.880 --> 02:53:17.480]  popped right back up punched him in throat full power but all i'm saying is there's always somebody
[02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:22.280]  tougher than you out there but why do you think so if they think they can go out and engage in
[02:53:22.280 --> 02:53:28.680]  acid attacks and hit people over the head with metal bars um i think they know that the establishment
[02:53:28.680 --> 02:53:33.640]  is on their side i mean something that the the leftist like carlos maza often says that oh the
[02:53:33.640 --> 02:53:38.840]  establishment is right wing you know big corporate big corporations like youtube are anti gay they're
[02:53:38.840 --> 02:53:44.760]  never on our side which is completely just opposite of the truth uh you know everybody's working
[02:53:44.760 --> 02:53:49.880]  together with the left wing they so they know they have uh they're not stupid they just have
[02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:54.040]  overconfidence in the fact that the system is on their side i don't know if that's how it's
[02:53:54.040 --> 02:53:59.160]  going to work out but it seems that the police really aren't doing much to stop them and i think
[02:53:59.160 --> 02:54:04.360]  this is why the right to bear arms is so important in situations like these where the police doesn't
[02:54:04.360 --> 02:54:10.920]  have a handle on it you need to be able to defend yourself i know your dad's had threats you've had
[02:54:10.920 --> 02:54:16.360]  threats online has anybody recognized you on the street and said anything to you um so far i mean
[02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:21.160]  i haven't uh been recognized on the street in a while i've been i've i've been recognized a few
[02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:26.600]  times before but it was always positive um so far i haven't been harassed you know out of school
[02:54:26.600 --> 02:54:34.280]  just in public but we'll see how long that lasts barns you've been out in public with me we're not
[02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:41.320]  bragging it it's good news what you probably 90 percent of folks that come up are positive others
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:46.680]  are kind of neutral maybe i don't think you've ever seen about it get my face yet i went and dropped
[02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:51.560]  my daughters off at camp i i couldn't get out of there i shook almost all the girls hands all the
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:57.720]  guys hands they all chase me i'm not kidding chase me where my truck was parked it's a huge camp
[02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:02.840]  and we're demanding photos and more kept coming i got stuck there for an hour taking photos with
[02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:07.720]  up to 30 people who just kept somebody chased me in a truck to take photos once i got on the highway
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:13.720]  i'm not bragging that shows we're winning the info war but that minority is violent oh no doubt and
[02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:18.920]  the goal of antifa is to scare the soaps of the world from into silence that's really the goal
[02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:23.240]  the goal is if you get out there and you're going to be a high-profile person with views that we don't
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:28.200]  like it will escalate from it will start with censorship it was that then it will uh go to
[02:55:28.200 --> 02:55:33.800]  sort of cyber stalking true cyber bullying and then it will escalate into actual physical bullying
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:38.680]  and actual physical threats and physical violence am i wrong self in saying that type of behavior
[02:55:38.680 --> 02:55:45.000]  only would make you fight harder i mean i yeah i definitely um i don't know if it's a good thing
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  but it definitely like it excites me in a sort of way that i i feel like i need to get involved
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:55.960]  in what's going on it's just you know seems like there's so much civil unrest that i need to be
[02:55:55.960 --> 02:56:00.920]  in the middle of it and get involved and yeah like people seeing things like this will alienate
[02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:05.560]  them from the left that's all it does it makes them you know angry or it's it gets them more revved
[02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:10.600]  up and ready to fight and it's only going to just you know accelerate things and make more people
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:16.840]  ready to invite to fight antifa well that's that's not what i think and i agree with self i mean
[02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:22.440]  this is exciting the the threats to our freedoms and then threatening to attack us that doesn't
[02:56:22.440 --> 02:56:26.040]  make me want to stay away it makes me want to go there yeah well the spirit of americana and the
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:33.800]  spirit of america it cannot be put out by a bunch of sort of uh black block style of vigilantes who
[02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:39.240]  are basically just trying to be the sort of lefty brown shirts of the modern age by the way let's
[02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:43.640]  be clear even the daily beast is now reporting when i told you first hour the epi eyes warning of
[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:48.360]  terror attacks in dc by antifa the epi eyes now calling them a terror group because when you're
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:54.600]  cooking acid bombs by the hundreds and hitting people helping a gay dude they attacked a gay guy
[02:56:54.600 --> 02:57:00.200]  in a sundress and antifa was attacking when you're doing that you're a terrorist look at that homeland
[02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:06.440]  security warrant of antifa terrorist attacks so what do you make of that i mean i'm i'm glad that
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:12.680]  there's actually being a resistance to it that um they're they're they're at least trying or seemingly
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:18.360]  trying to take care of it uh and you know hopefully that's hopefully that's effective but i think most
[02:57:18.360 --> 02:57:25.640]  of the uh fights are going to be taking place between citizens themselves well i know this anybody
[02:57:25.640 --> 02:57:31.400]  does anything to my family i'm not going to go after antifa i'm going to go after their bosses
[02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:39.080]  so everybody should in their target menu or attack profile be doing that research for
[02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:44.040]  defensive counterattacks antifa is not the target their controllers are
[02:57:44.040 --> 02:57:52.440]  i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here
[02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:57.240]  out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:58:01.800]  i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know
[02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:06.120]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching
[02:58:06.120 --> 02:58:10.360]  2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only
[02:58:10.360 --> 02:58:14.120]  way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend
[02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:17.800]  i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you
[02:58:17.800 --> 02:58:23.160]  down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old
[02:58:23.160 --> 02:58:27.480]  i'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've
[02:58:27.480 --> 02:58:33.000]  gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:37.240]  others who are gonna continue we're gonna keep fighting in the input war and even if something
[02:58:37.240 --> 02:58:42.360]  does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for

[03:00:24.280 --> 03:00:30.120]  welcome back i'm alex shows your host of all the insane videos you've got to go to info wars
[03:00:30.120 --> 03:00:37.400]  dot com watch american rapper crew we're all with islamic invaders in sweden just with migrants in
[03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:44.360]  sweden it's up on news wars dot com but there's 20 minutes of this footage they're doing a rap
[03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:49.080]  show there they're at a hotel in a restaurant these guys hit their main security guards like
[03:00:49.080 --> 03:00:54.360]  a 300 pound big black guy in the head with their headphones bloody his head and he doesn't want to
[03:00:54.360 --> 03:00:59.400]  go to jail he's like hey stop stop these little 120 pound guys keep falling around you go why are
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:06.520]  they doing this because europeans all bow down to them so you've got this rap crew four five six
[03:01:06.520 --> 03:01:12.440]  guys you can see three of four of them on tape others are behind the camera and they keep harassing
[03:01:12.440 --> 03:01:17.480]  them and they say go away leave us alone they finally get their ass kicked these are probably
[03:01:17.480 --> 03:01:22.760]  like 16 year old little thugs doing it why would they feel so invincible why would they be like
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:28.840]  little banny roosters why would they be grabbing women's asses for no reason because everyone
[03:01:28.840 --> 03:01:33.720]  bows to them like cappernick saying he hates the american flag so i want to get this rap
[03:01:33.720 --> 03:01:38.920]  group on i'm told they're pro trump so watch this and tv viewers can see this you can go full screen
[03:01:39.880 --> 03:01:43.720]  and they just keep hitting them they keep saying leave us alone they walk away they hit them more
[03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:51.160]  and finally they get their ass kicked you talk about total delusional but all they've been doing
[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:57.640]  is beating europeans up constantly with them groveling and they run into americans
[03:01:58.280 --> 03:02:02.360]  who aren't going to put up with it and i even there weren't black guys they were you know guys from
[03:02:02.360 --> 03:02:07.080]  you know who were corn farmers from Nebraska they you know they would probably attack them
[03:02:07.080 --> 03:02:13.960]  quicker i can't believe how how these black rap group puts up with this crap so long american rapper
[03:02:15.560 --> 03:02:21.800]  a money son ap rocky and his crew work in front of by two migrants these are literal invaders
[03:02:21.800 --> 03:02:27.640]  arrogant full of hate in sweden who they fought later according to videos posted to media and
[03:02:27.640 --> 03:02:33.080]  and reported these guys got put in ambulances but for 20 minutes richard reeves guys that maybe
[03:02:33.080 --> 03:02:38.200]  weigh 120 pounds are messing with the other black guys are probably 200 pounds one guy's like 300
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:44.440]  pounds and uh i i mean what what if it's a bunch of big white guys or whoever the but why would
[03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:48.520]  they do that because they're entitled and they're used to it richard well they are they know they're
[03:02:48.520 --> 03:02:52.360]  a protected class and they think they can get away with anything so they're just super arrogant
[03:02:52.360 --> 03:02:58.040]  and it's just amazing i mean think of if that were in the united states and if those were uh
[03:02:58.040 --> 03:03:02.360]  patriot white guys of course if they're anti-file white guys they can attack black guys no problem
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:06.920]  there's not going to be any kind of issue but if they were patriot info warrior white guys
[03:03:06.920 --> 03:03:11.640]  attacking big black guys man we'd never hear the end of it they'd just be all over it would be
[03:03:11.640 --> 03:03:17.480]  all over us so uh it's just amazing the arrogance that they've come to like we look at this photo
[03:03:17.480 --> 03:03:23.080]  this guy's maybe 16 17 maybe 130 pounds and because it goes off like 20 minutes we can't play it all
[03:03:23.080 --> 03:03:29.240]  here they're hitting the big the big 300 pound bodyguard and he's like stop and they hit him
[03:03:29.240 --> 03:03:34.840]  again they hit him over and over again and i can't believe they got and finally they just literally
[03:03:35.560 --> 03:03:40.680]  finally the bodyguard doesn't do anything the regular rap guys literally do judo moves throw
[03:03:40.680 --> 03:03:44.760]  the guys in the ground and then stomp the hell out of them well and ultimately it's a great thing
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:50.280]  they had all these uh video shots of it and witnesses etc because had that not happened they
[03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:54.600]  they would have been run so the bodyguards obviously got a license he's trained he knows
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:03:59.000]  he he hurts these guys they can still sue him so it's finally the rappers that beat their asses
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:03.480]  right and they could be in the situation tommy robinson has been in with being railroaded
[03:04:03.480 --> 03:04:07.640]  had it not been for all the witnesses and video shots so thank god for that and uh
[03:04:07.640 --> 03:04:12.200]  and thank god that they were able to handle the situations well i agree but the psychology of
[03:04:12.200 --> 03:04:17.400]  you weigh 130 pounds and you're punching a 300 pound black did the face for the reason
[03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:23.480]  just because they the the the local news it meant yeah they try to tell them you can't be here
[03:04:23.480 --> 03:04:28.360]  you're not from here right and then they tried to beat them up i mean well and that's how
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:31.960]  emboldened they are though because they think that they've got the powers to be in the system behind
[03:04:31.960 --> 03:04:36.680]  it's like i'll have some 130 pound little lepas come up and throw tea in my face that hadn't been
[03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:41.880]  caught on tape coffee has and they they they go come on let's fight like i'm like are you joking
[03:04:41.880 --> 03:04:46.120]  i'm gonna grab their head and just slam it through a wall my emergency message to trump
[03:04:46.120 --> 03:04:50.200]  get into the four winds is coming up we're gonna post it to info wars dot com then mike
[03:04:50.200 --> 03:04:57.720]  adams is coming up thanks richard rave's great job thank you info wars the most banned network in
[03:04:57.720 --> 03:05:03.560]  the world so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling self-supporting structure that is promoting
[03:05:03.560 --> 03:05:08.440]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[03:05:08.440 --> 03:05:13.880]  one another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach
[03:05:13.880 --> 03:05:18.600]  it is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining
[03:05:18.600 --> 03:05:23.560]  self-structured little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content
[03:05:23.560 --> 03:05:27.560]  goes up the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and
[03:05:27.560 --> 03:05:31.320]  supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether
[03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:35.160]  it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want
[03:05:35.160 --> 03:05:39.720]  that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same
[03:05:39.720 --> 03:05:45.000]  time support press support speech support letting the audience choose what news they want to see
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:49.080]  and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate american democratic expression and
[03:05:49.080 --> 03:06:08.440]  experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[03:06:08.440 --> 03:06:13.320]  president trump has signaled to the world that he's preparing to take action against big tech
[03:06:13.320 --> 03:06:20.520]  censorship he's announced a july 11th 2019 anti censorship social media conference to be held
[03:06:20.520 --> 03:06:26.760]  at the white house on the agenda will be ways to tackle big tech censorship and strike back
[03:06:26.760 --> 03:06:33.080]  the president is also keen on promoting new independent anti censorship platforms like
[03:06:33.080 --> 03:06:38.120]  parlor and gab our sources tell us and president trump has confirmed in public statements that
[03:06:38.120 --> 03:06:43.800]  he's also preparing to take anti trust action against big tech combines and cartels that have
[03:06:43.800 --> 03:06:49.880]  formed a monopoly over information and are meddling in the 2020 election thanks to project veritas
[03:06:49.880 --> 03:06:55.400]  we have even more proof from their own mouths that google is actively already meddling in the
[03:06:55.400 --> 03:07:01.960]  2020 election and plans to deliver it to the democrats info wars analysis shows the most
[03:07:01.960 --> 03:07:07.240]  effective way for president trump to take legal and lawful action against big tech tyranny
[03:07:07.240 --> 03:07:13.000]  and manipulation of the upcoming election is to simply declare that all critical infrastructure
[03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:20.680]  federal employees including the arm services not be allowed to visit twitter facebook youtube
[03:07:20.680 --> 03:07:27.880]  google apple and other platforms that are openly like huawei working with the chi comps this will
[03:07:27.880 --> 03:07:33.640]  bring the tyrants to their knees similar executive orders similar to the president's order on
[03:07:33.640 --> 03:07:39.880]  colleges banning free speech should also be implemented that federal funds on projects and
[03:07:39.880 --> 03:07:47.000]  contracts will be denied including advertising to the big four tech giants until they stop meddling
[03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:52.280]  in us elections and now a word for myself alex jones the constitutional lawyer robert barnes on
[03:07:52.280 --> 03:08:01.560]  why you president trump must act now president trump alex jones here with an emergency briefing
[03:08:01.560 --> 03:08:07.800]  and as you know in the past four years i've given you briefings over the phone but also directly
[03:08:07.800 --> 03:08:12.520]  via the internet that have turned out to be critically accurate because we're here on the
[03:08:12.520 --> 03:08:17.400]  ground giving you intel that you may not be getting in washington and constitutional lawyer robert
[03:08:17.400 --> 03:08:21.800]  barnes is here with me as well he's had his ear to the ground he's been studying this and he's been
[03:08:21.800 --> 03:08:27.240]  at the heart of some of the major cases against big tech censorship now i know you're planning
[03:08:27.240 --> 03:08:33.320]  to rein in big tech and they're out of control behavior especially after the conclusive project
[03:08:33.320 --> 03:08:38.680]  veritas video that came out two weeks ago but president trump atlantic monthly and others
[03:08:38.680 --> 03:08:44.120]  have written headlines by the neocons saying oh trump's all talk big tech don't worry about
[03:08:44.840 --> 03:08:50.120]  the president do whatever you want censor conservatives what you've got to understand
[03:08:50.120 --> 03:08:56.040]  mr president is that china and the e you are already bringing in fines and regulations you've
[03:08:56.040 --> 03:09:02.120]  talked about this you know this against big tech based in the u.s so even if you don't regulate
[03:09:02.680 --> 03:09:06.520]  they're regulating so you're not going to allow foreign governments to have this
[03:09:07.320 --> 03:09:12.680]  power vacuum opened up for them and i know you've been giving proper orders and directives
[03:09:12.680 --> 03:09:17.800]  for antitrust uh and for lawsuits just like you did with your executive order on universities
[03:09:17.800 --> 03:09:20.840]  that was beautiful so you're not going to discriminate against conservatives or christians
[03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:27.160]  and i understand that a lot of your underlings don't carry out your orders but i'm just here to tell
[03:09:27.160 --> 03:09:37.640]  you ahead of your big summit coming up on the 11th of this month that leadership and a strong
[03:09:38.600 --> 03:09:45.000]  message to big tech is all that's going to turn this around because even if you are going to win
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:50.120]  the 2020 election which all the real numbers show you are they're planning on stealing it and they
[03:09:50.120 --> 03:09:56.440]  don't want you to have a voice or a support base when they do it and from my expert analysis
[03:09:57.480 --> 03:10:01.800]  you don't have a prayer of winning despite the fact you're probably 20 points ahead in real polls
[03:10:01.800 --> 03:10:06.520]  we all know that you're loved out there on the street across this country it doesn't matter if
[03:10:06.520 --> 03:10:12.360]  you don't have the voice and if you don't have control and if you're not standing up to big tech
[03:10:12.360 --> 03:10:17.560]  they're the same crew that's going to steal the election from you so you've got to go after them
[03:10:17.560 --> 03:10:23.320]  with less than 18 months out decisively now robert barnes step up here and talk quickly the president
[03:10:23.320 --> 03:10:28.840]  big tech believes that the president is bluffing big tech believes they can continue on their path
[03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:33.640]  they're doubling down on their path to meddling the elections to corrupt the elections to rig
[03:10:33.640 --> 03:10:37.400]  the elections by by what they're doing with their algorithms by what they're doing with
[03:10:37.400 --> 03:10:41.960]  censorship by what they're doing with blacklisting by what they're doing with demonetizing and unless
[03:10:41.960 --> 03:10:47.000]  they think at this summit is just a show summit they think this summit is not consequential
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:50.920]  they think the president is simply bluffing doesn't have the cards doesn't have the chips
[03:10:50.920 --> 03:10:55.560]  doesn't have the chutzpah to move forward and do something real and significant and consequential
[03:10:55.560 --> 03:11:00.520]  so that is why it is critical and essential and fundamental for the president to do to big tech
[03:11:00.520 --> 03:11:04.440]  what he did in terms of going right to north korea and getting the peace talks renegotiated
[03:11:04.440 --> 03:11:09.480]  and back going again he must do the same with big tech to make clear that he has the real chips
[03:11:09.480 --> 03:11:15.000]  he has the real cards and he has the real guts to take real action just like you've done on mexico
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:20.120]  and the borders and making them put 14 000 troops to the border you know what to do and i know you're
[03:11:20.120 --> 03:11:25.240]  giving the right orders but just as you said big tech brags that you won't follow through they think
[03:11:25.240 --> 03:11:31.480]  they own washington so if you won't stand up to them on this it's seen as a bellwether a test
[03:11:31.480 --> 03:11:37.720]  to steal the election traditional loss just proved 1.5 million fake voters in california
[03:11:37.720 --> 03:11:43.400]  way beyond the 3.3 million nationwide you talked about you know that if you don't exercise power
[03:11:43.400 --> 03:11:48.920]  against them right now they're going to take that election from you exactly so now is the time to act
[03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:54.920]  july 11 is the time to make clear to big tech that you will not be bullied that you are not bluffing
[03:11:54.920 --> 03:11:58.440]  and that in fact the president united states will exercise the power of the presidency
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:02.920]  to protect the freedom and fairness of our elections you do the right thing on wall way
[03:12:02.920 --> 03:12:09.000]  visionary that's 5 g isn't even in yet 98 percent of the country you have big tech
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:13.400]  ally with china you have google and apple that have moved there a year and a half ago you've got
[03:12:13.400 --> 03:12:19.240]  them helping oppress their own people and then they tell you oh we're not spying on anybody oh
[03:12:19.240 --> 03:12:26.920]  we're not election meddling it's all a lie and it's a paper tiger a paper dragon if you will simply
[03:12:26.920 --> 03:12:33.400]  announce antitrust investigations if you will simply unleash the fbi for national security
[03:12:33.400 --> 03:12:38.520]  issues with apple moving its code keys to everyone's iphone and device to china which was in roiders
[03:12:38.520 --> 03:12:44.440]  here and a half ago if you'll simply go after them these authoritarians will back down but these
[03:12:44.440 --> 03:12:50.760]  would be dictators of america don't have any respect for you because you're a decent businessman
[03:12:52.280 --> 03:12:56.440]  and you've been trying to negotiate and be friendly and you know give them a carpet of gold
[03:12:57.400 --> 03:13:03.480]  all they recognize is a carpet of bombs that means political resistance they have been demonizing
[03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:09.480]  and attacking and suing and raping your constituency because they hate you so much and you're the
[03:13:09.480 --> 03:13:14.840]  ultimate target and your family yes and now you have the project veritas proof you have senator
[03:13:14.840 --> 03:13:20.920]  widen saying i want the donald subreddit shut down the biggest website in the world that supports
[03:13:20.920 --> 03:13:26.600]  you and produces most of the memes you're the target and you know it so i hope this summit
[03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:30.680]  which we've got the inside baseball on is it just a pat people on the head make sure your
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:35.080]  constituents don't get pissed and you promise to make it a campaign issue and go out for big tech
[03:13:35.080 --> 03:13:41.000]  if you win again you're not going to win again they're going to fix the election they're going
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:45.400]  to steal it they're russia gate failed they're pissed they're coming back crazier we've done the
[03:13:45.400 --> 03:13:50.600]  research we know what's happening we know about section 230 we know about the combines the monopolies
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:56.760]  the eu regulations what do you want to advise the president in closing are his most important
[03:13:56.760 --> 03:14:02.120]  points to hit to be able to stop big tech from selling this country out the president must exercise
[03:14:02.120 --> 03:14:06.600]  the power of the presidency to protect the freedom and fairness of elections that means that unleash
[03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:10.840]  the federal trade commission on these consumer protection violations unleash the department
[03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:16.600]  of justice and the antitrust investigations and in fact create a special counsel to investigate
[03:14:16.600 --> 03:14:22.040]  whether or not they these ceo's committed perjury before congress when they lied repeatedly last
[03:14:22.040 --> 03:14:27.000]  year and they're lying repeatedly this year about their efforts to control the elections
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:32.200]  metal in the elections and censor free speech on the internet exercise that power now and he can
[03:14:32.200 --> 03:14:36.440]  change the script for 2020 so that an honest election puts him back in the presidency where he
[03:14:36.440 --> 03:14:41.240]  belongs so the president's watching this they're at the oval officer on air force one we know he
[03:14:41.240 --> 03:14:45.560]  sees his reports great patriots get it to him from a secret service you name it we salute you
[03:14:46.440 --> 03:14:50.040]  what else does he do that was a roadmap obviously he's got all the facts he understands this
[03:14:50.040 --> 03:14:55.560]  he's already given most these orders but but but how does he reign in this these rogue groups
[03:14:55.560 --> 03:14:59.080]  who think you're so powerful big tech's only powerful because we thought it was part of
[03:14:59.080 --> 03:15:03.720]  america and we turned it loose they've shown they just stain america like a bunch of snot
[03:15:03.720 --> 03:15:09.640]  knows sjw's what else does the president do legislatively executively through the criminal
[03:15:09.640 --> 03:15:14.200]  justice system what are the other tools the other tools are to push senator holly's legislation
[03:15:14.200 --> 03:15:19.240]  to condition future section 230 immunity on protection of free speech and the protection
[03:15:19.240 --> 03:15:23.800]  against election meddling that senator holly's bill is currently in the senate to do he can also
[03:15:23.800 --> 03:15:28.200]  announce all of these steps these critical executive and legislative and public steps
[03:15:28.200 --> 03:15:33.080]  at the summit itself he needs to confront them directly confront them individually confront
[03:15:33.080 --> 03:15:37.480]  them on camera in front of the world so that the world know use the power of the bully pulpit
[03:15:37.480 --> 03:15:41.800]  as well as the presidential power to change the electoral environment so that we have free and
[03:15:41.800 --> 03:15:45.480]  fair elections because the only way that's going to happen is if the president exercises his
[03:15:45.480 --> 03:15:50.440]  presidential power and there's another huge way mr president you already know this rad

[03:18:00.680 --> 03:18:05.080]  lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody
[03:18:05.080 --> 03:18:09.960]  agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war
[03:18:09.960 --> 03:18:14.360]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public
[03:18:14.360 --> 03:18:19.000]  the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:22.840]  the only way i think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my

[03:21:23.640 --> 03:21:28.280]  is coming up the authoritarians are making their move this is an incredible time to be alive but
[03:21:28.280 --> 03:21:34.040]  we need to get this message to trump hit his twitter hit his facebook hit his white house email
[03:21:34.040 --> 03:21:38.520]  send this out the president will see this report i'll call some of my sources and try to give him
[03:21:38.520 --> 03:21:43.320]  to watch it as well he doesn't always watch it but a lot of times he does especially if you flood him
[03:21:43.320 --> 03:21:49.160]  with emergency measures to donald trump concerning big tech censorship and july 11 social media summit
[03:21:49.160 --> 03:21:53.560]  you can also report it to that website at white house dot gov about the censorship the president
[03:21:53.560 --> 03:21:57.800]  needs to be flooded with this information that's what he looks at is what he's flooded with he
[03:21:57.800 --> 03:22:02.040]  cares about what you think and what you're saying we're really shaping the future here on how we're
[03:22:02.040 --> 03:22:09.000]  going to take action now going to mike adams of natural news dot com thank you alex uh what is
[03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:14.840]  astonishing today is how well delineated the lines are now between the anti-american factions
[03:22:14.840 --> 03:22:20.440]  and the pro-american factions the democrat party no longer even pretends to love this country
[03:22:20.440 --> 03:22:24.520]  they're out there announcing all kinds of agendas that would destroy america
[03:22:24.520 --> 03:22:29.960]  from within they claim that america is running concentration camps and yet what the left wants
[03:22:29.960 --> 03:22:36.360]  to do is actually put conservatives and christians into actual concentration camps and by the way
[03:22:36.360 --> 03:22:39.960]  it's not a concentration camp at the border if if you can turn around and just go home
[03:22:40.520 --> 03:22:48.200]  that's that's simply a processing facility on a humanitarian basis and aoc continues to lie
[03:22:48.200 --> 03:22:53.880]  about it and exaggerate what's going on there but it's astonishing to me how quickly the left
[03:22:53.880 --> 03:23:01.160]  has become anti-america how quickly they have professed their hatred for this country in fact
[03:23:01.160 --> 03:23:05.960]  rush limbaugh even made a point the other day i think it was yesterday that calling capernick
[03:23:05.960 --> 03:23:12.040]  it's clear from his attack about the american flag on the nike shoes it's clear that calling capernick
[03:23:12.040 --> 03:23:18.280]  he was never interested in police brutality he was always anti-america he hates the symbols of
[03:23:18.280 --> 03:23:25.080]  america he hates symbols of freedom and liberty and he has brought nike to the point where it's
[03:23:25.080 --> 03:23:33.080]  now obvious that nike itself hates america along with many other corporations such as google apple
[03:23:33.080 --> 03:23:41.080]  and twitter and facebook that are clearly demonstrating anti-america bias for example twitter
[03:23:41.080 --> 03:23:47.240]  will not take down the antifa accounts even though antifa is clearly a domestic terrorist
[03:23:47.240 --> 03:23:53.800]  organization at this point twitter and facebook and google they will ban organics they will ban
[03:23:53.800 --> 03:23:59.640]  natural health websites they will ban sites that criticize the dangers of gmo's or herbicides
[03:23:59.640 --> 03:24:06.680]  herbicides or pesticides or vaccines but they will not ban left-wing domestic terrorism groups
[03:24:06.680 --> 03:24:11.720]  and this is why i agree with what robert barnes and alex said in that special report
[03:24:12.760 --> 03:24:20.360]  president trump must take decisive action he must unleash the regulatory giants of government
[03:24:20.360 --> 03:24:25.720]  to go after these tech giants in the interest of protecting individual speech now none of us
[03:24:25.720 --> 03:24:30.760]  are fans of big government running roughshod over the rights and civil liberties of individuals
[03:24:31.400 --> 03:24:35.640]  but it is the proper role of government to go after corporations when those corporations are
[03:24:35.640 --> 03:24:41.960]  threatening the rights of individuals and in effect the tech giants today are running a massive
[03:24:41.960 --> 03:24:48.360]  criminal cartel to steal the election this is election meddling at a scale that robert muhler
[03:24:48.360 --> 03:24:53.720]  could have only dreamed of when he was fabricating his delusions of russian interference in the
[03:24:53.720 --> 03:25:00.440]  election in truth the interference in the election is these tech giants and they are doing it
[03:25:00.440 --> 03:25:05.480]  deliberately they're engineering it every day and if president trump does not rise to the occasion
[03:25:05.480 --> 03:25:12.520]  and stop this i don't see that he can get elected i mean even as disastrous as the democrats are
[03:25:12.520 --> 03:25:18.760]  right now you saw the debates you saw the clown show you saw how disastrous their ideas are the
[03:25:18.760 --> 03:25:25.880]  only ideas they have are bad ideas and yet if president trump does not take decisive action
[03:25:25.880 --> 03:25:33.000]  to stop this collusion of censorship among the criminal cartels of the tech giants then trump
[03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:39.000]  supporters will have no voice trump supporters will have no opportunity to debate in the public
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:45.560]  space we're all being silenced every day more channels being silenced and trump will not win
[03:25:45.560 --> 03:25:50.920]  unless he takes decisive action and i hope that message is getting through to him very clearly
[03:25:51.560 --> 03:25:59.000]  another important point alex said this earlier in the show the civil war in america has begun
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:05.800]  the left is waging it and the right is doing nothing the right is just the conservatives
[03:26:05.800 --> 03:26:10.680]  just letting america be overrun the left has launched a civil war the left has launched
[03:26:10.680 --> 03:26:17.400]  their brown shirts they've launched their terror wing which is engaged in domestic terrorism violence
[03:26:17.400 --> 03:26:24.280]  the use of potentially lethal weapons against journalists like andy no and many others the
[03:26:24.280 --> 03:26:33.240]  left is out of control and they will not stop until they are forced to be stopped by the intervention
[03:26:33.240 --> 03:26:39.560]  of probably the federal government or perhaps trump invoking the insurrection act which is
[03:26:39.560 --> 03:26:44.280]  exactly what needs to happen and i agree with what steward rhodes said the other day trump
[03:26:44.280 --> 03:26:49.800]  needs to put on his commander-in-chief hat and he needs to invoke the insurrection act and he
[03:26:49.800 --> 03:26:56.200]  needs to authorize action against antifa terrorists he needs to label them designate them a domestic
[03:26:56.200 --> 03:27:04.680]  terrorist organization and after doing that allow law enforcement to clean them out arrest them
[03:27:04.680 --> 03:27:10.840]  prosecute get them off the streets these are radical rabid terrorists committing acts of
[03:27:10.840 --> 03:27:17.240]  violence against innocent americans and of course they're all wearing and it's time to unmask them
[03:27:17.240 --> 03:27:22.360]  and it's time to defang them so to speak it's time to take them off the streets and it's time
[03:27:22.920 --> 03:27:29.480]  for american conservatives to stand their ground now a word of warning in all of this
[03:27:29.480 --> 03:27:35.560]  it's very clear to me that the entire media wants a conservative with a concealed carry permit
[03:27:35.560 --> 03:27:42.360]  to open fire on antifa terrorists they want to see that bloodshed and they would of course
[03:27:42.360 --> 03:27:47.000]  they would twist the story they would edit the video they would change the camera angles
[03:27:47.640 --> 03:27:54.680]  they would do what they did to was was it nick sandman the young catholic school student
[03:27:54.680 --> 03:27:59.960]  who was completely smeared by the media even though he was only standing his ground and peacefully
[03:27:59.960 --> 03:28:06.040]  smiling as these radical left-wing activists continued to to threaten him and smear him
[03:28:06.040 --> 03:28:12.360]  and try to get him to do something but the media wants conservatives to open fire in
[03:28:12.360 --> 03:28:18.360]  self-defense because the media wants the narrative and it will go exactly like this oh today
[03:28:18.360 --> 03:28:27.480]  trump supporters openly shot and killed innocent innocent uh uh progressives who were carrying
[03:28:27.480 --> 03:28:32.840]  milkshakes that's going to be the story they want they'll even take off the antifa masks and show
[03:28:32.840 --> 03:28:37.640]  you the person without the antifa garb whatever it takes they're going to try to twist the story
[03:28:37.640 --> 03:28:42.920]  and they want armed conflict to take place much more analysis straight ahead here on

[03:33:13.240 --> 03:33:21.080]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with mike adams
[03:33:24.280 --> 03:33:28.600]  welcome back to the alex jones show mike adams filling in here for natural news
[03:33:28.600 --> 03:33:37.880]  now this year 2019 is the 30th anniversary of the discovery of so-called cold fusion cold fusion
[03:33:37.880 --> 03:33:45.160]  which has since been renamed low energy nuclear reactions lenr just pronounced liner cold fusion
[03:33:45.160 --> 03:33:51.640]  was first announced by two scientists very widely recognized scientists named fleishman and ponds
[03:33:51.640 --> 03:34:00.520]  at the university of utah salt lake city 1989 now what they had observed was excess heat production
[03:34:01.080 --> 03:34:07.720]  in a reaction that could not be a simple chemical reaction it had to be in fact a low energy nuclear
[03:34:07.720 --> 03:34:13.880]  reaction involving in that case a palladium matrix and heavy water also known as deuterium
[03:34:13.880 --> 03:34:21.240]  now this cold fusion reaction was never called cold fusion by the discoverers of it fleishman
[03:34:21.240 --> 03:34:27.960]  and ponds in fact that name was put on them as the attacks began to happen i want you to understand
[03:34:27.960 --> 03:34:33.800]  that the attacks you see today on alex jones info wars or even myself or others in the independent
[03:34:33.800 --> 03:34:40.520]  media the exact same thing was run against fleishman and ponds in 1989 except they did not
[03:34:40.520 --> 03:34:47.240]  have their own websites to fight back with because the internet hardly even existed in 1989 so the
[03:34:47.240 --> 03:34:53.400]  entire establishment including the entire what we call mainstream media today they colluded to
[03:34:53.400 --> 03:34:58.840]  destroy the reputation of fleishman and ponds they colluded to cover up one of this this
[03:34:58.840 --> 03:35:03.640]  discovery which is one of the greatest discoveries in human history and the reason they did that
[03:35:03.640 --> 03:35:11.000]  was because there were billions of dollars being funded into the realm of so-called hot fusion
[03:35:11.880 --> 03:35:19.480]  hot fusion which still has not produced a single excess calorie of heat to this day as far as as
[03:35:19.480 --> 03:35:24.440]  far as i know hot fusion is not still not working and the current estimates are that hot fusion
[03:35:24.440 --> 03:35:30.840]  will take until the year 2060 just to produce a feasibility result there's an organization
[03:35:30.840 --> 03:35:37.160]  named iter it er that's being constructed in france that is working on hot fusion with
[03:35:37.160 --> 03:35:42.600]  international money to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars but getting back to 1989 it
[03:35:42.600 --> 03:35:50.440]  was the department of energy that got involved the doe helped shut down cold fusion and because the
[03:35:50.440 --> 03:35:58.840]  doe really rules over nuclear energy production and the nuclear designs that we have today are
[03:35:58.840 --> 03:36:06.280]  engineered to produce nuclear fuel as a byproduct and this is what has enabled for example former
[03:36:06.280 --> 03:36:14.040]  president barack obama to commit acts of treason by funneling nuclear technology to countries like
[03:36:14.040 --> 03:36:20.680]  iran in some cases claiming that it's just a peacetime energy production or back in the
[03:36:20.680 --> 03:36:27.160]  case of bill clinton providing nuclear technology to north korea they said it was peacetime nuclear
[03:36:27.160 --> 03:36:32.200]  energy it's infrastructure for the people of these countries in truth it's all designed to
[03:36:32.200 --> 03:36:38.600]  generate nuclear weapons and in the case of barack obama those nuclear weapons being funneled to
[03:36:38.600 --> 03:36:45.240]  iran with international money laundering from the obama administration plus nuclear fuel being
[03:36:45.240 --> 03:36:52.920]  sold through the uh the clinton well how should we say this the uh hillary clinton and her foundation
[03:36:52.920 --> 03:36:59.000]  were part of the movement of nuclear fuel out of the united states through canada to russia which
[03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:05.800]  eventually ended up in the hands of iran and this was all done by design this was all done in order
[03:37:05.800 --> 03:37:12.200]  to provide iran with nuclear weapons and it all traces back to 1989 the attacks on cold fusion
[03:37:12.200 --> 03:37:17.480]  and why they had to keep the hot fusion realm alive understand that the globalists today they
[03:37:17.480 --> 03:37:24.440]  want international nuclear war they want destabilization and most of all they want enemies
[03:37:24.440 --> 03:37:30.440]  of america to be well armed with nuclear weapons and in fact these democrats like bill clinton
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:36.520]  and barack obama have worked diligently over these years to provide the enemies of america
[03:37:36.520 --> 03:37:41.320]  with nuclear weapons capabilities and their efforts will continue if there's another democrat in
[03:37:41.320 --> 03:37:45.640]  the white house they will do the same thing understand i think it's become apparent today
[03:37:45.640 --> 03:37:51.480]  these people hate america they want to see america destroyed they wouldn't mind seeing america nuked
[03:37:52.040 --> 03:37:56.600]  they certainly wouldn't mind seeing america's allies nuked such as israel in the middle east
[03:37:56.600 --> 03:38:04.040]  for example or japan being nuked by north korea and japan is a us ally today of course and uh
[03:38:04.040 --> 03:38:10.600]  japan is someone that helps bring stability to that region or a nation that helps bring stability
[03:38:10.600 --> 03:38:15.960]  so it's very crucial to understand history here a lot of you maybe haven't heard about cold fusion
[03:38:15.960 --> 03:38:23.000]  or low energy nuclear reactions if you want to get up to date on that there is a podcast site
[03:38:23.000 --> 03:38:31.160]  that i made note of here it's called coldfusionnow.org and there there's a host named ruby uh what is it
[03:38:31.160 --> 03:38:37.240]  carrot ruby carrot and she interviews people and she brings podcasts about what's happening in the
[03:38:37.240 --> 03:38:42.840]  realm of cold fusion the truth is that these cold fusion experiments are being replicated now they
[03:38:42.840 --> 03:38:49.320]  have been successfully recreated in hundreds of laboratories across the world including laboratories
[03:38:49.320 --> 03:38:55.400]  in japan laboratories in europe in the united states and other countries and in fact corporations
[03:38:55.400 --> 03:39:02.120]  like toyota have invested money in low energy nuclear reaction research and believe it or not google
[03:39:02.120 --> 03:39:09.160]  is also invested through one of its subsidiaries in low energy nuclear reaction research what's
[03:39:09.160 --> 03:39:15.320]  fascinating to me is that when you have all these climate change cultists running around saying oh the
[03:39:15.320 --> 03:39:20.840]  climate's going to destroy us all they say carbon dioxide is bad they say fossil fuels will be the
[03:39:20.840 --> 03:39:28.680]  end of all of us there's hardly i can't think of one of them that has gone out and said we need
[03:39:28.680 --> 03:39:35.000]  cold fusion we need low energy nuclear reactions that technology exists it has been covered up by
[03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:41.400]  the department of energy i.e the war machine in america the military industrial complex and it is
[03:39:41.400 --> 03:39:49.880]  exactly individuals like president trump who threatens to cause upheaval that could unleash
[03:39:49.880 --> 03:39:58.280]  this technology for the benefit of humankind imagine eating your home in the winter with a small
[03:39:58.280 --> 03:40:05.720]  machine that is no bigger than a modern day computer server you know smaller than your
[03:40:05.720 --> 03:40:13.160]  dishwasher but it heats your home for virtually free imagine eating businesses warehouses and
[03:40:13.160 --> 03:40:18.920]  farm and agricultural buildings which consume a tremendous amount of fossil fuels throughout
[03:40:18.920 --> 03:40:26.440]  the winters all of that is producing co2 which i say co2 is a healing molecule it's a greening
[03:40:26.440 --> 03:40:31.720]  molecule it's good for plants but the climate change people say co2 is a poison and a pollutant
[03:40:31.720 --> 03:40:38.440]  and yet you don't see them saying let's use cold fusion to heat homes and buildings and
[03:40:38.440 --> 03:40:43.560]  farms and warehouses and schools you don't see them saying that which proves they're not really
[03:40:43.560 --> 03:40:48.760]  interested in solving the problem they just want something to complain about their winers just like
[03:40:48.760 --> 03:40:54.360]  everything the left does they want victims they want the dead dad and the dead child in the river
[03:40:54.360 --> 03:41:01.160]  crossing the border they want destitution they want homelessness austin just passed a law to have
[03:41:01.160 --> 03:41:05.080]  tent cities and shanty towns all over the public streets and sidewalks of austin
[03:41:05.640 --> 03:41:10.600]  they want to turn austin into san francisco i guess or seattle and you have all these liberal
[03:41:10.600 --> 03:41:17.240]  cities are now expanding into mass homelessness that is by design understand that's on purpose
[03:41:17.800 --> 03:41:23.240]  they want problems in our world they don't want any solutions whatsoever so when trump
[03:41:23.240 --> 03:41:27.880]  comes along and says i'm going to bring solutions to this trump says i'm going to solve this international
[03:41:27.880 --> 03:41:33.080]  trade disparity trump says i'm going to i'm going to fight this currency war against china which is
[03:41:33.080 --> 03:41:38.920]  constantly devaluing its own currency trump is a solutions oriented kind of guy and that's why
[03:41:38.920 --> 03:41:43.720]  he is hated by the establishment because the establishment needs problems the establishment
[03:41:43.720 --> 03:41:51.960]  needs scarcity of fossil fuels they cannot allow solutions to be publicized and shared with the
[03:41:51.960 --> 03:41:58.520]  public look we already have the answers folks to all of these problems we can we can create
[03:41:58.520 --> 03:42:04.360]  essentially free heat we have the answers to cancer we can solve the cancer epidemic we know

[03:42:22.840 --> 03:42:28.760]  all being suppressed and shut down by the establishment that wants to keep humanity weak
[03:42:28.760 --> 03:42:34.760]  and keep humanity enslaved and keep you dumbed down and keep you ignorant google and the tech
[03:42:34.760 --> 03:42:40.360]  giants have become realms of anti-knowledge they no longer allow you to find real knowledge it's all

[03:44:49.880 --> 03:44:55.800]  more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this there is no longer any
[03:44:55.800 --> 03:45:00.840]  doubt multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted violent malice style

[03:45:51.880 --> 03:45:58.520]  life dot com robert barnes what does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have become
[03:45:58.520 --> 03:46:02.600]  big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic
[03:46:02.600 --> 03:46:06.840]  political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why
[03:46:06.840 --> 03:46:11.000]  the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this
[03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:14.920]  the ordinary members of the public in the audience that care about this has to bring real social
[03:46:14.920 --> 03:46:19.160]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and
[03:46:19.160 --> 03:46:23.080]  they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[03:46:23.080 --> 03:46:27.400]  who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[03:46:27.400 --> 03:46:32.200]  recover after the great depression the info wars audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[03:46:32.200 --> 03:46:37.240]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real
[03:46:37.240 --> 03:46:41.560]  the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[03:46:41.560 --> 03:46:45.960]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's
[03:46:45.960 --> 03:46:49.720]  thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate
[03:46:49.720 --> 03:46:54.120]  form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[03:46:54.120 --> 03:47:00.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:10.280 --> 03:47:16.920]  we now take you live to the central texas command center in the heart of the resistance
[03:47:16.920 --> 03:47:26.600]  it's mike adams you're listening to the alex jones show i guarantee you that you're not ready for
[03:47:26.600 --> 03:47:33.320]  what's coming the reason i know you're not ready is because i've been prepping in one way or another
[03:47:33.320 --> 03:47:39.080]  for over 20 years and i'm not ready and unless you are sort of a lifelong professional prepper
[03:47:39.080 --> 03:47:44.200]  there's no way you can be ready for what's coming and when i say what's coming i'm talking about
[03:47:44.200 --> 03:47:49.400]  an accelerating cascading collapse of what you know as civil society and the infrastructure
[03:47:49.400 --> 03:47:53.640]  that serves that society today so this segment is going to be about collapse and some of the
[03:47:53.640 --> 03:48:02.280]  things that you can do to insulate yourself right now i was um there's a by the way a couple of
[03:48:02.280 --> 03:48:07.400]  movies that you need to watch or rewatch that i'm going to recommend to hear number one remember book
[03:48:07.400 --> 03:48:15.480]  of elie with denzel washington and his character was roaming through a collapse post apocalyptic
[03:48:15.480 --> 03:48:21.320]  world where there had been some kind of war some kind of a grid down scenario maybe nuclear war
[03:48:21.320 --> 03:48:28.440]  it wasn't really clear in the movie but in that in that scenario all the ammo had already been used
[03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:35.240]  so this was the post ammunition world now it's important to realize that no matter how much
[03:48:35.240 --> 03:48:40.360]  ammunition you stockpile and those of us who are patriots of course i think maybe we have plenty
[03:48:40.360 --> 03:48:47.480]  of ammunition there's a point where it runs out and the the manufacture of ammunition requires
[03:48:47.480 --> 03:48:55.880]  a complex society so you it's not so easy to make clean burning gunpowder it's not so easy to make
[03:48:55.880 --> 03:49:01.080]  the brass casings it's not so easy to make the primers right now you buy those things online
[03:49:01.080 --> 03:49:06.040]  you buy the bullets you buy the the powder you buy the brass you buy the primers you know you put
[03:49:06.040 --> 03:49:11.880]  them together and you're reloading a center in your garage or whatever but imagine a world where
[03:49:11.880 --> 03:49:17.640]  you can't buy those components how do you make those on your own you can't it requires a complex
[03:49:17.640 --> 03:49:23.320]  society to make those pieces and when society collapses that complexity what we call the
[03:49:23.320 --> 03:49:29.160]  specialization of those certain things like the ability to to smelt metals and create metal
[03:49:29.160 --> 03:49:34.920]  alloys and so on the ability to refine gunpowder raw materials and so on those specializations
[03:49:34.920 --> 03:49:41.000]  collapse and you end up in a very rudimentary society which has to return to some level of
[03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:45.480]  agrarian society where people are growing most of their own food in order to survive
[03:49:45.480 --> 03:49:50.520]  and the weapon systems that are used in those times are guess what edged weapons that's what
[03:49:50.520 --> 03:49:58.360]  was depicted in the movie with Denzel Washington as weapons and bow and arrow and yes your crossbow
[03:49:58.360 --> 03:50:03.720]  that because everybody's got a crossbow for some reason out there and guess what it actually
[03:50:03.720 --> 03:50:08.680]  has a purpose after the ammunition runs out but that could be a long period of time after
[03:50:08.680 --> 03:50:15.960]  collapse ammo will reign supreme for a period of time because guess what firearms work even when
[03:50:15.960 --> 03:50:20.520]  the power grid collapses and this is what i find hilarious about the whole argument about smart
[03:50:20.520 --> 03:50:28.120]  guns so you see these liberal anti-gun politicians always pushing smart guns in their cities they
[03:50:28.120 --> 03:50:32.760]  want everybody to buy a smart gun well what's a smart gun it's a gun that has electronics
[03:50:33.560 --> 03:50:39.240]  which will fail so everybody who has a smart gun i mean look if if i'm in a post-collapse scenario
[03:50:39.880 --> 03:50:50.840]  and i've got my bcm ar like my recce 14.5 inch barrel whatever i would love to fight with a
[03:50:50.840 --> 03:50:55.800]  bunch of people who have smart guns because all their guns will fail the batteries will run out
[03:50:55.800 --> 03:51:01.720]  the circuit boards will be blown out by emp weapons or solar flares or that fingerprint scan won't
[03:51:01.720 --> 03:51:05.960]  work that day because they're sweating too much because they're they're taking rounds you know
[03:51:05.960 --> 03:51:11.400]  what i mean i would never buy a smart gun i would never rely on a smart gun i would never even rely
[03:51:12.040 --> 03:51:16.840]  entirely on electronic optics you got to have iron sights you got to make sure you back up
[03:51:16.840 --> 03:51:23.960]  sights work so firearms work even when the power grid goes down think about the world
[03:51:23.960 --> 03:51:30.360]  even we talk about cryptocurrency whether it's bitcoin or mark of the beast facebook's new
[03:51:30.360 --> 03:51:35.960]  liber coin i think they call it global coin all those cryptocurrency stop working when the power
[03:51:35.960 --> 03:51:43.160]  grid goes down what still works again depicted in the movie the book of elie what has value
[03:51:43.160 --> 03:51:50.520]  clean water has value gold and silver coins have value working flip open lighters have value
[03:51:50.520 --> 03:51:55.800]  have value edge weapons have value firearms have value and especially ammunition has value
[03:51:55.800 --> 03:52:03.240]  because it's very scarce at that point so don't forget how quickly society can collapse there's
[03:52:03.240 --> 03:52:09.480]  also another movie out there called captive state but i strongly recommend you watch and it basically
[03:52:09.480 --> 03:52:17.240]  presents the same premise as the colony series which talks about a non-earth extraterrestrial
[03:52:17.240 --> 03:52:25.080]  alien force occupying earth and controlling society and human beings being put into slave camps
[03:52:25.080 --> 03:52:32.040]  to work for the aliens and the reason the reason these move this movie is so important to watch
[03:52:32.040 --> 03:52:37.880]  captive state is very well done it's a very realistic kind of aura settings and the acting
[03:52:37.880 --> 03:52:43.560]  is all absolutely amazing john goodman stars in this movie along with some younger stars
[03:52:43.560 --> 03:52:50.440]  it's a fantastic film i strongly recommend you watch it but look how quickly some factions
[03:52:50.440 --> 03:52:57.960]  of humankind turn against humanity and agree to work for the aliens in this case this is a fictional
[03:52:57.960 --> 03:53:02.520]  account a fictional movie of course but it says something important about humanity
[03:53:02.520 --> 03:53:08.600]  i think it's good to watch this and to understand that when it comes down to it whether we're talking
[03:53:08.600 --> 03:53:14.200]  about occupation by united nations troops or whether we're talking about you know something
[03:53:14.200 --> 03:53:22.120]  more out there like what's depicted in the film most people will turn against humanity if given
[03:53:22.120 --> 03:53:27.560]  some reward for doing so very few people operate with ethics very few people will stand their ground
[03:53:27.560 --> 03:53:34.760]  with morality and the rule of law very few people will do what's right when it is so much easier
[03:53:34.760 --> 03:53:39.880]  for them to do what's wrong and so when you think about the collapse of society today we're already
[03:53:39.880 --> 03:53:47.320]  seeing this emerge we're seeing antifa terrorists take to the streets and beat people and rob people
[03:53:47.320 --> 03:53:52.200]  and violently assault people with deadly weapons people who are innocent journalists in fact in
[03:53:52.200 --> 03:53:57.160]  the case of andy know a gay conservative journalist i think he's conservative maybe maybe he's not
[03:53:57.160 --> 03:54:03.960]  maybe he's more libertarian he's a gay journalist and they attacked him showing how quickly they
[03:54:03.960 --> 03:54:10.120]  were willing to turn against humanity and turn against their own so-called philosophy antifa
[03:54:10.120 --> 03:54:18.360]  also recently defaced a chick filet restaurant and they they're putting graffiti they're they're
[03:54:18.360 --> 03:54:22.360]  trying to destroy private property they're trying to destroy businesses and they do this in the name
[03:54:22.360 --> 03:54:28.440]  of love so understand that this escalation of violence will always be carried out in the name
[03:54:28.440 --> 03:54:36.120]  of love and peace and tolerance by the very same lunatics on the left who are filled with hatred
[03:54:36.120 --> 03:54:42.120]  filled with violence filled with bigotry and they will target people based on the color skin
[03:54:42.680 --> 03:54:49.320]  or based on their political philosophies and the collapse of society is accelerating so rapidly
[03:54:49.320 --> 03:54:54.440]  right now it's also being accelerated with this attempt by the left to flood the united states
[03:54:54.440 --> 03:55:02.680]  with illegal migrants illegal aliens by flooding the southern border of the united states they place
[03:55:02.680 --> 03:55:09.640]  a burden on all southern states you know texas arizona california and so on and by doing that
[03:55:09.640 --> 03:55:15.880]  what they they do is they destabilize part of society and they require then a shifting of
[03:55:15.880 --> 03:55:21.800]  resources to deal with those individuals taking away resources from things like law and order when
[03:55:21.800 --> 03:55:27.240]  you have to send police to deal with these illegals like what happened in new mexico
[03:55:27.240 --> 03:55:31.000]  they took state police from all across the state and they sent them into albuquerque
[03:55:31.000 --> 03:55:38.280]  to manage a migrant detention center and by doing that they took away these resources from across
[03:55:38.280 --> 03:55:43.480]  the state so then you start to have lawlessness spreading out across america you have increased
[03:55:43.480 --> 03:55:49.640]  costs to society based on the lawlessness you have more home robberies you have more
[03:55:49.640 --> 03:55:54.280]  rapes you have more crimes that have to be prosecuted this is what helps bring down society
[03:55:54.920 --> 03:56:02.360]  this invasion of america is a planned event to destroy the united states of america from within
[03:56:02.360 --> 03:56:08.200]  this is why president trump must invoke the insurrection act he must deploy the military
[03:56:08.200 --> 03:56:15.000]  to the border he must stop this invasion and frankly he must arrest and indict all of those
[03:56:15.000 --> 03:56:21.000]  on the radical left who are complicit in this invasion including these twisted federal judges
[03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:25.960]  who think they run the country it's time to just send in the military police arrest those judges
[03:56:25.960 --> 03:56:31.960]  and say you are not the president your little district decision here does not control america
[03:56:31.960 --> 03:56:37.480]  we have a right to defend our country a right to defend our nation one other point in all of this
[03:56:37.480 --> 03:56:41.720]  you may have noticed yesterday the internet was down virtually every website that you know
[03:56:41.720 --> 03:56:46.760]  from drudge a gateway pundit maybe info wars i know natural news was down for i think 12 minutes
[03:56:46.760 --> 03:56:53.560]  or so there was a cloud flare a problem that cascaded throughout the system and it brought
[03:56:53.560 --> 03:56:59.560]  almost everything down that you can imagine and it caused hay havoc and chaos throughout the day
[03:56:59.560 --> 03:57:04.120]  we have seen more and more of these failures across the internet recently showing the massive
[03:57:04.120 --> 03:57:10.520]  vulnerabilities of the telecom and internet infrastructure we are seeing the internet is
[03:57:10.520 --> 03:57:16.120]  not resilient it is not robust and it can be brought down by one problem with one provider in this
[03:57:16.120 --> 03:57:23.080]  case cloud flare that can also be exploited as a kill switch in other words someone could force
[03:57:23.080 --> 03:57:27.720]  cloud flare to take down all those websites by recreating the same problem they experienced the
[03:57:27.720 --> 03:57:33.400]  other day and it would take down most of the internet so we are not resilient we are not robust
[03:57:33.400 --> 03:57:38.840]  and our society is subject to a cascading accelerating failure that's the truth about what's
[03:57:38.840 --> 03:57:44.520]  happening thanks for watching today mike adams here for info wars dot com get prepared the time has
[03:57:44.520 --> 03:57:50.280]  come the time is here the globalists are openly activating their anti-american forces to demonize
[03:57:50.280 --> 03:57:54.360]  the american people the very existence of our borders and that the whole world could come here
[03:57:54.360 --> 03:57:59.560]  and get everything free but that we the citizens have to pay for it when our nation is on the verge
[03:57:59.560 --> 03:58:04.760]  of bankruptcy if we don't have major innovation and major booms we will collapse into third world
[03:58:04.760 --> 03:58:11.160]  status and the un and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in europe and the us to collapse
[03:58:11.160 --> 03:58:15.800]  the countries to kill capitalism and bring in socialism so we can go the way of the old
[03:58:15.800 --> 03:58:20.200]  soviet union north korea and venezuela this is a plan that's why we've got to stay on air it's why

[03:58:44.360 --> 03:58:48.280]  let's talk to margaret's in new york margaret's here on the air thanks for holding hey i just want
[03:58:48.280 --> 03:58:52.360]  to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york
[03:58:52.360 --> 03:58:57.080]  city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the
[03:58:57.080 --> 03:59:02.120]  neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[03:59:02.120 --> 03:59:06.840]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if
[03:59:06.840 --> 03:59:10.280]  trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he could
[03:59:10.280 --> 03:59:14.280]  be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and
[03:59:14.280 --> 03:59:17.960]  the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the
[03:59:17.960 --> 03:59:22.840]  reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old i would love
[03:59:22.840 --> 03:59:27.240]  to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into
