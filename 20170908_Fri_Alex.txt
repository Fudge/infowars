[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:12.000 --> 00:17.000]  North Korea testing H bombs has announced.
[00:17.000 --> 00:22.000]  They're getting ready to test more missiles this weekend.
[00:22.000 --> 00:26.000]  They're saying Japan's being targeted.
[00:26.000 --> 00:34.000]  You've got Mexico hit with the biggest earthquake ever recorded in modern history in the last 100 years
[00:34.000 --> 00:40.000]  since seismographs were in Central America and Southern North America.
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.000]  You've got mysterious green lights lighting up in the night sky before the earthquake.
[00:45.000 --> 00:54.000]  That's because you have tectonic plates moving and that energy is transferred and basically creates its own aurora borealis.
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  Some of these green lights have even been caught on video.
[00:58.000 --> 01:07.000]  You've got ISIS joining leftists and celebrating Hurricane Irma, the fastest rotating hurricane ever recorded.
[01:07.000 --> 01:20.000]  Now a category six, devastating through the Caribbean as it goes on its rampage now coming across Cuba.
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  Most of the tracks have the storm going straight up the keys right down the middle of Florida,
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.000]  but starting to steer a little bit more towards the west, perhaps even turning and raking out into the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  But most tracks show it going right up through Georgia, right up into Tennessee and the Carolinas.
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  We are going to be here today, right through this evening live,
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.000]  and now we are live from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. straight through.
[01:50.000 --> 01:58.000]  And by the middle of next year, I intend to be on 15 to 18 hours a day and by the end of next year, 20 hours a day.
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, down the road, who knows, maybe even 24 hours a day.
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  We may take excerpts of the most powerful news of the day and put that together.
[02:09.000 --> 02:17.000]  Wow, I said earlier this week, I said, watch, I bet we see some gigantic earthquakes.
[02:17.000 --> 02:24.000]  I said, I don't know why, but the ancients all wrote about the fact that when you had big storms,
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.000]  you would get earthquakes and you would get volcanoes.
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000]  They just thought the gods were angry.
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  They associated it with the sun.
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  They associated it with the stars.
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  They associated it with alignments.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  They associated it with total eclipses.
[02:39.000 --> 02:40.000]  They didn't know why.
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  They just knew you get total eclipses.
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.000]  You get wars.
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.000]  You get volcanic eruptions.
[02:47.000 --> 02:48.000]  You get earthquakes.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  You get giant storms.
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.000]  You've got 30 plus people now dead in Mexico from an earthquake that hit off the coast
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  and there's ongoing issues with high waves, tsunamis.
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.000]  Wow.
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  So you've got massive buildup towards war.
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  You've got massive political upheaval across the planet against the globalist.
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  You have the earth itself going through great changes.
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  Why do these things come together?
[03:17.000 --> 03:26.000]  Why did all the political trends build towards the astronomical information that we now see being shared?
[03:26.000 --> 03:36.000]  How does that tie into what we see in our own personal lives and the reports coming out
[03:36.000 --> 03:43.000]  of accelerated suicide, accelerated mental illness, accelerated demon possession type activity
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  that even psychologists and psychiatrists can't explain what's going on?
[03:49.000 --> 03:57.000]  Because as humanity awakens, there's a polarity, evil is also rising.
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  The yin and the yang, the two forces in Newtonian physics.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[04:06.000 --> 04:16.000]  We are going into an amazing time of opportunity, but also a great time of danger.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  And anyone denying that has not paid attention to history.
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.000]  The elites know this and they've been running to armored redoubts the last six, seven years
[04:26.000 --> 04:35.000]  and building giant underground bases underneath their mansions in Hawaii, places like Kauai
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  and places like Tasmania and many others.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  We, of course, reported all this first year.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  Now it's all confirmed.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  So what does the elite know that the general public doesn't know?
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  What's coming?
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.000]  What's coming?
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  This isn't mumbo jumbo.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  This is science and you're seeing it happen.
[04:54.000 --> 05:04.000]  We just don't know the secrets of the universe, so we feel like ignorant savages.
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films,
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  great patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000]  And we've got a new humongoid sale, not a number of things that are on massive sale,
[05:16.000 --> 05:17.000]  but on what's on sale.
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  We've never offered super male vitality, known concentrated herbs, cold pressed,
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  super male vitality, 57% off.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  It's never been the price.
[05:29.000 --> 05:35.000]  It is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third party sites, unprecedented.
[05:35.000 --> 05:36.000]  And it's cold pressed.
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  That's why super male is so different.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science.
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.000]  These are what you sell.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  BuzzFeed said it's like it's already best selling stuff.
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.000]  Why these aren't anything new?
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.000]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold pressed?
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  Dude.
[05:53.000 --> 05:54.000]  Dude.
[05:59.000 --> 06:03.000]  After being sold out for months, our best selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock.
[06:03.000 --> 06:04.000]  Nymphoverstore.com.
[06:04.000 --> 06:07.000]  Research across the board is clear.
[06:07.000 --> 06:10.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream,
[06:10.000 --> 06:12.000]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.000]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns
[06:16.000 --> 06:19.000]  that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.000]  Super Blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[06:23.000 --> 06:26.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue.
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  Those and by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  nano silver and more, due to requests from listeners
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  We have created the new bubble gum flavored Super Blue,
[06:49.000 --> 06:50.000]  but it's spearmint free.
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.000]  Learn more about the new bubble gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste

[07:55.000 --> 08:05.000]  That's infowarslife.com.
[08:25.000 --> 08:54.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, the 8th day of September.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  2017.
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.000]  We're going to open the phones up throughout the broadcast today.
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  We also have some guests joining us who are in Florida
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  who can report on what they're witnessing there for themselves.
[09:07.000 --> 09:15.000]  We're going to open the phones up so you can specifically give us your take
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  and your view on what you think is happening in the world right now.
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  Because all the ancients agreed they didn't understand it.
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  They didn't know what it was, but all the historians as well,
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.000]  even in contemporary times, 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago,
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.000]  the Roman historians 2,000 years ago, Greek historians 3,000 years ago,
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  they all noticed that there were times in history when wars and earthquakes
[09:42.000 --> 09:48.000]  and famines and super storms all came at one time.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  These quickening periods.
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.000]  Now, we call the great quickening the singularity,
[09:54.000 --> 10:00.000]  which most futurists and scientists have been projecting into the future.
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.000]  But there are many, many singularities, many processes
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  where we see things going obsolete in just a few weeks or a few days now
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.000]  that previously would take something 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 years
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  to become obsolete or semi-obsolete.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  And so the big discussion should be, what are we transforming into?
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  Who is directing it? Who is controlling it?
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  Not just the globalists trying to play God, trying to control it,
[10:30.000 --> 10:36.000]  but what is the interstellar, galactic, subatomic, interdimensional force
[10:36.000 --> 10:44.000]  that even mainline supercomputers from IBM and from top Japanese companies as well
[10:44.000 --> 10:52.000]  have now projected an outside energy force many, many times more powerful in magnitude
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.000]  than the dimension that we're in and that this dimension, the third dimension
[10:57.000 --> 11:07.000]  is being artificially held in place by a power of magnitude that is not calculatable.
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  It is beyond infinity.
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  Don't believe me? Just type into a search engine.
[11:12.000 --> 11:19.000]  Top scientists, mathematics, galactic spectrometers, deep space telescopes, radio telescopes,
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  quantum mechanics, scanning dark matter, data around black holes
[11:25.000 --> 11:32.000]  shows that there is a super force holding everything in place.
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  Now suddenly, top billionaires, top bank owners, top CEOs cannot say,
[11:37.000 --> 11:47.000]  we're in a simulation and there's an outside force controlling that simulation
[11:47.000 --> 11:54.000]  and we are going to build a new reality inside the digital silicon universe
[11:54.000 --> 12:01.000]  that is going to be better than the prison we've been put on on this planet.
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  But we need you to give us your will, your soul, your mind, your creativity
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  into that new dimension we're creating, this artificial dimension to make it real.
[12:14.000 --> 12:23.000]  That's the devil trying to convince the angels to go with him and create his new reality.
[12:23.000 --> 12:31.000]  Now you could say that's just cosmology from ancient Jews writing Genesis,
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  but you cannot deny that the elites of today say they are becoming gods
[12:37.000 --> 12:44.000]  and are building their new system and are trying to make this reality as ugly as possible
[12:44.000 --> 12:51.000]  to get us to give up on it and to plug in to their modern matrix and to take the blue pill.
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.000]  You take the blue pill, you go back to sleep.
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  Be whatever you want in La La Land and virtual reality.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  You take the red pill.
[13:03.000 --> 13:06.000]  I'm taking you down the rabbit hole.
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.000]  All I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  So you think about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:17.000 --> 13:24.000]  You look at how we are seeing record earthquakes, record megastorms forming all of a sudden,
[13:24.000 --> 13:32.000]  record volcanic activity, record political turmoil, record famine, record political corruption,
[13:32.000 --> 13:40.000]  record awakening, record scientific development, record knowledge being deployed
[13:40.000 --> 13:49.000]  as good and evil rise to the great contest at the very same time.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  None of us fully understand it.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  Most people aren't even conscious of it.
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.000]  But beginning to try to understand it is the beginning of wisdom.
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  And fear of God is simply not being arrogant and believing your God,
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  but standing in the majesty of the great space-time intergalactic continuum
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  and having respect for the fact that you are part of this.
[14:15.000 --> 14:24.000]  Or you can go with Bezos and all the rest of them into their little Zuckerberg synthetic system
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.000]  that they're offering you, where they're God.
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.000]  Zuckerberg doesn't just want to be president, he wants to be God.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  Now let's get into the news.
[14:35.000 --> 14:42.000]  Mexico earthquake, mysterious green flashes light up the sky after the tremor.
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  That is out of the Associated Press.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  Earthquakes off Mexico kills dozens.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  It's now over 30.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  It sparks tsunami warning.
[14:51.000 --> 14:57.000]  Mexico's strongest earthquake in a century leaves dozens dead.
[14:57.000 --> 15:05.000]  It's now 32 dead, unfortunately, in Mexico, that according to the Australian news.
[15:05.000 --> 15:13.000]  So, Rush Limbaugh asked if this hurricane's even real,
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  or if it's being hyped up by the media.
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000]  They've hyped up other hurricanes that ended up, thank God, not be so deadly.
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  But hurricanes historically can be destructive and can kill a lot of people,
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  can flatten everything on their path, so you're smart to recognize it
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  and think that you should make preparations for it.
[15:32.000 --> 15:39.000]  But I know one thing, this quickening that we see at every level of matter
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.000]  is also affecting the core of the earth, the mantle of the earth,
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  the crust of the earth, the tectonic forces of the earth,
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.000]  and you're seeing the Pacific Rim light up in volcanic activity under the sea, above the sea,
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  and North Korea tested that powerful hydrogen bomb last Saturday.
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  And one reason we have an international convention against above ground
[16:03.000 --> 16:09.000]  or below ground nuclear testing is it's been directly connected to tectonic shift.
[16:09.000 --> 16:16.000]  If you've got plates already about to pop and you start testing hydrogen bombs underground
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  on the very fault line in the Pacific Rim,
[16:20.000 --> 16:26.000]  the hottest areas right there through Korea, South China Sea, Japan,
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  what do you expect to see?
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  But again, the globalists don't want you to ever make these connections.
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  You're supposed to look at each story by itself and never use your own mind
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  to make the connections that are right there playing for you to see.
[16:41.000 --> 16:47.000]  It doesn't mean you see it crystal clear, but it means it's the beginning of seeing the patterns
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  in the seasons and in wildlife and in your own life and in your family
[16:51.000 --> 16:58.000]  and in business and in culture.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  So we have North Korea out of control.
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  More missile tests scheduled this Saturday.
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  Oh, but there's a solar superstorm.
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  There's already been a big solar storm the last week,
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.000]  but an even bigger one's coming.
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.000]  And so now they've been able to test their missile
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  because there'll be so much interference in the atmosphere.
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  They may not be able to track it with their more primitive telemetry controls
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.000]  because they're not going to be controlling their missile with satellites.
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  They're going to be controlling it with ground-based signals.
[17:30.000 --> 17:34.000]  So storms above storms below.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  South Korea braces for another possible North Korea missile test.
[17:38.000 --> 17:43.000]  Solar storms may deter Kim from launching missile this weekend.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  That's Bloomberg.
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  Nuke sniffer ballistic recon aircraft.
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  Deployed to Okinawa, Japan and rising tensions with North Korea.
[17:53.000 --> 18:00.000]  Sweeping change in China's military points to more firepower for Z.
[18:00.000 --> 18:08.000]  North Korea says U.S. to pay dearly for Haley's hysterical fit.
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  Saying they're begging for war.
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  But they are begging for war.
[18:15.000 --> 18:22.000]  Meanwhile, the weak cowardly types that are anti-sovereignty, anti-renaissance,
[18:22.000 --> 18:29.000]  anti-true free market America that no one can deny is the big hit, the big cornucopia.
[18:29.000 --> 18:34.000]  The ghost of Christmas present.
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.000]  As Robert DeVall says in network, the big you know what hit.
[18:39.000 --> 18:49.000]  The left projects onto it their power even though it's their own ilk that are going to be hit the most.
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.000]  ISIS joins leftists in celebrating Hurricane Irma.
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  Paul Joseph Watson in foewars.com.
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  You can read their statements in newspapers, magazines, in Twitter.
[19:00.000 --> 19:06.000]  You've got Hollywood stars coming out.
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  Jennifer Lawrence.
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.000]  She may have a beautiful face and beautiful body, but she's got an ugly, stupid mind.
[19:14.000 --> 19:20.000]  Jennifer Lawrence, mother nature's rage directed at U.S. because of Trump.
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  Yes, yes, there isn't a God Hollywood says.
[19:23.000 --> 19:28.000]  There's no powerful force out there except when they want to say there's a force, then it exists.
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  See, because they are the arbiters of all reality.
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.000]  They can suspend gravity while still having gravity at the same time.
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  They can jump back and forth and say two plus two equals whatever they want.
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  But she says, yes, America deserves what's happening and it's payment against conservatives.
[19:42.000 --> 19:48.000]  Even though it's going to be mainly poor liberals, poor controlled people,
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  deceived people in Florida, they're going to be in the crosshairs.
[19:52.000 --> 19:59.000]  Coming up, we're going to look at the evacuations, the stalled cars, the gas, the empty shells.
[19:59.000 --> 20:06.000]  You want to save money in a place that gives you growth, control and certainty without stock market risk or tax risk,
[20:06.000 --> 20:10.000]  and you want guarantees and you want it all tax-free. That's a tall order.
[20:10.000 --> 20:14.000]  But you can get all of that with properly designed participating whole life insurance.
[20:14.000 --> 20:18.000]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead. That's true.
[20:18.000 --> 20:23.000]  But you can have tax-free access to use your life insurance while you're alive.
[20:23.000 --> 20:28.000]  Get the free book to find out how. Call 702-660-7000.

[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[21:00.000 --> 21:05.000]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  But the symptoms are there.
[21:07.000 --> 21:12.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[21:12.000 --> 21:15.000]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[22:02.000 --> 22:08.000]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[23:53.000 --> 24:22.000]  There's a giant solar storm being ejected from the sun as we speak and the storm is expected to peak by NASA's sensors.
[24:22.000 --> 24:31.000]  This weekend the storms obviously drive nuclei coming into the atmosphere.
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.000]  Scientists up until about 50 years ago thought potash was the main trigger in the atmosphere for nuclei to form
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  because they knew that nuclei couldn't form and cause water precipitation by itself.
[24:43.000 --> 24:54.000]  Now they know it's micrometeorites and solar wideband radiation that drives about 95% of our atmospheric weather.
[24:54.000 --> 25:01.000]  You've got mega storms from the sun, mega hurricanes, mega typhoons, mega earthquakes,
[25:01.000 --> 25:08.000]  biggest ever recorded in Mexico, a mega political upheaval, massive changes happening,
[25:08.000 --> 25:15.000]  massive unprecedented Pacific Rim activity, hydrogen bomb test going on at the same time.
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.000]  A lot of scientists believe helping trigger some of these earthquakes.
[25:18.000 --> 25:24.000]  This is an amazing time to be alive and I've been telling you in the last six months get ready for major earth changes
[25:24.000 --> 25:30.000]  because this historically happens. No one knows why but it's all interconnected.
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.000]  The left says it's because we're Christians or because Trump's evil or whatever
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  and here's a Paul Joseph Watson report on the truth about Hurricane Irma.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  Hurricane Irma has barreled through the Caribbean causing apocalyptic devastation.
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.000]  It's set to crash into Florida imminently. They're calling it the strongest storm ever.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  And who's to blame? Donald Trump.
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.000]  Is it possible that Trump has a hurricane making machine that pushes the news off his racist decisions?
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.000]  You are like the hurricane.
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  The government will manipulate the weather to exterminate blacks even if they have to kill whites.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  Why do they say Hurricane Irma is headed for Miami? Did y'all realize 70% of Miami is Latino, Hispanic or Cuban?
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  44% of the Haitian population in the US resides in Miami. Miami is like Houston in which it is flourishing economically.
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  Co-incidence? Trump wants them off our land so what better way than to flood them out?
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  Read between the lines people.
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  Why is everyone making fun of her? She was only stating facts.
[26:21.000 --> 26:27.000]  Is there anything, anything you hysterical morons won't tie into your Trump derangement syndrome?
[26:27.000 --> 26:33.000]  If they weren't accusing Trump of creating the hurricane, others were celebrating the fact that it was about to destroy his properties
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  because the racist deserves it.
[26:35.000 --> 26:39.000]  I hope that place gets flattened. Rename Irma Hurricane Kammer.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  That's because God hates Trump. God punishes f*** like President Donald Trump with a hurricane.
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  Wipe them out.
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  You know the island where racist Donald Trump's property is located?
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  The island that just got savaged by Hurricane Irma, St. Martin.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  Their biggest indigenous population group is made up of brown and black people,
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.000]  as is virtually every other island in the Caribbean that just got devastated by the hurricane.
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  The island of Barbuda is now barely habitable with 90% of buildings destroyed.
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  Barbuda's population is 90% black.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  You're literally cheering the destruction of black people's lives.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  What lies matter?
[27:14.000 --> 27:17.000]  Oh, but Trump's beach house got wiped out so I guess it's okay.
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  Because you're all anti-racists, right?
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  I mean, who cares about a bit of collateral damage when there's a chance of killing Trump supporters?
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  Irma, girl, do us all a favor and skip all the countries you're gonna hit and just go after Trump and all the racist Republicans like Nazis.
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  Gracias.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  Please let Hurricane Irma destroy Florida for giving so many electoral votes to Trump.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  You need to destroy Florida. They voted for Trump.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  Now, I know what you're thinking. This is just a few idiots on Twitter, right? Nope.
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  If it's any consolation, Hurricane Irma might f*** up Trump's Caribbean mansion.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  The only silver lining is that while Irma ravages the Caribbean,
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  one building at risk is the president's $60.9 million 11-bedroom compound on Plum Bay and the French territory of St. Martin.
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  Just something funny to remember when Mar-a-Lago refuses to provide shelter to displaced Floridians on Friday.
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  Funny. Trump's not even gonna be there. He's got home insurance.
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  Those poor black people whose homes get demolished? Maybe not.
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  The Washington Post was also offering minute-by-minute coverage of all the Trump properties destroyed by the hurricane.
[28:08.000 --> 28:15.000]  The f*** is wrong with you. You're also triggered that Hurricane Harvey interrupted your race-baiting narrative for five minutes.
[28:15.000 --> 28:22.000]  Triggered that it proved the vast majority of people don't share your relentless obsession with identity politics.
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.000]  Triggered that when it comes to the crunch, people treat each other equally regardless of race.
[28:27.000 --> 28:33.000]  Triggered that just for a moment, your anti-Trump hysteria isn't the center of attention.
[28:33.000 --> 28:43.000]  That you'll literally wish death and destruction on innocent people just to satiate your need for yet another anti-Trump Twitter temper tantrum.
[28:43.000 --> 28:53.000]  And I want to be clear. Jennifer Lawrence is coming out saying we deserve it because we voted for Trump.
[28:53.000 --> 29:00.000]  You've got CNN out there basically saying that America deserves it because of global warming.
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.000]  You've got the New York Times saying it. I mean, this is just insane.
[29:05.000 --> 29:11.000]  We've had 15 years of some of the lowest hurricane activity reported since the 50s, but now they're back
[29:11.000 --> 29:19.000]  because the sun has been going out of a dormant phase the last 11, 12 years or so into another very active phase.
[29:19.000 --> 29:28.000]  And they've known for over 100 years sunspots, big giant ejections of radiation and heat coming into our atmosphere affects things.
[29:28.000 --> 29:36.000]  Yes, it's the sun, ladies and gentlemen, and it's the sun driving the earthquakes and all the rest of it.
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.000]  There's the big secret. But what's driving the political change?
[29:40.000 --> 29:45.000]  It's all connected in rhythms. It'll be back. Stay with us.
[29:48.000 --> 29:55.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.000 --> 30:06.000]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.000]  You're a white male. You're a white man.
[30:36.000 --> 30:42.000]  The most powerful host will be hearing from Alex Jones regularly as well as taking your phone calls.
[30:42.000 --> 30:46.000]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[30:46.000 --> 31:09.000]  The silent majority is no longer silent. This is the War Room.
[31:09.000 --> 31:17.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[31:17.000 --> 31:22.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[31:22.000 --> 31:29.000]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[31:29.000 --> 31:36.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[31:36.000 --> 31:43.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[31:43.000 --> 31:48.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[31:48.000 --> 31:51.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[31:51.000 --> 31:57.000]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.

[32:49.000 --> 32:52.000]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure.
[32:52.000 --> 32:58.000]  And rest secure, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the Infowars. That's InfowarsLife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[32:58.000 --> 33:00.000]  Take action now before we sell out.
[33:07.000 --> 33:09.000]  It's Friday.
[33:09.000 --> 33:21.000]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[33:21.000 --> 33:23.000]  Nancy.
[33:23.000 --> 33:25.000]  Hi.
[33:25.000 --> 33:27.000]  Prison time's coming soon. Be ready.
[33:27.000 --> 33:29.000]  What's going on here?
[33:29.000 --> 33:32.000]  Not much time left. Bad news for you.
[33:44.000 --> 33:47.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  You're a white male.
[33:49.000 --> 33:54.000]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  Move, bitch! Get out the way!
[33:58.000 --> 34:05.000]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  I'll let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[34:21.000 --> 34:27.000]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.000]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones.
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.000]  We're going to open the phones up throughout the broadcast now.
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.000]  Interspersed with different news, different important topics.
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  I want to hear from callers specifically.
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  Now, I don't screen your calls.
[34:45.000 --> 34:51.000]  Occasionally, I do say, hey, I'd like to talk about the Earth Changes Hurricane Irma,
[34:51.000 --> 34:56.000]  more storms forming out in the Atlantic and the Pacific.
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.000]  The record earthquakes, the strongest earthquake ever recorded in 100 years,
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.000]  with seismographs in Mexico and Central America, an 8.2.
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  Some estimates are even higher now.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  Was a 7-something did that to Fukushima?
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  I mean, this is serious. Thank God it was out in the ocean.
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  Still killed 30-something people.
[35:17.000 --> 35:23.000]  Why are there all these Earth Changes?
[35:23.000 --> 35:29.000]  How does all this tie in together with the quickening, the move towards the singularity,
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.000]  and what do you expect to see come out of Irma?
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  Because we've got Leanne McAdoo in Florida.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  We've also got Quentin Carter, two of our crew members.
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.000]  And whether you're on the West Coast or the Panhandle or the East Coast,
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  the stores are all empty. The gas is almost all gone.
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  Some areas completely gone.
[35:49.000 --> 35:54.000]  Giant lines going out of Miami and other areas and out of the Keys.
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  Of cars going 5, 10 miles an hour.
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.000]  We've got video of that from last night where you see almost no cars going south,
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  and all the cars going north.
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  Just biblical images.
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.000]  And imagine if there was really a nuclear war, even a limited nuclear war,
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  and our big cities got hit.
[36:14.000 --> 36:18.000]  Or imagine if a mass plague got out, a flesh-eating bacteria,
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  or this new super pneumonia that's been found, according to Lancet,
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  that basically almost kills everybody that comes in contact with it,
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  is airborne and is spreading and replicating ultra-fast.
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  It's the most deadly hands-down pneumonia ever seen.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  Everybody was always so scared of a super airborne pneumonia
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  that replicates fast and is drug-resistant.
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  It's here.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  So we have this incredibly complex society with just-on-time delivery,
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.000]  and the slightest things can disrupt it.
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.000]  And now we see storm-hitting Texas, storm-hitting Florida.
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.000]  And it's not a minority of Democrats sharing the storms on,
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  making fun of Texas, saying die Rednecks, die Nazis,
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  die Trump voters in Florida.
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.000]  It's Hollywood Star saying America deserves it because of Trump.
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.000]  It's reporters. It's CNN. It's MSNBC.
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  You've all seen it. You've all heard it.
[37:15.000 --> 37:21.000]  What type of sick people are these?
[37:21.000 --> 37:27.000]  So the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[37:27.000 --> 37:33.000]  800-259-9231.
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.000]  Hurricane Irma is set to make landfall Monday morning,
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.000]  according to NOAA, at 8 a.m. Sunday.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  8 a.m. Sunday.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  We're going to have live special broadcast tomorrow.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  That'll be internet-only, not on radio and TV,
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  but infowars.com, forward slash show on the front page of the site,
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  newswars.com.
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  We'll tweet it out at Real Alex Jones.
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  We'll send it out to folks that are on the newsletter,
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  infowars.com, forward slash newsletter.
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  It's free. We'll send you those live video links.
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  We're going to have live coverage tomorrow.
[38:05.000 --> 38:10.000]  We're going to have live coverage continuing continually.
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.000]  Sunday morning at 8 a.m. Eastern, 7 a.m. Central.
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  And I'm going to be up here broadcasting throughout the day,
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  not just the broadcast, 4 to 6 p.m.
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  We're going to be broadcasting right through as this mega storm hits.
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.000]  I'm going to be here with Owen Shroyer and some of the other crew
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  as we chronicle this.
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  And as I said a week ago, and as I said yesterday,
[38:37.000 --> 38:42.000]  watch for earthquakes, watch for volcanoes, watch for more,
[38:42.000 --> 38:48.000]  because massive, they're saying record level solar storms,
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  that's big giant coronal mass ejections.
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  Some of these mass ejections, when they come off the sun,
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  are 100, 200 times bigger than the Earth.
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  You can just YouTube solar flares, satellite,
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  5th footage of solar flares.
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  They've got them in HD now.
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.000]  And I mean you're talking about million mile plus long ejections
[39:11.000 --> 39:18.000]  when they're still at the absolute hottest temperature known to man.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  And then that heat just goes out.
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  It's like you're in front of a fire, you're 5 feet away,
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.000]  but it's burning your face because it's a big hot fire with white gold.
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.000]  So the flames are only going out a million miles.
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  Let's see, the heat and the radiation, it's going out even further
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  and hitting the Earth.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  So NASA just captured the strongest solar flare in a decade,
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  and this just happened last year.
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  So again, the sun is going from a dormant phase
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  when things were cooling down, things were heating up until about 20 years ago.
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  Then it kind of started cooling off and went through its dormant phase.
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  Now it's going back into its warming phase,
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  and you're going to have more precipitation,
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  you're going to have more hurricanes.
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  And by the way, I'm not a meteorologist.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  I've had top meteorologists and top astrophysicists on.
[40:06.000 --> 40:11.000]  You know the U.S. military doesn't get its weather reports from your mainline meteorologists.
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  They have astrophysicists that take the data in
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  and then put it into models about the moon and the sun.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  You go, well, what's the moon radiating?
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  It gets in front of the sun, it blocks the winds, the solar winds.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  It gets away from the Earth, it doesn't block them.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  There have been cases when giant solar flares are about to hit us and the moon blocks it.
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  But what happens when the moon isn't blocking it?
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  You say, but the moon's much smaller than us.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  How could it block the whole Earth?
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  Well, it's just like if you put your finger in a water hose when it's blasting out,
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  it shoots out around and makes a big cone.
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.000]  I've seen some of these spectrometer analysis, radio telescope.
[40:47.000 --> 40:52.000]  You name it, scans of the solar flares picking up the particles, the particle readers.
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.000]  I'm not a scientist, I've just read the articles and you'll see the spectrum of it
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.000]  and it's shooting around way around the Earth.
[41:00.000 --> 41:06.000]  The moon can completely block us from solar flares when it's turned towards the flare.
[41:06.000 --> 41:11.000]  But when it's not turned towards the flare, so see, this is what really goes on in the government.
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  Not the stuff they put on TV for the public.
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  When you're watching the weather report, it should be the sun and the moon and big models.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  But see, they don't want you to know that.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  They want to teach you it's your fault.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  Your cows farted.
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.000]  In Canada and Australia, they now are putting bags.
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  People don't believe me, just type in bags put on cows to capture methane.
[41:33.000 --> 41:39.000]  And they put bags on their butts and then they capture the methane and pump it into oil wells
[41:39.000 --> 41:45.000]  that have been sealed to seal it under the Earth as part of a carbon agreement.
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  Those are some powerful shots of the sun they're showing.
[41:48.000 --> 41:54.000]  Guys, we've even got a big model of the sun with flares that we've played from NASA.
[41:54.000 --> 41:59.000]  Just, if you go to YouTube, they've got an HD, it's just solar flares
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  and it's a shot from the side of the sun and you'll see them how far they're going out.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  But everybody knows about that.
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  The point is, is that I've had all the top astrophysicists on.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  Probably had 15 of them all over the years.
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  These are the guys that actually advise the governments, advise the military.
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  They look at the ground radar stuff and then they add it into computations
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  and they found that humans are better at this than even computers.
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.000]  They'll take computers to crunch a bunch of numbers and then an expert walks in,
[42:25.000 --> 42:30.000]  looks at it and then dead reckons what they think and they still found the human supercomputer
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  that just going with its gut instinct when looking at what computers already gave it
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  is more accurate than the big supercomputer modeling.
[42:37.000 --> 42:43.000]  That's why governments still go to men and women to get their final analysis
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  of the computer algorithms.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  It's incredible.
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  Alright, I'm ranting.
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.000]  I need to get into the other subject.
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.000]  800-259-9231.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  We will be tracking all of this today.
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.000]  Now, let me get to this first.
[43:02.000 --> 43:09.000]  As political intrigue goes, everything is blowing up in the Democrats' faces now.
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  Comey's been caught perjuring himself to Congress over and over again.
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  You've got Hillary with all of her corruptions starting to come out.
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  You've got the Democratic Party top people saying Hillary needs to go away.
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.000]  She is universally hated.
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  And with this backdrop, you've got the Awan brothers trying to flee the country
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  and now we know that one of them planted the laptop for the police
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.000]  with a letter explaining the crimes that were being committed by Debbie Wasserman Schultz reportedly.
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.000]  All of this is happening.
[43:42.000 --> 43:49.000]  And then meanwhile, you've got Trump going up against the Republican Party establishment
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.000]  who gave us Obamacare, who gave us the hot taxes.
[43:53.000 --> 43:58.000]  Even though Trump has the trifecta, the Republican Party's playing God,
[43:58.000 --> 44:07.000]  the blue blood traitors like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan.
[44:07.000 --> 44:13.000]  And so Trump's genius level went to the Democrats to get a three-month stay
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.000]  so our credit rating doesn't get dropped, but the globalists want.
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  And so we get the aid for the hurricane.
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  I get we're always raising the debt limit.
[44:21.000 --> 44:27.000]  The point is if you don't raise it now, we should have lowered it in the past,
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  the globalists are going to use it to stall the economy.
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  So Trump knows what he's doing.
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  And Pat Buchanan has come out and said he agrees with that analysis.
[44:34.000 --> 44:40.000]  Trump dumps the do nothing Congress and lets the Republicans know they're not in full control.
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  Now, that's the Republican leadership.
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  The Freedom Caucus are great patriots.
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  We need to take over more of those seats.
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.000]  We need to get rid of the rhinos.
[44:47.000 --> 44:50.000]  There's a big move to get rid of Paul Ryan right now.
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  It's very exciting.
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.000]  But that said, I'm supporting Trump because he'd already lowered the deficit some.
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  He'd already gotten the economy going.
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  He's pushing for the tax cuts.
[44:59.000 --> 45:00.000]  They've been blocking him.
[45:00.000 --> 45:06.000]  So he has to strategically do this so that Moody's, Standard & Poor's and others don't lower our credit rating.
[45:06.000 --> 45:12.000]  Because if that happens, the debt will balloon even more and will be absolutely untenable.
[45:12.000 --> 45:17.000]  The answer is getting the tax cuts, then freezing the spending increases.
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  But you've got to get the tax cuts first.
[45:19.000 --> 45:24.000]  And Trump's been delivering on his promises when he's able to get it done.
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  The point is the big banks, the central banks are trying to crash the economy right now.
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  They're raising interest rates for everything they can to stall things.
[45:31.000 --> 45:36.000]  And Trump going around the Republicans now, while doing what he said he would do on the dreamers,
[45:36.000 --> 45:40.000]  securing our borders, not letting Obama sign executive orders or illegal,
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.000]  putting it back to Congress to make it really people that were here when they were kids,
[45:43.000 --> 45:49.000]  and not 40-year-old men with 25 deportations and murder wraps.
[45:49.000 --> 45:55.000]  They're trying to make Congress do its job and pass a real law for true dreamers.
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.000]  That the media misrepresents what Trump did again there.
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  And I'm not just defending the President, this is the reality.
[46:00.000 --> 46:07.000]  But here's Stephen Bannon in an excerpt coming up on 60 Minutes this weekend,
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  where he explains who the real enemy is.
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.000]  The Democrats are literally a bunch of senile criminals.
[46:13.000 --> 46:16.000]  Nancy Pelosi, the rest of them, who are dangerous.
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.000]  But it's the Republican leadership that are slick, Ted Bundy-type psychopaths
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  who are really screwing everybody over.
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  And Trump is a true centrist, a populist, he is going after them.
[46:27.000 --> 46:36.000]  He's a populist, Americanist, and Bannon gets into the fact that Mitch McConnell won't even meet with Trump.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  Mitch McConnell says, stop saying drain the swamp.
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.000]  This is in meetings dictating to the President, because they want to keep the swamp there.
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  They want to keep two parties in power.
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  With the one party monopoly of the banks.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  They're there to stop the American Revolution.
[46:50.000 --> 46:55.000]  So they're trying to block Trump, both political parties, Hollywood, the power structure, everybody.
[46:55.000 --> 47:02.000]  Which again, to all the stupid mainline liberals, the mainline Republican establishment hates Trump dummies.
[47:02.000 --> 47:07.000]  The big foreign banks hating the Saudi Arabians, the globalists, the communist Chinese.
[47:07.000 --> 47:11.000]  All the real killers hate this, because this is a real revolution.
[47:11.000 --> 47:16.000]  It's not perfect, but it's real, and that's why it's got the whole stinking power structure
[47:16.000 --> 47:22.000]  that owns the suicide factories in China up on their hind legs.
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  But again, you've been caught in a hype train.
[47:26.000 --> 47:31.000]  Here is Stephen Bannon. Mitch McConnell just demanded no more drain the swamp.
[47:31.000 --> 47:35.000]  This is on infowars.com and newswars.com. Here it is.
[47:35.000 --> 47:41.000]  The Republican establishment is trying to nullify the 2016 election.
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  That's a brutal fact we have to face.
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  The Republican establishment wants to nullify the 2016 election.
[47:47.000 --> 47:50.000]  Trying to nullify the 2016 election. Absolutely.
[47:50.000 --> 47:51.000]  Who?
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.000]  I think Mitch McConnell to a degree, Paul Ryan.
[47:54.000 --> 48:01.000]  They do not want Donald Trump's populist, economic, nationalist agenda to be implemented.
[48:01.000 --> 48:06.000]  It's very obvious. It's obvious as night follows day.
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  Give me a story that illustrates that.
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.000]  Well, Mitch McConnell, when he first met him, he said, I think, in one of the first meetings
[48:13.000 --> 48:18.000]  in Trump Tower with the president as we're wrapping up, he basically says,
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.000]  I don't want to hear any more of this drain the swamp talk.
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  It could have flat out.
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.000]  He goes, a guy up on Capitol Hill came by a Coke unless he's got to be reported.
[48:27.000 --> 48:32.000]  He says, I can't hire any smart people because everybody's all over them for reporting requirements
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.000]  and the pay, et cetera, and the scrutiny.
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  You know, you got to back off them.
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  The drain the swamp thing was, Mitch McConnell was day one.
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  Did not want to go there, wanted us to back off.
[48:43.000 --> 48:50.000]  You are attacking on many fronts, people who you need to help you to get things done.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  They're not going to help you unless they're put on notice.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  They're going to be held accountable if they do not support the president of the United States.
[48:56.000 --> 48:57.000]  There's no accountability.
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  They have totally, they do not support the president's program.
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  It's an open secret on Capitol Hill.
[49:02.000 --> 49:03.000]  Everybody in the city knows it.
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  And so, therefore, now that you're out of the White House, you go into war with them.
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  Absolutely.
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  And they go, oh, he's in a war.
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  He's in an info war.
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  He's violent.
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.000]  They're the ones saying kill the president.
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.000]  They're the ones trying to organize it.
[49:14.000 --> 49:20.000]  They're the ones saying they're going to impeach him and nullify the election and removing.
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  They're the ones saying they're going to use Comey and Mueller and all their perjury and all their lies
[49:24.000 --> 49:30.000]  and all their fake memos that they admit are frauds that they told Congress two different stories on.
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  We're going to go to break and come back with an investigation into that.
[49:33.000 --> 49:39.000]  And then your phone calls that we're going to document how Comey rigged the Hillary investigation
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  and admitted he did.
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  And he's been caught doing it.
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[49:44.000 --> 49:50.000]  We've got live continual coverage at newswars.com, prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[49:50.000 --> 49:57.000]  on what's unfolding right now with Hurricane Irma, the aftermath of Harvey, the big earthquake,
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  the record earthquake, works over recorded in Mexico, and more.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  And we've got, again, our reporters out there filming on the horizon.
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  We've got McAdoo, Leon McAdoo, and Quentin Carter on the ground.
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  They'll be reporting.
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  But we had reporters and people that were reporting from Dominican Republic and stuff.
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  And when the storm hit, no more communication the last day.
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.000]  So this is a classic Imperial troops have entered the base.
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  And then the mic feed gets cut off.
[50:23.000 --> 50:26.000]  So pray for everybody seriously in Florida.
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  And if you can, evacuate.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  But a lot of poor people and others can.
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.000]  A lot of folks have dogs and cats, and they don't have a place to go.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  And the highways are clogged.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  And it's just incredible.
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  So the number one thing you can do, because it really works, is pray for the folks in South Texas,
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.000]  but especially now, folks that are about to get hit in Florida.
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  Because the storm track is clear.
[50:46.000 --> 50:53.000]  It's going to t-bone the state and drive like a running back, like Earl Campbell,
[50:53.000 --> 51:19.000]  right up the middle of that state.
[51:19.000 --> 51:26.000]  And that's it for today.
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  Call 888-597-0-775.

[54:10.000 --> 54:15.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to get this report on the incredible obstruction of justice
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.000]  and political targeting of Comey and Mueller.
[54:18.000 --> 54:24.000]  Jose has been upgraded to category 4. It is out in the Atlantic too on the same track as Irma.
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.000]  This is just biblical and there's another storm behind it.
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  It's a category 3 right now.
[54:29.000 --> 54:35.000]  Just briefly, we're not doubling prices like Amazon did on emergency supplies and storeable foods
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  that are questionable value in many cases.
[54:37.000 --> 54:43.000]  We are cutting prices 50% on all the storeable food at m4store.com
[54:43.000 --> 54:48.000]  with promo code IRMA and 30% off on water filtration systems.
[54:48.000 --> 54:55.000]  And more and your purchase also supports the broadcast m4store.com or AAA-253-3139.
[54:55.000 --> 55:24.000]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[55:25.000 --> 55:31.000]  Two Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham noted that Comey had begun drafting his statement
[55:31.000 --> 55:36.000]  recommending not to charge Mrs. Clinton long before interviewing key aides in the investigation.
[55:36.000 --> 55:39.000]  In a letter to the FBI, the Senators wrote,
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.000]  Conclusion first, fact gathering second. That's no way to run an investigation.
[55:43.000 --> 55:46.000]  The FBI should be held to a higher standard than that,
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  especially in a matter of such great public interest and controversy.
[55:50.000 --> 55:57.000]  The details of Comey's premature exoneration were revealed as a result of the Office of Special Counsel's investigation
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.000]  into Comey's possible violation of the Hatch Act,
[56:00.000 --> 56:05.000]  which prohibits government employees from using their official position to influence an election.
[56:05.000 --> 56:12.000]  During that investigation, heavily redacted transcripts of interviews of two FBI officials close to Comey,
[56:12.000 --> 56:20.000]  James Rebicki, Comey's Chief of Staff, and Trisha Anderson, the Principal Deputy General Counsel of National Security and Cyber Law,
[56:20.000 --> 56:28.000]  indicated that Comey began drafting a statement to announce the conclusion of the Clinton email investigation in April or May of 2016,
[56:28.000 --> 56:37.000]  before the FBI interviewed up to 17 key witnesses, including former Secretary Clinton and several of her closest aides.
[56:37.000 --> 56:42.000]  The transcript of what appears to be Mr. Rebicki's interview contains the following exchanges,
[56:42.000 --> 56:49.000]  and he sent a draft round of, you know, what it might look like. So that was in early spring.
[56:49.000 --> 56:56.000]  Yeah, and I think we've seen maybe that email where he sent it out. It was early May of 2016. Does that sound about right?
[56:56.000 --> 57:01.000]  Rebicki, that sounds right. Quite honestly, that strikes me as a little late.
[57:01.000 --> 57:08.000]  The transcript of what appears to be Ms. Anderson's interview states, when did you first learn that Director Comey was planning
[57:08.000 --> 57:14.000]  to make some kind of public statement about the outcome of the Clinton email investigation? Answer.
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  I believe it was in early May of 2016 that the director himself wrote a draft of that statement.
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  Questions. So when you found out in early May that there was, that the director had written a draft of what the statement might look like,
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.000]  how did you learn about that? Answer. Redacted. Gave me a hard copy of it. Question.
[57:32.000 --> 57:38.000]  So what happened next with respect to the draft? Answer. I don't know for sure. I don't know.
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  At some point, there were many iterations of the draft that circulated.
[57:42.000 --> 57:48.000]  The draft statement also came before the department entered into immunity agreements with Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson,
[57:48.000 --> 57:56.000]  where the department agreed to a very limited review of Secretary Clinton's emails and to destroy their laptops after review.
[57:56.000 --> 58:01.000]  In an extraordinary July announcement, Comey exonerated Clinton despite noting,
[58:01.000 --> 58:08.000]  there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information.
[58:08.000 --> 58:15.000]  Clinton, last week it was reported on infowars.com that your email server was hacked and you knowingly continued to use your email server.
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.000]  Can you comment on that? Yeah, it's totally untrue. Totally.
[58:19.000 --> 58:28.000]  All this as the Wasserman Schultz IT debacle unfolds and the Clinton Foundation could face the possibility of international investigations
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  over their administration of Unitate funds.
[58:31.000 --> 58:50.000]  John Bown reporting for infowars.com.
[59:02.000 --> 59:08.000]  Research across the board is clear. In fact, it's certified.
[59:08.000 --> 59:13.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[59:13.000 --> 59:20.000]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[59:20.000 --> 59:34.000]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[59:34.000 --> 59:41.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver and more.

[59:52.000 --> 01:00:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  Hurricane Irma scheduled to hit Sunday at 8 a.m.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  I'm going to do some live transmissions tomorrow here from the infowars news center in central Texas.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  And then we intend to go live right here out of the studio with a skeleton crew this Sunday.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  I'll already be up here 4 to 6 p.m., but I intend to do live transmissions throughout the day with whoever in the crew volunteers to be here to track this as it unfolds.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  I want to go to your phone calls now in this hour.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  Frank, Carlos, Anthony, Gary, Raider and others, the toll free number to join us is 800-25-99231.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  I'm going to recap the latest developments with the hurricane more at the start of the next segment.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  There's also a lot of big geopolitical activities going on.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  ISIS on the left is celebrating the hurricanes.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  I mean, Mainline, Hollywood stars, CNN saying America deserves it.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  These are just people that hate the country.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  It's why they work for the foreign banks that hijack the nation.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  You wonder why they're so hateful.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  You got to hire folks that hate the country and hate prosperity because they want to rob you.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  They're scum.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  So that's all coming up as well.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  Leanne McAdoo is in Florida.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  She's going to be popping in.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  We've got Owen Schreuer coming in a little bit later.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  The video of a little girl, she looks like she's maybe 10 years old telling him to f off when he's out just asking questions at a anti-trump rally last weekend.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  That got picked up everywhere.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  I mean, a bunch of his videos got seen.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  It's like 20 million times now.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  One video is like 15 million.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  One version is like 11 million.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  But this has been seen millions of times now.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  This little, what is she, 10?
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  But that's not the news.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  It's them celebrating.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  It's the celebrating.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  Oh, she's such a good girl.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  It's so good to have our kids not answer his questions, but just flip him off because that's the reporter that says there's Mars bases with slaves on it.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  Never said that.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  Alex Jones is the one that said there's Martian bases.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  Okay, so say that we're wrong about Martian bases.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  Don't just say FU, but that's what the adults do.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  They celebrate that the response is FU Nazi FU.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  Because they're so genteel and trendy and nice and loving, but have even criticized a trendy on YouTube.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  They try to ban you, but they're allowed to say FU and all the rest of it.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  So that's coming up.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  Let's go to Truth Raider in Oregon as we're about to go to break.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  Yeah, the next two minutes, Truth Raider.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  Love the calls.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  That old Truth Raider.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  Yep.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  I think I'm going to just sit here while he's on the line for a while just to see what happens because that's why I love taking calls.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  Sometimes they're the very best.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  Sometimes they're the very worst.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  Bad phones aren't listening when you go to them.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  Just crazy.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  Let's let him go.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  Now we're going to get refocused.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  No, no, we're done with the caller.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  We're done with that caller.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  Thank you.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Now, everybody knows why I don't take a lot of calls.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  Because they're frustrating.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  They're very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very frustrating.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  Because we'll have the best callers in the world.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  And then we'll have callers that are drunk on cough syrup and aren't listening and got bad phones and aren't there and aren't listening and have no idea what planet they're on.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  And it just puts me through a meat grinder.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  And I know it puts you through a meat grinder.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  But today's the day that we're going to take calls on the subject of weather changes and this hurricane and how it shows how tenuous civilization is.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  And we're going to, because the good calls are amazing and they bring up topics and angles and breaking news that I would have never thought about.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  And they add real spice to the transmission.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  Whenever I say we're on a certain subject, though, we get great callers.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  When I say free for all, God help us.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  So we're going to execute this on the other side.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  In fact, I may just give out our number here and do the calls here.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  It's not that GCN's bad, but they got one guy running the board up there and taking the calls.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  And I think we may just do that because we've got to rework this situation because every other call is going to do that.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  They're going to sit there like they got hit in the head with a ton of bricks.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  Like their brains are all over the ground.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  Their hearts stopped pumping 50 years ago.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000]  We've never offered super male vitality, non-concentrated herbs, cold pressed, super male vitality, 57% off.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  It's never been the price.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  It is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third party sites, unprecedented.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  And it's cold pressed.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  That's why super male is so different.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  These are what you sell.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  Buzzfeed said it's already best selling stuff.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  Why these aren't anything new?
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best but cold pressed?
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  and winning because of your support.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  Caveman is back in stock.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  People absolutely love it.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  So please secure your caveman today at infowarslife.com
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  or by calling toll-free, CRIPLE-A-253-3139.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  Dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  Harvestrite freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  Harvestrite is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  Check it out right now at infowarstore.com.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  Hurricane Irma with two more hurricanes.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  Jose now upgraded to Category 4 and another as a Category 3, lined up behind it.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  Strongest hurricane ever recorded, over 185 miles an hour, 48 hours away.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  Miami in the bullseye, fuel runs out as residents try to flee Irma up to 12-foot storm surge.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  South Beach is now a ghost town.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  All Florida residents should be prepared to evacuate.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  One of the largest mass exodus in the nation's history.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  Power could be out for days, weeks, or months.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  Miami live television, Channel 4, 6, 7, 10.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  We've got mirrored links as well on our Irma watch page on newswars.com.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  We're going to make news wars today and through the weekend, one of the main centers there.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  We're updating the site right now with mainly hurricane news.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  And we're going to have live video feeds posted up to that throughout Saturday and Sunday,
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  not just the Sunday broadcast I do, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  And all of our affiliates are welcome to grab the audio and video feeds.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  Obviously, this show is free to air.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  A lot of stations want an affiliate agreement.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  And, you know, we do those, but my show, my TV program, flash radio program,
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  is going to a free to air format here very, very quickly.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  So we're very, very easy to deal with.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  Meanwhile, North Korea is being hit with more sanctions.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  Mexico's kicked their ambassador out and closed down their embassy.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  And surprisingly, North Korea has done a lot of business with Mexico.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  North Korea has set to test more missiles this weekend, but a solar storm brewing is set to maybe shut that down
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  and block the avionics that they would use for the trajectory of the ICBM
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  because they're using more primitive systems of radio control.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  So mass solar storms, record earthquake, 8.2 on the Richter scale in southern Mexico,
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  northern Central America, into Guatemala, death toll well above 30, pray for those folks down in Mexico.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  So a lot happening. Why is it all happening at once?
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Well, the sun goes through different cycles.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  And it's got a 20-something year phase and 11-year phase.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  But we've been going out of the 11-year phase of the sun having less solar spots and cooling.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  And now it's having record spots again.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  What's the spot? It's a mass coronal ejection, sometimes hundreds of times the size of the Earth blasting out in the space.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  And when we get a direct hit, it's not the actual heat or the flame anymore, but it's the ions.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  It's the radiation. It's the storm.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  It can fry satellites, as everybody knows.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  It can sometimes be so strong, it can kill or sicken astronauts.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  But we have an atmosphere of about 15 feet of water.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  If you condense the first 35,000 feet together, it's about 15 feet of water, about an inch or two of dust.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  So we have the equivalent of a rock shield, an inch of rock shield, 12 feet of water to 15 feet of water.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  And that blocks us. If you condense it all together, that's what's in our atmosphere.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  That's why you go up on a 20,000-foot mountain or 15,000-foot mountain.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  You get sunburned so easy, so much quicker, because the sun is that much stronger.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  Why are we seeing record hurricanes?
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  They're always associated with when we're turned towards the sun in this hemisphere, the summer, into the winter.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  I mean, into the fall, when the water has gotten its hottest, at the peak of the summer, into the fall.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  That's when it peaks, basic meteorology.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  But then you add the sun, which is, again, already driving the hurricane, and you add mass coronal ejections and the particles coming into the atmosphere.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  That then forms more nuclei, and we get these megastorms.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  It's the sun. You can pay carbon taxes to Al Gore and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton all day and Lord Rothschild.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  You can pray to the Church of Climate Change.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  You can buy your carbon indulgences, but it's not going to change it.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  Because the sun is 99 percent, according to top astrophesicists, meteorologists, and computer models, 99 percent of the weather change and climate on this earth.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  Less than 1 percent is humans and volcanic activity.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  Humans and volcanic, and it's estimated, just look at it for yourself, and so many studies will make your head spin, that of that 1 percent, volcanoes are almost all up.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  One volcano, one big gaseous Mount St. Helens explosion, like Mount St. Helens in 1980, is the equivalent of more than a decade of human output.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  Look it up. So we're not even 1 percent.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  That big giant sun, how many thousands of times bigger isn't than the earth?
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  You go out at noon, you lay out in it, it burns your skin.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  You can cook eggs on the side of the asphalt with it, but the UN says it has nothing to do with the climate.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  It's 100 percent you, and you're to blame.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  You, geo-engineered. You're the weather weapon.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  Oh, but government with systems that can manipulate the weather, manipulate what the sun has already created, they can nudge it and steer it.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  That's been declassified for decades.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  Oh, let's not look at that.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  That's kooky. It's you individually.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  Now, I want to go to your phone calls. We're going to do it after the break.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  The toll-free number is 800-25-99-231.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  And we're specifically taking calls on the earth changes, the earthquakes, the sun.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  But why do political changes always line up with this as well?
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  And why are total eclipses of the sun associated with it as well, historically, even by mainline historians?
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  Frank and Carlos and Anthony and Gary and Jacob, your calls are coming up on the other side of this break.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  But first, I want to get to this report by John Bowne on DACA.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  It's such a hoax that this is a racist thing to do.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  Mexico doesn't care if you claim you've been down there for 20 years, but you weren't born there.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  You don't get citizenship.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  Until recently, you could even own land in Mexico unless you were born there, because they didn't want people to come in and take over their country.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  Every other nation's been like that.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  The UN admits that they want open borders to collapse Western societies and exploit the third-world populations, not empower them.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  So all Trump did was say, I don't care if you actually were here since you were a kid.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  You can prove it. You're not a criminal. You can stay.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  But Congress has got to pass a law to do it, and there's got to be vetting.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  You're not going to call 45-year-old men that have been deported, sometimes 40-plus times, who are born in Mexico.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  We're deporting them.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  Obama just can't sign an executive order like a predator, like a king.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  So here's the clip.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  I'm here today to announce that the program known as DACA that was effectuated under the Obama administration is being rescinded.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  The policy was implemented unilaterally to great controversy and legal concern,
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  but Congress rejected legislative proposals to extend similar benefits on numerous occasions to this same group of illegal aliens.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  In other words, the executive branch, through DACA, deliberately sought to achieve what the legislative branch specifically refused to authorize on multiple occasions.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  Deferred action for childhood arrivals. It's a political hot potato that is open to a variety of possible outcomes.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  Dreamers, supporters of dreamers, say this is cold-hearted. You're leaving the future of 800,000 people uncertain, up in the air.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  What's your message to them?
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  It's not cold-hearted for the president to uphold the law. We are a nation of law and order.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  And the day that we start to ignore the fact that we are that, then we throw away everything that gives these people a reason to want to come to our country.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  I have a love for these people, and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  And I can tell you, in speaking to members of Congress, they want to be able to do something and do it right.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  Meanwhile, President Trump and his cabinet are being savaged by the left, regardless that former President Obama is ultimately to blame for unconstitutionally bypassing Congress back in 2012
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  by exaggerating the implementation of prosecutorial discretion and expanding DACA for roughly 800,000 illegal minors.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  Ultimately, this is about basic decency. Again, this is former President Barack Obama. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  or whether we treat them the way we want our own kids to be treated. It's about who we are as a people and who we want to be.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  Left deaf to the common sense of enforcing our immigration laws is firing back with legal hubris.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  The Hill reports 14 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Wednesday against President Trump's decision to roll back the previous administration's deferred action for childhood arrivals.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said in announcing the suit,
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  the president has made numerous statements on the campaign trail and in office disparaging Mexicans.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  We allege the president's own statements make clear that dreamers are being targeted based on their national origin. What a stretch.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  The onus is on the left for the entire situation, whether they admit it or not.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  Obama played his Selenskite hand in order to divide the country and garner grateful illegal alien voters for the Democrats.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  Let's be clear. This is not amnesty. This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  This is a temporary stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  Obama's indulgence has backfired big time. Had the unconstitutional law not been implemented, then the 800,000 DACA minors wouldn't be forced to live in the shadows.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  They came here to live in the shadows and we're not denying them that opportunity to live in the shadows.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  If you're going to waive the application of the law to groups of people, it is amnesty. And amnesty in America with regard to immigration is a reward for immigration lawbreakers.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  And it is a pardon for immigration lawbreakers coupled with the reward of the objective of their crime.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  The U.S. boasts 37 million legal immigrants at a rate of 1 million per year. Our doors aren't closed. Regardless of the left in the mainstream media's collusion, to make it appear so, John Bound reporting for Infowars.com.

[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  We're about to go to Frank Carlos, Anthony, Gary, Jacob and others and as soon as you hear me hang up on one of these great callers, there's your chance to call in.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  I'd like to hear from you specifically if you're in Florida, just what you're expecting to happen. I'm trying to get a hold of one of my guys whose wife lives part-time out in Florida. He's out there checking on their house.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  But he's there dealing with their four dogs and everything deciding on whether they're going to evacuate because they're on a little island that has a little causeway into the mainland and they're deciding whether they're going to evacuate or not because they close it at 3 o'clock today.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  And he's not answering the phone. Either the cell phones aren't getting through because there's so many people using them or he's too busy trying to decide and that's fine.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  It's just that if it hits land as a category four or five, it's just going to be biblical and it's the scale of it. Hopefully it dissipates quickly.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  The problem is there's a whole nother one, Jose, basically tracking the same way that just became a category four. And again, a hot summer, massive solar flare activity.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  The sun heats the water to begin with its regular rays, but when big giant super fireballs go out with all that radiation, what happens?
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  You get bigger hurricanes and I keep harping on this because nowhere in the news is there any discussion about the sun solar flares doing this.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  But if I get any astrophysicists on that all advise the weather channel and advise the British military and advise the Pentagon.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  They're all top people. You just never hear about them and they're hard to get on because there's such academics.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  They're the ones that make the final determinations with the sun and how it's connected to it and what the sun and moon are doing.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  And I just can't believe there's no discussion. I mean, here's one out of the Australian news.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  Solar storms threaten to put the brakes on North Korea's missiles so it can knock out the avionics on the missiles.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  It can cut out communication. I mean, we know it stops that. We know it knocks out satellites.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  But no discussion of what it does to the hurricanes. Instead, we're blamed.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  The sun is the main reason we have hurricanes. Period. It's not even debated in science.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  It heats the water in general and when it creates even more nuclei, it creates more water vapor in that current and it begins to spin faster and faster.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  Connected to the Coriolis effect of the planet. I'm not an astrophysicist. I've just interviewed a bunch of them.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  Alright, I'm going to stop ranting. Long segment coming up. I'll get up in probably one call in this segment.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  Who's up first here? You know, Carlos is up in Montreal. How about Gary? Because he's in Alabama. That's in the storm's path.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  Gary, what is your take on why we're seeing all this changing weather? Do you agree with me? It's the sun or do you think it's like the Democrats say God is cursing us?
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  It is all biblical. It goes back to Trump being elected. That was the wound to the beast's head. And it's all biblical. It's in the Bible.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  And that wound, it appears, kills the beast system and then it comes back even stronger. They think it's miraculous.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  Right. And they end up, a lot of people do because the religion, Satan, of course, has his hands in religion to our churches.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  End up following this false Christ, this false prophet. And if we would just study the Bible verse by verse chapter by chapter, it's all written.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  What do you think of Trump in general? Trump is fantastic. He is the wound to the beast's head. It's a sign for all of us to be on guard, pay attention.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  I tend to agree with you. Trump say last warning because God always warns you over and over and over again before you're put into bondage.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  Satan comes before Jesus. That's what we have to let everybody know. Satan comes before Jesus. He's coming to fool everybody and then Jesus will come back and bust his butt.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  Let me ask you this question, Gary. We know the sun's driving the earthquakes. We know it's driving the hurricanes. We know it's getting very active. We know that it's not us.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  But then why do political upheavals come before these type of astrophysical things historically?
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  Because we can scientifically show that the sun's coming in, not just the atmosphere, but radiation and different ions and different types of fields are going in, bouncing off the core, the nickel core of the earth, bouncing back out.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  That's why they see these northern light events even in Mexico right before this earthquake. It was reported by Reuters. So we know there's science there. But what explains the humans getting all agitated right before this happens?
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  It's the devil. He has his influence in our government, in our schools, in our finances, and in our churches. The science end of it. God's in control. He's in control.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  Oh, there's no doubt about that. There's no doubt about people trying to run this planet or not God, though they want to be. Thank you, Gary. Great points. Carlos, Frank, Jacob, Anthony. Stay with us. We'll be back.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:56.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:03.000]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:16.000]  You're a white male. You're a white man.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:57.000]  The most powerful host will be hearing from Alex Jones regularly as well as taking your phone calls. The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long. The silent majority is no longer silent. This is the war room.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:21.000]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core. Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium, but bio true selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:37.000]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known from supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight. Bio true selenium is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:51.000]  Visit infowarslife.com to order your bottle of bio true selenium before we sell it again. That's infowarslife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalist, A360WIN.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:57.000]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight. This is the time to support InfoWars. That's infowarslife.com.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  After being sold out for months, our best selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at infowarsstore.com. Research across the board is clear. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride. Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:47.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more. Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new bubble gum flavored super blue that is spearmint free.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:33:10.000]  Learn more about the new bubble gum flavored super blue toothpaste and more at infowarslife.com and support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  Leading of frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  Depending on the map you look at, it was an 8.1 or 8.2 magnitude earthquake hit southern Mexico, northern Guatemala. It was picked up by seismographs in Austin, Texas.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  We have three big hurricanes now floating around. One is out in the Atlantic. Jose is now in category four. We've got one on the southern coast of Mexico in the western Mediterranean named Katia, so I'm sure that's Vladimir Putin's fault. It's a Russian name.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  And then of course we've got Irma barreling down and right now the strongest part of the storm with 180 mile an hour winds is in between the islands and is set on its track to hit north central Cuba with devastating winds.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  And if it doesn't slow down a lot by the time it hits southern Florida and goes into Miami, if it's still a category five or four, I don't need to tell you what's going to happen. We have already seen one of the biggest evacuations in world history.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:54.000]  The images are ongoing. They're at infowars.com, newswars.com of just areas that look like ghost towns, empty stores, gas is gone, and highways choked down to five, 10 miles an hour. Some areas complete standstill as all of this is unfolding.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  I've already talked to some of the crew that we've already launched the last month, David Knight's new broadcast of 8am to 11am when I go on central, the real news and then Owen Schreuer comes on at three o'clock to six with the war room with Mike Cernovich and of course Roger Schoen and many others that contribute.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  But we are going to be busy bees. I'm going to come into Mara and do an update on the storm. And then we are going to go live 8am Eastern. That's when it makes landfall Sunday, 7am central with live feeds from the studios.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  That'll be open to our radio stations to pick up if you'd like. It'll be commercial free basically by commercials free. I won't have set breaks. And we're going to do a marathon live broadcast from 8am Eastern right through tomorrow until the evening.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  And then we'll be back obviously at 8am in the morning. We've got to let the crew rest. So I'm going right back to Jacob Frank, Carlos Anthony Levi and others.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  But before I do that, we're also going to be getting into the economy. Hillary Clinton cast Putin as a man spreader. We have the video and audio of that coming up. You cannot make this this type of stuff up.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  Former top Clinton fundraiser says Hillary in a public statement to the Hill should shut the F up and go away. But again, that just shows the incredible arrogance of these people that she will not go away.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  That is the hubris that is there and undoing two thirds of Americans are now getting most their news from social media. That's why a new study shows. That's why mainstream media is panicking.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  Because folks would rather watch what somebody shoots on Snapchat in Bermuda or Cuba.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  Or in Miami. Then they would on CNN because they just don't want the added filter of CNN's bull. That's why the mainstream media wants censorship is because they can't compete.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  But even if you're able to shut down drugs report or info wars.com or news wars.com, even if we're able to do that, you're not going to shut down the individuals who are all still going to be on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, their own little websites.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  But more and more like Matt Dredge said a year and a half ago when he was here, all of you need to buck the trend of everything being on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter or these other platforms because they're going to censor us there.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  You can have your platform there, but your main platform needs to be your own website where you control what's on it where it's on your servers or on your little service provider.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  Put yourself, it's like when the cloud came out 10 years ago, they said put everything on the cloud. I remember telling my family don't put your iPhone photos on the cloud.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  That is the most hackable thing. The corporations want that because they're already going in and getting your stuff. And it's all come out that they're just using your stuff.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  The hackers are getting into it. It is a giant disaster. Why would you want to store your photos and your videos out in some nebulous thing?
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  Like folks used to look at grandparents or great-grandparents and say they're kooks.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  They keep their money buried in the backyard or they keep some of it under the mattress or, you know, instead they just own real estate or they own restaurants or, you know, they invest in their family or they give their money away to charity.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  They don't trust big banks. That's because most people had their money taken in 1929 through 1935 or so.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  The government ordered gold physically confiscated, but folks wouldn't turn it in. So people have been through this before.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  And now you see banks taking people's money in Europe for bail-ins and now they're talking about doing it if Hillary would have gotten in.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  So not keeping your money in a bank or some of your money, you need to have, you know, eggs in different baskets.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  That's always the smartest thing, diversify. But not having your stuff on a cloud, that is just common sense, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  We don't keep anything associated with M4 Wars on a cloud.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  We may have basic videos and things that were put out to the public that's not private on clouds as backups.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  We don't keep anything that is supposedly going to be secure just floating around on some big giant supposedly secure system because they've been proven to be the most unsecure systems there are.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  We don't want to stop preaching. It's just that's some of the news we've got here.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  We're going to be going over there so much more. I'm going to be getting to.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  Before I go any further and take your calls, we are a listener-supported transmission.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  And because of you supporting us, we're changing the world.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  I want to thank you all for supporting us. And as you metric up the scale of your support, we're able to offer products, whether they be supplements, vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals, water filtration, air filtration, apparel made in America.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  We've also got it made overseas. It's your choice.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  We're able to offer it for lower and lower prices.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  We offer the Alexa Breeze four-stage Ion carbon, you name it, filter system for $200.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  That was $149 for a while, but you just can't do that forever because we don't make any money on that.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  Comparable units used to be $1,000. Now they've come down because of miniaturization and cost going down about $500.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  This baby out for two years is $200 down from $249. The others have dropped from $1,000 to $500. And this sucker is rated just as good as leading competitors that are greedy, that are sold online and in department stores.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  It has a 4.9 review. And since we put these in here, the air is so much better. And I don't want to get gross, but the guys joke around a certain person in the building, pass gas five feet from one, and it went from a big blue light.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  Looks like a robot on the front to red. Red is when it's really getting bad stuff. Then it goes down to purple, then to pink, then to blue.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  And it is amazing. The sensor alone should cost $200. Then it's got four filters. It's got a quiet mode, but it isn't as good then. We've got it turned up on high.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  Then you can barely hear it. I've got two in this studio because this is not a luxury. This is an essential for yourself and your family.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  You can just search engine. There are big studies out there from London and from Calcutta and from New York City, Manhattan, from all over the world. Mexico City especially is one of the worst because it's down on that bowl and the heat, kind of like Los Angeles is as well.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  The stuff gets trapped in there, all the particular, that people live on average seven to 12 years less depending on the study in a major city full of particular.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  So the biggest thing you can do for yourself is water filtration, air filtration, healthier food. None of us are perfect, but for your children, for your wife, for your husband, especially if you've got allergies on top of it.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  All the particular, weigh our body down and then finally all the plant particular, the pollen, the dust, our bodies just give up.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  So we have that unit, the Alexa Pure Breeze for $200, $199.95 at infowarstore.com. We have the Pro Pure G2 stainless steel gravity fed filter that cuts out all the garbage for 30% off right now.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  That's their biggest unit. We've got some of the smaller units discounted as well. And we have 50% off all of the MyPatriots supply food that we private label as info or select. It's how we're able to contractually get around the minimum pricing rules that we have agreements on.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  But let me tell you, a major arm twisting is happening because it's already super good price. But I'm really aggressive.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  So code word Irma, 50% off and we don't raise the price and then lower it and it's really 25%. This is 50% off the regular price. It's already smoking good.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  Infowarstore.com super high quality swarable foods dropship to you that basically the day you order from Utah, you order with us at the biggest discount that you're going to find anywhere with promo code Irma. So instead of gouging like Amazon on swarable food, water filtration, other things, flashlights, everything at Info Wars emergency related is 30 to 50% off.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  And those are real numbers info wars life.com and with North Korea and the economy and the globalist and the plans to assassinate Trump and the earth changes and all the quickenings that are happening.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  It's just good to have insurance you can eat. All right.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  Because when you look at what's happening in Florida, it shows you how tenuous civilization is and how a storm could put everything on edge or suddenly two storms are now another storm.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  Jose coming in could be as bad as Irma. I'm hoping everything turns out okay, but it's not fear mongering when mainstream media finally says this is a mega storm. This storm is nuclear. This storm is dangerous.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  Nuclear power plants are in the path of it. This could trigger a major problem because the sun again sends in all those different frequencies, all those different solar winds, all those different ions, all those different articles,
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:40.000]  smashing into our thin atmosphere, coming in, going into the earth's surface, going into the earth's core as the earth absorbs all that energy.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  And as that energy bounces back out, massive earthquakes as the radiation is coming in, ionizing, heating the water, but also creating more particular, more ionization to create more condensation to make the hurricanes that much stronger.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  That's what the perfect storm is. Hot weather from the sun heating back up and solar ejections. And I just keep repeating it because all over the news they're blaming you and I saying this proves Al Gore's right that we have a big storm.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  All the debunking of Al Gore's baloney in serious books and documentaries is about the sun. Now I will stop preaching out of your calls.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  Let's go to, let me see, Levi is Florida, north of Orlando. Then we'll go to Carlos, Frank and others. Levi, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex? Can you hear me?
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  Yes, sir. So what are you expecting?
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  For the hurricane, nothing much. I believe it's going to be a category one or two when it hits where I'm at. So I don't think it'll be too bad, but neighbors are boarding up and whatnot.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  Do you think Lembaugh is right that they hype every one of these hurricanes like it's the end of the world? The media spun it and he says it's not real. He says the hurricane doesn't exist.
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  Now, he's saying that they're always going fast out in the Gulf and that he thinks they're going to slow down.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  Well, I definitely think the weather has been strange. We got three hurricanes going on right now. There's a person called Dane Wiggington. He does geoengineeringwatch.org.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  He's a pretty good and reliable source for any type of weather.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  What is he saying?
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  Well, he's going down the route that they're spraying the sky and manipulating the weather and he has evidence to back it up, which is the scary part.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  Yeah, you know, I know who he is. We should get him back on. There's also a meteorologist that runs Weather Wars.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  Let's get all these folks on for the special Sunday transmission. We're going to have a big raft of guests to cover all that.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  The reason I'm saying this is so deadly is normally they're going 140 miles an hour when they start out in the Atlantic.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  And then by the time they hit, they're going 60 or 70. This time it's 185. Now what? It slowed down to 170.
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:02.000]  And by the time it hits Cuba, okay, 150. And that means it'll hit Florida going 100.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  So, I mean, if it hits South Florida going 100, that is going to be like a giant bomb going off.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  Alex, what do you think the chances of it hitting Texas again? What do you think about that?
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  Well, these models have gotten pretty darn accurate and most models show it going either up the East Coast, right at the middle of Florida or kind of right up Western Florida, up into Tennessee.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  But if it did go into Texas again, I tell you, all I know is they have weather modification technology. It's a fact.
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  And then every time I talk about it, the media misrepresenting says that I said Obama sent the tornado or I said this or that.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  I don't know because it's all classified. All I know is they can create hurricanes. They can kill hurricanes.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  They can steer hurricanes. They can weaken them. They can strengthen them.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  That is a fact declassified 2006. And it was certified by the Department of Energy, the Pentagon and the Navy and the Air Force in 1967.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  It's all declassified. So, what do you think?
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  The Operation Jade Helm map, talking about the Southern Hemisphere of America, basically, you get taken out.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  What do you think about like connecting these storms to FEMA?
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  Well, Jade Helm said Texas is enemy territory. I said, look, they're training us that America is the enemy.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  They're trying to train our military. They spun that. And I said, there's an invasion this summer.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  Never said it. Total lies. So, again, I hate to even comment on these things because they misrepresent what I have to say.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  But yes, all of this is about conditioning us. And Trump hasn't gotten in control of much of the government.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  The transparent things with where he has executive power and he knows what he can do, he's gotten done.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  Everywhere else, the Congress, the bureaucracy have absolutely thumbed their noses at the president.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  One group so far has backed him and that's the Supreme Court because what he's done is totally cut and dry.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  Thank you so much, Levi. Be safe there in Florida. I hope you're right.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  I hope it turns into a tropical depression and just gives you some well-needed rain.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  But there are already hundreds and hundreds dead, no communications with many of these Caribbean islands that have been hit.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  This is a serious situation, so pray for folks. Frank, in North Carolina, then Carlos, Frank, you're on the air.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  Well, you might as well throw Professor James McCanny in there as well for your show because I'm skeptical,
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  but he claims that his observations indicate that these storms are being controlled and not only that,
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  he claims that he was part of it. He worked on it some decades ago and was instrumental in getting all this put together.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  So I think he lives outside of the U.S. now. Someone tells me because I was asking why is he dead.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  And the person, Whittington, I believe that the last caller we're talking about, I believe he's the guy behind.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  What in the hell are they spraying and who is spraying us and all those videos as well?
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  Well, all I know is what in 1992, they gave a Nobel Prize to a group of scientists for calling to have things added to the jet fuel
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  to create these, quote, clouds to block solar radiation as a sunscreen. That was a cover for weather modification.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  And then they've been doing it massively and then they misrepresent to the public what they're doing.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  And NASA admits our atmosphere is 20-plus percent darker, they say because of condensation trails.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  Well, the point is jets that don't have the messed with fuel don't put out the giant persistent trails.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  And then regular jet fuel that hasn't been messed with only puts out the smaller ice crystal trails that dissipate in a few minutes.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  So there's no telling how big this is because of the shadow government. You want to hold over for anything else?
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  Yeah, well, the atomic test, didn't they say that they're, you know, if they light the atmosphere on fire? What the hell?
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  That's right. That was done when they tested H-bombs in the atmosphere. That was us.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  Hey, Daniel Brieman, why new MANA storeable foods? We believe in freedom.

[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  Stretch days have found us. Stretch days have tracked us down. They're going to destroy. I can't shoot.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've had it with President Trump. I'm finally done with him. The cruelty of what he just said about DACA and the children and adults in this country that were not born here but came here when they were young.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  The cruelty of what he just said and his new statement about the situation pushed me over the line and I now am officially off the Trump train. Here is the new statement on DACA that is the most hate-filled racist crap.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  It's true. All of his supporters are racist like the Republican strategist have been saying. If you do not decry the president now, you are KKK, you are a rapist. Like Michael Moore said, you are a Nazi.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  I'm done. It's true what they said about him. I can't believe it. I was wrong. I apologize. Here is his new bigoted hateful statement. If you don't decry it, you're a rapist and you're a Nazi. I agree with the Democrats and the Republicans and Michael Moore. This is a Nazi statement.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  But we have to send a clear message. Just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay. So we don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  And that was Donald Trump in 2014 because Hillary Clinton would never make a statement like that. I mean, it's reasonable to say, hey, you just claim you were here as a kid or a young person. You're a 45-year-old guy.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  You know, it's been deported 14, 15, 16, some cases 40-plus times for armed robbery, rape, you name it. You know what? We're just going to believe you. Wave a little magic wand. You can stay. And everybody else that came in legally and went to college here and contributed to the economy and got jobs here and, you know, actually follow the laws, we're going to penalize them because we want an undercurrent of people politically we can control.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  That's a good thing. And how dare? Should we hear that statement? In fact, maybe the full statement from Trump. He's settling a little bit higher voice, though, but, you know, I expect everyone to repudiate him now. Let's play Donald John Trump, the most evil man in the world.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  Literally, Hitler. Here it is.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  But we have to send a clear message just because your child gets across the border that doesn't mean the child gets to stay. So we don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  Dangerous journey. Well, there goes President Trump. Yeah, I didn't know he was a cross-dresser. But hey, I'm not against that. I think you can be what you want to be as long as you don't hurt anybody else, as long as you don't sexualize kids. I agree with Camille Paglia.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  You know, kill the Camille Paglia clip. She's come out and said that it's child abuse in public school until a five-year-old boy, he's really a girl or vice versa, that's sexualization of children. That's bigoted, too. Let's play what this evil woman had to say.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  I think that the transgender propagandists make wildly inflated claims about the multiplicity of gender. A sex reassignment surgery, even today, with all of its advances, cannot in fact change anyone's sex.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  You can define yourself as a trans man or a trans woman. It's one of these new gradations along the scale. But ultimately, every single cell in the human body, the DNA in that cell remains coded for your biological birth.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:30.000]  So there are a lot of lies being propagated at the present moment, which I think is not in anyone's best interest.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:46.000]  What I'm concerned about is the popularity and the availability of sex reassignment surgery. It doesn't feel that he or she belongs to the...
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:51.000]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:59:02.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:18.000]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said. There's so many things that are in it.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:41.000]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:49.000]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:59:49.000 --> 02:00:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:19.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  Generals gathered in their masses, just like witches at black masses. Evil minds that plot destruction.
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  So we're going back to your phone calls. By the way, I just played a clip of you joined us of Hillary in 2014 saying that you can't just have a bunch of people claiming that they were little kids when they came here and just magically make them legal because it creates a train wreck and penalizes those that came here legally.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  Turns out we've got Obama, and I remember this, and we've got Chuck E. Schumer and all of them saying it. So we're going to be playing that video coming up. But it just shows how Trump actually said, let's create a system that vets people that can prove they were here and prove they were in school.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  And when they go to a hearing and show their yearbook or show they've had a job and show they don't have a criminal record and Congress needs to pass a law and then we'll make you legal.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  And he goes, oh, and I love these people that are hardworking and came here and contributing. So he says that an actual plan that works instead of having all these forgotten secret people that the system can feed on that drive down wages, he wants to raise them up and raise everybody up.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  And because of that, they misrepresent and say he's a Nazi when Hillary and Obama and everybody was just saying, you can't even be here. But then in 2015, Obama just decides to erase all that and go, we've got children pouring across refugees and children that are already here.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  As long as they're children, let's just legalize them. Total fiat legislation. It's like Snake Plisket and escaped from New York and he's just got inserted in and trying to find the president.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  He finds the homing beacon and it's a drunk guy down in a basement. He goes, Mr. President, we got to get out of here. And he goes, that's right. I'm the president. I'm the president. It's like the same thing.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  He finds some 40 year old guy. You're a child, aren't you? That's right. I am. I was a baby when I got brought over here.
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  Meanwhile, the guy's got a rap sheet 18 feet long in Venezuela or Nigeria or Russia or Mexico or wherever it is or North Africa.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  That's why it's the same tactic. They keep calling them boys when men rape some woman and it's some 27 year old thug on video with a gun or three guys rape the girl laughing going, ain't nothing you're going to do, bitches.
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  Those are actual quotes. We want to show you the video. We can show it to you. And then they go, oh, it's okay. He's a boy.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  So he's not going to get in trouble. He didn't know what he was doing. And it's some 27 year old guy with a beard where they're raping a woman at gunpoint, but it's okay because they're Muslims.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:34.000]  So don't be Islamophobic. Islamophobic. If they were telling me that 27 year old Baptist could run around and rape women, I'd be getting mad at Baptist.
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  But Baptist aren't doing stuff like that.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  We're going to go to break. And I promise I'm going to go bang, bang, bang, go to your calls with Widdly and McAdoo with us from Florida.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  And then we're going to continue on today. Oh, and Troyer is coming in. There's this new phenomenon where the Liberals, which really just means dirt bag, uneducated dirt balls that don't wash under their arms.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  And who can't find their butt. They have their children march over and scream racist FU at us.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  But what's new is the media then celebrates just dirt, baggery, lowest of the low who would ever be proud of their nine year old daughter walking over and going FU stop bad racist.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:31.000]  Well, can you talk to us? Can you articulate? No, FU. And everybody's like, yeah, he can't even, she can't even talk. Oh, the fall of civilization. Yes.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  Brainwash, low, beastial idiocy. There's no way this little girl ever be reached with actual intellectual facts or discussion.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  She's just taught to not have debate or discussion and scream Nazi.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  Her journey towards brainwashed failure is complete. She'll be in the clutches of the education system for the rest of her life.
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:04.000]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non GMO, early MCs, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like minded people.
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:14.000]  And we've got a new humongoid sale, not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:22.000]  We've never offered super male vitality, no concentrated herbs, cold pressed, super male vitality, 57% off. It's never been the price.
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:29.000]  It is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total, a third party sites unprecedented and it's cold pressed.
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  That's why super male is so different. People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science and these are what you sell.
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  Buzzfeed said it's already best selling stuff that's been certified as healthy and good forever. Why these aren't anything new?
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best but cold pressed?
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  Do. Do.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:57.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:10.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:17.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing and then processing.
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:31.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other super food ingredients known for cleansing and super charging the body at the same time.

[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  Well, we've got breaking news. Anthony Weiner.
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  They've just announced is set to be sentenced for the sexting to a 15 year old girl. We're one of the first groups to break that intel.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  And now the 15 year old girl has done a TV interview that is set to be aired today. We have a snippet of that we're going to be playing. It's up on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  Leanne McAdoo is riding shotgun with us for much of the shower and we'll be taking phone calls from folks that have been holding like Carlos and Anthony and Mark and Jacob and others.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:30.000]  Leanne McAdoo again joins us from the west coast of Florida from an undisclosed location and she is there reporting on what's happening.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  We have Quentin Carter that's on the southern east coast down there close to Miami and we have a bunch of Snapchat videos that we've been garnering from Florida but also from other areas in the Caribbean where there's been massive devastation.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  We're already in Miami, days away from it hitting, the winds are kicking up. The storm is still close to 180 miles an hour but it's in between southern Cuba now and islands to the north but it's set to graze the north central area of Cuba with the really dangerous high winds.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  A lot of folks know I don't normally hype up hurricanes because we've never seen one that's going 185 miles an hour. Most meteorologists, not just mainstream media ones, are saying there's a very good chance that this thing hits Florida at even 120 miles an hour and goes up the center of the state.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  This is going to really be bad news and it's because of the astrophysics of the sun involved in all these mass coronal injections right now that we know drives, not just the heat of the sun driving hurricanes but also the ionization coming in that forms the nuclei that allows water vapor to condense into droplets.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  This is not a theory. This is known by all meteorologists, astrophysicists, but for some reason it's never discussed unless you get into academic areas.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  So Miami is a ghost town. The sea is still very, very calm there. We're showing you some snapchats of this and then as Leanne talks and as we take your calls, we'll show you some of the carnage in islands that they're calling uninhabitable from the eastern Mediterranean.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  Meanwhile, the media, as Paul Watson reported earlier, has been celebrating that Trump's beach house got hit on one of these islands and destroyed.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  Even though the islands, 91% black, they're trying to make it all racial, I have pointed out that with Houston and Harvey, we saw incredible humanity coming together, a.k.a. Martin Luther King, beautiful black saving whites, vice versa, Hispanic saving whites, vice versa.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  Everybody's saving everybody, just humans with red blood. That's why Raw Story ran stories as well as Washington Post and others that I pushed it was a race war and there was no unity and that blacks are evil.
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:12:04.000]  They don't have any quotes though. They don't have any video of myself or Tucker Carlson saying this. We're saying great unity, love, come together. That's all we've been saying.
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  We've been saying there's been some racist black folks on Twitter, but along with Democrats like this, you know, Hollywood star saying God did it to us because we, you know, deserve it.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  She's a white lady, Jennifer Lawrence, shameful, but we have been the ones saying incredible unity.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  So how are they going to counter us? They're just saying that we say there's no unity. So Leanne, I tell you, you're there in Florida.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  Do you think we're over hyping this as Rush Limbaugh sing? I'm not bashing Rush. I hope he's right because a lot of times there's a hurricane going 130 miles an hour out in the Atlantic and they say, oh, it's all over.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  Well, yeah, that hit going 130, but they usually slows down to 5060. This is 185, never before seen with the earthquake, the biggest earthquake ever hit in Mexico.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  Clearly it's the sun firing all those ions into the earth, bouncing off the nickel core. That's what real science shows. What do you think?
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  Well, also, we just had a really massive solar flare the other day as well. So I knew something big was going to come. I think you're kind of right over the target there with that.
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  You know, hopefully they're right. Hopefully this hurricane will take a sharp turn to the right at the last minute and everything will be saved.
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  But the fact is this hurricane is just traveling at really high rate of speed and it's not taking the usual course where it'll get slowed down a little bit when it goes over Cuba or some of these other islands that have really high mountain ranges that are able to kind of slow the storms down.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  It's just traveling right through the open water and kind of skirting those islands. So if this does hit Florida, I mean, this is going to have devastating impact if there's a direct hit there in Miami and South Florida.
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  Actually, as I was waiting to come on the air, someone's been banging on my door. So I've just been told that we have a mandatory evacuation here in the complex where I live.
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  So I've got to get off, you know, with you, get off the show with you and get all my stuff boarded up and get out of here and then head to my mom's and get all of her house boarded up.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  We live near the water. My mom lives on a barrier island. And so, you know, we've got to go because the most dangerous part of the hurricane really obviously, yes, it can flatten buildings and just level towns with these devastating winds.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  But the storm surge is what's going to be really the most dangerous people saw with the flooding there with Harvey, what that looked like.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  And Florida, whenever there's a hurricane, really what people are the most afraid of are the storm surges here and they're expecting 10, 12 foot storm surges.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  So here we might be seeing three or four foot storm surges. My mom lives on an island.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  You know, the last time we had a bad hurricane here, the water was up above my knees in the entire village. So, you know, this is water just in people's homes.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  It's just, it's pretty impressive to think what could possibly happen here, you know, this weekend.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:10.000]  And I've got to worry now about my uncle who is hunkering down right there in West Palm Beach. So it's
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  and Clinton Carter is over in that similar area as well. Leigh Ann, I'm going to let you go then soon as you can do that. But, you know, they've got different storm tracks.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  Some show it going to the east, some going right up the state. Others more and more showing it going up the west side and you're up there halfway up on the west side.
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  Many areas are ghost towns in Miami, Southern Florida, the keys. But the word is two days ago, you said they weren't that busy at the stores, but we were talking to you yesterday.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  You were saying that a lot of stuff was cleaned out yesterday. What have you been seeing in way of preparation there on the central coast of Florida?
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  Well, luckily we don't have the crazy lines and the rushing and the fighting. My friend did tell me that he witnessed some actual fist fighting in the Home Depot yesterday.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  But, you know, here because people we know it's not really going to impact us here necessarily. There isn't any panicking going on. But yes, as soon as they get the shelves stocked, it's empty.
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:16.000]  You can't get water. You can't get these swarble foods. The only canned foods that are left are like the chicken broth and the broth soups. Everything's gone.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  And as soon as they get these shelves stocked, they're gone and there's no gas, no gas anywhere. People are lined up around the block to get gas.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  Then by the time they finally are able to get to the gas pump, there's no gas there. And so that's why I haven't even really been driving around that much.
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  I'm sort of afraid to head east come Monday because there's not going to be any gas to get back. So it's a really incredible.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  You just hit it. They're telling everybody to evacuate in the south and now they're in the central coast where you're at and all up the east coast.
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  But then there's no gas. The roads are clogged. There's no hotels. It's just bedlam. And it shows how precarious this industrial society is.
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:02.000]  I'm not criticizing it, but this just on time delivery, this system is a time bomb.
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  Right. And I mean, that's just the importance of being prepared because pretty much everyone here in Florida, you'll have your hurricane supplies.
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:18.000]  I've got my supply closet. But even with me, I was rotating out my water. But you can't do that because as I was rotating out my water,
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  it just so happened that very day all the water ran out. And so when I went to go get, refill my hurricane supplies, there wasn't any water.
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  And I had to wait two days. I had to get up at six in the morning so I could be one of the first people at the store to get the water.
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:38.000]  So when you have your storeable foods and your storeable emergency supplies, you really have to keep those and maintain them
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  for the duration of whatever season it is that you're hoping to weather, whatever storm you're hoping to weather.
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:50.000]  Because you just never know. You never know when, oh, well, I'll go ahead and use the gas and then I'll go get some more.
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  You know, refill my supplies for the next storm. But when you go to resupply, it might not be there. So it's just really incredible to see how quickly the panic takes over,
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  how quickly the stores empty out their shelves. I mean, we had reports that they were having to have the National Guard protect the gas trucks that were just trying to bring in gas.
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  You know, people are, it's just really fragile. It's just interesting to see how fragile this society is.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  Well, Leigh Ann, you know, the Info Wars crowd and the crew and myself all love you. So be safe. I'm going to let you get out of here now.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  I didn't know that as we were talking to you that they were beating on your door saying get out of there.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  So go take care of your grandma. That's why you've moved there for the time being. Come back to visit us soon and take care of your grandmother.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:46.000]  We just had a successful surgery. So you're a good granddaughter and be safe. But it is like Russian roulette.
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:52.000]  You've got it coming in and up and we don't know if it's going to go your direction right up the state to the east.
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  What's your gut tell you Leigh Ann? I mean, because they don't know the storm tracks show that it could go basically anywhere up the state.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  Well, Alex, you know, I'm not really one to panic. I don't think that's a very helpful reaction in a catastrophe situation.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  I'm really scared about this storm and everyone I've talked to is really worried about it. I don't want to cry,
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:18.000]  but it's it's going to go up the entire state of Florida and either way, there's definitely going to be a lot of flooding,
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:25.000]  a lot of storm surge and I'm just really concerned about my family there on the east coast and my friends and people who've chosen to kind of
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:28.000]  hunker down whether the storm is going to be the biggest we've ever seen.
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  Well, as long as you can get those after you're done taking your grandma and getting them, you know, in shelter,
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  you should keep tweeting out at Leigh Ann McAdoo on Twitter and shooting those videos to give us updates.
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  We're praying for you. Everybody in Florida and in the path of the storm there in the Caribbean.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  Thank you, Leigh Ann McAdoo. Thank you. I promise we're going boom, boom, boom, Carlos and others.

[02:23:50.000 --> 02:24:07.000]  All right, the good news is the storm has slowed down. It came in at 185 miles an hour.
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:11.000]  Yesterday slowed down to 175 this morning when I was checking it.
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:16.000]  It's already slowed down to 155 miles an hour before it even hits Cuba.
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  So maybe Rush Limbaugh is going to be right because he said he lives in Florida and it's the end of the world every time.
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:27.000]  I've never seen a hurricane at 185 miles an hour. Nobody else has. It's a category six.
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:31.000]  But it was a category six. It's now a category five.
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:36.000]  And so I hope that it turns into a tropical depression and just goes away.
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  But the other islands it's hit, it has torn the daylights out of.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:44.000]  But that's when it was going 180 miles an hour at its core, 185 miles an hour.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:47.000]  Let's go to your phone calls right now. I know this.
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:52.000]  When it makes landfall Sunday morning at 7 a.m. central, that's 8 a.m.
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:56.000]  Eastern is when it's scheduled to hit. We're going to be here throughout the day covering it.
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  And we hope to announce that it's, you know, not a problem.
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:05.000]  But if you go to the Weather Channel and other places they've got, the meteorologist is talking about storm surges.
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:12.000]  Here's Fox News we're looking at. It shows a 10 to 15 foot storm surge going into Florida,
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:15.000]  20, 30 miles into the state.
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:22.000]  I mean, we can just keep rolling that we can show TV viewers when it actually shows the peninsula of Florida itself.
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  Is the shot I wanted to show you guys had it pause when we came in for break.
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  We'll show it later. We'll find it. No big deal.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:36.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Carlos in Montreal. Carlos you're on the air.
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:42.000]  Thank you, Alex. No, we're far away from the storm here in Montreal, Canada.
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:50.000]  But in 1986, I was on holidays in the island of Viti Levou in Fiji when Cyclone Oscar struck.
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  And it landed at 182 miles an hour.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  The storm surge, of course, is the most dangerous part with 19.5 feet of water.
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  Now, you know, I hope it will be a storm, a category storm when it hits Florida.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  But underestimating these phenomena is the most dangerous thing you can do.
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  And there's some helpful advice that can be given to people that are living in.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:20.000]  Okay, so let's be clear. Carlos, you're saying you're the survivor of a typhoon or slash cyclone.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  They turn the opposite direction in the Pacific. They do get up to 180, 185 miles an hour.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:32.000]  Normally, hurricanes only up to 160. This one hit 185. You're saying you survived 182 miles an hour.
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.000]  Describe what that was like and the advice you have for folks.
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  Well, thank you so much, Alex. Well, the most memorable experience is that you're in...
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:46.000]  They started at 6 o'clock at night, around 6.30, a quarter to 7.
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  The piano that was in the veranda, you know, near the balcony.
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  We're about maybe 150 feet from the ocean. Wonderful...
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  As they recall, they're like bungalows made of straw and so on.
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:07.000]  And the piano just flew out from the balcony. So you can just imagine how it started.
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  At about midnight, at 6 o'clock in the morning, it ended.
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  Eight people died in the vicinity of the area we were.
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  We were spared in large measure because there was a reef outside the coastline where there was a water break.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:29.000]  But effectively, the wind is what I remember in the darkness to be the most frightening.
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  Now, anyone who is experiencing wind at 87 or 89 miles an hour, that's terrible.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  But at 98 miles an hour, regardless of what, all trees break.
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:48.000]  So we found a palm tree had flown like an arrow into one of the bureaus near us.
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  I want to tell you that do not underestimate it. All windows should be boarded up.
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  The biggest expenses, of course, are usually unnoticeable.
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:06.000]  That is, your vintage cars or expensive vehicles, get them out inland as high up as you can off the ground.
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  Individuals should take care of their pets and make sure that what they would do to save their pet, they do for themselves.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  Because it's very, very important that you do this before, because after once it begins, you cannot go outside.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:32.000]  Things fly around. It is not, no one's fault. All your garden furniture, please bring them indoors.
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  You're saying everything basically turns into a weapon. And of course, someone who's been through a depression is worried about depressions.
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  Somebody who hasn't is never worried about them. Somebody who's never been in a fight is not worried about it.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  Somebody who has been, will be. Somebody who's never been in a typhoon or a hurricane or as they call it a cyclone.
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  You are worried about it because you've experienced it.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  Yes, sir. Oscar will never be named again Oscar in the Pacific because of the magnitude.
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:04.000]  I can tell you one group of people that were in a small island on the other side of Vitelevue.
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:09.000]  We met at the airport when we were evacuated eventually. We were allowed to leave.
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  I want to tell you that they were in a second story little hotel in an island.
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:22.000]  The storm surge covered the island completely. They were on the second floor in the darkness with waves breaking into the second story.
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:29.000]  And their suitcases were floating around them. Everyone was on the second floor of this little hotel.
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  I've heard a tornado from a mile away. It sounds like a freight train.
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  But those are the loudest noise you can imagine in a hurricane or a tornado.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000]  But a hurricane just keeps going and going.
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:45.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:04.000]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO, early emcees, great books, great films, great patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:10.000]  We've got a new humongoid sale. Not a number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:20.000]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months. We've never offered super male vitality, known concentrated herbs, cold pressed, super male vitality, 57% off.
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:28.000]  It's never been the price. It is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third party sites, unprecedented.
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:34.000]  And it's cold pressed. That's why super male is so different. People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:40.000]  These are what you sell. Buzzfeed said it's already best selling stuff. It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:45.000]  Why these aren't anything new? Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold pressed?
[02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:48.000]  Do. Do.
[02:30:53.000 --> 02:31:00.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:06.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:15.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze.
[02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:23.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children through the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:31.000]  We need our masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:37.000]  The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:43.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:47.000]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:54.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com.
[02:31:54.000 --> 02:32:01.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:06.000]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:19.000]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:29.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:40.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:46.000]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body. Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:53.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[02:32:53.000 --> 02:33:10.000]  Florida is now in the danger zone. Record earthquake through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:16.000]  You know, the biggest takeaway for me so far is that folks don't take this serious till it gets closer.
[02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:27.000]  But if you've ever been in floods, like I've been in North Texas and Central Texas, or you've ever been in a tornado, or you've ever been in a hurricane, even a week when I've been in a category three,
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:36.000]  when it was over me as a category three and things are moving so fast and branches are flying through your windows and the first floor of your house is flooding,
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:51.000]  that's WEMP stuff compared to being on the coastline. And I was just search engineing NOAA and the computer tracks. They only had a few tracks earlier this week showing it jumping Florida and going into the main gulf,
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:58.000]  which is still hot, so it would speed back up just like Harvey did. Ladies and gentlemen, I just looked at some of the new tracks.
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:09.000]  Well, they've got some up from Fox News. They've got a lot of tracks. Now I'm going directly in to the Gulf of Mexico and not even hitting Florida.
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:15.000]  I think that's why Liam was getting scared because just a few days ago they didn't have any of the tracks, maybe one or two tracks, the computer models.
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:24.000]  Now most of the computer models have it going up the west coast of Florida or right up the middle of Florida and some have it hitting New Orleans again.
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:37.000]  Look at that track. So we're just tracking all this together, watching it. And again, I hope people that are saying this is going to be a big deal or right.
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  I was hoping that it wasn't going to be a big storm with Harvey, obviously. I got family out in Houston, but it's been a big mess.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:57.000]  But you know, the good news is it brought us together as rough as it's been. So I just hope we can come together with this situation and there isn't a bunch of looting and people taking advantage of it.
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:06.000]  We're talking to Carlos in Montreal, finishing up with his experience being in a Pacific Ocean storm.
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  And again, I know most of the audience knows this, but in the Atlantic, they're hurricanes in the Pacific. They're called cyclones or they have other names as well like typhoons.
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:22.000]  But go ahead and finish up your story.
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:38.000]  Well, all I wanted to tell you is that as far as the storms of that magnitude are concerned, I hope they do not hit Florida. But you know, one has to keep in mind that all electrical appliances in your home should be disconnected.
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:48.000]  If possible, if you can get to battery radio or cellular phone radio best, freezers and stuff like that can be dangerous if there is a water surge.
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:54.000]  Well, that's right. In fact, the power company should cut the power before it hits, but sometimes they don't.
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:36:07.000]  Correct. This is a big mistake, you know, and also in the Florida area, which wasn't the case in Fiji for us, but do not forget that animals do evade a water rise.
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:16.000]  So you may have the danger if you go outside to be careful that you seal as much as possible of your property door.
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:24.000]  Oh, I'm so glad you used to when I lived on Barton Creek, there was a flood with the creek getting to where it was like 800 feet wide.
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  I mean, it was in our houses. It was up on a little hill, but it was all the way up on the pylons of the house and bats, Mexican brown bats by the tens of thousands during the early morning all came up in our house.
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:48.000]  And if you walked out and I think I put video of this out before on YouTube, there was thousands of bats on my porch up under the roof crawling in and they even got in under the roof and into my house.
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  So I went in the house and had bats flying around in the living room.
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:37:03.000]  Well, in Florida now, you know, you do have the problem of larger snakes that are that have been in the, you know, dangerous.
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:08.000]  So you have to be careful that that is do not underestimate the magnitude of these phenomena.
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  And then afterwards, when the sun comes out and everything seems to be over, remember your neighbor, remember your friends, remember that they may have had a worse experience than you and, you know, be generous above all, you know.
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:30.000]  Well, that's right. And expanding on that, we saw alligators all over the place in Houston in people's front yards.
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:40.000]  In Fiji, there were animals that were dead. And they, you know, the few days afterwards, the roads were washed down. We couldn't get to the airport for three days.
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  It was beautiful, of course, but destroyed. Schools were destroyed like paper mache.
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  And all I can tell you is that I do not hope that this hasn't happened in Florida because but underestimating the magnitude of these storms and the wind, the memory of the rushing wind.
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:07.000]  Is something to be recorded and to be heard because it really wakes your primitive senses as an evolving species on earth.
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:12.000]  The magnitude and the power of nature cannot be underestimated.
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  You know, that's a great point. Carlos, we ought to have you as a contributor. You've been calling the last few years. You're really a smart dude.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:31.000]  In fact, Dr. Mark as well, we got his number. If you want to get on hold and be a contributor to somebody that pops in as a kind of platinum level caller a few times a week to give your analysis where we just call Carlos.
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:42.000]  If you want to give us your name and number, I'm going to start trying to have some of the really amazing callers be be regulars as we begin to launch a 20 plus hour live transmission.
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  We're now live at 8am to 6pm every day. And you will just see that expand and expand and expand.
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  As we promised you, we're going to take the country back, take the world back, expose the globalist because their program is so evil.
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  It's not that we're powerful. It's that they're that weak. If you just challenge them, it's game over.
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:06.000]  So I want to now go to Anthony and Jacob and Mark and Dan and others here in just a moment as fast as I can.
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:13.000]  But getting back to that last caller, Carlos from Montreal, Canada.
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  These storms just show us how fragile this world is, how fragile life is and that we are living on a planet in deep space orbiting a huge thermal nuclear ongoing explosion that is the sun.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:38.000]  Whose own explosive mass is held together by its gravitational mass and that we are on continents.
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  That we are on tectonic plates floating around on liquid magma.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  Our planet is still cooling.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  So yes, the only thing certain in life is change and anybody that's bored is an idiot. We're in the middle of the most fantastic thing ever.
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:15.000]  This is incredible and men and women and life and passion and children and food and the ocean and birds and trees and the sixth sense in God and the spiritual world and good and evil and all of it.
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:22.000]  It's such a big thing consciousness. It's amazing. Wow.
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  I'm bored. I'm sick of all my TV shows. I'm waiting for the new season of this to come out and I'm just like I'm not watching much TV because I'm watching reality baby and it's the real channel.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:57.000]  So it's the animating context of life. But we've made this modern civilization where people kind of perch in this limited artificial system feeling like oh there's nothing to life until they realize how tenuous it is and then they're really alive.
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  One of your calls in 45 seconds just want to say that we are. I'm the type of person that I don't take advantage of disasters and things. I'm telling you about storeable foods and water filtration systems because you need to back up.
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  You need to be self sufficient. And when we get you the best storeable foods out there to offer that at the lowest prices in a win win.
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:28.000]  But we don't do like Amazon does to raise prices on average. This has been in the news 100% during this crisis or crises Harvey and Irma in the North Korea and all the rest of it.

[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  I'm not mad at them they just didn't get it now.

[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:33.000]  Who's coming up in the fourth hour today.
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:42.000]  The vaunted Mike Cernovich you'll always want to tune into that right now I'm going to be good now so we've been holding that Anthony Illinois has been holding for over an hour.
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:47.000]  He gets a free bottle X to or a free thing a caveman or a free t shirt.
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  We're just going to get his email and then and then and then just ask him what he wants I guess however that works but Anthony thanks for holding from Illinois you're on the air.
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  I really appreciate you guys and you have a monumental task ahead of you.
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:18.000]  I believe that info wars and you guys are the trump of our day you're the actual the elected media outlet that has given us just just a victory in our voice and trying to keep the truth out there.
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  And I want to addify you Anthony as well we're all in this together so thank you.
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:32.000]  Yes absolutely I've been getting a lot of you know in my spirit about what's recently happened to me never the last two years I've been a supporter of Donald Trump.
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  As far as the comments on Facebook and always trying to be as much supportive I can to everything that stands for the Lord and and I know he's had 25 pastoral advisors around him.
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:47.000]  A lot of times people have been able to back him up the way I think they should and I get upset about that sometimes but.
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:56.000]  Four months three months ago Alex I've been hearing from the Lord when I pray in my part time as a minister outside the other things that I'm trying to do in life I do pray.
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:07.000]  And basically I just really felt the Lord really being upset with with a lying and he spoke to me directly and he said you know I'm really getting tired of the lying that's going on.
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:14.000]  And then just all together just a blanket of word he spoke to me in my spirit and I know that came from God.
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:25.000]  And I'll tell you if you don't have a compassion for what's going on right now with these storms and people and people want to sit their mouth off about judgment and vengeance of God.
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:37.000]  It's all better but you better be sure that you better be humble about the way you approach things and make sure it's well exactly you've got these atheists left as going on God's destroying Texas.
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:46.000]  God's destroying Florida God's going to kill the Nazis when they don't even know who's in those states or what they're saying these are atheists but when they want to oh suddenly God's real.
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:52.000]  I agree that sounds like those people are asking for some judgment themselves.
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:46:11.000]  Now God said Alex and in Psalm 8934 my covenant will I not break nor alter the thing that's gone forth out of my lips. God is going to have his way no matter what happens. He says vengeance. There's a vengeance of the day of our God and there is a return of restitution of all things.
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:18.000]  So that we need to be thankful now for the folks in the store but also for ourselves for the church for everything that's going on.
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:28.000]  And they were about to launch a massive race war that they had confirmed they were going to do it and try to try to kill Trump not that he's perfect but overthrow him this month but the storm came and brought us together.
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:38.000]  So it shows how even something that looks horrible and bad many times again the Lord works in mysterious ways. Who wasn't the first said that I couldn't find out who first said that pastor.
[02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  The Lord works in mysterious ways. Well it says his ways are past finding out and the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God.
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:57.000]  So you know he does work in mysterious ways and but he does reveal his secret under his servants to prophets and aim is three seven.
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  So but I did want to share that you know I believe that there are some elements of things that have not been brought up about Israel. The prophecy club is given warnings about prophecies that have been brought forth about.
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:20.000]  Oh look at Soros openly trying to overthrow Israel. It's not that Israel is perfect. Israel's got big problems but the globalists want to overthrow it.
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:29.000]  But it's targeted and the very enemies of America want to overthrow it and these idiots get mad at me because they see the corruption Israel think I'm defending that.
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  That's not the point that we know those that want to overthrow Israel are the very same enemies that want to overthrow America and Christianity and their allied with Islam.
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  It's so ridiculously obvious.
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:52.000]  But those prophecies said Alex that they try to split Israel and America is in part would try to make some kind of a deal to give land to the palace.
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:48:00.000]  You know all those things and we better not be messing split because God said that God would split America and I've seen with the showersville.
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:10.000]  This is not some blackout thing. I mean God has absolutely God will work through the evil people that think they're the ones causing a race war when God will use them for the real division.
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000]  You're absolutely right Anthony. God bless you.
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:18.000]  Powerful information. Jacob in Arizona. Thanks for holding. You're on the air to get these guys emails. Send them some free stuff.
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:24.000]  I got a rule. Hold over like an hour and a half. I'm going to send you something free. Jacob in Arizona. You're on the air.
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  Hey Alex. Thank you for having me on man. I really appreciate everything you guys do.
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  Why is it too many politicians only support disaster relief when it's like politically convenient?
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:42.000]  And you know I remember you guys were talking and touching based on like that new movie that's coming out by I think Dean Devlin.
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  Geostorm. Yeah. Well here's the deal. Here's the deal. People are saying that Ted Cruz is bad for voting against disaster relief for the East Coast.
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:58.000]  But then he's going to vote for this. If you looked at what those deals were they were a bunch of pork barrel had nothing to do with the disaster relief.
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  But I don't want the feds to have all the power anyways. I think it should be with the states so we can take care of ourselves.
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  But at least Trump is just letting locals get in and do things and not have FEMA running it.
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:19.000]  Yeah. Very true. Well even Nikola Tesla. He's the father. I feel like a heart. You know with the electromagnetic storms and climate.
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  They have they have all of it. But again the sun is a billion times bigger than whatever the globalists can do. They can just try to tinker and guess what's going to happen with computers and then try to.
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:38.000]  With weather weapons they can take clear skies and make floods. But they.
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:44.000]  Well from the research they thought they could control hurricanes in the 60s. Now I don't know the CIA certified that improperly.
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:54.000]  Ben Livingston said they were doing it. What do you think. Weapon if you think about it. I mean no one they could blame it on natural disaster.
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:50:02.000]  You know and it causes all this muck and they'll blame it on Trump saying oh he's not doing anything when really these politicians and the governors.
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  That's what I'm saying even if they went and salted this hurricane to speed it up which they can do. They can take a current category three and make it a category six if they want.
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:18.000]  That's technology that's real. I'm not saying that happened because the American people are sick of the race for garbage. This will just make us come together.
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:22.000]  I'm predicting that's what's going to happen.
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:28.000]  Yeah definitely it should. I mean we should all come together. We shouldn't let these people break us apart. Trump is bringing us together.
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  And that's what they fear. And that's you know why.
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  That's why he gives a speech about bringing us together. And then they say he brought us apart. It's not that it's just like if you see what Trump says versus what he does the media is lying.
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:48.000]  It's not about Trump. It's that the media the mainstream media are a pack of scum. We'll be back with Dan and others to stay with us.
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:51:03.000]  We have our destroyer coming in. Stay with us.

[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:26.000]  Climate change must be manmade climate change.
[02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:33.000]  We're going to play a little short clip and Owen came in here during the break and he said man Alex what's it like to be attacked.
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:37.000]  I've never been attacked in hundreds of newspapers in one day like you are now bro.
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  They've got technicians and corporate guys that put out the talking points.
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:46.000]  They saw that the last two weeks you Millie and some of the new crew.
[02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:54.000]  Let's not exaggerate 25 million views just on our platforms and everybody else copied the videos because we let everybody do it.
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  We just want the info out.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:02.000]  So all the people that hate us make money off of us getting little clips and editing them together of little kids coming up and cussing and all the hateful left.
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:06.000]  So they're attacking because simultaneously they've stolen your identity.
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:14.000]  They've stolen your work. They're making money off of you and they're pissed that you go out there and you're a good looking sharp smart guy and show their zombie hordes.
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:21.000]  So they've got to project it back and go it's rockstar to have nine year old girls talking like they're John Belushi on PCP.
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  It's great that they can't talk. It's great that they're dumb. It's great that they're hateful and stupid.
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:30.000]  It's great antifuzz crapping on everyone. They've got to turn that around and act like media matters.
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:36.000]  It takes our most powerful truths and puts them out twisted to act like they're the boss. Look at this kookiness.
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  Jones says that water is wet. It's about an authority. It's about a con game about who you can have on and who you can talk to.
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:48.000]  Owen, let's play a clip of this young lady last weekend in Austin.
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  Are you a young man?
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:52.000]  You're an idiot.
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000]  Wow, who taught you that language?
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000]  My mother.
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000]  So your mother taught you that foul language?
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  In the car.
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000]  And why am I an idiot? Oh, wow. Oh my gosh.
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000]  And then flicks off the camera.
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000]  Looks like about a nine-ten-year-old girl.
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  Yeah, and I said, she already acts basically like a, just like some thug woman.
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:18.000]  Yeah, I got ain't got tattoos on my arms. Yeah. You know, you do it.
[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:23.000]  It's kind of like the Trump thing, how they said like he was doing this and mimicking somebody that had mental disabilities.
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:28.000]  They say I said man. I always say ma'am and sir when I do these.
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:32.000]  They lie. They're all fiction writers in liberal media.
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000]  And so they have to make it your bad.
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:39.000]  So you say ma'am and clearly you say ma'am on the tape. That's what they do.
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  But notice who they're talking about, Owen.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:44.000]  Who are they talking about, Owen?
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:52.000]  Alex, if you don't mind, I'd actually like to read some scripture here that I found comfort in last night because I'm serious.
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  This was tough for me, Alex. I've never been character assassinated like this from hundreds of people at once.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000]  It was eye-opening to me.
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  You're telling him, help me. I'm weak.
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000]  So here's the Jedi taking over.
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:06.000]  Here's some scripture that I found comforting.
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000]  Sorry.
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  The end of all things is near. This is from Peter, by the way.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:12.000]  The end of all things is near.
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:22.000]  Therefore be alert and sober of mind so that you may pray.
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  We're seeing that right now.
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:29.000]  Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others as faithful stewards of God's grace in various forms.
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on to test you as though something strange were happening to you, but rejoice in as much as you participate in the suffering of Christ so that you may be overjoyed when His glory is revealed.
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:48.000]  But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you.
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:56.000]  They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who brought them, bringing swift destruction of themselves.
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth in disrepute.
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:05.000]  And that's what's happening is, the story isn't some kids flipping you off.
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:16.000]  All of them cuss, all of them scream, all of them are hateful, none of them can talk, and they celebrate small children acting like, you know, they're like some woman that's running a meth lab or something.
[02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  I mean, I'm not saying a little girl does that, but I mean, she's like, eh, come on up here. We got some machine guns and grenade launchers we stole, and we're running some stuff out the back door.
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:32.000]  Come on up here. It's like a woman smoking a cigarette. Eh, if you want, you want to talk to me. I'm a nine-year-old. My mommy told me, I don't know.
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:40.000]  I'm not in the media celebration. We'll be right back. Oh, oh, and got attacked by a couple hundred libtards. Poor little baby.

[03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:08.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:12.000]  Outta my way!
[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:23.000]  Alright Owen, I know you're shook up right now. You've had some major news sites come out and say you were a horrible person for letting a little girl cuss at you, but long you lick your wounds here.
[03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:36.000]  Her name's not been listed, but we have the 15-year-old young lady who a year ago had Wiener, Anthony the pervert Wiener, amongst many women he was trying to, girls he was trying to recruit, sexting her.
[03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:40.000]  He's being sentenced now, but now she's been on Inside Edition.
[03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:53.000]  Teen who says Anthony Wiener sexted her, well he's been convicted, chose her face for the first time and went downhill really fast. So let's go ahead and play a short clip of that report. Here it is.
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:01:04.000]  She's the teenager whose online relationship with Anthony Wiener threw Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign into a tailspin and perhaps changed the course of American history.
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  Now she's ready to tell her story to the world.
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:15.000]  Inside Edition is withholding her name because she's a minor. She's showing her face on TV for the first time.
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  How did you first come into contact with Anthony Wiener?
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:28.000]  It was through a direct message on the application Twitter. I just sent him a nice message, just hello, I'm a huge fan.
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:38.000]  It was January 2016 and the former New York congressman's once promising political career was over after he got caught up in a sexting scandal.
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  Why Anthony Wiener?
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:49.000]  I knew that Hillary Clinton would be running for president in the year 2016 and I wanted to see if Anthony was still up to the same antics.
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  How soon did it go from these niceties to him taking it to a different level?
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:59.000]  I knew that it was going downhill and really fast.
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:03.000]  Some of his messages are so obscene they can't be shown on television.
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:07.000]  I was disgusted. That's part of the reason that I came forward.
[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  Anthony Wiener just looks like a disgusting creature.
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000]  It's making sense today.
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:18.000]  Do you mind if I just finish this verse real quick, Alex?
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  It's amazing how true the Bible is thousands of years later. In their greed, which you mentioned, these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories.
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  Their condemnation has been long hanging over them and their destruction has not been sleeping.
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  But this is where it all came forward for me to just keep fighting, Alex.
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:47.000]  For so is the will of God that will ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free, not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as servants of God.
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:50.000]  So we have to crush these people. That's what that means.
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:55.000]  You want to come after us. You want to spread fake news. We're going to crush you.
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  Owen, that's good, but you understand having 25 million views.
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:03.000]  Those newspapers attacking you don't have that in five years combined.
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:08.000]  We're having total victory. I understand you're hurt by their children even crawl out from under rocks now.
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:11.000]  This is like it's baby. You were facing it's baby.
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000]  Alex, I don't care about these stories.
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:20.000]  When I went to the grocery store last night, I had a girl come up to me and say, you know, it's not good to harass children.
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:24.000]  That when that happened to know that you're out there being nice doing a report.
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:27.000]  Why are you here? Hi. She cusses at you tells you to f off.
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  And then you're the one that cause you got 25 million views, bro.
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:35.000]  25 million. We went in yellow. Yeah.
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:40.000]  And then these are deceived people that are delusional that lie to themselves throughout their lives.
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:43.000]  So you're a reporter with a little kid cussing at you.
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:50.000]  And they're so upset that it shows what scum they are and what they've turned society into that they have to turn it around.
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  But don't take it personal, Owen. Enjoy it.
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:56.000]  Well, it's nice for two and a half hours.
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000]  We did a live video for two and a half hours that day.
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:01.000]  They found 17 seconds that they're rejoicing in.
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  But look at how sick these people are.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:08.000]  They're now going and looking at genealogy to try to smear people.
[03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:13.000]  Tommy Loren meet the great grandfather prosecuted for forging his citizenship papers.
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:16.000]  They're attacking people's genealogy.
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  These are the most sick, psychopathic, twisted people that I can ever imagine.
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:26.000]  But it doesn't matter. They're losing. They're losers. They're losers. They're losers.
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:31.000]  And they know it. They want to claw us down in their little rat hole with them.
[03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:36.000]  And I've got news for them. I'm afraid that it's going to get much worse until it gets...
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:38.000]  Who's the president, Alex? Who's the president?
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  Donald John Trump.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  We've got a few final calls. We introduce Mike Cernovich straight away.
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:48.000]  I'm Alex Jones. This is the info. Owen's going to be okay.
[03:04:54.000 --> 03:05:01.000]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:07.000]  And we've got a new humongoid sale. Not a number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:17.000]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months. We've never offered super male vitality, known concentrated herbs, cold pressed, super male vitality, 57% off.
[03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:25.000]  It's never been the price. It is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third party sites, unprecedented.
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:32.000]  And it's cold pressed. That's why super male is so different. People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science and these are what you sell.
[03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:38.000]  They, Buzzfeed said, it's like, it's already best selling stuff. It's been certified as healthy and good forever. Why these aren't anything new?
[03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:42.000]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best but cold pressed?
[03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000]  Boo. Boo.
[03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:49.000]  Boo.
[03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:17.000]  Good halogen iodine, said the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:24.000]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:32.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:37.000]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:46.000]  We've created the new bubblegum flavored super blue that is spearmint free. Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored super blue toothpaste and more at infowarslife.com

[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000]  This is one that can see.
[03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:26.000]  Mike Cernowitz is taking over right now but I had to get Owen in here because I don't have time to track all this.
[03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:32.000]  But he had one video last week with like 14 million views, 11 million on Facebook, 4 or 5 million which was crazy.
[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:35.000]  I don't have time to keep track of this stuff. We fire and forget.
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:44.000]  And then they had like 20 something other videos that you, Millie Weaver did and some of the new crew did a great job on as well.
[03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:49.000]  And it was like all of them had like 100,000, 500,000, a million views and they just keep getting bigger and bigger.
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:57.000]  And then I noticed all these little clips on television, you name it, of them going, look, children cuss at the evil right winger.
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000]  How good they are.
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000]  And I noticed those videos had millions of views.
[03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:09.000]  When I say 25 million views of your videos and the crew's videos just at anti-Trump demonstrations where they're out protesting.
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:17.000]  He's in Texas to bring more aid to the hurricane victims and to create unity and kiss white, Hispanic and black babies.
[03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000]  And just human babies with red blood.
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:22.000]  I'm going to say of races, the human race.
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:27.000]  And then they're just hatefully wanting this to destroy Florida because it went Republican.
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000]  It is the biggest group of idiocy.
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:32.000]  And now they're saying you called a little girl.
[03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:34.000]  It's in a bunch of different fake publications.
[03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:40.000]  You call a little girl, Mr. or man, and that's why she came over and told you F off and all this.
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:47.000]  No, we're going to play the video of what you said, but the point is they're celebrating her cussing at you.
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000]  That was the first wave a few days ago.
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:53.000]  This was on the way over the weekend, but they reported on it a few days later where they noticed it had millions of views.
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:10:03.000]  Then they go, oh, it happened because other stuff happened before, but they're only showing you a 17 second clip when we've got the 20 minute chunks up there that we didn't.
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:04.000]  But they lie.
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:09.000]  They say something happened in the newspapers that isn't on the tape, but they don't show you the full tape.
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:17.000]  They edit it because they're liars from their father, the hemorrhoid of Satan, George Soros.
[03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:18.000]  Here's the clip.
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:19.000]  How are you, young man?
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  I'm good.
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:22.000]  Pause again.
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:23.000]  Rewind that.
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:24.000]  How are you doing, ma'am?
[03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  You always say, how are you doing, ma'am?
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:26.000]  That's how I was raised.
[03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:29.000]  A lot of people say to women, too, how are you doing, ma'am?
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:31.000]  I say, how are you doing, ma'am?
[03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000]  Sometimes I'll say, dude.
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:42.000]  But the point is, they've changed the subject off of their rat-like, brainwashed, portal child at a public event, so there's no privacy implied coming up cussing at you.
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:44.000]  Let's play the creature.
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:46.000]  How are you, young man?
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:48.000]  You're an idiot.
[03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:50.000]  Wow, who taught you that language?
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:52.000]  My mother.
[03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:54.000]  So your mother taught you that foul language?
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:56.000]  That's a boy or a girl.
[03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:58.000]  Well, we should never assume race, right?
[03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:01.000]  I'm not being mean. I keep saying it's a girl. Maybe it's not.
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:02.000]  I don't mean that mean.
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:04.000]  We should never assume sex, right?
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.000]  I mean, we should never assume gender. That's what the left says.
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:09.000]  But if you notice, Alex, she was actually filming me.
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000]  She had her camera out filming me.
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:12.000]  I think it's a girl.
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:14.000]  She was following me around for five minutes.
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  By the way, can you do a report with clips of this later showing the full report what actually happened?
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:21.000]  Yeah, we can do it on the war room today.
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:22.000]  That's coming up at three o'clock.
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:24.000]  Okay, let's get Sernovich in here.
[03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:29.000]  I know you got a big full plate here doing an awesome job and we pop it in the war room as well at Sernovich on Twitter.
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:30.000]  Everybody should follow you.
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:31.000]  I'm at Real Alex Jones.
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:32.000]  Tell folks where you're at Owen.
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:35.000]  All I do is Owen on Twitter and at War Room Show on Twitter.
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:36.000]  And it's key to do that.
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:37.000]  And it's key to retweet us.
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:38.000]  And it's key to Facebook us.
[03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:45.000]  And it's key to tell people word of mouth because that's how we're winning against the enemy's full onslaught histories happening.
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:47.000]  Mike Sernovich, what do you make of this latest attack?
[03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:48.000]  How panicked they are.
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:50.000]  And then B, you were here two days ago.
[03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:51.000]  You were also here yesterday.
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:52.000]  You're back in California.
[03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:54.000]  You shed on air with me.
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:55.000]  Earth changes.
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:56.000]  Look for more earthquakes.
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:11:57.000]  Look for more of the storms.
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000]  Now, two more hurricanes have formed.
[03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:01.000]  Political stuff all following.
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:05.000]  More sunspots, massive solar storms, human awakening, singularity.
[03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:07.000]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:09.000]  What's happening?
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  Yeah, a big earthquake in Mexico, a potential tsunami.
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:20.000]  I've now read reports that there's a category for a hurricane kind of floating around in the ocean too.
[03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:22.000]  Yeah, Jose.
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:23.000]  There you go.
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:24.000]  Yeah.
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:28.000]  So there's a strong earthquake in modern history in Mexico.
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:29.000]  Right.
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:30.000]  Exactly.
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:37.000]  And it's so bad now that even the LA Times has a preparedness guide about how to prepare for an earthquake.
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:38.000]  So I think it's funny.
[03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:43.000]  They go, oh my God, Alex Jones sells survival food.
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:48.000]  Oh, but if you have an earthquake to be prepared for an earthquake, you should have food and water stored in your house.
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:50.000]  It's like, well, wait a minute.
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  Wait a minute, which is it?
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  I thought that, I thought you weren't supposed to prepare for a disaster and that buying food is a scam and you shouldn't buy survival food.
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.000]  Well, remember the best-selling author that wrote the game?
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:05.000]  He also wrote that book about preparedness called Emergency.
[03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:06.000]  They said that was cookie.
[03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:07.000]  Governments dig in.
[03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.000]  They all have backup, but we're not supposed to.
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:10.000]  Right.
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:14.000]  So now the LA Times is saying, well, you need to prepare for the earthquake.
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:15.000]  So they should apologize.
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:24.000]  I think that they owe everybody in the preparedness community an apology for ridiculing people who want nothing more than for other people to be safe and have.
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:29.000]  Because the more our neighbors are prepared, the more we're prepared because we're only prepared and things collapse.
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:30.000]  We're going to get robbed and killed.
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:36.000]  So a lot of what other people be prepared and self-sufficient and wealthy is really selfishness.
[03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:44.000]  Being a patriot, being into free market, wanting others to do well, I believe is the ultimate form of selfishness, but a good selfishness.
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:45.000]  Right.
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.000]  A rising tide lifts all boats.
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:57.000]  The more that you can build, there's actually, it's been proven mathematically that the more people you have, every time population doubles, the culture and the goodness increase is 15%.
[03:13:57.000 --> 03:14:01.000]  There's also a downside to it too, but this has been mathematically modeled.
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:04.000]  And that is why when more people prosper, everybody prospers.
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:12.000]  Another interesting thing, I don't know if you've talked about yet, but did you know that Stephen Colbert now has come out as a Nazi and he's throwing up Nazi salutes?
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:14.000]  Have you guys talked about that yet?
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:18.000]  Yes, I haven't gotten to it yet, but again, because there's no real Nazis out there.
[03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:25.000]  He's got to invoke it as the actor he is to get everyone upset, like the red cape to a bull, telling folks, see it exists.
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:31.000]  We can't get any of our made up Nazis, paid for by the Southern Barbie Law Center to march anymore, because patriots will kick their ass.
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:34.000]  So, so, and our antiphas exposed.
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:36.000]  So I'll just come out and pose as a Nazi.
[03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:37.000]  Yeah, pull that up, guys.
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:39.000]  Stephen Colbert comes out as a Nazi.
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:42.000]  Yeah, no, so I don't believe that it's satire.
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:50.000]  I believe that Colbert is actually a Nazi and he, because if they take our satire and treat her literally, then it would only be fair for us to treat them literally.
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:51.000]  So I agree.
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:52.000]  So tell folks what he's done.
[03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:54.000]  Why is he supporting at all Fetler?
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:55.000]  Why does he hate Jews?
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:56.000]  Why does he hate blacks?
[03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:59.000]  Why does Stephen Colbert want to kill Mexican children?
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:00.000]  Exactly.
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:03.000]  Why does Colbert want to put Jews in concentration camps?
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  Because he has come out as a Nazi and because everything that you and I have ever said is, of course, serious and nothing is ever satire, then that must also be true of Colbert.
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:16.000]  So I believe that Colbert has always wanted to come out as a Nazi.
[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:19.000]  And now he finally has that opportunity.
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:20.000]  So he kind of looks like one.
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:22.000]  You look like a good Nazi.
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:23.000]  Yeah.
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:24.000]  So he's a Nazi.
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:26.000]  This is not an ironic thing that he did.
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:28.000]  So Nazi Colbert is now.
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:34.000]  When is NBC or whatever? Is he on NBC, right?
[03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  I don't know.
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:38.000]  Are they going to let him go after he became an avowed Nazi?
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:40.000]  I mean, I'm asking, when are they going to repudiate?
[03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:44.000]  Because even if they say it's a joke, Nazi stuff's no joking matter.
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:46.000]  When we've joked about it, they say we're Nazis.
[03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:48.000]  So I think he should be fired immediately.
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:50.000]  I mean, the boycott should start right now.
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:53.000]  Until he disavows Nazis, I can only assume he's a Nazi.
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:55.000]  I can only assume he's a Nazi until he does.
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:16:00.000]  Well, I made the joke and said that Congressman Schiff is a wee wee sucker.
[03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:01.000]  That means Brown knows her.
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:03.000]  The establishment, I wasn't even bashing gay people.
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:07.000]  And they said that I literally, you know, was like attacking or wanted to murder people over it.
[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:12.000]  So, but then when he called Trump Putin's cockholster, that was okay.
[03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:14.000]  Yeah, that wasn't homophobic.
[03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:16.000]  But I want him to disavow Nazis.
[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:19.000]  That's what I'd like to see on his show, too, is where you should start.
[03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:20.000]  When will he countdown?
[03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:24.000]  When will he after this insulting Holocaust survivors strike?
[03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:25.000]  We should start a countdown.
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:28.000]  Days that Stephen Colbert has been outed as a Nazi.
[03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:29.000]  Just keep the countdown.
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:30.000]  Here's the problem.
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:32.000]  His show's only got two or three million viewers.
[03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:34.000]  Oh, and you have more than that a day now.
[03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:35.000]  And so did Cernovich.
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:36.000]  I think people finally get this.
[03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:38.000]  Oh, there was a story out.
[03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:41.000]  Rotten Tomatoes killed Hollywood.
[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:44.000]  They were reporting in the New York Times last week.
[03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:47.000]  Okay, so people being able to vote on films they like,
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:49.000]  instead of critics killed Hollywood, no.
[03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:52.000]  Hollywood sold out the People's Liberation Army for funding
[03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:55.000]  and made films for Chinese propaganda.
[03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:58.000]  So almost all films are approved by Chinese communists now.
[03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:01.000]  It makes the films really dumb down and stupid.
[03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:03.000]  And people are leaving Hollywood in droves.
[03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:07.000]  Computers and technology and lenses being less expensive
[03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000]  allow more people to prolificate.
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.000]  So there's more media now.
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:14.000]  Hollywood lost its monopoly through hubris and ignorance,
[03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:16.000]  not through Rotten Tomatoes.
[03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:20.000]  Hollywood I announced five years ago is dead, Cernovich.
[03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:22.000]  Get the break.
[03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:23.000]  Yeah.
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:26.000]  Well, too much pedophilia going on in Hollywood is the problem is
[03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:29.000]  they need to purge themselves of pedophiles and pedophile
[03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:32.000]  enablers like Meryl Streep who said that Roman Polanski
[03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:34.000]  who annually raped a 13-year-old girl.
[03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:36.000]  It's okay to kidnap 13-year-olds and rape them in the rear end
[03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:37.000]  according to Meryl Streep.
[03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:40.000]  Are you being a pedophile fob again, Cernovich?
[03:17:40.000 --> 03:17:41.000]  Exactly.
[03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:45.000]  So Hollywood needs to purge the pedophiles from their network
[03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:47.000]  because the pedophiles are sucking away all the energy.
[03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:49.000]  By the way, I'm not being sarcastic.
[03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:51.000]  They're already banning Jihad Watch Off PayPal.
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:53.000]  They're already trying to arrest people in Europe
[03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:56.000]  or kicking them out of school for criticizing ISIS,
[03:17:56.000 --> 03:17:57.000]  saying it's Islamophobic.
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:18:00.000]  We're coming close to Cernovich being kicked off Twitter
[03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:03.000]  and Facebook for not wanting your daughter or son to be grabbed
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:06.000]  off the school bus or out of the backyard and taken to a barn
[03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:09.000]  and tied down and raped before their throat slit.
[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:12.000]  Do you want to apologize for putting down child kidnappers
[03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:16.000]  and child molesters and ISIS right now?
[03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:19.000]  Yeah, pedophilophobia is what they're calling it now
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:23.000]  that people who will not accept that pedophilia is a medical condition
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:24.000]  and not a crime.
[03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:28.000]  As the salon has said, pedophilia is a disorder, not a crime.
[03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:32.000]  So they should be able to watch your children drive the school buses,
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:33.000]  take care of your children.
[03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:37.000]  It would be discriminatory for you to not make pornographic images
[03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:39.000]  on a cake for a pedophile.
[03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:42.000]  So if a pedophile wants a naked child on a cake,
[03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:44.000]  then you have to give that for the pedophile
[03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:46.000]  or else you will be a pedophile phobe
[03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:48.000]  and then you will be, you know, banished from the internet.
[03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:50.000]  So this is true.
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:51.000]  So the Hollywood, the pedophilia...
[03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:53.000]  Oh, yeah, it's the New York Times saying it's...
[03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:56.000]  No, it's demons.
[03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:59.000]  Throughout history, Satanic people have wanted children in innocence.
[03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:01.000]  They want to destroy the innocence.
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:04.000]  They're not attracted to developed, normal, sexual people.
[03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  They're attacking normalcy.
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:10.000]  They are using our openness and the fact that we are not discriminatory against us.
[03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:13.000]  They are a cancer that must be routed out.
[03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:17.000]  Yeah, so that's why Hollywood is collapsing.
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:19.000]  They want to blame rotten tomatoes.
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:21.000]  And they, by the way, they know we're waking up.
[03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:23.000]  That's why they've got the New York Times
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:25.000]  basically endorsing pedophilia now.
[03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:29.000]  Well, we've got more on the collapse of Hollywood during the war room today.
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:32.000]  But when we talk about a sign of the times and we mentioned the hurricanes,
[03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:35.000]  we mentioned the earthquakes, you've got wildfires and LA,
[03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:37.000]  you've got all this stuff going on.
[03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:40.000]  But let's not forget about these sycophant liberals in the streets,
[03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:42.000]  these sycophant liberals in governments.
[03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:43.000]  And let me bring that up.
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:45.000]  I skipped this break and I'm going to skip the 50s.
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:46.000]  So he gets his time back.
[03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:47.000]  You know, Mike's a busy guy.
[03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:48.000]  I don't want to run over his time.
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:50.000]  And hopefully he'll come on with you on the war room.
[03:19:50.000 --> 03:19:51.000]  He's been one of the co-hosts of that.
[03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:52.000]  But he just got back.
[03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:56.000]  Mike Sernovich, what do you make of children running up, cussing, screaming at him?
[03:19:56.000 --> 03:19:59.000]  And then he had people in a store last night come up and say,
[03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:01.000]  you were mean to that little girl.
[03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:04.000]  So it's just anything that happens, they never take responsibility.
[03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:06.000]  They turn it around on us.
[03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:07.000]  Yes.
[03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:11.000]  I actually, one of the most disturbing images I've ever captured at a protest
[03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:17.000]  was at the so-called Peahat March or the Women's March during Inauguration Week.
[03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:23.000]  And it was a young girl who had a sign that said, touch my, you know what?
[03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:27.000]  And I didn't even take a picture of her because she was so young.
[03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:28.000]  I just took a picture of the sign.
[03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:31.000]  If I posted a picture of her, that would be like creepy.
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:32.000]  You couldn't even do that.
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:37.000]  And I thought some parent gave, she was like 11 years old or something like that.
[03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:39.000]  Oh yeah, the left is into corrupting their children.
[03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:41.000]  Because they say the left abort your child.
[03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:42.000]  It's a sacrament.
[03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:43.000]  Gloria Steinem does.
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:47.000]  Medusa magazine says, if you have a white baby, you know, kill it in the womb.
[03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:51.000]  It's against the patriarchy because all whites are part of the patriarchy.
[03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:52.000]  All this mental illness, but you're right.
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:53.000]  They don't kill their kids.
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:58.000]  They go, the next step, it's about degrading them and turning them into flathrags.
[03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:02.000]  Yeah, their own children because I said, well, how old are you, right?
[03:21:02.000 --> 03:21:08.000]  11 years old holding a sign, talking about her, you know, female and sexualizing it too.
[03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:13.000]  I mean, the, um, I posted the picture even without her face, but I was so creeped out
[03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:16.000]  by the experience that I even deleted the picture.
[03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:20.000]  I was like, I don't even, you know, the, the car, the sacrament is aborting children.
[03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:23.000]  Whether you're for abortion or not, it's a sacrament for them.
[03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:24.000]  They now admit it's a sacrament.
[03:21:24.000 --> 03:21:28.000]  It's a religious icon of, you know, taking the wine, but it's killing your baby, killing
[03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:29.000]  someone else's.
[03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:30.000]  We're not judging women that did it.
[03:21:30.000 --> 03:21:31.000]  The point is you didn't mean it that way.
[03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:33.000]  It's not that way to them.
[03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:34.000]  It's a sacrament.
[03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  It's a sacrament to abort the baby.
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:37.000]  It's a sacrament to corrupt your children.
[03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:38.000]  It's a sacrament.
[03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:42.000]  I've noticed with these liberal women to medicalize their children and brain damage them with
[03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:43.000]  Ritalin and Prozac.
[03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:45.000]  It's a sacrament to hurt children.
[03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:46.000]  Yeah.
[03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:48.000]  That's why they're doing it.
[03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:49.000]  And they're so debased.
[03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:51.000]  I just, I thought, what a failure.
[03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:55.000]  Did nobody say, Hey, this is a young girl.
[03:21:55.000 --> 03:21:57.000]  She shouldn't be sexualized.
[03:21:57.000 --> 03:21:59.000]  She should be allowed to have a normal childhood.
[03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:02.000]  These parents, you know, they're probably talking.
[03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:07.000]  Well, for example, Teen Vogue, a Christian woman got banned from Twitter because she said
[03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:12.000]  that Teen Vogue should not be telling 13 year olds to have anal sex and giving guys on
[03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:14.000]  how a 13 year old can have anal sex.
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:18.000]  And this is, by the way, my, since you mentioned this, I want to play it again.
[03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:19.000]  We skipped this break.
[03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:20.000]  Camille Pagli came out two days ago.
[03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:24.000]  I meant to give us a clip last few days with so much news and I don't care if Camille
[03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:25.000]  Pagli likes women.
[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:27.000]  I mean, I'm not judging her as the point.
[03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:28.000]  I like women too.
[03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:29.000]  I identify as a lesbian.
[03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:30.000]  That's not even a joke.
[03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:33.000]  Just, I don't like the whole politicalness going after kids sexualizing it.
[03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:35.000]  Pagli is like, absolutely, leave kids alone.
[03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:36.000]  Let them have their own life.
[03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:38.000]  Let them make their own decisions.
[03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:42.000]  Be, you know, be tolerant, but don't target people to bully them.
[03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:47.000]  And now they're trying to sexualize kids and tell them you're another sex while they're
[03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:48.000]  raining down these chemicals.
[03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:51.000]  This is in Brave New World in 1935.
[03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:55.000]  Huxley gave an interview two years after it was published and said, this is the plan
[03:22:55.000 --> 03:23:00.000]  by the Royal Society of Eugenics to end the proletariat through chemicals and the end
[03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:01.000]  of sex.
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:04.000]  First, we're going to have a sexual revolution to end the family.
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:08.000]  Then, once we've ended that, we're going to break down sex itself, claim there's no
[03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:11.000]  genders, and then we're going to sterilize people.
[03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:12.000]  And you know what?
[03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:13.000]  They're doing it.
[03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:14.000]  Here's Camille Pagli.
[03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:20.000]  I think that the transgender propagandists, okay, make wildly inflated claims about the
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:29.000]  multiplicity of gender and the sex reassignment surgery, even today, with all of its advances,
[03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:33.000]  cannot, in fact, change anyone's sex, okay?
[03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:36.000]  You can define yourself as a trans man or a trans woman.
[03:23:36.000 --> 03:23:39.000]  It's one of these new gradations along the scale.
[03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:44.000]  But ultimately, every single cell in the human body, the DNA in that cell remains coded for
[03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:46.000]  your biological birth.
[03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:49.000]  So there are a lot of lies being propagated at the present moment.
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:52.000]  Okay, which I think is not in anyone's best interest, okay?
[03:23:52.000 --> 03:24:01.000]  What I'm concerned about is the popularity and the availability of sex reassignment surgery.
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:09.000]  So it's someone who is feeling, doesn't feel that he or she belongs to the biological birth
[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:10.000]  gender.
[03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:13.000]  People are being encouraged to intervene in the process.
[03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:18.000]  Parents are now encouraged to subject the child to procedures that I think are a form
[03:24:18.000 --> 03:24:24.000]  of child abuse, either hormones to slow puberty, okay?
[03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:28.000]  Actual surgical manipulations, et cetera.
[03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:35.000]  I think that this is wrong, that people should wait until they're of an informed age of consent.
[03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:38.000]  Parents should not be doing this to their children.
[03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:40.000]  So that's a moral statement.
[03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:42.000]  It's a tolerant statement.
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:43.000]  I agree with the statement.
[03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:49.000]  The point is that this is artificiality, and you look at the biblical breakdown of this.
[03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:51.000]  Man, a rib's taken genetically.
[03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:55.000]  The woman's created, but the woman actually creates the new humans.
[03:24:55.000 --> 03:24:56.000]  But you look at the genetics.
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:24:59.000]  Women have a second set, the mitochondrial, without them.
[03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:02.000]  Men are like a worker B projection of the female.
[03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  But then you could argue, well, that's because it was, female was made out of us.
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:09.000]  That's why she's got whatever the original coding was and has double the DNA.
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:12.000]  I mean, women, we're all magic, but women are really magic.
[03:25:12.000 --> 03:25:14.000]  This is an attack on their power.
[03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:17.000]  They said, wonder woman's too feminine.
[03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:18.000]  This is a step back.
[03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:20.000]  We don't want a woman that's feminine.
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:21.000]  What do you mean?
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:24.000]  She's smart, she's tough, and she's gorgeous, and she can have babies.
[03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:25.000]  No, no, no.
[03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:26.000]  Women transcend having babies.
[03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:27.000]  You become a man.
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:30.000]  Well, they're destroying the real power.
[03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:32.000]  This is true Satanism, the attack on the woman.
[03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:34.000]  Mike Sernovich.
[03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:36.000]  Yeah, they want to attack.
[03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:42.000]  Again, once you reframe what is going on at the highest level, first principle, it all
[03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:43.000]  makes sense.
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:49.000]  The first principle of the left is destroy all that is beautiful, good, and virtuous.
[03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:51.000]  This is why they support pedophilia.
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:53.000]  This is why they want to destroy femininity.
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:55.000]  This is why Hollywood movies are terrible.
[03:25:55.000 --> 03:25:57.000]  This is why modern art is terrible.
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:26:01.000]  You always want to go back, as Eric Stowell and Marcus really said, taught us about the
[03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:08.000]  first principle, and the first principle of the left is postmodernism, cultural Marxism,
[03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:09.000]  deconstructing.
[03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:11.000]  People can go read the Marxist literature.
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:12.000]  I've read it all.
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:17.000]  This is declassified CIA to destroy the family, make it ugly, make us dysfunctional.
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:18.000]  This is not our opinion.
[03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:19.000]  This is fact.
[03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:21.000]  Yeah, you can go read.
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:25.000]  I read Mark Housa and Fromm and the Frankfurt thinkers all in college.
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.000]  So they want to deconstruct.
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:33.000]  That's why they literally want to destroy like ISIS, they destroy statues because that
[03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:36.000]  is their model, deconstruct everything about the West.
[03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:37.000]  Destroy the past.
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:39.000]  No one has anything to cling to.
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:41.000]  They can now define reality.
[03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:42.000]  Exactly.
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:48.000]  When we say leave all the statues up, all the books, true liberalism, let individuals
[03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:50.000]  make their decision.
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:51.000]  Exactly.
[03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:53.000]  But that isn't the governing principle.
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:58.000]  The governing principle is destroy everything that is beautiful, destroy innocence.
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:00.000]  That is why they support pedophilia.
[03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:02.000]  That's why they give a platform of pedophiles.
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:08.000]  CNN hosted Jacob Schwartz, who was Bill de Blasio's IT guy, caught with thousands of
[03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:13.000]  pornographic images of child, you know, six months old, Bill de Blasio never disavowed.
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:15.000]  CNN never disavowed hosting him.
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:19.000]  Chris Cuomo, who had him on as a featured guest, never disavowed him.
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:23.000]  And the media never told him to because that's what they want.
[03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:26.000]  They want to destroy the innocence of children.
[03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:27.000]  They want to destroy beauty.
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:28.000]  That's their religion.
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:31.000]  Mike, you're coming back and taking over and hope you can pop in on the war room.
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:33.000]  We're going to have Sunday live coverage.
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:34.000]  Please spread the word.
[03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:37.000]  I hope you'll pop in of Hurricane Irma.
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:41.000]  Please, folks, I want to get your take on Irma in a moment before you go to break.
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:42.000]  I'm not going to belabor this.
[03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:45.000]  We don't double prices like Amazon did during a crisis.
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:49.000]  Storeable foods for my patriot, private labeled by info wars, we are able drop significant
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:52.000]  from them to do 50% off.
[03:27:52.000 --> 03:27:53.000]  Never done that before.
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:59.000]  Just for a limited time, just just to be the opposite of Amazon, 57% off on X2.
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  Super mail that was posted in today.
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:01.000]  It didn't.
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:03.000]  So it's going to still be here today, but it will be gone.
[03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:04.000]  Never done those before.
[03:28:04.000 --> 03:28:09.000]  We've got so much more at info wars, live.com, info wars store.com.
[03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:15.000]  Also, AAA 2533139, but just briefly as we go to break, great job.
[03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:17.000]  Oh, and you're coming up in 30 minutes live.
[03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:19.000]  What do you think is going to happen with Irma?
[03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:24.000]  Will it bring us together or what are they going to try to do?
[03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:28.000]  Hi, the people, of course, but it is another opportunity to bring people together.
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:31.000]  I believe very strongly in the people of Miami, very good people.
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:36.000]  Many of them are descendants, descendants of people who fled Castro, many great Americans
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:37.000]  in Florida.
[03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:39.000]  And of course, Florida was a Trump state.
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:44.000]  So that shows again, those are the kind of people who want to make America greater and
[03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:46.000]  make Florida great again, rebuild.
[03:28:46.000 --> 03:28:48.000]  So I'm optimistic about Irma.
[03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:51.000]  I don't think that we're going to have any of the kind of stuff we saw with in Katrina,
[03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:55.000]  because of course that was a very Democrat, liberal area.
[03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:59.000]  And you can kind of see the pattern here where the left predominates and they deconstruct.
[03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:02.000]  Can you imagine if a hurricane hit Chicago?
[03:29:02.000 --> 03:29:03.000]  Good Lord.
[03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:04.000]  Right.
[03:29:04.000 --> 03:29:05.000]  Exactly.
[03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:07.000]  It would be over in Detroit.
[03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:08.000]  It would be over.
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:09.000]  A tornado or something would hit.
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:11.000]  You would have nothing but pillaging.
[03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:13.000]  It would be medieval times.
[03:29:13.000 --> 03:29:19.000]  And that is the end result of deconstructing Western virtue, deconstructing Western values.
[03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:20.000]  That's right.
[03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:21.000]  Etzernovich, stay there.
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:25.000]  Battling for Western civilization, battling for civilization.
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:30.000]  Alex Jones, Owen Schreuer, Mike Sernovich, the entire crew behind the scenes that make
[03:29:30.000 --> 03:29:31.000]  it possible.
[03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:34.000]  But most importantly, you, the viewer and listener, thank you for your prayers.
[03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:35.000]  The words spread the links.
[03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:36.000]  Newswars.com.
[03:29:36.000 --> 03:29:38.000]  More straight ahead.
[03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:40.000]  We're on the march.
[03:29:40.000 --> 03:29:42.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:45.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:50.000 --> 03:29:54.000]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to
[03:29:54.000 --> 03:29:56.000]  America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[03:29:56.000 --> 03:29:58.000]  You're a white male.
[03:29:58.000 --> 03:30:00.000]  You're a white man.
[03:30:00.000 --> 03:30:09.000]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in Infowars live broadcasting.
[03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:15.000]  We are live weekdays from three to six p.m. central at infowars.com slash show and this
[03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:18.000]  YouTube channel right here that you've landed on.

[03:30:24.000 --> 03:30:27.000]  We are going to have the most powerful guests, the most powerful host.
[03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:32.000]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly as well as taking your phone calls.
[03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:36.000]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[03:30:36.000 --> 03:30:39.000]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:41.000]  This is The War Room.
[03:30:50.000 --> 03:30:54.000]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide.
[03:30:54.000 --> 03:30:59.000]  I'm also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the
[03:30:59.000 --> 03:31:00.000]  planet.
[03:31:00.000 --> 03:31:04.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[03:31:04.000 --> 03:31:08.000]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:13.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:13.000 --> 03:31:20.000]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.
[03:31:20.000 --> 03:31:25.000]  It gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[03:31:25.000 --> 03:31:27.000]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:27.000 --> 03:31:31.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[03:31:31.000 --> 03:31:34.000]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:34.000 --> 03:31:38.000]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:38.000 --> 03:31:41.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:31:41.000 --> 03:31:46.000]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup
[03:31:46.000 --> 03:31:50.000]  of my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[03:31:50.000 --> 03:31:54.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own
[03:31:54.000 --> 03:31:59.000]  four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us
[03:31:59.000 --> 03:32:01.000]  through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:32:01.000 --> 03:32:03.000]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield.
[03:32:03.000 --> 03:32:06.000]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:07.000]  It's made in the USA.
[03:32:07.000 --> 03:32:12.000]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[03:32:12.000 --> 03:32:14.000]  the body and it supports the info war.
[03:32:14.000 --> 03:32:16.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:32:16.000 --> 03:32:20.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:25.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier
[03:32:25.000 --> 03:32:26.000]  as you can possibly get.
[03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:30.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[03:32:30.000 --> 03:32:35.000]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[03:32:35.000 --> 03:32:40.000]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[03:32:40.000 --> 03:32:43.000]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:32:43.000 --> 03:32:46.000]  Your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[03:32:46.000 --> 03:32:50.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:32:50.000 --> 03:32:53.000]  We want your soul.
[03:32:53.000 --> 03:32:56.000]  We want your soul.
[03:32:56.000 --> 03:33:03.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:03.000 --> 03:33:07.000]  And now your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:33:07.000 --> 03:33:09.000]  Your stats, your fears.
[03:33:09.000 --> 03:33:10.000]  And we're back.
[03:33:10.000 --> 03:33:11.000]  Mike Cernovich.
[03:33:11.000 --> 03:33:15.000]  By the way, I brought this back.
[03:33:15.000 --> 03:33:17.000]  I was in studio.
[03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:21.000]  I did bring back the chocolate formulation of caveman.
[03:33:21.000 --> 03:33:24.000]  Before I'd had the strawberry, I'd not had the chocolate.
[03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:26.000]  So I did an honest taste test.
[03:33:26.000 --> 03:33:32.000]  And I can tell you this stuff, which is 50% off right now, the caveman troupalia formula,
[03:33:32.000 --> 03:33:33.000]  it's real.
[03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:36.000]  So my, you know, because I get it, I get to be honest.
[03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:38.000]  I'm always honest with people.
[03:33:38.000 --> 03:33:41.000]  That is why some people hate me one day.
[03:33:41.000 --> 03:33:42.000]  They love me the next day.
[03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:43.000]  It is potent.
[03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:45.000]  So I mixed it with water.
[03:33:45.000 --> 03:33:50.000]  And if you mix it with water, you can really taste the, the cumin powder in it,
[03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:52.000]  which is a very potent anti-inflammatory.
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:55.000]  So my advice to people, this is a great product.
[03:33:55.000 --> 03:33:56.000]  I love it.
[03:33:56.000 --> 03:33:57.000]  I use it.
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:33:58.000]  I think it's great.
[03:33:58.000 --> 03:34:01.000]  But if you want to make, mix it up, I wouldn't mix it up with just straight water.
[03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:07.000]  I would use almond milk, cold almond milk at the minimum would be delicious.
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:11.000]  Cold almond milk or blended up almond milk in a banana.
[03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:13.000]  Do they have smoothie recipes on here, by the way?
[03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:17.000]  If they, if they don't, they should, they should get Owen and Alex should be in there making,
[03:34:17.000 --> 03:34:19.000]  making recipes because this is really powerful stuff.
[03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:26.000]  Cause I actually travel with packets of chicken broth because when you're chicken broth and
[03:34:26.000 --> 03:34:28.000]  collagen has been shown to improve joint health.
[03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:31.000]  So that's why I always love when people hate on this stuff.
[03:34:31.000 --> 03:34:33.000]  When people lie about it, I've been doing all the stuff for years.
[03:34:33.000 --> 03:34:38.000]  So whenever I travel, I bring a packet of chicken bone broth.
[03:34:38.000 --> 03:34:39.000]  It's dehydrated.
[03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:45.000]  And then when I go on a plane, when they do that water service or whatever, I don't actually
[03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:47.000]  have them give me a soda.
[03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:49.000]  Usually I have them give me hot water.
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:52.000]  And then I mix up my own chicken broth in it.
[03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:55.000]  And you just drink it like, it tastes kind of like a cup of soup.
[03:34:55.000 --> 03:35:00.000]  So this is all the benefits of chicken broth, which have been shown collagen regeneration.
[03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:02.000]  There's so many great benefits of it.
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:04.000]  Like I said, I've been using it for years.
[03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:07.000]  I never promote anything that I don't do.
[03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:08.000]  I never promote that.
[03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:12.000]  That's my number one rule of anything is if, if I don't use something or have it used
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:15.000]  to personally, then I won't promote it because then people try.
[03:35:15.000 --> 03:35:16.000]  They don't like it.
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:18.000]  Then the trust is gone.
[03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:19.000]  All right.
[03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:21.000]  So what we talk about now is, you know, I don't know.
[03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:25.000]  That's a, that's the great thing about the world we live in today is when I come on,
[03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:27.000]  I don't even know what I'm going to talk about.
[03:35:27.000 --> 03:35:28.000]  I'm just reading articles.
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:33.000]  And I noticed that Vanity Fair had written an article where they threw a bunch of shade
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:34.000]  at me.
[03:35:34.000 --> 03:35:36.000]  They, you know, they, they, they never read our stuff.
[03:35:36.000 --> 03:35:40.000]  And this is just something you have to, this is something that if you're, if you're a
[03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:45.000]  private figure, you, you probably go, why is Mike talk about this all the time?
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:46.000]  Why is Alex talk about this?
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:48.000]  They're just trying to talk about themselves.
[03:35:48.000 --> 03:35:51.000]  But isn't that at all?
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:56.000]  The issue is that when you know yourself and you know what your own books are about,
[03:35:56.000 --> 03:36:00.000]  and then you read an article talking about what your book is about, and it has nothing
[03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:04.000]  to do with what your book is about, then that's the subject that you know.
[03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:05.000]  Well, you can't even trust me.
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:06.000]  Get it right.
[03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:08.000]  So this is a course in Vanity Fair.
[03:36:08.000 --> 03:36:11.000]  They said that, you know, they're, they're talking about female journalists who are
[03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:12.000]  doing well.
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:13.000]  And that's great.
[03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:14.000]  I promote female journalists quite heavily.
[03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:18.000]  Actually, I link, I link heavily to, to everybody doing great work.
[03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:20.000]  But they go news career bowling.
[03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:22.000]  I think that's Eric bowling the Fox news guy.
[03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:23.000]  I don't even know the guy.
[03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:30.000]  Typify the gorilla mindset espoused by macho paleo blogger, Mike Cernovich, in his book
[03:36:30.000 --> 03:36:34.000]  of the same name and owed to dominance that found its golden fulfillment in the candidacy
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:36.000]  and presidency of Donald Trump.
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  The gorilla mindset being the Wagner Ariane, Wagnering prelude to achieving that, achieving
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:47.000]  what Cernovich heralds in his follow book as the MAGA mindset, the inner power of Trumpian
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:52.000]  transformation, the elevates the alphas from the also ranks.
[03:36:52.000 --> 03:36:54.000]  That's a great sentence actually.
[03:36:54.000 --> 03:36:59.000]  I love, I love when, even though the critic got it wrong, because gorilla mindset is not
[03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:00.000]  about anything macho.
[03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:03.000]  I just put a gorilla on the cover because it's cool.
[03:37:03.000 --> 03:37:08.000]  And because of the associations people make, but gorilla mindset never had anything to
[03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:10.000]  do with how can it be more macho?
[03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:12.000]  How can you dominate other people?
[03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:16.000]  Gorilla mindset was always a book about how do you control your thoughts and emotions?
[03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:21.000]  It's a classic book on if anything of, of not being an aggressive person, I can be aggressive
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:26.000]  but talk to people who meet me in real life and very friendly, super polite.
[03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:28.000]  I rarely lose my composure.
[03:37:28.000 --> 03:37:29.000]  I'm not perfect.
[03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:33.000]  I don't go around trying to bump into people and start conflict with people.
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:36.000]  But if they want that, then they could have it, right?
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:38.000]  If people want to bring it, they can bring it.
[03:37:38.000 --> 03:37:42.000]  But I really love that sentence of Wagnerian prelude.
[03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:46.000]  I like that reference to Wagner because Wagner and Nietzsche had a major beef.
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:51.000]  So Nietzsche went after Wagner because Wagner was anti-Semitic.
[03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:55.000]  So I don't, I don't know if this guy, this author here was trying to do some kind of code
[03:37:55.000 --> 03:38:00.000]  about anti-Semitism or make a Nietzschean reference or what he has going on here.
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:02.000]  But that is a good sentence.
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:04.000]  That is, it's actually a beautiful sentence.
[03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:06.000]  So I want to thank him.
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:10.000]  But again, though, it shows that, well, Donald, you just read the books.
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:14.000]  All they're going to do is go on Amazon, buy the Kindle book, and then they can read it.
[03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:18.000]  And then what they do is they find out that it doesn't have anything to do with anything macho.
[03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:22.000]  There's never alpha males never even mentioning that at one time.
[03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:26.000]  And that's just, again, it just typifies the media.
[03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:27.000]  They review our books.
[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:29.000]  They criticize our products.
[03:38:29.000 --> 03:38:34.000]  But yeah, I have 919 reviews on justyamazon.com page.
[03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:39.000]  How many books on Amazon have 919 reviews, right?
[03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:41.000]  Crazy amount of reviews.
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:46.000]  And if you read it, there's all kinds of reviews from women and men and teenagers and grandparents.
[03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:48.000]  Some people buy it for graduation presents.
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:53.000]  They buy it because they want to control their emotions and not be frazzled.
[03:38:53.000 --> 03:38:55.000]  Because here's what I've always believed.
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:38:57.000]  And this is because Alex and I were talking about it the other day.
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:38:59.000]  Alex goes, Sernovich, how did you get into this stuff?
[03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:00.000]  Right?
[03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:03.000]  Because a lot of people view me as kind of coming from out of nowhere.
[03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:05.000]  So I was like, come on, man, like, yeah.
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:07.000]  Sernovich, how'd you get into this, Sernovich?
[03:39:07.000 --> 03:39:09.000]  How'd you get into this?
[03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:14.000]  Well, the answer is that I always believed that if you want a functioning government,
[03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:16.000]  you have to control yourself first.
[03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:18.000]  You have to get your own life in order.
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:20.000]  You have to control your own issues.
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:26.000]  So for me, I had to start off with a fundamental quest that, well, why do I, you know, get in bad moods?
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:27.000]  Why do I have anger sometimes?
[03:39:27.000 --> 03:39:29.000]  Why do I get frustrated sometimes?
[03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:36.000]  Well, if I'm getting frustrated, then how could I be controlling society and telling people in society what they need to do?
[03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:38.000]  I need to worry about myself, right?
[03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:43.000]  So you see all over, these celebrities are having complete and total meltdowns.
[03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:49.000]  Somebody on Twitter earlier, 7 million followers, she said that she has ground down her tooth.
[03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:57.000]  She had to have a false tooth put in because she was grinding her teeth because of anxiety from Donald Trump.
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:39:59.000]  We have to fix that collectively.
[03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:01.000]  We have to fix as a nation.
[03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:04.000]  So that's why I told Alex, well, that's how I got into all this, man.
[03:40:04.000 --> 03:40:10.000]  Because I viewed it as we have to fix ourselves first and it all ties into a course.
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:14.000]  And then because I'd never heard of a lot of the globalism stuff that I got from Alex.
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:19.000]  But then I realized, yeah, Trump is ruining my teeth.
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:21.000]  My dentist advised me to stop reading my news.
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:24.000]  And this is, I don't even know if this is the one from today.
[03:40:24.000 --> 03:40:25.000]  There are so many of these.
[03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:31.000]  So people say they're grinding their teeth because they're sitting around meditating on Trump, essentially.
[03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:36.000]  But if they had read Guerrilla Mindset, they would know that if he bothers you that much, just don't watch him.
[03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:38.000]  I don't hate watching anybody.
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:42.000]  If I laugh at Hillary Clinton, I can't wait to get Hillary Clinton's new book.
[03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:44.000]  I actually pre-ordered her new book.
[03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:46.000]  I'm excited to read her new book.
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:47.000]  It won't make me angry.
[03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:50.000]  I'm going to just laugh all the way through it.
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:40:55.000]  So people who are angry all the time, they would, if they actually read Guerrilla Mindset, they would know.
[03:40:55.000 --> 03:41:03.000]  And then you need to change your focus because if you're focusing on subjects that make you rot your teeth, focus on something else.
[03:41:03.000 --> 03:41:13.000]  But then it all tied in to, that's why I aligned a lot when I met with Alex, is that the globalists want us to be spiritually bankrupt.
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:16.000]  That is why they attack churches.
[03:41:16.000 --> 03:41:23.000]  Because I've always said, I don't care what your religion is, as long as you're trying to become a better person, trying to live a more virtuous life.
[03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:30.000]  You don't even care if you have a religion as long as you're trying to have some kind of connection to something bigger than yourself.
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:36.000]  But the left, they want to destroy our religion because the people are spiritually bankrupt.
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:38.000]  It's easier to make these people frazzled.
[03:41:38.000 --> 03:41:40.000]  It's easier to make people lose hope.
[03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:42.000]  It's easier to make people sad.
[03:41:42.000 --> 03:41:49.000]  And then that is how you corrupt and destroy a whole nation because the nation is built upon its people.
[03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:56.000]  The people have no spiritual coherence and no view that there's anything worth living for other than their own hedonistic desires.
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:42:00.000]  And believe me, I've been there too. We've all been there.
[03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:02.000]  We all know where a life of hedonism lives.
[03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:11.000]  And you ask anybody who's lived a life of hedonism, it leads to feelings of emptiness and feelings of moral bankruptcy, right?
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:12.000]  The left's war on religion.
[03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:22.000]  So that is why the left is attacking religion. The only time the left brings up religion is if they can use it against somebody.
[03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:26.000]  For example, on 60 Minutes, Charlie Rose asked Bannon.
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:34.000]  He said, how can you oppose DACA if you're a Catholic and one of your cardinals, a Catholic cardinal, supports DACA?
[03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:41.000]  And a lot of people go, why doesn't that Charlie Rose ask Catholics who believe in abortion?
[03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:42.000]  Right?
[03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:52.000]  So if you're a Catholic and you support abortion, why isn't Charlie Rose asking you, well, how can you support abortion when the cardinal's opposed it when it's against doctrine?
[03:42:52.000 --> 03:42:53.000]  They don't ask that.
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:59.000]  So the only time the media brings out religion is if they can use it as a cudgel.
[03:42:59.000 --> 03:43:06.000]  So they're trying to attack Bannon and say, well, Bannon, you need to support DACA because some cardinal supports DACA.
[03:43:06.000 --> 03:43:13.000]  Bannon, I mean, the clip is amazing. Bannon says, well, they only support it because they are spiritually bankrupt.
[03:43:13.000 --> 03:43:15.000]  And that's the only way they can get people to attend church.
[03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:19.000]  As anybody who goes to church knows church attendance is down.
[03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:21.000]  People go, why is church attendance down?
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:23.000]  Because there's an emptiness now.
[03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:40.000]  It is a very much, it's about veneer, botox, how pretty you can look, how nice your car can be, that's what's become, and how quote, unquote, tolerant you can be, even though that means tolerating pedophiles and tolerating child abuse of children.
[03:43:40.000 --> 03:43:51.000]  Again, 12 years old, the child changed his mind about being transgendered, but it already undergone the hormonal therapies, right?
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:44:00.000]  And you think, in what world do you let a child go alter the hormonal profile for the rest of that child's life?
[03:44:00.000 --> 03:44:03.000]  Why won't anybody stand up and speak out against that?
[03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:05.000]  Well, because they're spiritually bankrupt.
[03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:09.000]  Because there isn't love for each other anymore.
[03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:16.000]  Because they say they want us to have love for each other, but then they show up and throw bricks at people.
[03:44:16.000 --> 03:44:18.000]  Then they commit property damage.
[03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:23.000]  They won't disavow Antifa. Tim Kaine would not disavow Antifa.
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:29.000]  Ask yourself that, a United States senator, will his son is Antifa?
[03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:30.000]  This is proven.
[03:44:30.000 --> 03:44:42.000]  So Tim Kaine, a vice presidential candidate, will not disavow Antifa, even though Antifa is classified by multiple state and federal organizations as a terrorist organization.
[03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:51.000]  And moreover, even the very liberal left-wing California may consider Antifa a street gang.
[03:44:51.000 --> 03:44:53.000]  So seriously, think about that.
[03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:57.000]  That's why we, you know, Alex and I have talked about the true nature of reality and why it's so important.
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:45:01.000]  A lot of people go, sir, if it's just talk about the news, I just want to talk about the news.
[03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:05.000]  I don't want to talk about mindset and philosophy and the true nature of reality.
[03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:08.000]  Just give us the headlines of the day.
[03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:19.000]  But if all you get are the headlines of the day and you don't have a philosophical mooring, a worldview to contextualize what you're reading, then you're swaying to and fro.
[03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:20.000]  You're reacting to the headlines.
[03:45:20.000 --> 03:45:24.000]  I know people that go, Sirnevich, I watch the news and I get in a bad mood.
[03:45:24.000 --> 03:45:25.000]  What can I do?
[03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:26.000]  And I go, don't watch the news.
[03:45:26.000 --> 03:45:29.000]  And they go, but I need to be an involved citizen.
[03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:31.000]  I need to participate in democracy.
[03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:34.000]  How can you tell me not to watch the news that's so irresponsible?
[03:45:34.000 --> 03:45:42.000]  Well, because if watching the news affects you emotionally, how are you going to treat your family?
[03:45:42.000 --> 03:45:44.000]  How are you going to treat your children?
[03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:56.000]  If you're so worked up by the news that you're screaming at the television when your child wants to hang out or talk or commune with you, but you're so angry, that cascade effect of being negative.
[03:45:56.000 --> 03:46:06.000]  So then what you realize once you understand the true nature of reality is most of what you see on the news is a psyop designed to make you feel afraid.
[03:46:06.000 --> 03:46:08.000]  That way you'll abuse your children.
[03:46:08.000 --> 03:46:10.000]  That way you'll abuse your loved ones.
[03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:13.000]  That way you'll abuse each other and not be good to each other.
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:21.000]  So the media knows when they're running a psyops on people that this will create more destruction and hurt and harm in the world.
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:23.000]  This will make the world a worse place.
[03:46:23.000 --> 03:46:26.000]  This is another part of deconstructing Western values.
[03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:32.000]  That's why you very rarely, very rarely do you ever read any uplifting news.
[03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:38.000]  Very rarely will the news show you inspirational stories.
[03:46:38.000 --> 03:46:42.000]  Rarely will they say, look, we're coming together as a people.
[03:46:42.000 --> 03:46:44.000]  We're coming together as a nation.
[03:46:44.000 --> 03:46:45.000]  Isn't this beautiful?
[03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:46.000]  Look at everybody.
[03:46:46.000 --> 03:46:50.000]  They didn't even want to show you the pictures of Trump and Hurricane Harvey.
[03:46:50.000 --> 03:46:53.000]  Multiple people go, those were stage pictures.
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:57.000]  Multiple people go, Trump never met a Hurricane Harvey victim.
[03:46:57.000 --> 03:46:59.000]  They didn't even want to show the images.
[03:46:59.000 --> 03:47:06.000]  They want to saturate people with images that will make them fearful, make them afraid, make them feel sick.
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:08.000]  The ACLU will do this actually.
[03:47:08.000 --> 03:47:13.000]  Owen and I had a great segment on yesterday, a great segment if I do say so myself.
[03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:19.000]  Owen and I had a great segment of the war room yesterday where we deconstructed to use their terminology to the left.
[03:47:19.000 --> 03:47:24.000]  We deconstructed an ACLU letter.
[03:47:24.000 --> 03:47:30.000]  The ACLU was lie, lie, lie, fear, fear, fear, give us money.
[03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:38.000]  It was a fantastic segment and we should annotate that as a case study in how the ACLU is running psyopsis on people
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:42.000]  to intimidate people, to make people afraid, all in an effort to raise more money.
[03:47:42.000 --> 03:47:50.000]  So the letter just said basically Trump wants to kill all of you, throw you all in prison, give us money.
[03:47:50.000 --> 03:47:52.000]  Money for what?
[03:47:52.000 --> 03:47:59.000]  Money that they can launder like the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has put $69 million in offshore accounts.
[03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:01.000]  That can't be touched by lawsuits.
[03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:04.000]  That can't be touched by any regulatory body.
[03:48:04.000 --> 03:48:06.000]  Money completely off the grid.
[03:48:06.000 --> 03:48:08.000]  That's funding God know what.
[03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:14.000]  So once you, that's again, that's why we have to always go big picture time to time and just not talk about the news
[03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:17.000]  and just not talk about the headline.
[03:48:17.000 --> 03:48:21.000]  Exactly the segment is how the ACLU is spreading hate and hysteria.
[03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:24.000]  So you can watch Owen just look at that letter line by line.
[03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:29.000]  You can look at what's highlighted and the lies being told in that very letter.
[03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:31.000]  And then at the very end, donate now.
[03:48:31.000 --> 03:48:33.000]  Big, big thing at the bottom of the end.
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:35.000]  And Owen even circled on the page.
[03:48:35.000 --> 03:48:36.000]  Give us your money.
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:38.000]  You're so afraid.
[03:48:38.000 --> 03:48:39.000]  You're so helpless.
[03:48:39.000 --> 03:48:41.000]  Your life is going to be over.
[03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:42.000]  Give us money.
[03:48:42.000 --> 03:48:43.000]  That is what they're doing.
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:52.000]  We're seeing that from all of the people on the mainstream media down to the left wing advocacy organization.
[03:48:52.000 --> 03:48:56.000]  So you can't, you can't, you can't understand the news.
[03:48:56.000 --> 03:49:03.000]  If you don't understand the war for your mind, if you don't understand that the news has to be contextualized.
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:09.000]  Relative to the mission, the goal, the agenda, the big agenda.
[03:49:09.000 --> 03:49:15.000]  The big agenda is to destroy your mindset, to destroy your family, to destroy your children,
[03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:19.000]  to get everybody who lives next to you to distrust each other.
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:26.000]  It got to the point where one of the producers of Infowars, his mom had a sticker Infowars.com,
[03:49:26.000 --> 03:49:28.000]  a very tasteful sticker by the way.
[03:49:28.000 --> 03:49:34.000]  It wasn't a CNN as ISIS sticker, it wasn't a, it wasn't a big crazy sticker.
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:40.000]  It was just a very tasteful, elegant Steve Jobs type of design, a John Ivy style design.
[03:49:40.000 --> 03:49:43.000]  And it's just at Infowars.com.
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:49.000]  And the producer's mother was getting nasty notes on her car because of that.
[03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:51.000]  Well, that is what the media wants.
[03:49:51.000 --> 03:49:53.000]  That's why they spread these stories.
[03:49:53.000 --> 03:49:57.000]  They spread the stories so that people will not trust one another.
[03:49:57.000 --> 03:50:00.000]  Right? Alex Jones and Trump are effing idiots.
[03:50:00.000 --> 03:50:04.000]  Right? Cursing, foul language.
[03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:06.000]  And I know that this stuff is true.
[03:50:06.000 --> 03:50:09.000]  The left, the left hoaxes a lot of things and makes up a lot of things.
[03:50:09.000 --> 03:50:11.000]  But I know this is true because I've had it happen to me.
[03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:15.000]  I've had, it's so common now that you, you lose track of it.
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:16.000]  You lose track of the craziness.
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:22.000]  Somebody actually told me, I hope somebody treats your daughter, my eight month old daughter,
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:25.000]  with as much as hate as I treat Obama.
[03:50:25.000 --> 03:50:27.000]  But I don't even treat Obama with hate.
[03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:33.000]  But this is a person wishing very nasty things on an infant.
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:35.000]  This is the media side up.
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:40.000]  That is why mindset is so important and understanding what is really going on,
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:45.000]  knowing what the true agenda of the globalist is, knowing if their death cult is so crucial.
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:51.000]  So we'll be back in the next segment to talk more.
[03:50:51.000 --> 03:50:54.000]  Actually, we're going to skip the break because why not?
[03:50:54.000 --> 03:50:59.000]  So yes, once you discover the true agenda, then you know, oh, now I know why they're telling,
[03:50:59.000 --> 03:51:03.000]  always ask yourself, why are they showing me this message?
[03:51:03.000 --> 03:51:04.000]  Right?
[03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:06.000]  That's what you always want to ask yourself.
[03:51:06.000 --> 03:51:09.000]  Why are they showing me this message?
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:12.000]  There's always a hidden agenda behind it.
[03:51:12.000 --> 03:51:16.000]  And then when you ask that question, you know why they don't show you positive messages.
[03:51:16.000 --> 03:51:18.000]  You know, they don't show you uplifting messages.
[03:51:18.000 --> 03:51:21.000]  You know, they don't share stories of prosperity.
[03:51:21.000 --> 03:51:25.000]  The media could show endless, there's so much goodness in America.
[03:51:25.000 --> 03:51:29.000]  There are so many people every day helping each other out.
[03:51:29.000 --> 03:51:32.000]  There are so many people stepping up in a massive way.
[03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:36.000]  People donating to charity, people volunteering, people helping each other out,
[03:51:36.000 --> 03:51:39.000]  people helping other people across the street.
[03:51:39.000 --> 03:51:45.000]  I even noticed post Harvey that because when I travel a lot, I was just in Austin actually yesterday
[03:51:45.000 --> 03:51:50.000]  and I'm back in California and I was in SF a week ago and then I'll be in New York.
[03:51:50.000 --> 03:51:54.000]  And that was in DC, you know, I'm so just traveling all the time.
[03:51:54.000 --> 03:51:59.000]  And I noticed even on airplanes, people are being nicer to each other.
[03:51:59.000 --> 03:52:00.000]  People are helping.
[03:52:00.000 --> 03:52:02.000]  Oh, can I help you lift that bag up?
[03:52:02.000 --> 03:52:04.000]  Oh, you know, I noticed you dropped something.
[03:52:04.000 --> 03:52:09.000]  That's the compassion that we could have for each other every day of our lives.
[03:52:09.000 --> 03:52:15.000]  But when people turn on the media and it's all toxic, it's all garbage, it's all negative,
[03:52:15.000 --> 03:52:18.000]  then that becomes implant plan in your brain.
[03:52:18.000 --> 03:52:24.000]  Salon, for example, pro pedophile website, Salon, by the way, wrote an article making fun of a segment
[03:52:24.000 --> 03:52:30.000]  that Alex Jones and I did two days ago where we talked about how quanta bots will be able to go into your brain
[03:52:30.000 --> 03:52:32.000]  and manipulate how you feel.
[03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:34.000]  And it wasn't even a reputation.
[03:52:34.000 --> 03:52:36.000]  They didn't interview a scientist.
[03:52:36.000 --> 03:52:41.000]  They didn't actually interview anybody who's done research on that and know that, yeah, you actually can
[03:52:41.000 --> 03:52:49.000]  change how people feel by imprinting sensations on different parts of the brain, your frontal lobe.
[03:52:49.000 --> 03:52:50.000]  You can affect people's memory.
[03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:54.000]  That's why if people get punched in the head, it affects your prefrontal cortex.
[03:52:54.000 --> 03:52:55.000]  This has all been proven.
[03:52:55.000 --> 03:52:58.000]  Calcification of brain proven.
[03:52:58.000 --> 03:53:06.000]  The way that a brain has plaque in it in Alzheimer's patients and also in professional football players and boxers.
[03:53:06.000 --> 03:53:10.000]  So it's all been proven brain plaque can affect judgment mood.
[03:53:10.000 --> 03:53:16.000]  So Salon just goes, Alex Jones and Mike Simmich warned of brain eating robots, AI pushing Islam, right?
[03:53:16.000 --> 03:53:19.000]  But they don't actually interview a scientist, right?
[03:53:19.000 --> 03:53:21.000]  All they do is go, here's what they said.
[03:53:21.000 --> 03:53:23.000]  How can you believe it?
[03:53:23.000 --> 03:53:25.000]  But all of that, of course, is true.
[03:53:25.000 --> 03:53:31.000]  And you know that too, because if you watch negative news all the time, you feel negative.
[03:53:31.000 --> 03:53:36.000]  If you talk to negative people, spiritual vampires, then you feel drained.
[03:53:36.000 --> 03:53:43.000]  So if you feel negative, you feel drained merely by letting in the signals of light waves and sound waves.
[03:53:43.000 --> 03:53:50.000]  Imagine what the AI quantum bots are going to be able to do.
[03:53:50.000 --> 03:53:51.000]  I think we're still live.
[03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:52.000]  Okay, we'll just keep rolling.
[03:53:52.000 --> 03:53:53.000]  I can go on forever.
[03:53:53.000 --> 03:53:55.000]  I can go forever about this stuff.
[03:53:55.000 --> 03:54:02.000]  So if you can be programmed, because we are programming each other in real time, we all know this, all right?
[03:54:02.000 --> 03:54:07.000]  We all know that we're being programmed in real time and people are fighting for our attention so that they can program us.
[03:54:07.000 --> 03:54:09.000]  People go, that's crazy.
[03:54:09.000 --> 03:54:11.000]  Well, why make you feel afraid?
[03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:15.000]  If people weren't trying to program you, then why would shame work?
[03:54:15.000 --> 03:54:22.000]  If people weren't trying to program you, then why would they try to make you be embarrassed to share the infowords.com link?
[03:54:22.000 --> 03:54:28.000]  Why would they want to make you embarrassed to use their products like caveman, which I use.
[03:54:28.000 --> 03:54:30.000]  I was using bone broth ever before I heard Alex Jones.
[03:54:30.000 --> 03:54:33.000]  That's what I think about all the criticisms are really funny.
[03:54:33.000 --> 03:54:36.000]  I've been drinking alkaline water for years.
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:38.000]  I don't drink tap water.
[03:54:38.000 --> 03:54:44.000]  And the people that I know, the very successful people that I know, they aren't drinking tap water either.
[03:54:44.000 --> 03:54:46.000]  Everybody's got a water filter.
[03:54:46.000 --> 03:54:50.000]  You go to Malibu, go to Malibu where all those people will make fun of us.
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:51.000]  Go to New York.
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:54:53.000]  Here's a test for you.
[03:54:53.000 --> 03:54:56.000]  Why don't you go into BuzzFeed headquarters and see if they're drinking tap water?
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:54:57.000]  There you go.
[03:54:57.000 --> 03:54:59.000]  I don't know why we didn't think about this earlier.
[03:54:59.000 --> 03:55:00.000]  We should have.
[03:55:00.000 --> 03:55:08.000]  So next time Alex calls Charlie Rizel, he should ask Charlie, hey, Charlie, are they drinking tap water at BuzzFeed?
[03:55:08.000 --> 03:55:09.000]  Right.
[03:55:09.000 --> 03:55:13.000]  So BuzzFeed will say, well, he sells water filters, but they all drink filtered water.
[03:55:13.000 --> 03:55:19.000]  They'll say, oh, they're taking products, but the products are things that I use for years just in a different brand.
[03:55:19.000 --> 03:55:26.000]  I've just switched brands instead of supporting some other big multi conglomerate corporation or instead of buying something from Whole Foods,
[03:55:26.000 --> 03:55:30.000]  which is where I would buy my chicken broth and I buy my chicken broth from Alex.
[03:55:30.000 --> 03:55:32.000]  Alex should actually send it to me for free.
[03:55:32.000 --> 03:55:33.000]  I need to put that on the due list.
[03:55:33.000 --> 03:55:36.000]  Send me a shipment of this, Alex.
[03:55:36.000 --> 03:55:42.000]  So that's the whole idea is we do know inputs are coming in all the time coming in from the television.
[03:55:42.000 --> 03:55:44.000]  We know that music can change how you feel.
[03:55:44.000 --> 03:55:46.000]  That's why I always only listen to uplifting music.
[03:55:46.000 --> 03:55:48.000]  I only listen to house music.
[03:55:48.000 --> 03:55:50.000]  I don't listen to death metal.
[03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:52.000]  A lot of people do and I'm not hating on anybody who does.
[03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:56.000]  A lot of people, it makes them feel more intense than they have a good workout.
[03:55:56.000 --> 03:56:01.000]  So again, I'm not saying that what you listen to is bad, but I'm only talking about my own chemistry.
[03:56:01.000 --> 03:56:08.000]  So me, I don't listen to any music that is bad because I know that that's programming my brain.
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:20.000]  So the idea that you should laugh at quantum bots, and there are quantum bots, by the way, the producers, I'm sure, can find out that they're actually doing research into quantum bots to treat cancer.
[03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:31.000]  So the idea is that you'll put a quantum bot into a capsule and a personal swallow capsule and then the quantum bottle go out and it's only programmed to attack and kill cancer cells.
[03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:34.000]  It shoots cancer cells like lasers, right?
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:42.000]  So if we have robots that can go in and shoot laser beams, such as they are, that's a metaphor for the fake news people watching.
[03:56:42.000 --> 03:56:46.000]  Oh, Cernivish claims that people are ingesting laser beams.
[03:56:46.000 --> 03:57:01.000]  So if we know that we can send in quantum bots to treat cancer and to attack tumorous tissue only, because that's the problem of treating cancer is you have to attack your entire immune system to try to shut down the cancer and to kill the cancer.
[03:57:01.000 --> 03:57:10.000]  So if you can send in a quantum bot to only target cancer, why couldn't you create a quantum bot to only target your hippocampus?
[03:57:10.000 --> 03:57:14.000]  Why couldn't you create a quantum bot to target prefrontal cortex?
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:17.000]  Why couldn't you, because first we'll do it for good.
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:24.000]  Imagine if you could take a person who played for the NFL and suffer thousands of microconcussions like Junior Seau.
[03:57:24.000 --> 03:57:29.000]  Remember, they killed themselves by shooting themselves in the chest because they want their brain preserved.
[03:57:29.000 --> 03:57:35.000]  So imagine if you could somehow get a quantum bot to eliminate the plaque.
[03:57:35.000 --> 03:57:38.000]  It's actually literally plaque in the brain to eliminate plaque in the brain.
[03:57:38.000 --> 03:57:44.000]  Well, then you would have a young, youthful, supple brain. Your memory would be the same as it was. People who have depression would be treated.
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:46.000]  So they're actually researching this.
[03:57:46.000 --> 03:57:52.000]  That's why when pro-pedophile websites like Salon make fun of, they aren't Saddam.
[03:57:52.000 --> 03:57:55.000]  Saddam is saying that's the level of evil threat.
[03:57:55.000 --> 03:57:59.000]  That's why when they make fun of us, I know that they're actually not reading MIT Technology Review.
[03:57:59.000 --> 03:58:01.000]  They're not reading scientific journals.
[03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:04.000]  They're not talking to great philosophers of consciousness.
[03:58:04.000 --> 03:58:09.000]  They're not reading and exploring and trying to find the big questions.
[03:58:09.000 --> 03:58:11.000]  Only Infowars is.
[03:58:11.000 --> 03:58:13.000]  And that's why we appreciate your support.
