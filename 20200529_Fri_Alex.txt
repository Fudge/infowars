[00:00.000 --> 00:26.760]  We don't have time to go back and pull up all the clips in the last few months where
[00:26.760 --> 00:34.200]  I said, as the COVID-19 hoax, at least phase one, begins to dissipate, what are the globalists
[00:34.200 --> 00:41.280]  going to launch? And I said they're going to launch war between China, Taiwan and Hong
[00:41.280 --> 00:47.520]  Kong. And they're going to intensify economic warfare and try to trigger race riots in America.
[00:47.520 --> 00:54.160]  Now we're on record documenting this. And here's an article that I've promoted probably 500 times
[00:54.160 --> 01:00.120]  on air since 2018. Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore,
[01:00.120 --> 01:06.120]  Maryland. Leak documents show the tell plan to trigger nationwide unrest, allowing Obama to
[01:06.120 --> 01:11.320]  declare martial law. One month after we got these documents, it was confirmed by federal
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.760]  law enforcement. They were accurate. The media never disputed them. Trends of democracy run by
[01:15.760 --> 01:26.240]  Alexander Soros trying to trigger with antifa operatives, black Americans rioting as the cover
[01:26.240 --> 01:32.960]  to overthrow major city governments. So Obama would have a pretext to declare national martial
[01:32.960 --> 01:40.840]  law ahead of the election. It did not go the way they wanted to. And later it came out that the
[01:40.840 --> 01:45.640]  Justice Department would cherry pick cases of questionable police shootings or questionable
[01:45.640 --> 01:50.600]  police action. Some cases, the police were wrong. Other cases, they weren't wrong. I'm not here
[01:50.600 --> 01:55.560]  lionizing the police. It's a tough job. There's some good people. There's some bad people. But
[01:55.560 --> 02:02.000]  the local police are not our enemy. Anybody that's lived long enough on average knows that.
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.920]  But cops don't put up with bad cops very long. And what happened in Minnesota that the media
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.880]  has hyped up now is becoming more and more suspicious. Turns out these two knew each other
[02:13.880 --> 02:23.480]  very well, worked as bouncers at a club together for several years. And anybody with half a brain
[02:23.480 --> 02:27.320]  knows you put your knee on the carotid artery of somebody. That's not a police trained tactic.
[02:27.320 --> 02:32.680]  I'd say it kills somebody. And I've got a friend who's been a police officer. He's been in the
[02:32.680 --> 02:38.760]  Army and the Marines and Blackwater and State Department and everything else, three letter
[02:38.760 --> 02:42.520]  agencies. And he never wants to go on air. And he said last night, he said, I want to come on the
[02:42.520 --> 02:50.760]  show. And now he's got the 911 call that no one's covering because it really exposes some
[02:50.760 --> 02:58.760]  bizarreness. And to me, this looks like some type of inner gang operation. And you're probably
[02:58.760 --> 03:03.000]  going to find there's corruption going on. And this is some kind of weird police gang hooked into
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.600]  organized crime. So because I mean, why would you kill somebody on camera? I mean, why would you just
[03:12.040 --> 03:15.400]  go to report to somebody passing fake 20s and then kill them on camera?
[03:17.560 --> 03:23.400]  And so all the feds and you know, and I've talked to their smart people or patriots,
[03:23.400 --> 03:31.000]  they say, no, this looks really bad. And you're not going to hire a cop to kill someone on camera
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.720]  to trigger martial law. No. But there's going to be criminal events going on. You're going to have
[03:35.720 --> 03:41.240]  dirty cops. You're going to have weird stuff going on. And that's what this looks like is gangland
[03:41.240 --> 03:48.920]  execution. Because nobody's trained to put their knee on somebody's crowded artery. That's how you
[03:48.920 --> 03:55.480]  kill somebody. So why would a cop on camera kill somebody? Well, he's crazy. You know, why would
[03:55.480 --> 03:59.560]  that black dude beat up old white men and all this stuff? I mean, I don't blame all black people
[03:59.560 --> 04:03.000]  because there's some crazy black people out there. I don't blame all white people because
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.200]  some crazy white people. And when the media says this inherently is the fault of all police
[04:08.920 --> 04:13.480]  and police in Austin that I know are being threatened and they're having letters put on
[04:13.480 --> 04:19.000]  their cars threatening them saying you're all guilty for what this dude did. That's sick. You know,
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.640]  if my father had committed crimes, which he did, but hypothetically, am I to blame for the sins
[04:23.640 --> 04:30.360]  of the father? Or one of my great grandfather was a bank robber. Would I be guilty for that?
[04:30.360 --> 04:35.160]  And you like absolutely not. So if a white cop does something wrong 1000 miles away from me,
[04:35.880 --> 04:39.720]  whether I'm a white guy or a cop or whatever I am, how am I to blame for that? The answer is I'm
[04:39.720 --> 04:43.960]  not. It's a fundamental assault on reality. We're going to talk about it all coming up.
[04:44.920 --> 04:48.360]  But this is the globalist surprise. This is what they're going to this is the next thing is going
[04:48.360 --> 04:53.160]  to be race for. They've been priming the pump for it. And that's what it's all about. We're going
[04:53.160 --> 05:01.080]  to lay out all the facts straight ahead. I'm always excited about info wars life products.
[05:01.080 --> 05:04.840]  They're amazing. They're cutting edge. You love them. I love them. And they find the info war in
[05:04.840 --> 05:11.080]  the face of the globalist onslaught. But we have come up with a new product over a year in development
[05:12.200 --> 05:20.600]  that is amazing. The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top
[05:20.600 --> 05:28.280]  of it. And there's another innovation. It's the spray cap. It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick,
[05:28.280 --> 05:35.000]  gross goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way. I like to put it on my hands,
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.400]  rub a little bit on my face. It's got organic alcohol in it. So spray it around your eyes.
[05:39.400 --> 05:45.640]  But I just love it personally as something that's a moisturizer as well. So this is a real innovation.
[05:45.640 --> 05:49.800]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[05:49.800 --> 05:59.800]  essential oil in it. So it doesn't dry you out. It smells great. It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[06:20.600 --> 06:38.440]  It's real bogus. They got to get it right. I mean, otherwise this was going to happen.
[06:38.440 --> 06:42.280]  It ain't nothing left here. So when we start coming to the suburbs, when we come to the
[06:42.280 --> 06:46.280]  government center, then what's all I'm going to do? You see what I'm saying? So hey, that's
[06:46.280 --> 06:51.320]  just what's going to happen, you know? Today we found Corboy Bala who invested his life savings
[06:51.320 --> 06:56.760]  into opening this sports bar, cleaning up. While our camera was there, looters came back
[06:56.760 --> 07:05.240]  to try to steal his safe. I don't know what we're going to do. It looks so hard to get here. So hard.
[07:07.320 --> 07:13.480]  I want to be clear on how I characterize this. This is mostly a protest. It is not
[07:13.480 --> 07:19.400]  it is not generally speaking unruly, but fires have been started and and there's a crowd that
[07:22.920 --> 07:27.320]  and then here you go folks. You get the fireworks going off in celebration of the police station
[07:27.320 --> 07:27.960]  burning down.
[07:30.920 --> 07:34.840]  And then the businesses and the community will just move out of that area and you've got another
[07:34.840 --> 07:40.120]  dead zone. Another group of people that can't get a job and have feeling welfare and the
[07:40.120 --> 07:44.200]  deep state wins. You're down domesticated. You're now controlled. That is the total plan.
[07:46.040 --> 07:51.400]  So there are a lot of facets to this. We're going to go over them all today, but remember that while
[07:51.400 --> 07:58.760]  we're all focused on Los Angeles and Minneapolis, St. Paul, having riots and and and murders and
[07:58.760 --> 08:02.840]  attacks and massive racial attacks on white people. Nobody's covering that.
[08:02.840 --> 08:11.240]  While all that's going on, video has come out of Joe Biden in China saying we need China to take
[08:11.240 --> 08:19.320]  over the United States. That's coming up. Now, folks, when he went and said that in 2012,
[08:20.920 --> 08:25.480]  you're like, that's that's wild. Listen, if you were reading the Council on Foreign Relations,
[08:26.120 --> 08:30.600]  Foreign Affairs or any big globalist publication, they said it's the Chinese century. America's
[08:30.600 --> 08:35.960]  done. China will teach us their virtuous. They're going to come here and run things. It's very
[08:37.160 --> 08:44.760]  China centric. You've heard the term Anglophile means you worship all things English or Arusa
[08:44.760 --> 08:49.960]  file means you love the Russians or a pedophile. You like kids.
[08:52.360 --> 08:57.800]  You're a arachnophobic. You don't like spiders. So you got files and you've got phobics.
[08:57.800 --> 09:04.280]  Well, the Rothschilds have had everything on China. So the Rockefellers, they all brag about it.
[09:04.280 --> 09:09.240]  There's their publication. Rothschilds openly on the economist. I mean, you want to get your
[09:09.240 --> 09:16.680]  marching orders. That's why Joe Biden and Bill Gates and all of them say I read the economist
[09:16.680 --> 09:21.160]  cover to cover every month. And that's my Bible. That's the Rothschilds telling them
[09:21.160 --> 09:35.400]  them how to wipe their ass. And so I'm sitting here 27 years ago doing research about to get on
[09:35.400 --> 09:38.040]  air and I'm reading Council on Foreign Relations documents.
[09:43.160 --> 09:47.960]  And it's we're going to end America. We're going to leverage it out with China. One side of deals.
[09:47.960 --> 09:52.600]  America is a joke. And I've been warned in the public that long. And now it's all here.
[09:54.040 --> 09:58.120]  Cudlows come out the White House chief economic advisor said, no, we're at war with China.
[09:58.120 --> 10:03.000]  We're very angry. They're criminal. China is in the news threatening to invade Taiwan now,
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.960]  not just Hong Kong militarily. China threatens to attack Taiwan. That's the headline in Reuters,
[10:09.960 --> 10:18.280]  headline Daily Mail. I mean, so while we're busy watching people loot auto zone and target,
[10:19.880 --> 10:23.880]  and then mainly black businesses, because these are black neighborhoods, and it's mainly black
[10:23.880 --> 10:27.880]  neighborhoods, these people are like, I own this liquor store, I own this gas station, I own this
[10:27.880 --> 10:34.200]  grocery store. Why'd you burn my store? Oh, well, a white cop did something wrong. So I'm going to
[10:34.200 --> 10:39.880]  burn down this apartment building that an old black lady owned that her family had worked for
[10:39.880 --> 10:46.920]  decades to pay for. And then they burned down the police station. Turned out half the cops I saw
[10:46.920 --> 10:51.400]  in the news that worked at that precinct were black. Doesn't matter. They're there. It's burned out.
[10:51.400 --> 10:59.080]  It's stupid. It'd be like if again, God forbid, somebody did something to one of my daughters.
[11:00.440 --> 11:03.800]  And let's say the guy was white, did something to my daughter, and I just wouldn't found a random
[11:03.800 --> 11:07.800]  white guy and hit him in the head with a hammer. You'd be like, you're an idiot. That's not the
[11:07.800 --> 11:13.400]  guy that did something to your daughter. I'd go find the guy that did it. You know, that's not
[11:13.400 --> 11:17.160]  justice. We need justice to quote play out. But if say justice didn't play out, the cop didn't get
[11:17.160 --> 11:20.680]  in trouble. If somebody went to the cop's house and you know, something happened, I wouldn't
[11:20.680 --> 11:24.600]  really agree with it, but I'd say, Hey, at least you targeted who you thought was bad.
[11:29.080 --> 11:34.040]  Here's an analogy. Hitler was a white guy and he went and killed a bunch of Jews and other people.
[11:34.040 --> 11:41.160]  And then at the end of World War Two, imagine if Jews that had run to the US went and say, went to
[11:41.160 --> 11:45.640]  some army vet's house that had fought Hitler and lost a leg and shot the dude in the head. Well,
[11:45.640 --> 11:52.040]  you've got a German last name. Your last name's Gruber. Well, there was a Nazi jail guard had
[11:52.040 --> 11:55.960]  the name Gruber. You probably aren't even related to him, but I'm going to shoot you in the head
[11:55.960 --> 12:00.920]  because you're an American German and Hitler did something wrong to you. No Jew would do that.
[12:00.920 --> 12:10.360]  I mean, no sane person. But see, that's this craziness where a white cop, I could show you videos
[12:10.360 --> 12:15.400]  from World Star Hip Hop all day that are celebrating attacks on white people. It's disgusting.
[12:15.400 --> 12:21.000]  It's sick. It's evil. There's there's like hundreds of these a day because there's 350
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.920]  million people in this country. And I could sit there and show you horrible stuff happening to
[12:26.920 --> 12:32.360]  white people. And I don't do it very often unless it's illustrative because I'm not trying to create
[12:32.360 --> 12:37.960]  right. I could show you a white lady getting attacked and stuff thrown her face and hit with a
[12:37.960 --> 12:45.720]  bunch of stuff and all the rest of it. But what's the point? Oh my gosh, we've got a old white lady
[12:45.720 --> 12:49.400]  in a wheelchair. Let's attack her because she's white. Let's spray a
[12:51.800 --> 12:56.120]  fire extinguisher in her face. When I walk in the store today, there's a black person in there. Do
[12:56.120 --> 13:00.760]  I go a black person attacked a white lady? I saw it video. I'm going to I'm going to hit this black
[13:00.760 --> 13:08.760]  person in the face. I would be the biggest idiot on the planet to do that. But you see, here's the
[13:08.760 --> 13:15.960]  documents, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to cover these here today. No one has covered this
[13:16.840 --> 13:22.280]  in the two years since we broke it. Secret documents confirmed family member got these out
[13:22.280 --> 13:25.960]  of their family member's house. They were a commander in Antifa working directly for Alexander
[13:25.960 --> 13:30.520]  Soros, trying to get blacks to riot so Obama could cancel the election.
[13:36.120 --> 13:41.160]  Soros backplanned to incite civil unrest, the Baltimore area. Well, finally Candace Owens has
[13:41.160 --> 13:45.960]  come out and said these groups are paid to do this by white activists, communists, and that's
[13:45.960 --> 13:55.080]  exactly what this is. And so this is the next phase. And with two less than 200 days, 157 days left,
[13:59.080 --> 14:03.560]  you know, the globalists are going to throw everything they've got now against the wall
[14:04.280 --> 14:05.480]  to see what is going to stick.
[14:09.080 --> 14:15.000]  Now, we've got the China sellout and China expanding major wars. We've got Trump going
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.200]  after the internet censorship. And what that really means finally. Thank God. And we've got
[14:21.560 --> 14:26.360]  the mail-in voting to steal the election. And we've got so much to cover. And then
[14:27.480 --> 14:33.400]  in studio, David Knight was on fire this morning with all these Supreme Court rulings that what
[14:33.400 --> 14:37.640]  big tech's doing is illegal and wrong. And so the idea that what Trump is doing is toothless,
[14:37.640 --> 14:41.640]  is a lie. He's going to be in studio. Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer is going to be in
[14:41.640 --> 14:47.560]  studio. Tim Inlow, who's a good friend of mine, also does security work for us. He's going to be
[14:47.560 --> 14:55.880]  in studio talking about his experience as local police, federal police, army, Marine Corps, Black
[14:55.880 --> 15:00.920]  Water State Department, all of it. What he sees going on here. And with what happened with the
[15:00.920 --> 15:07.720]  case of this poor man that was killed, but how suspicious some of the different angles of the
[15:07.720 --> 15:13.800]  George Floyd death are, because none of it, none of it, none of it added up. People were like,
[15:13.800 --> 15:17.240]  they must have known each other. It must have been an inside deal. And now it turns out they
[15:17.240 --> 15:21.960]  worked as security together at a nightclub. And you know what goes on at nightclubs and what a
[15:21.960 --> 15:28.760]  lot of the security does. A lot of security at nightclubs traffic in narcotics. And that's who
[15:28.760 --> 15:34.360]  the dealers are, is who the security is. And I'm not saying, I'm not saying that George Floyd or
[15:34.360 --> 15:41.640]  this copper is that. I'm just saying the chances of this starts to really get down to some questions
[15:41.640 --> 15:49.720]  we've got. All right, big transmission lined up on Friday. I'm Alex Jones with newswars.com
[15:50.360 --> 15:56.120]  and band.video. You share those links. We win. You don't. We're dead. No water.
[15:58.680 --> 16:03.720]  We're living in insanely dangerous times. And I told folks going back three months ago,
[16:03.720 --> 16:07.720]  I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus. I'm worried about the
[16:07.720 --> 16:12.760]  food shortages and the economic collapse. And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun
[16:12.760 --> 16:17.000]  that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.160]  States. And it's even worse in the third world. So I hope Trump with his initiatives can clean this
[16:21.160 --> 16:26.360]  up and fix it. But with the election fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world
[16:26.360 --> 16:31.240]  collapsing and everything else is going on. Now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll
[16:31.240 --> 16:35.960]  last for 25 years. They're an easily totable bags. It's high quality food. And it's good to
[16:35.960 --> 16:39.800]  have that box checked off to be ready. And it funds the info war. So we have storeable food

[17:59.720 --> 18:06.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:06.200 --> 18:23.960]  Welcome back. I'm your host Alex Jones and I'm really happy that the Gateway Pundit is smart
[18:23.960 --> 18:29.000]  and they get it. They have a new article that just went live. Friendly reminder of Soros funded
[18:29.000 --> 18:37.160]  violent Ferguson protest movement and paid Black Lives Matter protesters. And again, out of 350
[18:37.160 --> 18:41.000]  million people in this country, you got black folks doing bad things. You got white people
[18:41.000 --> 18:47.720]  doing bad things. You got brown people doing bad things. But to say that if one black person does
[18:47.720 --> 18:52.200]  something wrong or one white person does something wrong, we focus in, we say, well, because a white
[18:52.200 --> 18:57.320]  cop looks like he did something really bad. He's been fired. He's going to get charged.
[18:57.320 --> 19:02.040]  It turns out they work together as bouncers at a nightclub for a couple years.
[19:03.560 --> 19:08.520]  Before you burn down the city and the black businesses, how about you have a little bit
[19:08.520 --> 19:14.200]  of a discussion? Because, you know, before I'm going to go burn something out or kill somebody,
[19:15.000 --> 19:21.240]  I'm going to get my ducks in a row. But if I knew somebody did something to my family and they got
[19:21.240 --> 19:27.480]  away with it in court, well, as you say, I'm not going to be going around burning buildings down
[19:27.480 --> 19:33.480]  to random businesses. I'm going to go find a person that did it and I'm going to take out justice
[19:34.280 --> 19:39.480]  because I can't sleep at night if I don't. But I'm sure as hell, again, not going to run around
[19:39.480 --> 19:45.560]  burning stuff down, but the media hypes it and the media says it's okay. CNN, MSNBC are up there
[19:45.560 --> 19:52.280]  going. They're angry. They deserve it. They're mad. They've beat up a bunch of white people.
[19:52.920 --> 19:55.800]  And who do you think's in those poor neighborhoods? It's a bunch of disabled,
[19:56.600 --> 20:02.680]  homeless white people, people in wheelchairs. You're a black teenager and you saw a black guy
[20:02.680 --> 20:07.480]  killed on TV and I get it. I don't like watching the footage of anybody dying like that. It tears
[20:07.480 --> 20:11.160]  your heart strings. Somebody's begging for their life. What happened to George Floyd looks terrible
[20:11.160 --> 20:19.240]  and I think is wrong. But now you burn down your own neighborhoods. Oh, the answer is don't worry,
[20:19.240 --> 20:24.280]  we're coming to your suburbs. Well, who lives in those people of every color? This is so racist
[20:24.280 --> 20:30.760]  and it's the media and the leftist mayor playing along with it. Like, oh yeah, this is because
[20:30.760 --> 20:37.000]  of 400 years of slavery. Really, who sold us the slaves? And whites had slaves back then that were
[20:37.000 --> 20:42.200]  white. I mean, I can go back in my family tree and find out something like that and go, well,
[20:42.200 --> 20:47.480]  you know, because somebody enslaved me 300 years ago, I can do whatever I want. What does that even
[20:47.480 --> 20:53.800]  mean? What does that even have to imagine if I work with somebody and I go, let me check your
[20:53.800 --> 20:56.920]  genealogy to see if your ancestors are doing anything wrong because I'm going to hold you
[20:56.920 --> 21:06.520]  accountable. You look at somebody like they were crazy. Truth is, everybody wants to get into
[21:06.520 --> 21:11.880]  white countries because white countries went through a renaissance and became Christian
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.280]  and said we want to treat people good. And so compared to other places, we've been really good.
[21:19.640 --> 21:23.880]  And that's why the globalists want to overthrow the European ethos of Christianity,
[21:23.880 --> 21:27.720]  because if you can get rid of that, people won't stand up for each other. And it's the law of the
[21:27.720 --> 21:34.040]  jungle. And it's not about race, it's about the spirit of the people. And that spirit's being
[21:34.040 --> 21:38.840]  overturned. So there's a bunch of these videos, but let's go through some of them. Here it is.
[21:39.960 --> 21:44.440]  Rioter, we're going to start coming to the suburbs. Well, let me just tell you something, my friend.
[21:47.880 --> 21:50.760]  If you come to my house, you think you're going to burn my house down.
[21:52.120 --> 21:55.080]  It's not going to happen. That's what Trump tweeted yesterday. He said, listen,
[21:55.080 --> 21:59.720]  the riots need to stop pretty soon. We're going to have to shoot rioters. That's what you do.
[21:59.720 --> 22:04.280]  We're trying to burn things down. That's a weapon. Twitter banned Trump for that. Block that.
[22:06.120 --> 22:09.880]  So here's that clip. Here it is. It's real bogus. They got to get it right. I mean,
[22:09.880 --> 22:14.680]  otherwise this was going to happen. Ain't nothing left here. So when we start coming to the suburbs,
[22:14.680 --> 22:18.520]  when we come to the government center, then what's all I'm going to do? You see what I'm saying?
[22:18.520 --> 22:23.160]  So, hey, that's just what's going to happen, you know? So in the black community, which is the
[22:23.160 --> 22:27.960]  target of the globalist operation, and I'm not defending segregation, it was another evil. This
[22:27.960 --> 22:36.440]  was an even greater evil. You had less unemployment and less illegitimacy in the black community in
[22:36.440 --> 22:43.400]  the 1940s than in the white community. And now you've got almost 80% single parent homes in the
[22:43.400 --> 22:48.840]  black community. You got about half the people in the black community on welfare. Well, after you
[22:48.840 --> 22:55.160]  burn down all the black stores, who's going to have jobs now? So see, he's saying, oh, well,
[22:55.160 --> 23:01.960]  we'll come to your neighborhood and burn it down and burn it down and burn it down. Who wants that?
[23:01.960 --> 23:08.440]  The globalist, the chai comms, the new world order. China is financing all this Hollywood stuff
[23:09.080 --> 23:14.120]  about race war and the rest of it. China is the most racist country other than probably
[23:14.120 --> 23:22.040]  North Korea on the planet. China doesn't let one Muslim into their country. China literally
[23:22.040 --> 23:29.800]  looks down on black people. Xi Jinping admires Hitler on record and believes black people
[23:29.800 --> 23:35.320]  aren't human. Think about that. I mean, have you looked at the Chinese folks? I mean, man,
[23:35.320 --> 23:41.640]  they look just alike for a reason. So you sit there in the belly of freedom and the belly
[23:41.640 --> 23:45.640]  of Christianity. We got our own problems, but we climbed up the mountain towards God a lot.
[23:45.640 --> 23:50.840]  You know, we're still not there, but we're trying to be good. And you sit there and use the goodness
[23:50.840 --> 23:57.480]  and say that this is the crap hole and that we're the people that hate it. BS. We had a civil war
[23:57.480 --> 24:04.120]  that millions of people died into in slavery. Nobody else does that. The British government
[24:04.120 --> 24:09.160]  under Christian control had over 20 years of war against dozens of countries that will
[24:09.160 --> 24:19.960]  they would attack you if you had slaves? The United States and England ended slavery. Christians
[24:19.960 --> 24:27.240]  ended slavery in the West. And it's still practiced all over the world by the brown people that we're
[24:27.240 --> 24:35.880]  told are superior to white people. That's more racist crap. And that Nazi collaborator, George
[24:35.880 --> 24:42.200]  Soros is funding every damn bit of it and laughing his way with his little degenerate demon son all
[24:42.200 --> 24:47.800]  the way to the bank. So I'm glad people are finally getting this because you talk about an FBI indictment.
[24:48.440 --> 24:53.560]  I mean, if I was running around funding billions of dollars to burn stuff down and kill people,
[24:53.560 --> 24:58.440]  and I mean, I would expect to be SWAT team. I should. They've got all these TV shows around
[24:58.440 --> 25:02.200]  this mastermind running all this stuff. It's all a projection of what they're doing.
[25:02.200 --> 25:07.960]  I came to get my email to work properly. I'm just up on air talking about the truth. Oh,
[25:07.960 --> 25:13.080]  but I'm a mastermind. I secretly run everything. But these guys, they do actually run it.
[25:14.920 --> 25:18.200]  Here's another clip. Black business owner
[25:19.560 --> 25:23.000]  invests his life savings and they destroyed his restaurant bar. Here it is.
[25:23.640 --> 25:29.240]  Today we found Corboy Bala who invested his life savings into opening this sports bar cleaning up
[25:29.240 --> 25:33.880]  while our camera was there. Looters came back to try to steal his safe.
[25:42.840 --> 25:48.920]  By the way, if I've got a business in a safe, if you're white, if you're brown,
[25:48.920 --> 25:52.200]  if you're black, you're in my business trying to steal my stuff. I'm going to kill you.
[25:53.320 --> 25:57.480]  But everybody, because the mayor and the police evacuating, the mayor's like,
[25:57.480 --> 26:01.720]  it's the white people. He's a white guy, of course. He's a commie. We deserve it. We're bad.
[26:03.400 --> 26:06.520]  So that now you go in your business, people are looting it
[26:07.640 --> 26:15.160]  in front of you and you're too scared to even beat their ass. That's called submission.
[26:16.040 --> 26:19.400]  That's called broke back. That's you just, you're crying. I'm not against this guy
[26:19.400 --> 26:23.080]  because I get it. I mean, maybe I do the same thing like, nope, they're just going to arrest me
[26:23.080 --> 26:29.080]  if I shoot people in my business. Okay, damn, take it all. Maybe, maybe that guy's right.
[26:29.080 --> 26:35.000]  But I mean, when you run up a flag like that and just say, oh, just burn down my business,
[26:35.000 --> 26:39.320]  just take everything. We got a black guy got killed. So we're going to,
[26:39.960 --> 26:43.240]  we're going to take your business away. What the hell does that even mean?
[26:44.520 --> 26:50.120]  But the media says it's good. You see, they're the ones, they're the ones legitimizing this.
[26:50.120 --> 26:54.440]  These are sick people. Remember the Los Angeles riots? The media said it was good to shoot at
[26:54.440 --> 26:59.640]  firefighters. Now it's official. The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID
[26:59.640 --> 27:05.880]  emergency will last five years. And the UK government said you must all carry cell phones
[27:05.880 --> 27:10.680]  outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only
[27:10.680 --> 27:15.880]  allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit. And if you go outside that list of 10,
[27:15.880 --> 27:21.720]  you'll be permanently detained. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order where
[27:21.720 --> 27:27.320]  they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you
[27:27.320 --> 27:32.280]  are now non essential and a prisoner. From the beginning of my research, it was clear
[27:32.280 --> 27:37.720]  the globalist are an authoritarian anti human group. They have to put this electronic straight
[27:37.720 --> 27:43.480]  jacket on us before they carry out their in game, which is global depopulation. So you see,
[27:43.480 --> 27:50.520]  submitting to them is death. The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts,
[27:50.520 --> 28:20.360]  and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy. Wake up or die.
[28:20.520 --> 28:25.480]  And just this past Memorial Day, I took two of them fell asleep about 1am, woke up at 8am,

[29:58.280 --> 30:00.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:00.920 --> 30:14.520]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:16.040 --> 30:19.000]  All right, let me do this right now. Then I'm going to get into all the big brain news and what's
[30:19.000 --> 30:25.560]  unfolding. This is the media and the establishment of what's happening in Minnesota that's now
[30:25.560 --> 30:32.200]  expanding nationwide. A microcosm about the establishment controls people. And we have the
[30:32.200 --> 30:36.760]  documents. We have the admissions. We have the internal reports. This is how they do it. And
[30:36.760 --> 30:42.280]  it's a criminal conspiracy. And it's the perception that justice isn't being carried out.
[30:43.320 --> 30:48.440]  Now, as I've said, the COVID-19, the Russia gate, the Ukraine gate, China trying to start a war
[30:48.440 --> 30:54.840]  with Hong Kong and Taiwan. This is modern warfare where you don't do it upfront with
[30:54.840 --> 31:00.200]  tanks and planes and battleships and aircraft carriers. You do it through propaganda and internal
[31:00.200 --> 31:07.080]  manipulation. And so that's why I've told everybody COVID-19 itself is hyped up, but the
[31:07.080 --> 31:13.400]  collapse is real. And the economic degradation that's going to happen in every community now
[31:13.400 --> 31:18.760]  and the mass starvation in the third world is going to put huge migrant wave pressure on the
[31:18.760 --> 31:25.880]  West. Now it's happening. And it's going to cause major, major civil unrest and crime to increase.
[31:27.160 --> 31:31.320]  And that's now happening as well. So the breakdown of society purposefully,
[31:32.200 --> 31:36.840]  so that we collapse and so we can be remade, the new order image is now happening. So
[31:38.600 --> 31:43.880]  I'm here to tell you with 157 days out of the election, I believe we can win. I believe we
[31:43.880 --> 31:47.560]  can defeat the globalist. I believe the president comes out against China and admits we're at war
[31:47.560 --> 31:52.200]  with China economically and culturally and through intelligence agencies and through
[31:52.200 --> 31:57.240]  collaborator traders. If the president calls out the globalist minions as Chai Kong operatives,
[31:57.240 --> 32:01.640]  which is now happening, if the president takes the gloves off and says it's a bait and switch,
[32:01.640 --> 32:08.360]  section 230, that the big internet companies are violating our rights and involved in election
[32:08.360 --> 32:17.480]  meddling, if he does all of that very boldly, we have a good chance of winning. But if he doesn't,
[32:17.480 --> 32:21.880]  if he falters, if he waivers, if we waiver, things are going to really go downhill very,
[32:21.880 --> 32:31.960]  very quickly. So we are on a razor's edge. And that's why I feel absolutely 100% moral and strong
[32:31.960 --> 32:37.080]  and proud and good to promote high quality, horrible foods, because it's something with
[32:37.080 --> 32:40.360]  inflation that you're going to get your money back on. It's something that hopefully things don't
[32:40.360 --> 32:45.080]  go bad. You can eat your insurance. It's one of the few sure bets there is high quality,
[32:45.800 --> 32:51.400]  portable, well, excellently packaged, horrible food that we actually have in stock ready to get
[32:51.400 --> 32:57.560]  out to you and your family at infowarstore.com, the full catalog of ready hour, my Patriots
[32:57.560 --> 33:01.400]  supply, they're full spectrum, the best deal you're going to find, you go right into the queue,
[33:01.400 --> 33:05.400]  they run our computer system, we've been partners with them for many years. And so as the order
[33:05.400 --> 33:10.120]  comes in, you're ordering it from him. And then part of the money that comes in funds this operation,
[33:10.120 --> 33:14.760]  which again is a total win. Where can you check off one of the preparedness boxes,
[33:14.760 --> 33:18.200]  know you've done a good job, know you've got quality, and then know you're funding something
[33:18.200 --> 33:23.400]  that also stands up for your speech or second amendment to the right to life for our sovereignty,
[33:23.400 --> 33:27.160]  and that just does it back now in the face of anything. And that's not with me, that's not
[33:27.160 --> 33:34.040]  courage. I've tried to explain this, it's total fight, because I am so concerned and so upset
[33:34.040 --> 33:38.760]  by these people, I don't know how to run, I just know how to attack. And so all the desperateness
[33:38.760 --> 33:42.920]  and all the energy and all the scrabbling and they're like, well, where the hell's it? This is me,
[33:44.920 --> 33:52.280]  it's not scared because that's running, it's the opposite, it's attacking. I just cannot even begin
[33:52.280 --> 33:57.960]  to imagine turning and running and waiting in some hole for them to come dig me out. I'm not
[33:57.960 --> 34:02.920]  doing it, but the only way this dog is in the fight is your funding and your word of mouth and your
[34:02.920 --> 34:08.680]  prayer. Those things are the trifecta, the prayer, the word of mouth and the funding. The funding
[34:08.680 --> 34:14.840]  actually is important, but compared to prayer and compared to then your action in the universe,
[34:14.840 --> 34:22.520]  taking action with your voice, like lightning from Zeus, prayer and then your action and then
[34:22.520 --> 34:28.760]  your financial support. And I pay a financial support is way below it. You'd think it was the
[34:28.760 --> 34:33.480]  most critical. Without the prayer, there is no action, there is no support, but it all just comes
[34:33.480 --> 34:41.480]  down like lightning. And look, I know I'm right about all this. I've read all their white papers,
[34:41.480 --> 34:47.240]  I've shown them to you. Believe me, it's made me crazy. I know you're going crazy because we're
[34:47.240 --> 34:53.800]  not, we're like, why do, why create race war? Why kill all the babies? Why worship Satan? Because
[34:53.800 --> 35:01.720]  you ain't in love with the devil. So think you're lucky stars. You're not because you may have a
[35:01.720 --> 35:05.400]  lot of problems and Lord knows I got a lot of problems, but man, at the end of the day, the
[35:05.400 --> 35:10.040]  north stars Jesus Christ and we're like, Lord, we know we're not perfect. We love you. We want
[35:10.040 --> 35:15.400]  your help. Get us out of this. These damn people hate Jesus. They think they're going to get out
[35:15.400 --> 35:25.480]  of this with Satan and control. Can you imagine that? Can you do the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds
[35:25.480 --> 35:29.880]  who've been given trillions of dollars, but all their kids are mentally ill and insane.
[35:29.880 --> 35:35.000]  They're the most unhappy, crazy people. Almost all of them have to have butlers in the bedrooms
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.440]  with them at night, holding their hands. They're so scared of the demonic attacks.
[35:39.480 --> 35:43.000]  Let me tell you, I already ran into some of these people and I already knew some of them.
[35:43.000 --> 35:47.960]  I got a guy I've been working with for eight years that grew up in Pennsylvania that was
[35:47.960 --> 35:51.320]  really good friends and he actually later showed me with the DuPonts.
[35:52.520 --> 35:56.680]  And I didn't need to know what they were into, but it was the same. It was the same. I mean,
[35:56.680 --> 36:06.280]  devil worship, you name it, pedophilia, you name it. I mean, folks, it's default position
[36:06.280 --> 36:17.000]  is death. And so I said I'd cover news. I didn't really this segment. I'm just going to finish
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.920]  with this. People say, man, you're a marketing machine. Well, if I didn't sit here and promote
[36:22.920 --> 36:26.680]  products that are already great, we wouldn't be on air. You know how much money it took to beat
[36:26.680 --> 36:31.800]  50 something lawsuits by the Democrats? You know how much energy you know how much you gave it to
[36:31.800 --> 36:35.160]  us and you got something in the mail that was great for you at the same time. I'm just saying,
[36:35.160 --> 36:38.840]  do you understand? It's not a rhetoric. When I get up here and I tell you, this is the fight.
[36:39.800 --> 36:47.080]  This is 26 years of work and us together all to this moment to still be on air during this point.
[36:47.080 --> 36:50.840]  This wasn't supposed to happen. We were supposed to be gone. You were supposed to be gone. What you
[36:50.840 --> 36:58.760]  put into us, all that energy to keep this thing spinning until it's unstoppable. And now we're
[36:58.760 --> 37:03.560]  right there at the edge of that point. I'm going to say again, you need the prayer. We're in this
[37:03.560 --> 37:06.760]  together. That isn't something where I'm telling you we're in this together. So we have like,
[37:06.760 --> 37:12.200]  you feel like we're together. We're together. You did this. It's a spiritual connection. I could
[37:12.200 --> 37:20.360]  feel it. It's so strong right now. It's amazing. You pray, you promote, you support yourself.
[37:21.320 --> 37:25.480]  We're unstoppable together. And I'm telling you now is the time you think you put some energy into
[37:25.480 --> 37:30.040]  this before. Now is the time to not even try to summon the energy. Just do it.
[37:30.040 --> 37:37.720]  Just get it done. However you spread the word, however you warn people, whatever you do, now is
[37:37.720 --> 37:43.080]  the time. Okay, so I'm sitting over there last night in the office and we're like, yeah, we've
[37:43.080 --> 37:46.520]  almost sold out of all the best selling products. You got to end the special. We got two new products
[37:46.520 --> 37:49.400]  that came in. You got to cut ads for the new products. We're excited about them. That'll be
[37:49.400 --> 37:53.720]  about next week. What do you want to do? I just said 60% off. I said, I wouldn't be 50 this year,
[37:53.720 --> 37:57.880]  but I'm it's on a promise. I think things are so crazy. I just want to get everything out of the
[37:57.880 --> 38:02.920]  warehouse. That's just what my gut tells me. So 60% off across the board, flash sale,
[38:02.920 --> 38:08.920]  infoworkstore.com, our biggest sale of the year with 60% off top products. And this will only

[38:45.720 --> 38:53.480]  dollars off, swarable foods available again. Just gut level, I'm just like, expend everything
[38:53.480 --> 38:59.320]  because let me tell you, we don't win this at 157 days. It's going to be decades of hell.
[38:59.320 --> 39:03.880]  We're going to be in the Soviet Union like the Russians. We may be under 80 years of them kicking
[39:03.880 --> 39:07.560]  the snot out of us. We'll come at it on the other end, but man, they're going to kill tens of,
[39:07.560 --> 39:10.760]  they're going to kill everybody. I mean, they're going to drink your freaking blood,
[39:10.760 --> 39:14.760]  they're going to rape your children. I mean, let me tell you something. You go, people,
[39:14.760 --> 39:18.920]  people living in America, they're like, that sounds crazy. Get ready. They're going to stop
[39:18.920 --> 39:25.080]  your guts out in a gulag for decades because that's what they want is to rape good people.
[39:27.800 --> 39:34.360]  The very same scum that did that in Russia are like literally just sitting there salivating
[39:34.360 --> 39:39.240]  over what they're about to do to you and your family. So whatever energy you got, whatever it is
[39:39.240 --> 39:45.080]  you need to do, you need to decide, hey, you want to bend over and take it or you want to stand up
[39:45.080 --> 39:50.360]  and fight. This is where we fight. This is where we stand. This is who we are. We're not backing
[39:50.360 --> 39:58.200]  down and we got Jesus Christ on our side. As I record this announcement, there's only one
[39:58.200 --> 40:05.160]  week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020. We will not have this sale that's coming on right now in
[40:05.160 --> 40:13.320]  May until our Christmas sale comes up. All of our best selling supplements are 30 to 60% off
[40:13.320 --> 40:20.440]  at M4store.com. Let me just hone in on one of the products, DNA Force Plus. It's got high quality
[40:20.440 --> 40:26.920]  PQQ, CoQ10 and a bunch of other natural ingredients that are known to supercharge the effects of that.
[40:26.920 --> 40:33.320]  Learn what PQQ and CoQ10 can do for you no matter how old you are, no matter what color you are,

[40:38.440 --> 40:44.440]  regrow nerves. It's designed so that your telomeres last longer. Doesn't make them grow,
[40:44.440 --> 40:51.320]  make some shrink, slow, which is basically the same thing. DNA Force Plus is 50% off for a limited
[40:51.320 --> 40:58.360]  time at M4store.com. I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying our economy slowing down
[40:58.360 --> 41:03.560]  and shutting down is like shooting a deer and it runs 100 yards before it knows it's been shot and
[41:03.560 --> 41:09.000]  then it finally dies. She said, oh yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there was an
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.040]  argument in the street and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the
[41:14.040 --> 41:19.080]  head had blood pouring out, a huge hole and he was holding it and he walked around gibbering,
[41:19.080 --> 41:24.360]  talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead. Well, that's what's going to
[41:24.360 --> 41:30.760]  happen with our economy. It is in cardiac arrest. This has been done by design and the UN, the Chi
[41:30.760 --> 41:37.320]  Coms, the mainstream media orchestrated it, hyped it and tried to keep the economy closed. So remember
[41:37.320 --> 41:42.440]  the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the UN, on Bill and Melinda
[41:42.440 --> 41:48.520]  Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on the Democrats. We tried to stop it, we tried to fight
[41:48.520 --> 41:53.800]  it, but you guys said you wanted to wreck America and the world and now you've done it. Congratulations.
[41:53.800 --> 42:01.800]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key. Sure, coffee, candy,
[42:01.800 --> 42:08.040]  and other highly sugar-filled drinks can give you a short boost, but the crash always follows.
[42:08.040 --> 42:14.360]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help,
[42:14.360 --> 42:21.240]  turbo force. Similar to other mix and energy packets, turbo force from info wars life utilizes
[42:21.240 --> 42:28.360]  vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide
[42:28.360 --> 42:34.920]  focus, clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it. Turbo force is certainly a force to be
[42:34.920 --> 42:41.480]  reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy. And speaking of affordable, you can even
[42:41.480 --> 42:49.240]  try turbo force for a limited time at an incredible 40% off. Don't wait till it's out of stock again
[42:49.240 --> 42:55.000]  and get turbo force right now only at infowarstore.com.
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.560]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[42:59.560 --> 43:03.400]  The globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and they're like,
[43:03.400 --> 43:08.760]  yeah, you're taking implantable chips. Yeah, we're into pedophilia. Yeah, we're into world
[43:08.760 --> 43:15.080]  government. Yeah, you're obsolete. You are non-essential. We are shutting your ass down.
[43:15.080 --> 43:19.880]  Yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[43:19.880 --> 43:24.440]  You're going to be the service economy. And now the globalists are telling you that there's no
[43:24.440 --> 43:29.720]  more service economy and you're obsolete. So you better bow down to them and get your universal
[43:29.720 --> 43:36.360]  pens income so they can dictate your life. The handcuffs are going on right now. We have to resist
[43:36.360 --> 43:40.760]  and say no to the new world order. And that takes you understanding you were right and
[43:40.760 --> 43:45.240]  understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now
[43:45.240 --> 43:51.160]  while you still can. Now is the time for action. Now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul
[43:51.160 --> 44:11.960]  Revere's you know you are. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:11.960 --> 44:29.800]  CNN is CHICOM funded. CNN is Muslim Brotherhood funded. You ask why the police finally understand
[44:29.800 --> 44:34.680]  what's happening and arrest the CNN reporters. The intel is they're operatives behind the scenes.
[44:34.680 --> 44:38.600]  We're obviously directing things. You've got other MSNBC reporters, others saying there's
[44:38.600 --> 44:43.160]  no rioting happening with buildings on fire behind them. It's like Mars attack or shooting and going
[44:43.160 --> 44:48.360]  don't run where you're friends. This is so in your face. And again I just showed you the documents
[44:48.360 --> 44:55.000]  earlier the smoking gun. Soros funding plans for race-based martial law without of town groups
[44:55.000 --> 45:00.360]  brought in on buses almost all white leftist communists. I don't want to bash white people but
[45:00.360 --> 45:06.200]  I mean it is almost all white people that are trying to manipulate black people into rioting
[45:06.200 --> 45:12.040]  and doing this to get it to go nationwide to then stall the economy for the CHICOMs. Here is
[45:12.040 --> 45:17.560]  the local police in Minnesota actually announcing this. We're hearing from our local community
[45:17.560 --> 45:21.800]  leaders that many of the people that were involved in the criminal conduct last night
[45:21.800 --> 45:27.720]  were not known many apologons to them and so so yes there were certainly people who were involved
[45:27.720 --> 45:32.120]  in the activities last night that were certainly not recognized as being here from the city.
[45:32.120 --> 45:39.880]  You can't take America on head on. You take our wounds, you take issues we've had, you exacerbate
[45:39.880 --> 45:45.640]  them and you use a cop who deserves to be charged in my view putting this knee on somebody's
[45:45.640 --> 45:52.280]  crowded artery. Manslaughter bare minimum. Police already been fired. The word is just
[45:52.280 --> 45:57.400]  going to get indicted. So why when a black person kills a white person everybody doesn't riot because
[45:57.400 --> 46:08.680]  the media is telling everyone to do it. Let's go back to this. Minneapolis rioters set fire
[46:08.680 --> 46:28.600]  to the precinct and again they shoot off fireworks and celebrate it here it is.
[46:28.600 --> 46:42.040]  Oh but the mayor came out and said make sure you social distance yourself for that whole hoax.
[46:43.720 --> 46:48.200]  And you've got all the little trendy white guys out there the allies that are like we agree.
[46:50.520 --> 46:55.720]  We don't care about the half the black babies being aborted. We don't care about real issues.
[46:55.720 --> 46:59.480]  We just oh this guy died so the media told us burn everything down so we did.
[47:02.520 --> 47:06.840]  Now let's show what happened right before this. Minneapolis police officers abandoned
[47:06.840 --> 47:09.880]  the third precinct because when people are coming with mall off cocktails to
[47:09.880 --> 47:16.440]  commit attempted murder to burn you up the the answer is run. And now the answer is we're coming
[47:16.440 --> 47:20.760]  to your suburb to get you white people. Imagine a group of white folks saying we're coming to
[47:20.760 --> 47:26.040]  your neighborhoods to get you. This is and you got all the rappers going it's time to fight back.
[47:26.040 --> 47:29.560]  They never say a damn thing about abortion. They never say a damn thing about eugenics
[47:29.560 --> 47:35.640]  or all the autism of boys one in 35,000 had it. Now it's 150 something how boys are under attack.
[47:38.360 --> 47:43.160]  It's all about taking that one thing when the media says because Joe Biden is out there saying
[47:43.160 --> 47:47.640]  you're not black if you don't vote for me. That's a big faux pas. So now this gets triggered.
[47:47.640 --> 47:53.080]  Minneapolis police officer abandons the police officers abandon the third precinct. Here it is.
[48:04.920 --> 48:09.880]  You know statistics really show cops don't take black guys to jail for almost anything or women.
[48:10.920 --> 48:15.960]  The statistics show they're twice as likely per capita to shoot whites. In most cases the white
[48:15.960 --> 48:21.880]  person is trying to hurt the cop. It's justified. Some cases it's not. The point is is that the
[48:21.880 --> 48:25.800]  police are just going to evacuate your area and then you're going to have total crime.
[48:28.120 --> 48:32.040]  But ice cube how many cops have to kill black Americans before we strike back.
[48:32.040 --> 48:35.320]  You know it's funny ice cube I have the statistics I'll get to those next hour but
[48:36.760 --> 48:43.080]  the fact that there's 10 to 1 black on white attacks 10 to 1 it's still a low statistic but
[48:43.080 --> 48:49.720]  compared. I mean let me tell you the oracle limitation of a white person is pretty accurate.
[48:49.720 --> 48:52.840]  The average white person is not out there looking for trouble. That's just what I've
[48:52.840 --> 48:55.080]  experienced. Now I grew up in Dallas. I had a lot of black friends.
[48:57.720 --> 49:05.880]  And I also got attacked because I was white. Now did I didn't blame all black people
[49:05.880 --> 49:10.200]  because of that? No I didn't. But let me tell you the average black person whining and bitching
[49:10.200 --> 49:15.960]  about all the things why they did to them. Give me a break. You know that's not true.
[49:15.960 --> 49:19.560]  You know white people on average bunch of insecure people that kiss your ass all day long.
[49:20.440 --> 49:23.960]  And you know at the end of the day who you're scared of when you're walking on the street
[49:23.960 --> 49:29.400]  at night because that's what's happened in the degradation and the and the democratic party
[49:29.400 --> 49:34.120]  plantation. That wasn't happening in the black community 70 80 years ago. I've got the statistics.
[49:34.120 --> 49:38.360]  They were some of the most orderly successful groups their own hotels their own restaurants
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.680]  their own everything. But and I'm not saying go back to segregation but that oppression
[49:42.680 --> 49:49.960]  made them stronger. Instead oh the man gives you money now to not have a man in the home.
[49:49.960 --> 49:53.880]  What has it done your community? It's destroyed it. It's the same formula for us all. What did
[49:53.880 --> 50:00.280]  LBJ say about this is a great you know society. He said we're going to get these inwards on
[50:00.280 --> 50:07.800]  welfare. We'll own them and control them for 100 years. Well it's been 60 years.
[50:10.680 --> 50:15.960]  So you want another 40 of this? Because I tell you Donald Trump's not trying to enslave you.
[50:16.760 --> 50:20.840]  Donald Trump gets this is a time bomb is trying to fix this. Donald Trump wants to sell you
[50:20.840 --> 50:25.560]  golf memberships no matter what color you are. He really likes you. So do I.
[50:25.560 --> 50:32.360]  I want success man. I don't want burnout cities and everybody killing each other acting like
[50:32.360 --> 50:38.680]  a bunch of idiots. But that's where it's going. Now here is the disgusting clip the Minnesota
[50:38.680 --> 50:46.200]  mayor Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey anger shown as a result of 400 years of slavery.
[50:46.200 --> 50:51.080]  So you're going to burn down mainly black businesses to show whitey oh oh you're there
[50:51.080 --> 50:58.840]  encouraging it you see. Here it is. What we've seen over the last two days
[51:00.520 --> 51:06.120]  and the emotion ridden conflict. We're going to fake this guy. Last night is the result
[51:07.960 --> 51:15.560]  of so much built up anger and sadness. Listen what a fake is. Anger and sadness that has been
[51:15.560 --> 51:21.400]  ingrained in our black community not just because of five minutes of horror.
[51:22.920 --> 51:32.280]  But 400 years. If you're feeling that sadness and that anger it's not only understandable.
[51:32.280 --> 51:35.720]  It's right. Well listen son you're not getting an Oscar for this collection
[51:36.520 --> 51:42.840]  of the truth that our black community look at that little oily turd. While not from lived
[51:42.840 --> 51:49.080]  experience that sadness must also be understood by our non black communities.
[51:50.680 --> 51:59.000]  To ignore it to toss it out would be to ignore the values we all claim to have. You know if
[51:59.000 --> 52:03.160]  black people found out that Planned Parenthood the Democratic Party targeted them and killed
[52:03.160 --> 52:06.760]  30 million black people or whatever then I could see kind of burn it down Democrat facilities.
[52:06.760 --> 52:11.160]  I'm not saying do that. But this guy's saying this is all legitimate to burn down black
[52:11.160 --> 52:16.760]  neighborhoods because he wants you totally control. He's a dirty communist trained by Soros.
[52:16.760 --> 52:22.920]  Look at that little oily turd. He's a controller. There ain't no black people live around him.
[52:22.920 --> 52:33.320]  I'm going to empty it. Get him off the screen. This is just getting insane.
[52:33.320 --> 52:41.080]  Let's go to clip 14. Armed citizens stand with protesters but defend stores from looters.
[52:41.960 --> 52:45.320]  Yeah the protesting is one thing. The looting and burning is another here it is.
[52:46.600 --> 52:53.000]  So tell me who you are. Well I mean free Americans. Yeah. And what are you doing today?
[52:53.000 --> 52:58.520]  We were out here yesterday too down on the original protest site. Basically you see the
[52:58.520 --> 53:04.920]  records of cops keep and cops are a lot less likely to try and tread on people's rights when
[53:04.920 --> 53:10.040]  there's other armed Americans with them. So I figured it's about damn time that some. That
[53:10.040 --> 53:17.960]  old boy's got a half a can of Copenhagen in his left. And why are you protecting this store?
[53:17.960 --> 53:24.040]  Well I mean this wasn't exactly a special reaction. We've been kind of we've been moving around and
[53:24.040 --> 53:28.200]  just trying to see what's what without getting necessarily completely slapped by massive groups
[53:28.200 --> 53:32.840]  of people. And while we were walking somebody mentioned that there were some guys at the back
[53:32.840 --> 53:36.520]  was after we wanted to know if they were over to buy something. And I said that they're they're
[53:36.520 --> 53:42.840]  closed and they're defending the businesses. Oh yeah targets on fire. By the way. Yeah.
[53:42.840 --> 53:46.680]  But anyway so we heard that we're like well we better we better get up and go see if these guys
[53:46.680 --> 53:51.400]  need help. And turns out these guys are out here with shattered windows trying to keep looters out
[53:51.400 --> 53:54.440]  of the business because cops can't get in here. By the way if you're going to burn something I'm
[53:54.440 --> 53:59.800]  not saying burn anything but targets a good place to start. I mean that is a globalist leftist. It's
[53:59.800 --> 54:03.400]  kind of funny that's what people are burning when they they're fighting this whole race war thing.
[54:03.400 --> 54:07.320]  It's such an evil company. But don't burn anything folks you're only going to hurt innocent people.
[54:08.120 --> 54:13.480]  So there you go. This is this is the next surprise folks and it's going to get crazier
[54:13.480 --> 54:18.200]  and crazier. I mean you know China is announcing that they are preparing to invade Hong Kong and
[54:18.200 --> 54:22.760]  Taiwan. I mean that's like all over the far news. We're just busy about one dude dying
[54:22.760 --> 54:28.360]  and they're going to charge the cop. We've got a very informed person coming in to talk about
[54:28.360 --> 54:33.240]  this coming up. Then we'll look at Trump and his move against big tech censorship that Yahoo
[54:33.240 --> 54:38.040]  claims is toothless. Well it's only toothless if the president doesn't press the attack.
[54:38.040 --> 54:49.000]  Infowars.com spread those live links. This is the end my friends. My only friends the end
[54:49.000 --> 54:57.240]  of our elaborate plans the end of everything that stands the end. The safety the delusion.
[54:58.040 --> 55:02.760]  It's all over ladies and gentlemen because it was only the mirage of safety.
[55:03.480 --> 55:08.920]  Movies and partying and living like children. Never growing up. Never caring about other people.
[55:09.800 --> 55:15.080]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny. Just like the history books show us just like
[55:15.080 --> 55:19.560]  the Bible states every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God
[55:20.360 --> 55:25.800]  they were brought into captivity because their people sold out to special interests
[55:25.800 --> 55:31.560]  that were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved. We are repeating that again today
[55:31.560 --> 55:39.080]  compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage. Infowars has decided to fight
[55:39.080 --> 55:46.440]  for freedom. Infowars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers. Memorial Day is

[56:47.720 --> 56:51.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:51.480 --> 57:12.760]  The collectivist the anti god forces have been preparing their assault. They're beavering away
[57:12.760 --> 57:23.960]  like termites in the walls of humanity but now they're emerged. Now there's not going to be
[57:23.960 --> 57:34.680]  any more sneaking around folks. All the party time is over. The games are over now and President
[57:34.680 --> 57:38.760]  Trump came out yesterday we got more of it coming up with lawyers and others here in studio and said
[57:38.760 --> 57:43.000]  I'm going out for big tech. Well are there really cases to do that? Yes there are and yes this is
[57:43.000 --> 57:48.760]  not a toothless attack. If you finally wake up to how far the scam and the abuse of big tech is
[57:48.760 --> 57:53.320]  gone. The first year's president Trump yesterday signed an executive order in his first statements.
[57:54.760 --> 58:01.880]  The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress edit blacklist shadow ban are
[58:01.880 --> 58:07.240]  editorial decisions pure and simple. They're editorial decisions. In those moments Twitter
[58:07.240 --> 58:13.320]  ceases to be a neutral public platform and they become an editor with a viewpoint and I think we
[58:13.320 --> 58:17.320]  can say that about others also whether you're looking at Google whether you're looking at Facebook
[58:17.320 --> 58:25.320]  and perhaps others. One egregious example is when they try to silence views that they disagree with
[58:25.320 --> 58:33.720]  by selectively applying a fact check fact check FACT fact check. What they choose to fact check
[58:33.720 --> 58:40.280]  and what they choose to ignore or even promote is nothing more than a political activism group
[58:40.280 --> 58:46.600]  or political activism and it's inappropriate. You look at what's happened you look at where
[58:46.600 --> 58:51.560]  they're going where they're coming from. I think you all see it yourselves a censorship and bias
[58:51.560 --> 58:57.400]  is a threat to freedom itself. Imagine if your phone company silenced or edited your conversation
[58:57.400 --> 59:03.080]  social media companies are vastly more power and more reach than any phone company in the United
[59:03.080 --> 59:10.360]  States. More reach actually than your newspapers by far more reach than a lot of your traditional
[59:10.360 --> 59:17.080]  forms of communication. Therefore today I'm signing executive order to protect and uphold
[59:17.080 --> 59:23.240]  the free speech and rights of the American people. Currently social media giants like Twitter receive
[59:23.240 --> 59:29.880]  an unprecedented liability shield based on the theory that they're a neutral platform which they
[59:29.880 --> 59:37.160]  are not not an editor with a viewpoint. My executive order calls for new regulations under
[59:37.160 --> 59:43.720]  section 230 of the communications decency act to make it that social media companies that engage
[59:43.720 --> 59:49.320]  in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield. That's a
[59:49.320 --> 59:53.960]  big deal. They have a shield they can do what they want they have a shield they're not going to have
[59:53.960 --> 1:00:01.240]  that shield. My executive order further instructs the Federal Trade Commission FTC to prohibit
[1:00:01.240 --> 1:00:06.920]  social media companies from engaging in any deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce.
[1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:12.840]  This authority resides in section five of the Federal Trade Commission Act. I think you know
[1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:17.640]  it pretty well. Most of you know it very well. I would think you know it quite well right.
[1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:24.760]  Additionally I'm directing the Attorney General to work cooperatively with the states. He's going
[1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:30.280]  to be working very much and very closely in cooperation with the states to enforce their own
[1:00:30.280 --> 1:00:36.360]  laws against such deceptive business practices. The states have broad and powerful authority to
[1:00:36.360 --> 1:00:41.720]  regulate in this arena and they'll be doing it also and we encourage them to do it if they see
[1:00:41.720 --> 1:00:49.480]  exactly as we've been seeing. It's what they're doing is tantamount to monopoly you can say it's
[1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:55.320]  tantamount to taking over the airwaves. Can't let it happen otherwise we're not going to have a
[1:00:55.320 --> 1:01:02.360]  democracy. We're not going to have anything to do with a republic. Finally I'm directing my administration
[1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:08.200]  to develop policies and procedures to ensure taxpayer dollars are not going in any social
[1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:17.240]  media company that repress free speech. The government spends billions of dollars on giving
[1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:22.440]  them money. They're rich enough so we're going to be doing none of it or very little of it.
[1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:27.800]  As president I'll not allow the American people to be bullied by these giant corporations. Many
[1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:35.080]  people have wanted this to be done by presidents for a long time and now we're doing it and I'm
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:39.240]  sure they'll be doing a lawsuit and I'm also sure that we're going to be going for legislation in
[1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:43.800]  addition to this and the legislation will start immediately and I'll tell you I've been called
[1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:50.520]  by democrats that want to do this and so I think you could possibly have a bipartisan situation but
[1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:59.160]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an
[1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:06.920]  elk at say 600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart they'll still run 50 60 70 maybe 100
[1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:12.680]  yards they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins but all
[1:02:12.680 --> 1:02:18.920]  of a sudden they slow down they realize what's happened they fall over and they die then you go
[1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:25.240]  bag them and haul them back in well that's what's going to happen to the entire world now and that's
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:31.880]  what the economic numbers show is that we've been shot right in the heart and for the first world
[1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:37.080]  it's going to mean a long horrible depression and a lot of death well for the third world it's going
[1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:41.080]  to mean probably over 100 million dead according to the UN and I believe their numbers because it's
[1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:46.600]  the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world so that all the leftists had
[1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:50.120]  thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump you're a bunch of suckers and you bought
[1:02:50.120 --> 1:03:06.040]  into something better than what Hitler did
[1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:13.160]  we're coming for the suburbs next as the Soros funded operative in Minnesota it's real bogus they
[1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:17.560]  got to get it right I mean otherwise this is gonna happen and ain't nothing left here so when we
[1:03:17.560 --> 1:03:21.880]  start coming to the suburbs when we come to the government center then what's all gonna do you
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:27.560]  see what I'm saying so hey that's just what's gonna happen you know I want to be clear in how I
[1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:35.080]  characterize this this is a mostly a protest it is not it is not generally speaking unruly
[1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:41.880]  what fires have been started and and there's a crowd that so it's not unruly and they did burn
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:47.480]  down the police department and the media is all out there we know Soros is publicly funding it that's
[1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:51.800]  now major gateway pun and articles hand to someone's covering we got the original documents that are
[1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:56.680]  just total smoking guns for the White House where Soros is funding these plans going back years ago
[1:03:57.320 --> 1:04:02.040]  and Tim's a friend of mine he's he's been in the army and the marines and black water and an awesome
[1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:07.000]  police department and a federal stuff everything else and he works around here with us some and
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.960]  he said you know I'm ready to go on air even though he doesn't go on air a lot so he's here to talk
[1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:16.600]  about this so many questions so he thinks surrounding Minneapolis arresting officer
[1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:24.280]  Joy Floyd worked together at a restaurant at a nightclub as bouncers a lot of weirdness but but
[1:04:24.280 --> 1:04:30.120]  without getting into that story up front just in general the police evacuating the mayor saying we
[1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:36.280]  deserve this clearly the left is trying to initiate this and incubate this in the left of city I think
[1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:42.200]  for a larger event so you wonder what's after the COVID-19 hoax I mean I think it's it's burn baby
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:50.040]  burn replay the 60s absolutely I think that if you follow this the playbook is the exact same
[1:04:50.040 --> 1:04:55.400]  thing we saw with Michael Brown with you know Trayvon Martin with so many different incidences
[1:04:55.400 --> 1:05:00.520]  that have occurred there's a initial narrative that set they want to keep that narrative going no
[1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:05.560]  matter how many news stories come out disputing that narrative afterwards they go with the initial
[1:05:05.560 --> 1:05:12.680]  narrative and they stoke the fears they stoke the hate they tried to create a racial divide
[1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:19.720]  and make these incidences about race and some are but some aren't and in this case there's
[1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:27.000]  absolutely zero proof or evidence that I've seen that would indicate that this case has anything to
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:33.240]  do with race well go over that because we talked last night this morning what the officer is doing
[1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:37.160]  is not a recognized normal technique I mean it's obviously something's wrong there but the point
[1:05:37.160 --> 1:05:41.320]  is is that now we know they work together things really get weird for that point on yeah and and
[1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:47.320]  that just shows right I mean the first thing that everybody saw obviously is a white officer kneeling
[1:05:47.320 --> 1:05:54.600]  on a black suspect's neck for an extended period of time okay it was hard for me to watch um it's
[1:05:54.600 --> 1:05:59.240]  hard for anyone to watch all my police officer friends that I've talked to have all expressed
[1:05:59.240 --> 1:06:06.520]  outrage at the technique uh and the way it was applied okay now it becomes cloudy when you look
[1:06:06.520 --> 1:06:12.840]  at the Minneapolis use of force policy and you realize that they teach that they teach that and
[1:06:12.840 --> 1:06:17.080]  do a doctor camp shot yeah you you and your other officers have never heard of this this is this is
[1:06:17.080 --> 1:06:23.400]  crazy right so what we have here we have uh the Minneapolis city of Minneapolis use of force uh
[1:06:23.400 --> 1:06:30.840]  we printed that out today uh under section five dash three one one use of neck restraints and choke
[1:06:30.840 --> 1:06:37.640]  holds okay then goes into the definition so a neck restraint is defined a non-deadly force option
[1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:44.600]  defined as compressing one or both sides of a person's neck with an arm or leg without applying
[1:06:44.600 --> 1:06:50.360]  direct pressure to the trachea or airway front of neck only sworn employees who have received
[1:06:50.360 --> 1:06:57.400]  training from the mpd training unit are authorized to use neck restraints the mpd authorizes two
[1:06:57.400 --> 1:07:04.600]  types of neck restraints conscious neck restraints and unconscious neck restraint which i've never
[1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:11.400]  even heard of a police department teaching a unconscious neck restraint what does that mean
[1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:16.200]  well so that's they go into the definition a conscious neck restraint the subject is placed
[1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:22.440]  in the neck restraint with intent to control and not to render the subject unconscious by only applying
[1:07:22.440 --> 1:07:29.080]  light to moderate pressure a unconscious neck restraint the subject is placed in a neck restraint
[1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:34.760]  with the intention of rendering the person unconscious by applying adequate pressure
[1:07:35.960 --> 1:07:40.920]  so it's taught it's taught in the Minneapolis police department have you ever heard of that
[1:07:40.920 --> 1:07:47.880]  um in mma uh you know it's it's very rare to find out who is they taught the cops to choke people
[1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:52.360]  yeah that's i mean folks you don't know a lot of times you can knock somebody out in five seconds
[1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:57.960]  but about one percent of the time they die this dude's on him for like five minutes so again these
[1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:02.760]  idiots were taught this they were at least it appears they were now we don't know if this
[1:08:02.760 --> 1:08:07.400]  particular officer but you've got the documents that they're teaching potentially lethal force stuff
[1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:14.280]  and calling it non-lethal yes that technique is is sat there and talked at the Minneapolis
[1:08:14.280 --> 1:08:17.480]  police because you know you said i was right yesterday you were listening to show you've
[1:08:17.480 --> 1:08:20.200]  been in a lot of different ages you never heard of this we're like yeah you don't put your knee
[1:08:20.200 --> 1:08:26.920]  on somebody's crowded artery no no so yeah and especially you know we talk about we talk about
[1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:31.720]  some of the things that we know come along with this right we know since the 1990s police
[1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:38.120]  apartments have been trained uh to look for the dangers of positional asphyxia uh to look for the
[1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:45.240]  dangers of excited delirium right we know that when people use drugs when people use alcohol
[1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:50.680]  and they go through the stress of an arrest and uh the stress of being restrained that excited
[1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:57.320]  delirium is a possibility right and that excited delirium can wind up killing that person if they
[1:08:57.320 --> 1:09:03.080]  remain restrained and without novice panic attack yes that that's basically yeah so the heart starts
[1:09:03.080 --> 1:09:08.680]  beating the heart the heart increases at such a rate that finally they wind up having a cardiac
[1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:16.440]  arrest if you look at the 2016 death of uh tony tempa in dallas that's exactly what they the
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:22.440]  corner ruled killed him uh if you look at uh there's video there right there right exactly right
[1:09:22.440 --> 1:09:26.680]  so you see here the officer is not placing his knee on the neck but instead in the shoulder
[1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:32.920]  blade right most agency would say okay that's acceptable right but then the paramedics give
[1:09:32.920 --> 1:09:38.440]  him a sedative to try to calm him down in just like in this case with mr floyd this person was
[1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:43.240]  saying i can't breathe i'm having trouble breathing the officers didn't take him serious they laughed
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:50.280]  about it um but the corner in the autopsy ruled that it was a homicide and that the victim died of
[1:09:50.280 --> 1:09:57.640]  a sudden cardiac death due to the toxic effects of cocaine and a stress associated with physical
[1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:03.720]  restraint right so like a rabbit dying when you you know he just died of he died of being scared
[1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:10.680]  right so so we see this we see this uh for for 20 years now we've known that this is a possibility
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:18.120]  and to me the disturbing part of the george floyd video is that the officer doesn't seem to recognize
[1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:25.160]  wait a minute this guy could be experiencing the symptoms of excited delirium even if he's not
[1:10:25.160 --> 1:10:30.600]  we need to at least in law enforcement be on the lookout what the difference is it's not
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:36.360]  hands pushing the guy down his back right his his knees on the nerve which exasperates the and and
[1:10:36.360 --> 1:10:42.280]  even let's say for a second let's say that the pressure applied was that the the blood flow
[1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:47.000]  wasn't cut off from the brain right let's let's just say for a second that the the pressure was
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  light enough that could not have the blood flow but it's it the what causes excited delirium is
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:57.880]  not just necessarily the actual physical actions of the officer it's what that person who's handcuffed
[1:10:57.880 --> 1:11:03.480]  on his stomach is perceiving so if he perceives that he is and he said you're killing me you're
[1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:09.560]  right and that's what i'm saying that that induces the panic that increases the panic and at that point
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:13.880]  in my opinion he should have been placed in a recovery position but but i asked the question
[1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:18.840]  why do they just tasering you see the cop there with the taser he did at least one officer that i
[1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:25.480]  saw on the scene did have a taser you know it's it's controversial and and again some some people
[1:11:25.480 --> 1:11:31.400]  feel that tasers work in situations where i'd rather be tased than some cop with his knee on my neck
[1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:37.320]  sure but again we're talking about if you look at if you look at the 911 call right the caller who
[1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:43.880]  made the 911 call requesting the police to come to the scene said specifically that they believe
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:51.960]  that george floyd was drunk and not in control of himself right the quote says we tell him to
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:57.000]  give us their phone to put things back and everything and he was also drunk and everything
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:02.600]  and returned to give us our cigarettes back so he can so he can go home but he doesn't want to do that
[1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:08.040]  and he's sitting on his car because he is awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself this is
[1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:14.440]  what the 911 this is what the person called 911 told the dispatcher so it's possible in that in
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:19.320]  that case if that information was related to police that they felt perhaps maybe tasing him wouldn't
[1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:24.120]  be effective sometimes when people are on drugs or alcohol they don't necessarily get all that
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:27.880]  my whole point is the cops didn't just randomly go grab this guy i'm not defending what they did
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:32.760]  i'm saying this isn't something master plan to kill the black dude no no and i don't i don't even believe
[1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:37.560]  right now that there's enough evidence or enough facts to show that race played a factor here well
[1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:42.760]  now that you have that the city trains this this this mma crap now we know it's the city that's
[1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:55.000]  liable this is big news folks we'll be right back we're living in insanely dangerous times and i've
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:59.560]  told folks the one back three months ago i'm not buying storeable food because i'm worried about
[1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:03.960]  the covid-19 virus i'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now
[1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:08.760]  it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun it's already caused food shortages and the collapse of
[1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:13.320]  farms and ranches across the united states and it's even worse in the third world so i hope trump
[1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:18.120]  with his initiatives could clean this up and fix it but with the election fraud and the covid-19
[1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:22.920]  all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on now is the time to
[1:13:22.920 --> 1:13:28.360]  get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years they're in easily totable bags it's high
[1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:32.680]  quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready and it funds the info war so we

[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:19.480]  the shesh they all do it now do you remember the mass riots and looting after muslim cop
[1:15:19.480 --> 1:15:26.520]  mohammed noor shot justine daimond who was visiting from australia point blank in the chest of
[1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:31.960]  minneapolis for no reason in front of witnesses do you remember all that it took over a year for
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:37.320]  him to get charged i don't care if she was black or white it's wrong the guy's a crazy person
[1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:43.400]  and we have the footage right here where are the riots there people know mistakes are made
[1:15:43.400 --> 1:15:47.480]  we know police aren't angels are just like us as long as they get charged or just something wrong
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:53.240]  that's the issue why is the media then pushing this because it's all they've got by the way the
[1:15:53.240 --> 1:15:58.440]  police officer that kneeled on george floyd's neck and appears to have killed him was just
[1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:06.440]  taking into custody is about to be charged that news is breaking right now former officer derek
[1:16:07.480 --> 1:16:13.080]  shavin if you pronounce that right arrested for death of george floyd turns out the two work
[1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:17.400]  together i can't i'm not defending the guy i don't want a black guy to die or white guy to die the
[1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:21.960]  point is why would you tim like you said we talked yesterday about this we talked today you've got
[1:16:21.960 --> 1:16:26.760]  tons of training your firearms instructor armor or all of it you've never seen this training everybody
[1:16:26.760 --> 1:16:31.160]  knows you don't put any on the credit artery now we learn it's an authorized training so my big
[1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:37.240]  takeaway is not defending this guy but if the official training is that it should stop of the
[1:16:37.240 --> 1:16:42.440]  leftist city what type of weird cook do you have i think this is mma where you choke somebody out in five
[1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:48.440]  seconds in an arrest situation to me that's the big takeaway here tim yeah absolutely and what's
[1:16:48.440 --> 1:16:57.080]  what's baffling to me is if you look at the la pd uh is far back as the mid 1990s uh that's when
[1:16:57.080 --> 1:17:01.960]  they did away with their chokehold this was mid 1990 that was huge news i remember huge news at the
[1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:07.720]  time because they were having so many deaths uh during uh arrest like you said the average healthy
[1:17:07.720 --> 1:17:10.920]  person is not going to die from being choked out but if you've got heart problems you're on
[1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:16.280]  drugs you're dead absolutely exasperates the condition absolutely so i mean i don't mean
[1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:20.600]  to hype this up to defend the cop i'm not defending him he was trained to do that you've got it right
[1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:25.560]  there well the mini apple police department trains that it's it's going to be remained to be seen
[1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:30.600]  whether he took that training or specifically trained in that but definitely that they train
[1:17:30.600 --> 1:17:36.360]  a number of their officers in this technique that is why would they bring that back i don't know i i
[1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:42.040]  really can't fathom why they felt like this would be a good technique to use when there's so many
[1:17:42.040 --> 1:17:48.040]  other options out there well anybody that's ever been any street fighting knows you don't start
[1:17:48.040 --> 1:17:51.240]  choking people out you're getting your ass beat i mean it's a dangerous thing to do well and and
[1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:56.120]  again with the guy already being handcuffed right if we're talking about he's just refusing
[1:17:56.120 --> 1:18:00.680]  transport like he doesn't want to be allowed to be put in a police car or whatever the case may be
[1:18:01.320 --> 1:18:06.920]  it appears at least from the facts that i saw that ems had been called so that at this point
[1:18:06.920 --> 1:18:14.200]  now the police are simply waiting for ems to arrive to check this guy out and why you would have to
[1:18:14.200 --> 1:18:19.960]  apply a neck pin this entire time while you're waiting for ems to arrive is baffling by the way
[1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:24.280]  explain that the average person out there that doesn't know the average police don't want to kill
[1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:27.480]  people who have problems absolutely not you don't want to go to jail you don't want to get
[1:18:27.480 --> 1:18:32.120]  sued you don't want absolutely like the average white cop especially if it's anything the study
[1:18:32.120 --> 1:18:36.360]  shows slow roll like you don't respond to black areas yeah well i mean if you you talk to any
[1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:40.040]  cop out there if they're honest they they're the last person one who want to do something that's
[1:18:40.040 --> 1:18:43.480]  going to get them thrown in jail because quite frankly they know they're not going to do well
[1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:49.160]  in jail they're not the most popular people in jail so there's a there's a big incentive to do
[1:18:49.160 --> 1:18:54.520]  things the right way right and i think that most people that come into law enforcement come into
[1:18:54.520 --> 1:18:59.240]  law enforcement with the right reasons and that is to help to help people that's why i came in
[1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:03.560]  that's why all my friends that i know came in we want to make a difference and we want to help out
[1:19:04.760 --> 1:19:09.800]  so it's it's troubling when we have bad apples but as in any profession we're going to have those
[1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:13.640]  bad apples let's shift here's the way now the left's hyping this the mayor says everybody
[1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:16.520]  deserves this they're burning down the black neighborhoods now they're saying we're going
[1:19:16.520 --> 1:19:21.880]  to everybody's neighborhood uh they are now saying we're going to get the cops um you know
[1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:26.760]  you're going to see a string of cops getting shot randomly around the country what about the crime
[1:19:26.760 --> 1:19:31.800]  being committed there and the left funding this and hyping this because now we you move on past
[1:19:31.800 --> 1:19:35.400]  the officer we know that they were training this it's wrong it should be changed what's going to
[1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:40.440]  happen next though well i first of all i believe that's a complete failure of leadership uh when
[1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:45.320]  you encourage people to go out and loot and steal and rob and commit crimes it doesn't matter what
[1:19:45.320 --> 1:19:50.600]  the justification is it's wrong by the way roll the footage though of the police evacuating the
[1:19:50.600 --> 1:19:54.760]  precinct and i i mean i can't even second guess that are they supposed to shoot people that
[1:19:54.760 --> 1:19:59.080]  is wrong my love cocktails i mean but but but that keeps happening the whole country collapses
[1:19:59.080 --> 1:20:03.560]  sure and and that's that's why they're in a really really difficult position right now because
[1:20:03.560 --> 1:20:09.800]  quite frankly um if they if they react too harshly it's going to increase the riots if they don't
[1:20:09.800 --> 1:20:15.640]  react harshly enough uh more properties burned down so either way it puts the police in a terrible
[1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:20.680]  position right now and the leadership right now is failing the police the the minneapolis leadership
[1:20:20.680 --> 1:20:25.640]  the state leadership is 100% failing those officers i mean look at this is white guys black
[1:20:25.640 --> 1:20:31.320]  guys hispanic guys strutting around running the police then they burn the police department down
[1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:36.680]  which is the city infrastructure right i mean this is like total thug idiocy sure absolutely
[1:20:36.680 --> 1:20:42.680]  and and here's what we see right the reason they feel emboldened to do this is because these people
[1:20:42.680 --> 1:20:47.160]  who are doing this right now they watch the ferguson protest they watched that police allowed
[1:20:47.160 --> 1:20:53.160]  that to happen so with each incident like this it the the the riding becomes quicker and quicker
[1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:58.280]  and quicker and more intense and america's need to get this globalist the chinese government it's in
[1:20:58.280 --> 1:21:04.040]  the news are funding this to break us down they're bad cops great go after them politically whatever
[1:21:04.040 --> 1:21:09.480]  this is a plan to bring us down folks decrep discredit the dollar bring the whole stock market down
[1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:13.640]  so the people that are involved this you're not fighting the man burning down an empty police
[1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:17.960]  department with a bunch of liberal police this is happening because these are liberal cities
[1:21:17.960 --> 1:21:23.960]  where the path of police believe your bs absolutely i agree with that so what else in closing tim's
[1:21:23.960 --> 1:21:30.600]  gonna happen you think well now i think uh obviously this is the first officer charged i think some
[1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:35.640]  additional officers may be charged for failing to age again those watches it yeah i mean it's pretty
[1:21:35.640 --> 1:21:41.720]  clear in their policy in their use of force policy they they write it out that officers who see a
[1:21:41.720 --> 1:21:47.000]  suspect being mishandled or mistreated in any way have a duty under their policy to intervene
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:52.200]  so i'm guessing they're probably gonna go that route um whether they'll be successful in that or
[1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:57.560]  not remains to be seen well watch in the cop what about the weirdness of how he knew this guy they
[1:21:57.560 --> 1:22:03.880]  were bouncers that that is bizarre now i'm hearing two reports i'm hearing that they they overlap
[1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:09.240]  shift for years but then now the owner of that that club apparently is backpedaling a little
[1:22:09.240 --> 1:22:15.320]  bit and saying well there was upwards of sometimes maybe 20 bouncers working there so she's unsure
[1:22:15.320 --> 1:22:19.960]  if they actually knew each other in person or not but it's hard for me to believe that if
[1:22:19.960 --> 1:22:25.560]  there are if there are shifts overlap for years at a time that he wouldn't at least recognize
[1:22:25.560 --> 1:22:31.960]  this is weird what about austin police department actually hosting justice for george floyd events
[1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:37.080]  i don't think this is gonna go too well that that's very troubling um again not enough facts have
[1:22:37.080 --> 1:22:41.960]  come out right and i get it right there they're trying to do damage control even here in austin
[1:22:41.960 --> 1:22:46.680]  even though the incident didn't take place here they want to do damage control but i think again
[1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:53.240]  it's a mistake on the part of austin's leadership including the chief to sit there and uh basically
[1:22:53.240 --> 1:23:01.560]  make insinuations that we don't have all the facts on yet and uh that that's troubling it's dangerous
[1:23:01.560 --> 1:23:07.080]  because we know the overarching plan we have the documents is to cause a civil war race war of course
[1:23:07.080 --> 1:23:11.640]  there's real stuff going there's real wrongs we weren't 350 million people there's all sorts of
[1:23:11.640 --> 1:23:15.560]  wrong going on absolutely yeah and so you don't just take one wrong and then burn the country down
[1:23:15.560 --> 1:23:21.320]  because of that yeah it's inexcusable two wrongs don't make a right and all the looting and and
[1:23:21.320 --> 1:23:25.720]  uh robbery and everything else that's taking place right now is not going to bring george floyd back
[1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:31.080]  in fact in my opinion it dishonors his memory well even his girlfriend says don't do this right
[1:23:31.080 --> 1:23:35.720]  he would never his brother as well yeah everybody's been speaking out about it and saying please stop
[1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:42.040]  but cnn acts like the looters are the good people that's uh yeah that's on par for cnn all right
[1:23:42.040 --> 1:23:46.360]  tim powerful interview thank you so much coming up we've got lawyers and experts in studio talk
[1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:52.600]  about trump's action against big tech stay with us the united states is not communist china we don't
[1:23:52.600 --> 1:23:58.360]  have three million people in concentration camps we don't blow up churches we don't kill political
[1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:03.800]  dissidents and sell their organs but all of the news we see the un available indicates
[1:24:03.800 --> 1:24:10.760]  who mainstream corporate media praising communist china for their response and if communist china
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:15.480]  shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people
[1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:20.040]  well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it cities like san Antonio pass laws saying
[1:24:20.040 --> 1:24:26.040]  will arrest you if you say chinese virus well now qualmo in new york's calling it the european virus
[1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:31.880]  these people are out of control control freaks and they are going to lose big time because we the
[1:24:31.880 --> 1:24:36.600]  people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab the
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:42.520]  resistance lives at bandot video and info wars dot com spread those links and jam it down the
[1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:49.160]  censors throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker the lockdown
[1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:56.600]  is permanent dictatorship the lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights
[1:24:56.600 --> 1:25:03.320]  being suspended and a global medical tyranny led by the who and the middle of the lindigates
[1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:10.680]  foundation in full control many will submit through fear others will be bought off but in the end

[1:27:19.560 --> 1:27:25.640]  here's what the attorney general just had to say yesterday about the move against big text
[1:27:25.640 --> 1:27:31.720]  bullying and suppression of speech in america and again we're going to be doing this we're also
[1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:38.440]  going through congress well as you mentioned mr president one of the things that i found has
[1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:45.720]  the broadest bipartisan support these days is the feeling that this provision section 230 has
[1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:51.720]  been stretched way beyond its original intention and people feel that on both sides of the aisle
[1:27:51.720 --> 1:27:58.360]  this was adopted 25 years ago to protect the fledgling industry and its purpose was to allow
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:03.880]  websites that were serving as essentially bulletin boards for diverse third party
[1:28:04.760 --> 1:28:11.080]  content coming on to say that you're not responsible for the content of that third party
[1:28:11.080 --> 1:28:17.880]  information and it also tried to encourage these companies to take down things like child
[1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:24.200]  pornography or human trafficking advertising and things by saying if you act to remove this kind
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:29.480]  of objectionable material you won't you won't be liable for taking it down now it's been completely
[1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:35.000]  stretched to allow what have become really behemoths who control a lot of the flow of
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:43.240]  information in our society to engage in censorship of that information and to act as editors and
[1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:49.000]  publishers of the material so when they put on their own content like fact check
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:56.200]  content on to other people's content and when they curate their collection and when they
[1:28:56.200 --> 1:29:04.040]  start censoring particular content including in many cases the direction of foreign governments
[1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:09.560]  like communist china they become publishers and they shouldn't be entitled to the same kind of
[1:29:09.560 --> 1:29:17.400]  shield that was set up earlier now this executive order is a very strong step toward addressing
[1:29:17.400 --> 1:29:25.560]  this problem it sets up a rulemaking procedure that will eventually be under the FCC to try to
[1:29:25.560 --> 1:29:32.760]  get back to the original interpretation and understanding of section 230 it also empowers
[1:29:32.760 --> 1:29:39.560]  the attorney general to work with state attorneys general to come up with model legislation that
[1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:46.200]  addresses this at the state level and we're preparing federal legislation which we will be
[1:29:46.200 --> 1:29:54.520]  sending over shortly for review of the office of management budget so this is an important step
[1:29:55.400 --> 1:29:59.560]  to get back to the original understanding you know there's a bit of a bait and switch that's
[1:29:59.560 --> 1:30:07.640]  occurred in our society these companies grew because they held themselves out as public forums
[1:30:07.640 --> 1:30:13.480]  as free public forums where a variety of voices and diverse voices could come on and be heard
[1:30:13.480 --> 1:30:18.600]  that's how they grew that's how they attracted the eyeballs that's why people joined them
[1:30:18.600 --> 1:30:23.400]  but now that they have become these very powerful networks of eyeballs now that they've grown
[1:30:23.400 --> 1:30:29.160]  by holding themselves out as free public forums they've now switched and they are using that market
[1:30:29.160 --> 1:30:35.480]  power to force particular viewpoints and that's wrong and it has to be addressed not only through
[1:30:35.480 --> 1:30:41.480]  this executive order but I think litigation going forward and by further action on Capitol Hill
[1:30:41.480 --> 1:30:47.160]  thank you Mr. President do you have any questions for the attorney general yes actually I do
[1:30:47.160 --> 1:30:52.520]  of mr attorney general not only have you been against section 230 and the president has been
[1:30:52.520 --> 1:30:58.200]  against section 230 the vice president has said he's against section 230 do you believe that the
[1:30:58.200 --> 1:31:05.080]  executive order that the president is about to sign in any way repeals or amend section 230
[1:31:05.080 --> 1:31:12.200]  no it doesn't repeal section 230 and and I'm not against section 230 if it was properly interpreted
[1:31:12.200 --> 1:31:16.520]  interpreted and properly applied but it's been stretched and I don't know if anyone on Capitol
[1:31:16.520 --> 1:31:21.880]  Hill he doesn't agree that it's been stretched because that made me crazy I think this will
[1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:26.440]  get back to the late back possibly all right we've got David night host of the David night show here
[1:31:26.440 --> 1:31:31.000]  on the info wars network 8 a.m to 11 a.m central every week day morning we've got Robert Barnes
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:35.880]  famous constitutional lawyer host of the specialty show we've been doing that is american countdown
[1:31:35.880 --> 1:31:42.200]  weeknights 7 to 9 p.m central here at info wars dot com on the radio and tv satellites as well
[1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:47.640]  huge attempts to cause racial division and race war we'll get to that next hour
[1:31:47.640 --> 1:31:50.600]  also try to open the phones up but while we've got these gentlemen here with us
[1:31:52.280 --> 1:31:57.960]  up front how big is this moved by trump is he actually doing something does his
[1:31:57.960 --> 1:32:01.800]  announcement with his executive order have teeth david night's an engineer but a great
[1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:05.720]  researcher he's got his research yeah he thinks you have it gets enforced yes
[1:32:05.720 --> 1:32:09.800]  robert barnes has been advising i know the republicans and talking to him about what
[1:32:09.800 --> 1:32:13.400]  they should do he's had a chance to see the executive order we're going to lay out the
[1:32:13.400 --> 1:32:17.720]  facts here because this is bigger than just free speech this is about big cartels together
[1:32:17.720 --> 1:32:23.880]  oppressing people coordinating and surveilling us to engage in the censorship so it's like
[1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:29.480]  breaking and entering you have to break into somebody's privacy on their private text messages
[1:32:29.480 --> 1:32:34.360]  you name it now that facebook's doing so is youtube and others you've got to be surveilling them to
[1:32:34.360 --> 1:32:38.680]  commit the robbery of their freedom so we're going to break it all down here today first off
[1:32:38.680 --> 1:32:43.960]  constitutional lawyer robert barnes getting heavy and studio with us is this a toothless attack or
[1:32:43.960 --> 1:32:48.680]  on a scale of 1 to 10 how strong is what trump and barge has launched it's about a seven in other
[1:32:48.680 --> 1:32:52.360]  words so the it's definitely not a toothless attack because it's more than the rhetoric that's come
[1:32:52.360 --> 1:32:56.760]  before it's more than promises that have come before it has specific teeth and that it's going
[1:32:56.760 --> 1:33:02.040]  to defund aspects of it could have gone further in steep funding attempts but it's going to defund
[1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:06.520]  at least any government spending any federal government spending that involves marketing
[1:33:06.520 --> 1:33:12.520]  on any social media engine that is not compliant with the purposes and policies laid out in the
[1:33:12.520 --> 1:33:17.800]  executive order it does do a good job of explaining the legal history and what the intention of section
[1:33:17.800 --> 1:33:23.960]  230 was it basically followed the same script we talked about a year ago on here so the it's
[1:33:23.960 --> 1:33:27.960]  basically almost identical to what we say even the cases you you cited and david said i was
[1:33:27.960 --> 1:33:31.640]  watching david this morning i was like wait i remember we cited those very cases about town
[1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:35.800]  square exactly all this like there's been a competing doctrine out there there's been four
[1:33:35.800 --> 1:33:40.200]  or five different interpretations of section 230 four or five different arguments about how it
[1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:44.840]  should be approached ultimately both attorney general bar and the president adopted the one that
[1:33:44.840 --> 1:33:51.000]  we made a year ago in various emergency broadcasts from info wars last summer and it was it's almost
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:55.080]  a an entire replication it's almost yeah i don't want to take credit but i actually had three law
[1:33:55.080 --> 1:33:59.880]  firms you know send him stuff two years ago it's crazy how much it's in line with what we did but
[1:33:59.880 --> 1:34:03.320]  it just shows he did the original research yeah exactly and then it was the right argument it's
[1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:07.640]  the right argument from a policy perspective right argument from a legal precedent perspective
[1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:13.000]  right argument going forward in terms of a persuasion a persuasion perspective with the public
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:17.400]  so at all those levels it's the right argument to make they're making their explaining section 230
[1:34:17.400 --> 1:34:22.120]  was meant to be for if you're providing the platform in the public square not controlling
[1:34:22.120 --> 1:34:26.280]  who it is that's publishing content in the public square that's who was supposed to be given broad
[1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:30.360]  scale and we're gonna go over all of it he also hits the bait and switch out oh we're open we're
[1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:35.640]  free and then they say oh we're the key is they say we're not censoring while they got it in place
[1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:40.040]  that's also fraud david night yeah and you know as we see the pushback from people like judge and
[1:34:40.040 --> 1:34:46.440]  apolitano people like mike lee why not look at this to me let's just say it nothing against apolitano
[1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:52.040]  yeah uh no no nothing against apolitano but he's totally compromised yeah well i mean i mean listen
[1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:57.320]  listen yeah we could end this all right now with apolitano so the apolitano doesn't even count
[1:34:57.320 --> 1:35:02.760]  well it's not just i say that because you know apolitano and and lee are making the same
[1:35:02.760 --> 1:35:06.200]  arguments that i've seen from the kato institute from the heritage institute a lot of these people
[1:35:06.200 --> 1:35:10.680]  are saying yeah no the talking points that we see the the talking points we see right they're
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:15.160]  saying this is a private corporation they can do whatever they want nothing this is not a competition
[1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:20.600]  between their private rights and my private rights because when we start talking about the 230 section
[1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:26.120]  230 i think the best analogy i can think of is when we go back and we look at what happened
[1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:32.280]  in the great depression when we came up with fdic insurance to insure deposits we also had
[1:35:32.280 --> 1:35:38.120]  restrictions on what the banks could do and we said with the glass steagle act you cannot then
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:43.720]  continue to participate in risky speculative investments you've got to diverse these two
[1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:48.680]  things right and so what we're allowing them to do is the same thing that we allowed the big
[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:53.880]  banks to do when we remove the glass steagle act protection in 1993 and we know what happened with
[1:35:53.880 --> 1:35:59.000]  that right it wasn't there ought to be on both sides well yeah here's another example big pharma
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:04.040]  has merged with big tech and so now how are they allowed to control reviews of drug companies they
[1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:08.920]  own yeah with great there's so many ways to skin this cat i would just say one thing with great
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:13.880]  immunity comes great responsibility right that's the bottom line they can't get immunity and not
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:19.240]  having a responsibility to be a fair uh well exactly they wouldn't have gotten away with any of this
[1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:24.680]  if they hadn't grown slowly and been given immunity and but but but now it's easy that the government
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:27.720]  is going to be ruled by big tech or the people are going to take control of the government
[1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:32.680]  and rule big tech we're back with robert barnes david night i'm alex jones this is historic
[1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:38.840]  information we're about to cover as trump finally hallelujah takes on big tech you asked for it
[1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:44.200]  you're good it's a bold move i agree with barnes a seven on a tenth scale this is very well measured
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:52.680]  it took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy
[1:36:52.680 --> 1:36:59.160]  to wear this every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two
[1:36:59.160 --> 1:37:04.680]  months it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:09.960]  for the first world and that the general public is going to go into deep deep debt to the mega banks
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:17.480]  they're not going to have medical ID cards for synoculations we are now in a giant dystopia but
[1:37:17.480 --> 1:37:23.640]  a lot of people are waking up and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny
[1:37:23.640 --> 1:37:28.840]  and we must all rediscover our bill of rights rediscover our constitution and our backbone
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:34.440]  and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say shut your business down shut
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:39.960]  your life down it'll save lives no it's caused millions already starved to death tens of millions
[1:37:39.960 --> 1:37:44.440]  more so the cowards who went along with us with your virtues signaling you have destroyed your
[1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:51.160]  lives and our lives congratulations the panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist
[1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:58.120]  media and the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're already into
[1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:03.560]  the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world but it's critical to understand
[1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:10.520]  that the longer the shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will destroy
[1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:15.160]  decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we've always said it's
[1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:19.640]  important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to
[1:38:19.640 --> 1:38:26.360]  make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this so remember
[1:38:26.360 --> 1:38:32.040]  how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before
[1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:37.720]  they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes it's
[1:38:37.720 --> 1:38:42.840]  dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times
[1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:46.920]  more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:54.920]  what are champions made of here's a man who can show you

[1:40:35.760 --> 1:40:37.400]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[1:40:37.400 --> 1:40:40.200]  We appreciate your support, your financial support,
[1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:41.640]  but it's also supported you and your family
[1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:43.320]  with amazing products that are so good
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:44.240]  for you and your body.
[1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:45.720]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[1:40:45.720 --> 1:40:50.680]  We are all in this together.
[1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:20.800]  I remember about a year ago, Atlantic Monthly put out
[1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:25.000]  by the leftist arm of the CIA said, Trump's a joke.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  He'll never stand up against Ukraine gate.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:28.080]  He's going down.
[1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:34.360]  I remember Brennan and Clapper and all the rest of them
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:37.560]  being up on national TV saying,
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:39.800]  don't worry, he'll be gone in 2017.
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:41.720]  He'll be gone in 2018.
[1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:46.720]  Well now Twitter has little to fear for Trump, Yahoo Finance.
[1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:49.400]  He has nothing he can do.
[1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:53.680]  When they're breaking the basic laws of America,
[1:41:53.680 --> 1:41:56.520]  the basic confines that they're surveilling us,
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:42:00.000]  they're working in concert, they're election meddling,
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:03.040]  they're lying about how they suppress us to Congress.
[1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:06.740]  It's on every front, they believe they were untouchable.
[1:42:06.740 --> 1:42:10.600]  So like a fish on a line, they've run out a thousand feet
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:11.800]  and they're out of line.
[1:42:11.800 --> 1:42:14.440]  So we got to either cut the line and let them win
[1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:16.320]  or they're exhausted, reel them in.
[1:42:17.160 --> 1:42:20.200]  So what is Robert Barnes constitutional lawyer?
[1:42:20.200 --> 1:42:21.720]  What is the historic moment we're at?
[1:42:21.720 --> 1:42:22.840]  Am I wrong or am I right?
[1:42:22.840 --> 1:42:24.960]  And what does Trump need to do right now
[1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:25.920]  on the day of the night?
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:28.000]  Well, it's very equivalent to what the big trust positions
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.360]  were in the late 19th, end of the 19th century
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:31.940]  like the railroads were.
[1:42:31.940 --> 1:42:34.760]  These are companies that have grown up never facing
[1:42:34.760 --> 1:42:36.600]  consequences ever.
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:38.200]  They've never faced any consequences
[1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:39.680]  in the court of public opinion.
[1:42:39.680 --> 1:42:42.400]  Never faced any consequences in the court of law.
[1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:43.960]  And the net effect of that is you're seeing
[1:42:43.960 --> 1:42:45.680]  their arrogance is extraordinary.
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:47.480]  Cause we were talking about it last year
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:49.000]  that the president was sending the message
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:50.640]  that he intended to do this.
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:52.160]  He was starting to accelerate his-
[1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:53.520]  And they're like, you'll never do it.
[1:42:53.520 --> 1:42:54.560]  You'll never do it.
[1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:56.360]  And now when he does do it, what do they do?
[1:42:56.360 --> 1:42:57.360]  They double down today.
[1:42:57.360 --> 1:42:59.440]  Twitter is trying to ban various of his posts
[1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:02.080]  or block them or say even more salacious-
[1:43:02.080 --> 1:43:03.760]  I mean, don't they get where that leads?
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:04.960]  It's like asking for it.
[1:43:04.960 --> 1:43:07.580]  It's because it's a kid who's been completely spoiled,
[1:43:07.580 --> 1:43:08.720]  totally protected.
[1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:10.120]  He's now out on the playground and he thinks
[1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:11.160]  nothing bad's gonna happen
[1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:13.080]  cause mommy's gonna have his back.
[1:43:13.080 --> 1:43:13.920]  Is that my death?
[1:43:13.920 --> 1:43:15.960]  Like a six year old beating up his three year old sister.
[1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:17.240]  He's finally on the playground.
[1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:18.360]  He's always gotten away with it.
[1:43:18.360 --> 1:43:19.960]  He's about to start a fight with the eight year old.
[1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:20.800]  Exactly.
[1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:22.760]  And he thinks because he's never faced consequences before,
[1:43:22.760 --> 1:43:24.680]  he won't face any consequences now.
[1:43:24.680 --> 1:43:26.040]  What you're just talking about,
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:29.080]  one of the most important parts of the executive order
[1:43:29.080 --> 1:43:31.400]  was finally using the federal attorney general
[1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:34.800]  department of justice power with the states to go after-
[1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:36.080]  And you always said that, cord day.
[1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:36.920]  Exactly.
[1:43:36.920 --> 1:43:38.280]  And to go after them in particular
[1:43:38.280 --> 1:43:39.600]  on the fact that they lied.
[1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:42.200]  So what was that meeting last year in Omaha with Barr
[1:43:42.200 --> 1:43:43.680]  and all 50 attorney general?
[1:43:43.680 --> 1:43:44.720]  It was to build this.
[1:43:44.720 --> 1:43:46.320]  And the goal is to go after them,
[1:43:46.320 --> 1:43:48.040]  not just on any trust grounds,
[1:43:48.040 --> 1:43:49.760]  but what I always thought was the best argument,
[1:43:49.760 --> 1:43:52.760]  I initiated this against Twitter two years ago,
[1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:55.160]  was to go after them on consumer protection grounds
[1:43:55.160 --> 1:43:57.300]  because they lied to get their monopoly power.
[1:43:57.300 --> 1:43:58.140]  Exactly.
[1:43:58.140 --> 1:43:58.980]  It was false advertising.
[1:43:58.980 --> 1:43:59.820]  Exactly.
[1:43:59.820 --> 1:44:00.640]  They promised everybody.
[1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:01.840]  Everybody used their advertising money
[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:03.680]  to promote Twitter, Facebook, Google.
[1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:04.600]  I mean, we did as well.
[1:44:04.600 --> 1:44:05.440]  We spent millions.
[1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:06.840]  I probably spent 20 million.
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:07.880]  People go, oh, you make all this money.
[1:44:07.880 --> 1:44:09.280]  Yeah, we spend it to get the word out.
[1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:12.800]  And not only that, you brought millions of people
[1:44:12.800 --> 1:44:14.800]  to those platforms.
[1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:16.640]  How does YouTube get so many people?
[1:44:16.640 --> 1:44:20.000]  Over 10 years, we spent, we looked it up over 20 million.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:21.800]  And they just stole that amount of promotion.
[1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:23.240]  We paid for all of that.
[1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:24.820]  We sent our people there.
[1:44:24.820 --> 1:44:25.660]  Exactly.
[1:44:25.660 --> 1:44:28.600]  And they monetized those individual subscription service.
[1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:30.760]  So they lied to get their monopoly.
[1:44:30.760 --> 1:44:33.200]  They should be, nobody's asking them to be treated
[1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:35.000]  any differently than any other private company.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:36.120]  In fact, it's just the opposite.
[1:44:36.120 --> 1:44:38.560]  They should be treated like every other private company
[1:44:38.560 --> 1:44:39.400]  that lied.
[1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:40.680]  Because when you buy an ad on the phone book,
[1:44:40.680 --> 1:44:42.760]  you buy a phone number, that's yours.
[1:44:42.760 --> 1:44:45.160]  So all these companies, from restaurants, to bars,
[1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:49.800]  to cleaning places, to salons, to clothiers, to farms,
[1:44:49.800 --> 1:44:51.280]  you buy ads, you run them.
[1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:52.920]  You think it's your URL?
[1:44:52.920 --> 1:44:54.720]  They're like, no, it ain't your URL.
[1:44:54.720 --> 1:44:56.160]  We're taking that, David.
[1:44:56.160 --> 1:44:57.000]  That's right.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:44:58.840]  And that's a question I have for you, Robert,
[1:44:58.840 --> 1:45:01.960]  is why didn't they use the FTC, the Federal Trade
[1:45:01.960 --> 1:45:03.640]  Commission, instead of the FCC?
[1:45:03.640 --> 1:45:05.520]  Because we're talking about torches and interference.
[1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:08.080]  We're talking about unfair business practices.
[1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:10.000]  I think he talked about using other agencies.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:11.360]  Yeah, it's a three-fold approach.
[1:45:11.360 --> 1:45:14.440]  So one is they're using the FCC for regulatory purposes
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:15.760]  to change the rules.
[1:45:15.760 --> 1:45:17.320]  They're using the FTC to go after them
[1:45:17.320 --> 1:45:18.760]  on consumer protection issues.
[1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:20.600]  But FTC is technically independent.
[1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:22.240]  So they can't really, the president can't really
[1:45:22.240 --> 1:45:23.720]  require them to take action.
[1:45:23.720 --> 1:45:24.800]  He can only request it.
[1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:26.200]  That's why they went to the third step,
[1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:27.960]  which is to use the US Attorney General
[1:45:27.960 --> 1:45:29.800]  with the state attorney generals, because the states have
[1:45:29.800 --> 1:45:31.240]  much more powerful consumer protection.
[1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:33.480]  And he's green-lighting the state attorney generals
[1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:35.840]  that if you do it the way we want, the feds won't block you.
[1:45:35.840 --> 1:45:37.000]  Oh, and in fact, he's saying to...
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:38.080]  So he's turning the states loose.
[1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:40.600]  In fact, he's ordering it to be done.
[1:45:40.600 --> 1:45:42.840]  So part of the executive order is that the state attorney
[1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:44.240]  generals with the US Attorney General
[1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:45.520]  will use their consumer protection
[1:45:45.520 --> 1:45:48.080]  laws of the states to go after big tech that's
[1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:50.360]  been violating their promises if they keep violating them.
[1:45:50.360 --> 1:45:53.520]  And then Twitter responds by banning a bunch more of his tweets.
[1:45:53.520 --> 1:45:54.200]  Exactly.
[1:45:54.200 --> 1:45:55.600]  Oh, yeah, they're stepping it up.
[1:45:55.600 --> 1:45:57.680]  And I think that's part of their strategy.
[1:45:57.680 --> 1:46:00.360]  I think that's probably the weakest thing about this
[1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:02.320]  is the fact that they're going to say this.
[1:46:02.320 --> 1:46:04.360]  And you know they're going to say this, whether it's true or not.
[1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:05.560]  They're going to say, you're just doing this simply
[1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:07.000]  because you don't like me, right?
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:08.280]  And you've singled me out.
[1:46:08.280 --> 1:46:10.280]  And so I think they're trying to goad him
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:13.480]  into doing that to a greater extent by what they did today
[1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:15.360]  about the tweets about Minneapolis.
[1:46:15.360 --> 1:46:17.440]  Before, they said, well, we're going to fact check you.
[1:46:17.440 --> 1:46:20.400]  Today, what they did was they completely covered it up
[1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:21.560]  and said, this is hateful.
[1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:23.040]  It's provoking violence and so forth.
[1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:24.840]  We'll let you see it in the public interest.
[1:46:24.840 --> 1:46:27.440]  But we're going to completely cover up his tweet.
[1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:30.200]  I think they're trying to poke him into even more things.
[1:46:30.200 --> 1:46:33.000]  But when we talk about this, these two Supreme Court decisions
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:35.120]  that they've got, and they're both unanimous decisions
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:36.480]  and they're fairly recent.
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:38.720]  And this second one that's out of California,
[1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:41.200]  the Pruneyard Shopping Center case, right?
[1:46:41.200 --> 1:46:43.640]  What they're talking about laying the groundwork there,
[1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:47.200]  what the Supreme Court said was that the states must
[1:46:47.200 --> 1:46:49.280]  protect your individual liberties
[1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:51.120]  according to the Constitution, but they can go further.
[1:46:51.120 --> 1:46:54.200]  And that's where I want to shut up next segment.
[1:46:54.200 --> 1:46:55.440]  Like you guys host the next segment.
[1:46:55.440 --> 1:46:57.800]  I'll be in there literally in the Kroger American coffee,
[1:46:57.800 --> 1:46:59.560]  but it's kind of fun for me to bow out sometimes
[1:46:59.560 --> 1:47:00.520]  so I don't interrupt.
[1:47:00.520 --> 1:47:01.720]  Let's go into precedent.
[1:47:01.720 --> 1:47:03.800]  Because I heard him mention a bunch of cases this morning
[1:47:03.800 --> 1:47:05.960]  when I was exercising on the bike trail.
[1:47:05.960 --> 1:47:08.000]  Hacking for like an hour, I was listening to David.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:10.240]  And everything was cases you'd brought up.
[1:47:10.240 --> 1:47:12.600]  And as a layperson, it's like, this is fundamental.
[1:47:12.600 --> 1:47:13.960]  This is decided.
[1:47:13.960 --> 1:47:16.280]  Like we're not like striking out here saying
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:18.240]  what they're doing, they shouldn't be allowed to do.
[1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:22.320]  We know that this is classically fraudulent
[1:47:22.320 --> 1:47:24.360]  what they're doing, but they try to bamboozle
[1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:26.160]  Trump in the media and the culture
[1:47:26.160 --> 1:47:29.520]  that what Trump's doing is outside of regular behavior
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:31.480]  that they could somehow really set a precedent
[1:47:31.480 --> 1:47:32.880]  that this is allowed.
[1:47:32.880 --> 1:47:34.600]  So there's really two different sets of precedents,
[1:47:34.600 --> 1:47:36.600]  ones out of California, and all of these companies,
[1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:38.360]  of course, are based out of California.
[1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:39.960]  So that's the prune yard doctrine
[1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:41.360]  that David was just mentioning.
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:42.840]  And what that is that it says, look,
[1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:47.120]  if you effectively control or monopolize a public square,
[1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:48.880]  then you're under the same requirements
[1:47:48.880 --> 1:47:51.760]  of First Amendment obligations as if a public entity
[1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:53.400]  controlled that public square.
[1:47:53.400 --> 1:47:55.840]  And so prune yard was a private mall
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:47:58.760]  and they said the public parts of the private mall
[1:47:58.760 --> 1:48:02.080]  had become a public square in that local community.
[1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:04.800]  And even though a private mall owned that space,
[1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:07.400]  they could not discriminate on First Amendment grounds
[1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:10.240]  from political activities such as circulating petitions
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:13.200]  or circulating pamphlets inside the public part,
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:16.040]  the public square part of that private mall.
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:17.760]  They could ban it from the retail stores,
[1:48:17.760 --> 1:48:20.040]  but not from the public parts of it.
[1:48:20.040 --> 1:48:21.520]  The U.S. Supreme Court approved
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:24.160]  the California courts ability to do so.
[1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:26.640]  And yesterday that was one of the two decisions
[1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:28.600]  recited by Attorney General Barr
[1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:31.400]  and the president inside their executive order.
[1:48:31.400 --> 1:48:34.080]  Now the U.S. Supreme Court has not gone that far.
[1:48:34.080 --> 1:48:34.920]  Originally they did.
[1:48:34.920 --> 1:48:36.760]  Originally they said if a company town
[1:48:36.760 --> 1:48:38.200]  owned the public square,
[1:48:38.200 --> 1:48:40.480]  then that company town was obligated
[1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:42.600]  to abide by First Amendment obligations.
[1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:44.840]  They were asked to similarly extend the First Amendment
[1:48:44.840 --> 1:48:47.640]  to private monopolies over the public square
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:49.640]  and they backed off from doing so.
[1:48:49.640 --> 1:48:51.120]  Now the question has always been,
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:53.200]  is my view the prune yard doctrine is good doctrine.
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:55.600]  It would not apply to every little mom and pop company.
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:48:57.120]  So you people like Ben and Shapir,
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:48:59.520]  but anybody that sets up their own corporate town
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:00.920]  where it's like a big building
[1:49:00.920 --> 1:49:02.080]  and it's got a big square,
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:04.440]  and it's bringing you in as a human event.
[1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:06.040]  It's a string that attaches to you
[1:49:06.040 --> 1:49:08.560]  if you decide to seek and obtain monopoly power
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:09.880]  over part of the public square.
[1:49:09.880 --> 1:49:10.720]  That's it.
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:12.280]  If you decide to, it would not apply to every little...
[1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:14.120]  If you build a city,
[1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:16.920]  it's got a public square human rights apply.
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:17.760]  Exactly, that's it.
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:19.080]  First Amendment applies if you decide
[1:49:19.080 --> 1:49:20.400]  to control the public square.
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:21.240]  Because we need the public square.
[1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:22.360]  Guys, come back and cover this.
[1:49:22.360 --> 1:49:23.920]  I'm gonna give you both the floor
[1:49:23.920 --> 1:49:25.800]  for at least two segments to take over here.
[1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:27.160]  And I'm gonna be here watching,
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:28.200]  then we'll go on to the next hour
[1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:29.400]  and take calls a lot more.
[1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:32.720]  Don't forget, only reason we're still on air
[1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:34.360]  is because you don't do all your shopping
[1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:36.200]  on Amazon or Walmart or Target.
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:37.480]  I'm not even attacking those formats.
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:40.240]  Just we've got great products, books, films, t-shirts,
[1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:41.840]  water filtration, air filtration,
[1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:44.000]  non-GMI heirloom seeds, survival gear,
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:45.880]  high quality, swarble food, now available.
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:47.600]  You see all this unrest and craziness?
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:49.880]  I told you, it's gonna get crazier in the future.
[1:49:49.880 --> 1:49:52.160]  Prepare for the worst, hope for the best,
[1:49:52.160 --> 1:49:54.200]  but get your products at m4s.com.
[1:49:54.200 --> 1:49:56.280]  Now's the time to swarble food.
[1:49:56.280 --> 1:49:58.000]  This is the end of the big mega sale
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:49:59.280]  that's been going for two weeks.
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:01.240]  And we're still close to selling out everything.
[1:50:01.240 --> 1:50:02.120]  We've already sold out of a bunch.
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:05.800]  I just said 60% off, biggest selling over the year
[1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:07.000]  because things are so crazy.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:08.720]  Supermental vitality, 60% off.
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:10.240]  Knockout, sleep aid, support.
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:11.960]  A lot of these are right at cost, 60% off.
[1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:13.440]  Brain force plus, 60% off.
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:14.880]  Bio-drill, 60% off.
[1:50:14.880 --> 1:50:16.000]  Chill force, 60% off.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:17.760]  Ultimate Creolol, 60% off.

[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:24.880]  DNA force plus, never before, 60% off.
[1:50:24.880 --> 1:50:26.440]  Living defense plus, 60% off.
[1:50:26.440 --> 1:50:29.880]  Turbo force, 10-hour clean energy, 60% off.
[1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:32.160]  And we're running out of M4s Live,
[1:50:32.160 --> 1:50:33.600]  vanilla, coconut, protein bars,
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:36.240]  never done 60% off, real reptile, rubber, plus.
[1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:38.840]  But just to celebrate Trump going after big tech censorship,
[1:50:38.840 --> 1:50:40.120]  all the craziness.
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:41.280]  Just to mark where we're at,
[1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:44.040]  we are doing the biggest sale we've ever done
[1:50:44.040 --> 1:50:46.840]  across the board, but it's a flash sale.
[1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:49.360]  I'm coming up here tomorrow to work all day on films
[1:50:49.360 --> 1:50:51.120]  and reports and the Bill Gates thing
[1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:54.360]  and sites that David's launching and I'm way behind.
[1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:56.080]  Okay, I got my desk is like this.
[1:50:56.080 --> 1:50:57.680]  Think this desk has papers on it?
[1:50:57.680 --> 1:50:59.000]  I'm up here like 12 hours tomorrow
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:01.520]  and you've got my commitment that we're gonna fight hard
[1:51:01.520 --> 1:51:03.680]  for you, you fight hard for us to spread the word,
[1:51:03.680 --> 1:51:05.160]  pray for us and buy the products.
[1:51:05.160 --> 1:51:07.240]  These are great game changing products,
[1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:09.520]  infowarstore.com, get them today.
[1:51:09.520 --> 1:51:11.560]  All right gentlemen, you're gonna take over
[1:51:11.560 --> 1:51:13.640]  the next two segments, straight ahead.
[1:51:13.640 --> 1:51:15.600]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer.
[1:51:15.600 --> 1:51:17.040]  David Knight, they've got their cases,
[1:51:17.040 --> 1:51:18.560]  they've got their case law.
[1:51:18.560 --> 1:51:20.160]  Folks, it's bigger than free speech,
[1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:22.320]  it's bigger than it's about cartels,
[1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:24.440]  surveilling you and controlling what you do
[1:51:24.440 --> 1:51:25.560]  and what you say.
[1:51:25.560 --> 1:51:27.080]  And then we'll look more with both of you gentlemen
[1:51:27.080 --> 1:51:29.120]  when I come back in 15 minutes after I leave,
[1:51:29.120 --> 1:51:31.760]  we're gonna, with both of them, look at the riots,
[1:51:31.760 --> 1:51:33.000]  the next move towards race war
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:34.360]  and how we stop it straight ahead.
[1:51:34.360 --> 1:51:35.200]  Stay with us.
[1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:38.760]  I don't like coming to you every day
[1:51:38.760 --> 1:51:40.800]  on the radio and TV stations that you watch
[1:51:40.800 --> 1:51:42.160]  and listen to a song and telling you
[1:51:42.160 --> 1:51:44.440]  all these horrible things, but you notice
[1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:45.920]  almost everything we've talked about,
[1:51:45.920 --> 1:51:47.800]  horrible, has come true.
[1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:51.600]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[1:51:51.600 --> 1:51:53.960]  It's like telling somebody, if you got a pool,
[1:51:53.960 --> 1:51:56.320]  put a fence around it, if you have little kids,
[1:51:56.320 --> 1:51:57.520]  because even if they're good swimmers,
[1:51:57.520 --> 1:51:59.040]  they can hit their head and drown,
[1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:00.360]  people don't listen, they go out
[1:52:00.360 --> 1:52:02.040]  and their kids dead in the pool.
[1:52:02.040 --> 1:52:03.760]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the death
[1:52:03.760 --> 1:52:06.320]  of the third world and the collapse of the first world.
[1:52:06.320 --> 1:52:09.320]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:12.760]  by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated it.
[1:52:12.760 --> 1:52:15.240]  They admit it's, quote, good to save the earth
[1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:17.120]  and they're teaching us to be more frugal
[1:52:17.120 --> 1:52:19.440]  and they wanna make us poor so they can dictate
[1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:22.720]  our surrender to this post-human technocracy.
[1:52:22.720 --> 1:52:24.640]  I know all this sounds insane.
[1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:26.240]  When I was talking about it 25 years ago,
[1:52:26.240 --> 1:52:30.200]  but now it's public because it's their operations manual.
[1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:32.640]  I wish this wasn't the case, but there really are
[1:52:32.640 --> 1:52:35.640]  evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:37.000]  that we've gotta stop them.
[1:52:39.600 --> 1:52:41.880]  This is the end, my friends.
[1:52:41.880 --> 1:52:44.000]  My only friends, the end.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:46.560]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[1:52:46.560 --> 1:52:48.520]  Of everything that stands the end.
[1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:52.360]  The safety, the delusion.
[1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:54.560]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:52:54.560 --> 1:52:57.640]  because it was only the mirage of safety.
[1:52:57.640 --> 1:53:01.360]  Movies and partying and living like children,
[1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:04.040]  never growing up, never caring about other people.
[1:53:04.040 --> 1:53:07.800]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[1:53:07.800 --> 1:53:08.960]  Just like the history book show,
[1:53:08.960 --> 1:53:10.680]  it's just like the Bible states.
[1:53:10.680 --> 1:53:12.800]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil
[1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:16.720]  turned away from God, they were brought into captivity
[1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:20.120]  because their people sold out to special interest
[1:53:20.120 --> 1:53:23.760]  and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved.
[1:53:23.760 --> 1:53:25.760]  We are repeating that again today.
[1:53:25.760 --> 1:53:28.600]  Compliance and going along with this system
[1:53:28.600 --> 1:53:31.720]  leads to absolute bondage.
[1:53:31.720 --> 1:53:34.400]  Info wars has decided to fight for freedom.
[1:53:34.400 --> 1:53:35.920]  Info wars has had great victory
[1:53:35.920 --> 1:53:38.120]  thanks to your support and your prayers.
[1:53:38.120 --> 1:53:41.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:45.120 --> 1:53:46.120]  All right, we're back.
[1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:48.120]  I'm David Knight and I'm here with Robert Barnes.
[1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:50.120]  And we want to talk a little bit about these cases
[1:53:50.120 --> 1:53:54.120]  that were referenced in President Trump's executive order,
[1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:56.120]  because Robert, you know all about it.
[1:53:56.120 --> 1:53:59.120]  I'm David Knight and I'm here with Robert Barnes.
[1:53:59.120 --> 1:54:01.120]  And we want to talk a little bit about these cases
[1:54:01.120 --> 1:54:04.120]  that were referenced in President Trump's executive order,
[1:54:04.120 --> 1:54:07.120]  because Robert, you know all about it.
[1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:09.120]  You know this backwards and forwards.
[1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:10.120]  I know a little bit about it.
[1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:13.120]  I've done some study after I saw this in the case.
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:16.120]  And of course, there's some others that I'm familiar with,
[1:54:16.120 --> 1:54:18.120]  but the audience doesn't know all the details about this.
[1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:19.120]  So let's talk about these.
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:21.120]  First of all, the first one that he references
[1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:23.120]  is Packingham versus North Carolina.
[1:54:23.120 --> 1:54:25.120]  What do you think is relevant about this?
[1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:27.120]  And again, both of these are unanimous Supreme Court decisions
[1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:28.120]  that they referenced there.
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:29.120]  Yes.
[1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:33.120]  So the North Carolina case reference was the recognition
[1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:38.120]  by the Supreme Court that the digitized public square
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:41.120]  is the modern day public square.
[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:43.120]  And just because it's in the private companies,
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:46.120]  that's a different legal question of what we do about that.
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:48.120]  But it was a recognition that in today's world,
[1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:50.120]  when we first established the First Amendment,
[1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:53.120]  the idea that the public square could be privatized
[1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:54.120]  was simply inconceivable.
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:57.120]  That was not even in their thought process.
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:54:59.120]  The goal was let's make sure that the public square,
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:01.120]  and there literally is a public square
[1:55:01.120 --> 1:55:04.120]  that's popular in the UK and London,
[1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:06.120]  that this whole concept of public square derives from.
[1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:07.120]  Speaker's corner.
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:08.120]  Exactly.
[1:55:08.120 --> 1:55:10.120]  I talked about that this morning at an interesting place.
[1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:12.120]  I don't know if that still holds to that.
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:13.120]  It still does.
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:15.120]  Last time I was there, things were getting a bit dodgy
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:16.120]  with the Muslims.
[1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:18.120]  They weren't too tolerant of speech,
[1:55:18.120 --> 1:55:20.120]  because most of it is religious or political, right?
[1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:21.120]  Exactly.
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:22.120]  Anybody could literally,
[1:55:22.120 --> 1:55:24.120]  that's where the word platform comes from.
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:25.120]  It's online.
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:26.120]  Yeah, still box or whatever.
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:27.120]  Exactly.
[1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:28.120]  In the US, it was a soap box.
[1:55:28.120 --> 1:55:30.120]  There was this little wooden platform you'd step on
[1:55:30.120 --> 1:55:32.120]  and you could just share whatever you wanted to share.
[1:55:32.120 --> 1:55:33.120]  Oh, yeah.
[1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:34.120]  I love it.
[1:55:34.120 --> 1:55:35.120]  Every time I've gone, we go there.
[1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:36.120]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:37.120]  It's fantastic.
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:39.120]  It's one of the fountains of a physical location
[1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:41.120]  that is a fountain of ideas,
[1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:43.120]  of free thought, free speech, free expression.
[1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:46.120]  And it's not just about the person's right to speak.
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:47.120]  Most importantly,
[1:55:47.120 --> 1:55:49.120]  it's about the audience's right to hear.
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:50.120]  That's right.
[1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:51.120]  That's what people forget.
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:52.120]  And they engage them.
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:53.120]  They shout back at them.
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:54.120]  Absolutely.
[1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:55.120]  And so the police will stand there
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:56.120]  just to keep violence from happening.
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:55:57.120]  Exactly.
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:55:59.120]  But you can hackle, you can do this.
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:00.120]  It's all free.
[1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:05.120]  It's meant to be the truest, most honest expression of ideas.
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:06.120]  Yeah.
[1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:09.120]  Because the idea is that ideas themselves need freedom to grow,
[1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:11.120]  need freedom to be nourished,
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:13.120]  need freedom to be able to find themselves,
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:15.120]  to find their truth.
[1:56:15.120 --> 1:56:16.120]  And in that context,
[1:56:16.120 --> 1:56:17.120]  and so that's where it comes from,
[1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:20.120]  and what the Peckingham case recognized is
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:21.120]  that in the modern age,
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:23.120]  the public square is now digitized.
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:26.120]  That very few people go down to the local public park
[1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:28.120]  to do their public discussion debate and dialogue.
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:32.120]  They do it in the digital space of Facebook,
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:35.120]  of Twitter, of YouTube, of Google.
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:38.120]  And the Supreme Court's recognition of that
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:40.120]  was very important because it meant,
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:43.120]  okay, there's now a judicial acknowledgement
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:46.120]  that this digital social media space
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:48.120]  is a digital public square
[1:56:48.120 --> 1:56:51.120]  because from that flows a wide range of legal
[1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:54.120]  and political concepts that are important policy-wise.
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:56.120]  And let's talk about this quote,
[1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:59.120]  the opinion of the court, and again, it was unanimous,
[1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:02.120]  but this was the majority opinion that was the liberals,
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:05.120]  Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan,
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:08.120]  and so they said a fundamental principle of the First Amendment
[1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:10.120]  is that all persons have access to places
[1:57:10.120 --> 1:57:12.120]  where they can speak and listen,
[1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:15.120]  and then after reflection, speak and listen once more.
[1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:17.120]  And if you're prohibiting that,
[1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:20.120]  this guy, as his lawyer pointed out,
[1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:22.120]  he can't even respond to statements
[1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:24.120]  that other people are making about him,
[1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:27.120]  which is basically where we are with Alex Jones now.
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:29.120]  He's been banned off of all these different platforms
[1:57:29.120 --> 1:57:31.120]  and people can trash him.
[1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:33.120]  He's not even allowed to defend himself.
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:36.120]  And so this particular case, this is a guy in North Carolina,
[1:57:36.120 --> 1:57:42.120]  he had been convicted of sex offence with a minor,
[1:57:42.120 --> 1:57:45.120]  and so as part of that North Carolina statute,
[1:57:45.120 --> 1:57:47.120]  they said you cannot get on the internet, period,
[1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:50.120]  to do anything, and they said that's too restrictive,
[1:57:50.120 --> 1:57:52.120]  and that's what the conservatives of the court said.
[1:57:52.120 --> 1:57:55.120]  We'll let them have the right to put some restrictions on,
[1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:57.120]  but certainly not here.
[1:57:57.120 --> 1:57:59.120]  So they had a unanimous opinion,
[1:57:59.120 --> 1:58:01.120]  and it was really about being able
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:03.120]  to get onto that digital public square,
[1:58:03.120 --> 1:58:05.120]  which is why I was kind of surprised
[1:58:05.120 --> 1:58:08.120]  that they didn't tie this back to the 1946 case,
[1:58:08.120 --> 1:58:10.120]  you know, Marsh vs. Alabama,
[1:58:10.120 --> 1:58:13.120]  because that was one where you had a physical public square
[1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:15.120]  that was owned by a company town,
[1:58:15.120 --> 1:58:17.120]  and you've talked about this many times,
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:19.120]  you know, we're getting into this company town aspect of the internet,
[1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:21.120]  so we'll talk about this when we come back,
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:23.120]  and we'll also talk about the other case,
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:27.120]  because actually they had a very good train of argument in this,
[1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:29.120]  and we're going to review that when we come back.
[1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:31.120]  David Knight with Robert Barnes,
[1:58:31.120 --> 1:58:52.120]  this will be right back.
[1:59:32.120 --> 1:59:35.120]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer,
[1:59:35.120 --> 1:59:36.120]  doesn't make them grow,
[1:59:36.120 --> 1:59:37.120]  makes them shrink,
[1:59:37.120 --> 1:59:38.120]  and slow,
[1:59:38.120 --> 1:59:40.120]  which is based on the same thing.
[1:59:40.120 --> 1:59:42.120]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off
[1:59:42.120 --> 1:59:43.120]  for a limited time
[1:59:43.120 --> 1:59:46.120]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:46.120 --> 1:59:53.120]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[1:59:53.120 --> 1:59:56.120]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:06.120 --> 2:00:08.120]  Welcome back, David Knight here with Robert Barnes.
[2:00:08.120 --> 2:00:10.120]  We're going to be joined by Andrew Torba of GAB,
[2:00:10.120 --> 2:00:12.120]  in just a little while here,
[2:00:12.120 --> 2:00:14.120]  but we're talking about the Supreme Court decisions
[2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:18.120]  that were referenced as part of the Trump executive order.
[2:00:18.120 --> 2:00:20.120]  We were talking about the decision
[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:22.120]  that essentially was held three years ago.
[2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:24.120]  The Supreme Court unanimously said
[2:00:24.120 --> 2:00:27.120]  that social media is the digital public square,
[2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:28.120]  and as we're going to break, I said,
[2:00:28.120 --> 2:00:30.120]  I'm kind of surprised I didn't go back
[2:00:30.120 --> 2:00:32.120]  and tie this to the physical public square,
[2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:35.120]  the 1946 case where the Supreme Court there said,
[2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:38.120]  you can't kick a woman out who is handing out flyers,
[2:00:38.120 --> 2:00:40.120]  even though you own the public square,
[2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:41.120]  because it is the public square,
[2:00:41.120 --> 2:00:42.120]  we're not going to let you take away her,
[2:00:42.120 --> 2:00:44.120]  individual rights, and you know, Robert,
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:46.120]  we've gone full circle now to the extent
[2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:48.120]  that if we don't nip this in the bud,
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:50.120]  if we don't understand that government is there
[2:00:50.120 --> 2:00:52.120]  to protect the individual rights,
[2:00:52.120 --> 2:00:54.120]  the God-given rights, the natural rights,
[2:00:54.120 --> 2:00:56.120]  the human rights of us, then we're going to have
[2:00:56.120 --> 2:00:58.120]  these corporations rule us in every regard,
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:01:00.120]  because now we've got Google,
[2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:02.120]  one of the worst of these censors,
[2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:06.120]  is now working on taking over the physical space, right?
[2:01:06.120 --> 2:01:08.120]  They're going from cyberspace to physical space
[2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:10.120]  with their smart cities.
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:12.120]  So this whole thing is going to go full circle
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:13.120]  if we don't nip it in the bud.
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:15.120]  No doubt, and really what they've done
[2:01:15.120 --> 2:01:18.120]  is they've laundered liability and laundered control.
[2:01:18.120 --> 2:01:20.120]  So like, I'll give an example in the nursing home context
[2:01:20.120 --> 2:01:22.120]  happening currently with COVID-19.
[2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:24.120]  What the government does is the government,
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:26.120]  or in the vaccine context, what the government does,
[2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:29.120]  they take some activity they want to occur,
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:31.120]  but don't want to be sued for.
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:34.120]  So they outsource it to either the private nursing homes
[2:01:34.120 --> 2:01:37.120]  in the COVID-19 context to take infected patients
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:41.120]  or to a big pharma to make vaccines.
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:43.120]  And then the government, so that's the first part
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:45.120]  of the laundry, and then that's the activity
[2:01:45.120 --> 2:01:47.120]  that they want to have occur where they want
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:49.120]  the government to not be liable.
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:51.120]  But then they turn around and grant immunity
[2:01:51.120 --> 2:01:54.120]  to a big pharma or immunity to nursing homes
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:01:56.120]  so that now that nobody can sue anybody
[2:01:56.120 --> 2:01:58.120]  for anything that goes wrong.
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:02:01.120]  Well, the same thing is happening now in the big tech context
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:03.120]  where they're effectively, hey, instead of us,
[2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:05.120]  the government owning the public square,
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:07.120]  we're going to allow you big private monopolies
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:10.120]  who effectively, like the big trust of the 19th century
[2:02:10.120 --> 2:02:12.120]  or the big railroads of the 19th century,
[2:02:12.120 --> 2:02:15.120]  we're going to let you control and own the public square,
[2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:17.120]  and then we're going to grant you Section 230 immunity
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:19.120]  so that you can't be held responsible
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:22.120]  like any other private company or private person would.
[2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:24.120]  That's whenever you hear this argument,
[2:02:24.120 --> 2:02:25.120]  oh, these are private companies.
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:27.120]  No, these are private companies that are monopolies,
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:29.120]  and these are private companies that have been
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:31.120]  given special immunities.
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:33.120]  That makes them different and distinct
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:36.120]  from any ordinary mom-and-pop operation,
[2:02:36.120 --> 2:02:38.120]  and that's what distinguishes them.
[2:02:38.120 --> 2:02:40.120]  And this is something that I've seen happen
[2:02:40.120 --> 2:02:42.120]  in the political sphere as well,
[2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:44.120]  because when I was working with a third party
[2:02:44.120 --> 2:02:46.120]  back in North Carolina, we would go the extra mile
[2:02:46.120 --> 2:02:48.120]  to get on the ballot,
[2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:51.120]  and then they would not allow us to participate in the debates
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:53.120]  because they would take the position
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:56.120]  that the people who are controlling the debate were private,
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:02:59.120]  and so those private individuals
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:01.120]  are going to be allowed to restrict
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:03.120]  who they wanted to have in their debate.
[2:03:03.120 --> 2:03:05.120]  We knew that they were operating.
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:07.120]  It was pretty obvious that they were operating
[2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:09.120]  on behalf of the two major parties,
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:11.120]  but they had the pretense that,
[2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:13.120]  no, we're going to, we have the soul,
[2:03:13.120 --> 2:03:15.120]  and of course it was the National Association,
[2:03:15.120 --> 2:03:17.120]  the North Carolina Association of Broadcasters.
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:19.120]  So it's very news people who are now trying to push
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:21.120]  any other viewpoints off of social media
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:23.120]  that were basically pushing off independence.
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:25.120]  Well, they want those monopolies.
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:27.120]  So we've got Andrew Torba coming up with us
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:29.120]  for a couple segments and we'll continue on
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:31.120]  with Robert Barnes and David Knight,
[2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:34.120]  but we've already done the job,
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:36.120]  the listeners have done the job of getting Trump awake,
[2:03:36.120 --> 2:03:38.120]  getting the Justice Department awake,
[2:03:38.120 --> 2:03:40.120]  and so we're kind of analyzing here,
[2:03:40.120 --> 2:03:42.120]  which is good, why they've done wrong,
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:44.120]  and what's happened, but let's talk about this
[2:03:44.120 --> 2:03:46.120]  before we go to Andrew Torba next segment,
[2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:48.120]  the head of GAB, who's been their total attack
[2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:50.120]  for just trying to create an alternative,
[2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:52.120]  which shows these monopolies aren't just like,
[2:03:52.120 --> 2:03:53.120]  oh, do your own thing.
[2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:54.120]  Now, when you do your own thing,
[2:03:54.120 --> 2:03:57.120]  they jealously come after you.
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:03:59.120]  How are they going to strike back
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:01.120]  in their arguments in Yahoo News
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:03.120]  that, oh, don't worry, Trump will do nothing to Twitter,
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:05.120]  nothing to Facebook, nothing to Google?
[2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:07.120]  How do they try to block us?
[2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:09.120]  What do you see in the next 157 days
[2:04:09.120 --> 2:04:12.120]  of this election where they've taken our weakness
[2:04:12.120 --> 2:04:15.120]  as weakness, as they've taken our acquiescence as weakness?
[2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:17.120]  What do you expect about to happen next?
[2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:19.120]  Well, their allies are in the judiciary and the press.
[2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:21.120]  So they'll fight back there first
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:22.120]  and within the legal academy.
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:24.120]  They have co-opted so much.
[2:04:24.120 --> 2:04:27.120]  If you see some professor somewhere on TV
[2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:29.120]  or in the press saying, oh, you can't do this.
[2:04:29.120 --> 2:04:30.120]  This is not legal.
[2:04:30.120 --> 2:04:31.120]  This is a private company.
[2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:33.120]  First of all, it doesn't apply.
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:36.120]  Nine times out of 10, they either receive money.
[2:04:36.120 --> 2:04:37.120]  Their law school receives money.
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:38.120]  Their university receives money.
[2:04:38.120 --> 2:04:41.120]  Or they personally receive money from big tech in some respect.
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:42.120]  A lot of disagree.
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:44.120]  I've never seen a time where they don't.
[2:04:44.120 --> 2:04:46.120]  I think it's 100% of the time.
[2:04:46.120 --> 2:04:47.120]  You may be right.
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:48.120]  So that's the nature of it.
[2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:49.120]  So what you're seeing is people,
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:50.120]  I'll put it this way.
[2:04:50.120 --> 2:04:52.120]  If they haven't yet, they're going to be on the teach soon.
[2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:53.120]  So that's the nature of it.
[2:04:53.120 --> 2:04:54.120]  Exactly.
[2:04:54.120 --> 2:04:55.120]  They're begging to get on the milky.
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:04:56.120]  Exactly.
[2:04:56.120 --> 2:04:57.120]  And that's the nature of it.
[2:04:57.120 --> 2:05:00.120]  So the reality, that's where they're going to resort to.
[2:05:00.120 --> 2:05:02.120]  I think their weakness right now,
[2:05:02.120 --> 2:05:07.120]  and it's also the barrier to being able to make meaningful change quickly,
[2:05:07.120 --> 2:05:09.120]  is their arrogance.
[2:05:09.120 --> 2:05:10.120]  So they're so arrogant,
[2:05:10.120 --> 2:05:11.120]  they don't think any consequences will come.
[2:05:11.120 --> 2:05:14.120]  They've never faced it from the judiciary, from the press.
[2:05:14.120 --> 2:05:16.120]  They haven't faced it really from the political class
[2:05:16.120 --> 2:05:18.120]  who's talked a lot but not done a lot.
[2:05:18.120 --> 2:05:20.120]  And so we're going to see whether that changes.
[2:05:20.120 --> 2:05:22.120]  And so they'll be pushed back on the legislative front
[2:05:22.120 --> 2:05:24.120]  to try to block any legislative changes
[2:05:24.120 --> 2:05:27.120]  that the president's going to push to implement this agenda.
[2:05:27.120 --> 2:05:29.120]  They'll try to fight it on the regulatory arena
[2:05:29.120 --> 2:05:31.120]  with a lot of lobbying money spent in Washington D.C.
[2:05:31.120 --> 2:05:33.120]  They'll launch a counterattack in the press
[2:05:33.120 --> 2:05:34.120]  and with a legal occasion.
[2:05:34.120 --> 2:05:35.120]  No, exactly.
[2:05:35.120 --> 2:05:36.120]  So let me ask this question.
[2:05:36.120 --> 2:05:37.120]  When you're at,
[2:05:37.120 --> 2:05:40.120]  I think the espionage angle of Twitter, Facebook, Google,
[2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:41.120]  working with foreign governments
[2:05:41.120 --> 2:05:43.120]  and taking money from foreign governments
[2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:45.120]  to cover up their crimes,
[2:05:45.120 --> 2:05:50.120]  I think that espionage is the quickest way to just swat team them now.
[2:05:50.120 --> 2:05:51.120]  I think it's bifurcated.
[2:05:51.120 --> 2:05:53.120]  So I think that is the,
[2:05:53.120 --> 2:05:55.120]  I think their most personal exposure
[2:05:55.120 --> 2:05:56.120]  is the criminal exposure
[2:05:56.120 --> 2:05:58.120]  because of their in-depth relationship,
[2:05:58.120 --> 2:06:01.120]  in-bed relationship with the Chai comms in particular.
[2:06:01.120 --> 2:06:03.120]  And that's why the president...
[2:06:03.120 --> 2:06:04.120]  Exactly.
[2:06:04.120 --> 2:06:06.120]  So let's just not, nothing against Barr and all of them,
[2:06:06.120 --> 2:06:09.120]  but we're not in the normal house, normal season here.
[2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:11.120]  We're like literally losing the country, everything.
[2:06:11.120 --> 2:06:13.120]  They're under total war against us.
[2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:14.120]  They're foreign agents.
[2:06:14.120 --> 2:06:15.120]  I mean...
[2:06:15.120 --> 2:06:16.120]  Yes.
[2:06:16.120 --> 2:06:17.120]  There's no doubt.
[2:06:17.120 --> 2:06:19.120]  The irony that someone like General Flynn
[2:06:19.120 --> 2:06:22.120]  gets targeted under the Foreign Agents Registration Act,
[2:06:22.120 --> 2:06:25.120]  but Big Tech is never even looked at when they are by far.
[2:06:25.120 --> 2:06:27.120]  I mean, Big Tech's also facilitated ISIS.
[2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:29.120]  This has been well-known, well-documented.
[2:06:29.120 --> 2:06:32.120]  It's been, they've been sued for it in a wide range of contexts,
[2:06:32.120 --> 2:06:34.120]  got out of it because of Section 230 immunity.
[2:06:34.120 --> 2:06:37.120]  So they've been facilitating a wide range of foreign agency action.
[2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:39.120]  But I think the reason why the president,
[2:06:39.120 --> 2:06:42.120]  even within the executive order, laid out
[2:06:42.120 --> 2:06:45.120]  with the problems with their relationship with the Chai comms,
[2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:46.120]  in particular, the...
[2:06:46.120 --> 2:06:48.120]  He laid out, I've got you by the balls.
[2:06:48.120 --> 2:06:49.120]  Exactly.
[2:06:49.120 --> 2:06:50.120]  Put in there that you've been...
[2:06:50.120 --> 2:06:53.120]  So why did they respond the next day with FU?
[2:06:53.120 --> 2:06:55.120]  Well, I think they're trying to make this...
[2:06:55.120 --> 2:06:58.120]  I think they're trying to goad him into personal attacks
[2:06:58.120 --> 2:07:00.120]  so that they can use that to defend themselves.
[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:02.120]  And I think that's why they stepped up the attacks today.
[2:07:02.120 --> 2:07:06.120]  But, you know, there's another power center in this,
[2:07:06.120 --> 2:07:10.120]  just besides the media, besides the university professors and so forth.
[2:07:10.120 --> 2:07:12.120]  And that is the military industrial complex.
[2:07:12.120 --> 2:07:14.120]  And we have to understand that one of the reasons
[2:07:14.120 --> 2:07:18.120]  why you have these big tech monopolies
[2:07:18.120 --> 2:07:20.120]  and why they've been allowed to run roughshod over people
[2:07:20.120 --> 2:07:22.120]  is because that's what they were created to do.
[2:07:22.120 --> 2:07:24.120]  Once the internet became practical,
[2:07:24.120 --> 2:07:26.120]  you had all these different venture capital firms.
[2:07:26.120 --> 2:07:28.120]  The CIA came out of the closet.
[2:07:28.120 --> 2:07:30.120]  They built the infrastructure that's now being used
[2:07:30.120 --> 2:07:32.120]  for the left, the Chai comms, the controllers.
[2:07:32.120 --> 2:07:34.120]  Yeah, and so they're going to defend that.
[2:07:34.120 --> 2:07:36.120]  There's going to be factions within the government.
[2:07:36.120 --> 2:07:38.120]  Because they're fighting over control of that.
[2:07:38.120 --> 2:07:39.120]  Exactly.
[2:07:39.120 --> 2:07:43.120]  And if we go back and we look at October, November, 2017,
[2:07:43.120 --> 2:07:47.120]  and remember we were pushed off in August of 2018,
[2:07:47.120 --> 2:07:52.120]  but in 2017, November 2017, actually October 2017,
[2:07:52.120 --> 2:07:55.120]  you had Clint Watts, a former U.S. Army officer,
[2:07:55.120 --> 2:07:56.120]  former FBI agent.
[2:07:56.120 --> 2:07:58.120]  He was saying civil wars don't start with gunshots.
[2:07:58.120 --> 2:07:59.120]  They start with words.
[2:07:59.120 --> 2:08:01.120]  America's war with itself has already begun.
[2:08:01.120 --> 2:08:03.120]  We've got to stop false information.
[2:08:03.120 --> 2:08:06.120]  We have to silence the big guns on social media.
[2:08:06.120 --> 2:08:09.120]  And so he's calling for censorship.
[2:08:09.120 --> 2:08:12.120]  And this was after Facebook, Twitter, and others had left.
[2:08:12.120 --> 2:08:14.120]  And he's talking to the Senate.
[2:08:14.120 --> 2:08:16.120]  Nobody, Republican or Democrat, had a problem with that.
[2:08:16.120 --> 2:08:17.120]  Exactly.
[2:08:17.120 --> 2:08:19.120]  They're in there saying silence Alex Jones.
[2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:20.120]  That's right.
[2:08:20.120 --> 2:08:21.120]  We were the test case.
[2:08:21.120 --> 2:08:22.120]  They even set us in the hearings.
[2:08:22.120 --> 2:08:23.120]  Absolutely.
[2:08:23.120 --> 2:08:24.120]  And so that's precisely what they did.
[2:08:24.120 --> 2:08:27.120]  And they want to make sure that they can control the narrative
[2:08:27.120 --> 2:08:28.120]  about all these other issues.
[2:08:28.120 --> 2:08:31.120]  Let me ask this question to both of you when we come back.
[2:08:31.120 --> 2:08:34.120]  What are they going to do now that it's all failed so far?
[2:08:34.120 --> 2:08:35.120]  Because these people don't give up.
[2:08:35.120 --> 2:08:37.120]  They just keep doubling down, doubling down.
[2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:39.120]  What is the doubling down?
[2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:40.120]  Each of you, 20 seconds.
[2:08:40.120 --> 2:08:43.120]  David Knight and Aaron Barnes, how do they strike back?
[2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:47.120]  Well, I think right now they pretty much got us under a lockdown, obviously.
[2:08:47.120 --> 2:08:50.120]  And so all of this stuff, this is something,
[2:08:50.120 --> 2:08:53.120]  this is an argument that frankly we should have had a year ago.
[2:08:53.120 --> 2:08:57.120]  Right now the argument is also what happens with lockdown.
[2:08:57.120 --> 2:09:00.120]  And I think one of the things that President Trump needs to do,
[2:09:00.120 --> 2:09:04.120]  as I said before, besides firing Fauci and Birx,
[2:09:04.120 --> 2:09:06.120]  he needs to come out and have people who've been right about this
[2:09:06.120 --> 2:09:11.120]  from the very beginning, and they need to undo the panic that has been put on.
[2:09:11.120 --> 2:09:12.120]  No, I agree.
[2:09:12.120 --> 2:09:14.120]  He brought up all the real experts, all the real doctors.
[2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:15.120]  Yeah.
[2:09:15.120 --> 2:09:16.120]  And just doubled down and said,
[2:09:16.120 --> 2:09:17.120]  they're the traders or CHOCOM agents.
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:19.120]  They would all be defeated instantly.
[2:09:19.120 --> 2:09:20.120]  Yeah.
[2:09:20.120 --> 2:09:23.120]  And the other thing he could do is use his power and go to another platform
[2:09:23.120 --> 2:09:25.120]  like GAB or something like that, or create one himself.
[2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:26.120]  All right, Robert Barnes, stay there.
[2:09:26.120 --> 2:09:27.120]  He'll come back with your response.
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:28.120]  The other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[2:09:28.120 --> 2:09:31.120]  And we've got Mr. Torba of GAB straight ahead.
[2:09:31.120 --> 2:09:32.120]  On the other side, we appreciate him.
[2:09:32.120 --> 2:09:34.120]  Wow, what a time to be alive.
[2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:36.120]  This is a very exciting time.
[2:09:36.120 --> 2:09:37.120]  Make no mistake.
[2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:39.120]  And we're here on air despite all their attacks.
[2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:40.120]  Thanks to you.
[2:09:40.120 --> 2:09:41.120]  Thanks to you.
[2:09:44.120 --> 2:09:45.120]  Now it's official.
[2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:48.120]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said,
[2:09:48.120 --> 2:09:51.120]  the COVID emergency will last five years.
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:53.120]  And the UK government said,
[2:09:53.120 --> 2:09:56.120]  you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested
[2:09:56.120 --> 2:09:59.120]  because we have to track your social distancing.
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:03.120]  And you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit.
[2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:05.120]  And if you go outside that list of 10,
[2:10:05.120 --> 2:10:07.120]  you'll be permanently detained.
[2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:10.120]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order
[2:10:10.120 --> 2:10:13.120]  where they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists,
[2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:15.120]  the child molesters, the murderers,
[2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:19.120]  and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[2:10:19.120 --> 2:10:21.120]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear
[2:10:21.120 --> 2:10:24.120]  the globalists are an authoritarian anti-human group.
[2:10:24.120 --> 2:10:27.120]  They have to put this electronic straightjacket on us
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:29.120]  before they carry out their end game,
[2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:31.120]  which is global depopulation.
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:35.120]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[2:10:35.120 --> 2:10:39.120]  The only way to stop them is to expose them to hate their guts
[2:10:39.120 --> 2:10:42.120]  and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy.
[2:10:42.120 --> 2:11:02.120]  Wake up or die.
[2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:16.120]  Wake up at 8 a.m. ready to go.
[2:11:16.120 --> 2:11:18.120]  It really has made a difference in my life
[2:11:18.120 --> 2:11:20.120]  and it can make a difference in your life too.
[2:11:20.120 --> 2:11:22.120]  If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch.
[2:11:22.120 --> 2:11:24.120]  If you get great sleep, you're going to be on point.
[2:11:24.120 --> 2:11:26.120]  You're going to be mentally focused.
[2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:28.120]  You're going to be ready to take on the day.
[2:11:28.120 --> 2:11:30.120]  And right now, knockout is 50% off.
[2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:32.120]  It's less than $15 a bottle.
[2:11:32.120 --> 2:11:34.120]  You get 30 capsules. Give it a try today.
[2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:36.120]  It's at a great price right now
[2:11:36.120 --> 2:11:38.120]  and it can really help you get the sleep you need,
[2:11:38.120 --> 2:11:40.120]  especially in these tough times.
[2:11:40.120 --> 2:11:46.120]  It's knockout and it's available at infowarstore.com.
[2:11:46.120 --> 2:12:12.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:16.120]  It's been five years ago to protect the fledgling industry.
[2:12:16.120 --> 2:12:20.120]  And its purpose was to allow websites that were serving
[2:12:20.120 --> 2:12:25.120]  as essentially bulletin boards for diverse third-party content
[2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:28.120]  coming on to say that you're not responsible
[2:12:28.120 --> 2:12:32.120]  for the content of that third-party information.
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:34.120]  Now it's been completely stretched
[2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:37.120]  to allow what have become really Bohemiths
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:41.120]  who control a lot of the flow of information in our society
[2:12:41.120 --> 2:12:43.120]  and censorship of that information
[2:12:43.120 --> 2:12:49.120]  and to act as editors and publishers of the material.
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:51.120]  So when they put on their own content,
[2:12:51.120 --> 2:12:56.120]  like fact-check content onto other people's content,
[2:12:56.120 --> 2:12:58.120]  and when they curate their collection...
[2:12:58.120 --> 2:13:01.120]  How did you decide to ban Alex Jones?
[2:13:01.120 --> 2:13:03.120]  What users want from us
[2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:07.120]  and what we've always provided them is a curated fund.
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:09.120]  We think that what the user wants
[2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:12.120]  is someone that does review these apps,
[2:13:12.120 --> 2:13:16.120]  someone that does review the podcasts,
[2:13:16.120 --> 2:13:20.120]  someone that on Apple News where a human
[2:13:20.120 --> 2:13:22.120]  is selecting the top stores.
[2:13:22.120 --> 2:13:24.120]  And that's what we do.
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:26.120]  We don't take a political stand.
[2:13:26.120 --> 2:13:28.120]  We're not leaning one way or the other.
[2:13:28.120 --> 2:13:32.120]  You can tell that from the stuff on the app store
[2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:34.120]  and in podcasts, etc.
[2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:38.120]  You'll see everything from very conservative to very liberal.
[2:13:38.120 --> 2:13:40.120]  That's the way I think it should be.
[2:13:40.120 --> 2:13:41.120]  What point were you like,
[2:13:41.120 --> 2:13:43.120]  okay, that's it, Alex Jones has to go?
[2:13:43.120 --> 2:13:46.120]  You know, we get into a singular kind of event,
[2:13:46.120 --> 2:13:51.120]  but I think there's enough there that reasonable people...
[2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:53.120]  Chinese life camps are on?
[2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:55.120]  Millions of death camps?
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:13:57.120]  That should be all.
[2:13:57.120 --> 2:14:02.120]  And when they start censoring particular content,
[2:14:02.120 --> 2:14:06.120]  including in many cases the direction of foreign governments
[2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:09.120]  to come in as China, they become publishers
[2:14:09.120 --> 2:14:12.120]  and they shouldn't be entitled to the same kind of shield
[2:14:12.120 --> 2:14:15.120]  that was set up earlier.
[2:14:15.120 --> 2:14:16.120]  We haven't played this yet.
[2:14:16.120 --> 2:14:17.120]  We'll play it next segment.
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:19.120]  Andrew Torba is with us for two segments.
[2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:21.120]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is here,
[2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:23.120]  engineer and researcher and enforce House David Knight.
[2:14:23.120 --> 2:14:27.120]  But we have Joe Biden pledging allegiance to come
[2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:29.120]  in as China on video coming up.
[2:14:29.120 --> 2:14:31.120]  Andrew Torba heads up GAB.
[2:14:31.120 --> 2:14:32.120]  They've tried to shut him down.
[2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:34.120]  They've demonized this great patriot
[2:14:34.120 --> 2:14:36.120]  and he's here to watch Trump finally beginning to take action.
[2:14:36.120 --> 2:14:38.120]  I've had a lot of legal scholars I weighed in with
[2:14:38.120 --> 2:14:39.120]  on the phone and in person.
[2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:41.120]  They say this is a very strong move by Trump.
[2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:43.120]  What do you think?
[2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:45.120]  I actually totally disagree, Alex.
[2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:49.120]  Section 230 not only protects, yes, big tech,
[2:14:49.120 --> 2:14:52.120]  but it also protects companies like ours, right?
[2:14:52.120 --> 2:14:55.120]  It allows us to compete against these people.
[2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:57.120]  More regulation is not the answer.
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:00.120]  The free market is providing and GAB is proof of that.
[2:15:00.120 --> 2:15:05.120]  Over the past 48 hours, we've added 150,000 new people to the site.
[2:15:05.120 --> 2:15:08.120]  We're exploding in growth right now because people are sick of it.
[2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:09.120]  No, that's beautiful.
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:10.120]  So correct me if I'm wrong.
[2:15:10.120 --> 2:15:15.120]  Is it Trump talking about Section 230 on a case by case being stripped?
[2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:20.120]  Yes, but I think focusing on that in general is the wrong approach.
[2:15:20.120 --> 2:15:22.120]  Section 230 not only protects the companies.
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:24.120]  It protects small website owners.
[2:15:24.120 --> 2:15:27.120]  It protects your own website with a comment section, for example.
[2:15:27.120 --> 2:15:31.120]  Andrew, I totally agree with you. You're a smart guy, smarter than I am when it comes to tech stuff.
[2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:34.120]  But this is what they're using to play both sides.
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:36.120]  So that's the enacting power.
[2:15:36.120 --> 2:15:39.120]  Well, I mean, we'll explain what the president should do then.
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:41.120]  Well, the president should get on GAB, Alex.
[2:15:41.120 --> 2:15:42.120]  It's that simple.
[2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:43.120]  He should get on GAB.
[2:15:43.120 --> 2:15:44.120]  He should get on Parlers.
[2:15:44.120 --> 2:15:45.120]  He should get on Minds.
[2:15:45.120 --> 2:15:46.120]  He should get on Bitchu.
[2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:50.120]  With one tweet, he could turn the entire tech media landscape on its head.
[2:15:50.120 --> 2:15:52.120]  And I know, of course, I'm biased, right?
[2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:53.120]  No, no, I hear you.
[2:15:53.120 --> 2:15:55.120]  No, I think you're actually right that his bully pulpit.
[2:15:55.120 --> 2:15:58.120]  If Trump created his own Twitter, it would be huge.
[2:15:58.120 --> 2:15:59.120]  Barnes?
[2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:00.120]  Yeah, I mean, I think the...
[2:16:00.120 --> 2:16:03.120]  Well, I think as to that question as to how to protect small companies,
[2:16:03.120 --> 2:16:07.120]  it would have been good, I think, if there would have been one additional component in the executive order,
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:12.120]  which is simply to separate out those big tech companies that have a certain high,
[2:16:12.120 --> 2:16:14.120]  what's called a monopolistic market share, which...
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:16.120]  Yeah, those that have monopolies may lose 230.
[2:16:16.120 --> 2:16:18.120]  And that's 75% or more of the market.
[2:16:18.120 --> 2:16:19.120]  Go ahead, Alex.
[2:16:19.120 --> 2:16:20.120]  Exactly.
[2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:22.120]  That was my problem with the EO, right?
[2:16:22.120 --> 2:16:26.120]  My problem with the EO was there was no protection for companies like Gab, like Bitchu.
[2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:29.120]  So the EO should have said something like, you know,
[2:16:29.120 --> 2:16:34.120]  you have to have over 100 million users in order for this type of action to be taken or this type of...
[2:16:34.120 --> 2:16:40.120]  Because if regulation comes down, right, how are they going to determine that a website is being held politically neutral, right?
[2:16:40.120 --> 2:16:41.120]  We're going to have to have lawyers.
[2:16:41.120 --> 2:16:43.120]  We're going to have to have probably third-party auditors.
[2:16:43.120 --> 2:16:49.120]  How are they going to actually police this and make sure that the tech companies are being politically neutral?
[2:16:49.120 --> 2:16:50.120]  I don't see how they accomplish that.
[2:16:50.120 --> 2:16:52.120]  I don't see how a small company like us, especially...
[2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:56.120]  But listen, this is why Trump hasn't taken action, is that it's a whole gray area.
[2:16:56.120 --> 2:16:59.120]  The point is, he's clearly declaring war on big tech, though.
[2:16:59.120 --> 2:17:04.120]  I mean, I get the legislative thing going to be turned around against you, but I think overall this is positive.
[2:17:04.120 --> 2:17:06.120]  Yeah, why can't they just be neutral?
[2:17:06.120 --> 2:17:10.120]  Why can't they just allow people to speak like they do at Speaker's Corner like we were talking about?
[2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:14.120]  I mean, what we're talking about here is when they start censoring and controlling speech.
[2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:17.120]  If they're going to have immunity, they need to be neutral.
[2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:21.120]  Well, we know through corporate power who's exercising power.
[2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:23.120]  So we're all being censored already.
[2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:24.120]  So I know, I agree with Torba.
[2:17:24.120 --> 2:17:26.120]  You can look at what Trump's doing and say, it's not going to be perfect.
[2:17:26.120 --> 2:17:27.120]  Well, this is just the beginning.
[2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:31.120]  Well, I think, to Torba's point, there is a way to protect small entities,
[2:17:31.120 --> 2:17:35.120]  aside from requiring the monopoly component, which they can add in the process.
[2:17:35.120 --> 2:17:41.120]  The second is that what Trump is asking is the FCC to have any tech company propose rules
[2:17:41.120 --> 2:17:46.120]  for how they regulate their process that include due process and viewpoint neutrality.
[2:17:46.120 --> 2:17:50.120]  And the idea is that in the way they exercise editorial privileges,
[2:17:50.120 --> 2:17:53.120]  and you can correct me if I'm wrong, GAB doesn't do editorial privileges
[2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:56.120]  outside of the Good Samaritan provisions of Section 230.
[2:17:56.120 --> 2:17:57.120]  Is that right?
[2:17:57.120 --> 2:17:58.120]  Right, correct.
[2:17:58.120 --> 2:18:02.120]  We only remove illegal content, threats of violence, child pornography, etc.
[2:18:02.120 --> 2:18:05.120]  But what I'm saying is we've been asking Trump to take action.
[2:18:05.120 --> 2:18:06.120]  They believed he was paralyzed.
[2:18:06.120 --> 2:18:09.120]  It's positive that the Godzilla is moving.
[2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:10.120]  I agree entirely.
[2:18:10.120 --> 2:18:14.120]  I understand the concern of the small companies is that they don't want to get caught up
[2:18:14.120 --> 2:18:15.120]  in something that's supposed to target the tech.
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:16.120]  And you're right.
[2:18:16.120 --> 2:18:18.120]  The Google lobbyists will write it where GAB gets shut down and they don't.
[2:18:18.120 --> 2:18:19.120]  Right.
[2:18:19.120 --> 2:18:21.120]  The risk of regulatory capture is a problem.
[2:18:21.120 --> 2:18:23.120]  Believe me, though, they're crapping bricks right now.
[2:18:23.120 --> 2:18:27.120]  This is just, believe me, it's going to get sussed out.
[2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:28.120]  Alex, you're right.
[2:18:28.120 --> 2:18:30.120]  You know, something's being done, right?
[2:18:30.120 --> 2:18:31.120]  This is fantastic news.
[2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:34.120]  After five years of this stuff happening that we've all experienced,
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:38.120]  you know, InfoWars and GAB in particular, something is finally being done.
[2:18:38.120 --> 2:18:39.120]  He's talking about this issue.
[2:18:39.120 --> 2:18:41.120]  He's taking action on this issue.
[2:18:41.120 --> 2:18:42.120]  That is a good thing.
[2:18:42.120 --> 2:18:47.120]  But what nobody's really talking about is the App Store duopoly because Apple and Google
[2:18:47.120 --> 2:18:52.120]  control 98% of the mobile app hardware and software distribution market.
[2:18:52.120 --> 2:18:53.120]  No, you're right.
[2:18:53.120 --> 2:18:54.120]  It's the app entrance point.
[2:18:54.120 --> 2:18:58.120]  And I think that's the antitrust angle that's coming down the pipeline.
[2:18:58.120 --> 2:18:59.120]  At least I hope so.
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:01.120]  Can you explain how that's an antitrust?
[2:19:01.120 --> 2:19:03.120]  Because they should give access to any legal app.
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:04.120]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:19:04.120 --> 2:19:07.120]  And they're politically discriminating and market discrimination.
[2:19:07.120 --> 2:19:08.120]  They're curating.
[2:19:08.120 --> 2:19:09.120]  Yes.
[2:19:09.120 --> 2:19:11.120]  Yes, curating indeed.
[2:19:11.120 --> 2:19:15.120]  It's like someone who's stolen all the art, putting up at something in an art show.
[2:19:15.120 --> 2:19:23.120]  But Andrew, can you explain how it impacts GAB and the ability of what GAB can do by
[2:19:23.120 --> 2:19:27.120]  this antitrust app monopoly, duopoly that's taking place?
[2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:28.120]  Right.
[2:19:28.120 --> 2:19:33.120]  So Apple and Google, like I said, they control 98% of the mobile app store distribution.
[2:19:33.120 --> 2:19:35.120]  It's 100% a duopoly.
[2:19:35.120 --> 2:19:36.120]  There's no question about it.
[2:19:36.120 --> 2:19:42.120]  And not only are they preventing apps like GAB, Bichute, others from submitting apps into
[2:19:42.120 --> 2:19:47.120]  the app stores, but they're also propping up their own apps ahead of other competitors.
[2:19:47.120 --> 2:19:51.120]  So for example, they prop up their Apple Music app ahead of Spotify and other music services.
[2:19:51.120 --> 2:19:55.120]  And actually the New York Times, I'm not a big fan of them, but they did an excellent
[2:19:55.120 --> 2:19:59.120]  report on this where they highlighted all of the competitors that Apple pushes down in
[2:19:59.120 --> 2:20:02.120]  the search results in favor of their own apps.
[2:20:02.120 --> 2:20:04.120]  This is anti-competitive behavior.
[2:20:04.120 --> 2:20:07.120]  This is where the DRG needs to focus.
[2:20:07.120 --> 2:20:09.120]  Yeah, no doubt about it.
[2:20:09.120 --> 2:20:12.120]  And my understanding is these are not exclusionary options.
[2:20:12.120 --> 2:20:16.120]  What I like the most is that GAB has actually kept its promises.
[2:20:16.120 --> 2:20:20.120]  Big Tech has not, and that's why Big Tech can be sued by state attorney generals with
[2:20:20.120 --> 2:20:21.120]  the attorney general.
[2:20:21.120 --> 2:20:25.120]  That's the best part of this order is let's use consumer protection to go after these
[2:20:25.120 --> 2:20:30.120]  fraudsters and liars that Big Tech has been to get an economic advantage and edge over
[2:20:30.120 --> 2:20:32.120]  companies like GAB and free up a free market.
[2:20:32.120 --> 2:20:35.120]  Look at this down. This isn't just like your power company, okay?
[2:20:35.120 --> 2:20:36.120]  This is everything.
[2:20:36.120 --> 2:20:38.120]  And so Big Tech's the whole future.
[2:20:38.120 --> 2:20:42.120]  So the debate about Big Tech is the debate about the whole architecture of humanity going
[2:20:42.120 --> 2:20:43.120]  forward. We'll be right back.
[2:20:43.120 --> 2:20:47.120]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over
[2:20:47.120 --> 2:20:50.120]  four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[2:20:50.120 --> 2:20:53.120]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast.
[2:20:53.120 --> 2:20:56.120]  And I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[2:20:56.120 --> 2:20:58.120]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[2:20:58.120 --> 2:21:03.120]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital. I went in the VA hospital out here in Boyce,
[2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:04.120]  and I was in there until June.
[2:21:04.120 --> 2:21:09.120]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to Info Wars three
[2:21:09.120 --> 2:21:13.120]  hours a day, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about Living Defense.
[2:21:13.120 --> 2:21:14.120]  Let me tell you something, man.
[2:21:14.120 --> 2:21:19.120]  I had an internal digestive problem, and I stuck with it for about five or six years,
[2:21:19.120 --> 2:21:21.120]  and the doctors, they tried every test.
[2:21:21.120 --> 2:21:23.120]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[2:21:23.120 --> 2:21:26.120]  And then every day, when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[2:21:26.120 --> 2:21:29.120]  you know what? I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:32.120]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have a stuff,
[2:21:32.120 --> 2:21:34.120]  but I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[2:21:34.120 --> 2:21:37.120]  I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man.
[2:21:37.120 --> 2:21:40.120]  That stuff changed my life. It saved my life.
[2:21:40.120 --> 2:21:43.120]  Alex Jones and Info Wars saved my life.
[2:21:43.120 --> 2:21:49.120]  Info Wars has become a symbol, an emblem of not just American freedom, but worldwide
[2:21:49.120 --> 2:21:50.120]  Maverick spirit.
[2:21:50.120 --> 2:21:55.120]  It's not just myself or the host at Info Wars or the researchers or the journalists.
[2:21:55.120 --> 2:22:00.120]  It's you, the listeners, the activists, the people on the front lines in the arena.
[2:22:00.120 --> 2:22:06.120]  And it's the amazing guests and individuals that we interviewed that make Info Wars so special
[2:22:06.120 --> 2:22:09.120]  because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds.
[2:22:09.120 --> 2:22:14.120]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world, not the establishment
[2:22:14.120 --> 2:22:18.120]  of talking points that are put out by the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group,
[2:22:18.120 --> 2:22:20.120]  Davos Group, and other globalists.
[2:22:20.120 --> 2:22:25.120]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond
[2:22:25.120 --> 2:22:28.120]  based on humans, for humans, by humans.
[2:22:28.120 --> 2:22:33.120]  Not a world where the establishment hate themselves, project their hate onto us,
[2:22:33.120 --> 2:22:36.120]  and decide we're going to have a post-human world.
[2:22:36.120 --> 2:22:39.120]  I'm really excited to know that Info Wars has your support,
[2:22:39.120 --> 2:22:42.120]  and I want to thank you all for being pro-human and pro-God.
[2:22:45.120 --> 2:22:47.120]  We're living in insanely dangerous times,
[2:22:47.120 --> 2:22:51.120]  and I've told folks going back three months ago, I'm not buying storeable food
[2:22:51.120 --> 2:22:53.120]  because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[2:22:53.120 --> 2:22:56.120]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse,
[2:22:56.120 --> 2:23:00.120]  and now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages
[2:23:00.120 --> 2:23:03.120]  and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States,
[2:23:03.120 --> 2:23:05.120]  and it's even worse in the third world.
[2:23:05.120 --> 2:23:08.120]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it,
[2:23:08.120 --> 2:23:13.120]  but with the election fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing
[2:23:13.120 --> 2:23:16.120]  and everything else that's going on, now is the time to get storeable foods.
[2:23:16.120 --> 2:23:20.120]  Because they'll last for 25 years, they're in easily totable bags,
[2:23:20.120 --> 2:23:24.120]  it's high quality food, and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready.
[2:23:24.120 --> 2:23:26.120]  And it funds the Info Wars, so we have storeable food available again.
[2:23:26.120 --> 2:23:31.120]  InfoWarsTour.com are called toll free, triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:23:31.120 --> 2:23:35.120]  Whatever you do, get prepared and get ready, because the globalists want you dependent on them.
[2:23:35.120 --> 2:23:37.120]  They do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[2:23:37.120 --> 2:23:46.120]  Get your storeable food at InfoWarsTour.com right now while you still can.
[2:23:46.120 --> 2:23:54.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:23:54.120 --> 2:24:08.120]  Andrew Torb is our guest, I'm Alex Jones.
[2:24:08.120 --> 2:24:13.120]  And look, I can sit here and academically look at what Trump's doing.
[2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:16.120]  I can look at what's happening with the riots in Minnesota.
[2:24:16.120 --> 2:24:22.120]  But when you pull back from it, the Communist Chinese are threatening to attack Taiwan right now.
[2:24:22.120 --> 2:24:24.120]  They're threatening to invade Hong Kong.
[2:24:24.120 --> 2:24:27.120]  You've got all hell breaking loose.
[2:24:27.120 --> 2:24:29.120]  So let me ask Andrew Torb.
[2:24:29.120 --> 2:24:31.120]  Let me ask David Knight and Robert Barnes.
[2:24:31.120 --> 2:24:34.120]  Real politic, these Henry Kisses are your term.
[2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:37.120]  Where is the world right now separate from our political views and what we want?
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:39.120]  Who are the players?
[2:24:39.120 --> 2:24:40.120]  What are the factors?
[2:24:40.120 --> 2:24:45.120]  And Andrew Torb, why shouldn't we want the Communist Chinese to run things?
[2:24:45.120 --> 2:24:50.120]  Well, Alex, as a Christian, I certainly don't want the Communist Chinese to run things.
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:53.120]  Christians are not treated too hot over there.
[2:24:53.120 --> 2:24:57.120]  Listen, you know, they're subverting these big tech companies and, you know,
[2:24:57.120 --> 2:25:01.120]  these American companies are bending over backwards to appease these Communist Chinese.
[2:25:01.120 --> 2:25:02.120]  No, exactly.
[2:25:02.120 --> 2:25:05.120]  Congress, the intelligence agencies act like if it's Chinese, it doesn't exist.
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:07.120]  It's like, oh, the Chinese are taking over.
[2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:09.120]  Well, that's fine because they're Chinese, exactly.
[2:25:09.120 --> 2:25:11.120]  I mean, if I tried this, I'd be killed.
[2:25:11.120 --> 2:25:17.120]  But it's like, so where did the green light become that if it's Chai Comm, we're just supposed to bend over?
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:20.120]  I guess it's about money, Alex, like everything else is about money.
[2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:21.120]  It's about power.
[2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:22.120]  It's about who's paying who.
[2:25:22.120 --> 2:25:24.120]  If you follow the money, I'm sure we can find the answer.
[2:25:24.120 --> 2:25:30.120]  Really, what I'm most concerned about is these apps like TikTok, you know, Chinese controlled.
[2:25:30.120 --> 2:25:32.120]  Yeah, you were getting into the app monopolies.
[2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:33.120]  Let's talk about that because you're right.
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:37.120]  They're trying to make the whole web about accessibility on a phone via an app.
[2:25:37.120 --> 2:25:40.120]  And then that's really where they're building the false paradigm.
[2:25:40.120 --> 2:25:41.120]  Right.
[2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:43.120]  It's a delusion of choice, Alex.
[2:25:43.120 --> 2:25:45.120]  And this is what it's been for the past decade.
[2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:48.120]  We have the top 20 apps in the app store controlled by about three companies.
[2:25:48.120 --> 2:25:49.120]  Right.
[2:25:49.120 --> 2:25:50.120]  So there really is no choice.
[2:25:50.120 --> 2:25:51.120]  And they're all in Silicon Valley.
[2:25:51.120 --> 2:25:55.120]  And when info was the number one news was going to number one period, they banned it.
[2:25:55.120 --> 2:25:56.120]  Yep.
[2:25:56.120 --> 2:25:57.120]  Same here.
[2:25:57.120 --> 2:25:59.120]  Gab wants the number one on the Google Play Store.
[2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:01.120]  And the second that happened, we were banned.
[2:26:01.120 --> 2:26:02.120]  Right.
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:03.120]  And they allow.
[2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:04.120]  Oh, it's about choice though.
[2:26:04.120 --> 2:26:05.120]  No, it's not about that.
[2:26:05.120 --> 2:26:06.120]  Is it?
[2:26:06.120 --> 2:26:07.120]  No, absolutely not.
[2:26:07.120 --> 2:26:11.120]  I mean, you see them censoring the president's tweet this morning, the same tweet from the
[2:26:11.120 --> 2:26:14.120]  actual White House account, which is absolutely incredible.
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:19.120]  And at the same time, you see, you know, dozens and dozens of people calling for violence,
[2:26:19.120 --> 2:26:22.120]  calling to burn down the country, calling to kill cops on Twitter.
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:24.120]  And Twitter does absolutely nothing about it.
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:25.120]  So there's this double standard.
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:26.120]  There's this hypocrisy.
[2:26:26.120 --> 2:26:27.120]  Well, it's more than that.
[2:26:27.120 --> 2:26:33.120]  It's an informational human control arm where we don't allow people that don't want death
[2:26:33.120 --> 2:26:34.120]  to have a speech.
[2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:36.120]  Those that do want we allow to have speech.
[2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:38.120]  It is a giant criminal coup.
[2:26:38.120 --> 2:26:43.120]  It is a big tech coup over information over human can make human communication.
[2:26:43.120 --> 2:26:47.120]  I mean, it is a giant informational takeover.
[2:26:47.120 --> 2:26:52.120]  David, you know, Alex, right after you were kicked off of all the social media places
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:56.120]  and you went to the hearings that they had and Marco Rubio was there and Rubio said,
[2:26:56.120 --> 2:26:58.120]  I don't know who you are, right?
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:26:59.120]  Later he admitted he did.
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:03.120]  The only thing he was concerned about, I mean, here they're going to have free speech hearings
[2:27:03.120 --> 2:27:08.120]  and they've got the highest profile individual in the world who's been kicked off just happened
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:10.120]  and he pretends he doesn't know anything about that.
[2:27:10.120 --> 2:27:14.120]  So what he said in the hearings was he was only asked these people, Facebook, Twitter,
[2:27:14.120 --> 2:27:15.120]  and so forth.
[2:27:15.120 --> 2:27:18.120]  Now, if the Chinese government does X, you're going to stop that, right?
[2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:20.120]  And that's really the issue.
[2:27:20.120 --> 2:27:25.120]  As Robert Barnes was saying, they've gotten so arrogant now that they are allowing the
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:30.120]  Chinese to essentially they're playing ball for the Chinese.
[2:27:30.120 --> 2:27:33.120]  The military industrial complex set these guys up.
[2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:36.120]  The military industrial complex was behind a lot of the censorship.
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:42.120]  Two months after they moved against Info Wars, they took out our intelligence agencies backing
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:43.120]  China and not Americans.
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:46.120]  Well, I think this is going to be an internal struggle with them.
[2:27:46.120 --> 2:27:50.120]  And I think when you look at what's happening, you look at the struggle with 5G, for example, right?
[2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:54.120]  Both the American government and the Chinese government want 5G.
[2:27:54.120 --> 2:27:56.120]  They don't care about our privacy.
[2:27:56.120 --> 2:27:58.120]  They don't care about our health.
[2:27:58.120 --> 2:28:00.120]  They just want to be the ones who are in control.
[2:28:00.120 --> 2:28:05.120]  And so you've got this competition that's going on between China and between a lot of elements
[2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:07.120]  in the military industrial complex.
[2:28:07.120 --> 2:28:11.120]  And as you're pointing out, they're moving against Hong Kong, against Taiwan, also in India,
[2:28:11.120 --> 2:28:13.120]  also in the South China Sea.
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:17.120]  The question is, where are they going to have a hot war first in terms of their aggression?
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:21.120]  And these people in Hong Kong are calling them not Chai Khoms.
[2:28:21.120 --> 2:28:27.120]  They're calling them Nazis because they truly are fascist, hypernationalists who are anxious
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:30.120]  to have an expansive war in many different areas.
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:31.120]  No, that's right.
[2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:34.120]  So Andrew Torba, what would you call this climate we're in right now?
[2:28:34.120 --> 2:28:37.120]  Revolution, Alex.
[2:28:37.120 --> 2:28:39.120]  And we're winning.
[2:28:39.120 --> 2:28:40.120]  That's the thing.
[2:28:40.120 --> 2:28:43.120]  As I always say when I'm on the show, we have not on our side.
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:44.120]  We have truth on our side.
[2:28:44.120 --> 2:28:46.120]  And we have the people on our side.
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:28:49.120]  And I think GABA is proof of that, right?
[2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:50.120]  Like I said, we're exploding in growth.
[2:28:50.120 --> 2:28:53.120]  We've literally doubled our traffic in the past 48 hours.
[2:28:53.120 --> 2:28:55.120]  We have hundreds of thousands of people coming to the site.
[2:28:55.120 --> 2:28:57.120]  I think this is the tipping point.
[2:28:57.120 --> 2:28:59.120]  This is the tipping point for big tech.
[2:28:59.120 --> 2:29:02.120]  And we're probably going to see the attacks start to ride up against GABA again.
[2:29:02.120 --> 2:29:04.120]  We're going to see hip pieces come out against us.
[2:29:04.120 --> 2:29:05.120]  You know the drill.
[2:29:05.120 --> 2:29:06.120]  You've been through it, right?
[2:29:06.120 --> 2:29:08.120]  But, you know, this is an information war.
[2:29:08.120 --> 2:29:09.120]  This is the time of revolution.
[2:29:09.120 --> 2:29:13.120]  And I'm glad that I'm a patriot and I'm on the right side of history.
[2:29:13.120 --> 2:29:14.120]  I agree.
[2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:18.120]  You know, I've asked a bunch of questions here, but the time we have left Andrew Torba of GABA,
[2:29:18.120 --> 2:29:22.120]  what else do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners?
[2:29:22.120 --> 2:29:24.120]  Guys, we've got to fight back, right?
[2:29:24.120 --> 2:29:26.120]  We've got to build our own platforms.
[2:29:26.120 --> 2:29:29.120]  Alex spent, you know, 27 years building his own platform.
[2:29:29.120 --> 2:29:32.120]  And with the power of the internet, with the power of open source technology,
[2:29:32.120 --> 2:29:33.120]  it's never been cheaper.
[2:29:33.120 --> 2:29:37.120]  It's never been easier to build your own website, to have your own voice,
[2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:40.120]  and to start your own social network like I did, right?
[2:29:40.120 --> 2:29:42.120]  So you guys can all do this.
[2:29:42.120 --> 2:29:47.120]  You can all stop using these big tech apps, these big tech products,
[2:29:47.120 --> 2:29:52.120]  letting them profit off of your data, mine your data, track everything you do across the web,
[2:29:52.120 --> 2:29:56.120]  and then turn around and shut you up when you dare speak outside of it.
[2:29:56.120 --> 2:29:59.120]  That's correct. They use you, abuse you, and then throw you away.
[2:29:59.120 --> 2:30:01.120]  But isn't that the paradox of their weakness?
[2:30:01.120 --> 2:30:05.120]  Is they believe they would allow all this to flourish that we build,
[2:30:05.120 --> 2:30:08.120]  and that they would then dominate it, but when they start losing, they want to dominate us,
[2:30:08.120 --> 2:30:10.120]  but in the end, they're going to fail regardless.
[2:30:10.120 --> 2:30:13.120]  I mean, that just shows their arrogance.
[2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:17.120]  Right. Like I said, they're pushing hundreds of thousands of people over to GABA,
[2:30:17.120 --> 2:30:20.120]  or over to Big Shoot, or over to any of these other alternatives, right?
[2:30:20.120 --> 2:30:24.120]  People are building and people are exiting, right? Exactly.
[2:30:24.120 --> 2:30:28.120]  And that video has got five times the traffic this year it had last year.
[2:30:28.120 --> 2:30:33.120]  It's incredible, and people are supporting those of us who are building.
[2:30:33.120 --> 2:30:35.120]  This is only possible because of our users.
[2:30:35.120 --> 2:30:38.120]  We're fully funded by our users, and we have them for four years.
[2:30:38.120 --> 2:30:41.120]  By the way, explain that. It's not a pat on the head.
[2:30:41.120 --> 2:30:43.120]  They're like a volcano coming up. They're it.
[2:30:43.120 --> 2:30:45.120]  It's not like, oh, you're part of it.
[2:30:45.120 --> 2:30:49.120]  No, it's like the people supporting, spreading the word, you're it.
[2:30:49.120 --> 2:30:51.120]  Yes, exactly.
[2:30:51.120 --> 2:30:56.120]  You know, we sent an email asking folks to ask the president to get on GABA,
[2:30:56.120 --> 2:30:59.120]  and there are now thousands and thousands and thousands of tweets
[2:30:59.120 --> 2:31:02.120]  and Facebook posts and whatever of people doing just that.
[2:31:02.120 --> 2:31:04.120]  You know, we have immobilized.
[2:31:04.120 --> 2:31:07.120]  Yeah, that's a great question. Why doesn't the president, oh, they'll say
[2:31:07.120 --> 2:31:09.120]  a white supremacist put a message on there.
[2:31:09.120 --> 2:31:11.120]  Well, white supremacist put messages on every platform.
[2:31:11.120 --> 2:31:14.120]  Like saying a white supremacist use a telephone so no one can ever use a telephone again.
[2:31:14.120 --> 2:31:17.120]  The president needs to endorse GABA and other platforms.
[2:31:17.120 --> 2:31:20.120]  That's really the power above.
[2:31:20.120 --> 2:31:21.120]  That's right.
[2:31:21.120 --> 2:31:23.120]  And he trusts it would just be to endorse it.
[2:31:23.120 --> 2:31:26.120]  Yes. Oh, yeah. And you go ahead.
[2:31:26.120 --> 2:31:28.120]  Yeah, that would turn everything on its head.
[2:31:28.120 --> 2:31:30.120]  Robert, if you want to go off on that, because I don't want to, you know,
[2:31:30.120 --> 2:31:33.120]  toot my own horn here, but that that is the ultimate, you know,
[2:31:33.120 --> 2:31:37.120]  FU to Silicon Valley is stop using these products, go over here.
[2:31:37.120 --> 2:31:40.120]  And it's not saying that he's going to quit Twitter or quit Facebook.
[2:31:40.120 --> 2:31:44.120]  Obviously, he's not going to use Twitter to tell them about GABA.
[2:31:44.120 --> 2:31:46.120]  Exactly. Exactly.
[2:31:46.120 --> 2:31:48.120]  And that will shake up.
[2:31:48.120 --> 2:31:50.120]  I don't think the president will do that.
[2:31:50.120 --> 2:31:54.120]  I mean, I think, I think they, they think they can manipulate and play games, you know,
[2:31:54.120 --> 2:31:57.120]  I think they're going to really get a surprise now.
[2:31:57.120 --> 2:32:01.120]  He could transcend these people and he could do that without anybody shutting him down
[2:32:01.120 --> 2:32:03.120]  at any court or, you know, anything.
[2:32:03.120 --> 2:32:06.120]  He just does that move to alternative.
[2:32:06.120 --> 2:32:10.120]  I'm just saying I get Andrew being somewhat critical that it's not at least its action.
[2:32:10.120 --> 2:32:12.120]  Oh, yeah. And it is actually in the right direction.
[2:32:12.120 --> 2:32:15.120]  There are risks in it that Andrew has identified,
[2:32:15.120 --> 2:32:18.120]  but those risks can be remedied as they develop.
[2:32:18.120 --> 2:32:20.120]  Well, the man, the arena got all the answers.
[2:32:20.120 --> 2:32:22.120]  Right. He just climbed in the arena.
[2:32:22.120 --> 2:32:24.120]  Right. He did it again. We want it.
[2:32:24.120 --> 2:32:26.120]  I just did it. Yeah, I agree.
[2:32:26.120 --> 2:32:29.120]  So now he's going to listen to us. Go ahead, Andrew.
[2:32:29.120 --> 2:32:32.120]  Right. Yeah. No, he's swinging now. He's doing something right.
[2:32:32.120 --> 2:32:36.120]  This again, Alex, this is a problem that, you know, God blessed me to have the foresight
[2:32:36.120 --> 2:32:41.120]  and the vision, you know, almost four years ago to see this stuff coming and to build and to prepare.
[2:32:41.120 --> 2:32:44.120]  You know, it's like I'm building the arc over the past four years.
[2:32:44.120 --> 2:32:47.120]  And now it's ready and people are coming over and flooding over.
[2:32:47.120 --> 2:32:50.120]  And, you know, this is the future. This is the future.
[2:32:50.120 --> 2:32:54.120]  The future is on us. The future is to build.
[2:32:54.120 --> 2:32:56.120]  That is the solution ultimately.
[2:32:56.120 --> 2:33:00.120]  I totally agree. We built Band-Aid video. You built Gab.
[2:33:00.120 --> 2:33:03.120]  It's all beautiful things. Thank you so much, Mr. Torb.
[2:33:03.120 --> 2:33:05.120]  Join us again next week.
[2:33:05.120 --> 2:33:07.120]  We'll do Alex. Have a great day.
[2:33:07.120 --> 2:33:11.120]  All right, guys, I want to come back and get into other points on this.
[2:33:11.120 --> 2:33:14.120]  But I really want to get up into the next phase.
[2:33:14.120 --> 2:33:17.120]  How are they going to strike back with the COVID-19 lockdowns?
[2:33:17.120 --> 2:33:20.120]  How are they going to strike back with the race war that we see?
[2:33:20.120 --> 2:33:23.120]  Because, I mean, the global speed business.
[2:33:23.120 --> 2:33:27.120]  So we'll talk about how to stop their next level on the other side.
[2:33:27.120 --> 2:33:30.120]  And then we've got Owen Schreuer and others taking over.
[2:33:30.120 --> 2:33:32.120]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Lord willing.
[2:33:32.120 --> 2:33:35.120]  And I say Lord willing because every day above ground is a good day.
[2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:42.120]  The only reason I'm still here is God. I'm not the man in charge.
[2:34:05.120 --> 2:34:11.120]  They were more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them again at a starving level.
[2:34:11.120 --> 2:34:16.120]  They were so busy trying to survive, they would never try to challenge the entrenched elite.
[2:34:16.120 --> 2:34:22.120]  Well, now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the Jeff Bezos, is the world.
[2:34:22.120 --> 2:34:28.120]  They're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets living the life,
[2:34:28.120 --> 2:34:33.120]  laughing at you, shut down, going bankrupt in the third world, starving to death.
[2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:39.120]  Their religion is power and control, and they are pressing that advantage against us.
[2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:42.120]  We must break free from these monsters.
[2:34:42.120 --> 2:34:47.120]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms
[2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:51.120]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[2:34:51.120 --> 2:34:56.120]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world.
[2:34:56.120 --> 2:35:02.120]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be.
[2:35:02.120 --> 2:35:08.120]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy.
[2:35:08.120 --> 2:35:12.120]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient,
[2:35:12.120 --> 2:35:17.120]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[2:35:17.120 --> 2:35:19.120]  They've admitted all of this.
[2:35:19.120 --> 2:35:25.120]  So remember, how does M-Full Wars continue years and decades, in many cases,
[2:35:25.120 --> 2:35:27.120]  to be able to predict things before they happen?
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:34.120]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan, and yes, it's dystopic, and yes, it's scary.
[2:35:34.120 --> 2:35:38.120]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[2:35:38.120 --> 2:36:01.120]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[2:36:08.120 --> 2:36:13.120]  You're going to be the service economy, and now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy,
[2:36:13.120 --> 2:36:20.120]  and you're obsolete, so you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:23.120]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[2:36:23.120 --> 2:36:28.120]  We have to resist and say no to the New World Order, and that takes you understanding you were right,
[2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:34.120]  and understanding I was right, and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can.
[2:36:34.120 --> 2:36:41.120]  Now is the time for action. Now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:14.120]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the New World Order where they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers,
[2:37:14.120 --> 2:37:18.120]  and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[2:37:18.120 --> 2:37:23.120]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian anti-human group.
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:30.120]  They have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their in-game, which is global depopulation.
[2:37:30.120 --> 2:37:34.120]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[2:37:34.120 --> 2:37:41.120]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy.
[2:37:41.120 --> 2:38:07.120]  Wake up or die.
[2:38:07.120 --> 2:38:14.120]  Alex Jones here back live on this Friday edition, and I'm a father, I'm a human, I'm a patriot, I'm American, I love God,
[2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:23.120]  and I'm just sitting here watching truly evil forces try to bring down society, try to turn us against each other.
[2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:31.120]  And so in the final equation we consider an analyzed data point all day long, and talk about this factoid or that factoid,
[2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:38.120]  but it's really all about power, and those that decide to not care about anybody but themselves, even though it brings down the whole civilization beneath them,
[2:38:38.120 --> 2:38:41.120]  they believe they'll transcend it as being God's barns.
[2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:44.120]  What is behind the New World Order? What is the real world political system?
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:48.120]  I mean, when you go to sleep tonight, when you think about the power structure, what do you see?
[2:38:48.120 --> 2:38:54.120]  That it's a fight for control, that it's a fight for centralized elites wanting to have control over the rest of the population.
[2:38:54.120 --> 2:38:58.120]  Money is just another means of power, which is just another means of control.
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:04.120]  And sort of Bill Gates personifies the mindset, probably better than anyone alive today, but he simply personifies it.
[2:39:04.120 --> 2:39:08.120]  He is not the sole arbiter or provider of it.
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:15.120]  The Zuckerberg, other people have the same kind of mindset, same kind of mentality, same kind of approach, and it's all about fighting for control.
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:22.120]  They want a monopolistic control over aspects of the economy, aspects of political life, aspects of social life.
[2:39:22.120 --> 2:39:26.120]  Sort of lockdown economics and culture is very much sort of a big tech dystopian dream,
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:29.120]  and it's the same mindset and mentality that pervades them throughout.
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:36.120]  So if we're going to resist that, it's allowing the little piece of freedom against this centralized, concentrated control
[2:39:36.120 --> 2:39:44.120]  that the sort of oligopoly of the big tech giants want to impose in their cartel economics and view of politics and social life.
[2:39:44.120 --> 2:39:47.120]  And then these tech ads are just such disgusting people.
[2:39:47.120 --> 2:39:52.120]  You were saying before the break, it's been Zuckerberg, at least on the surface, that bucks it the most.
[2:39:52.120 --> 2:40:00.120]  We have a clip of that here, Zuckerberg with Dana Perino, Mrs. Perino, last night claiming, oh, I don't want to censor anybody.
[2:40:00.120 --> 2:40:01.120]  Here it is.
[2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:05.120]  Twitter decided for the first time ever to fact check one of President Trump's tweets.
[2:40:05.120 --> 2:40:09.120]  I wondered if you thought that Twitter may have made the wrong decision here.
[2:40:09.120 --> 2:40:12.120]  We have a different policy, I think, than Twitter on this.
[2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:21.120]  You know, I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.
[2:40:21.120 --> 2:40:28.120]  I think in general, private companies probably shouldn't be, or especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.
[2:40:28.120 --> 2:40:36.120]  He said last year when I said that Biden had neurological problems, they said, you can only mention Alex Jones if it's a negative connotation.
[2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:38.120]  So they didn't just arbitrate what truth was.
[2:40:38.120 --> 2:40:42.120]  They said, in a cult, two minutes of hate, you must say it's bad, David.
[2:40:42.120 --> 2:40:48.120]  Well, you know, he just banned conversation from the president of Brazil who was talking about hydroxychloroquine.
[2:40:48.120 --> 2:40:51.120]  And so he's going to try to control every aspect of this.
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:59.120]  But you know, Alex, when you talk about what's behind this, look, it is a conspiracy, but it is a satanic conspiracy.
[2:40:59.120 --> 2:41:02.120]  I believe, like you do, this is a spiritual battle.
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:04.120]  And this is why it's consistent.
[2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:07.120]  And this is why generations, generations, exactly.
[2:41:07.120 --> 2:41:14.120]  Just put a different person in there, bow down and worship me, and I will give you the kingdoms and the keys to all of this stuff.
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:16.120]  And oh, by the way, this is what I want.
[2:41:16.120 --> 2:41:18.120]  I want to eradicate mankind.
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:23.120]  I want to destroy people and, you know, have depopulation and so forth.
[2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:26.120]  So we see these types of kill, kill and destroy.
[2:41:26.120 --> 2:41:29.120]  That's right. We see these programs consistently being pushed forward.
[2:41:29.120 --> 2:41:34.120]  The faces change, but the agenda remains the same from person to person.
[2:41:34.120 --> 2:41:38.120]  That's why when you talk to people and they don't look at this from a spiritual standpoint.
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:39.120]  They don't get it.
[2:41:39.120 --> 2:41:42.120]  They say, well, you know, so who's running the strings?
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:43.120]  Who's pulling the strings?
[2:41:43.120 --> 2:41:44.120]  Well, we know who's pulling the strings.
[2:41:44.120 --> 2:41:48.120]  Well, the Bible calls it the mystery of evil because you said it's generation after generation.
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:52.120]  Because I was never, I mean, I was a kid and I love God.
[2:41:52.120 --> 2:41:58.120]  I believe God was real, but I hadn't really, when I got into politics and saw it face to face with like, my God, this is real.
[2:41:58.120 --> 2:42:00.120]  And that's why you see all these people like Epstein and all the rest.
[2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:05.120]  That's why there's all these pedophile connections, all these satanic rituals that are all part of that.
[2:42:05.120 --> 2:42:07.120]  Because they've got to commit evil to government. They've got to like get in the club.
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:08.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:14.120]  And so when you look at people like Bill Gates, who, you know, doesn't have any kids and he wants to kill everybody else's kids.
[2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:16.120]  I mean, he gets power from that.
[2:42:16.120 --> 2:42:19.120]  That's, that's, you know, he likes the power and he's willing to do this.
[2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:23.120]  And he is basically, you know, these are the approaches that he's taken.
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:31.120]  But what I'm concerned about here as we look at it in the immediate standpoint here, how are, how are they implementing this?
[2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:36.120]  And the thing that I still come back to, yeah, we should be having this discussion about free speech.
[2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:41.120]  One of the reasons that they were allowed to lock us down was because they had silenced everybody else.
[2:42:41.120 --> 2:42:43.120]  They had a monolithic narrative out there.
[2:42:43.120 --> 2:42:45.120]  Oh, they got that in place up front.
[2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:48.120]  Yeah, exactly. And so we have to be able to push back against this.
[2:42:48.120 --> 2:42:50.120]  We have to do it from the local level.
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:52.120]  But, you know, this has to be rolled back.
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:43:01.120]  And even from the standpoint of President Trump, he's got to realize that if they, they are doing this for political purposes as well as to destroy us individually.
[2:43:01.120 --> 2:43:05.120]  And he's not going to win reelection if he's got a great depression on his hands.
[2:43:05.120 --> 2:43:06.120]  Oh, he knows now.
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:08.120]  No, no, he, he knows with 157.
[2:43:08.120 --> 2:43:10.120]  And he's going to have to undo the siob.
[2:43:10.120 --> 2:43:11.120]  I agree.
[2:43:11.120 --> 2:43:14.120]  So Barnes, your constitutional lawyer, transcending all this.
[2:43:14.120 --> 2:43:15.120]  Who are the players?
[2:43:15.120 --> 2:43:16.120]  What do you see happening?
[2:43:16.120 --> 2:43:17.120]  What should we be doing?
[2:43:17.120 --> 2:43:24.120]  Well, the two key components to the announcement yesterday was that they're going to use not only the approach that they did with Microsoft,
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:27.120]  which did ultimately discipline Microsoft and antitrust.
[2:43:27.120 --> 2:43:28.120]  Broke it up.
[2:43:28.120 --> 2:43:29.120]  Exactly.
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:30.120]  The last time a trust cut broke up.
[2:43:30.120 --> 2:43:31.120]  Exactly.
[2:43:31.120 --> 2:43:34.120]  The last time that you, the big tech threat was really present.
[2:43:34.120 --> 2:43:40.120]  The last time the Sherman antitrust act was meaningfully used and employed and disciplined a guy who completely was arrogant.
[2:43:40.120 --> 2:43:41.120]  Oh, talk about it.
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:42.120]  Yeah.
[2:43:42.120 --> 2:43:44.120]  I mean, there's nobody like it when it comes to Bill Gates.
[2:43:44.120 --> 2:43:51.120]  And then the second component of it is use the big tobacco strategy to go after big tech in the same way.
[2:43:51.120 --> 2:43:58.120]  Use the state attorney generals going after their mass consumer deception of ordinary people whose assets will happen as they said,
[2:43:58.120 --> 2:44:05.120]  hey, you come in and join big tech, you give us your personal and private information that we are going to turn around and monetize for our personal profit.
[2:44:05.120 --> 2:44:07.120]  And in exchange, we'll protect your speech.
[2:44:07.120 --> 2:44:08.120]  Total fraud.
[2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:09.120]  Exactly.
[2:44:09.120 --> 2:44:10.120]  Pure.
[2:44:10.120 --> 2:44:11.120]  That's what it is.
[2:44:11.120 --> 2:44:13.120]  At its core, big tech was built on massive fraud.
[2:44:13.120 --> 2:44:16.120]  The way big tobacco's profits were built on massive fraud.
[2:44:16.120 --> 2:44:23.120]  So use the same mechanism, the same methods, the same means, the same mode to take them down the way we took down big tobacco.
[2:44:23.120 --> 2:44:28.120]  Use the same strategy, same approach, and that's what was announced. That was the biggest thing announced yesterday.
[2:44:28.120 --> 2:44:29.120]  Exactly.
[2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:32.120]  They've got articles going, oh, don't worry, Trump's easy.
[2:44:32.120 --> 2:44:35.120]  Twitter has little to fear from Trump.
[2:44:35.120 --> 2:44:36.120]  That's the top.
[2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:37.120]  That's at the top of Yahoo all day.
[2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:38.120]  Use the 20 plus.
[2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:39.120]  The opposite.
[2:44:39.120 --> 2:44:40.120]  They have a lot to fear.
[2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:41.120]  Exactly.
[2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:43.120]  Probably the biggest case is going to come right here in Texas.
[2:44:43.120 --> 2:44:47.120]  But use the Republican attorney generals to go after them to establish the precedent the same way.
[2:44:47.120 --> 2:44:52.120]  And those juries, everybody's going to see it like they literally have engaged in fraud.
[2:44:52.120 --> 2:44:53.120]  Oh, no doubt.
[2:44:53.120 --> 2:44:55.120]  I mean, first of all, there was really two levels of fraud.
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:44:59.120]  The main level of fraud was, hey, come in, bring your friends, bring content.
[2:44:59.120 --> 2:45:01.120]  We want none of these big platforms.
[2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:02.120]  Run your advert?
[2:45:02.120 --> 2:45:07.120]  Oh, not only just the advertising, but you know, when I said I spent 20 million on advertising, I wanted to wake up the world.
[2:45:07.120 --> 2:45:09.120]  We spent almost all our money.
[2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:10.120]  But even more.
[2:45:10.120 --> 2:45:14.120]  Like six, eight, nine years ago, like my family's like, Alex, you're making no money.
[2:45:14.120 --> 2:45:15.120]  You're spending all of my own advertising.
[2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:17.120]  I said, I want to wake the world up.
[2:45:17.120 --> 2:45:18.120]  We're not here to make money.
[2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:23.120]  But exactly, I spent all that money with big tech and now that you say, oh, does it matter?
[2:45:23.120 --> 2:45:24.120]  You spent 20 million with us.
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:25.120]  You're nothing now.
[2:45:25.120 --> 2:45:32.120]  Well, and the thing is, and if you look at it broadly, even if you hadn't spent a penny in advertising, you brought probably billions of dollars.
[2:45:32.120 --> 2:45:34.120]  I mean, I paid the money.
[2:45:34.120 --> 2:45:35.120]  Oh yeah, you did.
[2:45:35.120 --> 2:45:38.120]  But I'm saying on top of that, because I just wanted to wake people up.
[2:45:38.120 --> 2:45:39.120]  Well, think about it this way.
[2:45:39.120 --> 2:45:45.120]  Every other broadcasting platform at some level pays for the content they produce.
[2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:49.120]  What happened is the big tech said, please give us your content for free.
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:51.120]  We're not going to pay you for your content.
[2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:52.120]  That's right.
[2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:57.120]  And in exchange will allow you to have complete freedom so that you can reach a broader audience.
[2:45:57.120 --> 2:46:02.120]  And I remember when you were about one of only about a half dozen people with Facebook live, right?
[2:46:02.120 --> 2:46:05.120]  They came to you first and you helped to build that function.
[2:46:05.120 --> 2:46:08.120]  Well, that's why I wanted me to meet with Zuckerberg in New York.
[2:46:08.120 --> 2:46:09.120]  That was an awesome meeting.
[2:46:09.120 --> 2:46:10.120]  But yeah, they try to get me this.
[2:46:10.120 --> 2:46:11.120]  Yeah.
[2:46:11.120 --> 2:46:12.120]  We need to look at it.
[2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:13.120]  So they use you to build that.
[2:46:13.120 --> 2:46:14.120]  Exactly.
[2:46:14.120 --> 2:46:15.120]  And then kick you off.
[2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:16.120]  Precisely.
[2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:18.120]  If all these people hadn't joined it, they would never have developed Monopoly.
[2:46:18.120 --> 2:46:21.120]  Our first Facebook lives had millions of viewers every time.
[2:46:21.120 --> 2:46:22.120]  Yeah.
[2:46:22.120 --> 2:46:23.120]  Oh yeah, I remember.
[2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:24.120]  Yeah.
[2:46:24.120 --> 2:46:28.120]  Well, if you look at a conservative, probably you yourself helped contribute 10 million
[2:46:28.120 --> 2:46:31.120]  people to big tech platforms, which they value on average.
[2:46:31.120 --> 2:46:33.120]  And I paid them all the money we made.
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:34.120]  Exactly.
[2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:35.120]  Because I want to just reach more people.
[2:46:35.120 --> 2:46:36.120]  Precisely.
[2:46:36.120 --> 2:46:40.120]  And then finally, when we hit the zeitgeist, they said, no, me, me, no.
[2:46:40.120 --> 2:46:44.120]  And if you look at the monetary value of those people coming in and subscribing and supporting
[2:46:44.120 --> 2:46:48.120]  and you providing that content free of charge to them, the net effect of it is billions
[2:46:48.120 --> 2:46:49.120]  of dollars.
[2:46:49.120 --> 2:46:53.120]  And the point is, whether you were a plumber or whatever, they took everybody's ads.
[2:46:53.120 --> 2:46:55.120]  They did it and now they went, no, you don't matter.
[2:46:55.120 --> 2:46:59.120]  It's a combination of consumer deception and unjust enrichment.
[2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:04.120]  An old legal concept where somebody gets rich by some unjust mechanism and means by making
[2:47:04.120 --> 2:47:06.120]  a false promise to someone else.
[2:47:06.120 --> 2:47:09.120]  So the principles of equity require that they reimburse those funds.
[2:47:09.120 --> 2:47:13.120]  So you could completely, if the government wanted to, the attorney generals could completely
[2:47:13.120 --> 2:47:17.120]  bankrupt every big tech company tomorrow by simply pursuing legal theories that currently
[2:47:17.120 --> 2:47:18.120]  exist.
[2:47:18.120 --> 2:47:21.120]  And again, big tech is so big, they believe they buy everyone off.
[2:47:21.120 --> 2:47:24.120]  If government, people go, oh, be libertarian, Jones.
[2:47:24.120 --> 2:47:27.120]  These mega corporations are the government.
[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:31.120]  We need the vestigial government, the separation of power to stop them.
[2:47:31.120 --> 2:47:33.120]  The best test case would be right here in Texas.
[2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:34.120]  Or government's gone.
[2:47:34.120 --> 2:47:35.120]  Yeah, just do it right here in Texas.
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:37.120]  In Texas, there is a good Texas Supreme Court.
[2:47:37.120 --> 2:47:39.120]  There's a good Texas attorney general.
[2:47:39.120 --> 2:47:41.120]  There can be good Texas juries.
[2:47:41.120 --> 2:47:42.120]  Bring it here in Texas.
[2:47:42.120 --> 2:47:47.120]  Make it the signature case, just like Mississippi was with big tobacco, let Texas be with big
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:52.120]  tech and finally discipline these behemoths and cartels, ultimately maybe needing to break
[2:47:52.120 --> 2:47:57.120]  them up, but at some level disciplining them to simply keep the promises they made to the
[2:47:57.120 --> 2:47:58.120]  public that has enriched them.
[2:47:58.120 --> 2:47:59.120]  That's all that's being required.
[2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:03.120]  But nobody's asking these private companies to be treated differently than any other private
[2:48:03.120 --> 2:48:04.120]  company.
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:05.120]  And let's be clear, though.
[2:48:05.120 --> 2:48:10.120]  They're not benevolent dictatorships.
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:11.120]  They're malevolent.
[2:48:11.120 --> 2:48:13.120]  They're not going to stop.
[2:48:13.120 --> 2:48:14.120]  Exactly.
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:17.120]  They're like the Rockefellers of the 19th century.
[2:48:17.120 --> 2:48:20.120]  You got to spank them for them to wake up and do the right thing.
[2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:24.120]  And then now, when I ask you both to come back ahead of the guest taking over, then how
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:28.120]  does big tech strike back with David Knight, Robert Barnes, I'm Alex Jones.
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:35.120]  This is the end, my friends.
[2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:42.120]  My only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of everything that stands the
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:43.120]  end.
[2:48:43.120 --> 2:48:46.120]  The safety, the delusion.
[2:48:46.120 --> 2:48:51.120]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because it was only the mirage of safety.
[2:48:51.120 --> 2:48:57.120]  Movies and partying and living like children, ever growing up, ever caring about other people.
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:49:00.120]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:05.120]  Just like the history books show us, just like the Bible states, every time Israel became
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:10.120]  corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought into captivity because their
[2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:16.120]  people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated by spies, and then they were
[2:49:16.120 --> 2:49:17.120]  enslaved.
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:19.120]  We are repeating that again today.
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:25.120]  Compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage.
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:28.120]  Info wars has decided to fight for freedom.
[2:49:28.120 --> 2:49:33.120]  Info wars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[2:49:33.120 --> 2:49:38.120]  I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying our economy slowing down and shutting
[2:49:38.120 --> 2:49:43.120]  down is like shooting a deer and it runs 100 yards before it knows it's been shot and
[2:49:43.120 --> 2:49:44.120]  then it finally dies.
[2:49:44.120 --> 2:49:49.120]  She said, well, yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there was an argument in
[2:49:49.120 --> 2:49:53.120]  the street and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the
[2:49:53.120 --> 2:49:58.120]  head had blood pouring out, a huge hole and he was holding it and he walked around gibbering
[2:49:58.120 --> 2:50:02.120]  talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead.
[2:50:02.120 --> 2:50:05.120]  Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy.
[2:50:05.120 --> 2:50:07.120]  It is in cardiac arrest.
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:12.120]  This has been done by design and the UN, the Chi Coms, the mainstream media orchestrated
[2:50:12.120 --> 2:50:15.120]  it, hyped it and tried to keep the economy closed.
[2:50:15.120 --> 2:50:20.120]  So remember, the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:26.120]  UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on the Democrats.
[2:50:26.120 --> 2:50:27.120]  We tried to stop it.
[2:50:27.120 --> 2:50:28.120]  We tried to fight it.
[2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:32.120]  But you guys have said you wanted to wreck America and the world and now you've done
[2:50:32.120 --> 2:50:33.120]  it.
[2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:34.120]  Congratulations.
[2:50:34.120 --> 2:50:42.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:42.120 --> 2:50:51.120]  All right, we can sit here and rearrange deck chairs on the Titanic.
[2:50:51.120 --> 2:50:53.120]  But David Knight was making some great points.
[2:50:53.120 --> 2:50:59.120]  You have all these 25-year-old leftist mayors put in by Soros, calling for race rioting,
[2:50:59.120 --> 2:51:00.120]  all of this.
[2:51:00.120 --> 2:51:01.120]  None of it's about justice.
[2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:03.120]  It's about overthrowing the country.
[2:51:03.120 --> 2:51:04.120]  It's about slavery.
[2:51:04.120 --> 2:51:08.120]  If you want to wake up inside the Soviet Union, Americans, you're very close to that.
[2:51:08.120 --> 2:51:12.120]  We've got a clip coming up that's bone-chilling on Infowars.com.
[2:51:12.120 --> 2:51:15.120]  Riders blast the purge message through loudspeakers.
[2:51:15.120 --> 2:51:19.120]  Any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 hours.
[2:51:19.120 --> 2:51:21.120]  So they're trying to trigger the Civil War.
[2:51:21.120 --> 2:51:24.120]  You were making some points to have a night.
[2:51:24.120 --> 2:51:30.120]  Well, you know, Alex, when we look at a pent-up demand, you know, you got this mayor in Minneapolis
[2:51:30.120 --> 2:51:34.120]  who was saying, if you're within five hours, come here and protest.
[2:51:34.120 --> 2:51:35.120]  Well, not protesting.
[2:51:35.120 --> 2:51:36.120]  They're looting.
[2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:37.120]  They're burning.
[2:51:37.120 --> 2:51:38.120]  They're getting violent.
[2:51:38.120 --> 2:51:42.120]  And that's exactly what he wants, because you've got a lot of pent-up frustration with a lot
[2:51:42.120 --> 2:51:47.120]  of people, and it's going to get worse as this Great Depression continues if the lockdown
[2:51:47.120 --> 2:51:48.120]  is not removed.
[2:51:48.120 --> 2:51:53.120]  And it's the mayor running the department that taught the cop how to choke somebody to death.
[2:51:53.120 --> 2:51:54.120]  Yeah.
[2:51:54.120 --> 2:51:57.120]  Well, I mean, the mob boss in charge is saying, come burn things down.
[2:51:57.120 --> 2:51:59.120]  They've had a lot of problems there in Minneapolis.
[2:51:59.120 --> 2:52:01.120]  I mean, you go back to Flando Castile, and I can't really...
[2:52:01.120 --> 2:52:03.120]  And the Somali police guy killing the...
[2:52:03.120 --> 2:52:05.120]  That's right, killing the lady from Australia.
[2:52:05.120 --> 2:52:07.120]  They've got a training issue.
[2:52:07.120 --> 2:52:12.120]  They've got an accountability issue, but then he is putting himself out virtually signaling
[2:52:12.120 --> 2:52:13.120]  like he's going to be the savior.
[2:52:13.120 --> 2:52:18.120]  But again, he's talking about 400 years of pent-up frustration because of slavery and
[2:52:18.120 --> 2:52:19.120]  so forth.
[2:52:19.120 --> 2:52:23.120]  He is stoking this to try to get a race war because they don't want you to get upset about
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:24.120]  the lockdown.
[2:52:24.120 --> 2:52:29.120]  That's fundamentally the frustration that both sides are feeling right now, and they want
[2:52:29.120 --> 2:52:33.120]  to have both sides fighting each other, and they're doing a pretty good job of pitting
[2:52:33.120 --> 2:52:36.120]  black against white because it's happening.
[2:52:36.120 --> 2:52:38.120]  It's spreading out of Minneapolis.
[2:52:38.120 --> 2:52:42.120]  I mean, what is happening in Minneapolis is not staying there.
[2:52:42.120 --> 2:52:44.120]  Well, it's discrediting civil rights movement.
[2:52:44.120 --> 2:52:46.120]  So you remember from Seattle, the same thing.
[2:52:46.120 --> 2:52:50.120]  When you had legitimate organic civil protests, they came in with the NWO, brought in the
[2:52:50.120 --> 2:52:54.120]  black-clad anarchist, Antifa's president in Minneapolis as well.
[2:52:54.120 --> 2:52:55.120]  Oh, yeah.
[2:52:55.120 --> 2:52:57.120]  It was Clinton's Delta Force.
[2:52:57.120 --> 2:52:58.120]  Exactly.
[2:52:58.120 --> 2:53:00.120]  And remember, they were coming in and they were breaking windows and all the rest, and
[2:53:00.120 --> 2:53:04.120]  then they went and maced those kids in the eyes and all that stuff and all those Seattle
[2:53:04.120 --> 2:53:05.120]  frontline protests.
[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:10.120]  The methodologies, and this goes all the way back to the 1920s, 1930s, when street violence
[2:53:10.120 --> 2:53:15.120]  became political theater in Europe, they learned, OK, this is how we can orchestrate
[2:53:15.120 --> 2:53:16.120]  political chaos.
[2:53:16.120 --> 2:53:18.120]  This is how we can create divide.
[2:53:18.120 --> 2:53:22.120]  You can hear it talked about the 1960s when they infiltrated Cohen's help road.
[2:53:22.120 --> 2:53:23.120]  And now we have the Soros documents.
[2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:24.120]  They're doing it.
[2:53:24.120 --> 2:53:25.120]  Exactly.
[2:53:25.120 --> 2:53:26.120]  There was no question.
[2:53:26.120 --> 2:53:28.120]  So Trump's just going there and point out Soros is funding it?
[2:53:28.120 --> 2:53:29.120]  Exactly.
[2:53:29.120 --> 2:53:33.120]  And to show the groups sponsoring these protests are the very groups doing this.
[2:53:33.120 --> 2:53:35.120]  I mean, there's a go back to Bill Ayers, right?
[2:53:35.120 --> 2:53:36.120]  Yes.
[2:53:36.120 --> 2:53:39.120]  He was the one who was popularizing this whole white skin privilege is what he called it
[2:53:39.120 --> 2:53:40.120]  at the time, right?
[2:53:40.120 --> 2:53:41.120]  Right.
[2:53:41.120 --> 2:53:45.120]  He realized that a economic division wasn't going to fly here at the time.
[2:53:45.120 --> 2:53:46.120]  Powered people wasn't going to work.
[2:53:46.120 --> 2:53:47.120]  Right.
[2:53:47.120 --> 2:53:49.120]  So he wanted to make this about race and that's where he focused.
[2:53:49.120 --> 2:53:52.120]  And the goal is to be divisive because you look at the George Floyd case, that's a case
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:53:54.120]  that could be a uniting case.
[2:53:54.120 --> 2:53:58.120]  People see somebody with a knee on the back of a guy with no justification, no warrant,
[2:53:58.120 --> 2:54:02.120]  and when I told people in advance, if he's a bad cop who'll have a record turned out,
[2:54:02.120 --> 2:54:04.120]  he had a record, a lot of complaints, lots of issues.
[2:54:04.120 --> 2:54:06.120]  That's a case where that could happen.
[2:54:06.120 --> 2:54:09.120]  That does happen to white people, Latino people all across the country.
[2:54:09.120 --> 2:54:11.120]  That could be a unifying case.
[2:54:11.120 --> 2:54:15.120]  So what they do in any of those circumstances where they have a unifying case is they create
[2:54:15.120 --> 2:54:17.120]  something to divide people once again.
[2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:18.120]  That's right.
[2:54:18.120 --> 2:54:22.120]  And you see the riots the next day and the riots, there's outsiders on tape, outsiders
[2:54:22.120 --> 2:54:26.120]  involved in it, outsiders and people that are going to be connected to politically motivated
[2:54:26.120 --> 2:54:31.120]  organizations there to in effect discredit civil rights by increasing the divisiveness
[2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:36.120]  in the local community from a case that could otherwise be uniting in the public sphere.
[2:54:36.120 --> 2:54:37.120]  Yeah.
[2:54:37.120 --> 2:54:42.120]  The Australian lady who got killed there in Minneapolis had marched for reform after
[2:54:42.120 --> 2:54:44.120]  the Flandre Castile situation.
[2:54:44.120 --> 2:54:48.120]  Yesterday, I went through a whole list of different cases right off the free thought
[2:54:48.120 --> 2:54:51.120]  project because they focus on a lot of police brutality and so forth.
[2:54:51.120 --> 2:54:53.120]  I said, okay, here's this case, this case.
[2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:56.120]  You've got people who are innocent that are beaten or killed.
[2:54:56.120 --> 2:54:58.120]  And I said, guess which ones are white?
[2:54:58.120 --> 2:54:59.120]  Which ones are black?
[2:54:59.120 --> 2:55:00.120]  They don't want to focus on that.
[2:55:00.120 --> 2:55:03.120]  Instead, they want to focus on the skin color of the victim.
[2:55:03.120 --> 2:55:05.120]  And that's really where they're...
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:06.120]  Because they need divisiveness.
[2:55:06.120 --> 2:55:10.120]  Divisiveness only works for the political partisan purposes that they want to see.
[2:55:10.120 --> 2:55:14.120]  The uniting cases bring people together, show the success of the legal system, show the
[2:55:14.120 --> 2:55:15.120]  world that we're all human.
[2:55:15.120 --> 2:55:16.120]  It's a progenitor.
[2:55:16.120 --> 2:55:18.120]  Sure, there's an attempt to bring down America.
[2:55:18.120 --> 2:55:23.120]  And it's not that America's perfect, but they've got something really evil ready to replace it.
[2:55:23.120 --> 2:55:25.120]  It's called the New World Order.
[2:55:25.120 --> 2:55:30.120]  Final segment straight ahead with both my guest and the next talk show host takes it
[2:55:30.120 --> 2:55:34.120]  over in the last three segments of the Alex Jones show.
[2:55:34.120 --> 2:55:37.120]  Right now, Robert Barnes and David Ninder with us.
[2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:39.120]  We've got a front clip straight ahead.
[2:55:41.120 --> 2:55:42.120]  Memorial Day is here.
[2:55:42.120 --> 2:55:44.120]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:48.120]  And we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch
[2:55:48.120 --> 2:55:49.120]  of items are selling out.
[2:55:49.120 --> 2:55:52.120]  But all the items we have left at stock are still on record sale.
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:57.120]  And then five items that weren't on sale that we got back at stock, they're also massively
[2:55:57.120 --> 2:56:00.120]  discounted as well for the Memorial Day special.
[2:56:00.120 --> 2:56:01.120]  So here it is.
[2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:03.120]  Super male vitality, 40% off.
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:05.120]  Knockout, the great sleeping, 50% off.
[2:56:05.120 --> 2:56:08.120]  Rainforest Plus hadn't been on sale for almost six months.
[2:56:08.120 --> 2:56:10.120]  It is 50% off.
[2:56:10.120 --> 2:56:12.120]  Biotrystallinium, 60% off.
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:14.120]  Shaleforge, it's incredible.
[2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:15.120]  60% off.
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:19.120]  And then you've got all these other items on sale as well until they sell out.
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:24.120]  So infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine to get
[2:56:24.120 --> 2:56:28.120]  these items to take advantage of this mega sale Memorial Day.
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:29.120]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:33.120]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supported you and your
[2:56:33.120 --> 2:56:36.120]  family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[2:56:36.120 --> 2:56:38.120]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[2:56:38.120 --> 2:56:45.120]  We are all in this together.
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:52.120]  The globalist great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on
[2:56:52.120 --> 2:56:53.120]  top.
[2:56:53.120 --> 2:56:56.120]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast.
[2:56:56.120 --> 2:57:02.120]  But we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[2:57:02.120 --> 2:57:06.120]  I'll see you again at the Alex Jones show.
[2:57:06.120 --> 2:57:08.120]  All right, so they got the purge move.
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:09.120]  He's like three or four of them.
[2:57:09.120 --> 2:57:11.120]  White people go out and kill black people.
[2:57:11.120 --> 2:57:14.120]  So the poor black folks brainwashed when they were riding around the planet.
[2:57:14.120 --> 2:57:17.120]  So we're going to kill white people because there's racism.
[2:57:17.120 --> 2:57:20.120]  So we're going to be racist and kill people because of what color they are.
[2:57:20.120 --> 2:57:22.120]  The opposite of what Martin Luther King said.
[2:57:22.120 --> 2:57:24.120]  And by the way, Martin Luther King did invent that.
[2:57:24.120 --> 2:57:28.120]  Well, he said, do you have people like they stand for the character or deeds and actions?
[2:57:28.120 --> 2:57:31.120]  Yeah, that's that's how the universe really works.
[2:57:31.120 --> 2:57:35.120]  So here's a clip of that and a clip of Trump talking about all of this.
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:36.120]  Here it is.
[2:57:36.120 --> 2:57:42.120]  And any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.
[2:57:42.120 --> 2:57:48.120]  Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning
[2:57:48.120 --> 2:57:51.120]  at 7 a.m. in the purge concludes.
[2:57:51.120 --> 2:57:55.120]  Blessed be our new founding fathers and America, a nation reborn.
[2:57:55.120 --> 2:58:04.120]  May God be with you.
[2:58:04.120 --> 2:58:08.120]  So the left puts us into martial law, puts us into a lockdown, promotes all the hype,
[2:58:08.120 --> 2:58:10.120]  and now they bring you into it.
[2:58:10.120 --> 2:58:14.120]  And out of this collapse, you won't be empowered to love total slavery.
[2:58:14.120 --> 2:58:20.120]  Ever done before, hundreds of billions of dollars a year were lost dealing with China,
[2:58:20.120 --> 2:58:25.120]  especially over the years during the prior administration.
[2:58:25.120 --> 2:58:30.120]  China raided our factories, offshored our jobs, gutted our industries,
[2:58:30.120 --> 2:58:38.120]  stole our intellectual property, and violated their commitments under the World Trade Organization.
[2:58:38.120 --> 2:58:42.120]  To make matters worse, they are considered a developing nation,
[2:58:42.120 --> 2:58:48.120]  getting all sorts of benefits that others, including the United States, are not entitled to.
[2:58:48.120 --> 2:58:52.120]  But I had never solely blamed China for this.
[2:58:52.120 --> 2:58:58.120]  They were able to get away with the theft like no one was able to get away with before
[2:58:58.120 --> 2:59:03.120]  because of past politicians and, frankly, past presidents.
[2:59:03.120 --> 2:59:11.120]  But unlike those who came before, my administration negotiated and fought for what was right.
[2:59:11.120 --> 2:59:15.120]  It's called fair and reciprocal treatment.
[2:59:15.120 --> 2:59:20.120]  China has also unlawfully claimed territory in the Pacific Ocean,
[2:59:20.120 --> 2:59:24.120]  threatening freedom of navigation and international trade.
[2:59:24.120 --> 2:59:30.120]  And they broke their word to the world on ensuring the autonomy of Hong Kong.
[2:59:30.120 --> 2:59:35.120]  The United States wants an open and constructive relationship with China,
[2:59:35.120 --> 2:59:41.120]  but achieving that relationship requires us to vigorously defend our national interests.
[2:59:41.120 --> 2:59:49.120]  The Chinese government has continually violated its promises to us and so many other nations.
[2:59:49.120 --> 2:59:54.120]  These plain facts cannot be overlooked or swept aside.
[2:59:54.120 --> 3:00:00.120]  The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government.
[3:00:00.120 --> 3:00:07.120]  China's cover-up of the Wuhan virus allowed the disease to spread all over the world.
[3:00:07.120 --> 3:00:10.120]  By the way, I don't take any pleasure in this.
[3:00:10.120 --> 3:00:16.120]  I've been doing this 26 years, but it's all come to a head, boys and girls.
[3:00:16.120 --> 3:00:19.120]  All the games are over. All the jokes are over.
[3:00:19.120 --> 3:00:26.120]  And we do have a president that's an American president, but we are infiltrated and we're down.
[3:00:26.120 --> 3:00:30.120]  We're up against a lot of evil forces and we're going to war with China.
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:32.120]  I don't know how big that war is going to be.
[3:00:32.120 --> 3:00:34.120]  This isn't some war kicking a bunch of Muslims around.
[3:00:34.120 --> 3:00:36.120]  This isn't a real war.
[3:00:36.120 --> 3:00:38.120]  So David Knight and, of course, Robert Barnes,
[3:00:38.120 --> 3:00:41.120]  you want to make any closing comments about where we are right now?
[3:00:41.120 --> 3:00:46.120]  Well, when you look at the fourth turning, Strauss and Howell wrote in the early 90s,
[3:00:46.120 --> 3:00:49.120]  the same people who came up with the, you know, they'd look at it as a generational view,
[3:00:49.120 --> 3:00:51.120]  cyclical view of history.
[3:00:51.120 --> 3:00:53.120]  They were the ones who coined the term millennial.
[3:00:53.120 --> 3:00:56.120]  And they said in the early 90s, I think it was 93,
[3:00:56.120 --> 3:01:00.120]  they said sometime around the mid-2000s there'll be some kind of a global economic issue.
[3:01:00.120 --> 3:01:02.120]  It'll take a while for this to roll through.
[3:01:02.120 --> 3:01:06.120]  The fourth turning should be completed by 2029.
[3:01:06.120 --> 3:01:12.120]  And at that point we should have a big change in society like we've seen 80-year cycles.
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:15.120]  The last one was the Great Depression and World War II.
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:16.120]  They said...
[3:01:16.120 --> 3:01:18.120]  They're trying to hijack that turning.
[3:01:18.120 --> 3:01:20.120]  Well, 2030 is what they've been focused on.
[3:01:20.120 --> 3:01:22.120]  They understand the cycle as well.
[3:01:22.120 --> 3:01:25.120]  But I would say we're in command of the turn.
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:26.120]  Do you agree?
[3:01:26.120 --> 3:01:28.120]  I think humanity is in the initiative to win this.
[3:01:28.120 --> 3:01:29.120]  I don't know.
[3:01:29.120 --> 3:01:32.120]  When I look at the lockdown, I'm not sure that we're in control.
[3:01:32.120 --> 3:01:35.120]  I see the weakness of followers, David, but we're not followers.
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:36.120]  Yeah.
[3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:39.120]  I think that what we have to do is we've got to stop this lockdown.
[3:01:39.120 --> 3:01:40.120]  It is imperative to stop it now.
[3:01:40.120 --> 3:01:41.120]  No, I agree.
[3:01:41.120 --> 3:01:42.120]  This is the slave training for the future.
[3:01:42.120 --> 3:01:43.120]  Exactly.
[3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:48.120]  And if we don't stop that, we have lost because it's going to continue to go down into a greater depression.
[3:01:48.120 --> 3:01:51.120]  And then that's going to put more pressure on the politicians to start a war.
[3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:54.120]  No, no, I agree with you that the lockdown is their main assault.
[3:01:54.120 --> 3:01:57.120]  It's a non-military attack that is a military attack.
[3:01:57.120 --> 3:01:58.120]  Yeah.
[3:01:58.120 --> 3:02:02.120]  And the lockdown has established what the endpoint was going to look like.
[3:02:02.120 --> 3:02:04.120]  In other words, all the stuff that we've seen imposed on us...
[3:02:04.120 --> 3:02:05.120]  Exactly.
[3:02:05.120 --> 3:02:06.120]  They're putting victory...
[3:02:06.120 --> 3:02:07.120]  They put it right now.
[3:02:07.120 --> 3:02:08.120]  Victory up front.
[3:02:08.120 --> 3:02:09.120]  Exactly.
[3:02:09.120 --> 3:02:10.120]  And they're getting us conditioned to this.
[3:02:10.120 --> 3:02:13.120]  They may pull it back, but then they'll be able to put it back on again.
[3:02:13.120 --> 3:02:14.120]  Very sophisticated.
[3:02:14.120 --> 3:02:18.120]  Well, it's a real live Milgram experiment to see how people respond and react in these kind of circumstances.
[3:02:18.120 --> 3:02:21.120]  And they had far more success than they ever imagined.
[3:02:21.120 --> 3:02:25.120]  At the same time, the answer to evil people is always good people doing good things.
[3:02:25.120 --> 3:02:30.120]  So the fact and people resisted, people pushed back, people protested, people took action,
[3:02:30.120 --> 3:02:35.120]  people engaged in civil disobedience, and we often saw them capitulate and fold when that happened and occurred.
[3:02:35.120 --> 3:02:38.120]  So it shows the power of the individual spirit is far from dead.
[3:02:38.120 --> 3:02:39.120]  Well, exactly.
[3:02:39.120 --> 3:02:41.120]  Their attack, though, was so over-the-top and so reckless.
[3:02:41.120 --> 3:02:46.120]  We submit it up front because we weren't used to it, but we're getting a learning curve.
[3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:53.120]  I think it's very important that we get free speech back because you look at how effective this has been to the people who simply look at...
[3:02:53.120 --> 3:02:58.120]  Oh, I think the establishment that this isn't self-defeatist gets now,
[3:02:58.120 --> 3:03:00.120]  oh, wow, this is a real takeover.
[3:03:00.120 --> 3:03:01.120]  Yeah.
[3:03:01.120 --> 3:03:03.120]  I think they realized speech being cut out really was bad.
[3:03:03.120 --> 3:03:06.120]  Well, there's a lot of people who are willing to stand up and not comply,
[3:03:06.120 --> 3:03:10.120]  but there's a lot of people who are fully into this IOP.
[3:03:10.120 --> 3:03:11.120]  They really are.
[3:03:11.120 --> 3:03:12.120]  No doubt.
[3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:13.120]  Well, it's not called unite and conquer.
[3:03:13.120 --> 3:03:15.120]  It's called divide and conquer.
[3:03:15.120 --> 3:03:19.120]  And so once the lockdown did not achieve the full success that they wanted it to,
[3:03:19.120 --> 3:03:24.120]  once they weren't able to push the sort of new modern version of WMDs or incubator babies
[3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:28.120]  in exaggerating the scope and scale of the threat of this virus,
[3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:31.120]  and weren't able to get people to believe the lockdown even had any relationship to it,
[3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:34.120]  and large parts of the public refused and resisted,
[3:03:34.120 --> 3:03:39.120]  that's when now they've resorted to a backup strategy of other divisive form of politics
[3:03:39.120 --> 3:03:42.120]  where they have African Americans scared of every white person in the world
[3:03:42.120 --> 3:03:45.120]  between the Ahmaud Arbery case and the Minneapolis case.
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:49.120]  And now they're through the riots and making them appear to be race riots
[3:03:49.120 --> 3:03:52.120]  make white America scared of African Americans.
[3:03:52.120 --> 3:03:55.120]  Is their actions a sign of strength or weakness?
[3:03:55.120 --> 3:03:59.120]  A sign of weakness because they wouldn't be resorting to these kind of desperate, dangerous tactics.
[3:03:59.120 --> 3:04:02.120]  You don't unleash pandemics that you can't completely control.
[3:04:02.120 --> 3:04:03.120]  And race war.
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:05.120]  And you don't unleash race wars that you can't completely direct.
[3:04:05.120 --> 3:04:06.120]  Yeah, I mean, I respect you.
[3:04:06.120 --> 3:04:07.120]  You're a smart guy.
[3:04:07.120 --> 3:04:08.120]  And I get you're being pessimistic.
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:13.120]  It's good to be truthful about how bad we've gotten.
[3:04:13.120 --> 3:04:15.120]  But I mean, let me tell you, I see a lot of positive signs.
[3:04:15.120 --> 3:04:20.120]  I think it's very imperative at this point that we pay attention to what the next phase is.
[3:04:20.120 --> 3:04:24.120]  And that is the rollout of testing and contact tracing.
[3:04:24.120 --> 3:04:26.120]  And the secret police.
[3:04:26.120 --> 3:04:29.120]  And we're going to finally have the officers come to us.
[3:04:29.120 --> 3:04:30.120]  Well, it won't be cops.
[3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:33.120]  It'll be the model here is the Cuban system.
[3:04:33.120 --> 3:04:35.120]  So that's why they're using in Italy and other places.
[3:04:35.120 --> 3:04:36.120]  They wanted to do mass informants.
[3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:41.120]  That's why distazio in New York and in the good mayor of LA.
[3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:44.120]  How do you not beat the hell out of somebody coming to your house?
[3:04:44.120 --> 3:04:46.120]  Well, I mean, I think ordinary people just resisting.
[3:04:46.120 --> 3:04:48.120]  Or just don't talk to them.
[3:04:48.120 --> 3:04:55.120]  Yeah, you can. There's all kinds of ways of civil disobedience that can be very effective when you're within your constitutional and legal rights to do so.
[3:04:55.120 --> 3:04:56.120]  We've already seen it.
[3:04:56.120 --> 3:05:00.120]  The Dallas salon owner said she was going to open and what happened led to national outrage.
[3:05:00.120 --> 3:05:01.120]  I'm going to predict this now.
[3:05:01.120 --> 3:05:03.120]  I'm betting on humanity.
[3:05:03.120 --> 3:05:10.120]  I believe this Soviet New World Order Nazi attempt to suppress us will create the greatest bloom of resistance ever seen.
[3:05:10.120 --> 3:05:11.120]  I hope so.
[3:05:11.120 --> 3:05:14.120]  I hope they've gone too quickly and too far.
[3:05:14.120 --> 3:05:16.120]  And that's the key thing, you know, doing it gradually.
[3:05:16.120 --> 3:05:19.120]  This is why I remember they get a bunch of sheeple.
[3:05:19.120 --> 3:05:23.120]  There's all just because they get a bunch of people to how Hitler doesn't mean it's.
[3:05:23.120 --> 3:05:24.120]  Yeah.
[3:05:24.120 --> 3:05:31.120]  Oh, well, I think it's even more dangerous when you have a situation like we got here in Texas where the governor is putting $300 million into contact tracing.
[3:05:31.120 --> 3:05:37.120]  And and yet I think that's more dangerous than what's happening with Whitmer or with Cuomo or these other people because.
[3:05:37.120 --> 3:05:38.120]  No, I agree.
[3:05:38.120 --> 3:05:40.120]  Why is the governor doing that?
[3:05:40.120 --> 3:05:42.120]  It's a virtue signal.
[3:05:42.120 --> 3:05:43.120]  I don't know why he's doing it.
[3:05:43.120 --> 3:05:48.120]  Quite frankly, there's people on both sides, people who think that it needs to be done and people don't think that needs to be done.
[3:05:48.120 --> 3:05:51.120]  They're both questioning why this small company would get a $300 million contract.
[3:05:51.120 --> 3:05:54.120]  This company has a very tiny office in Texas.
[3:05:54.120 --> 3:05:58.120]  They're the ones doing contact tracing for New York, New Mexico, go to their office.
[3:05:58.120 --> 3:06:00.120]  Yeah, about 15, 16.
[3:06:00.120 --> 3:06:01.120]  Where are they located?
[3:06:01.120 --> 3:06:02.120]  Frisco, Texas.
[3:06:02.120 --> 3:06:03.120]  Oh, that's Frisco.
[3:06:03.120 --> 3:06:05.120]  That's a CIA operation.
[3:06:05.120 --> 3:06:07.120]  Oh, that's your funds limba.
[3:06:07.120 --> 3:06:08.120]  Probably.
[3:06:08.120 --> 3:06:09.120]  Yeah.
[3:06:09.120 --> 3:06:10.120]  No, I know they need to go there.
[3:06:10.120 --> 3:06:11.120]  Yeah.
[3:06:11.120 --> 3:06:12.120]  Yeah.
[3:06:12.120 --> 3:06:13.120]  Oh, fine.
[3:06:13.120 --> 3:06:14.120]  You go there, David.
[3:06:14.120 --> 3:06:15.120]  No, I'm serious.
[3:06:15.120 --> 3:06:16.120]  Sure.
[3:06:16.120 --> 3:06:17.120]  Yeah, we'll talk to him.
[3:06:17.120 --> 3:06:18.120]  Go there next week.
[3:06:18.120 --> 3:06:19.120]  Okay.
[3:06:19.120 --> 3:06:20.120]  He will do it for that.
[3:06:20.120 --> 3:06:21.120]  Yeah.
[3:06:21.120 --> 3:06:22.120]  All right.
[3:06:22.120 --> 3:06:24.120]  Robert Barnes, David Knight.
[3:06:24.120 --> 3:06:25.120]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:06:25.120 --> 3:06:28.120]  Coming up, Matt Bracken, former Navy Seal bestselling author.
[3:06:28.120 --> 3:06:35.120]  I'll tell you about all these things about having the riots and then the war room with Owen Schreuer, Savannah Hernandez and others straight ahead.
[3:06:35.120 --> 3:06:37.120]  God bless you all.
[3:06:37.120 --> 3:06:43.120]  We're living in insanely dangerous times.
[3:06:43.120 --> 3:06:49.120]  And I've told folks going back three months ago, I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[3:06:49.120 --> 3:06:52.120]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[3:06:52.120 --> 3:06:59.120]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States.
[3:06:59.120 --> 3:07:01.120]  And it's even worse in the third world.
[3:07:01.120 --> 3:07:10.120]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it, but with the election fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on.
[3:07:10.120 --> 3:07:14.120]  Now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years.
[3:07:14.120 --> 3:07:16.120]  They're in easily totable bags.
[3:07:16.120 --> 3:07:20.120]  It's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready.
[3:07:20.120 --> 3:07:21.120]  And it funds the InfoWars.
[3:07:21.120 --> 3:07:23.120]  So we have storeable food available again.

[3:07:45.120 --> 3:07:49.120]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[3:07:49.120 --> 3:07:54.120]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.

[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:25.120]  It's good to be back. What a conversation there. That's a couple of great minds when you can have Alex and David Knight and Robert Barnes.
[3:09:25.120 --> 3:09:32.120]  We're talking some pretty deep insights there. And then Torba of Gab coming in.
[3:09:32.120 --> 3:09:47.120]  I've been on Gab for a number of years now, and I just wanted to mention that if you haven't been there, say, in the last month, their platform has been just massively improved over the last couple of weeks.
[3:09:47.120 --> 3:09:58.120]  I mean, almost all the features that you'll find in Facebook or Twitter running just like that, very slick, very smooth operation.
[3:09:58.120 --> 3:10:03.120]  My hat's off. The engineers at Gab have done fantastic work.
[3:10:03.120 --> 3:10:28.120]  And Parler is also good, and I do encourage the president to start parallel posting on Gab and on Parler and possibly even just post links to his posts on Gab and elsewhere so that people that look for him on Twitter are just going to get a link over to Gab or Parler.
[3:10:28.120 --> 3:10:35.120]  If this happened, this would be like a 100 foot tsunami hitting social media.
[3:10:35.120 --> 3:10:49.120]  And I think that Trump, the showman, the master of ceremonies, the guy that really understands the ins and outs, I think of American psychology better than maybe anybody.
[3:10:49.120 --> 3:11:01.120]  For all of his flaws, he is obviously a bar room brawler, throws a lot of wild punches, but he is a fighter. But he's the guy that was running the apprentice.
[3:11:01.120 --> 3:11:10.120]  He knows timing. He knows how to tease an idea into being and then pull the rug out from underneath his enemies.
[3:11:10.120 --> 3:11:34.120]  And I think that's what he was doing, picking this fight with Scarborough, and which for whatever reason, instead of going after him on that, Dorsey at Twitter decided to start fact checking his mail-in ballot tweets, which obviously is setting up this entire battle over censorship on Twitter and Facebook,
[3:11:34.120 --> 3:11:46.120]  or as they like to call it, their curatorship. They're just trying to pick the best ideas for us peons to see, not censorship. It's being a curator.
[3:11:46.120 --> 3:11:57.120]  So anyway, we're in momentous times today. Obviously, currently, the big story is Minnesota, and more and more is coming out.
[3:11:57.120 --> 3:12:06.120]  It's getting deeper and deeper. It's possible that George Floyd and Derek Chauvin, the police officer, actually knew each other.
[3:12:06.120 --> 3:12:20.120]  They were both security guards at a club called El Nuevo Rodio Club, a Spanish nightclub, which is like two blocks from the precinct that was burned.
[3:12:20.120 --> 3:12:27.120]  It's around the corner from the Target and the Wendy's that were burned. They both worked there in 2019 for a year.
[3:12:27.120 --> 3:12:35.120]  Officer Chauvin was an outside off-duty officer security guy, and George Floyd was an inside security.
[3:12:35.120 --> 3:12:52.120]  It's hard for me to imagine that they didn't know each other, like a door bouncer and the outside officer. If these guys had a beef, and this took itself to the curbside justice level with the knee on the neck.
[3:12:52.120 --> 3:13:10.120]  I mean, just imagine this country is a tinderbox, and any random spark, like what might have been a personal beef between a bad cop. I mean, he had something like 20 complaints against him for excessive force violations, was never fired.
[3:13:10.120 --> 3:13:24.120]  He had 19 years, and I don't know how long he had to go to getting a pension, but I think he's going to be getting his pension in the hotel gray bar for a long time to come, and I don't envy his experience there.
[3:13:24.120 --> 3:13:37.120]  He'll probably have to be in protective custody. One of the things that's worrying me the most, now looking to tonight, Friday night in Minnesota, I watched the press conference with the governor and others today.
[3:13:37.120 --> 3:13:49.120]  The Minnesota National Guard Major General, he said that they are being issued weapons, which I assume means also live ammunition.
[3:13:49.120 --> 3:14:01.120]  And one question said they, you know, he didn't want to get into the rules of engagement, but he said that they will be able to, you know, use themselves to use self-defense.
[3:14:01.120 --> 3:14:13.120]  Then it all comes down to where will they be positioned. If they're on the outskirts, not blocking looters, if they're just in force in trucks, you know, far away from the action, it won't make any difference.
[3:14:13.120 --> 3:14:26.120]  But if they station, you know, National Guard and Humvees in the areas where the looting and the burning has been taking place, then we might see a use of force incident.
[3:14:26.120 --> 3:14:42.120]  And what's worrying me, I'm harking back now to four years ago in Dallas, there was a following Ferguson riots, there were riots in Dallas, they were turned into a march.
[3:14:42.120 --> 3:14:59.120]  The Black Lives Matter in Andifa did a march and a guy named, was his name, Micah Johnson, a 25-year-old, took a rifle up on a parking garage and he shot and killed five Dallas police officers and wounded others.
[3:14:59.120 --> 3:15:09.120]  He was specifically targeting white police officers. Eventually they sent a robot into this parking garage with a bomb on it and blew him up.
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:25.120]  This situation in Minnesota is so volatile now. You've got, you know, even though it's a liberal state, if you watch the press conference today, people were very upset that the police did not do anything last night, that the National Guard didn't even deploy.
[3:15:25.120 --> 3:15:33.120]  It's like, oh, it was dark. We didn't want to, we didn't want to show up in the dark. It was pretty scary, so we decided to wait for the next, for daylight.
[3:15:33.120 --> 3:15:43.120]  So the Minnesota National Guard sat out last night, even though they knew what was coming, people were very upset. They're going to want to see a stronger police reaction.
[3:15:43.120 --> 3:15:55.120]  And at the same time, you've got anarchists and antifas coming in from around the country, radicals. I've seen the graffiti spray painted, the anarchist A in the circle.
[3:15:55.120 --> 3:16:10.120]  So this is not just homegrown, you know, black people who are upset about the George Floyd death, but you've got people coming in from out of the out of the state to take advantage of this movement.
[3:16:10.120 --> 3:16:25.120]  And it won't be very hard to see a situation where somebody shoots at police or shoots at rioters, just to stoke a much larger explosion than what we've already seen.
[3:16:25.120 --> 3:16:33.120]  If you put a Dallas event on top of what we've, what's already happened, this is going to go completely out of control.
[3:16:33.120 --> 3:16:47.120]  In that case, they'll need to bring in a lot more than the Minnesota National Guard. You could see either a Kent State type of a situation where a National Guard troop does something stupid with a magazine load of ammo.
[3:16:47.120 --> 3:16:56.120]  I wouldn't expect anybody in the Minnesota National Guard to be issued a 30 round magazine with 30 rounds in it.
[3:16:56.120 --> 3:17:04.120]  I'll bet if they get issued live ammo at all, it's going to be maybe five rounds, one magazine each. And that's it.
[3:17:04.120 --> 3:17:10.120]  Enough for deterrence, but not really enough, you know, to cause total mayhem.
[3:17:10.120 --> 3:17:24.120]  But the potential for this going off the rails is enormous, because bad actors from all sides can just now lob a brick into this boiling cauldron, and it's going to explode all over the place.
[3:17:24.120 --> 3:17:29.120]  And when we come back, we'll talk about this in a minute.
[3:17:54.120 --> 3:18:02.120]  Through their arteries and through their veins, but all of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over and they die.
[3:18:02.120 --> 3:18:05.120]  Then you go back and haul them back in.
[3:18:05.120 --> 3:18:14.120]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now. And that's what the economic numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart.
[3:18:14.120 --> 3:18:19.120]  And for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[3:18:19.120 --> 3:18:24.120]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead, according to the UN, and I believe their numbers.
[3:18:24.120 --> 3:18:29.120]  Because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world.
[3:18:29.120 --> 3:18:50.120]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into something better than what Hitler did.
[3:19:00.120 --> 3:19:08.120]  And just this past Memorial Day, I took two of them, fell asleep about 1 a.m., woke up at 8 a.m., ready to go.
[3:19:08.120 --> 3:19:12.120]  It really has made a difference in my life and it can make a difference in your life too.
[3:19:12.120 --> 3:19:16.120]  If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch. If you get great sleep, you're going to be on point.
[3:19:16.120 --> 3:19:19.120]  You're going to be mentally focused. You're going to be ready to take on the day.
[3:19:19.120 --> 3:19:25.120]  And right now, knockout is 50% off. It's less than $15 a bottle. You get 30 capsules.

[3:20:39.120 --> 3:20:57.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:57.120 --> 3:21:26.120]  I just saw a couple of my book covers up, so I'll mention my books are all available in printed ebook on Kindle and audio book on Amazon Audible as well as you can get signed copies straight from me and cut Amazon out of the deal.
[3:21:26.120 --> 3:21:35.120]  This situation in Minnesota, it really is like a bubbling cauldron with steam and little pops and explosions coming out of it.
[3:21:35.120 --> 3:21:44.120]  This is when some really evil people can move in and for whatever reasons, whether they just want to see things burn.
[3:21:44.120 --> 3:21:54.120]  Some people just want to see things burn. Some people want to become famous in their own mind even for changing the course of history.
[3:21:54.120 --> 3:22:11.120]  It wouldn't take much. The first night of the riots, there was a group, they were called the armed rednecks in the mainstream media that were just like volunteers that kitted up with their hard plates and ARs and took up station.
[3:22:11.120 --> 3:22:33.120]  They even referenced the LA riots, rooftop Koreans. So you can see from the right and from the left, the left would be the antifa and anarchists, the black black guys coming into town to break windows and throw Molotov cocktails and fire big fireworks into stores and that cops.
[3:22:33.120 --> 3:22:43.120]  This is a situation that is fraught with peril to put it mildly. Then you've got the Minnesota National Guard on a very short leash.
[3:22:43.120 --> 3:22:53.120]  Everybody very afraid of what would happen if there was some sort of a Kent State situation, particularly at night, you know, with somebody lighten off a magazine.
[3:22:53.120 --> 3:23:04.120]  And in a situation like this, it would be especially easy to do a false flag operation, something that would be blamed on the armed redneck vigilantes, for example.
[3:23:04.120 --> 3:23:13.120]  And, you know, the mainstream media, all they need is a pretext for a narrative. It doesn't really matter what the facts of a case are.
[3:23:13.120 --> 3:23:26.120]  As we saw from the Russian collusion hoax, they're willing to run with lies as long as there's a, you know, barely plausible hook for a narrative, they'll run with it.
[3:23:26.120 --> 3:23:37.120]  So if there's a shooting in Minnesota, it'll be blamed on, you know, the white vigilantes and be used as an excuse to crack down on the Second Amendment.
[3:23:37.120 --> 3:23:45.120]  Now, fortunately, we don't have an Eric Holder or a Loretta Lynch in charge of the Justice Department.
[3:23:45.120 --> 3:23:55.120]  Now we have Robert Barr. And there's a part of the U.S. Code called U.S. Code 2001.
[3:23:55.120 --> 3:24:10.120]  Excuse me, 2101, 18 U.S.C. 2101. And it's the Riot Act. Anybody that comes to Minnesota and is arrested rioting could face some pretty serious federal time.
[3:24:10.120 --> 3:24:20.120]  And under, you know, Loretta Lynch or Eric Holder, it wouldn't have mattered. They would have been given medals, you know, and probably a plane ticket to and from in a hotel room.
[3:24:20.120 --> 3:24:26.120]  But under, in the Barr Justice Department, these guys could face some serious time.
[3:24:26.120 --> 3:24:36.120]  So anybody who's considering crossing state lines, you know, to fire fireworks at police or throw Molotov cocktails, they could be facing real hard time.
[3:24:36.120 --> 3:24:43.120]  Federal time, there's no probation. You do it all. You do like 90% minimum.
[3:24:43.120 --> 3:24:50.120]  But there are people, I think, that are willing to do this. And it's something that all sides have to be on alert for.
[3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:57.120]  Personally, stay away from riots, you know, stay away from large crowds, pandemic or not.
[3:24:57.120 --> 3:25:04.120]  I want to, I want to switch gears from Minnesota a little bit and talk about the state of our country.
[3:25:04.120 --> 3:25:15.120]  I think that the deep state is extremely concerned now. The worm has turned. It's, you know, justice is grinding very slowly, but it's grinding.
[3:25:15.120 --> 3:25:23.120]  We saw with the US attorney named Jensen, he's the one that was looking into the Flynn situation.
[3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:37.120]  Well, there's also Durham in Connecticut, building the bigger case, and another US attorney has been assigned to look into all the unmasking, which is going to be very embarrassing for a lot of Democrats and for some Republicans,
[3:25:37.120 --> 3:25:48.120]  because they're going to be seen as colluding in this coup, in this silent coup against Trump. All of these players now are going to be unmasked.
[3:25:48.120 --> 3:25:58.120]  The unmaskers shall be unmasked. Next week, Rod Rosenstein is going before the Senate. Some of the questioning is going to be very difficult.
[3:25:58.120 --> 3:26:06.120]  How many times did he talk to Mueller before naming Mueller as the, as the, as the special counsel?
[3:26:06.120 --> 3:26:21.120]  So not to, not to get into this too deeply, but the deep state actors that were perpetrating this coup before the election of Trump, and for the three years after trying to kneecap him and sabotage him.
[3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:29.120]  They're going to face justice. Some of them can go to jail. A lot of these people are not going to do a G Gordon Liddy and go to jail quietly.
[3:26:29.120 --> 3:26:38.120]  They're going to say I was following orders and it's going to go up and up the chain of command to the Comey Brennan clapper and then Obama level.
[3:26:38.120 --> 3:26:48.120]  So these people are freaking out and they would absolutely love nothing more than to create conditions of total mayhem and chaos in this country.
[3:26:48.120 --> 3:27:00.120]  And they're also going to continue the lockdown as much as they can in the blue states, hoping to continue to stifle the economy, thinking that this is going to hurt Trump in November.
[3:27:00.120 --> 3:27:10.120]  I think that's going to have a completely backwards effect. I think that all the middle class small entrepreneurs, they're blaming their Democrat politicians.
[3:27:10.120 --> 3:27:26.120]  They're not blaming Trump. They're blaming the Democrat politicians. But they're going to keep this entire coronavirus panic going because what they really want, the big game here is the mail in national election.
[3:27:26.120 --> 3:27:40.120]  They want to do what they've been doing in California and mail ballots to every registered voter in the last century living or dead at every possible old address that they've got.
[3:27:40.120 --> 3:28:03.120]  Just flood the country with mail in ballots and then harvest them en masse. They're just going to be bringing in truckloads of ballots and dumping them out. And no matter who wins in November, it's going to put the entire election into under a cloud of doubt as to whether it's legitimate or not.
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:15.120]  This is the deep state. These are the globalists going for broke, actually trying to discredit an American election. If they can't win it, they want to discredit it.
[3:28:15.120 --> 3:28:34.120]  And we see in Minnesota, the pot is being stirred to the point where we could have a hot summer of riots across the country. In 1968, when Martin Luther King was killed, it spread from city to city until about a dozen cities were burning the way we've seen Minneapolis.
[3:28:34.120 --> 3:28:48.120]  So this can continue. This isn't by any means over. And all it's going to take is somebody firing into a crowd of policemen or a crowd of protesters who wants this to go up in order of magnitude.
[3:28:48.120 --> 3:29:08.120]  And the globalists, the deep staters, they are in a panic about their high ranking members literally going to prison for what they did against Trump before and after the election. And they would rather see this country in flames than go down like that.
[3:29:08.120 --> 3:29:28.120]  They would rather see this country in flames. This is the stage in the poker game where the lights go out and the table gets knocked over. All bets are off. We've got a pandemic going on, an economic lockdown that's just crippling people's businesses and livelihoods.
[3:29:28.120 --> 3:29:50.120]  We've got the country divided between the masks and the no masks, the lockdowns and the defying lockdown people. And it's going to come to a head. And we can't, Trump can't even have rallies because we can't put all the people into an arena that close at this point in our understanding of this virus.
[3:29:50.120 --> 3:30:08.120]  So now we're going for other options like these flotillas, the trump tillers, other ways of showing support where you don't have to get people that close together. But at least for the time being, all eyes are going to be on Minneapolis because you've got Minnesota,
[3:30:08.120 --> 3:30:27.120]  Minneapolis police, state police, National Guard, antifuzz, armed blacks, armed whites, and it's not going to take much to send this entire boiling pot right across the floor to burn everybody's feet.
[3:30:27.120 --> 3:30:36.120]  And I'm going to get back to this just in the other side of this break. This is some momentous days we're coming into.
[3:30:36.120 --> 3:30:44.120]  Memorial Day is here. It's one of the biggest sales of the year. And we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[3:30:44.120 --> 3:30:55.120]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale. And then five items that weren't on sale, we got back in stock. They're also massively discounted as well for the Memorial Day special.
[3:30:55.120 --> 3:31:07.120]  So here it is, super male vitality, 40% off. Knockout, the great sleeping, 50% off. Brainforce Plus hadn't been on sale for almost six months. It is 50% off. Biodrassilinium, 60% off.
[3:31:07.120 --> 3:31:23.120]  Shaleforge, it's incredible. 60% off. And you've got all these other items on sale as well until they sell out. So infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine to get these items to take advantage of this mega sale Memorial Day.

[3:31:53.120 --> 3:32:09.120]  Many will submit through fear. Others will be bought off. But in the end, the globalists submit they're building a post human world. And now that we're inside the cage, it's going to move very, very quickly into its end game.
[3:32:09.120 --> 3:32:27.120]  Submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this. This is your dignity, your soul, your future being born inside out.
[3:32:27.120 --> 3:32:37.120]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfish, disgusting power trip.
[3:32:37.120 --> 3:32:47.120]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[3:32:47.120 --> 3:33:03.120]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date. Super male vitality specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[3:33:03.120 --> 3:33:21.120]  This unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives. Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology working together in perfect
[3:33:21.120 --> 3:33:37.120]  sacredicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula. So what are you waiting for? Go to the infor store. Never been a better time than right now. Super male vitality at inforstore.com.
[3:33:37.120 --> 3:33:53.120]  The United States is not communist China. We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps. We don't blow up churches. We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs. But all of the news we see the U.N. billable indicates W.A.H.O.
[3:33:53.120 --> 3:34:11.120]  mainstream corporate media praising communist China for their response. And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and asks robots controlling people, well then gee, we've got to do that. And on top of it, cities like San Antonio pass laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese virus.
[3:34:11.120 --> 3:34:25.120]  Well now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus. These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab.
[3:34:25.120 --> 3:34:43.120]  The resistance lives at band.video.infowars.com. Spread those links and jam it down the censor's throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker.
[3:34:55.120 --> 3:35:10.120]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[3:35:10.120 --> 3:35:34.120]  When there's a crisis in underway, it's easy to just focus down on it and just study Minnesota as if it's just a unique event or maybe a follow on to Ferguson and Baltimore and other events like that, even going back to the L.A. Riots or Martin Luther King Riots.
[3:35:34.120 --> 3:35:50.120]  But there's a, you have to force yourself to focus, pull the focus back out and look even beyond national and look global because we're not the only country in the middle of a crisis right now.
[3:35:50.120 --> 3:36:13.120]  There is truly a global crisis right now, even before this pandemic, in economic terms, but with this pandemic on top of everything else, countries from Brazil to Russia are struggling with this thing and we're not through with it.
[3:36:13.120 --> 3:36:27.120]  It would be nice to say we're just past it. South Korea has tried to, has done about as good as any country could. They had breakouts after nightclubs were opened. They opened schools back up and now they're closed again.
[3:36:27.120 --> 3:36:41.120]  So it's, it's glib to just say, hey, you know, it's all a hoax and we can just ignore it. We can't ignore it, but nor can we allow this, you know, lockdown panic to keep us shut in our houses and turn us into slaves.
[3:36:41.120 --> 3:37:02.120]  We have to learn how to live with this thing that China unleashed and China did unleash this thing, whether they did it intentionally, or accidentally, or accidentally on purpose by having very lax and unprofessional standards in their, in their Wuhan P4 Virological Institute.
[3:37:02.120 --> 3:37:21.120]  They let it out. And once they let it out, they let it spread to the rest of the world. They could have fallen on the hand grenade, so to speak, and the world would have been appreciative if they had said we're locking down China and Wuhan and warned the country even back last December when they knew what was going on.
[3:37:21.120 --> 3:37:37.120]  They completely knew what was going on, but they didn't. So once they decided to lock down China, but allow the flights to the rest of the world, they turned the corona of this COVID-19 into a bio weapon against the war.
[3:37:37.120 --> 3:37:49.120]  And I want to talk a little bit about parallels that I see between the 1930s and Japan and the 2020s in China.
[3:37:49.120 --> 3:38:01.120]  And you can even roll Nazi Germany into it because, in my opinion, China has turned from being a Marxist Leninist country that it started out under Mao.
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:14.120]  It went through just an authoritarian phase. Now it's going into a national socialist phase. Even the even Hong Kong Chinese and Taiwanese, they're saying what's happening in the mainland.
[3:38:14.120 --> 3:38:28.120]  They're not Chinese communists anymore. They're Chinese Nazis. They're building up their national racial, the Han Chinese identity as like a superman, really smart.
[3:38:28.120 --> 3:38:34.120]  We deserve to run the world. And in some ways, this is worse than the 1930s.
[3:38:34.120 --> 3:38:54.120]  Yeah, in the 1930s, we had a lot of communist fifth columnists in the U.S. and in Europe, but nothing like today where universities have been basically turned into communist training grounds under the rubric of social justice warriors.
[3:38:54.120 --> 3:39:05.120]  You know, but it's hate America. America stands for evil. And so many of these colleges to get the dollar from the Chai Kong government who was paying for these students.
[3:39:05.120 --> 3:39:17.120]  We have our universities full of essentially Chinese communist agents. They come to learn the technology, but they also come to learn our country.
[3:39:17.120 --> 3:39:28.120]  They come to commit espionage. They even have Chinese intel officers, in my opinion, and in the opinion of others.
[3:39:28.120 --> 3:39:38.120]  They actually have them do training exercises in our country, knowing that we're such a non serious country that there won't be any bad consequences.
[3:39:38.120 --> 3:39:49.120]  A couple of months ago, they had a couple of quote unquote Chinese students infiltrate the Navy base in Key West all the way into the communication site.
[3:39:49.120 --> 3:39:59.120]  And knowing once they're caught, they just be slapped on the wrist and sent home. And I'm sure when they got back to China, they went back to their Intel Officer Training Academy,
[3:39:59.120 --> 3:40:08.120]  had, you know, celebrations all around high fives, you know, where they can tell all the other students in Intel Officer Training.
[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:17.120]  America is a joke. It's wide open. You can do anything. You can sneak right into their secure bases and nothing will happen to you.
[3:40:17.120 --> 3:40:26.120]  So this is this is all part of what Americans have to come to grasp with, which is something that the Chinese call unrestricted warfare.
[3:40:26.120 --> 3:40:32.120]  You've heard of this, it was written in 1999 by a couple of Chinese Communist colonels.
[3:40:32.120 --> 3:40:41.120]  But unrestricted warfare to the Chinese means kinetic warfare, like Pearl Harbor, that is the last resort.
[3:40:41.120 --> 3:40:50.120]  They want to win. It's sort of like Sun Tzu, you know, know your enemy. If your enemy doesn't know himself and you know your enemy, you're going to win every time.
[3:40:50.120 --> 3:40:59.120]  You know, win without even having to fight a battle. So under unrestricted warfare, they'll use propaganda. They'll use bribery.
[3:40:59.120 --> 3:41:09.120]  They'll use what they call lawfare. You know, while you can use these international organizations and force us to, like Alinsky,
[3:41:09.120 --> 3:41:16.120]  force us to obey the letter of the law of all of these international agreements while they break them all.
[3:41:16.120 --> 3:41:28.120]  And even to the point where we've seen them use biological warfare, because that's what it is when they sent it to the world while they restricted it within China.
[3:41:28.120 --> 3:41:38.120]  It was it was biological warfare. And something that really upsets me is that we have this pandemic in our country.
[3:41:38.120 --> 3:41:46.120]  And instead of being angry at the people that launched it at us, the Chinese communists, we turn against each other.
[3:41:46.120 --> 3:41:51.120]  So from the Chinese perspective, think about how brilliant this is, how perfect this is.
[3:41:51.120 --> 3:41:58.120]  When when the Japanese launched Pearl Harbor attacks, it unified us against them.
[3:41:58.120 --> 3:42:03.120]  Four years later, we dropped an atom bomb on Hiroshima, utterly defeating them.
[3:42:03.120 --> 3:42:13.120]  The Chinese drop a biological bomb on America, and we attack each other. We go at each other's throats.
[3:42:13.120 --> 3:42:18.120]  So I mean, from their point of view, think about how brilliant that is.
[3:42:18.120 --> 3:42:28.120]  If you can divide your enemy, if you can cause your enemy to fight within itself, then you may not even have to go to war, a kinetic war,
[3:42:28.120 --> 3:42:36.120]  because your enemy is going to fall on its own under its own weight. So think about this all as unrestricted warfare.
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:46.120]  Sun Tzu for the 2020s. This is what China is doing. They are doing a full court press in every area, you know, all around the world.
[3:42:46.120 --> 3:42:51.120]  I wish I had a good map of this, but I haven't been able to find one because it's mostly written here and there.
[3:42:51.120 --> 3:43:02.120]  The Chinese have hundreds of major construction projects going on all around the world, particularly in Southeast Asia and in Africa.
[3:43:02.120 --> 3:43:12.120]  They have literally hundreds of thousands of quote unquote construction workers spread all over Africa and Southeast Asia,
[3:43:12.120 --> 3:43:22.120]  working in giant projects, living in barracks under military conditions. And I can promise you, as a former special warfare officer,
[3:43:22.120 --> 3:43:33.120]  anywhere that there are 500 Chinese workers, there is a platoon of Chinese SEALs, and there is a platoon of intel officers.
[3:43:33.120 --> 3:43:43.120]  They now have the ability across Africa. It's been in the news recently that they're building buildings out of their goodness of their heart for these African governments,
[3:43:43.120 --> 3:43:49.120]  but they're completely infested with bugs and eavesdropping equipment.
[3:43:49.120 --> 3:43:57.120]  Well, they're not only doing that, they are bribing and threatening politicians across the third world.
[3:43:57.120 --> 3:44:07.120]  Now, with now having spread their pandemic, having spread their bio weapon, they're coming into countries like the Philippines with rescue packages,
[3:44:07.120 --> 3:44:16.120]  where they're going to help these third world countries recover from the biological weapon that they unleashed.
[3:44:16.120 --> 3:44:25.120]  And the help is going to come in the form of aid packages and loans that these countries will never be able to pay back.
[3:44:25.120 --> 3:44:36.120]  And if we ever do go into a kinetic war, the Chinese already have hundreds of thousands of troops distributed around the world in place.
[3:44:36.120 --> 3:44:41.120]  I mean, this is something that the Japanese could never have dreamed of in the 1930s.
[3:44:41.120 --> 3:44:52.120]  And meanwhile, our country is completely disunited at each other's throats, and we can't even identify the enemy.
[3:44:52.120 --> 3:44:59.120]  And the globalists, they see China as a way of wrecking the USA and the West.
[3:44:59.120 --> 3:45:06.120]  China sees the globalists as useful idiots to help weaken and cripple the West.
[3:45:06.120 --> 3:45:11.120]  But together, they're formidable, the globalists and the Chinese communists.
[3:45:11.120 --> 3:45:21.120]  And we've got to see what's going on and get over our inflighting and our own civil war because the real war is coming.
[3:45:21.120 --> 3:45:24.120]  China is coming!
