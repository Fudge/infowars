[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the
[00:14.240 --> 00:17.080]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:17.080 --> 00:25.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this August 13, 2019 global broadcast.
[00:25.920 --> 00:31.400]  I am your host, Alex Jones, riding shotgun with Owen Troyer, and we're going to be here
[00:31.400 --> 00:36.280]  for the next four hours broadcasting, covering all the huge global developments.
[00:36.280 --> 00:42.440]  Now, yes, the Epstein developments are stratospheric, there's nothing like it that has woken more
[00:42.440 --> 00:43.440]  people up.
[00:43.440 --> 00:47.280]  We're going to be covering that coming up in about 12 minutes.
[00:47.280 --> 00:51.160]  But first off, the United States really is at war with China.
[00:51.160 --> 00:54.680]  We've been in a proxy war for many years, the globalists, the Democrats particularly,
[00:54.680 --> 01:00.520]  but along with the neocons, set it up where we were deindustrialized and where everything
[01:00.520 --> 01:04.680]  was shipped to China and where it was set up, where they would economically dominate us,
[01:04.680 --> 01:07.600]  where they bought up our debt, they bought up Hollywood.
[01:07.600 --> 01:12.120]  And there's been really no news coverage of this, but now it's all starting to come out.
[01:12.120 --> 01:15.440]  We've been exposing this for really 20 years.
[01:15.440 --> 01:20.680]  The handover of the Panama Canal, all the deep ports, the infrastructure, the control over
[01:20.680 --> 01:27.440]  rare earth minerals, anybody else, US companies, Russian companies, try to go in and get rare
[01:27.440 --> 01:32.080]  earth minerals anywhere, international courts come after them, the CIA comes after them.
[01:32.080 --> 01:37.520]  So China has been positioned to absolutely manipulate currencies, be given all of our
[01:37.520 --> 01:43.320]  weapons secrets, just to be set up to take over in the 21st century, which the Council
[01:43.320 --> 01:46.160]  on Foreign Relations and the Globalists have openly bragged about.
[01:46.160 --> 01:52.480]  What was left of the British Empire, that took over the US after World War I, now is
[01:52.480 --> 01:55.320]  done with the US and is moving on to China.
[01:55.320 --> 02:00.520]  I want to be clear, that is not the British people, that is not the people of Ireland
[02:00.520 --> 02:02.160]  or Scotland or the UK.
[02:02.160 --> 02:06.200]  That is the globalists that sucked off those people, built an empire, then it moved on
[02:06.200 --> 02:09.520]  to the US to sock off us to build a corporate empire.
[02:09.520 --> 02:13.840]  Now it's moving on to China to bring in its final world government.
[02:13.840 --> 02:18.280]  We've had Peter Thiel come out again on Fox Business and lay it all out next segment,
[02:18.280 --> 02:22.800]  I'm going to play a clip of it, and say we're really at war with China and that there are
[02:22.800 --> 02:29.720]  post-nationalists in America that are working with China and that Google and Apple and others
[02:29.720 --> 02:32.040]  have moved there and are working against us.
[02:32.040 --> 02:38.040]  Well, Thiel is a Bilderberg insider, he's been in the globalist ranks, he's been a libertarian,
[02:38.040 --> 02:42.560]  he's been pro-nationalist at many levels, so we've always said that we weren't sure
[02:42.560 --> 02:45.760]  he was a good guy or a bad guy because they were trying to bring in the new generation
[02:45.760 --> 02:51.000]  of people to join them and not everybody that's part of these globalist systems is actually
[02:51.000 --> 02:52.760]  for it, they've been working against it.
[02:52.760 --> 03:02.040]  More and more Thiel shows that that is exactly what he's doing, but China invaded as you
[03:02.040 --> 03:08.440]  know with plain clothes, police and military on thousands of motorcycles last month into
[03:08.440 --> 03:12.200]  Hong Kong, they're threatening to physically invade Taiwan, they're threatening to physically
[03:12.200 --> 03:18.320]  invade with regular army and navy forces, this is a powder keg in the South China Sea
[03:18.320 --> 03:27.600]  and so now this is really reaching a head, it's really coming to a flash point because
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.600]  even more troops and more plain clothes have poured in the last three days and are viciously
[03:32.600 --> 03:37.640]  attacking demonstrators all over Hong Kong, this intimidation didn't work, men, women
[03:37.640 --> 03:43.840]  and children being beaten with these metal clubs, having their heads split open, their
[03:43.840 --> 03:49.560]  bodies split open, some people have been killed, now they're reporting many, many, many times
[03:49.560 --> 03:53.600]  who are already out demonstrating, tens of thousands before is now hundreds of thousands,
[03:53.600 --> 03:57.800]  some are saying millions, taking over airports, taking over government buildings, taking
[03:57.800 --> 04:02.880]  over anything that the Chai comms have been in control of and even mainstream news admits
[04:02.880 --> 04:12.680]  communist China has miscalculated in a big, big way, communist China has absolutely thought
[04:12.680 --> 04:17.160]  that they could bully and intimidate folks in Hong Kong who've already been pushed to
[04:17.160 --> 04:21.200]  the brink, who are now learning their businesses can be taken with no due process, they can
[04:21.200 --> 04:26.400]  be arrested and extradited to the mainland to disappear to a slave gulag, that's what
[04:26.400 --> 04:31.480]  the government that's working with the Chinese is doing, selling out what's left of the Hong
[04:31.480 --> 04:37.600]  Kong freedom, so instead of going to that long, dark night, they are saying no and they
[04:37.600 --> 04:44.040]  are fighting back and it is absolutely amazing and the bathing of American flags, it's just
[04:44.040 --> 04:50.920]  incredible seeing America as a symbol of freedom, we come back, feel on this and so much more
[04:50.920 --> 04:55.280]  then shift gears to the biggest news yet, Jeffrey Epstein has heard streaking and fighting
[04:55.280 --> 05:00.440]  for his life, yes, clearly all evidence points to where it was strangled.
[05:00.440 --> 05:05.800]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com
[05:05.800 --> 05:10.440]  but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com and there's one product that's offered at
[05:10.440 --> 05:15.800]  InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force Plus.
[05:15.800 --> 05:19.800]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[05:19.800 --> 05:25.000]  Telomere's and Telomere's support with your DNA and so I started to look into the science
[05:25.000 --> 05:31.240]  and what Telomere's were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect
[05:31.240 --> 05:32.240]  your Telomere's.
[05:32.240 --> 05:35.920]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but it's expensive, why?
[05:35.920 --> 05:40.800]  Because it is an elite supplement and then I started seeing other competitors coming
[05:40.800 --> 05:46.560]  up with competitive supplements for Telomere's support and they came and they went but DNA
[05:46.560 --> 05:48.840]  Force Plus is still there.
[05:48.840 --> 05:53.360]  It is the elite supplement, I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know
[05:53.360 --> 06:00.040]  it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsStore.com.
[06:23.360 --> 06:27.280]  After happening across this world, we're building towards this massive quickening, Alex Jones
[06:27.280 --> 06:35.040]  here again riding shotgun with Owen Schreuer, such huge global events, China has miscalculated
[06:35.040 --> 06:39.520]  with Hong Kong and Taiwan and with the US taking over much of the South China Sea now
[06:39.520 --> 06:44.920]  using paramilitary to take over Hong Kong, they thought that they could intimidate all
[06:44.920 --> 06:48.240]  of the people, they thought that they could drive them into submission, that's caused
[06:48.240 --> 06:54.040]  the protests to grow exponentially, second day of the International Airport and completely
[06:54.040 --> 06:58.120]  shut down and there are large throngs of the hundreds of thousands or even millions of
[06:58.120 --> 07:02.480]  different demonstrators popping up everywhere that are waving American flags.
[07:02.480 --> 07:07.480]  It's truly a beautiful moment where now the world sees America as it used to be, a beacon
[07:07.480 --> 07:11.840]  of liberty and freedom, not a beacon of tyranny, backing up the Chai comms, taking over the
[07:11.840 --> 07:16.000]  planet, backing up all these other groups and there was an intriguing interview with
[07:16.000 --> 07:22.320]  Tucker Carlson a month ago with Peter Thiel and Peter Thiel came out and said, look, big
[07:22.320 --> 07:26.240]  companies don't like America, they're globalists, they were trained to do it, it's the Chinese
[07:26.240 --> 07:31.920]  century, they're all moving to China, Apple, Google, they should be investigated for espionage
[07:31.920 --> 07:37.120]  and now he's come out and said the truth again, again billionaire tech investor, he says
[07:37.120 --> 07:42.240]  that there are host nationalists in the West in America that don't like our country existing,
[07:42.240 --> 07:48.000]  that say it was never great, never be great, like Chris Cuomo's brother and the governor
[07:48.000 --> 07:55.600]  of New York and that these post-nationalists, that's what globalists are, they are working
[07:55.600 --> 08:02.000]  with China to carry all this out, this is such a huge deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:02.000 --> 08:08.320]  And so let's go ahead and go to a few minutes of this interview, the full Fox Business Interview
[08:08.320 --> 08:14.000]  is on infowars.com, in a critical Steve Watson article, Paul Joseph Watson's great brother,
[08:14.800 --> 08:20.720]  and it's so important to get that article out to everyone you know, so the information is
[08:20.720 --> 08:27.280]  there so Americans know who the true threat is, here it is. It's quite significant that China's
[08:27.280 --> 08:33.040]  intelligence agencies have been seeding people into American companies, I want to ask you about
[08:33.040 --> 08:38.400]  what's going on in Silicon Valley in terms of espionage, in terms of what's happening with
[08:38.400 --> 08:44.480]  Chinese nationals working within our companies, there are Confucius Institutes in Silicon Valley
[08:44.480 --> 08:50.080]  right by Stanford University, what's your take on all of that? Well this gets very speculative,
[08:51.040 --> 08:55.280]  it certainly would be odd if there wasn't something like this going on and again to use,
[08:55.280 --> 09:01.280]  to zero in on the Google example where the AI deep mind effort was described by its own founder
[09:01.280 --> 09:07.040]  as a Manhattan Project for AI, and so even though this was meant as probably marketing hyperbole
[09:07.040 --> 09:13.760]  in a way, I think that people outside the US might very well take that literally, and so if you
[09:13.760 --> 09:20.720]  go around saying here's the Manhattan Project for AI, pay attention world, I think that would
[09:20.720 --> 09:25.440]  attract the attention of foreign governments, foreign intelligence agencies, and I think in
[09:25.440 --> 09:31.200]  particular the question about Chinese interest in this is one that needs to be looked at much
[09:31.200 --> 09:36.720]  more carefully and that's why I've argued that the FBI or the CIA should be looking at this.
[09:36.720 --> 09:40.960]  Do you get pressure because you've supported President Trump? Well yeah, there's a lot of
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.600]  questions there, so I think there's always an inside and an outside question, the outside
[09:45.600 --> 09:52.560]  question is what are these companies doing with China, are they censoring speech, and the Twitter
[09:52.560 --> 09:57.680]  McConnell thing, you could say it's an innocent accident or is it an intentional act of political
[09:57.680 --> 10:04.720]  sabotage, which of the two is it? And I think one of the reasons the Republicans are so skeptical
[10:05.920 --> 10:12.160]  of the excuses big tech has for these repeated accidents is that the inside story is not good
[10:12.160 --> 10:17.120]  because on the inside Twitter is not a company where you have lots of people writing checks to
[10:17.120 --> 10:22.640]  Senator McConnell. If you had a lot of campaign donations from Senator McConnell, we might say,
[10:22.640 --> 10:27.520]  well to Senator McConnell, we might say this is sort of an innocent mistake and we won't complain
[10:27.520 --> 10:35.200]  about it too much, that's not what's actually what's actually going on. And it has sort of
[10:35.200 --> 10:43.120]  this the feel of a very unhealthy one-party state in a way that's not good for Silicon Valley or
[10:43.120 --> 10:47.760]  for the politics of this country generally. I mean the president can't even have a fundraiser
[10:47.760 --> 10:54.560]  without the people getting bullied about that fundraiser. It's gone, I mean it's actually,
[10:54.560 --> 10:59.920]  it's crazy, it's the real Trump derangement thing to him happening. And it is, it is always,
[10:59.920 --> 11:06.240]  you know, I'm sort of the main outspoken supporter of President Trump inside Silicon
[11:06.240 --> 11:10.480]  Valley. There are many other people in Silicon Valley who support the president, but they're not
[11:10.480 --> 11:16.960]  going to say it. And so that's, that's always the problem. Unanimity doesn't mean that everybody
[11:16.960 --> 11:25.680]  agrees. It normally just means that everybody is too scared to speak up. There you go. Everybody
[11:25.680 --> 11:32.240]  else is just too scared to speak up. That's what all the bullying is about. The left ones say one
[11:32.240 --> 11:38.080]  party state, they've been promised incredible power. Coming up later if I have time, I'm going to show
[11:38.080 --> 11:45.200]  you the Twitter account of a well-known leftist comedian who saw me at the pool and then she
[11:45.200 --> 11:49.680]  dreams about coming up and confronting me. And then her Twitter supporters dream about violently
[11:49.680 --> 11:55.600]  kicking me down the stairs, stepping on my hand when my hand's outside the pool. I've had leftists
[11:55.600 --> 12:01.440]  do that before that happened to me in Hawaii two years ago and physically attacking me. And then
[12:01.440 --> 12:06.800]  they say, we can't believe that there was a woman and children with him. Who are those people? Oh,
[12:06.800 --> 12:10.720]  I know my children were taken away from me, the media said. None of that's true either.
[12:10.720 --> 12:18.080]  So again, you've got this hunchback hag, pissed I've got a beautiful wife and beautiful children.
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.200]  She also says, I look like a pedophile. Hey lady, that's your political party.
[12:24.960 --> 12:29.920]  Tweets, I'm going to show it later about time. It's just to experience the left,
[12:29.920 --> 12:35.360]  to be Trump or like an Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson, what you experience is just
[12:35.360 --> 12:41.040]  unbelievable because you shake 50 hands, but that 50th person says, I'm going to kill you.
[12:42.320 --> 12:46.240]  So I have to walk around with security and I want to go out. People say, well,
[12:46.240 --> 12:48.880]  just, you know, you shouldn't go out. You should just hide somewhere. No, I'm not hiding,
[12:48.880 --> 12:52.400]  ladies and gentlemen. We're the majority. Plus, we're in the right. We're not backing down. Now,
[12:52.400 --> 12:58.320]  let me stop right there. We're going to break in just a few minutes. And so when we come back,
[12:58.320 --> 13:08.640]  start your engines, ladies and gentlemen, start your engines because the information that's
[13:08.640 --> 13:15.440]  coming on Epstein is more ham-fisted, more insane, more over the top, more crazy than I could even
[13:15.440 --> 13:24.400]  believe. CBS News is reporting exactly what you'd expect. The inmates next door heard him shrieking
[13:24.400 --> 13:31.040]  basically and begging and the guards, one who didn't work there, brought in separately suddenly
[13:31.040 --> 13:36.560]  that day with the lights turned off, cameras turned off, and the other guards told go home
[13:36.560 --> 13:42.480]  early. This is all confirmed. And as they go in, he begins screaming and they say, oh, breathe,
[13:42.480 --> 13:47.200]  breathe, fight for your life. And I agree with Tim Poole in his analysis because he, when I read
[13:47.200 --> 13:50.560]  Paul's headline about screeching and yelling and them saying, breathe, breathe, I thought, oh,
[13:50.560 --> 13:55.440]  that's them strangling him. And he's saying, breathe, breathe. Well, then Tim Poole, as I read
[13:55.440 --> 13:59.040]  the articles, like being quoted, so you could just, I mean, this is just standard. You're not
[13:59.040 --> 14:02.960]  choking yourself, screaming and yelling, okay? And then people run in and say, oh, breathe, breathe,
[14:02.960 --> 14:06.480]  that's not even a procedure. You just check the neck and try to breathe in their mouth or whatever.
[14:07.760 --> 14:12.800]  Okay, maybe all these weird coincidences have happened, all lined up and it's right after the
[14:12.800 --> 14:17.280]  documents come out and, you know, all the procedures and default positions are turned off.
[14:17.280 --> 14:20.800]  He's taken off suicide watch. He's put in a room alone. They're not supposed to do. You can't kill
[14:20.800 --> 14:24.720]  yourself with the sheets because they're too thin. They're like paper on and on and on. And then
[14:24.720 --> 14:30.080]  magically the jail guards brought in, they didn't even work there. And then they go in and then they
[14:30.080 --> 14:35.920]  tell the other guards go and don't do the 30 minute checks. And then all of a sudden, oh, breathe,
[14:35.920 --> 14:40.480]  breathe. And then he's taken out and he's dead. Pretty amazing. I'm going to cover it all and
[14:40.480 --> 14:46.320]  come back from break. But remember, we can't finance this operation. If it isn't for you,
[14:46.320 --> 14:50.560]  if it isn't for you, and we're changing the world right now, I cannot tell you the people that have
[14:50.560 --> 14:56.080]  called me, the support I've gotten, the apologies I've gotten on Twitter, on Facebook, in phone calls.
[14:56.080 --> 15:00.240]  A lot of famous people have called me. A lot of famous, well-known people who are on the left,
[15:00.240 --> 15:04.400]  I guess who I have a soul, have come out and said, okay, we apologize to Alex Jones.
[15:04.400 --> 15:08.640]  We've got to really find out what's going on because they know all the pedophilia is coming
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.440]  out and the pedophilia rings mainly run by the Democrats. A lot of Republicans are going to
[15:13.440 --> 15:19.040]  be involved as well, but it's run by the Democrats. They're the right arm of the globalist, okay?
[15:19.040 --> 15:23.520]  And they know what they're doing and people are now separating themselves from it
[15:23.520 --> 15:27.600]  as they should. They're making the decision to say, okay, you've been right about a lot of stuff
[15:27.600 --> 15:32.080]  way ahead of time. We just couldn't believe it. We want to be separated. But here's the difference.
[15:33.920 --> 15:40.320]  I'm seeing tweets everywhere where people are saying, oh, I hope the Clinton death count
[15:40.320 --> 15:44.960]  includes Trump soon. And we're glad that the Clintons are tough. I heard that on the airplane
[15:44.960 --> 15:49.200]  flying to San Diego when it was first announced, Epstein was dead. A lot of these people know what's
[15:49.200 --> 15:53.760]  going on. They like the pedophilia. They like the evil. The leftists are so twisted, they think
[15:53.760 --> 16:14.320]  it's cool.
[16:14.320 --> 16:38.560]  So here's what you should do right now.

[20:25.680 --> 20:28.000]  studios. It's Alex Jones.
[20:35.520 --> 20:42.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. Thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday, August 13th,
[20:42.240 --> 20:48.400]  2019 global broadcast. Owens Royer riding shotgun with me. He'll be popping in some of this segment
[20:48.400 --> 20:53.600]  and next segment. Now I'm hyperventilating because there's so much incredible news.
[20:54.160 --> 21:00.080]  So many amazing things taking place all around us. It's just an amazing world.
[21:00.080 --> 21:04.960]  So I'm sitting here. I'm watching an aircraft carrier leave port. It's just amazing seeing
[21:04.960 --> 21:09.920]  to watch this floating city right off the window here in San Diego. But continuing,
[21:09.920 --> 21:16.560]  Trump comes out with this leak, which is designed on purpose to let the left know
[21:16.560 --> 21:21.600]  they're serious yesterday that the FCC is going to come in and look at the censorship
[21:22.480 --> 21:26.960]  happening at big tech companies and treat them like a public utility or telecom,
[21:26.960 --> 21:33.040]  which is constitutional. They're going to stop them prohibiting content that's not barred by
[21:33.040 --> 21:39.200]  FCC and that would be pornography. That would be illegal porn. That would be legal gambling ads.
[21:39.200 --> 21:44.000]  That would be hacking ads. That would be calls to violence or cuss words,
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.720]  which they're going to have rules saying you can cuss obviously on the internet.
[21:46.720 --> 21:53.360]  And I don't even like that, but the internet has become the public square and Google
[21:54.160 --> 21:59.200]  and Apple and others have gone under authoritarian rules and are already acting as governments.
[21:59.200 --> 22:04.320]  So the First Amendment is a law stating you can't prohibit something. So Trump is saying,
[22:04.320 --> 22:08.720]  we're going to have a law prohibiting under the First Amendment that you can't take rights.
[22:08.720 --> 22:13.840]  Still dangerous, but it's our government. It's our country and it's against big tech censorship,
[22:13.840 --> 22:19.440]  but that's only part of the executive order. Trump continues and says, but really it's going
[22:19.440 --> 22:26.480]  to be the Federal Trade Commission will have an open complaint system and criminal investigations
[22:26.480 --> 22:34.000]  and civil lawsuits both over the racketeering, over the bullying, over the voter suppression.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.840]  And that's exactly what we needed. That's only part of what's on the table in the drafts.
[22:39.840 --> 22:43.360]  They're taking government funding away through government grants that Google, Apple,
[22:43.360 --> 22:47.760]  Twitter and others get billions in. There's removing them off military bases and government
[22:47.760 --> 22:52.000]  installations saying they're working with China so that they can't be trusted like Huawei.
[22:53.040 --> 22:58.160]  This is all a very exciting time. And notice suddenly I'll talk about next segment with the
[22:58.160 --> 23:05.120]  gentleman who exposed all of this. Chris Cuomo blew up at that's the point with Brandon. That's
[23:05.120 --> 23:12.800]  the host name. That's the name of the show. YouTube first took it down when it was going viral.
[23:13.760 --> 23:20.400]  But then the president's son said something and others pointed it out and they put it back up.
[23:20.400 --> 23:24.640]  So see, oh, you show Chris Cuomo in public threatening to physically attack somebody.
[23:24.640 --> 23:30.800]  YouTube took it down. But as soon as they got backlash, they put it back up. They're not
[23:30.800 --> 23:35.360]  as arrogant as they used to be. Now, let's get to the big enchilada that we'll obviously cover
[23:35.360 --> 23:40.240]  with Mark Rendazza, the lawyer who got these documents last week. That's big developments on
[23:40.240 --> 23:46.640]  that front. We're also going to have Bob Barnes joining us, Hotep Jesus, always informative,
[23:46.640 --> 23:55.280]  going to be coming on again and Owen Schreuer riding shotgun. But this next news is so big that I
[23:55.280 --> 24:00.640]  think should I start the show with it? No, China basically being at war with the US and proxy wars
[24:00.640 --> 24:06.720]  is bigger and Trump getting ready to move against censorship in general is huge. But the way this
[24:06.720 --> 24:12.320]  Epstein case captured the public's mind and was like Toto pulling back the curtain in the Wizard of
[24:12.320 --> 24:17.200]  Oz, showing the little man behind the curtain, it probably is bigger than everything because it
[24:17.200 --> 24:23.600]  symbolizes the awakening. One scumbag pimp that procured underage people and children and for
[24:23.600 --> 24:29.040]  rituals and other evil things to compromise folks. Yeah, he's not the news, but the fact that the
[24:29.040 --> 24:32.320]  media has tried to cover this up and tried to defend it. The fact that there's censoring on
[24:32.320 --> 24:38.720]  Twitter and Facebook and YouTube right now. Any mention of this or who's in the 2000 pages of
[24:38.720 --> 24:43.840]  documents, all these top Democrats and others and all the royalty and all the corporate heads.
[24:43.840 --> 24:48.320]  And this is just a few witnesses. This is all coming out and the witnesses match up with flight
[24:48.320 --> 24:53.840]  logs. So what happened? Well, people said, Oh, it's the witness protection program. Well, I don't
[24:53.840 --> 24:57.920]  agree with that. Dead men don't tell tales and they want to threaten the other witnesses. So
[24:58.800 --> 25:02.800]  they famously have always had jail guards that for money will do whatever they're told.
[25:03.680 --> 25:07.360]  And whether it was jail guards that were in there before or jail guards that came in later,
[25:07.360 --> 25:14.320]  we don't know their names yet. CBS News is reporting that they heard yelling and shrieking
[25:14.320 --> 25:18.960]  as soon as two guards go in. One of them who didn't even work there. They're like, Hey,
[25:18.960 --> 25:23.360]  we got Bob, but we need probably a two man team. What if the substance can fight?
[25:23.920 --> 25:28.480]  And we'll bring Charlie in or whatever his name is. And as I was reading Paul Watson's article
[25:28.480 --> 25:33.680]  about this, before I even got into it, I said, Oh, that's a classic cover. Boom, open the door,
[25:33.680 --> 25:39.360]  run in, you hear some shrieking and say, Oh, breathe, fight for your life, pal. Oh, you come on,
[25:39.360 --> 25:47.600]  Epstein fight. Well, you got him in that chokehold. Oh, like South Powell. Then they leave.
[25:49.440 --> 25:54.800]  This is incredible. CBS News is reporting that inmates are telling federal investigators, no,
[25:54.800 --> 26:01.200]  we heard the door open, screaming, yelling, begging, basically. And then right as that starts, Oh,
[26:01.200 --> 26:07.200]  come on, Epstein, breathe, buddy, you can do it. That's exactly how you do this when you know people
[26:07.200 --> 26:12.160]  are listening. And that's textbook. So before I even read what Tim Poole was saying, investigative
[26:12.160 --> 26:16.320]  journalists have a lot of respect for, even though he goes with stereotypes of me and, you know,
[26:16.320 --> 26:20.800]  doesn't ever get me credit. That's fine. He does great work. Shrieking and shouting heard from
[26:20.800 --> 26:25.680]  Epstein's cell the morning he died. Guard on duty was not a regular corrections officer.
[26:26.720 --> 26:30.640]  And they turned the cameras off and they turned the lights off and they told the other guards,
[26:30.640 --> 26:37.280]  go home 30 minutes early. I mean, this is every default position was click, click, click, click,
[26:37.280 --> 26:43.600]  click, click turned off just as Robert Barnes was saying yesterday. But one thing you forgot,
[26:43.600 --> 26:47.680]  this is also a super high profile guy. Everybody's saying they're going to kill
[26:47.680 --> 26:52.560]  right after all these bomb cell documents come out. Oh, you don't think British royalty would
[26:52.560 --> 26:56.960]  have somebody killed. You don't think they can find jail guards that for $10 million will do this
[26:56.960 --> 27:02.560]  when they know they're protected. I'm sure CBS and Tim Poole are wrong. They didn't do nothing.
[27:02.560 --> 27:08.480]  They're nice boys. Shrieking and shouting was heard from Jeffrey Epstein's cell in the morning.
[27:08.480 --> 27:12.480]  He died while one of Epstein's guards at the Metropolitan Police Center was not a regular
[27:12.480 --> 27:21.920]  corrections officer. Oh, the other gods go home. Other gods, well, you'll all be taken care of.
[27:21.920 --> 27:26.880]  On the morning of Epstein's death, there was shouting and shrieking from his cell,
[27:26.880 --> 27:31.040]  reports CBS News corrections officers attempted to revive him while saying,
[27:31.040 --> 27:37.200]  breathe, breathe Epstein, breathe, like a shove in your head, water, breathe there, buddy. Oh,
[27:37.200 --> 27:42.240]  don't bleed to death while they stab you. Don't die. Boom. How'd that feel?
[27:43.920 --> 27:49.200]  Continuing journalist Tim Poole even speculated that breathe, breathe could be the could be
[27:49.200 --> 27:56.560]  shouted as cover for those same individuals acting and actually murdering Epstein. Oh, no, no, no,
[27:56.560 --> 28:03.280]  no. I'm imagining two guys standing and strangling Epstein while leaning out so that other inmates
[28:03.280 --> 28:11.840]  can hear them breathe. Oh, no, he's choking, bleed. And they're strangling him in a sleeper hole,
[28:11.840 --> 28:20.400]  said Poole. And it goes on from there. This is CBS News reporting this. All the systems are turned
[28:20.400 --> 28:24.880]  off. All the regulars are sent home. The regular check it every 30 minutes. Oh, don't do that.
[28:25.600 --> 28:33.200]  Again, this is the most ridiculous over the top thing I have ever seen. It makes my head spin.
[28:33.200 --> 28:36.800]  And you've got to ask yourself, why are they so incredibly sloppy? It gets worse.
[28:36.800 --> 28:42.800]  And come back. Before we go to our guests, it's on info wars.com. All that drone footage shot
[28:42.800 --> 28:47.440]  showed what was in his windows. Right before the FBI gets there, somebody cleans out all the
[28:47.440 --> 28:53.280]  computers and everything. We have video of it. That's right. So who was on the island days before?
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.920]  Will the FBI ask that question? Will people inside protect the Clintons again?
[28:59.280 --> 29:03.920]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without
[29:03.920 --> 29:09.520]  all the speculation. No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of
[29:09.520 --> 29:14.320]  Bitcoin. Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an
[29:14.320 --> 29:19.200]  equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace. Inspired by entrepreneurs
[29:19.200 --> 29:23.360]  who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to
[29:23.360 --> 29:28.720]  manufacture dozens of critical digital assets, not a security IPO or note. Blockchain data centers
[29:28.720 --> 29:34.400]  have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment
[29:34.400 --> 29:39.360]  deposited into your bank account each month. Don't miss this one. Stake your claim today.
[29:39.360 --> 29:47.360]  Call 800-600-3388. That's 800-600-3388. These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[29:47.360 --> 29:54.240]  Call now 800-600-3388. 800-600-3388. Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners
[29:54.240 --> 29:57.280]  consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security
[29:57.280 --> 30:03.360]  which requires an operating document. Serving with InfoWars is a great honor,
[30:04.000 --> 30:10.720]  but I still need my morning coffee. And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters
[30:10.720 --> 30:17.600]  is stock full of high quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee. Grown in the high mountains

[30:34.000 --> 30:40.720]  more important time to support InfoWars. So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom,

[31:19.520 --> 31:24.080]  Increases in polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war
[31:24.080 --> 31:29.680]  once China put pressure on our farmers. That's beautiful. Americans aren't going to be bullied
[31:29.680 --> 31:34.560]  and we aren't going to back down. So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the
[31:34.560 --> 31:38.880]  world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[31:38.880 --> 31:44.560]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit. The human spirit lives at infowars.com and news
[31:44.560 --> 31:50.320]  wars.com and I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light,
[31:50.320 --> 31:54.800]  the dark of the night, we are the resistance, we are 1776 worldwide.
[32:00.080 --> 32:06.000]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are control
[32:06.000 --> 32:10.080]  freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own
[32:10.080 --> 32:15.600]  decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods. Now we're fighting them
[32:15.600 --> 32:19.760]  hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension. But one of the
[32:19.760 --> 32:24.480]  biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives
[32:24.480 --> 32:29.440]  is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from infowarslife.com,
[32:29.440 --> 32:35.200]  I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high
[32:35.200 --> 32:42.400]  quality medical bottom and double the strength of it in a new formula, ultra 12. Ultra 12 is
[32:42.400 --> 32:46.880]  undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[32:46.880 --> 32:52.320]  It is amazing, experience pure medical bottom and B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[32:52.320 --> 33:00.000]  evolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com or AAA 253-3139.
[33:00.000 --> 33:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:06.000 --> 33:35.360]  So we're going to go to the man of the hour who shot video.
[33:36.240 --> 33:42.160]  Recently, Chris Cuomo, the big bully with no ratings on CNN. This gentleman's been a guest on
[33:42.160 --> 33:48.080]  the broadcast before. He does a great job. We're going to be talking to him. It's that's the point
[33:48.080 --> 33:53.680]  with Brandon. He was obviously a big guy because Cuomo is a big guy, but this guy's a big guy.
[33:53.680 --> 34:00.160]  Talk about total posturing by Fredo Cuomo as he's now known. That's coming up. Let me just finish
[34:00.160 --> 34:10.000]  up with this. Right center dead panel on drugsreport.com is the FBI scrambles after drone footage of
[34:10.000 --> 34:19.760]  little pedophile island, little st. Peter Jeffrey Epstein shows that days before the FBI raids it
[34:21.120 --> 34:25.760]  through the windows, you see Apple computers, you see hard drives, you see wiring,
[34:25.760 --> 34:34.640]  you see equipment. It's all been expunged. It's all been scraped. It's all been taken out. It's
[34:34.640 --> 34:39.200]  all disappeared. So the FBI is out there snorkeling around. They're looking for everything. And look,
[34:39.200 --> 34:44.000]  most of the FBI is good, but the regular FBI gets sent on to look for it. The people inside the
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.800]  Justice Department, they know the raid that everybody's been asking for for 10 years. I've
[34:48.800 --> 34:54.400]  been saying raid both that island and the bigger island you're going right next door. The reported
[34:54.400 --> 34:59.280]  tunnels, the dungeons that are all confirmed now. They didn't just fly kids in. They had
[34:59.280 --> 35:04.160]  smugglers bring kidnapped kids up in boats. That's been in the local news for five years.
[35:04.160 --> 35:08.240]  The people say that's just devil's island. That's just Peter Island. There's like the
[35:08.240 --> 35:13.360]  mayors and stuff are like, we need help. The children on the island. We did not let our
[35:13.360 --> 35:18.480]  children go out at night. They take them there. The children disappear. It's like a Dracula's
[35:18.480 --> 35:23.280]  castle. You don't go out at night. You don't get near it. Those are 1000 year old legends.
[35:23.280 --> 35:28.480]  And now you see it again. And it was in the news out of Italy, major news, an island where they
[35:28.480 --> 35:34.880]  take children and others and have orgies and kill them. And there's now indictments happening.
[35:35.600 --> 35:38.800]  I know that sounds scary, but legends all come out of real things.
[35:40.800 --> 35:46.640]  Go to just type in human sacrifice in history. Every culture did it from the ancient Asians to
[35:46.640 --> 35:52.160]  the ancient Africans to the Mesoamericans to the all the Germanic tribes of human sacrifice.
[35:52.160 --> 35:56.800]  And the left always tried to cover that up. Why? Because they didn't want you to know it's ongoing.
[35:56.800 --> 36:03.120]  Things like wicker man, all of that's real folks. Sometimes they want to kill the king.
[36:03.120 --> 36:08.480]  If things got really bad, they'd kill the king, you know, wicker man. That's a druidic thing,
[36:08.480 --> 36:13.680]  a Gaelic thing. Sometimes you kill his son if you really needed strength. I mean, the druids would
[36:13.680 --> 36:18.400]  demand, you know, the king's son or the king's daughter. They didn't just, the Aztecs sometimes
[36:18.400 --> 36:24.160]  would demand royalty be killed. So everybody does this stuff. Everybody repeats this stuff,
[36:24.160 --> 36:32.160]  and it's a real deal. So be sure and check out that article by Jamie White on drudgereport.com
[36:33.280 --> 36:38.240]  and realize we are overpowering the censors. Google and Twitter and Facebook shame on them.
[36:38.240 --> 36:44.240]  Even mainline journalists that are talking about this are talking about the names on the 2000 pages
[36:44.240 --> 36:49.040]  that is public that a federal judge ordered released. So Mark Rondaza, who's an info wars lawyer,
[36:49.760 --> 36:53.520]  he's coming on next hour. Thanks to him and the work of Mike Cernovich.
[36:55.520 --> 36:59.520]  They are removing it and blocking it all over the place. There's articles everywhere about it.
[36:59.520 --> 37:04.320]  You think about signing on to evil folks and aiding and abetting and making themselves part of it.
[37:04.320 --> 37:10.160]  Now, let's shift gears and cut right there. We're live, but we put these up on our own servers
[37:10.160 --> 37:14.880]  and fours.com. So you can find the audio, find the video and share these. That's really the key.
[37:14.880 --> 37:18.480]  You know what's going on lists for some viewers. You're the eyes and ears of this thing. You're
[37:18.480 --> 37:21.760]  the muscle, but you got to get the videos and send them. We'll have the last two segments cut
[37:21.760 --> 37:27.120]  together with all this proof that lets for this segment, the next and that first of all five minutes
[37:27.120 --> 37:35.200]  go to our very special guests. The show is the, that's the point. The show is that's the point
[37:35.200 --> 37:41.360]  with Brandon and he's going to tell us where he was, the details, the background, but this is one
[37:41.360 --> 37:46.480]  of the biggest stories in the country. It's top linked on drugsreport.com. At first, we now know
[37:46.480 --> 37:51.680]  that it was taken down by YouTube until there was a backlash. Now the president, now his son
[37:51.680 --> 37:55.920]  have retweeted it. It's getting tens of millions of views across the internet where
[37:57.040 --> 38:02.560]  Mr. Cuomo, Chris Cuomo of CNN, non-fame, almost no viewers, terrible writings,
[38:02.560 --> 38:10.480]  bullies and attacks this man for calling him Fredo. Now that's a thing that I have a lot of
[38:10.480 --> 38:14.560]  Italian friends, a lot of Italian friends, a lot of Italian great folks that work for the office
[38:14.560 --> 38:20.400]  and business partners and people, they all call weak men Fredos. And so I guess that's why on
[38:20.400 --> 38:25.120]  the Godfather, they call the son Fredo. I'm told that's was going on before the Godfather
[38:25.120 --> 38:32.000]  that you call somebody Fredo. Mark Rondaza is an Italian citizen as well as a US citizen.
[38:32.800 --> 38:39.600]  He started an Italian school, so he's a big, I guess you say Roma file, a supporter of Italian
[38:39.600 --> 38:44.080]  stuff, and he's going to pop into next hour and just point out, no, no, that's not the N word,
[38:44.080 --> 38:49.760]  ladies and gentlemen. It's saying you're weak. It's saying you're a fake. And if anybody deserves
[38:49.760 --> 38:57.360]  to be called Chris Fredo Cuomo, it's him and his thug brother Andrew that said America was never
[38:57.360 --> 39:03.120]  great and he'll never be great. Or no, it was never that great. He'll never be great. I mean,
[39:03.120 --> 39:08.960]  that didn't, I mean, Fredo means punk. Fredo means bitch. Fredo means enemy. Fredo means somebody
[39:08.960 --> 39:13.280]  you don't want watching your back. Fredo means somebody you can't trust. He doesn't mean the
[39:13.280 --> 39:18.640]  damn N word. But imagine this big, rich, powerful guy that got away with hitting runs and his corrupt
[39:18.640 --> 39:25.520]  thug brother and all of this. He has the nerve to sit there and tell somebody that, oh, you call
[39:25.520 --> 39:29.280]  me the N words, you can flip out and threaten to throw him downstairs and basically kill him.
[39:29.280 --> 39:33.760]  I'll wreck you. I'll throw you downstairs. We're going to play the beeped audio next segment,
[39:33.760 --> 39:39.760]  but let's bring in the host of that's the point with our guest Brandon. Thank you so much for
[39:39.760 --> 39:47.520]  coming on, sir. Oh, Alex, you know, it's a pleasure every time. You know, you broke my heart, Fredo.
[39:47.520 --> 39:57.200]  You, you broke my heart. And so the whole thing was this video was actually sent to me. I wasn't
[39:57.200 --> 40:05.840]  there. So the video was sent to me by a that's the point follower. And they gave, they say, hey,
[40:05.840 --> 40:10.640]  I don't want to be named. I just wanted you to expose what he did. And this and this and that.
[40:10.640 --> 40:18.080]  So the story is, dude was at it going at a bar and Chris Coma was there with a woman and a group
[40:18.080 --> 40:23.120]  of other guys. And I guess they were one was going up the stairs and one was coming down the stairs
[40:23.120 --> 40:30.560]  and they kind of met right by the stairs. And he and this guy who chooses to be remain anonymous,
[40:31.120 --> 40:36.800]  he asked him, he said, Hey, Fredo, can I get a photo? And the reason he called him Fredo was
[40:36.800 --> 40:41.600]  because he listens, the guy listens to Rush Limbaugh all the time. And Rush Limbaugh always equates,
[40:42.240 --> 40:48.160]  you know, calling him Fredo, Chris Coma Fredo. So he legitimately, this is what I was told,
[40:48.160 --> 40:53.040]  and he legitimately believed the dude's name was Fredo, or at least the nickname. So he said,
[40:53.040 --> 40:57.280]  Hey, Fredo, can I get a photo? And at that point, that's when he started snapping on him and the
[40:57.280 --> 41:05.680]  recording started. And so that being, yeah, so all and then clearly in the video, you could see,
[41:05.680 --> 41:11.840]  like, I say, Hey, look, I didn't, I didn't mean it like that. I've legitimately thought your name
[41:11.840 --> 41:16.400]  was that's okay. So I thought that was you. I know you've been on the show a few times, but we
[41:16.400 --> 41:19.120]  were moving quicker and there wasn't a lot of detail with the video. That's why you're here. I'm
[41:19.120 --> 41:23.280]  glad we're getting the background because the guy's big. I mean, I know Cuomo's a really big guy,
[41:23.280 --> 41:28.240]  that this guy looks even bigger. And he seems he seems so genuine saying, Hey, man, I'm sorry.
[41:28.240 --> 41:32.880]  I didn't know. And I thought, man, this guy's either a great actor, or he did. He really thought
[41:32.880 --> 41:36.800]  his name was Fredo. So now we get to, but I noticed the big guy takes his glasses off.
[41:37.520 --> 41:39.920]  And it's like, okay, I'm kind of ready to go there at the end.
[41:40.720 --> 41:47.120]  Yeah. So the whole thing is, is this kid's a good kid? He's a college kid. So and his family has a
[41:47.120 --> 41:51.440]  big family business in New York. So that's why he really wants to remain anonymous because he's
[41:51.440 --> 41:56.240]  afraid of the backlash. And he didn't know that it was going to go this big. So I, you know, I
[41:56.240 --> 42:01.360]  have all, I could send you later all the, all the contextual texts that I have with him. He does
[42:01.360 --> 42:05.600]  room, you know, choose to remain anonymous. So I won't mention it here. But I'll show you the
[42:05.600 --> 42:10.640]  texts. And he's in fear of showing, you know, who he is in his name. So he gave me, you know,
[42:10.640 --> 42:16.480]  all the rights he said, Hey, please expose this, get this out. And so I did. And so, you know,
[42:16.480 --> 42:19.200]  it just goes to show the tolerance of the left that they speak of, right?
[42:20.640 --> 42:23.440]  Well, we're going to play the oil when we come back, but it's just vicious. I mean,
[42:23.440 --> 42:28.160]  even if somebody's messing with you, your public figure, people go, Hey, you know, crap head,
[42:28.160 --> 42:33.360]  I hope you die all the time. And sometimes I say, screw you back. Usually I just laugh at him now
[42:33.360 --> 42:37.520]  or say, get behind me, Satan, but to say, I'm going to throw you downstairs. I'm going to wreck
[42:37.520 --> 42:43.200]  you. And he's got a couple of thugs with him, bowing up, acting tough. It's, it's amazing video.
[42:44.400 --> 42:48.320]  And the fact that they do legitimately say, Hey, look, man, I didn't mean it like that.
[42:50.960 --> 42:54.800]  And then that only encourages you to act like a thug until the big guy takes his glasses off
[42:54.800 --> 42:58.080]  and looks like he's well, okay, I'm ready. He threatened to basically kill him. We'll be right
[42:58.080 --> 43:04.560]  back. Stay there, please. It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement

[44:03.920 --> 44:08.240]  this year and I feel like I'm stealing from you. I buy so much in the store because I mean, I don't
[44:08.240 --> 44:11.040]  want to get that money to Walmart. I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate
[44:11.040 --> 44:14.960]  it to causes I don't believe in. So I'd rather give that money to you and then getting quality
[44:14.960 --> 44:19.600]  products. The products that I do receive have changed my life. I mean, the X2 has really done a
[44:19.600 --> 44:23.760]  lot for me. I've lost weight. My brain works a whole lot better. I think my kids, they use the
[44:23.760 --> 44:28.480]  toothpaste. My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it
[44:28.480 --> 44:32.880]  and it gets rid of his sore throat. Let me break this down for you. I want high quality stuff in
[44:32.880 --> 44:37.280]  there. I want a good price, but I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys
[44:37.280 --> 44:41.760]  when it's 50% off. I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off. And so it's the same thing like the
[44:41.760 --> 44:46.560]  fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth. Thank you so much for the plugs. But listen, when people
[44:46.560 --> 44:50.480]  get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later because if you're already
[44:50.480 --> 44:54.880]  getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, then we're doing 50% off. And then you do something
[44:54.880 --> 44:58.400]  like that where you have Patriot points, we lose money, but that's okay. Thanks for the support.
[44:59.920 --> 45:04.480]  I love watching David Knight in the morning. I love tuning in to Owen Troyer. I love all the other
[45:04.480 --> 45:10.080]  shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you. We run during the breaks a lot of news reports
[45:10.080 --> 45:15.040]  because I'm sick of hearing the ads. So you think you don't want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear
[45:15.040 --> 45:20.160]  an ad, but here's the bottom line. We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the
[45:20.160 --> 45:24.720]  face. The global is not contract. I don't want them to win. So listen, you've got this guarantee
[45:24.720 --> 45:30.800]  for me. We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give
[45:30.800 --> 45:35.120]  the global's run for their money. But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force
[45:35.120 --> 45:39.680]  Plus X2. These will change your life. Go check out the turmeric products, check out the water
[45:39.680 --> 45:44.000]  filtration, air filtration, check it all out. Whatever you do, take action and know be part of
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.840]  the second American revolution. Be part of crush the globalist. You get great products at the same
[45:47.840 --> 45:54.480]  time. M4store.com is the umbrella site. M4slife.com is the supplements. Take action now and fund
[45:54.480 --> 46:04.560]  the M4 for your own future. Without your support, we won't be here. And I couldn't thank you all
[46:04.560 --> 46:08.080]  enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game. I mean, I want to stay in this game. I want
[46:08.080 --> 46:13.200]  to take the globalist on. Total transparency is our whole operation. If I bring in $35 million,
[46:13.200 --> 46:16.880]  half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much. I don't care
[46:16.880 --> 46:21.280]  if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products. We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got
[46:21.280 --> 46:25.600]  turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus. But ultimate
[46:25.600 --> 46:29.840]  krill oil has been sold out for four months. For whatever reason, this became the most popular
[46:29.840 --> 46:34.800]  fish oil. It's totally full of the bottle. And it is the strongest, purest krill oil. And it cost
[46:34.800 --> 46:40.240]  us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove
[46:40.240 --> 46:44.880]  mercury. Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but
[46:44.880 --> 46:48.480]  gives you all the great benefits, isn't real. It's been boiled, it's been rill and it's been
[46:48.480 --> 46:53.520]  homogenized. This is not good. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're
[46:53.520 --> 46:58.480]  going to find anywhere. Real krill oil, folks, is red. It's not yellow. It's not milky. This is
[46:58.480 --> 47:01.760]  nothing but krill oil.
[47:03.280 --> 47:07.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:07.760 --> 47:37.680]  I want him shut down. I want him silenced. I want them all silenced. All conservatives,
[47:37.680 --> 47:41.920]  all Trump supporters, take them off the internet. That's a quote from Anna Navarro,
[47:42.560 --> 47:50.320]  another one of Chris Cuomo's MSM establishment hack colleagues. Well, here she is calling Don
[47:50.320 --> 47:58.560]  Jr. Fredo because he works in New York and because his first name is Don. So that's really acting
[47:58.560 --> 48:04.000]  like all Italians are criminals if you really want to get into stereotypes. Calling someone who's
[48:04.000 --> 48:11.280]  Italian Fredo, generally again, means that they are just a punk, someone that can't be trusted.
[48:11.280 --> 48:19.680]  But here's a clip of Anna Navarro. Daddy kept Fredo back home. So who cares what Donald Trump
[48:19.680 --> 48:25.680]  Jr. says? Who cares what Donald Trump Jr. says? I don't want to talk about that title.
[48:28.320 --> 48:33.680]  So there you go. Now let's introduce our guest here. He's got a popular show. That's the point
[48:33.680 --> 48:38.240]  with Brandon. He's been on our show. He's been on the other shows before. And he was sent this
[48:38.240 --> 48:43.760]  footage from an anonymous gentleman who's very successful, family very successful in New York
[48:43.760 --> 48:48.240]  who had seen Limbaugh's clips online. And I knew Limbaugh does call him Fredo because he's kind
[48:48.240 --> 48:54.400]  of the dumb brother from the big mob boss, I mean, literally Democrat mob boss for the Democrat
[48:54.400 --> 48:58.160]  machine, not because he's Italian, but because the Democrat machine, you know, runs much the
[48:58.160 --> 49:05.360]  northeast Chicago, San Francisco into the ground. And so he was sent this footage by this gentleman
[49:05.360 --> 49:10.160]  who will remain anonymous, but he can give us all the inside baseball and some of the backstory,
[49:10.160 --> 49:14.160]  recap some of that, make other key points. Then we're going to play this beeped audio
[49:14.160 --> 49:19.440]  of Chris Cuomo threatening to wreck him, throw him downstairs for calling him Fredo.
[49:19.440 --> 49:28.240]  Yeah. So the source said sent it and he was in a bar, they were with some friends and they were
[49:28.240 --> 49:35.120]  walking upstairs, I believe. And that's when they ran into Chris. And so from that point,
[49:35.120 --> 49:41.440]  he recognized him and but only registered with the name Fredo. And so he said, Hey,
[49:41.440 --> 49:46.800]  Fredo, can I get a photo with you or a picture? And at that point, like it was that simple and
[49:46.800 --> 49:54.640]  that fast of an exchange. And in that type of manner, it wasn't like, Hey, Fredo, you know,
[49:54.640 --> 50:00.640]  he went up, he said, Fredo, can I get a photo? And he just went completely ham. So they turned
[50:00.640 --> 50:07.120]  on the recorder and the phone and recorded it. And, you know, the rest explain explains for
[50:07.120 --> 50:15.120]  itself how he acted, trying to break down and make it the word, the name Fredo equivalent to the N
[50:15.120 --> 50:21.760]  word. I don't see where he got that twist from. So that's, that's just amazing how they try to
[50:21.760 --> 50:28.320]  spin that narrative so fast. And CNN saying, Oh, they were saying he was a racial slur. So we
[50:28.320 --> 50:33.120]  back Cuomo. So what they're doing is just green lighting that type of behavior for the left.
[50:33.120 --> 50:39.280]  But if that was somebody on the right, they'd be crucified, tarred and feathered and walked through
[50:39.280 --> 50:45.280]  with everybody screaming, shame, shame, shame on them. 100%. You said it better than I could.
[50:45.280 --> 50:49.200]  You know, first, everybody hates black people so we can dehumanize anybody that likes Trump,
[50:49.200 --> 50:54.320]  because we call them racists. Now it's, Oh, you can't call me a name I don't like. Now, now,
[50:54.320 --> 50:58.480]  you know, you're making fun of me. But it sounds like when he's talking to Cuomo that the guys,
[50:58.480 --> 51:04.000]  he says, you know, are you Italian? And the guy says, I think the guy is Italian. Is he?
[51:04.000 --> 51:10.560]  I believe, I believe one of them were, because I know there was a couple of them, you know,
[51:10.560 --> 51:13.440]  you know, his friends and then also. Yeah. So then Cuomo starts saying, well,
[51:13.440 --> 51:17.840]  that you should know not to just, I mean, it's just total crap. Everybody knows that it means
[51:17.840 --> 51:23.040]  somebody's weak. But again, if the guy doesn't really know who he is, believes it's off the nickname,
[51:23.040 --> 51:28.320]  Cuomo, I think better get ready because if Chris Cuomo wasn't known as Fredo by everybody before,
[51:28.320 --> 51:31.120]  he is now going to be known as Fredo Cuomo. What do you think?
[51:31.120 --> 51:37.600]  Forever in a day, 100%. That is, that is hashtag fake news, Fredo,
[51:38.400 --> 51:46.160]  Fredo Cuomo, 100%. But the thing is, is he Hollywood can't even write this stuff, man.
[51:46.960 --> 51:53.440]  It writes itself and it's pure, it's pure gold that they expose themselves. You really don't
[51:53.440 --> 51:57.920]  have to do anything nowadays, but bring a camera out and put it in front of a Democrat liberal,
[51:57.920 --> 52:01.840]  and you're going to go hand, you know what I mean? And they're going to expose themselves.
[52:01.840 --> 52:06.560]  It's, it's, it's ridiculously that simple. And it just goes to show the poll where,
[52:07.280 --> 52:14.240]  where our society is now, you know, turning to and falling down at such a rapid rate.
[52:15.600 --> 52:18.960]  You're right. But that was my next question. How bad is it going to get? But I want to play
[52:18.960 --> 52:23.200]  of this clip, folks, because there's, there's so many of them, but this is the same Cuomo
[52:23.200 --> 52:26.960]  that said, if your 11 year old daughter doesn't want to see a man at a public school
[52:26.960 --> 52:32.720]  that identifies as a woman, who's her coach. So if a man identifies as a woman, so it's a trans
[52:32.720 --> 52:38.400]  coach, the girls that are 11 should, should be in showers with a 30 year old man. He said,
[52:38.400 --> 52:44.400]  he then said, these girls and their fathers are bad and are bigoted. I mean, this guy is just
[52:44.400 --> 52:49.760]  from another planet. He is so entitled. And again, he got away with a hit and run at a big city,
[52:50.560 --> 52:54.960]  public outdoor banquet, ran over people, but because his brother's the governor, he got away
[52:54.960 --> 53:02.240]  with it. He was so drunk racing in the middle of a, of a town fair through the fair. He just does
[53:02.240 --> 53:07.120]  really, I think he's like, what is he, six, five, six, six? He's a big guy. And so, but I'll tell
[53:07.120 --> 53:11.280]  him, hey, I'm only five, 11 Cuomo, I'll call you Fredo to your face. You want to punch me,
[53:11.920 --> 53:17.200]  believe me, believe me, let's, let's, let's go. You want to attack me, you thug, you punk.
[53:17.200 --> 53:20.800]  I guarantee you, I ever get you down. You're not going to like it. I'm not going to attack you
[53:20.800 --> 53:26.400]  first. You thug, you punk, you bully, but you want to, you're Fredo. And I swear, if I ever see you
[53:26.400 --> 53:32.000]  anywhere, I'm going to tell you, hey, Fredo, I don't want to photo with your punk ass, Fredo,
[53:32.000 --> 53:35.920]  you thug, put running around threatening people and saying America was never great.
[53:35.920 --> 53:40.080]  They'll never be great. You and your thug brother are just great to this nation.
[53:40.080 --> 53:44.240]  You anti-American chai con funded trash and America's waking up. Sorry, I'm ranting.
[53:44.240 --> 53:48.080]  I'm ranting. You made me mad. Let's go to this censored video. That's a whole other story coming
[53:48.080 --> 53:52.560]  up with our guests that got it. CNN, another's obviously lobbied to have it taken down,
[53:52.560 --> 53:57.200]  but now it's being put back up. Here's the video. Come on, boy. So you want to call me
[53:57.200 --> 54:02.960]  ****, call me ****. I'm not **** here. I'll **** wreck your ****. I'll **** wreck your ****. Stop.
[54:05.440 --> 54:10.400]  Punk ass bitches from the right call me Fredo. My name is Chris Cuomo. I'm an anchor on CNN.
[54:10.400 --> 54:14.720]  You're much. Fredo is from the Godfather. He was that weak brother. Isn't that your brother?
[54:14.720 --> 54:20.640]  And they use it as an Italian dispersion. Any of you Italian? It's a **** insult to your people.
[54:21.440 --> 54:26.240]  It's an insult to your **** people. It's like the N word for us. Is that a cool **** thing?
[54:26.960 --> 54:30.320]  You're a much more reasonable guy in person than you seem to be on television. Yeah,
[54:30.320 --> 54:33.520]  but if you want to play, then we'll **** play. You've got something you want to say about what
[54:33.520 --> 54:38.560]  I do on television to say, but don't be a ****. Hey, listen. What? What? You're going to have
[54:38.560 --> 54:42.960]  a **** problem. What's the problem? It's a little different on TV. **** insult me like that.
[54:42.960 --> 54:47.040]  I didn't insult you. You called me Fredo. It's like I call you punk bitch. You like that? You want
[54:47.040 --> 54:51.440]  to be your nickname? I didn't call you that. You called me Fredo. You know my name. No **** Fredo.
[54:51.440 --> 54:56.640]  Your name was? You did not think my name was **** Fredo. Don't be a liar. Stand up like a man.
[54:56.640 --> 55:01.200]  I'm standing up. You're going to be a man out here. **** own it. Then own what you said. Hey,
[55:01.200 --> 55:04.880]  then own what you said. Listen, I don't have a problem with you, man. You're going to have a ****
[55:04.880 --> 55:08.480]  problem. What? What are you going to do about it? I **** knew what you were ****ing man. I ****
[55:08.480 --> 55:14.160]  throw you down these stairs like a **** home. You don't want to do it. Why don't you do it?
[55:14.160 --> 55:21.680]  Take a swing. Take a **** swing. Watch your **** hands. Watch your **** hands. Take a swing.
[55:21.680 --> 55:26.960]  Come on, boy. Come on, boy. You want to call me ****? Call me ****. Listen, I'm not **** here.
[55:26.960 --> 55:32.000]  I'll **** wreck your ****. I'll **** wreck your ****. Stop. You didn't know what you were doing.
[55:32.000 --> 55:36.960]  I thought it was your name. I thought it was your name. You didn't know, right? You didn't know
[55:36.960 --> 55:41.280]  what you were saying, right? I thought it was your name. I'm breaking it up. I'm breaking it up.
[55:44.160 --> 55:48.320]  Man, I tell you, he makes that guy who's really genuine at the end go, okay, we'll go ahead and
[55:48.320 --> 55:53.040]  the guy's bigger than it looks like in Cuomo. He looks like a really big dude. So Cuomo was
[55:53.040 --> 55:56.880]  about to get his ass handed to him and I think he figured it out and finally stopped. But going
[55:56.880 --> 56:01.920]  back to our guests, the host of That's the Point with Brandon, other points that need to be added
[56:01.920 --> 56:05.280]  to this are obviously tell people the backstory of them trying to suppress this video.
[56:05.280 --> 56:10.320]  Yeah. So, okay. So, well, first of all, I want to clarify something with that video.
[56:12.000 --> 56:18.960]  That Hannity lied and retweeted the video on Twitter and said that, oh, in my honest opinion,
[56:18.960 --> 56:25.520]  Cuomo was right. The guy heckled him or whatever in front of his kids with his nine-year-old daughter
[56:25.520 --> 56:32.400]  and family, complete lie. Cuomo was there with a woman and a group of guys, as you could tell.
[56:32.400 --> 56:40.000]  There was no children present. So, Hannity retweeted that without even trying to find out any
[56:40.000 --> 56:50.320]  further backstories. So, I'm pretty surprised at that. But as far as background for the video,
[56:50.320 --> 56:57.920]  I mean, oh, for them taking it down was, yeah, so with no word, I went to go check my view count
[56:57.920 --> 57:02.480]  to see where it was at. And I noticed that the whole video was gone. Then I received an email
[57:02.480 --> 57:11.200]  saying all my stuff was taken down. And so, I appealed it right away. And I don't know what
[57:11.200 --> 57:15.760]  happened from Donald Trump tweeting or Donald Trump Jr. tweeting it and me doing the appeal.
[57:15.760 --> 57:20.320]  But that was the fastest return on an appeal that I've ever seen. They took it down.
[57:20.320 --> 57:23.680]  It usually takes. It usually takes. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[57:23.680 --> 57:30.560]  I'll say it was down for about an hour. And within that time, it went right back up
[57:30.560 --> 57:35.840]  with that email in the return saying that they... Oh, yeah. I mean, usually an appeal takes two
[57:35.840 --> 57:40.720]  weeks. One time, the young Turks had my channel taken down when I had a confrontation with them
[57:40.720 --> 57:45.760]  because they were at the Google studio area and they put it right back up as well. They were
[57:45.760 --> 57:51.440]  right back. Stay with us, sir. Second hour straight ahead. Without your support, we won't
[57:51.440 --> 57:55.840]  be here. And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game. I mean,
[57:55.840 --> 57:59.840]  I want to stay in this game. I want to take the globalist on. Total transparency is our whole
[57:59.840 --> 58:04.400]  operation. If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products because we don't
[58:04.400 --> 58:08.480]  mark stuff up that much. I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[58:08.480 --> 58:12.960]  We got coffee. We got fish oil. We got turmeric. We got great toothpaste. We've got great things
[58:12.960 --> 58:17.760]  like DNA Force Plus. But ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months for whatever reason.
[58:17.760 --> 58:22.320]  This became the most popular fish oil. It's totally full of the bottle. And it is the strongest,
[58:22.320 --> 58:27.520]  purest krill oil. And it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive
[58:27.520 --> 58:32.640]  laboratory process to remove mercury. Any kind of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish
[58:32.640 --> 58:36.800]  burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real. It's been boiled.
[58:36.800 --> 58:41.520]  It's been ruined. It's been homogenized. This is not good. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest
[58:41.520 --> 58:46.080]  quality krill oil you're going to find anywhere. Real krill oil, folks, is red. It's not yellow.
[58:46.080 --> 58:48.560]  It's not milky. This is nothing but krill oil.
[58:51.040 --> 58:55.440]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square. The other thing
[58:55.440 --> 59:00.800]  that's unique about Info Wars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a
[59:00.800 --> 59:05.120]  corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy. That's not backed by some billionaire. That's not being
[59:05.120 --> 59:09.440]  funded by a secret foreign government. It is completely independent of all that. It is an old
[59:09.440 --> 59:14.960]  school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom
[59:14.960 --> 59:18.880]  of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country,
[59:18.880 --> 59:23.280]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was
[59:23.280 --> 59:27.200]  the kind of press they wanted. And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[59:27.200 --> 59:31.360]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and
[59:31.360 --> 59:36.640]  manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear. And the Info Wars
[59:36.640 --> 59:41.760]  audience has broken through that. They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age,
[59:41.760 --> 59:46.000]  ultimate American democracy and freedom. And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught
[59:46.000 --> 59:49.840]  of the platforming, defamation, lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[59:52.720 --> 59:55.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:55.360 --> 1:00:11.040]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:23.520]  So Sean Hannity's probably been lied to. Of course, they live in New York. He's probably friends
[1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:28.480]  with Cuomo. Cuomo's kind of run things. I get it. But he has tweeted that video that's out there
[1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:32.640]  that's on Drudge that these guys came up and confronted Cuomo with his family. That's not
[1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:37.360]  true. Cuomo was with some other big guys and a woman. The guy thought his name was Frodo,
[1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:44.320]  because, excuse me, Frodo, he was Bill Baggins, Fredo. And so he simply said, hey, Fredo,
[1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:53.600]  but he is now known Chris Cuomo as Chris Fredo Cuomo. Period. And this is the reality. He's
[1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:58.480]  a guy that says your 11 year old daughters should be in showers with full grown men who have male
[1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:03.680]  genitals. You can read his tweets. He's a guy that threatens to attack guests on a show and thugs
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:08.960]  up on people. He's a guy that calls Trump a gangster and all these names. And here's more
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:14.640]  of his hypocrisy right now. Then we get to the heart of it. The face to face encounter, the man
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:18.960]  Nathan Phillips apparently wanted to diffuse the tension and he walked up to do exactly that. And
[1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:24.240]  surely the kid, Nick Sandman, he doesn't seem to be afraid, but he did make a choice. And that was
[1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:30.800]  to make it into a standoff. That was not a good choice. Was it legal? Sure. That's not my test.
[1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:34.960]  And it shouldn't be the test. Here's mine. If that were my son, who happens to go to a great
[1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:40.800]  Catholic school, would I like what he did? If I were there, would I have allowed the kids to be in
[1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:52.320]  that situation? No and no. So Chris Fredo Cuomo, that's his official name, Chris Fredo Cuomo or
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:02:00.560]  just Fredo, the bully Cuomo comes up when somebody asks, Hey, Fredo, take a picture with me against
[1:02:00.560 --> 1:02:04.720]  in their face, threatens to kill them basically, throw them downstairs, wreck them. He says, Oh,
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:08.480]  when the kids have a bunch of people march up to them that are threatened to kill them,
[1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:13.200]  beating drums in their face, that they were bad for standing their ground. But he comes up and
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:18.720]  thugs out. We have the host of that's the point joining us with Brandon. That's the point with
[1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:24.240]  Brandon is the show. He was sent this footage. And he was breaking down earlier that the truth is
[1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:28.640]  that it is Fredo that is the thug here. Other points you think are important to add.
[1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:35.280]  Yeah, absolutely. First of all, most he protected Antifa when they went through that whole process.
[1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:43.440]  He's always been an advocate for extreme leftism behavior, always 100%. One thing I do want to
[1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:50.880]  point out is how fast and quickly they try to spend the narrative trying to say that there was
[1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:57.040]  like, you know, the family there, you know, and then they try to target the word Fredo as a racial
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:02.880]  slur. And then, you know, it started trending as, you know, that fast. So once they realized though
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:08.240]  that it didn't mean that and the whole masses knew that they couldn't, you know, they're still trying
[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:16.320]  to push it, but it's not really holding any water. I definitely want to host a show here.
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:20.640]  You should host a show here because you make better points than I do. You cut right to the chase.
[1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:25.120]  In fact, looking at the internet today, no one's buying that Fredo is a racial slur.
[1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:29.760]  And it's backfired. And I should have just said upfront, he came up, thugged out, did this.
[1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:34.880]  The media tried to cover it up. They tried to spin it. It blew up in their face. And that was
[1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:40.480]  one of the top trending things. And he's now known as Fredo Cuomo. He literally jumped the shark.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:47.680]  Yeah, no, 100%. He tied himself. You know, he stepped right into his own trap though. Like,
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:54.880]  he did exactly what he says he speaks against, but yet also advocates for. He's a complete mess.
[1:03:54.880 --> 1:04:01.120]  It doesn't make any sense. One thing I do want to say is, I don't know if you guys
[1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:05.040]  seen this shirt though, these colors don't run. You can get that at infowarstore.com.
[1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:13.520]  But like these colors don't run, man, never run from what you stand for and never run from the
[1:04:13.520 --> 1:04:18.080]  truth. Video proves itself. He stepped himself into this own trap. Now they're trying to spend
[1:04:18.080 --> 1:04:21.760]  the narrative of Fredo being racist. And Italians are like, what are you talking about?
[1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:28.640]  And they're like, forget about it. And that doesn't even make sense. And the way YouTube
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:33.200]  tried to censor it so fast and the way they try to take down that video was, you know,
[1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:38.880]  it really didn't surprise me, but it was amazing. But the backlash that I guess we put on them or
[1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:44.480]  Trump put on them or however, when they retweeted, they put it right back up. So, you know, we got
[1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:50.000]  to fight against that censorship, like they're doing the info wars. We're back in 60 seconds.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:54.320]  I want to ask you one more question when we come back. How can Fredo politically survive this?
[1:04:54.320 --> 1:04:58.480]  We'll talk about it with the man who put the video up. It's on drugsreport.com. Straight ahead.

[1:05:56.960 --> 1:06:25.120]  That's the point with Brandon is the name of his very popular online show. He also does a lot
[1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:29.600]  of great interviews. People send him a lot of really cool video. He's been a guest on my show,
[1:06:29.600 --> 1:06:35.040]  been a guest on the other info or shows with his prolific work on YouTube and other platforms.
[1:06:35.040 --> 1:06:40.560]  But this story is a lot bigger than Chris Cuomo, the no ratings, get and run thug,
[1:06:41.760 --> 1:06:48.880]  nobody, Fredo asked brother of another America hating thug, Andrew Cuomo, who said, if you're
[1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:52.640]  pro life or pro gun, get out of New York. People said, oh, you're joking. He said, no, get out of
[1:06:52.640 --> 1:06:59.040]  here. He said America was never that great. You'll never be great. And people like, did you really
[1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:05.360]  mean that? He's like, yeah, I mean that. That's who these leftist are. Chris supports Antifa going
[1:07:05.360 --> 1:07:09.200]  out and attacking innocent people and violating the First Amendment. But he doesn't support the
[1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:15.120]  Covington kids standing their ground. We played that clip earlier, but he's really jumped the
[1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:20.400]  shark. Now Fredo's one of the top trending terms. They tried to say that it was racist
[1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:23.840]  to even say that. Didn't know that it was Italians even saying it. It wouldn't matter if you were a
[1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:29.120]  black guy or an Irish guy or a Chinese guy. Fredo means you're a weak person. This guy thought
[1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:35.920]  he was Fredo. He heard Rush Limbaugh and saw lips of Limbaugh calling him Fredo. But boy, I tell you,
[1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:41.680]  the bullying of Chris Cuomo is just emblematic of how all their bullying isn't working anymore.
[1:07:42.720 --> 1:07:47.040]  I'll shake 50 hands literally before one person walks up to me while I'm here in San Diego
[1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:53.200]  and says, F you, I hope you die. It doesn't matter because they're nobodies folks and they're upset.
[1:07:53.920 --> 1:08:00.800]  Cuomo doesn't have 300,000 viewers of a show. He's a joke. He's a legend in his own mind.
[1:08:01.760 --> 1:08:06.880]  And that's why they have to censor hoping by censoring us, the truth won't come out.
[1:08:06.880 --> 1:08:13.280]  It's Cuomo. I've been playing this clip. Let's cue it up. Cuomo that said, let's not worry about
[1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:20.400]  in the Jeffrey Epstein list the names of who went to the pedophile island. Let's not get caught in
[1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:24.320]  it. Remember, he's the one that said, when these WikiLeaks come out three years ago, he said,
[1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:29.520]  you're not allowed to look at WikiLeaks. I'm allowed to. But if you read them, which is totally
[1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:34.960]  legal for you to read them as a citizen, you're going to go to prison. In fact, let's go to that
[1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:42.000]  clip and try to cue Chris Cuomo up because on the whole situation with the WikiLeaks, because,
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:48.480]  I mean, this guy is just too insane. But first here's the clip that I was just talking about. Here it is.
[1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:18.720]  Oh, I got a little bit of insult to your people. It's an insult to your people. It's like the N word
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:24.480]  for us. So is that a cool thing? You're a much more reasonable guy in person than you seem to be on
[1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:27.920]  television. Yeah, but if you want to play, then we'll play. You've got something you want to say
[1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:32.960]  about what I do on television and say it, but I'm going to fall to you. Hey, listen. What? You're
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:36.640]  going to have a big problem. What's the problem? It's a little different on TV. What's the problem?
[1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:43.520]  It's something like that. It's like, I call you pump bitch. You like that? I didn't call you that.
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:48.160]  I told me, Fredo, you know my name. No, Fredo, your name was, you did not think my name was
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:58.080]  Fredo. Don't be a lie. Again, that's just some of the exchange. Here is clip 16, where he's talking
[1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:08.960]  about F steam. Well, we'll get that clip for you. It's here in my list going back to the host
[1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:15.600]  that saw that that's the point with Brandon. You've made a lot of great points. What are
[1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:21.760]  some of the other points you think need to be made here? Just just the fact how how CNN gives
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:28.320]  passes, how the mainstream media gives a pass to somebody like that. And they talk about how
[1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:37.200]  Trump and us Trump supporters or the Trump supporters like that are privileged or white
[1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:45.760]  privileged and they get away with everything. I mean, if anything is a perfect example of what
[1:10:45.760 --> 1:10:50.720]  they claim to be of white privilege, wouldn't that be Como not being arrested for physically
[1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:57.440]  threatening and injuring somebody and threatening to harm them? Isn't that a challenge? You know what
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:11:02.720]  I mean? Well, that's exactly what's going on. What do you make of him saying, don't investigate
[1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:08.240]  the accomplices with F steam? We have the clip. We're going to add it and post later when we post
[1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:14.640]  this at info wars.com. What do you make of that? Well, I mean, listen, that that that river runs
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:22.240]  deep and anybody on that side and up at that level knows why he doesn't want that not to be
[1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:27.920]  investigated because those branches reach out far and that touches everybody in the mainstream
[1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:35.280]  pretty much. And he's in fear of that. And I believe whoever's trying to cover it up is part
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:39.680]  of it bottom line. That's the way I look at it. If you're not trying to expose the truth for the
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:43.120]  evil, it is you're a part of it and you're trying to mask it and you're trying to you're trying to
[1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:49.280]  hide it from the public and you're trying to condone it in my eyes. So if anybody's trying to
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:55.040]  prevent the truth from being exposed, especially like this kind of guy who Chris Como who's
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:12:00.320]  continuously be caught in lies and using double standards the way he talks and allowing other
[1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:04.560]  people to mention the same name Fredo but never calling it out until it's said to him. And all
[1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:09.280]  of a sudden it's it's the end of the world. It's the newest. It's the new it's the new N word.
[1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:13.760]  Fredo's the new N word now, I guess for Italians. Who would have known, right?
[1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:18.720]  Well, you're absolutely right. I really do appreciate you joining us. I know you're coming
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:24.640]  on the war room today, somewhere in between three and six p.m. And where's the best place for people
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:31.120]  to find your great show? That's the point with Brandon. Yeah, that's the point with Brandon on
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:37.760]  YouTube. You can Google that. Also, that's the point with Brandon should pop up on Twitter is
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:44.480]  the same thing. It on an Instagram is that's the point underscore Brandon. Check out every link
[1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:53.440]  or every video in my link in the description has my TTP shop merch. Also guys get to infowarstore.com.
[1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:59.680]  They have this awesome Betsy Ross. These colors don't run. Yes. So that's where everybody can
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:04.080]  find. God bless you. We appreciate you coming on and producer asked them when we got Mark
[1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:09.760]  Rendazza. Thanks. Hey, thank you so much for coming on with this. Again, there's so much
[1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:16.640]  big news around the world, but this Chris Cuomo thing is really, really a big deal because it
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:23.280]  shows him thugging out and it shows the media trying to cover it up and it shows all the
[1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:27.760]  different angles. We're going to post this live interview. You just saw infowars.com
[1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:31.760]  in the next 30 minutes or so. Hope you share it with everybody. We're going to add him saying
[1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:35.920]  you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks. We're going to add him saying that you shouldn't
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:40.960]  investigate the other people involved with Epstein. I mean, this is absolutely critical.
[1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:45.600]  We're going to play those clips next segment too because this is the big show that reaches
[1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:51.040]  millions of people and it's very, very, and very important that people know about this,
[1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:55.280]  that they understand this, that you know the ballgame of these people who think they're above
[1:13:55.280 --> 1:13:59.440]  the law and who think that we're a bunch of animals that they own and they run. My job here
[1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:03.840]  is to get people from being slaves, being free because if I'm going to be free with my children,
[1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:08.160]  you need to be free as well, us together in the universal world. As we go to brick here,
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:14.880]  please remember that we are under globalist attack because we tell the truth. We don't back down
[1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:20.560]  and that we're never going to give in or shut up as long as we have support. I won't back down. I
[1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:28.560]  won't sell out. I won't give in, but I could give out, ladies and gentlemen. So again, ladies and
[1:14:28.560 --> 1:14:33.520]  gentlemen, without your support, we're not going to be here. We make it really easy with the best
[1:14:33.520 --> 1:14:39.520]  air filtration, the best water filtration, the great shortwave radios, great non-GMO heirloom
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:46.000]  seeds, really amazing books and films, and the Betsy Ross t-shirt. We've gone through two limited
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:51.120]  edition designs of that. We have the Don't Tread on Me Betsy Ross flag that's about to sell out,
[1:14:52.080 --> 1:14:57.120]  and then that's it for those designs of those. A lot of other great collector shirts
[1:14:57.120 --> 1:15:02.080]  at MFullWarStore.com, and I keep saying today's the last day. Sunday was supposed to be the last
[1:15:02.080 --> 1:15:09.360]  day. I said, okay, Monday, mega sale, a one-year banniversary, store-wide free shipping, double
[1:15:09.360 --> 1:15:15.440]  Patriot points, and 50-60% off all the supplements. Well, a bunch of them are getting close to selling
[1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:19.280]  out. Some of the stuff didn't come back in for three months, and so they're like, hey, it's time
[1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:24.000]  to go back to regular price. You need to come out with some new specials. Well, I've been so busy
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.200]  with all of this, and on vacation, it's not really a vacation, I've been working the whole time,
[1:15:28.560 --> 1:15:34.480]  just say 80% of the time, that I haven't gotten the new special up. So when I get off here here
[1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:39.120]  in a minute, Zoe and Troy are going to take over, and Mark Rundasa is coming up a lot more.
[1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:44.880]  It's just critical to remember that that's how we fund this operation, this cast in the last day
[1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:48.720]  of the sale, but I want to thank you all for your support and for spreading the word about how we
[1:15:48.720 --> 1:15:54.000]  were right about Epstein, and so much more. But we've got a lot to talk about with Mark Rundasa on the
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:58.720]  other side, because he's the lawyer that argued in front of the federal court. There's a way for you

[1:17:29.840 --> 1:17:34.800]  ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS and won. I beat the IRS then and
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:39.040]  I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands
[1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:43.120]  of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too.
[1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:48.320]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:55.760]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:03.520]  Without your support, we won't be here and I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:07.040]  that you've kept us in the game. I mean, I want to stay in this game, I want to take the globalist
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:12.240]  on. Total transparency is our whole operation. If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost
[1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:16.000]  of the products because we don't mark stuff up that much. I don't care if I'm not making money,
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:20.320]  but you need to buy the products. We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great
[1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:25.120]  toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus, but ultimate krill oil has been sold out for
[1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:29.360]  four months. For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil. It's totally full of
[1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:35.200]  oil and it is the strongest, purest krill oil and it cost us three times more because we have it
[1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:40.400]  put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury. Any kind of krill oil you get
[1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:44.320]  that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like but gives you all the great benefits,
[1:18:44.320 --> 1:18:48.640]  isn't real. It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized. This is not good. This,
[1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:52.720]  ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're going to find anywhere.
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:57.520]  Real krill oil folks is red, it's not yellow, it's not milky. This is nothing but krill oil.

[1:19:56.080 --> 1:20:14.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:23.440]  Also interesting to remember, it's illegal to possess these stolen documents. It's different
[1:20:23.440 --> 1:20:28.480]  for the media. So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us. And in full disclosure,
[1:20:28.480 --> 1:20:31.760]  let's take a look at what is in there and what it means. Talking about Epstein,
[1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:38.640]  you got to stick to what is common sense on these things. All right? Don't get buried in
[1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:42.960]  legalese. Don't follow the finger pointing. And please don't get caught up in the intrigue
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:45.600]  of who was better friends with this guy. Who cares?
[1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:52.640]  Yeah, who cares who flew on airplanes with underage girls and children? Who cares
[1:20:52.640 --> 1:20:56.880]  if smugglers reportedly brought really young kids into the island? Who cares if it was a
[1:20:56.880 --> 1:21:02.320]  giant international black male ring? I appreciate Mark Rundaza coming on with us. I was having
[1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:06.560]  a technical difficulty earlier. Didn't know you were there until the end of the segment. I apologize.
[1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:11.600]  But you are an Italian American, also an Italian citizen. A lot of time I talked to you. You're
[1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:17.920]  in Italy. You founded an Italian language school. So you were particularly ticked off by this Cuomo
[1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:24.000]  thing. Now there's an interview on infowars.com where he referred to himself as Fredo. So this
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:30.560]  whole race-baiting thing where everything's racism is now extending to calling him Fredo.
[1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:34.880]  What do you make of this, Mark Rundaza? Constitutional lawyer, first limit lawyer,
[1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:41.360]  who of course is really here because you with Mike Cernovich got the huge 2000-page bombshell
[1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:50.960]  document. I hate fake race-baiting to try to shut down debate. I really hate it when it's done in
[1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:58.160]  my vowel at the end of my name name. And as far as Chris Fredo Cuomo goes, I think I've got much
[1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:06.400]  more Italian cred than he does. And there is not a shred of any support for the thought that calling
[1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:12.480]  somebody Fredo is somehow a slight on them for being Italian American. I don't really think that
[1:22:12.480 --> 1:22:19.120]  the godfather that Don Corleone is a great figure to live up to, I don't respect that kind of thing.
[1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:25.760]  But when somebody calls James Brown the godfather of soul, they certainly are not insulting him.
[1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:32.640]  But Chris Cuomo is the dumb son. He is the nitwit of the Cuomo family. So I think he is Fredo.
[1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:39.040]  So, you know, Chris Cuomo really, I think made a screw up. If you watch that video, man,
[1:22:39.040 --> 1:22:45.840]  that guy should sue him for assault. He's got a great claim against him. I would love to see
[1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:51.360]  that happen because if that had happened to anybody else, you know, in any other circumstance,
[1:22:51.360 --> 1:22:56.320]  if those tables had been turned, you bet Chris Cuomo would be screaming that somebody had assaulted
[1:22:56.320 --> 1:23:03.120]  him or made threats against him. So, you know, Cuomo, you know, stagito, if you even know what
[1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:11.600]  that means, it means shut up. Well, why do you think he's so arrogant and just exploded this guy
[1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:17.280]  and then CNN is even defending it now. YouTube took the video down. It's now back up. And they're
[1:23:17.280 --> 1:23:24.320]  still sticking with it that no, no, this guy set a racial epithet. So we now agree with Cuomo running
[1:23:24.320 --> 1:23:28.480]  and doing bumping and saying, I'll wreck you. I'll throw you downstairs. I mean, is that not a
[1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:35.760]  terroristic threat? It's not a terroristic threat, but it is a threat of assault. I mean, it is assault
[1:23:35.760 --> 1:23:42.080]  is when you put someone in imminent fear that there's going to be bodily harm. I mean, that guy,
[1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:46.560]  you saw that guy. I mean, Cuomo was picking on the guy who was, you know, not quite looking like
[1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:51.520]  he was there for a physical altercation. I mean, I think what the guy did, I think bothering people
[1:23:51.520 --> 1:23:57.200]  when they're out with their family is not all that cool. But, you know, Cuomo, I get a funny
[1:23:57.200 --> 1:24:03.040]  feeling that his dad must have called him Freda or something. And, you know, as far as I'm concerned,
[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:07.040]  Mario Cuomo, I know it's not going to be popular with a lot of your viewers, but I think he was a
[1:24:07.040 --> 1:24:11.600]  great American. I think Chris Cuomo ought to be proud that that was his dad. And then Chris Cuomo
[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:16.480]  ought to get off the air and do something that's a little more suited to his intellect. Like, you
[1:24:16.480 --> 1:24:22.400]  know, I don't know, I do, I could use somebody to pick up the garbage out in front of my house on
[1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:29.680]  Monday mornings when the foxes get into it. Okay, the really big news here. It's not a racial
[1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:36.720]  attack. And it's just, it's disgusting that that he's trying to play that card. I think it's,
[1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:43.680]  it's beneath any normal person's pride when they play it from the side of the traditional victims.
[1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:50.720]  But let me tell you something. As an Italian American, if there's anything that racial bias
[1:24:51.600 --> 1:25:00.000]  or prejudice does, it helps us. We are the one group of people in America who's got no right
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:05.440]  to complain about bias. Because you know what, when I sit down at a date, hell, I'm already halfway
[1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:09.680]  in bed with the girl because of the vowel at the end of my name. You know, the pre-expectations
[1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:13.920]  about us what we're great lovers, we know how to cook and we know how to live life. You have a
[1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:18.720]  problem with that and give up the vowel at the end of your name to be Chris Cuomo or Fredo Cuomo.
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:24.080]  I just don't want to hear this from anybody out there who's Italian that they've been oppressed.
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:29.840]  Get over it. Mark Redoso, what do you think his new nickname should be? I mean, I'm thinking like
[1:25:30.640 --> 1:25:34.800]  Fredo Cuomo or just CNN's Fredo or what are you calling?
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:41.680]  You know, it's almost an insult to the Fredo character to compare this guy to him because,
[1:25:41.680 --> 1:25:46.320]  you know, he's actually sort of, you know, I like that clip that you show. That's my favorite
[1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:53.600]  demonstrator clip of Chris Cuomo when he gets up there on CNN and tries to tell people that it's
[1:25:53.600 --> 1:26:00.400]  illegal for them to have documents that CNN got a hold of, but it's okay for him to have them. So,
[1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:05.200]  you know, what's a good name for him? Look, I love everybody should call him Fredo just because
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:10.320]  it gets such a rise out of him. Forget Fredo Cuomo. It's an insult to the Cuomo name the way
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:17.360]  that that guy is such a clown. Just plain old Fredo. Now, Mark, Mark, I know you've got to
[1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:22.480]  go soon, but if you can even do five minutes into the next segment or however much time you've got
[1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:32.800]  because you with Mike Cernovich got a big losing audio. Yeah, we've been having some technical
[1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:37.200]  difficulties that that's part of it when you're on the road. Part of that going on. Houston,
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:44.320]  do I get a thumbs up from folks in Houston? We're good with Houston. I really wanted Rhonda on
[1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:52.480]  today about the fact that they sued with Mike Cernovich to get documents pertaining to Epstein
[1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:59.920]  with an in run by being involved in another suit that was there. And they got these latest documents
[1:26:59.920 --> 1:27:09.120]  implicating world leaders, British Royal family, you name it, inside of the pedophile island on
[1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:14.160]  board the aircraft. This is all big. And then Epstein dies the next day. That was the real reason
[1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:18.960]  that I wanted to get Mark Rondaza on. But I was talking to him this morning.
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:23.600]  He said, Hey, man, I'm pissed off about this whole Fredo thing. That guy is afraid. Oh,
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:28.960]  I want to come on and talk about that. And so I know we've already spent now 45 minutes on this.
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:34.720]  And we've got China invading Hong Kong. And we've got Trump saying it's a very serious situation.
[1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:39.600]  Proxy war is going on with India and Pakistan and China. We've got the economic war going on.
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:46.160]  We got Trump with his draft executive order. Go after big tech censorship. We've got
[1:27:46.160 --> 1:27:50.400]  so many other big guests waiting in the wings that are coming on the show today. And we've got
[1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:55.200]  Owen Schreuer. It's been sitting there patiently while I've been babbling. What are some of the
[1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:59.120]  things you're going to be covering? Oh, and because we're going to have you coos coming up here soon.
[1:28:00.160 --> 1:28:04.560]  Well, we'll go over some of the latest developments in the Epstein thing. We're going to take calls
[1:28:04.560 --> 1:28:09.200]  in the fourth hour. I'll be hosting the fourth hour today. So we're just going to take people's
[1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:13.280]  calls to see what the latest there is. I think it's fair to say at this point, I mean, still a
[1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:17.840]  lot of questions remain, a lot of gray area, but I think it's pretty much 100% certain at this point
[1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:24.000]  there wasn't inside job. Again, whether you want to say good forces, bad forces, outside forces,
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:29.360]  clearly though, inside job, it took somebody inside this facility to pull this off. And,
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:32.880]  you know, we'll look at the Hong Kong news. We've got some other crazy news going on where
[1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:37.280]  they're trying to sexualize the kids as usual. But Alex, I'll say this in closing for the Cuomo
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:41.920]  thing. This is what really stuck out to me about this. I mean, you've had coffee poured on you.
[1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:46.080]  You've had people threaten your family. I mean, you see the videos of how they treat me never,
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:50.960]  ever once with all the disgusting treatment have we received? Have we ever threatened anybody?
[1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:56.320]  Or have you ever tried to get violent? So really, that is the difference here between people like
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:29:25.840]  that and us.
[1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:32.320]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists, get back to nature. Expand your horizons with the

[1:30:02.160 --> 1:30:05.920]  you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game. I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:10.400]  I want to take the globalist on total transparency is our whole operation. If I bring in $35
[1:30:10.400 --> 1:30:15.040]  million, half of that's the cost of the products. We don't mark stuff up that much. I don't care
[1:30:15.040 --> 1:30:19.040]  if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products. We got coffee, we got fish oil,
[1:30:19.040 --> 1:30:23.760]  we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus, but ultimate
[1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:27.920]  krill oil has been sold out for four months. For whatever reason, this became the most popular
[1:30:27.920 --> 1:30:33.520]  fish oil. It's totally full of bottle and it is the strongest, purest krill oil and it cost us three
[1:30:33.520 --> 1:30:39.040]  times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[1:30:39.040 --> 1:30:43.360]  Any kind of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like but gives you
[1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:47.120]  all the great benefits, isn't real. It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[1:30:47.120 --> 1:30:52.080]  This is not good. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're going to find
[1:30:52.080 --> 1:30:57.520]  anywhere. Real krill oil folks is red. It's not yellow, it's not milky. This is nothing but krill oil.
[1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:03.280]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going
[1:31:03.280 --> 1:31:07.200]  to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago before all the
[1:31:07.200 --> 1:31:11.440]  censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products
[1:31:11.440 --> 1:31:15.200]  are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd have doctors on an experts to explain why
[1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:19.120]  they were so good. And instead the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or
[1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:22.080]  they'll shut us down. The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how
[1:31:22.080 --> 1:31:25.440]  great they are and how wonderful they work. And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[1:31:25.440 --> 1:31:32.240]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements. No, under federal law since 1996,
[1:31:32.240 --> 1:31:36.880]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and
[1:31:36.880 --> 1:31:41.360]  won't look at it. But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are
[1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:45.200]  is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[1:31:45.200 --> 1:31:49.120]  And a lot of drugs work great. They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma
[1:31:49.120 --> 1:31:55.440]  doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest. Infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five,
[1:31:55.440 --> 1:32:03.200]  three, three, one, three, nine. Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our
[1:32:03.200 --> 1:32:07.360]  Republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground,
[1:32:07.360 --> 1:32:12.000]  close to reality, who actually work for a living that would end up saving the nation. And today,
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:18.240]  the Communist Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week ago. And we've seen massive increases
[1:32:18.240 --> 1:32:23.840]  in polls support for the president. And what he's doing in this trade war, once China put pressure
[1:32:23.840 --> 1:32:28.800]  on our farmers. That's beautiful. Americans aren't going to be bullied. And we aren't going to back
[1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:34.240]  down. So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world that want to intimidate people
[1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:38.800]  and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up. And all you've done is awaken the human
[1:32:38.800 --> 1:32:44.640]  spirit. The human spirit lives at info wars.com and news wars.com. And I'm asking listeners,
[1:32:45.280 --> 1:32:49.440]  whatever you do, spread those links, because we are the light, the dark of the night,
[1:32:49.440 --> 1:33:03.920]  we are the resistance. We are 1776 worldwide. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:03.920 --> 1:33:16.560]  Live from the info wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:26.720 --> 1:33:29.680]  Well, I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, the energy of what's happening in the world.
[1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:34.640]  Trump's saying he's going to take executive order action on censorship and so much more. It's amazing.
[1:33:34.640 --> 1:33:40.560]  I'm going to hand the baton to Owen shroyer. And of course, Mark Rondaza in the segment for the big
[1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:48.960]  issue, the 2000 pages that he went and argued in court for for Mr. Cernovich. Why this is so
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:53.440]  important. The media really isn't getting into the names that are in there. These are incredible
[1:33:53.440 --> 1:33:58.480]  names. And and why these documents are so bombshell. Then I want to get Rondaz's take
[1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:05.920]  on what he thinks about Trump's draft that was leaked to CNN so far to counter big tech
[1:34:05.920 --> 1:34:09.600]  censorship. So I want to thank both of them for being here today. Owen doing a great job.
[1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:13.840]  The crew doing a great job as we cover all this information. I want to remind listeners,
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:17.840]  the only way we reach new people with the total media blackout, the censorship,
[1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:22.800]  is by you telling people about info wars.com, news wars.com, prisonplanet.tv,
[1:34:23.440 --> 1:34:27.280]  prisonplanet.com. When you share the articles, you share the videos, we're going to post
[1:34:27.280 --> 1:34:31.840]  all this information today after it's live up in different video sections so you can get it out to
[1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:37.600]  everyone you know via your own instant message, via your own text message, via your own email.
[1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:41.840]  Those are some of the few areas we're still able to get stuff out. But now Microsoft and Apple are
[1:34:41.840 --> 1:34:48.000]  announcing that and others in Facebook that on your personal text apps, they're reading and
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:51.760]  watching what you say humans are reading and watching, and they're not going to let you say
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:56.640]  certain things or do things. Now, this is beyond 1984. It's wrong. And we have to say
[1:34:56.640 --> 1:35:00.480]  we have to say no. So those are all topics Mark Rendazza is an expert on constitutional
[1:35:00.480 --> 1:35:06.160]  lawyer that you can speak to. But first, Mark, the huge developments with the 2000 pages that the
[1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:11.120]  media dare not get into and Epstein's death and all the questions, you've got the floor and of
[1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:16.480]  course your co-pilot now is the great Owen Schreuer. Thank you for joining us. My pleasure.
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:23.760]  Yeah, you know, these documents, there was a mighty, mighty effort to keep them quiet.
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:30.080]  First, it was one side wanted them closed. Then the other side, then the side switched sides when
[1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:36.880]  we got to the appeals point. Then at the appeals court, there were other parties who came in who
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:43.360]  never disclosed who they were. They came in as anonymous parties who wanted to work to keep
[1:35:43.360 --> 1:35:49.200]  these documents under wraps. And you know, once they came out, I mean, I still haven't been able
[1:35:49.200 --> 1:35:53.440]  to look through all 2000 pages of them. And I'm sure most of the press hasn't even done that.
[1:35:53.440 --> 1:35:57.600]  But we're seeing a lot of names come out that frankly are somewhat shocking to me.
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:07.440]  New Mexico former governor, former ambassadors, I mean, I am really kind of shocked. Now, remember,
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:11.280]  we have to remember, and this is the thing I'm really glad that the court of appeals did.
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:19.360]  The court of appeals took a very unusual step in their order of admonishing the press that when
[1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:25.840]  they get these documents, it doesn't mean that any of it's true. These are accusations levied by
[1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:32.880]  Mr. Frey, which they might be true, they might not be true. But a couple of things that did come
[1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:36.800]  out in them that you can see in black and white in the documents, you know, there's been this
[1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:45.200]  accusation that Alan Dershowitz was one of the people who engaged in relations with her.
[1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:52.240]  And if you look at the documents, it seems that his name didn't get floated until it was by a
[1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:58.560]  journalist who said, yeah, you were probably with him. So it didn't originate with her. Now,
[1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:04.160]  she's claiming this is true today. So, you know, again, I really don't know. I have a hard time
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:09.440]  believing it. But when I see something like that, or I see a journalist essentially plant,
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:18.160]  it seems to be planting the idea of someone to accuse in the accusers, in the accuser's mind,
[1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:24.000]  I've got a problem with that. Maybe there's something else that shows something else on
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:30.160]  that. But Mr. Dershowitz has been pretty adamant about his denial, as has former New Mexico governor
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:37.520]  Bill Richardson, you know, as have everybody else involved. But when we look at all of this, and
[1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:44.320]  then we just, you know, maybe it's maybe can, you know, coincidence, maybe conspiracy, but it
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:52.720]  seems really, really bizarre that the day after the documents all come out, you know, the suicide
[1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:57.440]  prevention techniques that are supposed to be employed at the prison are not employed. This
[1:37:57.440 --> 1:38:02.640]  guy was on suicide watch, and then they take him off without following proper procedures,
[1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:07.600]  and he just happens to wind up dead. And now, you know, we're not ever going to know what he has to
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:14.320]  say. But when you think about it, you know, he had, he got a sweetheart deal, you know,
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:19.680]  something that I just couldn't imagine anyone else getting. He had a business empire built on
[1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:27.120]  blackmail. And, you know, he had every incentive to stay quiet. Well, when he's now facing the rest
[1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:32.640]  of his life in jail, I think his incentive to stay quiet goes away. And then he mysteriously
[1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:40.080]  winds up suiciding himself, or, you know, maybe not. You know, I really think that this is a
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:45.200]  scandal that should be investigated, should be reported on, should have been reported on before.
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:51.040]  And I think if we, if you remember, the whole history of digging into these documents started
[1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:58.160]  when, you know, the summary judgment motions were filed and everything was under wraps. And
[1:38:58.160 --> 1:39:03.840]  of all the journalists that should have been looking at that, and especially hometown newspapers
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:08.640]  in New York, I mean, CNN is right there in New York. New York Times is right there in New York.
[1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:13.360]  They didn't bother to look at it. They didn't bother to go in and do what the press almost
[1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:17.360]  always does. And that is to say that the courts have to be open to the people.
[1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:22.160]  No, it took Mike Cernovich coming in from California to do it. And then to their credit,
[1:39:22.160 --> 1:39:26.480]  eventually the Miami Herald did show up as well. And, you know, we were glad for that because
[1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:32.640]  Mike's a, Mike's a small operator and his ability to sustain the protracted battle that this was
[1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:37.680]  was somewhat limited. So when the Herald showed up as the cavalry, I think we, you know, we have
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:44.400]  to recognize that the Herald and Julie Brown at the Herald did a fantastic reporting job.
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:50.160]  And their lawyers, especially a guy by the name of Sanford Borough, did a great job coming in and
[1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:56.400]  fighting alongside of us. And they've really taken over the fight now. But, you know, you got to look
[1:39:56.400 --> 1:40:01.920]  at when you see something like this under wraps like that, when it's a public figure involving
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:07.360]  people at the highest levels of government, potentially. I mean, when you've got, heck,
[1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:14.000]  you know, it at least implicated or the story implicated, the relationship implicated people
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:18.160]  on the Republican and the Democrat side. I want to know what the heck is going on.
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:24.960]  And I just got to ask why anybody else didn't want us to know who didn't want us to know what
[1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:30.400]  didn't they want us to know? And what are they keeping quiet now with Mr. Epstein being quiet?
[1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:36.160]  You know, I really don't know. But these are things that every American should be asking,
[1:40:36.160 --> 1:40:42.720]  because this doesn't just happen. I mean, I just, I don't, I don't sign on to very many theories
[1:40:42.720 --> 1:40:49.280]  that say something is a conspiracy. I'm pretty skeptical when I hear that. I like coincidence
[1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:55.120]  more than conspiracy. But here, I just don't see it. You know, when you have all this quiet,
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:59.600]  and you've got this federal judge who, you know, he didn't die under mysterious circumstances,
[1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:04.400]  the federal judge who initially, I think made the error. You know, he wasn't even buying green
[1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:10.240]  bananas. He was so old. So, you know, the fact that he passed away of natural causes while in
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:17.920]  office did not raise much of a concern with me. But why on earth, this judge did something that
[1:41:17.920 --> 1:41:24.400]  I have never seen a judge do before, and that is allow the parties to simply designate something as
[1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:29.520]  confidential and then keep them from the public eye. You know, I don't want to speak ill of the
[1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:35.280]  dead and I don't want to impute his character. But I would like to know just what he was thinking.
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:40.320]  And, you know, unfortunately, because of nature, we're just not going to know what he was thinking.
[1:41:40.320 --> 1:41:45.760]  And because of Epstein's death, we're not going to know at least his side of the story. And I just
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:53.360]  wonder how many rich and powerful people from wherever all over the world could have been
[1:41:53.360 --> 1:41:59.760]  very deeply embarrassed by what Mr. Epstein had to say. And all we really have to work on right
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:06.960]  now is this 2000 pages of documents and already, already there at least showing us some things
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:13.680]  that we didn't think we knew. At the very least, there are people who were accusing Trump of being
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:19.600]  involved sexually with her, which the documents seem to have disproven. These documents seem to
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:26.800]  show that she claims that Trump flirted with her, but never had any sexual relations with her.
[1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:31.840]  Well, I mean, I know, I know that's going to disappoint a lot of people on the left, but
[1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:36.320]  the truth is the truth. Now I want to know the rest of the truth. And so should you.
[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:42.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, when we get back, we'll discuss more of this. We've also
[1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:47.280]  got other news developing here on the Alex Jones Show, some video clips. There is a presidential
[1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:51.600]  race right now, too. We'll get an update on that. And your phone calls in the fourth hour,
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:57.520]  I'll be sticking around taking your phone calls on all the Epstein fiasco. We'll be right back.
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:26.560]  Ultimate Crill Oil has been sold out for four months. For whatever reason, this became the most
[1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:31.600]  popular fish oil. It's totally full of the bottle. And it is the strongest, purest Crill Oil. And it
[1:43:31.600 --> 1:43:37.360]  cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove
[1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:41.840]  mercury. Any type of Crill Oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like,
[1:43:41.840 --> 1:43:45.600]  but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real. It's been boiled. It's been ruined. It's been
[1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:50.640]  homogenized. This is not good. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality Crill Oil you're
[1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:55.920]  going to find anywhere. Real Crill Oil folks is red. It's not yellow. It's not milky. This is nothing
[1:43:55.920 --> 1:44:01.440]  but Crill Oil. Robert Barnes, what does Big Tech become? Big Tech are big babies that have become
[1:44:01.440 --> 1:44:05.520]  big bullies. And the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social, economic,
[1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:09.760]  political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades. And because of that, that's why
[1:44:09.760 --> 1:44:13.840]  the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this,
[1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:17.360]  the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real
[1:44:17.360 --> 1:44:21.440]  social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct. Otherwise, they will never
[1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:25.520]  change. And they will become the Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:30.080]  century, who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able
[1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:35.120]  to recover after the Great Depression. The informer's audience is the fuel that flames the light of
[1:44:35.120 --> 1:44:40.240]  liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the
[1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:45.120]  original promise of an independent free press. Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating
[1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:49.040]  and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[1:44:49.040 --> 1:44:52.880]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening. It's the ultimate form of
[1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:56.960]  gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[1:44:58.800 --> 1:45:06.480]  Last night, I'm on infowars.com and I read, Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice. It is literally
[1:45:06.480 --> 1:45:11.760]  the shirt that I envisioned. A Betsy Ross, but also another just classic American flag all 50 stars
[1:45:11.760 --> 1:45:17.760]  with the Gadsden snake superimposed over it. And on the back, America's back infowars.com. But
[1:45:17.760 --> 1:45:21.600]  what's better than just an American flag about a don't tread on me under the flag? Take don't
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:24.960]  trail the American flag. It's a perfect combo. So great minds think alike. I mean, whoever designed
[1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:29.760]  that shirt, we'd already come up with the exact same similar design. It is the don't tread on me
[1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:35.600]  American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt.
[1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:39.360]  But it's a, you know, battle tattered flag like the one that flew over Fort Sumter. And again,
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:47.200]  on the back, it says America's back infowars.com. 4,000 of these babies. And that's it. So we've
[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:52.400]  got the Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at infowarstore.com. You're printed in
[1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:57.760]  the USA right now infowarstore.com. We'll be right back. The most banned broadcast in the world.
[1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:04.560]  George Arwell said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:08.880]  And so used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag because we still loved our
[1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:13.600]  country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it. But now they're trying to
[1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:18.080]  take it out of schools. They're taking it down off of government buildings. Weird white leftists
[1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:22.480]  that want a virtue signal are pulling down American flags and running up Mexican flags.
[1:46:22.480 --> 1:46:27.200]  This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing. So now it is a revolutionary act
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:32.560]  at the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the American flag, particularly
[1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:36.720]  the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag. And particularly when it says on the back,
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:43.840]  right there ladies and gentlemen, americasbackinfowars.com. So whatever you do, take action today
[1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:48.800]  and exercise your free speech in these bullies face all over not just the U.S. but worldwide
[1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:52.400]  because more than ever the American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:47:03.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:28.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Owen Schroyer taking over with Mark Randaza.

[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:43.200]  third hour and be joined by Hotep Jesus coming up in the next hour before I get Mark Randaza back

[1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:09.360]  today to make sure that we are on air tomorrow. So here's where we're at, Mark Randazza.
[1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:19.440]  We're supposed to believe in a series of coincidences between security guards not being
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:25.520]  on duty, being off duty, replacement security guards, camera malfunctions, suicide watch removed.
[1:49:25.520 --> 1:49:34.000]  Then they go, apparently people are hearing shrinking, breathe Epstein, breathe, like out of a soap
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:40.240]  opera or something. And then after the whole thing, they have, and I don't even know if I'm buying
[1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:46.000]  this, it almost feels like it's staged, or if they really did it, you have to scratch your head
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:51.120]  and wonder how incompetent these people are. The FBI finally raids Epstein Island. Wow,
[1:49:51.120 --> 1:49:55.520]  really? After you gave how many people, how many months to go clean it out? And believe me, they
[1:49:55.520 --> 1:50:04.160]  did. I mean, they sent in basically a whole cruise of trucks. And I mean, it's like they could have
[1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:09.040]  exhumed anything and everything. The electronics were removed. So here's where I'm at, Mark. Still
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:14.000]  a lot of questions. But I think with what we know, and let's get your take on things we're at right
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:21.520]  now, basically with what we know, this had insider elements, somebody inside this facility
[1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:27.280]  had to pull all of these switches to allow this to happen. It had to be a multiple man job. There
[1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:33.680]  was no way it was one man that did this. And so to me, I'm sitting here saying, wow, we either have
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:39.520]  some powerful dark forces that can pull something like this off right in front of everyone's face
[1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:46.080]  and then have the media lie about it. Or, wow, we've reached a point where things are so serious.
[1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:50.640]  I mean, this is again, I think you can go either way. I think most people think he's dead. But
[1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:56.400]  did they do a dead man switch, put him into witness protection as he's basically turning
[1:50:56.400 --> 1:51:01.920]  over all the documents and cooperating with this investigation? I think, you know, still a lot of
[1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:05.680]  questions. The media is going to continue to tell us one plus one equals three. And if you don't
[1:51:05.680 --> 1:51:09.280]  believe that your conspiracy theories, but where are you at with all the information we have right
[1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:17.280]  now, Mark Randaza? You know, I'm just a natural skeptic. So I'm still willing to believe that
[1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:25.680]  this is just an incredible example of incompetence and coincidence. I'm also willing to believe
[1:51:25.680 --> 1:51:31.680]  that this was an inside job. I'm willing to believe anything because, you know, but right now, I just
[1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:37.520]  think there are too many coincidences for it just to be simple incompetence. But it might be, you
[1:51:37.520 --> 1:51:43.600]  know, there are a lot of people who wind up in American prisons who ought to be watched who
[1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:50.480]  aren't who wind up dead. There are a lot of really incompetent and stupid things that happen in our
[1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:57.280]  prison system. But I got to imagine that if I'm anywhere in the command structure at this prison,
[1:51:57.840 --> 1:52:06.880]  and I know I've probably got the highest value domestic asset that's been arrested in quite
[1:52:06.880 --> 1:52:12.640]  some time, certainly one of the highest value suspects that he's had in that jail. I mean,
[1:52:12.640 --> 1:52:17.760]  this guy is higher on the list than John Gotti who managed to survive until the end of his natural
[1:52:17.760 --> 1:52:23.440]  life. You know, he's sitting in that cell and you're not asking for every single thing to be
[1:52:23.440 --> 1:52:29.600]  perfect. You're not saying everybody watched this guy. You know, I really like to start seeing the
[1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:36.320]  people who are in command at that jail brought before some committees and have a full investigation.
[1:52:37.280 --> 1:52:41.920]  You also, you know, you pointed out this raid on the island. I mean, I've seen these drone pictures
[1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:48.160]  where it appears that in one picture he's got all these computers on the desktop and then by the
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:53.760]  time the raid starts, everything's gone. You know, I would like to know where the heck everything
[1:52:53.760 --> 1:53:00.800]  went and what exactly he's got hidden somewhere because, you know, a guy like him, when you look
[1:53:00.800 --> 1:53:07.680]  at his financial history, there's at least stories that say that he just couldn't have made that kind
[1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:14.240]  of money doing what he was doing. And he had some very questionable deals that nobody could quite
[1:53:14.240 --> 1:53:19.840]  explain, you know, how he managed to sell a piece of real estate at such a high price, for example.
[1:53:19.840 --> 1:53:27.440]  And there's at least speculation surrounding that. Well, this guy was making blackmail money,
[1:53:27.440 --> 1:53:33.120]  you know, he's got to have a little black book somewhere that he hid for his own protection.
[1:53:33.120 --> 1:53:37.680]  And I'd be very curious to know what's happened to that. Now, that picture you just showed,
[1:53:38.560 --> 1:53:42.960]  that might debunk at least one of the pictures I've seen because I've seen a photograph
[1:53:43.760 --> 1:53:48.960]  that was specifically saying that that computer gear disappeared. I showed one drone picture
[1:53:48.960 --> 1:53:53.600]  showing that picture, showing that computer on the desktop, and then the next one showed it gone.
[1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:58.480]  You just showed it wrapped in pink plastic with an officer there. So, you know, I think one thing
[1:53:58.480 --> 1:54:04.240]  we've got to be careful of also is falling victim to how many different conspiracy theories could
[1:54:04.240 --> 1:54:11.360]  come out. I mean, there is just, it's such fertile ground for it. This is just so perfect for any
[1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:18.640]  possible speculation to be true. And I just don't see anybody yet really doing a deep dive on this,
[1:54:18.640 --> 1:54:24.560]  really doing a good job of showing us what the heck's going on. Yeah, that Macintosh that's there,
[1:54:24.560 --> 1:54:31.760]  I recall seeing something that looked like that on a before picture and then an after picture.
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:37.760]  So, you know, maybe that didn't disappear. But how in the heck does this happen? I mean,
[1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:45.520]  how does it happen where this guy has already apparently tried to kill himself? I mean, just
[1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:49.040]  right there. Let's step away from like the governmental involvement. Let's step away from
[1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:54.400]  all of this. I mean, let's just look at the fact that even if this guy just killed himself out of
[1:54:54.400 --> 1:55:02.080]  despair, which I think anybody could imagine, anybody could understand. Think about the nameless
[1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:06.880]  people that are sitting right now in jail cells. Think about the people who do kill themselves
[1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:11.440]  when they should be on suicide watch in our jails. I mean, that's just, you know, that's
[1:55:11.440 --> 1:55:16.800]  somewhat getting buried in all the political intrigue of this. But, you know, our jails are
[1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:22.240]  just a disgrace for a first world country. And that's at least something willing, you know,
[1:55:22.240 --> 1:55:25.920]  that should be looked at. I mean, heck, you think the liberal press would be at least looking at
[1:55:25.920 --> 1:55:32.240]  that saying, you know, if Jeffrey Epstein can't be kept safe from himself, you know, no wonder
[1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:37.200]  Sandra Bland. Well, I think part of that is just the prison, you know, the prison system has become
[1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:42.480]  an industry. And we've kind of gotten away from that, that old school mentality where it's literally
[1:55:42.480 --> 1:55:48.400]  like, I mean, if I'm Attorney General Barr, like, I've got Epstein shackled to my ankle, or like,
[1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:52.960]  you know, latched up to my bed or something, like he's not leaving my site. Yeah. But it's
[1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:57.920]  so easy. It's so industrialized now, you know, it's so packed up that they have to run it this way.
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:04.640]  I mean, I got to say, Mark, I have no doubt. I mean, this is not a coincidence. I mean,
[1:56:04.640 --> 1:56:09.680]  come on. What do you talk about one? What seriously? What do you say? 1% chance coincidence
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:14.560]  incompetence? I mean, this is a hit job. Look, listen, if you're going to ask me to bet my
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:19.520]  retirement on something, I'm not betting it on coincidence. So yes, I'm with you on that.
[1:56:19.520 --> 1:56:24.000]  But let me ask you this as a lawyer who's who's who's dealt with stuff like this before, was it
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:30.560]  odd, the timing of the raid, because they already raided his New York estate, and they got a bunch
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:34.800]  of I mean, you know, they got a bunch of stuff there, like wild stuff, like holy smokes, like
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:41.600]  international crime boss kind of stuff. So was it odd though for them to wait a couple of weeks
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:46.560]  before going to the private island after construction crews have already been out there
[1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:54.320]  and removed? Who knows what? I find it strange because, you know, I mean, you see videos every
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:57:01.920]  day of some low level weed dealer sitting on the couch and then armed cops bash down his door and
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:09.520]  raid the place to save save the Republic from the grave sin of a bag of plants that might get you
[1:57:09.520 --> 1:57:16.000]  high. Meanwhile, this is conducted in such a lackadaisical and we'll get to it when we get to it
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:21.920]  way. Yeah, yeah, I find that really unusual, really bizarre. Yeah, and I think more than anything,
[1:57:21.920 --> 1:57:25.600]  and there's the pictures again, it was August 1st when there were construction crews out there
[1:57:25.600 --> 1:57:31.360]  doing who knows what. Here's the big thing, the big takeaway from all the details. The American
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:34.880]  people are demanding answers, Mark. And I don't think they're going to be able to brush this
[1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:38.720]  thing under the rug with the mainstream media saying one plus one equals three. I think the
[1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:44.240]  American people see one plus one does not equal three. And the media is lying to us telling us
[1:57:44.240 --> 1:57:48.400]  it does and then telling us to shut up something's wrong here. I love watching David Knight in the
[1:57:48.400 --> 1:57:53.440]  morning. I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer. I love all the other shows we do here. But I'll be honest
[1:57:53.440 --> 1:57:58.960]  with you. We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[1:57:59.840 --> 1:58:03.840]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad. But here's the bottom line.
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:08.880]  We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face the globalists not contract.
[1:58:08.880 --> 1:58:14.320]  I don't want them to win. So listen, you got this guarantee from me. We sell enough product,
[1:58:14.320 --> 1:58:19.280]  we'll have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists rough their money.
[1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:24.160]  But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus X2. These will change your
[1:58:24.160 --> 1:58:28.080]  life. Go check out the turmeric products, check out the water filtration, air filtration,
[1:58:28.080 --> 1:58:32.480]  check it all out. Whatever you do, take action and know be part of the Second American Revolution.
[1:58:32.480 --> 1:58:35.440]  Be part of crush the globalist. You get great products at the same time.
[1:58:35.440 --> 1:58:41.760]  M4warStore.com is the umbrella site. M4warLive.com is the supplements. Take action now and fund the
[1:58:41.760 --> 1:58:54.000]  M4war for your own future. What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:59:03.760]  western world history. This is a digital AI enforced gag order. Not to say the name Alex Jones
[1:59:03.760 --> 1:59:14.400]  or M4war.com. This is Nazi Germany level. This is racketeering. This is cartels.
[1:59:14.400 --> 1:59:22.160]  Mr. President, we need your help. We need it now. You can take on Big Tech. They saw M4war as a
[1:59:22.160 --> 1:59:29.280]  dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[1:59:29.280 --> 1:59:34.560]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the
[1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:40.560]  air, everyone else like Dominoes would fall. The way to fight back is to support M4war now more
[1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:45.120]  than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech. Understand that they believe they
[1:59:45.120 --> 1:59:53.920]  can take us down. They'll take everybody else down. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:53.920 --> 2:00:02.720]  Jeffrey Epstein, the elite's pedophile pimp is dead. Something everyone saw coming a mile away,
[2:00:02.720 --> 2:00:08.160]  including Epstein himself, who according to the Daily Mail had told guards that someone was trying
[2:00:08.160 --> 2:00:12.960]  to kill him. An ex-inmate told the New York Post that it would have been impossible for Epstein
[2:00:12.960 --> 2:00:18.880]  to kill himself, yet there is still no way to tell because the staff at MCC is yet to say anything,
[2:00:18.880 --> 2:00:25.360]  even though the incident is of grave national importance when it comes to any American harboring
[2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:31.200]  a shred of trust in the government again. We are told Epstein hanging on to life and soon
[2:00:31.200 --> 2:00:35.920]  to suffer cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital was wheeled out of New York City's
[2:00:35.920 --> 2:00:42.720]  Metropolitan Correctional Center around 7.30 a.m. just a day after co-conspirators had been revealed
[2:00:42.720 --> 2:00:49.840]  in 2015 court documents and 2016 depositions where Virginia Jeffery, who told the Mail on Sunday
[2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:55.280]  that Epstein loaned her out to the high-profile people and claimed that she had to report back
[2:00:55.280 --> 2:01:02.400]  with details relating to blackmail. Jeffery also revealed how Epstein's Madam Ghislaine Maxwell
[2:01:02.400 --> 2:01:08.720]  pimped Jeffery out to powerful names for erotic massages and sex, which included modeling agent
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:14.960]  Jean-Luc Brunel and wealthy financier Glenn Dubin. In those released documents, Dubin's Butler
[2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:20.880]  recounted the testimony of a Swedish teen who had been held against her will on Epstein's notorious
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:37.520]  Pito Island. While modeling agent Brunel was accused of supplying Russian teens that didn't
[2:01:37.520 --> 2:01:43.680]  speak a word of English, signs of an international sex trafficking network. Of course, we are supposed
[2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:49.440]  to believe the Clinton cleanup crew over at the FBI is on top of it and the Justice Department.
[2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:55.040]  And why did former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein pop up at the outset of all of this
[2:01:55.040 --> 2:02:00.720]  anyway? Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein suggested on Twitter that there might not be
[2:02:00.720 --> 2:02:06.000]  more here beneath the surface. He wrote, pedophiles facing criminal charges are at high risk for
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:11.440]  suicide. It happened in several of my Maryland cases when defendants were released on bail.
[2:02:11.440 --> 2:02:17.120]  Detained pedophiles require special attention. Stopping people from harming themselves is
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:22.400]  difficult. But as Cassandra Fairbanks at the Gateway Pundit reported, there aren't any
[2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:28.800]  mainstream media outlets at MCC asking the same question she is. Do you know why Epstein wasn't
[2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:33.360]  on Suicide Watch? I do not know. Do you know if they're going to do a press conference? I do not
[2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:37.840]  know. You'll have to talk to the public information officer. I've been trying, but I haven't been able
[2:02:37.840 --> 2:02:43.360]  to get through. Questions like, were the guards that were stationed to watch Epstein told to
[2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:49.120]  leave the area due to maintenance? Why did the security cameras mysteriously break during the
[2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:56.880]  time of the alleged suicide? Why is there a bruise on Epstein's face? And how did Epstein die exactly?
[2:02:56.880 --> 2:03:04.400]  Also, is the case actually over? If the reports are true, keep in mind, these are co-conspirators
[2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:10.960]  of his, and they have complained it. So if the complainants aren't focused now on Epstein as
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:16.320]  he's dead, they're going to focus on anybody else that was involved. And if those other guys were
[2:03:16.320 --> 2:03:22.320]  involved, and I'm not saying they were, but according to reports, if that's true, then the
[2:03:22.320 --> 2:03:27.200]  investigation just shifts over to them. They could be made to look like a suicide when it was
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:31.280]  something else. And I've handled cases like that. What you have? Yes. What do they look like a
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:36.240]  suicide and they're not? Oh, they set the cases up to make it look like a suicide. In jail. In
[2:03:36.240 --> 2:03:41.760]  jails, as I've had a couple in jail and outside of jail. And what I would always say to my staff is,
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:48.160]  until you can prove otherwise, any unattended death is a murder case. And didn't Galayne Maxwell
[2:03:48.160 --> 2:03:54.320]  aid in a bet? How long before she disappears? And ultimately, how deep does this go? Who did
[2:03:54.320 --> 2:04:01.440]  Epstein work for? His wealth and Saudi Arabian passport remain major mysteries. Sure, it's early.
[2:04:01.440 --> 2:04:07.120]  But the longer these questions go unanswered, the more the people responsible for the incompetence
[2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:21.600]  surrounding Epstein's death create their own undeniable conspiracy. John bound reporting.
[2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:30.080]  What is that tweet from Rod Rosenstein? And then Rosie O'Donnell's response.
[2:04:30.080 --> 2:04:37.920]  Yes. Still a pedophile, child sex trafficker, off himself. And you're upset about that? I mean,
[2:04:42.480 --> 2:04:46.080]  I don't know about that one. That's a little strange to me. All right,
[2:04:46.080 --> 2:04:49.840]  Hotep Jesus is coming up on the other side. We'll get his take on the Epstein stuff.
[2:04:49.840 --> 2:04:54.240]  And then I bet you I could make him laugh. I bet y'all make him laugh, too. That'll be funny.
[2:04:54.240 --> 2:05:01.760]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com,
[2:05:01.760 --> 2:05:06.320]  but also the products at InfoWarsstore.com. And there's one product that's offered at
[2:05:06.320 --> 2:05:11.760]  InfoWarsstore.com that is the elite of the supplements. And that's DNA Force Plus. Now,
[2:05:11.760 --> 2:05:15.600]  I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[2:05:15.600 --> 2:05:21.120]  telomeres and telomere support with your DNA. And so I started to look into the science and
[2:05:21.120 --> 2:05:27.840]  what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[2:05:27.840 --> 2:05:33.600]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive. Why? Because it is an elite
[2:05:33.600 --> 2:05:38.320]  supplement. And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements
[2:05:38.320 --> 2:05:45.120]  for telomere support. And they came and they went. But DNA Force Plus is still there. It is the
[2:05:45.120 --> 2:05:50.000]  elite supplement. I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:55.920]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsstore.com.
[2:06:20.080 --> 2:06:24.320]  All right. We're into the third hour of the Alex Jones show.
[2:06:25.840 --> 2:06:32.160]  Hotep Jesus is joining us now. He once got a free cup of coffee from Starbucks. We all remember
[2:06:32.160 --> 2:06:39.200]  that. And he's made a couple of things go viral on Twitter. And Twitter hates him for it. But here
[2:06:39.200 --> 2:06:44.960]  he is with us today at Hotep Jesus. Before I've promised the audience I'm going to make you laugh
[2:06:44.960 --> 2:06:50.880]  today. I think you're probably maybe the perfect guest to talk about this news with that's just
[2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:58.080]  so ridiculous. But before we do that, what do you make of the Epstein story? I mean, we've got
[2:06:58.800 --> 2:07:03.440]  enough to start to form some theories. You can call them conspiracy theories. What else are you
[2:07:03.440 --> 2:07:07.120]  going to do? They don't tell us the truth. So what we're just going to sit here and just accept a
[2:07:07.120 --> 2:07:13.040]  lie and just live our lives like that's acceptable? No. So what do you think is going on here? What
[2:07:13.040 --> 2:07:16.560]  do you think the response has been from America? Do you think they're going to get away with this
[2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:21.840]  cover up of Jeffrey Epstein? Not just how he died, but the whole industrial level pedophile
[2:07:21.840 --> 2:07:25.680]  network he was running. That's the real cover up here. Hotep Jesus, you think you're going to get
[2:07:25.680 --> 2:07:31.600]  away with this? Absolutely. Football season about to start back up. Nobody care about anything.
[2:07:35.200 --> 2:07:40.160]  People are arguing about how much that press Scott is going to be paid. And
[2:07:40.160 --> 2:07:44.640]  then this is the, I mean, the distractions have been in abundance today. Yeah. Wasn't there like
[2:07:44.640 --> 2:07:47.680]  a football player that like said he wanted to play without a helmet or something?
[2:07:48.880 --> 2:07:57.520]  It's a lot of distractions. The day of Epstein's alleged death of the Molly Cyrus breakup thing
[2:07:57.520 --> 2:08:02.240]  happened. I'm like, Oh, this is convenient. Heartbreaking. Right. Like we're supposed to
[2:08:02.240 --> 2:08:07.120]  care about that. Did you see Trump tweeted about that in 2013? Did you see that whole thing?
[2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:15.840]  What? Trump was traveling through time and he went back to 2013 and tweeted how he felt bad
[2:08:15.840 --> 2:08:24.880]  for Molly Cyrus's breakup. He hopped in his time machine. There you go. You made me laugh.
[2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:28.960]  I wasn't even trying with that one. But you know, sadly, sadly though, I think you're right. But
[2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:33.200]  I guess that's kind of the, I guess this is kind of the tipping point, right? Where it's like,
[2:08:33.200 --> 2:08:38.800]  are we going to have America kind of fall back in line of, Oh, you know, what did Molly Cyrus do
[2:08:38.800 --> 2:08:43.600]  for lunch now that she's single and, you know, what's, what's going to happen before the next
[2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:48.720]  NFL season starts or kind of the normal distractions? Or will America stay tuned to this? Be like,
[2:08:48.720 --> 2:08:52.320]  wait a second, there's that pedophile network that was being exposed. Anything ever happened
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:59.440]  to that? I mean, it's kind of a tipping point right now. I mean, the Hoy Paloy are entranced in
[2:08:59.440 --> 2:09:06.160]  a stupor controlled by the ruling elite. The socialists run this whole thing. And the problem is
[2:09:06.160 --> 2:09:12.640]  people aren't even intelligent enough to know what to do from here. We, I mean, we saw that there
[2:09:12.640 --> 2:09:17.120]  was a green. So the first time in forever, the left and the right agreed that there's something,
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:22.560]  something fishy going on with this Epstein death. But like we said, our hotel has been told to me,
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:27.520]  Uncle Hotel was talking about it. We said, but he asked me, he said, yo, you think he's going to get
[2:09:27.520 --> 2:09:32.160]  away? Do you think, do you think he's going to make it to trial? And he asked me that because he
[2:09:32.160 --> 2:09:36.240]  knew what I was going to say because I was going to agree with him. No, he wasn't going to make it
[2:09:36.240 --> 2:09:40.560]  to trial. That's what we assume. And I said in that same episode, I said, yo, I think they're
[2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:46.480]  going to pull the body double stunt, right? Cambers are all prison guard, ain't supposed,
[2:09:46.480 --> 2:09:53.280]  isn't really a correctional officer, all these different, you know, whatever, whatever. I mean,
[2:09:53.280 --> 2:09:58.000]  it's so fishy, but it's like, is the public really going to unite? Or what, what we're,
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:03.520]  what I've been saying is this has actually reignited the war between the left and the right.
[2:10:03.520 --> 2:10:09.040]  Because now we're arguing, is it Trump's guy or is it Clinton's guy? Right? Instead of, can we
[2:10:09.040 --> 2:10:13.760]  find out who's on these lists? Can we do a full investigation? Then they went down to his island
[2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:20.080]  and, and ransacked that. You don't, you mean to tell me nobody ran the island and put a couple
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:25.200]  of things in a pocket where nobody was looking? Come on, man. It's a lot of things that's going
[2:10:25.200 --> 2:10:29.840]  on. The whole island thing is a distraction. You ran down there to start the investigation.
[2:10:31.920 --> 2:10:36.720]  That happened in New York. Why is the investigation happening on his property? I could have been
[2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:41.840]  went down there and got his property. Well, and it's all going to even, it's all going to even
[2:10:41.840 --> 2:10:48.000]  more complex now with the family and genuinely the family might not have any clue either. And so
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:53.040]  they might genuinely, because they were the ones that hired that famous, that famous guy to do the
[2:10:53.040 --> 2:10:57.680]  autopsy who's done JFK and all these other things. And they want to say, oh, because they're worried
[2:10:57.680 --> 2:11:02.080]  now that this might affect the estate that they were supposed to inherit. So there's all kinds
[2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:07.040]  of weird stuff going on right now. We can't forget about the royalty over the pond that would also
[2:11:07.040 --> 2:11:13.040]  want Epstein dead. So it's really just wacky wild stuff. And you, and you have to say, if this is
[2:11:13.040 --> 2:11:20.160]  a 1% chance, a case of incompetence, then I mean, we've got something else that we have to look at.
[2:11:20.160 --> 2:11:25.520]  But to me, this is a, this is a case where, I mean, there should be investigations happening
[2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:30.400]  in to every person that was on the scene that night, every single one of them, their bank
[2:11:30.400 --> 2:11:33.760]  accounts, their activities, their spending, I mean, literally everything because
[2:11:35.680 --> 2:11:41.680]  there's no way he could commit suicide. We know that. And based on all the coincidences,
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:46.560]  there had to be at least one or two men on the inside to pull this whole thing off.
[2:11:48.800 --> 2:11:51.040]  I saw James Bond enough to know how this is done.
[2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:57.360]  Yeah, but you saw James Bond before, you saw James Bond before it was a transsexual transracial
[2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:05.920]  dinosaur. The new James Bond. It's the new James Bond is supposed to be a woman.
[2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:11.520]  Yeah, I know, but next it'll be a transsexual dinosaur problem just to really keep things
[2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:18.720]  interesting because more than likely, absolutely. I saw today that they're teaching LGBT in an
[2:12:18.720 --> 2:12:25.040]  Illinois public school. And there's almost like, so, but that's like the behind the scenes thing.
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:29.280]  It's like, as this pedophile network is being exposed, one of probably dozens,
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:35.680]  this is getting exposed. And then the background is like drag queen story time for kids. Love has
[2:12:35.680 --> 2:12:41.520]  no age. Bay Bay Rex, a pop artist tweeted out today that any age can be sexy. I'm like,
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:45.120]  well, wait a second, are you guys trying to tell us like, oh, there's no problem with
[2:12:45.120 --> 2:12:52.560]  the pedophile island? It's cool. That planet is run by androgynous reptilian shapeshifters.
[2:12:55.120 --> 2:13:01.680]  There it is right there. Come on, media matters. Right all along. When he was talking about what
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:06.800]  Alex Jones said, a gay frog, right? And what David Ike said, he said it was lizard people, right?
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:14.800]  So maybe, maybe what these people are tapping into this intelligence that these people are
[2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:24.480]  tapping into might have some validity, you know, well, I mean, look, nobody covered and talked
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:29.280]  about pedophile networks and Epstein and all the involvement like infowars. It nobody did that
[2:13:29.280 --> 2:13:33.920]  most people were too scared. I mean, again, I'm not saying I'm not even making a claim
[2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:37.600]  about Alan Dershowitz and whatever potential involvement or lack thereof. But of course,
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:40.800]  he wouldn't want to talk about it. Of course, people around him wouldn't want to talk about it.
[2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:44.720]  I mean, nobody would want to talk about this. They're all connected. And that big pile of
[2:13:44.720 --> 2:13:48.720]  blackmail is just sitting out there and they don't know what, you know, they don't know what could
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:53.040]  come of it. So I think it's kind of like, okay, you don't touch it. Now here we are. They say,
[2:13:53.040 --> 2:13:56.880]  but, but here's the thing, how can they do this where they say one plus one equals three.
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:02.240]  And then it's like, you're not even allowed to question this. You're not even allowed to say,
[2:14:02.240 --> 2:14:06.160]  how did this happen? You're not even allowed to look at the events and say, no, this couldn't be.
[2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:10.320]  They say, oh, it's a, it's one plus one equals three. The New York Times was supposed to be seen
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:16.240]  in MSNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS, nothing to see here. Anybody that questions what we tell you is just
[2:14:16.240 --> 2:14:25.040]  a conspiracy theorist and dangerous. It's scary, but we're run by the Fabians. The Fabians run
[2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:32.080]  this whole show, the trilaterals, the CFRs. They're the ones running the show. We keep looking at the
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:37.280]  White House and all these other entities. The founding fathers already told you who it was.
[2:14:37.280 --> 2:14:45.040]  You study Andrew Jackson and tell you what time it was. This, these, these Orwell warned us.
[2:14:47.280 --> 2:14:52.880]  It is what it is. Now they're, now they're digitally burning books too. They're banning books. So,
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:15:00.080]  but the whole world is really changing. The only way to take complete control of something is to
[2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:07.600]  centralize power. And in our country, what we have is centralization of power. If we recognize the
[2:15:07.600 --> 2:15:13.600]  power of the media and we look at the media and we see that the media is centralized, we find our
[2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:19.680]  corporate. If we look at our monetary system, when we find that our money is centralized,
[2:15:19.680 --> 2:15:25.680]  we find our corporate. If we look at our TV and movies and we find that that's centralized,
[2:15:25.680 --> 2:15:32.080]  we have found our corporate and those corporates are in cahoots. But that's the same stuff that keeps
[2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:38.400]  the people distracted. You did it. And then again, if you question it or you don't even have to
[2:15:38.400 --> 2:15:43.520]  question it, at this point, you just lay out basic facts and they'll say, oh, you're a conspiracy
[2:15:43.520 --> 2:15:48.880]  theorist. It's like, uh, no, I'm not. I've seen, could not have committed suicide. Shut up. I saw
[2:15:48.880 --> 2:15:56.720]  it on TV and the FBI said you're a terrorist cause you're a conspiracy theorist. Maybe not today,
[2:15:56.720 --> 2:16:03.200]  maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive. Forget bunkers. You're not

[2:18:59.920 --> 2:19:04.400]  ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were close to the
[2:19:04.400 --> 2:19:09.360]  ground close to reality who actually work for a living that would end up saving the nation and
[2:19:09.360 --> 2:19:15.440]  today the communist chinese have banned all us farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive
[2:19:15.440 --> 2:19:20.960]  increases in polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once china
[2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:25.920]  put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't going to be bullied and we

[2:19:46.720 --> 2:19:57.280]  the night we are the resistance we are 1776 worldwide.
[2:19:57.280 --> 2:20:13.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:23.440]  all right now this is the segment welcome back to the alex jones show
[2:20:23.440 --> 2:20:28.000]  i'm sure you're feeling in this is the segment i told hotel jesus that i would make him laugh
[2:20:28.800 --> 2:20:33.920]  so i'm gonna do that right now we talked about the epstein craziness but let's uh
[2:20:34.880 --> 2:20:38.560]  let's pivot here and just kind of look at the world and because we tend to forget
[2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:45.120]  the cultural decay the societal decay and then we see mass shootings and all this tragic stuff
[2:20:45.120 --> 2:20:49.440]  and we're like oh blame the gun blame this well let's look at society as a whole and say hmm
[2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:54.320]  maybe we're just degenerating so i saw this story today on yahoo news headline
[2:20:54.880 --> 2:21:01.040]  chlamydia vaccine shows promise in early tests i'm sitting here thinking so the whole thing is
[2:21:01.040 --> 2:21:04.720]  they're gonna get you're gonna get a chlamydia vaccine so you don't have chlamydia they just
[2:21:04.720 --> 2:21:08.400]  give you a chlamydia to be a chlamydia vaccine just add it to the you know dozens of vaccines
[2:21:08.400 --> 2:21:12.000]  we give kids now giving them chlamydia that's the next thing and so i'm sitting here thinking
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:21.760]  hmm why would we need a chlamydia vaccine and then i saw this story drive-in sex boos proposed
[2:21:21.760 --> 2:21:29.600]  for berlin's historic templehof airport ah now i see why we need a chlamydia vaccine you know we
[2:21:29.600 --> 2:21:35.600]  never talk about the cultural rot the societal degeneracy uh hotel jesus and then we see tragic
[2:21:35.600 --> 2:21:40.320]  events like mass shootings or or just political violence in the streets and we want to blame
[2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:45.840]  everything nobody wants to look internally as a society as a whole and say man we've kind of
[2:21:45.840 --> 2:21:50.080]  turned into sodom and gemora here you know no wonder we're seeing all this stuff
[2:21:52.560 --> 2:22:00.000]  yeah um you need chlamydia vaccine if you're dealing with petals they must be preparing the
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:06.640]  kids for what they about to do the one maybe that's what it is um what was that story you just read
[2:22:06.640 --> 2:22:12.320]  that you associated it with so i didn't hear that the first story comes from a chlamydia vaccine
[2:22:12.320 --> 2:22:18.960]  story out of yahoo news it's actually coming out of paris driving sex booth and then driving sex
[2:22:18.960 --> 2:22:26.080]  booth and then yeah driving sex booths coming for berlin's the airport uh debauchery on tilt
[2:22:28.480 --> 2:22:34.080]  so uh so yeah if you go to berlin now there uh well first you gotta fly to france they'll hit
[2:22:34.080 --> 2:22:39.840]  you with the chlamydia vaccine then you can fly to berlin and uh hop in a sex booth and romp away
[2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:45.120]  the new world isn't it great
[2:22:47.200 --> 2:22:54.720]  yo what's wrong with us yo what's wrong with us the people what people if you're listening what
[2:22:54.720 --> 2:23:01.120]  are you doing this is why alex jones needs to sell fallout gear because we're not going to get it
[2:23:01.120 --> 2:23:09.440]  until it's time to fall out like get your buckers man get your buckers ready because it's going down
[2:23:09.440 --> 2:23:15.360]  i'm good yo when they pull this all this stuff you talking about i'm going underground bro i'm not
[2:23:15.360 --> 2:23:20.800]  dealing with this bro i'm i'm going to africa with you know they say africa is like the new
[2:23:20.800 --> 2:23:27.360]  wild wild west it's still uncharted territory out there you can still quote unquote colonize
[2:23:27.360 --> 2:23:36.720]  something that hasn't been colonized yet um america i see as being done with it with finito of in fact
[2:23:36.720 --> 2:23:41.520]  britain is further along in the communist socialist plot than we are although we're
[2:23:41.520 --> 2:23:48.960]  complicit in the matter and we're consumed by it all um but at this point what we what we have to
[2:23:48.960 --> 2:23:54.720]  remember is that there's no middle class in this social society so there's either going to be poor
[2:23:54.720 --> 2:24:03.760]  or the haves right so it behooves everybody right now to get your shit together and and start investing
[2:24:04.400 --> 2:24:11.440]  because it's about to go down and if you're not well off you're going to be poor that's just that
[2:24:11.440 --> 2:24:17.040]  just is what it is and and yang gang wants to make us poor with this ubi right and wants to give
[2:24:17.040 --> 2:24:22.240]  everybody money he wants to increase the money supply and wants to create inflation and and
[2:24:22.240 --> 2:24:30.160]  and everybody that's on the left is this is of socialism the right is no different socialism
[2:24:30.160 --> 2:24:36.320]  everywhere the publicans have over 14 policies that they've supported that are socialist in nature
[2:24:36.320 --> 2:24:42.160]  everything from food stamps down the guns we saw something pass last week was what what passed last
[2:24:42.160 --> 2:24:50.400]  week with the guns in the white house or was there a new legislation put forth after those
[2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:55.040]  shootings i mean this is this is stuff that you have to do in a common society you have to uh
[2:24:57.600 --> 2:25:02.640]  yeah yeah the red flag exactly the red flag stuff you see this is what you have to do in a
[2:25:02.640 --> 2:25:08.240]  common society you got to disarm the people um and and and the problem is people are actually
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:12.720]  jumping into that argument they're actually having that debate with the left there is no debate for
[2:25:12.720 --> 2:25:18.960]  the second amendment and a lot of people like to talk about additional amendment to me i'm stopping
[2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:26.160]  at the bill of right everything after that is fool fool right for the most part um i'm sticking
[2:25:26.160 --> 2:25:34.320]  with the first ten and the first two are so important uh but if you allow the second amendment
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:40.000]  to be up for debate you're basically saying that their concerns are valid their concerns are not
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:44.160]  valid when we look at the population united states i don't know what is it 400 million something like
[2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:53.200]  that somebody correct me um but uh we had 250 some odd mass shootings this year in my mind i go well
[2:25:53.200 --> 2:25:58.800]  i'm surprised it's not a thousand surprises not 10 000 i look at it and go good job america we're not
[2:25:58.800 --> 2:26:04.320]  mass shooting killing each other because i would expect them to be much higher than that and they
[2:26:04.320 --> 2:26:11.840]  allow us to they allow us to be fooled and say oh there's some uh you know epidemic that uh you
[2:26:11.840 --> 2:26:18.880]  know of homophobia or transphobia you know and they use those steps and they inflate those numbers
[2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:24.800]  and use statistics and you know some odd weird shape form to contort and match their views but
[2:26:24.800 --> 2:26:29.440]  it's it's the fact that we allow these things to become a debate that makes them valid their their
[2:26:29.440 --> 2:26:35.520]  claims are not valid even statistically they're not valid their claims when the girls had the
[2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:41.120]  world cup we found that per capita the girls are paid more than the guys in the in the in the world
[2:26:41.120 --> 2:26:47.200]  cup on the on the professional team so so so we there's nothing to have a debate about the
[2:26:47.200 --> 2:26:52.720]  second amendment is not up for debate not for debate it is what it is you want to talk about
[2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:57.680]  why is mass shootings let's let's talk about mental health and we're not socializing that
[2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:02.560]  and we don't have we really need to have a commission that investigates all these mass
[2:27:02.560 --> 2:27:07.360]  shooters i mean really delve deep into their lives i mean let's look at their family let's
[2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:12.240]  look at their diet let's look at what pharmaceutical pills are on i mean let's really do a commission
[2:27:12.240 --> 2:27:16.400]  if we really want to find this out because you're not going to disarm americans uh that's just simply
[2:27:16.400 --> 2:27:20.880]  not going to happen and you don't want to see what would happen and again this whole red flag
[2:27:20.880 --> 2:27:25.920]  law thing look at how they would use it against people where they say oh if you're a conspiracy
[2:27:25.920 --> 2:27:30.720]  theorist you're now a domestic terrorist it's literally an fbi document and so then they say
[2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:34.960]  hey uh jeffrey ebsene committed suicide in his prison cell there's nothing to see here
[2:27:34.960 --> 2:27:38.560]  and then you say well wait a second there is something to see here why wasn't the camera
[2:27:38.560 --> 2:27:45.680]  working why wasn't uh suicide watch on why wasn't this why the uh oh we got a conspiracy theorist
[2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:51.360]  sorry you we have to take your firearms that's where this goes yeah and that's and that's another
[2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:56.240]  problem we're allowing them to contort language the term conspiracy theorist conspiracy means
[2:27:56.240 --> 2:28:02.400]  for people to conspire and we know that people conspire all the time the term theory uh means
[2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:07.040]  that you have to first have a hypothesis you have to carry out experiments do these experiments
[2:28:07.040 --> 2:28:12.720]  you have to find evidence to support your hypothesis so we're not conspiracy hypothesizing
[2:28:12.720 --> 2:28:17.440]  it's not a theory until it has evidence and the problem is people don't want to look at the evidence
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:22.800]  of these so-called conspiracy theories but the problem is we already allow people to contort
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:26.800]  our english language if you read orwell's political teachings and writings speeches and
[2:28:26.800 --> 2:28:33.680]  writings you'll see it in there when he says they'll change what words mean so we we have to stop it
[2:28:33.680 --> 2:28:40.400]  right there all right all right well i didn't get to this story but i figured that you'd be really

[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:20.160]  all right before i take your calls on the epsi stuff let me checklist a couple things off here
[2:36:20.160 --> 2:36:30.640]  first this is big news because this is common sense and this should have happened a long time ago
[2:36:31.920 --> 2:36:40.160]  and that is a new policy for immigration where by the way trump had a deal with the old president
[2:36:40.160 --> 2:36:45.600]  of guatemala now there's a new president that deal looks like it may not work out they were flying
[2:36:45.600 --> 2:36:49.840]  people back to guatemala i think that may stop that was big and they were stopping people at
[2:36:49.840 --> 2:36:54.240]  guatemala that may change now so that's going to be an interesting development as far as that's
[2:36:54.240 --> 2:37:01.840]  concerned but trump policy is from the new york times yesterday or two days ago trump policy
[2:37:01.840 --> 2:37:06.560]  favors wealthier immigrants for green cards and then yesterday you had the trump administration
[2:37:06.560 --> 2:37:13.920]  giving a press conference on what this actually means uh uh guys this is clip one in my video
[2:37:13.920 --> 2:37:21.760]  list trump administration now planning to deny green cards to immigrants on public assistance
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:28.880]  all right um
[2:37:31.840 --> 2:37:39.920]  okay well let's just not do videos then i'll just do a new splits here we'll just do that okay
[2:37:39.920 --> 2:37:48.000]  okay let me just shuffle through the picture all right let's take a look then
[2:37:50.960 --> 2:37:53.680]  at what's going on on the democrats out of this presidential race now
[2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:58.720]  it's honestly embarrassing at this point that the democrats are even trying to put up a fight
[2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:07.440]  uh it really is an embarrassing joke and i see headlines like this and i just laugh
[2:38:07.440 --> 2:38:18.400]  laugh elizabeth warren wows crowd in iowa as the caucus begins elizabeth warren wows the crowd in
[2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:28.160]  iowa uh elizabeth warren hasn't wowed anything ever although i do think she did another video
[2:38:28.160 --> 2:38:32.640]  on instagram a couple nights ago drinking a beer so some people may have said wow at that
[2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:43.120]  but yes wows elizabeth warren wows wows the audience okay how about beto orork
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:49.200]  he wows the audience pulling at zero percent now he does a video trying to change a tire
[2:38:49.840 --> 2:39:00.400]  couldn't even do it beto orork attempts to change a tire live on video oh yes this will
[2:39:00.400 --> 2:39:09.600]  certainly get you from zero percent to one percent beto this is the one this is the video
[2:39:09.600 --> 2:39:16.480]  that will get beto elected if he's not going live from the dentist chair if he's not going live
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:23.920]  with his dog looking like an abuse victim if he's not skateboarding across the stage he's
[2:39:23.920 --> 2:39:34.960]  changing a tire it's beto oh if he's not what is that wait a second did beto orork
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:43.040]  get a haircut live on video too is that real oh my gosh what a dork man these guys like butters
[2:39:43.040 --> 2:39:50.000]  from south park when they go up to butters and they're like they're like oh are there any other
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:55.600]  people in there and he goes yeah there's construction butters there's a truck driver butters that's

[2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:07.680]  there's guitar playing beto it's like that's literally butters and they think he has a
[2:40:07.680 --> 2:40:13.120]  split personality disorder no he's just like beto pretends to be all of these people it's
[2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:18.640]  the funniest thing he thinks is going to get him elected oh but let's not forget about the real
[2:40:18.640 --> 2:40:30.240]  threat marianne williamson with her mind powers marianne williamson says powerful forces on the
[2:40:30.240 --> 2:40:37.520]  left out to end presidential campaign well she's actually right and if she was smart and if tulsi
[2:40:37.520 --> 2:40:45.200]  gabard was smart tulsi gabard would team up with marianne williamson right now if marianne williamson
[2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:51.120]  actually believes this because tulsi knows this is going on she's suing google she knows the democrat
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:54.720]  party doesn't want her to get the nomination she just has enough confidence that she thinks she can
[2:40:54.720 --> 2:41:02.160]  beat a rigged system marianne williamson might not feel the same way but she is right the democrat
[2:41:02.160 --> 2:41:10.080]  party has been rigging their selection for president for a long long time ladies and gentlemen
[2:41:10.080 --> 2:41:20.080]  now do we have clips ready to go can i get the two kamala harris clips is that possible
[2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:30.800]  all right never mind i said we wouldn't do video so just forget tell me if this is not
[2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:41.440]  discrimination california city denies straight pride rally permit now imagine if you wanted to
[2:41:41.440 --> 2:41:48.000]  have a gay pride parade in california rejected your permit can you imagine the headlines can you
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:57.360]  imagine what the press would be saying if you deny a gay pride parade but if it's a straight
[2:41:57.360 --> 2:42:05.440]  pride parade shut it down you see we only want to have a parade if it's going to be sexualizing
[2:42:05.440 --> 2:42:10.080]  the kids and a bunch of guys uh you know going around flashing their genitals everywhere a
[2:42:10.080 --> 2:42:15.200]  bunch of women flopping around with their tops off you know that's the kind of pride parade we
[2:42:15.200 --> 2:42:21.200]  want but you want to have a straight pride parade that will probably be modest you know just just
[2:42:21.200 --> 2:42:26.240]  stay at home we're not interested in that you know that's that's not the kind of thing we're
[2:42:26.240 --> 2:42:34.880]  interested in and this is from campus reform video student signed petition to ban offensive white
[2:42:34.880 --> 2:42:42.880]  man in crosswalk signs oh my gosh i forgot the man in the crosswalk sign is white and therefore
[2:42:42.880 --> 2:42:48.240]  racist we should make the man black therefore you can't even see the crosswalk sign that way you
[2:42:48.240 --> 2:42:52.960]  walk into the middle of the street and die you see that's one way to cure racism is to walk in
[2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:59.440]  the middle of street get ran over a car and die thomas jefferson predicted over 240 years ago
[2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:04.080]  that when our republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground
[2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:08.880]  close to reality who actually work for a living that would end up saving the nation and today the
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:15.120]  communist chinese have banned all u.s farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in
[2:43:15.120 --> 2:43:20.800]  polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once china put pressure on our
[2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:26.800]  farmers that's beautiful americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down so to

[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:26.000]  krill oil has been sold out for four months for whatever reason this became the most popular
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:31.200]  fish oil it's totally full of the bottle and it is the strongest purest krill oil and it cost us
[2:45:31.200 --> 2:45:37.120]  three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury
[2:45:37.120 --> 2:45:41.440]  any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps which i don't like but gives you
[2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:45.200]  all the great benefits isn't real it's been boiled it's been real and it's been amodized

[2:46:01.600 --> 2:46:05.920]  year and i feel like i'm stealing from you i buy so much in the store because i mean i don't want
[2:46:05.920 --> 2:46:09.040]  to give that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to
[2:46:09.040 --> 2:46:12.960]  causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm getting quality products the
[2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:18.000]  products that i do receive have changed my life i mean the x2 has really done a lot for me i've lost
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:22.720]  weight my brain works a whole lot better i think my kids they use the toothpaste my son used to get
[2:46:22.720 --> 2:46:26.880]  to these little sore throats and he puts x2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore
[2:46:26.880 --> 2:46:31.760]  throat uh let me break this down for you i want high quality stuff in there i want a good price
[2:46:31.760 --> 2:46:36.480]  but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50 off i'm making two
[2:46:36.480 --> 2:46:40.800]  dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric
[2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:45.520]  or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people get the patriot points a lot
[2:46:45.520 --> 2:46:49.600]  of times it makes things a loss leader because if you're already getting 10 off because you're on
[2:46:49.600 --> 2:46:53.840]  autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do something like that uh where you have patriot
[2:46:53.840 --> 2:47:01.200]  points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support you're listening to the alex
[2:47:01.200 --> 2:47:12.640]  jones show
[2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:27.600]  all right we're going to take your phone calls big developments happening in hong kong
[2:47:27.600 --> 2:47:35.280]  as protesters choke airport and chinese forces bass at border i've been told that riot police
[2:47:35.280 --> 2:47:38.720]  have gone into the airport this is just what we're seeing imagine what we're not saying but
[2:47:39.760 --> 2:47:47.760]  not only are american flags making an appearance in the hong kong protests pepe the frog pepe the
[2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:58.560]  frog is now going viral in hong kong as a symbol of resistance so this is just wacky wild stuff
[2:47:58.560 --> 2:48:04.800]  happening and it was almost like the president was trolling china today or the hong kong protests
[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:08.880]  saying uh i forget the tweet but he basically was like why are they blaming us for this
[2:48:10.720 --> 2:48:16.000]  maybe because we love freedom and we hate communism i don't know but we're taking your
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:23.280]  calls right now because here's the other thing too we cannot let this obscene thing die we cannot
[2:48:23.280 --> 2:48:29.120]  let them cover up industrial level pedophile networks that implicate some of the most powerful
[2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:35.200]  names in the world we cannot just let them sweep this under the rug via murder or whatever the hell
[2:48:35.200 --> 2:48:40.560]  went on so i want to just talk to the audience i mean let's really get let's let you've heard
[2:48:40.560 --> 2:48:43.760]  what we think here you've heard some of our theories i mean yeah oh you're not allowed to
[2:48:43.760 --> 2:48:50.080]  be a conspiracy theorist yeah go yeah okay we know what you can do if you're if you're
[2:48:50.080 --> 2:48:56.000]  going to tell us to uh not think critically so let's go to this critically thinking audience
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:49:03.520]  right now let's go to let's see let's start with chase the patriot in california go ahead chase
[2:49:04.480 --> 2:49:08.720]  hey oh and thanks for taking my call real quick i do want to say that i'm with those
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:14.560]  fellow patriots in hong kong standing up against that communist chinese government it's very strong
[2:49:14.560 --> 2:49:19.760]  to see those american flags wave but hey i'm calling on this epstein thing and you know there's all
[2:49:19.760 --> 2:49:24.240]  these different theories out there and a lot of times it sounds like it's too crazy to be true
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:29.280]  so one of them is the body double they switched epstein there was a body double and yeah that
[2:49:29.280 --> 2:49:36.800]  sounds crazy but let's go back in history a little bit lee harvey oswald assassinated jfk very similar
[2:49:36.800 --> 2:49:41.920]  to epstein somebody took him out and killed him shot in the gut right in front of the world to see
[2:49:41.920 --> 2:49:46.800]  well do you guys understand that people thought there was a body double after that and they actually
[2:49:46.800 --> 2:49:53.600]  exhumed lee harvey oswald's body in 1981 to prove that it actually was him so this isn't the first
[2:49:53.600 --> 2:49:57.840]  time people have questioned and talked about a body double actually i was talking about this last
[2:49:57.840 --> 2:50:03.040]  night on my show and the number of people that have been taken out both good bad and ugly people
[2:50:03.040 --> 2:50:08.320]  from michael hastings the will cooper i mean the list goes on and on people need to understand
[2:50:08.320 --> 2:50:14.080]  that they will take people out for to keep the deep state in line well that's what this comes down
[2:50:14.080 --> 2:50:18.240]  to it's just like look i don't know what happened i mean was there a body double was there not was
[2:50:18.240 --> 2:50:23.760]  it suicide was he murdered was he choked i mean but that's one thing is they're saying oh you can't
[2:50:23.760 --> 2:50:30.080]  question this we're in control of the narrative and if you question this you know you're a bad
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:35.280]  guy you're a conspiracy theorist no this is not cut and drive of course we're going to question
[2:50:35.280 --> 2:50:40.320]  this this is a huge cover-up we're witnessing right now and they just want to sweep it under the rug
[2:50:40.320 --> 2:50:48.320]  and use all the international globalist media to just say oh financier was suicided now okay and
[2:50:48.320 --> 2:50:55.120]  the big thing that people are making here is that the nose in the picture that we've received and i
[2:50:55.120 --> 2:51:00.640]  guess the ears too basically saying that no it's a different guy that's the body double i mean if
[2:51:00.640 --> 2:51:06.720]  that's the case then you think they took them into witness protection and this whole thing is just
[2:51:07.360 --> 2:51:12.880]  uh a front to cover for that uh thanks for the call chase let's go to brady in virginia go ahead
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:19.360]  brady hey what's up bowen thanks for taking my call man um i just wanted to say as far as you
[2:51:19.360 --> 2:51:26.400]  know your broadcast yesterday with epstein um i think you completely hit it home um and i'm really
[2:51:26.400 --> 2:51:30.080]  glad that you guys are staying on top of that because it's so important that we keep talking
[2:51:30.080 --> 2:51:34.560]  about it because it seems like time and time again that when things like this come up they just get
[2:51:34.560 --> 2:51:40.400]  swept under the rug and and they never get talked about again and there's things that are as high
[2:51:40.400 --> 2:51:47.520]  level as this that they need they need to be taken care of and uh so i'm really glad that you guys
[2:51:47.520 --> 2:51:54.960]  were on top of that yesterday um as far as the the trump green card policy goes i look at that and i
[2:51:54.960 --> 2:52:00.800]  think you know that's just common sense i mean we've got so many hardworking americans out there
[2:52:00.800 --> 2:52:06.080]  looking for jobs just like with the story that came out today you've got people that are now
[2:52:06.080 --> 2:52:11.840]  applying for jobs at stores where these illegals were working after these raids and so i look at
[2:52:11.840 --> 2:52:16.640]  that i'm thinking well that's that's just common sense so if somebody is on you know government
[2:52:16.640 --> 2:52:21.120]  benefits of course they should be more likely to be deported that's that's just common sense
[2:52:23.520 --> 2:52:28.080]  well and that's all we're looking for is common sense policies like for example why aren't we
[2:52:28.080 --> 2:52:34.960]  deporting the 30 percent of the prison system that is made up of non-citizens illegal immigrants
[2:52:35.520 --> 2:52:39.920]  and you have the left saying well look or the democrats are just any bleeding heart liberal
[2:52:39.920 --> 2:52:46.160]  or whatever we'll say we're a nation built on immigrants immigrants have always come here and
[2:52:46.160 --> 2:52:52.320]  built america okay sure they didn't get on welfare that's the whole thing for example you know there
[2:52:52.320 --> 2:52:56.720]  was this bud Budweiser commercial anhyzer bush commercial it was like two years ago during the
[2:52:56.720 --> 2:53:01.280]  Super Bowl and and i kind of thought unfairly maybe i'm just biased because i'm from st. Louis
[2:53:01.280 --> 2:53:07.760]  i'm directly tied to this but uh i thought of some unfair criticism where they they did this
[2:53:07.760 --> 2:53:15.440]  commercial about how uh the original augustus bush came over and teamed up with anhyzer to make
[2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:22.160]  a beer product you know came over on the ship to america to make his beer well to me that's the whole
[2:53:22.160 --> 2:53:27.520]  point i didn't take it like oh you know we should just let anybody come here i took it like no you
[2:53:27.520 --> 2:53:32.640]  come here with a dream you come here with an idea you come here with a purpose you come here with
[2:53:32.640 --> 2:53:38.480]  the will you execute that's the american dream that's the american way you come here and ask for a
[2:53:38.480 --> 2:53:43.760]  handout you come here and suck off the system no that's the communist way we don't do that here
[2:53:43.760 --> 2:53:48.960]  and so that's all this is to me it's saying look sure we want immigrants to build things create
[2:53:48.960 --> 2:53:57.280]  things innovate invent add to society we don't want people to come here and have no prospects
[2:53:57.280 --> 2:54:02.960]  no future and just end up sucking off the system and to me that just is common sense as you said
[2:54:02.960 --> 2:54:08.480]  thanks for the call brady let's go to michael in washington dc go ahead michael hey well when
[2:54:08.480 --> 2:54:15.040]  first time caller i've been a long time fan of the show um i also by the way wanted to
[2:54:15.040 --> 2:54:21.280]  do a plug i did uh support the money bomb that you guys did recently i got my through my vitalities
[2:54:21.280 --> 2:54:27.280]  would be 12 i got a cure for my dad for his uh birthday who loves it and um about this whole
[2:54:27.280 --> 2:54:35.040]  ebbs season thing uh you know i saw i think it was on uh fox ten ten star was in the news
[2:54:35.040 --> 2:54:41.200]  talking about it in like how they're he was kind of tied to etstein and the one thing that kind of
[2:54:41.200 --> 2:54:47.120]  jumped out at me is that i think he's actually remember the book he grow um it was like really
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:53.920]  an esoteric you know thing i had seen and then just to touch on that uh come on immigration
[2:54:53.920 --> 2:54:58.880]  you know i think it's a double x sort because you have these people that are saying oh you know
[2:54:58.880 --> 2:55:05.600]  we need to preserve american values but the same time they will find every exception for people
[2:55:05.600 --> 2:55:12.080]  that really don't deserve it for example you know like texas v johnson where like they allowed a
[2:55:12.080 --> 2:55:18.320]  communist to burn a flag that wasn't his private property he stole it from a public building and
[2:55:18.320 --> 2:55:22.640]  that's now being described as you know freedom of speech so what's in the next freedom of speech
[2:55:22.640 --> 2:55:27.920]  is like that we're supposed to defend criminals that come over the border and attack us are they
[2:55:27.920 --> 2:55:32.400]  supposed to be you know their right to express of conduct by crossing the border is that freedom of
[2:55:32.400 --> 2:55:38.400]  speech it's just ridiculous well yeah i mean they go take down the american flag at ice facilities
[2:55:38.400 --> 2:55:43.280]  in fact there's just a story someone went and just shot up i think last night the san antonio ice
[2:55:43.280 --> 2:55:50.560]  facility in fact i just i sent that out see if you can print that but so they're continuing to do this
[2:55:50.560 --> 2:55:58.240]  in the oh i can't even get into this alexander ocasio cortez is she is just she's falling off the
[2:55:58.240 --> 2:56:04.240]  rocker i don't know it's just insane but yeah i guess that's what they'll do next it's like
[2:56:05.440 --> 2:56:10.480]  if you even criticize an illegal immigrant you know well that's what they do now in canada in the
[2:56:10.480 --> 2:56:14.640]  uk if you say the wrong pronoun you go to jail thanks for the call michael uh let's squeeze in
[2:56:14.640 --> 2:56:20.640]  bennie in california go ahead bennie i was going on oh and um i just want to say three things first

[2:57:39.920 --> 2:57:43.120]  who wants to be involved in saying oh trump is covering up that thing

[3:00:38.080 --> 3:00:41.520]  to take your phone calls on the other side of this break but i want to play these videos i
[3:00:41.520 --> 3:00:45.440]  meant to earlier first let's go to the trump administration making the announcements about
[3:00:45.440 --> 3:00:51.920]  their new policy on green cards and public assistance today u.s.c i asked the agency i
[3:00:51.920 --> 3:00:57.120]  had as part of the department of homeland security has issued a rule that encourages
[3:00:57.120 --> 3:01:05.120]  and ensures self-reliance and self-sufficiency for those seeking to come to or to stay in the
[3:01:05.120 --> 3:01:11.760]  united states it will also help promote immigrant success in the united states as they seek
[3:01:11.760 --> 3:01:18.240]  opportunity here through the public charge rule president trump's administration is reinforcing
[3:01:18.240 --> 3:01:24.480]  the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility ensuring that immigrants are
[3:01:24.480 --> 3:01:31.760]  able to support themselves and become successful here in america our rule generally prevents
[3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:37.360]  aliens who are likely to become a public charge from coming to the united states or remaining
[3:01:37.360 --> 3:01:44.640]  here and getting a green card public charge is now defined in a way that ensures the law is
[3:01:44.640 --> 3:01:50.480]  meaningfully enforced and that those who are subject to it are self-sufficient critics are
[3:01:50.480 --> 3:01:56.560]  saying this policy is unfairly targeting the lower income immigrants have you responded that
[3:01:56.560 --> 3:02:01.360]  well we certainly expect people of any income to be able to stand on their own two feet and so
[3:02:02.160 --> 3:02:07.440]  if people are not able to be self-sufficient then then this negative factor is going to
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:12.320]  bear very heavily against them in a decision about whether they'll be able to become a legal
[3:02:12.320 --> 3:02:20.000]  permanent resident and a poor person can be prepared to be self-sufficient many have been
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:24.720]  through the history of this country so let's not look at that as the be all and end all it's not
[3:02:24.720 --> 3:02:30.000]  the deciding factor which is why we continue to use the totality of circumstances test
[3:02:31.680 --> 3:02:38.560]  and so this is just common sense america is not a charity we already give out
[3:02:40.080 --> 3:02:44.720]  trillions over time but hundreds of billions of dollars annually to all these countries
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:50.400]  for humanitarian aid and then they just send all their people here and we pay for them again so
[3:02:50.400 --> 3:02:57.360]  it's it's just a system that's totally failed us now kamala harris boy what a clown uh first

[3:09:26.880 --> 3:09:37.680]  and let's go to anthony calling in from california go ahead anthony hey um this is a pretty intense
[3:09:37.680 --> 3:09:43.920]  thing for me i've got a uh documentary i've been working on since 2015 called homeowners
[3:09:43.920 --> 3:09:48.960]  and it encompasses basically deep fakes and some of the tools that were used were called mellow
[3:09:48.960 --> 3:09:54.480]  dine um and that was before the deep fake video was really a big thing they were using audio
[3:09:54.480 --> 3:10:00.160]  and what they had done is um these uh feminist man haters here in central california were
[3:10:00.160 --> 3:10:06.480]  punishing actually just info wars listeners kind of a side rant i was thrown in jail uh on a 1370
[3:10:06.480 --> 3:10:12.480]  specifically for um running the info wars research team on facebook before it was shut down um
[3:10:12.480 --> 3:10:19.120]  that's actually on the documents there said anybody who who will uh promote info wars uh
[3:10:19.120 --> 3:10:26.640]  or or who uses them as a an icon to the world is obviously incompetent and cannot be trusted
[3:10:26.640 --> 3:10:33.280]  with their own children on a side note also i have with me um i'm sorry i'm about ready to cry
[3:10:33.280 --> 3:10:37.280]  i'm a Mormon priest a veteran of 23 years i've spent my entire life traveling the world to
[3:10:37.280 --> 3:10:41.680]  ukraine um another place is i bought human trafficking victims with my own money and brought
[3:10:41.680 --> 3:10:48.720]  them to safety i have a Mormon kid 21 years old here with me and uh i'm working on this
[3:10:48.720 --> 3:10:54.560]  documentary that i have um his mother works with facebook as an accountant and this was
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:10:58.960]  here in the last few weeks i had had them admit these things that they'd been selling this foster
[3:10:58.960 --> 3:11:05.360]  child um so is there anywhere people can go access this information or see your documentary
[3:11:05.360 --> 3:11:11.680]  yes i actually have i've requested these um for several years um the public defender's
[3:11:11.680 --> 3:11:16.080]  office is actually working on getting me the documents that list info wars research team
[3:11:16.080 --> 3:11:21.760]  as the complete sole justification for removing custody of children um so wait a second i'm just
[3:11:21.760 --> 3:11:26.080]  i'm sorry i'm sorry but you're not your message is kind of confusing me right now so i imagine
[3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:31.520]  the audience is confused as well are you saying that you went to jail and had your kids taken
[3:11:31.520 --> 3:11:39.280]  from you because you posted about info wars yes sir in 2016 um no no no again you're trying to
[3:11:40.320 --> 3:11:45.760]  do you have this documentation i did 100 i will go to prison let somebody execute me if i don't
[3:11:48.240 --> 3:11:51.440]  okay well i i'm just saying like i don't really know how to handle this because you're kind of
[3:11:51.440 --> 3:11:58.160]  throwing a bunch of stuff at me here and um i mean if you want this information out i mean is like i
[3:11:58.160 --> 3:12:01.680]  said is there like a do you have a social media account is there anywhere we can go access this
[3:12:01.680 --> 3:12:06.160]  stuff so we can show what you're talking about here sorry sir over in news alliance is where i
[3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:10.960]  post most of my information like currently we're on the lookout for a person who was convicted
[3:12:10.960 --> 3:12:16.000]  of um automizing two infants and is running through turlock and that's what i said what is the name
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  of the website now these people on the street as a street priest so it's pretty complex but
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:24.720]  if i narrow it down to the individual no fat little things um well i'll tell you what i got to
[3:12:24.720 --> 3:12:28.800]  take another call guys put them on hold and get his information and if we can find this
[3:12:28.800 --> 3:12:34.000]  documentation we may have interest in in writing up a story uh yeah if you're uh getting your kids
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:40.720]  taken from you and going to jail for posting about info wars yeah uh that's pretty overwhelming stuff
[3:12:40.720 --> 3:12:50.400]  all right let's go to nick in arizona go ahead nick hello hi hey there so uh so when i was listening
[3:12:50.400 --> 3:12:56.640]  to uh uh to the show this morning to alex and they were talking about freddo qualmo and when
[3:12:56.640 --> 3:13:01.280]  he was on that video he said he was an actor i thought that was kind of an interesting thing
[3:13:01.280 --> 3:13:06.560]  because i guess that's cnn and s ms are you sure i'm pretty sure he said anchor it sounded like
[3:13:06.560 --> 3:13:11.920]  actor to me well either way he is an actor yeah because everything they do is fictitious anyway
[3:13:11.920 --> 3:13:16.080]  right but isn't that the thing that's the thing about that video that screams to me more than
[3:13:16.080 --> 3:13:21.920]  anything is just like we've all seen that guy before like we've all seen the big tough guy
[3:13:21.920 --> 3:13:26.880]  who wants to puff up his chest and and get all big and and make a scene that's what komo was doing
[3:13:26.880 --> 3:13:30.480]  right and and the whole thing where they're saying oh he was being harassed his family's being
[3:13:30.480 --> 3:13:34.400]  no that's bs i'm seeing a bunch of people stand out that's not what happened he was asked to take
[3:13:34.400 --> 3:13:38.080]  a picture people asked me to take pictures all the time people troll me all the time i mean give
[3:13:38.080 --> 3:13:43.360]  me a break you know so so this whole thing like standing up for komo and i don't even care the
[3:13:43.360 --> 3:13:50.960]  point is he's a jerk that's what the video shows the guy is a jerk i agree well and you know the
[3:13:50.960 --> 3:13:55.680]  other thing i saw yesterday you guys were talking or had somebody on the show that was talking about
[3:13:55.680 --> 3:14:03.360]  the luciferians and um i ended up googling a video on youtube about them um and how they
[3:14:03.360 --> 3:14:09.200]  gained rank by doing vile things um so isn't that wouldn't that maybe be something that could have been
[3:14:09.200 --> 3:14:18.880]  a root cause for the upstream death or what do you mean well if the luciferians are devil
[3:14:18.880 --> 3:14:25.280]  worshipers uh or satan worshipers and if they do bad things to other people or to children or that
[3:14:25.280 --> 3:14:31.760]  type of thing uh and ebbstein wanted to get out per se maybe he was a luciferian um and somebody
[3:14:31.760 --> 3:14:38.640]  went off to him wouldn't they then gain rank within that uh that crowd of people well i don't know i
[3:14:38.640 --> 3:14:43.120]  mean and probably not i mean this is this is an inside job there's no way an outsider could have
[3:14:43.120 --> 3:14:51.840]  gotten in um i mean you're looking at again i mean we're conspirator conspiracy theorizing here
[3:14:51.840 --> 3:14:56.160]  because we can't get the truth but you're looking either at people inside getting paid off there's
[3:14:56.160 --> 3:14:59.840]  an investigation going on right now two workers have already been put on administrative leave
[3:14:59.840 --> 3:15:04.720]  the warden has already been transferred so there's already an investigation going on maybe multiple
[3:15:04.720 --> 3:15:10.960]  people paid off uh maybe this whole thing's a stunt and he's he really is being put into
[3:15:10.960 --> 3:15:17.440]  witness protection i don't know but when everybody's when everybody predicts that this guy's gonna
[3:15:17.440 --> 3:15:23.200]  end up dead and then he ends up dead and then we get no answers you know it's obviously there's
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:28.720]  something happening here that really powerful people don't want us to know about and so whenever
[3:15:28.720 --> 3:15:34.480]  that's going on you know there's a major cover-up and you know there's a major conspiracy and you
[3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:39.840]  know that the american media that's bought and paid for is going to do everything they can to try to
[3:15:39.840 --> 3:15:47.600]  keep this story under wraps all right more calls coming up more calls coming up this is the alex
[3:15:47.600 --> 3:15:53.760]  jones show go to infowarsstore.com during this break and take advantage of the big sale hi i'm
[3:15:53.760 --> 3:15:58.320]  dan pilla i started fighting the iris over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house

[3:17:56.960 --> 3:18:00.960]  outlook yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of
[3:18:00.960 --> 3:18:05.440]  people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees
[3:18:05.440 --> 3:18:09.920]  with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war
[3:18:09.920 --> 3:18:14.320]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public
[3:18:14.320 --> 3:18:19.040]  the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[3:18:19.040 --> 3:18:22.800]  the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my
[3:18:22.800 --> 3:18:26.640]  friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut
[3:18:26.640 --> 3:18:32.000]  you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years

[3:20:38.480 --> 3:20:52.480]  all right we're taking your phone calls here welcome back to the alex jones show
[3:20:53.360 --> 3:21:00.480]  me pepper in a couple headlines here see this one russia opens any trust inquiry into app
[3:21:00.480 --> 3:21:09.200]  restrictions at apple and then this is kind of funny because there's this whole twist like
[3:21:10.240 --> 3:21:12.880]  it's just like the media just hates russia i don't understand but
[3:21:15.760 --> 3:21:21.040]  here's a story the headline is russia tells google's russia tells google not to advertise
[3:21:21.040 --> 3:21:30.880]  illegal events after election protest now the real story here is that russia knows what google is
[3:21:30.880 --> 3:21:37.360]  doing and they're saying stop it it's like it's like if president trump came out and said hey google
[3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:42.880]  as a new project veritas media is about to drop uh president trump comes out and says
[3:21:42.880 --> 3:21:51.280]  hey google stop meddling in us elections by rigging search results and then they say america
[3:21:51.280 --> 3:21:57.200]  tells google not to advertise that's basically what they're saying about russia no google is in
[3:21:57.200 --> 3:22:02.400]  russia trying to manipulate a bunch of protests and and and foment a bunch of riots and stuff
[3:22:03.040 --> 3:22:08.880]  and so russia's just saying knock it off but you know russia's russia's not allowed to exist
[3:22:08.880 --> 3:22:17.680]  all right let's go back to your phone calls and let's start with let's start with let's go to
[3:22:17.680 --> 3:22:24.480]  jeff in canada go ahead jeff hey g'day on hey i got a point about eppstein but uh
[3:22:25.360 --> 3:22:31.280]  something else i want to just touch on i was thinking about fredo today and it was really
[3:22:31.280 --> 3:22:39.120]  gnawing at me who does he remind me of and then it hit me it's lefto he totally reminds me of
[3:22:39.120 --> 3:22:46.800]  lefto lefto the clown you and lefto the clown yeah my buddy lefto the clown yeah i think you guys
[3:22:46.800 --> 3:22:52.720]  should you know approach uh fredo and see if you guys can hook it up and take it on the road what
[3:22:52.720 --> 3:22:58.080]  do you think maybe they can do like a workout video or something and see if they use the same
[3:22:58.080 --> 3:23:05.040]  uh steroids yeah like a best of life uh i like the uh the happies too you know you there's lots
[3:23:05.040 --> 3:23:12.640]  of possibilities there man i mean i think chris kwomo feels bad i wonder if he wasn't intoxicated
[3:23:13.440 --> 3:23:18.640]  but but seriously the guy behaved like a jerk and you know what i mean that's what i'm saying i
[3:23:18.640 --> 3:23:22.400]  think everybody has seen a guy like that before or a moment like that before and it's just like
[3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:29.360]  wow like you're just an embarrassment like you're just a you're just a rude jerk
[3:23:29.360 --> 3:23:35.920]  offered a thing i think that that is hashtag fredo the clown uh i don't know fredo kwomo
[3:23:35.920 --> 3:23:41.120]  fake news fredo but now he's fredo forever now i bet if you plug in google it's probably nothing
[3:23:41.120 --> 3:23:46.000]  but chris kwomo it probably used to be like two days ago you plugged fredo into google you get
[3:23:46.000 --> 3:23:51.520]  fredo now you plug fredo into google you get chris kwomo by the way uh is this total proof of the
[3:23:51.520 --> 3:23:56.400]  simulation yesterday was the actor who played fredo's birthday
[3:24:01.760 --> 3:24:09.840]  anything else jeff yeah point about epstein um you know magically all the time it happens that
[3:24:09.840 --> 3:24:16.000]  these cctv cameras aren't working it happened with chef rich what happened to him and jesse small
[3:24:16.000 --> 3:24:23.280]  it and there's always these these cameras that just magically go down when something big is
[3:24:23.280 --> 3:24:29.760]  happening and i think you know maybe look at the angle of like racist camera manufacturers or
[3:24:29.760 --> 3:24:35.280]  something you know there's something else to that so i don't know i think it's uh there's there's
[3:24:35.280 --> 3:24:41.280]  some other angle with the camera manufacturers how they they uh there's nothing to see here jeff
[3:24:41.280 --> 3:24:46.320]  there's nothing to see here with seth rich the media told me there's nothing to see here with
[3:24:46.320 --> 3:24:52.960]  jeff ryepstein the media told me so you just take those conspiracy theories and stuff them in a sock
[3:24:52.960 --> 3:25:00.560]  mister all right let's go to carlos in canada go ahead carlos thank you very much um i have a
[3:25:00.560 --> 3:25:07.520]  report that i wanted to give to alex a few days back and in the interim of course uh jeff ryepstein's
[3:25:07.520 --> 3:25:13.920]  uh uh demise but i wanted to bring it to your attention today because it's very relevant
[3:25:13.920 --> 3:25:19.360]  there are a lot of conspiracy theories out there floating around and fortunately i'm from montreal
[3:25:19.360 --> 3:25:27.120]  and i'm from the broughman territory here where a lot of these um want to call it honey traps um
[3:25:27.120 --> 3:25:35.600]  and mega as was known at a time um were really had inception israel is really a country that had
[3:25:35.600 --> 3:25:41.600]  been running and now i believe you will never hear of this kind of activity again because
[3:25:41.600 --> 3:25:46.880]  something happened but uh israel was running honey traps uh everywhere i mean it was a way
[3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:53.440]  of getting intelligence and and and mutually exclusive relationships uh prove that in fact
[3:25:53.440 --> 3:26:00.160]  these honey traps were not like standard mosa operations like uh jonathan pollard with a
[3:26:00.160 --> 3:26:06.960]  headner like rafi itan rather these these operations were handled very much from the
[3:26:06.960 --> 3:26:13.360]  prime minister's office or someone who was ex-prime minister like ahud barack now you have
[3:26:13.360 --> 3:26:18.480]  individuals who are very pro-israel and they're very cooperative as you would have with for example
[3:26:18.480 --> 3:26:30.240]  edgard broughman or or or mr leslie um uh yes yes other individuals that were uh fomenting
[3:26:30.240 --> 3:26:37.040]  and encouraging intelligence gathering jeff riencey was running a very high level operation
[3:26:37.040 --> 3:26:43.840]  and i began to notice this when jis lane maxwell was mentioned because i had researched uh robert
[3:26:43.840 --> 3:26:51.440]  maxwell and his relationship with mosa and here we now find the continuance all along of that
[3:26:52.000 --> 3:26:59.040]  basically uh sets up one not only one but several several um honey traps one of them
[3:26:59.040 --> 3:27:06.320]  was general petraeus and paula broadwell if you google uh gilad online writings israel
[3:27:06.320 --> 3:27:16.240]  petraeus wasn't faithful to us there is a report from a high level israeli uh initials were bb
[3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:23.280]  fortunately says paula broadwell came to israel as part of a cadet exchange program when she
[3:27:23.280 --> 3:27:29.120]  was at west point and ended up in a position to help these exchange programs with the military
[3:27:29.120 --> 3:27:35.040]  and law enforcement are really paying off now this we don't know look there's no doubt i mean we got
[3:27:35.040 --> 3:27:41.200]  it from the nix of them's uh sex cult too and i'm sure you could go on for days uh with with
[3:27:41.200 --> 3:27:46.640]  your report here i don't have the days and i got other callers to get to but yes what we know is
[3:27:47.280 --> 3:27:54.560]  there's major blackmail lists there's major intel operations epstein is connected to all of them
[3:27:55.280 --> 3:28:00.080]  and you know and you just wonder at a certain level how independent epstein was from this
[3:28:00.080 --> 3:28:05.840]  or how much he was blackmailed himself potentially uh into doing this he was just so in deep with it
[3:28:05.840 --> 3:28:11.200]  all that he had to do it too but yes intelligence agencies using honey pots and honey traps to
[3:28:11.200 --> 3:28:17.760]  get information it's what they tried to do to george popadopolis um and then with people like
[3:28:17.760 --> 3:28:23.920]  epstein they just have lavish parties and they get you know powerful men or women in compromising
[3:28:23.920 --> 3:28:29.920]  situations maybe under the influence and then you've got potential blackmail or you invite
[3:28:29.920 --> 3:28:33.200]  them into another situation where you can really get them with even worse blackmail
[3:28:36.080 --> 3:28:42.000]  so um yeah it's crazy world some of it's coming out right now with this whole epstein thing
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:46.240]  but we have to continue to report on it otherwise it'll just disappear all right we'll take more

[3:30:08.000 --> 3:30:11.840]  best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and
[3:30:11.840 --> 3:30:15.840]  instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the
[3:30:15.840 --> 3:30:18.560]  biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[3:30:18.560 --> 3:30:23.280]  wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved
[3:30:23.280 --> 3:30:29.360]  supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say
[3:30:29.360 --> 3:30:33.520]  that a supplement has been through the fda because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but
[3:30:33.520 --> 3:30:38.080]  then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to
[3:30:38.080 --> 3:30:41.920]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work
[3:30:41.920 --> 3:30:46.320]  great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[3:30:46.320 --> 3:30:52.960]  god's medicine chest info or store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[3:30:54.080 --> 3:31:00.320]  thomas jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the
[3:31:00.320 --> 3:31:05.440]  future it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground close to reality who actually work for a
[3:31:05.440 --> 3:31:10.160]  living that would end up saving the nation and today the communist chinese have banned all us
[3:31:10.160 --> 3:31:16.160]  farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president
[3:31:16.160 --> 3:31:21.760]  and what he's doing in this trade war once china put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful
[3:31:21.760 --> 3:31:27.040]  americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down so to the walking
[3:31:27.040 --> 3:31:31.600]  cruises and the hillary clinton's the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down
[3:31:31.600 --> 3:31:36.080]  we're never going to give up and all you've done is awaken the human spirit and the human spirit
[3:31:36.080 --> 3:31:42.080]  lives at info wars dot com and news wars dot com and i'm asking listeners whatever you do spread
[3:31:42.080 --> 3:31:48.720]  those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the resistance we are 1776 worldwide
[3:31:54.720 --> 3:31:59.120]  it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing
[3:31:59.120 --> 3:32:04.480]  that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed by a
[3:32:04.480 --> 3:32:08.800]  corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being
[3:32:08.800 --> 3:32:13.120]  funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old
[3:32:13.120 --> 3:32:18.720]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of
[3:32:18.720 --> 3:32:22.960]  speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually
[3:32:22.960 --> 3:32:27.840]  tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they
[3:32:27.840 --> 3:32:32.320]  wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporation
[3:32:32.320 --> 3:32:37.120]  or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the
[3:32:37.120 --> 3:32:41.840]  person's allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that
[3:32:41.840 --> 3:32:46.720]  the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate american democracy
[3:32:46.720 --> 3:32:50.640]  and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming
[3:32:50.640 --> 3:33:06.560]  defamation lawfare and libel targeting you you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:06.560 --> 3:33:22.080]  there are major developments happening in hong kong right now ladies and gentlemen
[3:33:25.440 --> 3:33:32.560]  and what it means for the global power structure we can only wait and see
[3:33:32.560 --> 3:33:41.680]  see you also had a major nuclear test explosion in russia and they're evacuating
[3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:48.160]  that area you had a stabbing happen in sydney where the guy is screaming alahu akbar stabbing
[3:33:48.160 --> 3:33:57.120]  people and then taken down by some brave citizens but don't worry folks all is well because the
[3:33:57.120 --> 3:34:06.240]  university of london is going to ban all beef burgers and become carbon neutral by 2025 so
[3:34:06.240 --> 3:34:14.800]  congratulations all right let's go back out to the phone lines and go to dean in virginia go ahead
[3:34:14.800 --> 3:34:22.880]  dean uh hello all you polar bear juniors out there spreading the word of info wars and i want to
[3:34:22.880 --> 3:34:29.200]  thank you guys for being the tip of the spear it kept me motivated for over 15 years but what's
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:37.040]  amazing is you got the highest valued witness ever and they put him in a rinky dink little jail
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:42.960]  with allegedly 24-hour surveillance i think well i don't know you can't really call this a rinky
[3:34:42.960 --> 3:34:48.560]  dink jail el chapo was there you've had isis terrorist there uh i think bernie madeoff may
[3:34:48.560 --> 3:34:55.840]  have even stayed there i mean it's a high profile jail okay now you got the guy that can bring down
[3:34:55.840 --> 3:35:02.320]  the entire democratic party and then some i would have put him someplace a little different
[3:35:03.360 --> 3:35:08.960]  but be that as it may when you're talking about global domination you got to get rid of the people
[3:35:08.960 --> 3:35:15.440]  that could bring it down but i'm really surprised with him that he did not or maybe had created
[3:35:15.440 --> 3:35:23.520]  some kind of documentary about himself and videotape occasionally everybody involved with his
[3:35:23.520 --> 3:35:30.560]  parties and or flights and or violent trips just for safekeeping that if and when anything were
[3:35:30.560 --> 3:35:37.840]  to happen to me what do you think yeah the dead man switch that we never saw he had a little black
[3:35:37.840 --> 3:35:44.080]  book they've recovered that who knows what they have i mean look we're we get nothing we're the
[3:35:44.080 --> 3:35:48.160]  american people we pay for the whole thing we get nothing except a bunch of questions and a bunch of
[3:35:48.160 --> 3:35:55.920]  lies and no justice seemingly but we'll see i mean look this is yeah it's show time it's show time
[3:35:55.920 --> 3:36:01.840]  dean uh thanks for the call let's go to peter calling in from new orleans the big easy go ahead
[3:36:01.840 --> 3:36:08.240]  pay it hey oh and this is peter i love you guys love info wars but i gotta tell you i'm really
[3:36:08.240 --> 3:36:13.360]  angry i don't know about the other info warriors around the country but for me to get the highest
[3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:20.080]  valued asset uh in u.s history uh in hearing that he got killed in jail under the trump administration
[3:36:20.080 --> 3:36:26.640]  he was like losing kennedy's brain i i find it hard to believe you know i i want you guys to
[3:36:26.640 --> 3:36:33.440]  hold from speed to the fire he he was strangled once there was a one attempted suicide or strangled
[3:36:33.440 --> 3:36:42.400]  and he didn't get him out of there well i would i mean i mean you want to be fair but i don't
[3:36:42.400 --> 3:36:46.640]  even think if this was under obama i'd be blaming obama i'm looking at uh gen uh attorney general
[3:36:46.640 --> 3:36:51.920]  bar if i'm pointing the finger at anybody i'm saying attorney general bar should have been the
[3:36:51.920 --> 3:36:58.080]  one to do something about this i would have had him uh either chained to my ankle or or chained
[3:36:58.080 --> 3:37:06.000]  to my bed post so basically you know he's under my 24 7 surveillance but now you have to open up new
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:10.720]  investigations to see how he was killed of course if that's even what happened again i'm not even
[3:37:10.720 --> 3:37:14.640]  convinced that's what happened they could have body switched him i mean who knows it's so crazy
[3:37:15.440 --> 3:37:22.640]  as far as your anger is concerned look everybody's angry i mean but what we've been sitting here
[3:37:22.640 --> 3:37:28.240]  covering mainstream lies for decades so it's just like par for the course for us uh where's the rest
[3:37:28.240 --> 3:37:33.200]  of america that is finally waking up realizing they've been lied to for so long that's that's my
[3:37:33.200 --> 3:37:49.120]  question all right thanks for the call let's go to ernie in wisconsin go ahead ernie

[3:38:02.320 --> 3:38:09.120]  right here and everybody just needs to be talking about it taking action doing viral videos talking
[3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:13.600]  to their friends and family and talking about it at your local church group your bible study your
[3:38:13.600 --> 3:38:23.520]  coffee your book club whatever so this story doesn't go away and they cannot cover up this

[3:38:43.360 --> 3:38:47.840]  just kind of going out on a limb not sure how far they can go with this but maybe we can start
[3:38:47.840 --> 3:38:53.040]  looking into some legalities on but we can hold those guys that we're watching the surveillance
[3:38:53.040 --> 3:38:57.280]  esteem you know hold them accountable for negligent well they already are you yeah that's already
[3:38:57.280 --> 3:39:03.200]  happening uh two of the people involved in that have been put on leave and the warden has been
[3:39:04.080 --> 3:39:09.520]  moved to a new facility right i understand that but i'm saying hold it up to where we can see it
[3:39:09.520 --> 3:39:13.360]  let's see how they're gonna you know try them what's going to be coming of this if they're
[3:39:13.360 --> 3:39:17.920]  going to flip flop they're gonna say hey look something happened because obviously like the
[3:39:17.920 --> 3:39:21.760]  previous caller said there was already one try on him we should have moved him we didn't
[3:39:21.760 --> 3:39:25.280]  they've already got names we know that there's plenty of names he has he's already released them
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:29.840]  so there's plenty of people shaking their boots man it'd be nice to get them all it really would
[3:39:31.920 --> 3:39:38.000]  dead men tell no tales and we get no answers really that's that's the pathetic thing about it all
[3:39:38.960 --> 3:39:43.760]  thanks for everything guys appreciate you yep thank you for the call let's go now to
[3:39:43.760 --> 3:39:52.720]  eric in colorado go ahead eric hello owen hello hey there how you doing well i'm doing great eric
[3:39:52.720 --> 3:39:58.480]  fantastic well amazing give me the opportunity to send out prayers for everybody all over the
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:06.320]  planet to finally taste some freedom but i wanted to talk about the word conspiracy and how it is
[3:40:06.880 --> 3:40:13.520]  lodged in the collective unconscious incorrectly and maybe like saying plan when we're talking
[3:40:13.520 --> 3:40:17.760]  about a plan would help people get along because i noticed people like stumble on the word when they
[3:40:17.760 --> 3:40:22.400]  say it and some people think that it means something theoretical together not even something
[3:40:22.400 --> 3:40:28.400]  real but that's my whole belief it's like so you're saying there's never been a conspiracy
[3:40:28.400 --> 3:40:34.560]  throughout the history of mankind no no even if a conspiracy is accurately describing a plan in
[3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:39.760]  conversation linguistically things have been broken for some people and how they understand
[3:40:39.760 --> 3:40:45.760]  words lots of people are somewhat illiterate not understanding words like anarchy meaning no rulers
[3:40:45.760 --> 3:40:53.600]  not being no rules anomy a no mie means no rules anarchy means no rulers kind of like in my opinion
[3:40:54.480 --> 3:40:59.200]  you know term limits that's kind of like anarchy they aren't rulers they're just there for a little
[3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:06.160]  while because we want them there you don't understand i'm just saying anybody who gets this
[3:41:06.160 --> 3:41:10.320]  response like if you say oh you're you're a conspiracy theorist so well my response is
[3:41:10.960 --> 3:41:14.960]  so what are you you're a non-thinker you don't think critically you believe everything you're
[3:41:14.960 --> 3:41:19.040]  told you don't think there's any conspiracies out there you don't think the media that will
[3:41:19.040 --> 3:41:24.400]  but that's the assumption is that oh the media will tell us no you learn real quick the media is
[3:41:24.400 --> 3:41:31.040]  a bunch of liars when you really pay attention plans there are tactics which can be described
[3:41:31.040 --> 3:41:37.840]  as a conspiracy but when you say conspiracy to someone they immediately think that it is not a
[3:41:37.840 --> 3:41:46.960]  real thing because of the way the word has been used i understand what you're saying i i i mean
[3:41:46.960 --> 3:41:52.960]  you can say a plan theorist you can say whatever you want the point is when jeffrey eppstein dies in
[3:41:52.960 --> 3:42:00.800]  a jail cell and there's a camera malfunction they took him off suicide watch we don't have any
[3:42:00.800 --> 3:42:06.640]  surveillance tape they're screaming breathe eppstein breathe apparently uh weird stuff with
[3:42:06.640 --> 3:42:13.840]  the photos being released all this all these anomalies uh yeah i think it's fair to say that
[3:42:14.560 --> 3:42:17.920]  there's some sort of a conspiracy happening here when the media comes out and says
[3:42:17.920 --> 3:42:23.760]  don't even question the narrative or you're to blame and then the fbi says you're a domestic
[3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:30.160]  terrorist so so i mean you can say whatever you want and yeah people don't like the word conspiracy
[3:42:30.160 --> 3:42:38.320]  i'm simply saying i'll own being a conspiracy theorist because i'm a critical thinker i don't
[3:42:38.320 --> 3:42:44.160]  listen to mainstream news that are proven liars i know that there's shadow powers that be
[3:42:44.880 --> 3:42:49.920]  that go unquestioned by the media so yeah i'm a conspiracy theorist and conspiracy theorists
[3:42:49.920 --> 3:42:56.080]  keep being right about this stuff it's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with

[3:49:07.120 --> 3:49:11.440]  your guys's continued efforts in shining light in the dark places now you guys are really doing
[3:49:11.440 --> 3:49:16.880]  a great job there and continue the fight for for all these patriots out there uh you know we can beat
[3:49:16.880 --> 3:49:21.920]  this fc horse to death you know we all know that one plus one the media is trying to make it equal
[3:49:21.920 --> 3:49:27.200]  free but it's not adding up but uh you know let's take it all the way back to 2008 and things that
[3:49:27.200 --> 3:49:33.280]  are not being exposed when he was first brought into the court system in palm beach and his initial
[3:49:33.280 --> 3:49:38.560]  deal was struck for child trafficking and pedophilia and then the deal was struck with a sheriff who
[3:49:38.560 --> 3:49:44.160]  recommended and oversaw his work release and i'm using air quotes program uh where he was allowed
[3:49:44.160 --> 3:49:50.400]  to continue his behavior and so when that was you know briefly exposed in the media down here the
[3:49:50.400 --> 3:49:56.080]  sheriff himself you know thought about doing his own internal investigation didn't want any outside
[3:49:56.080 --> 3:50:02.000]  resources and you know since then all that's been swept under the rug man but uh you know let's let's
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:07.520]  go back to the you know to the roots of the problem and and you know what if any else always says to
[3:50:07.520 --> 3:50:13.360]  follow the money i was wondering you know did eppstein or somebody close to him make a reelection
[3:50:14.000 --> 3:50:20.960]  donation to him for his sweet deal down here what do you think uh i'm not sure i really follow
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:26.240]  that trail i mean uh you know eppstein had money tied up in a lot of different places
[3:50:27.680 --> 3:50:31.280]  and if you just look at the pool the the the political people involved with him
[3:50:32.240 --> 3:50:37.840]  i mean it goes both ways uh mostly towards the democrat aisle here's the money i'm following
[3:50:37.840 --> 3:50:47.760]  right now i mean if eppstein really died in that jail somebody paid off security somebody paid off
[3:50:47.760 --> 3:50:54.400]  technician somebody paid off somebody people got paid off i'd be following that money as far as
[3:50:54.400 --> 3:50:57.920]  eppstein's money is concerned they should already be doing that investigation i mean
[3:50:59.200 --> 3:51:03.200]  yeah i'm sure that can go dozens of different ways so i'm not sure if you need to necessarily
[3:51:03.920 --> 3:51:11.280]  follow one trail or a recent trail i think that the whole just body of work is going to be enough
[3:51:11.280 --> 3:51:18.400]  and again i mean we're talking about blackmail here more than anything really and i think that
[3:51:18.400 --> 3:51:25.600]  that's kind of the factor really that probably can never even go public i mean he they found
[3:51:25.600 --> 3:51:32.720]  a what was it they found a file in eppstein's uh safe that was like underage nudes or something
[3:51:32.720 --> 3:51:37.760]  like that i can't remember what it was but uh man i mean it's just here's the headline yet
[3:51:37.760 --> 3:51:43.440]  rudy juliani is calling it out you know maybe that's why rudy juliani has been acting so
[3:51:43.440 --> 3:51:47.040]  odd lately it's just because he knows everything's about to come out so he's just kind of like man
[3:51:47.040 --> 3:51:53.760]  whatever uh but it's crazy thanks for the call roger let's go to jessica in florida go ahead jessica
[3:51:55.440 --> 3:52:01.600]  hey oh and how's it going good thanks for calling good so i yeah on the eppstein topic i you know
[3:52:01.600 --> 3:52:08.160]  i was saying i think it's pretty odd that the comparison between you know they just went out
[3:52:08.160 --> 3:52:14.080]  there and they raided that island and versus the way that they've treated say roger stone right they
[3:52:14.080 --> 3:52:20.640]  come in and raid him and arrest him and then on top of it we've got cnn pictures of roger stone
[3:52:20.640 --> 3:52:26.240]  and then we've got immediate pictures of this supposed guy dead on a gurney and new york post
[3:52:26.240 --> 3:52:33.200]  in nbc are the first to be reporting this by the way that photo is like uh people that are that are
[3:52:33.200 --> 3:52:38.000]  very familiar with uh prison and all this stuff and everything that it goes on i was i was looking at
[3:52:38.000 --> 3:52:45.040]  this all agree that photo was very strange for them to release that photo for them to even have that
[3:52:45.040 --> 3:52:50.720]  photo but like from the weird angle so there's all kinds of weirdness here again i just have more
[3:52:50.720 --> 3:52:57.440]  questions and answers but based on what we know we're being lied to i mean we're being lied to
[3:52:57.440 --> 3:53:03.120]  the guy did not commit suicide i mean this is it's impossible it's either assisted murder
[3:53:03.840 --> 3:53:10.000]  or a complete lie what witness protection it's an assisted murder or he's not dead i mean the other
[3:53:11.680 --> 3:53:17.600]  yeah and it's there's obviously an inside job happening here it could go either way uh thanks
[3:53:17.600 --> 3:53:24.000]  for the call jesca let's take you know cindy who also had that roger stone point uh cindy in california
[3:53:24.000 --> 3:53:29.920]  go ahead i think it's sydney actually sydney okay sorry go ahead i can talk like a cindy but i'm
[3:53:29.920 --> 3:53:35.040]  cindy anyway well i don't know maybe you identify as a woman either way anyway i'm in california
[3:53:35.040 --> 3:53:40.480]  what do you want so anyways um let me just say i've been tracking on alex stone since the 60s
[3:53:40.480 --> 3:53:44.960]  because i've been researching the kennedy assassinations and all that stuff and he and i have
[3:53:44.960 --> 3:53:50.400]  held hands all the way along and here we are and one of the things that you begin to recognize in
[3:53:50.400 --> 3:53:55.920]  terms of trying to track down what it is referred to as a conspiracy is when the oddities just mount
[3:53:55.920 --> 3:54:01.920]  up it it's a it's not a red flag it's a flare and this is this is probably one of the most
[3:54:01.920 --> 3:54:08.160]  significant things that's happened in terms of trying to unveil this global conspiracy so the
[3:54:08.160 --> 3:54:14.400]  thing that really bothers me that's really bothered me a lot is that it would actually the previous
[3:54:14.400 --> 3:54:20.640]  color kind of reference that here we have petal island which is a storehouse of who knows what
[3:54:21.200 --> 3:54:27.680]  and it took two weeks for the fbi to go there that doesn't make any sense to me as she mentioned i
[3:54:27.680 --> 3:54:34.000]  was roger stone he winked the wrong way and the next thing you know they're you know terry stealing
[3:54:34.000 --> 3:54:38.960]  all of his stuff and taking his stuff and he's can't talk and whatever else but here's one of the
[3:54:38.960 --> 3:54:44.160]  biggest criminals in the history of the world and somehow the fbi does not go out to petal island
[3:54:44.160 --> 3:54:51.520]  and secure that evidence immediately and we are in as is coming out um things have already been
[3:54:51.520 --> 3:54:58.000]  removed and like who did that but why did the question the real question for me is how is it
[3:54:58.000 --> 3:55:04.000]  that there was some sort of a field almost feels like a secret stand down order by the fbi because
[3:55:04.000 --> 3:55:12.000]  that's their their prerogative to go out there and seal that that location uh immediately i have to
[3:55:12.000 --> 3:55:18.320]  make no sense to me and then again just adds to another level of of what you know that is
[3:55:18.320 --> 3:55:23.040]  actually an interesting point we haven't really delved into here let's yeah and let's not forget
[3:55:23.040 --> 3:55:31.200]  jeffrey ebsen was an fbi informant and there's i mean this is really i mean very few people
[3:55:31.200 --> 3:55:37.200]  who can even operate in this pay grade but like i mean think about that if ebsen is an fbi informant
[3:55:37.200 --> 3:55:41.600]  are there still fbi agents there that he was working with are there still fbi agents there that are
[3:55:41.600 --> 3:55:45.840]  trying to cover this up are there still fbi agents on the inside that are trying to keep this under
[3:55:45.840 --> 3:55:54.960]  wraps and i think the logical logical answer would be yeah there is quite a powerful cutillion of
[3:55:56.640 --> 3:56:02.480]  whatever they are okay but why the fbi did some sort of secret stand down where did that come
[3:56:02.480 --> 3:56:08.320]  from why was there not someone in the fbi and everybody is kind of have this has the same
[3:56:08.320 --> 3:56:14.320]  feeling get out there and sees whatever is there that's what you do that's just what you do you know
[3:56:14.320 --> 3:56:20.000]  and the fact that that didn't happen raises huge questions for me as to what this because we're
[3:56:20.000 --> 3:56:26.800]  all operating in this in this small space of time of the last couple days of ebsen's death
[3:56:27.360 --> 3:56:35.200]  this guy had been a known trafficker for decades decades the fbi already has access to most of
[3:56:35.200 --> 3:56:40.320]  these files let's not forget about that they have known about jeffrey ebsen and pedophile island
[3:56:40.320 --> 3:56:44.080]  for decades they could have rated this island years ago people have been calling it for years
[3:56:44.080 --> 3:56:50.560]  for this so so i mean you feel like it's too little too late at this point but again i mean
[3:56:50.560 --> 3:56:55.280]  we've got media trying to cover this up put fbi trying to cover this up people inside the jail
[3:56:55.280 --> 3:57:00.240]  system trying to cover this up i mean are we do you think we're ever gonna get any answers uh
[3:57:00.240 --> 3:57:08.160]  uh yeah we better that's all i can say we better i have a feeling we're not well i
[3:57:08.160 --> 3:57:11.600]  tend to agree with you because and i'll be honest with you sydney thank you for the call
[3:57:13.440 --> 3:57:17.040]  i don't even care if we don't get any answers you don't have to give me any answers
[3:57:17.760 --> 3:57:23.120]  arrest all the damn pedophiles hang them from the highest tree oh oh i'm sorry i'm not allowed to
[3:57:23.120 --> 3:57:28.160]  say that didn't you hear rod rozenstein and rosio donnell feel bad for jeffrey ebsen because he's
[3:57:28.160 --> 3:57:32.400]  a pedophile literally they did that on twitter so so i'm probably bad because i want to see
[3:57:32.400 --> 3:57:38.560]  pedophiles hung from a tree i'm probably bad because i want to see pedophiles receive a you
[3:57:38.560 --> 3:57:45.840]  know a worthy punishment i'm probably bad for that huh without your support we won't be here
[3:57:45.840 --> 3:57:50.000]  and i couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game i mean i want to
[3:57:50.000 --> 3:57:54.400]  stay in this game i want to take the globalist on total transparency is our whole operation if i
[3:57:54.400 --> 3:57:58.800]  bring in 35 million dollars half of that's the cost of the products because we don't mark stuff up
[3:57:58.800 --> 3:58:03.360]  that much i don't care if i'm not making money but you need to buy the products we got coffee we got
[3:58:03.360 --> 3:58:08.240]  fish oil we got turmeric we got great toothpaste we've got great things like dna force plus but
[3:58:08.240 --> 3:58:12.400]  ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months for whatever reason this became the most
[3:58:12.400 --> 3:58:17.440]  popular fish oil it's totally full of the bottle and it is the strongest purest krill oil and it
[3:58:17.440 --> 3:58:23.200]  cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove
[3:58:23.200 --> 3:58:28.000]  mercury any kind of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps which i don't like but gives
[3:58:28.000 --> 3:58:32.160]  you all the great benefits isn't real it's been boiled it's been ruined it's been amodized this
[3:58:32.160 --> 3:58:37.840]  is not good this ladies and gentlemen is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere real
[3:58:37.840 --> 3:58:42.320]  krill oil folks is red it's not yellow it's not milky this is nothing but krill oil
[3:58:44.640 --> 3:58:50.080]  there are thousands of ideologies out there hundreds of different political systems and most of them
[3:58:50.080 --> 3:58:55.920]  are funded by the globalist info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist that's
[3:58:55.920 --> 3:59:00.720]  where the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut it down i didn't invent all this i went
[3:59:00.720 --> 3:59:05.920]  and researched the renaissance americana and what really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to
[3:59:05.920 --> 3:59:11.760]  bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular like it's always been that's where the globalists
[3:59:11.760 --> 3:59:17.280]  are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the light in the dark of the night that
[3:59:17.280 --> 3:59:22.880]  sends chills up my spine so whatever you do continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the
[3:59:22.880 --> 3:59:26.960]  great products at info wars store dot com by spreading the articles by spreading the videos
