[00:00.000 --> 00:29.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to be hearing from Alex
[00:29.880 --> 00:36.040]  Jones here, Owens Royer still in studio, expecting Alex back tomorrow. He's coming
[00:36.040 --> 00:40.440]  up shortly. Wow, we've got a loaded transmission. Let me just tell you Roger Stone, Marjorie
[00:40.440 --> 00:46.560]  Taylor-Green and more coming up. Just quickly though, let me try to get us caught up on
[00:46.560 --> 00:55.120]  where we're at with the speakers race. And I think one thing that I'm extremely impressed
[00:55.120 --> 01:03.240]  by and that is proven to me last night and that's that the anti-McCarthy holdouts, they
[01:03.240 --> 01:09.760]  are on message, they are unwavering and they are effective. I have never seen such effectiveness
[01:09.760 --> 01:13.920]  from what is a small group of Republicans, but whether it's a large group, small group
[01:13.920 --> 01:18.720]  or anything from the Republican Party, not even Donald Trump, not even when he was president,
[01:18.720 --> 01:23.240]  they are all on message every interview they did last night on message. They knew what
[01:23.240 --> 01:28.040]  they wanted to say. They knew what they didn't want to say totally prepared for everything
[01:28.040 --> 01:32.640]  unwavering and effective. It's a beautiful thing to witness. Now, here's the situation
[01:32.640 --> 01:38.960]  with McCarthy. People asked me, well, well, would the Democrats vote for McCarthy? I think
[01:38.960 --> 01:44.040]  that ship has sailed. They maybe could have pulled that move in one of the first six votes.
[01:44.040 --> 01:48.440]  Now there's no way Republicans would switch and vote for somebody else. The only way McCarthy
[01:48.440 --> 01:55.080]  gets in today is if he did concede all of the points that the 20 other Republicans wanted,
[01:55.080 --> 01:59.640]  that is yet to be seen. We'll be covering it live. But first, here is Alex Jones.
[01:59.640 --> 02:05.160]  My fellow patriots, not just here in America, but across the world, we're witnessing historic
[02:05.160 --> 02:14.760]  events in early January 2023. Today is January 5th, 2023, and I have it from high level sources
[02:14.760 --> 02:21.400]  and real experts and insiders like Roger Stone is coming on to join us live in 15 minutes
[02:21.400 --> 02:27.800]  that Mr. McCarthy is out as the Republican Speaker, and we know who the front runner
[02:27.800 --> 02:31.880]  is. A lot of you already have a good idea, but I'm going to lay this out coming up here
[02:31.880 --> 02:37.560]  in a moment and with Roger Stone and Ellen Schreuer. This is a major symbol of a populist
[02:37.560 --> 02:44.440]  uprising and a huge populist rebellion against the globalist. I'm not attacking anybody
[02:44.440 --> 02:49.000]  that supported McCarthy. They have their own reasons. MTG is an incredible person with an
[02:49.000 --> 02:55.000]  amazing voting record that the enemies of freedom absolutely hate. She had agreements
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.640]  with McCarthy that he was going to do these great things in this wonderful pro-America agenda,
[03:00.360 --> 03:04.600]  but a lot of other folks don't trust McCarthy, and they see it as a symbol of bringing down
[03:04.600 --> 03:09.800]  the establishment to remove him. So this has really got the globalist scared. They just stole
[03:09.800 --> 03:14.360]  the last two elections. Now they were trying to install McCarthy. You've got Ipatch McCain
[03:14.360 --> 03:19.880]  calling people that don't support McCarthy terrorists. No, representatives of the American
[03:19.880 --> 03:25.720]  people are allowed to vote for Speaker who they want. Ipatch, McCain, and we all know
[03:25.720 --> 03:32.200]  about the fake Texan that we're talking about. So again, Roger Stone is coming up here in about
[03:32.200 --> 03:36.760]  15 minutes from now to lay all of this out. Tell everybody you know, tune into the broadcast
[03:36.760 --> 03:41.160]  right now because this is historic and it's very important. Also, the globalists are trying to
[03:41.160 --> 03:45.640]  shut down M-Full Wars, and we need your support now more than ever. We are right on the edge of
[03:45.640 --> 03:49.720]  shutting down, ladies and gentlemen, but we make it easy to support the broadcast. I want to thank
[03:49.720 --> 03:54.280]  you all for your support. I encourage you now to go to M-FullWarsTour.com, and I've got two great

[05:41.400 --> 05:45.240]  money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally non-violently
[05:45.240 --> 05:50.680]  politically punching the New World Order in the nose, punching their lies in the nose.
[05:50.680 --> 05:54.680]  We are going to defeat the New World Order. We're going over the top, but right now is the critical
[05:54.680 --> 06:20.040]  juncture. So please go to M-FullWarsTour.com and donate now. If you are receiving this transmission,
[06:20.040 --> 06:27.800]  you are the resistance. Live from the M-FullWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:34.200 --> 06:42.680]  It's Thursday, January 5th, 2023. Next segment, Roger Stone is coming on who's got the sources
[06:42.680 --> 06:51.640]  to lay out the fact that McCarthy is done and this is a major seismic shift that there is a
[06:51.640 --> 06:57.160]  giant populist awakening to the globalist tyranny and the American people will not be stopped by
[06:57.160 --> 07:02.280]  election fraud and by the FBI and Justice Department spying and intimidating and surveilling American
[07:02.280 --> 07:07.160]  people. But here's the most important point we all need to be focused on in my humble opinion
[07:07.160 --> 07:13.080]  and that's what will the agenda of the New Republic and Congress be, not just controlling the border,
[07:13.080 --> 07:17.400]  not just trying to back off this war with Russia, not just trying to stop the fentanyl flooding
[07:17.400 --> 07:21.720]  and the devaluation of the currency and incredible inflation. No, those are all just
[07:21.720 --> 07:28.120]  individual issues. How do you stop all of those? You impeach Joe Biden and the impeachment hearings
[07:28.120 --> 07:33.880]  of the House will be a major platform to show his real crimes to America and the world and will
[07:33.880 --> 07:40.440]  result in his removal. It's time to go on the offense and McCarthy and others have only tenuously
[07:40.440 --> 07:46.120]  said they might have investigations into Twittergate and into the Hunter Biden files and into
[07:46.840 --> 07:50.520]  all the surveillance and censorship of big tech working with the government illegally.
[07:50.520 --> 07:55.240]  They're saying they might look at impeachment. No, we don't look at impeachment. We go for
[07:55.240 --> 07:59.640]  impeachment. That's why I love MTG. She's been calling for impeachment in the new Congress
[07:59.640 --> 08:04.920]  and I understand why she supported McCarthy. He promised to follow all these great ideas and
[08:04.920 --> 08:09.080]  things that she and others had, but I don't think at the end of the day McCarthy can be trusted.
[08:09.080 --> 08:15.400]  Regardless of that, this shows the power of the American people, our representatives,
[08:15.400 --> 08:19.800]  when we don't back down. We need to end the imperial leadership of the Republican Democratic
[08:19.800 --> 08:26.920]  Party. We need to bring populism back to America and Roger Stone and Owen Shroyer are about to lay
[08:26.920 --> 08:32.360]  all of this exclusive information out and who is really at the front of the ticket to be the
[08:32.360 --> 08:38.200]  new Speaker of the House. This is such an important moment, not just for America, but for the world,
[08:38.200 --> 08:44.920]  but we've got to, again, inject into this debate around McCarthy right now the fact that we need
[08:44.920 --> 08:50.280]  pledges from people that are going to vote for this speaker and from who the new speaker is going to
[08:50.280 --> 08:55.480]  be a black Republican from Florida that we'll be talking about in a moment. He's the frontrunner.
[08:55.480 --> 09:02.120]  That they will go for the impeachment. It's not just their right or our right. It is our duty when
[09:02.120 --> 09:07.080]  someone commits these high crimes and misdemeanors and other things right in front of us to remove
[09:07.080 --> 09:14.600]  them. We have him dead to rights. We have Joe Biden, ladies and gentlemen, and the new ruler
[09:14.600 --> 09:19.480]  and their whole system in our sights. So I'm going to hand the baton to Owen. Roger's coming up in
[09:19.480 --> 09:24.200]  the next segment, but finally I have to add this point. I had to take some time off of my family to
[09:24.200 --> 09:30.120]  refocus and really get closer to God. I'll be back on Saturday doing shows back on Sunday.
[09:30.120 --> 09:33.720]  Owen, the crews have been doing a great job, but I just need to remind the listeners that I'm in
[09:33.720 --> 09:38.600]  personal bankruptcy, so it's free speech systems. We're in Chapter 11, Sub Chapter 5, a reorganization.
[09:38.600 --> 09:43.320]  As long as we have enough money to fund our operations, stay on air, they can't shut us
[09:43.320 --> 09:47.400]  down. The appeal process will take three years, but if you don't support us, we'll be taken off the
[09:47.400 --> 09:52.040]  year. And it's an incredible development that when I leave town, we have the same amount of
[09:52.040 --> 09:55.960]  listeners. Owen's a great host. The other hosts are great as well, but the funds stop coming in.
[09:55.960 --> 10:01.240]  It's just a fact, but I can't kill myself and be here 365 days a week. I normally work seven
[10:01.240 --> 10:06.360]  days a week, 15 hours a day, but I had to spend time with family. Okay, I had to reset and it's
[10:06.360 --> 10:10.760]  been great. I've been hiking, exercising, praying, focusing, researching, spending time with my five
[10:10.760 --> 10:15.720]  year old daughter, but I need your support. I don't want to prove to you how serious things are
[10:15.720 --> 10:22.920]  at InfoWars by us downsizing or cutting the other shows or shutting down InfoWars. So
[10:24.280 --> 10:29.240]  we are that close, but the good news is our underage is only about $230,000 a month for the
[10:29.240 --> 10:32.520]  last six months. Sounds like a lot of money, but for an organization as important as us,
[10:32.520 --> 10:37.400]  as big as we are, that is very easy to do. If you just decide, despite this recession we're in,
[10:37.400 --> 10:43.320]  to go to infowarstore.com right now and get down and out sleep paid, sold out for over five months,
[10:43.320 --> 10:48.360]  strong asleep and we've got, it's incredible. It's back in stock. The sale of five of the
[10:48.360 --> 10:52.280]  mineral fusion DNA force plus, it's going to end on Monday because it's selling out.
[10:52.280 --> 10:58.040]  Those are 50% off. Take action now. Get great products you need. Get a copy of the great reset
[10:58.040 --> 11:03.880]  and the war for the world. Get a signed copy. That's a fundraiser. Take action now. I commend you.
[11:03.880 --> 11:08.600]  InfoWars is in your hands. America is in your hands. The world is in your hands. Please keep
[11:08.600 --> 11:13.800]  InfoWars on the air. Go to infowarstore.com to keep the speaking of truth on air. All right,
[11:13.800 --> 11:17.640]  Owen Schroder is about to take over and then Roger Stone next segment with the inside baseball.
[11:17.640 --> 11:21.960]  What's really happening with the battle over the speakership and the inside info is McCarthy's
[11:21.960 --> 11:26.360]  already lost. Stay with us. So there you go, ladies and gentlemen. Again, Roger Stone coming
[11:26.360 --> 11:33.480]  up Marjorie Taylor Greene as well. It's been a very news driven week. My transmissions this
[11:33.480 --> 11:37.800]  week have been very news driven and so we're going to have some guests and I want to take calls
[11:37.800 --> 11:44.520]  today. But let me focus on the issue here before Roger Stone joins us and where I think we're out,
[11:44.520 --> 11:49.720]  where I think we're at with the House Speaker vote coming up shortly. We'll of course be monitoring
[11:49.720 --> 11:56.600]  that. Here are the main issues to expand on what Alex was saying. I was just taking some notes here.
[11:56.600 --> 12:04.360]  Here are the five issues that need to be addressed loudly and aggressively with the Republican
[12:04.360 --> 12:10.360]  leadership in the House. Some are obvious. Some maybe not so obvious to our politicians,
[12:10.360 --> 12:16.680]  but we should make it obvious to them. And I think the issue is for me, I have no faith that
[12:16.680 --> 12:22.440]  Kevin McCarthy would have any real motive agenda or desire to take care of any of these issues,
[12:22.440 --> 12:30.440]  quite frankly. So I just had no confidence there. That's how most Republican voters, most Trump
[12:30.440 --> 12:37.000]  supporters, most conservatives felt. And so it was nice to see what we, the people feel,
[12:37.000 --> 12:43.000]  what we, the people think, finally represented, even if it was a minority of 20 Republicans in
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.040]  the House. It felt good, didn't it? It felt right, finally, that we weren't being dictated from the
[12:48.040 --> 12:54.440]  top down from Fox News and Conink and Carl Rove and Dan Crenshaw and Sean Hannity. No, you guys
[12:54.440 --> 13:02.360]  need to join our team, Team America, Team We, the people. So here are the five issues. Close the
[13:02.360 --> 13:08.920]  border. Stop the war with Russia, which folks, I'm going to get into a little bit of this today.
[13:10.280 --> 13:13.880]  And I could even get some more expansive knowledge if I really want to delve into this.
[13:14.520 --> 13:22.680]  But I think Russia is getting prepared for a major, massive move. I don't want to say frontal
[13:22.680 --> 13:29.080]  assault, but I think there's a major move coming. And as soon as the freezing temperatures in that
[13:29.080 --> 13:35.480]  region set in and the ground hardens, whatever Russia strategy is, that's when they go in.
[13:35.480 --> 13:40.200]  And it helps them because their troops are rested, their troops are ready, their troops are well
[13:40.200 --> 13:45.240]  fed, they're used to the cold, they've trained for it. The Ukrainian troops are struggling, folks.
[13:45.240 --> 13:50.440]  The Ukrainian troops are out of food, they're cold, they're desperate. And once that freeze
[13:50.440 --> 13:55.160]  sits in, that's when Russia is going to make its major move and it looks like they're building up.
[13:58.200 --> 14:01.400]  Quite frankly, geopolitically, it makes more sense for us to side with Russia.
[14:01.400 --> 14:05.880]  Now, we don't have to side with anybody. We can stay neutral and independent on this deal.
[14:06.440 --> 14:12.200]  Russia is going to win this thing. Now, the real issue should be we don't want the U.S. getting
[14:12.200 --> 14:20.840]  involved and we don't want there to be bloodshed. So we'll talk about that. But stopping the war
[14:20.840 --> 14:26.760]  with Russia should be a major issue. Impeaching Biden, investigating Biden, that just has to happen.
[14:27.880 --> 14:33.400]  And this one is a little tough, you know. You don't want to see, I don't want to see,
[14:33.400 --> 14:38.280]  this issue where every president now gets impeached and gets investigated because that's
[14:38.280 --> 14:42.520]  just the new par for the course, thanks to what the Democrats did to Trump an innocent man. But
[14:42.520 --> 14:48.440]  we are here today. Biden deserves to be investigated and impeached. Absolutely. So that's going to
[14:48.440 --> 14:54.760]  be key. And then, of course, you need probes. You need investigations launched into Twitter gate,
[14:54.760 --> 15:01.800]  Fauci gate, vaccine gate. That has to happen. That's a big one. That might be one of the lesser
[15:01.800 --> 15:07.080]  odds of these issues being addressed. But that should be one of them. And then the fifth and
[15:07.080 --> 15:12.280]  final one, which of course just has to happen, if anything is going to matter, something must
[15:12.280 --> 15:16.920]  be done about our elections. Something must be done to return confidence to our elections.
[15:16.920 --> 15:22.120]  Something must be done to restore faith in our elections. Something must be done so that the
[15:22.120 --> 15:27.160]  American people have any confidence or faith that when they go vote, the correct result
[15:27.720 --> 15:32.200]  is being represented. I'm not so sure that is how America feels right now. When we come back,
[15:32.200 --> 15:37.640]  it's Roger Stone, but I'll tell you this. Unless Kevin McCarthy conceded all of these different
[15:37.640 --> 15:41.880]  issues, including that he could be overthrown with just one individual, which he hated the most,
[15:41.880 --> 15:47.320]  that scared him. I don't think McCarthy gets in today, but there's rumors out there that he did
[15:47.320 --> 15:53.320]  concede. So we shall see. Now, would the Democrats vote for McCarthy? I think that ship has sailed.
[15:53.320 --> 15:56.440]  And if that happened now, Republicans would switch their votes. So McCarthy still wouldn't
[15:56.440 --> 16:02.440]  get the majority. Roger Stone coming up. You want to beat the New World Order? You want to stop their
[16:02.440 --> 16:08.040]  globalist agenda? Well, so do I. And I've been the most affected individual in the fight against
[16:08.040 --> 16:12.360]  the globalist and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down. But ladies and gentlemen,
[16:13.160 --> 16:19.640]  I can't do it without your support. And the good news is we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[16:20.200 --> 16:24.280]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to
[16:24.280 --> 16:28.680]  back down and I'll never give up, but I could give out. So please keep me on the field.
[16:28.680 --> 16:32.040]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time
[16:32.040 --> 16:36.760]  that will empower you and your family. InfoWarsStore.com for the best supplements and more,

[19:05.880 --> 19:12.440]  got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors. They associated
[19:12.440 --> 19:19.080]  these poisonous vapors with cold weather. Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill
[19:19.080 --> 19:27.240]  that killed people. What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3. You see the sun via your skin
[19:27.240 --> 19:33.080]  helps your body produce vitamin D3. But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce
[19:33.080 --> 19:37.880]  vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking
[19:37.880 --> 19:42.680]  your body over. So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality
[19:42.680 --> 19:47.880]  vitamin D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into

[20:03.240 --> 20:25.400]  the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones. All right, we're getting ready for speaker of the
[20:25.400 --> 20:33.880]  House vote number seven. Lucky number seven perhaps. And Roger Stone joins us now to give us some of
[20:33.880 --> 20:40.200]  the inside baseball. Roger, where do you want to begin? Do you want to begin with the last six
[20:40.200 --> 20:46.440]  votes and what led to Kevin McCartney's double platinum sombrero or do you want to start with
[20:46.440 --> 20:51.080]  what you're expecting to see today based off what you heard from last night? Roger Stone.
[20:51.080 --> 20:58.840]  Well, first of all, I went Happy New Year. Great to be back with you. Great looking sports jacket.
[20:58.840 --> 21:05.080]  You got going there. Apparently not good enough, huh? Well, come on. You can't be on every year.
[21:05.080 --> 21:10.040]  You can't be on every. It's all right, Roger. You know, I still love you. There's always next year,
[21:10.040 --> 21:18.200]  my friend. I'll work hard for it. You always do. You always look good. So first of all, we're
[21:18.200 --> 21:24.120]  witnessing history. I mean, this really is extraordinary. I'm kind of amused by the pearl
[21:24.120 --> 21:31.080]  clutching of the ruling class saying, oh, what an embarrassment for the Republicans. No,
[21:31.080 --> 21:36.920]  this is what democracy in a Democratic Republic actually looks like. What would be pathetic
[21:36.920 --> 21:45.240]  are secret behind the seams, backroom deals cut with special interest money so that the people
[21:45.240 --> 21:50.760]  never actually see what's going on in their government. So I think it's a very healthy
[21:50.760 --> 21:59.800]  exercise, first of all. Secondarily, it also has demonstrated that Kevin McCarthy now going for
[21:59.800 --> 22:06.920]  the sixth ballot simply doesn't have the votes. I mean, stick a fork in him. He's done. I think
[22:06.920 --> 22:14.440]  that's abundantly clear. So the only question now is, who is it that they rally behind?
[22:14.440 --> 22:20.200]  So let me just ask you this quickly. So does McCarthy have any votes? Is McCarthy going to
[22:20.200 --> 22:27.000]  be nominated again today? Well, it appears to me that he is now seeking to make a secret
[22:27.000 --> 22:33.160]  backroom deal with Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats. Two weeks ago,
[22:33.160 --> 22:38.280]  of course, he said he would never do this. So he's caught in another lie. Remember,
[22:38.280 --> 22:44.920]  the Democrats could help him get elected simply by having enough of them vote present, which is
[22:44.920 --> 22:53.480]  essentially abstaining to lower the total number of votes that McCarthy would require to win.
[22:54.440 --> 23:00.200]  And he's perfectly capable of doing this because, as Matt Gates said yesterday,
[23:00.200 --> 23:09.960]  he has no ideology. He's not a conservative. He's about money and power. And had he responded
[23:10.520 --> 23:19.960]  more specifically to the five points raised by the Freedom Caucus in a formal letter to him last
[23:19.960 --> 23:27.080]  Sunday, I think he might be speaker right now. But let me give you the most important example.
[23:27.080 --> 23:35.640]  Since 1837, one member could always make a privileged motion to vacate the chair, in other
[23:35.640 --> 23:41.480]  words, to challenge the speakership of whoever the speaker was. So if the speaker did something
[23:41.480 --> 23:49.880]  egregious, for example, supporting a $45 million check for Ukraine, for example, then any member,
[23:49.880 --> 23:55.640]  one member could move to vacate the chair, and there'd be a vote of the full house,
[23:55.640 --> 24:00.120]  so that a speaker could be toppled. And McCarthy really did not like that. That was one of his big
[24:00.120 --> 24:08.680]  bugaboos. Well, Nancy Pelosi changed the rule to be that such a motion was no longer privileged.
[24:08.680 --> 24:16.600]  It had to be endorsed by one of the party caucuses, which means a majority in the case of Nancy
[24:16.600 --> 24:23.640]  Pelosi. That was clearly never going to happen. The Freedom Caucus demanded a return to the
[24:23.640 --> 24:30.760]  pre-Pelosi rule of one member, and Kevin McCarthy counterproposed that it had to be five. Had he
[24:30.760 --> 24:39.240]  agreed to one, I think he might be speaker today. Secondarily, we saw McCarthy go into various
[24:39.240 --> 24:49.800]  primaries and caucuses and use party money, leadership money, National Republican Congressional
[24:49.800 --> 24:58.040]  Committee money to mow down America's first patriot candidates like Laura Loomer, like Joe
[24:58.040 --> 25:04.120]  Ken and others. And they wanted to pledge from him that he would not do that in the future.
[25:04.120 --> 25:11.800]  He didn't even address that in his response to the insurgents. So Kevin McCarthy has made his own
[25:11.800 --> 25:19.800]  bed. And I think when they convene shortly, I guess it's any minute now, he's still not going to
[25:19.800 --> 25:26.440]  have the votes. My guess is that he will continue to slowly lose votes until the dam is actually
[25:26.440 --> 25:31.880]  broken. And to go back on that issue of the Democrats trying to help McCarthy in this,
[25:31.880 --> 25:36.440]  I think that ship has sailed. I think maybe there could have been a window of opportunity there in
[25:36.440 --> 25:43.480]  the first six votes where McCarthy's, you know, 200 supporters, give or take a couple would have
[25:43.480 --> 25:49.000]  continued to vote for him despite the Democrats changing the threshold. I think that ship sailed.
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.520]  I think the Democrats tried to do that now. Republican votes will match and either not vote
[25:54.520 --> 26:00.280]  McCarthy or abstain themselves. Would you agree with that? I think it remains to be seen. One
[26:00.280 --> 26:04.600]  of the things we have to recognize is that McCarthy's votes are bought and paid for. In other
[26:04.600 --> 26:10.360]  words, he bought those votes with campaign contributions in the last cycle. Maybe some of
[26:10.360 --> 26:16.840]  that FTX money. I think that's actually a key issue here. Well, if I were Matt Gaetz, who I
[26:16.840 --> 26:23.000]  think, by the way, has done a brilliant and gutsy job with this whole thing. One of the questions
[26:23.000 --> 26:30.040]  I would pose on the floor to him is explaining to us why you took this FTX money and how you used
[26:30.040 --> 26:41.480]  it. I think it should be absolutely key. But the other thing we see here is that in our democracy,
[26:42.440 --> 26:50.520]  the movement that you and I belong to, the America First Movement, it is not owned by Donald Trump.
[26:50.520 --> 26:57.480]  Donald Trump came out with a full-throated endorsement of minority leader McCarthy after he
[26:57.480 --> 27:05.160]  had already lost one day of balloting. And it had no effect whatsoever. Now, there was
[27:05.160 --> 27:09.880]  one other absolutely key development here, oh, and that should be noted. And that is,
[27:11.000 --> 27:17.480]  initially, for lack of a candidate, Matt Gaetz put the name of Jim Jordan up and put it into
[27:17.480 --> 27:24.840]  nomination. And although Jordan rose and spoke and urged his colleagues to vote for McCarthy,
[27:24.840 --> 27:31.400]  it is very notable that he did not withdraw his name from contention. So he really didn't undercut
[27:32.120 --> 27:39.960]  the insurgents as he could have. And then the switch from Jim Jordan, who simply does not want
[27:39.960 --> 27:45.560]  to be Speaker. I mean, he's really interested in adding the investigations into Joe and Hunter and
[27:45.560 --> 27:53.880]  the FBI and so on. The move to Byron Donald's of Florida is nothing short of brilliant.
[27:53.880 --> 28:00.360]  Donald's is a hardcore America First conservative. He's not an establishment Republican. He was not
[28:00.360 --> 28:07.160]  the candidate of the establishment when he won that seat. Secondarily, he's an African American,
[28:07.160 --> 28:13.240]  which would give the party a great opportunity to return to our roots as the party of Lincoln.
[28:14.120 --> 28:20.680]  Byron Donald's, particularly since the Democrats have chosen Hakeem Jeffries as their minority
[28:20.680 --> 28:27.800]  leader, would be a spectacular speaker. This was a stroke of genius. And clearly Byron Donald's
[28:27.800 --> 28:34.520]  himself is on board because he voted for himself in the last round. That's Roger Stone. We got a
[28:34.520 --> 28:39.000]  short break here. We'll be right back with more. And you know, I want to talk about one narrative
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.720]  I'm hearing out there. They say, well, you know, don't worry about McCarthy. This isn't a policy
[28:43.720 --> 28:49.160]  position. Well, if it wasn't a policy position, then why are you so desperate to get Kevin McCarthy
[28:49.160 --> 28:54.520]  in there? It might not be a policy position by definition, but please, for all practical purposes,
[28:54.520 --> 28:58.280]  policies somehow some way will eventually come through the speaker.
[29:00.040 --> 29:05.320]  There is a war on for your mind. Your mind is a battlefield. This is an information war.
[29:06.040 --> 29:12.760]  Info wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago. And today, whether it's Donald Trump
[29:12.760 --> 29:19.960]  or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that info wars has popularized
[29:19.960 --> 29:24.760]  because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them. But we can't do it without
[29:24.760 --> 29:29.480]  funding. And we make it easy to fund with great products and power you and your immune system

[33:22.680 --> 33:30.600]  Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer well if there was any doubt if the Freedom Caucus and McCarthy
[33:30.600 --> 33:35.160]  holdouts were going to be committing to Byron Donalds I think that doubt has now been removed
[33:35.720 --> 33:42.920]  Dan Bishop just finished an incredible speech in front of the house assembly just a moment ago
[33:42.920 --> 33:47.080]  truly incredible they're about to begin the votes and now they just have the votes are coming in
[33:47.080 --> 33:53.960]  right now we'll be monitoring this Roger you said something in the last segment that really stuck
[33:53.960 --> 34:00.280]  out to me because it's exactly how I felt and I'd like you to expand on this you put it the
[34:00.280 --> 34:06.840]  pearl clutching from the establishment is very apparent I'm paraphrasing but basically there
[34:06.840 --> 34:13.240]  was a there was a sense that it was Kevin McCarthy that was the establishment's pick it was the
[34:13.240 --> 34:19.000]  establishment Republicans Uniparty saying hey we pick McCarthy that's how it goes we run the show
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.840]  here you the people that vote for us you mean nothing in this process get out of our way well
[34:24.840 --> 34:29.880]  that is not how these Freedom Caucus members felt and they were able to hold out and get it done so
[34:29.880 --> 34:34.920]  then what we saw we saw all the mainstream conservative news freaking out Dan Crenshaw
[34:34.920 --> 34:40.200]  insulting people even the New York Post insulting the Republicans with the Ukraine flag on their
[34:40.200 --> 34:45.160]  headline there too because they love Ukraine so much so kind of expand on that a little bit what's
[34:45.160 --> 34:50.440]  this pearl clutching phenomenon to you that you're witnessing in the rejection of Kevin McCarthy
[34:51.640 --> 34:56.680]  yeah it's very interesting it's like they all work off of the same talking points so if you
[34:56.680 --> 35:03.720]  go on Twitter which I am now able to do by the way you can follow me at rogerjstonejr
[35:03.720 --> 35:12.840]  if you're one of those conservatives who isn't still banned on on Twitter if you see the talking
[35:12.840 --> 35:19.400]  points from all the House members it is attacks on Matt Gates and his colleagues their ego maniacs
[35:19.400 --> 35:24.840]  this is all about their ego this is egotism this is this is it has nothing to do with their egos
[35:24.840 --> 35:32.600]  it has to do with fundamental principles secondarily is this notion talk about arrogance
[35:32.600 --> 35:39.880]  and McCarthy moved into the speaker's office without ever having been elected speaker so there
[35:39.880 --> 35:47.160]  was a presumption there an arrogance that is outrageous and as I said earlier no this isn't
[35:47.160 --> 35:53.000]  embarrassing to the Republican party what this shows is that we have a party committed to a
[35:53.000 --> 36:01.480]  free open democratic process we don't make our deals behind closed doors like the Democrats do
[36:01.480 --> 36:11.240]  uh and it's absolutely clear to me uh that uh with the the anti-McCarthy vote now coalescing
[36:11.800 --> 36:19.560]  behind Byron Donald's um that Donald's has a real prospect to become speaker uh momentum is very
[36:19.560 --> 36:26.520]  important in these matters when they choose to adjourn becomes very important uh they adjourned
[36:26.520 --> 36:33.320]  yesterday so you know behind the scenes furiously there were talks going on last night but based on
[36:33.320 --> 36:40.360]  my best information they have afforded nothing because uh kind of like Stonewall Jackson there
[36:40.360 --> 36:46.360]  stands Matt Gates like a stone wall he's not going to switch he and his colleagues are not
[36:46.360 --> 36:53.880]  going to quit they're not going to fade so there's now at this point only one way that Kevin McCarthy
[36:53.880 --> 37:00.600]  and the FTX crowd around him uh can grab the speaker's office uh and that is with the complicity
[37:00.600 --> 37:08.120]  of Nancy Pelosi Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats whether that can still be done I don't know I'm
[37:08.120 --> 37:16.040]  not in a regular touch with those people uh but anything is possible uh if McCarthy steals his
[37:16.040 --> 37:22.600]  speakership that way well then you can kiss any investigation into the illegal activities of
[37:22.600 --> 37:30.680]  Joe and Hunter Biden goodbye you can kiss kiss any investigation into uh Dr Fauci and the lies
[37:30.680 --> 37:37.640]  we've been told about the safety and the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination goodbye
[37:37.640 --> 37:46.040]  you can kiss any investigation into the abuses by the FBI goodbye uh and you will have the status
[37:46.040 --> 37:52.680]  quo you'll have exactly what you have now with one exception we'll probably send another 25 30 maybe
[37:52.680 --> 38:02.120]  even 45 billion to Ukraine oh and there's 370,000 homeless veterans in this country yep shipping
[38:02.120 --> 38:09.160]  more money to Ukraine is just unconscionable yep but we all saw Kevin McCarthy sporting the
[38:09.160 --> 38:16.440]  Ukrainian flag pocket square oh sure you knocked off my best and worst dress list as well as
[38:16.440 --> 38:23.960]  Ukrainian flag lapel pin so I would say Kevin McCarthy is Ukraine first wouldn't you well he's
[38:23.960 --> 38:31.240]  certainly as you said likes the Ukrainian colors there in his uh lapel pin and his pocket square
[38:32.040 --> 38:38.440]  a bad look for for me as an American I don't want to go to war with Russia I don't think there's
[38:38.440 --> 38:44.520]  any victory for America there the only victory would be stopping war but early returns quickly
[38:44.520 --> 38:49.880]  early returns are in and it's obviously too early to say right now with McCarthy 28 votes
[38:49.880 --> 38:55.480]  jeffrey's 23 and others four but early returns to me say McCarthy's not going to get it again
[38:55.480 --> 38:59.800]  I mean all you need is 20 other votes and as long as no democrats abstain from their vote
[38:59.800 --> 39:03.720]  that's not going to change the threshold so I don't see this changing again I mean
[39:03.720 --> 39:10.280]  I mean Roger this is embarrassing quite frankly not for Matt Gates but for Kevin McCarthy he's
[39:10.280 --> 39:16.920]  about to go 0 for seven I mean how do you even like what do you you've had this is your third day
[39:16.920 --> 39:23.320]  now if you're Kevin McCarthy nothing has changed you didn't concede what you needed to to get in
[39:23.320 --> 39:27.720]  I'm not even sure it would have mattered this late in the game the 20 holdouts they're not
[39:27.720 --> 39:32.760]  changing their mind they've committed now to Donald's looks like he's ready for the role so
[39:32.760 --> 39:37.880]  what is this is it just the they're just trying to force their will upon us is that what this is
[39:37.880 --> 39:43.960]  it's a war of futility like they're just going to force their will on us and and just keep voting
[39:43.960 --> 39:51.320]  until we give in I don't see that working now we have we have very definitely have a Mexican
[39:51.880 --> 39:57.080]  standoff here when I spoke to Alex Jones this morning and he asked me to join you
[39:57.080 --> 40:03.880]  he made a very very key point which is the fact that President Trump endorsed McCarthy and that
[40:03.880 --> 40:11.000]  it didn't move any votes in fact it actually the rebels actually gained it very slightly
[40:11.000 --> 40:17.560]  shows that the movement is bigger than any one person now I must tell you I cannot explain
[40:17.560 --> 40:22.600]  the president's support for McCarthy I've talked to him about it I'm not going to get in the
[40:22.600 --> 40:28.840]  specifics of that conversation but to me I don't understand why he objects to Mitch McConnell
[40:28.840 --> 40:34.840]  but likes Kevin McCarthy their legislative records are absolutely identical the only difference is
[40:34.840 --> 40:41.720]  that McCarthy's comments after January 6th were even more damaging to the president than Mitch
[40:41.720 --> 40:47.080]  McConnell's comments which by the way gave behind a face mask because he loved his face mask so much
[40:47.080 --> 40:57.160]  yeah exactly so it is it shows that there that the movement is mature no Matt Gaetz and the
[40:57.160 --> 41:04.200]  insurgents are not doing this for personal glory they're not doing it because their ego maniacs
[41:04.200 --> 41:11.240]  is some want to say but then there are a lot of questions about others so what's interesting to
[41:11.240 --> 41:18.760]  me is for example congresswoman cat comic from from near Jacksonville Florida voting for Kevin
[41:18.760 --> 41:26.200]  McCarthy disgraceful I have to give my hats off I'm I'm not a fan of Anna Polina Luna the new
[41:26.200 --> 41:32.600]  congresswoman from Tampa I've made that pretty clear but to her credit she has stood up on this
[41:32.600 --> 41:40.280]  and voted with the insurgents so kudos to her I mean one vote does not a career make but I'm
[41:40.280 --> 41:46.120]  pleasantly surprised and I give her credit where credit is due but then there are others like
[41:46.120 --> 41:51.960]  congressman Corey Mills who I like very much who I think is a real future leader for the
[41:51.960 --> 41:59.640]  conservative movement probably a future US senator or a future governor of Florida but sadly he's
[41:59.640 --> 42:08.840]  voting again with Kevin McCarthy Thomas Massey there's a guy I really like a truly a free thinker
[42:08.840 --> 42:16.360]  probably the leading libertarian in the house but again voting for Kevin McCarthy so there are some
[42:16.360 --> 42:23.960]  very real disappointments here Owen well and let's see who are the first ones to fall off that
[42:23.960 --> 42:30.280]  McCarthy bandwagon and if they jump on the donald's bandwagon which it seems the freedom caucus is
[42:30.280 --> 42:35.240]  committed to based off what we've heard today so when we come back with roger stone we're going
[42:35.240 --> 42:41.080]  to talk about who could be the future speaker of the house we'll give you the updated votes when
[42:41.080 --> 42:48.920]  we come back from this short break as well and I want to figure out from roger stone where did
[42:48.920 --> 42:54.600]  Matt Gaetz get this political brilliance from is someone advising him is he doing it all on his own
[42:54.600 --> 42:58.760]  I think it's genius we'll get roger stone's take on that and the future speaker when we come back
[42:58.760 --> 43:06.360]  there is a war on for your mind your mind is a battlefield this is an information war info wars
[43:06.360 --> 43:12.840]  popularized those terms more than two decades ago and today whether it's donald trump or
[43:12.840 --> 43:19.480]  governor sanis or dr robert malone they're all using the terms that info wars has popularized

[47:05.240 --> 47:17.320]  world order it's alex jones all right ladies and gentlemen it's still early but from where it stands
[47:17.320 --> 47:24.600]  right now it appears nothing has changed and the results look like they're going to be the exact same
[47:25.400 --> 47:34.120]  or eerily similar to the first six votes and so truly just a battle of futility a war of attrition
[47:34.120 --> 47:40.520]  perhaps as mccarthy just keeps throwing his hat in the ring and keeps losing i don't know i don't
[47:40.520 --> 47:46.200]  know what you call 0 for 7 with seven strikeouts the uranium sombrero a triple platinum sombrero i
[47:46.200 --> 47:51.080]  mean this is really i mean if you're kev mccarthy i don't know how you're just not completely embarrassed
[47:51.640 --> 47:56.600]  right now quite frankly i mean after the first two days but then you do it for a third day
[47:56.600 --> 48:01.160]  you never had the votes clearly you never had the votes and and now we're going to know it for a
[48:01.160 --> 48:08.360]  seventh time it appears okay so maybe we'll get another 20 votes for donald's this go around i
[48:08.360 --> 48:15.000]  suppose that he's the secondary leader in the clubhouse for the republican nomination roger let
[48:15.000 --> 48:20.360]  me let me point two things out here and and get your take on this with your political expertise
[48:21.000 --> 48:28.200]  you know florida now to me represents where republican policy needs to come from it is now
[48:28.200 --> 48:33.880]  clearly the red estate in the union it's leading the way with policy and economics even more than
[48:33.880 --> 48:39.480]  texas ronda santis is the gold standard i think for a lot of people you you disagree i know that
[48:39.480 --> 48:45.000]  but i think a lot of people look at that byron donald's from florida matt gates from florida is
[48:45.000 --> 48:51.320]  this kind of a florida emerging as the new leader of the gop with its representatives
[48:51.320 --> 48:56.440]  and do you see byron donald's becoming the favorite after mccarthy loses for a seventh straight time
[48:57.880 --> 49:01.480]  first of all i'm not sure where you're getting that feed from but it's just interesting that
[49:01.480 --> 49:06.840]  they listed as others although based on my information everybody who hasn't voted for
[49:06.840 --> 49:13.880]  either mccarthy uh or jeffries has voted for donald's this is a willful attempt by someone in the
[49:13.880 --> 49:22.040]  media not to give him uh you know any uh momentum i do think that he will very shortly be the front
[49:22.040 --> 49:28.840]  runner for speaker uh there is always the possibility of course that somebody could put the name of
[49:28.840 --> 49:37.400]  donald j trump into a nomination uh on a future ballot uh lauren bobert who i think held her own
[49:37.400 --> 49:43.720]  with my friend shawn hannity last night in a very fiery exchange between the two of them
[49:43.720 --> 49:49.000]  said that she's thinking about nominating the president perhaps that could be the act
[49:49.560 --> 49:56.200]  which opens the logjam i do have to address some of you said uh governor de santis had
[49:56.200 --> 50:02.680]  his inauguration uh this week it was uh he gave an excellent speech but in the front row somebody
[50:02.680 --> 50:10.280]  who wasn't at his previous inauguration former governor jeb bush uh we learned recently that
[50:10.280 --> 50:17.160]  the broward county school system has adopted a curriculum that includes crt for our public
[50:17.160 --> 50:22.840]  school children in violation of the governor's executive order uh broward general hospital is
[50:22.840 --> 50:29.960]  now insisting on masks once again for their unvaccinated uh uh employees including uh uh
[50:29.960 --> 50:37.880]  emergency room nurses uh in violation of the governor's uh order uh and yes i love the idea
[50:37.880 --> 50:44.040]  that governor de santis has gone to the state supreme court to ask them to convene a grand jury
[50:44.040 --> 50:49.000]  to investigate whether floridians were misled over the safety and the effectiveness of the
[50:49.000 --> 50:54.840]  coveted 19 vaccinations but governor de santis signed a law giving the manufacturers and those
[50:54.840 --> 51:01.400]  who promoted it complete legal immunity so that's what is known as a ed fake uh in public nobody
[51:01.400 --> 51:08.120]  will be held accountable it's a political move so i have my reservations uh and i looked everybody
[51:08.120 --> 51:14.840]  knows that i'm supporting donald trump in 2024 i hope that ron de santis will stay in florida
[51:14.840 --> 51:22.680]  i hope he will keep his commitment on masks uh on uh on crt and and gender and sex lies being
[51:23.320 --> 51:29.960]  forced on our school children over the christmas season we had these drag queen shows being open
[51:29.960 --> 51:35.720]  to children again yeah again the governor pledged that would not happen uh and he's written some
[51:35.720 --> 51:41.800]  strong letters uh to those who sponsored those shows but strong letters are not a substitute
[51:41.800 --> 51:47.560]  for action i'd like him to stay here and do the job prove his conservative bona fides
[51:47.560 --> 51:52.680]  rather than just his ability to grab a headline uh and then perhaps down the road he could be a
[51:52.680 --> 51:57.480]  republican candidate for president so getting back to the house speaker vote again folks it's
[51:57.480 --> 52:02.120]  it's not finished yet but it looks like it's going to be the exact same result here and
[52:02.120 --> 52:06.840]  mccarthy is going to fail for a seventh straight time 0 for 7 he never had the votes once he lied
[52:06.840 --> 52:12.520]  when he said he did but the brilliance of matt gates you know roger this was something that uh
[52:12.520 --> 52:20.280]  really became present and clear to me right after new years and then when he really dug in and
[52:20.280 --> 52:25.320]  committed to his anti mccarthy stance in spite all the threats and the hemming and the hauling
[52:25.320 --> 52:31.720]  and the insults he stand he stood firm a lot of people wouldn't have had not just the commitment
[52:31.720 --> 52:37.080]  to do that but quite frankly the political brilliance he clearly had the foresight to know
[52:37.080 --> 52:42.840]  that he was going to be victorious in this standoff unlike kevin mccarthy where is matt gates getting
[52:42.840 --> 52:48.760]  advised advice from or is he moving all on his own to me the political brilliance from matt gates
[52:48.760 --> 52:55.800]  truly put on display in the last five days uh look matt gates is a very very smart guy
[52:55.800 --> 53:03.800]  he served in the florida state house before coming to the congress he knows how to uh count votes
[53:03.800 --> 53:10.440]  he also knows from the beginning he knew what his hand was here now i've had my differences
[53:10.440 --> 53:15.880]  with matt gates and very specifically when he out of nowhere started attacking alex jones a couple
[53:15.880 --> 53:22.120]  years ago never really understood that uh didn't like it uh but my hat's off to him i like matt
[53:22.120 --> 53:28.360]  gates i still consider a friend of mine despite our sometimes differences but he has conducted
[53:28.360 --> 53:38.200]  himself extraordinarily well uh in this entire uh controversy he is his own man uh he is a legislative
[53:38.200 --> 53:45.640]  genius in other words he knows the rules he understands the media cycle uh i was sorry to see
[53:45.640 --> 53:52.360]  marjorie taylor green uh abandoned the insurgents uh and jump on board with kevin mccarthy perhaps
[53:52.360 --> 53:59.160]  he wants to come on info wars and explain why she's done that uh but uh gates has been brilliant
[53:59.800 --> 54:05.800]  in this clip you have up now this is a perfect example of matt gates understanding the media
[54:05.800 --> 54:12.840]  trolling uh kevin mccarthy over the fact that mccarthy decided to go squat uh you know in the
[54:12.840 --> 54:18.520]  speaker's office when he hasn't been elected speaker writing a letter to the architect of the
[54:18.520 --> 54:26.520]  capital demanding that mccarthy be removed this is genius because gates understands not only the
[54:26.520 --> 54:35.960]  legislative process the politics behind all of this uh gates for example i'm sure anticipated
[54:35.960 --> 54:41.480]  being undercut or the attempt to undercut him with a statement by president donald trump
[54:41.480 --> 54:46.600]  uh and his response was perfect that trump's statement did not change gates opinion of
[54:46.600 --> 54:53.000]  either mccarthy or donald trump now let's move on uh and it has not moved any votes and i think
[54:53.000 --> 55:00.120]  that that is key i still do not rule out the possibility uh that trump could be prevailed
[55:00.120 --> 55:06.920]  upon to become speaker himself as you know uh one does not have to be a member of the house
[55:06.920 --> 55:14.760]  to be elected speaker uh any american who is uh an adult uh is uh is legally eligible to serve as
[55:14.760 --> 55:21.160]  speaker uh and um i still wouldn't rule out the possibility that putting forward the name of
[55:21.160 --> 55:28.120]  donald trump is what could break this log jim i'm not predicting it but i am saying it should not
[55:28.120 --> 55:34.680]  be ruled out um i was uh just told on a text message that the president would not rule out
[55:34.680 --> 55:40.360]  serving uh if the party should decide in the house that that's what they wanted meaning
[55:40.360 --> 55:46.760]  if his name was put in nomination he would not send word to the congress to remove his name
[55:46.760 --> 55:51.640]  so um as donald trump would say let's see what happens and i believe it was
[55:52.520 --> 55:56.200]  early in the evening yesterday donald trump released a statement basically saying it's
[55:56.200 --> 56:01.160]  time to support donald's instead of mccarthy i don't i don't have that in front of me right now
[56:01.160 --> 56:07.160]  so it was interesting that turns out to be a to be a fake news okay all right yeah thank you for
[56:07.160 --> 56:11.320]  clarifying that i was gonna say i didn't have the statement in front of me but you know here's what's
[56:11.320 --> 56:15.640]  here's what's interesting about this though i'm not surprised that mike pence doesn't move the
[56:15.640 --> 56:19.720]  needle at all i'm not surprised that sean hannity doesn't move the needle at all i'm not surprised
[56:19.720 --> 56:23.960]  that dan krenshaw doesn't move the needle at all but with trump it's a little different it is a
[56:23.960 --> 56:32.200]  little surprising and there's this line from the classic movie baseball where they say the oakland
[56:32.200 --> 56:36.360]  raiders moved from oakland to los angeles back to oakland and nobody noticed it was kind of like
[56:36.360 --> 56:43.960]  that with trump it's like trump re reinvested his support for kevin mccarthy for speaker and
[56:43.960 --> 56:48.200]  nobody noticed i mean it really didn't move the needle i like donald trump he's still the guy i
[56:48.200 --> 56:53.800]  want to support in 2024 but to me it's a good sign that the movement is bigger than trump and there's
[56:53.800 --> 56:59.000]  other people in the movement that realize how important this speaker spot is and getting the
[56:59.000 --> 57:04.040]  right guy in there is more important than getting the guy in there that the people that run the party
[57:04.040 --> 57:11.240]  want you know the supreme irony here of course is that the insurgents are holding out against mccarthy
[57:11.240 --> 57:19.720]  because they are committed to the trump agenda uh there's the irony in itself so the the the so
[57:19.720 --> 57:25.960]  called rebels the insurgents they're more trump than trump when it comes to their agenda for
[57:28.120 --> 57:31.800]  yeah that's absolutely right roger stone is with us i know he's good for at least another
[57:31.800 --> 57:37.240]  segment uh perhaps two again ladies and gentlemen the votes are coming in i don't i think we're
[57:37.240 --> 57:41.880]  going to have the exact same result as the last time mccarthy is going to be short again i think
[57:41.880 --> 57:46.920]  donald's is going to receive 20 maybe even 21 votes this time around short break we'll be right back
[57:46.920 --> 57:53.400]  with roger stone you want to beat the new world order you want to stop their globalist agenda
[57:53.400 --> 57:58.760]  well so do i and i've been the most affected individual in the fight against the globalist
[57:58.760 --> 58:03.880]  and i've got their number and i know how to bring them down but ladies and gentlemen i can't do it
[58:03.880 --> 58:10.520]  without your support and the good news is we're only under about 200 000 dollars a month the bad

[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.360]  monitoring the vote for speaker of the house here with roger stone on the alex joneshow and you
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:15.800]  know quickly it's funny it looks like biden is going to sneak down to the border for the first
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:21.480]  time as president while the distraction of this vote is going on how convenient i'm still not sure
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:26.280]  he's gonna go but the by biden has said he's gonna go visit the border of course he's gonna do it now
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.960]  while republicans are busy with the speaker vote and america's distracted with the speaker vote
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.680]  he's gonna sneak down to the border and hope nobody notices the crisis down there and he already
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:39.320]  gave a speech on it today with kamala it was just typical biden embarrassment but you know roger
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:46.920]  again i'm just i'm just at a loss here if i am trying to buy let's say i'm trying to buy a house
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:51.720]  and i'm talking to the bank to get a bank loan and they say okay here's the deal you want to get
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:56.840]  the house for whatever a million dollars and you're gonna put 50 000 down we need you to put 50 000
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:02.040]  down on this house i say okay 50 000 down i've got it i'll see you guys on monday and then you show up
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:07.880]  on monday and you have 40 000 and the guy says well i said 50 000 you go okay let me be right back
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:13.160]  you come back a second time still 40 000 number still 50 third time come back still 40 000 number
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:18.040]  still 50 oh okay i'm sorry i was confused i'll come back the next day with your 50 come back the next
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:22.760]  day same thing three times over you still got 40 they still need 50 and then you come back a third
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:30.120]  day with 40 needing 50 the immaturity the entitlement the the arrogance i mean how do you even measure
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:36.600]  this from kevin mccarthy on day three now well first of all i think you have to recognize that
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:44.280]  kevin mccarthy has been angling for this position for some time uh he was it was in contention uh
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:51.880]  when uh the republicans had the majority last time he lost when an extramarital affair between him
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:59.240]  and another member of the house female member of the house was publicly revealed and that's really
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:06.840]  how we got to paul ryan people have forgotten that uh kevin mccarthy used party money specifically
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:13.400]  national republican congressional committee to elbow out real america first trump loyalist
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:22.200]  candidates like laura lumar uh joe ken uh jr majuski uh and others uh to uh have a smaller
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:28.120]  majority if you go back and look at a number of the shows i did with alex jones i have predicted
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:35.240]  this exact moment what i said was if the republicans want a large majority the so-called red wave
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:41.720]  that turned into a pink drizzle um that mccarthy would be speaker right now by a wide margin
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:49.080]  uh and that is the case it is only because the elections were much much closer than we expected
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:56.040]  that were in this exact situation so in other words the republican establishment cut off its
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:01.640]  nose to spite its face and now they're not going to get their guy in there it appears that way
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:08.600]  and actually i think where mccarthy's greatest single error from the beginning has been his
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:16.520]  admission that he would not as speaker entertain a motion uh for the impeachment of joe biden
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:23.480]  you will remember uh long before any of us thought that it would gain any political currency
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:29.000]  al green from texas who i like much better when he was singing love and happiness than
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.480]  i liked as a member of congress uh al green introduced uh and the house allowed him to
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:41.720]  put forward articles of impeachment for donald trump despite a lack of any evidence of any
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:48.760]  impeachable offense in the case of joe biden kevin mccarthy has already said as speaker
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:55.240]  he would have not allowed the introduction of articles of impeachment now liberals uh say well
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:04:01.880]  on what grounds i'll give you the grounds 10 for the big guy there it is in writing from his son
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:08.440]  hard evidence of corruption uh and taking money from foreign countries while he was a sitting
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:14.280]  vice president more than enough evidence for impeachment even if the republicans don't believe
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:21.080]  they could get two thirds in the senate just as nancy polosi and adam schiff knew that they were
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:27.320]  never going to get two thirds in the senate it is essential that the house republicans move articles
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:32.520]  of impeachment and begin hearings uh and one of the first people need to be called in that hearing
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:40.360]  is right there in the picture hunter biden and his father joe the house democrats had no problem
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:46.760]  sending a subpoena to don from will the house republicans under a mccarthy speakership send
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.880]  roger don't you remember don jr was selling art for like a quarter million dollars to get
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:56.200]  political oh i'm sorry that was hunter i'm confused that was hunter biden selling his art for political
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:01.720]  favorite we'll be right back one more segment with roger stone there is a war on for your mind
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:08.920]  your mind is a battlefield this is an information war info wars popularized those terms more than
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:15.160]  two decades ago and today whether it's donald trump or governor sanis or dr robert malone
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:21.000]  they're all using the terms that info wars has popularized because we understand the enemy's
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.800]  operations and we know how to beat them but we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to

[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:54.200]  the new world order we're going over the top right now as a critical juncture so please go
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:06:08.200]  to info wars store dot com and donate now donate now donate now donate now donate now you found it
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:18.840]  the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow with olyn shroyer so he's pretty much official
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:27.160]  now mccarthy is not going to win he's now going to go over seven uh the triple platinum sombrero
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:33.000]  the uranium sombrero i'm not sure this is new unprecedented territory here the only thing
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.080]  that could potentially happen is democrats trying to lower the threshold with the rest
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:42.760]  of their votes hoping maybe it's enough to get jeffreys over the line but i don't think that's
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.720]  going to happen this go around and so i think we're going to have the same result we had in
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:56.280]  the sixth vote maybe an extra two votes for donald roger stone with us for one more segment so where
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:02.520]  do we go from here roger do we do this act of futility one more time do we do it for an eighth
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:08.280]  time a ninth time what about the rest of these republicans that continue to vote for mccarthy
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:13.080]  i mean how many times do they have to see him lose before they change their mind what do you
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:19.000]  think comes next roger stone uh first of all oh and i think the pressure on kevin mccarthy right
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:27.080]  now from those um who realize just by counting votes that he cannot possibly make it but are being
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:35.480]  held uh to their commitment to him has to be absolutely enormous let's knock down one important
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:43.160]  piece of disinformation coming from uh congressman krenshaw basically jeb bush with an eyepatch
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:51.160]  there is no prospect here whatsoever no scenario under which hakim jeffreys or nancy palosi
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:59.160]  is going to become speaker so that that bugaboo is completely false because there's always a republican
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:07.080]  majority uh and any effort to make a deal with hakim jeffreys i think would be a wood cost of
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:13.240]  kevin mccarthy votes so here's the problem in terms of what mccarthy is trying to do
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:22.360]  even as we speak he'd like to hold his 200 some odd votes uh and get enough democrats uh to
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:27.960]  abstain that the total number of votes that he requires to become speaker drops but if he
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:35.400]  makes that deal and it is apparent he will begin to hemorrhage votes from his basic 200 in other
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:43.080]  words there is no one in the republican caucus who wants to cede subpoena power to the house
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:50.920]  democrats and the democrats have made their demands pretty clear and they are all unacceptable so um
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:57.320]  he is really a man in a bind uh instead of calling matt gates and ego maniac let's be clear about who
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:03.720]  the real ego maniac here kevin mccarthy cannot face up to the fact that a majority of house
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:11.240]  republicans do not want him to be speaker and will not vote for him for speaker maybe he will
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:18.680]  rethink um sporting around the floor wearing the ukrainian flag pin uh and the ukrainian pocket
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:26.200]  square uh a major faux pas in my opinion if you look at those in the house who voted against the
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:32.600]  hundred billion dollars for ukraine and then cross-reference them with those who are voting
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:40.600]  against mccarthy today there's an amazing commonality owen and so again it's just the same thing is he
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:45.960]  gonna do this for an eighth straight time he never had the votes he was walking around the capital
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:51.800]  in november and december answering questions from reporters that's mccarthy saying no i have the
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.480]  votes and they'd respond and they say well gate says you don't have the votes and mccarthy called
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:00.840]  gates a liar so i mean it's mccarthy who's been eating crow it's mccarthy who has egg on his face
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:05.800]  i'm not sure what he's done to deserve this vote uh this speaker position to begin with but clearly
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:10.760]  he hasn't done enough and he's not going to get it so what do you think comes next do we have an
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:15.720]  eighth time where mccarthy has to take the l is he gonna still continue to say i need to do this
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.640]  i mean what is the honorable thing for him to do it's to step aside and say it's not gonna be me
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:26.280]  right yeah i mean at this point he would be wise to agree to the election of byron donald's uh and
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:32.920]  let this go but he's not going to do that because his lobbyist buddies uh who from whom he has taken
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:40.360]  multi millions not to mention the ftx money which he has yet to answer for um won't allow it i mean
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:46.840]  they bought a speaker they want the speaker that they bought and paid for so uh but in the end at
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:52.200]  the end of the day he's not the master of his own fate i talked to two members of the house this
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:57.400]  morning by phone they both told me the same thing which is what he has done in response to all this
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:04.440]  is to ratchet up the personal threats i will destroy you me and my lobbyist buddies and our
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:10.840]  millions of dollars uh in campaign contributions are coming at you in republican primaries you want
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:18.280]  to run a republican primary in the band handle against matt gates be my guest he will crush you
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:24.200]  if you go down that list paul gozar for example you're not going to defeat paul gozar in a republican
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:30.680]  primary doesn't matter how much special interest money you throw at it uh there's no member voting
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:36.840]  with the insurgents who is vulnerable in a primary in fact the principled stand that they've taken in
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:43.640]  this contest actually fortifies them uh from being challenged in a primary completely agree
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:51.720]  completely agree with that no popular grassroots support for kevin mccarthy none whatsoever
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:57.720]  he is presided over the systematic destruction of the california republican primary why have we
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:05.000]  lost so many house seats in california under the leadership of of of kevin mccarthy uh there are
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:12.920]  races there we should never ever have lost uh in in the golden state look it's over for this guy
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:19.720]  stick a fork in him he's done but no to answer your question directly oh and he will stretch this out
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:27.240]  as long as he as he possibly can because it's not his decision his the lobbyists who pull his strings
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:33.080]  the people who lined his coffers and told him to go out and help destroy maga candidates like
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:42.040]  laura loomer and joe ken and jr majuski uh and others uh mike crispy uh those uh those people
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:48.600]  are calling the shots and they have a heavy investment in kevin mccarthy they want what
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:54.040]  they paid for but it's apparent to me they're not going to get it well and here's here's another
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.680]  facet of this that's i think just great to witness and that's i've heard this from dan
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:05.640]  bishops i've heard this from scott perry i've heard it more or less from laura bobbert and
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:12.120]  matt gates and bob good and they say look they get asked the questions you know do you think this
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.320]  is hurting your political career what about reelection what about you getting money from
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:19.800]  mccarthy what about you getting support from us in the media like fox news and they've all had a
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.480]  very similar response again i've been really impressed with them being on message i've never
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:28.840]  seen such unity even if from a small number of republicans they've been very um enjoyable to watch
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:33.880]  this and that's they're saying look i've already got elected to come here and do a job i didn't get
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:39.080]  elected to run for reelection i'm not worried about getting money for my next campaign i'm not
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:44.040]  worried about the next primaries i was elected to do a job here that's what we're here to do
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:50.520]  what a refreshing message from these republicans holding out uh strongly against kevin mccarthy
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:57.080]  i'm there that is something i haven't heard from a politician ever yeah it is really quite
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:03.240]  extraordinary as i said earlier i think every one of those of those who are voting against kevin
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:10.120]  mccarthy actually now fortified in their position in their districts there is no grassroots republican
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:16.920]  primary voter support for kevin mccarthy uh if you look at the polls and you know we become
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:23.400]  poll crazy and as i've said on your show and on alex's show any poll is a snapshot in time
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:30.200]  but in all of the polls it is not incoincidental that that kevin mccarthy and mitch mcconnell are the
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:38.280]  by far far less popular than any other figure in their republican party and you'll see mixed
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:45.560]  poll results on donald trump and on ron desantis but read the fine print and you'll see that among
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:52.120]  primary voters trump still is in very very strong even a commanding position there is no public
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:58.280]  support for kevin mccarthy uh or for mitch mcconnell uh you know it is one of the great ironies in the
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:04.920]  shames uh oan that our shows the war room the original war room the one i was proud to be the
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:11.480]  co-host co-host of for a number of years and my show stone zone are both on it five o'clock eastern
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:16.360]  you can go to stonezone dot live if you want to see me uh you can go to the war room if you want
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:22.360]  to see oan whichever one of these you do watch you can watch the other one on rerun uh the next day
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:29.000]  or by going to band dot video uh but maybe alex will offer me my old job back and i'll be in the
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.360]  second saddle there at the war room who knows roger stone throwing the weight around today
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:39.080]  god love you roger get great stuff as always we'll be monitoring this and you know what i love
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:45.800]  about roger folks he's in touch with the people just like i am you can clearly see how the republican
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.560]  establishment has no idea what the people are thinking and what the people desire they're
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:53.160]  only thinking about themselves and they're learning the hard way they're completely out of touch

[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:15.560]  day after day
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:26.360]  alone on a hill the man with the foolish green is keeping perfectly still
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:34.040]  but nobody wants to show him this is over seven this is just embarrassing honestly
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:41.240]  and watching and listening to the conservative establishment republican establishment
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:47.000]  conservative mainstream legacy news saying that this is embarrassing for gage this is embarrassing
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.480]  for the freedom caucus this is embarrassing for republican voters it's really amazing how out of
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:58.440]  touch they are isn't it they're not even anywhere close to what the will of the people is they're
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:02.760]  not even trying to find out what the people are thinking and feeling in this moment it's like they
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:09.400]  don't even care because they're used to dictating how things go from the top down fox news and those
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:14.360]  and those hosts up there not all of them they're used to telling you how it's going to be they're
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:18.840]  used to getting the inside information reporting it to you and then it all going exactly how it should
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:27.320]  that's how the dc east coast elitism has worked in dc for my entire life that ends today
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:36.280]  and when i said this is going to be 2016 all over again is it not just like that the entire
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:43.400]  establishment the entire republican gop establishment against these 20 freedom caucus members
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:49.320]  and then everybody going on tv and on their on their twitter accounts and in interviews bashing
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:53.960]  them saying they're the bad guys they're embarrassing themselves uh know quite the opposite actually
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:22:01.320]  kevin mccarthy has embarrassed himself for the seventh straight time and every time i hear and
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:06.120]  see one of these talking heads go on television news saying how embarrassing this is for matt
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:12.280]  gates and them you're the embarrassment you're being rejected just like your guy kevin mccarthy
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:19.880]  now matt gates has nominated donald trump to be speaker of the house to which got a bit of a
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:27.400]  rousing laugh from marjorie taylor green sitting next to him today will ask her about that when
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:35.400]  we get her on so a lot more to cover here today including and i've got a stack of this news we
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:43.080]  may have time to get to it we may not i do have double duty today that's the buffalo bill's safety
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:50.760]  that suffered the cardiac arrest and essentially died on the football field good news coming out
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:56.360]  today that he's beginning to show signs of consciousness again and moving his eyes and
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:04.920]  starting to get some movement in his extremities as well now obviously for everybody praying and
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:13.960]  hoping the best for this young man the news couldn't be any better you hope it continues to improve but
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:20.600]  now you're looking at a situation where i don't think the nfl is going to address the elephant in
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:27.240]  the room here and that's the increased risk of cardiac events on the field with all of their
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:35.400]  vaccinated players that may have myocarditis or a covid-19 vaccine fiber clot in their body that
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:42.360]  they don't know about and so you hate to think that this thing that we saw on monday night this week
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:49.080]  could inevitably happen again but considering the nfl is probably not going to address this issue
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:56.440]  you wonder if that's not the case so we may get back to that as well but of course joe biden is
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:04.360]  going to allegedly go visit the border while we're all talking about this speaker vote we'll see if
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:11.960]  that actually happened so we're moving on to vote number eight mccarthy just what an embarrassment
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:19.400]  honestly since november he's been telling everyone he had the votes he literally never had the votes
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:27.640]  and that obstinate arrogant kevin mccarthy continues to get up there to try to become the
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:35.080]  speaker and he's now 047 but i think roger stone nails it maybe mccarthy doesn't have a choice
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:42.040]  it's the donor class that obviously wants mccarthy in there it's mccarthy who was using ftx money
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:49.960]  to help the republicans he wanted to get in and hurt the republicans he didn't want to get in
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:55.880]  which ironically enough looks like it's now going to cost him to be the speaker of the house maybe
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:03.800]  that's what he deserves for it but i guess that's the case because why if you're kevin mccarthy
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:09.880]  how are you not reading the room by now you're not going to win you never had the votes the american
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:15.320]  people are not interested in you being the speaker specifically republicans and conservatives so what
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:21.480]  are you doing up here well i guess it's pretty obvious the donors want him in there the republican
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:28.040]  establishment wants him in there because he raises money and then he does a good job doling
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:34.520]  out that money for swamp candidates and not america first candidates that's clearly what's
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:38.760]  going on with mccarthy why else would he continue to run and embarrass himself like this now ladies
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:46.120]  and gentlemen we heard from alex jones earlier and we have done well this week despite alex being
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:51.240]  off the air normally numbers drop off obviously it's alex jones when he's not here the numbers
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:55.880]  drop off we've done pretty well this week with viewership and the big news going on and and i'm
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:26:00.680]  i'm really honored by that and i thank the audience for the viewership the problem is it's not translating
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:05.640]  to sales and so while we're still paying high costs for the bandwidth just to be on every day
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:11.480]  we're not getting the makeup that we need in sales right now so please folks shop at info
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:16.120]  or store.com and there's something there that you want there's something there that you need
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:21.880]  and if you're not supplementing at this point in your life i i really just have to wonder why
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:26.600]  you know you're not getting what you need in the food supply the food supply has been mostly
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:32.200]  degradated down and the soil has been depleted from the nutrients it's it's a serious problem
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:36.920]  we're not talking about with the gmo's and everything else so i mean it's very rare that you can even
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:40.920]  it's hard to eat healthy i mean let's just put it that way it's hard to eat healthy but
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:45.800]  you can at least know you're still getting the vitamins and minerals that you need
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:51.560]  with stuff like vitamin mineral fusion over 100 percent your daily value of vitamin a vitamin b6
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:58.040]  vitamin b12 vitamin c vitamin d vitamin e and so much more glycine everything else in there
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:05.320]  boron in there it's truly just a a a a wonder drink mix vitamin mineral fusion the real red pill
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:11.240]  plus by the way both are 50 off right now at infowarstore.com i think you're crazy not to be
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:17.000]  supplementing i've been supplementing in in my life ever since i was in high school and and really
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:23.720]  even probably before that with my with my parents both both health conscious individuals as well
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:31.560]  so my father going up you know he was an athlete college athlete my mother into physical training
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:36.520]  in therapy so i've been using supplements for years long before i ever joined info wars or
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:42.520]  knew about infowarstore.com because i'm i'm just somebody who's always been health conscious and
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:47.880]  i realized that supplements are very important to staying in peak health and so we just want to

[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:51.720]  well it's done and nothing changed
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:59.320]  you have the eighth vote i'm not hearing or seeing anything about mccarthy removing himself from the
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:08.200]  conversation here so i guess we're just gonna keep doing this i mean how many times
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:13.480]  what's the threshold here until mccarthy finally says okay i've lost enough i think i'll stop or
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:18.520]  are his donors telling him you're never bowing out you're staying in this we paid for you to
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:24.200]  be speaker the house you're going to get that spot suppose only time will tell now
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:33.080]  we're waiting to hear from marjorie taylor green she's obviously still there on the house floor
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:39.560]  dealing with the speaker vote and sitting next to matt gates today uh engaging in a little bit of
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:47.880]  light-hearted camaraderie but disagreements i think it's all good i think it's all healthy quite frankly
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:54.440]  so here's what's funny to me though sitting here and watching the establishment g.o.p republican
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:35:02.600]  party conservative ink news acting like oh my gosh these holdout stop in ken mccarthy they're the
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:08.040]  problem they're so bad this is what's wrong with dc i mean what a joke we're 50 trillion dollars in
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:13.720]  debt we've given 150 billion to ukraine while our people are suffering we've got record high inflation
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:21.640]  record i producer price index increase record i consumer price index increase wide open southern
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:27.560]  border washington has been raping the american people for years but oh 20 republican stopping
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:32.520]  kevin mccarthy that's the big issue oh yes that's what we should all be concerned about no
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:40.040]  all of you in the mainstream news all of you in the establishment all of you east coast elites
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:47.320]  ramming your politics down our throats you have been the problem not 20 republicans
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:53.160]  standing off against kevin mccarthy you you have been there while they perpetuated all of these
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:58.440]  wars costing us trillions of dollars and millions of lives and you did nothing you went along with it
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:03.720]  same people that said we can never have trump trump's the worst use their platform to bash
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:07.800]  trump and keep trump out and they're telling us that we're the problem they're telling us that
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:13.720]  gates is the problem no my friends you are the problem and no matter how much you try to distract
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:18.840]  from that and put the blame on gates and bobert and the rest of them the facts will never change
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:23.640]  the american people have had the awakening we've broken from the establishment and we're not looking
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:30.520]  back no matter how much money you launder through ukraine or ftx or or threaten the people
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:37.400]  that refuse to vote for mccarthy so let me do this i have a ton of news on my desk but we've
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:41.160]  been very news heavy all week and i want to hear what you think about the speaker vote
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:45.800]  as we wait to hear from marjorie taylor green and i'm also going to be hosting the war room so
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:53.480]  we'll be smattering calls and news the rest of the day here at info wars dot com and band dot video
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:59.080]  may also be hearing from alex jones as well so let me give out the phone number specifically
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:04.840]  though i just want to hear from you on this house speaker vote just on that and i don't want to
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:10.840]  head do long drawn out phone calls here be ready to give about a two minute three minutes max
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.520]  three minutes is going to be if you hit three minutes i'm just cutting you off no matter where
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:20.120]  it is or how powerful the statement is but i'm looking for two minutes eight seven seven seven
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:24.680]  eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine what do you
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:28.840]  think about the speaker vote mccarthy now over seven what do you think about roger stone's comments
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:33.800]  what do you think about my comments matt gates donald trump getting nominated byron donalds being
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:38.920]  the front runner right behind mccarthy now that's what i want to hear from you on
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:45.800]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine let me kind of play catch up for a second
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:56.600]  here just to kind of reemphasize and focus the conversation so i have to tell you even in the
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:05.960]  trump years when he was president i've never seen a group of republicans big or small as unified
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:14.120]  and as on message and unwavering and effective as the holdouts against kevin mccarthy have become
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:20.680]  i've never seen it before every interview they do they are all on message they are all on point
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:25.880]  they are all unwavering and clearly they are effective in their political strategy clearly
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:29.880]  it's working so so you can sit here and listen to all the hemming and the hawing and the complaining
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:40.120]  from the establishment uh you keep losing so in case you haven't noticed you can keep threatening
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:44.760]  all the people that vote against mccarthy they're not moving you can even have donald trump tell
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:53.800]  him to vote for mccarthy they're not moving truly an impressive feat truly a breath of fresh air
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:59.480]  truly giving me hope i think it's more important quite frankly what they're doing than even
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:06.280]  getting the speaker in i'll be honest i think what they're doing is more important than even
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:12.520]  having a republican speaker because it sets a precedent it sets a mood it sets a tone that the
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:18.920]  republican party or rather the representatives that we elect in the republican party are no
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:27.480]  longer going to be beholden to a top down way of operating with policy but instead a bottom up
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:33.240]  meaning we the people we the voters who really are the top that just hasn't been the case for the
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:39.160]  while where they're more concerned with what we think than what the donor class thinks what the
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:44.200]  dc elite think what the east coast elite think what the fox news elite think you know who we're
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:51.880]  talking about conservative ink to me that stand no matter what happens with this speaker vote
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:59.320]  that stand is more important than anything to set that standard that precedent and that tone
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:05.720]  heading into 2024 now if you don't address the election issues it might not matter but still the
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:13.240]  tone is right and it's it's even better i think than in 2016 with donald trump getting in it's
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:20.920]  more on message it's more unwavering and it's been more effective but here's just some of the other
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:28.760]  headlines and and again i was talking about this over the weekend and then on monday and obviously
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:33.640]  it's not come to fruition so i think there obviously were some discussions back and forth with
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:40.120]  what democrats might do to either help or hurt mccarthy but none of that's happened yet and i
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:44.600]  don't suspect that will i mean you've had seven votes now this is day three if you were going to
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:48.760]  see that phenomenon i feel like it would have already played out republicans and democrats
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:52.920]  quietly considering a speakership deal and that would obviously be the uniparty either trying
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:58.840]  to get mccarthy in or get jeffreys in and then blame the republicans for the holdout to make
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:04.920]  them look bad and try to do a judo move to stop any republican anti-establishment
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:10.840]  mentalities in the future but but i think that's i think that ship has sailed now quite frankly
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:15.800]  now they were saying last night that kevin mccarthy caved to all the demands
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:20.280]  and i don't think that's the case because he still didn't get any of the votes
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:27.800]  then you have uh you know the the the familiar names the familiar faces dan krenshaw says
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:31.800]  people are terrorists for not voting for mccarthy and if you don't like that growth thicker skin
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:41.000]  i just want a despicable act he's even cursing at them swearing at them insulting them dan
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:50.520]  krenshaw like again this guy's not even popular in republican voter groups hannity attacking
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:56.280]  lauren bobert last night doesn't surprise me the new york post with the ukraine flag on their thing
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:59.400]  and i like the new york post i go there all the time for news i think they do good work
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:04.200]  they're bashing the republicans that won't vote for mccarthy mike pence comes out bashes the
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:08.840]  republicans that won't vote for mccarthy trump's endorsement proves workplace to kevin mccarthy
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:15.880]  and speaker bid that's that's really an interesting one right there and and and what have i been saying
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:22.680]  for the last couple weeks what what day was it last year i declared trump's trump's campaign is is
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:28.760]  dead you may recall that about about a month or two ago i said trump's trump's political campaign
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:35.800]  right now is flatlining it's it's becoming a non-issue and i think that's proven that him
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:41.960]  saying he signed a vote for mccarthy to no effect at all shows but that's good because trump needs
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:48.120]  to learn that too we the people want to dictate what's going to go on in our future we the people
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:55.160]  want to dictate policy we're sick of being railroaded run over and raped by washington dc so trump i
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:43:03.400]  think hopefully heard that message info war secret weapon is finally here it's a secret weapon for

[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:35.320]  we're gonna take your calls on the house speaker vote issue a couple things here before i go to
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:39.400]  the lines though this is from representative scott parry one of the heroes holding out
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:45.880]  39 years in the army taught me you take fire when you're over the target threaten me try to
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:51.640]  assassinate my character all you like i'm staying over the target and changing the status quo for
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:59.080]  the american people yeah just look at the character on display from the mccarthy supporters like dan
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:04.040]  krenshaw calling everybody who won't vote for mccarthy terrorists and and and swearing at them
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:13.080]  versus the mccarthy holdouts like scott parry one side is showing class and grace the other side
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:22.760]  is showing crass and disgust not that we're surprised but see here's here's where you see this is the
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:31.720]  populist movement inside the republican party rearing its head right now prominent republican
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:37.400]  leaders sign a letter in support of the 20 g.o.p. house members opposing mccarthy for speaker
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:43.240]  and these are some of the grass roots organizations out there not the big billionaire donor class not
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:52.760]  the dc east coast elites this is the conservative action committee this is the tea party patriot
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:49:03.320]  citizen fund this is the citizens united group first liberty institute state freedom caucus
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:08.520]  network conservative partnership institute american accountability foundation
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:15.640]  and then some other members of the ronald reagan administration
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:23.720]  former house members etc etc so these are the people in touch with we the people
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:28.520]  who know we don't want kev mccarthy you can think mccarthy's the greatest guy or the worst
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:34.840]  guy ever point is we the people don't want him and we want some representation in dc that actually
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:39.800]  represents what we the people want not what the donor class and establishment want that's the status
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:45.400]  quote change scott parry and others are going for it now let's go to your phone calls we're waiting
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:52.760]  to hear from marjorie taylor green and for an eighth vote we're going to do it all over again
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:57.240]  they're going to do the exact same thing nothing is going to change that's my prediction right now
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:01.880]  now nothing is going to change they're going to do it for an eighth time kevin mccarthy's
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:08.840]  going to take an eighth loss and about probably they'll start the process at about 30 minutes
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:12.920]  to an hour i mean just just just what an absolute embarrassment like how do they think this is
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:17.960]  going to go are they just get it they just think they're going to bully us and insult us and threaten
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:28.200]  us into giving them kevin mccarthy it's not going to happen sorry we're doing bottom up
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:34.680]  policy from now on not top down railroading the people all right let's go to the phone
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:39.400]  lines joshua in connecticut leads us off today on the alex joneshow joshua you're on the air go
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:44.840]  ahead um i just wanted to uh let you know that this is a process that the people can actually
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:51.080]  um lobby their congress without the interference of the actual um special interest and so what
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:55.160]  i've been doing is i've been calling around a whole bunch of different um congress people
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:51:00.920]  in their offices and try to lobby for you know for my community for my family for my friends and
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:05.320]  um some of these people are really good and really kind but i want to want to say i called
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:10.200]  margaret taylor green's office the other day and i wanted to make ask him a clarification on one
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:16.200]  of the statements that she made about kevin mccarthy's money being sold out to these people and i
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:22.600]  want to say i want a clarification on that and they wouldn't they they would not answer my question
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:27.000]  so i kept calling back and calling back and calling back and then when i finally got to somebody
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:34.040]  what they said was do you know what harassment is and we'll report you to the actual um uh
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:39.480]  capital police so i reported myself i just want to say because if i can't call my constituent
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:43.320]  and that's harassment and i'm willing to go to jail for it and everybody should be willing
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:49.160]  to do that you know it's amazing that you are the first caller today because one of the things
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:54.600]  that kept me up last night can you hear me josh we're having a problem with the phones thanks
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:52:01.240]  for the call josh um i heard everything you said though it's amazing that's the first call
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:05.480]  today one of the things that kept me up last night you know i obviously got a lot of response to
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:15.720]  my commentary the last three days and some some supportive some not so much but that wasn't what
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:21.080]  kept me up what kept me up was one thing that i missed and that was
[01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:29.240]  the encouragement to the audience to call or email or message your local representative's office
[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:34.920]  and it's so easy it's so obvious it's such a it should be a go to we just we just don't make it
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:41.480]  a habit and you know i'm not even going to tell you what you should call and say or or if you should
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:47.480]  call and and tell them not to vote mccarthy you know do do what you want but the caller's absolutely
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:51.480]  right and i was thinking about that last night it was really it was really a thought i just couldn't
[01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:56.680]  get out of my head and it was keeping me up and i'm so glad he called with that because
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:53:02.200]  they've given us another opportunity thank god so i mean folks you can still email your local
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:10.920]  representatives who have a vote in this process you can still email all these representative
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:16.920]  elects and tell them we don't want mccarthy you can tell them why or tell them if you do want
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:23.400]  mccarthy whatever you think is the case but if you are not doing some form of political action like
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:28.600]  that then we're really not utilizing our full power here i need to move on to these calls i'm
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:32.680]  going to stop laxing let's go to tom in california tom you're on the air go ahead
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:38.520]  hey owin let me get you off here you know why i had you on speaker i got to work

[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:58.200]  hey i pay taxes so i want i got a message from marjorie taylor green she has a great
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:05.000]  voting record but guess what it doesn't matter when she knows that her the policies aren't
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:13.080]  going to get through okay so here's the only vote that counts and that is she needs to change her vote
[01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:23.080]  today or she's a fraud okay and she doesn't deserve to come on info wars if she doesn't change
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:28.840]  your vote today because she's a fraud have a great day i gotta go back to work thank you all right
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:35.880]  tom thanks for the call um i disagree i disagree with tom i i don't think that uh one vote makes
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:41.000]  marjorie taylor green a fraud i i do disagree with her on this issue i still like marjorie taylor green
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.320]  i still think she's one of the good ones in there and uh i hope that she does come on to
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:50.760]  either explain why she supports mccarthy or just to give us a little idea of what's going on today
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:54.840]  as we're moving on to the eighth vote and it's going to be the same thing as the last seven
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:55:00.680]  votes so i mean you know you know exactly how it's going to go but uh look i'm not i'm not ready to
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:04.840]  throw marjorie taylor green under the bus at all she has her reasons for supporting mccarthy and and
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:09.880]  i hope she'll come on and voice them or maybe she'll change her mind and and that's one thing i'd
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:16.360]  like to reemphasize here yeah i i do have a disposition towards the deep state yeah yeah i do
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:23.480]  disdain what i've seen in washington dc and political elitists for my entire life
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:34.040]  having said that we have to work for the world that we want and we need to be able to disagree
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:39.960]  and we need to be able to discuss and debate issues without it becoming vitriolic and and just
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:47.960]  having these no holds barred ultimatums that's not the world we want and i understand people
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:51.320]  think that that's the only way we're going to get to the world we want but no i think having
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:57.800]  disagreements discussions and debates is a much healthier way to do that let's go to
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:05.080]  joseph in long island joseph you're on the air go ahead yeah what's up i just want to say that
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:09.480]  what difference does it make on who speaks on behalf of a corrupt house it's all corrupt
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:14.040]  it's horrible in my opinion everything's a distraction right now to distract us from the
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:19.880]  shots the shots are m r and a it's a tracking system biometric tracking system which has
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:24.840]  radioactive substances that's the only way you can make a biometric biometric tracking system
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:29.160]  everyone is getting radiation poisoning so that's you can look that up in the literature
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:36.280]  pull up m r and a radio label definition any substance bound to a radioactive material everyone
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:40.680]  is dying from radiation poisoning that's what they're trying to distract you from we all we
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:45.320]  are limited on time and people need to be treated for radiation thickness that's what we have to
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:52.520]  focus on right now well uh joseph i understand the issue obviously info wars has been one of the
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:58.920]  leading voices on that issue but uh i mean to say that the house vote is a distraction from that i
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:04.040]  mean this is the normal process this happens every time there's a new congress elected so it's not
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:09.720]  like they just decided to do this to distract us this happens every two years so i'm not really
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:15.400]  sure saying that this is a distraction from that is accurate at all because this is a normal process
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:19.640]  now do they not want us talking about that are they distracting from that are they not wanting to
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:23.080]  bring that up when it comes to the nfo football player absolutely i'm not disagreeing with your
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:29.240]  points here except this is the normal process this happens every time there is a new congress and so
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:35.480]  that's just par for the course on that and by the way i'm in agreement too the whole thing is corrupt
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:39.960]  if these hold out i mean i don't even care shut congress down for all i care they do this whole
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:44.200]  thing where they're like oh they threaten us like oh we'll shut down the government please
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:51.480]  please when can you do that you want to beat the new world order you want to stop their globalist

[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:39.720]  thrown himself in the ring to be speaker i could live with a matt gates a speaker so i like matt gates
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:46.680]  but i don't have the answer i but i just don't have the answer i don't know
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:50.600]  oh okay i just thought i'd fill it out there but
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:02:02.120]  okay well uh it seems donalds is the choice to replace mcarthy so uh that's where it's going
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:08.120]  now even though gates did nominate donald trump with the seventh vote so we may see another surprise
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:13.080]  with the eighth vote incoming but the results will be the same steve thanks for the call
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:19.080]  let's go to josh in arizona josh you're on the alex joneshow go ahead hey man uh i just want to
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:23.160]  echo what that last guy said the one that you know had to make a quick statement because he was going
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:28.120]  to work um i really think that you should ask marjorie taylor greener she's compromised but
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:33.000]  they've got something on her because for incoming divorce there's something's going on with that
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:38.920]  because you know it just kind of seemed like there was a major flip flop with her it was really weird
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:44.440]  you know like she's all this gung-ho and then she's behind kevin mcarthy all of a sudden and he's on
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:51.560]  the weef homepage as like the speaker majority i something's going on and i just was wondering
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:58.280]  if you could do me a favor and actually ask her a point blank like do they have something on her i
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:04.040]  mean look let me respond to this if her people are tuned in and then they hear these calls they're
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:08.280]  not going to let her come on and if i come out and say i'm going to do that to her then she's
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:12.360]  not going to come on and i don't really want to do that to her i i plan on asking her legitimate
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:17.560]  questions but i think these concerns are legitimate as well i don't want to get into that issue
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:25.240]  you because there's very few congressmen and women that will even come on these area waves
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:31.640]  to talk to us and if she's willing to do that then i then i thank her for that i'm not discounting
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:38.840]  your concerns here i mean i i'm just saying you know strategically that wouldn't be the best move
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:45.320]  to do at this point and i'm not ready to completely disregard marjorie taylor green is one of the good
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:50.760]  people in congress because maybe the last month or so we've had some questions about her activities
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:56.040]  but uh you're never gonna see eye to eye with someone completely nobody's gonna be perfect
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:01.320]  but i'll just leave that there and take another call let's go to brian calling in he's somewhere
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:06.840]  in america brian you're on the air go ahead hey oh i'm shaking brother howdy
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:13.400]  so yeah i'm sitting here watching on c span i think that i think this is great i haven't felt
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:17.640]  this good in a while we actually can make a difference i agree i have not felt this good
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:22.760]  since trump was president you know i'm saying you know this is this is our chance we have
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:28.600]  20 people that are actually listening to us completely agree i completely agree with everything
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:33.560]  you say man you guys are doing a great job all right brian great call these are great calls
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:40.520]  this is how we do it get in make your point and we move on they've started the eighth vote here we go
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:51.080]  go kevin mccarthy going for the quadruple platinum sombrero what an absolute embarrassment
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:57.720]  and then they try to act like the heroes of this are the ones that are losing uh no that's not the case
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:03.800]  there is a war on for your mind your mind is a battlefield this is an information war
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:11.160]  war is popularized those terms more than two decades ago and today whether it's donald trump
[02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:18.440]  or governor sannis or dr robert malone they're all using the terms that info wars has popularized
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:22.920]  because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them but we can't do

[02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:31.400]  sorry this is so ridiculous and and there's so many stories behind the story again this is this is
[02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:40.680]  the this is the what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object the unstoppable
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:50.920]  force is the great awakening the re the re awakening the new renaissance patriotism returned
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:07:00.440]  common sense returned through the american people versus the unstoppable or the unmovable object
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:07.080]  rather which is the deep state the swamp the donor class dominating us with their political will
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:12.760]  that's an unmovable object but we're the unstoppable force this is it meeting right now
[02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:18.680]  that's what you're saying so they just started the next vote i don't expect anything to change
[02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:24.600]  mccarthy will take his eighth loss and we'll just go through the process a ninth time probably
[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:28.360]  and then they'll move on till tomorrow is what it looks like is going to happen here
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.680]  and then do we do it all over again or does mccarthy finally say it's not going to be me
[02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:37.400]  or do the republicans that keep voting for him say we're done with this act of utility we need
[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:42.440]  to move on but i expect we're just going to see the same thing again today now we're taking your calls
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:50.040]  in case you were wondering though why did they say why when speaking on the floor
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:58.520]  did dan bishops in his great speech say byron donalds is not a prop well that's because
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:04.040]  cori bush democrat member of the squad called him that now it's funny because cori bush is a major
[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:10.440]  black activist as the representative from st lewis she's she's a major black activist
[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:17.800]  he may even call her a black supremacist but oh when it comes to byron donalds now all of a
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:23.480]  sudden she doesn't like the black man byron donalds is not a historic candidate for speaker
[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:30.280]  he is a prop despite being black he supports a policy agenda intent on upholding and perpetuating
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:36.280]  white supremacy his name being in the mix is not progress it's pathetic so so here's what you need
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:40.280]  to understand about liberals and democrats i've explained it before but just another example
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:46.040]  whenever they do all this virtue signaling over race and skin color or anything else gay rights
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:51.000]  all the other stuff it has nothing to do with race it has nothing to do with skin color it has
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:56.440]  nothing to do with sexuality it has everything to do with politics because the minute you're gay and
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:01.880]  not a democrat they hate you the minute you're black and not a democrat they hate you they're all
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:08.120]  frauds they don't actually care about racial issues they don't actually care about whatever sex issues
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:13.320]  they don't it's always politics so you can be black you can be gay you can be all this other
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:19.560]  stuff they virtue signal for but if you're not on the thought cult chain if you're not in the
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:24.200]  thought cult if you don't do the same politics they do then you're out doesn't matter whether
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:29.640]  you're black or gay so it's all virtue signaling it's all fraud proven once again by a liberal
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:39.960]  democrat cori bush let's go back to the phone lines and let's go to tim in seattle tim you're on the
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:47.320]  air go ahead hey uh oh an amazing show again um happy new year to you thank you yeah i was just
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:53.560]  curious um even if we get whoever is speaker of the house are are we not i mean didn't we just
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:58.920]  learn the lesson that all politicians are selected to oversee the ongoing genocide of the american
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:07.400]  people you're talking about the issue of um you have no faith in our elections i have no faith in
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:12.440]  the suits that that are running for office that are employed by the world economic form i mean
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:16.760]  they've all signed treaties back for treaties we were aware of this the research shows us i mean
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:22.360]  i mean they're just silence when they need and then they have some slight talking points that
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:27.640]  the establishment puts out but other than that the real situation the real issues that americans are
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:32.200]  are desperate to hear about from our leadership are what the hell's going on with the shots in
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:38.520]  nernberg too and nobody's saying that sure nobody yeah in fact the atlantic the atlantic just
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:44.360]  published a story today and you know this is going to be the thing and it's obviously good
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:49.320]  that demar hamlin is looking like uh he's going to come out of this and be all right and maybe
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:54.120]  have a chance to live a normal life but with that good news of course they're going to use it to say
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:59.080]  see vaccine skeptics see it had nothing to do with the vaccine and then the atlantic publishes the
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:05.800]  story today saying that the whole thing about vaccine side effects is a myth so again i don't
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:13.080]  know the full story here it would i think it would appear that you have a myocarditis or
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:16.680]  some other side effect from the vaccine that could have made the situation worse i still think it was
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:20.360]  the contact that caused the event but it was made worse potentially by a vaccine side effect
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:25.160]  but we're never going to get to know that they're going to cover that up and they're going to write
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:31.320]  hit pieces today saying see told yourself well i mean they can lie all they want we know what
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:35.960]  they're doing they're lying i mean it's obvious yeah and that's good tim it's just i want to focus
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:41.240]  on the kevin mccarthy issue today and so and it's it's been two minutes i don't disagree it's a good
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:45.880]  call here but uh i want to continue to focus on the house vote as we've now moved into the eighth
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:50.280]  vote and i'm telling you this exact same thing is going to happen let's go to lile in idaho lile
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:56.680]  you're on the air go ahead hey good afternoon oh thanks for taking my call thanks for calling
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:07.640]  i you know i'm a skeptic um no matter who gets in there but um you know inside of being black
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:15.960]  pilled i sent an email to a rush bull in northern idaho uh last night and in essence what i what i
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:22.440]  said to him was i was disappointed not to see her name on the list or move mccarthy that the
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:28.200]  establishment neocons including baner the first two years of the trump administration were just
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:35.240]  business as usual with k street running the show i we can't even get a southern border secured
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:43.000]  mccarthy was pivotal or excuse me pivotal in um doling out dark money from the donor class of
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:50.520]  the neocons through back channels to uh alice madison cothorn in north carolina and to keep others
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:59.240]  like um joe kent out as well yeah and the truth is if you dig into these neocons uh background
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:05.960]  there is corrupt in speckless's Pelosi ship and schumer and if the rhinos taking money from ftx
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:12.760]  after being laundered back from the ukraine or mcconnell's wife ties to the ccp chinese shipping
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:18.280]  corporations i mean the politicos get rich and the american people get bucked you know you're
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:26.440]  absolutely right and and again it's ironic that kevin mccarthy using his power of the purse to
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:32.920]  keep good candidates out of the house of congress uh is ultimately i think going to end up backfiring
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:37.880]  on him and keeping him out of being the speaker but you're absolutely right why does the donor
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:42.520]  class like kevin mccarthy so much why does the dc establishment like kevin mccarthy so much
[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:48.360]  because he was effective at making sure that good republican candidates didn't cross the finish line
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:53.240]  like joe kent and so many others now laura luma reporting on this with the receipts today i mean
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:59.160]  she's literally publishing the receipts on her twitter account here's the fec proof that gop leader
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:05.480]  kevin mccarthy received funds from ftx co-chair ryan david salame mccarthy received up to 30 million
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:12.600]  dollars in stolen ftx funds which were illegally used in gop primaries and um she's tagged aoc in
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:17.720]  this because yesterday she ran into aoc outside of congress and asked her if she knew about this
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:23.080]  now aoc was trying to run from luma but she was able to elicit a response when she brought
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:28.280]  up the issue of the ftx money to which aoc said she hadn't heard of that yet and so maybe she's
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:34.920]  heard of it now but uh absolutely that's why kevin mccarthy got in there thank you for the call
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:42.040]  leo let's quickly go to tito in california tito you're on the air go ahead hey how you doing um
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:46.680]  so i just want to say thank you to those 20 republicans standing up because um it just shows
[02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:51.720]  that you know what grassroots we matter you know we the people matter and they also remind me of uh
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:57.160]  in california when um the governor's race um there was conservatives the republicans
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:15:03.320]  standing up to the gop by not voting for brian dolly it reminds me of that a lot meaning that
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:09.400]  hey we're here we matter and they're listening so i support what they're doing well and here's
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:15.240]  what has been a phenomenon that i've witnessed and that's just because this is what i do i consume
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:21.560]  probably an unhealthy amount of news but i've noticed this trend whenever i go to the establishment
[02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:27.240]  legacy media outlets like a fox news with the same elitist that have been on there for decades
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:33.480]  they're all the ones saying support mccarthy whenever i go to american patriot media or alternative
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:38.520]  media or conservatives who aren't part of the establishment swamp they're all against mccarthy
[02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:43.560]  so there's clearly a break here it's never been more obvious about who wants the establishment
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:49.640]  status quo to stay to stay the same and who wants it to change it's never been more obvious just
[02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:54.520]  like it was in 2015 and 16 with trump we're living it all over again just like i said we would and i'm

[02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:12.360]  out there the news there's no better news source to me and uh and so thank you again well i appreciate
[02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:17.560]  that brad and let me tell you i don't take it lightly that you put your blood sweat and tears
[02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:23.480]  into making a living and then you share some of that here with us and that's why we myself the
[02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:28.840]  crew and alex have put our blood sweat and tears into this every day so it's a mutual thing and we
[02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:34.840]  salute you we're all in this together brother yeah we are and it's you know and thanks for
[02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:39.800]  the great uh interview with roger there he pointed out some great information
[02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:47.080]  on mccarthy and what's going on behind the scenes uh he definitely you know he what stone said about
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:52.120]  him being propped up by lobbyist and maybe somebody else i don't know who but you know
[02:23:52.120 --> 02:23:57.000]  that the people that want to run our government into the ground are who are trying to prop mccarthy
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:03.320]  up and yeah i mean clearly at this point if you're kev mccarthy and you're in it for your own reasons
[02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:07.720]  right and you're your own man and maybe you wanted that seat for for whatever reasons you really wanted
[02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:15.240]  that seat but after taking i mean three losses you think would be enough seven though after seven
[02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:21.080]  he still won't step aside that tells you that he's somebody else is telling him no you're not done
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:27.080]  right they're propping him up and he's spineless see everybody knows it just like mcconnell they're
[02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:33.400]  pathetic they need to get out of the way and but i'm i predict that just like you're saying that
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:37.960]  nothing is going to change they're going to keep ramming him up they're standing him up and and
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:44.200]  letting him be the pinocchio or the punching bag until they go oh he won he magically won just like
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:49.480]  biden magically won just like all these bums that they keep throwing at us and telling them
[02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:55.320]  oh they won no they didn't stop lying well they might think that that's going to be the case but
[02:24:56.040 --> 02:25:00.440]  in their arrogance and they're used to just ramming home whatever they want is their will
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:05.080]  and us just taking it i don't think that's going to be the case this time i'm i'm really sitting
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:08.280]  here thinking that's not going to be the case but you're right they may just never stop i mean
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:12.840]  this thing could go on forever potentially and i'm okay with that fine shut it all down
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:16.680]  and brad thank you for the call and all the support and you know here's the interesting thing
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:23.240]  because let's go back in time a little bit to just ahead of the midterm elections or or even just
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:29.480]  after where we're scratching our head where's the red wave how after this disastrous biden
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:34.760]  administration did republicans not have huge victories across the board forget about whatever
[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:40.920]  we think about the integrity of elections that's what we're saying how can the republican party
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:45.000]  not be more effective against this biden administration how could the republicans not
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:50.360]  have had more victories in the midterms after this disastrous administration and we ideed the
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:58.760]  problems it was the republican leadership of the mic leadership mccarthy mcconnell and mcdaniel
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:06.600]  well the the establishment neocons forced mcconnell and mcdaniel back down our throats
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:11.640]  so we're just trying to get rid of one of the problems here and so that's what this is all about
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:19.240]  mcconnell mccarthy and mcdaniel have failed this country they have failed the republican voters
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:25.000]  they have failed themselves but apparently they don't care about failure they're like democrats
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:30.680]  they must be democrats because they somehow fail up but no we identified the problems
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:35.560]  and that was the mic leadership of the republican party so yeah getting one of those mic leaders
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:40.760]  out of the leadership role is exactly what we need to do i wish we could get three but
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:48.280]  right now it's only one that we can get so it continues let's go to paris in arizona paris
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:54.840]  you're on the air go ahead happy new year oh and i hope you had a good time off with your
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:27:01.560]  family this past holiday thank you so i have to do a quick plug real quick for you with vitamin
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:06.680]  mineral fusion i was stage i was diagnosed with stage three kidney failure about three years ago
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:13.480]  and um i started taking vitamin or fusion and everything started to change right now no longer
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:19.800]  in kidney failure and i owe it all to your products and info wars thank you wow that's amazing thank
[02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:27.880]  you i'm glad to hear that so you know alex always says you can judge a person by their enemies
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:33.720]  and right now margie taylor green she has all the right enemies for me i really want to hear
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:41.160]  her reasoning behind um endorsing kevin mccarthy and where's trump where's donald trump he hasn't
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:47.080]  said anything in the last few days with this with this vote going on in the house and you know let me
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:51.960]  let me just pause you right there and and try to address this situation folks i i said to the couple
[02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:57.240]  weeks ago i'm not trying to be i i still support trump i still i'm i'm rooting for the trump
[02:27:57.240 --> 02:28:03.720]  redemption tour here or revenge tour if you will but he's he's he's flatline politically his campaign
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:09.240]  is flatline he's reeling right now because he doesn't get the attention he wants he's not getting
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:16.760]  any of the results with the things that he's asking for or or expressing desire for so i mean look
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:23.000]  donald trump can either read the room and get on board with what the voters of donald trump want
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:27.880]  or he can continue to flop and flail around with his political campaign that to me is flatlining
[02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:35.000]  right now i think the trump train is finally dying unfortunately i voted for him i still support him
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:39.720]  but right now he really needs to speak out about the person he's endorsing that's what eight times
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:45.560]  now that being said to know to the office having to be kicked out of the speaker's office for being
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:50.040]  a squatter and i would say normally i would say he should probably say nothing but the fact he
[02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:54.360]  already put his voice out there and supported mccarthy you'd think he'd want to have some sort of
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:59.960]  follow-up to save face but nothing yet you want to beat the new world order you want to stop their
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:05.720]  globalist agenda well so do i and i've been the most affected individual in the fight against the

[02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:35.320]  in the info wars world headquarters in austin texas we are covering the house speaker vote
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:42.600]  and taking calls on it the eighth vote is going to be underway shortly and i suspect
[02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:48.280]  nothing will change and they'll probably do it for a ninth time and then resume the exact same thing
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:54.360]  tomorrow again though the good news today let me just mention this right now
[02:34:55.720 --> 02:35:03.960]  bill's safety demar hamlin is starting to show signs of life again moving his eyes moving some
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:12.760]  of his extremities but in in lieu of that the mainstream establishment media is coming out
[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:18.440]  and reinforcing that this has nothing to do with a vaccine but i'll tell you this folks
[02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:28.760]  there is uh this is a no-win situation here because i don't know how you tiptoe around this issue you
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:35.320]  can ignore the vaccine as a potential problem and a factor in this and i expect that they will
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:42.840]  continue to do that so then what are you doing well you're now sacrificing that what is to be
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:51.880]  considered a routine hit in the nfl could be potentially fatal so that's the conclusion
[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:56.600]  they're going to have to reach and land on since they're going to ignore the potential factor of
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:03.480]  the vaccine here but i really think this debate has just begun and so at just as this good news
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:10.360]  is coming out about hamlin of course the mainstream media that promoted these deadly vaccines is all
[02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:14.920]  over this saying it had nothing to do with the vaccine don't talk about the vaccine it was the
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:22.600]  comatocortis that caused this which i i still believe it was the the hit that caused the cardiac
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:29.960]  event but if he was vaccinated there is no doubt that the vaccine probably made this event much
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:36.440]  worse and that's why it's such a rare thing that we hadn't seen with a common hit like that that has
[02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:43.080]  happened probably millions of times since nfl football has been played why this time did it
[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:49.160]  happen is it because of the vaccine or is it really just a one in a billion shot there so they're
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:54.840]  going to ignore the vaccine is a potential factor and then they're not going to want to have the
[02:36:54.840 --> 02:37:02.840]  true reckoning moment which is okay so you have just submitted that a common nfl hit which again to
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:10.920]  reiterate folks a common nfl hit is extremely violent if you're ever on an nfl sideline every
[02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:18.760]  play sounds like a car crash okay so yes common hits in the nfl are extremely violent but having
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:26.120]  said that you don't see routine hits like that as violent as they may be causing cardiac arrest
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:32.600]  so how is the nfl going to try to thread this needle and are the players going to be silent
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:38.680]  is all the media going to be complicit are we just going to have to sit here and unspokenly
[02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:43.880]  just to just have an unspoken agreement that okay well now common nfl hits can result in
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:51.080]  heart attacks and maybe death and so play ball or is there going to be somebody that steps up
[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:58.280]  and tries to change that conversation that has enough willpower and gravitas to do so
[02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:05.640]  but what do you think about this the george floyd gofundme fundraiser raised over 40 million
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:13.000]  dollars the damar hamland gofundme fundraiser has raised just shy of seven million dollars think about
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:23.160]  that what you want but figured we'd share that with you but as the signs of life start to return
[02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:29.880]  to hamlin the media is running overtime to tell you it had nothing to do with the vaccine all right
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:35.160]  let's go back to the phone lines and we've got owl killer in virginia owl killer you're on the
[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:43.000]  air go ahead hey oh and so i want to hit on the mccarthy thing but you know with roger bringing
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:51.800]  up that jeb bush was that um governor santa says inauguration hey look you are you myself alex we
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:57.080]  support a truck i still have the trump the signs without tense on them i still have them i was one
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:01.720]  of his earliest supporters but this guy brought balton all those loser generals that never won a
[02:39:01.720 --> 02:39:09.320]  war in their life talking about uh the sombrero war they're over the century so and probably one of
[02:39:09.320 --> 02:39:15.160]  the worst judges of characters so and then you got mccarthy on the world economic forum on their page
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:21.480]  as already the speaker of the house so what trump needs to do if he wants to get back if he wants us
[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:25.720]  to support him you better call out the world economic forum because the santa is doing it
[02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:30.840]  he has done it i haven't heard trump open his mouth once about it if he said his first treat uh
[02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:37.080]  tweet was about the world economic forum it would change the world in 30 seconds um on the marjorie
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:42.760]  teller green side of things hey look i don't know if you remember but jeff sessions was
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:49.800]  captain america in the senate all right he brought up globalism he brought up um the fact that the
[02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:54.920]  leon panetta when he was secretary of defense was trying to deploy our troops under under
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:40:01.720]  u n charter and when he became the the attorney general the guy was emasculated so something
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:05.800]  happened with marjorie teller green hey look i don't care about her personal life but she's
[02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:09.640]  got to own whatever it is so they can't hold it over her head that's pretty much all i have to say
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:15.160]  thanks for the call alkyler and you know just to kind of go back in time with you for a minute i
[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:23.320]  remember you know steve bannon was one of trump's original advisors when he was president
[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:29.480]  and when he got fired i think he was officially fired i don't remember if he resigned or he was
[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:35.000]  fired but i think it was maybe a mutual thing but i remember when that happened he came out
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:41.720]  and made a public statement saying trumpism is dead i never forgot that and i think maybe we
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:45.640]  have a better idea of what that meant now getting to the issue of what you talked about trump being
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:52.120]  a bad judge of character i think it's a fair statement i think that he proved that at least
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:57.880]  whether it was a mistake or whether he's learned from it we may not know but yeah absolutely some
[02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:01.640]  of the appointments and decisions he made with people bringing in to help him in his
[02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:09.480]  first four years as president were not good decisions maybe he learned better uh maybe not
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:14.600]  but again going back to this jeb bush thing look i don't really take much out of it i don't
[02:41:15.720 --> 02:41:20.920]  i don't think the bushes controlled the santus and if anything maybe the bushes and the republican
[02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:26.200]  establishment are trying to cozy up with the santus right now because they want to put him under
[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:33.480]  their wing or they want us to be turned off from him so they throw jeb bush out there so that you
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:39.560]  see it and you say oh no i don't want to santus i'm not really taking much from that quite frankly
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:44.360]  i'm looking at what the santus is doing and saying and i continue to like it and if the bushes start
[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:48.040]  to hang around that's not going to change really how i feel about him or the bushes
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:55.240]  but uh people are mentioning that and it's been brought up a couple times now so figured we'd
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:42:01.560]  uh briefly mention that all right we're gonna we're gonna come back here and continue to take
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:06.760]  calls for another segment ahead of paul joseph watson taking over and then i will be back hosting
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:14.600]  the war room continuing to take calls and the eighth vote is it's pretty much concluded uh
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:19.480]  it's well it's not officially concluded yet but it's going exactly how we thought it would go
[02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:26.360]  and mccarthy is about to be handed his eighth loss so this is just completely embarrassing
[02:42:28.360 --> 02:42:33.320]  you know the uh the candy bar costs ten dollars or whatever and you've only got five and you keep
[02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:37.400]  trying to pay with five dollars but you don't have ten and so it's just how many times are you
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:43.880]  going to do that well eight times is the answer now so will we have nine will kevin mccarthy go
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:49.320]  oh for nine and why won't he just step aside why won't he spare himself the embarrassment
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:53.560]  maybe he's not the one in control we'll take more calls on the other side don't go anywhere
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:03.000]  there is a war on for your mind your mind is a battlefield this is an information war

[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:56.520]  real quick this is ivan everybody how you guys doing um oh and i want to talk to you about this
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:49:03.000]  mccarty deal um just so you know the longest boat ever was 133 boats over two months for speaker
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:08.920]  the house so we're just getting started there is that was that was that like the 1865 yeah that's
[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:13.720]  right yeah 18 so we haven't the bottom yet these guys they don't have a bottle all right there is no
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:20.440]  honor in politicians and there was a democrats then too it always is it always is um but the thing
[02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:25.400]  i want to bring up oan and i i love you a deaf man you know plug an x2 by the way in the middle but uh
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:33.880]  uh you have an unfailing um white pill inside of you i'll say maybe maybe i'm black tilled maybe
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:38.840]  you're more realistic maybe i'm less realistic but there is something called controlled opposition
[02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:44.360]  i know you know about this and in venezuela is the perfect example of it and they have people
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:49.400]  who are like venezuela first who speak out against maintain their role in government
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:55.400]  they get money from the opposition and it's it's sort of a pretty a similarity to what we're seeing
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:50:01.000]  here with some of these people i'm not saying marjorie taylor got fdx money from mccarty i mean
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:07.720]  we know mccarty got it but i we don't know okay that's the thing we get paid lip service we digest it
[02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:12.200]  and if we like what they say we kind of go with so i don't know where we're going to end up with this
[02:50:12.200 --> 02:50:17.480]  but it is good to see some pushback finally in congress to what end it'll come out to i don't
[02:50:17.480 --> 02:50:22.840]  know i just don't feel like we're going to get one of our people quote unquote in there we're
[02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:29.960]  going to end up with another deep state pat well i understand the concern there i don't think
[02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:35.320]  brian donald's is controlled opposition or deep state or anything like that uh i don't think matt
[02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:40.920]  gates is so but will those guys get into the position i'm saying they might not be but will
[02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:45.480]  they okay well i see what you're saying with that well well that the time will only tell with that
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:50.680]  but but even the holdouts remaining consistent as they have for now the eighth time mccarthy loses
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:56.600]  again um then then that'll be enough at least to keep the the deep state uh operative that i
[02:50:56.600 --> 02:51:02.200]  believe kevin mccarthy is out of that position or whether he's that or not he's he's a failed leader
[02:51:02.200 --> 02:51:08.360]  i mean again we identified the failed republican leaders mcdaniel mccarthy and mcconnell and if
[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:12.520]  we can at least get rid of one of them that'll be good moving forward and thank you for the call
[02:51:12.520 --> 02:51:19.800]  skylare and just to address the other thing you know here's what it is folks i when i'm
[02:51:21.480 --> 02:51:27.800]  spending all these hours reading the news covering the news listening to our lying politicians day
[02:51:27.800 --> 02:51:33.080]  after day listening to our lying media day after day it it is a black pill thing it's like a how
[02:51:33.080 --> 02:51:37.800]  can this be so bad how can it be so corrupt how do we recover from this this is just straight evil
[02:51:37.800 --> 02:51:43.720]  and i won't even get off into the the lies about wars or the trans kids all the other stuff but
[02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:49.320]  when i get away from it and when i'm spending time with friends and with family or i'm i'm
[02:51:49.320 --> 02:51:55.000]  having a good time out at dinner or maybe out on the golf course or a ball game life is beautiful
[02:51:55.000 --> 02:52:01.800]  life life is such a gift and and so that's kind of the paradox it's like this is all real this will
[02:52:01.800 --> 02:52:07.640]  determine the fate of humanity in the future of america it's important it should impact us
[02:52:08.280 --> 02:52:12.360]  but i mean at what point do you say hey you know there's a whole other world out there for me to
[02:52:12.360 --> 02:52:17.480]  go enjoy i don't want to completely forget about that i don't want to completely remove myself from
[02:52:17.480 --> 02:52:22.760]  that i need that i want that i want to appreciate that but it's also realizing that you could lose
[02:52:22.760 --> 02:52:28.280]  that if we don't save the country if we don't save humanity so it's a bit of a paradox but no i mean
[02:52:28.280 --> 02:52:34.040]  i'm a lover of life man i mean i love music i love art i love culture i love human endeavor
[02:52:34.040 --> 02:52:40.280]  and accomplishment and excellence so it's like it's a weird thing it's like yeah the best of both
[02:52:40.280 --> 02:52:44.040]  worlds right it's the best of times it's the worst of times i'll stop right there but since you
[02:52:44.040 --> 02:52:51.480]  brought it up let's go to let's go to marvin in alabama marvin you're on the air go ahead
[02:52:51.480 --> 02:52:59.160]  hey oh i'm good to talk to you hey uh with uh matt gates throwing trump's name out there um it
[02:52:59.160 --> 02:53:05.800]  kind of makes me realize a lot of people are are blaming mtg for for uh you know supporting
[02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:11.320]  mccarthy but she's only doing that because trump asked her to now whether or not they have some kind
[02:53:11.320 --> 02:53:17.880]  of scheme or plan to get his name into the hat i don't know but i would caution people about
[02:53:17.880 --> 02:53:24.600]  being careful what they wish for because if trump gets uh gets that that seat you're never going to
[02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:30.520]  see an investigation into the vaccine ever i mean how can he investigate something he played a role
[02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:36.040]  in and people don't they don't want to use logic when it comes to this so like right now if we could
[02:53:36.040 --> 02:53:41.080]  if we could investigate you know falchi and biden would the boat stop at falchi and we would say
[02:53:41.080 --> 02:53:47.000]  oh that's high enough or would we say no well now let me let me i think that i think the situation
[02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:53.960]  here would be you're not going to get an investigation into the vaccines from the house what you might get
[02:53:55.640 --> 02:54:02.200]  in that fashion is some form of an investigation into what happened at twitter and then the censorship
[02:54:02.920 --> 02:54:10.360]  of certain stories or certain words or phrases or maybe even medicines that could have been treated
[02:54:10.360 --> 02:54:16.280]  could have been used to treat covet i don't expect the big investigation that'll bring down the vaccine
[02:54:16.280 --> 02:54:20.040]  controversy to come from the house that's going to come from grand juries that's going to come from
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:26.840]  lawsuits so i don't really think that comes into play with trump as a speaker i think the trump
[02:54:26.840 --> 02:54:33.960]  as a speaker thing is kind of a ridiculous pipe dream quite frankly but um matt gates did throw
[02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:38.920]  the name out there maybe just as a jest or as a troll certainly marjorie taylor green got a kick
[02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:44.280]  out of it she was she was laughing about that for about a minute afterwards but uh i i don't think
[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:49.080]  the investigation into the vaccines is what we're not going to get what we want from the house that's
[02:54:49.080 --> 02:54:54.920]  going to have to come from grand juries and other lawsuits or or even action from states like in
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:55:00.040]  florida so i wouldn't i wouldn't think too much about trump being speaker and i wouldn't think
[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:04.520]  too much about having a house investigation to expose what's going on with the vaccines maybe
[02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:09.320]  with the censorship and stuff with twitter maybe into fouchy but overall i don't think that's where
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:17.320]  it goes all right let's go to robin in georgia robin you're on the air go ahead oh and um this
[02:55:17.320 --> 02:55:23.160]  actually piggybacks off the last caller um i think you're wrong about that and with my idea
[02:55:23.160 --> 02:55:28.120]  but just try to think this through i was so angry at you monday i swear i was never going to list
[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:34.760]  you again you're my favorite talk show host but i am i got over it but just think this through
[02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:43.480]  through what if someone nominated i don't know someone who had a big uh vendetta against the
[02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:51.640]  cdc the fda the nih and possibly a vendetta or not necessarily a vendetta but knows that those
[02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:56.520]  agencies have to be cleaned out they know they have to be cleaned up what donald trump should
[02:55:56.520 --> 02:56:02.520]  have done and who would that one person that person has a d in front of his name and i cannot
[02:56:02.520 --> 02:56:08.440]  i'm more conservative than you are i cannot even believe i'm going to suggest this robert kennedy
[02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:16.920]  junior and robert barnes can actually you know i'd love to know his idea about him running for
[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:22.760]  her office which but he's the one person i i've never really been interested in the kennedy's
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:29.000]  but i was at a workshop a couple of months ago and i heard him speak several times that guy
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:33.720]  i walked the walk let me just let me just stop you right there because i don't want to go off on
[02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:37.560]  a vaccine issue and i'm just curious i'm just curious what what was it that i said monday
[02:56:37.560 --> 02:56:43.400]  that upset you so much oh i was upset over the football thing i i might my i have a daughter
[02:56:43.400 --> 02:56:49.400]  who dates an ex nfl football quarterback so i watch a lot of it trust me my husband is in
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:53.080]  front of that tv i've seen a lot of football i've seen a lot of football from the sidelines
[02:56:54.440 --> 02:56:58.600]  and you and i will disagree about that but you are one of those people and i'll have to say
[02:56:58.600 --> 02:57:05.080]  you're like robert kennedy junior kathryn awson fitz describes him as there's only a few men in
[02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:12.600]  america that can navigate the refiner's fire that means you can take the heat well i i appreciate
[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:17.080]  that and i knew that upset a lot of people and i stuck to my guns on that issue it's still open
[02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:22.920]  minded to it and i'm glad you've you've decided to tune in to me again that it wasn't a a deal breaker
[02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:29.000]  um as far as the speaker the house thing is concerned it's just robert f kennedy junior's
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:37.880]  not going to be the speaker of the house and so i i i would just say the issue with the vaccines
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:42.600]  causing all the deaths and illness it's not going to be resolved via the house it's going to come
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:50.680]  from grand juries or maybe governors you want to beat the new world order you want to stop their
[02:57:50.680 --> 02:57:56.360]  globalist agenda well so do i and i've been the most affected individual in the fight against

[02:59:55.080 --> 03:00:03.800]  take the highway to the end of the night
[03:00:05.320 --> 03:00:10.520]  end of the night end of the night
[03:00:10.520 --> 03:00:31.800]  this video is based on the work of mark passio from what on earth is happening dot com
[03:00:31.800 --> 03:00:40.360]  specifically his recent video on de facto satanism today's hollywood pop culture machine
[03:00:40.360 --> 03:00:47.560]  will have you believe that satanists wear robes and practice ritualistic blood sacrifices
[03:00:47.560 --> 03:00:54.760]  while worshiping satan and while there may be some truth to this it is mostly propaganda meant to
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:01:03.160]  conceal the reality of what satanism actually is true satanism is a mindset and the satan that is
[03:01:03.160 --> 03:01:10.920]  worshiped is within each and every one of us it is most commonly known as our ego the self is the
[03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:19.000]  true god of satanism the term satanism is used to deceive religious people to appear harmless to
[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:27.320]  non-religious people and also because it stems from the Hebrew word shatan which means adversary
[03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:35.400]  satan is the force of involution that opposes true spiritual evolution it is the ego within us
[03:01:36.040 --> 03:01:42.680]  left to our own devices the ego will try and convince us to think only of ourselves which
[03:01:42.680 --> 03:01:51.000]  is exactly what satanism is and so a de facto satanist is a person who holds this mindset
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:58.840]  but does not consider themselves to be a satanist organized satanism stands against this sort of
[03:01:58.840 --> 03:02:05.400]  enlightenment they believe human psychology and the laws of nature should be kept occulted
[03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:12.440]  or hidden from the public and used to gain and retain power over the masses by keeping them
[03:02:12.440 --> 03:02:19.240]  ignorant as to how the mind and emotions work while using this knowledge to manipulate the masses
[03:02:19.240 --> 03:02:26.440]  and ultimately enslave them this is primarily done by cultivating the satanist mindset
[03:02:26.440 --> 03:02:34.440]  among the masses thereby turning the ignorant and unaware into a de facto satanist as we think
[03:02:34.440 --> 03:02:41.800]  so we become this mindset can be broken down into four main tenets of satanism the first
[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:49.960]  and most important is selfishness egotism or what many know as narcissism self-preservation
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:58.600]  is the highest law live only for your own selfish desires and only care about you and yours it's
[03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:05.960]  a dog eat dog world and if you must step on others to get what you want then so be it this is the
[03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:13.240]  basis of satanic thinking the second tenant of the satanist mindset is moral relativism this is
[03:03:13.240 --> 03:03:19.720]  the belief that there is no objective difference between right behavior and wrong behavior it is
[03:03:19.720 --> 03:03:26.600]  the belief that nobody is ever objectively right or wrong and that it's up to each individual person
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:32.840]  to decide for themselves what is right and what is wrong the third tenant of satanism
[03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:39.560]  is social Darwinism this is the belief that it is natural and good for human society to be ruled
[03:03:39.560 --> 03:03:46.680]  by the most aggressive and dominant humans among us and that it is by virtue of their genetics
[03:03:46.680 --> 03:03:53.880]  that these vicious humans deserve to be in positions of power and lead humanity as they so
[03:03:53.880 --> 03:04:02.040]  choose the fourth tenant of satanism is eugenics or dysgenics this is the ideal conclusion of the
[03:04:02.040 --> 03:04:09.800]  satanist mindset since man is god and he gets to decide what is right and what is wrong and since
[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:17.080]  the natural order is for the most dominant genetics to have power then the elite class ruling over us
[03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:24.840]  has every right to decide who is allowed to live and procreate and who must die this is how all of
[03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:31.720]  society is conditioned to think and this is how the high level satanists are leading all of humanity
[03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:39.560]  into slavery most of humanity is operating under this de facto satanic mindset which is why it is
[03:04:39.560 --> 03:04:46.040]  called the great work to change it the great work is the work of awakening the masses to the true
[03:04:46.040 --> 03:04:53.480]  nature of the ego mind encouraging each and every individual to find the courage to face their own
[03:04:53.480 --> 03:05:02.760]  inner shadow and to practice natural law there's a war against our masculinity there's a war in
[03:05:02.760 --> 03:05:08.840]  the environment the food the water the air the electromagnetics the injections to really cut
[03:05:08.840 --> 03:05:15.960]  us off from what god designed us to be but through mother nature the creator gave us compounds
[03:05:16.600 --> 03:05:21.480]  that can counteract what the globalists have done and i gotta tell you all our supplements

[03:07:32.600 --> 03:07:38.280]  does not stop transmission of the virus there's absolutely no justification even under their
[03:07:38.280 --> 03:07:42.680]  own warped narrative to stop people coming into the country who haven't had it but they're just
[03:07:42.680 --> 03:07:48.520]  going to do it anyway because again it's a tool of population control and speaking of population
[03:07:48.520 --> 03:07:56.760]  control as predicted the national health service here in britain the state taxpayer funded health
[03:07:56.760 --> 03:08:03.960]  service is once again in crisis it's in crisis every single winter but as we predicted they've
[03:08:03.960 --> 03:08:11.160]  decided to weaponize to exploit this annual crisis to call yes for the reintroduction of covid
[03:08:11.160 --> 03:08:17.240]  restrictions once again despite the fact that they've been proven spectacularly wrong on the
[03:08:17.240 --> 03:08:23.880]  lockdowns on the vaccine mandates on the masks they're trying to bring it all back in lockdown
[03:08:23.880 --> 03:08:30.360]  skeptics or daily skeptic dot org reports government ministers draw up plans for social
[03:08:30.360 --> 03:08:37.720]  distancing face masks and work from home to save the nhs the envy of the world which is in a near
[03:08:37.720 --> 03:08:42.760]  state of collapse every single year despite the fact that it gets increased funding from the
[03:08:42.760 --> 03:08:47.640]  government and the taxpayer year after year after year of course many of the same people
[03:08:47.640 --> 03:08:53.160]  campaigning for the nhs to be given even more resources will simultaneously campaign for this
[03:08:53.160 --> 03:09:01.240]  country to import now over a million new people every single year 1.1 million new immigrants
[03:09:01.240 --> 03:09:09.480]  into britain from the year june 2021 to june 2022 in addition we have the bolt migrants 45
[03:09:09.480 --> 03:09:15.560]  000 of them arriving in the country over the last year it all places a massive strain on public
[03:09:15.560 --> 03:09:20.760]  services which are already stretched to breaking point but for some reason that's just not within
[03:09:20.760 --> 03:09:27.080]  the bounds of feasibility of leftis who constantly whine about the nhs being stretched to breaking
[03:09:27.080 --> 03:09:33.800]  point yet well on the same token campaign for the country to import millions of net new people
[03:09:33.800 --> 03:09:40.600]  every single year to put more strain more burden on the nhs so every single winter it's in a near
[03:09:40.600 --> 03:09:48.440]  state of collapse emergencies declared at hospitals ambulance waiting times hours in some cases days
[03:09:49.560 --> 03:09:55.400]  imagine that the envy of the world the nhs you call the nhs to get an ambulance literally elderly
[03:09:55.400 --> 03:10:01.960]  people who've had serious accidents can i get an ambulance yeah maybe in a couple of days
[03:10:01.960 --> 03:10:07.640]  that's the envy of the world the nhs but it's so great it's such a religious institution
[03:10:07.640 --> 03:10:14.760]  that we need to give up all our rights to protect it once again mask wearing social distancing and
[03:10:14.760 --> 03:10:20.280]  working from home again paying people furlough from the government to sit on their arses and
[03:10:20.280 --> 03:10:26.360]  do nothing because they have long covid or some other made-up illness could be introduced by ministers
[03:10:26.360 --> 03:10:33.480]  to ease pressures on the nhs so the nhs is facing record winter pressures due to rising
[03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:39.560]  rates of covid okay the covid infections according to the official government dashboard are down
[03:10:39.560 --> 03:10:46.360]  from what they were three weeks ago and flu which of course none of us have any immunity anymore or
[03:10:46.360 --> 03:10:51.080]  the people who took the vaccine and wore their masks don't have any immunity to any many more
[03:10:51.080 --> 03:10:55.640]  because their immune system is shot to pieces because for the last three years they haven't
[03:10:55.640 --> 03:11:03.160]  exposed themselves naturally to any commonly circulating viruses so now flu which miraculously
[03:11:03.160 --> 03:11:08.040]  disappeared they told us during the covid era despite much of the covid infections actually
[03:11:08.040 --> 03:11:15.080]  being flu is now back with a bang and it's filling up hospitals apparently if you believe them remember
[03:11:15.080 --> 03:11:21.800]  the uh overflowing hospitals during the covid lockdowns so overflowing the nurses and doctors
[03:11:21.800 --> 03:11:25.960]  across the length and breadth of the country had all the time in the world to perfect their
[03:11:25.960 --> 03:11:30.920]  tiktok dance routines yes those overcrowded hospitals but apparently now they are overcrowded
[03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:36.360]  and it's no surprise because of course we've had thousands tens of thousands of people with
[03:11:36.360 --> 03:11:43.480]  untreated illnesses because of lockdown now facing even more serious health situations
[03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:48.760]  unable to get treatment flu is apparently raging through a population because no one's got natural
[03:11:48.760 --> 03:11:54.600]  immunity and the hospitals are once again at a risk of collapse you add to that millions of
[03:11:54.600 --> 03:12:01.160]  new migrants putting more pressure on local gps doctors officers and surgeries and it's a toxic
[03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:10.120]  combination but don't worry they've got a solution the solution to save the nhs from collapse to
[03:12:10.120 --> 03:12:20.040]  apparently empty out all the you wearing a filthy face mask on a boss or you wearing a filthy face
[03:12:20.040 --> 03:12:27.240]  mask when you go to asda our equivalent of walmart to buy a carton of milk yes that's gonna solve it
[03:12:27.240 --> 03:12:34.280]  despite the fact that there's literally zero evidence or any study that says face masks work
[03:12:34.280 --> 03:12:40.680]  in preventing reducing the transmission of covid the government's own report the uk government
[03:12:40.680 --> 03:12:45.720]  commissioned and its own report into whether face masks in schools reduced the transmission of
[03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:52.200]  covid they couldn't find any evidence in their own report that they did the dan mask study out of
[03:12:52.200 --> 03:12:58.280]  denmark found no appreciable evidence that they reduced the transmission of covid doesn't matter
[03:12:58.280 --> 03:13:07.480]  it's a tool of population control these technocrats these government uh bureau bureau uh quangos who
[03:13:07.480 --> 03:13:13.160]  were advising the government bureaucrats back at the start remember we talked about totalitarian
[03:13:13.160 --> 03:13:20.280]  methods of mind control that they deliberately used behavioral psychology weaponized to exaggerate
[03:13:20.280 --> 03:13:28.680]  the risk of covid because the population wasn't heeding the restrictions people were acting out
[03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:35.080]  people were not sufficiently obeying the orders so they said we have to exaggerate the virus we
[03:13:35.080 --> 03:13:43.080]  have to create a tool of population control that the public is forced to wear so the slaves can
[03:13:43.080 --> 03:13:48.440]  remind the other slaves that they're in a perma pandemic and that's what the face masks were
[03:13:48.440 --> 03:13:55.400]  all about so now they're talking about because the nhs is at risk of collapse the government is
[03:13:55.400 --> 03:14:01.560]  potentially going to advise people to start wearing face masks again on public transport
[03:14:01.560 --> 03:14:06.600]  bearing in mind we haven't had any of these face mask mandates for over a year now and they're
[03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:11.480]  going to start to advise them to wear them in different settings of course we know that advice
[03:14:11.480 --> 03:14:19.080]  turns into mandates within a very short space of time peter hitchhens mail online writes wear
[03:14:19.080 --> 03:14:25.560]  a mask if you want but understand it's about fear and control not health the climate for their return
[03:14:25.560 --> 03:14:32.680]  is a triumph of unreason and a blow to science and he goes through the early stages of the pandemic
[03:14:32.680 --> 03:14:39.240]  when even the much-vaunted health officials the world health organization and others came out
[03:14:39.240 --> 03:14:44.920]  and said and this was in the fouchy emails as well face masks don't work not only do they not work
[03:14:44.920 --> 03:14:50.440]  they could make it worse because the virus gets trapped in the mask because people keep touching
[03:14:50.440 --> 03:14:57.560]  their masks they're filthy they're petri dishes for the virus he points out the mighty and
[03:14:57.560 --> 03:15:03.240]  revered world health organization as the great covert fear was getting into its stride on march
[03:15:03.240 --> 03:15:09.960]  31st 2020 the executive director of the WHO health emergencies program mike ryan spoke on the issue
[03:15:09.960 --> 03:15:17.640]  he said quote this is WHO 2020 there is no specific evidence to suggest the wearing of masks by the
[03:15:17.640 --> 03:15:24.120]  mass population as any potential benefit in fact there's evidence to suggest the opposite in the
[03:15:24.120 --> 03:15:30.280]  misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly and he goes through other examples that
[03:15:30.280 --> 03:15:35.000]  i'm going to touch upon a few in the next segment of all the top health professionals the world
[03:15:35.880 --> 03:15:41.720]  covert experts saying don't encourage face masks don't advise the population to wear them
[03:15:41.720 --> 03:15:46.280]  because they have no effect and they could even make the spread worse that narrative
[03:15:46.840 --> 03:15:52.360]  changed in a hurry didn't it it's been recycled debunked and yet they're bringing it back once

[03:20:02.200 --> 03:20:21.560]  order it's alex jones live from the summit dot news headquarters it's paul joseph watson
[03:20:24.760 --> 03:20:30.120]  so they're dragging the mask mandate narrative back out of the gutter despite the fact that it's
[03:20:30.120 --> 03:20:35.160]  been debunked it was never even proved in the first place that face masks had any effect on
[03:20:35.160 --> 03:20:40.760]  stopping the transmission of coveted was a tool of population control i'm going to go into more
[03:20:40.760 --> 03:20:46.920]  of the origins of that but first let's go to this video because netflix had a big special
[03:20:46.920 --> 03:20:51.560]  movie over the christmas and new year period heavily promoted this was number one trending
[03:20:51.560 --> 03:20:56.920]  on netflix and still is today as far as i can tell has been for the last couple of weeks now
[03:20:56.920 --> 03:21:04.600]  now movie called glass onion and it's full of the woke pandering which i think ben Shapiro
[03:21:04.600 --> 03:21:10.840]  did a 17 tweet thread about but what he didn't mention was the face mask propaganda the face
[03:21:10.840 --> 03:21:17.400]  mask social engineering that dominated the first 20 minutes of the entire movie and this is what
[03:21:17.400 --> 03:21:22.680]  this video is about it's called what on earth was this about let's roll the clip
[03:21:22.680 --> 03:21:28.600]  it's heavily promoted its new movie glass onion over christmas and while many savaged it for its
[03:21:28.600 --> 03:21:33.640]  woke pandering and spaceship man bad narrative there's another aspect where social engineering
[03:21:33.640 --> 03:21:38.440]  is very much on prominent display the first 20 minutes of the movie shows most of the characters
[03:21:38.440 --> 03:21:43.720]  mumbling through face masks they're also seen performing cringe social distancing greetings
[03:21:43.720 --> 03:21:51.560]  we can't hug right i mean can we of course the only people not wearing their masks are the men's
[03:21:51.560 --> 03:21:56.840]  rights advocates who run a conspiracy youtube channel while on the other hand the esteemed
[03:21:56.840 --> 03:22:02.200]  scientist character is diligently and properly masked up at all times and then there's a truly
[03:22:02.200 --> 03:22:07.320]  bizarre scene where ethan hawke walks on for a two-minute cameo then proceeds to ask each character
[03:22:07.320 --> 03:22:12.600]  to remove their face mask before using a spray gun to blast some kind of chemical in their mouth
[03:22:12.600 --> 03:22:18.920]  oh eight years of doing
[03:22:21.320 --> 03:22:25.240]  this then makes the characters safe from the virus and able to remove their masks for the
[03:22:25.240 --> 03:22:30.040]  rest of the movie speculation raged online as to whether the chemical was supposed to represent
[03:22:30.040 --> 03:22:34.920]  a vaccine or just a placebo but it doesn't really matter because it's never mentioned again you think
[03:22:34.920 --> 03:22:39.640]  that the scene had been inserted as some kind of plot device that the truth about why it happened
[03:22:39.640 --> 03:22:44.280]  would be revealed later on in the movie but now it's just bizarrely crowbarred into the film in
[03:22:44.280 --> 03:22:49.720]  complete isolation predictive programming or just cringe pandering to the new religion new be the
[03:22:49.720 --> 03:22:54.680]  judge but the demonization of the anti-mass characters as dangerously irresponsible was a
[03:22:54.680 --> 03:23:00.840]  deliberate plot device weaponized as a lazy trope to facilitate yet another reinforcement of the
[03:23:00.840 --> 03:23:08.120]  message so again it's interesting isn't it how a lot of the normies as part of this new
[03:23:08.120 --> 03:23:13.480]  covetian religion have refused to give up the face mask because they see it as some kind of high
[03:23:13.480 --> 03:23:20.200]  status symbol like oh you're not one of those dangerous idiotic thick anti-maskers are you
[03:23:20.200 --> 03:23:26.040]  they think it bestows on them some kind of intellectual superiority yet the funny thing
[03:23:26.040 --> 03:23:30.920]  is whenever you watch a goller whenever you watch an awards ceremony the ultra elite the
[03:23:30.920 --> 03:23:34.920]  celebrities walking through those they're not wearing masks are they no they don't have to wear
[03:23:34.920 --> 03:23:40.600]  them it's the pros it's the surfs that busy themselves around them and yet still the npc
[03:23:40.600 --> 03:23:45.880]  normies think it's some kind of high status symbol it's a tool of population control and as I was
[03:23:45.880 --> 03:23:51.240]  talking about in the first segment all the health professionals at the start before they got the memo
[03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:56.280]  admitted that masks don't work and they could in fact make it worse I quoted the world health
[03:23:56.280 --> 03:24:00.760]  organization official and in this article Peter Hitchens goes through the entire list
[03:24:00.760 --> 03:24:06.440]  again headline wear a mask if you want but understand it's about fear and control not health
[03:24:07.320 --> 03:24:12.760]  he quotes Dr Jenny Harris then a deputy chief medical officer here in the United Kingdom
[03:24:12.760 --> 03:24:18.200]  who said on March 12 2020 that people could be pointing themselves more at risk from contracting
[03:24:18.200 --> 03:24:23.720]  covid by wearing masks she said they could trap the virus and cause the person wearing it to breathe
[03:24:23.720 --> 03:24:29.480]  it in she said quote for the average member of the public walking down the street it's not a good idea
[03:24:29.480 --> 03:24:34.840]  deputy chief medical officer professor Jonathan van tam made similar comments
[03:24:35.720 --> 03:24:40.120]  he said he didn't believe health people should wear them didn't believe they'd reduce the
[03:24:40.120 --> 03:24:47.480]  spread of the disease isabel oakshot the spectator magazine who co-authored our former health secretary
[03:24:47.480 --> 03:24:54.920]  Matt Hancock's covid memoir recently said that Hancock our health secretary basically
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:25:00.360]  are equivalent of Fauci at the time and other people in the government knew full well that
[03:25:00.360 --> 03:25:06.760]  non-medical masks do little very little to prevent the transmission of virus but again
[03:25:06.760 --> 03:25:13.000]  they were a tool of population control a symbol to remind the public that they're in a health
[03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:20.520]  emergency and that they need to obey and of course then you had the demonization vilification
[03:25:20.520 --> 03:25:26.360]  denigration of others who didn't wear the face masks creating that deliberate polarization
[03:25:27.320 --> 03:25:33.000]  so the prisoners would act as wardens towards the other prisoners and that's what we saw
[03:25:33.560 --> 03:25:38.200]  especially in America more so in the UK but we definitely saw some of that in the UK too
[03:25:39.400 --> 03:25:46.680]  meanwhile hospitals overrun apparently you know NHS underfunded understaffed
[03:25:46.680 --> 03:25:53.080]  why is that is it simply because of covid well no i looked at the official covid stats for the past
[03:25:53.080 --> 03:26:01.240]  four weeks covid infections are down covid deaths are down you know what isn't down non-covid
[03:26:01.240 --> 03:26:09.960]  excess deaths continue to soar nothing to do with the 100% safe and effective you understand
[03:26:09.960 --> 03:26:18.200]  again this is out the daily skeptic excess non-covid deaths surged to 30 000 since april
[03:26:18.200 --> 03:26:24.200]  as deaths in week before christmas hit 20 above average listen to this deaths registered in
[03:26:24.200 --> 03:26:30.920]  england and wales were a massive 20.7 percent above the five-year average in the week ending
[03:26:30.920 --> 03:26:38.840]  december 23rd again what is this it's from illnesses arising out of the fight that everyone's
[03:26:38.840 --> 03:26:43.880]  immune system is shot to pieces because of all the vaccines because they weren't exposed to viruses
[03:26:43.880 --> 03:26:49.240]  over the past three years they have no natural immunity it's because of the non-treatment of
[03:26:49.240 --> 03:26:54.840]  serious illnesses over the past three years because people were told to stay away from hospitals
[03:26:54.840 --> 03:27:00.680]  during lockdown so all the nurses could perfect their tiktok dance routines and of course it's
[03:27:00.680 --> 03:27:09.160]  related to the vaccine there were a total of 14 530 deaths that week which is 2493 above the five
[03:27:09.160 --> 03:27:18.600]  year average of these 429 involve covid 19 308 were due to covid as underlying cause again
[03:27:18.600 --> 03:27:27.000]  that's nebulous within itself leaving 2185 excess non-covid deaths and again the influenza
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:34.200]  deaths were lower than that as well so the total number of excess non-covid deaths since the surge
[03:27:34.200 --> 03:27:41.960]  began these are deaths above the average non-covid related is now just shy of 30 000 again since
[03:27:41.960 --> 03:27:47.960]  april nobody's talking about the true cause of this they do in this article where a chart plots
[03:27:47.960 --> 03:27:54.200]  the deaths by date of occurrence against the date of vaccine boosters and there's a very
[03:27:54.200 --> 03:27:59.960]  interesting spike after the boosters were doled out again many of these excess deaths
[03:27:59.960 --> 03:28:08.680]  taking place in the over 75s not in people aged around 50 who were not targeted with the latest
[03:28:08.680 --> 03:28:13.800]  booster campaign they didn't tell people aged 50 or over to get it they told people aged over 75 to
[03:28:13.800 --> 03:28:22.840]  get it and the excess deaths are impacting them shockingly enough it says our excess deaths higher
[03:28:22.840 --> 03:28:27.160]  in the vaccinated the uk government like other governments does not publish good quality data
[03:28:27.160 --> 03:28:33.640]  on deaths by vaccination status she i wonder why however deaths during 2022 are notable for
[03:28:33.640 --> 03:28:37.080]  reversing the usual demographic trends and that's what we're going to get into on the other side
[03:28:37.080 --> 03:28:43.640]  because you would expect these excess deaths to impact the poorer non-white population of london
[03:28:43.640 --> 03:28:50.280]  which is also coincidentally less vaccinated but they haven't they've impacted people in better
[03:28:50.280 --> 03:28:53.640]  healthy with more vaccinated fascinating we'll be back some of the news are going

[03:33:36.360 --> 03:33:44.840]  it's paul joseph watson so these control freak technocrats here in the uk we have our own brand
[03:33:44.840 --> 03:33:50.520]  as you do in america who literally worship the communist chinese welding people in their homes
[03:33:50.520 --> 03:33:58.680]  the current equivalent of the treasury secretary the chancellor of the exchequer literally wanted
[03:33:58.680 --> 03:34:04.120]  people's children to be kidnapped if they were infected with covid and put in quarantine camps
[03:34:04.120 --> 03:34:11.720]  and separated from their parents jeremy hun that's who we're dealing with they worship the chinese
[03:34:11.720 --> 03:34:17.240]  they wanted to emulate their zero covid insanity which has now caused absolute chaos in china as
[03:34:17.240 --> 03:34:25.640]  we've seen and now those same people are exploiting this apparent bedlam in uk hospitals overcrowding
[03:34:25.640 --> 03:34:31.800]  underfunded understaffed elderly people wait in three hours to get an ambulance in some cases
[03:34:31.800 --> 03:34:37.160]  wait in two days to get an ambulance to take them to the hospital because there's a crisis
[03:34:38.280 --> 03:34:46.040]  those same people are now saying that all this is caused primarily by covid infections and flu
[03:34:46.040 --> 03:34:52.360]  infections it's not the covid infections the covid deaths have gone down over the past month i just
[03:34:52.360 --> 03:35:00.440]  looked earlier what hasn't gone down is the non-covid excess deaths which none of them will talk about
[03:35:00.440 --> 03:35:06.040]  because they don't want to get into the true causes of those excess deaths again i'm reading
[03:35:06.040 --> 03:35:13.400]  through this article at thedailyskeptic.org excess non-covid deaths surged to 30 000 since
[03:35:13.400 --> 03:35:19.000]  april and it makes the point nobody really knows the true cause of this but they have a very
[03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:23.480]  interesting interesting correlation with vaccine booster programs
[03:35:25.720 --> 03:35:31.080]  goes on to say the cause of the huge number of excess deaths in december is unclear
[03:35:31.800 --> 03:35:37.320]  detailed cause of death data are not yet available the excess deaths are concentrated in the older
[03:35:37.320 --> 03:35:45.160]  age groups with no noticeable rise in the under 50s who were notably excluded from the autumn
[03:35:45.160 --> 03:35:51.560]  booster campaign it's a severe flu season so this will be contributing again that's because no one
[03:35:51.560 --> 03:35:56.760]  has any immunity to it anymore the pressures on hospitals oh by the way they all took their flu
[03:35:56.760 --> 03:36:02.760]  jabs that worked out great for you didn't it now you've all got flu the pressures on hospitals
[03:36:02.760 --> 03:36:07.960]  ambulances and other health services will also be playing a part but it says once again the rise in
[03:36:07.960 --> 03:36:13.560]  excess non-covid deaths has occurred at the same time as the wave of covid infections this phenomenon
[03:36:13.560 --> 03:36:17.960]  has been observed internationally the reasons for it are unclear an interaction between the
[03:36:17.960 --> 03:36:22.680]  covid vaccines and covid infection perhaps resulting in deadly autoimmune attack on vital
[03:36:22.680 --> 03:36:29.240]  organs such as the heart or some other mechanism remains possible and they make the point in this
[03:36:29.240 --> 03:36:36.840]  article that these excess deaths non-covid are occurring in areas where there are more
[03:36:37.640 --> 03:36:44.840]  upwardly mobile white people in areas of the country like the southeast but not london
[03:36:45.560 --> 03:36:51.480]  where there is a greater non-white population which is more likely to be mired in poverty
[03:36:51.480 --> 03:36:58.200]  and more likely to suffer from ill health but those people those diverse populations ethnic
[03:36:58.200 --> 03:37:05.560]  minorities in london on suffering as much as white people in Surrey from these excess deaths
[03:37:06.520 --> 03:37:12.200]  what's the connection there well they didn't take the vaccine did they and this makes the point
[03:37:13.080 --> 03:37:18.600]  i'm not laughing to try and be crass about it but it's just absolutely unbelievable that this is
[03:37:18.600 --> 03:37:24.280]  now happening and we've got this massive sustained propaganda campaign to bring back the restrictions
[03:37:24.280 --> 03:37:30.200]  because there are flu deaths and more covid deaths in hospitals where these on these non-covid
[03:37:30.200 --> 03:37:35.000]  excess deaths are just not being talked about the true cause is not being revealed because it
[03:37:35.000 --> 03:37:39.960]  demolishes their entire narrative article goes on to say the most notable difference
[03:37:39.960 --> 03:37:43.880]  between these demographic groups that could explain such a remarkable shift is that whites
[03:37:43.880 --> 03:37:48.680]  and less deprived groups tend to have higher vaccination rates for example despite being
[03:37:48.680 --> 03:37:55.400]  more diverse and lower income london had much lower excess deaths than the southeast during
[03:37:55.400 --> 03:38:03.640]  2022 london had excess mortality of eight percent versus 13 percent in the southeast london is double
[03:38:03.640 --> 03:38:10.600]  jabbed 80 percent and triple jabbed 64 percent again the black population of london the ethnic
[03:38:10.600 --> 03:38:17.080]  minorities less likely to have taken the vaccine whereas in the southeast which is
[03:38:17.080 --> 03:38:23.560]  is greater wealth more white people not in london but in the surrounding counties they're double
[03:38:23.560 --> 03:38:30.600]  jabbed 90 percent and triple jabbed 80 percent and yet they're suffering most from the excess deaths
[03:38:31.160 --> 03:38:37.320]  the poorer ethnic minorities who had the vaccine less are not suffering as much from the excess
[03:38:37.320 --> 03:38:42.760]  deaths very interesting correlation there isn't it i'll leave it up to you to make your own conclusions
[03:38:42.760 --> 03:38:47.320]  we're going to come back and get more into this but first i want to go to this clip we're going to
[03:38:47.320 --> 03:38:53.320]  play about the first three minutes 30 of this this is called co-videons let's roll this clip
[03:39:00.840 --> 03:39:05.400]  the more things change the more they stay the same i will never regret the vaccine even if it
[03:39:05.400 --> 03:39:10.680]  turns out i injected actual poison and have only days to live my heart was in the right place i got
[03:39:10.680 --> 03:39:15.240]  vaccinated out of love while anti-vaxxers did everything out of hate if i have to die because
[03:39:15.240 --> 03:39:19.320]  of my love for the world then so be it but i will never regret or a push out for it
[03:39:20.920 --> 03:39:26.600]  serious jones town vibes i mean talk about a true believer this is a new religion
[03:39:26.600 --> 03:39:33.400]  this is acting like a religion yeah it's the dogmatic it's absolute it's if you do not believe
[03:39:33.400 --> 03:39:40.280]  in it you are condemned to hell it's you know maybe this is i mean it's maybe this is new religion
[03:39:40.280 --> 03:39:44.040]  while to see people posting endless videos of their packed new year's eat parties while
[03:39:44.040 --> 03:39:51.160]  emergency rooms are packed and doctors are rationing care yes it's 2023 three years later and after
[03:39:51.160 --> 03:39:57.160]  everything we've learned the co-videons still haven't gone away you should be wearing masks even
[03:39:57.160 --> 03:40:01.880]  when you are vaccinated if you are indoors crazy conspiracy theorists are claiming that
[03:40:01.880 --> 03:40:07.640]  covid jabs are fueling new covid variant crazy conspiracy theorists who work for checks notes
[03:40:07.640 --> 03:40:12.440]  the wall street journal growing evidence suggests that repeated vaccinations may make people more
[03:40:12.440 --> 03:40:17.880]  susceptible to xbb and could be fueling the virus's rapid evolution well whatever all obviously
[03:40:17.880 --> 03:40:23.240]  this fifth booster time kept actually thankfully the efficacy of the vaccine has been vouched for
[03:40:23.240 --> 03:40:29.960]  by that bastion of healthy living mcdonald's tragedy struck when buffalo bills player damar
[03:40:29.960 --> 03:40:34.360]  hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest after being struck in the chest when making a tackle hamlin
[03:40:34.360 --> 03:40:42.040]  the buffalo bill safety was hit right in the chest he got up wobbled for a second then collapsed
[03:40:42.920 --> 03:40:48.600]  many rushed to blame hamlin's collapse on the jab which let's face it was pretty stupid he'd
[03:40:48.600 --> 03:40:53.960]  literally just been poleaxed in the chest seconds earlier which maybe had something to do with it
[03:40:53.960 --> 03:40:57.640]  experts pointed out that hamlin was likely suffering from commercial cordis where a
[03:40:57.640 --> 03:41:01.960]  blow to the chest at a precise moment in the electoral cycle stops the heart which yes has
[03:41:01.960 --> 03:41:06.280]  happened to professional athletes in the past before the covid jab but that rushed to judgment
[03:41:06.280 --> 03:41:11.800]  enabled the legacy media to exploit the situation giving them headlines like this the inevitable
[03:41:11.800 --> 03:41:17.000]  grotesque effort to blame vaccines for damar hamlin's collapse lesson being no not every death or
[03:41:17.000 --> 03:41:21.800]  collapse of someone under the age of 40 is vaccine related but by the same token because
[03:41:21.800 --> 03:41:26.360]  hamlin's collapse wasn't caused by the jab doesn't mean the overwhelming number of athletes who
[03:41:26.360 --> 03:41:30.920]  have suffered a similar fate over the last two years should be ignored a story that received
[03:41:30.920 --> 03:41:36.360]  noticeably less coverage than the hamlin incident was the acute heart failure death of x nfl star
[03:41:36.360 --> 03:41:41.960]  uchi noanri 38 year old noanri suddenly collapsed at home and could not be saved he previously
[03:41:41.960 --> 03:41:47.400]  called for the unvaccinated to be jailed tweeting quote okay so let's get these vaccine mandates
[03:41:47.400 --> 03:41:51.880]  and vaccine passports up and running eight app we're seeing children die daily from the unvaccinated

[03:41:57.160 --> 03:42:02.520]  to protect life was his death vaccine related i don't know it's a tragedy either way but it's
[03:42:02.520 --> 03:42:08.280]  pretty rich isn't it when many of the same people who vilify so-called anti-vaxxers for blaming every
[03:42:08.280 --> 03:42:13.400]  death on the jab have spent the last two years blaming every covid death on the unvaccinated
[03:42:13.400 --> 03:42:16.520]  not going to comment on the football injury out of respect for the family but i can't help but
[03:42:16.520 --> 03:42:21.000]  notice a lot of people whining about anti-vaxxers being mean for talking about it and the same people
[03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:28.920]  who breathlessly posted every article of an unvaccinated person dying of covid that is covidians
[03:42:28.920 --> 03:42:34.600]  the rest of it is on youtube and we have this article as that as well just finishing off sweden
[03:42:34.600 --> 03:42:39.880]  did better than its neighbors of course sweden never locked down never imposed a severe mask mandate
[03:42:39.880 --> 03:42:45.480]  it was described as deadly folly by the guardian and a disaster by time magazine well now they
[03:42:45.480 --> 03:42:51.400]  have a lower mortality than all of their Nordic neighbors apart from one country so sweden was
[03:42:51.400 --> 03:42:56.760]  corrected not locking down not imposing the mask mandates they've come out the pandemic wait there

[03:47:21.480 --> 03:47:26.600]  we've got a few videos i'm gonna try and get to all of them maybe i'll get to all of them but
[03:47:26.600 --> 03:47:31.640]  i won't get to come back and talk about what happened in germany and the backlash to it massive
[03:47:31.640 --> 03:47:37.320]  riots again by the usual suspects migrant youths on new year's eve and the solution that the
[03:47:37.320 --> 03:47:42.200]  government has brought to the table on how they're going to fix this but first let's go to this video
[03:47:42.200 --> 03:47:48.120]  on a similar topic of course i've talked about this numerous times in the past seven million
[03:47:48.120 --> 03:47:53.720]  pounds a day of taxpayer money is being spent here in the united kingdom to put up boat migrants
[03:47:53.720 --> 03:47:59.800]  who arrive illegally half of them from albania a country that isn't at war the vast majority
[03:47:59.800 --> 03:48:07.320]  young migrant working age men not refugees to put them up in four star hotels sometimes five star
[03:48:07.320 --> 03:48:13.960]  hotels and of course to pay for their free health care even at a time when the nhs is supposedly on
[03:48:13.960 --> 03:48:20.680]  the brink of collapse now they're housing them in literal villages comprising of 500 people
[03:48:21.320 --> 03:48:27.000]  listen to the policy the scheme that they're planning to impose on this small village
[03:48:27.000 --> 03:48:34.040]  in the united kingdom this video is called imagine this happening to you let's roll it imagine living
[03:48:34.040 --> 03:48:39.960]  in a village with a population of just 500 people and then hearing that 400 migrants are going to
[03:48:39.960 --> 03:48:45.480]  move in next door it's not a nightmare for the residents of creta near northampton it's very
[03:48:45.480 --> 03:48:49.720]  much a reality residents in a village near northampton say they're frightened of a potential
[03:48:49.720 --> 03:48:54.680]  400 asylum seekers being temporarily accommodated at a nearby hotel in early december the home
[03:48:54.680 --> 03:48:58.840]  office informed west northamts council of its intention to use the former high gate house
[03:48:58.840 --> 03:49:03.160]  hotel in the village of creta which has recently been sold to new owners as a fourth site for
[03:49:03.160 --> 03:49:08.120]  asylum contingency accommodation with the possibility of it becoming operational in january think about
[03:49:08.120 --> 03:49:13.720]  that the population of your village almost doubles overnight with nearly half of it now
[03:49:13.720 --> 03:49:19.400]  comprised of almost exclusively male migrants from the middle eastern north africa what could possibly
[03:49:19.400 --> 03:49:23.480]  go wrong one resident called the numbers frightening the council spokesman said you
[03:49:23.480 --> 03:49:29.560]  couldn't pick a worse location to put 400 people slap bang in the middle of a village and yet again
[03:49:29.560 --> 03:49:34.600]  as ever the government didn't even consult them about it high gate house is a plush four-star
[03:49:34.600 --> 03:49:40.040]  hotel it's the only hotel in the immediate area jim swimming pool surrounded by 32 acres
[03:49:40.040 --> 03:49:45.320]  restaurant even four poster beds bad luck if you book to have your wedding there because that's
[03:49:45.320 --> 03:49:50.600]  definitely being cancelled look at the map showing the sheer volume of hotels across the country now
[03:49:50.600 --> 03:49:56.840]  being used to house boat migrants residents complain that the nearest hospital and gp are already
[03:49:56.840 --> 03:50:03.560]  stretched to breaking point leftists continually claim about the nhs being in crisis short staffed
[03:50:03.560 --> 03:50:09.320]  underfunded hospitals overcrowded yet simultaneously celebrate the fact that we just imported
[03:50:09.320 --> 03:50:15.720]  in a single year over a million new people simultaneously lobby for illegal boat migrants
[03:50:15.720 --> 03:50:21.320]  to be given free hotel accommodation and health care at taxpayer expense what do you think happens
[03:50:21.320 --> 03:50:25.240]  when you have a health care system already teetering on the brink of collapse because there
[03:50:25.240 --> 03:50:30.680]  isn't enough money facilities or staff to cater for the existing population then continually add
[03:50:30.680 --> 03:50:36.360]  millions of new people to that burden every single year we don't even have the resources to take care
[03:50:36.360 --> 03:50:41.320]  of our own people the sick elderly are being forced to wait sometimes hours for an ambulance
[03:50:41.320 --> 03:50:46.440]  sometimes days yeah in many cases these illegal migrants are being given their own gps their
[03:50:46.440 --> 03:50:52.120]  own doctors officers all on site to take care of their needs now they even want us to pay for their
[03:50:52.120 --> 03:50:57.720]  therapy people in the uk are freezing in their homes unable to afford to pay their heating bill
[03:50:57.720 --> 03:51:04.840]  while they again almost exclusively young working age men are safely and warmly ensconced in relative
[03:51:04.840 --> 03:51:13.720]  luxury now let's go to a similar topic and this is a phenomenon that we've witnessed since the mid
[03:51:13.720 --> 03:51:21.640]  2010s migrants migrant youths in major european cities choosing to celebrate new years eve
[03:51:21.640 --> 03:51:28.200]  by throwing fireworks at people in the street attacking police officers attacking firefighters
[03:51:28.200 --> 03:51:37.400]  and attacking ambulance workers in one case literally throwing rocks into an ambulance
[03:51:37.400 --> 03:51:44.120]  there in berlin let's go to this video now this is the video about the migrant riots in Germany
[03:51:44.120 --> 03:51:50.440]  on new years eve it's called otter mayhem yet again let's roll the clip new years eve saw absolute
[03:51:50.440 --> 03:51:56.680]  bedlam across major european cities yet again during a night of chaos in berlin migrant youths
[03:51:56.680 --> 03:52:02.520]  targeted police firefighters and ambulance workers yes ambulance workers with fireworks
[03:52:02.520 --> 03:52:07.960]  and other projectiles police and firefighters responded to almost 4 000 incidents with 15
[03:52:07.960 --> 03:52:12.760]  firefighters and 18 police officers injured my witnesses described scenes like something out of
[03:52:12.760 --> 03:52:28.680]  a war zone this footage of them just lobbing bricks through the open door of an ambulance
[03:52:28.680 --> 03:52:45.800]  this footage of them i can't even show firing bullets into police cars another clip showed
[03:52:45.800 --> 03:53:02.360]  a migrant youth mocking a firefighter than firing a gun into the air the next day the city was
[03:53:02.360 --> 03:53:15.880]  strewn with burnout vehicles george pazdurg former afd parliamentary group leader in the berlin house
[03:53:15.880 --> 03:53:19.960]  of representatives wrote when are we finally going to admit that we have a huge problem with
[03:53:19.960 --> 03:53:25.480]  young male migrants from archaic societies who don't want to integrate silencing the problem
[03:53:25.480 --> 03:53:30.600]  means continuing to promote it in a statement released by afd the party wrote anarchy reigned
[03:53:30.600 --> 03:53:35.720]  in berlin on new year's eve it was the first foretaste of future everyday life in german cities
[03:53:35.720 --> 03:53:40.040]  because although the authorities in the press are adamantly silent when it comes to the specific
[03:53:40.040 --> 03:53:45.640]  naming of the perpetrators the countless videos of that night speak volumes they are young violent
[03:53:45.640 --> 03:53:50.040]  men with a southern appearance who hardly speak german and not only can they immigrate unhindered
[03:53:50.040 --> 03:53:55.080]  they also get paid for a nice life by the traffic light government with tax money they've stopped
[03:53:55.080 --> 03:54:00.840]  even claiming police brutality as a nebulous justification for any of this now it's just a
[03:54:00.840 --> 03:54:05.720]  routine leisure activity football team wins rampage through the street setting fire to
[03:54:05.720 --> 03:54:10.200]  shit and attacking people football team losers rampage through the street setting fire to shit
[03:54:10.200 --> 03:54:14.120]  and attacking people new year's eve rampage through the street setting fire to shit and
[03:54:14.120 --> 03:54:18.920]  attacking people and guess what's the only solution being proposed to all this by authorities
[03:54:18.920 --> 03:54:24.040]  just ban fireworks yeah i'm sure that'll fix it place limits on importing the kind of people
[03:54:24.040 --> 03:54:29.160]  responsible for all this yeah don't be silly berlin wasn't the only major city being culturally
[03:54:29.160 --> 03:54:34.840]  enriched on new year's eve there were also numerous riots across france where almost 700 cars were
[03:54:34.840 --> 03:54:44.120]  set on fire and 500 people were arrested french interior minister gerald darman in ludicrously
[03:54:44.120 --> 03:54:50.040]  suggested that because only 690 vehicles were torched it had been a relatively quiet night
[03:54:50.040 --> 03:54:55.720]  darman in absurdly claimed that there had been quote no noticeable incidents in the country tell
[03:54:55.720 --> 03:55:00.760]  that to police in nont who were attacked with fireworks tell that to the occupants of a children's
[03:55:00.760 --> 03:55:05.800]  home in the oak gron region who had to flee after the building was set on fire tell that to people
[03:55:05.800 --> 03:55:11.080]  in bordeaux who had fireworks deliberately thrown at them it's total chaos and it happens all the
[03:55:11.080 --> 03:55:18.040]  time but few dare name the perpetrators because telling the truth is apparently far less important
[03:55:18.040 --> 03:55:26.600]  than continuing to inflate the myth that diversity is a strength now in the aftermath to this there's
[03:55:26.600 --> 03:55:32.440]  been the usual burying your head in the sand cover up by the german media refusing to name the
[03:55:32.440 --> 03:55:39.080]  perpetrators and just saying that basically it's it's misspent youth despite that remix has come out
[03:55:39.080 --> 03:55:45.160]  with this article 70 of those arrested for new year's eve riots in berlin have a migration
[03:55:45.160 --> 03:55:51.320]  background not difficult to tell when you watch the videos of the people doing it the vast majority
[03:55:51.320 --> 03:55:56.920]  of those arrested for riots in berlin on new year's eve or migrants local police have confirmed
[03:55:56.920 --> 03:56:03.560]  with more racist crime statistics says on tuesday evening berlin police provided an update on the
[03:56:03.560 --> 03:56:09.960]  situation of those arrested in connection with the riots of those arrested 100 have a migration
[03:56:09.960 --> 03:56:15.560]  background 45 whole german citizenship total of 18 different nationalities were recorded among
[03:56:15.560 --> 03:56:23.640]  the transgressors mainly from afghanistan and syria but you know what the solution is stop
[03:56:23.640 --> 03:56:29.640]  importing the people responsible for this mayhem for this drastic rising violent crime across
[03:56:29.640 --> 03:56:35.960]  european cities no that's not the solution we need to keep doing that the solution is to ban fireworks
[03:56:35.960 --> 03:56:42.360]  because they can get weapons and literally fire guns into the air but perfectly fine
[03:56:43.400 --> 03:56:49.800]  they're banned they still get them no just ban fireworks german police union urges new year's
[03:56:49.800 --> 03:56:55.000]  eve fireworks ban gdp union has urged the government to forbid new year's eve fireworks
[03:56:55.000 --> 03:57:01.400]  for individual use they tried that in the past anyway didn't even work so europe continues to
[03:57:01.400 --> 03:57:08.520]  enjoy its cultural enrichment meanwhile in the uk cut motorway speed limit to 64 miles an hour to
[03:57:08.520 --> 03:57:14.680]  drive net zero goals the speed limit on motorways in the uk in some places is already down to 50
[03:57:14.680 --> 03:57:21.480]  miles an hour it's barely even yet worth using a motorway anymore in some areas but again they're
[03:57:21.480 --> 03:57:27.480]  gonna control your mobility they're gonna make your life more expensive and more miserable
[03:57:27.480 --> 03:57:32.760]  that's what net zero is about that's what global warming is about it's not about controlling the
[03:57:32.760 --> 03:57:39.000]  climate it's about controlling your behavior that's going to wrap it up for summit dot news
