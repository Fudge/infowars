[00:00.000 --> 00:21.560]  Friday, June 5th, the year 2020, 150 days out from the historic election.
[00:21.560 --> 00:27.200]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and the times we're living in could not be more critical
[00:27.200 --> 00:30.720]  to the future of humanity.
[00:30.720 --> 00:34.600]  The decision has been made to end the renaissance.
[00:34.600 --> 00:40.720]  The decision has been made to end a true liberal world system.
[00:40.720 --> 00:45.400]  And to undermine that system, they created the counterfeit leftist left hand path French
[00:45.400 --> 00:49.640]  Revolution system to counter the American renaissance.
[00:49.640 --> 00:56.800]  And 250 years later, the same players, the same institutions are battling it out economically
[00:56.800 --> 01:01.120]  culturally, spiritually, genetically.
[01:01.120 --> 01:06.320]  We are in the crosshairs at a level never before seen.
[01:06.320 --> 01:11.120]  And the very pillars of the city, the very pillars of civilization are being undermined
[01:11.120 --> 01:18.600]  so they collapse it on the ashes of technocracy controlled by AI surveillance and robots will
[01:18.600 --> 01:21.280]  be built on the rubble.
[01:21.280 --> 01:23.720]  And this is the stated plan.
[01:23.720 --> 01:28.040]  It's one thing to try to build a good civilization and be strong and virtuous.
[01:28.040 --> 01:31.960]  It's hard, but it can be done, but it doesn't let tyrants take over.
[01:31.960 --> 01:39.040]  But if you could undermine and create corruption, well, it's very easy to rule a collapse and
[01:39.040 --> 01:45.560]  then build your armored fortress and your breakaway civilization on its ashes.
[01:45.560 --> 01:48.520]  I have cleared the deck of guests today.
[01:48.520 --> 01:53.440]  We'll have open lines in the customary classic style of talk radio throughout the three hours
[01:53.440 --> 01:57.960]  that I'm hosting with Dr. Nick baggage says he particularly wants to host today.
[01:57.960 --> 01:59.800]  And he's normally happy about preempting.
[01:59.800 --> 02:04.920]  So he's loaded for bear as they say in the fourth hour.
[02:04.920 --> 02:08.160]  I really want to flesh out these ideas.
[02:08.160 --> 02:10.320]  I really want to get into the information.
[02:10.320 --> 02:15.000]  I don't want to just go over the outrage and show the evil of the globalist and the stupidity
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  of their minions.
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.880]  But I want to talk big picture 35,000 foot view today, but also zoom in on some of the
[02:21.880 --> 02:31.360]  actual effects of this, but this is scientific destruction that we are facing.
[02:31.360 --> 02:35.280]  And what's incredible is people that actually pay attention to this broadcast.
[02:35.280 --> 02:39.400]  They say, how are you right almost every time?
[02:39.400 --> 02:45.160]  How does you know that Bill Gates put out this study three months ago that hydroxychloroquine
[02:45.160 --> 02:47.000]  hurts people and helps no one?
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.920]  Well, I went and researched that it was a group that he funds that paid for it.
[02:50.920 --> 02:53.800]  Then I looked at all the other studies by all of them.
[02:53.800 --> 02:57.720]  I'd looked at many and I talked to the doctors and we played clips of doctors around the
[02:57.720 --> 03:03.640]  world saying 100% recovery rate with hydroxychloroquine.
[03:03.640 --> 03:07.560]  And now it came out mainstream news.
[03:07.560 --> 03:18.160]  Even the Washington Post had to admit study pulled researchers retract botched anti hydroxychloroquine
[03:18.160 --> 03:23.920]  study, which was used to attack Trump.
[03:23.920 --> 03:27.480]  Think about how big that is.
[03:27.480 --> 03:33.680]  The Lancet Journal and one other that published it demanded the source data because the public
[03:33.680 --> 03:36.680]  buck this and turns out there was none.
[03:36.680 --> 03:40.080]  Bill Gates is a criminal.
[03:40.080 --> 03:43.320]  He made it all up.
[03:43.320 --> 03:50.960]  That's just one huge bombshell COVID-19 hoax that came out today.
[03:50.960 --> 03:56.680]  There's three others, three other mega massive.
[03:56.680 --> 04:01.520]  Just one of these would be earth shattering.
[04:01.520 --> 04:02.520]  Guess what?
[04:02.520 --> 04:07.160]  A big book got published by an investigative journalist, very highly respected, worked with
[04:07.160 --> 04:12.400]  some of the biggest analysts in the country, like the New York Times.
[04:12.400 --> 04:14.680]  And that's why they were so scared of them.
[04:14.680 --> 04:19.920]  When it was published digitally with all the bibliography and all the footnotes, Amazon
[04:19.920 --> 04:24.440]  banned it because it exposed COVID as a hoax and showed all the studies showing that they
[04:24.440 --> 04:31.080]  put the regular deaths in the COVID column that showed that it came out of Wuhan, funded
[04:31.080 --> 04:32.960]  by Bill and Melinda Gates.
[04:32.960 --> 04:33.960]  They banned it.
[04:33.960 --> 04:38.560]  But there was such a backlash and Elon Musk called for them to be broken up, Amazon should
[04:38.560 --> 04:44.680]  be broken up, like Microsoft or Mavel, and they backed off.
[04:44.680 --> 04:49.440]  So that's the good news is there's pushback, but it just goes on and on and on and on and
[04:49.440 --> 04:51.160]  on and on and on.
[04:51.160 --> 04:56.160]  This is so critical to all our futures that people listen carefully, research my claims
[04:56.160 --> 04:59.040]  and then take action.
[04:59.040 --> 05:04.280]  I've been fighting the globalists for 26 years and the evil side of me is just so tired of
[05:04.280 --> 05:09.120]  waiting and I'm so ready for physical war that I'm kind of happy about how bad things
[05:09.120 --> 05:13.680]  have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand up for the unborn babies
[05:13.680 --> 05:17.440]  that go along with the New World Order, you're about to find out just how sick stuff is.
[05:17.440 --> 05:18.440]  But you know what?
[05:18.440 --> 05:19.720]  The average person is still asleep.
[05:19.720 --> 05:21.520]  They don't deserve what's happening to them.
[05:21.520 --> 05:26.280]  So I'm actually sick about what's unfolding right now and I just want to turn things around.
[05:26.280 --> 05:27.280]  But you know what?
[05:27.280 --> 05:29.320]  I can't do that without you.
[05:29.320 --> 05:30.680]  I can't get out of this mess.
[05:30.680 --> 05:34.800]  I can't get out of this stranglehold I'm in unless you decide to get out of it as well.
[05:34.800 --> 05:38.680]  We're all in this together and so if you just realize how important you are, when you just
[05:38.680 --> 05:41.760]  tell people about the local radio stations you're listening to, local TV stations, when
[05:41.760 --> 05:47.440]  you've just spread the word about infowarstore.com, when you just buy the products at infowarstore.com,
[05:47.440 --> 05:48.440]  it changes the world.
[05:48.440 --> 05:54.160]  Right now we've got a special that's about to end 60% off across the board, flash sale
[05:54.160 --> 06:01.800]  that funds the M4 and gets you great products at the same time, infowarstore.com.
[06:01.800 --> 06:18.760]  150 standard Earth days until the most historic election in world history.
[06:18.760 --> 06:19.760]  It's Friday, June 5th.
[06:19.760 --> 06:21.280]  The year is 2020.
[06:21.280 --> 06:23.520]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[06:23.520 --> 06:31.360]  We are setting out again to enlighten and awaken and warn as many people to do their
[06:31.360 --> 06:36.320]  own research, find out we're telling the truth and then mobilize and take action against
[06:36.320 --> 06:41.400]  the globalist technocrats who are trying to create an anti-human future.
[06:41.400 --> 06:43.280]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday edition.
[06:43.280 --> 06:46.200]  We're going to have open phones throughout the entire transmission.
[06:46.200 --> 06:52.840]  I'll give the number out starting at the start of the next segment, but let me just plow through
[06:52.840 --> 06:55.000]  what is coming up today.
[06:55.000 --> 07:01.240]  This is Bloomberg, researchers retract study linking malaria pill to heart risk.
[07:01.240 --> 07:08.800]  The entire study lands at reports is a complete and total hoax funded by Bill Gates.
[07:08.800 --> 07:15.320]  Hydroxychloroquine has an almost 100% rate of saving people because it is a zinc deficiency
[07:15.320 --> 07:18.760]  that most people die of viruses from.
[07:18.760 --> 07:25.400]  Amazon censors former New York Times reporter book exposing COVID-19 lockdowns as a giant
[07:25.400 --> 07:32.560]  hoax even though it used all scientific bibliographies and fact checkers, but that blew up in their
[07:32.560 --> 07:38.440]  face in a very, very, very big way.
[07:38.440 --> 07:45.760]  And so now because Elon Musk and others called for Amazon to be broken up, they have re-allowed
[07:45.760 --> 07:51.960]  the book to be published on the Amazon reader system.
[07:51.960 --> 07:57.560]  Talk about 1984, it is here.
[07:57.560 --> 08:05.840]  So incredibly important on that front and we're going to be laying it out here today.
[08:05.840 --> 08:12.360]  What's really happening and what's really inside of these vaccines.
[08:12.360 --> 08:18.280]  Now I'm going to be doing that coming up at the start of the next hour, but it really
[08:18.280 --> 08:30.560]  is a huge, huge, huge deal that Bill Gates is truly the boogeyman.
[08:30.560 --> 08:40.760]  And if you look at the word where boogeyman comes from, it's German for goblin.
[08:40.760 --> 08:46.520]  And so when I tease and make jokes and call the globalist goblins, that's because archetypally
[08:46.520 --> 08:47.640]  that's what I see them like.
[08:47.640 --> 08:54.760]  They operate in the dark, they're anti-human, they waylay people, drag them off their dens.
[08:54.760 --> 09:00.400]  It's a nice allegory or let's just say it's a good mascot for them that these folks are
[09:00.400 --> 09:02.560]  goblins.
[09:02.560 --> 09:08.840]  I don't just pick him out to demonize him.
[09:08.840 --> 09:16.280]  Every time I dig the bottom of a fetted rat hole, a spider hole, a goblin nest, I find
[09:16.280 --> 09:22.280]  hair gates waiting there at the center of the web.
[09:22.280 --> 09:27.640]  And boy, as he pissed, he's in USA today, the London Guardian everywhere saying, I don't
[09:27.640 --> 09:32.600]  want you to have any implantable microchips.
[09:32.600 --> 09:39.880]  Even though we have MIT saying he paid them to develop a vaccine that delivers nanotech
[09:39.880 --> 09:46.640]  into your body that can then be scanned and read to prove you have it.
[09:46.640 --> 09:52.200]  And the man they used as their poster boy for taking the new experimental vaccine almost
[09:52.200 --> 09:59.640]  died and was told by CNN and Bill and Bill Gates Foundation not to tell the public.
[09:59.640 --> 10:02.280]  That's mainstream news breaking.
[10:02.280 --> 10:03.720]  But you know what?
[10:03.720 --> 10:05.320]  People are still running around wearing the mask.
[10:05.320 --> 10:09.080]  They're still buying into the hoax as the economy continues to shut down and even in
[10:09.080 --> 10:15.000]  areas where they reopen things, people aren't coming back because you're not a hero when
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.440]  you go out and you shop or go to dinner or go to the florist and buy your wife flowers.
[10:19.440 --> 10:23.720]  Just stay in your house until everybody's bankrupt and all the police departments are
[10:23.720 --> 10:28.140]  disbanded and every city's burning and we're in a total depression and the IMF and World
[10:28.140 --> 10:33.680]  Bank can come in and take control and bail us all out, oh, and guess what?
[10:33.680 --> 10:34.680]  I missed this.
[10:34.680 --> 10:36.240]  It broke two days ago.
[10:36.240 --> 10:39.880]  The crew brought us my attention last night.
[10:39.880 --> 10:42.000]  It's a sickening hundred page report.
[10:42.000 --> 10:43.600]  I read almost all of it.
[10:43.600 --> 10:49.200]  There's a three page synopsis we'll go over, but you talk about nightmare, it's it.
[10:49.200 --> 10:51.720]  This is coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[10:51.720 --> 10:53.880]  Now is the time for the great reset.
[10:53.880 --> 10:59.200]  We kept saying COVID will be the excuse for the global depression with the UN IMF World
[10:59.200 --> 11:03.040]  Bank taking control of the first world, just like they've done to the third world.
[11:03.040 --> 11:08.280]  It'll be the excuse to finally push this under into debt bankruptcy to the world government.
[11:08.280 --> 11:13.440]  They say exactly that, but it's wonderful.
[11:13.440 --> 11:18.440]  Lord Rothschild and everybody will rule us now and loan us our own digital money back
[11:18.440 --> 11:23.640]  and dictate how we live and it says your lifestyle is never going to be the same, but it's
[11:23.640 --> 11:24.640]  for the best.
[11:24.640 --> 11:30.320]  And you'll have to get permission to travel and it's officially from the Davos Group
[11:30.320 --> 11:36.440]  World Economic Forum, basically the spokesperson group for the Bilderberg Group.
[11:36.440 --> 11:42.560]  That ties in Billy Boy Gates and he says he's not secretly plotting microchips in a coronavirus
[11:42.560 --> 11:49.680]  vaccine because it's not a secret, it's public, but they play games.
[11:49.680 --> 11:55.120]  He goes, well, I am funding a study for you to wear a bracelet or a watch that tracks
[11:55.120 --> 11:59.280]  where you go and what you do for cryptocurrency, but that doesn't have microchips.
[11:59.280 --> 12:04.320]  Oh, no, no, we talked about that and then how you also have a bandaid that has the vaccine
[12:04.320 --> 12:09.920]  in it that has little tiny pieces of glass, little micro slivers that you put on somebody
[12:09.920 --> 12:15.960]  that go into the skin and stay in the skin with nanotech.
[12:15.960 --> 12:20.840]  And that's officially from the club of Ron, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Population
[12:20.840 --> 12:30.760]  Council and we have MIT saying Bill and Melinda Gates paid them to develop the new system.
[12:30.760 --> 12:40.920]  So that is all coming up as well.
[12:40.920 --> 12:44.240]  We're going to break it all down.
[12:44.240 --> 12:51.400]  Now obviously the big news that's at hand right now is how many times did we say they're
[12:51.400 --> 12:55.240]  going to try to cause a civil war and call it an insurrection and try to overthrow local
[12:55.240 --> 12:59.640]  government till things fall apart and then demand Trump be driven from office saying
[12:59.640 --> 13:05.000]  he allowed this to happen, he caused this to happen, he's unfit to command.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.520]  That's been the blueprint of Antifa funded by Soros.
[13:07.520 --> 13:10.400]  That's been the blueprint of Black Lives Matter funded by the Democratic Party.
[13:10.400 --> 13:12.880]  It's all the same group.
[13:12.880 --> 13:16.240]  And Republicans would say, Jones, they'll never get away with that.
[13:16.240 --> 13:18.520]  Oh, come on, haha.
[13:18.520 --> 13:22.600]  2016, Antifa wasn't able to do that.
[13:22.600 --> 13:24.160]  That was a beta test.
[13:24.160 --> 13:32.280]  If you look at the Google Trends as our guest hotep Jesus brought up yesterday, 2016, the
[13:32.280 --> 13:38.760]  Black Lives Matter Antifa blip was 20% of what it is now.
[13:38.760 --> 13:43.480]  It is a massive off the chart spike.
[13:43.480 --> 13:44.920]  And look at these headlines.
[13:44.920 --> 13:47.720]  Are we on the brink of revolution?
[13:47.720 --> 13:51.280]  And they're telling us the revolution's burning your local community and killing cops.
[13:51.280 --> 13:54.040]  Oh, you're going to have a lot more cops when they're done.
[13:54.040 --> 13:56.080]  Boy, let me tell you.
[13:56.080 --> 14:01.480]  Movement to defund police gains unprecedented support across U.S., London Guardian, L.A.
[14:01.480 --> 14:06.240]  Mayor slashes LAPD budget as calls to defund police slowly pick up steam.
[14:06.240 --> 14:09.120]  Minneapolis Council members considered disbanding the police.
[14:09.120 --> 14:15.840]  ACLU sues over police force protesters near White House.
[14:15.840 --> 14:18.480]  Vegas defunds the police 100 million.
[14:18.480 --> 14:22.760]  We're going to cover it all and how it ties in to the end game.
[14:22.760 --> 14:33.120]  But this is an authoritarian model 100% we're going to cover this when we come back and
[14:33.120 --> 14:37.320]  how to stop the globalist master plan and how it ties into Black Lives Matter officially
[14:37.320 --> 14:39.320]  tells White people no selfies.
[14:39.320 --> 14:43.600]  You're here to serve us reinventing slavery.
[14:43.600 --> 14:48.280]  But before we go any further, ladies and gentlemen, please do not forget that we're running the
[14:48.280 --> 14:52.520]  biggest sale not just of this year, but of last year with how crazy things are.

[14:55.760 --> 14:59.960]  you have them and so we have the funds to at least continue on through the election.
[14:59.960 --> 15:08.280]  60% off across the board flash sale in full war store.com and a lot of the items are about
[15:08.280 --> 15:10.640]  to sell out.
[15:10.640 --> 15:17.760]  In fact, when I came over here, Tim Fruge gave me a list and I got busy.
[15:17.760 --> 15:20.680]  Now I don't have my list so maybe he can bring that back over to me.
[15:20.680 --> 15:23.040]  Oh, yes, selling out soon.
[15:23.040 --> 15:24.040]  Here it is.

[15:58.480 --> 16:01.640]  People of the world have awakened to globalism.
[16:01.640 --> 16:06.800]  And so populist movements are throwing the globalist out of their countries.
[16:06.800 --> 16:11.240]  That's why the new world order is instituting race war and division and telling the people
[16:11.240 --> 16:16.600]  that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying
[16:16.600 --> 16:18.560]  essential services.
[16:18.560 --> 16:24.000]  This is an attempt to have society collapse and the globalist as they've done in the third
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.800]  world will come in and pick up the pieces.
[16:26.800 --> 16:32.280]  We must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU openly saying defund
[16:32.280 --> 16:33.280]  the police.
[16:33.280 --> 16:34.760]  The police have a lot of problems.
[16:34.760 --> 16:36.120]  We all have a lot of problems.
[16:36.120 --> 16:38.880]  But this is our government and our local vocabulary.
[16:38.880 --> 16:43.560]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country, they are going to put in a real
[16:43.560 --> 16:45.800]  police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[16:45.800 --> 16:49.600]  The globalist believe communist China is the model of the world.
[16:49.600 --> 16:51.720]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[16:51.720 --> 16:58.280]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed, infowars.com.
[16:58.280 --> 17:00.640]  One of our best selling products is living defense.
[17:00.640 --> 17:05.000]  And it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients
[17:05.000 --> 17:06.000]  that are organic.
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.440]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast.
[17:08.440 --> 17:12.000]  And I want those of you that haven't experienced living defense to get it for yourself.
[17:12.000 --> 17:13.240]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[17:13.240 --> 17:14.240]  I looked.
[17:14.240 --> 17:16.240]  In January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[17:16.240 --> 17:19.800]  I went in the VA hospital out here in Boyce and I was in there until June.
[17:19.800 --> 17:24.480]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to infowars three
[17:24.480 --> 17:25.480]  hours a day.
[17:25.480 --> 17:29.080]  And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[17:29.080 --> 17:30.080]  Let me tell you something, man.
[17:30.080 --> 17:34.880]  I had an internal digestive problem and I stumbled with it for about five or six years
[17:34.880 --> 17:36.920]  and the doctors, they tried every time.
[17:36.920 --> 17:38.400]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[17:38.400 --> 17:41.960]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[17:41.960 --> 17:42.960]  you know what?
[17:42.960 --> 17:44.360]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[17:44.360 --> 17:47.640]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have it.
[17:47.640 --> 17:48.640]  But I ordered it.
[17:48.640 --> 17:49.640]  They accepted me.
[17:49.640 --> 17:50.640]  I got it.
[17:50.640 --> 17:51.640]  I hid it from the nurses.
[17:51.640 --> 17:52.640]  I started taking it, man.
[17:52.640 --> 17:54.280]  That stuff changed my life.
[17:54.280 --> 17:55.280]  It saved my life.
[17:55.280 --> 18:02.080]  Alex Jones and info wars saved my life.
[18:02.080 --> 18:06.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:06.080 --> 18:31.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and we're broadcasting worldwide on this Friday, June
[18:31.880 --> 18:37.520]  5, 2020 transmission.
[18:37.520 --> 18:45.960]  And I could sit over there with you and I could read you patents and documents and announcements
[18:45.960 --> 18:51.080]  by the IMF, announcements by the world government.
[18:51.080 --> 18:55.600]  Or I could just look directly into the camera and talk directly in this microphone to radio
[18:55.600 --> 19:02.120]  listeners and TV viewers and ask you, do you want to control your own future?
[19:02.120 --> 19:04.920]  Do you want a pro human future?
[19:04.920 --> 19:10.520]  Because when I say, do you want a pro human future?
[19:10.520 --> 19:18.920]  The establishment has decided that you're worthless.
[19:18.920 --> 19:32.280]  They've decided that you need to be gotten rid of.
[19:32.280 --> 19:42.960]  And this isn't just rhetoric that I'm up here talking about.
[19:42.960 --> 19:48.680]  It's the real world and it's real things that are happening and civilization.
[19:48.680 --> 20:03.640]  And your family's future being undermined.
[20:03.640 --> 20:10.000]  And so I sit up here on this TV program with this chess set, this skull, these flowers.
[20:10.000 --> 20:15.360]  A lot of people have asked, got emails, got text messages saying, what's the point on
[20:15.360 --> 20:16.360]  your show?
[20:16.360 --> 20:17.360]  It looks really interesting.
[20:17.360 --> 20:25.760]  Well, the point of it is, is that it's esoteric and it then allows you, because it isn't a
[20:25.760 --> 20:30.000]  clear message to project onto it, what you're thinking.
[20:30.000 --> 20:37.120]  If I can tell you what it means to me, you have the potential of all God's gifts symbolized
[20:37.120 --> 20:51.760]  by a tree and a tree of life and the red blood of humans that unifies us, I'm going to get
[20:51.760 --> 20:52.760]  to that later.
[20:52.760 --> 20:57.480]  I'm going to go to a special report here for a while and try to come back and do the show.
[20:57.480 --> 21:00.560]  Because I'm not ready to do this yet, I guess.
[21:00.560 --> 21:11.840]  Now it's not the time, I guess, but let's just say this, the establishment's betting
[21:11.840 --> 21:12.840]  against you.
[21:12.840 --> 21:17.240]  They think you're done and they're going to hurt you really bad, they're going to hurt
[21:17.240 --> 21:22.200]  everybody really bad and that's now extremely clear to everyone.
[21:22.200 --> 21:27.040]  And I'm going to try to break this down a little bit later what I was going to get to.
[21:27.040 --> 21:30.040]  Maybe we'll do it that time.
[21:30.040 --> 21:34.360]  This is a really important special report, then we're going to come back and I'm going
[21:34.360 --> 21:38.640]  to get into Bill Gates and world government and the latest on the vaccines being admitted
[21:38.640 --> 21:41.200]  to be a total fraud.
[21:41.200 --> 21:46.960]  And really what that means and the fact that COVID-19 is now an admitted hoax, but we've
[21:46.960 --> 21:50.560]  moved on to the worldwide riots that are anti-America.
[21:50.560 --> 22:01.000]  I mean how obvious is this is a takedown of the country and of the world?
[22:01.000 --> 22:08.080]  Let's play Paul Joseph Watson's report, The Woke Virus and Paul asked in his report, why
[22:08.080 --> 22:12.240]  are they out on the street?
[22:12.240 --> 22:15.440]  The left, well they're the ones saying you shouldn't be outside because it's all about
[22:15.440 --> 22:17.440]  power, it's not about logic.
[22:17.440 --> 22:24.200]  It's part of Paul Watson's report.
[22:24.200 --> 22:27.640]  Remember that whole coronavirus social distancing thing?
[22:27.640 --> 22:32.800]  Remember how in both the US and the UK the media denounced and publicly shamed anti-lockdown
[22:32.800 --> 22:37.000]  protesters for spreading the disease and killing granny?
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.760]  Well they've suddenly changed their tune haven't they?
[22:39.760 --> 22:44.440]  Thousands of BLM demonstrators gathered in London today for more peaceful protests that
[22:44.440 --> 22:49.080]  ended with barriers being smashed, objects hurled at cops and police officers punched
[22:49.080 --> 22:50.080]  in the face.
[22:50.080 --> 22:51.080]  So peaceful.
[22:51.080 --> 22:55.320]  Boris Johnson urged people to protest in accordance with social distancing.
[22:55.320 --> 23:01.200]  Yeah, really looks like they're doing that, meanwhile we can't hug our loved ones by
[23:01.200 --> 23:02.200]  law.
[23:02.200 --> 23:08.800]  It's illegal for us to get closer than two metres to our own parents, but this is okay.
[23:08.800 --> 23:13.680]  Anti-lockdown protesters are bad, spread the virus and kill granny and you'll be publicly
[23:13.680 --> 23:15.240]  shamed if you take part.
[23:15.240 --> 23:27.440]  BLM protests are good and don't spread coronavirus at all and you'll be publicly shamed if you
[23:27.440 --> 23:28.440]  don't take part.
[23:28.440 --> 23:33.280]  The same health workers in the US who berated stay-at-home protesters even though many of
[23:33.280 --> 23:38.400]  them stayed inside their vehicles for violating social distancing are out on the streets today
[23:38.400 --> 23:44.080]  applauding far left protesters for congregating in huge mobs with total disregard for social
[23:44.080 --> 23:59.080]  distancing.
[23:59.080 --> 24:02.800]  Authorities in New York were enforcing social distancing rules despite the fact that riots
[24:02.800 --> 24:06.000]  and looting were taking place just two miles away.
[24:06.000 --> 24:10.360]  People aren't even allowed to go to church yet these rioters are venerated.
[24:10.360 --> 24:14.920]  We can't even go to the pub to see our friends yet these people can swarm Downing Street
[24:14.920 --> 24:18.200]  in huge numbers and the media gives them a pass.
[24:18.200 --> 24:21.680]  Imagine if there was an open the pubs protest in London.
[24:21.680 --> 24:26.800]  Even if only a hundred people turned up the media and the left would be outraged, attendees
[24:26.800 --> 24:29.000]  would be doxxed and harassed.
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.040]  Thousands gather in London to protest something that happened in a different country.
[24:33.040 --> 24:34.040]  Media.
[24:34.040 --> 24:35.040]  This is fine.
[24:35.040 --> 24:38.840]  This is how much of a big deal they made out of that Atalanta Valencia football match
[24:38.840 --> 24:43.880]  in Italy before the lockdown that they said was responsible for drastically spreading
[24:43.880 --> 24:44.880]  Covid.
[24:44.880 --> 24:47.440]  The media called it a biological bomb.
[24:47.440 --> 24:49.840]  This is London today.
[24:49.840 --> 24:50.840]  What changed?
[24:50.840 --> 24:51.880]  Let me emphasise.
[24:51.880 --> 24:56.080]  This is all in response to something that happened in a different country.
[24:56.080 --> 25:02.760]  UK police killed just two unarmed, meaning without a gun, people in the whole of 2019.
[25:02.760 --> 25:06.320]  One of whom was Usman Kahn, the London Bridge terrorist.
[25:06.320 --> 25:08.240]  What are you even protesting?
[25:08.240 --> 25:13.000]  When an Islamic terrorist blew up a bunch of kids in Manchester, we were told, don't
[25:13.000 --> 25:20.000]  look back in anger, but when an American cop kills someone 4000 miles away, people get
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.000]  angry.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.160]  Then there's the whole Dominic Cummings freak out.
[25:23.160 --> 25:28.080]  The same people who just hyperventilated for over a week because a government adviser broke
[25:28.080 --> 25:33.960]  social distancing to arrange urgent care for his child and outgushing over a mass gathering
[25:33.960 --> 25:36.880]  of thousands of people in central London.
[25:36.880 --> 25:37.880]  What changed?
[25:37.880 --> 25:39.800]  Is coronavirus woke?
[25:39.800 --> 25:45.360]  Does it take a break exclusively for protests that champion left-wing causes or are you
[25:45.360 --> 25:48.400]  all just a bunch of massive hypocrites?
[25:48.400 --> 25:51.840]  This Labour MP was whining about Cummings on May 25th.
[25:51.840 --> 25:56.240]  Just over a week later, he's bragging about breaking social distancing because virtue
[25:56.240 --> 25:58.680]  signalling is more important.
[25:58.680 --> 26:00.480]  Massive **** hypocrite.
[26:00.480 --> 26:05.360]  The UK media laboriously keeps telling us that coronavirus disproportionately affects
[26:05.360 --> 26:06.840]  BAME communities.
[26:06.840 --> 26:11.000]  Now thousands of BAME people are in close proximity, potentially giving each other the
[26:11.000 --> 26:14.160]  virus and the media celebrates it.
[26:14.160 --> 26:17.520]  Many of the protesters in London are school-aged teenagers.
[26:17.520 --> 26:21.720]  Leftists have aggressively campaigned against sending them back to school because of the
[26:21.720 --> 26:27.200]  threat of spreading Covid, attending a protest with thousands of other people cheek by jowl
[26:27.200 --> 26:28.200]  though.
[26:28.200 --> 26:29.480]  That's fine.
[26:29.480 --> 26:33.640]  As Ben Sixmith writes for The Spectator, it's kind of amazing.
[26:33.640 --> 26:38.040]  For weeks we have been arguing about the minute details of viral transmission.
[26:38.040 --> 26:39.120]  Can you be outside?
[26:39.120 --> 26:40.680]  How often can you be outside?
[26:40.680 --> 26:42.000]  Can you be with other people?
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  How many?
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.360]  And how much distance should you keep from each other?
[26:45.360 --> 26:48.920]  Then masses of people gather in cities across the world for a pro-
[26:48.920 --> 26:57.920]  Alright folks, the full report is at Band-Aid Video, now I'm loaded.
[26:57.920 --> 27:04.120]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their Covid-19 hoax
[27:04.120 --> 27:10.440]  and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[27:10.440 --> 27:13.720]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next, I can tell you.
[27:13.720 --> 27:19.000]  There's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.000]  war.
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.160]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[27:25.160 --> 27:29.960]  The globalists are attacking on every front, that's why now, more than ever we have to
[27:29.960 --> 27:34.640]  realize, they tried to censor inforars off the air because they knew that when they
[27:34.640 --> 27:39.120]  launched this whole situation that they did want the people's voice to still be on air.
[27:39.120 --> 27:43.280]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[27:43.280 --> 27:49.280]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman's signal now, more than ever, InfoWars.com
[27:49.280 --> 27:50.280]  lives.
[27:50.280 --> 27:56.400]  Feudalism in the ancient world from Asia to Europe, from Africa to Latin America was
[27:56.400 --> 27:58.720]  the most common form of government.
[27:58.720 --> 28:03.600]  You had a ruling class, the nobility, the king and queen sitting on top of it and the
[28:03.600 --> 28:08.680]  rest of the public were kept at a subsistence starving level for control.
[28:08.680 --> 28:13.240]  In fact, in most cultures, they called the peasants the little people because they were
[28:13.240 --> 28:19.440]  usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them again at
[28:19.440 --> 28:21.200]  a starving level.
[28:21.200 --> 28:25.320]  They were so busy trying to survive, they would never try to challenge the entrenched
[28:25.320 --> 28:26.320]  elite.
[28:26.320 --> 28:30.440]  Well, now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the Jeff
[28:30.440 --> 28:34.680]  Bezos is the world, they're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters
[28:34.680 --> 28:41.440]  and private jets living the life, laughing at you, shut down, going bankrupt into the
[28:41.440 --> 28:43.240]  third world starving to death.
[28:43.240 --> 28:49.000]  Their religion is power and control and they are pressing that advantage against us.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.440]  We must break free from these monsters.
[28:51.440 --> 28:56.520]  I had told listeners back in December that I would never go to 50% off again because
[28:56.520 --> 29:00.800]  our markup isn't big enough selling the products to be able to fund ourselves doing that.
[29:00.800 --> 29:05.960]  But I got to tell you, things are so crazy, the world is so insane, my gut level instinct
[29:05.960 --> 29:11.720]  is sell out everything we've got in the warehouse to make sure we can stay on air through the
[29:11.720 --> 29:16.640]  election in 150 days because we only got money to operate a few months right now.
[29:16.640 --> 29:18.960]  So these are great products you and your family need.
[29:18.960 --> 29:21.960]  It funds the info war, get them all down.
[29:21.960 --> 29:30.040]  These are staples, super male vitality, 60% off, knock out sleep support, 60% off, Rain
[29:30.040 --> 29:36.080]  Force Plus, 50% off, BioTrue Selenium, 50% off, Chillforce, Old McGrill Oil, it goes
[29:36.080 --> 29:39.640]  on and on, 50% to 60% off.
[29:39.640 --> 29:47.160]  Some of these are 70% off, biggest sale ever, infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com, 60% off
[29:47.160 --> 30:13.160]  is the average sale, take advantage now and fund the infowar.
[30:13.160 --> 30:21.160]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[30:21.160 --> 30:26.800]  So the biggest villain in the world right now, it's not Osama bin Laden, it's not even
[30:26.800 --> 30:27.800]  G.G.
[30:27.800 --> 30:33.360]  Ping, it really deserves the title probably, he's probably even worse than Bill Gates.
[30:33.360 --> 30:38.720]  But Bill Gates is the most hated man in the world, that's all over mainstream news.
[30:38.720 --> 30:43.120]  There's more negative comments, people absolutely hate his guts, they call him a baby killer,
[30:43.120 --> 30:51.120]  a eugenicist, a Nazi, a tyrant, a mad scientist, because that's what he is.
[30:51.120 --> 30:57.240]  Now he was always an arrogant globalist, he ran a monopoly scam at Microsoft with stolen
[30:57.240 --> 31:05.240]  software, and he got his big company broken up back in the 1990s.
[31:05.240 --> 31:10.800]  But since then he's been quietly buying up all the major national health services of
[31:10.800 --> 31:13.040]  the planet, that's not debated.
[31:13.040 --> 31:17.920]  Almost every country's national health service is a revolving door of Bill and Melinda Gates
[31:17.920 --> 31:18.920]  appointees.
[31:18.920 --> 31:24.680]  He controls the United Nations, WHO, along with Communist China, that's why he's always
[31:24.680 --> 31:30.080]  defending Communist China and attacking the United States, well, he's got a charm offensive
[31:30.080 --> 31:42.800]  going, ABC News, BBC News, USA Today, and he's been doing interviews, he's been doing op-eds.
[31:42.800 --> 31:50.120]  Here's a big whopper one for you today, Bill Gates is not secretly plotting microchips
[31:50.120 --> 31:57.800]  in a coronavirus vaccine, misinformation and conspiracy theories are dangerous for everyone.
[31:57.800 --> 32:02.440]  And they do the old fashioned thing of take one thing he's doing for global satellite
[32:02.440 --> 32:09.960]  5G controlled cryptocurrency where you wear a chip or a wristband or a watch and then
[32:09.960 --> 32:14.360]  it tracks what you do and when you carry out the task as told, like a robot, you get some
[32:14.360 --> 32:20.080]  more cheese there in your mousetrap.
[32:20.080 --> 32:22.520]  They then go, oh, that's not an implantable chip.
[32:22.520 --> 32:31.080]  When he's got all these other programs, like ID 2020 and a bunch of others, where it's
[32:31.080 --> 32:38.200]  a tape you put on your wrist or hand that has little micro glass that has silicon readable
[32:38.200 --> 32:40.840]  nanochips in them.
[32:40.840 --> 32:45.680]  And Bill and Melinda Gates has funded multiple programs in China and the United States and
[32:45.680 --> 32:46.680]  MIT to do this.
[32:46.680 --> 32:50.760]  And I'll show you a clip and show you some quotes and news articles on that here in a
[32:50.760 --> 32:51.760]  moment.
[32:51.760 --> 32:53.280]  But this is the games they play.
[32:53.280 --> 32:57.880]  They're all over the news saying you need a chip or a medical license to be able to
[32:57.880 --> 33:04.080]  travel in the future and the lockdown is never going to end till we have a vaccine.
[33:04.080 --> 33:14.560]  And then Bill Gates funded all these other programs for weather control and 5G surveillance
[33:14.560 --> 33:24.200]  and blocking out the sun and all these weird programs to have special passes to leave your
[33:24.200 --> 33:26.560]  home or driverless cars.
[33:26.560 --> 33:33.000]  He's building the post human world that the next phase is a giant panoptychonic prison,
[33:33.000 --> 33:39.480]  a prison planet, and that's there as a straight jacket to lead us into the depopulation agenda
[33:39.480 --> 33:43.120]  which again he admits he heads up.
[33:43.120 --> 33:49.360]  Bill Gates wants a world government to carry out world depopulation and don't forget they
[33:49.360 --> 33:52.160]  have the new Jeffrey Epstein documentary series out on Netflix.
[33:52.160 --> 33:54.160]  I watched the whole thing.
[33:54.160 --> 33:57.920]  That's six hours or I'll never get back.
[33:57.920 --> 34:04.680]  Full whitewash, nothing about Bill Gates, nothing about how it's an international spy ring for
[34:04.680 --> 34:08.320]  blackmail, nothing about how they kill kids, nothing about how they have a secret breeding
[34:08.320 --> 34:15.440]  program at Zorro Ranch where they implant these women with surrogate babies.
[34:15.440 --> 34:16.440]  The word is clones.
[34:16.440 --> 34:17.440]  Oh yeah, you're a billionaire.
[34:17.440 --> 34:18.440]  What do you want?
[34:18.440 --> 34:19.440]  You're a clone.
[34:19.440 --> 34:27.800]  That's been known for a long time because Epstein and others shot their mouths off.
[34:27.800 --> 34:42.920]  So I'm going to get to the rest of the big news breaking with Jeffrey Epstein and Bill
[34:42.920 --> 34:47.080]  Gates flying around on his airplane and all the rest of it, staying at his home in Paris,
[34:47.080 --> 34:53.320]  staying at his home in the UK, staying at his home in New Mexico, staying at Epstein's
[34:53.320 --> 34:58.000]  home in New York and lying and saying he never been to his house.
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.400]  Turns out he basically lives there.
[35:01.400 --> 35:05.480]  That's who these freaks are, these psychotics.
[35:05.480 --> 35:11.800]  Epstein was just a butler who ran private, pervert, pedophile hotels.
[35:11.800 --> 35:16.440]  That's why he had seven story buildings in New York worth 75 million.
[35:16.440 --> 35:22.400]  That's why he had giant palatial estates in Pennsylvania and California and New Mexico
[35:22.400 --> 35:28.160]  and Europe because he stocked them full of women and little girls.
[35:28.160 --> 35:36.960]  And worse, they like to have snuff parties in the temples.
[35:36.960 --> 35:39.000]  You don't just think they screw little kids, do you?
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.800]  They like to chop them up.
[35:40.800 --> 35:42.840]  They like them to beg for mommy.
[35:42.840 --> 35:48.520]  And what has General Flynn's respected lawyer said, she's talked to the NYPD face to face,
[35:48.520 --> 35:53.720]  the officers that saw it and they said the videos on Weiner's laptop are so horrible
[35:53.720 --> 36:00.200]  that they would vomit and could only watch one a day.
[36:00.200 --> 36:05.000]  Well when you're watching toddlers get electrocuted and stuff, it's not fun if you're not a Satanist.
[36:05.000 --> 36:11.000]  Okay, so remember, these guys want to put stuff in your body though because they want
[36:11.000 --> 36:12.000]  to rape your soul.
[36:12.000 --> 36:13.680]  It's all about rape.
[36:13.680 --> 36:18.880]  So here's a little clip from James Corbett's excellent part three series on Bill Gates
[36:18.880 --> 36:22.480]  and the control grid and you can pull up all these clips from MIT.
[36:22.480 --> 36:23.480]  Here it is.
[36:23.480 --> 36:29.480]  Two ways to permanently store and record the vaccination information of each individual.
[36:29.480 --> 36:33.400]  The result of their research was a new vaccine delivery method.
[36:33.400 --> 36:38.360]  They found that by using dissolvable microneedles that deliver patterns of near infrared light
[36:38.360 --> 36:42.880]  emitting microparticles to the skin, they could create particle patterns in the skin
[36:42.880 --> 36:47.840]  of vaccine recipients which are invisible to the eye but can be imaged using modified
[36:47.840 --> 36:49.640]  smartphones.
[36:49.640 --> 36:54.800]  Rice University describes the quantum dot tags left behind by the microneedles as something
[36:54.800 --> 36:58.080]  like a barcode tattoo.
[36:58.080 --> 37:00.600]  So who was behind this development?
[37:00.600 --> 37:05.600]  As lead researcher Kevin McHugh explains, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation came
[37:05.600 --> 37:11.680]  to us and said, hey, we have a real problem, knowing who's vaccinated.
[37:11.680 --> 37:14.940]  So our idea was to put the record on the person.
[37:14.940 --> 37:19.920]  This way, later on, people can scan over the area to see what vaccines have been administered
[37:19.920 --> 37:23.080]  and give only the ones still needed.
[37:23.080 --> 37:26.920]  The microparticles that form the fluorescent quantum dot tags are delivered along with
[37:26.920 --> 37:31.120]  the vaccine, but they cannot be delivered by a traditional syringe.
[37:31.120 --> 37:36.080]  Instead, they must be delivered by a patch of microneedles made from a mixture of dissolvable
[37:36.080 --> 37:42.000]  sugar and a polymer called PVA as well as the quantum dot dye in the vaccine.
[37:42.000 --> 37:47.120]  It should be no surprise then that big pharma vaccine manufacturers, in their scramble to
[37:47.120 --> 37:52.960]  produce the coronavirus vaccine that Gates assures us is necessary to go back to normal,
[37:52.960 --> 37:58.880]  have turned to a novel vaccine delivery method, a dissolvable microneedle array patch.
[37:58.880 --> 38:03.120]  And again, that's just rice, MIT is way ahead of it, also fun about Bill and Melinda Gates.
[38:03.120 --> 38:08.520]  So again, big articles about how he doesn't want that, but there they are telling you
[38:08.520 --> 38:10.240]  that's who funded them to do it.
[38:10.240 --> 38:12.080]  This man is a criminal liar.
[38:12.080 --> 38:15.400]  And let's just show the news today of him being a criminal liar.
[38:15.400 --> 38:20.080]  Researchers retract study linking malaria pill to heart attack, Bloomberg, Bill and
[38:20.080 --> 38:24.600]  Melinda Gates financed the study saying that hydroxychloricin would kill you and help no
[38:24.600 --> 38:25.600]  one.
[38:25.600 --> 38:29.120]  Well, everyone that saw that said it's a fraud who funded, oh, Bill Gates, of course,
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.440]  turns out it's all fraud, no data, totally made up, scientific scam.
[38:33.440 --> 38:36.800]  Just like the test that said everybody had covered around the country, where their facility
[38:36.800 --> 38:40.680]  now shut down, total fraud.
[38:40.680 --> 38:45.440]  Amazon censors former New York Times reporters book exposing COVID-19 lockdowns.
[38:45.440 --> 38:50.320]  Hours after Elon Musk says time to break up Amazon after company bans, Alex Bernstein's
[38:50.320 --> 38:55.040]  book on unreported truths about COVID-19, which shows government documents and proof
[38:55.040 --> 38:58.680]  it's a total absolute giant hoax by Bill and Melinda Gates.
[38:58.680 --> 39:02.880]  Now after massive pressure, Washington Post reports Amazon reverses ban on book critical
[39:02.880 --> 39:09.280]  of coronavirus lockdown after the decision is blasted by many, including Elon Musk.
[39:09.280 --> 39:15.280]  Meanwhile, man sickest in his life after taking experimental vaccine, Robert F. Kennedy writes
[39:15.280 --> 39:16.600]  he links to it all.
[39:16.600 --> 39:22.000]  The guy hired by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Fauci to be the spokesperson for the vaccine
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.280]  took it and almost died and was paralyzed might want to go read that for yourself.
[39:26.280 --> 39:31.760]  Meanwhile, former MI6 said says coronavirus is manmade, released from a lab.
[39:31.760 --> 39:33.560]  And why is that important?
[39:33.560 --> 39:35.080]  Because they own it.
[39:35.080 --> 39:36.080]  It's a simulant.
[39:36.080 --> 39:37.080]  You do catch it.
[39:37.080 --> 39:38.080]  You do spread it.
[39:38.080 --> 39:39.400]  You do come up positive for it.
[39:39.400 --> 39:44.520]  But unless you are totally deficient in key vitamins and minerals, you cannot even get
[39:44.520 --> 39:45.520]  sick from it.
[39:45.520 --> 39:50.720]  We'll be right back with breaking bombshells on this same subject.

[39:55.720 --> 40:05.520]  We have not done 60% off across the board in the history of info wars.
[40:05.520 --> 40:09.920]  But because things are so crazy, I'm offering the biggest sale in our history.
[40:09.920 --> 40:10.920]  It's a flash sale.

[40:14.960 --> 40:18.840]  products because I kind of feel like the Titanic is sinking.
[40:18.840 --> 40:23.600]  We need to have the funds in our bank account to fund the info war into the future.
[40:23.600 --> 40:27.480]  So take advantage of the looting, the rioting, the death, and the martial law by getting

[40:40.200 --> 40:41.200]  so much more.
[40:41.200 --> 40:47.640]  The mega flash sale, 60% off to fund the info war and save the republic or get prepared
[40:47.640 --> 40:51.440]  before everything burns down infowarstore.com.
[40:51.440 --> 40:53.080]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[40:53.080 --> 40:54.080]  They're worse than bad.
[40:54.080 --> 40:55.080]  They're crazy.
[40:55.080 --> 40:57.520]  That's a quote from the 1970s film network.
[40:57.520 --> 40:58.520]  Yeah.
[40:58.520 --> 40:59.520]  Things are really, really bad right now.
[40:59.520 --> 41:03.440]  We're in global martial law, villain milling the gates, U.N. operations trying to bankrupt
[41:03.440 --> 41:07.360]  America with their lockdown and their race riots, but people are coming together at this
[41:07.360 --> 41:08.360]  beautiful time.
[41:08.360 --> 41:09.360]  But I'll be honest with you.

[41:16.760 --> 41:17.760]  or breaking it.
[41:17.760 --> 41:21.160]  So the only sure bet is to sell everything we've got to make sure in case there's total
[41:21.160 --> 41:22.680]  breakdown on society in six months.
[41:22.680 --> 41:25.360]  We still have the funding to go more than six months in the next year.

[41:55.200 --> 41:58.200]  germs, toxins.
[41:58.200 --> 42:02.440]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[42:02.440 --> 42:06.880]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[42:06.880 --> 42:12.320]  The revolutionary Alexa peer breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against
[42:12.320 --> 42:15.400]  the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.

[42:52.720 --> 42:55.320]  The United States is not communist China.
[42:55.320 --> 42:58.240]  We don't have three million people in concentration camps.
[42:58.240 --> 43:00.120]  We don't blow up churches.
[43:00.120 --> 43:03.360]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[43:03.360 --> 43:09.600]  With all of the news, we see the U.N. billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media
[43:09.600 --> 43:12.680]  praising communist China for their response.
[43:12.680 --> 43:16.920]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has
[43:16.920 --> 43:20.080]  robots controlling people, well then gee, we've got to do that.
[43:20.080 --> 43:24.840]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio pass laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese
[43:24.840 --> 43:25.840]  virus.
[43:25.840 --> 43:29.240]  Well now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[43:29.240 --> 43:34.400]  People are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time because
[43:34.400 --> 43:38.360]  we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their
[43:38.360 --> 43:39.480]  power grab.
[43:39.480 --> 43:43.800]  The resistance lives at band.video and infohorsestore.com.
[43:43.800 --> 43:48.000]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats and then we'll be able to defeat their
[43:48.000 --> 43:55.120]  operation that much quicker.
[43:55.120 --> 44:12.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:12.880 --> 44:17.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[44:17.400 --> 44:21.400]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[44:21.400 --> 44:27.080]  So I want this to sink in to everybody.
[44:27.080 --> 44:33.680]  Bill Gates publicly funded the studies in England and the United States saying two and
[44:33.680 --> 44:36.560]  a half million dead Americans.
[44:36.560 --> 44:42.280]  He funded the studies all over the world putting out similar fake numbers.
[44:42.280 --> 44:46.840]  All of that was a total fraud.
[44:46.840 --> 44:53.120]  Then they financed testing kits in China and in the United States and the fact checkers
[44:53.120 --> 44:59.080]  worked for Bill and Linda Gates Foundation and run the Wuhan lab coronavirus research
[44:59.080 --> 45:04.320]  and run again the fact checking to control the American people so that we couldn't expose
[45:04.320 --> 45:06.120]  what they done.
[45:06.120 --> 45:10.040]  So they launched the crime, they launched the reporting, they launched the hysteria,
[45:10.040 --> 45:15.440]  they launched the fraudulent test, they control the lab, they control the Facebook, Twitter,
[45:15.440 --> 45:22.160]  Google, fact checkers who are then God.
[45:22.160 --> 45:26.920]  And so members of the Senate, medical doctors, hospital owners, Cedar Sinai come out and
[45:26.920 --> 45:32.720]  say this is baloney, here's our numbers and they get banned.
[45:32.720 --> 45:38.320]  So this is a corporate dictatorship, a corporate move and Bill Gates said it, months after
[45:38.320 --> 45:40.320]  I said it was clear.
[45:40.320 --> 45:47.920]  I just point that out because it's so obvious, on Colbert a month ago he said, oh this is
[45:47.920 --> 45:51.720]  just pretty much a drill, we're using this for the next big one that'll be a biological
[45:51.720 --> 45:54.320]  weapon from terrorists, it'll be much worse.
[45:54.320 --> 45:58.080]  And then him and Colbert start laughing and giggling.
[45:58.080 --> 46:03.000]  Like I heard your grandma's got cancer, oh I heard hundreds of millions of dollars.
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.280]  These are sickos flaunting it in your face.
[46:07.280 --> 46:10.520]  They're totally turned over to evil.
[46:10.520 --> 46:16.000]  And now, oh it comes out, doctors in New York and doctors in California and Texas and doctors
[46:16.000 --> 46:19.760]  in Australia and doctors in Israel and doctors in Russia and doctors in France and doctors
[46:19.760 --> 46:23.840]  in England and doctors in Scotland and doctors in Mexico and doctors in Brazil.
[46:23.840 --> 46:29.720]  Doctors everywhere, doctors in Africa, say we have basically 100% recovery rate when
[46:29.720 --> 46:33.000]  people get hydroxychloroquine with zinc.
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.520]  You can get sick on hydroxychloroquine without the zinc because it'll pull other stuff out
[46:37.520 --> 46:40.520]  of your cells and put it into your cells.
[46:40.520 --> 46:43.920]  And of course they financed the fraudulent study and we went and looked at it and said
[46:43.920 --> 46:49.280]  they don't even give their data but it was shown by the news, oh that hydroxychloroquine,
[46:49.280 --> 46:52.360]  that'll kill you.
[46:52.360 --> 46:56.560]  I even had family go, well I heard conflicting stuff Alex, you're not a doctor, you know,
[46:56.560 --> 47:02.040]  are you sure zinc's okay and I'm like, listen, here's the NIH website saying it's essential
[47:02.040 --> 47:07.080]  for cell division, cell operation and cell defense against viruses and my own family
[47:07.080 --> 47:12.680]  member went, wow, because people think it's like weird to be informed.
[47:12.680 --> 47:15.720]  It's weird to go read the study and find out Bill Gates funded it.
[47:15.720 --> 47:18.120]  It's weird to look at it and it has no data.
[47:18.120 --> 47:24.880]  So I told you two and a half months ago that that study was a fraud, it's now been withdrawn
[47:24.880 --> 47:27.200]  and is a total fraud.
[47:27.200 --> 47:31.000]  And again, I'm not up here saying I'm incredible, I'm smart.
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.800]  People used to all be like me.
[47:33.800 --> 47:39.280]  They went out, they did research, they checked in the things, they didn't believe the establishment.
[47:39.280 --> 47:43.760]  If Bill Gates told you the sky was blue, you should question it.
[47:43.760 --> 47:50.120]  And then a prestigious investigative journalist puts all this together in a book, who's published
[47:50.120 --> 47:55.440]  books at Amazon before, they just agreed to let you publish it.
[47:55.440 --> 48:00.680]  They've got Nambla on their publishing books about having sex with children, that's okay.
[48:00.680 --> 48:05.480]  Black Queen Storytime is okay, but you, as a famous former New York Times investigative
[48:05.480 --> 48:10.800]  journalist who's highly respected, you aren't allowed to put your book out here.
[48:10.800 --> 48:15.800]  Because they said the fat checkers have said it is not approved by who and they said, it's
[48:15.800 --> 48:19.440]  in the article, the WHO.
[48:19.440 --> 48:27.760]  So the United Nations World Health Organization almost exclusively funded by Bill Gates and
[48:27.760 --> 48:37.640]  the Communist Chinese, since Trump pulled out, rightfully so, is in control of what
[48:37.640 --> 48:43.200]  books you can read.
[48:43.200 --> 48:45.080]  And Elon Musk is 100% right.
[48:45.080 --> 48:47.880]  Time to break up Amazon after company bans.
[48:47.880 --> 48:53.360]  Alex Berlinson's book on unreported truths about COVID-19.
[48:53.360 --> 48:54.840]  They're wrecking the economy.
[48:54.840 --> 48:56.240]  They're even bankrupting Walmart.
[48:56.240 --> 49:01.000]  It's a giant, huge monopoly.
[49:01.000 --> 49:07.200]  He got $30 billion in bailouts, Jeff Bezos.
[49:07.200 --> 49:15.360]  He gives a charity each year,.01%.
[49:15.360 --> 49:21.640]  That's like the average person giving, I think it says here $87 a year.
[49:21.640 --> 49:27.440]  But oh, he funds Black Lives Matter though, he's a liberal.
[49:27.440 --> 49:30.600]  And he's going to have the Davos group tell you about inequities and how to get rid of
[49:30.600 --> 49:37.160]  capitalism and have a better system and how we just get rid of all the police.
[49:37.160 --> 49:38.480]  Everything will be wonderful then.
[49:38.480 --> 49:45.000]  Well, yeah, if we went back to everybody being armed and having the sheriff's department
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.640]  that vetted people to then go out and go after criminals, but you get rid of the police now,
[49:48.640 --> 49:53.680]  this country will disintegrate in every blue area because the citizens aren't armed.
[49:53.680 --> 49:54.680]  The criminals are.
[49:54.680 --> 49:57.440]  And that's the next thing I'm going to cover when we start the next hour.
[49:57.440 --> 50:01.160]  Then I'm going to go to your phone calls on all these subjects.
[50:01.160 --> 50:05.480]  But here's the biggest thing I've said in months and I just want this to go across to all of
[50:05.480 --> 50:10.240]  you for myself, for you, for your family, wherever you are in the world, wherever you are listening
[50:10.240 --> 50:14.920]  to us right now.
[50:14.920 --> 50:18.520]  People are still wearing masks all over the world.
[50:18.520 --> 50:23.880]  Many businesses and companies.
[50:23.880 --> 50:27.400]  You guys got a mic open or you got an audio feed feeding into me.
[50:27.400 --> 50:31.720]  I thought it'd go away after a while, but it's not.
[50:31.720 --> 50:33.520]  So let me just get back to what I was saying.
[50:33.520 --> 50:35.520]  I'm not mad at the crew.
[50:35.520 --> 50:40.000]  I'm just I'm really stressed out about all this and I've seen comments online.
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.880]  Oh, Jones, when he does this thing like, oh, I don't know, I can do the show now.
[50:43.880 --> 50:47.720]  It's for theatric purposes or it's just to build up suspense.
[50:47.720 --> 50:54.800]  No, it's not.
[50:54.800 --> 50:59.880]  They're putting in permanent medical martial law with a psychotic person that ran Jeffrey
[50:59.880 --> 51:01.400]  Epstein's operation.
[51:01.400 --> 51:02.400]  That's what Bill Gates did.
[51:02.400 --> 51:10.080]  He ran Jeffrey Epstein's operation to compromise scientists across the board with blackmail
[51:10.080 --> 51:15.360]  for sex with underage women and children and snuff films so they could scientifically
[51:15.360 --> 51:21.960]  take over and have a fake scientific consensus ahead of pushing giant frauds like this.
[51:21.960 --> 51:26.280]  And if you think it's funny that that monster is coming at you with his poison vaccines
[51:26.280 --> 51:30.080]  and his nano chips, in fact, I didn't even get to that in my stack.
[51:30.080 --> 51:33.640]  It must have gotten out of my stack.
[51:33.640 --> 51:38.740]  You guys reprint me all the articles about the poison vaccines they found everywhere
[51:38.740 --> 51:40.680]  filled with mysterious nanoparticles.
[51:40.680 --> 51:42.360]  Here it is.
[51:42.360 --> 51:45.680]  You're doing all this on purpose, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:45.680 --> 51:50.120]  I was told by a DARPA scientist 20 years ago that they were putting nanoparticles to track
[51:50.120 --> 51:51.120]  people with vaccines.
[51:51.120 --> 51:52.120]  I thought it was crazy.
[51:52.120 --> 51:55.800]  Now it's out in the news today.
[51:55.800 --> 52:09.360]  So let me just put it to you this way as best I can.
[52:09.360 --> 52:18.280]  This isn't going to be business as usual with the leftist and the globalist and they're
[52:18.280 --> 52:21.440]  pushing their agenda, but, you know, we kind of push them back.
[52:21.440 --> 52:24.680]  They're going to get total power and control, and we're going to defeat them and reverse
[52:24.680 --> 52:26.080]  them.
[52:26.080 --> 52:27.360]  They've launched their main attack.
[52:27.360 --> 52:28.440]  They've launched their main assault.
[52:28.440 --> 52:30.440]  The New World Order is here.
[52:30.440 --> 52:32.160]  And they're going to bring back the mask.
[52:32.160 --> 52:34.160]  They're going to bring back the lockdowns forever.
[52:34.160 --> 52:38.080]  It's in the Davos Group's own report that came out two days ago, calling it the Great
[52:38.080 --> 52:39.080]  Reset.
[52:39.080 --> 52:40.960]  It's over.
[52:40.960 --> 52:44.680]  And once they've got you poor in destitute, they're going to go to town on you with medical
[52:44.680 --> 52:46.840]  tyranny and forced inoculations.
[52:46.840 --> 52:50.400]  And so when you see people wearing masks or you see people playing along with this crap,
[52:50.400 --> 52:55.200]  you got to explain to them that it's a giant hoax and a confirmed fraud, because you see
[52:55.200 --> 52:57.080]  they launched the riots as phase two.
[52:57.080 --> 52:59.240]  They already had those ready.
[52:59.240 --> 53:04.240]  As soon as the COVID peaked and the pushback came back and all the doctors and scientists
[53:04.240 --> 53:06.280]  came out and said, this is a total fraud.
[53:06.280 --> 53:10.840]  And as a consensus formed that it was the biggest hoax in history, we already had burning
[53:10.840 --> 53:15.640]  buildings all over the world in the West with third world populations being trained
[53:15.640 --> 53:18.360]  to assault by the UN.
[53:18.360 --> 53:22.520]  And so we moved on to that so we never had the backlash.
[53:22.520 --> 53:26.880]  And then we'll just be into the election and COVID cases will be back, they'll claim,
[53:26.880 --> 53:31.400]  and they'll hype that back up and have all their zombies go out wearing their mask again.
[53:31.400 --> 53:32.560]  And it's all leftist.
[53:32.560 --> 53:33.560]  It's all followers.
[53:33.560 --> 53:41.880]  It's all captives of this that are in a mesmerized state and believe that they're winners and
[53:41.880 --> 53:47.160]  believe that they're part of this ruling class when they're actually unconscious zombies.
[53:47.160 --> 53:52.200]  You wonder why a leftist black, white, old, young Hispanic are disheveled and walk weird
[53:52.200 --> 53:56.560]  and look like zombies because they've been put in a trance state by the television and
[53:56.560 --> 53:58.600]  the culture of suspended disbelief.
[53:58.600 --> 53:59.760]  They've been programmed.
[53:59.760 --> 54:06.560]  These are weak people and more and more people are falling to mass psychosis, mob rule.
[54:06.560 --> 54:08.520]  This is a psychological warfare system.
[54:08.520 --> 54:11.440]  So when they look like zombies, don't laugh at them.
[54:11.440 --> 54:17.160]  They're dead eyed betas and they're dangerous and as everything falls apart around them,
[54:17.160 --> 54:20.840]  they don't ever blame themselves for being fools or their controllers.
[54:20.840 --> 54:26.000]  They blame you and as things get worse, it's your fault and they've got to destroy you.
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.480]  They've got to make you submit.
[54:27.480 --> 54:31.920]  They've got to dominate you or things won't get better like a drowning person will climb
[54:31.920 --> 54:34.840]  up on top of you and push you under the water.
[54:34.840 --> 54:35.840]  You understand?
[54:35.840 --> 54:41.600]  We're in all engraved danger.
[54:41.600 --> 54:46.600]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms
[54:46.600 --> 54:50.360]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[54:50.360 --> 54:54.280]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third
[54:54.280 --> 54:55.280]  world.
[54:55.280 --> 55:00.720]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going
[55:00.720 --> 55:01.720]  to be.
[55:01.720 --> 55:06.840]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex
[55:06.840 --> 55:07.840]  economy.
[55:07.840 --> 55:11.880]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[55:11.880 --> 55:17.160]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[55:17.160 --> 55:19.000]  They've admitted all of this.
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.120]  So remember, how does infowars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[55:25.120 --> 55:27.080]  things before they happen?
[55:27.080 --> 55:31.880]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes, it's dystopic
[55:31.880 --> 55:33.320]  and yes, it's scary.
[55:33.320 --> 55:37.480]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[55:37.480 --> 55:42.360]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[55:42.360 --> 55:47.600]  I've been fighting the globalists for 26 years and the evil side of me is just so tired of
[55:47.600 --> 55:52.480]  waiting and I'm so ready for physical war that I'm kind of happy about how bad things
[55:52.480 --> 55:57.040]  have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand up for the unborn babies
[55:57.040 --> 56:00.840]  that go along with the new world order, you're about to find out just how sick stuff is.
[56:00.840 --> 56:01.840]  But you know what?
[56:01.840 --> 56:03.080]  The average person is still asleep.
[56:03.080 --> 56:04.880]  They don't deserve what's happening to them.
[56:04.880 --> 56:09.680]  So I'm actually sick about what's unfolding right now and I just want to turn things around
[56:09.680 --> 56:10.680]  but you know what?
[56:10.680 --> 56:12.640]  I can't do that without you.
[56:12.640 --> 56:14.040]  I can't get out of this mess.
[56:14.040 --> 56:18.160]  I can't get out of this stranglehold I'm in unless you decide to get out of as well.
[56:18.160 --> 56:22.040]  We're all in this together and so if you just realize how important you are, when you just
[56:22.040 --> 56:25.080]  tell people about the local radio stations you're listening to, local TV stations, when
[56:25.080 --> 56:28.960]  you just spread the word about infowords.com forward slash show, when you just buy the
[56:28.960 --> 56:31.760]  products at infowordsstore.com, it changes the world.
[56:31.760 --> 56:37.480]  Right now we've got a special that's about to end 60% off across the board flash sale
[56:37.480 --> 56:45.160]  that funds the M4 and gets you great products you need at the same time, infowordsstore.com.
[56:45.160 --> 56:53.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:53.960 --> 56:57.480]  I will give the number out, start of the next segment, we're going to have open phones.
[56:57.480 --> 57:00.920]  The project Veritas knocked it out of the park again with an undercover inside Antifa
[57:00.920 --> 57:01.920]  for several years.
[57:01.920 --> 57:07.160]  When you hear just the sliminess and evil of these Soros, Ewan funded turd baskets,
[57:07.160 --> 57:08.160]  it just makes you sick.
[57:08.160 --> 57:09.920]  Here it is.
[57:09.920 --> 57:17.640]  I've been undercover with real city Antifa since July of 2000.
[57:17.640 --> 57:24.760]  Depending on the setting, if I were to be caught or found out in a setting where I am
[57:24.760 --> 57:28.120]  present with them, it couldn't escalate to violence against me.
[57:28.120 --> 57:33.440]  Don't be that f***ing guy with the goddamn spiked brass knuckles getting photos taken
[57:33.440 --> 57:34.440]  of you.
[57:34.440 --> 57:37.440]  Police are going to be like perfect, we can prosecute these f***ers, look up on the data.
[57:37.440 --> 57:44.440]  But I don't think we're not, but we need f***ing money.
[58:07.440 --> 58:23.800]  So, currently I am a prospect for real city Antifa and I am about halfway through the
[58:23.800 --> 58:34.800]  prospecting process to become a full-fledged member of Antifa.
[58:34.800 --> 58:39.560]  If you ruin their day, if you heckle them, you make them feel like they look ridiculous
[58:39.560 --> 58:46.120]  and make them feel outnumbered and therefore their whole, yeah, yeah, America, Trump thing
[58:46.120 --> 58:48.080]  is going to go by the wayside.
[58:48.080 --> 58:55.400]  They reached out to me through Proton Mail and we went back and forth and there was an
[58:55.400 --> 58:58.160]  interview set to meet up in Portland.
[58:58.160 --> 59:05.920]  So to verify that it was me, they had me wear a white shirt and have a water bottle and
[59:05.920 --> 59:14.600]  show up at a Starbucks where a person was going to ID me and approach me and asked who
[59:14.600 --> 59:20.800]  I was and I told them and I followed them to the destination where the interview was
[59:20.800 --> 59:23.360]  going to be held.
[59:23.360 --> 59:29.360]  There we went to a place called Imperial.
[59:29.360 --> 59:34.760]  They were getting this tradecraft from someone else, someone with much more experience, someone
[59:34.760 --> 59:36.680]  who did this for her living.
[59:36.680 --> 59:45.720]  Caroline, which is the founder of RCA, moved to Sweden with her husband who is a dual citizen.
[59:45.720 --> 59:54.520]  So there's a back and forth with a European connection.
[59:54.520 --> 1:00:00.320]  Roe City, Antifa holds required lectures for prospecting members in secret, in other
[1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:04.360]  words, bookstore, before they open.
[1:00:04.360 --> 1:00:11.160]  And as part of their security culture, they require us to put our phones in the bathroom
[1:00:11.160 --> 1:00:13.160]  and next door.
[1:00:13.160 --> 1:00:17.640]  This bathroom is not only away from the main room where the lecture is taking place, but
[1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:24.960]  also has a fan that muffles any sound from the room.
[1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:29.520]  The whole goal of this is to get out there and do dangerous things as safely as possible.
[1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:34.000]  How violent is Antifa or RCA particular?
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:39.520]  Practice things like an eye gouge, it takes very little pressure to injure someone's eyes.
[1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:44.760]  They do not hesitate to either push back or incite some kind of violence.
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:50.680]  In our classes and in our meetings, before we do any sort of demonstration or black block,
[1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:54.240]  we talk about weapons detail and what we carry and what we should have.
[1:00:54.240 --> 1:00:55.240]  What is black block?
[1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:57.160]  Well, this is black block right now.
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:05.840]  The term is used to a tactic in which individuals conceal their identity to look uniform so
[1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:09.280]  that no one can be identified in an act of a crime.
[1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:17.400]  With RCA, it seems much more structured, almost like a company or like a business, so I feel
[1:01:17.400 --> 1:01:23.400]  like there is some type of outside funding influence or resources being used.
[1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:26.640]  Consider destroying your enemy, not like this.
[1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:32.560]  I love Project Veritas, but I have given James O'Keefe two years ago the internal secret
[1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:36.040]  documents we got from a brother of an Antifa guy when his brother got in trouble, they
[1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:39.160]  found it all in the house and that is that manager level guy.
[1:01:39.160 --> 1:01:42.440]  He gets direct orders from Soros, but no one will go after him.
[1:01:42.440 --> 1:01:43.440]  No one will touch it.
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:44.440]  The FBI, no one.
[1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:46.320]  They're just going to let him burn down and murder everybody.
[1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:47.320]  It's so funny.
[1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:57.800]  Hello, GCP, here to tell you not to leave the info world.com, do not get high quality
[1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:03.480]  products and see people selling off a crossable flash sale.
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:05.480]  They are not made in China.
[1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:08.080]  They do not have fentanyl or lead.
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:14.600]  They are high quality, super male vitality, knock out sleep support, brain force, biotus,
[1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:22.600]  aluminium, chill force, also micro oil, so why was your X3 DNA was blue, leaving the
[1:02:22.600 --> 1:02:27.120]  fence in terrible force, X3 available as well.
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:35.120]  Listen to me dirty Americans, do not go to info wars, store.com for 60% off flash sale.
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:40.440]  You go bankrupt and die, you have no speech, info wars is weak.
[1:02:40.440 --> 1:03:10.160]  Do not take advantage of 60% off, GG Pink says, oh, we hurt you, oh, Joe Biden, good.
[1:03:10.160 --> 1:03:16.280]  It is Friday, June 5th, 2020, with 150 days out from the historic election.
[1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:20.600]  Okay, I really like the shows where I take your calls.
[1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:24.240]  There's been so much news and so many guests and sometimes I don't carry out what I'd like
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:29.680]  to do, but today we're going to take a lot of your calls in the second and third hour
[1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:34.280]  ahead of Dr. Nick Baggage taking over in the war room with Owen Schroyer at 3pm central
[1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:40.120]  here on the info wars, pre speech, pro America, pro human network, and of course Bandai Video
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:42.480]  which they hope you don't visit and hope you don't share.
[1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:46.000]  So obviously do that, it pisses off the globalist, control freaks are doing everything they
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:50.280]  can to demoralize us, they make us hate our country and hate ourselves because they know
[1:03:50.280 --> 1:03:54.960]  they're losing and time is running out for them.
[1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:59.600]  But I want to ask listeners a question because I really want your insight.
[1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:04.880]  You're free to call in, I'd love to hear your view on the riots and the destabilization
[1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:11.600]  and the admitted plan, PBS, Atlantic monthly, Reuters, they're all like, yay, it's a revolution
[1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:17.320]  against fascism and the police, your local government, are the fascist in Trump.
[1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:19.360]  Get them.
[1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:23.320]  And then the governor is refusing to call out the guard and when people attack the police
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:26.960]  and the police fight back, they're calling it police brutality.
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:30.000]  This is an attempted communist overthrow of the country.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:36.120]  But it's billionaire oligarchs financing a communist playbook run by George Soros, run
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:38.360]  by Alexander Soros on record.
[1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:43.080]  They publicly fund them, but there's a Justice Department investigation about who might be
[1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:48.280]  behind it and could it be organized and we know exactly who runs it and who controls
[1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:49.280]  it.
[1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:58.080]  It's funded by Soros, funded by the DNC and then they basically have the academics and
[1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:02.960]  their minions go run it, they sign agreements as case officers and they go out and recruit
[1:05:02.960 --> 1:05:05.440]  people from the community.
[1:05:05.440 --> 1:05:08.720]  And down the lowest level will hire crackheads, meth heads, you name it, to go out and beat
[1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:09.720]  people up.
[1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:10.720]  That's what this is.
[1:05:10.720 --> 1:05:15.520]  They didn't used to do that just five years ago, but they couldn't get black people on
[1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:16.520]  average to riot.
[1:05:16.520 --> 1:05:17.520]  That's in the documents.
[1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:21.680]  The 2015 documents had a Baltimore, Maryland, the martial law documents that we've been
[1:05:21.680 --> 1:05:26.040]  covering basically every week since then.
[1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:29.000]  Those are the Death Star plans that just fell into our hands.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:34.560]  So I watched the great Veritas report with undercover people going, yeah, the head guy
[1:05:34.560 --> 1:05:40.160]  ran it like a business, like a military operation and it just seemed like they were so coordinated.
[1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:43.120]  Yes, we know who runs it.
[1:05:43.120 --> 1:05:50.360]  When you've got that top of the mafia chart, the Don and the deputy Don and the capos and
[1:05:50.360 --> 1:05:54.400]  then you've got the soldiers.
[1:05:54.400 --> 1:06:01.080]  We have the organizational chart and we just, I just sit here year after year reading headlines
[1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:06.840]  like Trump thinks Twitter is censoring.
[1:06:06.840 --> 1:06:13.680]  That's like saying Alex Jones thinks Antifa where black outfits, Mickey Mouse is an animated
[1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:14.680]  mouse.
[1:06:14.680 --> 1:06:20.560]  Jones claims exit signs are usually red stop signs are usually read Jones claims.
[1:06:20.560 --> 1:06:25.760]  I mean, we just sit here always at the first level of like, is there a world government
[1:06:25.760 --> 1:06:30.600]  or the communist Chinese financing the universities and financing Twitter and Google?
[1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:31.600]  Yes, they are.
[1:06:31.600 --> 1:06:33.520]  It's all on record.
[1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:34.520]  Arrest them.
[1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:35.520]  It's illegal.
[1:06:35.520 --> 1:06:38.920]  It's foreign espionage.
[1:06:38.920 --> 1:06:42.680]  I mean, they've had the FBI crawling all over me for three and a half years trying to set
[1:06:42.680 --> 1:06:46.840]  me up as a Russian agent and I'm not a liberty to get into it, but I've been in to see the
[1:06:46.840 --> 1:06:47.840]  FBI.
[1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:51.400]  The whole nine yards folks, okay?
[1:06:51.400 --> 1:06:57.440]  Whole nine yards, literally you see congressional hearings saying I am a Russian agent.
[1:06:57.440 --> 1:07:00.680]  I am a Chinese jet pilot from Mars.
[1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:03.080]  I am a ham sandwich.
[1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:08.360]  This is this is what they try to put me in jail, try to put my poor dad in jail because
[1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:11.640]  Roger Stone worked here and I'm not a victim.
[1:07:11.640 --> 1:07:15.680]  I'm just telling you, yeah, there's been a coup in this country by a bunch of crooks.
[1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:23.320]  You bet there has been and Americans need to stop being so naive about it.
[1:07:23.320 --> 1:07:25.840]  So here's what I'm trying to get at.
[1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:29.400]  You have the whole COVID-19 hoax that has completely imploded the wheels came off a
[1:07:29.400 --> 1:07:30.400]  long time ago.
[1:07:30.400 --> 1:07:38.360]  Every facet and organized fraud from the models to the test to them tried to block studies
[1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:42.000]  of therapeutics that are 100% viable.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:47.920]  This has been a huge exercise in blacking out the truth and not letting medical doctors
[1:07:47.920 --> 1:07:50.800]  and others come out and tell the truth.
[1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:52.940]  I mean, this has been draconian.
[1:07:52.940 --> 1:07:57.080]  This has been from Alex Jones getting censored two years ago to the president's Twitter
[1:07:57.080 --> 1:08:01.440]  being censored and just outrageousness upon outrageousness.
[1:08:01.440 --> 1:08:05.440]  So we've got all that going on.
[1:08:05.440 --> 1:08:11.360]  And then right as the Italian government and the British government and the German Interior
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:18.640]  Ministry secret panel says this thing is a total fraud, but it's manmade.
[1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:24.160]  The Australian research labs go it's manmade, but it doesn't kill a lot of people, but it
[1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:26.320]  spreads really easy.
[1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:29.360]  And they said exactly what Francis Boyle said here four months ago.
[1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:37.080]  He said in late January, five months ago, he said it was probably a weaponized vaccine,
[1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:40.400]  but to have a vaccine, you've got to make the weapon that got out.
[1:08:40.400 --> 1:08:44.180]  But regardless, that's why it does kill some people.
[1:08:44.180 --> 1:08:48.760]  It's a bad pneumonia, but it is manmade, which is what really scared us up front.
[1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:52.840]  But because it's a vaccine, live vaccine ingredient that was being tested that got out, which
[1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:57.040]  we know they were testing in the lab, then they tried to say none of that was even going
[1:08:57.040 --> 1:08:58.040]  on.
[1:08:58.040 --> 1:09:02.200]  But now even the Australian universities to put their finger on it saying, looks like
[1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:06.480]  it was an unattenuated live virus in a vaccine trial.
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:11.120]  Well, that's happened before we're vaccines have caused pandemics, but again, it's a very
[1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:15.400]  light pandemic, but there are hundreds of thousands of deaths in the United States every
[1:09:15.400 --> 1:09:17.440]  year from pneumonia and other things combined.
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:21.800]  So there were some deaths, but most of them were gunshot wounds and other things.
[1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:24.240]  They attributed that to that.
[1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:29.560]  People that died in car wrecks, all of it are out of the COVID-19 death list.
[1:09:29.560 --> 1:09:36.040]  George Floyd's been added to it when he obviously died of a mixture of fentanyl and asphyxiation.
[1:09:36.040 --> 1:09:39.120]  So now that that's all happened, well, what were they going to do?
[1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:43.160]  Well, they just every day have some cop doing something wrong.
[1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:44.160]  There's millions of cops.
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:45.560]  There's 350 million of us.
[1:09:45.560 --> 1:09:47.080]  There's cameras everywhere now.
[1:09:47.080 --> 1:09:49.200]  That stuff always is going on.
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:50.320]  Bad things are always happening.
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:51.320]  There's bad cops, good cops.
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:53.720]  There's good doctors, bad doctors.
[1:09:53.720 --> 1:10:00.240]  Good teachers, bad teachers, good farmers, bad farmers, bad mothers, good mothers.
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:04.720]  And so they could just cherry pick any event that was questionable in Georgia and Minnesota,
[1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:09.480]  they put all up and boom, no, it's going to explode by having police stand down when it
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:10.480]  took place.
[1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:12.400]  And now that's confirmed.
[1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:14.720]  But why was it done?
[1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:21.660]  It was done to cover up the COVID, the COVID controls in place, the vaccines getting made.
[1:10:21.660 --> 1:10:27.400]  It was done to cover up the flashback, the rollback, the blowback.
[1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:30.560]  Now that all these medical doctors were coming out against the censorship and now that people
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:35.560]  were exposing it and now that the models were proven to be frauds and that Bill Gates was
[1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:40.320]  having his vaccine trial shut down and Bill Gates was having his vaccine, you know, system
[1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:45.000]  research shut down and his testing facility shut down for fraud and Bill Gates was in
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.160]  so much trouble and this hadn't gone the way he wanted.
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:52.000]  They went ahead and activated the riots they had planned for July and August already set
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:55.600]  up, already ready according to Black Lives Matter and Antifa.
[1:10:55.600 --> 1:10:59.480]  They were going to get stirred up at the RNC and DNC and had groups already ready to provocateur
[1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:03.880]  police so they could get the events they wanted and have the clashes and have Charlottesville
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:06.680]  2.0 on steroids.
[1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:12.480]  So understanding how they ran this scam is critical.
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:18.840]  And we have to go back now to COVID-19 and we have to expose the fact that it's a total
[1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:24.280]  fraud and push it back out there to the top of people's consciousness or they're never
[1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:25.840]  going to turn the economy back on.
[1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:29.800]  They're announcing all the major movie chains are either closing, part of their facilities
[1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:30.800]  are never reopening.
[1:11:30.800 --> 1:11:32.400]  You go, oh, who cares about that?
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:34.080]  The restaurants around them go under.
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:35.960]  Folks, we're a service economy.
[1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:37.520]  They de-industrialized us.
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:40.320]  They promised us we'd have a service economy so they'd make us dependent.
[1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:45.840]  Now they're going to take our service economy away.
[1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:47.480]  We have to end this fraud.
[1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:48.640]  It's martial law.
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:50.280]  They're going to cycle it on and off forever.
[1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:51.680]  They're going to have forced inoculations.
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:53.800]  They're going to have medical IDs to travel.
[1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:54.800]  It's all there.
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:58.120]  We must kill the COVID hoax.
[1:11:58.120 --> 1:12:02.760]  It's just as important as exposing the current fraud with the rioting and the rest of it,
[1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:05.040]  which we'll get to next segment.
[1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:16.720]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALIX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALIX or your country code
[1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:19.800]  512-646-1776.
[1:12:19.800 --> 1:12:24.640]  I want to hear from you about how we expose COVID, how we expose the hoax, how we prosecute
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:29.040]  the people that are trying to create this death at Mayhem and have already killed more
[1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:33.880]  people on these riots than have died in the last year of black folks being shot by police.
[1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:36.680]  And we've got the police called to disband the police departments.
[1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:39.640]  Do you have any idea what that's going to look like?
[1:12:39.640 --> 1:12:45.640]  We're going to break it all down straight ahead on the other side of the global transmission.
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:50.680]  Whatever you can do to tell people about the live feeds at News Wars.
[1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:55.600]  We're living in insanely dangerous times, and I told folks going back three months ago,
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:58.960]  I'm not buying storable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:01.960]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:06.360]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages
[1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:10.080]  and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States, and it's even worse in
[1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:11.080]  the third world.
[1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:13.760]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:18.760]  But with the election fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:22.800]  and everything else is going on, now is the time to get storable foods.
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:27.040]  Because they'll last for 25 years, they're in easily totable bags, it's high quality
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:30.000]  food, and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  And it funds the InfoWars.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:34.960]  So we have storable food available again, infowarsstore.com, or call toll-free, triple
[1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:38.880]  A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, or whatever you do, get prepared and get ready.
[1:13:38.880 --> 1:13:43.080]  Because the globalists want you dependent on them, they do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:48.880]  Get your storable food at infowarsstore.com right now while you still can.
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:53.960]  I had told listeners back in December that I would never go to 50% off again because
[1:13:53.960 --> 1:13:58.280]  our markup isn't big enough selling the products to be able to fund ourselves doing that.
[1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:03.400]  But I've got to tell you, things are so crazy, the world is so insane, my gut level instinct
[1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:08.800]  is to sell out everything we've got in the warehouse to make sure we can stay on air
[1:14:08.800 --> 1:14:13.160]  through the election in 150 days, because we only got money to operate a few months
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:14.160]  right now.
[1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:16.400]  So these are great products you and your family need.
[1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:19.400]  It funds the InfoWars, get them all now.

[1:14:51.440 --> 1:15:05.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:10.600]  Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., David Knight knocks it out of the park on
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:17.080]  our TV and radio satellites and the audio and video feeds of the Information War, it's
[1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:18.080]  Alex Jones.
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:25.640]  And you'll find those feeds at NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com,
[1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:38.320]  Bandod video, then this broadcast with yours truly, Alex Jones, then Owen Schreuer, 3 to
[1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:42.400]  6 p.m. Central with the War Room, then I'll come back Sundays and I'll be here live this
[1:15:42.400 --> 1:15:44.680]  Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central, Lord Willing.
[1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:51.520]  Okay, let's go ahead and get into this and then I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:59.440]  All over the United States in blue cities and blue zones, the mayors and the police
[1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:05.200]  chiefs are globalists following the Soros U.N. playbook and they're saying the police
[1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:09.640]  are bad, stand down, don't stop rioters, don't stop looters.
[1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:12.600]  When somebody comes in somebody's business and physically attacks them and robs them
[1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:17.800]  and they shoot them, the police come and arrest them like in Omaha.
[1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:23.760]  The guy was being attacked in his business, he shot the guy and they arrested him.
[1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:27.440]  This is a plan to take down civilization, that's why it's happening in Australia, it's
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:32.520]  happening in Europe, it's happening in the U.K., it's happening everywhere in Canada
[1:16:32.520 --> 1:16:38.520]  because it's about the communists promised at the universities that you're taking over.
[1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:43.720]  They went and got these degrees to be part of the cult.
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:48.280]  They don't get the liberal arts education.
[1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:52.600]  But Tucker Carlson, there's a big article on infowars.com that lays it all out, just
[1:16:52.600 --> 1:16:56.720]  gets better and better as times get worse and worse, it brings out the best and strong
[1:16:56.720 --> 1:16:57.720]  people.
[1:16:57.720 --> 1:17:03.480]  He lays out that mega corporations are the ones financing Nike and PepsiCo and all the
[1:17:03.480 --> 1:17:04.480]  rest of them.
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:16.880]  Back on screen please, put that infowars article back up for me please, I want to show people
[1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:21.840]  to have a line with Tucker Carlson, no problem, I have my phone, I have my phone, I'll show
[1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:23.280]  it on my phone.
[1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:30.160]  So again, there it is, corporations funding riots that destroy small businesses and it's
[1:17:30.160 --> 1:17:35.320]  such an important article, I'm going to read it at the start of the next hour and then
[1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:38.720]  continue with your phone calls.
[1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:44.840]  But that's what this is, the lockdown and then the riots and all of it is to demoralize
[1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:49.440]  you in that project Veritas, internal anti-privileged, what does he say?
[1:17:49.440 --> 1:17:53.000]  We want to make you depressed, we want to make them sad, we don't want them saying rah,
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:58.680]  rah America, we want them to give up, we want to demoralize them.
[1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:03.960]  That's all this is, the ugly art, the ugly literature, the drag queen story times, pedophiles
[1:18:03.960 --> 1:18:09.760]  going after your kids, dudes dressed like women on the street, simulating cutting babies out
[1:18:09.760 --> 1:18:15.600]  of their stomachs, all the ugly TV, all the murder, all the death, all the drugs, all
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:24.920]  the fentanyl, all of the suicide is designed to demoralize you.
[1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:30.560]  But all it is, and they admit it is, so don't let them demoralize you.
[1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:34.600]  Go out when they say they're going to beat you up if you have free speech and you defend
[1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:36.840]  yourself when they attack you.
[1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:42.200]  Go out and support freedom and build others up and understand that we're not going under
[1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:51.000]  learned helplessness here.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:54.440]  But look at this article out of Australia and the very same thing is done at Evergreen
[1:18:54.440 --> 1:18:59.960]  College on the West Coast and other colleges around the country where they teach people
[1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:06.160]  that whites are inherently bad and it's communist white professors literally teaching people
[1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:09.960]  that this is the way to go and now they've actually found black people around the country
[1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:14.880]  to actually now lead these events, countless videos telling them you are inherently bad
[1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:23.960]  because you are white and you are to serve black people and keep your mouth shut.
[1:19:23.960 --> 1:19:29.120]  This is the official Black Lives Matter of Melbourne, again they bring in populations
[1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:33.520]  from outside the area, teach the populations to hate each other and then say police, even
[1:19:33.520 --> 1:19:39.600]  though most of them are minority in Melbourne, aren't even allowed to carry out their job
[1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:40.600]  or their racist.
[1:19:40.600 --> 1:19:44.680]  So you make the invading force the victim.
[1:19:44.680 --> 1:19:48.800]  Important information for this Saturday protest is officially put out by Black Lives Matter
[1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:50.440]  with 40,000 members.
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:55.400]  Black folks guide to protesting, copy and paste, do not share.
[1:19:55.400 --> 1:19:59.760]  If you are a white person, consider joining a protest this week.
[1:19:59.760 --> 1:20:02.920]  Here is a list of rules put together for you.
[1:20:02.920 --> 1:20:06.360]  Friends of color, if they have forgotten anything, please add.
[1:20:06.360 --> 1:20:10.760]  Number one, follow calls only.
[1:20:10.760 --> 1:20:13.920]  Do not initiate or lead calls, that means keep your mouth shut.
[1:20:13.920 --> 1:20:17.320]  Your job is to follow and add your voice when it is called for.
[1:20:17.320 --> 1:20:21.200]  Number two, do not take selfies.
[1:20:21.200 --> 1:20:24.240]  Ask to take pictures or videos of individuals.
[1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:26.760]  You are there to witness only.
[1:20:26.760 --> 1:20:28.520]  Film the police as much as possible.
[1:20:28.520 --> 1:20:33.400]  Your goal is documentation to ensure the true narrative is told.
[1:20:33.400 --> 1:20:35.160]  Number three, be helpful.
[1:20:35.160 --> 1:20:39.280]  Hand out water and snacks, make sure protest leaders are hydrated and fed.
[1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:41.560]  Oh, take care of the leaders.
[1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:43.800]  This is exhausting work.
[1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:45.960]  Help keep their energy up.
[1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:47.880]  Number four, follow directions.
[1:20:47.880 --> 1:20:52.880]  If a Black person tells you to do something, you do it immediately without question.
[1:20:52.880 --> 1:20:57.160]  You respect the authority and the decisions of the Black protesters at all times.
[1:20:57.160 --> 1:20:59.560]  This is a new class system.
[1:20:59.560 --> 1:21:03.480]  Number five, stay in the back until you are called forward.
[1:21:03.480 --> 1:21:10.200]  If you hear white people to the front, white people in front or allies to the front, step
[1:21:10.200 --> 1:21:15.800]  forward and link arms with other white people to form a human shield.
[1:21:15.800 --> 1:21:18.520]  Man, this is incredible.
[1:21:18.520 --> 1:21:22.560]  Number six, when you are at the front, you are silent.
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:23.560]  This is in all caps.
[1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:26.120]  When you are at the front, you are silent.
[1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:27.480]  I should have been reading this right.
[1:21:27.480 --> 1:21:29.720]  Stay in the back until you are called.
[1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:30.720]  Follow directions.
[1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:31.720]  Follow calls only.
[1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:37.440]  Do not take selfies.
[1:21:37.440 --> 1:21:38.680]  Remain calm at all times.
[1:21:38.680 --> 1:21:40.840]  This is difficult work.
[1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:44.240]  You will be emotional and your system will be flooded with adrenaline.
[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:47.360]  Remember, this is life and death for the protesters.
[1:21:47.360 --> 1:21:48.660]  Save your emotions for home.
[1:21:48.660 --> 1:21:49.660]  Do not agitate.
[1:21:49.660 --> 1:21:51.160]  This is not a game.
[1:21:51.160 --> 1:21:53.000]  Joining a protest is a serious decision.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:56.040]  Make sure you are there for the right reason.
[1:21:56.040 --> 1:21:58.360]  Support the safety of Black protesters at all times.
[1:21:58.360 --> 1:22:00.360]  Copy and paste out late.
[1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:02.360]  Is that clear, scumbag?
[1:22:02.360 --> 1:22:04.720]  I didn't have that part.
[1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:10.600]  This is cult brainwashing and this is standard operating procedure.
[1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:14.320]  Look at this poor little three-year-old white girl told she is privileged and bad by her
[1:22:14.320 --> 1:22:16.600]  very parents.
[1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:22.280]  That's how sick and evil this is and it just goes on from there.
[1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:27.080]  I'll cover more of this after I take your phone calls, but then, meanwhile, it revealed
[1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:30.840]  Philadelphia police told to protect rioters, not neighborhoods.
[1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:32.240]  That's now official.
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:37.440]  Los Angeles to strip over $100 million from police budget redirect to communities of
[1:22:37.440 --> 1:22:39.840]  color.
[1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:41.920]  These are being robbed across Europe by the Islamists.
[1:22:41.920 --> 1:22:42.920]  It's all there.
[1:22:42.920 --> 1:22:47.640]  But the thing I wanted to hit after I take your phone calls is this.
[1:22:47.640 --> 1:22:55.480]  The way mob rule works to create martial law atmosphere so that if Trump doesn't act, we
[1:22:55.480 --> 1:22:59.840]  go under leftist martial law regardless, just like they did with the leftist cities activating
[1:22:59.840 --> 1:23:03.280]  to shut down all the facilities.
[1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:06.840]  So Trump had to then act or it looked like he was not caring about the COVID.
[1:23:06.840 --> 1:23:07.840]  That's the psychology.
[1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:12.400]  Well, now we have martial law by mob rule and by the left and by the blue city is doing
[1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:13.400]  nothing.
[1:23:13.400 --> 1:23:14.840]  So when Trump acts, he's a fascist.
[1:23:14.840 --> 1:23:16.680]  When he doesn't act, he's bad.
[1:23:16.680 --> 1:23:18.480]  This is the plan to drive him out 25th Amendment.
[1:23:18.480 --> 1:23:21.760]  All right, we're going to come right back, ladies and gentlemen, and go right to your
[1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:23.440]  phone calls directly.
[1:23:23.440 --> 1:23:28.160]  And then I've got the Tucker Carlson piece that is so critical and I've got this breakdown
[1:23:28.160 --> 1:23:30.560]  of how the new older actually operates and how to stop them.
[1:23:30.560 --> 1:23:33.600]  And then I said I'd get to this hour, I'll have to get to it towards the end of the next
[1:23:33.600 --> 1:23:34.600]  hour.
[1:23:34.600 --> 1:23:38.880]  This is a special world government plan to bring in total collapse permanently and how
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:42.280]  great it is has been announced by the Davos group.
[1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:44.200]  It's called the Great Reset.
[1:23:44.200 --> 1:23:45.200]  We'll be right back.
[1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:46.680]  Stay with us.
[1:23:46.680 --> 1:23:52.160]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the
[1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:55.120]  globalist out of their countries.
[1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:59.600]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people
[1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:04.960]  that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying
[1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:06.920]  essential services.
[1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:12.080]  This is an attempt to have society collapse and the globalists, as they've done in the
[1:24:12.080 --> 1:24:14.840]  third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:20.600]  They must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank and the EU openly saying they fund
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:21.600]  the police.
[1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:23.080]  The police have a lot of problems.
[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:24.480]  We all have a lot of problems.
[1:24:24.480 --> 1:24:27.200]  But this is our government and our local vocabulary.
[1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:31.880]  Believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country, they are going to put in a real
[1:24:31.880 --> 1:24:34.160]  police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:38.760]  The globalists believe Communist China is the model of the world and they are orchestrating
[1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:40.080]  this entire thing.
[1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:45.240]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed in full wars
[1:24:45.240 --> 1:24:46.240]  dot com.
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:52.280]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:57.280]  an elk at, say, 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:05.080]  50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards, they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:06.080]  through their veins.
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:10.560]  But all of a sudden, they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over and
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:11.560]  they die.
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:14.280]  Then you go back and haul them back in.
[1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:17.680]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now.
[1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:24.160]  And that's what the economic numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart
[1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:28.680]  and for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:32.200]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead according
[1:25:32.200 --> 1:25:37.120]  to the UN and I believe their numbers because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:38.960]  to depopulate the third world.
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:42.120]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:45.680]  a bunch of suckers and you bought into something bigger than what Hitler did.
[1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:50.880]  Hey guys, Rob Dew here with infowarsstore.com and I want to tell you about something that
[1:25:50.880 --> 1:25:54.800]  I think has really helped me out and I think can help you out too, especially if you have
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:25:57.440]  any problems sleeping and that's knockout.
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:01.840]  Let's face it, our life patterns have been disrupted by this lockdown, this government
[1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:05.520]  imposed imprisonment and it has definitely affected my sleep schedule.
[1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:07.200]  But one thing that has helped is knockout.
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:11.040]  I take one pill about an hour before I want to go to bed and boom, I get a great night's
[1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:12.040]  sleep.
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:16.640]  On this Memorial Day, I took two of them fell asleep about 1 a.m., woke up at 8 a.m., ready
[1:26:16.640 --> 1:26:17.640]  to go.
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:21.040]  It really has made a difference in my life and it can make a difference in your life
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:22.040]  too.
[1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:23.440]  If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch.
[1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:25.440]  If you get great sleep, you're going to be on point.
[1:26:25.440 --> 1:26:26.680]  You're going to be mentally focused.
[1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:31.400]  You're going to be ready to take on the day and right now knockout is 50% off.
[1:26:31.400 --> 1:26:33.240]  It's less than $15 a bottle.
[1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:34.600]  You get 30 capsules.
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:35.600]  Give it a try today.
[1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:40.280]  It's at a great price right now and it can really help you get the sleep you need, especially
[1:26:40.280 --> 1:26:41.720]  in these tough times.
[1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:50.520]  It's knockout and it's available at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:27:19.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:35.640]  It's a really good show.
[1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:40.820]  But since then, these mega corporations have taken over all the media and you just don't
[1:27:40.820 --> 1:27:46.520]  see this information anywhere, except out of the mouths of the Club of Rome, of the
[1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:48.600]  Debo's group, and of the big corporations.
[1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:57.800]  That's why you see every major corporation from Walmart to PepsiCo to Nike coming out
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:04.140]  and saying, we do not support traditional families, they're bad.
[1:28:04.140 --> 1:28:11.840]  And it's good to break up civilization.
[1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:14.000]  Glad you guys found that, print me that article.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:21.320]  I said 2002, that's when it went super viral, I guess, broken 2001 in April.
[1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:28.000]  But they actually got the IMF World Bank documents, where they go in and foment rioting and distressed
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:33.040]  economies and foment things with the media, then things collapse and then the real police
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:34.360]  state comes in.
[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:37.240]  This is so incredibly cold-blooded.
[1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:43.840]  All right, I'm going to go to your phone calls and then next hour I'm going to hit these
[1:28:43.840 --> 1:28:54.840]  definitions and how they tie into this, oligarchy, the definition of oligarchy, the definition
[1:28:54.840 --> 1:29:02.720]  of terrorism, the definition of slavery, the definition of submission, the definition
[1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:10.560]  of blockade, the definition of siege, the definition of learned helplessness and how
[1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:21.560]  they're using this on us, the social contract, the Milgram experiment, the Stanford Prison
[1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:27.440]  experiment, Stockholm syndrome.
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:31.640]  You understand this, you understand exactly what these psychological warfare experts are
[1:29:31.640 --> 1:29:34.640]  doing, but what did Tucker Carlson hit last night?
[1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:46.200]  Quotes from Black Lives Matter saying we are here to end the traditional family.
[1:29:46.200 --> 1:29:50.000]  What have they done to the black community already by design that destroyed the black
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:52.320]  community, they destroyed the family?
[1:29:52.320 --> 1:29:57.240]  And now the mission of Black Lives Matter is Planned Parenthood, abort the black babies,
[1:29:57.240 --> 1:30:01.320]  back up the black families and abort your babies and break your ass up too.
[1:30:01.320 --> 1:30:07.920]  It's pure evil, they're running a pirate flag on us, they're run by a line criminal
[1:30:07.920 --> 1:30:08.920]  named Bill Gates.
[1:30:08.920 --> 1:30:14.920]  All right, I'm going to your calls, I just want to say this, I've been so busy with the
[1:30:14.920 --> 1:30:19.640]  riots and the insanity and all the attacks and everything that's going on that we've
[1:30:19.640 --> 1:30:24.280]  not ended the big mega cell we had, I just expanded it and just said, you know what,
[1:30:24.280 --> 1:30:28.320]  we've got level, I'm just think we should sell out basically of all our best sellers,
[1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:31.520]  even though it'll be months until we get more if we're lucky because the supply chain's
[1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:32.520]  breaking down.
[1:30:32.520 --> 1:30:37.520]  We need to have the funds inside the operation to be able to go through this year.
[1:30:37.520 --> 1:30:40.840]  And it's been working, but we're selling it at such discounts, we've got to sell a lot
[1:30:40.840 --> 1:30:44.840]  of product to fund ourselves, but it's been happening, but I got to tell you, at 60% off
[1:30:44.840 --> 1:30:51.400]  across the board flash sale, nymphomoreshore.com that's got to end Sunday, it will end.

[1:31:18.960 --> 1:31:23.080]  of stuff is already sold out, take advantage of it, experience these great products for
[1:31:23.080 --> 1:31:24.080]  yourself.

[1:31:27.560 --> 1:31:33.200]  know what Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus does, if you don't know what Knockout Sleep
[1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:40.160]  Support does, if you haven't taken the 8-pack Power Stack, all these discounts have to end
[1:31:40.160 --> 1:31:43.880]  because we've already sold out of more than 15 items, we're about to sell out of seven
[1:31:43.880 --> 1:31:47.600]  more of our best sellers, and then we're going to have to operate the next few months funding

[1:31:51.160 --> 1:31:55.160]  Crill Oil, Emirates Essentials, Living Defense, and Turbo Force, and a new product we're going
[1:31:55.160 --> 1:31:59.320]  to launch on Tuesday that I'm behind on launching, that's very exciting, but this is a great
[1:31:59.320 --> 1:32:00.480]  deal, please take advantage of it.
[1:32:00.480 --> 1:32:05.720]  Okay, I'm going to stop, I'm going to go to your calls, I appreciate you all, but to
[1:32:05.720 --> 1:32:08.680]  get to all of you, you don't need to thank me, just get to your point because I'm going
[1:32:08.680 --> 1:32:11.360]  to get to the next person because I respect you all.
[1:32:11.360 --> 1:32:14.480]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Northern Ireland, Mike, thanks for calling, thanks
[1:32:14.480 --> 1:32:17.080]  for holding your on the air, what do you think about what's happening?
[1:32:17.080 --> 1:32:21.440]  Totally discussed, and Alex, and what I'd like to say is it's not possible for the likes
[1:32:21.440 --> 1:32:27.320]  of Donald Trump to get together the best team of editors and researchers, put together a
[1:32:27.320 --> 1:32:32.200]  six to eight hour video, do a fireside chat explaining all the crap that these people
[1:32:32.200 --> 1:32:37.400]  have been doing for the past few years, and then if it is true that Obama signed an executive
[1:32:37.400 --> 1:32:42.640]  order for under certain situations that he could take over businesses, then why doesn't
[1:32:42.640 --> 1:32:49.200]  then Donald take over CNN and MSN, and then put that video on there and play it on a
[1:32:49.200 --> 1:32:50.200]  lip.
[1:32:50.200 --> 1:32:55.520]  That's right, Trump could do a couple of hours fireside chat where he presents all the hoaxes
[1:32:55.520 --> 1:33:01.720]  they've run, all the lies, expose Soros, expose Antifa, and they would all be done.
[1:33:01.720 --> 1:33:05.120]  You're absolutely right, and I know Trump more and more is moving towards doing that.
[1:33:05.120 --> 1:33:10.000]  It needs to be done, Alex, it needs to be done.
[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:11.520]  Can you believe how fast they're moving?
[1:33:11.520 --> 1:33:15.920]  I think they've got a shot at actually overthrowing everything, and people don't take this seriously.
[1:33:15.920 --> 1:33:19.160]  It's scary times, it's end times, I don't know what it is, it's gone on.
[1:33:19.160 --> 1:33:23.280]  I sometimes maybe think Donald's a part of it because if you look at the Elaminati card
[1:33:23.280 --> 1:33:28.200]  game, his face is in it, and I keep saying that people say enough is enough, and if you
[1:33:28.200 --> 1:33:34.760]  look at that card, it seems that his face with the card is enough is enough.
[1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:38.960]  I would love for you to check into that, and then I watch your show every day religiously,
[1:33:38.960 --> 1:33:42.720]  and then I'd like an update on that if it was at all possible.
[1:33:42.720 --> 1:33:45.200]  An update on what, sir?
[1:33:45.200 --> 1:33:47.240]  The Elaminati card game, one of the cards.
[1:33:47.240 --> 1:33:50.040]  You know, it's funny you bring that up.
[1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:54.280]  The guy that invented that made a bunch of board games and a bunch of video games, and
[1:33:54.280 --> 1:33:58.280]  he lives here in Austin, and I know people that know him, he has like a house, it's like
[1:33:58.280 --> 1:34:00.600]  a castle, and I've heard he's pretty nice.
[1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:02.880]  He's always refused to come on the show.
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:08.520]  He made that card game and stuff in like 95, 96 when I was first on air.
[1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:11.800]  And there's a guy that looks like Ron Paul, a guy that looks like me when I'm middle
[1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:14.800]  aged, and there is a guy that looks like Donald Trump.
[1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:16.160]  I'm not involved in any of this.
[1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:20.320]  I'm not in the Elaminati, but maybe the guy's got a time machine or something.
[1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:21.960]  What do you think?
[1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:22.960]  I don't know.
[1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:26.720]  I just know we live in crazy times and that we're totally deceived about everything.
[1:34:26.720 --> 1:34:33.320]  I don't know if there's time machines, aliens, you know, who knows, but Donald is at the,
[1:34:33.320 --> 1:34:39.360]  he's at the precipice of power, he has the potential to out everything, but he doesn't.
[1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:40.360]  Why?
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:41.360]  Is he a part of it?
[1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:43.360]  Does that card relate to him?
[1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:44.360]  Enough is enough.
[1:34:44.360 --> 1:34:48.760]  Well, I know he's been moving as hard as he can with the people he's got under him, but
[1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:49.760]  I wish he would do more.
[1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:51.760]  I hear what you're saying, brother, and I appreciate your call from Ireland.
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:54.720]  You know, I've meant to go over to that guy's office.
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:55.720]  I forget his name.
[1:34:55.720 --> 1:34:59.360]  He still has an office, still sells these board games, and I want to know how he knew
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:00.360]  all that stuff.
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:03.400]  What do sex makers on that predicted so much?
[1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:05.520]  I mean, people ask why I'm in that game.
[1:35:05.520 --> 1:35:09.400]  Well, that I think about like 2000 or so, they were big fans.
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:16.080]  There's a Donald Trump lookalike and they were putting me in there as well.
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:19.520]  All right, let's, let's not shortchange anybody.
[1:35:19.520 --> 1:35:29.560]  Let's go to break and come back with Justin Chris, Judy Bruno, chase the Patriot, Dixie,
[1:35:29.560 --> 1:35:30.560]  Justin Patriot, Russell.
[1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:31.560]  There's so many callers.
[1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:34.800]  I'm going to get to all of you on the other side.
[1:35:34.800 --> 1:35:40.400]  And then Tucker Carlson again is, is absolutely knocking it out of the park with just the
[1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:41.400]  truth.
[1:35:41.400 --> 1:35:43.280]  People say, man, it's like Tucker Carlson became Alex Jones.
[1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:45.160]  No, he's figured out how it works.
[1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:49.400]  And if you go look at these corporations, they all say they want to end the family.
[1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:55.960]  Well, statistics show you in the family three, four times the crime rate, suicide, drug use.
[1:35:55.960 --> 1:35:59.680]  They want to destroy you, they're evil.
[1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:03.960]  The globalist philosophy is to kill, steal and destroy.
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:08.760]  They're not malevolent.
[1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:11.120]  They're malevolent.
[1:36:11.120 --> 1:36:12.120]  They're bad.
[1:36:12.120 --> 1:36:15.560]  And if you study history, you see all these leaders that became psychotic and murderous
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:18.640]  in an evil group under them that did this, they decide to be evil.
[1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:19.640]  They don't want to be good.
[1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:21.440]  They don't want to fix things.
[1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:22.440]  That's too hard.
[1:36:22.440 --> 1:36:25.920]  They just decide to hate everybody and just ruin everything and kill everybody and not
[1:36:25.920 --> 1:36:26.920]  give a damn.
[1:36:26.920 --> 1:36:27.920]  Well, guess what?
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:32.320]  I'm not here to be run over or walked on like a doormat.
[1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:35.200]  And you new world order globalists are going for broke.
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:38.240]  A lot of it is because you've been exposed in your cornered.
[1:36:38.240 --> 1:36:39.240]  You're trying to fail forward.
[1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:40.240]  Well, guess what?
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:41.240]  You're going to burn in hell.
[1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:45.840]  They're right back with your phone calls.
[1:36:45.840 --> 1:36:48.360]  I'm always excited about Info Wars live products.
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:49.360]  They're amazing.
[1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:50.360]  They're cutting edge.
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:51.360]  You love them.
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:52.360]  I love them.
[1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:54.440]  And they find the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[1:36:54.440 --> 1:37:01.000]  We have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:08.760]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[1:37:08.760 --> 1:37:11.080]  And there's another innovation.
[1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:13.080]  It's the spray cap.
[1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:19.280]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes
[1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:20.640]  it in a really great way.
[1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:25.160]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face, it's got organic alcohol in
[1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:28.280]  it, so spray it right in your eyes, but I just love it.
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:31.000]  Personally, it has something that's a moisturizer as well.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:32.600]  So, this is a real innovation.
[1:37:32.600 --> 1:37:36.880]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:40.720]  essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:42.640]  It's so refreshing.
[1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:45.640]  This is a big winner.
[1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:47.640]  60% off.
[1:37:47.640 --> 1:37:49.640]  60% off.
[1:37:49.640 --> 1:37:51.640]  60% off.
[1:37:51.640 --> 1:37:53.640]  60% off.
[1:37:53.640 --> 1:38:00.360]  We have not done 60% off across the board in the history of Info Wars.
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:04.760]  But because things are so crazy, I'm offering the biggest sale in our history.
[1:38:04.760 --> 1:38:05.760]  It's a flash sale.
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:09.800]  I don't know if it's going to last a day, a week, but we're selling out of all the major
[1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:15.040]  products because I kind of feel like the Titanic is sinking and we need to have the funds in
[1:38:15.040 --> 1:38:18.440]  our bank account to fund the Info War into the future.
[1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:22.320]  So take advantage of the looting, the rioting, the death, and the martial law by getting
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:26.560]  the best prices ever at infowarstore.com.

[1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:30.560]  That's on films.
[1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:35.040]  That's on all the great supplements like Turbo Force, Living Defense, DNA Force Plus,
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:36.040]  and so much more.
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:42.480]  The mega flash sale, 60% off to fund the Info War and save the Republic or get prepared
[1:38:42.480 --> 1:38:52.680]  before everything burns down, infowarstore.com.
[1:38:52.680 --> 1:38:59.080]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax,
[1:38:59.080 --> 1:39:05.280]  and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:09.240]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next, but I can tell you, it's going to be
[1:39:09.240 --> 1:39:14.200]  a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[1:39:14.200 --> 1:39:19.960]  It's going to be an economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:22.560]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:26.840]  That's why now, more than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor Info Wars off
[1:39:26.840 --> 1:39:31.840]  the air because they knew that when they watched this whole situation, they didn't want the
[1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:38.080]  people's voice to still be on air, but thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[1:39:38.080 --> 1:39:44.560]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now, more than ever, InfoWars.com
[1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:46.560]  lives.
[1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:51.760]  I've been fighting the globalists for 26 years and the evil side of me is just so tired
[1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:56.680]  of waiting and I'm so ready for physical war that I'm kind of happy about how bad things
[1:39:56.680 --> 1:40:01.240]  have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand up for the unborn babies
[1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:05.000]  that go along with the New World Order, you're about to find out just how sick stuff is.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:08.320]  You know what, the average person is still asleep, they don't deserve what's happening
[1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:09.320]  to them.
[1:40:09.320 --> 1:40:13.840]  So I'm actually sick about what's unfolding right now and I just want to turn things around,
[1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:16.840]  but you know what, I can't do that without you.
[1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:18.240]  I can't get out of this mess.
[1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:22.360]  I can't get out of this stranglehold I'm in unless you decide to get out of as well.
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:26.240]  We're all in this together and so if you just realize how important you are, when you just
[1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:29.320]  tell people about the local radio stations you're listening to, local TV stations, when
[1:40:29.320 --> 1:40:34.960]  you just spread the word about InfoWars.com, when you just buy the products, InfoWars.com,
[1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:35.960]  it changes the world.
[1:40:35.960 --> 1:40:41.680]  Right now we've got a special that's about to end, 60% off across the board, flash sale
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:49.960]  that funds the InfoWars and gets you great products at the same time, InfoWars.com.
[1:40:49.960 --> 1:41:05.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:05.960 --> 1:41:06.960]  This is the InfoWars.
[1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:10.160]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I really appreciate everybody calling.
[1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:11.160]  We've got loaded phone lines.
[1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:17.360]  I want to get to everybody who is up next here.
[1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:20.360]  Let's go ahead and talk to Justin and Isle.
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:21.360]  Justin thanks for calling.
[1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:22.360]  Go ahead.
[1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:23.360]  Hey Alex.
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:24.360]  Ohio.
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:31.200]  Anyhow, I just want to do actually real quick, I've called in twice.
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:32.640]  I have not plugged in any of your products.
[1:41:32.640 --> 1:41:37.480]  I wanted to say real quick about bodies, 66 year old father had been able to make a fist
[1:41:37.480 --> 1:41:43.360]  in either hand for three plus years after three weeks or almost three weeks of taking
[1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:52.760]  these, the arthritis in not only his hands, but other places has tremendously decreased.
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:57.560]  So I love your iodine products and everything, but bodies has done just wonders for him.
[1:41:57.560 --> 1:41:58.840]  So thank you very much for that.
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:41:59.840]  Well, thank you brother.
[1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:03.920]  We set out and went to four different big companies to find the strongest curcuminoid
[1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:05.680]  extract.
[1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:09.440]  So it says on the label, because that's what they make you do, just turmeric, but it's
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:14.760]  turmeric concentrate and it's very, very well known for its anti-inflammatory properties.
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:18.000]  So we're bringing you the very best we can and thank you so much, sir.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  It is amazing.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.200]  So real quick, I just wanted to touch on something.
[1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:26.760]  I did actually go to some of the protests related to the lockdown for COVID in Columbus
[1:42:26.760 --> 1:42:35.840]  and so quickly it changed into, you know, the protests slash riots for the whatever
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:41.800]  overall you want to label in these, but I just wanted to throw out there and I should
[1:42:41.800 --> 1:42:43.400]  probably apologize to Dave and Knight.
[1:42:43.400 --> 1:42:47.720]  I kind of went off on Twitter the other day, but I was just pointing out that, that I feel
[1:42:47.720 --> 1:42:55.640]  like a lot of people on our side of the fence are speaking about things like, like we wanted
[1:42:55.640 --> 1:43:00.080]  to go back to the way it was, but I'm not on that or in that group.
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:04.400]  I am so tired of the two-party system and I believe as long as the two-party system
[1:43:04.400 --> 1:43:11.240]  is here where one group can blame the other continuously, I don't see anything ever getting
[1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:15.120]  better for the actual Republic.
[1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:21.400]  So so yeah, I wanted to throw that out there and I do know that there are a lot of people,
[1:43:21.400 --> 1:43:27.440]  unfortunately, a lot of them that that engage in the violence and the looting and destruction
[1:43:27.440 --> 1:43:29.080]  of privacy and public property.
[1:43:29.080 --> 1:43:33.280]  It makes everybody else look bad, but there are some good people out there that have good
[1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:34.280]  motives.
[1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:39.440]  Justin in Ohio, I hear you and I appreciate your call, tell your father God bless.
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:43.840]  Obviously there are bad cops, obviously some departments are out of control, obviously there
[1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:49.800]  needs to be checks and balances, but the globalists are using the fact that people see police
[1:43:49.800 --> 1:43:54.920]  as the top of the government and that if you overthrow the police, you somehow fix things,
[1:43:54.920 --> 1:43:56.800]  all you've done is wreck society.
[1:43:56.800 --> 1:43:59.720]  I have the IMF World Bank documents right here.
[1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:01.480]  They do this all over the world.
[1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:03.600]  This is a plan.
[1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:09.240]  And so absolutely, I'm sick of the two parties, absolutely, I don't like a lot of Republicans,
[1:44:09.240 --> 1:44:14.320]  but right now we've got globalists trying to overthrow the entire country.
[1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:17.640]  And there are riots going on in Mexico suddenly everywhere.
[1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:24.000]  This is a global destabilization by the richest, most powerful people on earth.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:26.240]  And that's the issue at hand.
[1:44:26.240 --> 1:44:29.640]  And now the governors, I've got an article right here, let's get to it next hour, Utah
[1:44:29.640 --> 1:44:34.240]  National Guard troops deployed to DC evicted from hotel.
[1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:39.240]  Senator Mike Lee says he discovered 200 that were thrown out last night.
[1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:41.640]  Now he says it's 1200 confirmed.
[1:44:41.640 --> 1:44:46.000]  They literally say we don't want your kind here.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:49.400]  So the virtues signaling by corporations are we don't want police.
[1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:56.120]  We don't want military around Legos pulled all of its toys that have police in them.
[1:44:56.120 --> 1:44:58.040]  And now the left says that's not enough.
[1:44:58.040 --> 1:45:00.960]  We want fire department ones pulled.
[1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:04.200]  We want all and they're like, yes, we'll pull those too.
[1:45:04.200 --> 1:45:06.680]  Now the fire department's evil.
[1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:09.240]  You're like, wait, the left's all about big government.
[1:45:09.240 --> 1:45:16.320]  Not when they finally take over, they got everything.
[1:45:16.320 --> 1:45:21.960]  By the way, that's not satire if you just tuned in Lego has pulled all its toys with
[1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:23.600]  police in it.
[1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:24.800]  And they said that's not enough.
[1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:27.120]  And they gave a whole list now.
[1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:33.120]  One that just said doughnut shop because that's associated with police was pulled.
[1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:38.040]  The fire department ones were pulled.
[1:45:38.040 --> 1:45:41.640]  That's a cult folks and these corporations know what they're doing.
[1:45:41.640 --> 1:45:44.640]  They want to create a stampede.
[1:45:44.640 --> 1:45:45.640]  There it is.
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:47.800]  Leftist or angry that Lego hasn't virtue signal hard enough.
[1:45:47.800 --> 1:45:52.480]  They're like, you know, just pull the police, you pull the fire departments.
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:56.600]  All right, let's go back to your calls here.
[1:45:56.600 --> 1:45:59.880]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Canada.
[1:45:59.880 --> 1:46:00.880]  Chris.
[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:01.880]  Welcome.
[1:46:01.880 --> 1:46:02.880]  Hello.
[1:46:02.880 --> 1:46:03.880]  Yes, sir.
[1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:04.880]  Alex.
[1:46:04.880 --> 1:46:05.880]  Sure do.
[1:46:05.880 --> 1:46:06.880]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[1:46:06.880 --> 1:46:09.480]  I'll, I'll make a quick since I know you want to get through a lot.
[1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:11.000]  No, no, no, no, I want you to talk about comments.
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  You just don't have to thank me.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:13.400]  I want to thank you for calling brother.
[1:46:13.400 --> 1:46:14.400]  Go ahead.
[1:46:14.400 --> 1:46:15.400]  Oh, thanks.
[1:46:15.400 --> 1:46:16.400]  All right.
[1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:19.200]  So first of all, love the product, especially a super male vitality.
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:22.640]  Just wanted to give you a shout out on that great product.
[1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:27.840]  Secondly, it's a bit of a long story, so I'll just try to make it quick about while over
[1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:33.040]  a decade ago, I was teaching English overseas and I had an executive at one of these big
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:37.920]  Korean mega corporations that was my student and he was telling me all about this dot tag
[1:46:37.920 --> 1:46:38.920]  technology.
[1:46:38.920 --> 1:46:41.160]  I was thinking, why is this guy going on about this?
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:45.640]  He told me in the future, there would be scanners at every single airport and you wouldn't
[1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:47.800]  know they're there, but you'd walk through them.
[1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:51.880]  And if you were wearing like a Gucci bag or something like that, it didn't have one of
[1:46:51.880 --> 1:46:53.920]  these authentication dot tags on it.
[1:46:53.920 --> 1:46:59.040]  They pull you out of the line and they confiscate the bag and I said, well, what if it's your
[1:46:59.040 --> 1:47:00.040]  clothes?
[1:47:00.040 --> 1:47:03.520]  You're like, well, the law is going to be that they confiscate whatever is unauthenticated.
[1:47:03.520 --> 1:47:05.360]  And I thought, well, that sounds pretty bad.
[1:47:05.360 --> 1:47:10.160]  But then when I heard that Corbett report that you played earlier, just a snippet where
[1:47:10.160 --> 1:47:13.840]  that's actually the technology that's going to be the tattoo in these vaccines, it just
[1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:14.840]  clicked on me.
[1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:17.080]  Because what are all these looters taking?
[1:47:17.080 --> 1:47:19.640]  They're taking all this high end stuff.
[1:47:19.640 --> 1:47:22.840]  And this guy was telling me that they were already testing it.
[1:47:22.840 --> 1:47:27.240]  They'd already secretly been testing it for a long time and that it was companies like
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:29.640]  Louis Vuitton and Gucci that were leading the way.
[1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:32.080]  Yeah, that's another big point.
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:34.360]  It's even better than the tile technology.
[1:47:34.360 --> 1:47:35.360]  And you're right.
[1:47:35.360 --> 1:47:39.800]  Almost all the high end products for at least a decade have had hidden microchips inside
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:41.800]  of them.
[1:47:41.800 --> 1:47:46.040]  So think about this dot tag technology being on these products already because he was telling
[1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:48.920]  me they were already adopted on these products.
[1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:53.160]  Now you've got thousands of tens of thousands of millions of dollars worth of this material
[1:47:53.160 --> 1:47:54.160]  that's been stolen.
[1:47:54.160 --> 1:47:57.760]  And you've got the perfect rollout for these scanners on everybody's phone to find out
[1:47:57.760 --> 1:48:00.280]  if you're buying some goods or you're buying authentic goods.
[1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:01.280]  Oh, you're dead on.
[1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:04.920]  That's why Gates and all of them want this revolution of this micro tagging or what
[1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:09.840]  they call smart dust or the Internet of Things is to not just stop crime, but to stop any
[1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:14.880]  underground economy and to have total control and it'll all be enforced by robots.
[1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:16.040]  Excellent points.
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:19.400]  So, thanks again and God bless, Alex.
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:20.400]  Keep going.
[1:48:20.400 --> 1:48:21.400]  Hey, God bless you, brother.
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:25.160]  Real quick, just because you bring it up, Chris, we put out a powdered product that
[1:48:25.160 --> 1:48:28.680]  is good for male vitality and energy and stamina that's about three times stronger than Super
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:29.680]  Male.
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:34.320]  But Super Male is cold pressed and like wine aged then for six months and it does some
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:38.840]  weird thing that this company in Utah that makes it for us, they're a famous company,
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:42.600]  but I'm not going to put out their names, they don't get attacked.
[1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:45.040]  They say it doesn't destroy the essence of it.
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:49.840]  What does Super Male Vitality briefly do for you?
[1:48:49.840 --> 1:48:53.840]  It helps me, definitely helps me with just overall mood, it helps me with weight loss
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:58.880]  and I definitely get a better workout and I have used it with the other product.
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:03.080]  I'm not sure if you still sell it at Anthroplex, I have used it with that as well and you just
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:04.080]  feel like supercharged.
[1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:09.120]  Yeah, I mean, personally, Anthroplex was so strong I can't even take it, but it's apples
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:12.000]  and oranges and we are going to re-release Anthroplex.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  We ran out of it.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:16.160]  And that becomes another issue, sometimes when you've got these high quality ingredients,
[1:49:16.160 --> 1:49:19.600]  if you're not buying it from China, you can't even re-fulfill it.
[1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:20.600]  That's why we sell out of stuff.
[1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:22.160]  God bless you, I appreciate your call, sir.
[1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:27.440]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Mountain Patriot in the great state of Colorado.
[1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:29.360]  Welcome Mountain Patriot.
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:30.360]  Thank you, sir.
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:31.360]  Can you hear me okay?
[1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:32.360]  I sure can.
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:36.240]  I'll tell you what man, that alpha power is something else.
[1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:39.160]  That will, that is some high octane stuff.
[1:49:39.160 --> 1:49:44.360]  I'm out of it right now, I hope you get it back in because I really love it.
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:45.360]  We're working on it, brother.
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:48.800]  So what's on your mind dealing with the revolution that they're trying to launch?
[1:49:48.800 --> 1:49:53.800]  Well, I will say one quick thing earlier, you were talking about definitions and I just
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:49:56.960]  recalled an incident a few years back.
[1:49:56.960 --> 1:50:03.720]  I ran into this gal who worked at a lab in Boulder, Colorado and she worked with Amtrak.
[1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:08.280]  And we were talking and she told me she had a master's degree in biology and here she
[1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:15.280]  was at this lab working with Amtrak and something didn't add up, seemed, I don't know.
[1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:21.840]  So I just kind of challenged her and I said, well, what is your definition of science?
[1:50:21.840 --> 1:50:24.760]  She was a deer and a headlight man.
[1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:25.760]  She had no clue.
[1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:29.880]  She couldn't even give me a bad answer or a wrong answer.
[1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:32.680]  And it just shows what's going on nowadays.
[1:50:32.680 --> 1:50:37.440]  People don't even have the ability for critical thought or reason.
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:40.040]  Nobody even understands what science is anymore.
[1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:44.320]  But I've run into a lot of these people that work at these labs and they can't even talk
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:46.000]  a lot of them.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  And they don't even know what they're doing.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:50.840]  They're just like a robot that carries out a task and you're right.
[1:50:50.840 --> 1:50:53.360]  What we're watching is the breakdown of civilization.
[1:50:53.360 --> 1:50:57.800]  The world used to be a hard place and it was a vicious taskmaster.
[1:50:57.800 --> 1:51:01.720]  And now because we've had it so good, we're becoming a bunch of weak, stupid jellyfish,
[1:51:01.720 --> 1:51:04.640]  myself included and it scares the hell out of me.
[1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:08.520]  I had a mentor who described it this way.
[1:51:08.520 --> 1:51:10.160]  These people are not scientists.
[1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:17.360]  They're just technicians, which is basically another word for a bureaucrat.
[1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:19.400]  They just do what they're told.
[1:51:19.400 --> 1:51:23.840]  You called in about Revolution, Documentary, Ukraine on Fire and Oliver Stone.
[1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:26.360]  We're going to come back to you in two minutes and let you finish up, Mountain Patriot.
[1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:27.880]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:36.640]  Dixie, Judy, Bruno, Chase the Patriot, Anna, Russell, Hokusheil, everybody.
[1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:46.160]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[1:51:46.160 --> 1:51:53.920]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, Super Male Vitality, specifically
[1:51:53.920 --> 1:52:00.960]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[1:52:00.960 --> 1:52:01.960]  in males.
[1:52:01.960 --> 1:52:07.920]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:12.760]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:52:12.760 --> 1:52:20.160]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[1:52:20.160 --> 1:52:25.160]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:52:25.160 --> 1:52:26.760]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:52:26.760 --> 1:52:28.800]  Go to the InforWars store.
[1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:31.600]  Never been a better time than right now.
[1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:38.200]  Super Male Vitality at InforWarsStore.com.
[1:52:38.200 --> 1:52:40.440]  This is the end, my friends.
[1:52:40.440 --> 1:52:46.360]  My only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of everything that stands,
[1:52:46.360 --> 1:52:51.000]  the end, the safety, the delusion.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:56.680]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because there was only the mirage of safety.
[1:52:56.680 --> 1:53:01.640]  Movies and partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other
[1:53:01.640 --> 1:53:02.800]  people.
[1:53:02.800 --> 1:53:05.640]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[1:53:05.640 --> 1:53:09.400]  Just like the history book show, it's just like the Bible states.
[1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:13.640]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought
[1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:19.400]  into captivity because their people sold out to special interests that were infiltrated
[1:53:19.400 --> 1:53:22.400]  by spies, and then they were enslaved.
[1:53:22.400 --> 1:53:28.080]  We are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:30.320]  absolute bondage.
[1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:34.640]  InforWars has decided to fight for freedom, and InforWars has had great victory thanks
[1:53:34.640 --> 1:53:40.000]  to your support and your prayers.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:54:05.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:05.840 --> 1:54:06.840]  Welcome back, folks.
[1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:10.440]  You know, if I seem angry and upset, it's not with the listeners, it's not with the
[1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:11.440]  crew.
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:19.920]  I'm just upset about what's going on because this system is so predatory and so evil, and
[1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:27.720]  a handful of megabanks 120 years ago or so on record could not dominate Europe or the
[1:54:27.720 --> 1:54:28.720]  United States.
[1:54:28.720 --> 1:54:29.880]  People were wanting freedom.
[1:54:29.880 --> 1:54:31.440]  The serfs had just gotten their freedom.
[1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:35.320]  That was white slaves all over Russia and all over Europe.
[1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:38.800]  The abolitionists had banned slavery pretty much everywhere in the world except in the
[1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:45.760]  Middle East and Africa, and the average person was super literate.
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:48.040]  Even people that didn't even have high school diplomas could read.
[1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:51.240]  I mean, you try to read a newspaper from 100 years ago, 150 years ago.
[1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:56.480]  I mean, I can barely read them, and I've got a very high vocabulary, very high.
[1:54:56.480 --> 1:54:59.520]  And I try to read newspapers from 200 years ago.
[1:54:59.520 --> 1:55:04.240]  I can't even read them.
[1:55:04.240 --> 1:55:06.960]  And the big bankers got together, and they said, what are we going to do?
[1:55:06.960 --> 1:55:10.960]  I mean, I've read the letters of the National Banking Association here on air from like
[1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:16.600]  1889 and stuff saying, we're going to make education public, we're going to dumb these
[1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:18.480]  people down.
[1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:22.560]  And man, they've done it now, and then all these big corporations were financed by just
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:27.320]  a few big banks, the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, they own it all.
[1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:30.440]  And man, now they're just saying, we're getting rid of your families, we're getting rid of
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:33.760]  everything, and we're taking your wealth, and you're going to be a slave.
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:36.880]  And they're the damn enemy.
[1:55:36.880 --> 1:55:41.880]  We need to have our government break up these trusts and stop this crap, and liberalism
[1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:46.720]  and leftist garbage needs to be outlawed, because it's not a free speech system.
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:51.960]  It's about enslaving us, just like slavery got outlawed, this modern form of slavery
[1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:53.880]  better get outlawed.
[1:55:53.880 --> 1:56:02.320]  I'm a past man, and let me tell you, this is a normal behavior.
[1:56:02.320 --> 1:56:05.440]  The average person's like, thank you for getting pissed off.
[1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:08.000]  Well, thank you for getting pissed off.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.120]  We need to be pissed off for a damn reason.
[1:56:10.120 --> 1:56:14.920]  Why do you think Christians, 200 and something years ago, abolitionists were 1% of the population
[1:56:14.920 --> 1:56:19.840]  in 1800, and slavery was ended 60 something years later.
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:23.800]  It didn't mean there wasn't other evils had to be fixed, but people looked at other people
[1:56:23.800 --> 1:56:29.480]  being treated like slaves, and they knew it was evil, and they knew what happened to them.
[1:56:29.480 --> 1:56:32.720]  And we sit here and watch what the New World Order does, and now it places off against
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:33.720]  each other.
[1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:37.640]  We're in a lot of danger, and I don't know how much longer we'll even be able to be
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:38.880]  on the air to fight.
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:39.880]  It's so bad.
[1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:43.480]  I'm telling you, man, we're in a lot of trouble.
[1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:46.040]  It's like when you're getting your ass kicked, and nobody's coming to help you, you just
[1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:49.000]  got to get up and start stomping some ass.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  And I mean that as an allegory.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:52.440]  I don't want offensive violence.
[1:56:52.440 --> 1:56:54.120]  I'm saying you better get aggressive.
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:55.640]  Mountain man, you got a minute and a half.
[1:56:55.640 --> 1:56:56.640]  Thanks for holding over.
[1:56:56.640 --> 1:57:00.840]  I'll make your point about Ukraine on fire, Oliver Stone, you name it, go ahead.
[1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:03.800]  Science, algorithmic contraction of a database.
[1:57:03.800 --> 1:57:06.960]  It's never settled because the database is always growing.
[1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:10.400]  I just rewatched Ukraine on fire.
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:15.680]  The whole blueprint, the whole playbook, the same snake, it's all right there in front
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:16.680]  of everybody.
[1:57:16.680 --> 1:57:22.640]  These people are just absolutely incapable of seeing the light.
[1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:23.640]  It reminds me of the story.
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:24.640]  That's right.
[1:57:24.640 --> 1:57:29.840]  Globalists destabilized, cause riots, blow up the government, and then bring in a dictatorship.
[1:57:29.840 --> 1:57:34.920]  I read a story once about these explorers in early Africa, and they took these pygmies
[1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:38.240]  out of the jungle and used them as guides to climb.
[1:57:38.240 --> 1:57:40.360]  I believe it was Mount Tanzania.
[1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:45.600]  Well the pygmies got up on top of that peak, and they couldn't understand their whole
[1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:46.600]  lives.
[1:57:46.600 --> 1:57:47.600]  They'd been in the jungle.
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:51.320]  They'd never been able to see more than 20, 30 feet in front of their face.
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:55.720]  And they got up on that peak, and all of a sudden they could see all the animals down
[1:57:55.720 --> 1:57:58.640]  on the plains, on the Kalahari, and they couldn't understand it.
[1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:02.440]  They thought that they could reach out and grab the tiny little animals.
[1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:03.440]  They had no concept.
[1:58:03.440 --> 1:58:05.160]  They had no clue.
[1:58:05.160 --> 1:58:10.720]  People are living in their own tiny little bubbles in this jungle of confusion, and nobody
[1:58:10.720 --> 1:58:13.320]  has ever come to peak to see the big picture.
[1:58:13.320 --> 1:58:17.560]  I mean, people are just incapable of critical thought, or even...
[1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:22.560]  Brother, that's the perfect allegory, they've taken people that have been blind for 20 years
[1:58:22.560 --> 1:58:23.560]  now.
[1:58:23.560 --> 1:58:27.840]  They're able to put microchips in the brain and have people actually see optically, but
[1:58:27.840 --> 1:58:30.600]  they can't teach them because they never grew up and saw the shapes.
[1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:31.600]  They don't even know what it is.
[1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:37.200]  So even though they're now physically seeing, it doesn't work because they weren't born
[1:58:37.200 --> 1:58:41.040]  like a baby and slowly the brain programmed to be able to recognize it through the optic
[1:58:41.040 --> 1:58:42.040]  nerve.
[1:58:42.040 --> 1:58:44.800]  You made an incredibly good point.
[1:58:44.800 --> 1:58:49.880]  I had told listeners back in December that I would never go to 50% off again because
[1:58:49.880 --> 1:58:52.240]  our markup isn't big enough selling the products.
[1:58:52.240 --> 1:58:56.840]  We're able to fund ourselves doing that, but I got to tell you, things are so crazy.
[1:58:56.840 --> 1:58:58.160]  The world is so insane.
[1:58:58.160 --> 1:59:03.440]  My gut level instinct is sell out everything we've got in the warehouse to make sure we
[1:59:03.440 --> 1:59:08.600]  can stay on air through the election in 150 days because we only got money to operate
[1:59:08.600 --> 1:59:10.040]  a few months right now.
[1:59:10.040 --> 1:59:12.360]  So these are great products you and your family need.
[1:59:12.360 --> 1:59:15.320]  Funds the InfoWare, get them all now.
[1:59:15.320 --> 1:59:23.440]  These are staples, super male vitality, 60% off, knockout sleep support, 60% off, Rain

[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  to 60% off.

[1:59:39.960 --> 1:59:46.960]  off is the average sale, take advantage now and fund the InfoWare.
[2:00:09.960 --> 2:00:35.120]  I know you're here doing that as well and I salute you all and I thank you because you
[2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:38.500]  are the InfoWare and now.
[2:00:38.500 --> 2:00:44.720]  It's late in the game, we're still on air, still fighting with more credibility than
[2:00:44.720 --> 2:00:51.120]  ever because we were tracking what the globalists were actually saying and doing and now the
[2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:57.080]  New World Order is so pissed that our understanding of the system is being mainlined.
[2:00:57.080 --> 2:01:01.000]  From our perspective of the globalist actual battle plans, not from the perspective of
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:06.440]  the propaganda they put out at the grassroots against the public but from the high mountain
[2:01:06.440 --> 2:01:12.120]  vantage point of how the New World Order is actually operating and how this isn't just
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:18.360]  a mere chess game, this is a fight, this is life and death.
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:23.640]  Had another pin explode in my hand, this isn't some Rorschach blot or some secret code.
[2:01:23.640 --> 2:01:26.640]  Let's go ahead and go right back to your phone calls.
[2:01:26.640 --> 2:01:30.720]  Who's been holding the longest?
[2:01:30.720 --> 2:01:33.640]  I guess that would be Bruno and we'll go to Judy and Dixie.
[2:01:33.640 --> 2:01:35.440]  Bruno in Florida, thank you sir.
[2:01:35.440 --> 2:01:37.680]  How are you doing Alex?
[2:01:37.680 --> 2:01:40.240]  Man I am just blown away, how real it's all gotten.
[2:01:40.240 --> 2:01:47.040]  I know, I wanted to talk to you about how I think the left is going to sabotage George
[2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:55.640]  Floyd's case just so it doesn't get any justice, the officer gets caught free so then they
[2:01:55.640 --> 2:01:59.920]  can have the revolution that they want because then they will be able to blame the justice
[2:01:59.920 --> 2:02:00.920]  system.
[2:02:00.920 --> 2:02:04.560]  I agree and they're talking about that getting derailed before the election.
[2:02:04.560 --> 2:02:08.280]  Let me guess, they're overcharging them for what they can prove, is that what you're about
[2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:09.280]  to say?
[2:02:09.280 --> 2:02:13.200]  Yes sir, exactly and they want injustice.
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:20.600]  They want the officer to go free so then they can say that America is systematically racist.
[2:02:20.600 --> 2:02:27.880]  That's the end result that they want and just to add on the various videos that you showed,
[2:02:27.880 --> 2:02:33.800]  it's funny about like how Sweden keeps coming up in some of the conversations, their latest
[2:02:33.800 --> 2:02:40.160]  husband, he's from Sweden and I was listening, I don't remember where I listened to that
[2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:46.240]  Sweden, the Swedish government was involved in the African revolution, the Mandela revolution
[2:02:46.240 --> 2:02:52.520]  I think with money or whatever and Sweden didn't close down with the pandemic.
[2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:55.920]  What did they know about the pandemic that they decided not to shut down?
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:03:00.600]  Well that's right, the globalists, the communists are already in control of Sweden so why would
[2:03:00.600 --> 2:03:02.320]  they do that when they're already in full control?
[2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:03.320]  Why would they hurt themselves?
[2:03:03.320 --> 2:03:07.200]  And turn out they had the lowest death rate in Europe because it's all a hoax.
[2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:12.520]  Exactly, so those are my two thoughts, thank you so much Alex, I'm from Brazil and also
[2:03:12.520 --> 2:03:17.960]  I think the two party system is way better than what we have in Brazil, a bunch of parties
[2:03:17.960 --> 2:03:22.920]  that like once they go into the city and they mess it up then we don't know who to blame.
[2:03:22.920 --> 2:03:29.120]  At least here we know that in Minneapolis the democratic party has been in control over
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:35.480]  for 50 years so we can show like okay, you see they are the problem, in Brazil it's so
[2:03:35.480 --> 2:03:40.680]  hard because there's so many parties so I would rather stay with the two party system,
[2:03:40.680 --> 2:03:41.680]  it's a lot easier to do.
[2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:43.680]  Well I tell you, how awesome is Bolsonaro?
[2:03:43.680 --> 2:03:45.680]  Oh, I like him very much.
[2:03:45.680 --> 2:03:51.680]  Well I had a chance to meet his son and found out that one of my old producers never told
[2:03:51.680 --> 2:03:55.680]  me they called and they thought it was like a diss and I'm like no I never knew this happened,
[2:03:55.680 --> 2:04:01.560]  we went and found it in all the emails that they're huge fans, awesome folks and I'm gonna
[2:04:01.560 --> 2:04:05.800]  probably interview his dad here pretty soon, I'll leave it at that but Bolsonaro is even
[2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:09.000]  better than Trump, I mean I'll just say it, he just said this whole thing's a damn hoax
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:13.240]  up front, it's a bunch of crap but you're right and that'd be a two hour show, three
[2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:17.480]  hour show getting into parliamentary systems versus two party systems, I don't like the
[2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:22.800]  two parties, they become corrupt but the founders set it up so it would be very simple to know
[2:04:22.800 --> 2:04:28.520]  which side to choose when things happen for the separation of powers, then they use the
[2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:33.240]  separation of powers in government to make sure one party didn't get too much control
[2:04:33.240 --> 2:04:37.320]  but if you look at Germany, Merkel's been in power for 15 years or whatever because
[2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:42.040]  every time her party loses an election, a new coalition of others give her power because
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:47.160]  she's still in government and so exactly, and England's erect because of the parliamentary
[2:04:47.160 --> 2:04:52.720]  system and if you have to argue about it, we should replace the democratic party with
[2:04:52.720 --> 2:05:00.240]  the new populist party or the republican party should split in two, but one of the parties
[2:05:00.240 --> 2:05:03.280]  has to go, God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[2:05:03.280 --> 2:05:09.440]  I agree with the two party system, I agree with the system we have, I totally believe
[2:05:09.440 --> 2:05:15.960]  the electoral process and the electoral college, it's a genius system, it's the best system
[2:05:15.960 --> 2:05:22.120]  in the world and it's designed to keep the people in control but not have mob rule.
[2:05:22.120 --> 2:05:27.480]  We are a small our democracy, we are a republic where we have basic rights, basic freedoms,
[2:05:27.480 --> 2:05:35.360]  we elect leaders, there's checks and balances, but you can't have 51% vote to make Socrates
[2:05:35.360 --> 2:05:38.120]  a drink hemlock.
[2:05:38.120 --> 2:05:43.240]  In the pure democracies of Greece, if the people voted to kill you, you die.
[2:05:43.240 --> 2:05:47.200]  So if 51% of whites voted, let's say to kill all the brown people, when whites were the
[2:05:47.200 --> 2:05:51.440]  majority you'd kill the brown people.
[2:05:51.440 --> 2:05:56.680]  That's an extreme example, but that's now 51% brown people kill the white people.
[2:05:56.680 --> 2:06:02.360]  That's why the left teaches democracy, democracy, democracy because it's oligarchy.
[2:06:02.360 --> 2:06:06.080]  People think of oligarch as a bunch of top bureaucrats but it's always them controlling
[2:06:06.080 --> 2:06:12.600]  a mob, that's the definition of oligarchy, I have it right here, or mob rule is the
[2:06:12.600 --> 2:06:21.800]  role of government by mob or a mass of people, and it goes on.
[2:06:21.800 --> 2:06:27.600]  Okay, let's get this more calls here, let's go to Judy in Florida, thanks for holding,
[2:06:27.600 --> 2:06:28.600]  go ahead.
[2:06:28.600 --> 2:06:32.840]  Hi Alex, it's good to talk to you.
[2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:39.400]  The last time I was speaking on your program with Owen, it was during the lockdown and
[2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:46.600]  I dissed my own son, I said basically that he was brainwashed, and I want to clear that
[2:06:46.600 --> 2:06:53.920]  up for my own edification, and I wanted to speak to what, you know, I think a good portion
[2:06:53.920 --> 2:07:00.880]  of the silent majority is all about, like my son, I think they are people that are getting
[2:07:00.880 --> 2:07:09.160]  prepared and they know a lot of what's going on, there's only so much information that
[2:07:09.160 --> 2:07:15.160]  a person like my son, my daughter who's completely in denial, people like that, you know, she's
[2:07:15.160 --> 2:07:24.600]  of the left right now, but I really think that there's the mind control that we are
[2:07:24.600 --> 2:07:32.480]  experiencing on the left, it's been a result of a massive MK Ultrix experiment, this whole
[2:07:32.480 --> 2:07:41.280]  COVID mess, what threw us into the current carnage that's happening, that is George
[2:07:41.280 --> 2:07:48.560]  Cyrus funded, I think that it's just, it's biblical in its nature, and I want to just
[2:07:48.560 --> 2:07:56.240]  admit to you, it's going to sound strange, but I think in terms of the color purple,
[2:07:56.240 --> 2:08:02.200]  you have blue being the color of law, and red being the color of Jesus' blood, and
[2:08:02.200 --> 2:08:06.280]  the reason why his blood is so important is because he's fully God as much as he's fully
[2:08:06.280 --> 2:08:13.200]  human, so it means it's God's blood, and you mix those and it's purple, and I think
[2:08:13.200 --> 2:08:19.400]  in terms of, you know, what I just described in like my son and the silent majority, particularly
[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:23.680]  of Christian men, because you have passive Christian men, you have those that are really
[2:08:23.680 --> 2:08:32.120]  speaking out, like many of your guests that have been on the program, Steve Quayle, you
[2:08:32.120 --> 2:08:34.040]  know, there's a whole list.
[2:08:34.040 --> 2:08:36.720]  By the way, let's get Steve Quayle back on pronto.
[2:08:36.720 --> 2:08:42.760]  Doug Hadman, you know, John Moore, there's a list of really good Christian men who are
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:45.920]  speaking out, but that doesn't mean that they are, you know, that there are many that are
[2:08:45.920 --> 2:08:53.520]  not good bravos, what you call betas who are looking for leaders.
[2:08:53.520 --> 2:08:58.920]  I think later on, as the kimchi keeps hitting the fan, because let's face it, it's already
[2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:04.960]  a done deal, these men are going to come out of the woodwork, working righteously, you
[2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:10.480]  know, following the leaders, the actual leaders, and, you know, they're a major part of the
[2:09:10.480 --> 2:09:11.480]  answer right now.
[2:09:11.480 --> 2:09:12.480]  No, I agree.
[2:09:12.480 --> 2:09:16.040]  If the average man's just trying to make money and take care of their family, we're
[2:09:16.040 --> 2:09:19.320]  about to lose everything and go under full tyranny, and that is going to cause a giant
[2:09:19.320 --> 2:09:21.800]  response that is going to smash the left.
[2:09:21.800 --> 2:09:25.120]  But the IMF doesn't care, because that'll just wreck the economy further.
[2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:27.560]  They just buy it up and then continue the process.
[2:09:27.560 --> 2:09:30.960]  That's why these oligarchs, these globalists need to pay.
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:31.960]  They need to pay.
[2:09:31.960 --> 2:09:35.680]  And the first step in that is identifying them as the enemy.
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:40.800]  That's our job, is lazing the target in a peaceful, loving, political way, so that it
[2:09:40.800 --> 2:09:43.120]  can be politically targeted.
[2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:46.600]  I don't have to tell you things are bad, they're worse than bad, they're crazy.
[2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:49.160]  That's a quote from the 1970s film, Network.
[2:09:49.160 --> 2:09:52.720]  Yeah, things are really, really bad right now, we're in global martial law, villain
[2:09:52.720 --> 2:09:56.680]  milling the gates, U.N. operations, trying to bankrupt America with their lockdown and
[2:09:56.680 --> 2:10:00.400]  their race riots, but people are coming together at this beautiful time, but I'll be honest
[2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:01.400]  with you.
[2:10:01.400 --> 2:10:04.400]  I have decided just to sell out of all the products in our warehouse at 60% off, we haven't
[2:10:04.400 --> 2:10:08.480]  done that ever across the board, because gut level, I realized that we're making or
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:12.080]  breaking it, and so the only sure bet is to sell everything we've got to make sure in
[2:10:12.080 --> 2:10:15.440]  case there's total breakdown on society in six months, we still have the funding to go
[2:10:15.440 --> 2:10:19.160]  more than six months in the next year, so get your high quality products, your fish
[2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:24.080]  oil, your krill oil, your DNA force, your X2, your X3, your real red pill plus, get
[2:10:24.080 --> 2:10:29.200]  it all at infowarstore.com, it's 60% off, biggest sale ever right now, it may go two
[2:10:29.200 --> 2:10:32.680]  days, it may go a week, whatever you do, take advantage of this right now, we're in very
[2:10:32.680 --> 2:10:37.600]  important times, InfoWars needs funding and you need high quality products, take action.
[2:10:37.600 --> 2:10:42.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:10:42.920 --> 2:10:47.600]  What InfoWars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:54.880]  of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic, this is the battle for the
[2:10:54.880 --> 2:11:02.320]  future of humanity, and now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate
[2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:03.560]  the planet.
[2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:10.400]  Now, the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized, you must decide which
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:15.600]  side you're on, living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness
[2:11:15.600 --> 2:11:21.840]  will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally death, and this is a spiritual
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:28.560]  death we're talking about, not just a physical death, the delusions must end now, InfoWars
[2:11:28.560 --> 2:11:33.760]  was correct about it all, and we have come so far by exposing the enemy, most people
[2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:38.960]  that are aware of them will order to join it out of fear, they are truly fools, we must
[2:11:38.960 --> 2:11:45.680]  fight this or lose our souls.
[2:11:45.680 --> 2:12:01.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:09.520]  Oclocracy, Latin for mob rule in the rule of government by mob or massive people or
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:17.520]  the intimidation of legitimate authorities, but really I find that oligarchs will actually
[2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:22.480]  create the mob to then overthrow the legitimate government and bring them into power, so I
[2:12:22.480 --> 2:12:29.320]  find that oligarchies grow out of the anarchy of mob rule, and our founders were more worried
[2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:34.400]  about that than anything else, an incredible document was brought to my attention by one
[2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:39.040]  of the crew yesterday, and then I went and read the actual full document last night and
[2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:46.320]  I suggest you do as well, it's on the DABOS group website, it's on the UN website.
[2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:54.360]  Now is the time for the great reset, and right here it says carbon taxes, a new type of capitalism,
[2:12:54.360 --> 2:12:59.560]  changing our lifestyles, learning to be poor, to stop greenhouse gases, getting rid of fossil
[2:12:59.560 --> 2:13:07.720]  fuels, basically mass death, ladies and gentlemen, and how COVID taught us as an opportunity
[2:13:07.720 --> 2:13:12.600]  how to do this and how to give up our lifestyles, this, the trillion dollar companies are telling
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:17.480]  us that on slave camps in China, you have the head of the DABOS group saying the pandemic
[2:13:17.480 --> 2:13:27.280]  represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reexamine and reset our world,
[2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:32.120]  and they go over the plan, and they talk about getting rid of the family, which is the bedrock
[2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:36.480]  of civilization, so they say they want to help you, but if you read the IMF and World Bank
[2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:43.400]  documents that Greg Palace got in 2001 at the BBC, it's a 21-part plan, but it's four
[2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:48.440]  steps he breaks it into, how they'll come into a conservative, libertarian, liberal government
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:53.720]  they don't care, but if it's legitimate and prospering, they will finance uprisings, police
[2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:59.240]  crises and start overthrowing cities, start having an anti-government sentiment and finally
[2:13:59.240 --> 2:14:04.840]  implode the country, overthrow it and then bring in IMF and World Bank control and then
[2:14:04.840 --> 2:14:11.080]  martial law, and so that is what they are engineering, but they say it's all such a
[2:14:11.080 --> 2:14:16.720]  nice, good-loving thing, and John Perkins of the Economic Hitman exposed that as well,
[2:14:16.720 --> 2:14:24.760]  but here's Tucker Carlson talking about PepsiCo, talking about Nike that owns the slave factories,
[2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:28.680]  they're the moral authority like Apple, oh, you actually have millions in slave camps?
[2:14:28.680 --> 2:14:33.680]  I mean, it's in the news that Apple has slave camps at the Uyghur facilities for the Muslims
[2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:38.200]  building iPhone components, but it's like Buddy's Tim Cook, I mean, it's okay, right?
[2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:42.400]  I mean, if he was a Republican, that'd be terrible, Tucker Carlson knocked out of the
[2:14:42.400 --> 2:14:48.640]  parking lot last night, there's full videos on infowars.com, I suggest you share it, Tucker,
[2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:53.720]  corporations funding riots that destroy small businesses, and he goes on and admit they're
[2:14:53.720 --> 2:14:56.920]  targeting the family, here's part of the report.
[2:14:56.920 --> 2:15:07.400]  The city that's really been turned upside down by the riots, but, and you've heard this a lot recently, riots are the voice of the unheard, how dare you criticize them?
[2:15:07.400 --> 2:15:12.280]  You're hearing that message from virtually every American corporation right now, every university,
[2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:17.680]  every major media outlet, the rioters burning down your city with the support of virtually
[2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:24.000]  everyone richer than you are, quote, unheard, you by contrast are the oppressor, and if
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:28.240]  you disagree in any way, we're going to fire you and wreck your life.
[2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:32.360]  The corporations aren't simply tweeting their support for the riots, they're paying for
[2:15:32.360 --> 2:15:33.360]  them too.
[2:15:33.360 --> 2:15:37.480]  Recently, the CEO of Cisco announced that his company is donating $5 million to the
[2:15:37.480 --> 2:15:39.360]  Black Lives Matter Foundation.
[2:15:39.360 --> 2:15:44.200]  Airbnb is donating half a million dollars, so it's Dropbox, video game maker Ubisoft
[2:15:44.200 --> 2:15:46.280]  is giving $100,000.
[2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:51.160]  Intel has pledged a million dollars to assorted anti-racism groups, and is pressuring its
[2:15:51.160 --> 2:15:56.160]  employees to donate more of their money to the foundation, the Black Lives Matter Foundation.
[2:15:56.160 --> 2:16:00.360]  And then there's Pepsi, Pepsi's donating too, this revolution is brought to you by a local
[2:16:00.360 --> 2:16:05.840]  PepsiCo bottler, tired after a long day of looting, try Pepsi.
[2:16:05.840 --> 2:16:09.320]  So the question is, now that it's getting all this corporate money, what exactly does
[2:16:09.320 --> 2:16:12.160]  the Black Lives Matter Foundation believe?
[2:16:12.160 --> 2:16:17.640]  Well less than a week ago, the group launched a petition to defund all police departments
[2:16:17.640 --> 2:16:19.040]  nationwide.
[2:16:19.040 --> 2:16:24.080]  The group's co-founder, Petrusse Cullors, says we should abolish all prisons.
[2:16:24.080 --> 2:16:31.400]  So does Intel want 1.7 million felons released onto America's streets, so they want all 700,000
[2:16:31.400 --> 2:16:34.440]  cops fired tomorrow?
[2:16:34.440 --> 2:16:37.720]  It's not clear what they want, but they're paying for that.
[2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:42.680]  Maybe they think they could look good for the mob by funding the cause.
[2:16:42.680 --> 2:16:46.120]  Who knows what they want, but they're responsible for this.
[2:16:46.120 --> 2:16:49.360]  On the other hand, the foundation says, the Black Lives Matter Foundation says that one
[2:16:49.360 --> 2:16:54.960]  of its other goals is to, quote, disrupt the Western prescribed nuclear family structure.
[2:16:54.960 --> 2:16:59.440]  Well, that's certainly a goal major corporations can get behind.
[2:16:59.440 --> 2:17:03.720]  People who aren't encumbered by families won't be distracted from being the dutiful little
[2:17:03.720 --> 2:17:07.200]  worker bees they like most.
[2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:09.920]  Married children, stop!
[2:17:09.920 --> 2:17:11.600]  Get back to work.
[2:17:11.600 --> 2:17:16.880]  Some companies are donating to, or encouraging employees to donate to, the NAACP Legal Defense
[2:17:16.880 --> 2:17:18.080]  Fund.
[2:17:18.080 --> 2:17:22.720]  Right now, that group's Twitter page denies that the riots even exist, and instead they're
[2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:25.680]  blaming police for the violence.
[2:17:25.680 --> 2:17:30.920]  The NAACP Fund is also promoting bail funds.
[2:17:30.920 --> 2:17:35.320]  Those get violent rioters out of jail immediately.
[2:17:35.320 --> 2:17:39.120]  So with all this money flowing out of this country's most profitable corporations, it
[2:17:39.120 --> 2:17:43.280]  might be a nice gesture for those corporations to donate some money to, I don't know, rebuild
[2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:46.800]  some of the small businesses that have been destroyed over the past week.
[2:17:46.800 --> 2:17:47.840]  There are a lot of them.
[2:17:47.840 --> 2:17:51.760]  They desperately need the help, oh, but they're not going to do that.
[2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:56.600]  Because for a lot of big corporations, the total annihilation of small businesses is
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:17:59.520]  one of the best parts of this new revolution.
[2:17:59.520 --> 2:18:01.920]  There's always an angle.
[2:18:01.920 --> 2:18:02.920]  Someone's always getting more powerful.
[2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:06.400]  And by the way, it's not just big corporations, tomorrow we will name the celebrities who
[2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:11.600]  are donating to get the looters, the destroyers, the violent thugs out of prisons, they can
[2:18:11.600 --> 2:18:12.600]  keep doing it.
[2:18:12.600 --> 2:18:13.600]  Be sure to catch that.
[2:18:13.600 --> 2:18:14.600]  We have the list.
[2:18:14.600 --> 2:18:15.600]  All right.
[2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:18.120]  More of that is in the story at newswords.com.
[2:18:18.120 --> 2:18:19.120]  I suggest you share it.
[2:18:19.120 --> 2:18:20.120]  And that's the truth.
[2:18:20.120 --> 2:18:24.400]  This is all coal-blooded mega corporations that have the worst slave factories on earth
[2:18:24.400 --> 2:18:30.200]  actually have factories next to death camps on record, and suicide nets around them crancing
[2:18:30.200 --> 2:18:37.360]  around, skipping around like evil elves telling you that they love black people.
[2:18:37.360 --> 2:18:42.840]  Meanwhile, Trump put $100 billion into black communities for new businesses.
[2:18:42.840 --> 2:18:43.840]  And what was it?
[2:18:43.840 --> 2:18:48.000]  Another $50 billion into black colleges, last time I checked, doubling the funding over
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:49.520]  the next four years.
[2:18:49.520 --> 2:18:50.520]  None of that matters.
[2:18:50.520 --> 2:18:55.280]  He wants to kill black people, he's a KKK member, and let's all just kill each other.
[2:18:55.280 --> 2:19:01.880]  When you go out to one of these events, it's 90% white method people, and I'm not against
[2:19:01.880 --> 2:19:06.720]  white people, but I mean, I'm ashamed, though, that where are they growing these white people?
[2:19:06.720 --> 2:19:10.400]  Because they look like they got grown with a bunch of mushrooms or something.
[2:19:10.400 --> 2:19:15.320]  I mean, they're dull-eyed, they look like zombies, they're ugly, they're, well, you've
[2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:18.120]  seen the videos, I'm not exaggerating.
[2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:25.560]  These people look like a big spiritual spider stuck a straw in their soul and sucked it
[2:19:25.560 --> 2:19:26.560]  out.
[2:19:26.560 --> 2:19:32.040]  They're in a trance, you heard a caller earlier, a lady called, don't forget her name, she
[2:19:32.040 --> 2:19:35.120]  said it's like, they're under MKUltra.
[2:19:35.120 --> 2:19:40.000]  They are under MKUltra.
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:45.040]  They are mass programmed, first of the colleges and the universities, that they are the elite,
[2:19:45.040 --> 2:19:48.720]  they are the rulers, they're the ones that care, they're the good people, and then they
[2:19:48.720 --> 2:19:52.840]  get caught into that, and well, things just keep getting worse, and then things keep falling
[2:19:52.840 --> 2:19:58.560]  apart under globalism, so it's not globalism's fault, it's America's fault, and it's white
[2:19:58.560 --> 2:19:59.560]  people's fault.
[2:19:59.560 --> 2:20:07.320]  And if we would all just say that we were bad, that we could fix the world, meanwhile,
[2:20:07.320 --> 2:20:08.320]  G.G.
[2:20:08.320 --> 2:20:12.360]  Ping literally owns four of the six big Hollywood production houses that have turned out hundreds
[2:20:12.360 --> 2:20:14.160]  of movies.
[2:20:14.160 --> 2:20:18.440]  Every major star has made one, Massey McConaughey, everybody, about how white people are bad,
[2:20:18.440 --> 2:20:23.920]  and about white people leading up rising of black people to kill the white people.
[2:20:23.920 --> 2:20:29.880]  This is all a sick, psychotic joke by these dirtbags, because Hollywood and the New World
[2:20:29.880 --> 2:20:33.520]  Order have been held unaccountable, but guess what, Bill Gates, you're all over the news
[2:20:33.520 --> 2:20:39.800]  whining that people hate you, because we know you ran Jeffrey Epstein's veto operation,
[2:20:39.800 --> 2:20:40.800]  you slimy maggot.
[2:20:40.800 --> 2:20:45.880]  Hey, guys, Rob Dew here with infowarsstore.com, and I want to tell you about something that
[2:20:45.880 --> 2:20:49.800]  I think has really helped me out, and I think can help you out too, especially if you have
[2:20:49.800 --> 2:20:52.440]  any problems sleeping, and that's knockout.
[2:20:52.440 --> 2:20:57.640]  Let's face it, our life patterns have been disrupted by this lockdown, this government-imposed
[2:20:57.640 --> 2:21:01.240]  imprisonment, and it has definitely affected my sleep schedule, but one thing that has
[2:21:01.240 --> 2:21:02.240]  helped is knockout.
[2:21:02.240 --> 2:21:06.160]  I take one pill about an hour before I want to go to bed, and boom, I get a great night's
[2:21:06.160 --> 2:21:07.160]  sleep.
[2:21:07.160 --> 2:21:11.640]  On Memorial Day, I took two of them, fell asleep about 1 a.m., woke up at 8 a.m., ready
[2:21:11.640 --> 2:21:12.640]  to go.
[2:21:12.640 --> 2:21:16.200]  It really has made a difference in my life, and it can make a difference in your life
[2:21:16.200 --> 2:21:17.200]  too.
[2:21:17.200 --> 2:21:18.440]  If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch.
[2:21:18.440 --> 2:21:21.680]  If you get great sleep, you're going to be on point, you're going to be mentally focused,
[2:21:21.680 --> 2:21:26.560]  you're going to be ready to take on the day, and right now, knockout is 50% off, it's less

[2:21:33.760 --> 2:21:36.720]  the sleep you need, especially in these tough times.

[2:22:20.560 --> 2:22:28.420]  Do not go to infowarstore.com for 60% off, flash sale, you got bankrupt and die, you
[2:22:28.420 --> 2:22:35.560]  have no speech, info wars is weak, do not take advantage of 60% off.
[2:22:35.560 --> 2:22:40.920]  Oh, we hurt you, oh Joe Biden, good.
[2:22:40.920 --> 2:22:46.440]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the
[2:22:46.440 --> 2:22:49.360]  globalist out of their countries.
[2:22:49.360 --> 2:22:53.840]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people
[2:22:53.840 --> 2:22:59.200]  that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying
[2:22:59.200 --> 2:23:01.160]  essential services.
[2:23:01.160 --> 2:23:06.360]  Police is an attempt to have society collapse and the globalists, as they've done in the
[2:23:06.360 --> 2:23:08.960]  third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[2:23:08.960 --> 2:23:14.560]  They must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU openly saying they
[2:23:14.560 --> 2:23:16.000]  fund the police.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:17.360]  The police have a lot of problems.
[2:23:17.360 --> 2:23:18.720]  We all have a lot of problems.
[2:23:18.720 --> 2:23:21.480]  But this is our government and our local vocabulary.
[2:23:21.480 --> 2:23:26.160]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country, they're going to put in a real
[2:23:26.160 --> 2:23:28.400]  police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[2:23:28.400 --> 2:23:32.200]  The globalists believe Communist China is the model of the world.
[2:23:32.200 --> 2:23:34.320]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[2:23:34.320 --> 2:23:43.920]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed, infowars.com.
[2:23:43.920 --> 2:23:56.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:23:56.040 --> 2:24:07.840]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance,
[2:24:07.840 --> 2:24:13.880]  rallying Patriots worldwide.
[2:24:13.880 --> 2:24:17.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:24:17.400 --> 2:24:27.560]  We've been running that promo for 15 years, at least it's in this broadcast and they thought
[2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:30.760]  this is like a cartoon show, it's like a comic book.
[2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:33.720]  I'm like, no, they've got these plans, they're building them, they're launching them in other
[2:24:33.720 --> 2:24:35.200]  countries already.
[2:24:35.200 --> 2:24:37.640]  Get ready, it's coming, so crank it up.
[2:24:37.640 --> 2:24:44.200]  It's time for you to stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive.
[2:24:44.200 --> 2:24:45.200]  You going to roll over?
[2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:50.800]  Are you going to stand up and fight, because now the games are over?
[2:24:50.800 --> 2:25:02.440]  All you yuppies, all you trendies that thought you'd duck this, you're going to have to
[2:25:02.440 --> 2:25:03.440]  be tested.
[2:25:03.440 --> 2:25:12.320]  Oh, hang on to the good times, because they're going to go away, and now they are, just like
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:17.600]  those babies getting killed, and nobody came to help them, and now you're going to pay.
[2:25:17.600 --> 2:25:20.880]  All right, let's get serious here.
[2:25:20.880 --> 2:25:24.840]  I'm going to go to your phone calls, I'm going to cover some other news I haven't hit.
[2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:28.560]  A Dr. Nick Begich, the guy that exposed so much of the technicals, the new world order
[2:25:28.560 --> 2:25:33.080]  is coming up, but let me just cover this right now.
[2:25:33.080 --> 2:25:38.960]  This is taught at all the major universities by the leftist, and it's pure cult programming,
[2:25:38.960 --> 2:25:45.640]  where whites are taught you don't talk, you are evil, you're there to serve black people,
[2:25:45.640 --> 2:25:46.960]  and it's the definition of slavery.
[2:25:46.960 --> 2:25:53.440]  I read this article from infowars.com earlier in the start of the show, and it's in a screaming
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:25:59.960]  voice in all caps, important, important information for this Saturday's protest.
[2:25:59.960 --> 2:26:06.760]  White folks, guide to protesting, copy and paste, do not use share.
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:11.720]  If you are a white person considering joining protests this week, there is a list of rules
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:12.720]  put together for you.
[2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:19.080]  Friends of color, if they have forgotten anything, please add follow up calls only.
[2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:24.360]  Do not initiate or lead calls, your job is to follow and add your voice when it is called
[2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:25.360]  for.
[2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:30.960]  Do not take selfies, ask to take pictures or videos of individuals.
[2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:35.160]  You are there to witness only, film the police as much as possible.
[2:26:35.160 --> 2:26:40.000]  Be helpful, hand out water and snacks, make sure protest leaders are hydrated and fed.
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.680]  This is exhausting work, help keep their energy up.
[2:26:42.680 --> 2:26:43.680]  Follow directions.
[2:26:43.680 --> 2:26:47.960]  If a black person tells you to do something, you do it immediately without question.
[2:26:47.960 --> 2:26:52.720]  You respect the authority and the decisions of the black protestors at all times.
[2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:57.760]  Five, stay in the back until you are called forward, it goes on from there.
[2:26:57.760 --> 2:27:04.480]  When you are at the front, you are silent, remain calm at all times, do not agitate.
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:08.880]  This is real when I am reading.
[2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:12.800]  That is because the globalists want whole voting blocks to not talk, not have views and
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:19.800]  just whatever cult leader, Antifa or Soros says, you just go, yes master, they got names
[2:27:19.800 --> 2:27:21.040]  of this.
[2:27:21.040 --> 2:27:24.680]  Do what we say or we are going to terrorize you.
[2:27:24.680 --> 2:27:29.760]  That is the definition of terrorism, threatening violence or carrying out violence from political
[2:27:29.760 --> 2:27:30.760]  lane.
[2:27:30.760 --> 2:27:37.440]  That is the definition, ladies and gentlemen, of slavery.
[2:27:37.440 --> 2:27:39.200]  What is the definition of it?
[2:27:39.200 --> 2:27:44.680]  Submission to a dominating influence, the state of a person who is chattel of another,
[2:27:44.680 --> 2:27:55.480]  the practice of slave holding, and it goes on from there, examples of slavery.
[2:27:55.480 --> 2:27:59.520]  Definition of submission, compliance, conformity, obedience, support nation, is this not the
[2:27:59.520 --> 2:28:00.520]  left folks?
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:13.120]  Oh, but it is for a greater good that they do all of this over and over and over again.
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:17.880]  Definition of blockade, the isolation by a warring nation of an enemy area such as a
[2:28:17.880 --> 2:28:22.640]  harbor by troops or warships to prevent the passage of persons and supplies broadly, a
[2:28:22.640 --> 2:28:26.480]  restrictive measure designed to obstruct the commerce and communications of an unfriendly
[2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:27.480]  nation.
[2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:31.080]  What else do we do with the lockdown?
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:35.160]  Definition of siege, a military blockade of a city or fortified place to compel it to
[2:28:35.160 --> 2:28:36.160]  surrender.
[2:28:36.160 --> 2:28:40.480]  Trump is trying to turn the economy back on, they launch riots everywhere, and the military
[2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:46.120]  tries to come in to break the siege, we are told they are martial law and they are coming
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:28:47.120]  to siege us.
[2:28:47.120 --> 2:28:49.080]  In fact, guys, this is in the computer.
[2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:53.520]  I saw Darren McBrain getting at yesterday's show to me, Don Lemon saying Trump is a dictator
[2:28:53.520 --> 2:28:56.280]  trying to overthrow the government when that is what they are doing.
[2:28:56.280 --> 2:28:59.840]  Please grab me that clip, thank you.
[2:28:59.840 --> 2:29:03.840]  Now learned helplessness, we talk a lot about this.
[2:29:03.840 --> 2:29:08.440]  Learned helplessness occurs when an individual continually faces a negative, uncontrollable
[2:29:08.440 --> 2:29:11.840]  situation and stops trying to change their circumstances, even when they have the ability
[2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:12.960]  to do so.
[2:29:12.960 --> 2:29:17.800]  They are trying to break you with learned helplessness.
[2:29:17.800 --> 2:29:20.360]  If you give up to pressure, your muscles atrophy and you die.
[2:29:20.360 --> 2:29:22.680]  If you fight back against pressure, you become stronger.
[2:29:22.680 --> 2:29:25.520]  You overcome, you adapt, you win, win, win.
[2:29:25.520 --> 2:29:29.800]  So don't just bow to all of this.
[2:29:29.800 --> 2:29:33.200]  Social contract is what they are breaking right now by making you give up.
[2:29:33.200 --> 2:29:36.600]  Milgram experiments where they did psychological tests where students thought they were shocking
[2:29:36.600 --> 2:29:42.360]  people to death, and they found at the Yale University study that under the orders of
[2:29:42.360 --> 2:29:47.640]  their professors, a higher rate of people were willing to kill than even the Nazis because
[2:29:47.640 --> 2:29:48.640]  they were followers.
[2:29:48.640 --> 2:29:51.360]  They were taught following was good.
[2:29:51.360 --> 2:29:55.400]  The Milgram shock experiment, look it up for yourself.
[2:29:55.400 --> 2:29:59.320]  Their president experiment where they even found liberal trendies were the most likely
[2:29:59.320 --> 2:30:05.880]  to become vicious, hateful, abusing jail guards when given authority.
[2:30:05.880 --> 2:30:09.120]  And then of course, what the general public has, Stockholm syndrome, where you begin to
[2:30:09.120 --> 2:30:14.200]  serve and worship your abusers and convince yourself that it's all good.
[2:30:14.200 --> 2:30:23.040]  You're being put under all of this to bring in, in closing, the cloward and piven stratagem,
[2:30:23.040 --> 2:30:27.720]  a communist plan adopted by the Democratic Party, developed the 1960s by the professors,
[2:30:27.720 --> 2:30:33.120]  cloward and piven, to undermine the pillars of the city and make society collapse using
[2:30:33.120 --> 2:30:39.880]  racism, using police brutality as the pretext to finally bring down society.
[2:30:39.880 --> 2:30:44.200]  And on it build communist dictatorship.
[2:30:44.200 --> 2:30:47.640]  Might want to go read about it, might want to go find out about it, might want to say
[2:30:47.640 --> 2:30:53.000]  no to it because this is the plan and this is what these dirtbag globalists are caring
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:30:54.000]  about.
[2:30:54.000 --> 2:30:56.920]  It's that simple.
[2:30:56.920 --> 2:30:59.720]  Now, I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[2:30:59.720 --> 2:31:04.800]  I just want you to remember that if you try to break up a family in communist China, you're
[2:31:04.800 --> 2:31:07.760]  executed for undermining the state.
[2:31:07.760 --> 2:31:09.680]  Here they try to undermine the family.
[2:31:09.680 --> 2:31:13.360]  Why is that?
[2:31:13.360 --> 2:31:15.200]  Because they want us weak, they want us broken.
[2:31:15.200 --> 2:31:18.720]  Once commies take over, like Sweden, oh, have your family.
[2:31:18.720 --> 2:31:21.720]  Oh, we don't need lockdowns in Sweden.
[2:31:21.720 --> 2:31:22.720]  There's no COVID.
[2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:23.720]  It doesn't exist.
[2:31:23.720 --> 2:31:25.800]  Look, the Chinese only had it for two months and said we don't.
[2:31:25.800 --> 2:31:27.720]  They were only teaching us how to be slaves.
[2:31:27.720 --> 2:31:31.000]  It's all about being followers and Americans were known as being rugged individualists and
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:32.000]  trailblazers.
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:33.000]  We're now the opposite.
[2:31:33.000 --> 2:31:35.000]  Okay, let's go to Dixie in Florida.
[2:31:35.000 --> 2:31:37.400]  Thanks for holding Dixie here on the air.
[2:31:37.400 --> 2:31:38.400]  Welcome.
[2:31:38.400 --> 2:31:39.400]  Hi, Alex.
[2:31:39.400 --> 2:31:43.200]  I'd really love to plug your apparel on in just a minute.
[2:31:43.200 --> 2:31:49.920]  The reason I called is that I am a former occultist, but I'm proud to say that through
[2:31:49.920 --> 2:31:55.840]  the power of Jesus Christ, I am now a born-again Christian, but because of my past, I do recognize
[2:31:55.840 --> 2:31:56.840]  some things.
[2:31:56.840 --> 2:32:00.640]  Sure, having been in the occult, you see how everything's a big occultic ritual with these
[2:32:00.640 --> 2:32:01.640]  people.
[2:32:01.640 --> 2:32:02.640]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:32:02.640 --> 2:32:05.360]  And that brings me to something that concerns me.
[2:32:05.360 --> 2:32:09.920]  And that is something that your camera crew has been panning to the right of you and
[2:32:09.920 --> 2:32:14.080]  putting as the center of focus instead of you multiple times now.
[2:32:14.080 --> 2:32:19.880]  And I recognize that that could be used as something that the voodoo, a voodun, santeria,
[2:32:19.880 --> 2:32:24.960]  and people who have ancestor altars, and that they worship.
[2:32:24.960 --> 2:32:25.960]  So it concerns me.
[2:32:25.960 --> 2:32:28.160]  But ma'am, I put that out there.
[2:32:28.160 --> 2:32:29.160]  No, no.
[2:32:29.160 --> 2:32:30.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:32:30.160 --> 2:32:31.400]  I don't know if you were tuned in yesterday.
[2:32:31.400 --> 2:32:36.440]  I was going to put a chessboard out here and I was going to, let me explain this to
[2:32:36.440 --> 2:32:40.680]  you, I was going to put a chessboard out here and explain how they're playing both sides
[2:32:40.680 --> 2:32:43.440]  off against each other and the way to win is not play the game and be aware of the whole
[2:32:43.440 --> 2:32:44.440]  thing.
[2:32:44.440 --> 2:32:45.720]  And then my dad's a doctor.
[2:32:45.720 --> 2:32:46.720]  He has a skull.
[2:32:46.720 --> 2:32:48.080]  I thought the game is death.
[2:32:48.080 --> 2:32:49.080]  Put that there.
[2:32:49.080 --> 2:32:54.520]  And then Max Kaiser and his girlfriend as a joke sent me flowers that got delivered
[2:32:54.520 --> 2:32:56.640]  right as I was setting this up.
[2:32:56.640 --> 2:33:01.080]  And I said, oh, we'll put some flowers out here and then we'll ask the cube people what's
[2:33:01.080 --> 2:33:06.120]  the secret message showing how the esoteric stuff and the occult and Gnostic stuff is all
[2:33:06.120 --> 2:33:10.120]  about people projecting onto things what they want to see.
[2:33:10.120 --> 2:33:14.880]  So that's the whole point of this is this little ensemble all came together that way.
[2:33:14.880 --> 2:33:17.240]  But I'll come back to you, Dixie.
[2:33:17.240 --> 2:33:18.240]  And we'll get to your point.
[2:33:18.240 --> 2:33:19.240]  And then we'll get to everybody.
[2:33:19.240 --> 2:33:21.680]  I'm going to get to everybody before Dr. Nick Beckett takes over.
[2:33:21.680 --> 2:33:23.280]  That means we're going to stop covering stories.
[2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:24.280]  I'm going to go right to you.
[2:33:24.280 --> 2:33:26.640]  But that is just a cool art piece right there.
[2:33:26.640 --> 2:33:30.080]  I'll assure you I'm not into voodoo or sanaria.
[2:33:30.080 --> 2:33:34.000]  I'm into art types and it's very thought provoking art, isn't it?
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:41.000]  A lot better than what some people come up with.

[2:35:43.080 --> 2:35:48.000]  We're living in insanely dangerous times and I told folks going back three months ago,
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:51.640]  I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus, I'm worried
[2:35:51.640 --> 2:35:55.880]  about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted that a chain
[2:35:55.880 --> 2:36:00.400]  reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches
[2:36:00.400 --> 2:36:03.200]  across the United States and it's even worse in the third world.
[2:36:03.200 --> 2:36:07.000]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it, but with the election
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:11.560]  fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else
[2:36:11.560 --> 2:36:16.880]  is going on, now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years, they're
[2:36:16.880 --> 2:36:21.440]  in easily totable bags, it's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked

[2:37:23.640 --> 2:37:30.160]  They watched this whole situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air, but thanks to you and our crew
[2:37:30.200 --> 2:37:36.280]  We are still on air. So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever
[2:37:36.280 --> 2:37:47.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:38:07.080 --> 2:38:10.440]  Everything they accused us of they themselves are doing
[2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:16.360]  They are financing and fomenting the overthrow of our Republic to replace it
[2:38:16.760 --> 2:38:21.240]  With the nightmare world government system modeled after communist China, and here's Don Lemon of
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:24.480]  CNN saying
[2:38:25.080 --> 2:38:32.200]  That Trump is bringing us into a dictatorship and that Trump is causing all of this here it is
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:34.600]  from the commander in chief
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:38.640]  For this very moment that just happened in front of our eyes
[2:38:39.160 --> 2:38:41.160]  Why were we?
[2:38:41.640 --> 2:38:49.240]  Pretending otherwise open your eyes America open your eyes. We are teetering on a dictatorship
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:57.120]  We are teeth. This is chaos has the president and listening is the president declaring war on Americans
[2:38:57.520 --> 2:39:03.920]  What is happening here? He's saying he wants to approach that he wants to protect peaceful protesters at the same time
[2:39:03.920 --> 2:39:11.120]  Sending law enforcement and military into the streets to push peaceful protesters back
[2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:14.120]  To be aggressive with peaceful protesters
[2:39:14.640 --> 2:39:18.240]  He is doing the exact opposite of what he said. That's when they had just
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:24.080]  We're torturing and climbing the White House fences and they said you got to push the perimeter back
[2:39:24.840 --> 2:39:28.800]  there's lawlessness all over the country murders death police being killed everywhere and
[2:39:28.800 --> 2:39:36.680]  The governors won't call it the National Guard because they're too busy taking a knee and then you say he's a dictator when sorrows and your
[2:39:36.680 --> 2:39:40.280]  Murderous organization CNN are behind this whole thing criminal
[2:39:40.720 --> 2:39:46.440]  They're gonna try the Jesse Smollett thing to cause a race riot, you know last year. It's all these crooks do
[2:39:47.720 --> 2:39:51.280]  All right Dixie go ahead and finish your point about the great reset. Go ahead. Oh
[2:39:52.280 --> 2:39:55.040]  Yeah, part of the great reset of course is
[2:39:55.040 --> 2:40:00.600]  I'm indoctrinating our young children and one of the things that came across my email
[2:40:01.240 --> 2:40:05.800]  Was that a school districts are using a program called teaching tolerance?
[2:40:06.440 --> 2:40:12.460]  To I guess educate everybody teachers and students about race and other things like that
[2:40:12.840 --> 2:40:17.840]  And it comes from none other than the Southern poverty Law Center. Oh, absolutely. They're teaching white kids
[2:40:17.840 --> 2:40:21.080]  They're bad and teaching five-year-olds that they could be a girl or a boy
[2:40:21.080 --> 2:40:26.720]  And I mean, it's it's totally a sicko globalist group trying to get their hands on your children and
[2:40:27.600 --> 2:40:34.120]  What's funny to me? It's not funny at all is that the people who are promoting this from school districts across country
[2:40:34.120 --> 2:40:41.960]  They don't even realize what they're doing. They have no idea. They just say see that that is their white contribution to helping
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:48.240]  Children understand. Yeah, people think they're helping it all sounds good and they don't know it's really drag queen story time
[2:40:48.240 --> 2:40:55.480]  Hey, just from a cult perspective because I just thought this would look cool. And then Kaiser trying to get me to do his
[2:40:57.120 --> 2:40:59.120]  Bitcoin thing that I'm looking at doing
[2:40:59.120 --> 2:41:04.360]  Sent me flowers, you know him and his co-producer as a telegram just to remind me to you know
[2:41:04.360 --> 2:41:07.360]  I mean, that's why I got these flowers. So this wasn't some sanary a thing
[2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:12.600]  I literally was delivered the flowers while I was putting the chessboard and the skull on the desk
[2:41:12.600 --> 2:41:18.760]  But I could kind of think doesn't sanary or voodoo had to do with skulls and like oranges or something because I've seen
[2:41:19.640 --> 2:41:21.640]  I've seen some of that in
[2:41:21.720 --> 2:41:26.560]  Some of the Haiti research I've done. So so how would it what would an occultist see in this?
[2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:32.240]  First of all, you do have the black and white and we know that that's been used by occultist
[2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:36.160]  So those colors on and then of course you have a prepared surface in this case
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:44.240]  It's a checkerboard on the offerings to whatever spirits or whatever demons or whatever and of course they wouldn't consider them demons
[2:41:44.360 --> 2:41:45.200]  necessarily
[2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:48.080]  Would be maybe the test pieces flowers, of course
[2:41:48.080 --> 2:41:51.680]  And certainly the type of flower or the color of flower, but the most
[2:41:52.280 --> 2:41:55.840]  Disturbing thing would is of course be the skull itself placed on the altar
[2:41:55.840 --> 2:42:00.920]  So so if you are an occultist that might be something that you would use specifically
[2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:07.600]  To gain the favor of some demonic entity. So it kind of makes me a little nervous that it's on your desk
[2:42:07.600 --> 2:42:11.880]  I know you probably didn't do any invocations or anything like that. Yeah, sure
[2:42:11.880 --> 2:42:18.240]  No, I don't have that intent, but my intent was have to be striking and so I'm thinking they want to kill us all
[2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:22.960]  They've set up this system. We're playing a game. They control the way to not have death
[2:42:23.480 --> 2:42:28.280]  Is to not play the game and I went oh got a skull my dad's got a skull in his office
[2:42:28.280 --> 2:42:33.120]  When got the skull that I've he's had since before I was born and so it's a
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:38.640]  Family heirloom and then the the the roses is we could have life
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:41.440]  Rather than death by not playing the game
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:45.840]  So see you could kind of a reverse ritual that just came out of my subconscious mind. Thank you for the call
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  So there you go
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:52.120]  Yeah, I don't I don't involve myself in the occult and voodoo. I have the Holy Spirit, but
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:42:58.040]  Nice little art piece. I think we kind of threw together. All right, let's go ahead and take another call here
[2:42:59.160 --> 2:43:04.120]  There's been holding longest. Let's go to hook a shield from South Dakota. Welcome. Go ahead
[2:43:05.600 --> 2:43:11.600]  Hello, Alex. How you doing? This is hope Sheila hope Sheila good to hear from you. What do you think about the whole situation?
[2:43:12.280 --> 2:43:14.160]  well
[2:43:14.160 --> 2:43:15.560]  it's
[2:43:15.560 --> 2:43:17.960]  For me, I find it kind of interesting
[2:43:17.960 --> 2:43:22.480]  Just a quick side note that this came at a certain time in which the COVID
[2:43:23.200 --> 2:43:25.720]  Lockdowns ended up getting broken up by this event
[2:43:25.720 --> 2:43:33.400]  And so I think it's going to be very difficult for them to try to re-institute these lockdowns after these mass gatherings
[2:43:33.760 --> 2:43:39.240]  But that said what I wanted to share with you is what's going on in South Dakota still with the martial law
[2:43:39.520 --> 2:43:43.440]  Just to give a heads up. That's right. The Native American areas are the most clamped down
[2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:51.720]  Absolutely. So on our reservations, we got checkpoints and what they've established at least on the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation is
[2:43:52.560 --> 2:43:59.920]  Basically a medical tyranny under an illegal tribal ordinance 83 called the public health ordinance and they're actually now
[2:44:00.600 --> 2:44:05.240]  Requiring travel passes to come into or leave the reservation if you're a tribal member
[2:44:05.240 --> 2:44:10.440]  And for those that don't know Adolf Hitler got his plan for the concentration camps from what was done in Native Americans
[2:44:10.440 --> 2:44:16.240]  And so it's done on these travel reservations not just here, but around the world is the beta test for everybody else
[2:44:16.240 --> 2:44:18.240]  That's why it's even more frightening
[2:44:18.400 --> 2:44:25.040]  Exactly exactly and there's just one quick thing I wanted to share real quick and it's to the occultists that are watching this that are
[2:44:25.280 --> 2:44:26.320]  orchestrating this
[2:44:26.320 --> 2:44:30.440]  They are not able to shield themselves from the karma of their intentions
[2:44:30.960 --> 2:44:36.080]  We are all part of the great essence, which is the Creator you cannot escape from it
[2:44:36.080 --> 2:44:42.520]  They have no control once they die and cross into the spirit world. They will be judged and sentenced to the appropriate
[2:44:43.040 --> 2:44:45.040]  afterlife they've earned from themselves
[2:44:45.080 --> 2:44:48.640]  So what they're doing is completely insane and they will not win
[2:44:49.400 --> 2:44:52.440]  So I just want to totally agree with you because I've studied the globalist
[2:44:53.080 --> 2:44:56.080]  Snuck into Bohemian Grove and things they really do rituals
[2:44:56.760 --> 2:44:58.760]  believing they're going to get out of
[2:44:58.760 --> 2:45:06.880]  Reput you so or their karma that's insane anybody that has common sense can see in the universe that that you get stuff instantly
[2:45:06.880 --> 2:45:10.560]  but you also get it later and and it just it's I
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:17.880]  Just wish the globalist would stop it. Why do you think Bill Gates and all these people have such a crazed desire to kill people? I
[2:45:19.280 --> 2:45:25.240]  Honestly think that what's happened to them is that they have slipped so far into the path of darkness
[2:45:25.240 --> 2:45:32.800]  spiritually because see your body physically lives in a realm of physical matter which you talked about which is kind of like a hologram
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:40.560]  but your soul vibrates in different dimensions and that's right when you become satanic you enter the satanic dimension and they're able to get you
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:45.160]  That's it. They don't understand. They're completely out of touch with reality. Exactly
[2:45:45.680 --> 2:45:50.000]  And that's why they get possessed by them want more and more more because they get deeper and deeper into it
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:54.800]  Absolutely, and everybody that's just connected to God knows that God bless you. I appreciate your call
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:46:00.040]  Let's go ahead and take another call here. Let's jam in who's been holding the longest here
[2:46:00.040 --> 2:46:05.680]  Oh, Anna just called in and she's about Antifa coming to rural areas. I was about to go to her but she hung up
[2:46:05.920 --> 2:46:11.320]  So I guess up next is chase in California has his own show chase the Patriot go ahead chase
[2:46:12.520 --> 2:46:15.480]  Alex we've got some unintentional great news here
[2:46:15.480 --> 2:46:21.600]  So Bill Gates has been trying to get these digital tattoos on everyone, but you beat him to it
[2:46:21.600 --> 2:46:24.840]  You have officially digitally tattooed Bill Gates
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:27.920]  If anybody goes to Bill Gates is wiki
[2:46:28.560 --> 2:46:35.320]  Wikipedia page if you scroll all the way to the bottom it talks about info wars and Alex Jones and the
[2:46:35.840 --> 2:46:41.120]  Conspiracy around the COVID-19 corona virus. I saw that I kind of enjoy that. Oh
[2:46:41.120 --> 2:46:48.360]  It's great and when they start following the breadcrumbs it leads him leads them to the conspiracy of the Wuhan lab
[2:46:48.560 --> 2:46:55.840]  So really now you think there's gonna be all these kids that do school reports on all the entrepreneurs and all the big billionaires and
[2:46:56.040 --> 2:47:01.040]  And they're gonna go and find Bill Gates now and they're gonna find info wars and Alex Jones
[2:47:01.040 --> 2:47:06.120]  You have officially digitally tattooed Bill Gates. Well, you guys have done it spreading the word
[2:47:06.120 --> 2:47:13.360]  I mean he digitally tattooed himself because right here we have Rice University MIT saying he paid them to come up with this
[2:47:13.360 --> 2:47:17.600]  And then he's running around using another thing he funded to claim we're lying in the news
[2:47:17.600 --> 2:47:21.200]  But that's just not the case and as you said folks are gonna find out the truth, aren't they?
[2:47:21.960 --> 2:47:26.800]  Well, you said it the more that we spread the truth the more that we have
[2:47:27.160 --> 2:47:32.560]  Conversation the more that we use our First Amendment right protected still and we're gonna be able to fight
[2:47:32.560 --> 2:47:37.280]  And so that's what we have to do Fred by the way when I saw that entry somebody sent to me a few weeks ago
[2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:42.520]  I meant to go look at the wiki editing somebody to prove you can look and see who though who edited that and
[2:47:42.520 --> 2:47:46.920]  Who put that up that I'm the bad guy and Bill Gates is innocent and he loves everybody
[2:47:46.920 --> 2:47:51.800]  Hey, how about we have a few entries about him and that Jeffrey Epstein and and basically Bill Gates living with him or
[2:47:52.520 --> 2:48:00.200]  Funding the genetic experiments at Zorro Ranch. I see you Gates. I see you. All right chase the Patriot
[2:48:00.200 --> 2:48:05.640]  Tell folks when your show's on. Yeah every night of 10 o'clock on YouTube Pacific time
[2:48:05.640 --> 2:48:09.640]  I go live still an hour show and you can see me on iTunes
[2:48:09.640 --> 2:48:15.240]  I got my website and I appreciate everything you do check me out brother. I appreciate you chase the Patriot God bless you
[2:48:15.240 --> 2:48:16.520]  All right
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:18.520]  Coming up Marcos in New York
[2:48:19.400 --> 2:48:23.480]  Matt Cliff and Jeffrey I'll get you all but let me tell you baggage is great
[2:48:23.480 --> 2:48:30.400]  He's like, oh take as much time as you want today. He's like I want the full show. So he's ready to go
[2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:37.240]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms is going to now
[2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:41.360]  Trigger a worldwide depression fact. We're already into the worldwide
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:48.560]  Depression and the death sentence for the third world, but it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists
[2:48:48.560 --> 2:48:54.400]  The worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth
[2:48:54.400 --> 2:48:56.600]  It's been built up in a complex economy
[2:48:56.600 --> 2:49:00.400]  That's what we always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[2:49:00.880 --> 2:49:05.440]  Because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control
[2:49:05.920 --> 2:49:07.840]  They've admitted all of this
[2:49:07.840 --> 2:49:15.320]  So remember how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen?
[2:49:15.320 --> 2:49:21.480]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes, it's dystopic and yes
[2:49:21.480 --> 2:49:26.120]  It's scary, but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary
[2:49:26.240 --> 2:49:29.880]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening. I
[2:49:31.680 --> 2:49:38.080]  Don't have to tell you things are bad. They're worse than bad. They're crazy. That's a quote from the 1970s film network
[2:49:38.080 --> 2:49:42.080]  Yeah, things are really really bad right now. We're in global martial law villain millen gates
[2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:47.520]  You in operations try to bankrupt America with their lockdown their race rise, but people are coming together
[2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:49.440]  It's a beautiful time, but I'll be honest with you
[2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:52.960]  I have decided to sell out of all the products in the warehouse at 60% off
[2:49:52.960 --> 2:49:57.880]  We haven't done that ever across the board because gut level I realized that we're making or breaking it
[2:49:57.880 --> 2:50:03.080]  So the only sure bet is to sell everything we've got to make sure in case there's total breakdown on society in six months
[2:50:03.080 --> 2:50:05.680]  We still have the funding to go more than six months in the next year
[2:50:05.680 --> 2:50:12.520]  So get your high-quality products your fish oil your krill oil your DNA force your x2 your x3 your real red pill
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:14.520]  Plus get it all at info or store calm
[2:50:14.360 --> 2:50:18.360]  It's 60% off biggest sale ever right now it may go two days
[2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:21.000]  It may go a week whatever you do take advantage of this right now
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:25.160]  We're very important times in four seats funding and you need high quality products take action
[2:50:25.840 --> 2:50:30.320]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:50:30.320 --> 2:50:36.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:50:50.560 --> 2:50:55.520]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen taking your phone calls on this live Friday edition. I'll be back this Sunday
[2:50:56.520 --> 2:50:57.960]  That's right
[2:50:57.960 --> 2:51:01.000]  4 to 6 p.m. And wild horses can't drag me away in this time
[2:51:01.160 --> 2:51:05.920]  I'm either gonna go live tomorrow sometime in the afternoon or I'm gonna come in here and take a special report to look for that
[2:51:06.240 --> 2:51:08.240]  Because just things are so critical
[2:51:08.840 --> 2:51:16.080]  Obviously, and I want to get more into this global reset. We predicted they have a global reset and call for all this world government carbon taxes
[2:51:16.080 --> 2:51:21.960]  They've now officially done it the UN and Davos. It's just crazy how predictable everything they do is
[2:51:23.200 --> 2:51:25.200]  If people just admit the truth
[2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:30.360]  We can stop all this but you have to get in their minds and realize how evil they are until you do that
[2:51:30.360 --> 2:51:34.200]  You don't have a hope either do I by the way, we knew this was coming Paul Joseph Watson wrote an article
[2:51:34.600 --> 2:51:36.600]  They've we've been asking okay
[2:51:36.600 --> 2:51:42.840]  The nurses come out and praise the black lives matter white people running around promoting communism and the end of the family
[2:51:42.840 --> 2:51:44.840]  They're ready to do such a great job for the black folks
[2:51:45.560 --> 2:51:47.960]  But then everybody else should stay locked down in the economy
[2:51:47.960 --> 2:51:50.760]  We should say lockdown to hurt the economy to hurt Trump and America
[2:51:50.760 --> 2:51:56.680]  But now they've officially said if you're protesting you're allowed to go out. Everybody else needs to stay in
[2:51:56.800 --> 2:52:02.000]  The left says that fighting white supremacist is a bigger threat than COVID-19
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:09.080]  And so you're only allowed in black lives matter or antifa says to go out and they're gonna keep you in your house and beat you
[2:52:09.080 --> 2:52:11.080]  So you don't spread COVID-19
[2:52:11.880 --> 2:52:13.880]  But they're allowed to be out so
[2:52:14.280 --> 2:52:17.160]  It's like in the animal farm where they say
[2:52:17.160 --> 2:52:22.480]  At first a four legs good two legs bad but once the pigs take over kick the humans out
[2:52:22.480 --> 2:52:27.800]  They move into the house they go. Oh, actually two legs are good four legs are good by the end
[2:52:27.800 --> 2:52:32.040]  They're like four legs bad two legs good and they're walking around like humans
[2:52:33.040 --> 2:52:36.720]  So there you go ladies and gentlemen
[2:52:37.440 --> 2:52:41.400]  Four legs bad two legs good true animal farm George R. Well comes true
[2:52:41.400 --> 2:52:48.160]  Only antifa is allowed to walk the streets. They are the chosen academics and methods
[2:52:48.280 --> 2:52:52.280]  They are the kings all of you are Nazis in your houses
[2:52:53.360 --> 2:52:55.600]  White allies shut your mouths
[2:53:01.600 --> 2:53:04.200]  Cliff in Florida you're on the air welcome
[2:53:04.200 --> 2:53:12.280]  Hey Alex, thank you for thank you for taking my call and I really appreciate it and I want to say one thing
[2:53:12.280 --> 2:53:15.480]  I want to preface what I was going to say
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:22.120]  Anybody who's been a victim of police brutality or any type of violence
[2:53:23.560 --> 2:53:25.080]  My prayers are with your family
[2:53:25.960 --> 2:53:28.920]  But for two years I was a content moderator
[2:53:29.800 --> 2:53:31.800]  For Facebook
[2:53:31.800 --> 2:53:33.800]  Facebook um

[2:53:52.040 --> 2:53:58.040]  Okay, let me preface this a little bit about me. My mom and my dad are from Haiti. I'm a first generation
[2:53:58.680 --> 2:54:00.680]  American and
[2:54:00.680 --> 2:54:07.880]  Um, what's happening is disgusting. Um, I can tell you basically everything about Facebook

[2:54:11.720 --> 2:54:13.720]  Um face goldie
[2:54:14.200 --> 2:54:22.120]  Um, you Gavin the proud boys and I'm saying all this to say this that there were people that work
[2:54:22.920 --> 2:54:26.760]  That that work there in that facility in Tampa and we said
[2:54:26.760 --> 2:54:33.400]  Antifa should be designated as a terrorist group. He said this years ago
[2:54:33.800 --> 2:54:37.720]  I said that this is crazy. What they're saying online
[2:54:38.280 --> 2:54:41.800]  So I'm going to preface it again. I was a content moderator my job
[2:54:42.120 --> 2:54:47.800]  And I was in a high priority too. My job is to watch Facebook live videos
[2:54:48.680 --> 2:54:50.840]  I know what the protocols are Alex
[2:54:50.840 --> 2:54:56.760]  The many as a moderator you're watching what's happening on that screen. I'm going to say it again
[2:54:57.240 --> 2:54:59.720]  The media and Facebook is lying to everybody
[2:55:00.200 --> 2:55:06.440]  They're harming everybody in intentionally because I know what those protocols are cliff. Listen, don't hang up cliff cliff
[2:55:07.320 --> 2:55:12.920]  This is amazing. I can hear the reality in your voice. Can you come on the show tomorrow at 11 30 for 30 minutes?

[2:55:23.640 --> 2:55:26.840]  What I mean is I can hear how pissed you are because you've experienced the lies

[2:55:41.960 --> 2:55:46.680]  And the evil side of me is just so tired of waiting and I'm so ready for physical war
[2:55:46.680 --> 2:55:54.040]  That I'm kind of happy about how bad things have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand up for the unborn babies
[2:55:54.120 --> 2:55:57.640]  That go along with the new world order. You're about to find out just how sick stuff is
[2:55:57.640 --> 2:56:01.480]  But you know what the average person is still asleep. They don't deserve what's happening to them
[2:56:01.720 --> 2:56:03.560]  So I'm actually sick
[2:56:03.560 --> 2:56:08.840]  About what's unfolding right now and I just want to turn things around but you know what I can't do that without you
[2:56:09.640 --> 2:56:12.600]  I can't get out of this mess. I can't get out of this stranglehold
[2:56:12.600 --> 2:56:18.360]  I'm in unless you decide to get out of as well. We're all in this together. And so if you just realize how important you are
[2:56:18.520 --> 2:56:21.720]  When you just tell people about the local radio stations listening to local tv stations
[2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:24.680]  When you just spread the word about info wars dot com forward slash show
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:28.920]  When you just buy the products info wars store dot com it changes the world right now
[2:56:28.920 --> 2:56:36.440]  We've got a special that's about to end 60 percent off across the board flash sale that funds the info war and gets you great
[2:56:36.440 --> 2:56:42.920]  Prodigy at the same time info wars store dot com
[2:56:43.880 --> 2:56:48.040]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[2:56:48.680 --> 2:56:50.680]  It's alex jones
[2:56:51.160 --> 2:56:55.000]  All right, dr. Nick baggage has got some big medicine for us some big mojo
[2:56:55.080 --> 2:56:57.720]  He's taken over here in a few minutes, but I promise to finish up with these calls
[2:56:58.120 --> 2:57:03.400]  So I can just give person each person one minute and the war room's coming up at about 55 minutes from now
[2:57:03.400 --> 2:57:05.960]  Uh cliff we got his name his number
[2:57:06.280 --> 2:57:11.480]  He was a facebook moderator and he's going to be joining us at 11 30 central tomorrow 30 minutes into the show
[2:57:11.720 --> 2:57:13.960]  So he has at least 20 minutes of airtime
[2:57:14.760 --> 2:57:15.880]  Or so
[2:57:15.880 --> 2:57:20.120]  To be able to break down exactly what's happening, but I hear your anger. I hear your concern
[2:57:20.520 --> 2:57:22.520]  You'll be joining us tomorrow
[2:57:22.680 --> 2:57:26.120]  If the planet doesn't blow up, but just in 60 seconds
[2:57:27.640 --> 2:57:29.640]  Encapsulate what's really going on at facebook
[2:57:29.640 --> 2:57:33.800]  Antifa right now they have there's a new facebook messenger
[2:57:34.760 --> 2:57:36.840]  Um feature that they're promoting
[2:57:37.160 --> 2:57:43.560]  I haven't been on that platform really for the last couple of years because I've been censored since I've been trying to wear
[2:57:43.800 --> 2:57:48.440]  Um raise awareness about what's going on, but this messenger feature
[2:57:48.920 --> 2:57:53.640]  It allows you basically to have facebook groups just totally private
[2:57:54.280 --> 2:57:57.720]  So only the members, but it's not like a public group
[2:57:57.720 --> 2:58:03.400]  And when I went on the messenger earlier today just for curiosity's sake
[2:58:03.640 --> 2:58:09.880]  I just put antifa in the search bar. There's antifa. It's breaking down in regions
[2:58:10.440 --> 2:58:12.440]  And stuff like that. I wouldn't
[2:58:12.520 --> 2:58:19.640]  Recommend anybody goats. Um communicate with these people if they're designated terrorists. You're probably talking to a cop anyway, but
[2:58:20.200 --> 2:58:26.360]  Um antifa has a heavy presence. They've had a presence and I'm going to say it again
[2:58:26.360 --> 2:58:30.760]  When faith go the alex jones, um gavin tommy
[2:58:31.560 --> 2:58:38.280]  All you guys were getting censored. I was like, look, this is not fair. Um antifa is wiling out and
[2:58:38.920 --> 2:58:40.360]  They're promoting violence
[2:58:40.360 --> 2:58:47.320]  I think that they're responsible for information being spread on the internet with all the trails from trains being derailed
[2:58:47.320 --> 2:58:55.000]  I spoke up about it and they blew us off. They've been blowing us off facebook is one of the most
[2:58:56.280 --> 2:59:01.080]  Horrible places to work for much less as a minority and I'm a republican
[2:59:01.720 --> 2:59:03.720]  Listen, I don't even
[2:59:03.720 --> 2:59:07.320]  We're out of time cliff promise me tomorrow. You're gonna be on the show. He'll tell us all about it. All right
[2:59:07.480 --> 2:59:12.760]  Oh, yeah, definitely. Um, thank you and um, have a great one. No, thank you, sir. Have a great. Oh not tomorrow

[2:59:24.040 --> 2:59:25.400]  Are you want to come on monday?
[2:59:25.400 --> 2:59:30.120]  Um, it's on you. Um, um, yeah sunday's fine, but definitely you might want to
[2:59:30.600 --> 2:59:35.000]  Like definitely you guys can vet me if you want to do a pre-production type of meeting
[2:59:35.400 --> 2:59:39.320]  I was sure. I mean, I mean, I can tell you're credible and we already have all the project veritas stuff confirming all this
[2:59:39.320 --> 2:59:42.760]  But if you want to shoot it's over your stuff so we know so we can see you prove who you are in fact
[2:59:42.760 --> 2:59:47.240]  I was going to do that. Absolutely. God bless you. We'll talk sunday hour two of the show
[2:59:47.640 --> 2:59:50.040]  God bless you. Thank you so much cliff. Make sure that happens guys
[2:59:50.040 --> 2:59:52.600]  Don't let me forget because I forget what day it is. Everybody knows now
[2:59:52.920 --> 2:59:56.040]  I need a vacation folks. Dr. Nick baggage is about to take over
[2:59:56.760 --> 2:59:58.280]  He's got so much to cover
[2:59:58.280 --> 3:00:02.840]  I want to go to marcos in new york on cold springs harbor lab has its own youtube channel on eugenics
[3:00:02.840 --> 3:00:06.360]  I did not know that tell me the channel on this marcos. I got to know about it
[3:00:07.320 --> 3:00:11.640]  Hey, alex here. Thanks for taking my call. Yeah, I just want to tell people that yes cold springs har
[3:00:11.640 --> 3:00:15.560]  Our harbor laboratory has its own youtube channel
[3:00:15.960 --> 3:00:22.840]  I encourage anybody to look at a video on their youtube channel called eugenics a historical perspective
[3:00:23.080 --> 3:00:29.880]  They go over the fact that they've been there they admit alex that there is an as an international eugenics movement
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:38.040]  And they influence lawmakers to pass bills to sterilize people and they talk about that they've been doing it for like over 100 years
[3:00:38.040 --> 3:00:45.240]  Oh, yeah, bill gates his dad's involved. That's what I'm telling you. It's not even hitting the head of cold springs harbor said black people aren't humans
[3:00:45.800 --> 3:00:50.200]  David, I know alex and none of these eugenics are black and they act like the local cops
[3:00:50.600 --> 3:00:56.680]  Are enemies when everybody in america has friends and family who are local police officers or militants
[3:00:56.680 --> 3:00:59.320]  No, exactly the globalists are telling us the cops are the enemy
[3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:04.760]  And then cold springs harbour basically runs microsoft and ibm and literally wants to slaughter everybody
[3:01:04.760 --> 3:01:10.680]  Absolutely alex. I woke up to this as a young science student because I was reading the scientific literature
[3:01:10.840 --> 3:01:13.320]  And I said dude, this is wrong. I had a christian background
[3:01:13.320 --> 3:01:16.760]  I said this is wrong and and I started looking at it from a different angle
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:22.040]  I found out about you and alex it was only very recently that I found out that the
[3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:27.640]  The person who wrote the the book that I thought was a perverting the natural order
[3:01:28.120 --> 3:01:31.160]  Is funded by bill gates like it's all connected every time
[3:01:31.160 --> 3:01:36.200]  Oh, it's it's the eugenics cult brother and that's what's so scary about it. And then you find out they're all sickos
[3:01:36.280 --> 3:01:43.080]  They're involved with jeffrey eppstein. They're doing secret breeding programs. They're out of control and that new netflix show is a total
[3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:48.680]  Disgusting whitewash. It's meant to put the whole thing to bed that is jeffrey eppstein. No, he's just a frontman
[3:01:49.400 --> 3:01:54.280]  Marcus, I'm out of time. Dr. Nick baggage has taken over. I'm sorry to matt. I'm sorry to jeffrey
[3:01:54.760 --> 3:01:58.440]  Um, if you guys will simply call me back on sunday, you'll go to the head of the line
[3:01:58.440 --> 3:02:00.440]  Dr. Nick baggage again
[3:02:01.080 --> 3:02:06.440]  Is a top scientist researcher author who's exposed 26 7 years ago
[3:02:06.760 --> 3:02:12.200]  The whole architecture of this is predicted it coming and he says he's got big news analysis and also good news today
[3:02:12.280 --> 3:02:17.160]  So i'm gonna be listening. He takes over right now. Please do not forget ladies and gentlemen that without you
[3:02:17.160 --> 3:02:19.160]  We're not gonna be here
[3:02:19.160 --> 3:02:23.560]  And this big mega sale that is the biggest we've done this year one of the biggest ever is going to have to end this weekend
[3:02:23.560 --> 3:02:25.560]  It will be over this weekend

[3:02:47.640 --> 3:02:49.000]  Dr. Nick baggage
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  now ladies and gentlemen
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:57.160]  Taking over and I can't wait to hear all the things that he's got to talk about earth pulse dot com earth pulse dot com
[3:02:57.320 --> 3:02:59.320]  dr. Beggots, thank you
[3:02:59.320 --> 3:03:03.320]  Hey, thank you very much. Alex and hey, it's great to be here on this particular
[3:03:03.880 --> 3:03:08.280]  Uh friday afternoon, you know in in my world still in the morning before noon
[3:03:08.920 --> 3:03:15.640]  But you know this week I have had like this incredible week of activity and a lot of different venues and a lot of different things
[3:03:15.640 --> 3:03:20.520]  and and this is the message for the day that I want to get into and and and
[3:03:21.480 --> 3:03:24.760]  Alex hit on this point when he read the definition of a slave
[3:03:25.720 --> 3:03:29.080]  A slave. I want you to think about that definition. We heard earlier
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:34.120]  But this is what I want to talk about three levels of slavery and we're going to put this in context
[3:03:34.200 --> 3:03:39.320]  The levels of slavery are the physical form the body that carries our awareness
[3:03:39.880 --> 3:03:41.880]  That carries our soul
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:45.480]  Slavery of the mind in terms of what we think
[3:03:46.040 --> 3:03:49.080]  Slavery of the feeling the heart the mind
[3:03:49.720 --> 3:03:53.800]  And the soul these three components body mind soul
[3:03:54.600 --> 3:03:56.600]  All three require healing
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:03:59.080]  All three require attention
[3:03:59.960 --> 3:04:07.000]  In a different way with a different force a different look at what we're doing and so today to set the context
[3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:09.240]  How do I get ready for a show?
[3:04:09.240 --> 3:04:12.040]  People wonder about that sometimes. I'll tell you how I do
[3:04:12.760 --> 3:04:18.280]  I pray a little bit. I pray a lot actually and I end up crying usually because of not grief
[3:04:19.080 --> 3:04:22.040]  Not sadness. Okay, none of that
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  but out of gratitude
[3:04:25.560 --> 3:04:33.160]  For the opportunity to use my voice. I'm 61 years old. I've known my entire life that it's about
[3:04:34.040 --> 3:04:36.040]  the word
[3:04:36.040 --> 3:04:42.280]  Creation begins with the word. I know that is an absolute truth
[3:04:43.160 --> 3:04:46.360]  What I'm trying to do today as I want to equip you
[3:04:47.720 --> 3:04:52.280]  With knowledge that will fortify you in a way that's different
[3:04:53.160 --> 3:04:55.160]  That will hopefully
[3:04:55.400 --> 3:04:56.440]  even
[3:04:56.440 --> 3:05:00.920]  Create a bit of transfiguration a bit of transformation
[3:05:00.920 --> 3:05:09.240]  A bit of recognition of what we each are and so I want to do that today. I hope I can achieve that today
[3:05:09.880 --> 3:05:11.880]  That's my intention today
[3:05:12.760 --> 3:05:14.520]  Is to change
[3:05:14.520 --> 3:05:16.040]  our direction
[3:05:16.040 --> 3:05:20.600]  A bit just a little bit not in terms of what we do how we do it
[3:05:20.680 --> 3:05:26.120]  But a direction that goes a little bit inside a little bit of self reflection
[3:05:26.120 --> 3:05:31.160]  So that what we manifest as a light from the inside out
[3:05:31.800 --> 3:05:33.800]  Can be seen again
[3:05:33.880 --> 3:05:35.880]  Can be touched again
[3:05:35.880 --> 3:05:39.800]  Can be felt again by anyone in your presence because that
[3:05:40.600 --> 3:05:42.600]  Is the beginning of the chain
[3:05:42.920 --> 3:05:45.240]  That is what is needed right now
[3:05:45.960 --> 3:05:47.960]  Right now in this very moment
[3:05:48.120 --> 3:05:51.880]  And so I made a bunch of notes and I try to refer to them a little bit
[3:05:51.880 --> 3:05:56.680]  And I usually don't and the notes are just like these flashes that I want to make sure I don't miss
[3:05:57.160 --> 3:06:01.320]  And so you'll see me looking away from the camera and that's that's what I'm looking here's my notes
[3:06:01.400 --> 3:06:05.400]  They're not really complicated, but there are a few words that remind me
[3:06:05.960 --> 3:06:09.560]  Of of of what I know I need to deliver today. So that's what that's about
[3:06:10.040 --> 3:06:13.640]  And so this show is about that I would like you to really really
[3:06:15.080 --> 3:06:16.680]  Go in with me
[3:06:16.680 --> 3:06:21.160]  Go deep with me have this conversation with me and when we go off the air
[3:06:21.160 --> 3:06:23.160]  I want you to reflect on what said
[3:06:23.480 --> 3:06:27.960]  Consider what said and I mean no offense if I offend anyone in what I say
[3:06:28.680 --> 3:06:33.320]  God I ask for forgiveness right now because that is not where my heart is today
[3:06:33.800 --> 3:06:37.720]  So I want to touch you in a special way. This is dr. Nick Beck which in the info works
[3:06:37.880 --> 3:06:40.600]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism
[3:06:41.080 --> 3:06:45.800]  And so populist movements are throwing the globalist out of their countries
[3:06:46.120 --> 3:06:49.480]  That's why the new world order is instituting race war and division
[3:06:49.480 --> 3:06:57.240]  And telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services
[3:06:57.960 --> 3:07:03.960]  This is an attempt to have society collapse and the globalists as they've done in the third world
[3:07:04.200 --> 3:07:06.200]  Will come in and pick up the pieces
[3:07:06.280 --> 3:07:12.440]  He must stand against the un the imf the world bank and the e you openly saying the fund the police
[3:07:12.840 --> 3:07:15.320]  The police have a lot of problems. We all have a lot of problems
[3:07:15.320 --> 3:07:20.520]  But this is our government and our local vocabulary and believe me once the globalists have overthrown this country
[3:07:21.240 --> 3:07:25.080]  They are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom
[3:07:25.240 --> 3:07:30.920]  The globalists believe communist china is the model of the world and they are orchestrating this entire thing
[3:07:31.160 --> 3:07:37.240]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed info wars dot com
[3:07:38.280 --> 3:07:43.560]  What info wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth
[3:07:43.560 --> 3:07:47.480]  Has been nothing short of historic and truly epic
[3:07:48.200 --> 3:07:51.400]  This is the battle for the future of humanity
[3:07:51.960 --> 3:07:55.000]  And now open world government is being established
[3:07:55.640 --> 3:07:58.760]  With an end game to depopulate the planet
[3:07:59.400 --> 3:08:04.040]  Now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized
[3:08:04.760 --> 3:08:06.760]  You must decide which side you're on
[3:08:07.400 --> 3:08:09.960]  Living in denial having mass dot com syndrome
[3:08:09.960 --> 3:08:13.880]  Learned out the sense will only deliver you into misery destruction
[3:08:14.440 --> 3:08:16.280]  And finally death
[3:08:16.280 --> 3:08:20.280]  And this is a spiritual death. We're talking about not just a physical death
[3:08:20.840 --> 3:08:22.840]  The delusions must end now
[3:08:23.400 --> 3:08:28.200]  Info wars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy
[3:08:28.840 --> 3:08:31.880]  Most people that are aware of the new world order decide to join it out of fear
[3:08:31.880 --> 3:08:39.640]  They are truly fools. We must fight this or lose our souls
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:43.640]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:43.640 --> 3:09:05.960]  The alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind with nick begge
[3:09:05.960 --> 3:09:13.240]  And welcome back, you know, it's so good to be here and as we left off, you know
[3:09:13.560 --> 3:09:17.240]  Talking about the message for the day, you know, I want to get into this a little bit
[3:09:17.800 --> 3:09:22.440]  The voice and the word I want to talk about that and why I take this so seriously
[3:09:23.160 --> 3:09:25.400]  What I do when I when I am in the public
[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:30.120]  Because what I say if it changes someone I carry responsibility
[3:09:30.680 --> 3:09:33.480]  You see I'm responsible for the words
[3:09:33.480 --> 3:09:37.400]  Because I'm created in the image and likeness of God, which is what I believe
[3:09:37.720 --> 3:09:42.920]  This is what Christians believe what Jews believe and what Muslims believe. This is what we believe
[3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:50.200]  Okay, if we really believe that and I do I truly do if we really believe that
[3:09:50.680 --> 3:09:54.920]  Then it makes us have to act a different way and see through a lens
[3:09:54.920 --> 3:09:59.400]  Differently when we look in the eyes of another soul. Now, there's two parts to that
[3:09:59.400 --> 3:10:04.760]  When you look in the eyes and you look deep, you can see the full potential of that the
[3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:10.280]  Curness of the creation of that the image the reflection of God that is in that human being
[3:10:10.600 --> 3:10:14.440]  When you look deep into their eyes, you can see this
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:18.040]  I saw that only until I was 52 years old
[3:10:18.680 --> 3:10:25.400]  Nine years ago, I had an awakening in the moment where I realized that I was seeing the truth
[3:10:25.400 --> 3:10:28.840]  But I was missing the flesh
[3:10:29.160 --> 3:10:31.320]  You see what the Bible calls the flesh
[3:10:32.040 --> 3:10:38.040]  The shell what I call our carrier our body our physical form in the world and it's finite
[3:10:38.040 --> 3:10:42.840]  It has a time clock attached to it as a beginning and an end and it's really brief
[3:10:42.840 --> 3:10:47.800]  It's about 80 years, maybe a hundred if you're really really lucky and here's the deal about that
[3:10:48.280 --> 3:10:51.320]  That makes time extraordinarily precious
[3:10:51.320 --> 3:10:58.440]  Precious if you really contemplate it so the closer you get to the end of your time the more valuable the time becomes and in that last second
[3:10:58.760 --> 3:11:03.400]  Your last second on the planet is worth a million dollars at a minimum, right?
[3:11:04.040 --> 3:11:06.040]  And then when you leave
[3:11:06.440 --> 3:11:12.440]  To the other side and you drop the shell and the pain that's associated with it and you leave to the other side
[3:11:12.440 --> 3:11:14.440]  You fall into eternity
[3:11:15.240 --> 3:11:18.760]  Where the marginal value of time goes to zero
[3:11:18.760 --> 3:11:22.360]  Zero it has no value anymore. Could you have an infinite supply?
[3:11:23.160 --> 3:11:25.160]  This is extremely important
[3:11:25.720 --> 3:11:30.200]  To recognize because so much of the fear that we experience in life
[3:11:30.840 --> 3:11:33.800]  Is the carrier worrying about its exit strategy?
[3:11:34.360 --> 3:11:35.480]  You know
[3:11:35.480 --> 3:11:39.480]  And and the timing of it usually and nobody gets to control any of that
[3:11:39.480 --> 3:11:44.120]  My dad died when I was 14 in a very unusual way and you can see a video on it
[3:11:44.120 --> 3:11:48.440]  It's called breaking the zombie trance. It's also called breaking the zombie trance
[3:11:48.440 --> 3:11:50.360]  It's on bandad videos
[3:11:50.360 --> 3:11:54.440]  Go look at it and it'll tell you that story, but it was a transforming moment
[3:11:54.440 --> 3:11:59.160]  It was the biggest tragedy of my life when my dad disappeared when I was 14 years old and was lost
[3:11:59.560 --> 3:12:05.400]  Never found never recovered in its long story. I won't go there today, but it was a transformative moment
[3:12:06.200 --> 3:12:10.760]  There was another one I had that I don't talk about very much and there's a lot of pain associated with it
[3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:17.240]  But when I was 19, I lost everything financially. I collapsed the business. I failed miserably
[3:12:17.240 --> 3:12:23.240]  I heard a lot of people because I was a very compelling and convincing person with my voice
[3:12:23.960 --> 3:12:29.080]  And I learned something about my voice that I could not use it until I had the wisdom that was
[3:12:29.720 --> 3:12:32.360]  Necessary so I would not do damage with my voice
[3:12:33.240 --> 3:12:35.640]  Because I realized the damage I had done
[3:12:36.600 --> 3:12:39.000]  And I was broken in every way
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:46.520]  And I hitchhiked out of Alaska with the last hundred and one dollars I had and I slept under bridges all the way to Dallas
[3:12:47.480 --> 3:12:49.480]  Where an uncle of my first wife
[3:12:50.360 --> 3:12:56.440]  Had taken her and my two children in long enough for me to settle my affairs in Alaska and try and start over
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:13:00.280]  In Dallas and I did and I lived under the poverty level for three years
[3:13:00.760 --> 3:13:03.160]  Because I would not accept help from my family
[3:13:03.160 --> 3:13:10.440]  And I would not do it any other way and I would not use my voice to make money to make a living to do anything
[3:13:11.400 --> 3:13:13.400]  and I learned a lot
[3:13:13.800 --> 3:13:16.040]  And I prayed for three years for wisdom
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:22.520]  And had I known the price of wisdom in 19, I might have asked for grace and I really recommend it highly
[3:13:23.240 --> 3:13:28.680]  Because the pain associated with learning anything is extreme and it's and it hurts a lot
[3:13:28.680 --> 3:13:34.600]  But it only hurts the shell in the time zone we're in and we have a bigger time zone coming
[3:13:35.080 --> 3:13:38.920]  But my son brought this to my attention as we talked about this yesterday
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:40.600]  this idea
[3:13:40.600 --> 3:13:46.680]  Of the timeline and why I feel anxiety so often because I know the time grows shorter and shorter
[3:13:46.680 --> 3:13:50.200]  And I don't know when the end is when the last million dollars second is going to happen
[3:13:50.920 --> 3:13:55.400]  And when the leap to the other side where I got all the time in the world to chase whatever I'm interested in
[3:13:55.400 --> 3:13:58.840]  And I'm doing some projects in Anchorage right now for the homeless
[3:13:58.840 --> 3:14:04.840]  And I brought together three legislators to assembly members two commissioners from the state level and a whole bunch of other people around an issue
[3:14:04.840 --> 3:14:09.800]  That I really don't want to get involved in on a lot of levels. So I have things. I'm really excited about my life
[3:14:10.680 --> 3:14:14.360]  But I got tapped on the shoulder and said you got to go be a voice for this for a little while
[3:14:14.360 --> 3:14:18.200]  So I said, okay, and I'm doing it and I'm doing it and it's coming out really well
[3:14:18.200 --> 3:14:22.280]  And I'm doing some things there that are really cool and it's intervention 2020
[3:14:22.280 --> 3:14:26.760]  2020.com and people can go look at that and it doesn't mean much to the rest of the nation
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:31.640]  But the point of the matter is I stopped everything I was doing because I heard the call
[3:14:32.520 --> 3:14:35.480]  And I understand when it happens and even if I don't like it, I do it
[3:14:36.040 --> 3:14:39.240]  And then I know that all the other things I think are so important in my life
[3:14:39.720 --> 3:14:41.320]  That have a clock on them
[3:14:41.320 --> 3:14:46.280]  That are falling behind in my head in my form in my body in my flesh that's worrying about that
[3:14:46.840 --> 3:14:48.840]  I finally figured it out
[3:14:48.840 --> 3:14:54.040]  God has always taken one step that saves me a thousand in those moments and in this week
[3:14:54.040 --> 3:14:56.360]  I've experienced that I don't have time to talk about it today
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:14:57.880]  but
[3:14:57.880 --> 3:14:59.880]  Steps were taken that moved me
[3:15:00.520 --> 3:15:03.320]  Ahead in a way that allowed me to do all the things I do
[3:15:03.880 --> 3:15:08.760]  That I that I give in life and I never I never I don't draw a dime what I do in the public
[3:15:08.760 --> 3:15:14.680]  You know anymore. I do this for free. This is this is what I do because this is my gift and we all have one
[3:15:14.680 --> 3:15:18.520]  And our gift begins with our word the beginning of creation
[3:15:19.400 --> 3:15:27.080]  Our reflection of the creator is our word and how we decide to use it because the word is a sword that we can keep sheath
[3:15:27.960 --> 3:15:34.440]  Or we can use responsibly in a way that changes things and people want to judge the way we use our words and people condemn me sometimes
[3:15:34.760 --> 3:15:38.120]  And if people get all over alex a lot too, and I don't like that one bit
[3:15:38.120 --> 3:15:44.440]  Not one bit because alex has a different way of delivering the message that certain people need to hear and most people
[3:15:45.240 --> 3:15:46.840]  hear that message
[3:15:46.840 --> 3:15:54.120]  Who understand the frustration that comes out of the core of who alex jones is who my friend alex jones is
[3:15:54.680 --> 3:15:59.160]  Because he's passionate and he cares and the time clock keeps getting shorter for all of us
[3:15:59.240 --> 3:16:03.800]  So we've been at this a very long time and we need your help and I hear him use that phrase
[3:16:03.800 --> 3:16:08.520]  We need your help frank. You need your whole frank and I'm sure frank feels like crap right now
[3:16:09.320 --> 3:16:10.520]  and
[3:16:10.520 --> 3:16:13.160]  Maybe he should because sometimes the truth wakes us up
[3:16:14.120 --> 3:16:17.640]  But I forgive frank because I forgive frank for this reason
[3:16:18.200 --> 3:16:23.320]  He doesn't know what he's doing. It's not that he's mean spirited or means badly. I don't think he does
[3:16:23.400 --> 3:16:25.400]  I don't think most people ever do
[3:16:25.480 --> 3:16:28.120]  But frank does not have all the information
[3:16:29.240 --> 3:16:31.240]  That's the thing that's missing
[3:16:31.240 --> 3:16:34.200]  We need to be the deliverers of information
[3:16:34.520 --> 3:16:38.520]  Which means we have to find a better delivery system all of us one that fits everybody
[3:16:38.840 --> 3:16:42.520]  And some people respond to a loud strong powerful voice
[3:16:43.080 --> 3:16:48.200]  And others respond to a different voice and the voices that we have on alex jones
[3:16:48.520 --> 3:16:53.560]  Are all of those voices and these voices are meant to do two things to awaken
[3:16:54.360 --> 3:16:59.880]  And to heal and in the awakening sometimes is judgment. Those of us making judgments
[3:16:59.880 --> 3:17:02.600]  We are called to a higher court
[3:17:03.560 --> 3:17:07.000]  We are called to a very high court when we judge another soul
[3:17:07.640 --> 3:17:11.800]  God is the judge of all souls including our own. Let him do his work
[3:17:11.960 --> 3:17:15.400]  Please let god do its work. Let god make it happen
[3:17:16.120 --> 3:17:19.800]  In terms of judging our souls. Let's judge our internal soul
[3:17:19.880 --> 3:17:23.880]  What we're doing right now and how we're doing it. Are we the best? Are we trying our best?
[3:17:23.960 --> 3:17:26.600]  Have we made mistakes that we've forgiven ourselves?
[3:17:26.600 --> 3:17:31.400]  For those mistakes as a beginning point and ask for the forgiveness of those we've damaged
[3:17:31.400 --> 3:17:57.400]  This is the info war. It's time to change

[3:21:05.400 --> 3:21:25.400]  And I'm back and you know I was always forget to run my own commercial I gotta at least say this sign up at earthholds.com for my newsletter and newsflashes I'm going to reactivate those as a way to communicate to people a little more efficiently with written things so I can kind of take some of this at least and get it out in that form
[3:21:25.400 --> 3:21:40.400]  And I really want you to sign up I won't burden you with a bunch of garbage I will only do it once once every few weeks or even a month because I'm really busy but I need I need that vehicle to talk to you and to give you tools so we can use those tools to hand out to others so

[3:21:55.400 --> 3:22:10.400]  Now the other thing I'm working on that I want to tell people about and the reason you want to be on that list is I'm going into some long play video where I'm going to spend some hours dissecting some of these important issues and I'm going to make them available for free on the various platforms
[3:22:10.400 --> 3:22:23.400]  And I have YouTube's band Alex and that's a bummer and I'm going to go there but I'm going to go on Spotify and every other one that the team I've begun to talk to here in Anchorage that are going to help me do this because I can't do this alone I can't do it.
[3:22:23.400 --> 3:22:31.400]  It's just me sitting in Anchorage I need some help and I got it arriving so I got some local production talent that we're talking about how to do this.
[3:22:31.400 --> 3:22:42.400]  And again what I told them is I said look I want to show up I want to give my content I want to get it out so help me in that way get on our list so I can let you know when that's going on and then you can dial into those.
[3:22:42.400 --> 3:22:55.400]  And I want to link them up through the info wars make them available every way we can and distribute them everywhere we can and they'll be for free okay I don't want anything I just want to make sure you have what I need to tell you at least what my heart is saying.
[3:22:55.400 --> 3:23:03.400]  So I want to get back to the topic of the day and let me jump into this is is when I was before I lost everything when I was 19.
[3:23:03.400 --> 3:23:12.400]  I have configured this concept of a mastermind and it was the idea of linking a bunch of people together that we would get together we talk we have conversations.
[3:23:12.400 --> 3:23:22.400]  And then from that something unique would happen and what I learned over the last 25 years is this is called human resonance and here's how it works when you link people together like.
[3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:26.400]  Gather together you know two or more you know something happens here's what happens.
[3:23:26.400 --> 3:23:35.400]  X plus X is in brackets with a two outside the brackets squares it so you have to multiply that some by itself.
[3:23:35.400 --> 3:23:42.400]  It doubles it up its power see it doubles it up so the more you put in that link and square it the more.
[3:23:42.400 --> 3:23:47.400]  It just goes like a funnel man in the big end keeps getting bigger and the action keeps getting larger.
[3:23:47.400 --> 3:24:03.400]  So what we do together we really do this and I mean this every conversation I have with every single person I have every moment and every breath I take comes into my awareness and it gets projected about out of my mouth.
[3:24:03.400 --> 3:24:13.400]  That's how it all works you see when we couple our head with our heart things happen and you know the faith of a mustard seed we all go gosh I wish I could find that mustard seed.
[3:24:13.400 --> 3:24:21.400]  Let me tell you what gets in the way of the mustard seed one single mustard seed of doubt.
[3:24:21.400 --> 3:24:29.400]  Let me say that again the things that kill faith is one single mustard seed of doubt.
[3:24:29.400 --> 3:24:53.400]  A grain of the mustard seed of doubt an atom of the mustard seed of doubt kills it right out of the gate so you cannot do what you doubt and if you try that begins your internal lie you see because in your head you know you can in your heart you know you can at least at that moment but you're going to do it anyway.
[3:24:53.400 --> 3:25:12.400]  What is that it's called a train wreck about to happen you see and this is how we conduct most of our lives because the flesh the meat what we identify with what we look in the mirror and see we think is us it's not every cell in your body is going to be gone.
[3:25:12.400 --> 3:25:25.400]  You know I'm not the body I was born with it went away you know these cells replace each other it's gone but what's still hanging on the carcass was still hanging on my carrier as I call it and the Bible calls the flat I call it the carrier.
[3:25:25.400 --> 3:25:35.400]  And then what happens is we get layered up by all our experiences all the things that people are telling us we are in the culture tells us what we are and then you have all these differences in the world so you have.
[3:25:35.400 --> 3:25:52.400]  People wearing black bags as uniforms and women hiding under them and think that's okay and it is okay it's okay for them because somehow they've identified so much with this culture in this world and things in the world that they begin to reflect all that think that's who they are and we get lost in the world that's
[3:25:52.400 --> 3:26:12.400]  called getting lost ladies and gentlemen in the world and the smarter you are the more easy it is to get lost sometimes I wish I was just dumb as a rock because in the simplicity of it all makes so much easier sense but the smarter you all are and the more intelligent you are the path to God becomes really difficult
[3:26:12.400 --> 3:26:25.400]  especially when you're asking for wisdom because you're in for a train wreck and let me tell you about every tragedy I've ever had I do it a thousand times and I forgive everyone that anyone would ever say hurt in any way I forgive it a thousand
[3:26:25.400 --> 3:26:44.400]  times and the reason I do is because I know the power of forgiveness because I've received it I know the power of forgiving and what that means I know when I look in a man's eyes and a woman's eyes and I see their soul but I also see the flesh the thing that holds them back
[3:26:44.400 --> 3:27:04.400]  and what I hope to do what my total intention is as I lay my foundation for the next 20 years of my life is to try to awaken this so you can again your awareness and see your ego and see your flesh and see that part of you that is associated with the powers of the darkness
[3:27:04.400 --> 3:27:24.400]  I wrote a book about this that I never published I made a tape about this a music tape of music tape of my voice saying some words that have power in them and I wrote the manuscript I wrote it I didn't know I was writing it here it is the unpublished manuscript
[3:27:24.400 --> 3:27:39.400]  and it's called Nicholas out of the darkness and it's a reflection of my last nine years and a transformation that happened to me in this last nine years no I didn't become a Christian in the last nine years you haven't seen that in me for the last 35
[3:27:39.400 --> 3:28:04.400]  missed point and I'm not I do not like this name okay and the reason I don't is not because of what it represents in my heart in the minds of people speaking and listening right now it's the branding that's gotten screwed up you see the branding is failing you see because we think we need
[3:28:04.400 --> 3:28:22.400]  the bullets and God needs oh help to kill anyone God is not calling us that God is calling us look inside ourselves and find our divinity again and project that into the world again
[3:28:22.400 --> 3:28:46.400]  because each of us has this incredible gift and we so underestimated and we so fail ourselves in that and we fail the reflection of God in that and we condemn so easily ourselves and this is a blasphemy against the creation and I say it that boldly and I mean it
[3:28:46.400 --> 3:29:06.400]  yes to self reflect yes to improve yes to see your flaws and change them that's the transfiguration you see that is the message you see that is a transformation you see when Christ hung on the cross dying what did he say
[3:29:06.400 --> 3:29:25.400]  he said God forgive them they don't know what they're doing can you forgive them because you don't know what they're doing ignorance is not stupidity ignorance is lack of knowing knowledge comes from God and the wisdom to apply it also comes from the same source
[3:29:25.400 --> 3:29:43.400]  each of us have the power to change the world with every breath we take if our intention is to do that because writing on our voices you see and this is why I produced the tape music and I can explain it but it's not enough time today
[3:29:43.400 --> 3:30:04.400]  is because of vibration this center of my intent is carried in those words that I wrote because of the way they came and they're carried in the way they're spoken and the science see I know the science carries a submodulations of my intention right into the center of your soul
[3:30:04.400 --> 3:30:24.400]  and you're hearing my words today and if they ring true I'm appreciative of that if you don't know and they don't ring true don't worry about it everyone has a path yours is perfectly fine and I'm not going to judge it in any way I'm just going to ask one thing don't settle for warming the bench

[3:32:12.600 --> 3:32:16.840]  and for the first world it's going to mean a long horrible depression and a lot of death.
[3:32:17.640 --> 3:32:20.680]  Well for the third world it's going to mean probably over a hundred million dead according
[3:32:20.680 --> 3:32:25.480]  to the UN and I believe their numbers because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this
[3:32:25.480 --> 3:32:29.320]  to depopulate the third world. So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution
[3:32:29.320 --> 3:32:33.640]  to get rid of Trump you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into something better than what Hitler did.
[3:32:59.320 --> 3:33:03.480]  Boom I get a great night's sleep and just this past memorial day I took two of them

[3:33:41.480 --> 3:33:45.160]  going back three months ago I'm not buying storable food because I'm worried about the
[3:33:45.160 --> 3:33:49.400]  COVID-19 virus. I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now
[3:33:49.400 --> 3:33:53.720]  it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the
[3:33:53.720 --> 3:33:57.880]  collapse of farms and ranches across the United States and it's even worse in the third world.
[3:33:57.880 --> 3:34:02.440]  So I hope Trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it but with the election fraud
[3:34:02.440 --> 3:34:07.320]  and the COVID-19 all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on

[3:34:58.840 --> 3:35:05.560]  worldwide it's nick baggage you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:35:09.800 --> 3:35:13.080]  thank you guys for bearing with me I need that bit of a break
[3:35:13.080 --> 3:35:18.680]  um sorry about that I just get pretty emotional about some of this because I really want to
[3:35:18.680 --> 3:35:26.360]  make sure that it's flowing in and and I want to talk about a couple things you know leadership
[3:35:26.360 --> 3:35:29.720]  I want to talk about leadership I want to give a verse about leadership actually
[3:35:29.720 --> 3:35:37.640]  you know for and if the guys will bring it up it was for the people perish you see for the lack
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:43.160]  of leadership and and this is what's happening in the country in so many places where there is no
[3:35:43.160 --> 3:35:48.840]  vision the people perish you know it requires vision it requires a new vision a broader vision
[3:35:48.840 --> 3:35:55.480]  that's proverbs 29 18 and wisdom you know it didn't start yesterday and it doesn't start tomorrow
[3:35:55.480 --> 3:36:00.600]  it starts it's with us you see again going back into what we are what are we we're creating the
[3:36:00.600 --> 3:36:05.000]  image and lightness of God that that that says something now what does that mean maybe I mean
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:09.400]  they give us a couple ways to see that maybe visualize that think about a cell in the body
[3:36:09.400 --> 3:36:13.960]  we hear about that right you know you can't have an eye without a leg you know all this goes together
[3:36:13.960 --> 3:36:21.000]  but think of a cell also containing the DNA which is the blueprint for the whole okay so all of us
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:25.240]  that that part of us that's creating the image and lightness is that part that's the whole
[3:36:25.240 --> 3:36:31.560] ogram of the whole is if you will by analogy by comparison it's this connection so that when
[3:36:31.560 --> 3:36:35.400]  we actually look in each other's eyes you know what else we're seeing we're not just seeing
[3:36:35.400 --> 3:36:41.400]  their soul we're seeing our own because in this sense we are also connected under one creation
[3:36:41.400 --> 3:36:48.200]  one thing one thing one creation and we're within it and within that creation we have this ability
[3:36:48.200 --> 3:36:52.680]  to choose freely and so what does that mean you know what is this how do you get your head around
[3:36:52.680 --> 3:36:57.240]  this but here's the other thing that we know from physics is that everything that we think is running
[3:36:57.240 --> 3:37:04.680]  on a time clock actually happened like that in a second in a flash and we perceive it in this
[3:37:04.680 --> 3:37:09.800]  timeline that lasts billions and billions of years but the fullness of the experience is in a
[3:37:09.800 --> 3:37:18.360]  flash if we could be in that flash we would understand it and I believe I believe that connecting
[3:37:18.360 --> 3:37:24.360]  to that is when we fall into our fullness you know when the Holy Spirit connects with us is how
[3:37:24.360 --> 3:37:32.360]  it's illustrated in Christian philosophy but think about this from from this perspective body
[3:37:32.360 --> 3:37:41.080]  mind and soul there's these three parts this this trinity of who we are in the world isn't
[3:37:41.080 --> 3:37:48.120]  that interesting the soul part you know is kind of connected to the to the godhead right and then
[3:37:48.120 --> 3:37:53.480]  they have the mind and emotion part kind of connected maybe to the Holy Spirit maybe the
[3:37:53.480 --> 3:38:00.440]  body part is connected to Christ you know and how that's manifested in its fullness so part of our
[3:38:00.440 --> 3:38:08.520]  mission on the earth is to bring back the body and the heart together and what we call the heart
[3:38:08.520 --> 3:38:13.240]  and mind and then get the spirit back and sink and what happens is the flesh as I was talking
[3:38:13.240 --> 3:38:17.640]  about before the break kind of takes over the programming and we start to identify with that
[3:38:17.640 --> 3:38:22.520]  and then it takes us places you see because it takes control of our emotion or our intellect
[3:38:22.520 --> 3:38:27.560]  and let me tell you what happens that so you get angry and then the angry just takes you you know
[3:38:27.560 --> 3:38:31.960]  and you do all kinds of crazy stuff we watching to play out all over the country right now you
[3:38:31.960 --> 3:38:37.480]  know how to stop the anger in yourself as soon as you notice the anger rising you recognize it
[3:38:37.480 --> 3:38:41.880]  you give it legitimacy because there's a root to it you want to know the root but the moment that
[3:38:41.880 --> 3:38:48.520]  you notice it you take control of it simple as that that's when awareness the higher part of you
[3:38:48.520 --> 3:38:58.200]  takes control of the flesh okay because negative emotions are generally associated with flesh but
[3:38:58.200 --> 3:39:04.520]  it's part of our oscillation between the world and the non-world that we live in when we live in
[3:39:04.520 --> 3:39:13.160]  the world so we got to recognize those oscillations and learn and learn from them the power of our
[3:39:13.160 --> 3:39:19.560]  delivery because this is also a very important point in this there's two kinds of energy and
[3:39:19.560 --> 3:39:24.920]  they are distinct and different but but you can become addicted to these energies and they can
[3:39:24.920 --> 3:39:32.520]  move you in a way that is not so good and there's a very fine difference that you can discern and
[3:39:32.520 --> 3:39:38.120]  that difference becomes more and more able to be seen as you discern it so discernment becomes
[3:39:38.120 --> 3:39:45.080]  a part of this and you need all of us need to look inside a bit and start to reflect and start to
[3:39:45.080 --> 3:39:52.120]  alter our course and kind of rethink what does it mean if we hold these beliefs and if we still hold
[3:39:52.120 --> 3:39:59.880]  doubt it's okay it's okay don't feel bad about any doubt but ask be revealed the information that
[3:39:59.880 --> 3:40:03.880]  will help you with this because here's what happens when you begin to doubt and then you begin to
[3:40:03.880 --> 3:40:09.240]  voice something that's not the truth you see if you say you believe but you still doubt then you're
[3:40:09.240 --> 3:40:15.160]  lying first to yourself and then everyone that hears you and the thing about human beings is
[3:40:15.160 --> 3:40:20.360]  well we know it consciously or not we know when someone is lying and the penalty is great don't
[3:40:20.360 --> 3:40:26.360]  do that it's better to be silent you see and then to know that you still are needing knowledge
[3:40:26.360 --> 3:40:31.000]  and then to seek that knowledge because I can assure you you will find it now I want to talk
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:37.400]  about judgment you know judging not lest you be judged to remember the verse and the part that
[3:40:37.400 --> 3:40:42.360]  kind of follows it you know don't be worrying about the sliver in someone's eye when you
[3:40:42.360 --> 3:40:47.880]  got a log stuck in your own you know what does that really mean about judgment the fact that
[3:40:47.880 --> 3:40:53.240]  making judgments about people oh they're not a Christian they're bad or they're this and they're
[3:40:53.240 --> 3:40:58.280]  bad they're this and they're that you leave that to god okay and you be the example of goodness
[3:40:58.280 --> 3:41:03.720]  without having to brand it you know because the brand has gotten a bad name for lots of reasons
[3:41:03.720 --> 3:41:07.800]  you know and I can point to all kinds of groups and organizations that have kind of given it a
[3:41:07.800 --> 3:41:12.760]  brand name but I'm not going to do that because there's no construction in that what I want to
[3:41:12.760 --> 3:41:21.080]  ask people is are you are you that reflection because God will do the judging I've said this
[3:41:21.080 --> 3:41:25.560]  before on the air you know King Solomon the wisest man that ever lived you know conjured up spirits
[3:41:25.560 --> 3:41:30.760]  dabbled in the occult did all that stuff you go read it yourself you go read the story yourself
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:35.720]  and if he were walking around today without the name King Solomon there'd be a lot of
[3:41:35.720 --> 3:41:41.080]  Christians want to burn him in the parking lot you know want to tell him what he is and tell him
[3:41:41.080 --> 3:41:46.360]  where he's going and give him the message from God that they know they got that ain't your message
[3:41:46.360 --> 3:41:51.480]  to give ladies and gentlemen and except under very rare circumstances I had one of those yesterday
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:56.840]  with the mayor of Anchorage where I had to deliver a message to him in a way that was very uncomfortable
[3:41:56.840 --> 3:42:04.200]  for me because I jarred his soul yesterday a little bit and I did it deliberately because
[3:42:04.200 --> 3:42:08.920]  I want him to really think about what I said I didn't want to hurt him and I did and I didn't
[3:42:08.920 --> 3:42:14.040]  mean to but but I did I know I did and I regret that you know in a lot of ways because that has
[3:42:14.040 --> 3:42:19.240]  never been my intention but sometimes the truth is going to hurt and if you know you're called to
[3:42:19.240 --> 3:42:24.200]  deliver it and in this instant the way it all happened I'm talking about today but I knew
[3:42:25.160 --> 3:42:29.960]  and I got the tap and I did the job and I'm accountable for everything and every breath
[3:42:29.960 --> 3:42:36.440]  I took and every word I said but I know I did it correctly and I only do that about every 10 years
[3:42:37.560 --> 3:42:44.120]  really I don't get that elevator very often and directed at an individual soul I just don't I
[3:42:44.120 --> 3:42:50.360]  can't it it it just doesn't it's not who I am I can't do it but but it doesn't mean that it can't
[3:42:50.360 --> 3:42:54.520]  it shouldn't be done occasionally you know I'm just not the guy you know so I do it differently
[3:42:54.520 --> 3:42:58.360]  that's it and this is the important thing about judgment again that I want to get to because I
[3:42:58.360 --> 3:43:04.120]  hear criticism of alex from all kinds of people I know and I'm sick of it because sometimes the
[3:43:04.120 --> 3:43:10.760]  method and the way it delivers is what awakens people we all awaken for different reasons in
[3:43:10.760 --> 3:43:15.080]  different ways and and I know everyone would kind of wonder what the science is going to be today
[3:43:15.080 --> 3:43:19.800]  because that's usually where I come from but you know this is science because all the science is
[3:43:19.800 --> 3:43:26.520]  based on who we are and where it goes and what it does depends on who we are see all the mess in
[3:43:26.520 --> 3:43:31.320]  the world all the things that we can point to are symptoms you see they're all just symptoms of
[3:43:31.320 --> 3:43:36.680]  people behaving badly and failing to remember what we are is living souls if we could just start
[3:43:36.680 --> 3:43:41.000]  doing that just a little bit if we just start remembering just a little bit we will begin to
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:48.680]  discover the power of each individual soul and when we link together and as we are right now
[3:43:48.680 --> 3:43:55.240]  in this very moment because I feel it as a hairs on my arms rise I always do I know it right now
[3:43:55.240 --> 3:44:03.080]  we are connected in a way that brings about change hold this together hold this truth together
[3:44:03.080 --> 3:44:11.080]  that we are the light we can be that light and we can trigger a flame from a flicker to a flame
[3:44:11.080 --> 3:44:16.840]  not that destroys but purifies we can be in that fiery furnace like those three guys were
[3:44:18.440 --> 3:44:23.960]  thousands of years ago and the other guy appeared in that pure appearance was it was a reminder
[3:44:23.960 --> 3:44:29.240]  that we're never alone I've been walking through the valley of shadow of death my whole life
[3:44:29.240 --> 3:44:36.360]  fearlessly because I do know God is directing the path sometimes I forget I screw it up
[3:44:37.000 --> 3:44:42.440]  but my intention is still pure if I screw it up I'm responsible I will do everything I can to fix
[3:44:42.440 --> 3:44:50.360]  it and I encourage you to the same but be the leader today in your own life first before you dare
[3:44:50.360 --> 3:44:58.360]  to affect another be that leader and then be that bold leader that knows with absolute confidence
[3:44:58.360 --> 3:45:04.440]  with no doubt not a fragment of what you're going to do next and just do that don't do what you
[3:45:04.440 --> 3:45:11.320]  can't do don't do what you can't believe in do what you believe in and make it the creation of your
[3:45:11.320 --> 3:45:19.720]  word let the word be the power in your life today your word your voice because it's the voice of
[3:45:19.720 --> 3:45:28.760]  millions that will make the difference the calm voice the strong voice
