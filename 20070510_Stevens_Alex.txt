[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]  Later I will try to walk through the caller's question.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.080]  It's just, you know, the whole spirit of the thing made me nauseous and I'm just taken back
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:22.320]  by this stuff sometimes, you know, just by the attitude. And so later I'll go over it,
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.960]  just in the middle of all of the normal things that go on around here. It just
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:35.840]  makes my head spin sometimes. We do have her on with us and we appreciate her coming on the show.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.960]  She's Valerie Stevens. She's the co-chair of OPT and that's the optimum population group,
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.200]  optimum population dot org. And I'm sorry we had so much trouble connecting with you. It's
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.720]  good to have you on with us Valerie. Thank you, that's okay. Tell us a little bit about yourself,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.320]  about the organization that you co-chair. Well, it's basically an environmental think tank,
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.160]  if you like. We're all deeply concerned about the global environment and of course the environment
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:14.240]  in our very overcrowded island of the United Kingdom. And like the rest of the world, we're
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.040]  tremendously concerned about global climate change, global warming based on the huge amounts
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:29.040]  of fossil fuels that we burn. And so I guess it's the same in some parts of the United States,
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.480]  but here in Britain and Europe we've been talking a great deal about what every citizen can do
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.040]  to try to cut down on each person's emissions of carbon dioxide, changing the light bulbs,
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.480]  taking the bus instead of your car, this kind of thing. But because we're concerned about
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.120]  population impacts, our message is have one less child. Do you find that shocking?
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.760]  Oh well don't worry, the west is already dead and that will accelerate it. In fact,
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.200]  you guys are saying the westerners are the ones that really don't need to have children
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.080]  because our carbon footprint is so big and there's talk about it being fines or fees,
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.040]  that really is the one child policy of China. But I know I would say victory is complete. I mean,
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.840]  the west already pretty much can't reverse its decline. No, nowhere in anything that we
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.280]  say on our website have we talked about fines or anything like that. It must all be voluntary based
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.560]  on people's awareness of what's happening. It's talking about taxes, it's talking about
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.040]  penalties. I mean, I just have the Times of London, I have Australian News. I mean, explain it to us
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.520]  because I'm really honored. Well ma'am, we've got a break. Quick break and I really appreciate your
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.760]  stalwart stoicism while we didn't get connected to you for 17 minutes. Stay there, we appreciate
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.640]  you gracing us with your time and we'll be right back to let you elaborate on this. Stay with us.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.640]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.480]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance. If the resonant frequency force making the
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.640]  glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.040]  shatters. Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.120]  can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies. The BioSolutions frequency
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.920]  instrument uses the same technology for relief for elimination of pain and disease conditions
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.760]  with no side effects. The 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.320]  ever developed. Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.440]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow. Customer satisfaction is
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.240]  guaranteed or your money back. Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause. For more information

[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.120]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us up the gold standard, the U.S. dollar has
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.120]  been devaluating. What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.920]  finances. Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value? The answer to all of this is
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.040]  gold and silver. They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years. If you had had
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.480]  $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.080]  cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800. But your gold and silver would have the
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.880]  buying power of $3 million. The answer to protecting your assets is simple. Call me,
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.880]  John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169. Get all your questions answered before your

[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.760]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triomethylenes,
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.480]  atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTVE to below detectable limits. Black
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.360]  murky elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.560]  non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.760]  clear drinking water. Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead,
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.720]  mercury, and aluminum are no problem. Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.800]  removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs. Black
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.440]  murky elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.080]  it takes much less time to filter your water. Supercharge your gravity filter today. Upgrade
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.760]  to black murky purification elements. Get a two-pack, only $99, or a four-pack, only $188.

[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.760]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show,
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:16.240]  because there's a war on for your mind. We have the co-chair of the optimum population trust
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:24.960]  and she joins us Valerie Stevens. Valerie, you say no on your website should you say
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.520]  that it's an eco-crime, but the headline in the Sunday Times of London is having large families
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:36.640]  is an eco-crime. How do you think that they came up with that headline? I've no idea and it's
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:43.600]  rather embarrassed us because we wouldn't say words like a crime at all. We're saying we want
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.560]  people to think about this issue. We do wonder about the advisability of, you know, some governments
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.120]  in Europe and also in Australia are so concerned about low birth rates that they actually offer
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.520]  big bonuses and handouts if you have a third child. But see, that won't work. You guys are actually
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.560]  helping us and I appreciate you. Put your billboards up. Start taxing having kids.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.400]  People like to rebel and so as soon as you make it stylish to have more children,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.320]  you're actually going to save the beloved West. So I just want to thank you.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:24.320]  We're going to win. We can't be stopped. You just need to know that. Well, when you say
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:32.480]  the West, are you including Europe with the USA? Yes. Yeah, I mean we have quite different.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.920]  And Japan too. I don't want the Japanese to become extinct. We don't want anybody to become
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:46.720]  extinct. I'll tell you what, our bottom line is that we think that the number of births each year
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:52.320]  should be roughly equal to the number of deaths so that we're not having 80 million more people
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:09:00.400]  on the planet every year. All of them using energy. All of them emitting or being responsible
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.760]  for the emissions of carbon dioxide. But you cannot deny that China has now surpassed the
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:13.040]  United States in carbon footprint emissions and they're not putting in any of these controls.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.560]  Well, I was going to stop you. Except for the beloved one child policy which is the law and
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.720]  there are fines associated. Do you think that's a sensible thing they're doing in China? I do.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.760]  Actually, I think the world would be in a really terrible mess now if the Chinese had not instituted
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.640]  that one child policy. Okay, so there you go. There you go right there is that you say you
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.560]  don't want it to be the law and don't want fines but you really do in the end of the day.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.560]  Not in the western democracies. No, that has to be the choice of the people. We have free votes
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.720]  and we can choose that. But you support China doing it at the barrel of a gun.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:55.360]  I think I think China has the number of people in China who would have starved by now died of
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:03.280]  starvation is even with their one child policy for the past 15 years they are totally running out of
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.120]  water parts of their country is becoming an absolute no it's not true i've seen all the
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:14.160]  numbers they know you know if they'd not had the one child policy before now millions and millions
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.440]  of them would have starved well you know mal admits he killed 60 mil in the in the cultural
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.760]  revolution and the great leap forward that's an official government pop they're very proud of it
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.960]  in official government publications the mass culling they're the apple of the un's eye they
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.240]  get all the big awards and it's it's the government planning uh that has caused the
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.600]  problems they can easily increase uh their yield and feed their population i think i think you
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.400]  have not looked at the way their water table they're receiving because they've been over
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.600]  pumped and i know that parts of the usa they have the they have the they have the ocean they have
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:56.400]  they could build desalinization humans can do whatever's needed and desalination plant uses
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:03.040]  fossil fuel energy oh which again al gore has been proven to be a fraud all scientists do not
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.520]  agree as that un report fraudulently said and hundreds of those scientists are on record saying
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.560]  their names were added without their consent we have the ice core samples that it's an 800 year
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:19.280]  gap of carbon dioxide increases after warming begins carbon dioxide is not a pollutant it is
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:25.120]  a life accelerant plants grow even faster and more healthy in our ancient past we had a higher carbon
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.200]  dioxide level in photosynthesis boosting total oxygen levels for all of the different types of
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:38.640]  animal life that is a scientific hoax and a fraud no i think you will see that the bulk of scientists
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.400]  around the world are agreed that global climate change is happening and it is probably due
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:50.960]  to probably you guys were saying all scientists just six months ago until they all started going
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:58.720]  public about the lies now you got to say bulk of scientists it's a very small number of scientists
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.920]  who are saying that al gore's wrong or the the all these other uh scientists around the world
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:12.480]  are wrong it is a very small number who are countering oh really oh yeah what's your study
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:21.840]  or a major index on that um let me see your proof in science in new scientists these
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.560]  magazines that reflect the scientific community that are owned by the oil companies that want
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.000]  to have a global carbon tax we have the bilderberg group and spp documents this is a giant hoax peak
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]  oils a hoax and we have the documents and we're going to get it out to the people tell you what
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.840]  i'm going to shut up and i'm going to be polite i've got a little angry i'm not being gentlemanly
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.800]  i apologize to you one more little segment with us please i'd like to hear then what we should do
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.720]  if you're right we'll be right back

[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:36.000]  graced and honored to have valerie stevens of the optimum population trust joining us optimum
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.880]  population dot org okay without me then sitting here running over you you say you support what
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:48.560]  china's doing but that we're democracies so we can't do that here but you don't support a tax
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.600]  or it being the law to reduce children or the number of births and i'm gonna have more children
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.960]  just because of this by the way uh because we will survive we will continue and we are not a
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.840]  cancer on the earth as prince philip has called us but i mean explain to us then uh that that
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:09.120]  paradox between what china's doing is good but that but we're not going to do that here but
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:15.840]  you're just introducing us to it and how evil our carbon footprint is i think perhaps we can
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.160]  prompt to it from a slightly different point of view remember that in the united kingdom
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:26.080]  we're one of we're even more densely populated than china we are struggling with a population
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:34.640]  of 60 million on this tiny island um and our numbers are still growing by about a quarter
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:42.880]  of a million every year illegal aliens your actual birth rate is uh 1.5 you're dying 1.78
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:49.200]  actually uh well i guess the bbc is lying i i think they're integrating second generation
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:57.600]  foreigners uh if you actually look at at real uh populations there uh the germanic mongol uh
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:04.720]  tribes uh and by mongol tribes you know an amalgamation of the germanic and norse
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.480]  populations romanic invasions uh that it's uh actually at about 1.3 but go ahead
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:19.360]  um right um we are still concerned about the way in which our cities are encroaching on
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:29.360]  green belts in this country um and we see that happening all over europe the spread of dense
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.400]  populations in industrialized countries um we're
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:41.680]  we're desperately worried about the kind of future that our children and grandchildren
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:48.480]  are going to face i can't imagine mr jones that you think it's a welcome thing in the world today
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:56.160]  that is running out of resources to have 80 million more people on the planet every year i
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:03.040]  really cannot understand how anybody can say well the problem is the problem is is that i have
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:11.200]  literally decades of research on this subject and i know that once third world nations industrialize
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:19.840]  uh that their population growth will go down to zero immediately oh no it can't go immediately
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.840]  because the people even if all the couples in third world countries only had one child per
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:31.280]  couple by immediately i mean as soon as they industrialize as soon as even if they did it
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.960]  tomorrow the number of the un zone studies let me just finish the un zone studies say
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.080]  that population will grow to nine and a half billion and then start declining that is so that's
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:48.240]  that's two and a half billion more than we have now that cannot be good for a planet that already
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:54.800]  overshoots its renewable resource space here's the problem ma'am ma'am ma'am here's the problem i have
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.440]  the oil company documents they're behind the whole fake environmental movement the environmental
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.000]  movement is nothing more than neo-feudalism and serfdom uh actually there's few countries in the
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.960]  world that have more green space and more held lands and palaces for your royalty and that and
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.160]  that basically you're still in a feudal model with very few landowners with massive pressure
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:22.560]  to steal the land of the farmers uh that are still there and all the harassment they go under
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:29.440]  uh and uh that and that we haven't this is nothing but malthusian social darwinism are you
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:34.880]  familiar with prince philip who's a big supporter i know your foundation and other groups saying he
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:42.320]  wants to come back as a virus to kill 80 percent of us i could i'm absolutely flabbergasted mr
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:50.160]  jones he can even be bothered to talk to him to me since my background is obviously so obnoxious
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:55.760]  to you perhaps i should just put the phone down and say maybe we'll talk another time well what
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:03.120]  do you know about prince philip goodbye mr jones oh man that really got to her right there
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:10.000]  goodbye mr jones we'll be dealing with you soon enough
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:25.120]  oh my god oh my god and of course he showed us his true colors the um
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.400]  he showed us his true colors what was it six years ago now whenever the head of the 700 club pat
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:42.400]  robertson said on cnn china is doing what it has to do uh with abortion and even forced abortion
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:48.800]  in china he goes what are they going to do they they they have to yes and he gave a clarification
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.920]  he said they've got to have it more even more strict planned parenting
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:01.760]  once you give in to that view once you let the government be the arbiter of human life and and
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.040]  decide who can live and who can't we already have eugenics of our old we already have all
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.960]  this rapid family planning with the goal of destroying the family we actually have uh and
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.040]  that's un extreme numbers show nine and a half billion the numbers are really showing it'll
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.560]  probably plane off about eight billion we go up in an airplane uh over many areas of the world it
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:31.680]  it's completely unpopulated uh england is is is is barely populated uh you bring up prince philip
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:37.040]  to these people who's a big supporter of the views espoused by the group you just heard
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:43.120]  and bringing up the prince is a no-no and he did write the forward to if i was an animal
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:50.640]  published 1988 reuters also carried they asked him about it he repeated it uh autobahn society
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.800]  questioned him he repeated it and said more these are on record i actually own the book
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:04.080]  and the publications and he says that he wants to see 80 of us die and man i brought that up
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:14.640]  and it was like producing a a silver crucifix to beelzebub himself i mean it was as you talk
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:25.760]  about specters vanishing and uh you see we know their game and it was all about everyone agrees
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:32.720]  the earth is overpopulated needs to be reduced everyone agrees the carbon emission is destroying
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:40.320]  everything and i go no actually it's the very ether in which we swim carbon dioxide and oxygen
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:49.200]  are minority gases in the uh in the atmosphere and all the major studies show that life animal
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:56.240]  and plant lives longer accelerates has better cell structures in a more oxygen and carbon
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:04.000]  dioxide rich environment it is literally delicious it is the life forms on this planet
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.320]  that are generating the atmosphere that perpetuates the life forms
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:16.800]  our atmosphere is actually also some of it is lost into space while it's being bombarded by the
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:24.560]  ions and different uh particles coming in out of the galaxy and from the sun itself and that
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:29.680]  we're actually being stripped and losing oxygen despite the gravitational pull that holds in much
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:35.840]  of the gases if we want to be like mars and lose our atmosphere and die then for heaven's sakes we
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.520]  want to try to manipulate and and and stop the normal processes the un zone report which is
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:49.280]  inflated and proven to be a fraud but again using their numbers six percent of greenhouse gas
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:59.120]  emissions are caused by human activity six percent and that's including around half of
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:06.080]  that they claim methane gas emissions from the animal feeds uh and in the uh in the stomach it's
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.960]  it's flatulence that's why they want to start reducing and banning and taxing and the cows
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.600]  there's always been bovine ranging and even greater numbers than there are now in north america
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:22.480]  they called them the buffalo there were what there were many species of deer extincted there
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:28.880]  were many more uh type of uh the clove and hoof animals running about as well and they were they
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.840]  were knocked out there were there was overhunting there is overfishing and overhunting and i don't
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:39.040]  like a lot of old-growth forests being cut down i believe in preserving our earth but let me tell
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:44.240]  you every time they take some farmer's ranch with this stuff it's to build a hotel or golf course
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:50.880]  five years later every time they take a community's marina they build a five-star marina there
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:26:02.400]  and in condos it is about stealing property it is neo-feudalism and uh goodbye mr jones i will now
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:09.600]  exercise the power and the authority to terminate this interview because you have brought up his royal
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:16.320]  highness how dare you bring him up how dare you
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:27.680]  how dare you bring up his royal highness he is such a wonderful individual you are such a greater
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:38.240]  vision and you do you pathetic backwards country bumpkin yankee we've got real intellect we've got
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:43.760]  real understanding over here we know how to order society
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.160]  she couldn't stand it when i told her we're gonna win we are we're gonna ace them
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.480]  you're not gonna stop the human spirit and you're not gonna stop its dynamic agility
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.880]  we're gonna unlock it and we're gonna run over the top of you and all of your elk
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:15.840]  and we're gonna spread into the heavens our offspring are gonna inherit and they're gonna
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:22.960]  inherit god's incredible promises and the wonders we've been promised and we're not gonna be blocked
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:28.400]  by the likes of you that have tried to call our population and we're trying to reduce our numbers
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:37.520]  and who have tried to control us forever they're the feudal managers and all their simpering sales
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:45.200]  jobs have failed and they're going to fail miserably you will never stop the true renaissance
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:53.760]  you will never stop our ever moving forward as a species i say they won't they may release some
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.680]  super weapon i don't mean their pathetic group they're useful idiots i'm sure mean well but i
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.240]  mean the military industrial complex pinac the new world order crowd the prince philip type crowd
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.640]  so i say they won't stop us and i know in my gut they're not going to
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.240]  but i just i just it absolutely blows me away
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:21.920]  you know dr pianca let's kill everybody let's use the chinese model uh or kill 90 percent and
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:29.360]  then oh yes china i agree with them but here we need to have a more that's not the phase where
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.040]  those royal highness supports getting rid of the mass of the population
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:47.200]  i think we're going to end this right now i think we're going to stop this right here and right now
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.320]  mr jones
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:29:00.240]  again i am not for setting up these death mills in the end like margaret singer who gave awards
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:05.360]  to hitler got awards from him that's where they learned it all the rockefeller foundation funded
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:10.000]  the major nazi eugenics that's mainstream history new york times cover we have all the articles back
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.320]  in the 30s and 40s you're not going to stop us and i am you know these death mills in the
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.640]  hispanic and black areas i don't want them to all their children to die i don't want them killing
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:26.880]  their babies uh you know once they get a good socioeconomic level they will go into actual
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:33.280]  negative population because people are selfish and want to watch tv and want to go party and and and
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:38.800]  and and look at the pathetic white population they've bought into all the lies and all the evil
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:44.960]  of the new world order and look at our communities falling apart in mass and they say oh yes we must
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:50.960]  accelerate it in europe i mean it's just disgusting
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.800]  so i'm not a hypocrite about this i don't want the blacks and the mexicans to not have their
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.600]  children ladies and gentlemen but i got to tell you i mean just to just to watch the death of
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:07.440]  europe it's it's it's happening look at the numbers and i hear the you know the illegals celebrate it
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:12.320]  and hey you're dying go back to europe ha ha ha hey man i don't want you to die we're all human
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.160]  beings here and so you've bought into that whole attitude and i i just um
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.440]  it's just absolutely disgusting and i've had enough of it
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.160]  and we're going to expose these people my new film is going to expose these people
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:33.360]  and uh you know the caller earlier i was actually sitting here mad that we hadn't got our guest on
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.520]  yet that there was a problem and so when the caller called in and said alex and the caller
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.440]  might have meant well but alex you know just too good to be true and you say they can play
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.880]  us like a fiddle and uh and you know ron paul he's just too good to be true and i just don't
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:54.080]  know what to okay let's say ron paul's bad he's some type of sleeper which he isn't look at the
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:31:01.120]  fruit this tree has bore that's the test that's how you know an evil tree cannot bear good fruit
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:10.000]  they never do it's the fruit the fruit he's defeated legislation he's put in good legislation
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.080]  he's never stopped he's never deviated he's always been true and trustworthy he's given no
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:22.560]  indicators it's like how do you trust me the fruit look at the fruit how much we've defeated together
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:31.680]  how much good we've done the victories we've had it's the fruit the fruit i'm gonna say it again
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:38.240]  the fruit the fruit the fruit the fruit how do you judge a tree how do you judge a vine
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:45.120]  how do you judge a a a grapevine is it healthy is it bearing good fruit
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:54.480]  it can have big leaves and big you know long tendrils under the ground on its vines but some
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.880]  but they'll tell you some of the best grapes come off the old vines they've got the little
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.160]  little leaves and don't even look that healthy but it's got the fruit i don't know how i'm
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:11.920]  supposed to explain this to you and and and and and how you know and and i hear people
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.720]  say best about ron paul and they never give any facts i mean you come in with an accusation it
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.360]  was an accusation you know they play us like a fiddle i just don't know about ron paul
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:28.560]  give your evidence give your examples you do not have them believe me i know this man i've
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:35.520]  looked at him i've studied him i've watched him and i trust ron paul and then there's also
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:42.320]  in any fight you've got to be wise as a serpent and harmful you know harmless as a dove but at
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.880]  the same time you've got to have a little trust you know what i could sit here and be parent
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.480]  people always ask me well you must be paranoid what you do no i'm not paranoid i don't worry
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.920]  about my life i don't worry about things i just put it in god's hands and i try to have some
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.320]  discernment and if people bear bad fruit and do weird things i give them a lot of rub and then i
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:09.520]  get i get i get them out of my life i get away from them uh but um it's all the fruit and look
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:14.800]  at how the media is attacking now the media was going ron paul's great ron paul's gonna win ron
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:20.720]  paul's the man to fight the new world order if they suddenly did that i'd go whoa i still wouldn't
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:26.240]  distrust ron paul because of his fruit what he's done his works his life who he is and then my
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:31.040]  discernment on top of that but i would go they're gonna set him up or they're gonna try to discredit
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.360]  the movement through him or something's coming up no no the fact that they're censoring him and
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:44.240]  attacking him and doing all this that's only more of a confirmation you see and so i guess i'm just
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:48.160]  you're probably a good person i'm sorry i was mean to you it's just that lack of discernment
