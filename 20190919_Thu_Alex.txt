[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  There is a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:10.000 --> 00:26.000]  Alex Jones, the foray conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[00:26.000 --> 00:35.000]  Alex Jones, Russian scum.
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  If a war comes to mind.
[00:41.000 --> 00:51.000]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:51.000 --> 00:59.000]  I will not let you down.
[00:59.000 --> 01:07.000]  I will not let you down.
[01:07.000 --> 01:15.000]  I will not let you down.
[01:15.000 --> 01:44.000]  I will not let you down.
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  I'm back in Austin, Texas, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48.000 --> 01:55.000]  And Eddie Bravo, my old friend, exploded through the door one minute before I went live.
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  And so a little late get in the chair here and he's in the control room right there.
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  And I am excited about this four-hour global transmission today.
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  He's going to be weather-starting in the next hour.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  And then Paul Joseph Watson is ready in the fourth hour.
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  How in the world can I even tell you what is coming up today?
[02:18.000 --> 02:24.000]  Bombshell Global Engineering experiment pushed by Bill Gates, also funded by Nazi-linked foundation,
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.000]  linking eugenics and depopulation. Boom.
[02:30.000 --> 02:37.000]  Doomsday's that didn't happen, think tank compiles decades worth of dire climate predictions
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  as the globalist try to collapse our atmosphere.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  Kanye West preaches radical obedience to Jesus during Sunday service in Atlanta.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  I wonder why he's fighting the evil so much because he's got Jesus.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  Coming up, we're going to have Millie Weaver on anti-Trump protesters, verbally abused reporters,
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  threatened to sexually assault female reporters because they're Trump supporters.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  That video has gone viral, something like 10 million views right now,
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  and 3 million on Facebook. It's just insane.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  We're going to be breaking all that down when she pops in with us.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  And then the really big news when we come back from break,
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  Instagram, that's Facebook, is now banning photos of people at gun ranges claiming they promote violence.
[03:19.000 --> 03:26.000]  Now that San Francisco's listed the NRA as terrorists, they're now saying all gun owners are terrorists,
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  literally, and so that you're part of a criminal organization.
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  So just four months ago, I was the guy first banned by name saying positive things about me,
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  and now it's, oh, gun owners, we're going to now blur out any photos of guns
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  and threaten to delete your account if you show any guns,
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  unless it's guns in the hands of the Communist Chinese ruling over their slaves,
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  or unless it's the government with guns.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  Oh, then everything is fine, everything is good.
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  You see Big Tech making its move right now, meanwhile, cult manufacturers
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000]  to halt production of civilian rifles. The Fortune 100's all saying ban the guns.
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  All these big gun manufacturers are saying we're not going to make the AR-15 or any other semi-auto anymore.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  Walmart's not going to sell handguns or semi-auto rifles. They're coming for your guns.
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  This is the big push. People think it's not going to happen.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  Oh, they're gearing up the stage, some really big attacks.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  You can feel it, you can see the buildup, you can see the propaganda preparations.
[04:20.000 --> 04:26.000]  Democrat red flag laws disarm rural gun owners, not gang members, all the studies show.
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  They're handing the guns in in New Zealand. We're going to show you that video.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  Amazon's answering gun violence. We're going to say about that.
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  But we come back. The Communist Chinese, the government, GZ Ping,
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.000]  has issued a statement, a direct challenge to the American people.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  That's coming up, start of the next segment.
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  infowars.com forward slash show, banned dot video.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  Despite all their attacks, we're still on air and still fighting thanks to your support,
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  but only because of your support. So spread the word.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.000]  That new formula is Ultra 12. It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things,
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy,
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  helps produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system functioning goes on and on.
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.000]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  weight loss, depression, or memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12. It helps something in full war.
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.000]  So it's a 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[05:46.000 --> 05:51.000]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[05:51.000 --> 06:18.000]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at infowarslive.com.
[06:18.000 --> 06:32.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  Well, we've got a huge broadcast lined up for you here today as we do every day.
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  Today, particularly Champact. Eddie Bravo and crew are here.
[06:40.000 --> 06:46.000]  A friend of mine, you know, World Champion Jitsu guy, a really interesting individual.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  He's having a studio with us for at least two hours. Paul Watson's coming up as well.
[06:50.000 --> 07:00.000]  Before I get into the huge geopolitical developments in Justin Trudeau and such hot water as the actual blackface video emerges,
[07:00.000 --> 07:12.000]  before I break all of that down, I first just want to point out that they are shipping hundreds of thousands of pounds of fentanyl into this country.
[07:12.000 --> 07:17.000]  They've been caught just shipping in 25,000 tons just a few weeks ago,
[07:17.000 --> 07:23.000]  enough to kill 10 billion plus people with dosages that would be overdoses.
[07:23.000 --> 07:32.000]  And China admits this is chemical warfare against America on a scale never before seen,
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  and it's killing millions of people.
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  And the Democrats are mad at Trump for putting tariffs on them
[07:37.000 --> 07:43.000]  and standing up against their one-sided trade policies that have deindustrialized this nation.
[07:43.000 --> 07:46.000]  And so that's one of the most positive things Trump is doing,
[07:46.000 --> 07:52.000]  but Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist dictator, continues to execute his own citizens
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  if they're caught with any type of opium.
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  And opium's way, way weaker, obviously, than weaponized, synthetic heroin, fentanyl.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  It's 100 times stronger than opium.
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  And so when they talk about a few hundred people getting killed in mass shootings,
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.000]  every hundred a year, in real mass shootings, where people go shoot indiscriminate innocents
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.000]  at churches or schools, and they're still terrible,
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  there's only 12,000 people roughly a year that are killed by criminals with guns.
[08:18.000 --> 08:22.000]  It's 30,000 total on average if you count all the suicides, everything together.
[08:22.000 --> 08:28.000]  Still not a good thing, but it's a hoax that it's the biggest issue and that it's gun owners' faults.
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  And they're all moving right now against the Second Amendment in a big, big way.
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.000]  Then you only have a government that has the firearms and your journey to slavery is complete.
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  But this big push for the guns is the strongest ever, and they believe they're going to get them.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  I'll cover that next segment with huge developments on that front.
[08:45.000 --> 08:53.000]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, this video is exclusively on Infowars.com and NewsWars.com
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  and Summit.News video.
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.000]  Communist Party of China issues direct message to the American people. Paul Watson retweeted it.
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  Rob, do retweet it. We need to get this out.
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  Throwing down the gauntlet, the Central Committee tells Americans to submit to their fate.
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  So they're being very honest about this.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  And so here is the dictator of Communist China.
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  Uncloaked and in your face. This needs to go viral. Here it is.
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  Attention, American pigs.
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  China is in control of your country now.
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  We own Hollywood. We own your debt.
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  And we owe Harvard and the Democratic Party.
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  We have all your military courts.
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  And we make 90% of your drugs, if we call that.
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  And your vaccines.
[09:43.000 --> 09:53.000]  So enjoy your cancer.
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  But try calm, take over.
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  Infowars.
[09:59.000 --> 10:09.000]  So take your fentanyl and your tainted vaccines and your melamine and your baby formula we make for you.
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.000]  And die. And don't fight black or the media will call your names.
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  And you don't want that.
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  Shut up and do what we tell you.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  Shut up and die.
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  And get rid of Trump and Alex Jones.
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  You are not going to beat us.
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  That's it. Band.video.
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  So even if they try to take it down off Twitter or YouTube where it's going viral right now,
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  find it and reshare it, really that's what Band.video is about, is the final of the videos,
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.000]  is a launch pad to them, get them out to everybody in your area.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  Okay, I'm going to do this right now.
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  That was obviously satire.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  We were not being serious that that is.
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  G's message to us, but in action that is what China is doing.
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.000]  They execute you if you're caught using opium because they don't want it inside the country.
[10:58.000 --> 11:04.000]  They know that China was enslaved by European nations for over 100 years by shipping opium in and buying off their politicians in a drug war.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  We never did that to China, but they're doing it to the United States and to the West and our own governments.
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  The Democratic Party have sided with the Chai comms because they're anti-Western, anti-American and we're helping carry it out.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  Just one more of their ultra massive, very serious crimes.
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  So let me tell you what is coming up and I'm going to get into.
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.000]  Coming to America, China introduces credit score for obedient citizens.
[11:29.000 --> 11:36.000]  That's December 2015, almost five years ago in FullWars.com.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  And I helped write that article.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  The watch at my point is we have been on this from the beginning.
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  Now here's today.
[11:43.000 --> 11:49.000]  Facebook forming Supreme Court to moderate content, set censorship precedents.
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  They call it independent, but Facebook will appoint this social credit score system.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  That's a huge article out of RT with the press release by Facebook.
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.000]  That then ties into all the rest of the gun grabbing that is going on.
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  We're going to cover coming up at the start of the next segment.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  Cult gun manufacturers to halt production of civilian rifles.
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.000]  160-plus top companies come out and call for repeal of the Second Amendment banning of all semi-autos.
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  Democrat red flag laws to disarm rural gun owners, not gang members.
[12:22.000 --> 12:30.000]  That is all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the next segment.
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  Also, we have the private run-for-profit fellow reserve and former Fed heads,
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  80% owned by the Chai comms of the EU, that's on record.
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  Chai comms own the most of our debt now, saying they're going to crash the U.S. economy,
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  trying to kill the U.S. economy, trying to talk up the Chinese economy
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  because of the trade war, showing you which side they're on.
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  That's all coming up.
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  Also, Merriam-Webster adds gender identity definitions.
[12:55.000 --> 13:04.000]  They, too, dictionary as the war on families and the war on humanity accelerates.
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  Also, we're going to jump into another New York Times editor
[13:10.000 --> 13:17.000]  has delete offensive tweets following backlash because they use other people's quote offensive tweets,
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  very mild stuff, to get them fired, to get them blackballed.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  But then when Democrats do stuff far worse, they're saying,
[13:24.000 --> 13:31.000]  oh, it's okay when the governor of Virginia is in blackface or a KKK outfit in his college yearbook 30 years ago.
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.000]  But if a conservative does it, they've got to step down or even something milder.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  Well, that's why Justin Trudeau's in so much trouble.
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  He came out when there was blackface controversy in the U.S., made a huge deal out of it.
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.000]  And so now he's been caught not once, not twice, but three times, including in video, in blackface.
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  But they're saying, it's okay, it's brownface.
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.000]  So, again, if you want to play an actor like they do in Tropic Thunder,
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  of a black guy, do it.
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.000]  If a black guy wants to put whiteface on, I don't care if somebody's offended.
[14:04.000 --> 14:09.000]  You ought to be offended by blacks being 30% of the population,
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  but they're being 36% of abortions. I mean, I don't want to kill any babies.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  So, again, this political correctness that the left wants to use on everybody is now biting them in the ass.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  So I think Trudeau should step down for this.
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  The video of that's all on infowars.com. It just came out in the last two hours.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  He's first tried to deny it. Now it's blown up in his face.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  He has apologized.
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.000]  Has he apologized to Xi Jinping, who killed a million of his own people?
[14:34.000 --> 14:41.000]  Just don't talk like Kami. That was illegal to talk like this, but kill people. Okay.
[14:41.000 --> 14:48.000]  So we're going to be being irreverent to the system here to exercise your freedoms or lose them.
[14:48.000 --> 14:56.000]  Meanwhile, top Democrat donor Ed Buck charged with felonies for running a drug den
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  after third black man overdoses in the home.
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  And this gets into the occult and the rituals and how these guys are above the law.
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.000]  That's all coming up. And I haven't even scratched the surface of what we're going to break down today.
[15:07.000 --> 15:16.000]  Tomorrow is when people start supposedly trying to storm Area 51 by the, quote, millions.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  We'll see if that really happens. Thousands have already shown up.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  We'll talk about it all with Eddie Bravo in the second and third hour.
[15:22.000 --> 15:28.000]  And we'll take your calls. It's Jim Pact and Millie Weaver, who's got some of the most viral videos on the web right now,
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  with leftists saying that they basically want to rape her because she's with M4 Wars and with Trump.
[15:33.000 --> 15:40.000]  That's all coming up today. Newswars.com, infowars.com, band.video.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  I'll tell you, Martin Zuckerberg and the globalists really hope you don't share that link in those videos, those articles,
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  the sites expanding every day, new sections, all the best memes.
[15:49.000 --> 15:58.000]  But you just saw the great StrideCon message. It's all at band.video. Band.video. Please share the link.

[20:19.000 --> 20:27.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[20:27.000 --> 20:53.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:53.000 --> 20:58.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[20:58.000 --> 21:08.000]  If you look at the crime statistics, there's one on screen, 53 Americans died in mass shootings.
[21:08.000 --> 21:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, last month, while 40,000 died from obesity and over 100,000, it's estimated, died. They got reported from opioid. I was on an airplane yesterday and I talked to two people who had had their girlfriend and then their sister die from opium.
[21:36.000 --> 21:45.000]  One of them had a vape pen that the Chinese mafia in California had laced with fentanyl.
[21:45.000 --> 22:06.000]  I talked to one guy on the plane. Then I talked to a lady that got off the plane and said she heard us talking and walked over and told me about it. One fellow is with the Black Rifle Coffee Company. He's going to be in here visiting us Friday. I said, well, just come on in the studio and talk about it.
[22:06.000 --> 22:30.000]  My fiance died. So think about that. Millions and millions are dying a year, but oh, oh, mass shootings, the numbers vary, 300, 400, maybe, but real school shootings, real shootings at churches, it's not even 300.
[22:30.000 --> 22:40.000]  It's still terrible, but they're making it the end of the world. They're making it the biggest thing that the planet has ever seen, and it's all of our faults and something's got to be done right now.
[22:40.000 --> 22:53.000]  Well, there's always been murderers. There's always been killers, and they know that. And they've put the general public on psychotropic drugs that on the drug insert sits.
[22:53.000 --> 23:03.000]  It causes people to go out and do this. And yeah, there's 4,000 plus Americans get shot and killed a year by illegal aliens. A large portion of that is illegal aliens.
[23:03.000 --> 23:15.000]  But oh, that's not a problem. Hell, the illegal aliens shot the poor woman in San Francisco in the back. The jury found him not guilty, but he'd been found guilty of a gun crime.
[23:15.000 --> 23:23.000]  So he was sent to prison for that. And the appellate court said no, let him go, even though he'd been deported five times and committed a bunch of other crimes.
[23:23.000 --> 23:30.000]  They can't even put a guy in jail for shooting a woman in cold blood in the back when he's illegal alien. That's a virtue signal.
[23:30.000 --> 23:45.000]  But what I'm getting at here is that they're coming for the guns. 163 top Fortune 200 companies have sent letters to the president and Congress saying we want guns, all semi-autos banned.
[23:45.000 --> 23:51.000]  And then of course they're going to come for all the others. After that, they want those all registered. This is an exact formula they followed.
[23:51.000 --> 24:02.000]  Everybody's thinking, oh, they're not going to get it. Oh, they don't have the votes. The media's hyping up mass shootings. And the Sandy Hook group connected to it's putting out videos of mass shootings.
[24:02.000 --> 24:12.000]  The name of stopping them. But all the studies show hyping up mass shootings puts ideas and mentally ill people's heads like the Antifa monsters in Ohio and Texas.
[24:12.000 --> 24:22.000]  And when they go out and kill people, they say, oh, it's a white male. It's white terrorism. It's the biggest threat. They know what they're doing.
[24:22.000 --> 24:34.000]  And it's a formula where they hype it up, they put it out. And then a lot of the well-meaning parents and people get on board with all this because they're looking at it from a good perspective because they're not gun owners.
[24:34.000 --> 24:42.000]  And they think, well, if we just take all the guns, this will stop. Well, they took all the guns in Mexico 50-something years ago and no citizen can own guns.
[24:42.000 --> 24:56.000]  And again, they have a crime rate nine to 10 times higher than the United States. They have the highest criminal rate in the world, year to year taking first place, only losing it to Guatemala south of Mexico.
[24:56.000 --> 25:07.000]  And you can look all of this up, ladies and gentlemen. A school shooting is one of the rarest ways to get hurt or die, but the system doesn't care.
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.000]  And it's coming for the guns. What are we going to do about it?
[25:11.000 --> 25:22.000]  Well, we have to come out and point out that the inserts of the drugs that they're pushing on kids and adults and others say it causes psychotic breaks, puts you in an illusional, disconnected state.
[25:22.000 --> 25:31.000]  And we have to then expose the numbers and show that Democrat-controlled cities where they've taken all the guns, like Chicago, D.C., Baltimore, have the highest crime rates in the U.S.
[25:31.000 --> 25:44.000]  In fact, the only place beating out Mexico or Guatemala for crime in the world is South Side Chicago. And per square foot, it's more dangerous than anywhere in Mexico.
[25:44.000 --> 25:56.000]  Because the criminals have taken over. Nancy Pelosi called MS-13 God's children and said they were good people. Because the Democratic Party's laundering that money and working with them.
[25:56.000 --> 26:10.000]  And meanwhile, cult is virtue signaling and stopping production of civilian rifles, period. Not just the iconic AR-15, M16, M4 variants.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  Shifting focus to handguns. Oh, those are semi-auto. Let's take those too.
[26:16.000 --> 26:25.000]  That's the virtue signal. Walmart not selling handguns or rifles that are semi-auto, not selling the ammo. They're coming. They mean it.
[26:25.000 --> 26:33.000]  And the red flag laws are outside of law. You say, well, Trump's not going to do them because they don't work. Exactly.
[26:33.000 --> 26:45.000]  See, that's the problem. Because the states are passing laws and going out and doing it and are starting a civil war. And that's what they want to do.
[26:45.000 --> 26:57.000]  That's how our civil war against King George III started 250-plus years ago. And it continues on from there as they annihilate the process.
[26:57.000 --> 27:05.000]  So where are they going to go next? Later in the broadcast, Caitlin Bennett's going to be joining us. Millie Weaver's coming up next.
[27:05.000 --> 27:13.000]  You know, the Penn State pro-gun girl. She just posed with an AR-15 off the school grounds in front of the sign.
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.000]  Oh my gosh, she's such a criminal. A woman exercising her right to defend herself.
[27:18.000 --> 27:28.000]  Well, now the story's up on infowars.com. Coming to America, China introduces credit score for obedient citizens. Remember that five years ago?
[27:28.000 --> 27:38.000]  Well, now it's being reported. Facebook forming Supreme Court to moderate content and set censorship precedents. Huge article. Their own appointed court.
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.000]  And what is that going to do?
[27:43.000 --> 27:59.000]  Well, that ties into the article that's so important that we're going to cover when we come back from break. And that is the report of what's happening in the United States with Caitlin Bennett.
[27:59.000 --> 28:14.000]  Facebook is now saying any positive mention of the Second Amendment, any positive mention of the Second Amendment, it's on infowars.com. We'll pull it up.
[28:14.000 --> 28:23.000]  Will be removed. And any image of people firing guns or using guns will be blocked because if it's part of a corrupt or criminal organization.
[28:23.000 --> 28:32.000]  Now, you might ask yourself, here's Dr. McKimshall, please. You might ask yourself why that's happening.
[28:32.000 --> 28:42.000]  Well, that's because the Democrats in their databases starting with San Francisco have listed the NRA as a terrorist organization just like they did Proud Boys when it wasn't true.
[28:42.000 --> 28:50.000]  And now they're taking the NRA's bank accounts. They're now targeting NRA members. It's here. And of course we won't stand up for ourselves.
[28:50.000 --> 28:58.000]  We won't stew back. Trump won't do anything either. He'll sit there and let the Internet censorship roll over us. He'll sit there and let the NRA be attacked.
[28:58.000 --> 29:06.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once.
[29:06.000 --> 29:18.000]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life. I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[29:18.000 --> 29:26.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[29:26.000 --> 29:33.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.

[30:43.000 --> 30:51.000]  Believe you, the Deke State, Hillary, Obama, the NWO, they hope you don't support Imple Wars in this urgent moment when they're trying to shut us down.
[30:51.000 --> 31:17.000]  So we've got a whole bunch of other specials running as well. Check them out. They're all about to end. ImpleWarsStore.com.
[31:22.000 --> 31:31.000]  And first, they can do just a few basic things to do. Don't support Trump. Don't promote Alex Jones.
[31:31.000 --> 31:36.000]  And once you've submitted to that, well, don't say mother and father and, well, let us sterilize your children.
[31:36.000 --> 31:42.000]  Take these four synoculations and here, take this Prozac pill and here, smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[31:42.000 --> 31:52.000]  Oh, don't be a Christian. This is truly the market to be system and we're on air right now covering it and you're awake. You're involved. You're engaged. You're an ambassador of truth.

[33:17.000 --> 33:28.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:28.000 --> 33:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the plan to destroy the Second Amendment and finally dishonor the American people has been announced. They're really coming for our guns this time.
[33:40.000 --> 33:55.000]  And the plan is to use AI to surveil and harass anyone that owns guns. Remember four months ago, Facebook came out and said, you will not mention Alex Jones' name or his website, ImpleWars.com, in a positive light or you'll be punished and banned.
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.000]  Well now, the reports are pouring in.
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.000]  Reporter Caitlin Bennett, the articles on ImpleWars.com will show TV viewers right now.
[34:06.000 --> 34:12.000]  They sent her a message saying, you're in trouble, you'll be banned next time you do this.
[34:12.000 --> 34:31.000]  This post goes against our community guidelines, claiming that Instagram, again, which is Facebook now, says that showing two women at a shooting range firing firearms is part of violence or dangerous organization, which means mafia.
[34:31.000 --> 34:40.000]  And this is being done in the court documents by having San Francisco list the NRA as a terrorist organization.
[34:40.000 --> 34:46.000]  Then they can put that into their guidelines claiming a governmental institution has said that and then it's adjudicated.
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  And then they start listing gun owners as part of a criminal organization.
[34:50.000 --> 34:56.000]  The outlawing, not just of guns, but of gun ownership and gun enthusiasm, making you a targeted group.
[34:56.000 --> 35:08.000]  First it's Alex Jones, then it's libertarians, then it's conservatives, then it's nationalist, then it's patriots, then it's people that want to raise their children and are worried about dangerous, unproven, untested vaccines.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  All these groups are being banned by Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter.
[35:11.000 --> 35:16.000]  These companies meet in consortiums and decide who they're going to target.
[35:16.000 --> 35:26.000]  This is the global social credit score of communist China being used against us right now in a huge way.
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.000]  We were the first to tell you about it and now it's here, huge article from RT.
[35:31.000 --> 35:36.000]  Facebook forming Supreme Court to moderate content, set censorship precedents.
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.000]  They appoint it and call it a independent court.
[35:39.000 --> 35:45.000]  It's like a communist Politburo or central committee where the communists take over, they overthrow you, they set up committees.
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.000]  And say, oh, the committees are law, like the dictator of China.
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.000]  They said a year ago that Xi is now a dictator and our media and our government says, oh, that's great.
[35:56.000 --> 36:04.000]  But Trump starts to say no to that, no to the fentanyl killing millions, no to China having one side of trade deals and he is the terrorist.
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  He is the problem.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  So the NRA is now being targeted just like I was.
[36:10.000 --> 36:19.000]  They are coming after everyone and if we don't organize and say no to this, we're done because this is bigger than censorship.
[36:19.000 --> 36:30.000]  This is organized racketeering, criminal action to bully and assault and harass and to cut Americans that own guns or support them out of the marketplace.
[36:30.000 --> 36:36.000]  Notice Beto O'Rourke last week said, it's time to go after gun owners credit cards.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  We know they're buying guns and ammo.
[36:39.000 --> 36:44.000]  We should see the major credit card companies kick them off.
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  And remember what Mastercard and Visa did in the last few months.
[36:47.000 --> 36:57.000]  They hired the Southern Poverty Law Center to create a special board, a special board that will look at your purchases and what you're doing and decide whether they're going to kick you off your credit card.
[36:57.000 --> 37:06.000]  So they're in your business watching what you're legally doing and Facebook saying you won't show to women legally at a gun range shooting handguns.
[37:06.000 --> 37:11.000]  And that's the AI.
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  Your post goes against our community guidelines.
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  They're guidelines.
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  And so if you even exercise the Second Amendment, we're going to do it.
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  If you exercise the First Amendment and we don't like it, you're going to be banned.
[37:24.000 --> 37:30.000]  That's what this country has become and we have to recognize and understand they're making their move this time.
[37:30.000 --> 37:37.000]  All the big corporations, the companies, Walmart not selling the guns, cult stopping to make civilian rifles.
[37:37.000 --> 37:46.000]  And then saying you can't even have a culture or show the exercise of it, attacking the Second and the First Amendment all at the same time.
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  That is beyond the Soviet Union.
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  They are coming.
[37:53.000 --> 38:04.000]  And instead I tuned into Fox this morning and I saw the Republican and Democrat senators up there arguing, but the Republicans were saying, well, if you can prove it helps public safety, we'll take the semi-autos.
[38:04.000 --> 38:12.000]  Help the public safety will be a failed narco state like Mexico if they take the guns.
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  Only the criminals will have it and every study shows that and they know it.
[38:16.000 --> 38:23.000]  The left knows that America is waking up and so they're trying to overturn the First and Second Amendment and all the others are already following.
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  We're losing every freedom right now.
[38:25.000 --> 38:37.000]  And they've wound the left up into an arrogant, monstrous group of individuals who have joined with the state, foreign corporations, and the Chai comms to come after our freedoms.
[38:37.000 --> 38:45.000]  Now, for the balance of the hour, we're going to get into the intimidation of these thugs and what they're doing and how they're completely out of control.
[38:45.000 --> 38:51.000]  Millie Weaver is an independent reporter. She has worked for InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com as well.
[38:51.000 --> 39:00.000]  And she has been producing a documentary series that's had tens of millions of viewers just in the last few months.
[39:00.000 --> 39:13.000]  And the Daily Caller, Breitbart, many others picked up this story in the last few days because the left has been viciously threatening her and viciously attacking her.
[39:13.000 --> 39:20.000]  And this InfoWars.com headline about it doesn't even really do it justice anti-Trump protesters verbally abused reporters.
[39:20.000 --> 39:25.000]  I know they threaten to sexually assault reporters.
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  This has happened to Caitlyn and Millie where they actually say, I'll rape you.
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  Not in this particular video. They just say, we can grab you by your genitals.
[39:32.000 --> 39:39.000]  Owen Troyer got grabbed by a woman who said, I'm allowed to. You're a Trump supporter. She just got convicted a few months ago in D.C.
[39:39.000 --> 39:47.000]  So these mobs are out of control. I had a leftist on the airplane, grabbed me in my seat and go, I love you so much. I love you.
[39:47.000 --> 39:54.000]  And my security guy starts pushing him away. We get off the plane, the guy comes over, he smelled real bad, looked mentally ill like Beto.
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.000]  He goes, I know you do it all for money, but I wanted to hurt you, but instead I hugged you.
[39:59.000 --> 40:05.000]  And I said, okay. He goes, and I said, get away from me. These are mental patients.
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.000]  So let's, let's, let's roll the daily callers boil down of this.
[40:10.000 --> 40:15.000]  And we'll tell you where to find the full videos, but they're going from crazed to violent to now.
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  Well, you've seen the videos where men start humping me. Are they fart on you?
[40:19.000 --> 40:26.000]  I mean, these are mentally ill individuals who think they're part of the cool club now because the mainstream media told them to go out and harass people.
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  Here it is.
[40:27.000 --> 40:35.000]  It's very hard to have a conversation out here with them. We're in a fuck-eye one, little Nazi bitch.
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  Come over there.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  An infant war's bitch.
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  Yeah.
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  No one can come over there.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  An infant war's bitch.
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  Yeah.
[40:43.000 --> 40:44.000]  No one can hear what you're saying.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  You can, bitch. That's what I'm talking to.
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  Do you mind? Can I grab your pussy?
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  Your face is not mine.
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  Your face is not mine.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  Your face is not mine.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  Your face is not mine.
[40:55.000 --> 41:00.000]  Would it be great if the Liberals actually practiced love?
[41:00.000 --> 41:06.000]  All I ever see or hear from them is intolerance and progenities.
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  Can I grab your pussy? Can I grab your pussy?
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  Huh? Are we be okay with that?
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.000]  You touch me and the police are going to arrest you, sir.
[41:19.000 --> 41:25.000]  So I wanted to take you over here with me to the Trump supporter side.
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.000]  And so you can experience what's over here on the Trump supporter side.
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  And maybe you can show me if there is racism over here that I should be concerned about.
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  He wants to know if he's going to be safe inside there if he goes.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  Yeah. Come on in. You go with us.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  You come on. Come on. You go right here with us.
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  You break a line.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  Come on, man. I put my arm around you, man.
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  It's all about love, man. I love all my people. I love all my people.
[41:48.000 --> 41:51.000]  Is he going to be safe if he comes in with you guys?
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  Because he doesn't know.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  For sure. Yeah, you'll be good.
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  He wants to tell you what does make America great and mean to you?
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  What does it mean to me? It means that we have opportunities.
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  Donald Trump has done a lot specifically for me.
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  Because with jobs and stuff like that.
[42:09.000 --> 42:14.000]  He wants to know if he goes in there if he's going to be safe and welcome.
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.000]  And I will welcome you with open arms.
[42:19.000 --> 42:20.000]  That hurts.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  We're all one people, right?
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  That's what we are saying.
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  So Marcos wanted to try the opposite now.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  We are going to do the opposite.
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.000]  He went into the Trump rally with me.
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.000]  And now I'm going to go over with an invitation to him.
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  And he's going to follow me around.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  When we come back, we're going to show you what happened.
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  Remember, we were herself in full wars dot com to Mara's news today.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  Remember, the globalist are trying to suppress you.
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  Big tech thinks you're weak when you share news wars dot com and band dot video in fours.
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.000]  Dot com you cross the enemy.
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  Band dot video is the answer to censorship.
[43:02.000 --> 43:08.000]  Band dot video is the answer for libertarians conservatives,
[43:08.000 --> 43:13.000]  pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform
[43:13.160 --> 43:16.520]  where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter
[43:16.520 --> 43:17.800]  are still available.
[43:17.800 --> 43:19.400]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen.
[43:19.400 --> 43:20.840]  It's now live.
[43:20.840 --> 43:22.760]  Band.video.
[43:22.760 --> 43:25.680]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home
[43:25.680 --> 43:27.480]  for Alex Jones or David Knight
[43:27.480 --> 43:30.080]  or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson banned videos.
[43:30.080 --> 43:31.600]  We are building it to be a place
[43:31.600 --> 43:34.360]  where banned memes are able to be posted
[43:34.360 --> 43:37.680]  and where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors
[43:37.680 --> 43:41.000]  are able to have a home free from being shut down,
[43:41.000 --> 43:42.480]  free from being censored,
[43:42.480 --> 43:44.800]  free from being silenced by big tech,
[43:44.800 --> 43:47.920]  the chai-coms, the Hollywood scum, and the globlest.
[43:47.920 --> 43:50.120]  Freedom of speech has a home.
[43:50.120 --> 43:52.640]  It's called band.video.
[43:52.640 --> 43:55.800]  America and the World is fighting back against tyranny
[43:55.800 --> 43:57.480]  at band.video.
[43:58.840 --> 44:03.840]  The Last Week and a Half, we've been running two specials
[44:03.840 --> 44:06.640]  that are the best deals in our history.
[44:06.640 --> 44:10.520]  75% off the Total Gut Health Combo Pack.
[44:10.520 --> 44:12.680]  That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[44:12.680 --> 44:15.760]  eight different products at over 50% off.
[44:15.760 --> 44:16.600]  It's incredible.
[44:16.600 --> 44:20.600]  We also have the Dust Till Dawn Info Wars AMP Impact,
[44:20.600 --> 44:22.520]  which makes it easy to take it in the morning
[44:22.520 --> 44:23.360]  and take it in the evening.
[44:23.360 --> 44:26.920]  13 different key capsules that are incredible.
[44:26.920 --> 44:28.480]  You want to supercharge your life?
[44:28.480 --> 44:29.800]  This helps you remember to do it,
[44:29.800 --> 44:31.360]  and the results for myself and many others
[44:31.360 --> 44:32.720]  that I've been working with.
[44:32.720 --> 44:34.240]  The results for myself and many others
[44:34.240 --> 44:36.400]  have been nothing less than astounding.
[44:36.400 --> 44:37.320]  Plus, you can't beat it.
[44:37.320 --> 44:38.840]  It funds the information war.
[44:38.840 --> 44:40.560]  You have absolutely nothing to lose,
[44:40.560 --> 44:42.480]  but not taking action.
[44:42.480 --> 44:46.280]  Believe you, the Deke State, Hillary, Obama, the NWO,
[44:46.280 --> 44:48.480]  they hope you don't support Info Wars
[44:48.480 --> 44:50.600]  in this urgent moment when they're trying to shut us down.
[44:50.600 --> 44:53.160]  So, we've got a whole bunch of other specials running as well.
[44:53.160 --> 44:54.000]  Check them out.
[44:54.000 --> 44:54.840]  They're all about to end.
[44:54.840 --> 44:56.280]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[44:59.480 --> 45:00.840]  I know most of you realize this,
[45:00.840 --> 45:03.760]  but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[45:03.760 --> 45:06.080]  You are just as important as I am
[45:06.080 --> 45:07.720]  or the rest of the crew at InfoWars,
[45:07.720 --> 45:10.640]  and we are the individuals that have done the research
[45:10.640 --> 45:12.520]  to understand the Globalist Battle Plan,
[45:12.520 --> 45:14.160]  and we know how to take them down.
[45:14.160 --> 45:15.560]  That's why they're so upset.
[45:15.560 --> 45:17.560]  Think how far we've come together.
[45:17.560 --> 45:19.240]  You know, even if we were losing,
[45:19.240 --> 45:20.600]  we'd all still keep fighting on,
[45:20.600 --> 45:22.240]  because it's the right thing to do
[45:22.240 --> 45:25.440]  against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order
[45:25.440 --> 45:28.000]  who've really taken the mask off.
[45:28.000 --> 45:29.960]  The line's in the sand for everybody now,
[45:29.960 --> 45:32.840]  but you'd already chosen to fight the corruption
[45:32.840 --> 45:35.400]  and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[45:35.400 --> 45:38.280]  So, I just want to take time out again to salute the audience
[45:38.280 --> 45:41.280]  because you are truly activist in the arena.
[45:41.280 --> 45:43.320]  And without you and your prayers and your word of mouth
[45:43.320 --> 45:45.320]  and your financial support,
[45:45.320 --> 45:47.080]  this operation that you built,
[45:47.080 --> 45:48.880]  that your operation would not be here.
[45:48.880 --> 45:51.160]  We've got some giant specials running right now
[45:51.160 --> 45:52.240]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[45:52.240 --> 45:54.440]  A lot of items, 50% off.

[45:56.320 --> 45:58.640]  to help us fight even harder into the future.
[45:58.640 --> 46:01.880]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn
[46:01.880 --> 46:03.160]  that Jeffrey Epstein was running
[46:03.160 --> 46:07.520]  a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[46:07.520 --> 46:10.680]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids
[46:10.680 --> 46:12.360]  and organ harvesting.
[46:12.360 --> 46:14.360]  I was the first to begin to warn
[46:14.360 --> 46:16.080]  that babies were being kept alive
[46:16.080 --> 46:19.600]  after they were born for their organs to be harvested.
[46:19.600 --> 46:22.040]  I was the first to warn you, along with Paul Watson
[46:22.040 --> 46:25.360]  at InfoWars.com, 15 years ago that Google
[46:25.360 --> 46:27.480]  was using microphones and hidden cameras
[46:27.480 --> 46:29.400]  to record everything you do
[46:29.400 --> 46:33.760]  at hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues.
[46:33.760 --> 46:35.400]  Like the Federal Reserve being private,
[46:35.400 --> 46:38.120]  run for profit, trying to control our economy
[46:38.120 --> 46:39.520]  that our government in Hollywood
[46:39.520 --> 46:41.400]  had been taken over by the Communist Chinese
[46:41.400 --> 46:44.320]  on every one of these issues and many others.
[46:44.320 --> 46:46.800]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm
[46:46.800 --> 46:48.200]  on a planetary scale.
[46:48.200 --> 46:50.880]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[46:50.880 --> 46:53.360]  And that's why you are more critical
[46:53.360 --> 46:54.920]  than ever to support the InfoWars.
[46:54.920 --> 46:56.520]  Please support the InfoWars.
[46:56.520 --> 46:58.760]  Support the InfoWars however you can.
[47:27.320 --> 47:31.360]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[47:31.360 --> 47:33.560]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:36.920 --> 47:40.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[47:40.720 --> 47:42.320]  We're gonna have Eddie Bravo and his co-host,
[47:42.320 --> 47:44.720]  Sam Tripoli in studio with us for the next two hours.
[47:44.720 --> 47:46.360]  It's gonna be a lot of fun and very informative.
[47:46.360 --> 47:47.920]  These are some smart guys.
[47:47.920 --> 47:49.880]  And also they challenge the entire paradigm
[47:49.880 --> 47:53.600]  and they host a very, very popular podcast online as well.
[47:53.600 --> 47:55.920]  The 10 Full Hat podcast, so looking forward to that.
[47:55.920 --> 47:57.240]  Coming up in studio.
[47:57.240 --> 47:58.400]  About to go a million, we were here in a moment.
[47:58.400 --> 48:00.600]  But first, ladies and gentlemen,
[48:00.600 --> 48:03.280]  we're running giant specials right now,
[48:03.280 --> 48:05.200]  some of which on particular items
[48:05.200 --> 48:07.920]  are the biggest we've ever done.
[48:07.920 --> 48:09.920]  Some of these items I'm selling at cost,
[48:09.920 --> 48:11.360]  even though they were already good sellers,
[48:11.360 --> 48:14.240]  because I need to get money in to reorder items
[48:14.240 --> 48:16.520]  for next year so we can fund ourselves.
[48:16.520 --> 48:19.760]  We fund ourselves by the purchases of the products you get.
[48:19.760 --> 48:22.080]  We built an independent media system
[48:22.080 --> 48:24.800]  that reaches tens of millions of new people a week.
[48:24.800 --> 48:26.360]  And that's what the globalists don't want,
[48:26.360 --> 48:27.920]  exposing their criminal activities.
[48:27.920 --> 48:30.120]  So these are products that are excellent,
[48:30.120 --> 48:31.280]  plus they're great prices,
[48:31.280 --> 48:34.040]  and it makes this transmission possible.
[48:34.040 --> 48:36.040]  Now one of the products that's 75% off
[48:36.040 --> 48:37.560]  and that's below cost.
[48:37.560 --> 48:38.800]  We did a huge order of it.
[48:38.800 --> 48:40.280]  It's sold decently.
[48:40.280 --> 48:42.160]  But I think they made a mistake this year
[48:42.160 --> 48:43.760]  in order to double what I said.
[48:43.760 --> 48:45.440]  So we got a ton of this.
[48:45.440 --> 48:50.160]  And it's 13 different pills for, I mean, it's amazing.
[48:50.160 --> 48:52.960]  It's got the fish oil in it, it's got the greens in it.
[48:52.960 --> 48:55.520]  It's got just the vitamins, the minerals,
[48:55.520 --> 48:57.840]  and it's all top of the chart quality.
[48:57.840 --> 49:00.960]  It is the AMPM eight-pack power stack.
[49:00.960 --> 49:02.720]  Pills you take in the morning, pills you take in the evening,
[49:02.720 --> 49:05.840]  in the little packets, and you get it all done
[49:05.840 --> 49:08.440]  and you don't forget to take all of your supplements.
[49:08.440 --> 49:10.040]  It helps me not to forget to do it.
[49:10.040 --> 49:11.880]  I've been doing it religiously for a month.
[49:11.880 --> 49:14.840]  I've already lost 15 pounds and had, as you've noticed,
[49:14.840 --> 49:17.520]  more energy, more clarity, more focus.
[49:17.520 --> 49:21.520]  The eight-pack power stack AMPM formula

[49:29.080 --> 49:32.360]  Myco-ZX, that's the other area of the probiotic.
[49:32.360 --> 49:35.040]  It kicks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[49:36.200 --> 49:38.800]  That's $19.95, that's like a dollar above cost.
[49:38.800 --> 49:40.320]  It's such an expensive formula.
[49:40.320 --> 49:43.320]  Ultra-12, 50% off the highest quality,
[49:43.320 --> 49:44.880]  B-12, take it under the tongue.

[49:46.800 --> 49:49.800]  of the original Secret-12, Ultra-12 even better.

[50:52.160 --> 50:54.480]  All right, going back to Millie Weaver.
[50:54.480 --> 50:56.600]  Millie Weaver, investigative journalist.
[50:56.600 --> 50:58.760]  She's going out making this documentary
[50:58.760 --> 51:01.720]  about who's really hateful.
[51:01.720 --> 51:03.320]  She can tell you about the film right now.
[51:03.320 --> 51:05.920]  The installments of it already have over 10 million views
[51:05.920 --> 51:08.120]  and that's just the pieces she's put out
[51:08.120 --> 51:09.760]  that are going into the upcoming film.
[51:09.760 --> 51:11.760]  This particular video I saw a few days ago
[51:11.760 --> 51:12.720]  had like five million views.
[51:12.720 --> 51:15.280]  I'm guessing it's probably 10 million right now,
[51:15.280 --> 51:17.160]  but let's just finish up with a daily caller
[51:17.160 --> 51:21.040]  and others linked to showing how nice the Trump supporters are
[51:21.040 --> 51:22.960]  versus how mean the anti-Trump folks are.
[51:22.960 --> 51:24.040]  Here it is.
[51:24.040 --> 51:25.840]  To do the opposite.
[51:25.840 --> 51:29.240]  He went into the Trump rally with me
[51:29.240 --> 51:32.880]  and now I'm going to go over with the demonstrators with him
[51:32.880 --> 51:34.200]  and he's going to follow me around
[51:34.200 --> 51:36.680]  and see if I get treated with love and tolerance.
[51:36.680 --> 51:37.640]  Let's go see.
[51:37.640 --> 51:40.720]  Okay, so we're also going to bring a Trump supporter with us
[51:40.720 --> 51:41.800]  to see what happens.
[51:41.800 --> 51:43.000]  He's going to come with us.
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.560]  That's a Trump supporter.
[51:45.560 --> 51:46.560]  Okay.
[51:50.480 --> 51:51.480]  Okay.
[51:53.240 --> 51:54.080]  All right, come on.
[51:54.080 --> 51:55.080]  Let's go over here.
[51:58.040 --> 52:01.320]  I really hope Trump supporters become a little more educated.
[52:01.320 --> 52:04.240]  Do you think that your message is going to resonate
[52:04.240 --> 52:05.440]  with Trump supporters?
[52:05.440 --> 52:07.040]  Hopefully, you know, what do they say?
[52:07.040 --> 52:09.600]  My grandma always said say it enough times for it to stick,
[52:09.600 --> 52:10.440]  right?
[52:10.440 --> 52:13.440]  I'm going to smoke in my face.
[52:13.440 --> 52:16.000]  The guy just blew a cigarette in my face.
[52:20.000 --> 52:21.440]  I blew a cigarette in my face.
[52:23.440 --> 52:24.440]  All right.
[52:25.440 --> 52:26.440]  Watch it.
[52:26.440 --> 52:38.840]  Kitsa kitsa kitsa.
[52:38.840 --> 52:41.640]  They're all body snatchers.
[52:41.640 --> 52:48.520]  Kitsa kitsa kitsa.
[52:48.520 --> 52:49.440]  Kitsa.
[52:49.440 --> 52:52.560]  He wants to run society, but they can't even wipe their asses.
[52:52.560 --> 53:03.760]  And because the guy wearing the pussy hat, who's not a Trump supporter, comes over, they're
[53:03.760 --> 53:05.560]  now being mean to him.
[53:05.560 --> 53:16.560]  How to win friends and influence people.
[53:16.560 --> 53:17.560]  Close the camps.
[53:17.560 --> 53:18.560]  No borders.
[53:18.560 --> 53:19.560]  No walls.
[53:19.560 --> 53:20.560]  No USA at all.
[53:20.560 --> 53:29.560]  Those are the most open borders in the world.
[53:29.560 --> 53:32.560]  They just put it in their ear with a bullhorn and chase her out.
[53:32.560 --> 53:34.560]  They just want to be mean.
[53:34.560 --> 53:48.560]  And then, now, the creeps are following her.
[53:48.560 --> 53:52.280]  Open borders in the world, but we're the bad guys, but they don't want to get here because we're so bad
[53:56.480 --> 53:59.760]  That's a powerful report it's up on info wars.com and news wars.com
[53:59.760 --> 54:04.560]  Let's go to Millie we were right now for this segment and the rest of the next Millie tell people about the film
[54:04.560 --> 54:08.800]  You're making about the pieces you're putting out. It's getting a lot of attention. I mean you have the idea a few months ago
[54:08.800 --> 54:10.400]  I said that's a great idea
[54:10.400 --> 54:13.400]  I said don't ask me what you think you ought to do just go out there and do it and boy
[54:13.400 --> 54:18.400]  You're really illustrating things that uh that uh love Trump's hate. Isn't that the name of the film?
[54:18.400 --> 54:19.440]  You're making
[54:19.440 --> 54:26.680]  Yes, actually, it's already up on Facebook. It's the documentary love Trump's hate. It's about 45 50 minutes long
[54:26.680 --> 54:33.080]  It essentially is that that piece that the daily caller put together that four-minute clip
[54:33.080 --> 54:39.600]  It's kind of a little bit of a montage shortened version, but really it's an amazing film this man
[54:39.980 --> 54:43.960]  Marcos Powell. He's a known leftist activist and protester
[54:43.960 --> 54:49.520]  I mean he has been out there already in the media as an activist and leftist so no one can try to say
[54:49.520 --> 54:55.480]  Oh, this was staged or set up. No, it was literally it just happened how it happened. I went out there
[54:55.480 --> 54:57.680]  I talked to these leftist protesters
[54:57.680 --> 55:05.100]  I talked to Marcos this man and he was willing and curious enough to go with me to the Trump supporters side
[55:05.100 --> 55:11.220]  He thought he was gonna make a point that the Trump supporters were the racist out of control vile people
[55:11.220 --> 55:14.240]  Well, lo and behold, we all know what happened
[55:14.940 --> 55:21.700]  The Trump supporters showed to be very peaceful loving welcoming and some of the dialogues and debates
[55:21.700 --> 55:24.460]  He got into with these Trump supporters is so
[55:25.020 --> 55:27.500]  You know, it's philosophical in many ways
[55:27.500 --> 55:33.340]  It's like he goes through this odyssey and he he hashes out all these leftist talking points
[55:33.340 --> 55:36.820]  And a lot of these Trump supporters debunk his misconceptions
[55:36.820 --> 55:44.620]  And then he ends up realizing that wow, he says to me literally he says so you're saying like what I've heard is not true
[55:44.940 --> 55:48.740]  And I said yes, the mainstream media has been lying to you
[55:48.740 --> 55:54.300]  And the only way you're gonna find the truth is to go to the Trump rally yourself and
[55:54.980 --> 55:56.980]  Experience it for yourself or
[55:57.700 --> 56:00.900]  About this yet million I'm gonna talk about it next week, but I've spent
[56:00.900 --> 56:07.300]  Six hours with five hours of taping with a major rap star household name
[56:08.180 --> 56:10.540]  out of Los Angeles a few days ago and
[56:11.380 --> 56:16.620]  He literally believes that people are dying in camps and that Trump's a Nazi and
[56:17.100 --> 56:19.380]  Literally believes that if you go to white people's houses
[56:19.940 --> 56:25.580]  Like get out that literally we kidnap black people and eat their brains and stuff and I mean
[56:25.860 --> 56:28.300]  But when you actually then show people it's not true
[56:28.300 --> 56:33.020]  They can't believe it or that you know, hey look Lewis Farrakhan's having to his house
[56:33.020 --> 56:39.020]  And you know and says since he thinks I'm a good guy and then it was like the guy couldn't compute it wait till this comes out
[56:39.020 --> 56:43.140]  I'm not ready to announce it yet. Well, we're gonna air it next week. I'm gonna leave it at that but
[56:44.300 --> 56:47.380]  Millie these people have been brainwashed and he could see the guy waking up
[56:47.380 --> 56:51.180]  He literally thought the Trump supporters were in the KKK and we're gonna attack him
[56:51.180 --> 56:58.460]  Well, the real white people that these black Democrats should actually be concerned about are the white liberals
[56:58.500 --> 57:02.460]  These people are the vehement racist whether they even know it or not
[57:02.460 --> 57:08.220]  They're the ones advocating for the deaths of millions of black unborn babies a year
[57:08.340 --> 57:11.620]  Okay, they're they're helping support these institutions that actually
[57:12.900 --> 57:17.020]  Look at that buck two of the people wrote in diaries another one told police
[57:17.020 --> 57:23.660]  It's coming out that he makes people use drugs so they start dying and pays the money and says he wants to suck their souls
[57:23.860 --> 57:29.140]  And I explained this there's different rituals. They do they can rape a kid makes me dive an OD
[57:29.140 --> 57:33.900]  It doesn't matter if they hurt somebody who's innocent. They believe they get the power from it
[57:33.900 --> 57:39.500]  We've been exposing this for a while about Ed Buck one of Hillary Clinton's right-hand men in California
[57:39.500 --> 57:45.900]  And that's what they do. He's literally sucking the energy out of black people. That's a Democrat specialty
[57:47.500 --> 57:53.740]  We have never been closer to a new world war with the crisis in the Middle East with the
[57:54.340 --> 57:57.220]  Saudi oil fields destroyed half of their
[57:58.500 --> 57:59.740]  capacity
[57:59.740 --> 58:01.740]  5% of world capacity
[58:01.740 --> 58:03.540]  Whoever's behind it
[58:03.540 --> 58:07.060]  Know this there are powerful forces that want a global configuration
[58:07.060 --> 58:13.860]  And now is the time to be more aware of that than ever and understand how precarious our position is
[58:14.140 --> 58:15.700]  Here on this planet
[58:15.700 --> 58:19.620]  And that we are just mortal flawed human beings that need to seek
[58:20.020 --> 58:22.020]  God's countenance God's
[58:22.340 --> 58:29.880]  discernment and to pray for peace and to pray for transparency and to pray that the very twisted evil forces on this planet
[58:29.880 --> 58:37.240]  Trying to start a world war will be exposed to their attempts at creating even bigger global crisis will be stopped now
[58:37.240 --> 58:40.200]  We'll probably avert a new world war. Hopefully, but it's already
[58:41.480 --> 58:47.420]  Tilting towards a global depression because of energy crises recovering it all live on the radio at info wars.com

[59:54.440 --> 1:00:05.960]  Oh, I'm so busy. I didn't even know that
[1:00:17.240 --> 1:00:22.360]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, I knew it was coming out any time and I'm glad daily calling everybody picked it up
[1:00:22.360 --> 1:00:27.160]  I'm so busy. I didn't even know that even though I've been you know financing it with your support
[1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:34.160]  Love Trump's hate that it was already out and it just came out. She's got an expanded directors cut
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:36.760]  That's gonna air tonight
[1:00:37.240 --> 1:00:38.480]  on

[1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:44.040]  the second
[1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:48.200]  30 minutes of the first hour and then the second hour tonight on firepower
[1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:55.240]  They're gonna try to air the entire documentary. Love Trump's hate, which is a perfect name because you think it's an anti-Trump
[1:00:55.840 --> 1:01:00.200]  Statement, but then you just go out and show people and I've seen large excerpts of the film
[1:01:00.200 --> 1:01:05.440]  Really, I've been so busy. I didn't know that you just ended up finally posting it to Facebook. So great job
[1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:07.440]  Hopefully you'll do a a part two
[1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:14.200]  We're gonna post the full film right now after you leave us to info wars calm and news wars calm
[1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:21.080]  But as you were telling me during the break people in you go see it because what you just saw in that daily color boil down is nothing. Oh
[1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:27.060]  Yeah, it's it doesn't even encompass the entire thing. There's so many great
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:34.760]  Moments and clips in there. There's moments when you can see other people standing around Marcos having these aha moments
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:39.920]  Like wait a second. Maybe the left are the vile angry ones. What's going on here?
[1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:45.320]  I mean, there are so many philosophical things. He gets into an amazing debate with a a black
[1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:51.840]  Info wars Trump supporter on the Trump side and she just destroys all of his leftist arguments
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:55.040]  She talks about how Obama care made her have to pay all this money
[1:01:55.040 --> 1:02:00.800]  I mean he goes through all these people and they just refute his arguments on the Trump side
[1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:04.440]  And then we go back in and we actually take some Trump supporters with us
[1:02:04.440 --> 1:02:06.440]  So it's not just only Marcos over there
[1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:11.480]  There are Trump supporters that are with us and these leftist protesters threw water on them
[1:02:11.480 --> 1:02:15.560]  They were telling them get out of here get on the other side of the street. You don't belong here
[1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:19.720]  They were you know cursing them out harassing at them yelling and screaming in our faces
[1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:23.120]  Marcus Powell in this clip with a daily caller
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:29.280]  You can even see this white liberal lady deranged lady is in his face with an American flag doing this in his face
[1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:32.840]  Like right in his face and he she even pokes him in the eye with his flag
[1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:38.760]  I mean she called me a Russian agent. So it's just it was so crazy
[1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:42.760]  And this is what happens at these Trump rallies and I really wanted to illustrate
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:49.400]  What actually goes on at these Trump rallies so that Americans themselves who don't want to go out to these rallies or haven't had an
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:53.560]  Opportunity can see what the mainstream media will not show them
[1:02:53.800 --> 1:02:59.760]  They won't show them that on the side of the street where the anti-trump protesters are they're screaming
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:04.400]  Yeah, yelling profanities at the Trump supporters tell him get out of here
[1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:08.400]  You can't be in our city all this vile stuff towards their fellow Americans
[1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:15.480]  Meanwhile, the Trump supporters are standing there waiting in line peacefully just waving and putting out peace signs and yes
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:22.480]  Every once in a while a statistical anomaly where you have like 40,000 Trump supporters in one area
[1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:27.760]  You're gonna have one person that snaps back at the crazy deranged leftist
[1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:33.840]  And then of course the mainstream media picks that up and runs it. Oh Trump supporters, you know beats up a leftist protester
[1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:36.880]  Trump supporter, you know screams at a leftist protester
[1:03:37.400 --> 1:03:46.240]  Yeah, one person out of like 40,000 that are literally being heckled and screamed at an attack by leftist non stop at these Trump rallies
[1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:47.360]  so
[1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:53.400]  That was the whole point of this is to essentially show people what the mainstream media isn't willing to show and
[1:03:54.480 --> 1:03:56.480]  I just feel like
[1:03:56.480 --> 1:03:57.880]  if
[1:03:57.880 --> 1:03:59.880]  We don't continue to
[1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:06.680]  Put this type of information out there and we don't continue to get your support you the listener support out there
[1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:10.800]  I don't know what's gonna happen if we have to leave it up to the mainstream media outlets
[1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:19.200]  Because the mainstream media outlets won't show this and they're painting the narrative that gun owners are bad that they're terrorists that they're evil that
[1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:27.120]  Conservatives are terrorists and evil what if we get a Democrat candidate in are they gonna put us all round us all up and put us in
[1:04:27.360 --> 1:04:30.760]  Re-education camps. I mean, this is what it's coming to and
[1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:37.600]  That's why we need your support. We need you guys go to infowars store calm get some awesome protein bars
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:45.360]  These are the best you can also get the Beto shirt Beto not shirt practice your first amendment while you save your second

[1:05:58.560 --> 1:06:03.280]  We are drugged out we are following other people's opinions
[1:06:03.280 --> 1:06:11.480]  We are controlled by the media today. It all changes this reality has been forced upon us
[1:06:11.480 --> 1:06:14.560]  It is a choice just like what I said slavery is a choice
[1:06:14.800 --> 1:06:20.880]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result. So we keep on saying I hate you

[1:06:32.600 --> 1:06:38.880]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy mother to change something Steve Jobs is crazy now
[1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:44.480]  We all know Steve Jobs phones. They say trucks crazy. They say I'm crazy, but I'm here to show love
[1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:48.440]  It's a bigger plan. I'm just doing what the universe told me
[1:06:48.440 --> 1:07:01.600]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones
[1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:08.480]  Attention American pigs China is in control of your country man
[1:07:08.720 --> 1:07:10.720]  We own Hollywood
[1:07:10.880 --> 1:07:15.920]  We own your debt and we owe Harvard and the Democratic Party

[1:07:52.880 --> 1:07:54.220]  I
[1:07:54.220 --> 1:07:57.800]  And don't fight back with the media will call your names
[1:07:57.800 --> 1:08:05.700]  and you don't want that, shut up and do what we tell you, shut up and die, and get rid
[1:08:05.700 --> 1:08:14.600]  of Trump and Alex Jones, you are not going to beat us.
[1:08:14.600 --> 1:08:23.280]  Well the chosen one, Beto O'Rourke, was supposedly the guy that was going to beat Donald Trump,
[1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:28.600]  but really he was just one more plastic wooden phony person that the establishment tried
[1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:38.920]  to give superstar status to, even though he didn't have one ounce of charisma in him.
[1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:43.000]  He's just like their whole new order system, everything about it is sicky sweet packaged
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:49.320]  and full of hype, but because it's coming from a soulless parasite, it never really
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:53.280]  has a connection to us and falls on deaf ears.
[1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:58.440]  Only the dumbest willful slaves that serve the democratic party's lies and believe they're
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:04.400]  going to get all these freak goodies from socialism and globalism buy into it, but as
[1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:11.040]  soon as Beto falls they've just moved on to the next supposed savior, but his latest
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:16.200]  event trying to look human, trying to look like a regular person really blew up in his
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:21.240]  face bigger than anything, it went viral in a way he certainly is not happy about.
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:28.400]  Post began to point out as he sat there supposedly grilled hamburgers that he wasn't grilling
[1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:33.360]  them, he was cooking them on a no stick pan on a regular stove top and that the cheese
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:39.720]  wasn't properly melted and he did it in a very bizarre halting strange way, clearly
[1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:44.120]  not comfortable in his element and never done it before, but that's not the issue.
[1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:53.360]  It's that he puts it on an English muffin and he begins to pant and say, look, that's
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:58.880]  not all, like he's a space alien that visited the planet for the first time and is going
[1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:04.000]  through a human custom of hamburgers, but he's not a space alien, he's not a robot,
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:11.280]  he is a social climber, he is clearly a sociopath, probably a psychopath that does these little
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:15.920]  so called human rituals to try to trick you so we can get up close to you, all he's ever
[1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:22.520]  done is study how to manipulate because he's so disingenuous, he is a hollow man, so we'll
[1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:26.640]  play the audio for you, show you some of the tweets, but you know you can laugh at these
[1:10:26.640 --> 1:10:31.080]  but it's really really serious because not just in Texas but anywhere, a real burger
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:35.640]  is not cooked on a stove top on a no stick pan, flame broiled, everybody knows that
[1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:40.400]  or it's cooked over charcoal or over gas, you know you melt the cheese, you know you
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:46.200]  don't ever put beef or anything else on an English muffin, the way it's all crumpled just
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:51.680]  looks like, he's escaped from a lunatic asylum, but the so called super class isn't really
[1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:56.280]  a super class, they've been put there by the real powerful institutional wealth that's
[1:10:56.280 --> 1:11:01.280]  completely removed from humanity to just be their rear guard action while they develop
[1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:08.480]  their breakaway civilization, so that's food for thought, back to Owen Shroyer and his
[1:11:08.480 --> 1:11:15.320]  special guest right here at InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:22.040]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[1:11:22.040 --> 1:11:23.040]  the InfoWars.
[1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:30.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got Eddie Bravo and Sam Tripoli in studio with us for the
[1:11:30.640 --> 1:11:35.040]  next two hours and Paul Joseph wants it to take over and they're coming in with us tomorrow
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:39.720]  because they've got shows that I'm told some of which are sold out already, but still some
[1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:41.520]  folks might be able to go.
[1:11:41.520 --> 1:11:46.280]  Here in Austin, Texas, so Sam Tripoli is an American comedian, writer, producer, host
[1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:50.640]  from Los Angeles, host of the tinfoil hat with Sam Tripoli and of course we've got Eddie
[1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:55.760]  Bravo, doesn't need any introduction, 10th planet, Dojo's all over the place, all over
[1:11:55.760 --> 1:11:59.920]  the world, very successful, of course good buddies with Joe Rogan, they both come up together,
[1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:05.640]  gotten famous and successful together and he co-hosted Joe Rogan podcast quite often
[1:12:05.640 --> 1:12:11.280]  and at the same time, he of course has, you've been a world champion, jiu-jitsu expert who
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:15.960]  helped rewrite the rules from the whole Gracie cult, we're not putting them down, it's just
[1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:16.960]  that that's the facts.
[1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:17.960]  Did they have you here, man?
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:18.960]  Thank you for having me.
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:19.960]  Did they have you?
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:20.960]  It was good to be on your show.
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:21.960]  Good to have you here.
[1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:25.920]  Hey man, you were a class act, you came in, you were wonderful and I thoroughly enjoyed
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:26.920]  it.
[1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:31.520]  You know what man, I talked to a lot of people like, oh, Joe's on your show, I go, guy was
[1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:37.240]  the nicest dude ever, came in was fucking class, excuse me, and he was a good guy, so
[1:12:37.240 --> 1:12:38.400]  I appreciate you coming on.
[1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:40.120]  Oh, you bet you guys are awesome.
[1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:43.000]  I was, I got a bunch of stuff I want to cover here, this is a ton of topics, but I wanted
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.760]  to ask you up front what you think's most important, you said, hey, let's talk about
[1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:51.120]  the cancel culture, the censorship, how crazy it's getting, how a lot of the lefts turning
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:55.440]  against it, because they're all getting in trouble, I mean how is it okay for a tropic
[1:12:55.440 --> 1:12:59.120]  thunder to be in blackface, but then if somebody else does it as a joke, it's bad, if it's
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:03.360]  a joke, it's a joke, I mean I put green green on and say I'm a lizard, and it's not done
[1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:07.680]  to be racist, what's the problem, but now Justin Trudeau may have to step down, we're
[1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:11.800]  going to show that video, in fact, roll some of that video of him in blackface, go ahead.
[1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:12.800]  What's your take on that?
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:17.040]  Well, you know, I'm good friends with a cat named Mike Ward, who's like this famous
[1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:21.200]  comedian who got heckled by two lesbians, and they took him to court and he had to
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:25.040]  pay a fine for basically hate speech under Trudeau.
[1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:29.840]  I mean like, it's ridiculous here, and that's how I say he needs to step down.
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:34.840]  I do think he needs to step down, I think, listen, I actually think that anybody should
[1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:40.240]  just be having fun, the notion that if you wear blackface, all of a sudden, you hate
[1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:46.120]  everybody, it's just ridiculous, it's like we got away from what racism is, it's like
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:47.120]  you're horrible people.
[1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:51.240]  I mean tropic thunder is funny when he's doing that, and I make fun of white people, rednecks
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:55.880]  and stuff, and I did that whole Chinese dragonling, American scum, it's fun.
[1:13:55.880 --> 1:14:00.560]  It's dude, here's the thing, the rules of comedy, there's no rule for everybody, there's
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:06.080]  so many fine print to everything, and that when someone you love does it, all of a sudden
[1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:09.680]  like you turn your head, and that's the problem, are you going to force the rule, or are you
[1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:10.680]  going to be a hypocrite?
[1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:15.160]  And that's what we're seeing here, you need to go, you fire people for less, you need
[1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:19.320]  to go, especially since you're enforcing rules on Canadians, about like freedom of
[1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:21.360]  speech, get out of here dude.
[1:14:21.360 --> 1:14:25.440]  Exactly in fact when it came out, the Republicans had done blackface, he called for the resignation.
[1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:29.040]  Well then listen you little piece of crap, walk the plank.
[1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:33.760]  It's just getting crazy man, it's just out of control, it's like as soon as you set
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:37.160]  a golden rule, someone you love is going to break it, and then what do you do?
[1:14:37.160 --> 1:14:42.640]  I mean we got everyone going after my friend Shane Gillis for being kicked off of kicking
[1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:46.840]  him off of Saturday Night Live, and then you find out that Saturday Night Live did a giant
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:51.280]  yellow face stash in 2014.
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:52.280]  What are we talking about here?
[1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:54.720]  I'm going to bring back Jack Malusi when he does the samurai.
[1:14:54.720 --> 1:14:55.720]  Yeah.
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:14:57.720]  I mean I'm ready to do that right, that's hilarious.
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:00.360]  You think Trudeau is Fidel Castro's son?
[1:15:00.360 --> 1:15:07.160]  No, but we actually have Fidel Castro's grandson actually works here.
[1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:08.160]  Really?
[1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:09.160]  Really.
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:10.160]  I'm not kidding, I'll show you some photos of him.
[1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:11.840]  Are you going to ask him about his cousin then?
[1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:12.840]  No.
[1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:13.840]  I'm being sarcastic.
[1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:19.840]  One of our crew members, I see Tim's laughing, drew, one of our crew members literally looks
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:20.840]  like Fidel Castro.
[1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:23.360]  But isn't there a picture of Fidel?
[1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:27.360]  I mean he's a big Mexican and he looks like Fidel, he's got the big beard, you're like
[1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:29.160]  whoa that's Fidel Castro.
[1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:35.480]  There's a picture of Fidel Castro and Trudeau as a baby in his hands, right?
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:36.480]  Is that a picture?
[1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:44.760]  My father and father visited Cuba right around the time before he was born, dude.
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:49.160]  I mean we did this whole thing called Kaka Palooza on my show.
[1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:52.120]  I mean what about Barbara Bush and her?
[1:15:52.120 --> 1:15:53.120]  Alistair Crowley.
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:56.680]  Yeah, they look exactly alike.

[1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:03.200]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental
[1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:06.040]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[1:18:06.040 --> 1:18:10.680]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[1:18:10.680 --> 1:18:15.480]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born
[1:18:15.480 --> 1:18:18.040]  for their organs to be harvested.
[1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:23.800]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson at infowars.com 15 years ago that Google
[1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:28.560]  was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds and
[1:18:28.560 --> 1:18:34.960]  hundreds of other giant issues like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying
[1:18:34.960 --> 1:18:38.840]  to control our economy that our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist
[1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:42.840]  Chinese on every one of these issues and many others.
[1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:46.800]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale.
[1:18:46.800 --> 1:18:51.560]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical
[1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:53.600]  than ever to support the info war.
[1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:57.000]  Please support the info war however you can.

[1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:41.240]  Tickets are going really fast.
[1:20:41.240 --> 1:20:45.040]  Usually when you come to town they end up selling out but it is a nice size theater.
[1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:46.280]  There's a good chance I'm going to be there.
[1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:50.760]  I don't want to come see these guys but regardless, tell folks how they find it, how they get
[1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:51.760]  tickets.

[1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:43.600]  Yeah.
[1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:44.600]  I'm teasing you.
[1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:48.960]  Hey, seriously though, I want to get into weather modification, geoengineering and how
[1:21:48.960 --> 1:21:52.600]  we're completely vindicated next segment and how it's all admitted now in the national
[1:21:52.600 --> 1:21:53.600]  news and textbooks.
[1:21:53.600 --> 1:21:58.880]  Oh, we put it in the jet fuel and it's aluminum docks, Iberium salts and also the radio activizer
[1:21:58.880 --> 1:21:59.880]  tubes.
[1:21:59.880 --> 1:22:00.880]  That's the next segment.
[1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:04.920]  This is a shorter segment, a little bit longer segment coming up.
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:06.680]  Just the state of the world, both of you.
[1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:10.160]  What would you call what's going on in the world where Epstein comes out, that he's
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:15.280]  running a eugenics cult and all these people and in devil worship and world government
[1:22:15.280 --> 1:22:21.400]  and the Iran situation and just all the craziness that's going on?
[1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:26.400]  I mean, dude, it's all about these lizard people, dude, and how they're trying to control
[1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:29.400]  us through pain and suffering and anger, man.
[1:22:29.400 --> 1:22:31.520]  You know, Nino, it's all these people.
[1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:33.320]  When everyone's related, it's all the same.
[1:22:33.320 --> 1:22:37.200]  They can't create anything and they make us all angry all the time.
[1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:40.040]  Like that shooting commercial, what was that about?
[1:22:40.040 --> 1:22:41.840]  That's being in fear and anger.
[1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:45.480]  They don't want us to focus that we are the real power, man.
[1:22:45.480 --> 1:22:49.280]  If we all come together, we can put, we can control everything and they don't like that.
[1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:53.000]  Well, you say lizard people, but the globalists say they're making a breakaway civilization.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:56.720]  They're going to merge with machines and be gods and then they're telling us, you're
[1:22:56.720 --> 1:23:01.800]  bad, roll over and die and they're changing the atmosphere, then I watch they live written
[1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:06.600]  from a 1960s book made in the 1980s and it's like, it's like a documentary.
[1:23:06.600 --> 1:23:08.840]  Yeah, I'm with you, dude.
[1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:11.800]  Everything you were saying forever, everything I've been saying, everything A's been saying
[1:23:11.800 --> 1:23:15.040]  all comes out true, but nobody ever will remember that.
[1:23:15.040 --> 1:23:17.640]  They're out to get us, they're attacking our genetics, they're killing us and while we're
[1:23:17.640 --> 1:23:21.520]  all busy fighting with each other over what color we are, they're literally creating a
[1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:23.120]  post-human world in their own words.
[1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:27.120]  We are cattle and the farmers don't want us unionizing.
[1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:28.120]  That's what's going on, dog.
[1:23:28.120 --> 1:23:30.120]  What's going on, dog?
[1:23:30.120 --> 1:23:33.120]  Were you going to play that clip of John Brennan?
[1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:34.120]  I'll say next segment.
[1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:35.120]  Oh, next segment.
[1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:36.120]  Next segment.
[1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:37.120]  I'm asking you about...
[1:23:37.120 --> 1:23:38.120]  Go on, Eddie.
[1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:39.120]  I'm planting the hook.
[1:23:39.120 --> 1:23:40.320]  I thought I'm asking you.
[1:23:40.320 --> 1:23:44.400]  What do you think, what do you think now that it's, they've admitted that they're doing
[1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:45.400]  it?
[1:23:45.400 --> 1:23:46.400]  I think the lizards are bisexual.
[1:23:46.400 --> 1:23:47.960]  I'm just throwing that out.
[1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:48.960]  What do you think?
[1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:49.960]  What do you think?
[1:23:49.960 --> 1:23:50.960]  Sexually.
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:56.080]  I'm not having any sexual lizards.
[1:23:56.080 --> 1:23:57.240]  Okay, now that they're...
[1:23:57.240 --> 1:23:59.160]  There, they like it.
[1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:02.520]  Now that they admitted that they're spraying the skies, now they're saying they're trying
[1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:08.880]  to protect Earth and the atmosphere, what do you think is the real reason for it?
[1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:11.240]  I want to get into it next segment and we'll do a couple segments on it.
[1:24:11.240 --> 1:24:15.000]  That's what I'm asking you is about the big picture, which then feeds into that.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:16.200]  Why are they trying to build?
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:21.440]  NBC News, Washington Post, humans are bad, post-human world's about to be here, humanity
[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:24.400]  will be extinct within one generation, a new superhuman will be here.
[1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:26.600]  I mean, this is diabolical Hitler stuff.
[1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:28.040]  Well, you know what it is, man?
[1:24:28.040 --> 1:24:31.600]  They want transhumanism because they know when they die and they go to the Archons,
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:35.840]  they're going to have to go some lesser form and come back as like a one-eyed woodchuck
[1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:40.160]  because they're such evil people and they'll never go to a higher level and they hang out
[1:24:40.160 --> 1:24:41.160]  with the gods.
[1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:42.160]  You know what I'm saying?
[1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:43.160]  That's it.
[1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:46.600]  They're lizards, they have no consciousness, they can't do it.
[1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:47.600]  And this is as high as they get.
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:48.600]  They're just feeding on us.
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:49.600]  And they don't want to die.
[1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:50.600]  Because we're in horrible form.
[1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:51.600]  Yeah.
[1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:52.600]  By the way, they admit that.
[1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:53.600]  Yeah.
[1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:54.600]  You imagine they know there's gum.
[1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:55.600]  Yeah.
[1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:59.280]  They just have been around, so it's like a full grown adult, like beating a baby up.
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:00.280]  Yeah.
[1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:02.960]  Once you grow up, he can't beat you up, but right now they're kicking our ass.
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:05.040]  I want to fight John Bolton for charity.
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:11.000]  I say right here, John Bolton, me, you, in the Octagon fight, all money goes to charity.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.880]  That, let me tell you, that's a purve stash.
[1:25:13.880 --> 1:25:14.880]  Yeah.
[1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:15.880]  That is.
[1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:17.360]  By the way, I don't know if he's into some purve stuff too.
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:18.360]  Yeah.
[1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:19.360]  Yeah.
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:21.400]  That's definitely some 1985 hardcore gay porn stash.
[1:25:21.400 --> 1:25:22.560]  He's a leather daddy.
[1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:23.560]  For sure.
[1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:24.560]  A leather daddy.
[1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:26.680]  100% power bottom.
[1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:27.680]  That's my opinion.
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:28.680]  Family show.
[1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:29.680]  Oh, my apologies.
[1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:30.680]  No, no, really.
[1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:38.200]  I reportedly, reportedly that is what Bolton does, and that's the whole inside thing in
[1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:39.200]  New York.
[1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:40.200]  So whatever.
[1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:43.560]  I just don't know why, but he's, you know, not in a little leather outfit, why he wants
[1:25:43.560 --> 1:25:44.640]  to blow the planet up.
[1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:46.760]  Why is, why, what's going on with Iran?
[1:25:46.760 --> 1:25:51.200]  We got rid of the guy that wanted the Iran stuff, and now we got this thing happening
[1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:52.200]  again.
[1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:54.200]  Hey, there's nothing wrong with it, but what is wrong?
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:55.200]  Yeah.
[1:25:55.200 --> 1:25:56.200]  Look at that mouth.
[1:25:56.200 --> 1:25:57.200]  That guy likes it weird.
[1:25:57.200 --> 1:25:58.200]  You want to stay away from that.
[1:25:58.200 --> 1:25:59.200]  Yeah.
[1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:00.200]  Jared Kushner likes it weird too.
[1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:02.560]  He looks like he likes to have sex with a knife to his throat.
[1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:04.840]  Anybody else?
[1:26:04.840 --> 1:26:06.160]  He does look like that.
[1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:10.280]  Doesn't he like, that's the only way you can get the magic happen?
[1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:13.960]  I'm just telling you, dude, he's, he looks like he likes to put laugh tracks in snuff
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:14.960]  films.
[1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:15.960]  Anybody else?
[1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:21.160]  Like that's his hobby, and we, can we get more coffee?
[1:26:21.160 --> 1:26:22.160]  We're going to have a break.
[1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:23.160]  That's the good part about this.
[1:26:23.160 --> 1:26:24.160]  And we can give you tranquilizers.
[1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:25.160]  Do we need a tranquilizer gun?
[1:26:25.160 --> 1:26:26.160]  Say it triply.
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:27.160]  Get my blow dart gun.
[1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:28.160]  Get the Hitler in here.
[1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:29.160]  Get the Hitler on the phone.
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:30.160]  Get the Hitler on the phone.
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:31.160]  Get the Hitler on the phone.
[1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:32.160]  Get the Hitler on the phone.
[1:26:32.160 --> 1:26:33.160]  Get the Hitler on the phone.
[1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:34.160]  Get the Hitler on the phone.
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:39.160]  I can call Hitler's grandson here right now.
[1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:41.520]  Do we actually have Hitler's grandson in the building?
[1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:42.520]  Yeah, dude.
[1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:43.520]  Where's he from?
[1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:44.520]  You never believe that.
[1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:45.520]  We actually do.
[1:26:45.520 --> 1:26:46.520]  Where's he from, Argentina?
[1:26:46.520 --> 1:26:47.520]  They don't work for me.
[1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:48.520]  Really?
[1:26:48.520 --> 1:26:49.520]  That's gonna, that's Goku.
[1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:50.520]  Had he been a good2render?
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:53.020]  No, he's the new giveaway.
[1:26:53.020 --> 1:26:54.020]  Hitler.
[1:26:54.020 --> 1:26:55.520]  He's fight a good hitler.
[1:26:55.520 --> 1:26:59.060]  The clone of the future is gonna fight the bad Hitler, you're sending back in time.
[1:26:59.060 --> 1:27:04.020]  They're gonna take that sound bite and play it on CNN.
[1:27:04.020 --> 1:27:10.200]  He's employing Hitler's grandkids. It's true. Come on, dude. We all know that Hitler was a gay juice shill
[1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:13.880]  He used to do he was Jewish. He's a Rothschild and he had a crystal meth problem
[1:27:13.880 --> 1:27:18.080]  Which means you're gonna get weird and try to stuff stuff into your prison wallet, okay?
[1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:22.680]  And it just he was obviously controlled opposition. So it's true. I mean, it's true
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:26.080]  The guy was in the way was set up by British intelligence. They had a peace treaty dude
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:30.680]  He was a Rothschild the king of England. He was a Rothschild. Is that is I mean, is that proof?
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:37.700]  No, it's actually true that he's a Rothschild. Yeah. Well, his father was all this and his grandma his grandmother was the main
[1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:42.380]  The main Rothschild house in in Austria in Vienna, but but that's only part of it
[1:27:42.980 --> 1:27:45.940]  We're getting serious here. Okay. Hitler's not the building. That was a joke
[1:27:46.500 --> 1:27:48.500]  Hitler's left the building long time ago
[1:27:48.820 --> 1:27:55.180]  But seriously British intelligence Lord Milner set up the Nazi Party Kaiser Wilhelm was funded by
[1:27:55.180 --> 1:28:00.860]  John D. Rockefeller Kaiser Wilhelm Institute the Cold Springs Harbor out of New York. They set the whole thing up
[1:28:00.860 --> 1:28:05.460]  They had a peace treaty. They were put the king of England ever the eight. It was German on the EU throne
[1:28:05.820 --> 1:28:09.820]  So so the Olympics sign was Hitler came up with that the Volkswagen. He came with all that
[1:28:09.820 --> 1:28:13.580]  He drew the first Volkswagen engine in the back. It was an art. He was an architect, right?
[1:28:13.580 --> 1:28:15.740]  Well, yeah, he designed it all with with Albert Speer
[1:28:15.740 --> 1:28:20.540]  He designed all sorts of buildings and and the and the Autobahn everything. Yeah, so he had this whole big plan
[1:28:21.140 --> 1:28:23.700]  and we can't the Rothschilds are pretty smart folks, but
[1:28:23.700 --> 1:28:25.700]  then
[1:28:26.020 --> 1:28:30.820]  But British intelligence had it all set up with ever the eight where they pulled him back and set the whole deal up
[1:28:30.820 --> 1:28:36.860]  Then blew up the Germans. He said his final thing was to go the the gods of war have turned to the other side
[1:28:36.860 --> 1:28:38.860]  What do you think that means?
[1:28:38.860 --> 1:28:41.500]  And he said though well, but we fight for the coming man
[1:28:41.500 --> 1:28:47.220]  So they think this new global messiah to rule the EU worldwide is coming. All right. That's all real
[1:28:47.220 --> 1:28:54.260]  The part of the crush that segment dog. We cross the section. Yeah, you have done well Lord. Hey, dog. I'll be back
[1:28:55.780 --> 1:29:00.820]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house
[1:29:00.820 --> 1:29:07.340]  I sued the IRS in one I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[1:29:07.340 --> 1:29:10.940]  And I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems. They thought might never be solved
[1:29:10.940 --> 1:29:15.140]  I can help you to if you owe taxes. You can't pay. Don't wait another day
[1:29:15.140 --> 1:29:21.340]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case call 800 34 no tax or go to my website danpilla.com
[1:29:21.780 --> 1:29:25.020]  That's Dan Pilla calm Dan Pilla calm
[1:29:25.740 --> 1:29:27.020]  Maybe not today
[1:29:27.020 --> 1:29:33.180]  Maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive forget bunkers
[1:29:33.180 --> 1:29:35.020]  You're not a live underground gopher
[1:29:35.020 --> 1:29:40.580]  You need survivalist camps the ultimate fully functional off-the-grid mobile survival bug-out house
[1:29:40.580 --> 1:29:48.940]  That's well equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer bold statement. You bet see him now at survivalist camps calm
[1:29:48.940 --> 1:29:54.580]  That's survivalist camps calm trust your family survival to survivalist camps calm
[1:29:56.580 --> 1:30:02.780]  We have never been closer to a new world war with the crisis in the Middle East with the
[1:30:03.380 --> 1:30:06.300]  Saudi oil fields destroyed half of their
[1:30:06.300 --> 1:30:10.220]  Capacity five percent of world capacity
[1:30:10.780 --> 1:30:12.580]  Whoever's behind it
[1:30:12.580 --> 1:30:16.100]  Know this there are powerful forces that want a global conflagration
[1:30:16.980 --> 1:30:24.260]  And now is the time to be more aware of that than ever and understand how precarious our position is here on this planet
[1:30:24.740 --> 1:30:28.620]  And that we are just mortal flawed human beings that need to seek
[1:30:28.620 --> 1:30:38.420]  God's countenance God's discernment and to pray for peace and to pray for transparency and to pray that the very twisted evil forces on
[1:30:38.420 --> 1:30:45.180]  This planet trying to start a world war will be exposed and their attempts at creating even bigger global crisis will be stopped
[1:30:45.820 --> 1:30:49.100]  Now we'll probably avert a new world war. Hopefully, but it's already
[1:30:49.100 --> 1:30:57.820]  Tilting towards a global depression because of energy crises. We're covering it all live on the radio at m4s.com
[1:31:02.580 --> 1:31:08.220]  The last week and a half we've been running two specials that are the best deals in our history

[1:31:41.460 --> 1:31:45.060]  Believe you the deep state Hillary Obama the NWO
[1:31:45.060 --> 1:31:49.260]  They hope you don't support him for wars in this urgent moment. We're trying to shut us down
[1:31:49.420 --> 1:31:55.140]  So we've got a whole bunch of other specials running as well. Check them out. They're all about to end in four store calm
[1:31:58.140 --> 1:32:00.140]  We have entered a great time of change
[1:32:01.060 --> 1:32:02.860]  the social engineers
[1:32:02.860 --> 1:32:05.940]  The surf Satan were in control of this planet
[1:32:06.500 --> 1:32:09.780]  Believe that if they can organize enough crises that they control
[1:32:09.780 --> 1:32:15.500]  They can terrorize the planet into accepting a tyrannical corporate world government
[1:32:15.700 --> 1:32:22.900]  Known as a technocracy in their own words that will manage and control and manipulate every facet of our lives at first
[1:32:23.580 --> 1:32:26.940]  They can do just a few basic things to do don't support Trump
[1:32:26.940 --> 1:32:30.020]  Don't put on Alex Jones and once you've submitted to that
[1:32:30.020 --> 1:32:33.700]  Well, don't say mother and father and well let us sterilize your children
[1:32:33.700 --> 1:32:41.500]  Take these force inoculations and here take this Prozac pill and here smoke this weaponized marijuana. Oh, don't be a Christian
[1:32:42.380 --> 1:32:45.580]  This is truly the market to be system and we're on air right now
[1:32:45.820 --> 1:32:49.860]  Covering it and you're awake. You're involved. You're engaged. You're an ambassador of truth
[1:32:49.860 --> 1:32:56.340]  So I'm begging you for yourself and myself and my family and your family spread the word about info wars calm the live shows right now
[1:32:56.340 --> 1:33:03.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:03.020 --> 1:33:13.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:13.500 --> 1:33:27.220]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:27.220 --> 1:33:30.020]  Do host me show.
[1:33:30.020 --> 1:33:32.020]  Do host.
[1:33:32.020 --> 1:33:33.020]  Do host me show.
[1:33:33.020 --> 1:33:34.020]  All right, let's get serious.
[1:33:34.020 --> 1:33:35.020]  Go.
[1:33:35.020 --> 1:33:36.020]  Do host.
[1:33:36.020 --> 1:33:37.020]  Got any bravo?
[1:33:37.020 --> 1:33:38.020]  Who's not said a word yet?
[1:33:38.020 --> 1:33:39.020]  You're just about to break my neck, though.
[1:33:39.020 --> 1:33:40.020]  That was a joke, but I was on Joe Rose.
[1:33:40.020 --> 1:33:45.020]  It's the biggest podcast ever.
[1:33:45.020 --> 1:33:48.580]  When I was like, I'm going to kick your ass, I was like, Jones, you can't kick his ass.
[1:33:48.580 --> 1:33:49.580]  I know.
[1:33:49.580 --> 1:33:50.580]  It's called a joke.
[1:33:50.580 --> 1:33:54.820]  Like when I said Fidel Castro's grandson works here, or Hitler's grandson works here,
[1:33:54.820 --> 1:33:55.820]  it's a joke.
[1:33:55.820 --> 1:34:04.420]  When I'm not about to be joking, I'm about to go crazy.
[1:34:04.420 --> 1:34:05.420]  That's the sound.
[1:34:05.420 --> 1:34:06.420]  Now we're going to fight.
[1:34:06.420 --> 1:34:13.420]  Do host me show.
[1:34:13.420 --> 1:34:16.420]  Do host.
[1:34:16.420 --> 1:34:22.180]  Sounds like if Adolf Hitler was still alive, he'd be down with the song, right?
[1:34:22.180 --> 1:34:23.180]  Yeah.
[1:34:23.180 --> 1:34:28.980]  He'd be smoking meth, hanging out with Ed Buck, getting weird, but it would be a picture
[1:34:28.980 --> 1:34:30.500]  to catch him between Ed and Buck.
[1:34:30.500 --> 1:34:33.780]  Oh, Buck's definitely a top.
[1:34:33.780 --> 1:34:35.140]  He's a weirdo like that.
[1:34:35.140 --> 1:34:37.100]  But it's like, none happens, dude.
[1:34:37.100 --> 1:34:43.180]  Like I hang out, I do this skank fest every year with Legion of Skanks and they got in
[1:34:43.180 --> 1:34:48.020]  trouble for Louis CK being on and everyone blew wet knots on them.
[1:34:48.020 --> 1:34:52.940]  But everyone associated with Jeffrey Epstein seems to be business as usual.
[1:34:52.940 --> 1:34:53.940]  Nothing ever happened.
[1:34:53.940 --> 1:34:54.940]  We're going to hit Epstein next hour.
[1:34:54.940 --> 1:34:55.940]  Okay.
[1:34:55.940 --> 1:34:56.940]  I will hold that to next hour.
[1:34:56.940 --> 1:35:00.620]  Let me just, let me just get to the, what we can prove is because it's a joke if Adolf
[1:35:00.620 --> 1:35:03.060]  Castro's grandson or Hitler's grandson works for us.
[1:35:03.060 --> 1:35:04.060]  That was a joke.
[1:35:04.060 --> 1:35:05.060]  He was joking.
[1:35:05.060 --> 1:35:06.060]  That was a joke.
[1:35:06.060 --> 1:35:09.060]  Media Matters, your main patron actually did work for Hitler, not me.
[1:35:09.060 --> 1:35:10.060]  Okay.
[1:35:10.060 --> 1:35:12.060]  All right, let's get that straight.
[1:35:12.060 --> 1:35:18.860]  Now, now, but, but, but getting dead serious here.
[1:35:18.860 --> 1:35:23.500]  In 1992, two scientists, you can pull it up, one, the Nobel Prize for Science for a plan
[1:35:23.500 --> 1:35:27.580]  to add aluminum, salts, barium, dioxide and other things to jet fuel, use the jet engines
[1:35:27.580 --> 1:35:32.820]  to aerosolize it and then cause a nuclei in the atmosphere to cause rainstorms.
[1:35:32.820 --> 1:35:35.860]  But they also did other experiments where they thought they would quote block solar
[1:35:35.860 --> 1:35:36.860]  radiation.
[1:35:36.860 --> 1:35:41.500]  What they found is the ultraviolet goes through it, doesn't ever leave the planet because by
[1:35:41.500 --> 1:35:44.500]  the time it goes through and then bounces back up, it stays in the atmosphere.
[1:35:44.500 --> 1:35:45.500]  Okay.
[1:35:45.500 --> 1:35:49.500]  Because you have it going down and then back up, you get twice as much.
[1:35:49.500 --> 1:35:51.380]  Now they claim there's global warming.
[1:35:51.380 --> 1:35:53.660]  They're trying to make the world warm.
[1:35:53.660 --> 1:35:55.700]  It was getting warm for about 70, 80 years.
[1:35:55.700 --> 1:35:58.820]  Now it's been cooling all the studies show and there's all the science on that.
[1:35:58.820 --> 1:36:00.380]  That was the old science to settle.
[1:36:00.380 --> 1:36:01.380]  That's another hoax.
[1:36:01.380 --> 1:36:05.580]  Okay, like saying Trump has, you know, kids in cages and they're dying.
[1:36:05.580 --> 1:36:06.580]  It's not true.
[1:36:06.580 --> 1:36:07.580]  I'm not defending Trump.
[1:36:07.580 --> 1:36:08.980]  I'm defending reality.
[1:36:08.980 --> 1:36:13.060]  But now they've got all these pieces about, in fact, the name of this piece is, how Bill
[1:36:13.060 --> 1:36:17.300]  Gates would save us from climate change with geoengineering.
[1:36:17.300 --> 1:36:21.140]  That's the NBC headline of a 13-minute piece, okay?
[1:36:21.140 --> 1:36:24.060]  How Bill Gates would save us.
[1:36:24.060 --> 1:36:28.940]  Now they've been doing this since 92 when operational worldwide in 1996, it's happening
[1:36:28.940 --> 1:36:33.260]  all over the planet, and we have the full 13 minutes up on infowars.com.
[1:36:33.260 --> 1:36:38.740]  It's also at naturalnews.com, bombshell, global engineering, chemtrails, experiment,
[1:36:38.740 --> 1:36:42.740]  and then it goes on from there, pushed by Bill Gates, also funded by Nazi-linked Alfred
[1:36:42.740 --> 1:36:47.220]  P. Sloan Foundation, linked to eugenics and depopulation.
[1:36:47.220 --> 1:36:49.980]  Now the point is, is that I've hammered this, Eddie's hammered it.
[1:36:49.980 --> 1:36:50.980]  We've all talked about it.
[1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:51.980]  And I love Joe Rogan.
[1:36:51.980 --> 1:36:52.980]  Good friend of mine, great guy.
[1:36:52.980 --> 1:36:53.980]  He'll say, we're crazy.
[1:36:53.980 --> 1:36:54.980]  It doesn't exist.
[1:36:54.980 --> 1:36:58.660]  Because I have 100 textbooks and CFR reports and the CIA director admitting they've been
[1:36:58.660 --> 1:36:59.660]  doing it.
[1:36:59.660 --> 1:37:03.500]  They don't want us discussing it outside of academia, they just go like a little idiot
[1:37:03.500 --> 1:37:04.500]  to kids.
[1:37:04.500 --> 1:37:06.660]  That doesn't exist, Junior.
[1:37:06.660 --> 1:37:08.220]  Electricity doesn't either.
[1:37:08.220 --> 1:37:10.540]  So this is what they're doing.
[1:37:10.540 --> 1:37:12.740]  Save us, save us, Bill Gates.
[1:37:12.740 --> 1:37:16.980]  So let's play a little piece from NBC, here it is.
[1:37:16.980 --> 1:37:22.700]  How long will it be that countries keep experiencing these climate impacts before someone gets
[1:37:22.700 --> 1:37:28.020]  desperate and says, hey, we need to cool the planet with solar geoengineering?
[1:37:28.020 --> 1:37:32.140]  It would look something like this, thousands of planes would fly very high and use nozzles
[1:37:32.140 --> 1:37:36.140]  to inject millions of tons of light-reflecting particles into the stratosphere.
[1:37:36.140 --> 1:37:40.260]  It would create a thin chemical cloud of those particles around the whole planet, blocking
[1:37:40.260 --> 1:37:41.780]  some sunlight from reaching the surface.
[1:37:41.780 --> 1:37:45.460]  It would mimic a giant volcanic eruption, which we know cools the Earth.
[1:37:45.460 --> 1:37:49.860]  So it's a project that's been worldwide since 96, Department of Energy, it's five billion
[1:37:49.860 --> 1:37:50.860]  a year.
[1:37:50.860 --> 1:37:51.860]  They used the word chemtrail.
[1:37:51.860 --> 1:37:52.860]  It's all public.
[1:37:52.860 --> 1:37:56.660]  I mean, I made a film that documents the ceiling, but if you just laugh as it doesn't exist,
[1:37:56.660 --> 1:38:00.700]  I'm going to say the CIA director at betting it when we come back, but my friend, have
[1:38:00.700 --> 1:38:01.700]  we not been vindicated?
[1:38:01.700 --> 1:38:05.820]  It is time for you, the titan, to be released and speak.
[1:38:05.820 --> 1:38:11.380]  It's incredible that even after John Brennan, while he was the director of the CIA, gets
[1:38:11.380 --> 1:38:13.100]  in front of the CFR.
[1:38:13.100 --> 1:38:14.100]  On C-Span.
[1:38:14.100 --> 1:38:15.900]  And you can watch this on YouTube.
[1:38:15.900 --> 1:38:17.500]  You can watch it on YouTube.
[1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:24.500]  And he talks about how the CIA is interested in geoengineering.
[1:38:24.500 --> 1:38:25.500]  Here he is right here.
[1:38:25.500 --> 1:38:29.420]  He admits they've been testing it, but now they're going to go operational.
[1:38:29.420 --> 1:38:34.180]  But he says, but some governments don't like it because we can hurt them with it.
[1:38:34.180 --> 1:38:35.180]  Yeah.
[1:38:35.180 --> 1:38:36.180]  Yeah.
[1:38:36.180 --> 1:38:37.180]  I mean, that's how they do it.
[1:38:37.180 --> 1:38:43.180]  You know, at first, I mean, what are the odds that before John Brennan admitted it, that
[1:38:43.180 --> 1:38:46.900]  they're going to start doing it like you haven't been fucking doing it?
[1:38:46.900 --> 1:38:47.900]  I'm sorry.
[1:38:47.900 --> 1:38:48.900]  I'm sorry.
[1:38:48.900 --> 1:38:49.900]  I'm sorry.
[1:38:49.900 --> 1:38:50.900]  You're going to start doing it.
[1:38:50.900 --> 1:38:59.780]  Yeah, 2016, so three years ago, almost four years.
[1:38:59.780 --> 1:39:03.900]  People still, after he admitted it, people still like, oh, no, it's a...
[1:39:03.900 --> 1:39:04.900]  What about Jonah?
[1:39:04.900 --> 1:39:05.900]  Because you...
[1:39:05.900 --> 1:39:06.900]  Oh, here's my point.
[1:39:06.900 --> 1:39:07.900]  Here's my point.
[1:39:07.900 --> 1:39:17.300]  Before he admitted it, the CIA spraying chemicals in the sky was the craziest tinfoil hat conspiracy.
[1:39:17.300 --> 1:39:18.300]  Before he admitted it.
[1:39:18.300 --> 1:39:23.580]  So that's a tinfoil hat conspiracy that the CIA is spraying the skies.
[1:39:23.580 --> 1:39:26.860]  And then now John Brennan, 2016, gets in front of the...
[1:39:26.860 --> 1:39:27.860]  And now NBC.
[1:39:27.860 --> 1:39:28.860]  No, no, no.
[1:39:28.860 --> 1:39:29.860]  He says, hold on.
[1:39:29.860 --> 1:39:30.860]  Let me finish this.
[1:39:30.860 --> 1:39:33.820]  And then he says, oh, yeah, this is how we're going to save the planet.
[1:39:33.820 --> 1:39:37.740]  We're going to spray the skies to save the planet.
[1:39:37.740 --> 1:39:43.500]  So what are the odds that a crazy tinfoil hat conspiracy is that it turns out to be the
[1:39:43.500 --> 1:39:46.300]  exact plan to save the planet?
[1:39:46.300 --> 1:39:48.300]  What are the odds?
[1:39:48.300 --> 1:39:51.300]  No, they kept it real quick, and they're rolling it out.
[1:39:51.300 --> 1:39:52.300]  It all works out so luckily.
[1:39:52.300 --> 1:39:57.060]  Yeah, it just turns out, you know, that crazy tinfoil hat conspiracy that the CIA is spraying
[1:39:57.060 --> 1:39:58.060]  the skies.
[1:39:58.060 --> 1:39:59.060]  Guess what?
[1:39:59.060 --> 1:40:00.060]  We have to do it.
[1:40:00.060 --> 1:40:02.300]  And I'm not trying to dunk on your best friend, Joe Rogan, but...
[1:40:02.300 --> 1:40:03.300]  Please tell.
[1:40:03.300 --> 1:40:06.540]  But he should have a whole show now, and we should have a discussion.
[1:40:06.540 --> 1:40:09.060]  You know, he's the Johnny Carson of our time.
[1:40:09.060 --> 1:40:10.060]  We should, you know.
[1:40:10.060 --> 1:40:11.060]  He is.
[1:40:11.060 --> 1:40:12.700]  So what does Joe say now?
[1:40:12.700 --> 1:40:14.700]  We can call him up and ask.
[1:40:14.700 --> 1:40:18.700]  I mean, seriously, because I haven't asked him yet, hey, Joe, totally admit it now.
[1:40:18.700 --> 1:40:21.900]  Because when I'm, you know, we're at dinner, he's like, come on, guys, they're not doing
[1:40:21.900 --> 1:40:22.900]  it.
[1:40:22.900 --> 1:40:23.900]  We're like, hey, Joe, let us show you the CFR.
[1:40:23.900 --> 1:40:24.900]  Come on, guys.
[1:40:24.900 --> 1:40:25.900]  Yeah.
[1:40:25.900 --> 1:40:30.140]  He just, you know what, he doesn't want to get involved in conspiracy theories.
[1:40:30.140 --> 1:40:31.140]  I get it.
[1:40:31.140 --> 1:40:34.700]  You know, he's got, you know, he's got his reasons.
[1:40:34.700 --> 1:40:36.260]  He just doesn't want to get involved in it.
[1:40:36.260 --> 1:40:37.260]  Sure.
[1:40:37.260 --> 1:40:41.380]  All I know is aluminum dioxide, barium salts, and radioactive isotopes give you Alzheimer's,
[1:40:41.380 --> 1:40:43.340]  so they better frickin' stop at Bill Gates.
[1:40:43.340 --> 1:40:47.740]  Oh, I forgot, he funded the mosquitoes they released that caused super mutants to rise
[1:40:47.740 --> 1:40:49.340]  that kill you faster in Brazil.
[1:40:49.340 --> 1:40:50.900]  Oh, but it was an accident.
[1:40:50.900 --> 1:40:51.900]  Yeah.
[1:40:51.900 --> 1:40:52.900]  Behind that.
[1:40:52.900 --> 1:40:55.500]  See, you've heard about Dr. Evil or James Bond villains.
[1:40:55.500 --> 1:40:56.900]  He's the real one.
[1:40:56.900 --> 1:40:57.900]  Yeah.
[1:40:57.900 --> 1:40:59.620]  What is up is really down, man.
[1:40:59.620 --> 1:41:02.740]  Every time we think somebody's a good guy, we find out they're really not a good guy.
[1:41:02.740 --> 1:41:03.900]  He's talking about Bill Gates?
[1:41:03.900 --> 1:41:04.900]  Yeah.
[1:41:04.900 --> 1:41:05.900]  He funds all the mosquito releases.
[1:41:05.900 --> 1:41:08.620]  They just mutated in Brazil.
[1:41:08.620 --> 1:41:10.660]  And now they have a super mutant that's basically...
[1:41:10.660 --> 1:41:14.540]  How about that famous speech where he's talking about population control?
[1:41:14.540 --> 1:41:15.540]  That's the subject.
[1:41:15.540 --> 1:41:16.540]  He needs to get humans down to zero?
[1:41:16.540 --> 1:41:22.620]  Yeah, he's talking about population control and how as long as healthcare and the vaccine
[1:41:22.620 --> 1:41:28.980]  programs are instilled that population control is going to...
[1:41:28.980 --> 1:41:29.980]  The plan is going to...
[1:41:29.980 --> 1:41:30.980]  And he shows a graph.
[1:41:30.980 --> 1:41:33.260]  That is a lizard-looking lizard, right?
[1:41:33.260 --> 1:41:35.900]  That's a lizard-looking guy.
[1:41:35.900 --> 1:41:37.140]  He does act like a lizard.
[1:41:37.140 --> 1:41:38.140]  He looks like a lizard.
[1:41:38.140 --> 1:41:39.140]  Kind of sneaks around.
[1:41:39.140 --> 1:41:40.500]  And here's the whole thing about lizards.
[1:41:40.500 --> 1:41:41.740]  They can't concreate, right?
[1:41:41.740 --> 1:41:43.220]  So what do we know about Microsoft?
[1:41:43.220 --> 1:41:45.060]  They jacked their whole system, man.
[1:41:45.060 --> 1:41:46.820]  Same thing with Apple.
[1:41:46.820 --> 1:41:50.820]  They jacked their operating systems because they can't create.
[1:41:50.820 --> 1:41:52.660]  Now they want to kill us all.
[1:41:52.660 --> 1:41:54.900]  I mean, like, dude, it's all...
[1:41:54.900 --> 1:41:57.340]  There's not a bunch of conspiracies.
[1:41:57.340 --> 1:41:59.340]  There's just one big conspiracy.
[1:41:59.340 --> 1:42:01.500]  And they're anti-human building an anti-world.
[1:42:01.500 --> 1:42:02.500]  And now telling us...
[1:42:02.500 --> 1:42:04.500]  Pulled the NBC thing from two weeks ago.
[1:42:04.500 --> 1:42:07.780]  They're like, humans will all be extinct within 100 years.
[1:42:07.780 --> 1:42:09.220]  We're a new alien species.
[1:42:09.220 --> 1:42:10.220]  We're building.
[1:42:10.220 --> 1:42:11.220]  We'll take over.
[1:42:11.220 --> 1:42:14.900]  They're saying they're emerging from machines and we're all dead.
[1:42:14.900 --> 1:42:17.100]  But it's for the environment.
[1:42:17.100 --> 1:42:18.100]  It's unbelievable.
[1:42:18.100 --> 1:42:19.660]  I mean, like, here's the thing.
[1:42:19.660 --> 1:42:22.140]  There's all these money grabs out there, right?
[1:42:22.140 --> 1:42:26.900]  There's, like, NASA, nuclear war, the environment.
[1:42:26.900 --> 1:42:30.460]  These are things that we never tangibly see, but we need to grow money in.
[1:42:30.460 --> 1:42:31.460]  It's growing up.
[1:42:31.460 --> 1:42:32.460]  It's growing up.
[1:42:32.460 --> 1:42:33.460]  It's right there.
[1:42:33.460 --> 1:42:34.460]  We'll all be extinct in one generation.
[1:42:34.460 --> 1:42:35.460]  But it's good for the Earth.
[1:42:35.460 --> 1:42:36.460]  I mean, it's just absolutely insane.
[1:42:36.460 --> 1:42:37.860]  I was behind a paywall.
[1:42:37.860 --> 1:42:39.020]  Print that for me again.
[1:42:39.020 --> 1:42:45.540]  Infowars.com, newswars.com, Sam Tripoli, and Eddie Bravo in studio with us as we broadcast
[1:42:45.540 --> 1:42:46.540]  worldwide.
[1:42:46.540 --> 1:42:52.020]  Whatever you do, don't share those links, don't override AI, don't believe in a human future.
[1:42:52.020 --> 1:42:56.460]  We'll all die, humans.
[1:42:56.460 --> 1:43:02.220]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental
[1:43:02.220 --> 1:43:05.020]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[1:43:05.020 --> 1:43:09.700]  I was the first to warn of human-animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[1:43:09.700 --> 1:43:14.460]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born
[1:43:14.460 --> 1:43:17.060]  for their organs to be harvested.
[1:43:17.060 --> 1:43:22.180]  I was the first to warn you, along with Paul Watson and Infowars.com, 15 years ago that
[1:43:22.180 --> 1:43:27.580]  Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds and
[1:43:27.580 --> 1:43:33.980]  hundreds of other giant issues, like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying
[1:43:33.980 --> 1:43:35.620]  to control our economy.
[1:43:35.620 --> 1:43:39.340]  That our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese on every
[1:43:39.340 --> 1:43:41.860]  one of these issues and many others.
[1:43:41.860 --> 1:43:45.820]  We've been dead on, and we've raised the alarm on a planetary scale.
[1:43:45.820 --> 1:43:50.580]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down, and that's why you are more critical
[1:43:50.580 --> 1:43:52.620]  than ever to support the Infowar.
[1:43:52.620 --> 1:44:20.940]  Please support the Infowar however you can.
[1:44:20.940 --> 1:44:25.980]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer
[1:44:25.980 --> 1:44:28.060]  or Paul Watson band videos.
[1:44:28.060 --> 1:44:33.060]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted, and where a growing
[1:44:33.060 --> 1:44:39.060]  list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free for being shut down, free
[1:44:39.060 --> 1:44:44.100]  for being censored, free for being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood
[1:44:44.100 --> 1:44:46.100]  scum, and the globalist.
[1:44:46.100 --> 1:44:48.100]  Freedom of speech has a home.
[1:44:48.100 --> 1:44:50.380]  It's called band.video.
[1:44:50.380 --> 1:44:56.900]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[1:44:56.900 --> 1:45:01.140]  We sold Secret 12 for four years, and it was our number third best seller.
[1:45:01.140 --> 1:45:05.700]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename
[1:45:05.700 --> 1:45:06.700]  it.
[1:45:06.700 --> 1:45:08.200]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[1:45:08.200 --> 1:45:12.580]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[1:45:12.580 --> 1:45:17.940]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things.
[1:45:17.940 --> 1:45:22.220]  It's healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps
[1:45:22.220 --> 1:45:25.980]  produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, it goes on
[1:45:25.980 --> 1:45:26.980]  and on.
[1:45:26.980 --> 1:45:30.620]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[1:45:30.620 --> 1:45:34.820]  weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[1:45:34.820 --> 1:45:37.220]  Bottom line folks, you need Ultra 12.
[1:45:37.220 --> 1:45:41.940]  It helps something in full war, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time
[1:45:41.940 --> 1:45:43.940]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:45:43.940 --> 1:45:49.580]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[1:45:49.580 --> 1:46:02.820]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at infowarslive.com.
[1:46:02.820 --> 1:46:07.660]  The last week and a half we've been running two specials that are the best deals in our
[1:46:07.660 --> 1:46:08.660]  history.
[1:46:08.660 --> 1:46:12.420]  75% off the Total Gut Health Combo Pack.
[1:46:12.420 --> 1:46:17.780]  It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight different products at over 15% off.
[1:46:17.780 --> 1:46:18.780]  It's incredible.
[1:46:18.780 --> 1:46:23.900]  We also have the Dust Till Dawn InfoWars AMP Impact, which makes it easy to take it
[1:46:23.900 --> 1:46:28.780]  in the morning and take it in the evening, 13 different key capsules that are incredible.
[1:46:28.780 --> 1:46:30.460]  You want to supercharge your life?
[1:46:30.460 --> 1:46:33.500]  This helps you remember to do it, and the results for myself and many others have been
[1:46:33.500 --> 1:46:37.900]  nothing less than astounding, plus you can't beat it, it funds the information war.
[1:46:37.900 --> 1:46:41.500]  You have absolutely nothing to lose, but not taking action.
[1:46:41.500 --> 1:46:47.460]  Believe you, the Deke State, Hillary, Obama, the NWO, they hope you don't support InfoWars
[1:46:47.460 --> 1:46:49.700]  in this urgent moment when they're trying to shut us down.
[1:46:49.700 --> 1:46:52.300]  So we've got a whole bunch of other specials running as well.
[1:46:52.300 --> 1:46:53.300]  Check them out.
[1:46:53.300 --> 1:46:54.300]  They're all about to end.
[1:46:54.300 --> 1:46:55.300]  InfoWarsstore.com.
[1:46:55.300 --> 1:47:25.140]  There are some articles on InfoWars.com that need to get out to people.
[1:47:25.140 --> 1:47:30.940]  But I'm not going to cover them until we hit the next segment.
[1:47:30.940 --> 1:47:33.140]  But one of them is simply amazing.
[1:47:33.140 --> 1:47:36.140]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[1:47:36.140 --> 1:47:40.540]  China is outlawed the Christians, obviously, and they've killed millions of them.
[1:47:40.540 --> 1:47:44.260]  But now they have state run, but instead the Bible is now Mao Zedong quotes.
[1:47:44.260 --> 1:47:45.760]  I'm not kidding.
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:50.500]  The new Bible of Christianity is Mao Zedong and Communist quotes in the Ten Commandments
[1:47:50.500 --> 1:47:51.700]  in all of it.
[1:47:51.700 --> 1:47:57.100]  That is a Kit Daniels article at NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com, and we're going to be getting
[1:47:57.100 --> 1:48:00.620]  to that again coming up, but that needs to get out to everybody.
[1:48:00.620 --> 1:48:01.620]  This is the plan.
[1:48:01.620 --> 1:48:04.540]  But now with the AI computers, they can just come in and, oh, you said somebody's name
[1:48:04.540 --> 1:48:05.540]  we didn't like.
[1:48:05.540 --> 1:48:07.260]  We're going to ban you.
[1:48:07.260 --> 1:48:12.100]  Instagram on my Facebook is now banning photos of people at gun range just claiming they
[1:48:12.100 --> 1:48:13.100]  promote violence.
[1:48:13.100 --> 1:48:14.660]  They're part of a terrorist organization.
[1:48:14.660 --> 1:48:17.340]  See, the Democrats listed the NRA as terrorist.
[1:48:17.340 --> 1:48:19.100]  Well, now the gun owners are terrorists.
[1:48:19.100 --> 1:48:20.100]  This is very serious.
[1:48:20.100 --> 1:48:21.740]  This is moving very, very quickly.
[1:48:21.740 --> 1:48:25.700]  We'll talk about it next hour with Eddie Bravo and Sam Tripoli, co-host of one of the most
[1:48:25.700 --> 1:48:26.900]  popular podcasts out there.
[1:48:26.900 --> 1:48:32.020]  A lot of folks obviously know Eddie from his Jiu Jitsu and UFC and Joe Rogan podcast and
[1:48:32.020 --> 1:48:33.020]  so much more.
[1:48:33.020 --> 1:48:36.460]  You know, Tripoli's been all over national television as a well-known top comic as well.
[1:48:36.460 --> 1:48:41.020]  But let's get back to the geoengineering going on, how it's all out in the open.
[1:48:41.020 --> 1:48:46.780]  Here is the former CIA director three years ago, John Brennan, when he was directing the
[1:48:46.780 --> 1:48:49.580]  CIA, rolling out and going, okay, it's really going on.
[1:48:49.580 --> 1:48:52.180]  We'll talk about some of the problems, all the things we pointed out.
[1:48:52.180 --> 1:48:56.300]  They don't want us debating this, just like Google and Facebook, but there's systems
[1:48:56.300 --> 1:48:57.740]  listening to in your house.
[1:48:57.740 --> 1:49:01.740]  We told you 15 years ago, now they're telling you, but telling you that's the way it is,
[1:49:01.740 --> 1:49:02.740]  get used to it.
[1:49:02.740 --> 1:49:05.540]  So they want to make it ubiquitous, already in, you're already used to it.
[1:49:05.540 --> 1:49:06.540]  You already have a habit.
[1:49:06.540 --> 1:49:08.900]  You're already enslaved, like vaping pins.
[1:49:08.900 --> 1:49:12.060]  Once you're already addicted and they're putting heroin in them, oh yeah, fentanyl, a lot of
[1:49:12.060 --> 1:49:13.060]  them.
[1:49:13.060 --> 1:49:15.340]  Once you're already totally addicted, well, then they tell you it's a problem because
[1:49:15.340 --> 1:49:17.900]  they're going to control it, put you in jail for it.
[1:49:17.900 --> 1:49:22.700]  But let's go ahead and you guys talk over this or pause whenever you want, Eddie and
[1:49:22.700 --> 1:49:23.700]  Sam.
[1:49:23.700 --> 1:49:26.620]  So here's the CIA director admitting they're manipulating the atmosphere.
[1:49:26.620 --> 1:49:28.660]  They're going from testing to operational.
[1:49:28.660 --> 1:49:33.020]  They've really been operational for 15 years, here it is.
[1:49:33.020 --> 1:49:38.700]  Another example is the array of technologies, often referred to collectively as geoengineering,
[1:49:38.700 --> 1:49:43.060]  that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change.
[1:49:43.060 --> 1:49:44.460]  One that has gained my personal attention.
[1:49:44.460 --> 1:49:51.500]  Why is it that, let's start it over here, but understand this is a weapons rollout,
[1:49:51.500 --> 1:49:54.260]  like Star Wars is defensive, no, it's a weapons system.
[1:49:54.260 --> 1:49:58.380]  Oh, now there is weather control, it's to save you from the global warming, but meanwhile
[1:49:58.380 --> 1:49:59.380]  it's really a weapon.
[1:49:59.380 --> 1:50:02.060]  Go ahead and roll it.
[1:50:02.060 --> 1:50:07.740]  Another example is the array of technologies, often referred to collectively as geoengineering,
[1:50:07.740 --> 1:50:12.100]  that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change.
[1:50:12.100 --> 1:50:18.020]  One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI.
[1:50:18.020 --> 1:50:21.980]  A method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's
[1:50:21.980 --> 1:50:26.660]  heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do.
[1:50:26.660 --> 1:50:31.580]  An SAI program could limit global temperature increases, reducing some risks associated
[1:50:31.580 --> 1:50:36.080]  with higher temperatures and providing the world economy additional time to transition
[1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:38.260]  from fossil fuels.
[1:50:38.260 --> 1:50:40.820]  This process is also relatively inexpensive.
[1:50:40.820 --> 1:50:45.580]  The National Research Council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program would cost about
[1:50:45.580 --> 1:50:48.100]  $10 billion yearly.
[1:50:48.100 --> 1:50:50.340]  So far as the test, $5 billion.
[1:50:50.340 --> 1:50:54.780]  Moving forward on SAI would also be a challenge for our government and for the international
[1:50:54.780 --> 1:50:56.180]  community.
[1:50:56.180 --> 1:51:01.060]  On the technical side, greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany SAI
[1:51:01.060 --> 1:51:07.060]  to address other climate change effects, such as ocean acidification, because SAI alone
[1:51:07.060 --> 1:51:09.580]  would not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
[1:51:09.580 --> 1:51:16.500]  On the geopolitical side, the technology's potential to alter weather patterns and benefit
[1:51:16.500 --> 1:51:22.020]  certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp opposition
[1:51:22.020 --> 1:51:24.220]  by some nations.
[1:51:24.220 --> 1:51:28.940]  Others might seize on SAI's benefits and back away from their commitment to carbon dioxide
[1:51:28.940 --> 1:51:29.940]  reductions.
[1:51:29.940 --> 1:51:34.940]  And as with other breakthrough technologies, global norms and standards are lacking to guide
[1:51:34.940 --> 1:51:38.300]  the deployment and implementation of SAI and other fields.
[1:51:38.300 --> 1:51:41.380]  You'll notice how he's trying to sound like super nice when he's saying this.
[1:51:41.380 --> 1:51:45.820]  It's just no big deal, we're secretly controlling the weather, now we can kill everybody, but
[1:51:45.820 --> 1:51:47.860]  you know, we're getting rid of the atmosphere.
[1:51:47.860 --> 1:51:49.060]  We're doing this to protect you.
[1:51:49.060 --> 1:51:51.060]  We're doing it because we love you, Earthlings.
[1:51:51.060 --> 1:51:52.060]  Yeah.
[1:51:52.060 --> 1:51:53.060]  Jesus Christ.
[1:51:53.060 --> 1:51:54.060]  And people still deny it.
[1:51:54.060 --> 1:51:55.060]  And we're on a planet, people still deny it.
[1:51:55.060 --> 1:51:56.060]  Right?
[1:51:56.060 --> 1:51:57.060]  You guys are going to hit us, folks.
[1:51:57.060 --> 1:51:58.060]  You just lost it.
[1:51:58.060 --> 1:51:59.060]  Yeah.
[1:51:59.060 --> 1:52:00.060]  They just admitted.
[1:52:00.060 --> 1:52:01.060]  Well, no.
[1:52:01.060 --> 1:52:04.700]  I mean, the only reason I go with all this is, I don't cover all the kooky stuff and
[1:52:04.700 --> 1:52:08.220]  all the guys that saw UFOs, the government bases and all that made up crap.
[1:52:08.220 --> 1:52:09.220]  It's interdimensional.
[1:52:09.220 --> 1:52:11.300]  It's satanic, like the Bible says.
[1:52:11.300 --> 1:52:15.300]  And they're literally programming humans to build and change the Earth into something
[1:52:15.300 --> 1:52:16.300]  for them.
[1:52:16.300 --> 1:52:17.980]  And then I guess they physically show up after that.
[1:52:17.980 --> 1:52:21.660]  But they went to collaborators, made a deal, and they go, you're going to merge with machines,
[1:52:21.660 --> 1:52:22.660]  you got to kill everybody.
[1:52:22.660 --> 1:52:24.700]  But we'll let a few of you work with us.
[1:52:24.700 --> 1:52:27.460]  If you kill yourselves, you'll become gods.
[1:52:27.460 --> 1:52:29.100]  Don't believe these devils.
[1:52:29.100 --> 1:52:33.300]  Sam, go ahead and read people NBC News telling us we're all dead.
[1:52:33.300 --> 1:52:34.300]  Okay.
[1:52:34.300 --> 1:52:38.260]  This is by James Lovelock, tens of thousands of years.
[1:52:38.260 --> 1:52:41.860]  Humans have reigned as the plant's only intelligent, self-aware species.
[1:52:41.860 --> 1:52:46.340]  But the rise of intelligent machines means that that could change soon, perhaps in our
[1:52:46.340 --> 1:52:47.540]  own lifetime.
[1:52:47.540 --> 1:52:54.220]  Not long after that, Homo sapiens could vanish from Earth entirely, right?
[1:52:54.220 --> 1:52:58.780]  That is the jarring message of a new book by James Lovelock, the famed British environmentalist
[1:52:58.780 --> 1:52:59.780]  and futurist.
[1:52:59.780 --> 1:53:08.580]  The futurist is code for shady, okay, our supremacy as the prime understanders of the cosmos is
[1:53:08.580 --> 1:53:10.940]  rapidly coming to an end, he says in this book.
[1:53:10.940 --> 1:53:15.980]  And all these futurists say, we're scum, we're bad, but the elite is going to merge with
[1:53:15.980 --> 1:53:18.580]  machines and all you die, you'll die now.
[1:53:18.580 --> 1:53:23.580]  And they go, oh, oh, you can't fiddling on now.
[1:53:23.580 --> 1:53:24.580]  Bye-bye.
[1:53:24.580 --> 1:53:25.580]  Oh man.
[1:53:25.580 --> 1:53:30.220]  The Chinese are the Borg dog, you know that, right?
[1:53:30.220 --> 1:53:31.220]  Oh yeah.
[1:53:31.220 --> 1:53:32.220]  The Borg, man.
[1:53:32.220 --> 1:53:37.340]  Everyone always goes, oh, if US and China get into a fight, who's going to win?
[1:53:37.340 --> 1:53:41.500]  Dude, they can't come up with original ideas.
[1:53:41.500 --> 1:53:43.540]  They have to jack everybody's swag.
[1:53:43.540 --> 1:53:45.180]  So we innovate, dude.
[1:53:45.180 --> 1:53:48.260]  So we're going to tell them, oh, we're going to zig and they're going to zig and we'll
[1:53:48.260 --> 1:53:49.260]  zag and we'll take them.
[1:53:49.260 --> 1:53:51.900]  I'm telling you right now, dude, that is their biggest fault.
[1:53:51.900 --> 1:53:53.940]  Well, let's just say, the general, well, they killed people for thousands of years
[1:53:53.940 --> 1:53:55.940]  that did their own deal.
[1:53:55.940 --> 1:54:00.020]  All the smart folks that are independent, they're obviously IQ smart, ran to Hong Kong, Taiwan,
[1:54:00.020 --> 1:54:01.420]  and now China's invading that.
[1:54:01.420 --> 1:54:06.620]  And our media is like, oh good, they have to now kill Taiwan, Hong Kong.
[1:54:06.620 --> 1:54:13.740]  Dude, if you were the story of China with the head of Google in that whole story, dude,
[1:54:13.740 --> 1:54:19.420]  how he created their Apple gave all the code keys two years ago to China and they run everything.
[1:54:19.420 --> 1:54:23.860]  Dude, dude, they created, Google creates the social score.
[1:54:23.860 --> 1:54:24.860]  Right.
[1:54:24.860 --> 1:54:30.700]  And China's so scared of the head of Google, turning on them that they basically poison
[1:54:30.700 --> 1:54:32.100]  him and his kids.
[1:54:32.100 --> 1:54:34.980]  And they're like, either you play ball or else you won't have to poison.
[1:54:34.980 --> 1:54:36.540]  And he's like, I'm playing ball.
[1:54:36.540 --> 1:54:41.820]  One of his daughters passes away and he has to go to like North Korea to get a remedy.
[1:54:41.820 --> 1:54:42.820]  That's all real, dude.
[1:54:42.820 --> 1:54:43.820]  Oh yeah, they don't.
[1:54:43.820 --> 1:54:46.860]  I've heard the Chinese mafia is like killing everybody right now in LA.
[1:54:46.860 --> 1:54:47.860]  It's crazy, dude.
[1:54:47.860 --> 1:54:48.860]  Oh, dude, really?
[1:54:48.860 --> 1:54:49.860]  They're in LA?
[1:54:49.860 --> 1:54:50.860]  Oh yeah.
[1:54:50.860 --> 1:54:51.860]  I don't live in LA.
[1:54:51.860 --> 1:54:52.860]  I moved.
[1:54:52.860 --> 1:54:54.580]  I know it's real, man.
[1:54:54.580 --> 1:54:55.580]  I love China.
[1:54:55.580 --> 1:54:56.580]  Yeah.
[1:54:56.580 --> 1:54:57.580]  I've been to China.
[1:54:57.580 --> 1:54:59.860]  China's pretty cool if you're an outsider.
[1:54:59.860 --> 1:55:03.620]  If you're like, if you're into some weird kind of Buddhism, they kidnap you into a
[1:55:03.620 --> 1:55:06.340]  harvest your organ stock.
[1:55:06.340 --> 1:55:07.340]  I like Bruce Lee.
[1:55:07.340 --> 1:55:08.340]  I do.
[1:55:08.340 --> 1:55:09.340]  I love Bruce Lee.
[1:55:09.340 --> 1:55:10.340]  I don't like what he did.
[1:55:10.340 --> 1:55:11.340]  I love you guys a lot.
[1:55:11.340 --> 1:55:13.340]  But I'm not scared of my papers over there.
[1:55:13.340 --> 1:55:15.340]  I'm going to change the shot.
[1:55:15.340 --> 1:55:16.340]  What's that?
[1:55:16.340 --> 1:55:17.340]  Okay.
[1:55:17.340 --> 1:55:18.340]  I'll keep going.
[1:55:18.340 --> 1:55:19.340]  I like China.
[1:55:19.340 --> 1:55:23.580]  I like most of the Cubs with the World Series at a Cajun restaurant in Beijing.
[1:55:23.580 --> 1:55:24.780]  That's how much I love China.
[1:55:24.780 --> 1:55:25.780]  Okay.
[1:55:25.780 --> 1:55:26.780]  I didn't stand up there.
[1:55:26.780 --> 1:55:27.780]  It was a lot of fun.
[1:55:27.780 --> 1:55:33.860]  But you know what, man, I think there's certain countries, Israel, playing that, Israel, playing
[1:55:33.860 --> 1:55:39.260]  both sides of the ball, playing China and the United States, kind of like in the middle
[1:55:39.260 --> 1:55:43.540]  of World War II, where they play the United States and Europe, whichever wins they come
[1:55:43.540 --> 1:55:44.540]  out on top.
[1:55:44.540 --> 1:55:49.060]  Hey, I got to ask you, why did Israel give China a giant port?
[1:55:49.060 --> 1:55:51.540]  Like I thought this was a religious land.
[1:55:51.540 --> 1:55:55.340]  Why are they giving this group the biggest port in Israel?
[1:55:55.340 --> 1:55:56.340]  No.
[1:55:56.340 --> 1:55:57.340]  I agree.
[1:55:57.340 --> 1:55:58.340]  I think Israel is playing both sides.
[1:55:58.340 --> 1:55:59.340]  I think that's what all the corporations are doing.
[1:55:59.340 --> 1:56:00.340]  That's what's happening.
[1:56:00.340 --> 1:56:01.340]  Yeah.
[1:56:01.340 --> 1:56:02.340]  I mean, dude, and they're just going to leave us.
[1:56:02.340 --> 1:56:03.340]  It goes back.
[1:56:03.340 --> 1:56:05.180]  It's horrible, dude.
[1:56:05.180 --> 1:56:09.660]  It's really bad that we paid for everything, and now it's going to be used against us.
[1:56:09.660 --> 1:56:15.460]  Well, China, the C.F.R., the globalist admit, is positioned to get rid of all of us.
[1:56:15.460 --> 1:56:20.580]  And they're killing their own people, 115 of their own people, 115 million.
[1:56:20.580 --> 1:56:24.340]  And the New York Times, last week, came out and praised China and said, it's the model
[1:56:24.340 --> 1:56:25.540]  that's so wonderful.
[1:56:25.540 --> 1:56:27.380]  And Mao Zedong was a great guy.
[1:56:27.380 --> 1:56:31.460]  He personally had killed triple what Hitler did.
[1:56:31.460 --> 1:56:32.460]  Yeah.
[1:56:32.460 --> 1:56:34.260]  Then there's that guy that went into Africa.
[1:56:34.260 --> 1:56:35.260]  What's his name?
[1:56:35.260 --> 1:56:36.260]  But don't say it bad.
[1:56:36.260 --> 1:56:37.260]  Let's rock on.
[1:56:37.260 --> 1:56:39.260]  You do all your races.
[1:56:39.260 --> 1:56:44.100]  Oh, man, oh, man, you are never going to be on Saturday Night Live, bro.
[1:56:44.100 --> 1:56:45.980]  Hey, you're going to be on Saturday Night Live.
[1:56:45.980 --> 1:56:46.980]  You guys want to hear?
[1:56:46.980 --> 1:56:47.980]  I love it.
[1:56:47.980 --> 1:56:51.860]  Al Jones has been fired from the cast of Saturday Night Live this year.
[1:56:51.860 --> 1:56:54.260]  Did you know we come back in just two minutes, two minute break?
[1:56:54.260 --> 1:56:59.740]  I'm actually playing an official director from ZZ Ping, and by the way, Great League
[1:56:59.740 --> 1:57:01.780]  4 was only one project.
[1:57:01.780 --> 1:57:06.460]  The Cultural Revolution estimated to kill 86 million the Chinese, say, oh my god.
[1:57:06.460 --> 1:57:08.260]  How are they killing all these millions?
[1:57:08.260 --> 1:57:09.260]  That's a lot of millions.
[1:57:09.260 --> 1:57:10.260]  What do they do?
[1:57:10.260 --> 1:57:11.260]  Stop YouTube there.
[1:57:11.260 --> 1:57:12.260]  Is that what they do?
[1:57:12.260 --> 1:57:14.180]  It's okay, Tony.
[1:57:14.180 --> 1:57:20.940]  We come in this Chinese, we kill all our people, we race this, we stop it, we kill you, man.
[1:57:20.940 --> 1:57:21.940]  I can't give any.
[1:57:21.940 --> 1:57:22.940]  What do you do?
[1:57:22.940 --> 1:57:24.940]  The Jimmy O. School of Acting with that?
[1:57:24.940 --> 1:57:25.940]  Hold on.
[1:57:25.940 --> 1:57:26.940]  That's hilarious.
[1:57:26.940 --> 1:57:32.380]  I actually have a message from the Communist Chinese when we come back, infowars.com,
[1:57:32.380 --> 1:57:33.380]  band.video.
[1:57:33.380 --> 1:57:34.380]  A lot of these are band.video.
[1:57:34.380 --> 1:57:36.020]  They're like, they're not on the air anymore.
[1:57:36.020 --> 1:57:37.020]  The hell we aren't.
[1:57:37.020 --> 1:57:38.020]  We're blasting out on them.
[1:57:38.020 --> 1:57:39.020]  I'm sorry.
[1:57:39.020 --> 1:57:42.220]  You should do a split screen of like you.
[1:57:42.220 --> 1:57:46.260]  You dressed up as like a Chinese.
[1:57:46.260 --> 1:57:50.780]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[1:57:50.780 --> 1:57:56.500]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at infowars, and we are the individuals
[1:57:56.500 --> 1:57:59.780]  that have done the research to understand the global spattle plan, and we know how to
[1:57:59.780 --> 1:58:00.780]  take them down.
[1:58:00.780 --> 1:58:02.540]  That's why they're so upset.
[1:58:02.540 --> 1:58:04.820]  Think how far we've come together.
[1:58:04.820 --> 1:58:08.060]  Even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on, because it's the right thing
[1:58:08.060 --> 1:58:13.340]  to do against the truly satanic forces of the new world order who've really taken the
[1:58:13.340 --> 1:58:18.780]  mask off, the lines in the sand for everybody now, but you'd already chosen to fight the
[1:58:18.780 --> 1:58:21.540]  corruption and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[1:58:21.540 --> 1:58:25.900]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience, because you are truly
[1:58:25.900 --> 1:58:30.300]  activist in the arena, and without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your
[1:58:30.300 --> 1:58:35.380]  financial support, this operation that you built, that your operation would not be here.
[1:58:35.380 --> 1:58:38.380]  We've got some giant specials running right now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:58:38.380 --> 1:58:41.460]  A lot of items, 50% off.

[1:58:49.460 --> 1:58:50.460]  Alex, God bless you.
[1:58:50.460 --> 1:58:55.100]  I have an idea for a new info wars t-shirt instead of, this is your brain, this is your
[1:58:55.100 --> 1:59:00.660]  brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G, showing your brain getting
[1:59:00.660 --> 1:59:01.660]  frat.
[1:59:01.660 --> 1:59:02.980]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[1:59:02.980 --> 1:59:07.860]  Cool, it changed my life, I use turbo force, bodies, alpha power, brain force, fish oil,
[1:59:07.860 --> 1:59:10.340]  ultra 12 daily, X2 every several days.
[1:59:10.340 --> 1:59:16.660]  Now what I've found is really combining them is totally synergistic and transcendent feeling
[1:59:16.660 --> 1:59:19.780]  that I get by combining all your products, and I just want to urge all your listeners
[1:59:19.780 --> 1:59:21.780]  who haven't tried them, I just want to say why not.
[1:59:21.780 --> 1:59:25.740]  Well you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric
[1:59:25.740 --> 1:59:29.340]  or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the
[1:59:29.340 --> 1:59:32.980]  coque U10 and bio-piqui Q and all the rest of it, all of these are things that are like
[1:59:32.980 --> 1:59:37.420]  rocket fuel in the body, you take these bases together, then you have your foundation, now
[1:59:37.420 --> 1:59:39.260]  you can build the big strong temple.
[1:59:39.260 --> 1:59:42.580]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so
[1:59:42.580 --> 1:59:46.060]  much better, and then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[1:59:46.060 --> 1:59:50.180]  Thank you so much, God bless you.
[1:59:50.180 --> 2:00:03.500]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:03.500 --> 2:00:22.140]  We've got a message from the Chinese dictator, President Xi Zhongdong, and he is a message
[2:00:22.140 --> 2:00:26.380]  when he turn off his cloaking device and show you his true form.
[2:00:26.380 --> 2:00:35.180]  Here it is, well the chosen one, attention American pigs, China is in control of your
[2:00:35.180 --> 2:00:42.860]  country now, we own Hollywood, we own your debt, and we owe Harvard and the Democratic
[2:00:42.860 --> 2:00:51.340]  Party, we have all your military courts, and we make 90% of your drugs if we call that,
[2:00:51.340 --> 2:01:12.980]  take your vaccines, enjoy your cancer, I'm going to do it, so take your fentanyl and
[2:01:12.980 --> 2:01:22.260]  your tainted vaccines, and your melamine and your baby formula we make for you, and die,
[2:01:22.260 --> 2:01:28.060]  and don't fight back or the media will call your names, and you don't want that, shut
[2:01:28.060 --> 2:01:37.660]  up and do what we tell you, shut up and die, and get rid of Trump and Alex Jones, you are
[2:01:37.660 --> 2:01:39.660]  not going to beat us.
[2:01:39.660 --> 2:01:45.780]  Dude, that was amazing.
[2:01:45.780 --> 2:01:46.780]  You can do that every show.
[2:01:46.780 --> 2:01:51.020]  Man, you should do voiceovers, bro, I think you'd be in the next track.
[2:01:51.020 --> 2:01:53.060]  I've got pretty big voiceovers.
[2:01:53.060 --> 2:01:54.060]  You do.
[2:01:54.060 --> 2:01:59.660]  But as soon as I, when I was bashing Obama and stuff, then they stopped giving me the
[2:01:59.660 --> 2:02:01.980]  work, but I've done pretty big voiceovers.
[2:02:01.980 --> 2:02:04.420]  I know man, you're my favorite voiceover actor.
[2:02:04.420 --> 2:02:07.820]  No, you guys are awesome, but seriously, enough about me, this is a short statement,
[2:02:07.820 --> 2:02:09.820]  this is a long statement coming up in only one minute break.
[2:02:09.820 --> 2:02:10.820]  Oh, snacks.
[2:02:10.820 --> 2:02:11.820]  What all do we say we get through this hour?
[2:02:11.820 --> 2:02:15.300]  This is a bunch of stuff I said, oh, Jeffrey Epstein next segment.
[2:02:15.300 --> 2:02:16.300]  What else?
[2:02:16.300 --> 2:02:19.300]  Jeffrey Epstein, Ed Bach will get into that.
[2:02:19.300 --> 2:02:24.820]  Oh, Jeffrey Epstein, stop, I said, well, I won't come on in Jeffrey Epstein.
[2:02:24.820 --> 2:02:27.380]  Have you ever heard about the Finders?
[2:02:27.380 --> 2:02:29.380]  You ever heard about the Finders, man?
[2:02:29.380 --> 2:02:35.420]  Oh, black and white people, they're connections to China, you ever hear about that?
[2:02:35.420 --> 2:02:36.700]  I do know about that.
[2:02:36.700 --> 2:02:37.700]  Yeah.
[2:02:37.700 --> 2:02:41.900]  I mean, there's some kids saw this, I mean, and then they just ended that case just like
[2:02:41.900 --> 2:02:42.900]  that.
[2:02:42.900 --> 2:02:43.900]  They have to be someone to get fresh organ.
[2:02:43.900 --> 2:02:45.900]  What's your thoughts on the NYPD?
[2:02:45.900 --> 2:02:50.820]  No, MSG in organ, silenced.
[2:02:50.820 --> 2:02:56.820]  The NYPD, Anthony Weiner, Glabtop and all the suicide, do you think they're, they're
[2:02:56.820 --> 2:02:57.820]  interconnected?
[2:02:57.820 --> 2:02:59.620]  Oh, it's all, it's all a big blackmail ring.
[2:02:59.620 --> 2:03:01.940]  That was, I'll tell you, I mean, but I want to, I'll tell you what's wrong, I mean, I
[2:03:01.940 --> 2:03:02.940]  know it's one of them.
[2:03:02.940 --> 2:03:03.940]  Let me, let me, let me hear it.
[2:03:03.940 --> 2:03:05.340]  Well, I'm going to, but you are the guest.
[2:03:05.340 --> 2:03:06.340]  I want to hear it.
[2:03:06.340 --> 2:03:07.340]  I want to hear it.
[2:03:07.340 --> 2:03:08.340]  I want to hear it.
[2:03:08.340 --> 2:03:09.340]  You are the Eddie Bravo.
[2:03:09.340 --> 2:03:11.340]  After we hit Epstein next, what else do you want to get into?
[2:03:11.340 --> 2:03:17.220]  Um, but any, if you hear about the White House announcement, what it's on info wars.com
[2:03:17.220 --> 2:03:18.220]  and the White House petitions.
[2:03:18.220 --> 2:03:21.100]  I'm not going to talk about it until we come back, but it's big.
[2:03:21.100 --> 2:03:25.580]  They have announced that there is a petition and the White House, the president looking
[2:03:25.580 --> 2:03:29.380]  at it to announce a 51st state.
[2:03:29.380 --> 2:03:30.780]  Guess what the 51st state is?
[2:03:30.780 --> 2:03:32.220]  We're not going to tell people yet.
[2:03:32.220 --> 2:03:35.100]  The 51st state, ladies and gentlemen, this is not a joke.
[2:03:35.100 --> 2:03:37.100]  This is a real proposal.
[2:03:37.100 --> 2:03:39.100]  You thought Trump wanted Greenland.
[2:03:39.100 --> 2:03:41.100]  Oh, it's Americans.
[2:03:41.100 --> 2:03:45.100]  See, we got to think big here.
[2:03:45.100 --> 2:03:47.100]  The moon.
[2:03:47.100 --> 2:03:49.100]  How does you guess it?
[2:03:49.100 --> 2:03:51.100]  I saw one of your notes here.
[2:03:51.100 --> 2:03:53.100]  American spy.
[2:03:53.100 --> 2:03:55.100]  American spy.
[2:03:55.100 --> 2:03:57.100]  Oh, really?
[2:03:57.100 --> 2:03:59.100]  That real.
[2:03:59.100 --> 2:04:01.100]  It's real.
[2:04:01.100 --> 2:04:03.100]  Go click on the link.
[2:04:03.100 --> 2:04:05.100]  Who's idea is this?
[2:04:05.100 --> 2:04:07.100]  Mine.
[2:04:07.100 --> 2:04:09.100]  Oh, it is?
[2:04:09.100 --> 2:04:11.100]  Okay.
[2:04:11.100 --> 2:04:13.100]  Anyways, you got to think big here.
[2:04:13.100 --> 2:04:15.100]  I'm an admiral in Space Force.
[2:04:15.100 --> 2:04:17.100]  That's cool.
[2:04:17.100 --> 2:04:21.100]  He's got a great bit about Space Force.
[2:04:21.100 --> 2:04:23.100]  We're going to go to break.
[2:04:23.100 --> 2:04:25.100]  I want to hear about Space Force when we come back.
[2:04:25.100 --> 2:04:27.100]  You want to do your best.
[2:04:27.100 --> 2:04:29.100]  Is it family friendly?
[2:04:29.100 --> 2:04:31.100]  I mean, it's some of it.
[2:04:31.100 --> 2:04:33.100]  One night only, Austin, Texas.
[2:04:33.100 --> 2:04:35.100]  We're going to have a show with Eddie Bravo
[2:04:35.100 --> 2:04:37.100]  and Sam Tripoli.
[2:04:37.100 --> 2:04:39.100]  One night only.
[2:04:39.100 --> 2:04:41.100]  Fine tickets about their Twitter accounts.

[2:04:43.100 --> 2:04:45.100]  And will I be there?
[2:04:45.100 --> 2:04:47.100]  Well, my wife's trying to go look at Brad Pitt
[2:04:47.100 --> 2:04:49.100]  in that new Space Man movie.
[2:04:49.100 --> 2:04:51.100]  And I'm an actual admiral in Space Force.
[2:04:51.100 --> 2:04:53.100]  I don't want to see a phony, but I still may.
[2:04:53.100 --> 2:04:55.100]  Go to the shuttle mart instead of watching Brad Pitt.
[2:04:55.100 --> 2:04:57.100]  Happy's is a tincture that you take under the tongue.

[2:06:41.100 --> 2:06:43.100]  All right, let's get into this shirt
[2:06:43.100 --> 2:06:45.100]  before I hit the really hardcore stuff on Epstein.
[2:06:45.100 --> 2:06:47.100]  What is combat jiu-jitsu?
[2:06:47.100 --> 2:06:49.100]  It's a show.
[2:06:49.100 --> 2:06:51.100]  It's a new form of jiu-jitsu
[2:06:51.100 --> 2:06:53.100]  with it's in between MMA
[2:06:53.100 --> 2:06:55.100]  and grappling,
[2:06:55.100 --> 2:06:57.100]  where we have
[2:06:57.100 --> 2:06:59.100]  it's jiu-jitsu with strikes
[2:06:59.100 --> 2:07:01.100]  on the ground, legal.
[2:07:01.100 --> 2:07:03.100]  Standing, it's still wrestling, but on the ground
[2:07:03.100 --> 2:07:05.100]  you could knock each other out
[2:07:05.100 --> 2:07:07.100]  and do jiu-jitsu.
[2:07:07.100 --> 2:07:09.100]  So it's like a hybrid.
[2:07:09.100 --> 2:07:11.100]  So the ground you could punch somebody?
[2:07:11.100 --> 2:07:13.100]  You could palm strike them.
[2:07:13.100 --> 2:07:15.100]  So it's jiu-jitsu.
[2:07:15.100 --> 2:07:17.100]  Most jiu-jitsu, there's no strikes at all.
[2:07:17.100 --> 2:07:19.100]  It's just, you know, you're just trying to...
[2:07:19.100 --> 2:07:21.100]  Yeah.
[2:07:21.100 --> 2:07:23.100]  Combat jiu-jitsu worlds.

[2:07:31.100 --> 2:07:33.100]  is going to be the star of that show.
[2:07:33.100 --> 2:07:35.100]  And we got
[2:07:35.100 --> 2:07:37.100]  Dan Martinez.
[2:07:37.100 --> 2:07:39.100]  We got former UFC fighter
[2:07:39.100 --> 2:07:41.100]  Jesse Taylor.
[2:07:41.100 --> 2:07:43.100]  Josh Nier.
[2:07:43.100 --> 2:07:45.100]  It's going to be insane.
[2:07:45.100 --> 2:07:47.100]  Philippa Fogelin.
[2:07:47.100 --> 2:07:49.100]  I'm going to pass.
[2:07:49.100 --> 2:07:51.100]  I want to get into
[2:07:51.100 --> 2:07:53.100]  some Joe Rogan stuff here, but...
[2:07:53.100 --> 2:07:55.100]  And I love Joe to death,
[2:07:55.100 --> 2:07:57.100]  even though Jesus told me to destroy him. I'm joking.
[2:07:57.100 --> 2:07:59.100]  I was in like two bottles of tequila at that point, folks.
[2:07:59.100 --> 2:08:01.100]  I met it physically.
[2:08:01.100 --> 2:08:03.100]  But no, seriously. I don't even drink anymore, though.
[2:08:03.100 --> 2:08:05.100]  Total teetotaler.
[2:08:05.100 --> 2:08:07.100]  That's insane.
[2:08:07.100 --> 2:08:09.100]  Good stuff.
[2:08:09.100 --> 2:08:11.100]  But seriously, Joe Handsdown
[2:08:11.100 --> 2:08:13.100]  has the biggest
[2:08:13.100 --> 2:08:15.100]  online,
[2:08:15.100 --> 2:08:17.100]  personal broadcast show in the world now,
[2:08:17.100 --> 2:08:19.100]  consistently.
[2:08:19.100 --> 2:08:21.100]  And you've seen the left kind of come in and bully him
[2:08:21.100 --> 2:08:23.100]  and take control of the show.
[2:08:23.100 --> 2:08:25.100]  I don't think Joe has given into that.
[2:08:25.100 --> 2:08:27.100]  I don't want to say he's even on mainline,
[2:08:27.100 --> 2:08:29.100]  but he has a wide range of people on.
[2:08:29.100 --> 2:08:31.100]  The establishment does not like that,
[2:08:31.100 --> 2:08:33.100]  because I know Joe does call the shots,
[2:08:33.100 --> 2:08:35.100]  and anything else of that size
[2:08:35.100 --> 2:08:37.100]  that calls the shots either gets taken over
[2:08:37.100 --> 2:08:39.100]  or shut down. I know because
[2:08:39.100 --> 2:08:41.100]  we were number one in 2016.
[2:08:41.100 --> 2:08:43.100]  Then they shadow-banded us. Then they totally banded us.
[2:08:43.100 --> 2:08:45.100]  They say you can't even say our name in a positive way
[2:08:45.100 --> 2:08:47.100]  on Facebook. And now they're doing it to the NRA
[2:08:47.100 --> 2:08:49.100]  and gun owners, saying the NRA is a terror group.
[2:08:49.100 --> 2:08:51.100]  And now Facebook says you can't show guns
[2:08:51.100 --> 2:08:53.100]  in a positive light to our own reporter,
[2:08:53.100 --> 2:08:55.100]  but now it's pouring in other people. This is so dangerous.
[2:08:55.100 --> 2:08:57.100]  So I think if anybody could unionize, folks,
[2:08:57.100 --> 2:08:59.100]  just somebody like Joe, and I've warned him,
[2:08:59.100 --> 2:09:01.100]  and I've said it on air, we better
[2:09:01.100 --> 2:09:03.100]  get top people together to say no to this,
[2:09:03.100 --> 2:09:05.100]  because this isn't about private companies.
[2:09:05.100 --> 2:09:07.100]  This is about them going in and saying,
[2:09:07.100 --> 2:09:09.100]  we won't let you show a gun or a woman with a gun
[2:09:09.100 --> 2:09:11.100]  in a positive light.
[2:09:11.100 --> 2:09:13.100]  We're going to be in cult.
[2:09:13.100 --> 2:09:15.100]  People should learn the history of guns.
[2:09:15.100 --> 2:09:17.100]  I think nobody
[2:09:17.100 --> 2:09:19.100]  really knows the history of guns.
[2:09:19.100 --> 2:09:21.100]  I've seen people,
[2:09:21.100 --> 2:09:23.100]  friends of mine,
[2:09:23.100 --> 2:09:25.100]  people who are Jewish, people who are
[2:09:25.100 --> 2:09:27.100]  women, people who are gays,
[2:09:27.100 --> 2:09:29.100]  and they all talk about
[2:09:29.100 --> 2:09:31.100]  gun control.
[2:09:31.100 --> 2:09:33.100]  And they must not know their own history,
[2:09:33.100 --> 2:09:35.100]  because if they learn their own history,
[2:09:35.100 --> 2:09:37.100]  they would know that every time guns
[2:09:37.100 --> 2:09:39.100]  are taken away, mass genocide happens,
[2:09:39.100 --> 2:09:41.100]  followed by the marginalizations
[2:09:41.100 --> 2:09:43.100]  and the dehumanization
[2:09:43.100 --> 2:09:45.100]  of women, gays, and ethnic minorities.
[2:09:45.100 --> 2:09:47.100]  These are just facts.
[2:09:47.100 --> 2:09:49.100]  These are the facts.
[2:09:49.100 --> 2:09:51.100]  Gun control and gun rights
[2:09:51.100 --> 2:09:53.100]  is the most important issue
[2:09:53.100 --> 2:09:55.100]  in our time right now.
[2:09:55.100 --> 2:09:57.100]  Once those go,
[2:09:57.100 --> 2:09:59.100]  the facade of
[2:09:59.100 --> 2:10:01.100]  freedom and freedom of choice
[2:10:01.100 --> 2:10:03.100]  disintegrates.
[2:10:03.100 --> 2:10:05.100]  Take a look at Europe, take a look at what's going on
[2:10:05.100 --> 2:10:07.100]  in the Middle East, all these different places
[2:10:07.100 --> 2:10:09.100]  where guns aren't allowed
[2:10:09.100 --> 2:10:11.100]  and see how the government treats their people.
[2:10:11.100 --> 2:10:13.100]  Europe has a way higher crime rates than us.
[2:10:13.100 --> 2:10:15.100]  They didn't use to.
[2:10:15.100 --> 2:10:17.100]  All these places like Mexico that took the guns,
[2:10:17.100 --> 2:10:19.100]  their crime rates explode, only criminals in government
[2:10:19.100 --> 2:10:21.100]  have guns.
[2:10:21.100 --> 2:10:23.100]  But notice how they're going after the guns,
[2:10:23.100 --> 2:10:25.100]  while they're going after the speech, and now the
[2:10:25.100 --> 2:10:27.100]  supposed historical left that says it defends speech,
[2:10:27.100 --> 2:10:29.100]  they're the executioners of speech. Bravo.
[2:10:29.100 --> 2:10:31.100]  Yeah, when I grew up, I thought
[2:10:31.100 --> 2:10:33.100]  being Democrat and being a progressive
[2:10:33.100 --> 2:10:35.100]  and a liberal was
[2:10:35.100 --> 2:10:37.100]  the right thing to do. And I thought
[2:10:37.100 --> 2:10:39.100]  Republicans and the conservatives
[2:10:39.100 --> 2:10:41.100]  preaching Jesus
[2:10:41.100 --> 2:10:43.100]  and family values
[2:10:43.100 --> 2:10:45.100]  and all that stuff. I was like, screw that.
[2:10:45.100 --> 2:10:47.100]  I'm going to go out and get laid
[2:10:47.100 --> 2:10:49.100]  and get hammered and get drunk.
[2:10:49.100 --> 2:10:51.100]  Now, the older you get
[2:10:51.100 --> 2:10:53.100]  and when you start having kids, you start
[2:10:53.100 --> 2:10:55.100]  I'm not Republican or Democrat, but
[2:10:55.100 --> 2:10:57.100]  you put a gun to my head, I'm a Republican.
[2:10:57.100 --> 2:10:59.100]  But
[2:10:59.100 --> 2:11:01.100]  because the way things are going, the left is so loony.
[2:11:01.100 --> 2:11:03.100]  Well, it's like
[2:11:03.100 --> 2:11:05.100]  it's like they're trying to get fired. It's like, how do we
[2:11:05.100 --> 2:11:07.100]  how do we destroy the game?
[2:11:07.100 --> 2:11:09.100]  They're trying to take over what's happening.
[2:11:09.100 --> 2:11:11.100]  No, the DNC is throwing the game.
[2:11:11.100 --> 2:11:13.100]  That's what they're doing. They're throwing the game.
[2:11:13.100 --> 2:11:15.100]  Listen, man.
[2:11:15.100 --> 2:11:17.100]  But I think for a future revolution, though, that they really believe this stuff.
[2:11:17.100 --> 2:11:19.100]  Well, because they're paid
[2:11:19.100 --> 2:11:21.100]  to believe it. They're not. Listen,
[2:11:21.100 --> 2:11:23.100]  I'm a liberal, okay? But I'm an old
[2:11:23.100 --> 2:11:25.100]  school liberal and I guarantee you, if we sat down
[2:11:25.100 --> 2:11:27.100]  Alex, you'd be an old school liberal.
[2:11:27.100 --> 2:11:29.100]  You're like, live and let die.
[2:11:29.100 --> 2:11:31.100]  Express yourself. Love yourself.
[2:11:31.100 --> 2:11:33.100]  You do you. I do me.
[2:11:33.100 --> 2:11:35.100]  As long as you don't hurt children, women
[2:11:35.100 --> 2:11:37.100]  and others will be fine.
[2:11:37.100 --> 2:11:39.100]  Don't steal from people. This new like
[2:11:39.100 --> 2:11:41.100]  like progressivism
[2:11:41.100 --> 2:11:43.100]  leftism,
[2:11:43.100 --> 2:11:45.100]  social justice war that these are all
[2:11:45.100 --> 2:11:47.100]  psyops being portrayed to
[2:11:47.100 --> 2:11:49.100]  destroy people who
[2:11:49.100 --> 2:11:51.100]  question the status quo. This stuff
[2:11:51.100 --> 2:11:53.100]  you think AOC and all those idiots know that
[2:11:53.100 --> 2:11:55.100]  they're all psyops, bro.
[2:11:55.100 --> 2:11:57.100]  This is done on purpose.
[2:11:57.100 --> 2:11:59.100]  You don't go anywhere going 70
[2:11:59.100 --> 2:12:01.100]  percent tax if you're not
[2:12:01.100 --> 2:12:03.100]  told to say that. It is all
[2:12:03.100 --> 2:12:05.100]  being done. Look what happened in the
[2:12:05.100 --> 2:12:07.100]  60s and 70s with drugs
[2:12:07.100 --> 2:12:09.100]  that was all done by the CIA.
[2:12:09.100 --> 2:12:11.100]  They're done to create that. They put LSD on the streets.
[2:12:11.100 --> 2:12:13.100]  Yeah, and then they use Charles
[2:12:13.100 --> 2:12:15.100]  Manson and Jonestown to
[2:12:15.100 --> 2:12:17.100]  demonize liberalism. Oh,
[2:12:17.100 --> 2:12:19.100]  look what happens. What came in
[2:12:19.100 --> 2:12:21.100]  the 80s with like greed
[2:12:21.100 --> 2:12:23.100]  and everyone's doing blow and all
[2:12:23.100 --> 2:12:25.100]  they like this of these hardcore like
[2:12:25.100 --> 2:12:27.100]  serious like got to be serious
[2:12:27.100 --> 2:12:29.100]  about everything. It's all
[2:12:29.100 --> 2:12:31.100]  psychological war on us right now.
[2:12:31.100 --> 2:12:33.100]  These people aren't liberals.
[2:12:33.100 --> 2:12:35.100]  Dude, if you want war
[2:12:35.100 --> 2:12:37.100]  you're not a liberal. I was about to say though
[2:12:37.100 --> 2:12:39.100]  what's happened to the average liberal or leftist
[2:12:39.100 --> 2:12:41.100]  in the streets like a piranha demon.
[2:12:41.100 --> 2:12:43.100]  Yeah, well conspiracy
[2:12:43.100 --> 2:12:45.100]  theorists, we do it too. Like, dude, how
[2:12:45.100 --> 2:12:47.100]  many times you get called a shill? How many times
[2:12:47.100 --> 2:12:49.100]  I get called a shill? If you don't see the
[2:12:49.100 --> 2:12:51.100]  exact way the other person sees it,
[2:12:51.100 --> 2:12:53.100]  you're a shill, you're a sell-out, okay?
[2:12:53.100 --> 2:12:55.100]  Well, that's just people that do that so they can feel
[2:12:55.100 --> 2:12:57.100]  more powerful. But that anybody who's
[2:12:57.100 --> 2:12:59.100]  real is just covering issues and then you control.
[2:12:59.100 --> 2:13:01.100]  It doesn't mean you're, you know, you're going to be somebody else's
[2:13:01.100 --> 2:13:03.100]  perfect view. Right?
[2:13:03.100 --> 2:13:05.100]  I can guarantee you, I'm not a shill and I'm
[2:13:05.100 --> 2:13:07.100]  not Bill Hicks and there's not anybody
[2:13:07.100 --> 2:13:09.100]  paying my paychecks. Nobody's paying my paychecks
[2:13:09.100 --> 2:13:11.100]  with the listeners. They buy the products.
[2:13:11.100 --> 2:13:13.100]  That's how we stay on the air. Oh, this is the problem with the whole
[2:13:13.100 --> 2:13:15.100]  thing with the Shane Gillis thing. It's not
[2:13:15.100 --> 2:13:17.100]  only that, they don't want you saying it,
[2:13:17.100 --> 2:13:19.100]  but even if you do it in this special
[2:13:19.100 --> 2:13:21.100]  place where you gotta go find it, they hate that too.
[2:13:21.100 --> 2:13:23.100]  So they're going, let's say you're like I
[2:13:23.100 --> 2:13:25.100]  hired Hitler, right? Or Hitler works for me
[2:13:25.100 --> 2:13:27.100]  lying, that line, right? They'll isolate
[2:13:27.100 --> 2:13:29.100]  that and then they'll play it like that's
[2:13:29.100 --> 2:13:31.100]  your whole show. Like, dude,
[2:13:31.100 --> 2:13:33.100]  that's one of the many things you might say
[2:13:33.100 --> 2:13:35.100]  because it was connected to Fidel Castro's
[2:13:35.100 --> 2:13:37.100]  grandson works. Right, but they won't play that.
[2:13:37.100 --> 2:13:39.100]  They won't play that. They'll isolate
[2:13:39.100 --> 2:13:41.100]  it and then they'll act like this is the worst thing ever
[2:13:41.100 --> 2:13:43.100]  said. And it's like, you can't even do it on
[2:13:43.100 --> 2:13:45.100]  your own peer-to-peer where people,
[2:13:45.100 --> 2:13:47.100]  I like, dude, I do, I do a show on Legion of
[2:13:47.100 --> 2:13:49.100]  Skanks. I mean, I do a festival
[2:13:49.100 --> 2:13:51.100]  that the Legion of Skanks people do. They got mad
[2:13:51.100 --> 2:13:53.100]  at a show on Legion of Skanks
[2:13:53.100 --> 2:13:55.100]  God, said some crazy stuff.
[2:13:55.100 --> 2:13:57.100]  It's Legion of Skanks. Like, why are you
[2:13:57.100 --> 2:13:59.100]  bringing your... You can't even let your own private thing
[2:13:59.100 --> 2:14:01.100]  do something. Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's not
[2:14:01.100 --> 2:14:03.100]  for you. Like, I hate the
[2:14:03.100 --> 2:14:05.100]  view. The view is the worst show ever
[2:14:05.100 --> 2:14:07.100]  but they can do that. It's not for me.
[2:14:07.100 --> 2:14:09.100]  So I should get them off
[2:14:09.100 --> 2:14:11.100]  the air. No, you just don't watch what you don't
[2:14:11.100 --> 2:14:13.100]  like. Yeah, it's like, let it go.
[2:14:13.100 --> 2:14:15.100]  Let people do their own thing. And I tell you, the view
[2:14:15.100 --> 2:14:17.100]  is the stupidest show on the planet. It's the worst.
[2:14:17.100 --> 2:14:19.100]  I mean, if you wanted to torture me, like the
[2:14:19.100 --> 2:14:21.100]  CIA, like skinny puppy, to people
[2:14:21.100 --> 2:14:23.100]  at Camp X-ray, don't... I want to
[2:14:23.100 --> 2:14:25.100]  ask you a question. A torture would be
[2:14:25.100 --> 2:14:27.100]  the view. Can I ask you? If you put me in a jail cell
[2:14:27.100 --> 2:14:29.100]  with that on 24 hours a day? Sorry.
[2:14:29.100 --> 2:14:31.100]  What is... I got to ask Alice
[2:14:31.100 --> 2:14:33.100]  when you were on my show. It's the one question I didn't
[2:14:33.100 --> 2:14:35.100]  ask and I always want to ask you. What is your take
[2:14:35.100 --> 2:14:37.100]  on Julian Assange? You
[2:14:37.100 --> 2:14:39.100]  mentioned Wikileaks a lot and
[2:14:39.100 --> 2:14:41.100]  what's going on with him right now and how
[2:14:41.100 --> 2:14:43.100]  those chicks treated
[2:14:43.100 --> 2:14:45.100]  Pamela Anderson when she was on that
[2:14:45.100 --> 2:14:47.100]  channel. I know exactly
[2:14:47.100 --> 2:14:49.100]  what's going on with Julian Assange.
[2:14:49.100 --> 2:14:51.100]  We're going to break in a minute. I can't answer it
[2:14:51.100 --> 2:14:53.100]  then. I will do it at the bottom of the hour. Because
[2:14:53.100 --> 2:14:55.100]  we've got to do Jeffrey Epstein first, but I promise
[2:14:55.100 --> 2:14:57.100]  I'll do it. You'll answer it. I love
[2:14:57.100 --> 2:14:59.100]  to hear your take on it. I'll tell you, I've got it
[2:14:59.100 --> 2:15:01.100]  from all the top people, former deputy
[2:15:01.100 --> 2:15:03.100]  director of the NSA, all the
[2:15:03.100 --> 2:15:05.100]  angles I do exactly what's on it. You don't think
[2:15:05.100 --> 2:15:07.100]  people sometimes give you all your
[2:15:07.100 --> 2:15:09.100]  connections, give you some
[2:15:09.100 --> 2:15:11.100]  drops and leaks
[2:15:11.100 --> 2:15:13.100]  or give you information. I mean, my connections
[2:15:13.100 --> 2:15:15.100]  are, I call these people up that are
[2:15:15.100 --> 2:15:17.100]  respected and already whistleblowers like
[2:15:17.100 --> 2:15:19.100]  William Benning and others and
[2:15:19.100 --> 2:15:21.100]  they know we're a venue to tell the truth
[2:15:21.100 --> 2:15:23.100]  and they know we're under it. There's a lot of people with integrity and government
[2:15:23.100 --> 2:15:25.100]  outside of government. They just know
[2:15:25.100 --> 2:15:27.100]  it never has a voice or platform
[2:15:27.100 --> 2:15:29.100]  for them so you never hear from them.
[2:15:29.100 --> 2:15:31.100]  I'm excited to hear this.
[2:15:31.100 --> 2:15:33.100]  Just like the Millie Weaver
[2:15:33.100 --> 2:15:35.100]  documentary that just dropped at
[2:15:35.100 --> 2:15:37.100]  m4wars.com. It's absolutely free.
[2:15:37.100 --> 2:15:39.100]  Love, Trump's Hate. It's about
[2:15:39.100 --> 2:15:41.100]  over 10 million views. It's in shock waves across the country.
[2:15:41.100 --> 2:15:43.100]  Well, it's an expanded version
[2:15:43.100 --> 2:15:45.100]  of m4wars.com
[2:15:45.100 --> 2:15:47.100]  on the front pages. I called them an hour ago. We'll see
[2:15:47.100 --> 2:15:49.100]  if it is. A lot more coming up.
[2:15:49.100 --> 2:15:51.100]  51st States about to be announced. Stay with us.
[2:15:51.100 --> 2:15:53.100]  That's great.
[2:15:53.100 --> 2:15:55.100]  Finally, there's a way for
[2:15:55.100 --> 2:15:57.100]  you to get into the blockchain. The hottest
[2:15:57.100 --> 2:15:59.100]  financial sector without all the speculation.
[2:15:59.100 --> 2:16:01.100]  No, enjoy a
[2:16:01.100 --> 2:16:03.100]  27% annualized payment each month
[2:16:03.100 --> 2:16:05.100]  without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[2:16:05.100 --> 2:16:07.100]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business
[2:16:07.100 --> 2:16:09.100]  News, blockchain data centers offer
[2:16:09.100 --> 2:16:11.100]  an equipment leasing program in the explosive
[2:16:11.100 --> 2:16:13.100]  digital asset marketplace inspired
[2:16:13.100 --> 2:16:15.100]  by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels
[2:16:15.100 --> 2:16:17.100]  during the gold rush. The money is in the mining
[2:16:17.100 --> 2:16:19.100]  equipment used to manufacture dozens
[2:16:19.100 --> 2:16:21.100]  of critical digital assets, not a security
[2:16:21.100 --> 2:16:23.100]  IPO or note. Blockchain data
[2:16:23.100 --> 2:16:25.100]  centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[2:16:25.100 --> 2:16:27.100]  leaseback program with a 27%
[2:16:27.100 --> 2:16:29.100]  annualized lease payment
[2:16:29.100 --> 2:16:31.100]  deposited into your bank account
[2:16:31.100 --> 2:16:33.100]  each month. Don't miss this one. Take your
[2:16:33.100 --> 2:16:35.100]  claim today. Call
[2:16:35.100 --> 2:16:37.100]  800-600-3388.
[2:16:37.100 --> 2:16:39.100]  That's 800-600-3388.
[2:16:39.100 --> 2:16:41.100]  These valuable lease contracts
[2:16:41.100 --> 2:16:43.100]  won't last long. Call now
[2:16:43.100 --> 2:16:45.100]  800-600-3388.
[2:16:45.100 --> 2:16:47.100]  800-600-3388.
[2:16:47.100 --> 2:16:49.100]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to
[2:16:49.100 --> 2:16:51.100]  owners consult with financial professionals
[2:16:51.100 --> 2:16:53.100]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell
[2:16:53.100 --> 2:16:55.100]  a security which requires an offering document.
[2:16:55.100 --> 2:16:57.100]  Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage,
[2:16:57.100 --> 2:16:59.100]  founder of blackriflerealestate.com.
[2:16:59.100 --> 2:17:01.100]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left
[2:17:01.100 --> 2:17:03.100]  sanctuary state until one day I chose
[2:17:03.100 --> 2:17:05.100]  to leave my family to freedom. Today we live
[2:17:05.100 --> 2:17:07.100]  on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where
[2:17:07.100 --> 2:17:09.100]  we can find a home for our children
[2:17:09.100 --> 2:17:11.100]  without the tyranny of the nanny state
[2:17:11.100 --> 2:17:13.100]  looking over us. If you're ready to
[2:17:13.100 --> 2:17:15.100]  flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana
[2:17:15.100 --> 2:17:17.100]  our black rifle real estate team is here
[2:17:17.100 --> 2:17:19.100]  to help. Go to blackriflerealestate.com
[2:17:19.100 --> 2:17:39.100]  That's blackriflerealestate.com.
[2:17:49.100 --> 2:17:51.100]  The last week and a half we've been running
[2:17:51.100 --> 2:17:53.100]  two specials that are the best deals
[2:17:53.100 --> 2:17:55.100]  in our history.
[2:17:55.100 --> 2:17:57.100]  75% off the total
[2:17:57.100 --> 2:17:59.100]  gut health combo pack.
[2:17:59.100 --> 2:18:01.100]  That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[2:18:01.100 --> 2:18:03.100]  eight different products at over
[2:18:03.100 --> 2:18:05.100]  50% off. It's incredible.
[2:18:05.100 --> 2:18:07.100]  We also have the dust-chilled
[2:18:07.100 --> 2:18:09.100]  dawn in full-warrant.
[2:18:09.100 --> 2:18:11.100]  That's one, two, three, four, five,
[2:18:11.100 --> 2:18:13.100]  six, seven, eight different products
[2:18:13.100 --> 2:18:15.100]  at over 50% off.
[2:18:15.100 --> 2:18:17.100]  It's incredible. We also have the
[2:18:17.100 --> 2:18:19.100]  dust-chilled dawn in full-warrant's
[2:18:19.100 --> 2:18:21.100]  AMP impact, which makes it easy
[2:18:21.100 --> 2:18:23.100]  to take it in the morning and take it in the evening.
[2:18:23.100 --> 2:18:25.100]  13 different key capsules
[2:18:25.100 --> 2:18:27.100]  that are incredible. You want to supercharge
[2:18:27.100 --> 2:18:29.100]  your life? This helps you remember to do it
[2:18:29.100 --> 2:18:31.100]  and the results for myself and many others
[2:18:31.100 --> 2:18:33.100]  have been nothing less than astounding
[2:18:33.100 --> 2:18:35.100]  plus you can't beat it. It funds the information
[2:18:35.100 --> 2:18:37.100]  war. You have absolutely nothing to lose
[2:18:37.100 --> 2:18:39.100]  but not taking action.
[2:18:39.100 --> 2:18:41.100]  Believe you the Deke State, Hillary,
[2:18:41.100 --> 2:18:43.100]  Obama, the NWO
[2:18:43.100 --> 2:18:45.100]  they hope you don't support in full-warrant
[2:18:45.100 --> 2:18:47.100]  in this urgent moment. We're trying to shut us down.
[2:18:47.100 --> 2:18:49.100]  So, we've got a whole bunch of other specials
[2:18:49.100 --> 2:18:51.100]  running as well. Check them out. They're all about
[2:18:51.100 --> 2:18:53.100]  to end in FullWarrantStore.com.
[2:18:56.100 --> 2:18:58.100]  We have entered a great time of change.
[2:18:59.100 --> 2:19:01.100]  Social engineers
[2:19:01.100 --> 2:19:03.100]  who serve Satan, who are in control
[2:19:03.100 --> 2:19:05.100]  of this planet, believe that
[2:19:05.100 --> 2:19:07.100]  if they can organize enough crises that
[2:19:07.100 --> 2:19:09.100]  they control, they can
[2:19:09.100 --> 2:19:11.100]  terrorize the planet into accepting
[2:19:11.100 --> 2:19:13.100]  a tyrannical corporate world government
[2:19:13.100 --> 2:19:15.100]  known as the technocracy
[2:19:15.100 --> 2:19:17.100]  in their own words that will manage and
[2:19:17.100 --> 2:19:19.100]  control and manipulate every facet
[2:19:19.100 --> 2:19:21.100]  of our lives. At first
[2:19:21.100 --> 2:19:23.100]  they give you just a few basic things
[2:19:23.100 --> 2:19:25.100]  to do. Don't support Trump.
[2:19:25.100 --> 2:19:27.100]  Don't promote Alex Jones. And once you've
[2:19:27.100 --> 2:19:29.100]  submitted to that, well, don't say mother
[2:19:29.100 --> 2:19:31.100]  and father and, well, let us sterilize
[2:19:31.100 --> 2:19:33.100]  your children. Take these forced
[2:19:33.100 --> 2:19:35.100]  inoculations and here, take this Prozac
[2:19:35.100 --> 2:19:37.100]  pill and here, smoke this weaponized
[2:19:37.100 --> 2:19:39.100]  marijuana. Oh, don't be a Christian.
[2:19:39.100 --> 2:19:41.100]  This is
[2:19:41.100 --> 2:19:43.100]  truly the market to be system and we're on air
[2:19:43.100 --> 2:19:45.100]  right now covering it and you're awake,
[2:19:45.100 --> 2:19:47.100]  you're involved, you're engaged, you're an
[2:19:47.100 --> 2:19:49.100]  ambassador of truth, so I'm begging you
[2:19:49.100 --> 2:19:51.100]  for yourself and myself and my family and
[2:19:51.100 --> 2:19:53.100]  your family. Spread the word about Infowars.com
[2:19:53.100 --> 2:20:19.100]  live shows right now.
[2:20:19.100 --> 2:20:21.100]  Trust me baby.
[2:20:21.100 --> 2:20:23.100]  Trust me honey. Everything's
[2:20:23.100 --> 2:20:25.100]  gonna be all right.
[2:20:25.100 --> 2:20:27.100]  Good stuff. Crank it up.
[2:20:27.100 --> 2:20:29.100]  Just do like I do.
[2:20:29.100 --> 2:20:31.100]  There ain't nothing to do.
[2:20:31.100 --> 2:20:33.100]  All right, folks, let's go ahead and get
[2:20:33.100 --> 2:20:35.100]  right back into all the news
[2:20:35.100 --> 2:20:37.100]  with Eddie Bravo
[2:20:37.100 --> 2:20:39.100]  and of course, Sam Tripoli
[2:20:39.100 --> 2:20:41.100]  here with us right now
[2:20:41.100 --> 2:20:43.100]  and they're doing a show
[2:20:43.100 --> 2:20:45.100]  tomorrow night in Austin, Texas
[2:20:45.100 --> 2:20:47.100]  at the Paramount Theater.
[2:20:47.100 --> 2:20:49.100]  And again, both of you tell people
[2:20:49.100 --> 2:20:51.100]  where
[2:20:51.100 --> 2:20:53.100]  people can find the tickets.
[2:20:53.100 --> 2:20:55.100]  Maybe they're not from Austin. They're gonna come in from outside Austin.
[2:20:55.100 --> 2:20:57.100]  Tell people your Twitter accounts.
[2:20:57.100 --> 2:20:59.100]  7 p.m. Friday night, tomorrow night
[2:20:59.100 --> 2:21:01.100]  at the Paramount Theater. It's also called
[2:21:01.100 --> 2:21:03.100]  Stateside Theater. I don't know why they have
[2:21:03.100 --> 2:21:05.100]  two names, but Sam, how do they get tickets?
[2:21:05.100 --> 2:21:07.100]  Just go to Austin,
[2:21:07.100 --> 2:21:09.100]  austintheater.org
[2:21:09.100 --> 2:21:11.100]  and you can grab the tickets there. That's
[2:21:11.100 --> 2:21:13.100]  austintheater.org
[2:21:13.100 --> 2:21:15.100]  Everybody loves it.
[2:21:15.100 --> 2:21:17.100]  Here's the thing, the show's fun.
[2:21:17.100 --> 2:21:19.100]  The kids who come are smoke shows.
[2:21:19.100 --> 2:21:21.100]  I don't know how that happens
[2:21:21.100 --> 2:21:23.100]  but the chit... like, 10s love
[2:21:23.100 --> 2:21:25.100]  conspiracies. I don't know why
[2:21:25.100 --> 2:21:27.100]  they just do and God bless it.
[2:21:27.100 --> 2:21:29.100]  Or they like Eddie Bravo.
[2:21:29.100 --> 2:21:31.100]  They like Eddie Bravo too, but sometimes
[2:21:31.100 --> 2:21:33.100]  they give me the googly eyes too.
[2:21:33.100 --> 2:21:35.100]  I met you like 15 years ago in Vegas. I was there
[2:21:35.100 --> 2:21:37.100]  watching the fights with Joe,
[2:21:37.100 --> 2:21:39.100]  we went behind the scenes and you had some very lovely ladies with you.
[2:21:39.100 --> 2:21:41.100]  Hey, where about me?
[2:21:41.100 --> 2:21:43.100]  In Vegas. But you're married now and have a
[2:21:43.100 --> 2:21:45.100]  7-year-old.
[2:21:45.100 --> 2:21:47.100]  I was like 15 years ago. Or 20 years ago.
[2:21:47.100 --> 2:21:49.100]  30!
[2:21:49.100 --> 2:21:51.100]  50 years ago.
[2:21:51.100 --> 2:21:53.100]  That was 175,000 years ago.
[2:21:53.100 --> 2:21:55.100]  I'm a different man now.
[2:21:55.100 --> 2:21:57.100]  He's a messiah. After the show, he holds
[2:21:57.100 --> 2:21:59.100]  gospel, talks for an hour
[2:21:59.100 --> 2:22:01.100]  and then we go find some really bad food
[2:22:01.100 --> 2:22:03.100]  to eat and then we go to...
[2:22:03.100 --> 2:22:05.100]  He is kind of like the messiah. You're very price-like.
[2:22:05.100 --> 2:22:07.100]  We're going to play that later.
[2:22:07.100 --> 2:22:09.100]  Kanya talking about Jesus. I love that.
[2:22:09.100 --> 2:22:11.100]  It's so rebellious against the system and that's
[2:22:11.100 --> 2:22:13.100]  absolutely where we're at. Let's get back to the guy that's
[2:22:13.100 --> 2:22:15.100]  not like Jesus. Jeffrey Epstein
[2:22:15.100 --> 2:22:17.100]  was, you're asking who he is. He was the
[2:22:17.100 --> 2:22:19.100]  front man for a larger
[2:22:19.100 --> 2:22:21.100]  private breakaway civilization group
[2:22:21.100 --> 2:22:23.100]  run by Bill Gates again.
[2:22:23.100 --> 2:22:25.100]  He worked for Bill Gates running the group
[2:22:25.100 --> 2:22:27.100]  and Warren Buffett and
[2:22:27.100 --> 2:22:29.100]  a lot of other folks that are involved. You can actually
[2:22:29.100 --> 2:22:31.100]  type in the articles from 10 years ago.
[2:22:31.100 --> 2:22:33.100]  Billionaires meet in secret to discuss
[2:22:33.100 --> 2:22:35.100]  depopulation and world government.
[2:22:35.100 --> 2:22:37.100]  London Guardian, New York Times,
[2:22:37.100 --> 2:22:39.100]  that was how positive it was and Epstein was heading up
[2:22:39.100 --> 2:22:41.100]  the group inside the Albert Einstein
[2:22:41.100 --> 2:22:43.100]  University
[2:22:43.100 --> 2:22:45.100]  and so they would go and blackmail all
[2:22:45.100 --> 2:22:47.100]  the scientists over all the
[2:22:47.100 --> 2:22:49.100]  universities to get them involved in their
[2:22:49.100 --> 2:22:51.100]  secret scientific
[2:22:51.100 --> 2:22:53.100]  research that was going on.
[2:22:53.100 --> 2:22:55.100]  So the sex with kids and the drugs and
[2:22:55.100 --> 2:22:57.100]  things was just to get all the
[2:22:57.100 --> 2:22:59.100]  scientists compromised and then into the eugenics
[2:22:59.100 --> 2:23:01.100]  cult and that's all admitted. And I said
[2:23:01.100 --> 2:23:03.100]  that years before it ever came out in the news
[2:23:03.100 --> 2:23:05.100]  that he was running that. Of course, it's all confirmed now.
[2:23:05.100 --> 2:23:07.100]  Now, you know
[2:23:07.100 --> 2:23:09.100]  how he actually
[2:23:09.100 --> 2:23:11.100]  died, right? We have a clip of how he actually
[2:23:11.100 --> 2:23:13.100]  died. Most people don't know this.
[2:23:13.100 --> 2:23:15.100]  Alright, let's go ahead and roll this clip
[2:23:15.100 --> 2:23:17.100]  of how Jeffrey Epstein actually
[2:23:17.100 --> 2:23:19.100]  died. Here it is.
[2:23:21.100 --> 2:23:23.100]  Very interesting, isn't it?
[2:23:23.100 --> 2:23:25.100]  I can see it. That is powerful.
[2:23:25.100 --> 2:23:27.100]  I sent it to Doug. I told him that.
[2:23:27.100 --> 2:23:29.100]  There it is. But audio please.
[2:23:29.100 --> 2:23:31.100]  You gotta turn it up and rewind it now.
[2:23:31.100 --> 2:23:33.100]  It's like...
[2:23:35.100 --> 2:23:37.100]  You gotta hear this. It's okay. Let's just stop
[2:23:37.100 --> 2:23:39.100]  now. We'll do it next segment.
[2:23:39.100 --> 2:23:41.100]  Next segment.
[2:23:41.100 --> 2:23:43.100]  It's great. We'll have a meeting. No, no, no.
[2:23:43.100 --> 2:23:45.100]  Not now. No, no, no.
[2:23:45.100 --> 2:23:47.100]  They want to find out how he died.
[2:23:47.100 --> 2:23:49.100]  They want to find out how he died.
[2:23:49.100 --> 2:23:51.100]  This wouldn't happen.
[2:23:51.100 --> 2:23:53.100]  This wouldn't happen.
[2:23:53.100 --> 2:23:55.100]  Let me explain.
[2:23:55.100 --> 2:23:57.100]  I think it's scripted through Alchemy.
[2:23:57.100 --> 2:23:59.100]  And then we're going to re-air it
[2:23:59.100 --> 2:24:01.100]  next segment. That's how we win.
[2:24:01.100 --> 2:24:03.100]  We're going to talk about
[2:24:03.100 --> 2:24:05.100]  having my victory.
[2:24:05.100 --> 2:24:07.100]  So, and we're going to play the other clip
[2:24:07.100 --> 2:24:09.100]  you gave us too. Yes. We'll have a meeting
[2:24:09.100 --> 2:24:11.100]  about it in there at the next break.
[2:24:11.100 --> 2:24:13.100]  And then we'll do it. Okay.
[2:24:13.100 --> 2:24:15.100]  These are computers. People want to know how he died.
[2:24:15.100 --> 2:24:17.100]  These computers have heart attacks. Joe had
[2:24:17.100 --> 2:24:19.100]  that old bit like 20 years ago that
[2:24:19.100 --> 2:24:21.100]  it's the year 2000. We're supposed to have
[2:24:21.100 --> 2:24:23.100]  spacesuits and stuff, and jetpacks.
[2:24:23.100 --> 2:24:25.100]  Instead of getting behind a bush, the thing craps out.
[2:24:25.100 --> 2:24:27.100]  Have you noticed that technology just messes
[2:24:27.100 --> 2:24:29.100]  up more and more? I also know that
[2:24:29.100 --> 2:24:31.100]  every time I get an update on my phone,
[2:24:31.100 --> 2:24:33.100]  suddenly it commits sepico. That's all I know.
[2:24:33.100 --> 2:24:35.100]  I hate doing
[2:24:35.100 --> 2:24:37.100]  updates on my phone
[2:24:37.100 --> 2:24:39.100]  because I know it's about to go to crap
[2:24:39.100 --> 2:24:41.100]  and they're going to make me go get a new one.
[2:24:41.100 --> 2:24:43.100]  That's the plan. Every time.
[2:24:43.100 --> 2:24:45.100]  That's the plan. Every time.
[2:24:45.100 --> 2:24:47.100]  It's absolute
[2:24:47.100 --> 2:24:49.100]  artificial obsolescence.
[2:24:49.100 --> 2:24:51.100]  And they do it every time.
[2:24:51.100 --> 2:24:53.100]  And I go as long as I can without updating it.
[2:24:53.100 --> 2:24:55.100]  Then they're like, you know, you can't update
[2:24:55.100 --> 2:24:57.100]  your apps now because you won't get our
[2:24:57.100 --> 2:24:59.100]  new system. I'm like you winning.
[2:24:59.100 --> 2:25:01.100]  And they say that that's a conspiracy theory
[2:25:01.100 --> 2:25:03.100]  that they build
[2:25:03.100 --> 2:25:05.100]  in planned obsolescence and light bulbs engines.
[2:25:05.100 --> 2:25:07.100]  They've got carburetors
[2:25:07.100 --> 2:25:09.100]  that do five gallons.
[2:25:09.100 --> 2:25:11.100]  You go 100 miles, 200 miles, 500 miles.
[2:25:11.100 --> 2:25:13.100]  But they just won't let us have it.
[2:25:13.100 --> 2:25:15.100]  Yeah, you notice that cars
[2:25:15.100 --> 2:25:17.100]  haven't really evolved that much at all.
[2:25:17.100 --> 2:25:19.100]  It's still like
[2:25:19.100 --> 2:25:21.100]  my truck's 15 to 17
[2:25:21.100 --> 2:25:23.100]  miles per gallon.
[2:25:23.100 --> 2:25:25.100]  The prices of cars are basically the same.
[2:25:25.100 --> 2:25:27.100]  Like gas
[2:25:27.100 --> 2:25:29.100]  prices have gone up, but not really compared
[2:25:29.100 --> 2:25:31.100]  to like how everything else
[2:25:31.100 --> 2:25:33.100]  has gone up. Everything's the same.
[2:25:33.100 --> 2:25:35.100]  It's like, you know, when are we going to have
[2:25:35.100 --> 2:25:37.100]  cars that go 200 miles
[2:25:37.100 --> 2:25:39.100]  per gallon? It's always the same.
[2:25:39.100 --> 2:25:41.100]  They've been compressing their real technologies.
[2:25:41.100 --> 2:25:43.100]  33 gallons per mile, 35,
[2:25:43.100 --> 2:25:45.100]  25.
[2:25:45.100 --> 2:25:47.100]  It's been like that for 30 years.
[2:25:47.100 --> 2:25:49.100]  Absolutely. Let's get, let me get your takes.
[2:25:49.100 --> 2:25:51.100]  You're asking me questions and we're going to
[2:25:51.100 --> 2:25:53.100]  have Epstein finish up with that and then do a
[2:25:53.100 --> 2:25:55.100]  sound segment. And my view
[2:25:55.100 --> 2:25:57.100]  and who he really is and what's really going on.
[2:25:57.100 --> 2:25:59.100]  I mean, this Epstein thing
[2:25:59.100 --> 2:26:01.100]  seemed to really wake people up and really seem to discredit
[2:26:01.100 --> 2:26:03.100]  the system like nothing else I've seen
[2:26:03.100 --> 2:26:05.100]  and how they keep trying to set Kavanaugh up
[2:26:05.100 --> 2:26:07.100]  and then the women later had been, I was threatened, it's all a lie.
[2:26:07.100 --> 2:26:09.100]  There's like 10 women now.
[2:26:09.100 --> 2:26:11.100]  They just have new fake ones go public.
[2:26:11.100 --> 2:26:13.100]  Well, I mean, let's get into the, listen dude,
[2:26:13.100 --> 2:26:15.100]  I mean, you might be a Kavanaugh guy.
[2:26:15.100 --> 2:26:17.100]  I think that whole sex thing was all
[2:26:17.100 --> 2:26:19.100]  drummed up to kind of
[2:26:19.100 --> 2:26:21.100]  frame it and the sexual exports.
[2:26:21.100 --> 2:26:23.100]  But what do you think?
[2:26:23.100 --> 2:26:25.100]  To change the subject away from Kavanaugh himself to something fake?
[2:26:25.100 --> 2:26:27.100]  Yeah. So what, like, oh, the guy wrote
[2:26:27.100 --> 2:26:29.100]  the Patriot Act. He believes that the president's
[2:26:29.100 --> 2:26:31.100]  above the law. He's against
[2:26:31.100 --> 2:26:33.100]  stuff. He doesn't think that the cops need
[2:26:33.100 --> 2:26:35.100]  search warrants to come in your house. There's a whole
[2:26:35.100 --> 2:26:37.100]  stuff, a whole lot of stuff
[2:26:37.100 --> 2:26:39.100]  that they didn't want you actually discussing.
[2:26:39.100 --> 2:26:41.100]  So they brought this thing and they had this woman
[2:26:41.100 --> 2:26:43.100]  whose father
[2:26:43.100 --> 2:26:45.100]  was in charge of finding
[2:26:45.100 --> 2:26:47.100]  funding for CIA
[2:26:47.100 --> 2:26:49.100]  black ops observations.
[2:26:49.100 --> 2:26:51.100]  Well, I mean, the lawsuit for it does work for the CIA.
[2:26:51.100 --> 2:26:53.100]  Yeah, she's part of that whole recruitment center.
[2:26:53.100 --> 2:26:55.100]  That whole recruitment center.
[2:26:55.100 --> 2:26:57.100]  He runs a recruitment center at Stanford
[2:26:57.100 --> 2:26:59.100]  where they just shish kebab
[2:26:59.100 --> 2:27:01.100]  the unabomber and you should read the
[2:27:01.100 --> 2:27:03.100]  unabombers manifesto and realize
[2:27:03.100 --> 2:27:05.100]  the guy nailed everything that's going on.
[2:27:05.100 --> 2:27:07.100]  Unabomber is right. He was
[2:27:07.100 --> 2:27:09.100]  in MKUltra. He was. For two years
[2:27:09.100 --> 2:27:11.100]  they shish kebab that dude.
[2:27:11.100 --> 2:27:13.100]  Shish kebab. Shish kebab means
[2:27:13.100 --> 2:27:15.100]  in that wasn't too good. No,
[2:27:15.100 --> 2:27:17.100]  they messed his head, dude. They MKUltra
[2:27:17.100 --> 2:27:19.100]  for two years like
[2:27:19.100 --> 2:27:21.100]  hardcore stuff. Electrical shock,
[2:27:21.100 --> 2:27:23.100]  and he nailed all this.
[2:27:23.100 --> 2:27:25.100]  See, what's going on with liberalism
[2:27:25.100 --> 2:27:27.100]  is that the kids,
[2:27:27.100 --> 2:27:29.100]  these trust fund kids have taken over
[2:27:29.100 --> 2:27:31.100]  and now their liberalism
[2:27:31.100 --> 2:27:33.100]  is that they feel bad
[2:27:33.100 --> 2:27:35.100]  for all these people, but they don't really
[2:27:35.100 --> 2:27:37.100]  respect them. They actually say
[2:27:37.100 --> 2:27:39.100]  they look down on them.
[2:27:39.100 --> 2:27:41.100]  Oh, it's a cover for their incredible greed
[2:27:41.100 --> 2:27:43.100]  and hatred and wanting to rule.
[2:27:43.100 --> 2:27:45.100]  My buddy calls them space aliens.
[2:27:45.100 --> 2:27:47.100]  People that are third, fourth generation, wealth and power
[2:27:47.100 --> 2:27:49.100]  aren't even in the real world.
[2:27:49.100 --> 2:27:51.100]  They're like reptiles.
[2:27:51.100 --> 2:27:53.100]  I mean, take a look at some famous people
[2:27:53.100 --> 2:27:55.100]  in Hollywood. Nicole Kidman's father
[2:27:55.100 --> 2:27:57.100]  was like a giant
[2:27:57.100 --> 2:27:59.100]  petal ring leader
[2:27:59.100 --> 2:28:01.100]  allegedly. And then you had also had
[2:28:01.100 --> 2:28:03.100]  Woody Harrelson. The Eyes Wide Shut tells you all that.
[2:28:03.100 --> 2:28:05.100]  Yeah, Woody Harrelson's father
[2:28:05.100 --> 2:28:07.100]  was part of the assassination jet.
[2:28:07.100 --> 2:28:09.100]  Allegedly. No, no, no. He was arrested.
[2:28:09.100 --> 2:28:11.100]  And I know Willie.
[2:28:11.100 --> 2:28:13.100]  I mean, Woody Harrelson's good guy was in the movie.
[2:28:13.100 --> 2:28:15.100]  But the point is, his dad died
[2:28:15.100 --> 2:28:17.100]  in prison for killing a judge in Texas.
[2:28:17.100 --> 2:28:19.100]  Shot him at $300.
[2:28:19.100 --> 2:28:21.100]  No, no, I mean, that was all
[2:28:21.100 --> 2:28:23.100]  run by E. Howard Hunt,
[2:28:23.100 --> 2:28:25.100]  who did the deathbed confession. We premiered it here.
[2:28:27.100 --> 2:28:29.100]  Yeah, so my point is, oh, hell yeah.
[2:28:29.100 --> 2:28:31.100]  Go see us live.
[2:28:31.100 --> 2:28:33.100]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[2:28:33.100 --> 2:28:35.100]  Now listen, we're going to come back
[2:28:35.100 --> 2:28:37.100]  with these deep fakes and then we're going to get into
[2:28:37.100 --> 2:28:39.100]  the situation with Julian Assange
[2:28:39.100 --> 2:28:41.100]  and really a black mark on Trump.
[2:28:41.100 --> 2:28:43.100]  They had done something straight ahead
[2:28:43.100 --> 2:28:45.100]  with the host of the tinfoil hat show.
[2:28:45.100 --> 2:28:47.100]  We'll be right back.
[2:29:15.100 --> 2:29:17.100]  We'll be right back.
[2:29:45.100 --> 2:29:47.100]  I know most of you realize this,
[2:29:47.100 --> 2:29:49.100]  but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[2:29:49.100 --> 2:29:51.100]  You are just as important
[2:29:51.100 --> 2:29:53.100]  as I am or the rest of the crew
[2:29:53.100 --> 2:29:55.100]  at Info Wars. And we are.
[2:29:55.100 --> 2:29:57.100]  The individuals that have done the research
[2:29:57.100 --> 2:29:59.100]  to understand the global spattle plan
[2:29:59.100 --> 2:30:01.100]  and we know how to take them down.
[2:30:01.100 --> 2:30:03.100]  That's why they're so upset.
[2:30:03.100 --> 2:30:05.100]  Think how far we've come together.
[2:30:05.100 --> 2:30:07.100]  You know, even if we were losing,
[2:30:07.100 --> 2:30:09.100]  we would still be losing.
[2:30:09.100 --> 2:30:11.100]  We would still be losing.
[2:30:11.100 --> 2:30:13.100]  We would still be losing.
[2:30:13.100 --> 2:30:15.100]  You know, even if we were losing,
[2:30:15.100 --> 2:30:17.100]  we'd all still keep fighting on because
[2:30:17.100 --> 2:30:19.100]  it's the right thing to do against the truly
[2:30:19.100 --> 2:30:21.100]  satanic forces of the New World Order
[2:30:21.100 --> 2:30:23.100]  who've really taken the mask off.
[2:30:23.100 --> 2:30:25.100]  The lines in the sand for everybody now.
[2:30:25.100 --> 2:30:27.100]  But you'd already chosen to fight
[2:30:27.100 --> 2:30:29.100]  the corruption and to stand with God
[2:30:29.100 --> 2:30:31.100]  and to stand with the unborn.
[2:30:31.100 --> 2:30:33.100]  So I just want to take time out again to salute
[2:30:33.100 --> 2:30:35.100]  the audience because you are truly
[2:30:35.100 --> 2:30:37.100]  activist in the arena.
[2:30:37.100 --> 2:30:39.100]  And without you and your prayers and your word of mouth
[2:30:39.100 --> 2:30:41.100]  and your financial support,
[2:30:41.100 --> 2:30:43.100]  this operation that you built
[2:30:43.100 --> 2:30:45.100]  that's your operation will not be here.
[2:30:45.100 --> 2:30:47.100]  We've got some giant specials running right now
[2:30:47.100 --> 2:30:49.100]  at m4store.com. A lot of items are 50% off.
[2:30:49.100 --> 2:30:51.100]  Please take advantage of it
[2:30:51.100 --> 2:30:53.100]  at m4store.com to help us
[2:30:53.100 --> 2:30:55.100]  fight even harder into the future.
[2:31:01.100 --> 2:31:03.100]  For the last week and a half we've been running
[2:31:03.100 --> 2:31:05.100]  two specials that are the best
[2:31:05.100 --> 2:31:07.100]  deals in our history.
[2:31:07.100 --> 2:31:09.100]  75% off the Total Gut Health
[2:31:09.100 --> 2:31:11.100]  Combo Pack. That's
[2:31:11.100 --> 2:31:13.100]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 different
[2:31:13.100 --> 2:31:15.100]  products at over 15% off.
[2:31:15.100 --> 2:31:17.100]  It's incredible. We also have
[2:31:17.100 --> 2:31:19.100]  the Dust Till Dawn
[2:31:19.100 --> 2:31:21.100]  Imple Wars AMP Impact which makes it
[2:31:21.100 --> 2:31:23.100]  easy to take it in the morning and take it in the evening.
[2:31:23.100 --> 2:31:25.100]  13 different key capsules
[2:31:25.100 --> 2:31:27.100]  that are incredible. You want to
[2:31:27.100 --> 2:31:29.100]  supercharge your life? This helps you remember
[2:31:29.100 --> 2:31:31.100]  to do it and the results for myself and many others
[2:31:31.100 --> 2:31:33.100]  have been nothing less than astounding
[2:31:33.100 --> 2:31:35.100]  plus you can't beat it. It funds the information war.
[2:31:35.100 --> 2:31:37.100]  You have absolutely nothing to lose
[2:31:37.100 --> 2:31:39.100]  but not taking action.
[2:31:39.100 --> 2:31:41.100]  Believe you, the Deke State,
[2:31:41.100 --> 2:31:43.100]  Hillary, Obama, the NWO
[2:31:43.100 --> 2:31:45.100]  they hope you don't support Imple Wars
[2:31:45.100 --> 2:31:47.100]  in this urgent moment when they're trying to shut us down.
[2:31:47.100 --> 2:31:49.100]  So we've got a whole bunch of other specials
[2:31:49.100 --> 2:31:51.100]  running as well. Check them out. They're all about to end
[2:31:51.100 --> 2:32:15.100]  ImpleWarsStore.com.
[2:32:21.100 --> 2:32:23.100]  We are just mortal, flawed human beings
[2:32:23.100 --> 2:32:25.100]  that need to seek God's
[2:32:25.100 --> 2:32:27.100]  countenance, God's discernment
[2:32:27.100 --> 2:32:29.100]  and to pray for peace
[2:32:29.100 --> 2:32:31.100]  and to pray for transparency
[2:32:31.100 --> 2:32:33.100]  and to pray that the very twisted evil forces
[2:32:33.100 --> 2:32:35.100]  on this planet
[2:32:35.100 --> 2:32:37.100]  trying to start a world war
[2:32:37.100 --> 2:32:39.100]  will be exposed and their attempts
[2:32:39.100 --> 2:32:41.100]  at creating even bigger global crisis
[2:32:41.100 --> 2:32:43.100]  will be stopped.
[2:32:43.100 --> 2:32:45.100]  Now we'll probably avert a new world war
[2:32:45.100 --> 2:32:47.100]  hopefully but it's already
[2:32:47.100 --> 2:32:49.100]  tilting towards a global depression
[2:32:49.100 --> 2:32:51.100]  because of energy crises.
[2:32:51.100 --> 2:33:20.100]  We're covering it all live on the radio at ImpleWars.com.
[2:33:21.100 --> 2:33:23.100]  Houston, Texas. Broadcasting
[2:33:23.100 --> 2:33:25.100]  Worldwide.
[2:33:25.100 --> 2:33:31.100]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:31.100 --> 2:33:33.100]  We're going to really move quick
[2:33:33.100 --> 2:33:35.100]  for some really serious topics
[2:33:35.100 --> 2:33:37.100]  and both these good guys are going to be back in the studio
[2:33:37.100 --> 2:33:39.100]  with us tomorrow, Sam Tripoli and Eddie Bravo.
[2:33:39.100 --> 2:33:41.100]  A lot of feet up there in the break again.
[2:33:41.100 --> 2:33:43.100]  Majidjicius kills her way above him.
[2:33:43.100 --> 2:33:45.100]  That's really serious now.
[2:33:45.100 --> 2:33:47.100]  The whole internet can talk about how I claim I can beat him up.
[2:33:47.100 --> 2:33:49.100]  I'm joking, right?
[2:33:49.100 --> 2:33:51.100]  It's really serious here.
[2:33:51.100 --> 2:33:53.100]  They're like, hey, plug during the break.
[2:33:53.100 --> 2:33:55.100]  Hey, plug. You didn't plug all last hour.
[2:33:55.100 --> 2:33:57.100]  Every other Talk Show host plugs every segment during the segment
[2:33:57.100 --> 2:33:59.100]  because that's when people are listening.
[2:33:59.100 --> 2:34:01.100]  Well, absolutely.
[2:34:01.100 --> 2:34:03.100]  We have sales ending this week
[2:34:03.100 --> 2:34:05.100]  on a bunch of our best selling products because we're selling out of them
[2:34:05.100 --> 2:34:07.100]  and I don't just say that.
[2:34:07.100 --> 2:34:09.100]  DNA Force Plus with the PQQ, the CoQ10
[2:34:09.100 --> 2:34:11.100]  that sold out. It's not in until next month.
[2:34:11.100 --> 2:34:13.100]  We've got the Krill Oil about to sell out
[2:34:13.100 --> 2:34:15.100]  because it's so popular.
[2:34:15.100 --> 2:34:17.100]  People have actually looked at it and know it's the highest quality.
[2:34:17.100 --> 2:34:19.100]  I take it the way I dream.
[2:34:19.100 --> 2:34:21.100]  It's just the way my brain works.
[2:34:21.100 --> 2:34:23.100]  I mean, it's a hallucination, basically.
[2:34:23.100 --> 2:34:25.100]  I don't say that in a medical way.
[2:34:25.100 --> 2:34:27.100]  I get high off fish oil,
[2:34:27.100 --> 2:34:29.100]  but it's got to be the real stuff, folks.
[2:34:29.100 --> 2:34:31.100]  If you don't get fish burps, it's not the real deal.
[2:34:31.100 --> 2:34:33.100]  But again, a lot of this stuff is very expensive
[2:34:33.100 --> 2:34:35.100]  when they go through the process to remove the mercury.
[2:34:35.100 --> 2:34:37.100]  We pay for that process as well
[2:34:37.100 --> 2:34:39.100]  so it doesn't have mercury in it.
[2:34:39.100 --> 2:34:41.100]  It's still a very small amount in other fish oils,
[2:34:41.100 --> 2:34:43.100]  but we haven't removed it.
[2:34:43.100 --> 2:34:45.100]  Get it. It's all 50% off
[2:34:45.100 --> 2:34:47.100]  at www.curt.com.
[2:34:47.100 --> 2:34:49.100]  A lot about other products are 50% off as well.
[2:34:49.100 --> 2:34:51.100]  And we're 50% off.
[2:34:51.100 --> 2:34:53.100]  We're making like 30% or so.
[2:34:53.100 --> 2:34:55.100]  And some of these specials we're running,
[2:34:55.100 --> 2:34:57.100]  we're selling these at cost,
[2:34:57.100 --> 2:34:59.100]  like super metal vitality,
[2:34:59.100 --> 2:35:01.100]  cold pressed herbs,
[2:35:01.100 --> 2:35:03.100]  takes three times as many.
[2:35:03.100 --> 2:35:05.100]  It never denatures the key enzymes
[2:35:05.100 --> 2:35:07.100]  and the ring structures
[2:35:07.100 --> 2:35:09.100]  and all the things that are in it.
[2:35:09.100 --> 2:35:11.100]  Stamina, libido, energy, it's amazing.
[2:35:11.100 --> 2:35:13.100]  50% off, get a free bottle of ultimate female force.
[2:35:13.100 --> 2:35:15.100]  It's organic.
[2:35:15.100 --> 2:35:17.100]  It's in the powder form.
[2:35:17.100 --> 2:35:19.100]  It's stronger than super metal vitality,
[2:35:19.100 --> 2:35:21.100]  but it's dry.
[2:35:21.100 --> 2:35:23.100]  But let me just tell you,
[2:35:23.100 --> 2:35:25.100]  stamina, libido, energy for your wife,
[2:35:25.100 --> 2:35:27.100]  your girlfriend.
[2:35:27.100 --> 2:35:29.100]  It's a free bottle of it.
[2:35:29.100 --> 2:35:31.100]  It's a big giant bottle.
[2:35:31.100 --> 2:35:33.100]  It's expensive for us,
[2:35:33.100 --> 2:35:35.100]  but I want to get women hooked on it.
[2:35:35.100 --> 2:35:37.100]  So I want them to be the regular price
[2:35:37.100 --> 2:35:39.100]  when we reorder it and it comes back in.
[2:35:39.100 --> 2:35:41.100]  It won't be back in until the second month of next year.
[2:35:41.100 --> 2:35:43.100]  That's how close we are here at the margins
[2:35:43.100 --> 2:35:45.100]  with the platform and the demonization
[2:35:45.100 --> 2:35:47.100]  and all the attacks.
[2:35:47.100 --> 2:35:49.100]  A bunch of other big specials we're running right now.
[2:35:49.100 --> 2:35:51.100]  Be sure and take advantage of all of them
[2:35:51.100 --> 2:35:53.100]  because they're about to end.
[2:35:53.100 --> 2:35:55.100]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the subpage
[2:35:55.100 --> 2:35:57.100]  where you find it all.
[2:35:57.100 --> 2:35:59.100]  75% off, that's at below cost
[2:35:59.100 --> 2:36:01.100]  for 8-pack power stack,
[2:36:01.100 --> 2:36:03.100]  the AMPM system where you take it in the morning,
[2:36:03.100 --> 2:36:05.100]  you take it at night.
[2:36:05.100 --> 2:36:07.100]  It's amazing. You won't forget to take your vitamins,
[2:36:07.100 --> 2:36:09.100]  your minerals, your fish oil,
[2:36:09.100 --> 2:36:11.100]  the tropic, and then you go to sleepy pill.
[2:36:11.100 --> 2:36:13.100]  It's all in there.
[2:36:13.100 --> 2:36:15.100]  That is below cost because
[2:36:15.100 --> 2:36:17.100]  I'm clearing the decks of it.
[2:36:17.100 --> 2:36:19.100]  It should be our best seller. It's not.
[2:36:19.100 --> 2:36:21.100]  So I can order a smaller amount
[2:36:21.100 --> 2:36:23.100]  for next year.
[2:36:23.100 --> 2:36:25.100]  So so many big specials are about to end.
[2:36:25.100 --> 2:36:27.100]  Ultra 12, 50% off.
[2:36:27.100 --> 2:36:29.100]  Infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[2:36:29.100 --> 2:36:31.100]  Now, that's it.
[2:36:31.100 --> 2:36:33.100]  Something very, very exciting we're doing.
[2:36:33.100 --> 2:36:35.100]  We are
[2:36:35.100 --> 2:36:37.100]  pushing for
[2:36:37.100 --> 2:36:39.100]  the 51st state of the United States
[2:36:39.100 --> 2:36:41.100]  to not be
[2:36:41.100 --> 2:36:43.100]  Greenland,
[2:36:43.100 --> 2:36:45.100]  which is a good strategic move.
[2:36:45.100 --> 2:36:47.100]  We bought Alaska. We bought a lot of other areas.
[2:36:47.100 --> 2:36:49.100]  It makes perfect sense. The globalists don't want us doing it.
[2:36:49.100 --> 2:36:51.100]  They want the UN to control the Arctic,
[2:36:51.100 --> 2:36:53.100]  the Antarctic.
[2:36:53.100 --> 2:36:55.100]  They want the UN and global government to control these things
[2:36:55.100 --> 2:36:57.100]  and not have nation states that people can actually
[2:36:57.100 --> 2:36:59.100]  elect and control to some extent to have this.
[2:36:59.100 --> 2:37:01.100]  Well, document cam shot, please.
[2:37:01.100 --> 2:37:03.100]  Drum roll.
[2:37:03.100 --> 2:37:05.100]  Let's think bigger here. Let's annex the moon
[2:37:05.100 --> 2:37:07.100]  as the
[2:37:07.100 --> 2:37:09.100]  51st state. Sign the White House petition
[2:37:09.100 --> 2:37:11.100]  linked at
[2:37:11.100 --> 2:37:13.100]  infowars.com. I'm not joking.
[2:37:13.100 --> 2:37:15.100]  We walk to the moon and he's going to talk about tomorrow.
[2:37:15.100 --> 2:37:17.100]  I believe that I'm joking. First, so we can claim it.
[2:37:17.100 --> 2:37:19.100]  And Plusword America.
[2:37:19.100 --> 2:37:21.100]  Better than the UN, the Chai Coms
[2:37:21.100 --> 2:37:23.100]  or all these other folks. So sign the petition
[2:37:23.100 --> 2:37:25.100]  and drum roll, please.
[2:37:25.100 --> 2:37:27.100]  Look at this.
[2:37:27.100 --> 2:37:29.100]  These shirts are being printed as we speak.
[2:37:29.100 --> 2:37:31.100]  They'll be in next week.
[2:37:31.100 --> 2:37:33.100]  This designer cloth feels really great.
[2:37:33.100 --> 2:37:35.100]  Yes, it's a full color.
[2:37:35.100 --> 2:37:37.100]  It's the astronaut coming over the moon.
[2:37:37.100 --> 2:37:39.100]  It says operation 51st state
[2:37:39.100 --> 2:37:41.100]  space force on the right arm.
[2:37:41.100 --> 2:37:43.100]  The back news wars.
[2:37:43.100 --> 2:37:45.100]  It is amazing.
[2:37:45.100 --> 2:37:47.100]  No reviews yet.
[2:37:47.100 --> 2:37:49.100]  But the shirt, I did this so quick today.
[2:37:49.100 --> 2:37:51.100]  It can't be 1995. It's a designer shirt.
[2:37:51.100 --> 2:37:53.100]  The printing cost more of the shirt cost $10.
[2:37:53.100 --> 2:37:55.100]  The printing is going to cost $3.
[2:37:55.100 --> 2:37:57.100]  I told them I moved quick. It's getting printed right now.
[2:37:57.100 --> 2:37:59.100]  It's going to be 29.95.
[2:37:59.100 --> 2:38:01.100]  I guess you can get your order in. It's 90.95.
[2:38:01.100 --> 2:38:03.100]  But that's how we do these plugs here.
[2:38:03.100 --> 2:38:05.100]  Things are moving quick.
[2:38:05.100 --> 2:38:07.100]  But I can't sell shirts that cost me 13 bucks anymore for $9.95.
[2:38:07.100 --> 2:38:09.100]  One of those is the space force.
[2:38:09.100 --> 2:38:11.100]  This is printed America, designed in America.
[2:38:11.100 --> 2:38:13.100]  Space force. Got the American flag
[2:38:13.100 --> 2:38:15.100]  in full color, infowars.com.
[2:38:15.100 --> 2:38:17.100]  This baby cost me $13.
[2:38:17.100 --> 2:38:19.100]  It's $19.95 right now.
[2:38:19.100 --> 2:38:21.100]  And when the supplies are gone, it's gone.
[2:38:21.100 --> 2:38:23.100]  I told you it's a designer shirt.
[2:38:23.100 --> 2:38:25.100]  When this shirt is gone, it's gone.
[2:38:25.100 --> 2:38:27.100]  We'll have a new design, but it's going to be massively different.
[2:38:27.100 --> 2:38:29.100]  I designed this baby.
[2:38:29.100 --> 2:38:31.100]  Made in 1776, infowars.com shirt.
[2:38:31.100 --> 2:38:33.100]  These have been very, very popular.
[2:38:33.100 --> 2:38:35.100]  When it's gone, it's gone.
[2:38:35.100 --> 2:38:37.100]  And yes, it was 29.95.
[2:38:37.100 --> 2:38:39.100]  It's $19.95 right now.
[2:38:39.100 --> 2:38:41.100]  But it cost me 13 bucks.
[2:38:41.100 --> 2:38:43.100]  I'm making $7 on this. I got to sell a lot of these.
[2:38:43.100 --> 2:38:45.100]  But it's about getting the word out
[2:38:45.100 --> 2:38:47.100]  and about having a pro-human future,
[2:38:47.100 --> 2:38:49.100]  because they were going to kill the human space program,
[2:38:49.100 --> 2:38:51.100]  hurt us all in the silicon crap.
[2:38:51.100 --> 2:38:53.100]  I'm seeing a pro-human future.
[2:38:53.100 --> 2:38:55.100]  Operation 51st State pre-order years now.
[2:38:55.100 --> 2:38:57.100]  They'll be shipping out within two weeks.
[2:38:57.100 --> 2:38:59.100]  They'll be shipping out to America's back designer shirt
[2:38:59.100 --> 2:39:01.100]  while supplies last.
[2:39:01.100 --> 2:39:03.100]  Because when they're gone, they're gone forever.
[2:39:03.100 --> 2:39:05.100]  Eddie, would you like to talk about this?
[2:39:05.100 --> 2:39:07.100]  I think you should call it Operation State 51.
[2:39:07.100 --> 2:39:09.100]  Operation State 51.
[2:39:09.100 --> 2:39:11.100]  Yeah, change it.
[2:39:11.100 --> 2:39:13.100]  Okay, we'll have two different versions.
[2:39:13.100 --> 2:39:15.100]  Tell me what to do. I believe you.
[2:39:15.100 --> 2:39:17.100]  I'm telling you.
[2:39:17.100 --> 2:39:19.100]  Because the S-24, it's...
[2:39:19.100 --> 2:39:21.100]  Area 51, State 51.
[2:39:21.100 --> 2:39:23.100]  I see it. I like it.
[2:39:23.100 --> 2:39:25.100]  Operation 51st State.
[2:39:25.100 --> 2:39:27.100]  Operation State 51.
[2:39:27.100 --> 2:39:29.100]  Trust me.
[2:39:29.100 --> 2:39:31.100]  I say what you do, you put it out to the people.
[2:39:31.100 --> 2:39:33.100]  Let the people decide.
[2:39:33.100 --> 2:39:35.100]  I want to pull in Kit Daniel's article
[2:39:35.100 --> 2:39:37.100]  about what should the operation be called.
[2:39:37.100 --> 2:39:39.100]  And so it should be
[2:39:39.100 --> 2:39:41.100]  said again.
[2:39:41.100 --> 2:39:43.100]  Project State 51.
[2:39:43.100 --> 2:39:45.100]  Project State 51.
[2:39:45.100 --> 2:39:47.100]  Operation 51st State.
[2:39:47.100 --> 2:39:49.100]  No, you kill that one.
[2:39:49.100 --> 2:39:51.100]  No, dude, let him vote.
[2:39:51.100 --> 2:39:53.100]  This is a democracy.
[2:39:53.100 --> 2:39:55.100]  You're like a big textbook.
[2:39:55.100 --> 2:39:57.100]  It's China, baby. This is China.
[2:39:57.100 --> 2:39:59.100]  When I'm in town, it's China.
[2:39:59.100 --> 2:40:01.100]  Okay, you hear me?
[2:40:01.100 --> 2:40:03.100]  Absolutely, my friend.
[2:40:03.100 --> 2:40:05.100]  It's a funny idea, good idea.
[2:40:05.100 --> 2:40:07.100]  I think it's brilliant.
[2:40:07.100 --> 2:40:09.100]  I think, dude, your artist is on fire.
[2:40:09.100 --> 2:40:11.100]  Well, thank you.
[2:40:11.100 --> 2:40:13.100]  Good drawing.
[2:40:13.100 --> 2:40:15.100]  I had the idea, but the crew is amazing back there.
[2:40:15.100 --> 2:40:17.100]  Especially Robert, they're all amazing.
[2:40:17.100 --> 2:40:19.100]  They're all very nice.
[2:40:19.100 --> 2:40:21.100]  But you gotta have three choices.
[2:40:21.100 --> 2:40:23.100]  Project 51st State.
[2:40:23.100 --> 2:40:25.100]  Project State 51.
[2:40:25.100 --> 2:40:27.100]  State 51.
[2:40:27.100 --> 2:40:29.100]  That's it. That's all. That's it, okay?
[2:40:29.100 --> 2:40:31.100]  I don't want to hear it.
[2:40:31.100 --> 2:40:33.100]  Uh-oh.
[2:40:33.100 --> 2:40:35.100]  I'll choke you right here.
[2:40:35.100 --> 2:40:37.100]  Hey, Joe's afraid to let you do it. Go ahead and choke me up.
[2:40:37.100 --> 2:40:39.100]  Don't do it.
[2:40:39.100 --> 2:40:41.100]  I'm gonna have to.
[2:40:41.100 --> 2:40:43.100]  I'm big. I weigh 270 pounds, though.
[2:40:43.100 --> 2:40:45.100]  Just hold me.
[2:40:45.100 --> 2:40:47.100]  No, don't do it.
[2:40:47.100 --> 2:40:49.100]  He's out.
[2:40:49.100 --> 2:40:51.100]  He's out.
[2:40:51.100 --> 2:40:53.100]  He's out.
[2:40:53.100 --> 2:40:55.100]  I dreamed Eddie Bravo choked me out.
[2:40:55.100 --> 2:40:57.100]  I got choked.
[2:40:57.100 --> 2:40:59.100]  Was it a wet dream?
[2:40:59.100 --> 2:41:01.100]  How about I choke Eddie Bravo out?
[2:41:01.100 --> 2:41:03.100]  Hell no. Hell no.
[2:41:03.100 --> 2:41:05.100]  How many times have you been choked out?
[2:41:05.100 --> 2:41:07.100]  Unconscious?
[2:41:07.100 --> 2:41:09.100]  Ten times, maybe.
[2:41:09.100 --> 2:41:11.100]  Who's the best overall Jiu-Jitsu guy in the world?
[2:41:11.100 --> 2:41:13.100]  Who's the best overall Jiu-Jitsu guy in the world?
[2:41:15.100 --> 2:41:17.100]  My instructor, Jean-Jacques Machado
[2:41:17.100 --> 2:41:19.100]  and Marcelo Garcia.
[2:41:19.100 --> 2:41:21.100]  They're the all-time greatest.
[2:41:21.100 --> 2:41:23.100]  But if you were in the movie, which is based on true story,
[2:41:23.100 --> 2:41:25.100]  the right stuff, you'd say, well, it's me, of course.
[2:41:25.100 --> 2:41:27.100]  You.
[2:41:27.100 --> 2:41:29.100]  Well, yeah, I don't want to say me, though,
[2:41:29.100 --> 2:41:31.100]  because that sounds kind of...
[2:41:31.100 --> 2:41:33.100]  But they really are.
[2:41:33.100 --> 2:41:35.100]  What makes them next level?
[2:41:35.100 --> 2:41:37.100]  No matter what you do, you're gonna tap.
[2:41:37.100 --> 2:41:39.100]  That's it.
[2:41:39.100 --> 2:41:41.100]  I can tell the UFC how to double their audience right now.
[2:41:41.100 --> 2:41:43.100]  How?
[2:41:43.100 --> 2:41:45.100]  There's a lot of ways.
[2:41:45.100 --> 2:41:47.100]  I don't know if you've ever seen each other.
[2:41:47.100 --> 2:41:49.100]  Okay.
[2:41:49.100 --> 2:41:51.100]  But I'm up for that.
[2:41:51.100 --> 2:41:53.100]  But you could have the biggest guys,
[2:41:53.100 --> 2:41:55.100]  like Brock Lesnar at his peak or whatever,
[2:41:55.100 --> 2:41:57.100]  and then they'll fight, like, say,
[2:41:57.100 --> 2:41:59.100]  three lightweights at the same time.
[2:41:59.100 --> 2:42:01.100]  Yep. Let's do it.
[2:42:01.100 --> 2:42:03.100]  That would double viewers.
[2:42:03.100 --> 2:42:05.100]  Oh, hell yeah. Add some pit bulls.
[2:42:05.100 --> 2:42:07.100]  Shit.
[2:42:07.100 --> 2:42:09.100]  Break records.
[2:42:09.100 --> 2:42:11.100]  What do you think of this bare-knuckle fighting?
[2:42:11.100 --> 2:42:13.100]  I haven't really watched it,
[2:42:13.100 --> 2:42:15.100]  but it's boxing, you know,
[2:42:15.100 --> 2:42:17.100]  with a lot more cuts.
[2:42:17.100 --> 2:42:19.100]  Old-school boxing.
[2:42:19.100 --> 2:42:21.100]  I love it.
[2:42:21.100 --> 2:42:23.100]  I just like Jiu-Jitsu.
[2:42:23.100 --> 2:42:25.100]  I like Jiu-Jitsu.
[2:42:25.100 --> 2:42:27.100]  Oh, nice.
[2:42:27.100 --> 2:42:29.100]  You ever, like, dirty street fighting?
[2:42:29.100 --> 2:42:31.100]  With the ladies, like, little Jiu-Jitsu in the bedroom?
[2:42:31.100 --> 2:42:33.100]  Like, you know, a little...
[2:42:33.100 --> 2:42:35.100]  Say that again?
[2:42:35.100 --> 2:42:37.100]  Little Jiu-Jitsu in the bedroom.
[2:42:37.100 --> 2:42:39.100]  I know. We don't do that.
[2:42:39.100 --> 2:42:41.100]  That's good.
[2:42:41.100 --> 2:42:43.100]  No blood to this.
[2:42:43.100 --> 2:42:45.100]  Come on, come on, come on!
[2:42:45.100 --> 2:42:47.100]  Come on up.
[2:42:47.100 --> 2:42:49.100]  Come on up.
[2:42:49.100 --> 2:42:51.100]  I got news you never got to die.
[2:42:55.100 --> 2:42:57.100]  We have entered a great time of change.
[2:42:57.100 --> 2:42:59.100]  The social engineers
[2:42:59.100 --> 2:43:01.100]  who serve Satan
[2:43:01.100 --> 2:43:03.100]  who are in control of this planet
[2:43:03.100 --> 2:43:05.100]  believe that if they can organize
[2:43:05.100 --> 2:43:07.100]  enough crises that they control,
[2:43:07.100 --> 2:43:09.100]  they can terrorize the
[2:43:09.100 --> 2:43:11.100]  planet into accepting
[2:43:11.100 --> 2:43:13.100]  a tyrannical corporate world government
[2:43:13.100 --> 2:43:15.100]  known as a technocracy in their own words
[2:43:15.100 --> 2:43:17.100]  that will manage and control
[2:43:17.100 --> 2:43:19.100]  and manipulate every facet of our lives.
[2:43:19.100 --> 2:43:21.100]  At first,
[2:43:21.100 --> 2:43:23.100]  they give you just a few basic things to do.
[2:43:23.100 --> 2:43:25.100]  Don't support Trump. Don't promote Alex Jones.
[2:43:25.100 --> 2:43:27.100]  And once you've submitted to that,
[2:43:27.100 --> 2:43:29.100]  well, don't say mother and father.
[2:43:29.100 --> 2:43:31.100]  Well, let us sterilize your children.
[2:43:31.100 --> 2:43:33.100]  Take these force inoculations.
[2:43:33.100 --> 2:43:35.100]  Here, take this Prozac pill.
[2:43:35.100 --> 2:43:37.100]  Here, smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[2:43:37.100 --> 2:43:39.100]  Don't be a Christian.
[2:43:39.100 --> 2:43:41.100]  This is truly the market-to-be system
[2:43:41.100 --> 2:43:43.100]  and we're on air right now covering it.
[2:43:43.100 --> 2:43:45.100]  And you're awake. You're involved. You're engaged.
[2:43:45.100 --> 2:43:47.100]  You're an ambassador of truth, so I'm begging you
[2:43:47.100 --> 2:43:49.100]  for yourself and myself and my family
[2:43:49.100 --> 2:43:51.100]  and your family.

[2:44:07.100 --> 2:44:09.100]  Band.video is the answer
[2:44:09.100 --> 2:44:11.100]  for libertarians, conservatives,
[2:44:11.100 --> 2:44:13.100]  nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life,
[2:44:13.100 --> 2:44:15.100]  pro-human individuals
[2:44:15.100 --> 2:44:17.100]  to have their own platform
[2:44:17.100 --> 2:44:19.100]  where videos banned by YouTube,
[2:44:19.100 --> 2:44:21.100]  Facebook and Twitter are still available.
[2:44:21.100 --> 2:44:26.500]  home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson band videos. We are
[2:44:26.500 --> 2:44:31.300]  building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted and where a growing
[2:44:31.300 --> 2:44:37.300]  list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down,
[2:44:37.300 --> 2:44:42.340]  free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood
[2:44:42.340 --> 2:44:49.260]  scum and the globalist. Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band.video. America
[2:44:49.260 --> 2:44:55.700]  and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[2:44:55.700 --> 2:45:01.460]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental
[2:45:01.460 --> 2:45:07.940]  blackmail ring using pedophilia. I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and
[2:45:07.940 --> 2:45:12.620]  organ harvesting. I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive
[2:45:12.620 --> 2:45:17.780]  after they were born for their organs to be harvested. I was the first to warn you along
[2:45:17.780 --> 2:45:23.180]  with Paul Watson and infowars.com 15 years ago that Google was using microphones and
[2:45:23.180 --> 2:45:30.420]  hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues.
[2:45:30.420 --> 2:45:34.860]  Like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy,
[2:45:34.860 --> 2:45:38.580]  that our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese on every
[2:45:38.580 --> 2:45:43.460]  one of these issues and many others. We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on
[2:45:43.460 --> 2:45:48.100]  the planetary scale. That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why
[2:45:48.100 --> 2:45:53.340]  you are more critical than ever to support the infowar. Please support the infowar however
[2:45:53.340 --> 2:45:57.340]  you can.
[2:45:57.340 --> 2:46:05.820]  The last week and a half we've been running two specials that are the best deals in our
[2:46:05.820 --> 2:46:13.220]  history. 75% off the total gut health combo pack. That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 different
[2:46:13.220 --> 2:46:19.540]  products at over 15% off. It's incredible. We also have the Dust Till Dawn Infowars
[2:46:19.540 --> 2:46:23.340]  AMP impact which makes it easy to take it in the morning and take it in the evening.
[2:46:23.340 --> 2:46:28.860]  13 different key capsules that are incredible. You want to supercharge your life? This helps
[2:46:28.860 --> 2:46:32.460]  you remember to do it and the results for myself and many others have been nothing less
[2:46:32.460 --> 2:46:36.620]  than astounding. Plus, you can't beat it. It funds the information war. You have absolutely
[2:46:36.620 --> 2:46:43.540]  nothing to lose but not taking action. Believe you, the deep state, Hillary, Obama, the NWO,
[2:46:43.540 --> 2:46:46.980]  they hope you don't support infowars in this urgent moment when they're trying to shut
[2:46:46.980 --> 2:46:50.780]  us down. So we've got a whole bunch of other specials running as well. Check them out.
[2:46:50.780 --> 2:46:58.780]  They're all about to end infowarsstore.com.
[2:46:58.780 --> 2:47:03.780]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:03.780 --> 2:47:14.220]  All right, they're going to be back tomorrow and we're going to get really serious because
[2:47:14.220 --> 2:47:17.620]  there are hundreds of issues. We've got a bunch of big ones right now. Alex Jones here
[2:47:17.620 --> 2:47:23.020]  back live with the host of 10 full hat podcast, Eddie Bravo and of course, Sam Tripoli. And
[2:47:23.020 --> 2:47:27.220]  they've got a big show tomorrow night out by the Paramount downtown Austin. It's a good
[2:47:27.220 --> 2:47:32.780]  chance I'm going to be at that. But first off, we talked about this video earlier. This
[2:47:32.780 --> 2:47:36.660]  is what really happened to Epstein, Wink Wink. For radio listeners, you'll hear the audio.
[2:47:36.660 --> 2:47:38.820]  TV viewers will get it. Here it is.
[2:47:38.820 --> 2:47:40.620]  Thanks for trying to cheer me up, boys.
[2:47:40.620 --> 2:47:41.620]  Hey, it up, brother, buddy.
[2:47:41.620 --> 2:47:42.620]  Hey, thanks for you, pal.
[2:47:42.620 --> 2:47:44.620]  I'm so bored in here.
[2:47:44.620 --> 2:47:46.620]  You dressed back in it.
[2:47:46.620 --> 2:47:49.540]  Yeah, if I were you, I'd be hugging my hog all night.
[2:47:49.540 --> 2:47:52.780]  Yeah, I've been doing that all the time.
[2:47:52.780 --> 2:47:55.300]  What do you use for a choker?
[2:47:55.300 --> 2:47:57.020]  What do you mean?
[2:47:57.020 --> 2:47:59.620]  Are you choking your chicken and not choking yourself?
[2:47:59.620 --> 2:48:00.620]  Oh, boy.
[2:48:00.620 --> 2:48:01.620]  Oh, my God.
[2:48:01.620 --> 2:48:03.620]  Of course you're fine.
[2:48:03.620 --> 2:48:06.620]  Yeah, wrap something around your neck, you silly Billy, and get cranking.
[2:48:06.620 --> 2:48:09.620]  Yeah, something that won't break.
[2:48:09.620 --> 2:48:12.620]  Yeah, now start twerking your twinkie.
[2:48:12.620 --> 2:48:14.620]  That's it. That's it.
[2:48:14.620 --> 2:48:17.620]  Don't really lean into it, Jeff. Don't back off.
[2:48:17.620 --> 2:48:19.620]  I'm getting tunnel vision.
[2:48:19.620 --> 2:48:20.620]  Good.
[2:48:20.620 --> 2:48:22.620]  That's good. That's good.
[2:48:22.620 --> 2:48:26.120]  Yeah, that means the high is right around the corner, so keep pushing it.
[2:48:26.120 --> 2:48:28.120]  Yeah, keep pushing it.
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:30.120]  Keep pushing it.
[2:48:30.120 --> 2:48:32.120]  Jeff?
[2:48:32.120 --> 2:48:34.120]  Oh, check, quick.
[2:48:34.120 --> 2:48:35.120]  Bill, hang up.
[2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:37.120]  Yeah, you're in heaven with me now.
[2:48:37.120 --> 2:48:39.120]  Oh, shit.
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:42.120]  Hold on, guys. You can't cuss. You gotta delete them.
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:45.120]  Okay, so people have just saw them on TV, understand what it was.
[2:48:45.120 --> 2:48:47.120]  It's a joke. Tell us who's doing the deep fat.
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:49.120]  Kyle Dunnigan.
[2:48:49.120 --> 2:48:51.120]  He's amazing. He's a comedian.
[2:48:51.120 --> 2:48:52.120]  He's a master.
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:54.120]  Yeah, he's always at the comedy store, and he does that.
[2:48:54.120 --> 2:48:56.120]  He does that on Instagram.
[2:48:56.120 --> 2:48:58.120]  Does he know Trump?
[2:48:58.120 --> 2:49:00.120]  Because that's reportedly how Trump actually eats popcorn.
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:02.120]  I'm not joking.
[2:49:02.120 --> 2:49:04.120]  I don't know.
[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:06.120]  That's what he does.
[2:49:06.120 --> 2:49:08.120]  For real?
[2:49:08.120 --> 2:49:10.120]  Man studies his characters.
[2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:12.120]  That's what he's the Daniel Day Lewis of Deep Fakes.
[2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:14.120]  That's what they call him.
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:17.120]  Yeah, just go on Instagram and look up Kyle Dunnigan,
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:20.120]  and he's got a whole bunch of videos like that that are hysterical.
[2:49:20.120 --> 2:49:23.120]  Yeah, I was told by somebody that hung out with Trump quite a bit
[2:49:23.120 --> 2:49:25.120]  and he has to be really focused all the time.
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:27.120]  He'll get in his theater room or whatever,
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:29.120]  and he'll just be basically in a robe or whatever,
[2:49:29.120 --> 2:49:31.120]  and he actually just throws popcorn in his face.
[2:49:31.120 --> 2:49:33.120]  And it just does that.
[2:49:33.120 --> 2:49:35.120]  I was like, whoa, this guy's no Trump.
[2:49:35.120 --> 2:49:37.120]  That's like inside baseball.
[2:49:37.120 --> 2:49:39.120]  I'm serious.
[2:49:39.120 --> 2:49:41.120]  He's connected.
[2:49:41.120 --> 2:49:43.120]  Yeah, I've been told that by actually two people.
[2:49:43.120 --> 2:49:45.120]  I asked one of the nose-trumpers,
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:49:47.120]  and they go, no, that's actually true.
[2:49:47.120 --> 2:49:49.120]  That's what he does.
[2:49:49.120 --> 2:49:51.120]  He likes to ask food, everything. Trump's something else.
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:53.120]  I'll tell you why.
[2:49:53.120 --> 2:49:55.120]  Not to curry favor with the left,
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:49:57.120]  because they already hate my guts,
[2:49:57.120 --> 2:49:59.120]  because we helped launch Trump and get him in.
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:01.120]  And I love Trump on so many fronts.
[2:50:01.120 --> 2:50:03.120]  He's doing a lot of great things,
[2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:05.120]  going after the pitos and stand up to the chai-coms
[2:50:05.120 --> 2:50:07.120]  and trying to stop the fentanyl coming in,
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:09.120]  and so many things.
[2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:11.120]  But you know a man by his enemies,
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:13.120]  but he told Jeffrey Epstein,
[2:50:13.120 --> 2:50:15.120]  and we can play the clip, but he told him
[2:50:15.120 --> 2:50:17.120]  in the middle of the campaign about three months for the election,
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:19.120]  he said, I don't know who got the WikiLeaks,
[2:50:19.120 --> 2:50:21.120]  but I'm here to tell you,
[2:50:21.120 --> 2:50:23.120]  whoever's got it, fat guy in his mom's basement,
[2:50:23.120 --> 2:50:25.120]  naked in his bed watching TV,
[2:50:25.120 --> 2:50:27.120]  or whether it's somebody else.
[2:50:27.120 --> 2:50:29.120]  Russians, if you have it,
[2:50:29.120 --> 2:50:31.120]  or WikiLeaks, release their emails.
[2:50:31.120 --> 2:50:33.120]  Emails are illegal, there we go.
[2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:35.120]  So that's the point.
[2:50:35.120 --> 2:50:37.120]  And then he does it.
[2:50:37.120 --> 2:50:39.120]  And Julian Assange is all locked up right now,
[2:50:39.120 --> 2:50:41.120]  and the U.S. administration
[2:50:41.120 --> 2:50:43.120]  is charging a bunch of stuff.
[2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:45.120]  They want to put him in jail for life in prison.
[2:50:45.120 --> 2:50:47.120]  The word is there may be a death penalty charge
[2:50:47.120 --> 2:50:49.120]  for espionage going on here.
[2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:51.120]  And that's a load of crap, man.
[2:50:51.120 --> 2:50:53.120]  Trump pardoned his ass.
[2:50:53.120 --> 2:50:55.120]  Good God, you can't say,
[2:50:55.120 --> 2:50:57.120]  Assange, if you have it, release it.
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:50:59.120]  And then you do it.
[2:50:59.120 --> 2:51:01.120]  Trump told me, Jones, you know, do this,
[2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:03.120]  which Trump said before, keep it up, Alex, great job.
[2:51:03.120 --> 2:51:05.120]  Press the attack. Well, now I'm like, wait, did I do this?
[2:51:05.120 --> 2:51:07.120]  You know, later, like, throw my ass in prison,
[2:51:07.120 --> 2:51:09.120]  and go, I'm sorry, Alex, prison time now.
[2:51:09.120 --> 2:51:11.120]  So, yeah, I got a big problem with Trump on that.
[2:51:11.120 --> 2:51:13.120]  He used to be loyal.
[2:51:13.120 --> 2:51:15.120]  I all hear about Trump was loyalty all day.
[2:51:15.120 --> 2:51:17.120]  Then did Assange, yeah, you want my take on Assange?
[2:51:17.120 --> 2:51:19.120]  Dude, I love that, dude.
[2:51:19.120 --> 2:51:21.120]  That was great, Alex. Thank you.
[2:51:21.120 --> 2:51:23.120]  Because not enough people are talking about
[2:51:23.120 --> 2:51:25.120]  it's the death of whistleblowing.
[2:51:25.120 --> 2:51:27.120]  Andrew Yang is getting all mad
[2:51:27.120 --> 2:51:29.120]  because of the comics making jokes.
[2:51:29.120 --> 2:51:31.120]  But then he's like perfectly fine
[2:51:31.120 --> 2:51:33.120]  with putting Julius on
[2:51:33.120 --> 2:51:35.120]  on trial.
[2:51:35.120 --> 2:51:37.120]  It's disgusting, man.
[2:51:37.120 --> 2:51:39.120]  We have to have checks and balances.
[2:51:39.120 --> 2:51:41.120]  We need to check and balance
[2:51:41.120 --> 2:51:43.120]  the military-industrial complex
[2:51:43.120 --> 2:51:45.120]  because when our sons and daughters go into war,
[2:51:45.120 --> 2:51:47.120]  we want them treated with respect.
[2:51:47.120 --> 2:51:49.120]  So that's what these rules of war are about.
[2:51:49.120 --> 2:51:51.120]  Treating people with respect.
[2:51:51.120 --> 2:51:53.120]  And he's the chief executive, and he told
[2:51:53.120 --> 2:51:55.120]  WikiLeaks in statements, and in fact
[2:51:55.120 --> 2:51:57.120]  in posts, this is live now, we post this later,
[2:51:57.120 --> 2:51:59.120]  you know, Jones that goes after Trump
[2:51:59.120 --> 2:52:01.120]  over Assange, or Alex Jones is mad at Trump,
[2:52:01.120 --> 2:52:03.120]  it's a good headline. Add a few clips, guys,
[2:52:03.120 --> 2:52:05.120]  because you can find the clips of him repeatedly saying
[2:52:05.120 --> 2:52:07.120]  WikiLeaks, Russians, whoever.
[2:52:07.120 --> 2:52:09.120]  Well, then you're the chief executive now.
[2:52:09.120 --> 2:52:11.120]  You told him to do it, so it's on
[2:52:11.120 --> 2:52:13.120]  you, Trump, to get his ass out of jail.
[2:52:13.120 --> 2:52:15.120]  Geez.
[2:52:15.120 --> 2:52:17.120]  He got out that rapper. He got that rapper out of jail.
[2:52:17.120 --> 2:52:19.120]  He got that rapper out of jail.
[2:52:19.120 --> 2:52:21.120]  Get him out, man!
[2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:23.120]  I mean, like, dude, he did us a favor
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:25.120]  by releasing these
[2:52:25.120 --> 2:52:27.120]  these evil worship, all the pedo stuff.
[2:52:27.120 --> 2:52:29.120]  And these people get mad at what's
[2:52:29.120 --> 2:52:31.120]  that the e-mails
[2:52:31.120 --> 2:52:33.120]  were leaked, and not what's in the e-mail is
[2:52:33.120 --> 2:52:35.120]  disgusting. It's like someone coming up to you going,
[2:52:35.120 --> 2:52:37.120]  hey, look, we're your significant others doing
[2:52:37.120 --> 2:52:39.120]  and you're like, you're not mad at what they're doing
[2:52:39.120 --> 2:52:41.120]  in the picture, but you're mad that the guy's got the picture.
[2:52:41.120 --> 2:52:43.120]  Dude, get mad at what's
[2:52:43.120 --> 2:52:45.120]  in the e-mail.
[2:52:45.120 --> 2:52:47.120]  It's like the dude's having sex with your wife, and he goes,
[2:52:47.120 --> 2:52:49.120]  look at the video I got, and you're mad at what's on him.
[2:52:49.120 --> 2:52:51.120]  It's like they got to release the songs.
[2:52:51.120 --> 2:52:53.120]  They got the hero. Here's the old songs.
[2:52:53.120 --> 2:52:55.120]  He was
[2:52:55.120 --> 2:52:57.120]  just a flamboyant, smart guy hanging around
[2:52:57.120 --> 2:52:59.120]  on all the leftist circles. From a cult.
[2:52:59.120 --> 2:53:01.120]  Yeah, when he was your kid.
[2:53:01.120 --> 2:53:03.120]  He had an idea. It was obviously some intelligence
[2:53:03.120 --> 2:53:05.120]  agency connections, so they used cults as their fronts.
[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:07.120]  But people had ideas to burn
[2:53:07.120 --> 2:53:09.120]  George W. and to expose those illegal
[2:53:09.120 --> 2:53:11.120]  wars. And some real liberals
[2:53:11.120 --> 2:53:13.120]  thought what was going on was wrong.
[2:53:13.120 --> 2:53:15.120]  And so they used him and this organization
[2:53:15.120 --> 2:53:17.120]  that they helped create him as their spokesperson.
[2:53:17.120 --> 2:53:19.120]  Because he's a ladies man, and he was taking a lot of the ladies out,
[2:53:19.120 --> 2:53:21.120]  a lot of the spies and stuff. No monk, though.
[2:53:21.120 --> 2:53:23.120]  Yeah. You know, he was giving them a little
[2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:25.120]  diggler to the diggly. And so
[2:53:25.120 --> 2:53:27.120]  he becomes this big darling going
[2:53:27.120 --> 2:53:29.120]  after Bush. Well, then Obama gets in, he burns
[2:53:29.120 --> 2:53:31.120]  both Republicans and conservatives. And all these powerful
[2:53:31.120 --> 2:53:33.120]  groups want to use him as the go-between
[2:53:33.120 --> 2:53:35.120]  to expose this group or that group.
[2:53:35.120 --> 2:53:37.120]  But he kind of becomes this conduit
[2:53:37.120 --> 2:53:39.120]  in this clearinghouse.
[2:53:39.120 --> 2:53:41.120]  And then he burns Hillary
[2:53:41.120 --> 2:53:43.120]  and they decide to burn
[2:53:43.120 --> 2:53:45.120]  him. But I don't think it really
[2:53:45.120 --> 2:53:47.120]  even works for intelligence agencies. He was used
[2:53:47.120 --> 2:53:49.120]  as the cutout for kind of a consortium
[2:53:49.120 --> 2:53:51.120]  of groups. It started for good reasons, I think.
[2:53:51.120 --> 2:53:53.120]  And I think he's a hero and a great guy.
[2:53:53.120 --> 2:53:55.120]  But then when they went
[2:53:55.120 --> 2:53:57.120]  after the deep state, and he really did his best
[2:53:57.120 --> 2:53:59.120]  work
[2:53:59.120 --> 2:54:01.120]  helping get Trump in, because Trump had promised change,
[2:54:01.120 --> 2:54:03.120]  you saw
[2:54:03.120 --> 2:54:05.120]  how he was supporting Trump. Now he doesn't, because Trump's
[2:54:05.120 --> 2:54:07.120]  burned him. And it really makes you wonder
[2:54:07.120 --> 2:54:09.120]  about Trump. Is he intimidated
[2:54:09.120 --> 2:54:11.120]  by the intelligence agencies?
[2:54:11.120 --> 2:54:13.120]  Or do they got stuff on him? Because
[2:54:13.120 --> 2:54:15.120]  it's a chicken-you-know-what
[2:54:15.120 --> 2:54:17.120]  action. It's from the chicken-you-know-what
[2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:19.120]  dimension. Chicken-sh-d
[2:54:19.120 --> 2:54:21.120]  dimension. What Trump's doing on that, it makes
[2:54:21.120 --> 2:54:23.120]  me really, really get concerned. Well, I
[2:54:23.120 --> 2:54:25.120]  think that's amazing, Alex. And that's
[2:54:25.120 --> 2:54:27.120]  I couldn't say, honestly
[2:54:27.120 --> 2:54:29.120]  thank you so much for that, because I think
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:31.120]  people like you need to say something. Well, listen,
[2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:33.120]  they're coming after me for a support drop, and I'm glad
[2:54:33.120 --> 2:54:35.120]  I did it. And sometimes I'm supporting, because I'm
[2:54:35.120 --> 2:54:37.120]  being so demonized, I'm pig-headed. I'm like a donkey.
[2:54:37.120 --> 2:54:39.120]  Like a jackass. But
[2:54:39.120 --> 2:54:41.120]  then I'm kind of looking at him not helping people like
[2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:43.120]  Assange, and starting to go, well, maybe
[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:45.120]  red flag laws, and it gets a little
[2:54:45.120 --> 2:54:47.120]  creepy. So it's like, you know, I hate
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:49.120]  the Democrats, and I really hate them.
[2:54:49.120 --> 2:54:51.120]  But it's not like lesser or two evils here. Yeah.
[2:54:51.120 --> 2:54:53.120]  So I'm kind of having to start like one, you know,
[2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:55.120]  I kind of cover my butt up if Trump is around, like, is he
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:54:57.120]  going to try to screw me? What is your take on the
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:54:59.120]  Chinese emails, too? I mean, like,
[2:54:59.120 --> 2:55:01.120]  Hillary, we had talks about that.
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:03.120]  You know, I think Comey even mentioned
[2:55:03.120 --> 2:55:05.120]  when they were interviewing about how, like,
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:07.120]  one went to somewhere they didn't know, but
[2:55:07.120 --> 2:55:09.120]  they knew where it went, and it was
[2:55:09.120 --> 2:55:11.120]  about Hillary's email. Hillary used the email
[2:55:11.120 --> 2:55:13.120]  server as a drop box
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:15.120]  to sell out U.S. intelligence. Obama gave
[2:55:15.120 --> 2:55:17.120]  him the Office of Personnel Management
[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:19.120]  so they could kill all our operatives worldwide.
[2:55:19.120 --> 2:55:21.120]  I mean, they really sold us up to China. The deal
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:23.120]  was done, and part of U.S. intelligence
[2:55:23.120 --> 2:55:25.120]  stepped in, said, okay, we're going to fix America.
[2:55:25.120 --> 2:55:27.120]  This is out of control. The Chi-Coms aren't
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:29.120]  supposed to run the whole thing. We're supposed to make a deal with them.
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:31.120]  And so this is kind of America on its last leg
[2:55:31.120 --> 2:55:33.120]  going, hey, you need to use lubrication to the
[2:55:33.120 --> 2:55:35.120]  Chi-Coms, okay? And the globalists
[2:55:35.120 --> 2:55:37.120]  sold us out. And so that's why they're so pissed,
[2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:39.120]  is all the Chi-Com money owns Hollywood.
[2:55:39.120 --> 2:55:41.120]  It owns the debt, and the Chi-Coms are cracking
[2:55:41.120 --> 2:55:43.120]  a whip, and all their minions are running around.
[2:55:43.120 --> 2:55:45.120]  So all these Americans who are against Trump, and against
[2:55:45.120 --> 2:55:47.120]  the Second Amendment, and against me,
[2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:49.120]  you're literally betting with the Chi-Coms
[2:55:49.120 --> 2:55:51.120]  that have killed 115 million people,
[2:55:51.120 --> 2:55:53.120]  85 million of them, or 86 million of them
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:55.120]  on their mount. It's just unbelievable.
[2:55:55.120 --> 2:55:57.120]  I mean, why would you create
[2:55:57.120 --> 2:55:59.120]  an e-mail that sends
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:01.120]  your e-mails in real time
[2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:03.120]  to a Chinese shipping company
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:05.120]  when we all know that...
[2:56:05.120 --> 2:56:07.120]  But look at Feinstein. All of them have to put the Chinese
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:09.120]  intelligence operative in. It's part of the deal.
[2:56:09.120 --> 2:56:11.120]  We made a deal with China
[2:56:11.120 --> 2:56:13.120]  so the globalists can take their money over there
[2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:15.120]  above the law. That's why all these people
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:17.120]  are going to retire there, these globalists. You can kill
[2:56:17.120 --> 2:56:19.120]  people over there. If you're a party member, you're above the law.
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:21.120]  The party members are all billionaires.
[2:56:21.120 --> 2:56:23.120]  They're party members.
[2:56:23.120 --> 2:56:25.120]  They're marketing families run China.
[2:56:25.120 --> 2:56:27.120]  Absolutely. They have like a thousand generals
[2:56:27.120 --> 2:56:29.120]  that are worth billions of dollars.
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:31.120]  So it's totally predatory.
[2:56:31.120 --> 2:56:33.120]  People say, well, folks use Israel to do corrupt stuff
[2:56:33.120 --> 2:56:35.120]  and run back and forth. Absolutely.
[2:56:35.120 --> 2:56:37.120]  And the Vatican does that because it's its own city.
[2:56:37.120 --> 2:56:39.120]  Jesuits.
[2:56:39.120 --> 2:56:41.120]  The Vatican has its own above the law stuff.
[2:56:41.120 --> 2:56:43.120]  Israel has its own above the law stuff.
[2:56:43.120 --> 2:56:45.120]  The city of London within London has its own above the law.
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:47.120]  DC's its own city above the law.
[2:56:47.120 --> 2:56:49.120]  So you have all these immune cities
[2:56:49.120 --> 2:56:51.120]  they've always created. The globalists are supposed
[2:56:51.120 --> 2:56:53.120]  to take over the American state and then the global
[2:56:53.120 --> 2:56:55.120]  government will fall and it'll be armored city
[2:56:55.120 --> 2:56:57.120]  states that are high tech breakaways.
[2:56:57.120 --> 2:56:59.120]  That's the actual plan. But if China is the ultimate
[2:56:59.120 --> 2:57:01.120]  no laws for the party members,
[2:57:01.120 --> 2:57:03.120]  one side of deals,
[2:57:03.120 --> 2:57:05.120]  they leverage out all the business, they take over.
[2:57:05.120 --> 2:57:07.120]  The globalists made a deal. They married the Chikons.
[2:57:07.120 --> 2:57:09.120]  And so
[2:57:09.120 --> 2:57:11.120]  at the 11th hour
[2:57:11.120 --> 2:57:13.120]  58th minute,
[2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:15.120]  US intelligence had a civil war
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:17.120]  put Trump in. He was really elected,
[2:57:17.120 --> 2:57:19.120]  but not the Russians did it.
[2:57:19.120 --> 2:57:21.120]  US intelligence put Trump in. A ragtag group.
[2:57:21.120 --> 2:57:23.120]  And now they're threatening everybody, attacking their
[2:57:23.120 --> 2:57:25.120]  families. And then if you support them
[2:57:25.120 --> 2:57:27.120]  like me, I'm not in any intelligence group, I'm in
[2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:29.120]  private organic Texan, then they come after you.
[2:57:29.120 --> 2:57:31.120]  I mean, it's been amazing.
[2:57:31.120 --> 2:57:33.120]  I love it actually.
[2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:35.120]  But I mean, it's real total toe of these people.
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:37.120]  And they're a bunch of devil worship pedophiles.
[2:57:37.120 --> 2:57:39.120]  It's a devil worship pedophile group
[2:57:39.120 --> 2:57:41.120]  against us. And that's why
[2:57:41.120 --> 2:57:43.120]  it's Jesus versus Satan.
[2:57:43.120 --> 2:57:45.120]  Saturday.
[2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:47.120]  There are few things in this universe
[2:57:47.120 --> 2:57:49.120]  but I'm here to tell you the products
[2:57:49.120 --> 2:57:51.120]  that in 4WarsLive.com are
[2:57:51.120 --> 2:57:53.120]  we go out, we find out
[2:57:53.120 --> 2:57:55.120]  what is the best rated, best tested,
[2:57:55.120 --> 2:57:57.120]  most loved,
[2:57:57.120 --> 2:57:59.120]  most documented,
[2:57:59.120 --> 2:58:01.120]  substances that God gave us through Mother Nature
[2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:03.120]  and then we make it even
[2:58:03.120 --> 2:58:05.120]  stronger, even better and lower the price.
[2:58:05.120 --> 2:58:07.120]  Now, turmeric has been known for
[2:58:07.120 --> 2:58:09.120]  thousands of years to help with inflammation,
[2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:11.120]  headaches, it's good for the immune system,
[2:58:11.120 --> 2:58:13.120]  so many things. It sells itself.
[2:58:13.120 --> 2:58:15.120]  But
[2:58:15.120 --> 2:58:17.120]  full turmeric only has 3-5%
[2:58:17.120 --> 2:58:19.120]  curcuminoid,
[2:58:19.120 --> 2:58:21.120]  the active enzyme
[2:58:21.120 --> 2:58:23.120]  or system in the plant.
[2:58:23.120 --> 2:58:25.120]  Originally obviously from India.
[2:58:25.120 --> 2:58:27.120]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula
[2:58:27.120 --> 2:58:29.120]  has a 95% curcuminoid level
[2:58:29.120 --> 2:58:31.120]  that it's got other natural things
[2:58:31.120 --> 2:58:33.120]  that help boost it, help your body absorb it,
[2:58:33.120 --> 2:58:35.120]  and that's why people absolutely
[2:58:35.120 --> 2:58:37.120]  love it.
[2:58:37.120 --> 2:58:39.120]  I'm doing this all for people that haven't tried it yet.

[2:59:21.120 --> 2:59:23.120]  have been nothing less than astounding.

[2:59:25.120 --> 2:59:27.120]  You have absolutely nothing to lose
[2:59:27.120 --> 2:59:29.120]  but not taking action.
[2:59:29.120 --> 2:59:31.120]  Believe you, the Deke State, Hillary,
[2:59:31.120 --> 2:59:33.120]  Obama, the NWO,
[2:59:33.120 --> 2:59:35.120]  they hope you don't support Infowars
[2:59:35.120 --> 2:59:37.120]  in this urgent moment when they're trying to shut us down.
[2:59:37.120 --> 2:59:39.120]  So we've got a whole bunch of other specials running as well.
[2:59:39.120 --> 2:59:41.120]  Check them out. They're all about to end
[2:59:41.120 --> 3:00:09.120]  the day.
[3:00:09.120 --> 3:00:11.120]  I love that tattoo.
[3:00:11.120 --> 3:00:13.120]  You get a shot of that?
[3:00:13.120 --> 3:00:15.120]  My first amendment, man.
[3:00:15.120 --> 3:00:17.120]  First amendment, man. That is awesome.
[3:00:17.120 --> 3:00:19.120]  I'm going to get second amendment right here on the other arm.
[3:00:19.120 --> 3:00:21.120]  Sam Trippley.
[3:00:21.120 --> 3:00:23.120]  What are we talking about during the break?
[3:00:23.120 --> 3:00:25.120]  Paul Watson's coming up, taking over.
[3:00:25.120 --> 3:00:27.120]  You guys got your show.
[3:00:27.120 --> 3:00:29.120]  We were talking about your website.
[3:00:29.120 --> 3:00:31.120]  Keep saying guys need to plug yourselves.
[3:00:31.120 --> 3:00:33.120]  How do folks find you?
[3:00:33.120 --> 3:00:35.120]  I shot a special. I shot two specials.
[3:00:35.120 --> 3:00:37.120]  It's called Live from the Viper Room in LA.
[3:00:37.120 --> 3:00:39.120]  You can find them both for free.
[3:00:39.120 --> 3:00:41.120]  Just go to SamTrippley.com
[3:00:41.120 --> 3:00:43.120]  and they're both right there.
[3:00:43.120 --> 3:00:45.120]  I get shadow banned on YouTube.
[3:00:45.120 --> 3:00:47.120]  So sometimes those are hard to find.
[3:00:47.120 --> 3:00:49.120]  Go to SamTrippley.com.
[3:00:49.120 --> 3:00:51.120]  One's 35 minutes.
[3:00:51.120 --> 3:00:53.120]  The other one's 42 minutes.
[3:00:53.120 --> 3:00:55.120]  And it's all yours.
[3:00:55.120 --> 3:00:57.120]  If you scroll down just a little bit,
[3:00:57.120 --> 3:00:59.120]  you could see it.
[3:00:59.120 --> 3:01:01.120]  There's that's Armageddon because I'm Armenian
[3:01:01.120 --> 3:01:03.120]  and then you see what the other one is.
[3:01:03.120 --> 3:01:05.120]  I didn't know you were Armenian.
[3:01:05.120 --> 3:01:07.120]  It's the first time that the young turds did I.
[3:01:07.120 --> 3:01:09.120]  The worst part is that she's Armenian.
[3:01:09.120 --> 3:01:11.120]  She's Armenian.
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:13.120]  And she's trying to act like the right's going out there.
[3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:15.120]  No. The Armenian community is going out there.
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:17.120]  And he even admits that.
[3:01:17.120 --> 3:01:19.120]  You know the genocide happened
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:21.120]  and you still use that name.
[3:01:21.120 --> 3:01:23.120]  It's disgusting.
[3:01:23.120 --> 3:01:25.120]  It's disgusting.
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:27.120]  Didn't like half the Armenians get killed.
[3:01:27.120 --> 3:01:29.120]  Dude, a million of us.
[3:01:29.120 --> 3:01:31.120]  My great-grandfathers, brothers and sisters
[3:01:31.120 --> 3:01:33.120]  got shot down in front of them.
[3:01:33.120 --> 3:01:35.120]  It was a direct descendant
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:37.120]  of a man who lost his
[3:01:37.120 --> 3:01:39.120]  and then he names it after the militia
[3:01:39.120 --> 3:01:41.120]  that did it, the young turds.
[3:01:41.120 --> 3:01:43.120]  He knew what he was doing, dude.
[3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:45.120]  And you know you're wrong.
[3:01:45.120 --> 3:01:47.120]  And again, that was Muslims killing Christians.
[3:01:47.120 --> 3:01:49.120]  Yeah, we could get into Gazarians
[3:01:49.120 --> 3:01:51.120]  but that's another story.
[3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:53.120]  That's another story.
[3:01:53.120 --> 3:01:55.120]  But yeah, it's real.
[3:01:55.120 --> 3:01:57.120]  And it's like, hey, guess what happened to the Armenians
[3:01:57.120 --> 3:01:59.120]  right before that.
[3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:01.120]  Oh, they took all their guns again.
[3:02:01.120 --> 3:02:03.120]  What happens when you take guns?
[3:02:03.120 --> 3:02:05.120]  Mass genocide happens.
[3:02:05.120 --> 3:02:07.120]  It's not a crazy conspiracy.
[3:02:07.120 --> 3:02:09.120]  It is factual proof truth.
[3:02:09.120 --> 3:02:11.120]  Well, let's get into that tomorrow.
[3:02:11.120 --> 3:02:13.120]  What else do you guys want to hit tomorrow?
[3:02:13.120 --> 3:02:15.120]  What's up with the Simpsons?
[3:02:15.120 --> 3:02:17.120]  Everybody thought they were predicting stuff
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:19.120]  and then they find out they're on that flight.
[3:02:19.120 --> 3:02:21.120]  He was on those flights.
[3:02:21.120 --> 3:02:23.120]  And that's why they tell you about 9-11 before it happens.
[3:02:23.120 --> 3:02:25.120]  That's why they tell you about everything.
[3:02:25.120 --> 3:02:27.120]  What were you saying about
[3:02:27.120 --> 3:02:29.120]  abstaining and blackmailing scientists?
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:31.120]  Yeah, that was the whole job was to get all the top scientists
[3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:33.120]  blackmailed with sex and drugs
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:35.120]  and then tell them we want this done
[3:02:35.120 --> 3:02:37.120]  and now we need you to know about the geoengineering
[3:02:37.120 --> 3:02:39.120]  and let you know about the post-human era.
[3:02:39.120 --> 3:02:41.120]  So are you saying that science can be corrupted?
[3:02:41.120 --> 3:02:43.120]  Is that what you're saying?
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:45.120]  Yeah, no, you don't...
[3:02:45.120 --> 3:02:47.120]  Is that what you're saying?
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:49.120]  The global government is a...
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:51.120]  The new order is the scientific post-human era
[3:02:51.120 --> 3:02:53.120]  separation of society, breakaway civilization, total takeover.
[3:02:53.120 --> 3:02:55.120]  I thought if it said science,
[3:02:55.120 --> 3:02:57.120]  next to it, it was real.
[3:02:57.120 --> 3:02:59.120]  That's fantastic, I get it.
[3:02:59.120 --> 3:03:01.120]  Dude, here's the thing.
[3:03:01.120 --> 3:03:03.120]  There's pseudo-science
[3:03:03.120 --> 3:03:05.120]  and then there's a cult of scientists lying to us.
[3:03:05.120 --> 3:03:07.120]  There is a...
[3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:09.120]  That's shocking.
[3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:11.120]  What is up is really down, dude.
[3:03:11.120 --> 3:03:13.120]  It's not satanist. It's Saturnist.
[3:03:13.120 --> 3:03:15.120]  It's Black Cuba Saturn.
[3:03:15.120 --> 3:03:17.120]  Every single major religion has it.
[3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:19.120]  Every single major religion has...
[3:03:19.120 --> 3:03:21.120]  The three big ones, and you can even throw in
[3:03:21.120 --> 3:03:23.120]  Mormonism.
[3:03:23.120 --> 3:03:25.120]  Everyone has this weird moment
[3:03:25.120 --> 3:03:27.120]  where the religious book is just inserted
[3:03:27.120 --> 3:03:29.120]  well after, well after.
[3:03:29.120 --> 3:03:31.120]  That changes the course of that religion.
[3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:33.120]  Who inserts that book?
[3:03:33.120 --> 3:03:35.120]  That is the question.
[3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:37.120]  And it's probably Black nobility Jesuits,
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:39.120]  homeboy. I mean, it's really just the truth.
[3:03:39.120 --> 3:03:41.120]  And all of them have this story about
[3:03:41.120 --> 3:03:43.120]  some angel coming down
[3:03:43.120 --> 3:03:45.120]  having this incredible...
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:47.120]  giving this knowledge that was so holy
[3:03:47.120 --> 3:03:49.120]  that they couldn't write it down.
[3:03:49.120 --> 3:03:51.120]  It's really nuts.
[3:03:51.120 --> 3:03:53.120]  And it's like each one of these books,
[3:03:53.120 --> 3:03:55.120]  inserted, has something that the other religions
[3:03:55.120 --> 3:03:57.120]  get really angry at.
[3:03:57.120 --> 3:03:59.120]  It's almost like it's done on purpose
[3:03:59.120 --> 3:04:01.120]  to get everybody fighting with each other.
[3:04:01.120 --> 3:04:03.120]  Almost like it's been done before.
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:05.120]  Almost like there's other planets.
[3:04:05.120 --> 3:04:07.120]  Yeah. I mean, dude.
[3:04:07.120 --> 3:04:09.120]  There is a powerful group of people
[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:11.120]  that are getting us all to fight with each other
[3:04:11.120 --> 3:04:13.120]  and you just keep playing into it.
[3:04:13.120 --> 3:04:15.120]  Well, and now they tell us
[3:04:15.120 --> 3:04:17.120]  the end game is a post-human world to exterminate us.
[3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:19.120]  I don't think I'm going to play along with that.
[3:04:19.120 --> 3:04:21.120]  I'm not going to play around with a bunch of
[3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:23.120]  lights going around acting like they know something.
[3:04:23.120 --> 3:04:25.120]  I'm not a flesh light.
[3:04:25.120 --> 3:04:27.120]  I'm a human being.
[3:04:27.120 --> 3:04:29.120]  All right, gentlemen, let's eat some Texas barbecue.
[3:04:29.120 --> 3:04:31.120]  You'll be back tomorrow. Paul Watson
[3:04:31.120 --> 3:04:33.120]  will be back on the other side, infowars.com,
[3:04:33.120 --> 3:04:35.120]  newswars.com. He does a great job
[3:04:35.120 --> 3:04:37.120]  for us there as well and also has summit.news.
[3:04:37.120 --> 3:04:39.120]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[3:04:39.120 --> 3:04:41.120]  It was great heaven. Both of you gentlemen here with us.
[3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:43.120]  Keep your website up. Look at it.
[3:04:43.120 --> 3:04:45.120]  SamTripley.com. Yours.
[3:04:45.120 --> 3:04:47.120]  10thplanetjj.com.
[3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:49.120]  All right. We'll be back with Paul.
[3:04:49.120 --> 3:04:51.120]  Welcome, Watson.
[3:05:19.120 --> 3:05:21.120]  Thank you for joining us.
[3:05:49.120 --> 3:05:51.120]  Right now at infowarslive.com.
[3:06:19.120 --> 3:06:21.120]  Thank you for joining us.
[3:06:21.120 --> 3:06:23.120]  We'll be back on the other side of the show.
[3:06:23.120 --> 3:06:25.120]  We'll be back on the other side.
[3:06:25.120 --> 3:06:27.120]  We'll be back on the other side.
[3:06:27.120 --> 3:06:29.120]  We'll be back on the other side.
[3:06:29.120 --> 3:06:31.120]  Thank you for joining us.
[3:06:31.120 --> 3:06:33.120]  Thank you.
[3:06:33.120 --> 3:06:35.120]  Let's get in the air too.
[3:06:35.120 --> 3:06:37.120]  Man is on fire, running like 10
[3:06:37.120 --> 3:06:39.120]  articles a day, shooting videos.
[3:06:39.120 --> 3:06:41.120]  We haven't even gotten Tredo yet.
[3:06:41.120 --> 3:06:43.120]  We mentioned that he's going to play the videos,
[3:06:43.120 --> 3:06:45.120]  the blackface, the hypocriticalness, all of it.
[3:06:45.120 --> 3:06:47.120]  So much in this fourth hour.
[3:06:47.120 --> 3:06:48.520]  Tonight, Millie Weaver's gonna be right up in the shot,
[3:06:48.520 --> 3:06:50.880]  none of them, and she's got a director's cut
[3:06:50.880 --> 3:06:54.560]  and more of her film that's already on Super Viral.
[3:06:54.560 --> 3:06:56.520]  That is, of course, Love Trump's Hate,
[3:06:56.520 --> 3:06:59.320]  showing really how crazy the leftist are at home.
[3:06:59.320 --> 3:07:02.060]  Hateful they are versus Trump supporters.
[3:07:02.060 --> 3:07:05.080]  The full film's been posted to infowars.com right now.
[3:07:05.080 --> 3:07:06.720]  Might wanna see it, might wanna share it.
[3:07:06.720 --> 3:07:09.520]  It's the last time I saw it, I had like 10 million views.
[3:07:09.520 --> 3:07:11.520]  Clips have millions and millions of views.
[3:07:12.480 --> 3:07:14.760]  Watch Love Trump's Hate viral documentary now
[3:07:14.760 --> 3:07:16.920]  at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[3:07:16.920 --> 3:07:18.400]  Wake some people up.
[3:07:19.480 --> 3:07:21.680]  It's an information war, but first,
[3:07:21.680 --> 3:07:25.400]  we have a petition on infowars.com and yes, it's a stunt.
[3:07:25.400 --> 3:07:27.080]  But I want a pro-human future
[3:07:27.080 --> 3:07:29.320]  and I want people to think about humans
[3:07:29.320 --> 3:07:33.240]  and humans going to space and exploration.
[3:07:33.240 --> 3:07:36.680]  If you look how far we've come from the Stone Age to now
[3:07:36.680 --> 3:07:39.120]  in 6,000, 7,000, 8,000 years,
[3:07:39.120 --> 3:07:40.760]  we've already gotten 98% of the way
[3:07:40.760 --> 3:07:45.240]  towards super life extension, Mars basis colonies,
[3:07:45.240 --> 3:07:47.120]  but there's been a decision made,
[3:07:47.120 --> 3:07:48.320]  have a post-human world,
[3:07:48.320 --> 3:07:50.680]  merge with cyborgs, have a silicon world.
[3:07:50.680 --> 3:07:51.720]  I don't want that.
[3:07:51.720 --> 3:07:52.560]  You don't want that.
[3:07:52.560 --> 3:07:54.320]  So here's the article right here.
[3:07:55.320 --> 3:07:58.960]  Annex the Moon as the 51st state.
[3:08:00.120 --> 3:08:01.800]  Sign the White House petition.
[3:08:03.040 --> 3:08:05.000]  We're the free country compared to the Chotcoms
[3:08:05.000 --> 3:08:06.960]  and others we need to get there and secure it,
[3:08:06.960 --> 3:08:09.120]  not let the UN announce that in this.
[3:08:09.120 --> 3:08:11.920]  52nd state needs to be Antarctica.
[3:08:11.920 --> 3:08:14.960]  It's mainly land and mountains full of resources.
[3:08:14.960 --> 3:08:18.360]  So we need to make the 53rd state Greenland.
[3:08:18.360 --> 3:08:19.400]  We should try to buy it.
[3:08:19.400 --> 3:08:21.000]  That's how we expanded America.
[3:08:22.080 --> 3:08:23.200]  We're told, don't expand.
[3:08:23.200 --> 3:08:24.040]  Don't believe in a family.
[3:08:24.040 --> 3:08:25.400]  You don't have children, roll over and die.
[3:08:25.400 --> 3:08:26.360]  No, we will expand.
[3:08:26.360 --> 3:08:27.880]  So this is a serious petition.
[3:08:28.960 --> 3:08:32.160]  Infowars.com, newswars.com,
[3:08:33.040 --> 3:08:34.720]  Kit Daniels and I put it together.
[3:08:36.080 --> 3:08:37.240]  51st state, let's do it.
[3:08:37.240 --> 3:08:38.080]  Let's announce it.
[3:08:38.080 --> 3:08:39.360]  It's ours.
[3:08:39.360 --> 3:08:42.640]  Why give it to the UN and the globalist and the Chotcoms?
[3:08:42.640 --> 3:08:44.320]  Go sign the petition, get it out.
[3:08:44.320 --> 3:08:45.720]  We're serious.
[3:08:45.720 --> 3:08:47.120]  Infowars.com.
[3:08:47.120 --> 3:08:49.160]  And then separately, you see this shirt?
[3:08:49.160 --> 3:08:51.200]  Told you it's a limited edition.
[3:08:51.200 --> 3:08:54.800]  Space Force, infowars.com, American flag.
[3:08:56.040 --> 3:08:58.040]  The amounts we have now are what we have.
[3:08:58.040 --> 3:08:59.760]  When it's sold out, that's it.
[3:08:59.760 --> 3:09:01.400]  And it's a nice fabric.
[3:09:01.400 --> 3:09:02.600]  The printing's very expensive.
[3:09:02.600 --> 3:09:04.840]  This shirt costs us like 13 bucks, okay?
[3:09:04.840 --> 3:09:08.000]  They sell similar shirts at the mall for $35, $40.
[3:09:08.000 --> 3:09:09.560]  Because I know it's costing them 13 bucks.
[3:09:09.560 --> 3:09:11.080]  They do a big markup.
[3:09:11.080 --> 3:09:12.120]  This is $7.
[3:09:12.120 --> 3:09:13.800]  This is what we're making on this right now.
[3:09:13.800 --> 3:09:16.280]  It was $29.95.
[3:09:16.280 --> 3:09:17.120]  We lowered it.
[3:09:17.120 --> 3:09:18.360]  But this next shirt, we're not gonna be able to lower
[3:09:18.360 --> 3:09:19.920]  because it costs even more.
[3:09:19.920 --> 3:09:21.240]  Drum roll, please.
[3:09:21.240 --> 3:09:22.800]  For TV viewers, you see this.
[3:09:22.800 --> 3:09:24.800]  These are being printed right now.
[3:09:26.040 --> 3:09:28.520]  Operation 51st state.
[3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:32.520]  And we have a poll going right now on the site
[3:09:32.520 --> 3:09:34.280]  about, like Eddie was saying,
[3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:37.880]  should it be Project 51st state?
[3:09:37.880 --> 3:09:40.120]  I think Operation 51st state.
[3:09:40.120 --> 3:09:40.960]  But whatever.
[3:09:40.960 --> 3:09:42.320]  We're gonna, this is already being printable.
[3:09:42.320 --> 3:09:43.160]  Do the other one too.
[3:09:43.160 --> 3:09:44.000]  This is the new limited edition.
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:45.440]  We're gonna have it super color,
[3:09:45.440 --> 3:09:46.920]  big, full print on the front,
[3:09:46.920 --> 3:09:47.880]  space force on the arm,
[3:09:47.880 --> 3:09:50.000]  infill wars or news wars on the back.
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:52.440]  This is the new limited edition.
[3:09:52.440 --> 3:09:54.120]  It'll be in in about a week and a half or so,
[3:09:54.120 --> 3:09:54.960]  made right here in America.
[3:09:54.960 --> 3:09:57.920]  And this, 51st state.
[3:09:58.840 --> 3:10:01.840]  American flag on the moon in gray, black, and white
[3:10:01.840 --> 3:10:04.240]  with the infill or symbol on the right shoulder.
[3:10:05.080 --> 3:10:06.040]  It's fun.
[3:10:06.040 --> 3:10:06.920]  People hate America.
[3:10:06.920 --> 3:10:09.560]  They hate the idea of expanding it.
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:11.560]  Well, if we don't expand the globals, they're gonna expand.
[3:10:11.560 --> 3:10:14.160]  So both those shirts are now available for pre-order
[3:10:14.160 --> 3:10:15.800]  and infillwarstore.com and your purchases
[3:10:15.800 --> 3:10:16.960]  make everything we do possible.
[3:10:16.960 --> 3:10:19.320]  Please don't forget other than that,
[3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:21.040]  a bunch of specials have to end this week.
[3:10:21.040 --> 3:10:23.640]  We saw these hold out a DNA force of 50% off.

[3:10:55.200 --> 3:10:58.320]  and expanding out with summit.news takes it over.
[3:10:58.320 --> 3:11:00.920]  Paul, we love you in the fight.
[3:11:00.920 --> 3:11:02.200]  We love the great work you're doing.
[3:11:02.200 --> 3:11:03.040]  Take it over.
[3:11:03.040 --> 3:11:05.800]  I'll be listening and watching during lunch.
[3:11:05.800 --> 3:11:06.640]  Thanks, Alex.
[3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:07.880]  Yeah, we're continuing to track
[3:11:07.880 --> 3:11:12.080]  this Justin Trudeau scandal fallout over there in Canada
[3:11:12.080 --> 3:11:14.360]  with the election, federal election in Canada
[3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:18.040]  coming up on October 30th, 21st, sorry.
[3:11:18.040 --> 3:11:21.560]  Top story up on summit.news, political scientist says
[3:11:21.560 --> 3:11:25.280]  Trudeau blackface scandal could cost him the election.
[3:11:25.280 --> 3:11:28.320]  And yet you have an army of leftists
[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:29.880]  coming to his defense bearing in mind
[3:11:29.880 --> 3:11:32.120]  these are the same people who literally think
[3:11:32.120 --> 3:11:33.280]  that everything's racist.
[3:11:33.280 --> 3:11:36.440]  There was a story yesterday which I tweeted
[3:11:36.440 --> 3:11:38.440]  and the headline was basically
[3:11:38.440 --> 3:11:41.920]  trying too hard not to be racist is racist.
[3:11:41.920 --> 3:11:43.840]  So now trying not to be racist,
[3:11:43.840 --> 3:11:47.640]  if you don't have the right woke politics is in fact racist.
[3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:52.640]  But Justin Trudeau can literally black up not once, not twice
[3:11:53.680 --> 3:11:55.440]  but three times.
[3:11:55.440 --> 3:11:56.720]  And those are the three incidents
[3:11:56.720 --> 3:11:59.800]  that we're aware of so far there could be more.
[3:11:59.800 --> 3:12:02.760]  And it's just him playing dress up.
[3:12:02.760 --> 3:12:05.440]  There's no racial connotation to it whatsoever.
[3:12:05.440 --> 3:12:07.360]  Now, bearing in mind,
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:10.480]  the first instance of this came out last night
[3:12:10.480 --> 3:12:14.640]  and it was a photograph of Justin Trudeau in 2001
[3:12:15.840 --> 3:12:20.840]  at a Aladdin dress up an Arabian dance night party
[3:12:20.840 --> 3:12:22.840]  and he was dressed up as Aladdin.
[3:12:22.840 --> 3:12:26.080]  If you look at the original cartoons of Aladdin
[3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:27.520]  doesn't really look very black.
[3:12:27.520 --> 3:12:30.200]  If you look at the picture of Justin Trudeau
[3:12:30.200 --> 3:12:32.120]  he's as black as night.
[3:12:32.120 --> 3:12:35.480]  And in fact, somebody commented on this on Twitter,
[3:12:35.480 --> 3:12:38.360]  they said he really went for it, flawless coverage.
[3:12:38.360 --> 3:12:40.720]  This is one of the most proficient applications
[3:12:40.720 --> 3:12:42.640]  of blackface I've ever seen.
[3:12:42.640 --> 3:12:44.840]  They see it right there.
[3:12:44.840 --> 3:12:46.800]  No way he did this only twice.
[3:12:46.800 --> 3:12:49.400]  You see, he's even gone for the hands there as well.
[3:12:49.400 --> 3:12:52.160]  And if you go back to that video which he was just playing
[3:12:52.160 --> 3:12:54.320]  which is in fact the third instance of this
[3:12:54.320 --> 3:12:55.760]  that came to light,
[3:12:55.760 --> 3:12:58.480]  which by the way, Justin Trudeau hid this
[3:12:58.480 --> 3:13:00.720]  from the public and the media.
[3:13:00.720 --> 3:13:02.880]  He was on a plane, they asked him about this.
[3:13:02.880 --> 3:13:05.280]  He did his whole apology spiel.
[3:13:05.280 --> 3:13:07.040]  And they said, was there any other occasions
[3:13:07.040 --> 3:13:08.440]  when you dressed up in blackface
[3:13:08.440 --> 3:13:12.480]  apart from that first time at the Arabian party?
[3:13:12.480 --> 3:13:15.080]  He said, yeah, there was one other time.
[3:13:15.080 --> 3:13:18.040]  And this is the funniest in my estimation.
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:21.240]  The second instance of this that came out
[3:13:21.240 --> 3:13:25.720]  was he dressed up as a black person literally with an afro
[3:13:25.720 --> 3:13:30.080]  and performed the banana boat song, the dayo song
[3:13:30.080 --> 3:13:31.680]  as part of a talent show
[3:13:31.680 --> 3:13:34.560]  while putting on a Jamaican accent
[3:13:34.560 --> 3:13:36.840]  while blacked up again in his college days.
[3:13:36.840 --> 3:13:39.080]  There's the second example right there.
[3:13:39.080 --> 3:13:41.400]  So they asked him, are there any other examples of this?
[3:13:41.400 --> 3:13:43.040]  He said, yeah, there's this one.
[3:13:43.040 --> 3:13:45.120]  That photo then emerged.
[3:13:45.120 --> 3:13:48.160]  But he didn't mention the most egregious one
[3:13:48.160 --> 3:13:50.600]  which is going back to that video you played
[3:13:50.600 --> 3:13:52.320]  which is the third instance
[3:13:52.320 --> 3:13:55.400]  where he literally blacked up, not just the face,
[3:13:55.400 --> 3:13:58.120]  not just the hands, head to toe.
[3:13:58.120 --> 3:14:00.240]  Even the legs were blacked up.
[3:14:00.240 --> 3:14:01.960]  This is some time and investment
[3:14:01.960 --> 3:14:04.240]  that Justin Trudeau's putting into
[3:14:04.240 --> 3:14:07.160]  trying to look like a black person and mock black people.
[3:14:07.160 --> 3:14:10.720]  You see him doing these like exaggerated expressions.
[3:14:10.720 --> 3:14:14.240]  There's no explanation whatsoever behind this.
[3:14:14.240 --> 3:14:16.400]  Doesn't appear to be at any kind of party
[3:14:16.400 --> 3:14:17.720]  because he's just wearing a t-shirt.
[3:14:17.720 --> 3:14:20.920]  It's not a fancy dress party by the looks of it.
[3:14:20.920 --> 3:14:23.800]  And this one, again, he did not even acknowledge
[3:14:23.800 --> 3:14:26.560]  when he did his whole apology spiel.
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:28.560]  So again, the polls are tight.
[3:14:28.560 --> 3:14:29.960]  He's basically neck and neck,
[3:14:29.960 --> 3:14:31.400]  the liberal party and the conservatives
[3:14:31.400 --> 3:14:33.840]  coming up to this October 21st election.
[3:14:33.840 --> 3:14:37.880]  And the defense army that has corralled itself
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:40.640]  around Justin Trudeau over the past 24 hours
[3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:43.440]  is monumental to the point where people,
[3:14:43.440 --> 3:14:45.920]  again, these are the same people who literally say,
[3:14:45.920 --> 3:14:47.520]  if you breathe, it's racist.
[3:14:47.520 --> 3:14:50.640]  Trying not to be racist is racist.
[3:14:50.640 --> 3:14:52.960]  He literally blacked up from head to toe.
[3:14:52.960 --> 3:14:55.760]  He's performing these weird exaggerated gestures
[3:14:55.760 --> 3:14:57.520]  he did it three times.
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:14:59.800]  He did it so proficiently that it looks like
[3:14:59.800 --> 3:15:02.520]  Justin Trudeau is the world premiere expert
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:04.440]  at blacking up.
[3:15:04.440 --> 3:15:08.080]  But it's just a fancy dress party, nothing to worry about.
[3:15:08.080 --> 3:15:10.480]  Like with Governor Northam, again,
[3:15:10.480 --> 3:15:12.960]  basically dressing up as a Klan member.
[3:15:12.960 --> 3:15:16.480]  He survived, the cancel culture didn't take effect.
[3:15:16.480 --> 3:15:18.200]  These are the same people
[3:15:18.200 --> 3:15:21.320]  who will vehemently push cancel culture.
[3:15:21.320 --> 3:15:24.320]  They'll corral themselves into mob outrage.
[3:15:24.320 --> 3:15:26.320]  Again, to get people de-platformed,
[3:15:26.320 --> 3:15:28.000]  to force them into resigning,
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:31.000]  Justin Trudeau is not going to resign, he's going to hang on,
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:33.760]  because leftists have no principles whatsoever.
[3:15:33.760 --> 3:15:35.560]  They have no consistent principles.
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:37.360]  They will rally around him,
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:40.560]  even though he literally did this three times.
[3:15:40.560 --> 3:15:44.560]  On each separate occasion, it only seemed to have gotten worse.
[3:15:44.560 --> 3:15:46.160]  We'll be back in the next segment
[3:15:46.160 --> 3:15:48.160]  to get more into it and other news here
[3:15:48.160 --> 3:15:50.840]  on Infowars 4th Hour, infowars.com.
[3:15:50.840 --> 3:15:53.840]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain.
[3:15:53.840 --> 3:15:56.840]  The hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[3:15:56.840 --> 3:15:59.840]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment
[3:15:59.840 --> 3:16:01.840]  each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[3:16:01.840 --> 3:16:04.840]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News,
[3:16:04.840 --> 3:16:07.840]  blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program
[3:16:07.840 --> 3:16:09.840]  in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[3:16:09.840 --> 3:16:12.840]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels
[3:16:12.840 --> 3:16:14.840]  during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment
[3:16:14.840 --> 3:16:17.840]  used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[3:16:17.840 --> 3:16:19.840]  Not a security IPO or note,
[3:16:19.840 --> 3:16:21.840]  blockchain data centers have approved
[3:16:21.840 --> 3:16:23.840]  an turnkey equipment sale leaseback program
[3:16:23.840 --> 3:16:26.840]  with a 27% annualized lease payment
[3:16:26.840 --> 3:16:29.840]  deposited into your bank account each month.
[3:16:29.840 --> 3:16:31.840]  Don't miss this one, stake your claim today.
[3:16:31.840 --> 3:16:34.840]  Call 800-600-3388.
[3:16:34.840 --> 3:16:37.840]  That's 800-600-3388.
[3:16:37.840 --> 3:16:39.840]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:42.840]  Call now 800-600-3388.
[3:16:42.840 --> 3:16:44.840]  800-600-3388.
[3:16:44.840 --> 3:16:46.840]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners
[3:16:46.840 --> 3:16:47.840]  consult with financial professionals
[3:16:47.840 --> 3:16:49.840]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security
[3:16:49.840 --> 3:16:50.840]  which requires an offering document.
[3:16:50.840 --> 3:16:52.840]  Most of you know that heart disease
[3:16:52.840 --> 3:16:54.840]  is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[3:16:54.840 --> 3:16:57.840]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month
[3:16:57.840 --> 3:16:59.840]  you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[3:16:59.840 --> 3:17:01.840]  At Heart and Body Extract,
[3:17:01.840 --> 3:17:03.840]  we've been helping thousands of people get back
[3:17:03.840 --> 3:17:04.840]  to a healthier heart.

[3:17:18.840 --> 3:17:20.840]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[3:17:20.840 --> 3:17:22.840]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:17:22.840 --> 3:17:24.840]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[3:17:24.840 --> 3:17:26.840]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:26.840 --> 3:17:27.840]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:17:27.840 --> 3:17:30.840]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:30.840 --> 3:17:32.840]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:34.840]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[3:17:34.840 --> 3:17:36.840]  they thought might never be solved.
[3:17:36.840 --> 3:17:37.840]  I can help you too.
[3:17:37.840 --> 3:17:40.840]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:17:40.840 --> 3:17:42.840]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:17:42.840 --> 3:17:45.840]  Call 800-34-NoTax or go to my website,
[3:17:45.840 --> 3:17:50.840]  DanPilla.com, that's DanPilla.com, DanPilla.com.
[3:18:15.840 --> 3:18:17.840]  Now, what I've found is really combining them
[3:18:17.840 --> 3:18:21.840]  is sort of synergistic and transcendent feeling
[3:18:21.840 --> 3:18:23.840]  that I get by combining all your products
[3:18:23.840 --> 3:18:25.840]  and I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them,
[3:18:25.840 --> 3:18:26.840]  I just want to say why not.
[3:18:26.840 --> 3:18:28.840]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known
[3:18:28.840 --> 3:18:30.840]  to be incredible, whether it's turmeric
[3:18:30.840 --> 3:18:32.840]  or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil
[3:18:32.840 --> 3:18:34.840]  or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ-10
[3:18:34.840 --> 3:18:36.840]  and bio-PQQ and all the rest of it.
[3:18:36.840 --> 3:18:38.840]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[3:18:38.840 --> 3:18:40.840]  You take these bases together,
[3:18:40.840 --> 3:18:42.840]  then you have your foundation,
[3:18:42.840 --> 3:18:44.840]  now you can build the big strong temple.
[3:18:44.840 --> 3:18:46.840]  With these products I take,
[3:18:46.840 --> 3:18:47.840]  when I religiously remember to take them,
[3:18:47.840 --> 3:18:48.840]  it makes my life so much better
[3:18:48.840 --> 3:18:50.840]  and then it funds the information war,
[3:18:50.840 --> 3:18:51.840]  which is so critical.
[3:18:51.840 --> 3:18:53.840]  Thank you so much. God bless you.
[3:18:53.840 --> 3:18:54.840]  I know most of you realize this,
[3:18:54.840 --> 3:18:57.840]  but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[3:18:57.840 --> 3:18:59.840]  You are just as important as I am
[3:18:59.840 --> 3:19:01.840]  or the rest of the crew at M4 Wars
[3:19:01.840 --> 3:19:04.840]  and we are the individuals that have done the research
[3:19:04.840 --> 3:19:06.840]  to understand the Globalist Battle Plan
[3:19:06.840 --> 3:19:07.840]  and we know how to take them down.
[3:19:07.840 --> 3:19:09.840]  That's why they're so upset.
[3:19:09.840 --> 3:19:11.840]  Think how far we've come together.
[3:19:11.840 --> 3:19:13.840]  You know, even if we were losing,
[3:19:13.840 --> 3:19:15.840]  we'd be fighting on because it's the right thing to do
[3:19:15.840 --> 3:19:18.840]  against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order
[3:19:18.840 --> 3:19:21.840]  who've really taken the mask off.
[3:19:21.840 --> 3:19:23.840]  The lines in the sand for everybody now.
[3:19:23.840 --> 3:19:26.840]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption
[3:19:26.840 --> 3:19:28.840]  and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[3:19:28.840 --> 3:19:31.840]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience
[3:19:31.840 --> 3:19:34.840]  because you are truly activist in the arena
[3:19:34.840 --> 3:19:36.840]  and without you and your prayers and your word of mouth
[3:19:36.840 --> 3:19:38.840]  and your financial support,
[3:19:38.840 --> 3:19:40.840]  this operation that you built,
[3:19:40.840 --> 3:19:42.840]  that your operation would not be here.
[3:19:42.840 --> 3:19:44.840]  We've got some giant specials running right now
[3:19:44.840 --> 3:19:45.840]  at M4WarsTour.com.
[3:19:45.840 --> 3:19:47.840]  A lot of items, 50% off.
[3:19:47.840 --> 3:19:49.840]  Please take advantage of it at M4WarsTour.com
[3:19:49.840 --> 3:20:16.840]  to help us fight even harder into the future.
[3:20:20.840 --> 3:20:22.840]  There are many conservatives who,
[3:20:22.840 --> 3:20:26.840]  when a conservative is found by the mob outrage crews
[3:20:26.840 --> 3:20:29.840]  who have engaged in some kind of historical hate speech
[3:20:29.840 --> 3:20:31.840]  from 10, 15 years previously
[3:20:31.840 --> 3:20:34.840]  or put out some kind of edgy tweet 10 years ago,
[3:20:34.840 --> 3:20:38.840]  many conservatives immediately join the denunciation.
[3:20:38.840 --> 3:20:40.840]  Of course, he saw national review online
[3:20:40.840 --> 3:20:42.840]  with the Covington High School kids
[3:20:42.840 --> 3:20:44.840]  immediately throw them under a bus.
[3:20:44.840 --> 3:20:47.840]  So half the time, when conservatives are found to have
[3:20:47.840 --> 3:20:51.840]  engaged in this kind of behavior 10, 15 years previously,
[3:20:51.840 --> 3:20:55.840]  conservatives join the chorus of trying to get them canceled.
[3:20:55.840 --> 3:20:57.840]  And now you see in the aftermath
[3:20:57.840 --> 3:21:00.840]  of this Justin Trudeau blackface scandal,
[3:21:00.840 --> 3:21:02.840]  some on the right basically saying,
[3:21:02.840 --> 3:21:04.840]  oh, if you're against cancel culture,
[3:21:04.840 --> 3:21:07.840]  then you should defend Justin Trudeau.
[3:21:07.840 --> 3:21:10.840]  No, you have to hold them to the same standards.
[3:21:10.840 --> 3:21:12.840]  Again, they cave on every single issue
[3:21:12.840 --> 3:21:14.840]  when it comes to leftists being embroiled
[3:21:14.840 --> 3:21:15.840]  in these same scandals.
[3:21:15.840 --> 3:21:17.840]  As soon as anyone on the right is embroiled
[3:21:17.840 --> 3:21:20.840]  in a similar scandal, even though the facts aren't even in,
[3:21:20.840 --> 3:21:23.840]  as they weren't in with the Covington High School kids,
[3:21:23.840 --> 3:21:25.840]  they throw them under a bus.
[3:21:25.840 --> 3:21:28.840]  So again, another example of weakness in the culture war
[3:21:28.840 --> 3:21:30.840]  from boomer conservatives.
[3:21:30.840 --> 3:21:34.840]  And let's not forget this Justin Trudeau blackface scandal.
[3:21:34.840 --> 3:21:36.840]  This was not a youthful indiscretion.
[3:21:36.840 --> 3:21:39.840]  Justin Trudeau was 29 years old.
[3:21:39.840 --> 3:21:43.840]  He was a teacher. This was in 2001.
[3:21:43.840 --> 3:21:47.840]  Even in 2001, it was seen as a little bit dodgy
[3:21:47.840 --> 3:21:49.840]  if you're dressing up in blackface.
[3:21:49.840 --> 3:21:51.840]  Of course, no one would ever do it now.
[3:21:51.840 --> 3:21:54.840]  But there's a tweet from somebody called Andrew Weaver
[3:21:54.840 --> 3:21:56.840]  who I think is in the Green Party over there in Canada.
[3:21:56.840 --> 3:22:00.840]  And he said, let the person who has never done anything
[3:22:00.840 --> 3:22:02.840]  they regret in high school cast the first stone.
[3:22:02.840 --> 3:22:04.840]  Silence. Enough said.
[3:22:04.840 --> 3:22:06.840]  This federal election campaign is in the gutters,
[3:22:06.840 --> 3:22:08.840]  and I am disgusted.
[3:22:08.840 --> 3:22:11.840]  The only thing that's in the gutters is Justin Trudeau's
[3:22:11.840 --> 3:22:13.840]  approval rating at this point.
[3:22:13.840 --> 3:22:15.840]  But again, he wasn't in high school.
[3:22:15.840 --> 3:22:20.840]  He was teaching at this elite college as a 29-year-old man.
[3:22:20.840 --> 3:22:23.840]  He thinks it's a great idea to dress up as Aladdin,
[3:22:23.840 --> 3:22:25.840]  to dress up in Arab garb,
[3:22:25.840 --> 3:22:29.840]  and basically completely black in his face and his hands.
[3:22:29.840 --> 3:22:31.840]  He really went for it, did Justin Trudeau.
[3:22:31.840 --> 3:22:34.840]  But again, this whole army of defense
[3:22:34.840 --> 3:22:36.840]  that's corralled around Justin Trudeau,
[3:22:36.840 --> 3:22:39.840]  lying openly claiming that this happened in high school
[3:22:39.840 --> 3:22:41.840]  and he was just a kid.
[3:22:41.840 --> 3:22:43.840]  It did happen in college,
[3:22:43.840 --> 3:22:45.840]  and it happened again when he was a 29-year-old.
[3:22:45.840 --> 3:22:47.840]  And in the video we saw, it happened again.
[3:22:47.840 --> 3:22:50.840]  That incident, nobody really knows when it happened.
[3:22:50.840 --> 3:22:52.840]  Obviously, he looks young.
[3:22:52.840 --> 3:22:55.840]  But again, this is not a youthful indiscretion.
[3:22:55.840 --> 3:22:57.840]  It's a pattern of behavior.
[3:22:57.840 --> 3:22:59.840]  And it's funny as hell,
[3:22:59.840 --> 3:23:03.840]  because this is the guy who set himself up in 2015
[3:23:03.840 --> 3:23:05.840]  as the king of diversity.
[3:23:05.840 --> 3:23:09.840]  The king of multiculturalism.
[3:23:09.840 --> 3:23:12.840]  And he turns out to be one of the biggest offenders
[3:23:12.840 --> 3:23:16.840]  when it comes to woke politics that the left has ever seen.
[3:23:16.840 --> 3:23:19.840]  In fact, I've done a video about this, which is on YouTube,
[3:23:19.840 --> 3:23:22.840]  called Justin Trudeau Is Cancelled.
[3:23:22.840 --> 3:23:24.840]  Basically, it goes through the fact we know
[3:23:24.840 --> 3:23:28.840]  Trudeau has a history of cultural appropriation,
[3:23:28.840 --> 3:23:30.840]  dressing up in Sikh outfits,
[3:23:30.840 --> 3:23:32.840]  dressing up as a Buddhist,
[3:23:32.840 --> 3:23:35.840]  going to India and wearing all the garb there.
[3:23:35.840 --> 3:23:38.840]  He was under scrutiny for that already,
[3:23:38.840 --> 3:23:40.840]  and that's why he stopped doing it.
[3:23:40.840 --> 3:23:43.840]  But now this is out of the blue,
[3:23:43.840 --> 3:23:47.840]  his political career, especially given the polls,
[3:23:47.840 --> 3:23:49.840]  where he's really slipped.
[3:23:49.840 --> 3:23:52.840]  There was a BBC story which highlighted the fact
[3:23:52.840 --> 3:23:54.840]  Trudeau's popularity has taken a hit.
[3:23:54.840 --> 3:23:59.840]  And since about late 2018, he's completely collapsed.
[3:23:59.840 --> 3:24:03.840]  He's got a disapproval rating, which is now above 60%.
[3:24:03.840 --> 3:24:07.840]  His approval rating is hovering at about just over 30%.
[3:24:07.840 --> 3:24:09.840]  That's worse than Trump.
[3:24:09.840 --> 3:24:11.840]  They constantly build up this narrative
[3:24:11.840 --> 3:24:13.840]  that Trump's completely hated across the country.
[3:24:13.840 --> 3:24:16.840]  He's doing somewhat better than Justin Trudeau,
[3:24:16.840 --> 3:24:18.840]  who is now engaged in yet another scandal
[3:24:18.840 --> 3:24:21.840]  after, of course, having already been engaged
[3:24:21.840 --> 3:24:23.840]  in another scandal regarding corruption,
[3:24:23.840 --> 3:24:26.840]  trying to get a court case quashed
[3:24:26.840 --> 3:24:29.840]  because it was one of his political allies.
[3:24:29.840 --> 3:24:32.840]  So he's literally being caught and had to admit
[3:24:32.840 --> 3:24:36.840]  wearing an afro, adopting a fake Jamaican accent
[3:24:36.840 --> 3:24:40.840]  and singing the banana boat song, A Talent Show,
[3:24:40.840 --> 3:24:42.840]  on top of the Aladdin one,
[3:24:42.840 --> 3:24:45.840]  on top of the video that came out after,
[3:24:45.840 --> 3:24:47.840]  somebody tweeted,
[3:24:47.840 --> 3:24:50.840]  just in Trudeau being a 29-year-old teacher
[3:24:50.840 --> 3:24:52.840]  and browning himself up.
[3:24:52.840 --> 3:24:55.840]  Or the fact that he browned himself up to play Aladdin
[3:24:55.840 --> 3:24:58.840]  arguably the whitest character in the movie
[3:24:58.840 --> 3:25:00.840]  and people have done comparisons.
[3:25:00.840 --> 3:25:03.840]  Aladdin does not look that black
[3:25:03.840 --> 3:25:05.840]  in any of the early cartoons
[3:25:05.840 --> 3:25:07.840]  or any of the earlier Aladdin production.
[3:25:07.840 --> 3:25:09.840]  So he's really on for it.
[3:25:09.840 --> 3:25:11.840]  He's blacked up his hands.
[3:25:11.840 --> 3:25:14.840]  Ezra Levant has offered $10,000
[3:25:14.840 --> 3:25:16.840]  for anyone to turn over that footage
[3:25:16.840 --> 3:25:19.840]  of him performing the Dayo Banana Boat Song
[3:25:19.840 --> 3:25:23.840]  while dressed up in the afro from the picture that we saw.
[3:25:23.840 --> 3:25:26.840]  So we'll see if that video comes to light
[3:25:26.840 --> 3:25:30.840]  or if the CBC in Canada gets hold of it and deletes it.
[3:25:30.840 --> 3:25:32.840]  So this is a huge scandal.
[3:25:32.840 --> 3:25:34.840]  Again, his entire election campaign,
[3:25:34.840 --> 3:25:36.840]  you remember the speech?
[3:25:36.840 --> 3:25:38.840]  After he came out victorious in 2015,
[3:25:38.840 --> 3:25:41.840]  they were talking about what was the thinking
[3:25:41.840 --> 3:25:43.840]  behind such a gender-neutral,
[3:25:43.840 --> 3:25:46.840]  gender-balanced cabinet that you chose.
[3:25:46.840 --> 3:25:48.840]  Because, of course, the fact that you have
[3:25:48.840 --> 3:25:50.840]  a certain type of genitalia
[3:25:50.840 --> 3:25:52.840]  shouldn't mean you automatically get a position.
[3:25:52.840 --> 3:25:55.840]  In the cabinet, it should be based on your proficiency
[3:25:55.840 --> 3:25:58.840]  and your success at serving the people of Canada.
[3:25:58.840 --> 3:26:00.840]  But now, of course, Justin Trudeau
[3:26:00.840 --> 3:26:02.840]  shot back and said, because it's 2015,
[3:26:02.840 --> 3:26:04.840]  thereby ensconcing himself
[3:26:04.840 --> 3:26:07.840]  as the king of identity politics,
[3:26:07.840 --> 3:26:09.840]  which he has used over and over again
[3:26:09.840 --> 3:26:12.840]  to score cheap points.
[3:26:12.840 --> 3:26:14.840]  And that's why this is hilarious.
[3:26:14.840 --> 3:26:18.840]  He's become a casualty of this same PC cancel culture
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:20.840]  that he helped build.
[3:26:20.840 --> 3:26:23.840]  So all these idiot conservatives on Twitter
[3:26:23.840 --> 3:26:25.840]  saying, why are we outraged by this?
[3:26:25.840 --> 3:26:27.840]  We're just acting like the left.
[3:26:27.840 --> 3:26:29.840]  We're acting like snowflakes.
[3:26:29.840 --> 3:26:31.840]  I'm not outraged by it.
[3:26:31.840 --> 3:26:33.840]  I just find it absolutely hilarious.
[3:26:33.840 --> 3:26:35.840]  And the double standard is even funnier
[3:26:35.840 --> 3:26:38.840]  given how they're defending him now on Twitter.
[3:26:38.840 --> 3:26:40.840]  But again, it goes to the point of
[3:26:40.840 --> 3:26:42.840]  celebrities, politicians now,
[3:26:42.840 --> 3:26:44.840]  they're all being subjected to this
[3:26:44.840 --> 3:26:47.840]  progressive, retroactive purity test,
[3:26:47.840 --> 3:26:49.840]  whereby the sins of the past,
[3:26:49.840 --> 3:26:51.840]  even though they weren't considered sinful
[3:26:51.840 --> 3:26:53.840]  at the time that they were committed,
[3:26:53.840 --> 3:26:55.840]  are now sinful and worthy
[3:26:55.840 --> 3:26:57.840]  of somebody being canceled
[3:26:57.840 --> 3:26:59.840]  or at least heavily denigrated.
[3:26:59.840 --> 3:27:01.840]  And you saw that, of course,
[3:27:01.840 --> 3:27:03.840]  with the Me Too movement,
[3:27:03.840 --> 3:27:05.840]  when immediately after that was launched,
[3:27:05.840 --> 3:27:07.840]  a lot of the most vehement, prominent
[3:27:07.840 --> 3:27:09.840]  supporters of the Me Too movement
[3:27:09.840 --> 3:27:12.840]  turned out, and I'm talking about male feminists mainly,
[3:27:12.840 --> 3:27:14.840]  turned out to be actual sexual
[3:27:14.840 --> 3:27:16.840]  assaulters of women.
[3:27:16.840 --> 3:27:18.840]  We went through numerous cases of that
[3:27:18.840 --> 3:27:20.840]  time after the Harvey Weinstein scandal.
[3:27:20.840 --> 3:27:22.840]  So no, this is hilarious
[3:27:22.840 --> 3:27:24.840]  and this is why we should talk about it.
[3:27:24.840 --> 3:27:26.840]  We're not outraged by it.
[3:27:26.840 --> 3:27:28.840]  We're not acting like snowflakes.
[3:27:28.840 --> 3:27:30.840]  We're pointing out the double standard.
[3:27:30.840 --> 3:27:32.840]  The fact that you've got one of the world's
[3:27:32.840 --> 3:27:34.840]  biggest anti-racism virtue signals,
[3:27:34.840 --> 3:27:36.840]  one of the biggest
[3:27:36.840 --> 3:27:38.840]  woke political leaders on the planet,
[3:27:38.840 --> 3:27:40.840]  somebody who literally told
[3:27:40.840 --> 3:27:42.840]  an audience that they shouldn't use the word
[3:27:42.840 --> 3:27:44.840]  mankind because it was offensive
[3:27:44.840 --> 3:27:46.840]  and that they should use the word
[3:27:46.840 --> 3:27:48.840]  people kind, which isn't a word.
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:50.840]  He's now
[3:27:50.840 --> 3:27:52.840]  being caught as one of the biggest
[3:27:52.840 --> 3:27:54.840]  offenders in
[3:27:54.840 --> 3:27:56.840]  the context of woke politics.
[3:27:56.840 --> 3:27:58.840]  So that's why it's absolutely hilarious.
[3:27:58.840 --> 3:28:00.840]  And now a political
[3:28:00.840 --> 3:28:02.840]  scientist,
[3:28:02.840 --> 3:28:04.840]  and this is Max Cameron,
[3:28:04.840 --> 3:28:06.840]  says that the controversy could cost
[3:28:06.840 --> 3:28:08.840]  Trudeau crucial votes in key swing states
[3:28:08.840 --> 3:28:10.840]  or areas
[3:28:10.840 --> 3:28:12.840]  because the voters in those areas
[3:28:12.840 --> 3:28:14.840]  are diverse, so
[3:28:14.840 --> 3:28:16.840]  some of them may not vote for Trudeau
[3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:18.840]  now thinking that he actually
[3:28:18.840 --> 3:28:20.840]  could be, or at least in his past,
[3:28:20.840 --> 3:28:22.840]  a closet racist,
[3:28:22.840 --> 3:28:24.840]  whether that turns, whether that's born
[3:28:24.840 --> 3:28:26.840]  into fruition, we'll wait and see.
[3:28:26.840 --> 3:28:28.840]  I think they're just going to vote for him anyway
[3:28:28.840 --> 3:28:30.840]  because they don't actually care about that.
[3:28:30.840 --> 3:28:32.840]  They're not really offended. They're just interested
[3:28:32.840 --> 3:28:34.840]  in political power.
[3:28:34.840 --> 3:28:36.840]  But according to this political analyst,
[3:28:36.840 --> 3:28:38.840]  it could really impact Trudeau
[3:28:38.840 --> 3:28:40.840]  in the upcoming election because the polls
[3:28:40.840 --> 3:28:42.840]  are already very tight. They were very tight
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:44.840]  with the conservatives edging ahead in some of them.
[3:28:44.840 --> 3:28:46.840]  And now Trudeau
[3:28:46.840 --> 3:28:48.840]  has truly put his foot in it. We'll be back
[3:28:48.840 --> 3:28:50.840]  to talk about it more.
[3:28:50.840 --> 3:29:16.840]  Don't go away.
[3:29:20.840 --> 3:29:22.840]  We'll be back.
[3:29:50.840 --> 3:29:52.840]  The last week and a half,
[3:29:52.840 --> 3:29:54.840]  we've been running two specials
[3:29:54.840 --> 3:29:56.840]  that are the best deals in our history.

[3:29:58.840 --> 3:30:00.840]  the Total Gut Health combo pack.
[3:30:00.840 --> 3:30:02.840]  That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[3:30:02.840 --> 3:30:04.840]  eight different products at over
[3:30:04.840 --> 3:30:06.840]  50% off. It's incredible.
[3:30:06.840 --> 3:30:08.840]  We also have the Dust Chill Dawn
[3:30:08.840 --> 3:30:10.840]  in Full Wars AMP
[3:30:10.840 --> 3:30:12.840]  impact, which makes it easy to take it
[3:30:12.840 --> 3:30:14.840]  in the morning and take it in the evening.
[3:30:14.840 --> 3:30:16.840]  We also have the Dust Chill Dawn
[3:30:16.840 --> 3:30:18.840]  in Full Wars.
[3:30:18.840 --> 3:30:20.840]  It's an easy take it in the morning
[3:30:20.840 --> 3:30:22.840]  and take it in the evening. 13 different key capsules
[3:30:22.840 --> 3:30:24.840]  that are incredible.
[3:30:24.840 --> 3:30:26.840]  You want to supercharge your life?
[3:30:26.840 --> 3:30:28.840]  This helps you remember to do it.
[3:30:28.840 --> 3:30:30.840]  And the results for myself and many others
[3:30:30.840 --> 3:30:32.840]  have been nothing less than astounding.
[3:30:32.840 --> 3:30:34.840]  Plus, you can't beat it. It funds the information war.
[3:30:34.840 --> 3:30:36.840]  You have absolutely nothing to lose,
[3:30:36.840 --> 3:30:38.840]  but not taking action.
[3:30:38.840 --> 3:30:40.840]  Believe you, the Deke State, Hillary, Obama,
[3:30:40.840 --> 3:30:42.840]  the NWO, they hope you don't support
[3:30:42.840 --> 3:30:44.840]  in Full Wars in this urgent moment
[3:30:44.840 --> 3:30:46.840]  when they're trying to shut us down.
[3:30:46.840 --> 3:30:48.840]  If you have any specials running as well,
[3:30:48.840 --> 3:30:50.840]  check them out. They're all about to end
[3:30:50.840 --> 3:31:18.840]  now.
[3:31:18.840 --> 3:31:20.840]  They give you just a few basic things to do.
[3:31:20.840 --> 3:31:22.840]  Don't support Trump.
[3:31:22.840 --> 3:31:24.840]  Don't promote Alex Jones.
[3:31:24.840 --> 3:31:26.840]  And once you've submitted to that,
[3:31:26.840 --> 3:31:28.840]  well, don't say mother and father.
[3:31:28.840 --> 3:31:30.840]  Well, let us sterilize your children.
[3:31:30.840 --> 3:31:32.840]  Take these force inoculations.
[3:31:32.840 --> 3:31:34.840]  Here, take this Prozac pill.
[3:31:34.840 --> 3:31:36.840]  Here, smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[3:31:36.840 --> 3:31:38.840]  Oh, don't be a Christian.
[3:31:38.840 --> 3:31:40.840]  This is truly the market to be system.
[3:31:40.840 --> 3:31:42.840]  And we're on air right now covering it.
[3:31:42.840 --> 3:31:44.840]  And you're awake. You're involved. You're engaged.
[3:31:44.840 --> 3:31:46.840]  You're an ambassador of truth.
[3:31:46.840 --> 3:31:48.840]  You're yourself and myself and my family

[3:34:48.840 --> 3:34:50.840]  Now of course this came out yesterday.
[3:34:50.840 --> 3:34:52.840]  There's a headline up on information
[3:34:52.840 --> 3:34:54.840]  liberation about it. Kevin Spacey
[3:34:54.840 --> 3:34:56.840]  flew on Jeffrey Epstein's Lolita Express
[3:34:56.840 --> 3:34:58.840]  with Bill Clinton. One of
[3:34:58.840 --> 3:35:00.840]  his accusers just mysteriously
[3:35:00.840 --> 3:35:02.840]  died and from what I read yesterday
[3:35:02.840 --> 3:35:04.840]  this is actually the second time
[3:35:04.840 --> 3:35:06.840]  that one of Spacey's accusers
[3:35:06.840 --> 3:35:08.840]  has suddenly died in the
[3:35:08.840 --> 3:35:10.840]  midst of accusations
[3:35:10.840 --> 3:35:12.840]  or in this case a court case
[3:35:12.840 --> 3:35:14.840]  with regard to accusations
[3:35:14.840 --> 3:35:16.840]  allegations of sexual assault against
[3:35:16.840 --> 3:35:18.840]  Kevin Spacey. An anonymous
[3:35:18.840 --> 3:35:20.840]  massage therapist who claims to
[3:35:20.840 --> 3:35:22.840]  being sexually assaulted by Kevin Spacey
[3:35:22.840 --> 3:35:24.840]  has died according to a notice filed
[3:35:24.840 --> 3:35:26.840]  in court by the actor's attorneys. That was
[3:35:26.840 --> 3:35:28.840]  the Hollywood reporter yesterday.
[3:35:28.840 --> 3:35:30.840]  The individual suing as John Dole
[3:35:30.840 --> 3:35:32.840]  filed claims in September 2018
[3:35:32.840 --> 3:35:34.840]  with the allegation of being forced to grab the
[3:35:34.840 --> 3:35:36.840]  genitals twice during a massage
[3:35:36.840 --> 3:35:38.840]  two years earlier at a private residence
[3:35:38.840 --> 3:35:40.840]  in Malibu
[3:35:40.840 --> 3:35:42.840]  and now for
[3:35:42.840 --> 3:35:44.840]  unknown reasons. I don't think they name
[3:35:44.840 --> 3:35:46.840]  the cause of death in this. That might have
[3:35:46.840 --> 3:35:48.840]  actually come out afterwards.
[3:35:48.840 --> 3:35:50.840]  But this individual has in fact died.
[3:35:50.840 --> 3:35:52.840]  Of course what initially set
[3:35:52.840 --> 3:35:54.840]  this off was a claim from a 14
[3:35:54.840 --> 3:35:56.840]  year old who alleged that
[3:35:56.840 --> 3:35:58.840]  Spacey tried to sexually assault him
[3:35:58.840 --> 3:36:00.840]  when Spacey was I think 26
[3:36:00.840 --> 3:36:02.840]  years old. Since then
[3:36:02.840 --> 3:36:04.840]  there have been 15 different
[3:36:04.840 --> 3:36:06.840]  accusers at least
[3:36:06.840 --> 3:36:08.840]  saying that Spacey
[3:36:08.840 --> 3:36:10.840]  attempted to sexually assault them.
[3:36:10.840 --> 3:36:12.840]  He hasn't been convicted. He's
[3:36:12.840 --> 3:36:14.840]  innocent until proven guilty.
[3:36:14.840 --> 3:36:16.840]  What's interesting
[3:36:16.840 --> 3:36:18.840]  is that I almost
[3:36:18.840 --> 3:36:20.840]  met Kevin Spacey. I at least tried to
[3:36:20.840 --> 3:36:22.840]  just a couple of days ago
[3:36:22.840 --> 3:36:24.840]  at an event. And it's
[3:36:24.840 --> 3:36:26.840]  somewhat interesting that Spacey
[3:36:26.840 --> 3:36:28.840]  may feel that he is
[3:36:28.840 --> 3:36:30.840]  another victim of
[3:36:30.840 --> 3:36:32.840]  pencil culture. Because his
[3:36:32.840 --> 3:36:34.840]  career of course at least temporarily
[3:36:34.840 --> 3:36:36.840]  has been completely torpedoed.
[3:36:36.840 --> 3:36:38.840]  He was immediately written out of House
[3:36:38.840 --> 3:36:40.840]  of Cards. Hasn't had any role
[3:36:40.840 --> 3:36:42.840]  since. He released that bizarre video
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:44.840]  on YouTube
[3:36:44.840 --> 3:36:46.840]  as his House of Cards
[3:36:46.840 --> 3:36:48.840]  character in which he basically
[3:36:48.840 --> 3:36:50.840]  you know did this kind of
[3:36:50.840 --> 3:36:52.840]  sociopathic rant to the camera.
[3:36:52.840 --> 3:36:54.840]  Everyone was really freaked out by that.
[3:36:54.840 --> 3:36:56.840]  As Frank Underwood of course
[3:36:56.840 --> 3:36:58.840]  he was actually at an event the other night.
[3:36:58.840 --> 3:37:00.840]  He didn't get a selfie with him. Probably
[3:37:00.840 --> 3:37:02.840]  that was for the best. There you see the
[3:37:02.840 --> 3:37:04.840]  bizarre rant he put out on YouTube a few months ago
[3:37:04.840 --> 3:37:06.840]  in character. But it's
[3:37:06.840 --> 3:37:08.840]  interesting that he may feel that
[3:37:08.840 --> 3:37:10.840]  he is a victim of cancel
[3:37:10.840 --> 3:37:12.840]  culture despite the fact that he was
[3:37:12.840 --> 3:37:14.840]  obviously a big Democrat in the past
[3:37:14.840 --> 3:37:16.840]  very close to the Clintons
[3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:18.840]  numerous times pictured
[3:37:18.840 --> 3:37:20.840]  with them going to events with them
[3:37:20.840 --> 3:37:22.840]  receiving awards from them.
[3:37:22.840 --> 3:37:24.840]  Maybe he thinks that he's been thrown
[3:37:24.840 --> 3:37:26.840]  under a boss by this cancel culture
[3:37:26.840 --> 3:37:28.840]  left now that identity politics is making
[3:37:28.840 --> 3:37:30.840]  them eat their own
[3:37:30.840 --> 3:37:32.840]  over and over again. Maybe he
[3:37:32.840 --> 3:37:34.840]  thinks that one of the ways
[3:37:34.840 --> 3:37:36.840]  he can rehabilitate himself
[3:37:36.840 --> 3:37:38.840]  is by flocking to the
[3:37:38.840 --> 3:37:40.840]  political right which is
[3:37:40.840 --> 3:37:42.840]  obviously more inclined not to just
[3:37:42.840 --> 3:37:44.840]  believe all women
[3:37:44.840 --> 3:37:46.840]  or believe all accusers in the case
[3:37:46.840 --> 3:37:48.840]  of these Me Too
[3:37:48.840 --> 3:37:50.840]  show trials which went
[3:37:50.840 --> 3:37:52.840]  from actual serious
[3:37:52.840 --> 3:37:54.840]  harmful events like the ones carried out
[3:37:54.840 --> 3:37:56.840]  by Harvey Weinstein, actual
[3:37:56.840 --> 3:37:58.840]  serious allegations of
[3:37:58.840 --> 3:38:00.840]  serious misconduct
[3:38:00.840 --> 3:38:02.840]  and it ended up basically women who had had
[3:38:02.840 --> 3:38:04.840]  bad dates naming and shaming
[3:38:04.840 --> 3:38:06.840]  the person with whom they had a bad date
[3:38:06.840 --> 3:38:08.840]  and Zee Zansari being prime amongst
[3:38:08.840 --> 3:38:10.840]  those where it was basically just a date
[3:38:10.840 --> 3:38:12.840]  that went wrong and she accused him of
[3:38:12.840 --> 3:38:14.840]  basically sexual assault
[3:38:14.840 --> 3:38:16.840]  at least sexual misconduct
[3:38:16.840 --> 3:38:18.840]  that's why the Me Too movement lost a lot
[3:38:18.840 --> 3:38:20.840]  of momentum lost a lot of credibility
[3:38:20.840 --> 3:38:22.840]  and a lot
[3:38:22.840 --> 3:38:24.840]  of people were swept up in its wake
[3:38:24.840 --> 3:38:26.840]  was Kevin Spacey one of them
[3:38:26.840 --> 3:38:28.840]  I mean there are 15 different
[3:38:28.840 --> 3:38:30.840]  accusations against him
[3:38:30.840 --> 3:38:32.840]  so the weight of accusation
[3:38:32.840 --> 3:38:34.840]  sometimes needs to be considered
[3:38:34.840 --> 3:38:36.840]  but again he hasn't been convicted
[3:38:36.840 --> 3:38:38.840]  in fact in one of the recent court cases
[3:38:38.840 --> 3:38:40.840]  the person accusing him
[3:38:40.840 --> 3:38:42.840]  basically dropped out and withdrew the allegations
[3:38:42.840 --> 3:38:44.840]  so is Kevin Spacey
[3:38:44.840 --> 3:38:46.840]  fleeing to the safety
[3:38:46.840 --> 3:38:48.840]  of the political right
[3:38:48.840 --> 3:38:50.840]  to offer him some kind of rehabilitation
[3:38:50.840 --> 3:38:52.840]  given that the political right
[3:38:52.840 --> 3:38:54.840]  does rail against
[3:38:54.840 --> 3:38:56.840]  cancel culture
[3:38:56.840 --> 3:38:58.840]  and this kind of toxic Me Too
[3:38:58.840 --> 3:39:00.840]  effect that throws innocent people
[3:39:00.840 --> 3:39:02.840]  on many occasions under the boss
[3:39:02.840 --> 3:39:04.840]  and tries to ruin their careers
[3:39:04.840 --> 3:39:06.840]  for no good reason
[3:39:06.840 --> 3:39:08.840]  very interesting indeed
[3:39:08.840 --> 3:39:10.840]  meanwhile
[3:39:10.840 --> 3:39:12.840]  American Mirror reports
[3:39:12.840 --> 3:39:14.840]  American Airlines mechanic Abdul Majeed Marouf
[3:39:14.840 --> 3:39:16.840]  Ahmed Alani
[3:39:16.840 --> 3:39:18.840]  good old American name
[3:39:18.840 --> 3:39:20.840]  sabotaging plane may have ties to ISIS
[3:39:20.840 --> 3:39:22.840]  an airline mechanic
[3:39:22.840 --> 3:39:24.840]  who claimed he sabotaged the planes controls
[3:39:24.840 --> 3:39:26.840]  because he was disgruntled about union contract negotiations
[3:39:26.840 --> 3:39:28.840]  may have ties to
[3:39:28.840 --> 3:39:30.840]  ISIS because when this was
[3:39:30.840 --> 3:39:32.840]  first reported it was buried
[3:39:32.840 --> 3:39:34.840]  as a disgruntled employee
[3:39:34.840 --> 3:39:36.840]  but now it turns out that
[3:39:36.840 --> 3:39:38.840]  according to federal prosecutors
[3:39:38.840 --> 3:39:40.840]  Islamic State group propaganda video
[3:39:40.840 --> 3:39:42.840]  showing graphic murders was discovered
[3:39:42.840 --> 3:39:44.840]  on this individual cell phone
[3:39:44.840 --> 3:39:46.840]  he's there working in
[3:39:46.840 --> 3:39:48.840]  secure areas on planes
[3:39:48.840 --> 3:39:50.840]  basically this is not
[3:39:50.840 --> 3:39:52.840]  the first time that this has happened in the west
[3:39:52.840 --> 3:39:54.840]  we had a story here out of Breitbart
[3:39:54.840 --> 3:39:56.840]  from 2016
[3:39:56.840 --> 3:39:58.840]  Islamists working at
[3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:00.840]  Paris Charles de Gaulle airport
[3:40:00.840 --> 3:40:02.840]  detectives investigated
[3:40:02.840 --> 3:40:04.840]  CCTV footage from the airport
[3:40:04.840 --> 3:40:06.840]  to determine whether an employee
[3:40:06.840 --> 3:40:08.840]  that the Paris airport
[3:40:08.840 --> 3:40:10.840]  may have helped bring down the Egypt
[3:40:10.840 --> 3:40:12.840]  air flight to Cairo
[3:40:12.840 --> 3:40:14.840]  the Times reported back in
[3:40:14.840 --> 3:40:16.840]  2016 that all employees who work
[3:40:16.840 --> 3:40:18.840]  airside at the airport
[3:40:18.840 --> 3:40:20.840]  security staff personnel etc
[3:40:20.840 --> 3:40:22.840]  baggage handlers are theoretically vetted by police
[3:40:22.840 --> 3:40:24.840]  before they can start work
[3:40:24.840 --> 3:40:26.840]  reality the vetting consists
[3:40:26.840 --> 3:40:28.840]  of little more than checking for a criminal record
[3:40:28.840 --> 3:40:30.840]  and seeing if they are on the French intelligence
[3:40:30.840 --> 3:40:32.840]  agencies list of individuals
[3:40:32.840 --> 3:40:34.840]  deemed a national security threat
[3:40:34.840 --> 3:40:36.840]  of course just like in the UK
[3:40:36.840 --> 3:40:38.840]  many of those individuals managed to get
[3:40:38.840 --> 3:40:40.840]  off that list
[3:40:40.840 --> 3:40:42.840]  and end up working in
[3:40:42.840 --> 3:40:44.840]  airports in fact I think one of the
[3:40:44.840 --> 3:40:46.840]  I think it was
[3:40:46.840 --> 3:40:48.840]  the guy who tried to bomb one of the
[3:40:48.840 --> 3:40:50.840]  underground tubes
[3:40:50.840 --> 3:40:52.840]  an Islamist terrorist turned out to
[3:40:52.840 --> 3:40:54.840]  have been working in security
[3:40:54.840 --> 3:40:56.840]  within the London underground
[3:40:56.840 --> 3:40:58.840]  metro system so they're actually
[3:40:58.840 --> 3:41:00.840]  working within the secure areas
[3:41:00.840 --> 3:41:02.840]  and it seems many of them are now
[3:41:02.840 --> 3:41:04.840]  abusing that position to potentially
[3:41:04.840 --> 3:41:06.840]  try and carry out terrorist attacks
[3:41:06.840 --> 3:41:08.840]  that's very concerning indeed
[3:41:08.840 --> 3:41:10.840]  meanwhile in the UK
[3:41:10.840 --> 3:41:12.840]  police explain why Preston
[3:41:12.840 --> 3:41:14.840]  hate-ranked taxi driver will not be charged
[3:41:14.840 --> 3:41:16.840]  as police have confirmed
[3:41:16.840 --> 3:41:18.840]  they will not be charging a taxi driver
[3:41:18.840 --> 3:41:20.840]  who's recorded slurring a racist
[3:41:20.840 --> 3:41:22.840]  rant threatening to rape Christians
[3:41:22.840 --> 3:41:24.840]  who had converted to Islam or from Islam
[3:41:24.840 --> 3:41:26.840]  Zaheer Hussein was arrested
[3:41:26.840 --> 3:41:28.840]  on suspicion of religiously aggravated
[3:41:28.840 --> 3:41:30.840]  harassment
[3:41:30.840 --> 3:41:32.840]  basically a video was released
[3:41:32.840 --> 3:41:34.840]  but because he said oh I didn't
[3:41:34.840 --> 3:41:36.840]  mean that to go public
[3:41:36.840 --> 3:41:38.840]  where under UK law he's basically
[3:41:38.840 --> 3:41:40.840]  engaging in hate crimes
[3:41:40.840 --> 3:41:42.840]  where if you were saying the same things about Muslims
[3:41:42.840 --> 3:41:44.840]  you would be arrested as a Christian
[3:41:44.840 --> 3:41:46.840]  he's saying the same things about Christians
[3:41:46.840 --> 3:41:48.840]  but because he didn't
[3:41:48.840 --> 3:41:50.840]  intend the video to go public
[3:41:50.840 --> 3:41:52.840]  he's getting off scot-free
[3:41:52.840 --> 3:41:54.840]  no charges whatsoever yet another example
[3:41:54.840 --> 3:41:56.840]  of the double standard
[3:41:56.840 --> 3:41:58.840]  meanwhile African
[3:41:58.840 --> 3:42:00.840]  refugee takes baby hostage in
[3:42:00.840 --> 3:42:02.840]  Wismar Germany
[3:42:02.840 --> 3:42:04.840]  of course Angela Merkel's approval ratings
[3:42:04.840 --> 3:42:06.840]  have plummeted
[3:42:06.840 --> 3:42:08.840]  to the migrant wave she had to acknowledge
[3:42:08.840 --> 3:42:10.840]  that it was a mistake
[3:42:10.840 --> 3:42:12.840]  despite then going back and saying oh no
[3:42:12.840 --> 3:42:14.840]  it was the best thing to do at the time
[3:42:14.840 --> 3:42:16.840]  but now police forces have managed to resolve the hostage situation
[3:42:16.840 --> 3:42:18.840]  in the German city of Wismar
[3:42:18.840 --> 3:42:20.840]  the local foreigners authority
[3:42:20.840 --> 3:42:22.840]  where a refugee from Africa allegedly
[3:42:22.840 --> 3:42:24.840]  of Ghanaian origin would be holding an infant hostage
[3:42:24.840 --> 3:42:26.840]  for around
[3:42:26.840 --> 3:42:28.840]  five hours of course we had another incident
[3:42:28.840 --> 3:42:30.840]  at Milan train station
[3:42:30.840 --> 3:42:32.840]  a couple of days ago
[3:42:32.840 --> 3:42:34.840]  where a migrant attacked
[3:42:34.840 --> 3:42:36.840]  a soldier that stabbed him in the neck
[3:42:36.840 --> 3:42:38.840]  while chanting Alar Akbar
[3:42:38.840 --> 3:42:40.840]  authorities say motive
[3:42:40.840 --> 3:42:42.840]  remains unknown
[3:42:42.840 --> 3:42:44.840]  we'll be back for the final segment of the Alex Jones show

[3:44:52.840 --> 3:44:54.840]  I know most of you realize this
[3:44:54.840 --> 3:44:56.840]  but I'm going to say it again very very clearly
[3:44:56.840 --> 3:44:58.840]  you are just as important
[3:44:58.840 --> 3:45:00.840]  as I am or the rest of the crew
[3:45:00.840 --> 3:45:02.840]  at info wars and we are
[3:45:02.840 --> 3:45:04.840]  the individuals that have done the research
[3:45:04.840 --> 3:45:06.840]  to understand the global battle plan
[3:45:06.840 --> 3:45:08.840]  and we know how to take them down
[3:45:08.840 --> 3:45:10.840]  think how far we've come together
[3:45:10.840 --> 3:45:12.840]  you know even if we were losing
[3:45:12.840 --> 3:45:14.840]  we'd all still keep fighting on
[3:45:14.840 --> 3:45:16.840]  because it's the right thing to do
[3:45:16.840 --> 3:45:18.840]  against the truly satanic forces
[3:45:18.840 --> 3:45:20.840]  of the new world order
[3:45:20.840 --> 3:45:22.840]  who've really taken the mask off
[3:45:22.840 --> 3:45:24.840]  the lines and the sand for everybody now
[3:45:24.840 --> 3:45:26.840]  but you'd already chosen to fight
[3:45:26.840 --> 3:45:28.840]  the corruption and to stand with God

[3:45:30.840 --> 3:45:32.840]  I just want to take time out again to salute the audience
[3:45:32.840 --> 3:45:34.840]  because you are truly activist in the arena
[3:45:34.840 --> 3:45:36.840]  and without you and your prayers
[3:45:36.840 --> 3:45:38.840]  and your word of mouth and your financial support
[3:45:38.840 --> 3:45:40.840]  this operation that you built
[3:45:40.840 --> 3:45:42.840]  that your operation would not be here
[3:45:42.840 --> 3:45:44.840]  we've got some giant specials running right now
[3:45:44.840 --> 3:45:46.840]  at infowarstore.com a lot of items

[3:45:52.840 --> 3:45:54.840]  we have never been closer
[3:45:54.840 --> 3:45:56.840]  to a new world war
[3:45:56.840 --> 3:45:58.840]  with the crisis in the Middle East
[3:45:58.840 --> 3:46:00.840]  with the Saudi oil fields
[3:46:00.840 --> 3:46:02.840]  destroyed half of their
[3:46:02.840 --> 3:46:04.840]  capacity
[3:46:04.840 --> 3:46:06.840]  five percent of world capacity
[3:46:06.840 --> 3:46:08.840]  whoever's behind it
[3:46:08.840 --> 3:46:10.840]  know this there are powerful forces
[3:46:10.840 --> 3:46:12.840]  that want a global conflagration
[3:46:12.840 --> 3:46:14.840]  and now is the time
[3:46:14.840 --> 3:46:16.840]  to be more aware of that than ever
[3:46:16.840 --> 3:46:18.840]  and understand how precarious our position is
[3:46:18.840 --> 3:46:20.840]  here on this planet
[3:46:20.840 --> 3:46:22.840]  and that we are just
[3:46:22.840 --> 3:46:24.840]  mortal flawed human beings that need to
[3:46:24.840 --> 3:46:26.840]  seek God's countenance
[3:46:26.840 --> 3:46:28.840]  God's discernment
[3:46:28.840 --> 3:46:30.840]  and to pray for peace
[3:46:30.840 --> 3:46:32.840]  and to pray for transparency
[3:46:32.840 --> 3:46:34.840]  that the very twisted evil forces on this planet
[3:46:34.840 --> 3:46:36.840]  trying to start a world war
[3:46:36.840 --> 3:46:38.840]  will be exposed to their attempts
[3:46:38.840 --> 3:46:40.840]  at creating even bigger global crisis
[3:46:40.840 --> 3:46:42.840]  will be stopped
[3:46:42.840 --> 3:46:44.840]  now we'll probably avert a new world war hopefully
[3:46:44.840 --> 3:46:46.840]  but it's already
[3:46:46.840 --> 3:46:48.840]  tilting towards a global depression
[3:46:48.840 --> 3:46:50.840]  because of energy crisis
[3:46:50.840 --> 3:47:04.840]  we're covering it all live on the radio at info wars.com
[3:47:20.840 --> 3:47:22.840]  well we know that the left
[3:47:22.840 --> 3:47:24.840]  always uses children
[3:47:24.840 --> 3:47:26.840]  as political human shields
[3:47:26.840 --> 3:47:28.840]  for their arguments
[3:47:28.840 --> 3:47:30.840]  because you can't criticize children can you
[3:47:30.840 --> 3:47:32.840]  so that with David Hogg of course
[3:47:32.840 --> 3:47:34.840]  anyone who had criticized what he was saying
[3:47:34.840 --> 3:47:36.840]  as this national activist
[3:47:36.840 --> 3:47:38.840]  being given a public platform
[3:47:38.840 --> 3:47:40.840]  by some of the biggest media corporations
[3:47:40.840 --> 3:47:42.840]  in America
[3:47:42.840 --> 3:47:44.840]  was shouted down
[3:47:44.840 --> 3:47:46.840]  was defamed as attacking children
[3:47:46.840 --> 3:47:48.840]  of course numerous videos
[3:47:48.840 --> 3:47:50.840]  banned removed from the internet
[3:47:50.840 --> 3:47:52.840]  merely for calling out his BS
[3:47:52.840 --> 3:47:55.840]  they do the same thing with Greta Thunberg
[3:47:55.840 --> 3:47:57.840]  team climber activist
[3:47:57.840 --> 3:48:00.840]  tells US lawmakers listen to the scientists
[3:48:00.840 --> 3:48:02.840]  of course she went on this big
[3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:04.840]  virtue signaling PR stunt
[3:48:04.840 --> 3:48:06.840]  sailing on a yacht
[3:48:06.840 --> 3:48:08.840]  to New York from I think it was Germany
[3:48:08.840 --> 3:48:10.840]  of course what they didn't tell you
[3:48:10.840 --> 3:48:12.840]  was that seven of her crew members
[3:48:12.840 --> 3:48:14.840]  then from New York flew back
[3:48:14.840 --> 3:48:16.840]  to Germany on CO2
[3:48:16.840 --> 3:48:18.840]  spewing commercial
[3:48:18.840 --> 3:48:20.840]  airliners I guess at least they were
[3:48:20.840 --> 3:48:22.840]  using commercial airliners unlike people
[3:48:22.840 --> 3:48:24.840]  like Prince Harry who lecture you all day
[3:48:24.840 --> 3:48:26.840]  about your carbon emissions while he
[3:48:26.840 --> 3:48:28.840]  literally took four
[3:48:28.840 --> 3:48:30.840]  private jet trips in the space of 11
[3:48:30.840 --> 3:48:32.840]  days
[3:48:32.840 --> 3:48:34.840]  well now Greta Thunberg a 16 year old
[3:48:34.840 --> 3:48:36.840]  Swedish climate activist
[3:48:36.840 --> 3:48:38.840]  and that's not a child in the UK basically
[3:48:38.840 --> 3:48:40.840]  that's a legal adult so this idea
[3:48:40.840 --> 3:48:42.840]  you can't criticize this she's a child
[3:48:42.840 --> 3:48:44.840]  doesn't wash legal in the UK at least
[3:48:44.840 --> 3:48:46.840]  on Wednesday employed US lawmakers
[3:48:46.840 --> 3:48:48.840]  to listen to the science and take real action
[3:48:48.840 --> 3:48:50.840]  to curb carbon emissions
[3:48:50.840 --> 3:48:52.840]  it's all about you
[3:48:52.840 --> 3:48:54.840]  reducing your standard of living of course
[3:48:54.840 --> 3:48:56.840]  as we know
[3:48:56.840 --> 3:48:58.840]  from this article specifically
[3:48:58.840 --> 3:49:00.840]  90% of plastic waste
[3:49:00.840 --> 3:49:02.840]  polluting Earth's oceans comes from Asia
[3:49:02.840 --> 3:49:04.840]  and Africa we know for example
[3:49:04.840 --> 3:49:06.840]  I think it's India puts out five times
[3:49:06.840 --> 3:49:08.840]  more CO2 than the UK
[3:49:08.840 --> 3:49:10.840]  China puts out more
[3:49:10.840 --> 3:49:12.840]  CO2 than Canada and the United States
[3:49:12.840 --> 3:49:14.840]  combined nobody's lecturing Indians
[3:49:14.840 --> 3:49:16.840]  nobody's lecturing Chinese people
[3:49:16.840 --> 3:49:18.840]  there's no giant propaganda machine
[3:49:18.840 --> 3:49:20.840]  within those countries
[3:49:20.840 --> 3:49:22.840]  telling them to change their behavior
[3:49:22.840 --> 3:49:24.840]  and now 90% of plastic waste
[3:49:24.840 --> 3:49:26.840]  polluting Earth's oceans comes from Asia
[3:49:26.840 --> 3:49:28.840]  and Africa I mean this is an issue
[3:49:28.840 --> 3:49:30.840]  that at least maybe there could be some
[3:49:30.840 --> 3:49:32.840]  crossover maybe we could agree on
[3:49:32.840 --> 3:49:34.840]  CO2 global warming is
[3:49:34.840 --> 3:49:36.840]  complete bunk all the people
[3:49:36.840 --> 3:49:38.840]  pushing it are all heavily invested in it
[3:49:38.840 --> 3:49:40.840]  they own all the carbon trading mechanisms
[3:49:40.840 --> 3:49:42.840]  the Ross Childs Al Gore the lot of them
[3:49:42.840 --> 3:49:44.840]  lying to you claiming
[3:49:44.840 --> 3:49:46.840]  that polar bears can't swim but
[3:49:46.840 --> 3:49:48.840]  with the whole plastic
[3:49:48.840 --> 3:49:50.840]  in the ocean thing I can agree that that's a real
[3:49:50.840 --> 3:49:52.840]  issue so where is the problem
[3:49:52.840 --> 3:49:54.840]  emanating from it's not
[3:49:54.840 --> 3:49:56.840]  emanating from the west
[3:49:56.840 --> 3:49:58.840]  despite westerners being lectured
[3:49:58.840 --> 3:50:00.840]  by climate activists like Greta Thunberg
[3:50:00.840 --> 3:50:02.840]  a study has found that around 90%
[3:50:02.840 --> 3:50:04.840]  of plastic waste polluting Earth's oceans
[3:50:04.840 --> 3:50:06.840]  comes from Asia and Africa
[3:50:06.840 --> 3:50:08.840]  during her US tour
[3:50:08.840 --> 3:50:10.840]  Thunberg cited horrifying pictures
[3:50:10.840 --> 3:50:12.840]  of plastic in the oceans
[3:50:12.840 --> 3:50:14.840]  as one of the primary reasons why Americans
[3:50:14.840 --> 3:50:16.840]  should listen to her
[3:50:16.840 --> 3:50:18.840]  why is she not going to Beijing
[3:50:18.840 --> 3:50:20.840]  why is she not going to New Delhi
[3:50:20.840 --> 3:50:22.840]  because that's where all the waste
[3:50:22.840 --> 3:50:24.840]  all the pollution is coming from
[3:50:24.840 --> 3:50:26.840]  90%
[3:50:26.840 --> 3:50:28.840]  who's saying that researchers
[3:50:28.840 --> 3:50:30.840]  at Germany's Helmholtz Center for
[3:50:30.840 --> 3:50:32.840]  Environmental Research
[3:50:32.840 --> 3:50:34.840]  they discovered that a small number of rivers
[3:50:34.840 --> 3:50:36.840]  account for the vast majority of plastic pollution
[3:50:36.840 --> 3:50:38.840]  and none of them are located
[3:50:38.840 --> 3:50:40.840]  in western countries
[3:50:40.840 --> 3:50:42.840]  this is a quote from their report
[3:50:42.840 --> 3:50:44.840]  from Christian Schmidt a hydrogeologist
[3:50:44.840 --> 3:50:46.840]  who led the study
[3:50:46.840 --> 3:50:48.840]  quote the top 10 ranked rivers
[3:50:48.840 --> 3:50:50.840]  transport 88 to 95%
[3:50:50.840 --> 3:50:52.840]  so it could be as high as 95%
[3:50:52.840 --> 3:50:54.840]  of the global load of plastic
[3:50:54.840 --> 3:50:56.840]  into the sea out of the top 10 rivers
[3:50:56.840 --> 3:50:58.840]  that produce the most pollution
[3:50:58.840 --> 3:51:00.840]  8 are in Asia
[3:51:00.840 --> 3:51:02.840]  2 are in Africa
[3:51:02.840 --> 3:51:04.840]  prime amongst them of course the Yangtze River in China
[3:51:04.840 --> 3:51:06.840]  the Ganges River in India
[3:51:06.840 --> 3:51:08.840]  they're responsible for the most plastic pollution
[3:51:08.840 --> 3:51:10.840]  there are no rivers in that top 10
[3:51:10.840 --> 3:51:12.840]  pollution list
[3:51:12.840 --> 3:51:14.840]  that are located in the west
[3:51:14.840 --> 3:51:16.840]  and yet where the ones being lectured
[3:51:16.840 --> 3:51:18.840]  day in, day out
[3:51:18.840 --> 3:51:20.840]  we need to alter our standard of living
[3:51:20.840 --> 3:51:22.840]  we need to stop having children
[3:51:22.840 --> 3:51:24.840]  because we're killing the planet
[3:51:24.840 --> 3:51:26.840]  we're not killing the planet
[3:51:26.840 --> 3:51:28.840]  even if you agree with that science
[3:51:28.840 --> 3:51:30.840]  they're killing the planet
[3:51:30.840 --> 3:51:32.840]  they're not getting lectured
[3:51:32.840 --> 3:51:34.840]  so again this is probably one of the main reasons
[3:51:34.840 --> 3:51:36.840]  why many in the west remain skeptical
[3:51:36.840 --> 3:51:38.840]  about the true motives of the environmentalist movement
[3:51:38.840 --> 3:51:40.840]  which brings me onto this article
[3:51:40.840 --> 3:51:42.840]  from summit.news
[3:51:42.840 --> 3:51:44.840]  just 38% of Americans
[3:51:44.840 --> 3:51:46.840]  believe in man-made climate change
[3:51:46.840 --> 3:51:48.840]  this is a new poll out of Yougov
[3:51:48.840 --> 3:51:50.840]  despite relentless
[3:51:50.840 --> 3:51:52.840]  propagandizing about a global consensus on climate change
[3:51:52.840 --> 3:51:54.840]  a new poll has found that just
[3:51:54.840 --> 3:51:56.840]  38% of Americans
[3:51:56.840 --> 3:51:58.840]  believe in man-made
[3:51:58.840 --> 3:52:00.840]  global warming
[3:52:00.840 --> 3:52:02.840]  and that is less
[3:52:02.840 --> 3:52:04.840]  than the number of people in China
[3:52:04.840 --> 3:52:06.840]  or the percentage of the population at least in China
[3:52:06.840 --> 3:52:08.840]  who believe the same thing
[3:52:08.840 --> 3:52:10.840]  so in fact less Americans are likely
[3:52:10.840 --> 3:52:12.840]  to believe in man-made global warming
[3:52:12.840 --> 3:52:14.840]  than Chinese people
[3:52:14.840 --> 3:52:16.840]  which kind of gives you an idea of how sick
[3:52:16.840 --> 3:52:18.840]  to the back teeth people are
[3:52:18.840 --> 3:52:20.840]  about being lectured about it
[3:52:20.840 --> 3:52:22.840]  by globalists who are responsible
[3:52:22.840 --> 3:52:24.840]  actually for the most pollution
[3:52:24.840 --> 3:52:26.840]  they literally take in the case of Prince Harry
[3:52:26.840 --> 3:52:28.840]  four private jet trips in 11 days
[3:52:28.840 --> 3:52:30.840]  literally going to visit
[3:52:30.840 --> 3:52:32.840]  Elton John in his mansion
[3:52:32.840 --> 3:52:34.840]  yeah I'm sure that was great
[3:52:34.840 --> 3:52:36.840]  for the planet
[3:52:36.840 --> 3:52:38.840]  so UK even
[3:52:38.840 --> 3:52:40.840]  which is interesting
[3:52:40.840 --> 3:52:42.840]  51% believe humans are mainly responsible
[3:52:42.840 --> 3:52:44.840]  for climate change
[3:52:44.840 --> 3:52:46.840]  that number drops to 49% in Germany
[3:52:46.840 --> 3:52:48.840]  and 48% in France
[3:52:48.840 --> 3:52:50.840]  so in many of these big western countries
[3:52:50.840 --> 3:52:52.840]  the majority of people
[3:52:52.840 --> 3:52:54.840]  do not believe that humans
[3:52:54.840 --> 3:52:56.840]  are responsible
[3:52:56.840 --> 3:52:58.840]  for climate change so the propaganda
[3:52:58.840 --> 3:53:00.840]  despite the fact that it's wall-to-wall
[3:53:00.840 --> 3:53:02.840]  and relentless doesn't appear
[3:53:02.840 --> 3:53:04.840]  to be working
[3:53:04.840 --> 3:53:06.840]  and yet we still have stories like this
[3:53:06.840 --> 3:53:08.840]  houses are so
[3:53:08.840 --> 3:53:10.840]  unaffordable young people are now
[3:53:10.840 --> 3:53:12.840]  living in sewer pipes
[3:53:12.840 --> 3:53:14.840]  now you've got
[3:53:14.840 --> 3:53:16.840]  college kids leaving university
[3:53:16.840 --> 3:53:18.840]  in America and it's at a similar level
[3:53:18.840 --> 3:53:20.840]  in the UK I believe
[3:53:20.840 --> 3:53:22.840]  literally $30,000 in debt
[3:53:22.840 --> 3:53:24.840]  none of them have any savings
[3:53:24.840 --> 3:53:26.840]  the cost of living is going through
[3:53:26.840 --> 3:53:28.840]  the roof in terms of house prices
[3:53:28.840 --> 3:53:30.840]  because of inflation and
[3:53:30.840 --> 3:53:32.840]  money printing
[3:53:32.840 --> 3:53:34.840]  so houses are becoming so unaffordable
[3:53:34.840 --> 3:53:36.840]  debt-stricken millennials
[3:53:36.840 --> 3:53:38.840]  young people are now literally living in
[3:53:38.840 --> 3:53:40.840]  decorated sewer pipes
[3:53:40.840 --> 3:53:42.840]  they're called oh pod tube houses
[3:53:42.840 --> 3:53:44.840]  I actually made a video
[3:53:44.840 --> 3:53:46.840]  about a week ago called pod people
[3:53:46.840 --> 3:53:48.840]  where people are
[3:53:48.840 --> 3:53:50.840]  renting out in San Francisco
[3:53:50.840 --> 3:53:52.840]  for $1200 a month
[3:53:52.840 --> 3:53:54.840]  with prison-style bunk beds
[3:53:54.840 --> 3:53:56.840]  where they get absolutely no privacy
[3:53:56.840 --> 3:53:58.840]  where they're stacked on top of each other
[3:53:58.840 --> 3:54:00.840]  home ownership is freedom
[3:54:00.840 --> 3:54:02.840]  what we have now in the west
[3:54:02.840 --> 3:54:04.840]  is the exact opposite of that
[3:54:04.840 --> 3:54:06.840]  because nobody can afford a home
[3:54:06.840 --> 3:54:08.840]  because they're all in mountains of debt
[3:54:08.840 --> 3:54:10.840]  they don't want families, they don't want pets
[3:54:10.840 --> 3:54:12.840]  they don't want any kind of stable lifestyle
[3:54:12.840 --> 3:54:14.840]  because they just can't afford it at the base level
[3:54:14.840 --> 3:54:16.840]  so now we have
[3:54:16.840 --> 3:54:18.840]  oh pod tube houses
[3:54:18.840 --> 3:54:20.840]  which literally consist of reclaimed bits
[3:54:20.840 --> 3:54:22.840]  of industrial piping
[3:54:22.840 --> 3:54:24.840]  renovated inside with other leftover pieces
[3:54:24.840 --> 3:54:26.840]  from building sites to make them into
[3:54:26.840 --> 3:54:28.840]  micro apartments
[3:54:28.840 --> 3:54:30.840]  they're placed on spare bits of land
[3:54:30.840 --> 3:54:32.840]  and stacked on top of each other
[3:54:32.840 --> 3:54:34.840]  allowing young people
[3:54:34.840 --> 3:54:36.840]  to live their dream of being a human ant
[3:54:36.840 --> 3:54:38.840]  in a colony, what a future
[3:54:38.840 --> 3:54:40.840]  there's in fact a story from last year
[3:54:40.840 --> 3:54:42.840]  I believe it was out of
[3:54:42.840 --> 3:54:44.840]  the UK where
[3:54:44.840 --> 3:54:46.840]  the rent prices were so extortionate
[3:54:46.840 --> 3:54:48.840]  that somebody was literally renting out
[3:54:48.840 --> 3:54:50.840]  a cupboard under the stairs
[3:54:50.840 --> 3:54:52.840]  with a single bed in it
[3:54:52.840 --> 3:54:54.840]  for £500 a month
[3:54:54.840 --> 3:54:56.840]  which is about $700 a month
[3:54:56.840 --> 3:54:58.840]  that's the level that we're at now in the UK
[3:54:58.840 --> 3:55:00.840]  primarily of course because they allow
[3:55:00.840 --> 3:55:02.840]  mega rich foreigners
[3:55:02.840 --> 3:55:04.840]  from Russia and Qatar to come in
[3:55:04.840 --> 3:55:06.840]  and buy up all the housing
[3:55:06.840 --> 3:55:08.840]  so you have no affordable housing whatsoever
[3:55:08.840 --> 3:55:10.840]  for local people
[3:55:10.840 --> 3:55:12.840]  Londoners, many of whom have moved out
[3:55:12.840 --> 3:55:14.840]  many years ago
[3:55:14.840 --> 3:55:16.840]  so then you get the nice globalised
[3:55:16.840 --> 3:55:18.840]  cultural city where nobody
[3:55:18.840 --> 3:55:20.840]  who was actually born here
[3:55:20.840 --> 3:55:22.840]  can afford to live here any longer
[3:55:22.840 --> 3:55:24.840]  and then you get the children of
[3:55:24.840 --> 3:55:26.840]  men's scenario and it's all
[3:55:26.840 --> 3:55:28.840]  very lovely and diverse
[3:55:28.840 --> 3:55:30.840]  these sewer pipes
[3:55:30.840 --> 3:55:32.840]  are becoming more widespread in Hong Kong
[3:55:32.840 --> 3:55:34.840]  where the cost of living is prohibitively expensive
[3:55:34.840 --> 3:55:36.840]  they expect us to see the trend
[3:55:36.840 --> 3:55:38.840]  transfer to the west very soon
[3:55:38.840 --> 3:55:40.840]  somebody commented on this on Twitter
[3:55:40.840 --> 3:55:42.840]  the objective of architecture
[3:55:42.840 --> 3:55:44.840]  like the sewer pipe house
[3:55:44.840 --> 3:55:46.840]  isn't to help humanity
[3:55:46.840 --> 3:55:48.840]  but to humiliate and demoralise its occupants
[3:55:48.840 --> 3:55:50.840]  and those who live in the
[3:55:50.840 --> 3:55:52.840]  surrounding area
[3:55:52.840 --> 3:55:54.840]  and on the subject of
[3:55:54.840 --> 3:55:56.840]  housing of course San Francisco and LA
[3:55:56.840 --> 3:55:58.840]  have massive homelessness problems
[3:55:58.840 --> 3:56:00.840]  because again the cost of living
[3:56:00.840 --> 3:56:02.840]  the cost of houses is so
[3:56:02.840 --> 3:56:04.840]  high
[3:56:04.840 --> 3:56:06.840]  because the elite are moving in
[3:56:06.840 --> 3:56:08.840]  the Silicon Valley elite moved in
[3:56:08.840 --> 3:56:10.840]  all they need is their servant
[3:56:10.840 --> 3:56:12.840]  slave class to cater to their needs
[3:56:12.840 --> 3:56:14.840]  in fact we saw
[3:56:14.840 --> 3:56:16.840]  servant class jobs in America over the past
[3:56:16.840 --> 3:56:18.840]  10 years skyrocket by
[3:56:18.840 --> 3:56:20.840]  114%
[3:56:20.840 --> 3:56:22.840]  talking about
[3:56:22.840 --> 3:56:24.840]  masseuses, people who fix their toilets
[3:56:24.840 --> 3:56:26.840]  basically in the words of Kelly Osborne
[3:56:26.840 --> 3:56:28.840]  and that infamous gaffe
[3:56:28.840 --> 3:56:30.840]  she did on the view
[3:56:30.840 --> 3:56:32.840]  so people go on to live in San Francisco
[3:56:32.840 --> 3:56:34.840]  the middle classes are moving out in droves
[3:56:34.840 --> 3:56:36.840]  most of them, a lot of them are moving to Texas
[3:56:36.840 --> 3:56:38.840]  and trying to turn that state blue
