[00:08.160 --> 00:16.280]  the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones I would have
[00:16.280 --> 00:21.320]  loved to have given the listeners a heads up it is a twenty-first third day
[00:21.320 --> 00:27.520]  of July 2008 I would have loved to have given people a chance to tell their
[00:27.520 --> 00:33.120]  friends family neighbors to tune in but I said last Friday I was going to call
[00:33.120 --> 00:38.440]  Willie Nelson over the weekend and try to get him on as a guest this week to
[00:38.440 --> 00:43.000]  speak out against an attack on Iran and of course to support Congressman Dennis
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.520]  Kucinich and his co-sponsors who this Friday are going to be before the
[00:47.520 --> 00:52.480]  House Judiciary Committee bringing forward evidence of the crimes of
[00:52.480 --> 00:57.200]  George W. Bush well I didn't call him this weekend I didn't call him this
[00:57.200 --> 01:02.000]  week time just flies by I called him this morning and he said well today's a
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.360]  good time to do it fact earlier the better let's go so we're scheduled to
[01:07.360 --> 01:12.040]  have Willie Nelson on in about five minutes starting in the second segment
[01:12.040 --> 01:17.240]  of the radio show today and in fact I meant to have his 35 articles of
[01:17.240 --> 01:21.560]  impeachment in front of me well somebody Google that so I so I have that
[01:21.560 --> 01:24.880]  when I don't have time to prepare for this because I literally called Nelson
[01:24.880 --> 01:28.800]  about 45 minutes ago it was in the middle of getting ready for the normal
[01:28.800 --> 01:32.080]  show trying to set him up Thursday Friday or next week he said well today's
[01:32.080 --> 01:39.680]  better so Willie Nelson will be on with us from the turbos coming up in about
[01:39.680 --> 01:46.420]  five minutes Ron Paul narrowly escaped death remember with Payne Stewart in

[02:09.120 --> 02:13.760]  tomorrow I wonder if this little snafu will get in the way of that to be
[02:13.760 --> 02:17.080]  talking about the Iran war what's happening with the economy and a lot
[02:17.080 --> 02:20.560]  more but congressman Ron Paul is scheduled tomorrow we're also lining up

[08:45.080 --> 08:55.240]  kill them first but I remember come in my mouth shall not kill how much is that
[08:55.240 --> 09:14.520]  soldier's life and what happened to peace on earth and the people of earth still believe in everything we've been told from our birth
[09:14.520 --> 09:29.360]  and that's the whole point welcome ladies and gentlemen the White House Pat
[09:29.360 --> 09:33.800]  Robertson even a lot of Democrats are saying Iran is gonna get a nuclear
[09:33.800 --> 09:38.840]  weapon that they've sworn to attack Iran it is a complete and total lie the
[09:38.840 --> 09:43.120]  White House has told Israel go ahead and attack and then if Iran fights back in
[09:43.120 --> 09:51.640]  any way that nuclear weapons may be used against them every major oil company
[09:51.640 --> 09:55.680]  and different brokerage house predicts that gas prices will at least double
[09:55.680 --> 10:00.880]  probably triple that will assuredly send us into a depression but Pat Robertson
[10:00.880 --> 10:03.960]  and others I have a clip of him say that doesn't matter we have to go ahead and
[10:03.960 --> 10:09.120]  attack Iran there is a gentleman named Dennis Kucinich congressman who's been
[10:09.120 --> 10:13.080]  almost the last few weeks can be coming on later this week who Friday will
[10:13.080 --> 10:19.800]  boldly be before the House Judiciary Committee bringing forward evidence of
[10:19.800 --> 10:25.800]  crimes and lies by the Bush administration to try to get the committee
[10:25.800 --> 10:30.800]  to vote to bring impeachment to the full house to the floor then the house
[10:30.800 --> 10:35.040]  votes for it that is an indictment the house acts as the grand jury then it
[10:35.040 --> 10:43.440]  goes to the Senate as a trial the crimes of the Bush administration dwarf
[10:43.440 --> 10:48.800]  probably by 10,000 times and I mean that literally the crimes of Richard
[10:48.800 --> 10:54.600]  Millhouse Nixon we must bring impeachment charges because if we don't
[10:54.600 --> 10:59.720]  they are going to have the political capital to fail forward and start World
[10:59.720 --> 11:06.080]  War three joining us is Willie Nelson for the rest of the hour later in the hour
[11:06.080 --> 11:10.800]  we'll be taking your phone calls specifically on impeachment and on the
[11:10.800 --> 11:15.320]  Iran situation the inside scoop from Congressman Ron Paul people inside the
[11:15.320 --> 11:19.600]  CIA and others is an attack in October September or October probably in
[11:19.600 --> 11:25.160]  September as an October surprise for the election and I'm just very honored to
[11:25.160 --> 11:29.840]  have Willie Nelson joining us from counsel bluff Iowa where he's going to be
[11:29.840 --> 11:34.880]  playing tonight Mr. Nelson thank you for joining us oh my pleasure Alex it's
[11:34.880 --> 11:38.840]  good to be on your show I hope you're doing good man it's the best of times
[11:38.840 --> 11:42.560]  the worst of times life's great it's beautiful in Austin Texas we got great
[11:42.560 --> 11:46.840]  people like Willie Nelson out there to listen to but meanwhile there is the
[11:46.840 --> 11:51.720]  establishment trying to ruin the wonderful time we're having how are you
[11:51.720 --> 11:57.000]  doing Willie oh I'm doing fine we're in council bluff as you said this is our
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.080]  third attempt to play counsel bluff in the last two years we tried it a few
[12:02.080 --> 12:09.080]  weeks ago and a tornado hit the stage and hit the bus and so we decided we
[12:09.080 --> 12:12.480]  would go away for a few days and wait until the weather calmed down so we're
[12:12.480 --> 12:18.920]  back again so like you say maybe third time's charm this time absolutely Willie
[12:18.920 --> 12:23.320]  I called you this morning I wanted to get you on to get your take on impeachment
[12:23.320 --> 12:29.080]  you said let's do it right now so here we are it's really seems like we're even
[12:29.080 --> 12:32.560]  begging the question why do why do we have to get up here and point out all
[12:32.560 --> 12:37.640]  the crimes they're so evident but I just look at the courage of Dennis Kucinich
[12:37.640 --> 12:44.000]  definitely putting his life in in at stake out there very dangerous
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.320]  administration and I wanted to get you on to get your take on Dennis Kucinich
[12:48.320 --> 12:54.240]  and impeachment and and find out if you're supporting in and if so why well
[12:54.240 --> 12:59.240]  for first of all Dennis Kucinich is a great friend of mine and I've supported
[12:59.240 --> 13:05.800]  him ever ever since I've known him and I've always admired the way that he
[13:05.800 --> 13:11.960]  stood up for the little guy and told it like it is and you know what the hell
[13:11.960 --> 13:16.080]  with the consequences and you got to admire a man that has that kind of
[13:16.080 --> 13:22.320]  nerve and to you know I wrote the song you just played a while ago whatever
[13:22.320 --> 13:28.160]  happened to peace on earth I wrote that for Dennis Kucinich's campaign and it
[13:28.160 --> 13:32.760]  pretty much tells where we are today just how much is a human life worth how
[13:32.760 --> 13:38.200]  much all is a human life worth these days there has to be a price tag on it
[13:38.200 --> 13:42.800]  or else we wouldn't be able around the world killing people overall and I love
[13:42.800 --> 13:46.880]  the way Dennis is handling the impeachment thing and you know I think
[13:46.880 --> 13:54.920]  he's got what 54 impeachment charges against George and there's probably
[13:54.920 --> 13:59.480]  another 54 laying around out there if he wants to go get him absolutely he
[13:59.480 --> 14:04.440]  first introduced 35 instead of Congress did not he would add more and he has he
[14:04.440 --> 14:08.920]  did pressure them the Democratic Congress that was supposedly elected to
[14:08.920 --> 14:13.200]  punish Bush's crimes and in the war now becoming very transparent they're in the
[14:13.200 --> 14:18.520]  same military industrial complex hip pocket of those special interests but
[14:18.520 --> 14:24.240]  he was able to get the Judiciary Committee to hear his charges coming up
[14:24.240 --> 14:30.040]  this Friday and I just wanted to put the call out for everybody to call the
[14:30.040 --> 14:33.880]  House Judiciary Committee and to call all of your members of Congress and tell
[14:33.880 --> 14:39.040]  them look it's admitted that the wiretapping of US citizens without
[14:39.040 --> 14:43.480]  warrants each each counts a felony it's admitted that lying about WMD's in
[14:43.480 --> 14:45.960]  Iraq and it's come out we have the White House documents that they knew they
[14:45.960 --> 14:52.360]  were lying those are felonies will he give us your sense on all these crimes
[14:52.360 --> 14:55.880]  that have committed I've been committed by the White House and and why you're
[14:55.880 --> 15:04.720]  supporting impeachment well are you still there yes sir you there okay what
[15:04.720 --> 15:09.960]  main thing that bothers me think is the fact that anyone in this country can get
[15:09.960 --> 15:16.040]  by with murder if they happen to be the president of the United States have a
[15:16.040 --> 15:20.880]  all of the government behind them and I don't think that's right I think if you
[15:20.880 --> 15:24.400]  know if I get caught on the street smoking a joint I'm going to jail you
[15:24.400 --> 15:28.720]  know so I don't ask for questions they just pick me up and throw me in there
[15:28.720 --> 15:32.440]  how can a guy get away with all the things that he's gotten away with
[15:32.440 --> 15:38.080]  without even a slap on the wrist I mean Bill Clinton we impeached that that guy
[15:38.080 --> 15:44.360]  just for a new a little bit of indiscretion so this is a lot more
[15:44.360 --> 15:51.760]  serious than that well it certainly is of all the articles of impeachment which
[15:51.760 --> 15:57.960]  ones do you think are most important well I probably couldn't name the
[15:57.960 --> 16:02.440]  articles of impeachment by name but I do know that it was wrong for him to go to
[16:02.440 --> 16:07.240]  war I do know that a lot of our guys and gals have lost their lives and lives
[16:07.240 --> 16:14.360]  have been ruined forever because of the law that he broke and for that alone he
[16:14.360 --> 16:20.640]  should that he should have to pay for it in some way impeachment seems like a
[16:20.640 --> 16:25.400]  minor way you know the guy's gonna be out of office in a while and I'm sure
[16:25.400 --> 16:29.200]  there's a lot of people gonna follow him around and try to charge him with all
[16:29.200 --> 16:33.120]  kind of things even after he leaves office but the point that you brought
[16:33.120 --> 16:39.800]  out the fact that we're so close to a war with Iran and that anything this guy
[16:39.800 --> 16:44.440]  does between now and election day could spark it I think an impeachment hearing
[16:44.440 --> 16:48.760]  between now and then might slow the guy down it might get the attention of the
[16:48.760 --> 16:54.400]  world and us on trying to stop a guy who's really intent on starting a war
[16:54.400 --> 16:59.480]  well you're right and it also shows the world that we're serious about getting
[16:59.480 --> 17:03.560]  our name back I mean we've always been known not as being perfect but as the
[17:03.560 --> 17:10.200]  good guys and now we are we don't have to do that we might we might you know I'm
[17:10.200 --> 17:14.320]  talking we should set ourselves up as the world's peacemakers not the world's
[17:14.320 --> 17:19.440]  war mongers there is a place in the world for a peacemaker we all know that
[17:19.440 --> 17:23.200]  absolutely so I think it's important for the world to see that the American
[17:23.200 --> 17:29.200]  people are at least attempting to see the justice is done absolutely now you
[17:29.200 --> 17:32.880]  were right that is the second article of impeachment is falsely
[17:32.880 --> 17:38.200]  systematically and with criminal intent conflating the attacks of September
[17:38.200 --> 17:44.680]  11th with a mis-presentation of Iraq as a security threat as part of a
[17:44.680 --> 17:49.040]  fraudulent justification for the war of aggression and we now have the memos the
[17:49.040 --> 17:52.960]  White House memos and others where they knew Iraq had nothing to do with it
[17:52.960 --> 17:56.000]  of course they knew that from day one being the authors of the attacks the
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.640]  9-11 attacks but that they were going to go out and sell the public on this and
[17:59.640 --> 18:04.840]  now conservatively there's a million dead Iraqis because of this I mean this is
[18:04.840 --> 18:13.440]  this is Nazi level World War two level crimes no this is this is very very
[18:13.440 --> 18:18.760]  serious there's a lot of people dying today because of that huge law that he
[18:18.760 --> 18:22.560]  broke and I know I don't think he should get by with it I don't think any of those
[18:22.560 --> 18:27.480]  guys in there and he's not the only one you know he's just the puppet on the
[18:27.480 --> 18:31.480]  string there's a lot of people telling him what to do and you know they're
[18:31.480 --> 18:36.560]  using small words and big letters so he can get it said but there's people
[18:36.560 --> 18:40.960]  behind him telling him what to do would you like to see the New World Order
[18:40.960 --> 18:45.640]  puppeteers controlling the Marionette be brought to justice as well Willie I
[18:45.640 --> 18:49.920]  think they have to you just can't bring in the puppets you got to bring in the
[18:49.920 --> 18:54.880]  guys pulling the strings and that's going to be harder to do because it looks
[18:54.880 --> 18:59.200]  like the closer we get to impeachment to all the guys out there pulling the
[18:59.200 --> 19:03.120]  strings are ready to throw George under the bus and let him ride all the heat
[19:03.120 --> 19:07.840]  but I don't think that's that's enough I think we have to go further than that
[19:07.840 --> 19:12.400]  and dig deeper and go back and find out who all is involved here and make them
[19:12.400 --> 19:18.400]  all come to step up to the bar and tell us why they did what they did you know
[19:18.400 --> 19:21.520]  that's a great point I'm gonna skip this break for the folks watching on
[19:21.520 --> 19:26.440]  prisonplanet.tv and for the radio folks out there and then we're gonna go to
[19:26.440 --> 19:31.040]  break at the bottom of the hour and come back and take some phone calls I
[19:31.040 --> 19:40.800]  really cannot overstate how much courage that congressman Dennis Kucinich has
[19:40.800 --> 19:46.040]  and we all need to be praying for him and supporting him and and and demanding
[19:46.040 --> 19:51.920]  not just that Congress support impeachment but that the media pay
[19:51.920 --> 19:57.000]  attention to what's happening Willie I mean that's another big area here our
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.240]  press wasn't perfect back in the 70s back in 73 74 but at least they did
[20:01.240 --> 20:05.080]  cover the investigation and the movement towards impeachment with Richard Nixon
[20:05.080 --> 20:09.920]  I think that's the missing link here is that the media you're seeing almost no
[20:09.920 --> 20:15.760]  coverage of what congressman Kucinich and all of his co-sponsors are doing well
[20:15.760 --> 20:20.720]  yeah that's that's another problem that we have with is getting the message
[20:20.720 --> 20:26.480]  across because the media people seem to be happy just telling the other side
[20:26.480 --> 20:31.240]  there's you know they know that they'll get in trouble themselves they'll lose
[20:31.240 --> 20:35.480]  their jobs if they start talking like you and I are doing it but if they
[20:35.480 --> 20:40.200]  signed up to be a news person I think they should you know go on up and do
[20:40.200 --> 20:44.240]  what they're supposed to do some of them are doing it if not all the media is
[20:44.240 --> 20:49.720]  laying down rolling over and there's a lot of good people in the radio that
[20:49.720 --> 20:55.160]  are speaking out and a lot of people on the internet I think we have more ways
[20:55.160 --> 21:02.640]  to fight back today than we did 50 years ago so I think with you doing what
[21:02.640 --> 21:06.480]  you're doing and all the other guys chipping in every every little bit helps
[21:06.480 --> 21:10.920]  and if we keep pointing out what's going on and if we keep putting cameras on
[21:10.920 --> 21:15.800]  them if we keep telling people what they're doing maybe we can stop them
[21:15.800 --> 21:20.600]  from doing something really bad between now and election day well that's my
[21:20.600 --> 21:24.680]  point and the point that you and many others have made is that there is this
[21:24.680 --> 21:29.240]  incredible danger if they've got the will to orchestrate a 9-11 style attack
[21:29.240 --> 21:33.080]  if they have the the will to carry out all these chemical and biological and
[21:33.080 --> 21:37.080]  radiological tests on the people or the will to ship in these dangerous
[21:37.080 --> 21:41.000]  narcotics for our school children and then run the phony war against it
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.880]  they're capable of doing anything and you're right we can't just remove the
[21:44.880 --> 21:49.680]  puppets we have to once and for all smoke the dark spiders the corporate
[21:49.680 --> 21:55.520]  chieftains out of their holes that have been engineering all this you're
[21:55.520 --> 22:02.840]  absolutely right and I think Dennis is taking a giant step forward in giving
[22:02.840 --> 22:06.640]  that a chance to happen every time he steps up there and reads another
[22:06.640 --> 22:11.160]  article of impeachment we're gonna come back because right now we're behind the
[22:11.160 --> 22:13.800]  scenes for folks on the internet we're gonna be back about a minute and a half
[22:13.800 --> 22:17.240]  to the full audience Willie and I want to get back into what's happening with
[22:17.240 --> 22:21.560]  Iran and Iraq and get your take on that but shifting gears into the economy you
[22:21.560 --> 22:25.760]  know you've involved with farm aid and so much more aware of how this
[22:25.760 --> 22:29.800]  international banks central banks operate we've got the IMF and World Bank
[22:29.800 --> 22:34.600]  documents where they admit they are engineering the implosion in our economy
[22:34.600 --> 22:38.400]  so they can consolidate wealth and reap basically repossess America come in and
[22:38.400 --> 22:44.880]  buy all of our companies anhyzer bush real estate car companies Willie Nelson
[22:44.880 --> 22:48.720]  what's your take on that what's happening right now with the economy well I can
[22:48.720 --> 22:52.520]  see where they've done it with the farmers so we used to have eight million
[22:52.520 --> 22:57.640]  small family farmers out there and through various techniques illegal and
[22:57.640 --> 23:02.440]  whatever they have taken back over six million of those small family farms and
[23:02.440 --> 23:07.640]  they've done it by doing exactly what you said they dropped the prices on
[23:07.640 --> 23:11.160]  everything putting farmers out of business all over the world just so they
[23:11.160 --> 23:17.120]  can pick up the land and use it to their advantage the big corporations won't
[23:17.120 --> 23:21.000]  do it all they they want to put all the small family farmers out of business and
[23:21.000 --> 23:27.600]  I still think that this whole thing our entire economy that agriculture is the
[23:27.600 --> 23:33.680]  bottom rung on our economic ladder and the farmer is our backbone of that
[23:33.680 --> 23:38.400]  economic ladder so we have to bring the farmer back to small family farmer we
[23:38.400 --> 23:45.480]  have to start thinking locally sustainable agriculture take our take away
[23:45.480 --> 23:50.240]  our needs for importing like keep on picking said seven hundred billion
[23:50.240 --> 23:54.480]  dollars worth of oil every year from foreign countries we could be making it
[23:54.480 --> 24:03.200]  ourselves out of wind solar biodiesel ethanol we can we can do it all in
[24:03.200 --> 24:08.000]  20 30 years we can take ourselves off of all completely in the meantime we can
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.200]  drop our dependency just by changing over doing this and doing that okay
[24:14.200 --> 24:16.720]  will you interrupt you when you're on a roll we're coming back to the main
[24:16.720 --> 24:37.920]  audience before you leave let's get back into that okay here we go you know I
[24:37.920 --> 24:43.680]  love rodeos and I go to a four or five a year and it's great to go to a rodeo
[24:43.680 --> 24:47.720]  or willy nelson's plan because instead of having a bunch of pro-war propaganda
[24:47.720 --> 24:51.480]  wrapped in the flag you get a real patriot a real Texan who really loves
[24:51.480 --> 24:56.640]  liberty and to see tens of thousands of people at the Austin rodeo star at
[24:56.640 --> 25:00.840]  Texas rodeo singing along to that instead of going to say the teague rodeo with my
[25:00.840 --> 25:05.080]  family or my family's from out in east Texas and I mean we're talking 20
[25:05.080 --> 25:10.080]  minutes of government worshiping war worshiping stuff but it was totally
[25:10.080 --> 25:14.400]  hollow and nobody was even buying into it there and we're back live where the
[25:14.400 --> 25:19.320]  willy nelson take your calls in the next segment and also later before he leaves
[25:19.320 --> 25:24.360]  us get some into his solutions with agriculture and trying to save the family
[25:24.360 --> 25:28.960]  farm because his farm aid this year is coming up as well and give out some of
[25:28.960 --> 25:35.080]  his websites for you again willy it's just wonderful and precious to be having
[25:35.080 --> 25:39.440]  this time with you just even tourist since you last came on the show in
[25:39.440 --> 25:44.080]  public for 911 truth jesse ventura came on the show and then told me behind the
[25:44.080 --> 25:47.440]  scenes he goes look I want to come out for 911 truth you gave me films years
[25:47.440 --> 25:52.000]  ago when I was in in Texas visiting with willy nelson and kinky freedman when I
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.200]  saw him in an event he said but now I've looked into it it's an inside job he went
[25:56.200 --> 26:00.960]  public and even Fox News had trouble attacking him now we've had at the former
[26:00.960 --> 26:04.600]  Italian president who was also the head of intelligence go public German defense
[26:04.600 --> 26:09.760]  ministers leaders in the Japanese diet their their parliament we've had actress
[26:09.760 --> 26:15.440]  of the year go public I mean it is just a massive prominent people see I section
[26:15.440 --> 26:21.440]  chiefs going public what is it like to see this type of courage willy well it's
[26:21.440 --> 26:26.920]  great you know we do know that there are some strong people in this country and
[26:26.920 --> 26:31.560]  around the world will stand up for what's right and it's always gratifying to
[26:31.560 --> 26:36.360]  see a guy jump up and say what he thinks to stand up for what he believes is
[26:36.360 --> 26:42.360]  right and I can see more and more people doing that these days and it is very
[26:42.360 --> 26:46.920]  gratified I don't think that the ring knockers the establishment individuals
[26:46.920 --> 26:51.000]  thought that we would have this much courage or that this many prominent
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.840]  people like willy nelson and jesse ventura and and and so many others
[26:55.840 --> 26:59.640]  martin sheen before right before he died george carlin I'm gonna send you my
[26:59.640 --> 27:04.680]  new film have you seen george carlin talk about 9 11 minute inside job no I
[27:04.680 --> 27:08.760]  haven't but I would love to see that it's just incredible willy I mean I know
[27:08.760 --> 27:13.360]  I'm kind of an awe here it just it's just we have to realize how positive it is
[27:13.360 --> 27:18.120]  that with that that there are a lot of good americans another standing up well
[27:18.120 --> 27:23.000]  yeah and it's a when you look at it for what it is it's no big deal it's somebody
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.120]  did something wrong and somebody needs to be outed for it and once you look at
[27:28.120 --> 27:33.640]  all the facts and see the pictures and and here all the stories it doesn't take
[27:33.640 --> 27:39.320]  a german scientist to realize that we got hit though you know by some inside
[27:39.320 --> 27:43.880]  people or we need to find out who it is and we need to find out quickly so it
[27:43.880 --> 27:47.880]  doesn't happen again yeah I'm sorry I shouldn't laugh it's so horrible but
[27:47.880 --> 27:51.800]  just I mean it's so obvious it's so simple and you're saying the emperor
[27:51.800 --> 27:56.240]  here has no clothes and more and more people are saying it willy what has the
[27:56.240 --> 28:00.800]  response been like since you came on my radio show twice and then on of course
[28:00.800 --> 28:05.080]  free speech TV and democracy now and you know question the official fable what
[28:05.080 --> 28:08.120]  is the response been like from your fans from your supporters and your
[28:08.120 --> 28:17.320]  detractors 99% in favor of what we've been saying and 100% of ours believing
[28:17.320 --> 28:23.920]  that we have the right to say it there's nobody that said hey shut up
[28:23.920 --> 28:29.360]  there's been a couple that didn't quite believe it and couldn't believe that we
[28:29.360 --> 28:33.640]  could do something like that but I think the more we find out about what we are
[28:33.640 --> 28:37.880]  capable of doing and what we have done in the last couple hundred years it's
[28:37.880 --> 28:43.080]  it's no stretch of the imagination to see that hey you know we did this we did
[28:43.080 --> 28:48.000]  that of course we can do the trade powers it's no big deal well you're
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.400]  right in fact if you look at the British manuals on how to spread smallpox to the
[28:53.400 --> 28:57.080]  natives by giving them that's not a rumor folks we have the manuals that then
[28:57.080 --> 29:01.600]  then was taught to the colonists who did it or then when you look at the
[29:01.600 --> 29:06.000]  Tuskegee experiment or all the things that are that are still going on or all
[29:06.000 --> 29:12.080]  these neocon warmongers who say use DU and Serbian Iraq and Afghanistan and
[29:12.080 --> 29:15.280]  now our troops are coming home with triple the birth defects in their
[29:15.280 --> 29:18.760]  children I mean so many of these individuals think they can do all of
[29:18.760 --> 29:23.880]  this in a vacuum and you can't do this in a vacuum can you Willie well no you
[29:23.880 --> 29:27.280]  can eventually the truth will come out but in the meantime a lot of people are
[29:27.280 --> 29:31.600]  dying and suffering and that's why I think it's so urgent that Dennis keep
[29:31.600 --> 29:36.560]  Dennis percentage keeps doing what he's doing keep hitting them on that
[29:36.560 --> 29:42.920]  sore spot it's like a drop of water on the dam if he keeps dropping water on
[29:42.920 --> 29:46.880]  that sucker eventually it'll crash through and we'll find out the truth of
[29:46.880 --> 29:50.640]  what really happened but I think Dennis has got to keep pounding on impeachment
[29:50.640 --> 29:56.320]  I think that's the the key to stopping anything really horrible coming up
[29:56.320 --> 30:01.280]  between now and as you say September October absolutely just a moment ago we
[30:01.280 --> 30:05.120]  went Willie this is kind of a split show now because I'm also got hundreds of
[30:05.120 --> 30:08.240]  thousands viewing on the internet and tens of thousands watching on television
[30:08.240 --> 30:14.520]  I just skip breaks with huge guests like yourself so we've got one more break
[30:14.520 --> 30:19.160]  coming up but we're skipping them is that okay with you oh sure whatever
[30:19.160 --> 30:22.560]  absolutely well you're just awesome we're gonna be taking calls when we get
[30:22.560 --> 30:30.480]  back into the main segment at 1-800-259-9231 again Willie getting back
[30:30.480 --> 30:36.080]  to the fact that the people are rising up that has now cornered the rats that
[30:36.080 --> 30:40.440]  stage the attacks and I'm trying to figure out their psychology and what
[30:40.440 --> 30:45.680]  they're gonna do and most the experts I talked to Ron Paul Ray McGovern you know
[30:45.680 --> 30:50.160]  so many other people Dennis Kucinich people inside Ron Paul said last week
[30:50.160 --> 30:54.880]  before the house he said look the shoes gonna be dropped in the fall they're
[30:54.880 --> 30:58.800]  intending to go ahead and start World War three and I guess try to bring us
[30:58.800 --> 31:04.080]  into martial law and we're here I guess just with with with genuine communal
[31:04.080 --> 31:08.360]  horror wanting to stop it do you have I mean do you have any ideas how to stop
[31:08.360 --> 31:11.280]  it I mean you're here on air speaking out you're prominent I guess we need to
[31:11.280 --> 31:15.040]  ask everybody who's prominent and and and has large followings to speak up I
[31:15.040 --> 31:17.980]  mean what are some of the other ideas you have Willie to try to turn this
[31:17.980 --> 31:25.080]  around right now well the only thing we can do is just to keep our words and
[31:25.080 --> 31:29.600]  thoughts out there in the atmosphere and and let people around the world know
[31:29.600 --> 31:33.560]  what we're thinking and and let's be open-minded to what they're thinking and
[31:33.560 --> 31:38.200]  let's put our heads together and come up ways with ways to stop it because you
[31:38.200 --> 31:44.320]  know we are smart enough to do it we can figure we do know we're standing here
[31:44.320 --> 31:48.680]  today telling everyone what we think is going to happen now how do we stop it I
[31:48.680 --> 31:53.080]  think we keep talking about it I keep I think we do the impeachment I think we
[31:53.080 --> 32:01.880]  anyway elect a guy who is thinking about peace rather than war this is the
[32:01.880 --> 32:06.400]  we have to become a department of peace and we have to spread peace around the
[32:06.400 --> 32:09.960]  world instead of going around the world starting wars overall we don't have to
[32:09.960 --> 32:15.280]  do that anymore well you're absolutely right Willie and it's not just starting
[32:15.280 --> 32:18.440]  wars about oil it's also about as you know the hundreds of billions of
[32:18.440 --> 32:22.360]  dollars per year and no bid contracts going into black holes and it's the
[32:22.360 --> 32:26.880]  silencing political opposition at home and that's what it is because
[32:26.880 --> 32:33.120]  Sinich List and his articles of impeachment how the president they have
[32:33.120 --> 32:37.000]  policy reports saying how do we shut down demonstrations how do we shut down
[32:37.000 --> 32:41.440]  free speech how do we train local police to shut down free speech so I want to
[32:41.440 --> 32:46.280]  come back to the full audience in about 10 seconds and oppose that question to
[32:46.280 --> 32:51.960]  you and then to the audience what their ideas of stopping all of this here we
[32:51.960 --> 33:14.920]  go with Willie Nelson back to the full radio audience
[33:14.920 --> 33:24.560]  I am a Midwest farmer I make a living off the land I ride a John Deere tractor I'm a liberated man
[33:24.560 --> 33:32.000]  the rain hasn't fallen since the middle of July and if it don't come soon my
[33:32.000 --> 33:39.800]  crops will die the bankman says he likes me but there's nothing he can do he
[33:39.800 --> 33:49.760]  tells me that he's coming but the clouds are coming to be my friend and I'll
[33:49.760 --> 33:58.320]  ride again 1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to talk to Willie
[33:58.320 --> 34:02.840]  Nelson now I want to I want to talk about callers not side issues we have
[34:02.840 --> 34:08.160]  limited time with him only about 25 minutes left I want to talk and get
[34:08.160 --> 34:14.200]  your questions or comments for Willie Nelson on the Iran attack that is coming
[34:14.200 --> 34:17.760]  up I've got family in the military I've got sources in Congress in the
[34:17.760 --> 34:23.960]  government in intelligence it's on it's on in September or October I've had so
[34:23.960 --> 34:30.200]  many congressmen on former CIA section chief saying that Bush will stage a
[34:30.200 --> 34:34.180]  terror attack that I mean Ray McGovern's chief White House briefer to
[34:34.180 --> 34:38.080]  Ronald Reagan and George Bush senior he's not even menacing words anymore I
[34:38.080 --> 34:42.720]  mean it is on they are gonna stage terror attacks that is the green light
[34:42.720 --> 34:46.640]  they've got their people out there saying they're gonna attack Iran telling
[34:46.640 --> 34:50.400]  the public it's got to happen it's on you thought they were bold and attacked
[34:50.400 --> 34:53.720]  Iraq when we all knew it was alive before animal walks they're gonna do it
[34:53.720 --> 34:58.320]  again but the Iranians are not a pushover there's 65 million instead of 23
[34:58.320 --> 35:01.440]  million they've got more high-tech weapons and they're gonna block the
[35:01.440 --> 35:05.440]  straight of our moves and Bush has moved the aircraft carriers in close so they
[35:05.440 --> 35:11.640]  can be hit the that's why Admiral Fallon resigned I mean this is serious this is
[35:11.640 --> 35:17.040]  the end of America the real target of this is the US they want a war to bring
[35:17.040 --> 35:21.920]  us into a depression to fully consolidate what's left of the free market and
[35:21.920 --> 35:27.720]  bring us into total tyranny now I've had top analysts on scores of the last two
[35:27.720 --> 35:31.960]  weeks all agreeing that is the attack profile of the New World Order and the
[35:31.960 --> 35:36.440]  puppeteers controlling George Bush and his cronies and they own the Democrats
[35:36.440 --> 35:41.280]  as well and this may have been an attempt on Ron Paul's life with him and
[35:41.280 --> 35:45.560]  seven congressmen and sudden total depressurization they barely got the
[35:45.560 --> 35:49.480]  plane down when it took off from Houston last night and we know they've
[35:49.480 --> 35:52.680]  killed a lot of congressmen and senators we got to be praying for Dennis
[35:52.680 --> 35:57.160]  Kucinich before we go back to your calls and again folks I want to hear your
[35:57.160 --> 36:01.720]  ideas for solutions how we can stop this war what type of stunts can we pull
[36:01.720 --> 36:07.200]  that are peaceful banner hangs I mean whatever calling into Congress here's
[36:07.200 --> 36:12.280]  the number to the White House I mean to the House switchboard and now now this
[36:12.280 --> 36:16.600]  is the non toll free why am I giving you that the toll free is limited numbers
[36:16.600 --> 36:22.240]  and is jammed most the time the non toll free you can get through on 202 224
[36:22.240 --> 36:28.360]  3121 202 224 3121 call your congressman or woman call the House
[36:28.360 --> 36:32.240]  Judiciary Committee tell them vote for impeachment vote to send it to the full
[36:32.240 --> 36:38.400]  house when Dennis Kucinich literally goes into Mordor literally into the
[36:38.400 --> 36:43.360]  gates of hell to move for impeachment the last person that even talked about
[36:43.360 --> 36:51.000]  this up in Minnesota the senators plane blew up 202 224 3121 and by talking
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.520]  about how these murderers kill people that may preempt them from going after
[36:55.520 --> 36:58.880]  Kucinich and I've talked him on air he said a few weeks ago he knows he's in
[36:58.880 --> 37:02.840]  danger he knows these people are serious but he says he says this is a
[37:02.840 --> 37:06.400]  spiritual thing he says he's crossing that line and that he's doing the right
[37:06.400 --> 37:09.520]  thing and putting his trust in the Creator I've never heard Kucinich talk
[37:09.520 --> 37:13.880]  like that so you know he's at a high level there when you start fighting
[37:13.880 --> 37:17.120]  evil at these high levels because I've done it myself not at that level but
[37:17.120 --> 37:21.280]  I've it's a line you cross I hate to get mystic here but Willie I mean do you
[37:21.280 --> 37:26.360]  know what I'm talking about here well yeah there is there is that line that I
[37:26.360 --> 37:32.120]  think you know you and I we not only crossed it we kind of we leaped over it
[37:32.120 --> 37:39.080]  a while back but it's always dangerous and yeah I'm concerned about Dennis or
[37:39.080 --> 37:44.000]  anybody else who speaks out against this administration because these guys are
[37:44.000 --> 37:50.000]  serious they power is you know people love their power and they hate to give
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.320]  it up their money and their power is all they have and until they lose that they
[37:54.320 --> 37:58.120]  feel like they've lost their divinity so you know they're gonna they're gonna hang
[37:58.120 --> 38:05.040]  on to their power absolutely and we just need to realize and really pray for and
[38:05.040 --> 38:09.400]  just in our core in our spirit know that Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul and
[38:09.400 --> 38:15.720]  others are really facing the dragon down at point blank range and need our
[38:15.720 --> 38:19.200]  support and so does Willie and everybody else that's out there speaking out
[38:19.200 --> 38:24.960]  Willie before we go to some calls and again the numbers 1-800-259-9231 I
[38:24.960 --> 38:29.280]  want to hear your ideas for solutions or ways to stop this war Willie any other
[38:29.280 --> 38:36.480]  ideas you've got to try to stop this attack on Iran well first of all I
[38:36.480 --> 38:40.760]  think impeachment is good we have to do that to to get people to realize hey
[38:40.760 --> 38:45.680]  these guys are bad and we have to stop them before they do and they're thinking
[38:45.680 --> 38:49.920]  that we won't do it they're thinking that they have plenty of time between
[38:49.920 --> 38:55.520]  now and election day to do what they already have planned to do whether we
[38:55.520 --> 39:02.040]  can stop them or not I don't know you know God help us if we can't because
[39:02.040 --> 39:11.560]  once we bomb Iran then all hell breaks loose America is not the same America as
[39:11.560 --> 39:18.360]  we knew it the second afterwards and not only that we will bring down hardships
[39:18.360 --> 39:23.080]  not only ourselves but people all over the world not to mention just the price
[39:23.080 --> 39:27.440]  of a gallon of gas right now it's four or five dollars it's ten dollars over
[39:27.440 --> 39:33.320]  there in England it will be much higher well you're absolutely right and for
[39:33.320 --> 39:37.760]  those that understand the globalist mindset its problem reaction solution or
[39:37.760 --> 39:42.320]  order out of chaos as Bush has said in speeches and they believe by getting us
[39:42.320 --> 39:47.640]  into a crisis so bad that and where our military is being defeated and that's
[39:47.640 --> 39:50.560]  probably going to happen in the first stages just like they invited the
[39:50.560 --> 39:54.320]  Japanese attack and ordered the ships and planes to stand down and that's now
[39:54.320 --> 39:59.300]  been declassified they plan to get us into a war that's so bad that a lot of
[39:59.300 --> 40:03.000]  Americans are going to say well I didn't support the war but damn it we're in a
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.720]  crisis and I got to get behind George Bush and then he may end up being like
[40:06.720 --> 40:12.640]  FDR and just staying in office and I think that is a real threat that we face
[40:12.640 --> 40:17.200]  I mean it's not just Alex Jones or Willie Nelson mainline analysts are talking
[40:17.200 --> 40:22.800]  about eight ten dollar gallon gas martial law in America and they've now put
[40:22.800 --> 40:28.760]  that on the books well yeah you know now one of the one of the things that's
[40:28.760 --> 40:33.720]  being stolen most out there these days is gasoline farmers have to watch their
[40:33.720 --> 40:39.320]  tractors people are stealing gasoline because it is so damn expensive and they
[40:39.320 --> 40:44.200]  it's down to push and shove they need a gallon of gas to get from here to there
[40:44.200 --> 40:48.720]  and at some point people will do anything when it comes down to food
[40:48.720 --> 40:52.720]  that's the next thing on the list they'll do anything to feed their family
[40:52.720 --> 41:00.160]  so we are in for some tough times and then we have to try to somehow educate
[41:00.160 --> 41:03.760]  the public that they have orchestrated this I mean I have the banking documents
[41:03.760 --> 41:07.960]  you have them you've been fighting this since before I was born where the banks
[41:07.960 --> 41:11.080]  well you grew up you know with your family being farmers on a farm in Texas
[41:11.080 --> 41:15.520]  pretty close to where my family's from on my dad's side and and everybody knew
[41:15.520 --> 41:19.480]  back then they were predatory how did they train Americans not to question the
[41:19.480 --> 41:23.720]  establishment and not to question banks I mean when did Americans start losing
[41:23.720 --> 41:28.760]  their sense Willie well when they started controlling the media and when they
[41:28.760 --> 41:34.840]  started telling us from early morning to late dark how well things were going and
[41:34.840 --> 41:38.880]  how things were fine and we shouldn't worry about a thing that you know big
[41:38.880 --> 41:43.680]  brothers taken care of us and now we see what big brother was doing while we were
[41:43.680 --> 41:49.760]  at our backs turn he was taken over stealing everything that we had and now
[41:49.760 --> 41:53.160]  they know that we're waking up to him with Congress for the 9% approval
[41:53.160 --> 41:56.320]  rating for the first time in US history and so they're trying to put a police
[41:56.320 --> 42:00.120]  state into place so that we can't have a counter-revolution against their
[42:00.120 --> 42:04.000]  revolution we're not the revolutionaries here we just want our country back
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.240]  Willie do you have any message to the people in government to the police and
[42:08.240 --> 42:11.800]  others about some of the things we're going to be facing in the near future
[42:11.800 --> 42:15.360]  I mean I've had state police calling in saying I thought you were nuts but now
[42:15.360 --> 42:19.320]  the feds have come in and told us yeah get ready for martial law and you got to
[42:19.320 --> 42:24.480]  do what the president says you have any message to them Willie well except that
[42:24.480 --> 42:28.600]  we have to just you know there's no magic words that I can say that will
[42:28.600 --> 42:33.920]  stop it but I do think all of us together can figure out a way to combat it
[42:33.920 --> 42:39.600]  and keep it from being as bad as it could be I think if we are aware what's
[42:39.600 --> 42:45.240]  going to happen that will keep it from having such a great impact that it would
[42:45.240 --> 42:48.520]  if we were just sitting around blind not knowing that anything was going to hit
[42:48.520 --> 42:53.320]  us at least now we can try to block it one way or another I agree with you that
[42:53.320 --> 42:58.120]  is the key if you expose false flag self-inflicted wounds government
[42:58.120 --> 43:03.080]  sponsored black ops then it takes the power away to where they can't stage it
[43:03.080 --> 43:08.320]  anymore and if you discredit the current system then it loses the people's
[43:08.320 --> 43:11.960]  acquiescence they have to have you to go along with it doesn't mean you have to
[43:11.960 --> 43:15.320]  go out and physically fight them with a rifle it means you just have to not go
[43:15.320 --> 43:19.800]  along and basically in a lot of cases of the police and military just sit on your
[43:19.800 --> 43:25.640]  butts don't go out and kill innocent Iraqis come home if they set off a nuke
[43:25.640 --> 43:30.000]  in Chicago and then try to bring in a national draft as McCain has said this
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.240]  is going to go on with McCain you know or probably Obama you have to then
[43:34.240 --> 43:39.280]  realize that that is a staged event and not go along with it Willie yeah you're
[43:39.280 --> 43:42.680]  absolutely right and I remember hearing a long time ago so what would happen if
[43:42.680 --> 43:48.160]  they started a war and nobody showed up absolutely all right I want to take some
[43:48.160 --> 43:56.240]  phone calls and the house switchboard again is 202 224 3121 202 224 3121
[43:56.240 --> 44:00.120]  ask for the chairman of the house judiciary committee or ask for other
[44:00.120 --> 44:02.320]  members of the committee later in the shutter day I'll give you all their
[44:02.320 --> 44:05.560]  names and I'll even give you their direct lines but those can be busy the
[44:05.560 --> 44:11.880]  switchboard has hundreds of lines and generally isn't 202 224 3121 call them
[44:11.880 --> 44:16.080]  and say look it's it's on record they admit that Bush committed all these
[44:16.080 --> 44:21.640]  crimes they wrote memos saying they could order the troops to torture children
[44:21.640 --> 44:27.000]  there's no debate vote for impeachment and they can't blow up every congressman's
[44:27.000 --> 44:31.600]  air and plane the answer here is all of us to say look we know what you're up to
[44:31.600 --> 44:38.240]  shadow government and just come out with your hands up attention criminals the
[44:38.240 --> 44:42.280]  game is over will your take on that statement well I think you're absolutely
[44:42.280 --> 44:46.160]  right we gotta let them know that hey you're caught we you know you we found
[44:46.160 --> 44:50.800]  your your hand in the cookie jar here and there there are certain consequences
[44:50.800 --> 44:55.040]  involved there first of all you get voted out and then we'll decide what else to
[44:55.040 --> 44:59.440]  do to you but you are wrong you made a mistake you broke the law you have heard
[44:59.440 --> 45:04.640]  our country so there are consequences for that and for Americans out there on
[45:04.640 --> 45:08.040]  the fence about all this unit you got a bad feeling in your in your heart
[45:08.040 --> 45:11.440]  intellectually you know we're in deep trouble you know we've been telling you
[45:11.440 --> 45:14.520]  the truth on this show and many others things are getting more and more serious
[45:14.520 --> 45:17.400]  by the minute it isn't going to get better going down the same path we've
[45:17.400 --> 45:23.400]  got to change course now and a lot of people want to try to over intellectual
[45:23.400 --> 45:26.200]  eyes and say well then what's the specific action it's just getting your
[45:26.200 --> 45:32.720]  heart right get in your mind right and saying no yeah from this moment on you
[45:32.720 --> 45:37.200]  just have to say okay maybe I went along with their stories up until now but I'm
[45:37.200 --> 45:44.320]  not going along with them anymore you know you've lied to me once that's too
[45:44.320 --> 45:49.600]  many times absolutely let's go ahead and take calls can in Texas you're on the
[45:49.600 --> 45:55.640]  air with the one the only the leading legend Willie Nelson go ahead God bless
[45:55.640 --> 45:59.800]  you Alex and Willie I have two quick points the first one I want to tell you
[45:59.800 --> 46:04.040]  how grateful I am Alex for your advertising shade of the scene I feel
[46:04.040 --> 46:09.960]  like I'm 34 years old now like you and the most important point I want to make
[46:09.960 --> 46:18.400]  is any congressman that doesn't support or impeach both for impeachment for the
[46:18.400 --> 46:23.480]  ones that we're speaking of should be fired and put out of office I mean
[46:23.480 --> 46:28.440]  because they're very well aware of the same thing that we're aware of this come
[46:28.440 --> 46:32.800]  to the point that this is extremely serious well just looking at this
[46:32.800 --> 46:37.480]  politically it would gain the Democrats incredible political hay and ensure
[46:37.480 --> 46:40.600]  their victory across the board if they would do it but they won't that's
[46:40.600 --> 46:43.680]  because they're scared they're blackmailed or they're on the take
[46:43.680 --> 46:48.760]  Willie well you're absolutely right there's one of those reasons because they
[46:48.760 --> 46:55.320]  all know that they could stop it if they wanted to obviously there's reasons
[46:55.320 --> 46:59.800]  why they don't want to and I'm sure you hit on one of them anything really no
[46:59.800 --> 47:04.320]  excuse absolutely can I appreciate your call Adam in Texas you're on the air
[47:04.320 --> 47:10.640]  with Willie Nelson bless you both and Willie I've been I've been a part of
[47:10.640 --> 47:20.000]  your life for 1973 and from three days in a toka to to Panther Hall to the
[47:20.000 --> 47:24.960]  sportatorium thanks for all the nights you've given us and we really love you
[47:24.960 --> 47:31.880]  and I was born and raised here in Texas and I'm gonna be moving out of here
[47:31.880 --> 47:36.760]  next month and I'm gonna go north and go up into the mountains and see what
[47:36.760 --> 47:42.760]  happens in our hearts pretty sad right now and but that's what I'm gonna do all
[47:42.760 --> 47:47.680]  right yeah that's I think it's you know I'm glad you remembered a toka because
[47:47.680 --> 47:52.840]  that boy do you remember how dusty that was it was fantastic though they had
[47:52.840 --> 47:57.280]  that path mowed down to the forest all the way down the festival and the music
[47:57.280 --> 48:01.560]  was fantastic the sound was incredible that was that was a great three days
[48:01.560 --> 48:05.800]  Willie well thank you I was wondering if I was gonna have trouble finding the
[48:05.800 --> 48:09.240]  location in the set and I was driving down the interstate and I looked over to
[48:09.240 --> 48:13.760]  the left and a few miles over there I saw this huge dust cloud I said well
[48:13.760 --> 48:19.880]  that's I think that I think we found a toka all right Adam good to hear from
[48:19.880 --> 48:24.000]  you Scott and Arizona you're on the air with Willie Nelson hey Willie and hey
[48:24.000 --> 48:30.760]  Alex um good good I wanted to say this you've done a lot of great concerts in
[48:30.760 --> 48:35.560]  your time as far as like live aid to support the farmers I was thinking that
[48:35.560 --> 48:39.960]  would be great to do something like a 9-1-1 truth concert donate the money
[48:39.960 --> 48:45.520]  to the families that lost the loved ones and firefighters that were out there and
[48:45.520 --> 48:49.920]  also to support Dennis Kucinich what he's doing and it would be great to do
[48:49.920 --> 48:53.760]  that and get a lot of publicity I was wondering oh I would agree I would
[48:53.760 --> 48:58.680]  agree to both of those things in a minute okay Willie wonderful it's a
[48:58.680 --> 49:02.520]  wonderful plan Willie I'm totally freaking out right now you know you gave
[49:02.520 --> 49:05.360]  me your cell phone number another contact and I haven't called you in five
[49:05.360 --> 49:09.240]  months because I'm you're one of the few people I'm actually starstruck by and I
[49:09.240 --> 49:12.000]  was kind of nervous stumbling around calling you this morning to come on the
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.560]  show I have been dreaming of inviting you to New York this year for the
[49:16.560 --> 49:20.080]  anniversary getting some hall just having you speak or you know play your
[49:20.080 --> 49:24.040]  acoustic guitar and we know the first responders the heads of the victims
[49:24.040 --> 49:29.880]  family groups or to even have a benefit here in Austin for the firefighters and
[49:29.880 --> 49:33.720]  police but I know you're so busy and you've already done so much for 9-11
[49:33.720 --> 49:39.640]  truth but since the caller brings it up maybe I should talk to you off air later
[49:39.640 --> 49:44.000]  today about doing something like that because I think we're talking about
[49:44.000 --> 49:50.040]  solutions or a free concert somewhere as a media event to say a no attack on Iran
[49:50.040 --> 49:54.240]  yes to impeachment deal that might be good like a like it'd probably be like
[49:54.240 --> 49:59.880]  Woodstock Willie I think you're right and I think the people want to find a way
[49:59.880 --> 50:05.760]  to speak out and let their voices be heard and that's what you and I need to
[50:05.760 --> 50:10.920]  do is to give them a way to do that we'll we'll find a hall or a field or
[50:10.920 --> 50:14.760]  something somewhere and we'll go go go over there and we'll give people a
[50:14.760 --> 50:18.920]  chance to stand up and talk about what they believe in I just want to thank
[50:18.920 --> 50:23.960]  Scott calling from Arizona who I don't know from Adam because I just I just can't
[50:23.960 --> 50:28.560]  I can't ever ask for things from the celebrities I know just because I don't
[50:28.560 --> 50:31.680]  want to feel like I'm bugging them but Willie it gives so much this is just
[50:31.680 --> 50:35.840]  incredible for all the station thank you and I want to say to Scott before you
[50:35.840 --> 50:40.080]  take off to the mountains up there hang around a little while and and watch all
[50:40.080 --> 50:43.760]  this stuff come down and you know if there's something happens really bad
[50:43.760 --> 50:48.480]  I'll go to the mountains with you but in the meantime let's stay here and fight
[50:48.480 --> 50:51.440]  those guys all right we're gonna skip this break to here we go behind the
[50:51.440 --> 50:57.680]  scenes Willie Nelson Willie speak of the devil you know you've got your great
[50:57.680 --> 51:02.640]  places out of the pertinels and stuff I'm my wife's even instinctively saying
[51:02.640 --> 51:06.640]  we got to get a place out by Fredericks burger Johnson City we gotta we get you
[51:06.640 --> 51:09.680]  and you know women always have that instinct and she never been like this
[51:09.680 --> 51:13.480]  and she this morning she's saying we got to go try to buy some land or a house I
[51:13.480 --> 51:17.120]  want to get the hell out of this city and all the women I know are talking like
[51:17.120 --> 51:20.840]  that that always tells me something when the women think something really bad's
[51:20.840 --> 51:26.640]  coming that kind of worries me well you know they have that intuition that you
[51:26.640 --> 51:33.080]  and I both know it's usually right you know I think it's I think it's gonna be
[51:33.080 --> 51:37.160]  a depression Willie what do you think oh I think we're already in a depression
[51:37.160 --> 51:41.760]  and it just depends on where you are if you just lost your home and your job
[51:41.760 --> 51:47.160]  and you're out on the streets you're in a depression if it hadn't happened to you
[51:47.160 --> 51:52.400]  yet God bless you because hang on there's some bad things going on out there
[51:52.400 --> 51:56.600]  and hopefully it won't hit you but we are in a depression there's a lot of
[51:56.600 --> 52:00.160]  people suffering right now in this country and and have been for a long
[52:00.160 --> 52:06.840]  time and the fact that we're just now talking about a possible depression is
[52:06.840 --> 52:11.200]  it shouldn't let everybody know that hey we must be in one if we're talking
[52:11.200 --> 52:15.840]  about it unbelievable we're on air for the viewers on the internet right now
[52:15.840 --> 52:18.760]  Willie so we're not really behind the scenes but when is a good time for me to
[52:18.760 --> 52:28.800]  call you to talk about this idea of doing some type of anti-war slash 9-11
[52:28.800 --> 52:34.280]  truth I mean we've only got a few months so obviously we want to set it up as
[52:34.280 --> 52:39.360]  quickly as possible I mean if you really want to do that you know whether we do
[52:39.360 --> 52:42.800]  it somewhere in upstate New York because it's near New York or whether we do it
[52:42.800 --> 52:46.960]  somewhere outside Austin I mean if you're really serious about one and I
[52:46.960 --> 52:50.960]  know you you always step to the plate if you really want to do that we need to
[52:50.960 --> 52:55.640]  get on it well yeah and there's two or three things that are two or three
[52:55.640 --> 52:59.160]  options there and we need to figure out it just exactly which one we want to do
[52:59.160 --> 53:03.840]  where we want to do it because you say as you say we're running out of time and
[53:03.840 --> 53:08.400]  we don't have too much time to figure out what we're going to do but I'm you
[53:08.400 --> 53:13.920]  know I'm ready to go to New York or Austin any time it might even be good
[53:13.920 --> 53:19.080]  to Denver's totally booked up but people do anything for Willie Nelson I'm
[53:19.080 --> 53:22.640]  going to cover Denver and the microwave guns and the police state and the free
[53:22.640 --> 53:25.840]  speech zones I'm also planning to go to the RNC but I've already booked for
[53:25.840 --> 53:33.480]  Denver maybe if we had some type of event in a field or somewhere or at it
[53:33.480 --> 53:38.640]  you know some place outside Denver or in Denver we could that might put I know you
[53:38.640 --> 53:45.120]  I'd heard you might be even playing in Denver in association with the DNC and I
[53:45.120 --> 53:49.920]  know you might I want out there yeah they have they've hired me in the van to
[53:49.920 --> 53:55.640]  come play so you know we'll be their full force well I don't want to stir
[53:55.640 --> 53:58.680]  something up with that but if that's a choice you want to do you make the call
[53:58.680 --> 54:01.800]  Willie and then I can I mean you've got the organization but if you want me to
[54:01.800 --> 54:05.800]  try to organize that I can whatever happens I want to hold you till five
[54:05.800 --> 54:09.360]  after in the next hour so we have enough time to finish up on the farm stuff is
[54:09.360 --> 54:13.560]  that okay oh that's fine and as far as what we're going to do let's let's
[54:13.560 --> 54:18.000]  concentrate on New York or Austin I don't think Denver would be an
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.080]  appropriate place for me to go do something like that I agree with you I
[54:21.080 --> 54:33.680]  was just throwing an idea out here we go Willie we got 10 more minutes okay man
[54:33.680 --> 54:40.520]  this is feeling good Willie Nelson Alex Jones brainstorming about a 9-11
[54:40.520 --> 54:52.320]  truth stock minus the yellow acid this is amazing
[54:52.320 --> 54:57.200]  incredible Willie we've only gone about five minutes left in this segment four
[54:57.200 --> 54:59.880]  minutes in the next and I'm gonna let you go because you're very busy and have
[54:59.880 --> 55:03.560]  your own XM radio show coming up today before we take a few final calls and
[55:03.560 --> 55:07.720]  talk about the depression that we see unfolding and really hurting the farmers
[55:07.720 --> 55:11.080]  and ranchers more than ever fire out some of the websites your peace
[55:11.080 --> 55:15.080]  organization some of the groups that people can get involved with you in to
[55:15.080 --> 55:18.240]  really try to be the change we want to see in the world
[55:18.240 --> 55:25.680]  sure yeah you know farm 8.org is you know it's the big address for people we're
[55:25.680 --> 55:31.080]  doing farm 8 on September the 20th up in Boston and if we can call attention to
[55:31.080 --> 55:35.680]  that and you know it bring as many people as we can to rally around the
[55:35.680 --> 55:40.480]  house up there that would be great well my heart's beating in a few things
[55:40.480 --> 55:43.360]  excite me anymore Willie because I've seen quite a bit not as much as you but
[55:43.360 --> 55:47.560]  I'm actually got butterflies let me just put you on the spot did you get
[55:47.560 --> 55:51.280]  butterflies and excited when we when we just spontaneously because of a caller
[55:51.280 --> 55:58.640]  decided to do some type of truth rally well you know I'm always looking for
[55:58.640 --> 56:03.920]  excitement and if you know it'll finish doing something that I love to do and
[56:03.920 --> 56:08.240]  believe in well it doesn't get any better than that you know and I love to
[56:08.240 --> 56:14.960]  play music and I love audiences crowds but there's also something that's
[56:14.960 --> 56:19.440]  gratifying about saying what you believe you know and doing the right thing
[56:19.440 --> 56:23.240]  again I Willie I know you hate people telling you how great you are but let
[56:23.240 --> 56:26.600]  me tell you I just love you to death and love your courage and your passion and
[56:26.600 --> 56:30.720]  your spirit you know the time I got to meet you in person it was it was really
[56:30.720 --> 56:36.000]  intense to to you know be around you in person you're just an amazing individual
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.440]  and I just wish to God we had more people like Willie Nelson give out the
[56:40.440 --> 56:48.200]  peace Institute website as well yeah please it's Willie Nelson PRI dot com
[56:48.200 --> 56:56.560]  Peace Research Institute and and FarmA.org you just stay in touch and
[56:56.560 --> 57:02.080]  let's put our heads together and see what we can do to to get peace in the
[57:02.080 --> 57:06.880]  world and also in doing that will not only help the family farmer will help
[57:06.880 --> 57:11.080]  everybody else let me just recap for everybody Dennis Kacinich going into the
[57:11.080 --> 57:15.040]  belly of the beast this Friday and the Judiciary Committee in the House
[57:15.040 --> 57:20.760]  presenting the the crimes of the Bush administration this is just unparalleled
[57:20.760 --> 57:25.040]  in history and there's almost no media coverage demand there be coverage of this
[57:25.040 --> 57:28.360]  and we salute Willie Nelson for stepping up to the plate today to come on the
[57:28.360 --> 57:32.080]  air and try to bring attention to this and no doubt it will let's talk to Tom
[57:32.080 --> 57:35.040]  in Oregon Tom you're on the air with Willie Nelson quickly
[57:35.040 --> 57:41.640]  I've been a long-time fan and I'm just kind of getting into the prison planet
[57:41.640 --> 57:47.960]  and everything goes with it don't you guys think that the whole mess that this
[57:47.960 --> 57:53.240]  country and the world is in right now all has to be a revolve around energy
[57:53.240 --> 58:00.240]  and I think we need to make huge leap for energy I'm I don't think these baby
[58:00.240 --> 58:05.600]  steps that were taken I I really have a feeling that Otis T. Carr and Ralph
[58:05.600 --> 58:10.160]  Ring and George I don't know if you've heard of Gordon Ovel but I think they
[58:10.160 --> 58:15.320]  they're on to something that all the governments of the world don't want us
[58:15.320 --> 58:20.680]  citizens to know about and that's zero point energy stay stay there Tom we're
[58:20.680 --> 58:24.040]  going to come back final segment with Willie Nelson after a 72nd break only
[58:24.040 --> 58:28.320]  five minutes left because earlier he wanted to get into energy reform and so
[58:28.320 --> 58:31.880]  we'll come back Willie is a big end of that final segment with Willie Nelson

[1:00:04.080 --> 1:00:11.400]  answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now
[1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:21.440]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones folks I am as happy as I have been in my life
[1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:27.200]  except for the birth of my three children because I know that I have a
[1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:32.760]  blind spot I can't make myself bug big celebrities or ask for things from them
[1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:37.880]  and Willie such a nice guy that if he thinks in his heart it's a good thing
[1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:41.480]  to do he'll generally do it and that's what I've been told by folks who've
[1:00:41.480 --> 1:00:44.720]  known him for decades and now he just says yeah let's do a 9-11 slash
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:48.500]  impeachment anti-randial so we're gonna be setting that up in the next month
[1:00:48.500 --> 1:00:52.360]  there's some next couple months whenever Willie wants to do it in closing I
[1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:55.720]  know we got loaded phones but we're out of time we'll have Willie back
[1:00:55.720 --> 1:00:59.200]  undoubtedly and the last three or four minutes we've got sir earlier you were
[1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:03.480]  trying to get into when we went to break energy dependence and systems to get off
[1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:07.760]  of it they're demonizing ethanol but that's from corn you're talking about the
[1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:13.080]  cooking oil and trash and the pig farms and the chicken farms you're talking
[1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:17.360]  about systems that use the waste we're just dumping in rivers right now to
[1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:22.600]  create cleaner burning fuels in closing Willie Nelson that's a way to create a
[1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:25.000]  new economy as you have said as a visionary and you've got all the
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:29.920]  evidence to re-energize the family farm and and and try to save what we've got
[1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:35.800]  left and get us off of the oil absolutely and we can do it we have the
[1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:41.040]  ability to do it we have the resources and I think the secret is to keep it
[1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:45.680]  local and sustainable if you have something in around you that farmers
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:51.960]  grow that you can use use it anytime you import something it costs more and
[1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:56.120]  it pollutes the environment anytime you can buy it locally you're getting
[1:01:56.120 --> 1:01:59.360]  healthier food because you know where it's coming from so I think the
[1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:03.240]  important thing for us to do is to make sure that we support our local
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:08.640]  agriculture our local economy and not become dependent on bringing in
[1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:12.200]  everything from around the world because you look at your table with where
[1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:16.680]  you ate breakfast this morning and everything on your plate probably came
[1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:21.760]  from 12 to 1500 miles away and that's a huge waste it could have been done
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:26.640]  outside your back door by farmers that you know now just 70 years ago I would
[1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:30.840]  guess growing up in North Central Texas that everything on your plate every
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:35.000]  morning was from right there in the little town you grew up in and habit
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:39.520]  Texas we had our own chickens and we still had eggs and we grew our own
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:45.720]  beef and we had hogs out there that we grew and we had a garden so we pretty
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:50.840]  much were self-sufficient and I think probably out in the festivity because of
[1:02:50.840 --> 1:02:55.200]  the high prices of everything we're going to have to get back to that kind of
[1:02:55.200 --> 1:03:00.080]  living again and honestly I think it will be good for us to go back to the
[1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:04.320]  basics and be able to take care of ourselves without having to depend on
[1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:09.360]  somebody on the other side of the world absolutely you can find all of his
[1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:13.760]  websites through willy nelson.com you can also find out about all the
[1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:18.400]  prolific new records new albums you've been putting out Willie I've been
[1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:23.280]  reading all the reviews to quite a few of the reviews the reviewers are saying
[1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:27.440]  that you seem to like a fine wine be getting even better now that you had
[1:03:27.440 --> 1:03:32.480]  your 75th birthday are you hitting kind of your third or fourth
[1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:39.600]  wind here? I'm breaking wind right now I think that's a good joke you know I mean
[1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:43.480]  like you're a jogger I mean you know you're like seem to be energized I
[1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:50.120]  well yeah I do have a lot of energy and I ride a bike and you know I do what I
[1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:54.800]  can to try to get rid of the energy and then I do a two-hour show on the stage
[1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:59.920]  every night so at the end of the day I try to get well spent that's the secret
[1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:07.160]  I think to be in healthy spiritually mentally is to do a lot of exercise and
[1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:11.680]  keep your body going. And you talk a lot about that in your book with Turk
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:16.360]  Pibkin the Tao of Willie a New York Times bestseller be sure and get that as
[1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:20.920]  well Willie I am completely blown away by this interview and I I since
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:25.600]  destiny here something big and I pray that this does happen and we just
[1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:30.400]  appreciate all your time I'll say body you off air here in just a moment and I

[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:47.080]  and then get into of these three murders we just had Bobby's murder
[1:09:47.080 --> 1:09:51.680]  anniversary last week assassination last week just whatever area you want to get
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:10:04.280]  into well that's a pretty deep well Alex I I guess I began well I grew like
[1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:11.520]  like probably like you did many others as a son of America hard-working middle
[1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:17.840]  class parents who had been immigrants from Ireland and infused with the with
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:24.720]  the blessings of this republic and and the dream came came here struggled went
[1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:33.760]  to public schools what happened to be a ball player was baseball player and that
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:41.080]  enabled me to take examination to private school went into a into a private
[1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:45.880]  school late in my secondary education that on to went on to Columbia and a
[1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:51.800]  scholarship took two degrees there and played sports there went to Cuba in 59
[1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:56.000]  as with one other member of the Columbia baseball team to play in a sports
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:01.920]  festival and and these these things started to open up one's eyes because the
[1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:07.160]  pictures and I spent a fair amount of time with the with Castro and and with
[1:11:07.160 --> 1:11:13.080]  Guevara as a young ball player and both the language so had an opportunity to
[1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:16.320]  learn a bit about what was what was really going on what was behind that
[1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:22.440]  revolution and and why America had supported dictatorships for a for
[1:11:22.440 --> 1:11:29.480]  almost 60 years before the Castro revolution so what started as a 12
[1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:34.240]  year old who could only find black kids to play baseball with on the in the heat
[1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:38.080]  of the summer requiring me to go into the ghetto and start and see for the
[1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:42.280]  first time how those people lived and had raised questions in my mind about
[1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:46.480]  how what was going on that socioeconomically in the society then
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:52.320]  carried on to through the Cuban experience and then eventually I went to
[1:11:52.320 --> 1:12:00.760]  London and met a number of developing world potential developing world leaders
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:05.960]  who had different perspectives also on on America I was at LSE and that was
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:14.720]  where of course the the Rockefellers sent David early on in order to understand
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:23.280]  a bit about the world and Joe Joe Kennedy sent sent John it was it was
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:31.320]  regarded as the place to go in terms of becoming aware of of the world but that
[1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:37.920]  that led me into reform politics thinking that perhaps one could manipulate a
[1:12:37.920 --> 1:12:45.040]  system and make it a little bit better so I came back to the state led a reform
[1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:49.080]  movement in Westchester County New York it became fairly the very young guy
[1:12:49.080 --> 1:12:55.320]  became fairly controversial with that then Bob Kennedy asked me to run his
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:13:01.520]  campaign in Westchester which was a heavily Republican County and when he
[1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:09.600]  ran for the Senate in 1964 so I became his citizen's chairman and at that at
[1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:14.920]  that point in time eventually just led through a one human rights positions
[1:13:14.920 --> 1:13:17.120]  head of the director of Director of the Commission of Human Rights for New
[1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:21.120]  Rushelle City was about to burn down was called a little rock of the north and
[1:13:21.120 --> 1:13:26.120]  the only way we could stop it from burning was to put bodies in the streets
[1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:31.120]  and around country clubs of people who were discriminating against blacks and
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:35.760]  and in terms of housing and education and certainly the skilled trade unions
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:40.960]  electrical workers union still held their meetings in Italian at that in that
[1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:44.680]  city at that time so we had to crack all of that the only way you could crack it
[1:13:44.680 --> 1:13:48.880]  was not by using the fair housing laws or the equal employment law you had to
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:53.320]  actually put bodies in the streets and stop an urban renewal project and going
[1:13:53.320 --> 1:13:58.240]  forward and that was the only language that that they understood roads to power
[1:13:58.240 --> 1:14:05.280]  being through money and numbers that we we managed to mobilize numbers that led
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:10.880]  giving you very brief summary because you asked for a little no but it's
[1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:14.240]  important it's important you know a little self-conscious about doing it
[1:14:14.240 --> 1:14:19.640]  we that led to Vietnam I was just very troubled about the war as a young guy
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:26.080]  and I got a journalist credentials and got accredited by Mac Vee the
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:30.360]  accrediting agency over there at the time and spent a lot of time out in the
[1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:34.680]  country and just saw a lot of things that turned my stomach and made me
[1:14:34.680 --> 1:14:42.920]  disgusted and very very uneasy and I guess I blew my my I didn't write
[1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:46.520]  anything when I was there I just took a lot of photographs never developed any
[1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:55.040]  film kept it all we were hit once going into a into Plague who see 130 on the
[1:14:55.040 --> 1:14:59.880]  way in and had a rough landing and I hurt my back and had to go back into
[1:14:59.880 --> 1:15:07.800]  Saigon and the first time I'd come out of the country and I was bit I just
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:15.560]  angry some friends took me to a party and Vietnamese a shield attached
[1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:20.680]  herself to me that evening and drew from me what I really was feeling and
[1:15:20.680 --> 1:15:27.080]  seeing out there and next morning I was summoned into into the accrediting
[1:15:27.080 --> 1:15:32.920]  officer's office commander Madison told me that he thought that they were
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:37.200]  worried about me and I could lose my life out there I wasn't attending their
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:42.520]  briefings and by God I should probably go on home I probably sounds like I'd
[1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:50.320]  hurt my back anyway and and I told him I I gathered they were uncomfortable with
[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:55.680]  my presence but I wanted to go into a place called Tainin before I left and
[1:15:55.680 --> 1:16:00.800]  he said what do you want to go to Tainin for he said the the con control that
[1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:04.960]  area I said I want to go there because there's a leprosarium and I want to see
[1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:09.640]  how those lepers are treated because I think you learn a lot about a people by
[1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:14.640]  the way they treat the most degraded and despised and shunned and in their
[1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:19.480]  social units and I want to see how they were how they treat those lepers and he
[1:16:19.480 --> 1:16:24.000]  thought I was looked at me like I was a nutter and I said I need a chopper to go
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:27.440]  in there would you give me a chopper he said no we won't give you a chopper we
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:31.360]  can't afford to give you a chopper but we'll give you a jeep with a driver and
[1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:35.960]  I said I'll get back to you on that and I talked to some friends they said look
[1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:41.360]  you really better get out of here I mean jeeps with drivers don't work and the
[1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:44.680]  last guy they gave a jeep with a driver was found by the side of the road and
[1:16:44.680 --> 1:16:48.640]  he's got a pretty clear message you better you better leave here because
[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:53.240]  they're gonna find a way to to catch you one way yes I went I left anyway went
[1:16:53.240 --> 1:17:00.280]  back and then wrote some things but the article that that was probably the most
[1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:05.320]  damning was called Children of Vietnam and was published in ramparts in January
[1:17:05.320 --> 1:17:13.600]  of 1967 my goodness Alex how long ago that is Martin King was a subscriber he
[1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:21.120]  saw it he almost threw up at the Atlanta Airport on his way to the Caribbean when
[1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:25.720]  he thumbed through it and he saw the photographs that I published and when he
[1:17:25.720 --> 1:17:31.240]  got back he asked to meet with me and that of course started a relationship
[1:17:31.240 --> 1:17:35.320]  the last year of his life I had been in the south and civil rights work at
[1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:42.280]  various times in the 60s and on the film of March and events like that but I'd
[1:17:42.280 --> 1:17:47.000]  never met him I just was a young you know student from the north but this then
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:51.400]  brought him directly into touch and I opened my files to him at his request
[1:17:51.400 --> 1:17:57.840]  and he had he just became nauseous he visibly cried when he saw the horror of
[1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:00.880]  that war and that's showing the real humanity people love to demonize
[1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:04.920]  Martin Luther King or go along with the FBI files that were complete mis
[1:18:04.920 --> 1:18:08.280]  representations but I talked to a lot of folks that actually knew him and they
[1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:13.000]  say I mean you can tell those speeches that passion you can't lie I mean that
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:17.120]  type of passion comes across that's why he was so powerful it wasn't just the
[1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:21.560]  words or the tone you could I mean Martin Luther King believed what he was
[1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:26.360]  saying and was a very deep man was he not oh yeah there's there's no question
[1:18:26.360 --> 1:18:31.200]  about it I committed the last year of my last year of his life to working with
[1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:35.120]  him he asked me to head the National Conference for new politics which was a
[1:18:35.120 --> 1:18:39.960]  an umbrella organization that had to go over all of the peace and poverty
[1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:44.800]  groups and potentially move mobilized for a third-party ticket of himself and
[1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:48.400]  Ben Spock and that's why they killed a large large a large convention in
[1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:53.320]  Chicago over 5,000 delegates from all over the all over the country but it was
[1:18:53.320 --> 1:18:59.920]  subverted was infiltrated and subverted and I introduced him I was I was
[1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:05.560]  executive director of the event they introduced him and I want when he was
[1:19:05.560 --> 1:19:10.520]  speaking I was passed a note that said you better get him out of here and as he
[1:19:10.520 --> 1:19:14.000]  finishes speaking or we're gonna take him hostage and embarrass him for the
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:19.360]  world and that came from a black caucus and one of the first black caucus
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:26.400]  supposedly black caucus groups that was formed but what we didn't realize at
[1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:30.720]  the time that that black caucus was largely being led by Blackstone Rangers
[1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:35.120]  and others who were on the pay of the federal government and who were there
[1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:40.080]  strictly for the purpose of using their blackness and black radicalism to take
[1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:43.560]  control yeah they want to radicalize things to then discredit you know we're
[1:19:43.560 --> 1:19:47.000]  gonna skip this break with William Pepper because I want to have plenty of
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:51.320]  time to talk to him here we go
[1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:57.680]  yes William I skipped that break in the next four minutes let's up finish up
[1:19:57.680 --> 1:20:01.360]  kind of your awakening then his murder and then you're in a big lawsuit right
[1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:04.560]  now we can get into that or talk about Bobby whatever you want for the rest of
[1:20:04.560 --> 1:20:11.800]  the hour please continue well the the they they killed Martin of course and on
[1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:18.360]  April 4 60 68 he delivered his his speech against the war on April 4 67 called
[1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:22.000]  me very late that night after delivered at Riverside called me very late that
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:25.080]  night said now you got to have to stay with me on this it's gonna get tough
[1:20:25.080 --> 1:20:30.120]  because they're all going to reject me and by that he meant all of his so-called
[1:20:30.120 --> 1:20:34.520]  former friends from this in the civil rights movement because they were afraid
[1:20:34.520 --> 1:20:38.760]  they're gonna lose their their federal funding and and he was right they all
[1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:43.480]  walked away from him the New York Times called him a traitor but he used him
[1:20:43.480 --> 1:20:49.680]  effectively of treason and and but that we was undaunted he lost all that
[1:20:49.680 --> 1:20:54.600]  support he almost was losing the support of his own congregation who adored him
[1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:59.480]  and he said to me at one point in February he said you've got to come
[1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:04.920]  down here and and and speak to my my people and I said what do you mean so
[1:21:04.920 --> 1:21:08.000]  you got to come down here on a Sunday and take the pulpit and you got to speak
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:12.640]  to my people and you got to tell them why I have to pose this war and I said
[1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:16.400]  Martin I thought he'd gone around the bend you want a white kid from the north
[1:21:16.400 --> 1:21:20.680]  to come down and talk to your people these are your people and he waved his
[1:21:20.680 --> 1:21:25.600]  finger but he said no you've been there you've seen it you tell them they'll
[1:21:25.600 --> 1:21:31.400]  believe you you've got to explain to them why I have to do what I'm doing and he
[1:21:31.400 --> 1:21:36.440]  was adamant about it so I went down I took the pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist
[1:21:36.440 --> 1:21:41.040]  Church and I want to call it preaching but I spoke to those those folks and
[1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:45.080]  think at the end of it they had a better picture of why their beloved
[1:21:45.080 --> 1:21:49.440]  pastor had to had to come out against this war and this is an example of the
[1:21:49.440 --> 1:21:54.120]  grip of brainwashing the American people were when even black folks whose
[1:21:54.120 --> 1:21:58.360]  preacher was Martin Luther King who'd seen churches bombed and people shot
[1:21:58.360 --> 1:22:05.000]  and dogs put on children still buying in to the lie and then people say you know
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:08.240]  ask people to be leaders and stand up against evil but then when it really
[1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:14.520]  gets tough people get deserted and it's just amazing yeah please continue it
[1:22:14.520 --> 1:22:19.400]  it's kind of like the rejection of the Prophet in his own time and and that was
[1:22:19.400 --> 1:22:25.680]  going on but we continued and throughout 67 and of course the 100
[1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:32.040]  cities burned between 67 68 so there was a enormous paranoia had to war
[1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:36.720]  activity and an enormous economic deprivation the inner cities causing
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:42.560]  great disruption turbulence and so that the the military in particular was very
[1:22:42.560 --> 1:22:49.240]  very ill at ease and they started to develop a plan when you know in in 67
[1:22:49.240 --> 1:22:56.280]  to eliminate King because he was giving credibility to the anti-war movement
[1:22:56.280 --> 1:23:03.680]  like no one else had he was bringing in white liberals from the north and he
[1:23:03.680 --> 1:23:07.920]  was potentially threatening all of the bottom lines of the major corporations
[1:23:07.920 --> 1:23:13.160]  that were making fortunes on that war as they do in all wars and so he really
[1:23:13.160 --> 1:23:18.400]  became increasingly intolerable and and that led to his death and when they
[1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:24.760]  killed him Spock and I Ben Spock and I went down to the memorial and then to
[1:23:24.760 --> 1:23:29.920]  the funeral in Atlanta and Bobby asked to be to come up and talk to him about
[1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:34.120]  the presidential campaign because he had declared that he was going to run and I
[1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:38.440]  just didn't I said I've had enough of politics in this country at this point
[1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:43.520]  I'm sick of it I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna go away for a while
[1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:48.400]  and do something else so I didn't go to see Bob Kennedy that's what Jesse
[1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:53.200]  Ventura just did he said the country's gone and gave up but you came back I
[1:23:53.200 --> 1:23:56.560]  hope he comes back and we're gonna join some stations right now mr. Pepper here
[1:23:56.560 --> 1:23:58.840]  we go
[1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:03.440]  talking to William Pepper he's seen it all been a lawyer for the Kennedys
[1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:08.360]  during their campaigns well for for Bobby worked very close with Martin Luther
[1:24:08.360 --> 1:24:14.720]  King and he's doing so much there's no way to cover it all he's involved in
[1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:19.680]  lawsuits exposing the MLK assassination he he for years most the evidence we have
[1:24:19.680 --> 1:24:23.640]  of the MLK being killed in the open and shut case he went and proved let's try to
[1:24:23.640 --> 1:24:26.720]  condense that down and talk about your lawsuit that's taking place right now
[1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:37.080]  well then we had of course in terms of the King case when we became aware in
[1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:42.920]  1978 Abernathy asked me to go up to the prison interrogate James actually was
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:49.640]  77 I I thought he he he'd lost it because what we'd all been convinced that
[1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:55.480]  James was guilty and he had no reason to doubt that at the time because again is
[1:24:55.480 --> 1:25:01.240]  our naive hey right so I told Ralph I don't know anything about the case and
[1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:05.160]  it took me several months to read everything get and it and understand
[1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:09.440]  what went on and then we went up the sea ray and and the brushing mountain
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:12.800]  penitentiary and I interviewed him for five hours they put it through a lot of
[1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:19.240]  stress had a body language expert a psychiatrist from Harvard was a friend
[1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:22.960]  of mine how he Barron's come up and he sat there he was job was to stare at
[1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:28.080]  Ray throughout the session because I as I dressed him just to see what you know
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:32.360]  how we body movements were reacting anyway at the end of the five hours we
[1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:38.960]  all Abernathy myself parents we came away with a view that rated do it he was
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:42.200]  definitely not the shooter he demonstrated this little knowledge
[1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:46.480]  actually of weapons why he had bought one gun and exchanged it for another it
[1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:50.560]  just didn't like this a lot things didn't make any sense at all it's stunk
[1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:56.280]  it's stunk right but we didn't know what role he might have played so I then
[1:25:56.280 --> 1:26:01.400]  started to go into Memphis on my own in 78 and started to snoop around and that's
[1:26:01.400 --> 1:26:05.720]  snooping around of course is continued for about well it's now 30 years although
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:12.840]  it's virtually done and and I lived in the streets went into shelters and
[1:26:12.840 --> 1:26:18.120]  befriended homeless people and drank in the bars because those are the people
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:22.280]  who really knew what happened and I started to get a picture of what really
[1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:28.800]  happened there and Ray kept asking me to represent him and I kept refusing I
[1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:32.920]  said I got to be confused I got to be good if I have it confirmed to my own
[1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:37.800]  head that you didn't you had no role in the killing of Martin King and took 10
[1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:43.000]  years Alex and finally in 88 I agreed to represent James O'Reilly with his
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:49.400]  lawyer for the last ten years of his life and we failed to get a trial for him
[1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:54.440]  a new trial for him we struggled we had a television trial which was very real
[1:26:54.440 --> 1:26:59.240]  and very dynamic I've seen that is incredible yeah and the jury took seven
[1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:03.160]  hours to find him not guilty had a fraction of the evidence that then
[1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:07.680]  emerged where people started calling and providing information I did a first
[1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:15.320]  book called orders kill which developed the all the evidence we had and then and
[1:27:15.320 --> 1:27:18.680]  the involvement let's briefly skip ahead now and then go back but I want to plug
[1:27:18.680 --> 1:27:24.560]  your new book now before we forget yeah well the the the the second book and
[1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:30.480]  the paperback of it has just come out is called a act of state and that brought
[1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:37.360]  the evidence up to a trial that we held in 1999 I represented the King family
[1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:44.000]  and we we we tried a case over 30 days with 70 witnesses was a civil action the
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:50.560]  family sued one of the people that I uncovered as being a key player in the
[1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:55.240]  assassination at the local level fellow called Lloyd showers we brought an
[1:27:55.240 --> 1:28:00.960]  enormous amount of evidence to bear and against showers it took that jury 59
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:06.400]  minutes to find that of course the ray had nothing to do with the killing and
[1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:12.040]  that responsibility lay 70% with the government the United States and the
[1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:18.800]  government of the of Tennessee and Memphis and 30% with showers who was a
[1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:23.480]  minor player in the whole thing but of course that that verdict was was and
[1:28:23.480 --> 1:28:27.640]  that result and that evidence is buried to the present time t&n is
[1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:32.040]  presently running a documentary they call it an investigation that they did
[1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:36.200]  with the total distortion and disinformation which didn't deal with
[1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:40.960]  the evidence in the trial at all didn't reveal to the people that we subpoenaed
[1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:44.840]  all the prosecutors tried to get them to appear and they ran for cover and got
[1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:49.040]  the court of appeals to give them protection so they didn't have to testify
[1:28:49.040 --> 1:28:55.160]  and be a be embarrassed but t&n ignores all of that kind of information and they
[1:28:55.160 --> 1:29:00.920]  there is an effort as you know Alex and so many areas of public life in America
[1:29:00.920 --> 1:29:07.520]  where there's been public wrong doing to cover up and to spread for all time on
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:12.240]  the history books the official story and I found Fox News with its cartoonish
[1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:17.200]  ridiculousness gives CNN and cover because they can act more credible but
[1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:20.520]  in a lot of ways puts out even more dangerous propaganda because it's
[1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:24.920]  slicker yes you're absolutely right about that so anyway we well hold on sir
[1:29:24.920 --> 1:29:28.440]  we're gonna skip this break for stations out there we're gonna continue
[1:29:28.440 --> 1:29:32.320]  talking but I I I do want to digress with William Pepper because there's so
[1:29:32.320 --> 1:29:35.400]  many things I want to bring up so when we get back to the full stations in three
[1:29:35.400 --> 1:29:38.880]  minutes will continue but behind the scenes were present planet TV viewers
[1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:42.480]  and infowars.com audio streamlusters we're gonna keep talking to William
[1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:48.240]  Pepper right now yeah William I'm sorry to break that up only some stations and
[1:29:48.240 --> 1:29:51.520]  and people pick up these behind the scenes three minute breaks I just want
[1:29:51.520 --> 1:29:54.360]  to waste time with you we'll come back and pick up with where you were at in
[1:29:54.360 --> 1:29:57.120]  three minutes but right now I want to digress because your knowledge is so
[1:29:57.120 --> 1:30:02.040]  wide-ranging obviously Bush wants to go into Iran a lot of people in Congress
[1:30:02.040 --> 1:30:06.640]  Dennis Kucinich Ron Paul they say it's green-lighted I have obviously sources
[1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:10.360]  and CIA as you do we're saying oh it's green-lighted they're intending to do it
[1:30:10.360 --> 1:30:15.680]  in October of September or October barring a miracle a do you think that's
[1:30:15.680 --> 1:30:18.480]  that we're leaning towards that that it looks like the globalists are gonna do
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:26.200]  it the the Bush cronies I I think I mean Seymour Hersh of course also has his
[1:30:26.200 --> 1:30:29.800]  own sources and he's he's indicated that it looks like they're going to do it I
[1:30:29.800 --> 1:30:36.960]  think I think they they certainly want to do it I think that the signs are right
[1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:42.040]  there even the setting of the deputy secretary of state burns as a kind of a
[1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:47.960]  cover to a futile meeting just so they could be able to say at some point we'll
[1:30:47.960 --> 1:30:52.160]  look look how far we went we've tried everything we even talked about opening
[1:30:52.160 --> 1:30:58.520]  a services section in the in in Tehran it's a perfect replay where they're
[1:30:58.520 --> 1:31:02.600]  now saying Iraq had nukes now you changed the last letter now Iran has nukes
[1:31:02.600 --> 1:31:07.720]  and it's the same fake to taunt the same fake diplomacy when we now have all
[1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:12.360]  their declassified documents all of that was false with Iraq even when they told
[1:31:12.360 --> 1:31:17.040]  Saddam you can leave the country they had plans to shoot his airplane down I I
[1:31:17.040 --> 1:31:20.520]  think that I think that's absolutely right I think there's no question that
[1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:25.800]  that they want to do this I think the question is only one of timing they may
[1:31:25.800 --> 1:31:31.000]  well wait until after the November election to see if McCain wins of
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:35.400]  McCain wins then they may leave it to him because it's pretty evident that
[1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:40.920]  he's he's playing with the same deck and he's got the same mindset if Obama
[1:31:40.920 --> 1:31:46.080]  should win there's more of a question mark there so I think I would not be
[1:31:46.080 --> 1:31:51.160]  surprised to see it launch before Obama took office that he'd be saddled with
[1:31:51.160 --> 1:31:55.880]  with the results of that attack on well I agree with you Mr. Pepper you've you've
[1:31:55.880 --> 1:32:01.080]  had a long incredible life seen so many things but do you ever feel like you're
[1:32:01.080 --> 1:32:03.760]  in a dream I mean I know you've seen a lot of things that are like that but to
[1:32:03.760 --> 1:32:09.600]  me it's like this is so bizarre so obvious it's even more ham-fisted than
[1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:14.400]  than Hitler's invasions in Europe it just it seems like a bad dream do you ever
[1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:21.560]  feel bewildered well I feel tremendously distressed by the fact that the most
[1:32:21.560 --> 1:32:27.520]  powerful forces in the in the country really are the mainstream media corporate
[1:32:27.520 --> 1:32:33.880]  media because they just can continually hide and and dumb down the American
[1:32:33.880 --> 1:32:39.040]  public and then and distort and and influence it influence their their
[1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:46.000]  mindset to the extent that they do it's there are enormously facilitating the
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:50.320]  demise of this republic in the end of democracy in the Republic that there is
[1:32:50.320 --> 1:32:58.720]  just no serious mainstream criticism at all that that one can look at so in your
[1:32:58.720 --> 1:33:02.720]  view we are definitely entering a long dark night let me let me get your take
[1:33:02.720 --> 1:33:05.840]  on that right now here we go
[1:33:05.840 --> 1:33:12.120]  we're gonna get back into the murder of MLK and big new developments there RFK
[1:33:12.120 --> 1:33:16.480]  JFK briefly in the 25 minutes we have left our guest but but I do want to
[1:33:16.480 --> 1:33:20.360]  briefly digress and we were just talking behind the scenes for internet
[1:33:20.360 --> 1:33:24.320]  listeners and viewers for the full radio audience we're talking about are
[1:33:24.320 --> 1:33:27.560]  they gonna go into Iran and he was saying well it it looks like they're
[1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:30.800]  leaning towards that and he mentioned Cy Hirsh and others with sources our
[1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:35.200]  sources in Congress say the same thing Ron Paul who isn't one to shoot his
[1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:38.560]  mouth off said last week before the house that we're basically going to go
[1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:41.680]  into martial law and total tyranny because that's all the preparations he
[1:33:41.680 --> 1:33:46.200]  sees he says colleagues walk around giggling and talking about nuking Iran
[1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:52.360]  like children a mass mental illness kind of one of those Bible verses about you
[1:33:52.360 --> 1:33:58.800]  know giving over to craziness mass lunacy has now taken us in and he was
[1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:04.800]  getting into that finishing up do you see any way of changing this and going
[1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:10.920]  into this long dark night that's going to make the 60s look like a tea party I'm
[1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:17.120]  afraid at this point in time short of a very serious or a mass uprising and
[1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:23.520]  awareness I don't remember a BR was given this contract 385 billion dollars
[1:34:23.520 --> 1:34:32.440]  over a year February ago to to build effectively a concentration camp like
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:36.600]  facilities in every state of the union and to refurbish some existing
[1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:42.640]  facilities so they could be used the the excuse was that they needed these
[1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:47.680]  places for illegal immigrants which is absolute nonsense and when you talk about
[1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:51.600]  putting them up in Maine and Vermont places like that we're talking about
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:55.720]  illegal immigrants Rex 84 in the 80s the original plan by Oliver North and
[1:34:55.720 --> 1:34:59.400]  point excerpt as you know serving a scholar said they would use it as a
[1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:03.800]  cover saying it was for foreigners but it was really for dissidents yeah I
[1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:07.760]  think there's no question about that and there they are anticipating at some
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:12.000]  point around up which is and an excuse for the declaration of martial law I
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:16.880]  think all of the seeds have been found to for martial law in this country
[1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:22.440]  effectively surreptitiously of course the there's no barrier now the
[1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:27.000]  virtually any doing anything that they want to do and that that of that is the
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:31.080]  problem there there is dissent there are some independent jurists to some
[1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:34.680]  independent courts I think they're going to run rough shot over them they just
[1:35:34.680 --> 1:35:41.520]  need an excuse to declare martial law and I and you know the the an attack on
[1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:47.880]  Iran or or some type of a full-flag operation here in the United States would
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:52.800]  give them that excuse so I think we may not be we may not be terribly far away
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:57.240]  from that if they don't need to go to that extreme if they could continue to
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:36:02.360]  dumb down the population and to and to minimize any kind of effective dissent
[1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:06.240]  they're going to do that of course so just continue the reason I think they're
[1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:10.880]  going to go with it though what's making it more and more difficult Alex is that
[1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:17.120]  is the decline of the economy because there's no doubt now it we're heading
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:20.200]  back toward nineteen twenty that's what I was about to say that's going to push
[1:36:20.200 --> 1:36:24.720]  him and you just next point you just made it so so you are you saying you see
[1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:29.920]  this as an accelerant towards martial law the the economy imploding go ahead
[1:36:29.920 --> 1:36:37.520]  yes I I think increasingly as the middle class people become alienated as they
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:40.720]  did during the Vietnam War by the way when that when their children were
[1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:46.720]  being drafted now the alienation is not a draft but it's going to be a loss of
[1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:52.720]  jobs unemployment inability to feed their families shortage of basic of goods
[1:36:52.720 --> 1:36:55.920]  that they need I'll tell you what else is scary I'll tell you what else is scary
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:00.800]  they're taking all masses of the Austin police to Israel to train them in
[1:37:00.800 --> 1:37:05.440]  antique terror and literally how to control the US that means the people
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:08.960]  and they're taking every other major city department over there for
[1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:12.880]  brainwashing I mean I've been on their own battle plans basically turning
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:17.880]  America into fenced-in cities and checkpoints where all slaves yeah I
[1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:23.200]  think I think that the signs are there that the preparations are being are
[1:37:23.200 --> 1:37:29.680]  being raised for the purpose of a of taking those steps if they have to take
[1:37:29.680 --> 1:37:35.680]  them he brought in the Orlando air now air reserve into Washington who should
[1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:38.360]  brought them in nationalize the brought them into Washington
[1:37:38.360 --> 1:37:46.000]  several months ago now and they did it very quietly but in anticipation of
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:50.920]  serious unrest in the capital arising and having enough forces they didn't have
[1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:56.480]  enough forces to put down what they anticipated Martin was going to do in
[1:37:56.480 --> 1:38:02.720]  in May June of 68 in Washington with the the encampment so they were never
[1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:06.680]  going to be able to let that that they could never leave Memphis they have
[1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:11.240]  also they've also announced everywhere like Chicago that oh we're going to use
[1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:15.680]  National Guard now to fight crime not just terrorism so we're really seeing
[1:38:15.680 --> 1:38:20.800]  them flip the switches and turn on martial law already yes that's right I
[1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:25.320]  think I think that's right policy combat us the the prohibition of using
[1:38:25.320 --> 1:38:31.000]  military forces first for civil disorder and civil purposes is gone it's
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:34.520]  effectively been wiped out so they have the tyranny system idling and now
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:38.440]  they're starting that the juggernaut rolling I do with Congress with a nine
[1:38:38.440 --> 1:38:41.640]  of nine percent approval rating and seventy plus percent of the troops
[1:38:41.640 --> 1:38:46.280]  against the war and what I see I don't see it being a popular martial law like
[1:38:46.280 --> 1:38:51.160]  with Hitler I don't see it going well for them I think it may collapse like the
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:55.280]  Soviet Union and do you agree that's the best we can hope for well it's it is
[1:38:55.280 --> 1:39:00.120]  probably the best we can hope for I mean you know they spent a trillion dollars
[1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:05.440]  on Iraq Obama's talking about beefing up Afghanistan he threw Briginski off his
[1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:10.080]  foreign policy team as you may know now whatever one thinks of Briginski the
[1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:14.120]  guy is nevertheless a hard-headed pragmatist which ever side he thought
[1:39:14.120 --> 1:39:19.360]  he he is a practice and he's been saying de-escalate and he's saying do not make
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:24.400]  the so the same mistake that the Soviets made do not do that in Afghanistan
[1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:29.640]  Obama he threw him off the team he's talking about about beefing up the
[1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:34.360]  troops in Afghanistan that's never going to be solved militarily who that is
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:37.840]  not learned that lesson well that just gives the afghans more targets to shoot
[1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:43.400]  oh there's no question about that it's a very the very very foolish move we're
[1:39:43.400 --> 1:39:47.240]  going for one to another and then if you're saddled with Iraq as well and a
[1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:51.160]  declining economy with the economy going into the toilet
[1:39:51.160 --> 1:39:58.560]  this place is going to be on fire the dollar in in freefall but the dollar is
[1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:03.920]  a serious serious trouble and it's going to get work and think about the price of
[1:40:03.920 --> 1:40:08.680]  oil if they attack Iran well think about Mr. Pepper here's the thing every
[1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:13.160]  analyst liberal conservative mainline father of Reaganomics Joseph Stiklitz
[1:40:13.160 --> 1:40:16.680]  Nobel Prize winner yourself you all say the exact same thing because there's no
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:20.000]  other way to analyze this than I and then I have some of the troops sending me
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:24.200]  threatening emails with their myspace handles in uniform not the majority
[1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:27.880]  saying yeah we're going to kill you too and they're laughing and think it's funny
[1:40:27.880 --> 1:40:31.520]  and cute don't they know it's going to ruin their mothers and fathers pensions
[1:40:31.520 --> 1:40:35.560]  and our whole don't they know that that they're going to get the that this whole
[1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:39.640]  corporate global system isn't their friend either don't they understand that
[1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:43.160]  that they're not going to get a cakewalk that they're bringing destruction
[1:40:43.160 --> 1:40:48.000]  down on themselves or are they just so unknowledgeable about common sense in
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:52.560]  history that they have no idea they are unknowledgeable and they're continuing to
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:58.480]  be dumped down they're continuing to be fed the propaganda and and that that's
[1:40:58.480 --> 1:41:03.320]  the great crime of the corporate media this country which is simply silent it
[1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:08.760]  does not it does not inform the people at this informs them continually I mean
[1:41:08.760 --> 1:41:13.120]  that that's what faces us the only thing we could do people like you Alex and
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:18.800]  with your outreach have got to try to make people aware of these things but
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:23.880]  more than making them aware I've got to encourage them to organize and he would
[1:41:23.880 --> 1:41:27.960]  be it's not a we used to have a bottle with said don't mourn organize you've
[1:41:27.960 --> 1:41:32.840]  simply if you love this republic and you want to preserve it or any semblance of
[1:41:32.840 --> 1:41:37.400]  it you simply have to organize and you start organizing at the local level and
[1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:42.480]  and just spread the groups as much as possible well I agree and and folks you're
[1:41:42.480 --> 1:41:45.720]  talking to a man who's lived it and done it it was on the phone William Pepper I
[1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:49.960]  have seen quite a bit but nothing like he has don't wait till the martial laws
[1:41:49.960 --> 1:41:53.080]  in and they shut the main web off they're already set internet to up and
[1:41:53.080 --> 1:41:56.080]  said they're getting ready to shut down access to 95% of the web that's
[1:41:56.080 --> 1:42:00.760]  announced mainstream news don't wait until the troops in the mercenaries and
[1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:04.880]  the end I mean when Bush is hiring tens of thousands of aggravated felons for
[1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:11.200]  the military I mean William this is getting again Twilight Zone I keep
[1:42:11.200 --> 1:42:15.000]  imagining that you'll keep keep thinking that Rod Serling's gonna walk out in
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:19.520]  front of things and tell me it was all a Twilight Zone episode yeah it feels
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:23.280]  unreal doesn't it it does well we've only got about 18 minutes left and I and
[1:42:23.280 --> 1:42:27.240]  just in a nutshell what they did to Martin what you discovered and your
[1:42:27.240 --> 1:42:31.480]  book of the you know the all the Bobby stuff coming out I mean it's open and
[1:42:31.480 --> 1:42:35.960]  shut isn't it yeah I don't think there's any question about that if we can move
[1:42:35.960 --> 1:42:40.880]  on with the the the king cases basically been solved there are a few loose
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:46.760]  pieces that I'm I'm taking care of but it's basically done Bob Kennedy the
[1:42:46.760 --> 1:42:52.560]  Kennedy case is actually easier I I was asked by Sirhan a long time ago to
[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:59.160]  get involved and refused I because I you know what happens when you get I was
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:02.000]  working on the king case and now I would jump into that and they would say
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:07.400]  well here he is this conspiracy nutter and it wouldn't then it was just not the
[1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:12.560]  thing to do finally we basically finished and we the King family was
[1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:16.680]  satisfied because they really understood finally how Martin was killed and why he
[1:43:16.680 --> 1:43:22.480]  was killed they gave me the some of the new information the new evidence on the
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:28.520]  assassination of Bob Kennedy and it was it's overwhelming it's black and white
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:33.680]  there is just no question that Sirhan did not kill him and could not have
[1:43:33.680 --> 1:43:39.160]  killed him and so I've taken that case on full score now and we're we're we're
[1:43:39.160 --> 1:43:45.440]  going to press forward and using similar tactics I used in the king case
[1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:50.520]  eventually we're going to be able to put under oath all of the evidence that
[1:43:50.520 --> 1:43:55.760]  will show that Bob Kennedy was was not killed by Sirhan he probably shot from
[1:43:55.760 --> 1:44:00.280]  behind bullet went into the right the right side of his head by the right
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:05.000]  ear the bullet the gun according to the autopsy report was about an inch to two
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:09.720]  inches from the back of his head there were three there were three shots that
[1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:14.200]  hit his body they were all from behind and they were all at very close range
[1:44:14.200 --> 1:44:19.080]  and a fourth shot went through his shoulder pad Sirhan was in front of
[1:44:19.080 --> 1:44:24.160]  Kennedy never closer than three to five feet in the front of him he was he
[1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:29.360]  started shooting the first shot appears to have been simply a blank cartridge
[1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:34.280]  that flared up and distracted everybody and then he got a second shot off and
[1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:39.000]  then his arm was pinned to the table and he kept pulling the trigger and bullets
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:43.400]  went went all over the pantry but while all that distraction was going on Bob
[1:44:43.400 --> 1:44:49.520]  was hit from the assassin hit him from behind and it's quite clear that the
[1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:53.880]  that Sirhan didn't do it it's also quite clear that he hasn't got any recollection
[1:44:53.880 --> 1:44:59.360]  of what happened that he was hit the program then this has been now analyzed
[1:44:59.360 --> 1:45:04.440]  by a number of people including a psychologist who spent over 20 visits
[1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:10.680]  with him when he was in San Quentin so we've got a task ahead of us to look
[1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:14.560]  at the whole psychological aspect of this and they the hip no programming that
[1:45:14.560 --> 1:45:20.360]  well that we strongly believe was the was done to this guy to set him up at the
[1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:25.600]  way that he was set up so that's that process is now in motion we're gonna
[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:30.440]  we're going to be persistent we're gonna persevere and we're going to get this
[1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:36.200]  evidence out finally we've just had the benefit of acoustical evidence that has
[1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:42.520]  been revealed and confirms what we have from other other aspects evidence
[1:45:42.520 --> 1:45:48.240]  earlier very clearly indicating that 13 shots were fired but that two weapons
[1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:52.520]  were used because there's a acoustical difference between the sound of of the
[1:45:52.520 --> 1:45:58.560]  of the discharge and it's a remarkable because Sirhan's gun of course only had
[1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:02.920]  eight bullets in it that the you know the number of shots that actually were
[1:46:02.920 --> 1:46:08.280]  fired indicating quite clearly a second gun and and another assassin so all of
[1:46:08.280 --> 1:46:13.440]  that is and it's a scientifically indisputable it'll you know and one of
[1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:17.160]  the guys involved over the former president of the the association of
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:23.520]  forensic scientists in America Robert Joling so I think and Phil von Prague is
[1:46:23.520 --> 1:46:28.000]  the guy who did the acoustical work I think we're gonna go forward with with
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:31.880]  the Bob Kennedy case and eventually we'll reveal that he was assassinated
[1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:38.120]  and by forces other than a lone gunman once again and we're probably we're
[1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:42.520]  going to going to see the same people at work in this assassination the same
[1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:48.080]  forces that work in this assassination determined not to let Bob Kennedy
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:51.360]  become president what do you think of the news footage of BBC has gotten where
[1:46:51.360 --> 1:46:57.560]  it shows three known CIA guys all spinning images dancing around right
[1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:01.200]  before he's killed out there and you can watch the body language directing
[1:47:01.200 --> 1:47:06.280]  people to looking like that they're on a rabbit hunt or something very obvious
[1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:13.000]  well I know Shane O'Sullivan quite well and and Shane did that piece and he's
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:20.320]  he's also written a very detailed book his a lot of his information is very
[1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:25.880]  very good and solid I think I got to look much more closely at that at that
[1:47:25.880 --> 1:47:30.320]  aspect of it because I think some some doubt has been has been thrown up with
[1:47:30.320 --> 1:47:34.560]  respect to some of the identities but I think but when we're talking about the
[1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:38.760]  acoustics when you have the head of the National Acoustics you know Forensics
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:43.280]  Association and others this is open and shut yeah I think that that's right I
[1:47:43.280 --> 1:47:47.000]  don't think there's any question about that but we're going to have to go through
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:52.120]  Alex the bureaucracy of the judicial system in the state of California which
[1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:56.200]  is going to try to block us on the technicalities they're never going to
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:48:00.880]  deal with the merits of this case they're going to try to stop us on the
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:07.120]  basis of timeliness statute of limitations issues you know the usual
[1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:13.040]  kind of technical opposition that when you don't want to anything to come
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:18.240]  forward on the merits you you put all these of these technical issues up in
[1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:22.920]  front to try to get the case dismissed and unfortunately a number of the
[1:48:22.920 --> 1:48:27.600]  members of the bench out there were prosecutors in that office at the time
[1:48:27.600 --> 1:48:31.600]  well as you said we have the coroner one of the top in the country saying he was
[1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:35.040]  shot repeatedly in the back in the back of the head so we know that's a lie
[1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:40.920]  well we know the guy that mr. Caesar was a known spook behind him you know it's
[1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:45.720]  important people say this is 30 years ago 40 years ago 45 years ago people are
[1:48:45.720 --> 1:48:50.480]  saying why does this stuff matter it matters because the same even as
[1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:53.800]  Bruce Willis finally woke up seeing some of my films and Rick Linklater gave him
[1:48:53.800 --> 1:48:56.960]  to him a few years ago he said oh my god the people that killed Kennedy are in
[1:48:56.960 --> 1:49:00.600]  control now even said that then in Vanity Fair after we broke it before he went
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:06.040]  public so I mean even if somebody like Bruce Willis can wake up the general
[1:49:06.040 --> 1:49:09.600]  public should be able to wake up but but you've been around a lot of these
[1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:12.920]  elitists a lot of these big power brokers in your life and talk to folks
[1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:17.000]  that have also been around them what is the mindset of the type of people that
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:20.600]  will stage terror attacks in the US to blame it on enemies and launch wars who
[1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:25.240]  will kill presidents who will kill people running for president I mean what is
[1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:29.440]  their mindset what I mean obviously it's money in power and control but but but
[1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:33.760]  what really drives them at the end of the day I think at the end of the day
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:38.720]  they're they are they are driven by the things you mentioned they're driven by
[1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:43.240]  money and they're driven by power that they are in many ways the agents of the
[1:49:43.240 --> 1:49:49.240]  of the of a corporate industrial military complex that that dominates
[1:49:49.240 --> 1:49:54.080]  public and increasingly private life in this country and they get rewarded when
[1:49:54.080 --> 1:50:00.080]  they when they perform in a compatible way as public servants they they often
[1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:04.280]  end up with the boards of directors of many of these of these situations you
[1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:09.080]  know I mean former head of American Express indicated that 5,000 people run
[1:50:09.080 --> 1:50:15.760]  this republic and he said you know they meet they meet at the place called the
[1:50:15.760 --> 1:50:19.800]  bohemian their representatives needed a place called the bohemian Grove and they
[1:50:19.800 --> 1:50:25.080]  usually title up there about once a year and they make the critical decisions
[1:50:25.080 --> 1:50:29.280]  are made up at the bohemian grove by the representatives of these people yeah
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:33.800]  that's a superclass we interviewed him and I've snuck into bohemian grove it's
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:36.880]  going on right now stay there we're gonna talk behind the scenes with mr. pepper
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:41.000]  about the superclass they run it they can care less about you they're turning
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:44.160]  the country into a prison for you so they can carry out their criminal
[1:50:44.160 --> 1:50:50.000]  activities untouched stay with us William Pepper's our guest
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:59.400]  a bot William please continue sir with you were getting into the superclass and
[1:50:59.400 --> 1:51:06.480]  how they meet and what they do yeah well I think they basically dominate they
[1:51:06.480 --> 1:51:12.720]  dominate public life and in this country and and every every aspect of it and
[1:51:12.720 --> 1:51:18.680]  every major corporation financial institution is is dominated by them you
[1:51:18.680 --> 1:51:24.080]  know when when Jack Kennedy came into power there had been developed before he
[1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:37.320]  came in a plan to for the invasion of Cuba and that plan was the was a false
[1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:42.360]  flag operation that was to involve alleged Cubans and committing terrorist
[1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:49.240]  acts on American soil to justify the invasion of Cuba well that plan was put
[1:51:49.240 --> 1:51:55.240]  on Kennedy's desk he said oh my god these guys are nuts the name of that plan
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:52:01.200]  was called Northwood and it's not well known it's been it's the people of people
[1:52:01.200 --> 1:52:03.600]  have written let me stop you and just interject a question I want you to get
[1:52:03.600 --> 1:52:07.640]  into Northwood's mr. pepper I saw one little frontline blur before it was
[1:52:07.640 --> 1:52:11.960]  even declassified about him being upset about invasion plans that had
[1:52:11.960 --> 1:52:17.640]  provocations then years later in 2000 Northwood's ABC Baltimore Sun as you
[1:52:17.640 --> 1:52:21.640]  know come out with it but it looks from history and you know more about the
[1:52:21.640 --> 1:52:25.080]  night that Kennedy was kind of a hawk and believed in mom and apple pie and kind
[1:52:25.080 --> 1:52:29.440]  of naive in a way you know super patriot PT boat in the whole nine yards and
[1:52:29.440 --> 1:52:33.880]  that now I've had others like yourself say that when when they brought in this
[1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:37.080]  plan to stage terror attacks to him that's when he said I'm tearing up the
[1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:42.800]  CIA we're getting out of Vietnam and you guys are fired well he he he was he was
[1:52:42.800 --> 1:52:46.920]  very naive you know Jack Kennedy many ways was an adolescent right straight
[1:52:46.920 --> 1:52:52.800]  into the presidency he was bright he was well intentioned but he was naive and
[1:52:52.800 --> 1:52:57.800]  he couldn't he couldn't believe that some of these things are there that were
[1:52:57.800 --> 1:53:03.040]  being proposed to him and of course the Bay of Pigs which he eventually was
[1:53:03.040 --> 1:53:08.080]  saddled with and and had misgivings about but nevertheless let go forward to a
[1:53:08.080 --> 1:53:13.360]  point which taught him a great lesson and that's when he he fired dollars from
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:18.160]  the CIA but the interesting Alex about the Northwood's plan was that was one
[1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:24.080]  of the first I think confrontation that that he had with Lemnitzer who was the
[1:53:24.080 --> 1:53:30.920]  admiral who drew it up and what I learned fairly recently is that we you know
[1:53:30.920 --> 1:53:35.160]  that the name of the golf course where the where the chaps at the Bohemian
[1:53:35.160 --> 1:53:39.040]  Grove play it's a nine-hole golf course they go of course they all play there
[1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:44.680]  Northwood's those who play it is called Northwood and they bragged that they
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:49.280]  cooked up the Manhattan Project Star Wars all of it at the Grove at the
[1:53:49.280 --> 1:53:53.680]  chalet which are hidden cameras have infiltrated and that right oh yeah I'll
[1:53:53.680 --> 1:53:57.680]  to send you my my film I'll actually made two films on that we're going back to
[1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:07.440]  the main audience right now right you can spend 50 hours of William Pepper just
[1:54:07.440 --> 1:54:11.960]  yes knowledge about every facet if I guess knowledge about all the things we
[1:54:11.960 --> 1:54:15.440]  cover here then they'll always have a little more for you and he was just
[1:54:15.440 --> 1:54:18.360]  pointing out that operation Northwood's at the same name is where they hatch all
[1:54:18.360 --> 1:54:21.800]  this stuff the golf course outside Bohemian Grove where they pick up their
[1:54:21.800 --> 1:54:25.200]  male and female prostitutes as well and I've been there and seen it with my own
[1:54:25.200 --> 1:54:29.520]  two eyeballs it's in the order of death and my second film about Bohemian
[1:54:29.520 --> 1:54:33.000]  Grove and they put the guy in prison who snuck in to get that footage for us I
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:37.640]  snuck in and only gotten death threats in 2000 they just arrested the editor of
[1:54:37.640 --> 1:54:42.760]  Vanity Fair tried to infiltrate no doubt they had moles inside Vanity Fair that
[1:54:42.760 --> 1:54:47.280]  see the forces with us folks that's why we're able to do this and I think God
[1:54:47.280 --> 1:54:51.760]  every day I'm still alive the force is not with most these other people sir in
[1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:55.480]  closing to talk about your book we got five minutes anything else you want to
[1:54:55.480 --> 1:54:58.440]  add mr. Pepper and then I want to get you back on in the near future to talk
[1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:02.920]  about some of your other amazing experiences well I mean active state is
[1:55:02.920 --> 1:55:09.600]  out of the paper back I am representing Sirhan we're going to
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:13.360]  we're pushing forward with that I've also agreed to represent some victims of
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:20.240]  9-11 in another lawsuit that I'm developing that is very sensitive
[1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:23.840]  lawsuit because it relates to the whole funding the background and funding of
[1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:28.560]  of 9-11 so that's going forward these things unfortunately Alex cost a great
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:34.280]  deal of money and I'm having to try to earn funds out of you by out of regular
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:38.480]  legal corporate other than international legal work that I do to try to pay for it
[1:55:38.480 --> 1:55:44.720]  also it's not a very it's not very easy to do that the main book that I have
[1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:49.320]  virtually completed that was a book on who go where she has free as the
[1:55:49.320 --> 1:55:53.520]  president of Venezuela who has been of course the thought of the side of the
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:58.800]  American oh I meant to get into that with you last time you were on we've got to
[1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:02.840]  sit you up to come on and talk about you know him well the real Hugo Chavez
[1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:06.720]  because that is you know obviously so important to what's happening geopolitically
[1:56:06.720 --> 1:56:11.280]  and that leads me to my final question for you do you get death threats and
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:14.760]  people ask well why is William Pepper so alive if he's done all of this I would
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:17.680]  venture to say they don't want to make you a martyr they don't want to put an
[1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:21.360]  exclamation point behind everything you've said and done they don't want to
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:25.440]  highlight the work because you've already done your body of work and continue to do
[1:56:25.440 --> 1:56:31.560]  it it won't help them to kill you I mean is that correct that's right I think
[1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:37.960]  that's right I think they should have hit me early on in the King work and that
[1:56:37.960 --> 1:56:41.640]  no one would probably have noticed and I would have that would have been the end
[1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:47.880]  of it but when the King family got in got involved and they they they became
[1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:52.920]  really a part of the work that I was doing and in support of it then it
[1:56:52.920 --> 1:56:58.480]  became very difficult for them at that point in time and and and since then I
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:04.000]  think they believe if they can just shut things down whether it's a 9-11 work
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  that I've I've encouraged or or my support of Chavez back and forth with
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:14.400]  it as well and oh and and the third hand case if they could shut them down and
[1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:18.080]  use any other means they try to do that rather than rather than kill the
[1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:21.440]  answer question yes of their death threats all the time but they're not I
[1:57:21.440 --> 1:57:26.760]  don't take them as being being serious I think in many ways if they could let
[1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:33.000]  people like me and people like you go about to the business of dissent in a
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:38.920]  controlled way so that the you're not really impacting it creates the illusion
[1:57:38.920 --> 1:57:43.120]  of liberty and then they say oh see we thought they're just nuts that's exactly
[1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:47.600]  what they say exactly what it is it's only when you start to get very close
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:52.040]  to the bone the way Martin King and Bob Kennedy were getting power that that they
[1:57:52.040 --> 1:57:56.320]  take you out they were trying to get control through the electoral process
[1:57:56.320 --> 1:58:00.600]  of the main executive mechanism yes that's right they were approaching the
[1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:04.920]  levers of control that's right and that's where they took them out whereas
[1:58:04.920 --> 1:58:09.560]  we're just down here trying to wake up the sheep who are happily chewing their

[2:00:40.520 --> 2:00:46.920]  exposed the murder assassination of Bobby Kennedy Martin Luther King and of
[2:00:46.920 --> 2:00:50.400]  course 9-11 being an inside job and we've got about three more minutes we're
[2:00:50.400 --> 2:00:55.600]  getting back up in the next few weeks to get more into actually prosecuting the
[2:00:55.600 --> 2:01:00.080]  criminals we're trying to do that through the Congress he was bringing up some
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:04.400]  other way to do it very dangerous work he's involved in Ron Paul's plane just
[2:01:04.400 --> 2:01:09.000]  depressurized yesterday night very dangerous a good chance it was an
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:12.360]  attempted assassination there were seven congressmen on board we'll talk about
[2:01:12.360 --> 2:01:17.120]  that with Mark Kornke coming up folks we're in the danger zone right now make
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:20.720]  no mistake but going back Mr. Pepper we got about three and a half minutes
[2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:26.260]  finishing up your statements okay well we can we could discuss the whole
[2:01:26.260 --> 2:01:30.600]  Chavez phenomenon and his that movement the Bolivarian movement at length
[2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:36.200]  another time that takes a lot more time the prosecution of the war criminals in
[2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:40.760]  in Washington I think is essential events bugliozzi of course has come out
[2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:45.000]  with a book now the advocating the prosecution of George Bush for murder
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:50.680]  and he builds a case for a a murder prosecution inside the United States
[2:01:50.680 --> 2:01:55.880]  based upon the fact that if over 4,000 soldiers have died on the basis on false
[2:01:55.880 --> 2:01:59.800]  pretenses and lies and were sent to their deaths and so he's talked about a
[2:01:59.800 --> 2:02:04.640]  domestic prosecution I'm at then and certainly that should go forward my
[2:02:04.640 --> 2:02:09.140]  interest would be more in in a in a prosecution on international criminal
[2:02:09.140 --> 2:02:13.160]  law with respect to the number one crime they were the war of aggression
[2:02:13.160 --> 2:02:17.440]  secondly crimes against humanity and the book and contravention of the torture
[2:02:17.440 --> 2:02:22.000]  as statutes and they end the torture convention that's all feasible it
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:26.640]  involves more than bush it involves about 15 to 20 people in that
[2:02:26.640 --> 2:02:31.600]  administration all of whom play a role and there is a research team now both
[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:36.680]  in in England at Oxford where I've been involved in and over here that are that
[2:02:36.680 --> 2:02:42.400]  are developing a bill of indictment for that purpose now it's it may be futile
[2:02:42.400 --> 2:02:51.000]  to to to submit that to the attorney new attorney general next year because that
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:53.880]  will probably that prosecution will probably never happen in the United
[2:02:53.880 --> 2:02:58.600]  States but that has to be done procedurally before any foreign
[2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:03.000]  prosecution can commence and that's what I think will probably happen that there
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:08.200]  will be foreign prosecutions of these people eventually well I believe the
[2:03:08.200 --> 2:03:11.800]  prosecution should be done right here in the Republic but if it's totally
[2:03:11.800 --> 2:03:15.800]  controlled and the Congress is cowed through threats intimidation and
[2:03:15.800 --> 2:03:21.920]  collusion I think to internationally display the crimes to then trigger
[2:03:21.920 --> 2:03:27.200]  prosecution here is the avenue to go plus the international order is so
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:30.000]  corrupted by the very same corporate interest in the UN crimes are covered up
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:34.600]  but I do agree any avenue to stall World War three and to hamstring the New
[2:03:34.600 --> 2:03:38.080]  World Order and kind of use its own mechanisms against itself is a good
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:44.920]  thing again let me tell you Alex I know a few foreign judges magistrates and

[2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:24.280]  make no mistake my friends they've killed a lot of us they falsely imprisoned
[2:08:24.280 --> 2:08:30.960]  more of us like Mark Kornke seven years behind the wire for doing nothing
[2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:38.480]  but being run off the road by police trying to get his sons out of the car
[2:08:38.480 --> 2:08:45.720]  so they couldn't kill them as they'd sworn to do
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:56.480]  further on the edge ladies and gentlemen the greater the intensity I
[2:08:56.480 --> 2:09:01.880]  think you just heard the birth earlier of you know big farm aid isn't really
[2:09:01.880 --> 2:09:06.200]  announced and he just said in and around farm aid he will do a huge concert for
[2:09:06.200 --> 2:09:12.920]  9-11 truth that is definitely punching into overdrive that will get a lot of
[2:09:12.920 --> 2:09:20.920]  attention you can laugh at this cheesy 80 song but it says it all you don't know
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:24.800]  what you can do until you go ahead and go out on the edge and those who haven't
[2:09:24.800 --> 2:09:30.080]  been out on the edge don't know what the edge is but to all of you who stood up
[2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:33.680]  for liberty and freedom going back thousands of years the only reason we
[2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:38.760]  have any liberty or freedom is because of those men and women I salute you and I
[2:09:38.760 --> 2:09:46.480]  salute those who have the spirit of 1776 in them today who are out there on the
[2:09:46.480 --> 2:10:01.320]  danger zone the rest of this song is for you them I go to mark cornkey
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:35.040]  yeah David Rockefeller doesn't like the danger zone he wants to put us in the
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:39.320]  danger zone we're gonna put him in the danger zone
[2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:47.200]  having a lot of fun here today
[2:10:48.200 --> 2:10:51.800]  alright I'm very excited about what's happening because we are really taking
[2:10:51.800 --> 2:10:54.840]  a lot of enemy fire that means we're having an effect but flight carrying
[2:10:54.840 --> 2:10:59.760]  Ron Paul seven congressmen total continental flight they rarely
[2:10:59.760 --> 2:11:04.280]  depressurize massive total depressurization they had to do an
[2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:07.400]  emergency landing this is one of their favorite ways to kill people don't think
[2:11:07.400 --> 2:11:10.720]  for a minute this is an accident there's been all sorts of threats Ron
[2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:13.800]  Poland before the house last week and said they're getting ready for martial
[2:11:13.800 --> 2:11:17.880]  law in World War three they know he is one of the main leaders they've been
[2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:21.760]  threatening Dennis Kosanich threatening anybody that tries to stand in their way
[2:11:21.760 --> 2:11:26.600]  folks we are going into the danger zone the attack on Iran martial law all of
[2:11:26.600 --> 2:11:29.280]  it that's why we've been having mark corky on each week mark I really
[2:11:29.280 --> 2:11:33.600]  appreciate you coming on well thank you very much Alex and again there are no
[2:11:33.600 --> 2:11:37.520]  accidents technology like that especially you got to remember with level of
[2:11:37.520 --> 2:11:42.960]  redundancy and the work was done my question would be would depressurization
[2:11:42.960 --> 2:11:45.960]  failure the aircraft hey did they scramble two fighters the way they're
[2:11:45.960 --> 2:11:50.680]  supposed to to check on the plane well I'm did they're just reporting it was a
[2:11:50.680 --> 2:11:59.600]  very serious totally pressurization on oxygen mass came down and again it was
[2:11:59.600 --> 2:12:02.680]  one of those things just like the paint stewart where it just suddenly came on
[2:12:02.680 --> 2:12:05.560]  people started getting dizzy and thank God they got a plane down that's one of
[2:12:05.560 --> 2:12:08.880]  their favorite ways they killed some of Bush's pilots a few years ago Bush
[2:12:08.880 --> 2:12:11.760]  senior coming in with a depressurization hitting the light pole
[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:16.000]  they've killed a lot of other people that way I mean this is not a coincidence
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:19.360]  mark there's just no way right an interesting thing the reason I was kind
[2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:23.000]  of being facetious there's remember any other time than the FAA has had an
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:28.320]  incident like this or a transponder failure 600 times a year fighter
[2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:32.920]  aircraft that are owned by the trillion dollar air force of the united states
[2:12:32.920 --> 2:12:38.160]  multi trillion dollar air force go up and inspect or assist in whatever way
[2:12:38.160 --> 2:12:42.400]  they can to observe the aircraft to see if there's injury or damage and to help
[2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:46.840]  the pilots out by being able to instruct them my my curious question is here they
[2:12:46.840 --> 2:12:51.200]  never did that once during 9-11 we know the story there but in a situation like
[2:12:51.200 --> 2:12:57.480]  this it would be policy and precautionary and it was contrary to such when they
[2:12:57.480 --> 2:13:01.720]  didn't say when they failed to launch any aircraft in 9-11 in this situation
[2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:06.240]  this would be normal they'd be standard operating procedure to have a couple of
[2:13:06.240 --> 2:13:10.640]  planes lift off the air and since we're in this war of terrorism and a war of
[2:13:10.640 --> 2:13:14.560]  terror where we now don't care about Osama bin Laden we don't protect the
[2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:18.640]  borders of America we aren't securing the country at all other than searching
[2:13:18.640 --> 2:13:23.720]  grandma cavity searching Graham at the airport for plastic bottles of cosmetics
[2:13:23.720 --> 2:13:29.120]  woohoo that's protecting the country meanwhile are we maintaining this
[2:13:29.120 --> 2:13:32.960]  standard with the air force on standby and ready to go I'd be curious about
[2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:36.400]  that well mark no they didn't launch aircraft at a dancer question about four
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:40.080]  reports are in front of me no five reports here in front of me but this is
[2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:46.600]  what happened Ron Paul was about to really slam the FAA for all sorts of
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:49.960]  payoffs and corruption he'd already been speaking of that he scheduled to be on
[2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:54.840]  tomorrow due to this freak out who knows but they were going to a committee
[2:13:54.840 --> 2:14:01.080]  meeting today dealing with it and he was going to be leading with those other
[2:14:01.080 --> 2:14:07.000]  six congressmen a fight to expose the corruption that is actually in the KHOU
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:12.240]  channel 11 out of Houston TV report I mean he's going to criticize the
[2:14:12.240 --> 2:14:15.440]  airlines and billions of dollars in cheating they're involved in and it's
[2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:20.280]  playing depressurizes my god he my god he better make sure that he stays on
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:24.240]  course and pardon the pun on that but you know what I mean stay on flight stay
[2:14:24.240 --> 2:14:28.400]  on target you're taking flak that means you're hitting the proper target when
[2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:31.760]  you and you know you're over the target when you can feel the plane bucking from
[2:14:31.760 --> 2:14:36.440]  the air defense fire you know what I mean so for everybody out there listening
[2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:41.080]  the best thing we can do right now is to everybody everybody out there listening
[2:14:41.080 --> 2:14:45.520]  no matter where you are we need to give ron call paul's office of support you
[2:14:45.520 --> 2:14:50.560]  know call in one form another send him an email example stay on course ron you
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:54.720]  hit the right target obviously it's time to dump the payload I would call the
[2:14:54.720 --> 2:14:58.880]  white house and tell them that don't do it that's a lot of bad idea well the
[2:14:58.880 --> 2:15:02.360]  other thing I would say is this now and this is something that we had as a
[2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:05.960]  policy we've I've flown millions of miles of course under a dozen the hunt
[2:15:05.960 --> 2:15:10.360]  actually your listeners know because they help to this under virtually
[2:15:10.360 --> 2:15:15.240]  thousands of names okay back in the day and because of this we're able to speak
[2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:19.320]  to millions millions and millions of people and travel to 48 of the 50
[2:15:19.320 --> 2:15:23.840]  states pretty much in with impunity and we got the message out and around but
[2:15:23.840 --> 2:15:26.520]  there's a given point where people said well you can't fly anymore well we
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:31.160]  understood the risk of that but we've continued anyway and progressively there
[2:15:31.160 --> 2:15:34.280]  were more and more restrictions and things of course we're thrown in there
[2:15:34.280 --> 2:15:39.400]  to try and stumble things up but there is a point and I would say this of most
[2:15:39.400 --> 2:15:45.000]  any candidate like Ron Paul where flying is not an option and I would say this of
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:49.200]  many people right now flying is not an option it may take us a little bit
[2:15:49.200 --> 2:15:53.480]  longer and keyword is a little bit longer but for any of our key personnel
[2:15:53.480 --> 2:15:57.000]  anybody out there listening all of you that all of you people that are friends
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:00.760]  or allies of those individuals we're gonna need drivers we're gonna need
[2:16:00.760 --> 2:16:04.320]  security well I had a gut feeling you know Willie doesn't fly anymore he
[2:16:04.320 --> 2:16:10.240]  drives in a bus and I had a bad feeling I I of course I'll be driving to the
[2:16:10.240 --> 2:16:12.760]  Denver convention even though that's gonna take about a day and a half two
[2:16:12.760 --> 2:16:16.200]  days is because I'm in it really especially with these body scanners
[2:16:16.200 --> 2:16:20.160]  with your scanning or neck and body yeah I mean just everything is going to
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:23.320]  hell in a handbasket and I think this was divine intervention because a lot of
[2:16:23.320 --> 2:16:27.680]  times when they have these depressurizations you know shortly after
[2:16:27.680 --> 2:16:32.760]  takeoff it is it is bad and then these are so rare I mean this is just so bad
[2:16:32.760 --> 2:16:36.720]  or it may have just been a warning but I tell you he gives a speech last week
[2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:40.280]  saying they're getting ready to drop the hammer he's going in to expose the FAA
[2:16:40.280 --> 2:16:43.840]  and the airlines and then they depressurize the aircraft I mean this is
[2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:48.040]  getting bad well let's focus again on making sure we give the right support
[2:16:48.040 --> 2:16:51.200]  where it's needed and again everybody out there listening can do a little bit
[2:16:51.200 --> 2:16:56.400]  pick up the phone say hi hopefully everybody's okay and by the way stick
[2:16:56.400 --> 2:16:59.520]  stick to the course we'll help you in any way that we can well we're gonna have
[2:16:59.520 --> 2:17:03.280]  Ron Paul on tomorrow and I guess flooding their lines is fine maybe even
[2:17:03.280 --> 2:17:06.280]  with a political donation or something when we call but you know the main thing
[2:17:06.280 --> 2:17:10.160]  is I think letting the enemy know that that we are fully aware of their
[2:17:10.160 --> 2:17:13.920]  activities a mark do you have any doubt that that this wasn't either a message
[2:17:13.920 --> 2:17:17.040]  or an attempted murder and that and that I think divine intervention was
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:20.240]  involved oh I think more or less it was probably something that was
[2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:25.120]  intentionally engineered I mean number one the problem is we've always argued
[2:17:25.120 --> 2:17:29.320]  this is why aircraft are dangerous is because like the Kennedy young Kennedy
[2:17:29.320 --> 2:17:34.200]  when he was assassinated in his personal aircraft the pilot is not watching the
[2:17:34.200 --> 2:17:39.160]  plane 24 hours a day the crew and the pilot may have no clue what's going to
[2:17:39.160 --> 2:17:43.600]  happen on the other hand in some cases the pilots are even flat out told well
[2:17:43.600 --> 2:17:48.400]  either cooperate with this situation or you know it's the old mafia routine now
[2:17:48.400 --> 2:17:52.880]  they did this when they got rid of Terejos in the Panama the pilot was
[2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:56.960]  basically told I mean this is one of the rules in Central America either you
[2:17:56.960 --> 2:18:01.200]  know go down with the plane or they wipe out their family the cat the dog and
[2:18:01.200 --> 2:18:04.360]  everybody else what they do is they send you photos of your children playing in
[2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:08.040]  the backyard and they say I'm gonna rape this one for weeks before I slit their
[2:18:08.040 --> 2:18:10.880]  throat and they and I've had them threaten my children I know they
[2:18:10.880 --> 2:18:13.880]  threaten your children and you know what we're just committed you bastard
[2:18:13.880 --> 2:18:18.560]  scumbags we know you're murdering trash you're gonna be defeated and we're gonna
[2:18:18.560 --> 2:18:21.760]  hunt them down and do too well let's put this way we're not going to lower
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:24.360]  ourselves to their standard but we're going to do to them what needs to be
[2:18:24.360 --> 2:18:30.360]  done to properly incarcerate to try and to bring to light this is the one thing
[2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:33.160]  they're terrified of is they've always thought they've always they operate
[2:18:33.160 --> 2:18:36.840]  complete shadows they don't we're going to switch all the lights on and the
[2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:41.000]  cockroaches will have no place to run that's what they're terrified of we
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:45.960]  must look at them and then tell them that we see them for what they are that's
[2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:48.920]  the most critical aspect of everything we're doing right now look at them and
[2:18:48.920 --> 2:18:53.200]  just they quail they shudder they are terrified when you don't look at them
[2:18:53.200 --> 2:18:56.880]  with fear but you look at them with disgust because you know what they've
[2:18:56.880 --> 2:19:00.640]  done and who they are I've done this to politicians at events and they get they
[2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:04.520]  start freaking out sweating because they're cowards they love murdering
[2:19:04.520 --> 2:19:10.360]  children bombing women these are literal demons from the crack of hell and
[2:19:10.360 --> 2:19:14.000]  they're not going away until we defeat them that's what people understand they
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:17.200]  don't have a choice do they mark this isn't gonna stop they're not going away
[2:19:17.200 --> 2:19:21.760]  they want a big bloody meal off of us and we just can't let them do it with
[2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:24.920]  minimal cost remember that's all the whole idea remember throw you in the
[2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:28.480]  cattle shoot run you down the shoot give you a mouthful of grain and they'll
[2:19:28.480 --> 2:19:32.520]  made it's pretty good pretty tasty it's wheat num num num hey we're moving
[2:19:32.520 --> 2:19:39.160]  forward hey we're moving forward hey what's the guy with a condom oh too late
[2:19:39.160 --> 2:19:42.360]  that's what they'd like to see happen we're not going to that's why you need
[2:19:42.360 --> 2:19:46.200]  to be organized in the physical world that's why the militia must be in place
[2:19:46.200 --> 2:19:49.600]  it's part of the checks and balances you don't have a choice when they're taking
[2:19:49.600 --> 2:19:52.840]  you to a FEMA camp you don't have a choice we're not looking for war they
[2:19:52.840 --> 2:19:55.920]  take first blood that's it we're going to keep talking behind the scenes right
[2:19:55.920 --> 2:20:01.320]  now mark we just wanted to break please continue mark because I want to see any
[2:20:01.320 --> 2:20:04.400]  you know you got the floor the next 40 minutes anything you want to cover go
[2:20:04.400 --> 2:20:08.080]  ahead and hit it right well the big thing right now is organization at the
[2:20:08.080 --> 2:20:12.080]  tactical level needs to be expanded on dramatically we're a lot of militias are
[2:20:12.080 --> 2:20:16.120]  seeing a massive influx right now for those people that are listening they
[2:20:16.120 --> 2:20:20.240]  know that I'm going to say this I told you so because it's expected it's just a
[2:20:20.240 --> 2:20:24.640]  natural cycle one of the most important things that people can do to accelerate
[2:20:24.640 --> 2:20:28.560]  the process of bringing up the proficiency and the expertise of those
[2:20:28.560 --> 2:20:33.880]  people coming in is standard operating procedure now this means first of all
[2:20:33.880 --> 2:20:37.800]  knowing to train the individual and how to accelerate his or her program
[2:20:37.800 --> 2:20:42.680]  knowing how to organize the five-man fire team knowing how to organize the
[2:20:42.680 --> 2:20:47.280]  squad these are the three basic building blocks of any army I don't care what
[2:20:47.280 --> 2:20:51.720]  part of the planet I don't care how big or small if those three components are
[2:20:51.720 --> 2:20:57.080]  are engineered properly they can be re re juggled around they can be restructured
[2:20:57.080 --> 2:21:01.800]  as needed but the force strength will be in place where it's needed when it's
[2:21:01.800 --> 2:21:06.920]  needed a concept of this goes back even well before we're Korea but it was
[2:21:06.920 --> 2:21:11.280]  called the regimental combat team complex or concept and what they did is
[2:21:11.280 --> 2:21:15.560]  basically we're able to if everything had been trained properly take many
[2:21:15.560 --> 2:21:18.280]  different units reorganize them accordingly put them where they needed
[2:21:18.280 --> 2:21:22.560]  to be bring them back out of the action reorganize and structure them for the
[2:21:22.560 --> 2:21:27.680]  next issue that might need to be dealt with the fire team in the squad plus
[2:21:27.680 --> 2:21:32.560]  the effective training of the individual is what accomplishes this and that's
[2:21:32.560 --> 2:21:36.720]  what the other side is terrified of training is everything repetition so
[2:21:36.720 --> 2:21:40.960]  it becomes second nature doesn't become something I have to think about if
[2:21:40.960 --> 2:21:45.240]  somebody gets hit first aid training is designed so that it takes it takes and
[2:21:45.240 --> 2:21:50.640]  goes into operation immediately weapons per procedure how to use a weapon how
[2:21:50.640 --> 2:21:55.560]  to safely operate the weapon isn't something you think about later it is
[2:21:55.560 --> 2:21:59.800]  drilled in as operational procedure and it means that everybody out there needs
[2:21:59.800 --> 2:22:05.280]  to train they need to train oh and did I mention another word they need to train
[2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:09.560]  that's what the other side is terrified of mark let me throw a caveat here and
[2:22:09.560 --> 2:22:14.280]  what about the general public just having plans of evacuation of need be
[2:22:14.280 --> 2:22:18.400]  where they're gonna go having friends having food having water having the
[2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:23.240]  firearms making sure they're in operation just basic stuff even below you
[2:22:23.240 --> 2:22:27.760]  know militia that is part of the yeah even that is militia preparation they
[2:22:27.760 --> 2:22:30.680]  just don't most people don't realize the m words attached and people need to ask
[2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:35.080]  themselves now what do you do if they got a truck grabbing certain people at
[2:22:35.080 --> 2:22:39.240]  certain houses what is your battle plan obviously try to get away try to not
[2:22:39.240 --> 2:22:43.320]  have a confrontation but do not go to the death camp well I think here's a
[2:22:43.320 --> 2:22:46.560]  here's an old question we asked all through the 90s which is why we held
[2:22:46.560 --> 2:22:49.840]  our ground effectively you know people always ask what are they gonna do when
[2:22:49.840 --> 2:22:53.680]  they come to my door well the question is not that is what are you gonna do when
[2:22:53.680 --> 2:22:58.680]  they come to your neighbor's door first we have to be prepared to work together
[2:22:58.680 --> 2:23:03.480]  and to stand together there the most common mistake made is and of course
[2:23:03.480 --> 2:23:06.600]  now people would say well I don't know my neighbor well maybe you do need to find
[2:23:06.600 --> 2:23:09.040]  out more about your neighbor now if you don't think your neighbor is that
[2:23:09.040 --> 2:23:12.880]  trustworthy but you got a lot of other people you're gonna be evacuating to and
[2:23:12.880 --> 2:23:17.000]  obviously you need to DD the AO as they say get out of the area of operation as
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:22.600]  quickly as possible best still is as the indicators are in place we leave before
[2:23:22.600 --> 2:23:27.280]  it happens we've had we've had a lot of talk about signs because I mean you
[2:23:27.280 --> 2:23:30.960]  will see this you will see the propaganda in the days before preparing
[2:23:30.960 --> 2:23:35.240]  you'll probably see a trigger event well again example we just had down in your
[2:23:35.240 --> 2:23:40.600]  neck of the woods Igor talking about his red brigades oh I'm sorry no I'm not
[2:23:40.600 --> 2:23:46.240]  sorry wait a minute let's write his eco police his spies everywhere you know
[2:23:46.240 --> 2:23:50.000]  they keep reengineering the name but the bottom line is they need this massive
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:53.480]  wall of rodents okay started over started over going back to the main
[2:23:53.480 --> 2:23:59.000]  transmission I'm get back to Al Gore down here with their million man oh 10
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:03.280]  million excuse me the secret police are one million so that's 11 million let's
[2:24:03.280 --> 2:24:07.360]  get into the new brigades let's cover it right now
[2:24:07.840 --> 2:24:12.040]  Mark corn key is our guest you can tell you how to get the most up-to-date
[2:24:12.040 --> 2:24:16.000]  militia manuals training videos preparation most of its free on YouTube
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:20.760]  and Google he's got links to that as well we do not want war ladies and
[2:24:20.760 --> 2:24:25.320]  gentlemen we want peace but we will not go to death camps we will not have
[2:24:25.320 --> 2:24:29.800]  foreign troops and felons rape our families we will defend the Republic 110
[2:24:29.800 --> 2:24:34.200]  percent we are trying every avenue as the founders did to peacefully energize
[2:24:34.200 --> 2:24:38.080]  the public the military and police to join the Republic and realize they have
[2:24:38.080 --> 2:24:42.280]  been overtaken and brainwashed by the New World Order crime syndicate but we
[2:24:42.280 --> 2:24:46.920]  will defend ourselves Mark corn key so interestingly enough we've got Igor
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:50.200]  right down there in your neck of the woods talking about this these new red
[2:24:50.200 --> 2:24:55.640]  brigades the new you know spies the eco freaks the eco police now I'm a I'm a
[2:24:55.640 --> 2:25:00.000]  conservationist and I understand full well preservation of life and I love the
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:03.560]  planet but there's a basic rule here that these characters are just another
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:07.360]  re-engineered version of all the rest of nonsense they keep proposing a
[2:25:07.360 --> 2:25:12.160]  national police force a national spy network rodents everywhere watching over
[2:25:12.160 --> 2:25:16.360]  everybody else real quick for part of your reading assignment find the book
[2:25:16.360 --> 2:25:22.720]  the Fabian freeway the Fabian freeway the we are dealing with Fabian the
[2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:28.880]  socialist the hardcore element of all of socialism they are at Oxford by the way
[2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:33.520]  Oxford was mentioned at the end of the last hour I will point out beware there
[2:25:33.520 --> 2:25:38.000]  because Oxford is the core of Fabian the socialism and their agenda for world
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:42.080]  domination literally world domination they brag about it if you haven't seen
[2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:46.040]  George Orwell standing in front of the 12 the picture of the 12 wise men which
[2:25:46.040 --> 2:25:49.800]  is a stained glass at Oxford and if you don't understand that those are the
[2:25:49.800 --> 2:25:55.000]  critters who were orchestrating global entities such as the League of Nations
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:58.760]  and fabricated World War one mark I totally agree with you and then they
[2:25:58.760 --> 2:26:04.040]  have the false left system as what we run to out of the stage fascist system
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:08.000]  in fairness to pepper though some of the people that go through that system see
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:11.600]  the big picture and don't like it and then turn against it and I think he's
[2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:16.440]  one of them and try to move away but the problem is is the machine itself is to
[2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:22.080]  hopefully through osmosis like sticky sticky with material on a fly trap try to
[2:26:22.080 --> 2:26:25.720]  pull you back in in one form see you don't get too far away and that's the
[2:26:25.720 --> 2:26:29.640]  dangerous part remember yeah you can affect to a degree but most important
[2:26:29.640 --> 2:26:34.560]  is we need to build new and this is true also with regard to even the the
[2:26:34.560 --> 2:26:38.240]  multiple generations within the militia the way they had way it has developed
[2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:43.760]  over the years the militia was here before everything people go oh that's
[2:26:43.760 --> 2:26:48.560]  sacrilege before the marine core before the army before the founding fathers
[2:26:48.560 --> 2:26:53.600]  they are the sons of liberty they are the core they did it all in fact
[2:26:53.600 --> 2:26:59.120]  interestingly enough remember the war didn't start until 1775 the Declaration
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:03.760]  of Independence doesn't come around until 16 months later 1776 we are taught
[2:27:03.760 --> 2:27:10.520]  1776 so we will ignore history the sons of liberty were around in 1760 that's
[2:27:10.520 --> 2:27:13.840]  right they were in fact it was anticipated that the American Revolution
[2:27:13.840 --> 2:27:19.560]  probably start around 1765 based upon the abuses and the train of abuses that
[2:27:19.560 --> 2:27:23.960]  proceeded what took place is because of the money change and a number of other
[2:27:23.960 --> 2:27:28.040]  actions the British were able to stall that off in other words they appease to
[2:27:28.040 --> 2:27:31.960]  a degree and they realized wait a minute where the stones get a little too hot we
[2:27:31.960 --> 2:27:34.760]  don't want them to figure out what's going on we're boiling the frog too fast
[2:27:34.760 --> 2:27:40.080]  so they backed off but then a chain of a brute uses came into play to include the
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:44.760]  occupation and in fact the forced housing and feeding of British troops on
[2:27:44.760 --> 2:27:50.480]  them on colonial soil and American houses this is part of a long progressive
[2:27:50.480 --> 2:27:56.560]  occupation we're seeing a replay of all of it in 1775 the forces then try to
[2:27:56.560 --> 2:28:00.120]  confiscate the arms they come out many times Paul Rear didn't make his ride
[2:28:00.120 --> 2:28:04.520]  once he made his ride at least seven times and you could count actually nine
[2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:08.280]  depending how you look at it in fact they stopped him and wanted to arrest him
[2:28:08.280 --> 2:28:12.680]  and they said you're the guy yeah if that was an April on April 18th through to
[2:28:12.680 --> 2:28:17.280]  April 19th but before that he had made the ride many times and the militia had
[2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:20.960]  mobilized and the British forces had come out of Boston they were forced to
[2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:24.680]  retreat because the militia across the whole of the countryside was active
[2:28:24.680 --> 2:28:29.440]  because the militia was the whole of the people and by the way folks you're not
[2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:34.560]  directed by anyone individual or group it is a basic manifesto of liberty and
[2:28:34.560 --> 2:28:38.600]  freedom and is a code to where you do you this is leaderless resistance it is
[2:28:38.600 --> 2:28:42.720]  unstoppable they're taking women and children to camps you defend them
[2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:46.640]  period everybody everybody pitches in and this is one of the things where we
[2:28:46.640 --> 2:28:50.400]  said what are you doing your neighbors attack well number one if at all possible
[2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:55.000]  you organize you virtually so that you are working together when a foreign
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:29:00.560]  invader and a foreign invader can be the federal forces as skew if if an
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:05.960]  individual if any kind of enforcement agency is acting and it is an obvious
[2:29:05.960 --> 2:29:08.760]  apparent you know it'd be a parent beyond the shadow of a dog in a rogue
[2:29:08.760 --> 2:29:13.240]  fashion in a rogue fashion when they are acting and they are violating when you
[2:29:13.240 --> 2:29:17.720]  see them beating women when you see them shooting people arbitrarily which is
[2:29:17.720 --> 2:29:20.920]  one of the things that you are going to see this isn't going to be a kind of
[2:29:20.920 --> 2:29:24.560]  sort of I'll give you another example here real quick we had all the
[2:29:24.560 --> 2:29:28.880]  information I brought this up in American Pearl 3 I got attacked left and
[2:29:28.880 --> 2:29:33.000]  right for the torture issue we had all the documentation on what they were
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:38.360]  proposing for torture over 13 years ago stay there mark everybody's go to go
[2:29:38.360 --> 2:29:42.160]  to info wars dot com to hear the behind the scenes with mark for body else will
[2:29:42.160 --> 2:29:47.240]  they ride back thank you all for tuning in mark continue with the torture yes
[2:29:47.240 --> 2:29:50.640]  you you covered torture when it was on all their manuals being prepared as a
[2:29:50.640 --> 2:29:54.160]  form of terror people couldn't believe it now it's everywhere tell us about it
[2:29:54.160 --> 2:29:57.440]  and and not only that it's right in your face so again here's the thing is we
[2:29:57.440 --> 2:30:00.560]  already knew because it came from military personnel came from law
[2:30:00.560 --> 2:30:03.800]  enforcement it came from peace officers around the country were becoming
[2:30:03.800 --> 2:30:08.480]  thoroughly disgusted with what they saw and this is just one example of where
[2:30:08.480 --> 2:30:13.880]  you go from behind the scenes out of the shadows and it creeps like a goo into
[2:30:13.880 --> 2:30:18.680]  the public eye the founding fathers warned everybody about this we had for
[2:30:18.680 --> 2:30:21.560]  instance and this is another thing people are why people aren't thinking about
[2:30:21.560 --> 2:30:27.800]  this but this is coming Alex ritz of a tinder ritz of a tinder there shall be
[2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:34.040]  no ritz of a tinder a rid of a tinder is where if I can't get Alex I grab his
[2:30:34.040 --> 2:30:38.400]  wife and his kids and his mom and his dad and I dig up even his old relatives
[2:30:38.400 --> 2:30:42.800]  and I torture or I abuse them they've been doing that in Iraq they advertise
[2:30:42.800 --> 2:30:45.920]  that they torture your children and then let you kill you come turn yourself in
[2:30:45.920 --> 2:30:50.720]  exactly and that is what this is an indirect violation of the premise the
[2:30:50.720 --> 2:30:56.240]  whole corp and foundation of our process the way we of the west would it would
[2:30:56.240 --> 2:31:00.880]  operate traditionally and the antithesis of our form of government and our
[2:31:00.880 --> 2:31:05.560]  psyche well it's pure evil I mean whoever does that is the dark side is the
[2:31:05.560 --> 2:31:10.160]  enemy exactly and that's one of the things here that's interesting is that
[2:31:10.160 --> 2:31:13.880]  again for people are wondering about that get yourself a pocket constitution
[2:31:13.880 --> 2:31:17.480]  you can get them from a number of different sources written printers but
[2:31:17.480 --> 2:31:22.240]  citizens rule books you will find a copy of the constitution you will find in it
[2:31:22.240 --> 2:31:28.360]  that there shall be no ritz of a tinder this is where again it's also turned the
[2:31:28.360 --> 2:31:32.880]  term was corruption of the blood in other words even if I Alex did something
[2:31:32.880 --> 2:31:37.360]  ten years ago we're gonna blame his sons his daughters his granddaughters and
[2:31:37.360 --> 2:31:42.000]  everybody will be charged with the same they can't punish your family house for
[2:31:42.000 --> 2:31:45.880]  what you've individually done that's right and again this is part of the whole
[2:31:45.880 --> 2:31:51.200]  concept of western jurisprudence but developed in England perfected in the
[2:31:51.200 --> 2:31:55.480]  united states and brought forward that's right and in fact if you rebelled
[2:31:55.480 --> 2:31:59.120]  against the king they would come and clap your whole family in irons but the
[2:31:59.120 --> 2:32:04.800]  Magna Carta which was hard being that was a paid for in blood 1215 at Ronnie
[2:32:04.800 --> 2:32:09.800]  Meade said no exactly and tied into that is what happened here we fought a war
[2:32:09.800 --> 2:32:14.560]  for independence which took us to the next step scraping the table off and
[2:32:14.560 --> 2:32:18.800]  breaking all of the chains this is critical to the overall concept of
[2:32:18.800 --> 2:32:22.920]  American justice in that all of the well actually it's also critical to the
[2:32:22.920 --> 2:32:26.480]  enemy occupying and destroying ours this and I want to point this out mark we
[2:32:26.480 --> 2:32:30.560]  stand on the shoulders of the British people who did fight against that in the
[2:32:30.560 --> 2:32:35.980]  now we stand on the shoulders of 1776 it's all part of a continual stream we
[2:32:35.980 --> 2:32:39.560]  are all connected to each other I do want to point out that it was almost 50
[2:32:39.560 --> 2:32:43.560]  percent in the parliament against attacking the colonies but the king came
[2:32:43.560 --> 2:32:48.160]  in and demanded that they vote for war so we also had friends in England there
[2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:51.520]  were people there who understood fully what was wrong about what was being done
[2:32:51.520 --> 2:32:54.680]  in fact even let's go one step well here we go mark tell everybody about it right
[2:32:54.680 --> 2:32:57.240]  now here we go
[2:32:58.720 --> 2:33:05.080]  rich of a tanner recap that mark and then bring us up to where we are today and
[2:33:05.080 --> 2:33:08.800]  you know one of the most important things here years ago the king could take a
[2:33:08.800 --> 2:33:11.960]  whole family he could grab the wife he could grab the kids but he could grab
[2:33:11.960 --> 2:33:15.600]  the grandma grandpa and when I said digging up bodies I'm not even I'm not
[2:33:15.600 --> 2:33:20.640]  that's not an exaggeration people one of the things was desecration of graves
[2:33:20.640 --> 2:33:24.440]  much in the same way that you would draw a quarter a person and take their body
[2:33:24.440 --> 2:33:28.960]  parts and you'll put the skulls on the on the on the bridge of London on London
[2:33:28.960 --> 2:33:32.360]  bridge and then take the body parts and spread all over the countryside they
[2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:37.800]  would do this also with family members remains in fact Cromwell had the king
[2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:43.200]  dug up and caught up and then I believe he was dug up to and be headed and
[2:33:43.200 --> 2:33:47.160]  ex another example is remember even for people are wondering about this even in
[2:33:47.160 --> 2:33:51.120]  the movie Braveheart you see an example remember where he had to go they
[2:33:51.120 --> 2:33:56.200]  desecrated the graves of his his brother and his father and so he went and dug
[2:33:56.200 --> 2:34:00.080]  up the grave of his wife and moved her body so she could not be desecrated by
[2:34:00.080 --> 2:34:05.520]  the enemy think about that this is stuff that sounds so bizarre but it is the
[2:34:05.520 --> 2:34:10.000]  nature of your enemy well premonoc to understand premonoc to is also in there
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:14.640]  where they would demand you know with your virgin wife on the honeymoon they
[2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:18.920]  would try to impregnate her quote breed them out and then they would even pick
[2:34:18.920 --> 2:34:22.200]  people that were there you know unofficial sons and give them power to
[2:34:22.200 --> 2:34:27.000]  me go between with the local slave class exactly many again people are going
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:31.240]  well that's back then really let's put it there's a whole issue here and we need
[2:34:31.240 --> 2:34:35.960]  to spend a couple of days on all the networks talking about the straw man
[2:34:35.960 --> 2:34:40.400]  because the straw man is where Americans have been reborn put back into
[2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:45.400]  bondage and it's the admiralty law of our enemies who are the bar members the
[2:34:45.400 --> 2:34:50.880]  British accredited registry the British accredited region C these
[2:34:50.880 --> 2:34:55.800]  creatures of the bar are lower royalists who have come back in to rebond
[2:34:55.800 --> 2:35:00.280]  re-indenture the American people that we have no we are no different in the
[2:35:00.280 --> 2:35:04.560]  battlefield today as we were in 1775 and they are using the declaration
[2:35:04.560 --> 2:35:09.120]  independence as a checklist to go step-by-step now real quick here we have
[2:35:09.120 --> 2:35:11.960]  a number of different manuals and I want to make sure we get this out if you want
[2:35:11.960 --> 2:35:20.520]  to find out more information you can go to PBN PO box 194 Dexter Michigan 4813

[2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:05.280]  six stamps now you send six stamps that because postage varies for all over the
[2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:11.360]  country it's a patchwork quilt anyway $5 plus six stamps covers the cost keeps
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:16.360]  the lights on allows the printing presses to continue to run number two is
[2:36:16.360 --> 2:36:21.800]  PM 10 we're going to simplify this PM 10 it's militia standard operating
[2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:30.760]  procedure SOP cost is $7 for this manual plus six stamps in shipping again
[2:36:30.760 --> 2:36:40.160]  that's the militia SOP it's PM 10 that is $7 plus six regular stamps now you can

[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:08.200]  be sending updates on this the printer is doing an excellent job she has done
[2:37:08.200 --> 2:37:11.640]  some phenomenal work I'm very happy with it I'm going to point out that a lot of
[2:37:11.640 --> 2:37:16.840]  the artwork that you see is all been done by people in the Patriot effort
[2:37:16.840 --> 2:37:20.000]  Mark tell folks about your new book the first in the battle for the Republic
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:24.160]  series I had there are three books that are there out the one printer is we're
[2:37:24.160 --> 2:37:26.920]  having a heck of a time because the original went out to the printer another
[2:37:26.920 --> 2:37:31.680]  printer out west but battle for the Republic it's the battle it's the second
[2:37:31.680 --> 2:37:35.680]  book series I've written the first is the dagger wars there are 12 books we've
[2:37:35.680 --> 2:37:40.240]  gone through three printings it's for militia command training we are going
[2:37:40.240 --> 2:37:43.880]  to publicly release this probably by the end of the year because it's been in
[2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:48.240]  private circulation for three years now that's the dagger war it's 12 books
[2:37:48.240 --> 2:37:53.920]  battle for the Republic begins where the dagger war ends and battle for the
[2:37:53.920 --> 2:37:59.720]  Republic book one the dance of swords is basically the how it starts the present
[2:37:59.720 --> 2:38:04.240]  book that is most recently imprinting is battle for the Republic the winter war
[2:38:04.240 --> 2:38:11.080]  cost is $25 these are signed copy editions anybody who wants a copy again
[2:38:11.080 --> 2:38:21.360]  use the PBN P.O. Box 194 Dexter Michigan 48130 address and it's battle for the
[2:38:21.360 --> 2:38:24.960]  Republic the winter war that printing the latest one is out right now we just
[2:38:24.960 --> 2:38:29.760]  got the latest boxes from the printer it's not just a storyline this is a how
[2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:34.840]  to the objective one of the reasons I want to do is explain the psyche explain
[2:38:34.840 --> 2:38:39.600]  the experience try to give you a taste and I'm not going to ruin the read for
[2:38:39.600 --> 2:38:42.280]  you but there's something I'll say about this when we come on the air some of
[2:38:42.280 --> 2:38:46.560]  the time later Alex I want more people to read it and we do want input I want
[2:38:46.560 --> 2:38:50.240]  people to respond because I know that many thousands of this book are already
[2:38:50.240 --> 2:38:55.920]  out battle for the Republic the winter war it's $25 if you're going to have it
[2:38:55.920 --> 2:38:59.740]  signed the only thing I ask is print out the name you want it signed to so the
[2:38:59.740 --> 2:39:03.880]  I can read it so I can make sure I scripted properly for you that's up to
[2:39:03.880 --> 2:39:07.040]  you you don't have to have send a name you don't have to have it signed mark
[2:39:07.040 --> 2:39:10.920]  before you leave us in the next 25 minutes or so I there's a few things my
[2:39:10.920 --> 2:39:14.720]  uncle last week when you're on with us he wanted to know just in a nutshell how
[2:39:14.720 --> 2:39:18.560]  you dealt with seven years of false incarceration and came out even stronger
[2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:23.280]  and more eloquent not even near broken in fact energized but before we do that
[2:39:23.280 --> 2:39:27.680]  people misinterpret what I'm about to say because they love to but you
[2:39:27.680 --> 2:39:30.280]  understand that you've dealt with it you've lived it so I want to bring this
[2:39:30.280 --> 2:39:35.480]  up to you I don't want to sit here and tell people go join the militia so that
[2:39:35.480 --> 2:39:40.600]  they go fall into the hands of beds trying to provocateur as an example we
[2:39:40.600 --> 2:39:44.600]  were talking about Israelis in the news yesterday I learned of it as it was
[2:39:44.600 --> 2:39:50.040]  ending we're here in town and they're taking hundreds of Austin cops back to
[2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:55.160]  brainwash them about how to set up a police state here we've got an Israel
[2:39:55.160 --> 2:39:58.440]  in Israeli intelligence running around killing people in Austin there's no
[2:39:58.440 --> 2:40:03.440]  doubt of that I mean it's just open messages to everybody and Aaron goes
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:06.680]  who just got out of UT two and a half years ago he's been here ever since he's
[2:40:06.680 --> 2:40:11.600]  like oh my god I remember when I was just part of an anti-war group I come
[2:40:11.600 --> 2:40:15.080]  walking out on the street and this guy runs and goes I'm an Israeli I'm anti-war
[2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:18.360]  but don't think the government doesn't know who you are let's attack George Bush
[2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:21.560]  and he's just said get the hell away from me but then saw the guy at other
[2:40:21.560 --> 2:40:25.440]  meetings trying to stir stuff up of course I mean they're they're trying to
[2:40:25.440 --> 2:40:29.680]  create fake groups or get get idiots to go out and you know do something violent
[2:40:29.680 --> 2:40:36.160]  so this is happening so the question is how to organize well I mean let me just
[2:40:36.160 --> 2:40:42.160]  stop you Marcus I want to put this out for people the BATF back in 1994 wanted
[2:40:42.160 --> 2:40:45.200]  to demonize and of course Mark knows us before the audience wanted to demonize
[2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:49.520]  militias so they went and found a methamphetamine cooking Hell's Angels
[2:40:49.520 --> 2:40:55.960]  subgroup that called the Vipers in Arizona total idiots and they and the guy
[2:40:55.960 --> 2:40:58.480]  gave him hundreds of thousands of dollars in drugs and then he just said
[2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:02.480]  let's just call ourselves a militia I'll give you money we'll dress up in
[2:41:02.480 --> 2:41:07.480]  uniforms and joke around and then they busted them and said guns drugs viper
[2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:12.000]  militia and so I want to be clear to people a militia person wears a suit
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:14.880]  and goes down and speaks at city council they're also ready to defend their
[2:41:14.880 --> 2:41:17.880]  country from enemies foreign and domestic they're ready to help in in
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:23.000]  floods or fires or emergencies we don't creep around and hide in the bushes but
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:27.040]  but people also do covertly have other subgroups and cells the training case
[2:41:27.040 --> 2:41:30.600]  we were ever invaded say by the Russians and so anybody that tells you to
[2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:33.920]  creep around and let's do something illegal or let's go burn down the
[2:41:33.920 --> 2:41:38.440]  sheriff's department that is a fed that is an informant that is someone who
[2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:42.960]  wants to send you to prison so mark I think if we're inviting people to form
[2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:47.120]  militias which is as is American as mom and apple pie and more so than baseball
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:51.720]  came before the flag before apple pie before baseball let's explain to them
[2:41:51.720 --> 2:41:55.840]  how to not be infiltrated absolutely first of all most important is if you
[2:41:55.840 --> 2:41:59.600]  want to know who you can trust think about your family the bottom line is
[2:41:59.600 --> 2:42:03.000]  this the that we're still looking at a one-man you know the individual
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:08.080]  constrained by himself effectively first of all and can join as needed as things
[2:42:08.080 --> 2:42:11.320]  developed that is the answer that is the unstoppable force the individual that is
[2:42:11.320 --> 2:42:13.880]  the unstoppable force go in the mirror and take a look at the mirror there's
[2:42:13.880 --> 2:42:16.720]  the person who's going to stop this thing from happening times the millions
[2:42:16.720 --> 2:42:20.560]  upon millions of people who are listening number two is remember five man
[2:42:20.560 --> 2:42:23.920]  fire team well guess what you're talking about home defense you're talking
[2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:27.440]  about protecting a retreat you're talking about defending your community
[2:42:27.440 --> 2:42:31.240]  well look at your friends and family that you've known for either all your
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:36.040]  life or for say 20 and 30 years is there any doubt what that person's been
[2:42:36.040 --> 2:42:39.840]  doing well that's the person you want to turn to and you want to work with and
[2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:42.120]  all of you listening some of you're going well I don't know what you better
[2:42:42.120 --> 2:42:45.520]  start working on educating as many people as you can and that's where all
[2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:48.640]  the database comes in that we've provided to the patriot effort and by the
[2:42:48.640 --> 2:42:52.920]  way this isn't even military at some levels this is just your cousin your
[2:42:52.920 --> 2:42:56.280]  brother your neighbor your war buddies this is going out and getting ten
[2:42:56.280 --> 2:43:00.520]  acres 20 30 acres together starting gardens hanging out you know it's fun
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:05.560]  to get together in tribal units of mutual defense that's and you all need
[2:43:05.560 --> 2:43:10.320]  your own armored keeps go ahead that's right and by the way this is biblical if
[2:43:10.320 --> 2:43:14.440]  you go into the Old Testament even with regard to Moses and how he moved move
[2:43:14.440 --> 2:43:18.480]  the people there was a point where he's where his father remembers father-in-law
[2:43:18.480 --> 2:43:21.080]  came in and said you're exhausting yourself I'm abbreviating this he said
[2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:24.760]  you're exhausting yourself he goes yeah well you're trying to do everything you're
[2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:28.600]  trying to micromanage everything you can't do this you have to assign and
[2:43:28.600 --> 2:43:32.080]  you have to work with smaller increments of people and this is why the people
[2:43:32.080 --> 2:43:35.880]  will be divided and that's where you see the whole numerical issue come forward
[2:43:35.880 --> 2:43:40.800]  about how best to govern the people and how to operate well the same is true
[2:43:40.800 --> 2:43:44.240]  with militia formations you get too big you're too wild all you basically it's
[2:43:44.240 --> 2:43:48.040]  the same thing with the military they don't have these blob formations they
[2:43:48.040 --> 2:43:51.800]  work with specific increments and here's the here's the kicker nobody realizes
[2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:57.520]  that they get their information from biblical guidelines oh oh do all the
[2:43:57.520 --> 2:44:00.240]  heaven forbid all the communists are all put their hands over the years and
[2:44:00.240 --> 2:44:03.680]  shrieking away from the radio on that one well of course they are socialists are
[2:44:03.680 --> 2:44:08.320]  too old all say that but the bottom line is is that the concept of how best to
[2:44:08.320 --> 2:44:12.560]  manage a group of people or groups of people was laid down in the Old
[2:44:12.560 --> 2:44:18.200]  Testament nigh on how many thousand years ago oh oh yeah that's in that's in
[2:44:18.200 --> 2:44:22.960]  Leviticus isn't it you can go right through Leviticus numbers also again
[2:44:22.960 --> 2:44:27.800]  almost all of the Old Testament reinforces it over and over again in
[2:44:27.800 --> 2:44:31.160]  fact sometimes this was interesting if you go through some of the text you know
[2:44:31.160 --> 2:44:35.120]  different books it's reinforced three times over now there's a rule there
[2:44:35.120 --> 2:44:39.080]  remember anytime that it's biblically reinforced like that it is most
[2:44:39.080 --> 2:44:44.120]  important so it will actually be reinforced and reinforced and reinforced
[2:44:44.120 --> 2:44:47.960]  I do this sometimes not jokingly but not jokingly on the air when I repeat
[2:44:47.960 --> 2:44:52.040]  something three times it's again to show that it's doctrinally read if you
[2:44:52.040 --> 2:44:56.720]  reinforcing it systematically most important here is again you can work
[2:44:56.720 --> 2:45:01.600]  with your brother your cousin your uncle dad okay dad's working with his his
[2:45:01.600 --> 2:45:06.160]  sons his sons work with their grand you know with his grandsons you know these
[2:45:06.160 --> 2:45:10.280]  people there is no doubt now again you're training as individuals let me
[2:45:10.280 --> 2:45:14.120]  give you some real quick hints here get airsoft why should you get airsoft I'm
[2:45:14.120 --> 2:45:17.840]  abbreviating because we only got so much time airsoft is cheap you can go to
[2:45:17.840 --> 2:45:25.440]  centerfiresystems.com buy an airsoft 45 for $6.95 it does everything a 45 does
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:30.080]  when it comes to operation even drops a magazine you can fire indoors all day
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:34.880]  absolutely quietly and practice at marksmanship not piddled around and just
[2:45:34.880 --> 2:45:39.440]  popping the curtains you can actually lay out a range and have a copy of an
[2:45:39.440 --> 2:45:47.360]  AR-15 a copy of a H&K pistol a copy of a Smith pistol a copy of a 45 and with
[2:45:47.360 --> 2:45:51.880]  airsoft and with little targets you can actually practice all of the basic skills
[2:45:51.880 --> 2:45:55.960]  well take BB guns and over and over again take BB guns I haven't had time the
[2:45:55.960 --> 2:45:59.560]  last really 10 years to shoot every week every day like I did growing up but I
[2:45:59.560 --> 2:46:03.280]  was trying you know all the guys are old World War two vets this is almost people
[2:46:03.280 --> 2:46:06.040]  freak out when they say this but I shot was shooting four tens when I was four
[2:46:06.040 --> 2:46:10.360]  and I remember taking me out home everybody I know was yeah people don't
[2:46:10.360 --> 2:46:13.360]  believe that though who don't know gun culture and that then that goes back
[2:46:13.360 --> 2:46:16.640]  hundreds of years in our frontier training and the shotgun was put in my
[2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:20.200]  hands I was taught basic safety and I would shoot coffee cans at close range
[2:46:20.200 --> 2:46:24.160]  just to get me used to the fire the recoil to not be afraid of it this was
[2:46:24.160 --> 2:46:27.360]  all systematic then you're giving a BB gun you're always watched when you're
[2:46:27.360 --> 2:46:30.040]  little when you have it you're taught how to shoot it out of aiming then you're
[2:46:30.040 --> 2:46:34.640]  given a 22 when you're six then a shotgun and then and then and then by the
[2:46:34.640 --> 2:46:39.040]  time I was like 12 years old I could shoot to the same hole at 200 yards with
[2:46:39.040 --> 2:46:46.160]  a 243 with just a hundred dollar sight now now I can't do that but if you can
[2:46:46.160 --> 2:46:50.880]  within a quarter-inch group I guess what Alex you'll have any AK-74 M4 or any
[2:46:50.880 --> 2:46:54.280]  rifle but I mean that's my point though is with that basic training I was given
[2:46:54.280 --> 2:46:58.720]  I had no idea I was being given the training that made Davy Crockett and
[2:46:58.720 --> 2:47:02.280]  made the people the Alamo and everything else but that's what America was and
[2:47:02.280 --> 2:47:06.840]  that's why we went to war it was so powerful now we now we're losing those
[2:47:06.840 --> 2:47:10.320]  skills is what I'm saying well here's the thing airsoft one of the advantages
[2:47:10.320 --> 2:47:14.080]  number I'm focusing everybody on this for a reason airsoft is a few dollars for
[2:47:14.080 --> 2:47:17.120]  the simplest models don't go by the most expensive unless you already got them
[2:47:17.120 --> 2:47:20.720]  don't worry about it you can get a copy of the air 15 that does everything the
[2:47:20.720 --> 2:47:25.240]  air 15 does here's the advantage I can take five of those rifles I can put five
[2:47:25.240 --> 2:47:29.360]  people and a rain on a little range in the basement I can teach them basic
[2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:34.160]  pistol and rifle marksmanship without any fear of anybody being injured I will
[2:47:34.160 --> 2:47:38.640]  teach them to the point where it becomes second nature the next tier is to take
[2:47:38.640 --> 2:47:43.120]  them to a can you know a conventional range saving ammunition by wasting most
[2:47:43.120 --> 2:47:47.280]  of my time where my my I would be consuming ammo teaching piece of people
[2:47:47.280 --> 2:47:51.260]  basic pistol crap by the way folks this isn't about the bravado and uniforms and
[2:47:51.260 --> 2:47:56.160]  outfits it's just quiet serious happy hidden in plain view gearing up to defend
[2:47:56.160 --> 2:47:59.480]  your families from the aggravated felons the police and military are hiring
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:02.960]  and mass oh and by the way I think we should be very proud though the fact
[2:48:02.960 --> 2:48:06.840]  that we are if we are all in the militia in fact everybody trying to know we
[2:48:06.840 --> 2:48:10.760]  don't have to apologize no I'm not saying be quiet everybody else I mean you
[2:48:10.760 --> 2:48:14.920]  know what I mean not waving guns around acting fool is the reverse that's the
[2:48:14.920 --> 2:48:18.800]  whole idea behind progressive training this is the whole point when you teach
[2:48:18.800 --> 2:48:23.080]  a person to use the weapon on the range focus is the key everything becomes
[2:48:23.080 --> 2:48:27.360]  center of the wet target weapon becomes the control device and the target
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:30.800]  becomes the center of the universe and everything is focused upon that and it
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:36.640]  requires one keyword discipline tied in with that is responsibility most people
[2:48:36.640 --> 2:48:40.600]  don't want to be responsible they want to be two-year-old children sucking on
[2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:44.560]  something constantly staring at a boob tube and having somebody else run
[2:48:44.560 --> 2:48:48.400]  everything they do we're not going to be two-year-olds and I think militia
[2:48:48.400 --> 2:48:51.920]  training also should start with people going on and hike it up you know ten
[2:48:51.920 --> 2:48:56.840]  mile hikes up now of hillsides this is where again step one is we're teaching
[2:48:56.840 --> 2:49:01.120]  basic rifle marksmanship people get a chance to get physically active we get
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:05.320]  into the weapons base we now have basic training with the and are familiar with
[2:49:05.320 --> 2:49:09.240]  the form the form feel and basic operation of the weapon we're
[2:49:09.240 --> 2:49:13.520]  going to graduate to now even if you don't have those weapons here's another
[2:49:13.520 --> 2:49:18.200]  advantage you now have familiarity with an arm that you may capture or acquire
[2:49:18.200 --> 2:49:22.120]  in the future one of the other reasons that even though people say well they're
[2:49:22.120 --> 2:49:29.000]  just toys they at most airsoft is such a cheap vastly advanced training aid that
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:32.680]  you couldn't go out and build if you wanted to well that's how I'm already
[2:49:32.680 --> 2:49:37.360]  training my four-year-old daughter my five-year-old son is that you just give
[2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:40.840]  them the little plastic you know safer dart guns the airsoft you're talking
[2:49:40.840 --> 2:49:43.960]  about and they're in the house shooting targets all day and don't even know
[2:49:43.960 --> 2:49:47.840]  they're being trained for firearm use and that's right and you can do it all
[2:49:47.840 --> 2:49:52.800]  day with anybody knowing now step two is again equipment and gear remember to
[2:49:52.800 --> 2:49:56.160]  tailor the equipment that your person is gonna go I need an assault vest I need
[2:49:56.160 --> 2:50:00.080]  to have what they're using in Iraq what they're using in Iraq is not effective
[2:50:00.080 --> 2:50:03.960]  for most of the terrain or battlefield of the United States hate to tell you guys
[2:50:03.960 --> 2:50:08.880]  most of the junk that's being used over there is specifically engineered for the
[2:50:08.880 --> 2:50:14.160]  battlefields of the desert and for a specific and unique environmental
[2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:20.120]  condition deserts are just like tropical rainforest they're very specialized we
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:23.320]  live in a temperate environment so your equipment has to be tailored and
[2:50:23.320 --> 2:50:28.240]  engineered plus camouflaged to meet the needs of the battlefield that you are
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:31.600]  looking at right now that you're living in now Texas has some fans well that
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:34.680]  means that means you're wearing if it's in the city you're you're wearing a
[2:50:34.680 --> 2:50:38.820]  t-shirt with a with a jacket that's called the pockets you need ready to be
[2:50:38.820 --> 2:50:41.800]  slipped right over and pants so you blend in that's what I forgot about a lot
[2:50:41.800 --> 2:50:45.000]  of the mainline militias running around the city and camo and commander
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:50.040]  outfits the militia needs to be able to be covert or overt whatever it needs to
[2:50:50.040 --> 2:50:56.520]  be mark let's talk behind scenes about that again mark we're for the web this
[2:50:56.520 --> 2:50:59.560]  will all be up it's live right now but it's also gonna be posted on YouTube and
[2:50:59.560 --> 2:51:03.360]  present planet dot TV all the members are watching right now mark but I know you
[2:51:03.360 --> 2:51:05.760]  don't want to get into this but we need to specifically so people don't get
[2:51:05.760 --> 2:51:09.320]  burned out there you know they have these federal traps waiting for people
[2:51:09.320 --> 2:51:12.400]  where you get to the militia meeting and it's led by a fed as you know about a
[2:51:12.400 --> 2:51:15.680]  third of them are and they say let's go do violent things let's get ready with
[2:51:15.680 --> 2:51:20.520]  pipe bombs then everybody goes to prison we're doing legal lawful above board
[2:51:20.520 --> 2:51:25.160]  training really civil defense to defend against tyranny to prepare to protect
[2:51:25.160 --> 2:51:29.760]  our country what are the telltale signs to look out for I mean the things I just
[2:51:29.760 --> 2:51:33.880]  said exactly actually well let's put it this way I'll let's put the crate let's
[2:51:33.880 --> 2:51:38.400]  lay the criteria down for arms I want the longest barrel I can get so I can
[2:51:38.400 --> 2:51:41.720]  reach and hit him so far out they never know where the bullet came from so never
[2:51:41.720 --> 2:51:47.400]  cut a barrel down okay rule number one no short weapons I don't need them I want
[2:51:47.400 --> 2:51:52.200]  to hit my enemy at maximum range I'm getting older I can't run as fast okay
[2:51:52.200 --> 2:51:56.120]  shotguns for instance that was one of the things remember they've always tried to
[2:51:56.120 --> 2:51:59.840]  entice people with shortening shotgun you don't need a short shotgun people I
[2:51:59.840 --> 2:52:04.040]  want a medium length barrel and I want to put a big long magazine underneath it
[2:52:04.040 --> 2:52:07.760]  and I want to keep a standard stock on it I don't even need a folding stock I
[2:52:07.760 --> 2:52:12.120]  want to be able to hit the target farther out now as far as explosive devices
[2:52:12.120 --> 2:52:16.680]  none of the above you don't need any period you know why when I plug the
[2:52:16.680 --> 2:52:20.040]  bugger on the other side he's carrying 40 millimeter grenades he's carrying
[2:52:20.040 --> 2:52:23.760]  grenades and pyrotechnics I'm gonna strip off his carcass I'm gonna strip him
[2:52:23.760 --> 2:52:27.700]  bare but naked I'm not the dogs chew on what's left of him that's how it's gonna
[2:52:27.700 --> 2:52:31.240]  work so I don't need to create and don't let it in it as far as people going well
[2:52:31.240 --> 2:52:35.240]  we need this that now you can understand how to use them and one of the but I
[2:52:35.240 --> 2:52:38.240]  want to explain what feds do they'll be looking at you like they're on a rabbit
[2:52:38.240 --> 2:52:42.600]  hunt they will be trying to get people to do things illegal in the first five
[2:52:42.600 --> 2:52:47.040]  minutes and I want people to understand you do not want to get into their traps
[2:52:47.040 --> 2:52:51.880]  and I'm just trying to explain that to listeners one of the ways to say that is
[2:52:51.880 --> 2:52:56.800]  again keep the unit at the fire again fire team and squad make sure it's
[2:52:56.800 --> 2:53:01.360]  people that all people you know if you put the senior man who has had the most
[2:53:01.360 --> 2:53:05.640]  experience obviously will gravitate to the position of authority if dad's been
[2:53:05.640 --> 2:53:09.800]  in world war two or been in Korea or Vietnam he's probably seen a little
[2:53:09.800 --> 2:53:13.840]  dying and death so maybe it'd be good to listen to the guy who's already bled a
[2:53:13.840 --> 2:53:19.200]  bit okay now if none of you have combat experience that's fine the first rule is
[2:53:19.200 --> 2:53:25.360]  do you know each other now common sense is kiss keep a simple stupid you do not
[2:53:25.360 --> 2:53:29.760]  need any special super you know what wonder toys or special weapon systems
[2:53:29.760 --> 2:53:33.800]  or nuclear devices we're not looking for anything other than conventional
[2:53:33.800 --> 2:53:38.400]  infantry arms conventional handguns nothing modified and again even if you're
[2:53:38.400 --> 2:53:42.960]  ever disarmed even if you're ever disarmed a knife and will is is
[2:53:42.960 --> 2:53:46.920]  everything you need to get whatever you need if I have to start with a club or a
[2:53:46.920 --> 2:53:50.200]  knife that's where I go but the whole point is as my old martial arts
[2:53:50.200 --> 2:53:53.560]  instructor said when he said well name for me a martial art people said boxing
[2:53:53.560 --> 2:53:57.320]  taekwondo whatever and this was survivalist keep evasion he goes what
[2:53:57.320 --> 2:54:02.120]  about a knife what about a stick and he goes then what about a gun everybody
[2:54:02.120 --> 2:54:05.360]  went oh my martial arts instructor is mentioning a gun he goes yeah because
[2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:08.960]  all of the other techniques and one of the the next thing he said is if I'm
[2:54:08.960 --> 2:54:12.800]  using my hands and I'm a soldier I've done something wrong here we go mark
[2:54:12.800 --> 2:54:15.960]  back to the full audience
[2:54:16.960 --> 2:54:20.800]  all right the government is hiring aggravated felons illegal alien
[2:54:20.800 --> 2:54:24.800]  aggravated felons mashing them against us openly training to murder us and put
[2:54:24.800 --> 2:54:30.200]  us into camps in mass enforceably inject us and nerve gas our cities and the
[2:54:30.200 --> 2:54:33.920]  founding fathers said the militia is to defend against the criminal government
[2:54:33.920 --> 2:54:37.400]  that was in the supreme court brief last month and against common street
[2:54:37.400 --> 2:54:41.280]  thugs so we're here talking about what is the law what America is if you're
[2:54:41.280 --> 2:54:45.800]  against the militia as a lot of mark says potlicking neocons are you're
[2:54:45.800 --> 2:54:49.800]  against the republic mark we got this segment and one more you're going over
[2:54:49.800 --> 2:54:53.880]  people forming up into their civil defense groups that's what the militia is
[2:54:53.880 --> 2:54:59.120]  we didn't even have the National Guard until 1906 and preparing and a lot of
[2:54:59.120 --> 2:55:02.880]  that means found a place with a water well you know having storeable food and
[2:55:02.880 --> 2:55:07.000]  just being ready to defend your family is really what this comes down to or you
[2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:10.880]  can go to the camp and let the foreign troops put you a mass grave and I guess
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:13.800]  that's what a lot of you're going to do in mark ornke well another thing you're
[2:55:13.800 --> 2:55:21.000]  real quick is if you're interested to search mark last name ko er n ke look
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:25.640]  for videos you'll find equipping for the new world order part one and two on
[2:55:25.640 --> 2:55:29.320]  youtube and in other places where other people have posted a lot of say thank
[2:55:29.320 --> 2:55:33.960]  you because it's publicly available that gives you basic information you've got
[2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:36.800]  groups that are going to comment back and forth the bottom line is this a lot
[2:55:36.800 --> 2:55:40.560]  of people have never been in uniform or never used equipment before this was
[2:55:40.560 --> 2:55:45.080]  designed to give you ideas you run with a ball when it comes to what you need to
[2:55:45.080 --> 2:55:48.440]  get the job done you're going to have to figure out what fits your wallet
[2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:51.880]  combined with what it is that ergonomically works with your age group
[2:55:51.880 --> 2:55:55.920]  which is something I address you've got very young people if your children were
[2:55:55.920 --> 2:55:59.000]  separated from you you've got them dancing around in circles with nothing
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:03.360]  on when they get separated if they get separated from you you'd be gnashing of
[2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:08.480]  teeth and running of hair and whatever okay instead you put a 72 hour kit
[2:56:08.480 --> 2:56:14.280]  together that it's that child and is on their back it has to be user-friendly if
[2:56:14.280 --> 2:56:17.880]  something happens and they get separated you to basically you're going to have to
[2:56:17.880 --> 2:56:21.920]  instruct them on what to do or how to deal with this even if they're a small
[2:56:21.920 --> 2:56:26.400]  child well everybody now when especially most of us live in these urban centers
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:29.240]  you need to have a place where you meet your wife and children especially their
[2:56:29.240 --> 2:56:33.040]  older children and then if that place doesn't work a backup secondary place
[2:56:33.040 --> 2:56:36.480]  and I don't meet you here in an hour I'll meet you here in 24 hours or here in
[2:56:36.480 --> 2:56:41.200]  three days progressive evacuation to move away from the epicenter of the threat
[2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:45.720]  and a threat can be government trying to create a police state remember we have a
[2:56:45.720 --> 2:56:49.640]  road government that blew up buildings on 9-11 they're not playing games they're
[2:56:49.640 --> 2:56:54.320]  not nice and they're not going away so focus on moving away from the objective
[2:56:54.320 --> 2:56:58.760]  again one of the things I did it go to YouTube and punch in equipping for the
[2:56:58.760 --> 2:57:02.760]  new world order part one and two you'll find them post there if you want a nice

[3:01:54.360 --> 3:01:59.800]  you will come back alive rule number one I did have a lot of good instructors and
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:03.760]  survival escape and evasion one of the class I had one of many classes by men
[3:02:03.760 --> 3:02:08.200]  who had just come out of detention camps and concentration camps were Vietnam
[3:02:08.200 --> 3:02:14.640]  POWs and Korean War POWs that helped a great deal my my belief in our Lord
[3:02:14.640 --> 3:02:18.760]  Jesus Christ and the strength that he gave me is key and critical to the
[3:02:18.760 --> 3:02:21.520]  process those people that you're worried about are saying oh I'm gonna commit
[3:02:21.520 --> 3:02:26.280]  suicide shame on you God gave you a great life you take advantage of that
[3:02:26.280 --> 3:02:30.320]  life you bite the hind end of the other side you kick them in the slats and when
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:34.280]  you're done we end up free we end up enjoying our liberty that was a key to
[3:02:34.280 --> 3:02:37.120]  this whole thing you know what prisons like it's like being at the albuquerque
[3:02:37.120 --> 3:02:40.920]  bus terminal you know what the albuquerque per cookie bus terminal is
[3:02:40.920 --> 3:02:44.540]  most per impersonal big airport type place you ever seen people coming and
[3:02:44.540 --> 3:02:48.520]  going you don't know him summer goose summer nutcases you know what you focus
[3:02:48.520 --> 3:02:53.040]  on the idea you're going on another bus and going somewhere else that's the key
[3:02:53.040 --> 3:02:57.160]  to this whole thing the enemy wants us to they want to pause our time they want
[3:02:57.160 --> 3:03:01.600]  to pause our lives they're like Paris they are parasites you know what if you
[3:03:01.600 --> 3:03:04.760]  all get tired of them and you kick them in the slats and drive their hiding out
[3:03:04.760 --> 3:03:08.400]  of this country you will be amazed and you know what the first time that we
[3:03:08.400 --> 3:03:12.920]  have to pull the trigger and everybody goes oh I'm gonna say oh shut up when
[3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:17.640]  the time comes you will find such an uplifting weight that just just sheds
[3:03:17.640 --> 3:03:22.520]  from you because it is time that you will find out real quick what liberty is
[3:03:22.520 --> 3:03:26.360]  all about it with life and liberty is all about this mark I remember growing
[3:03:26.360 --> 3:03:29.360]  up in Dallas and you know having three or four guys corner me and start beating
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:32.520]  the hell out of me and the feeling of just fighting back and being cornered
[3:03:32.520 --> 3:03:35.440]  and being in the right you know when you start slugging them and they start
[3:03:35.440 --> 3:03:39.920]  falling it's it is it's an uplifting feeling of you'll just fight back you're
[3:03:39.920 --> 3:03:44.080]  gonna win the other side expects you to lay down you know what they want they
[3:03:44.080 --> 3:03:48.920]  want to cheat victory remember the basic rule of sudden school is convince the
[3:03:48.920 --> 3:03:53.800]  enemy it's futile to resist before the first arrow has left the first bowl and
[3:03:53.800 --> 3:03:57.360]  that's what they're doing right now guess what the other side they died just
[3:03:57.360 --> 3:04:01.640]  like everyone else you know what I've got a basic rule it's in in fact battle
[3:04:01.640 --> 3:04:04.840]  for the republic the winter war I wrote the book series so that you could
[3:04:04.840 --> 3:04:10.280]  understand from the from the mental experience the physical and the mental
[3:04:10.280 --> 3:04:14.400]  experience from all the different directions I well that I that can be
[3:04:14.400 --> 3:04:19.360]  imagined okay and the purpose behind this is to understand that it is not
[3:04:19.360 --> 3:04:23.360]  futile to resist just the reverse the only people that are saying that are the
[3:04:23.360 --> 3:04:27.320]  jackasses on the other side who want to rape kill pillage and burn this country
[3:04:27.320 --> 3:04:31.360]  and as soon as we kick them in the slats we all go home and enjoy ourselves
[3:04:31.360 --> 3:04:35.600]  mark corn came is this we're already home Alex we're here that's it mark and

[3:07:37.680 --> 3:07:42.440]  a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to
[3:07:42.440 --> 3:07:50.520]  tell their story Whitman EPA director on the 18 made a statement that the air
[3:07:50.520 --> 3:07:55.640]  was safe to breathe this film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as
[3:07:55.640 --> 3:08:02.360]  brave souls throughout the world take out big brother mainstream media
[3:08:02.360 --> 3:08:10.080]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the
[3:08:10.080 --> 3:08:18.560]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones this is it the
[3:08:18.560 --> 3:08:24.000]  last ditch defense of the Republic before it goes into the hot zone war they
[3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:29.200]  want to bag this country and run a Nazi slash Soviet extermination up every top
[3:08:29.200 --> 3:08:37.600]  expert we have on agrees on our White House CIA advisors historians Nobel
[3:08:37.600 --> 3:08:42.880]  Prize winners the black cop is upon us they really plan on gutting it all and
[3:08:42.880 --> 3:08:46.640]  going for broke and killing the country once and for all they try to wrap all
[3:08:46.640 --> 3:08:50.240]  their criminal agendas in the American flag but they're being defeated the true
[3:08:50.240 --> 3:08:54.840]  patriots are rising to the occasion in the final last ditch that means the last
[3:08:54.840 --> 3:08:59.240]  ditch in our defenses the Alamo here as the new world order comes up over the
[3:08:59.240 --> 3:09:03.640]  parapets we're joined the next 40 minutes then did in its consent and
[3:09:03.640 --> 3:09:08.040]  scheduled we're gonna be calling him to talk about impeachment we had Willie
[3:09:08.040 --> 3:09:12.240]  Nelson in a barn burning interview in the first hour that's why I've
[3:09:12.240 --> 3:09:15.280]  abbreviated some of the guests today because I said I'd call him last week
[3:09:15.280 --> 3:09:19.800]  to get him on the call for impeachment and I just didn't get around to calling
[3:09:19.800 --> 3:09:24.240]  so I call him this morning and he goes let's do it right now so he had him on
[3:09:24.240 --> 3:09:28.120]  then I didn't want to ask you about doing some big 9-11 truth movement thing
[3:09:28.120 --> 3:09:31.840]  because kind of at a subconscious level I don't want to work or the craziness or
[3:09:31.840 --> 3:09:35.520]  people wanting to be involved and all the nuttiness of it so I did never ask him
[3:09:35.520 --> 3:09:40.120]  the caller asking me so sure I'll do it and then I asked him off air and he said
[3:09:40.120 --> 3:09:43.040]  that he wants me to basically organize it run I said you want to organize it
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:46.440]  right goes oh Alex you tell me and call me tomorrow what you want to do but I

[3:10:34.960 --> 3:10:38.040]  day that had happened but it was a dark light of the new world order that carried
[3:10:38.040 --> 3:10:42.840]  out the killing so darkness on that you know that bright winter day so black
[3:10:42.840 --> 3:10:45.920]  sunshine is the poetic term and I've come up with it maybe name something else
[3:10:45.920 --> 3:10:50.720]  but I've got some more interviews to do it's cinema verite no voice over Jim
[3:10:50.720 --> 3:10:54.280]  Mars is in it a bunch of other people but the central to it is St. John Hunt
[3:10:54.280 --> 3:10:58.400]  son of E Howard Hunt and when you see Mission Impossible Ethan Hunt that
[3:10:58.400 --> 3:11:03.080]  characters named after his father CIA section chief black op commander over
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:06.320]  through a bunch of countries we knew he was photographed as being one of the
[3:11:06.320 --> 3:11:10.040]  tramps we knew he was involved always and then before he died he admitted on
[3:11:10.040 --> 3:11:15.040]  video and on audio that he indeed had been involved in management of the hit
[3:11:15.040 --> 3:11:19.040]  against JFK and he's got his new e-book out it was too hot for any of the
[3:11:19.040 --> 3:11:22.960]  publishers to handle though he may put it in book form paper book form soon I
[3:11:22.960 --> 3:11:27.560]  hope he does but he has his new book out with a lot of incredible stuff stuff's
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:30.880]  never been covered before in his new book and we'll tell you how to get that

[3:11:45.600 --> 3:11:51.400]  time we had down in Dallas and you know working hard to uncover the truth and
[3:11:51.400 --> 3:11:56.600]  bring it to the to the American people into the world in general is is is what
[3:11:56.600 --> 3:12:02.120]  you're here for brother so so I'm glad to be on your show again absolutely St.
[3:12:02.120 --> 3:12:04.800]  John for those that haven't heard you the few times you've been here or on
[3:12:04.800 --> 3:12:09.840]  coast to coast I am and a few others or Rolling Stone that broke it all a year
[3:12:09.840 --> 3:12:12.960]  ago or so why don't you break down who you are your dad and then go to the
[3:12:12.960 --> 3:12:16.120]  basics and then tell us about the book and some of the things that people never
[3:12:16.120 --> 3:12:23.240]  heard before on the radio okay well in a nutshell my father is E Howard Hunt
[3:12:23.240 --> 3:12:31.840]  he passed away January 2007 and it's long been he's been a suspect for many
[3:12:31.840 --> 3:12:37.160]  many years that you had some involvement in the JFK assassination now
[3:12:37.160 --> 3:12:41.400]  everybody knows he Howard Hunt is being the co-conspirator the organizer of the
[3:12:41.400 --> 3:12:47.720]  Watergate break-in under President Nixon he worked as one of the plumbers which
[3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:52.360]  was Nixon's secret black ops team with Gordon Liddy they went around the
[3:12:52.360 --> 3:13:00.200]  country breaking and entering firebombing and all manner of illegal
[3:13:00.200 --> 3:13:05.720]  activities earlier in his career my father had been chief of psychological
[3:13:05.720 --> 3:13:12.840]  warfare during the Guatemalan the Guatemalan overthrow in 1954 of of our
[3:13:12.840 --> 3:13:21.280]  bends and later on in the early 60s he had he had handpicked the the members of
[3:13:21.280 --> 3:13:26.480]  the new president government presidential government for the Bay of Pigs he
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:31.200]  was involved in the in the Bay of Pigs which had which was a failed operation
[3:13:31.200 --> 3:13:37.040]  to overthrow Castro illegally of course this is just one of the many CIA up
[3:13:37.040 --> 3:13:42.760]  secret operations that the American public was not not privy to contract
[3:13:42.760 --> 3:13:49.600]  contrary to our Constitution which which allows for us to to to be in control of
[3:13:49.600 --> 3:13:56.040]  of this agency in fact we're not in control of this agency and later on at
[3:13:56.040 --> 3:14:01.520]  a very advanced stage my father confessed to me of his knowledge and his role in
[3:14:01.520 --> 3:14:07.640]  the assassination president John F. Kennedy now the things that he told me I
[3:14:07.640 --> 3:14:12.240]  I got an article that came out in Rolling Stone magazine that was how
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:15.600]  that's how the story broke and then Alex you were you were one of the first I
[3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:21.000]  think the first radio station to break this you know nationwide after the
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:30.120]  Rolling Stone story came out in April 2007 and basically what my father told
[3:14:30.120 --> 3:14:39.160]  me was that he was he was a benchwarmer in a group of of a contract CIA agents
[3:14:39.160 --> 3:14:49.000]  Cuban expatriates that were working under the protection of the CIA and of
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:54.200]  President Johnson and of the FBI to to assassinate President Kennedy because he
[3:14:54.200 --> 3:15:00.840]  was viewed as thoughts on communism he was viewed as being a danger to the the
[3:15:00.840 --> 3:15:06.840]  true and and secret desires of the military industrial complex way back in
[3:15:06.840 --> 3:15:13.200]  1963 so what's important about this this this little window of history here is
[3:15:13.200 --> 3:15:19.360]  that this I believe was the first the first stab at the American Constitution
[3:15:19.360 --> 3:15:24.040]  and the first time that the secret government really had had stepped in and
[3:15:24.040 --> 3:15:28.440]  taken control of this country in a in a well well carried out coup d'etat which
[3:15:28.440 --> 3:15:33.440]  my father was a part of in my book that as you mentioned has just come out as an
[3:15:33.440 --> 3:15:40.480]  e-book on my website stjohnhunt.com I supply all the all the handwritten
[3:15:40.480 --> 3:15:45.280]  memos and the photographs and the notes that my father wrote to me on his death
[3:15:45.280 --> 3:15:49.320]  bed in Miami Florida when he when I flew down there and he confessed his his
[3:15:49.320 --> 3:15:53.840]  knowledge and his involvement in the assassination president Kennedy so the
[3:15:53.840 --> 3:15:57.680]  reason this is important is because we all have to understand that this kind of
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:16:02.840]  stuff has been going on a long time it's going on today even bigger and worse
[3:16:02.840 --> 3:16:08.080]  than ever and it's it's thank God we have people like you Alex to bring out the
[3:16:08.080 --> 3:16:13.280]  truth and this is this book has been a shop at the you know to various
[3:16:13.280 --> 3:16:19.000]  publishers on the east coast of New York and people are just scared to to take
[3:16:19.000 --> 3:16:24.080]  this on but so I've I've went ahead and and published it as an e-book you
[3:16:24.080 --> 3:16:29.520]  which you can get on my website stjohnhunt.com well continuing I mean
[3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:33.080]  break down some of the things that are covered you know in the book and because
[3:16:33.080 --> 3:16:36.560]  this is amazing information you would think that the mainstream publishers
[3:16:36.560 --> 3:16:39.440]  want to publish it's a very well-written book I've read it a lot of other
[3:16:39.440 --> 3:16:43.200]  people did look at it the publishers are scared I mean this is smoking gun
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:48.520]  handwritten notes documents I mean this is really the key one of the biggest
[3:16:48.520 --> 3:16:52.200]  smoking guns ever there's been others this is kind of the coup de gras and
[3:16:52.200 --> 3:16:56.320]  no they won't touch it because they've got so much hinging on the myth and
[3:16:56.320 --> 3:17:00.880]  selling the myth that they told the story the truth about the JFK killing
[3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:05.120]  being a lone assassin I'm surprised they didn't say the Tooth Fairy editor that
[3:17:05.120 --> 3:17:09.080]  Kennedy bumped his head on the side of a car like they said Budo did when there's
[3:17:09.080 --> 3:17:13.560]  video of her being shot in Pakistan I mean you know they now they feed us even
[3:17:13.560 --> 3:17:17.160]  bigger lies but this is one of the big ones one of the big icons if not the
[3:17:17.160 --> 3:17:21.960]  biggest just as big as 9-11 in the psyche so that falls so many of the
[3:17:21.960 --> 3:17:27.240]  other dominos fall yeah this was really the first you know one of the one of
[3:17:27.240 --> 3:17:31.000]  the biggest lies that was fostered upon the American public and of course you
[3:17:31.000 --> 3:17:38.000]  know the mindset back in 1963 was you know we were still still a country whose
[3:17:38.000 --> 3:17:44.040]  citizens were rather innocent to this kind of internal intrigue and it was
[3:17:44.040 --> 3:17:49.280]  just it was just so natural for for for the New World Order government which I
[3:17:49.280 --> 3:17:54.880]  believe started back then to to step in and take control by assassinating
[3:17:54.880 --> 3:18:00.120]  President Kennedy and then putting in Lyndon Johnson my father I have in my
[3:18:00.120 --> 3:18:07.160]  book the detailed conversations that I had with my father I have photographs of
[3:18:07.160 --> 3:18:13.560]  the conspirators it's it's not a long book it's 131 pages but it's got a
[3:18:13.560 --> 3:18:20.840]  bounty of of memorandums and handwritten notes the photographs of the
[3:18:20.840 --> 3:18:25.680]  conspirators I have some personal family photographs in there of my father
[3:18:25.680 --> 3:18:32.280]  myself and our family different times of our lives but and it's also also very
[3:18:32.280 --> 3:18:39.200]  personal memoir about my relationship with my father and about my my my life
[3:18:39.200 --> 3:18:45.440]  long struggle to find the truth of my father because so starting him in 1970
[3:18:45.440 --> 3:18:51.120]  1971-72 when Watergate broke and my father was arrested for for his role
[3:18:51.120 --> 3:18:56.080]  he served 33 and a half months in federal penitentiary for that for his
[3:18:56.080 --> 3:19:00.320]  involvement as one of the co-conspirators in the Watergate break-in as well as
[3:19:00.320 --> 3:19:03.440]  as all the other things he'd done illegally for President Nixon at the
[3:19:03.440 --> 3:19:10.200]  time it was just shortly after that that I saw a poster on a telephone pole in
[3:19:10.200 --> 3:19:14.040]  Oakland California where I was living at the time with a picture of one of the
[3:19:14.040 --> 3:19:20.640]  tramps now the tramps for those of you who don't know were three supposed
[3:19:20.640 --> 3:19:25.280]  hobos that were arrested within minutes after the the assassination there in
[3:19:25.280 --> 3:19:31.000]  Dallas they were behind a a parking lot in a picket fence in a railroad yard
[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:37.040]  and they were discovered there and then they were paraded through downtown
[3:19:37.040 --> 3:19:42.240]  Dealey Plaza and taken booked and then released and all their records of their
[3:19:42.240 --> 3:19:46.680]  bookings were somehow lost or destroyed for the next 40 years
[3:19:46.680 --> 3:19:50.880]  all right say John Hunt we got to go to break we'll be right back and we will get

[3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:26.840]  even shows more evidence of how real this is all the things that have happened
[3:25:26.840 --> 3:25:32.680]  to you in the process. Yes just after I came out with this information or it
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:38.120]  when I was in the early stages of processing this information and I was
[3:25:38.120 --> 3:25:43.080]  making phone calls to Eric my friend Eric Kettigard from Rolling Stone
[3:25:43.080 --> 3:25:49.080]  magazine my house got broken into nothing of any value was stolen you know I
[3:25:49.080 --> 3:25:54.920]  have the TVs the DVD players the CDs you know money and things that was all
[3:25:54.920 --> 3:25:58.920]  left alone and what they went through was was all my files in my in my in my
[3:25:58.920 --> 3:26:04.640]  office all my paperwork had been gone through and you know the files are just
[3:26:04.640 --> 3:26:09.360]  strewn all over the room the the break-in looks like a professional job
[3:26:09.360 --> 3:26:12.880]  because there was no sign of there was no broken windows there was no damage to
[3:26:12.880 --> 3:26:20.040]  any the door jams it was to me obviously a very a very well planned and carried
[3:26:20.040 --> 3:26:25.760]  out break-in by people that do this kind of thing all the time later a few days
[3:26:25.760 --> 3:26:30.880]  after that I was I was run off the road on a very lonely stretch of of coastal
[3:26:30.880 --> 3:26:36.440]  a road near Eureka California a road called Samoa Samoa Boulevard that runs
[3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:42.480]  right alongside the the Pacific Ocean and that was pretty scary but I've
[3:26:42.480 --> 3:26:47.120]  always felt strongly that that this information I have is of extreme
[3:26:47.120 --> 3:26:51.320]  importance historically and very significant and very relevant even
[3:26:51.320 --> 3:26:58.160]  even today 45 years later what I have to offer in in my book is a detailed
[3:26:58.160 --> 3:27:02.920]  account what I put together from all of my father's conversations from the tape
[3:27:02.920 --> 3:27:08.200]  recording he sent me where he where you can also you can hear this this recording
[3:27:08.200 --> 3:27:11.240]  of his voice on my website there's a link there you can click it and you'll
[3:27:11.240 --> 3:27:18.000]  hear my my father in his own real voice confessing his involvement and and and
[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:21.440]  some of the key players in the assassination now you know people of
[3:27:21.440 --> 3:27:28.240]  all thought that the assassination of JFK was a huge conspiracy and how could
[3:27:28.240 --> 3:27:33.080]  this conspiracy involve so many people well it it really didn't in the in the
[3:27:33.080 --> 3:27:39.040]  in the 50s and 60s there was an elite group of CIA officers that headed a
[3:27:39.040 --> 3:27:44.680]  very secret black operation section called the executive action committee
[3:27:44.680 --> 3:27:48.840]  and the executive action was a euphemism for or the assassination of
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:53.280]  unfriendly foreign leaders and the people that were involved in this were
[3:27:53.280 --> 3:27:58.360]  cord mire he was a chief of station of Great Britain he also hate personally
[3:27:58.360 --> 3:28:03.760]  hated Kennedy because his ex-wife had been a mistress to JFK for many years
[3:28:03.760 --> 3:28:07.000]  cord mire was also the handler we have the national security documents of the
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:12.280]  Clintons oh really yeah when they were I mean they were going to Oxford yeah yeah
[3:28:12.280 --> 3:28:20.360]  Bill Harvey was also one of the chief operatives chief chief operatives for
[3:28:20.360 --> 3:28:26.240]  the for the executive action black op operations to assassinate unfriendly
[3:28:26.240 --> 3:28:31.840]  foreign leaders he was stationed over in Italy in Rome and he there's a memo
[3:28:31.840 --> 3:28:39.200]  that has surfaced from a bill Harvey to his CIA bosses the suggesting that they
[3:28:39.200 --> 3:28:43.400]  use Corsican hit men for any any assassination of foreign leaders rather
[3:28:43.400 --> 3:28:47.800]  than using the American Mafia well they always use go-betweens they always use
[3:28:47.800 --> 3:28:52.000]  so they have the plausible denonability and degrees of separation between each
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:57.000]  envelope that's right and and these were the these were an elite group of CIA
[3:28:57.000 --> 3:29:00.880]  operatives that were very familiar with how to put assassinations together how
[3:29:00.880 --> 3:29:04.840]  to carry them out and how to cover their tracks or cover their asses after the
[3:29:04.840 --> 3:29:10.520]  assassination nation was over on Tony of a sienna was the vicious leader of
[3:29:10.520 --> 3:29:15.840]  Vanty Castro alpha 66 who worked as a contract agent for the CIA he was

[3:35:01.560 --> 3:35:05.480]  gonna be big and the time we have left with St. John Hunt on having back up
[3:35:05.480 --> 3:35:08.360]  next week if you can do it for a full hour to take your calls because I love
[3:35:08.360 --> 3:35:12.320]  the different directions callers take us in the last five six minutes we've got
[3:35:12.320 --> 3:35:18.080]  left St. John other key points you want to make well some of the key points
[3:35:18.080 --> 3:35:25.120]  covered in my book are the the handwritten memo that my that that includes
[3:35:25.120 --> 3:35:31.000]  the admission finally that my father wrote down that he and Frank Sturgis had
[3:35:31.000 --> 3:35:34.920]  been lifelong friends now this is key because he'd always maintained that he
[3:35:34.920 --> 3:35:39.640]  never met Frank Sturgis until the until he put together the crew for the
[3:35:39.640 --> 3:35:44.400]  Watergate break-in now why this is important is because Frank Sturgis and
[3:35:44.400 --> 3:35:50.120]  my father were were accused of being a two of the three Tramson Dealey Plaza and
[3:35:50.120 --> 3:35:54.680]  of course my father denied his entire life that he ever knew Frank Sturgis
[3:35:54.680 --> 3:35:58.280]  until the 70s will daily Plaza of course was a Kennedy assassination that was in
[3:35:58.280 --> 3:36:02.960]  63 and now in this book I I reveal in a handwritten memo that that in fact my
[3:36:02.960 --> 3:36:07.920]  father did finally admit that he had known Frank Sturgis during that time so
[3:36:07.920 --> 3:36:13.440]  that that's this this book just chips away a little bit more at the conspiracy
[3:36:13.440 --> 3:36:18.800]  I don't claim to have figured the entire are you kidding chips away yeah it
[3:36:18.800 --> 3:36:22.000]  isn't just that your book or your father's audio or videotapes no I've
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:25.280]  seen the video we've got it we're gonna put a little clip out soon but I keep
[3:36:25.280 --> 3:36:29.160]  meaning to we're just so busy yeah Alex I want to make available to you the
[3:36:29.160 --> 3:36:34.800]  entire 10 hours which I have down I have available I'll make that available to
[3:36:34.800 --> 3:36:39.000]  you to do what you want well as soon as September's over all we're working on
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:42.960]  is the JFK thing we're working on it some now but Burma's got us to help him
[3:36:42.960 --> 3:36:46.080]  with his film and that's got to be done for September 1st so it's everything's
[3:36:46.080 --> 3:36:49.800]  insane but you we're gonna send Rob out there for a week with you that's okay
[3:36:49.800 --> 3:36:53.960]  to interview you get copies of all this you know interview you there in
[3:36:53.960 --> 3:36:56.640]  Northern California and we got some other interviews we're gonna do so
[3:36:56.640 --> 3:37:01.520]  absolutely okay but I mean I mean you say it chips away a little bit this is
[3:37:01.520 --> 3:37:07.720]  bombshell info well it really is but you know on the on the broader scale in
[3:37:07.720 --> 3:37:12.760]  the larger scale the the JFK conspiracy is is just a part of the in of the entire
[3:37:12.760 --> 3:37:20.320]  conspiracy of the New World Order to a dupe the American public and to to
[3:37:20.320 --> 3:37:25.440]  basically rob us of our of our of our rights and to establish martial law which
[3:37:25.440 --> 3:37:30.800]  were just a hair's breath away from well it's the same crew and then you look at
[3:37:30.800 --> 3:37:35.120]  the the presidents and people that come after and the heads of the CIA and the
[3:37:35.120 --> 3:37:39.160]  heads of Congress are the people involved in running the black off that day
[3:37:39.160 --> 3:37:45.320]  in D. Lee Plaza back in 1963 so it is just a repeat over and over again of the
[3:37:45.320 --> 3:37:49.480]  same nightmare it's like Groundhog Day or something and it's just we have to put
[3:37:49.480 --> 3:37:53.400]  an end to it it has to stop and I mentioned that Rick Linklater showed
[3:37:53.400 --> 3:37:59.200]  some of my films to you know the diehard star Bruce Willis and he went from
[3:37:59.200 --> 3:38:03.320]  being a neocon follower to now I told you before it was in Vanity Fair he came
[3:38:03.320 --> 3:38:06.720]  out and said yeah the same people that killed Kennedy are involved in you know
[3:38:06.720 --> 3:38:10.720]  running things today in 9-11 so there it was confirmed behind the scenes Bruce
[3:38:10.720 --> 3:38:14.240]  Willis had woken up the neocons freaked out and tried to deny it and said we
[3:38:14.240 --> 3:38:17.200]  talked to one of Bruce Willis's friends he says that's not the case but then he
[3:38:17.200 --> 3:38:20.320]  did interview with Vanity Fair haven't even tried to get Bruce Willis on you
[3:38:20.320 --> 3:38:24.960]  know what remind me I want to get Willis on and see how folks like that oh man it
[3:38:24.960 --> 3:38:29.360]  well it's just it people say that we always have mixed stars on here most
[3:38:29.360 --> 3:38:32.880]  the time Charlie Sheen you name it they come to us which is great they want to
[3:38:32.880 --> 3:38:35.880]  speak out and then it gets the big attention it doesn't isn't because they
[3:38:35.880 --> 3:38:39.320]  think there's important it's because they understand that that will get media
[3:38:39.320 --> 3:38:44.400]  attention and they are important because they have courage well St. John I just

[3:39:28.240 --> 3:39:31.840]  call in here but we'll see what goes on while we're doing they go ahead and
[3:39:31.840 --> 3:39:36.160]  play a few minutes of the clip of him he put out yesterday on YouTube we have a
[3:39:36.160 --> 3:39:40.040]  link to it on info wars.com calling for people to support him and explaining why
[3:39:40.040 --> 3:39:45.560]  he's taking this bold step here it is I want to thank you for the support which
[3:39:45.560 --> 3:39:50.280]  you have given to my efforts to hold this administration accountable for
[3:39:50.280 --> 3:39:56.680]  taking us into a war based on lies and for the destruction of the rule of law
[3:39:56.680 --> 3:40:02.280]  and the destruction of cherished constitutional principles because of
[3:40:02.280 --> 3:40:09.760]  your support this Friday in Washington DC I will make a presentation before the
[3:40:09.760 --> 3:40:14.120]  Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives at which time I will
[3:40:14.120 --> 3:40:19.960]  make the case that this president has violated his oath of office violated
[3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:26.800]  United States law and international law has separated our nation from our
[3:40:26.800 --> 3:40:32.920]  Constitution and has taken us on a course that has been so profoundly
[3:40:32.920 --> 3:40:40.120]  anti-democratic that it has threatened the core of our nation because of your
[3:40:40.120 --> 3:40:51.120]  support I've been able to advance this series of matters right to the table of
[3:40:51.120 --> 3:40:59.960]  the Judiciary Committee because of your support I've been able to create an
[3:40:59.960 --> 3:41:07.680]  opening we were finally getting a chance in Washington to discuss the abuses of
[3:41:07.680 --> 3:41:16.160]  power to discuss the war based on lies to discuss the whole
[3:41:16.360 --> 3:41:22.720]  architecture he's here Jones of constitutional principles that have
[3:41:22.720 --> 3:41:26.520]  been taken down
[3:41:26.520 --> 3:41:37.400]  every serious matter that faces the people of this country today can be
[3:41:37.400 --> 3:41:44.360]  linked to an administration which is not accountable for example the price of
[3:41:44.360 --> 3:41:51.800]  gasoline you know that vice president Cheney with the permission and blessing
[3:41:51.800 --> 3:42:00.560]  of president Bush held secret meetings with leaders of the oil industry where
[3:42:00.560 --> 3:42:08.920]  they laid out maps of Iraq far in advance of the attack on Iraq you know and I
[3:42:08.920 --> 3:42:15.080]  know the war was about oil and if we can force the vice president of the United
[3:42:15.080 --> 3:42:20.320]  States to have to testify we can get the information that's necessary to be able
[3:42:20.320 --> 3:42:29.040]  to prove that not only has US law been violated but that the public trust has
[3:42:29.040 --> 3:42:33.920]  been under a continuous assault by an alliance between the White House and
[3:42:33.920 --> 3:42:39.880]  the oil companies okay look at the sub ladies and gentlemen you can watch the
[3:42:39.880 --> 3:42:43.640]  rest of him eloquently lay it out on his congressional website they have links to
[3:42:43.640 --> 3:42:46.760]  it up on info wars.com now I want to be clear we only have him for a little
[3:42:46.760 --> 3:42:51.320]  while Congressman Kucinich I got Willie Nelson on the show today I called him
[3:42:51.320 --> 3:42:54.600]  and said anyone come on and support mr. Kucinich's impeachment he said
[3:42:54.600 --> 3:42:58.080]  absolutely let's do it today and I'm getting a lot of other prominent people
[3:42:58.080 --> 3:43:03.200]  Ron Paul on tomorrow though his plane almost went down yesterday he's gonna
[3:43:03.200 --> 3:43:07.320]  be on tomorrow talking about it some other issues so I'm trying myself in my
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:11.240]  own little way to get as much heat on the Judiciary Committee as we can and
[3:43:11.240 --> 3:43:16.480]  congressman very brave man our champion up there right now leading the pack in
[3:43:16.480 --> 3:43:20.400]  the fight against tyranny how do we support you sir well I think you're
[3:43:20.400 --> 3:43:24.120]  already doing it in getting people involved to sign a petition but you know
[3:43:24.120 --> 3:43:28.120]  this goes a little bit further that the best defense of a country is an informed
[3:43:28.120 --> 3:43:34.440]  citizenry so people should read the articles and and if there's anything I
[3:43:34.440 --> 3:43:39.880]  missed in the 35 articles I'd be happy to hear from people and furthermore if
[3:43:39.880 --> 3:43:46.480]  there's if we have discussions around the country on this if people start
[3:43:46.480 --> 3:43:49.720]  getting together in groups and talk and have a have a discussion of
[3:43:49.720 --> 3:43:54.040]  constitutional caucuses going on everywhere where people talk about what's
[3:43:54.040 --> 3:43:57.120]  the meaning of the Constitution why should someone who's president of the
[3:43:57.120 --> 3:44:01.800]  United States be held accountable to law what happens when there are untruths
[3:44:01.800 --> 3:44:05.680]  told in the democracy that result in war what are the consequences we need a
[3:44:05.680 --> 3:44:08.360]  discussion about this because it because the discussion will increase
[3:44:08.360 --> 3:44:13.240]  awareness and increase awareness will help protect our country from tyranny
[3:44:13.240 --> 3:44:18.280]  absolutely sir can you go over the process and what we're going to be seeing
[3:44:18.280 --> 3:44:26.400]  Friday I'm you know first of all I want to say that to you Alex Jones that you
[3:44:26.400 --> 3:44:29.840]  are one of the people who has been keeping the public informed to the point
[3:44:29.840 --> 3:44:33.200]  where we've had such a public outcry that the hearings have been brought
[3:44:33.200 --> 3:44:36.360]  forward I don't know that it could have happened without you I really mean that
[3:44:36.360 --> 3:44:41.080]  because it's like unless we get people who who are really demanding that an
[3:44:41.080 --> 3:44:45.960]  airing of these charges be held it wouldn't happen so to on Friday what's
[3:44:45.960 --> 3:44:53.480]  going to happen is this I will present the articles to the committee and talk
[3:44:53.480 --> 3:44:59.240]  about why I believe the committee should move to a formal hearing and of course
[3:44:59.240 --> 3:45:06.160]  with with taking testimony under oath of of both the president and the vice
[3:45:06.160 --> 3:45:11.040]  president I think it's really important for the American people to know once and
[3:45:11.040 --> 3:45:15.040]  for all if in fact there were deliberately lot different deliberate
[3:45:15.040 --> 3:45:20.360]  lies told that took this country into war we know now that Iraq had no weapons
[3:45:20.360 --> 3:45:25.320]  of mass destruction but people knew back then in August in October of 2002 that
[3:45:25.320 --> 3:45:29.200]  Iraq didn't have the weapons they knew that Iraq wasn't a threat they knew that
[3:45:29.200 --> 3:45:31.760]  Iraq didn't have the intention or capability of attacking the United
[3:45:31.760 --> 3:45:35.840]  States had nothing to do with 9-11 or okay this role in 9-11 and yet they
[3:45:35.840 --> 3:45:39.880]  led the people of the United States and led the Congress in particular to believe
[3:45:39.880 --> 3:45:44.160]  otherwise and this to me constitutes a grave offense and this is one of the
[3:45:44.160 --> 3:45:48.800]  primary reasons why I'm I push this right to the point of where we finally
[3:45:48.800 --> 3:45:52.960]  opened up the doors to the Judiciary Committee and at which time I'm going to
[3:45:52.960 --> 3:45:58.600]  be putting on the table something that everyone said was off the table
[3:45:58.600 --> 3:46:01.960]  articles of impeachment well we're looking at several major issues here
[3:46:01.960 --> 3:46:05.080]  and I'd like you to quickly as you can address those in the time we have
[3:46:05.080 --> 3:46:08.920]  congressman Kucinich who needs to be in all our prayers ladies and gentlemen
[3:46:08.920 --> 3:46:13.440]  this is very dangerous what he's doing needless to say we all need to be
[3:46:13.440 --> 3:46:16.880]  supporting him right now with phone calls letters to the Judiciary Committee to
[3:46:16.880 --> 3:46:21.880]  their congressmen and women to the media a the media is involved in a huge
[3:46:21.880 --> 3:46:26.840]  cover-up of this other than maybe Keith Oberman mentioning it a little bit how
[3:46:26.840 --> 3:46:30.680]  do we force the mainstream media I mean this this is thousands of times what
[3:46:30.680 --> 3:46:34.960]  Nixon did and that got major attention and rightfully so there is almost a news
[3:46:34.960 --> 3:46:40.040]  blackout on what's happening that's first and then secondarily we must bring
[3:46:40.040 --> 3:46:43.320]  them to justice because they're getting ready to commit more crimes with the
[3:46:43.320 --> 3:46:46.200]  attack on Iran they've got their talking points out the word is from
[3:46:46.200 --> 3:46:49.640]  congressman Paul and others and CIA people we know they are gonna hit in
[3:46:49.640 --> 3:46:57.080]  October or September maybe after if if they think McCain's gonna be elected so
[3:46:57.080 --> 3:47:00.960]  we're also looking at them committing new crimes that may dwarf the previous
[3:47:00.960 --> 3:47:05.200]  ones can you speak to both those points well you know as I hear you speak and
[3:47:05.200 --> 3:47:12.080]  and I really get chills because I realize the danger that our country's in
[3:47:12.080 --> 3:47:17.560]  right now and not only are we in one war based on on manufactured
[3:47:17.560 --> 3:47:23.080]  representations but we are headed towards another your listeners right now
[3:47:23.080 --> 3:47:27.160]  have a lot of power and here's what you can do get on a phone today and demand
[3:47:27.160 --> 3:47:33.680]  that people cover this judiciary committee hearing on Friday you know
[3:47:33.680 --> 3:47:37.920]  it's not as though the media exists in a vacuum they exist because people watch
[3:47:37.920 --> 3:47:44.120]  them or listen to them and if anyone's listening right now and there's a show
[3:47:44.120 --> 3:47:49.200]  that you tend to watch whether it's on the big networks or on the cable
[3:47:49.200 --> 3:47:55.400]  networks call them call them today call them tomorrow tell them there's a
[3:47:55.400 --> 3:47:59.960]  judiciary committee hearing on Friday in Washington at which time executive
[3:47:59.960 --> 3:48:04.440]  abuse of power is going to be discussed and at which time
[3:48:04.440 --> 3:48:10.520]  congressman percentage will be making a presentation regarding the
[3:48:10.520 --> 3:48:14.960]  article's impeachment and you think it's important that you the listener think
[3:48:14.960 --> 3:48:17.800]  it's important well imagine ladies and gentlemen I want your take on this
[3:48:17.800 --> 3:48:21.680]  congressman how could it not be on every news channel how could it not be
[3:48:21.680 --> 3:48:26.840]  preempting the soap operas I mean this is huge news they admit they committed
[3:48:26.840 --> 3:48:31.280]  these felonies there's no debating it from torture to lying about WMD's
[3:48:31.280 --> 3:48:36.600]  premeditated the list goes on and on 35 of these that are open and shut I mean
[3:48:36.600 --> 3:48:40.080]  we better see this on television right now it looks like we're not going to be
[3:48:40.080 --> 3:48:45.880]  unless it's a span well you know this is something that is really depends on the
[3:48:45.880 --> 3:48:49.320]  people and if the people have a strong enough outcry I think you can create
[3:48:49.320 --> 3:48:53.720]  something that will be different than what the networks are currently planning
[3:48:53.720 --> 3:48:56.800]  congressman how are you able to even get it to this point I mean they were
[3:48:56.800 --> 3:49:02.800]  saying that couldn't be done and you've done that I'll say it again Alex you're
[3:49:02.800 --> 3:49:06.400]  one of the people with it with your listeners who have helped to raise public
[3:49:06.400 --> 3:49:11.320]  awareness to the point of where I think the speaker had to understand that
[3:49:11.320 --> 3:49:15.400]  there and there needed to be an airing whether or not it would be a formal
[3:49:15.400 --> 3:49:19.120]  hearing only on the impeachment articles I think you know the fact that we're
[3:49:19.120 --> 3:49:23.840]  able to open the door is a big event and it gives us for the first time a chance
[3:49:23.840 --> 3:49:28.120]  to talk about impeachment in front of a congressional committee I think that it
[3:49:28.120 --> 3:49:31.960]  happened because of the people because everyone started to get involved and you
[3:49:31.960 --> 3:49:35.240]  know that gave me a great deal of encouragement to hang in there but
[3:49:35.240 --> 3:49:38.480]  there's a lot of people out there you know we've had close to 50,000 people
[3:49:38.480 --> 3:49:45.800]  sign that petition and we have more people who are giving sending I just got a
[3:49:45.800 --> 3:49:50.720]  box of petition just a full box that weighs about 25 pounds of petitions from
[3:49:50.720 --> 3:49:55.080]  all over the country people who are demanding that the house take action
[3:49:55.080 --> 3:49:57.960]  how do folks sign the petition they can go to your website can't they
[3:49:57.960 --> 3:50:02.160]  yeah I have a I have a website that I think you already have been talking
[3:50:02.160 --> 3:50:08.160]  about and I but again please call the media and tell them that they ought to be
[3:50:08.160 --> 3:50:12.400]  covering this because this is a matter of public interest and you know at last
[3:50:12.400 --> 3:50:16.960]  this is about our Constitution this is about whether or not we can we stay a
[3:50:16.960 --> 3:50:22.240]  republic and whether or not we have principles that are bedrock principles
[3:50:22.240 --> 3:50:27.800]  that protect our freedoms our freedoms are on the line you cannot stay a free
[3:50:27.800 --> 3:50:33.160]  nation if a government will go to war based on lies and will will raise the
[3:50:33.160 --> 3:50:38.000]  budgets of of a military to the point of where there's isn't room for anything
[3:50:38.000 --> 3:50:42.360]  else and just keep building and it's not based on the truth you know we all will
[3:50:42.360 --> 3:50:46.880]  defend our country in a moment of need it's a responsibility we have but but
[3:50:46.880 --> 3:50:52.440]  but woe to that person who tells the American people and our soldiers that
[3:50:52.440 --> 3:50:56.480]  they got to go to war and if an effect is they misrepresent the case for the
[3:50:56.480 --> 3:51:01.960]  war woe to those people and that's why I brought forward those articles well
[3:51:01.960 --> 3:51:08.120]  congressman we'll be watching what time is this scheduled for on Friday I've
[3:51:08.120 --> 3:51:14.800]  been told 10 o'clock is when the committee will start so again I am so
[3:51:14.800 --> 3:51:20.840]  grateful for the Alex Jones show because you you know great Americans I'm also
[3:51:20.840 --> 3:51:25.360]  grateful that mr. Paul was okay I saw him on the floor of the house today and you
[3:51:25.360 --> 3:51:28.560]  know he's a very cool hand and he said as a former flight surgeon he kind of
[3:51:28.560 --> 3:51:32.160]  understood what happened when there was a decompression but I'm glad he was okay
[3:51:32.160 --> 3:51:34.880]  because when I heard that some of my colleagues that were on a plane it was in
[3:51:34.880 --> 3:51:40.720]  trouble let me tell you it gave me a lot of pause but he's okay and I'm looking
[3:51:40.720 --> 3:51:44.600]  forward to working with him not only reclaim our civil liberties but to stop
[3:51:44.600 --> 3:51:50.120]  a war against Iran congressman in closing I know you're a busy man I'd like to
[3:51:50.120 --> 3:51:54.320]  try to get an update next week on what happened Friday from you or from one of
[3:51:54.320 --> 3:51:58.920]  your aides but in call me let's talk okay I'll get back in any time okay well
[3:51:58.920 --> 3:52:02.540]  we're accelerating towards the Iran situation we're gonna support the
[3:52:02.540 --> 3:52:06.160]  impeachment hopefully it's gonna go somewhere I mean if we can get this out
[3:52:06.160 --> 3:52:09.680]  in front of the people it could certainly be a way of short circuiting the
[3:52:09.680 --> 3:52:14.360]  attack but but but looking forward into that do you think currently they really
[3:52:14.360 --> 3:52:20.720]  are still planning to go into Iran or to bomb Iran yes I mean all the signs that
[3:52:20.720 --> 3:52:25.760]  we're seeing would point to that there was a very important column in the
[3:52:25.760 --> 3:52:32.360]  New York Times last week by Benny Morris who is a professor in of Middle East
[3:52:32.360 --> 3:52:38.800]  studies and it was out of Jerusalem and he really more than anything identified
[3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:45.120]  that the period between the inauguration and the not the inauguration
[3:52:45.120 --> 3:52:50.920]  between the election and the inauguration of the president is the period to
[3:52:50.920 --> 3:52:55.840]  keep an eye on for a possible attack well and we know that there are people in
[3:52:55.840 --> 3:52:59.440]  Israel who are pushing it but we also know that there are people in the US
[3:52:59.440 --> 3:53:03.920]  government are pushing it and we have to push back in the cause of peace and
[3:53:03.920 --> 3:53:09.720]  justice and I'm always hopeful that the American people given the facts and having
[3:53:09.720 --> 3:53:15.760]  awareness will stand up and and defend the Constitution and stop aggressive
[3:53:15.760 --> 3:53:21.680]  war and stop the catastrophe from being visited on on the world okay
[3:53:21.680 --> 3:53:26.760]  congressman the website is cosignage.house.gov well that's my I have
[3:53:26.760 --> 3:53:29.680]  to you know that's my government website and then of course I have the
[3:53:29.680 --> 3:53:34.840]  personal one which I think you have yes do you have that one I've plugged
[3:53:34.840 --> 3:53:38.400]  several there was also the consent for president one which one should we plug
[3:53:38.400 --> 3:53:41.320]  well it's it's you know I'm just letting you know I have a number of
[3:53:41.320 --> 3:53:44.760]  different websites one is the one on the government site that you've identified
[3:53:44.760 --> 3:53:48.040]  yes and I have another campaign one I can't tell you this on the phone that
[3:53:48.040 --> 3:53:51.720]  I'm on but if you check what I do have a campaign website that you ought to check
[3:53:51.720 --> 3:53:56.280]  the ridiculous campaign rules I'm careful all the time just so you know
[3:53:56.280 --> 3:53:59.360]  absolutely well there's I mean there's so many of these websites what I'll do is
[3:53:59.360 --> 3:54:03.360]  before the show ends I will I will plug all those but just Google Dennis
[3:54:03.360 --> 3:54:08.560]  cosignage and you can find them all there congressman thank you for everything I
