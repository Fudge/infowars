[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:33.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.080 --> 00:41.560]  ladies and gentlemen we are live it is Monday October 17th 2011 and I am
[00:41.560 --> 00:48.680]  coming to you from just a couple miles just two miles or so from the Texas
[00:48.680 --> 00:54.480]  Mexico border I have been down here spending time with my family for a few
[00:54.480 --> 01:00.320]  days on a working and I mean working seven days a week vacation we are
[01:00.320 --> 01:08.280]  returning to Austin tomorrow I have engaged in a investigation talking to
[01:08.280 --> 01:13.560]  locals ferreting out information and we've confirmed that they have
[01:13.560 --> 01:19.760]  continuity of government homeland security ice FEMA facilities here in the
[01:19.760 --> 01:26.760]  area that we've actually gotten some footage of we also in the middle of
[01:26.760 --> 01:32.880]  being here there's been a huge red tide fish die-off that's made news here in
[01:32.880 --> 01:38.760]  the area this is such an incredibly such an incredibly important broadcast that
[01:38.760 --> 01:43.960]  we're going to have for you here today there is a local paper with the red
[01:43.960 --> 01:51.680]  tide and what's happening with that of course all of that quite frankly pales
[01:51.680 --> 01:57.280]  in significance to the main news and I'm going to get to when we come back from
[01:57.280 --> 02:04.400]  break we've got a constellation of big news stories we're looking at I don't
[02:04.400 --> 02:08.160]  have words who describe the magnitude of what's happening not just on the Texas
[02:08.160 --> 02:12.280]  border with Mexico or the Arizona border with Mexico or the California border
[02:12.280 --> 02:19.040]  with Mexico but how the phony drug war is basically totally corrupting and
[02:19.040 --> 02:23.840]  bringing down not just Mexico but the United States and the type of gangster
[02:23.840 --> 02:30.040]  government we have and the incredible state of fear down here with the
[02:30.040 --> 02:34.640]  population who are Americans whether they're white Hispanic black Asian you
[02:34.640 --> 02:40.280]  talk to people with blonde hair blue eyes with last names like Johnson and
[02:40.280 --> 02:45.320]  they're scared to talk you talk to the Hispanic folks down here who are
[02:45.320 --> 02:50.000]  Americans they're scared to death but I have had a chance to talk to people
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.920]  connected inside these different FEMA homeland security facilities but that's
[02:55.920 --> 03:00.240]  really a side issue that we'll be covering more dealing with the total
[03:00.240 --> 03:07.320]  state of fear and a Mexican drug cartel shootout with the Mexican army inside
[03:07.320 --> 03:13.160]  the United States just a few hundred yards away from the junior varsity
[03:13.160 --> 03:18.520]  football team and the media here will not report it you know three weeks ago
[03:18.520 --> 03:25.480]  the local editor this was buried in the news it was all people that did something
[03:25.480 --> 03:29.560]  on Twitter were killed no it was the local administrative editor of the
[03:29.560 --> 03:40.600]  Nueva Laredo major newspaper and again I am very close to Brownsville and the
[03:40.600 --> 03:44.800]  Brownsville papers won't report on this the Rio Grande City papers will not
[03:44.800 --> 03:49.320]  report on it and the reporters have been told there and the TV reporters have
[03:49.320 --> 03:53.600]  been told if they talk about the Mexican trips that are all over the place
[03:53.600 --> 03:58.160]  remember a few years ago we report on Mexican trips inside Texas robbing
[03:58.160 --> 04:03.520]  police pulling police over Mexican army vehicles pulling them over in one case
[04:03.520 --> 04:07.920]  six miles inside the US I actually had the sheriff on from the Texas County at
[04:07.920 --> 04:13.040]  that time near here and they pulled them over and so we're gonna kill you if you
[04:13.040 --> 04:16.840]  talk about it and they took the drugs the truck of marijuana that they'd
[04:16.840 --> 04:22.000]  seized back from them here they've told the reporters that they're gonna kill
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.640]  them this is inside the US if they report on it so there's huge shootouts
[04:26.640 --> 04:31.560]  there's been truck bombs and car bombs down here in the last few months not on
[04:31.560 --> 04:37.400]  the news but don't worry the US cops are pulling over citizens writing them
[04:37.400 --> 04:41.200]  tickets for going five miles over the speed limit squeezing the slaves but
[04:41.200 --> 04:45.600]  the police around here literally walk around with giant spots of urine on
[04:45.600 --> 04:50.040]  their pants when it comes to the Mexican cartels in the Mexican military I mean
[04:50.040 --> 04:54.680]  just just unbelievable we'll be right back with all of this and a lot more the

[08:22.480 --> 08:27.240]  next three hours we have a completely jam-packed and incredibly important
[08:27.240 --> 08:33.160]  transmission lined up for you today number one Obama has come out and
[08:33.160 --> 08:38.440]  endorsed the Occupy Wall Street people show as the fellow deserve there are
[08:38.440 --> 08:42.840]  new endorsements by the establishment move on dot org admits from the
[08:42.840 --> 08:46.440]  beginning they've been basically trying to take it over in many cases they've
[08:46.440 --> 08:53.080]  been successful all over the country Ron Paul in the Fed signs my own crew and
[08:53.080 --> 08:58.840]  Austin and others like Matt Medina and San Antonio people in New York DC they're
[08:58.840 --> 09:04.560]  told not welcome basically all that's welcome is a call for bigger taxes on
[09:04.560 --> 09:09.920]  the middle class wealth transference Obama is clearly engaging in class
[09:09.920 --> 09:15.720]  warfare and the usual suspects people that endorsed Obama during his campaign
[09:15.720 --> 09:24.080]  many of which that poses so-called anti-patriot that poses anti-New World
[09:24.080 --> 09:28.760]  Order people who are really anti-patriot who endorsed Obama and then claimed oh
[09:28.760 --> 09:35.280]  yeah we now know Obama was really bad they are out there now saying how dare
[09:35.280 --> 09:41.240]  anyone not say that Occupy Wall Street is as pure as the driven snow yes we know
[09:41.240 --> 09:45.920]  that there are corrupt elements in Wall Street but to just ignore the Federal
[09:45.920 --> 09:51.520]  Reserve like Michael Moore has done to ignore the Federal Reserve like Sean
[09:51.520 --> 09:56.600]  Penn has done and to simply make it a tea party against Occupy Wall Street
[09:56.600 --> 10:00.120]  movement and that's now in the news today that's what they're basically doing
[10:00.120 --> 10:04.920]  they're making opposition to the New World Order opposition to the megabanks
[10:04.920 --> 10:14.480]  either anti tea party or anti Occupy Wall Street which both of which the
[10:14.480 --> 10:22.520]  Republicans and Democrats have tried to take over respectively again it's good
[10:22.520 --> 10:26.920]  to protest the corruption on Wall Street the crony capitalism all the things
[10:26.920 --> 10:32.080]  that have been happening but when Obama starts endorsing it clearly that's an
[10:32.080 --> 10:40.600]  attempt to fully take it over George Soros and his anti-patriot anti-America
[10:40.600 --> 10:46.720]  ongoing activity is attempting to forge a color revolution knowing that this
[10:46.720 --> 10:50.320]  country is on the verge of revolution against the private Federal Reserve
[10:50.320 --> 10:56.840]  system the private Federal Reserve Warren Buffett Barack Obama all of the
[10:56.840 --> 11:02.240]  usual suspects Hillary Clinton have come out and endorsed Occupy Wall Street and
[11:02.240 --> 11:06.480]  they've had their operatives there on the ground since day one now I'll get into
[11:06.480 --> 11:11.560]  the big news here in a moment on Iran on the Mexican drug cartels on all of it
[11:11.560 --> 11:15.920]  but first I want to finish up with this this is the history of what happened
[11:15.920 --> 11:21.640]  four weeks into this if you go back a couple months ago ad busters which speak
[11:21.640 --> 11:26.160]  out against out of control consumerism and stuff like that and I see their
[11:26.160 --> 11:31.880]  point but their solution is basically a type of collectivism and they've been
[11:31.880 --> 11:36.320]  big Democratic Party establishment supporters and that's on record that
[11:36.320 --> 11:41.440]  group and others put out the idea to occupy Wall Street in October off of the
[11:41.440 --> 11:48.720]  model of the October Revolution in 1917 in Russia now people heard about this in
[11:48.720 --> 11:52.000]  the grassroots and through cyberspace and through Twitter they showed up
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.800]  because they're angry about their student loans they're angry about the
[11:54.800 --> 11:58.960]  banker bailouts they're angry about the robo signing and Bank of America and all
[11:58.960 --> 12:03.280]  this corruption so a lot of well-meaning people show up saying yeah now is the
[12:03.280 --> 12:08.280]  time to do something and then from day one it's it's a grassroots thing that
[12:08.280 --> 12:15.800]  that that listened to the call of the establishment George Soros system to come
[12:15.800 --> 12:20.120]  out against Wall Street then they show up they are grassroots but they listen to
[12:20.120 --> 12:25.760]  the siren call the Pied Piper call of the Obama people wanting to control the
[12:25.760 --> 12:31.280]  revolution by triggering it themselves once the occupy Wall Street people
[12:31.280 --> 12:37.960]  showed up there on scene once they were in place then the operatives came in and
[12:37.960 --> 12:42.320]  said this is not political to make sure tea party people or Ron Paul folks or
[12:42.320 --> 12:47.520]  anti-globalists couldn't get a foothold and actually wake up the kind of
[12:47.520 --> 12:51.080]  newbies to politics that were you know for the first time kind of like the tea
[12:51.080 --> 12:55.520]  party showing up in the streets here comes the Democrats to take it over just
[12:55.520 --> 13:00.040]  like the Republicans tried and in many respects failed but other respects
[13:00.040 --> 13:08.400]  succeeded in taking over the tea party and so now we have Obama coming out and
[13:08.400 --> 13:14.760]  saying I agree with you it's the wealth disparity it's it's it's the 99% and I'm
[13:14.760 --> 13:25.200]  gonna help you go after the 1% we are all in the 99 together when Barack Obama
[13:25.200 --> 13:31.560]  is completely and totally and has always been completely and totally financed
[13:31.560 --> 13:36.400]  like no president in history by the most corrupt elements of Wall Street the big
[13:36.400 --> 13:42.600]  six megabanks and brokerage firms Bank of America Goldman Sachs and others
[13:42.600 --> 13:46.960]  there's no debating that fact his entire administration filled with these
[13:46.960 --> 13:51.040]  people stealing tens of trillions of dollars continuing the exact same
[13:51.040 --> 13:56.800]  policies of Bush run by the very same Wall Street bosses the Henry Paul
[13:56.800 --> 14:01.040]  sins and others just handed power to their underlings and other former
[14:01.040 --> 14:06.440]  Goldman Sachs alumni and so that's all that's happening here and we have this
[14:06.440 --> 14:11.520]  spectacle of Obama launching all these new wars and all this secret arrest and
[14:11.520 --> 14:15.520]  all this torture and all this secrecy and all this rendition and all this gun
[14:15.520 --> 14:21.600]  grabbing while saying he is the man of peace who's given the Nobel Peace Prize
[14:21.600 --> 14:28.600]  just like he is saying he's against Wall Street and then paints that as class
[14:28.600 --> 14:34.080]  warfare anti-free market when it's the Federal Reserve from the right with
[14:34.080 --> 14:38.560]  Herman Cain and on the left with Warren Buffett and others openly calling for
[14:38.560 --> 14:43.520]  austerity taxes not to help the poor but to pay it in corporate welfare and
[14:43.520 --> 14:49.760]  largesse and kickbacks and banker bailouts to them it's a hundred percent
[14:49.760 --> 14:57.240]  transparent and ridiculous and now they admit this is the Obama strategy it
[14:57.240 --> 15:02.600]  came out a few weeks ago that they plan to use class warfare that they plan to
[15:02.600 --> 15:07.160]  use racial conflict that they plan to use divide and conquer what else do you
[15:07.160 --> 15:12.040]  think the banksters are going to do during this critical time they don't
[15:12.040 --> 15:16.280]  want the American people black white Hispanic old young northern or southern
[15:16.280 --> 15:23.200]  or western or Muslim you name it Hindu Jewish the list goes on and on they
[15:23.200 --> 15:26.960]  don't want us coming together as a population and saying the private
[15:26.960 --> 15:30.400]  Federal Reserve got rid of Glass-Steagall created tens of trillions of fake
[15:30.400 --> 15:34.800]  derivatives bought up real assets with the fraudulent paper now wants us to
[15:34.800 --> 15:38.800]  prop up their whole paper Empire wants us to go into indentured servitude
[15:38.800 --> 15:44.040]  Herman Cain wants VAT and sales taxes to quote pay off what we owe to the
[15:44.040 --> 15:48.720]  bankers just like Greece or Iceland which we don't owe over 90% of it we're
[15:48.720 --> 15:54.560]  now here to this point as Republicans and Democrats try to sell this fraud to
[15:54.560 --> 16:00.080]  now come out that John P. Holdren is the person that Mitt Romney wants to be his
[16:00.080 --> 16:05.920]  science advisor and who he publicly says he would tap he wants Obama's science
[16:05.920 --> 16:10.280]  advisor who wants global warming taxes one-child policies chemicals in the
[16:10.280 --> 16:15.840]  water and food to sterilize this Mitt Romney's for gun control abortion open
[16:15.840 --> 16:23.960]  borders carbon taxes I mean the list goes on and on and on and Republicans are
[16:23.960 --> 16:28.760]  fawning to vote for this they're fawning to vote for Rick Perry Al Gore's former
[16:28.760 --> 16:33.320]  chief of staff in Texas carbon tax lover Hillary care lover I forgot to
[16:33.320 --> 16:36.960]  mention Mitt Romney wrote Obamacare thawning for that thawning for the
[16:36.960 --> 16:40.160]  former head of the Federal Reserve Kansas City who wants to bring in new
[16:40.160 --> 16:44.240]  taxes on top of the income tax all those years they swore we won't bring
[16:44.240 --> 16:47.920]  forward the fair tax until the income tax is gone I always told you they keep
[16:47.920 --> 16:51.520]  them all just claim that they were gonna lower them down to 9% because that was
[16:51.520 --> 16:55.120]  always the Federal Reserve plan because the European Central Bank did the same
[16:55.120 --> 17:03.240]  thing a decade ago I know the enemy I eat drink and sleep this information I
[17:03.240 --> 17:08.720]  know what I'm talking about this is not hyped up hyperbole this morning I sat
[17:08.720 --> 17:12.560]  there for hours getting ready for this radio show with the information I've
[17:12.560 --> 17:17.440]  learned down here at the border that's worse than I even knew it's unspeakable
[17:17.440 --> 17:20.680]  the genocide going on that's how locals describe it the incredible
[17:20.680 --> 17:24.440]  conscription of the population into slavery oh you're gonna hear it all
[17:24.440 --> 17:30.040]  today and we're gonna cover it with documentation this is so amazing that I
[17:30.040 --> 17:34.760]  don't have words to describe how evil the TSA is and their conscious plan to
[17:34.760 --> 17:38.400]  break our will and train us to be prisoners and turn all of America into a
[17:38.400 --> 17:42.840]  giant prison system with checkpoints and blood draws and hands down the pants I
[17:42.840 --> 17:47.200]  don't have words to describe how evil the North American Union plan is to
[17:47.200 --> 17:51.160]  cause this drug war in Mexico that will end up setting up the North American
[17:51.160 --> 17:56.480]  Union security perimeter already established I cannot describe to you
[17:56.480 --> 18:01.640]  the magnitude of how the system is running giant drills in and around Iran
[18:01.640 --> 18:06.440]  and how the neocons are openly calling for war with Iran I do not have words
[18:06.440 --> 18:10.520]  to describe to you the fact that the Federal Reserve is trying to censor one
[18:10.520 --> 18:15.520]  of our videos right now and shut down our YouTube channel this is all coming up
[18:15.520 --> 18:24.800]  today and I'm gonna attempt to be as calm and as focused as I can but to see
[18:24.800 --> 18:38.000]  Herman Cain in the lead right now 43 percent to Obama's 41 now I also notice
[18:38.000 --> 18:50.240]  here that in similar polls Ron Paul is 43 to Obama's 41 or 44 to Obama's 40 but
[18:50.240 --> 18:54.840]  that's not getting as much media attention and to see the public running
[18:54.840 --> 19:00.120]  into the arms of another globalist it's just too much for me to handle on top
[19:00.120 --> 19:05.000]  of that again Obama is fired up Obama has a shout out to the protesters and
[19:05.000 --> 19:13.480]  says he represents the 99 against the 1% and the same idiot Democrats are now
[19:13.480 --> 19:17.480]  going good now Obama will give me my free car and my free house and my free
[19:17.480 --> 19:21.200]  tuition did you get that when he promised it four years ago three and a half
[19:21.200 --> 19:26.560]  years ago oh thank you mr. president all my problems are now solved did you get
[19:26.560 --> 19:31.120]  that no you didn't get that and so there's no doubt that the goal here is
[19:31.120 --> 19:36.640]  class warfare divide and conquer and racial division which is their admitted
[19:36.640 --> 19:40.760]  plan in this country we've got to get into those occupied Wall Street people
[19:40.760 --> 19:43.840]  just like the Tea Party when the Republican try to take it over and
[19:43.840 --> 19:49.160]  educate them about what's happening and the good news is on the grassroots they
[19:49.160 --> 19:54.880]  are awake to the fact that it's a fraud at the grassroots they are aware that
[19:54.880 --> 19:59.200]  it's a fraud but the national media is going along with the hoax that it is

[24:15.280 --> 24:19.240]  open the phones up after I cover some of the news and then we also have pharmacist
[24:19.240 --> 24:24.360]  Ben Fuchs popping in to cover all the new incredible attacks on dietary
[24:24.360 --> 24:29.360]  supplements that are really heating up right now across the United States so
[24:29.360 --> 24:35.360]  that is coming up I'm also going to break down the notice that the Federal
[24:35.360 --> 24:40.360]  Reserve gave YouTube over the weekend requesting that they pull a video
[24:40.360 --> 24:45.400]  critical of the Federal Reserve and right now that is being reviewed by
[24:45.400 --> 24:49.640]  YouTube they have not taken the video down yet and they have not told us the
[24:49.640 --> 24:57.680]  results of their investigation but I will be talking about that later on in the
[24:57.680 --> 25:02.840]  second hour today the particular video that they're trying to censor is at the
[25:02.840 --> 25:09.880]  Dallas and San Antonio Fed there's video of both where at the Dallas Fed they
[25:09.880 --> 25:15.280]  have signs up that say private property keep off and have fences put up in
[25:15.280 --> 25:18.920]  front of it something they didn't have just a few months ago or three plus
[25:18.920 --> 25:22.760]  years ago when I was there demonstrating you can see that in my film the Obama
[25:22.760 --> 25:26.640]  deception now they've put up these fences and put up signs saying private
[25:26.640 --> 25:32.200]  property keep off just on the grass not even not even on their own sidewalk now
[25:32.200 --> 25:38.400]  at the San Antonio Fed they have their own marble sidewalk running up against
[25:38.400 --> 25:43.880]  the regular sidewalk they don't have any private property signs but they sent the
[25:43.880 --> 25:47.800]  police in along with their security person to tell us get off their private
[25:47.800 --> 25:51.840]  property and then complained and said the shooting video of them and the
[25:51.840 --> 25:56.360]  facility will send up a privacy violation and that violation if it was
[25:56.360 --> 26:01.480]  found to be true could shut down our YouTube channel with now 145 million
[26:01.480 --> 26:06.040]  views so I'll be breaking that down later you heard Ray McGovern last week
[26:06.040 --> 26:10.600]  this is the closest to a war with Iran that we've gotten Congressman King has
[26:10.600 --> 26:14.920]  called for war Obama has said that you know there may be something stronger than
[26:14.920 --> 26:19.280]  sanctions Hillary has called for that Israel is saying they may strike there
[26:19.280 --> 26:25.480]  are giant US military drills going on around Iran that Paul Watson covers today
[26:25.480 --> 26:33.560]  at info wars.com again the green light as far as Israel and the US government
[26:33.560 --> 26:38.400]  right now the green light has been given they are seriously looking at going
[26:38.400 --> 26:42.560]  ahead with this attack now the green light was given late last week since
[26:42.560 --> 26:49.240]  then you've seen literally now it's it's just insane the former head of the
[26:49.240 --> 26:54.160]  bin Laden group and the CIA has come out in a video that we posted info wars.com
[26:54.160 --> 27:00.200]  on Fox News and said that Saudi Arabia and Israel are working together to set
[27:00.200 --> 27:04.320]  up America for a war and they're a greater threat than Iran this is now on
[27:04.320 --> 27:12.160]  Fox News you've got the FBI coming out through Colonel Schaefer and saying
[27:12.160 --> 27:15.840]  there's nothing in the computers it's all fake you've got Ray McGovern
[27:15.840 --> 27:21.680]  coming out you've got the former Bush administration head analyst on Iran
[27:21.680 --> 27:25.280]  coming out and saying it's all fake Reuters came out over the weekend and
[27:25.280 --> 27:29.920]  said it looks like it's fake it just goes on and on and on the New York Times
[27:29.920 --> 27:35.200]  came out and said it was fake and don't go to war with Iran this is a bad idea
[27:35.200 --> 27:39.760]  because it's a horrible geopolitical plan even from the perspective of
[27:39.760 --> 27:44.600]  globalists that aren't completely hubris or hoods fulfilled there's large
[27:44.600 --> 27:49.760]  large contingents of the Israelis don't want to go to war with Iran this is a
[27:49.760 --> 27:55.880]  super bad news but if you're Obama it would politically helping and if you're
[27:55.880 --> 27:59.880]  Benjamin Netanyahu who's in political trouble and has an election coming up
[27:59.880 --> 28:05.200]  it's a great way to get reelected and of course bomb those nuclear sites that
[28:05.200 --> 28:11.040]  will cause incredible chair noble type events similar to what we've seen with
[28:11.040 --> 28:14.800]  Fukushima as the radiation levels across the northern hemisphere just
[28:14.800 --> 28:21.720]  climb and climb and climb and the EPA's response is just to raise the levels of
[28:21.720 --> 28:29.920]  radiation and to say that much higher levels are safer now I literally prayed
[28:29.920 --> 28:35.480]  this morning that God would give me clarity and focus to truly articulate
[28:35.480 --> 28:39.880]  to you the absolute truth of what's happening here in the United States with
[28:39.880 --> 28:45.360]  the Mexico situation and how it ties in to the move towards the North American
[28:45.360 --> 28:49.000]  Union and what I've discovered here and the special guest I haven't even
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.120]  announced this yet it's going to be joining us in one hour from here we'll
[28:54.120 --> 28:59.400]  call him David that's not his name and all of his information checked out it's
[28:59.400 --> 29:03.720]  confirmed what I've gotten from other reporters in the area what I've gotten
[29:03.720 --> 29:08.400]  from police in the area what I've gotten from business owners in the area what
[29:08.400 --> 29:12.960]  I've gotten from the Coast Guard in the area what I've gotten from years of
[29:12.960 --> 29:18.000]  research and hundreds of news articles and sheriffs that I've interviewed here
[29:18.000 --> 29:22.280]  in South Texas on the Mexico border sheriffs have interviewed on there all
[29:22.280 --> 29:29.120]  of it confirms exactly what the Banff Canada SPP document showed from 2007
[29:29.120 --> 29:36.640]  that we cover in my seminal film in-game blueprint for global enslavement so this
[29:36.640 --> 29:44.320]  is all coming up after the break then I will get into the Iran situation I will
[29:44.320 --> 29:49.040]  get into the Obama embracing Occupy Wall Street publicly situation and a lot

[32:11.600 --> 32:15.880]  from underneath the Americans at home. I've turned an innocent influence on our
[32:15.880 --> 32:20.120]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's
[32:20.120 --> 32:25.320]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the
[32:25.320 --> 32:29.920]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[32:29.920 --> 32:34.280]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[32:34.280 --> 32:38.520]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists they're asking for more matches
[32:38.520 --> 32:42.120]  and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like
[32:42.120 --> 32:47.520]  nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[33:00.280 --> 33:30.040]  Okay my friends we are back live on this Monday edition
[33:30.040 --> 33:36.720]  2011 it is the 17th day of October and we are going to be covering the most
[33:36.720 --> 33:45.240]  important issues affecting our planet our Republic our country today. Now I want
[33:45.240 --> 33:51.920]  to get right now into my investigation down here on the South Texas border with
[33:51.920 --> 33:59.440]  Mexico. I am just two miles from the Mexico border right now I've been
[33:59.440 --> 34:06.320]  talking to locals I've been tracking their local news and we have a local who
[34:06.320 --> 34:13.640]  has a lot of inside sources joining us by the name of David 30 minutes into the
[34:13.640 --> 34:19.160]  next hour so about an hour from now he will be joining us via phone David is
[34:19.160 --> 34:25.000]  not his name. My friends first I want to give you the big picture so you
[34:25.000 --> 34:28.040]  understand what's happening here in the United States and what's happening in
[34:28.040 --> 34:34.380]  Mexico and where all this is going. The CIA was set up by the wealthy
[34:34.380 --> 34:42.420]  robber baron families of Yale in 1947 out of the OSS this is all part of
[34:42.420 --> 34:48.680]  mainline history. More than 90% of the leadership of the CIA and its directors
[34:48.680 --> 34:55.720]  in its first 30 or 40 years were skull and bones members not only were they
[34:55.720 --> 35:00.680]  from Yale they were skull and bones members and those families were all
[35:00.680 --> 35:05.880]  intermarried. Skull and bones in the encyclopedia Britannica was admittedly
[35:05.880 --> 35:13.480]  set up by the Russell Trust in 1832 with British East India money in a
[35:13.480 --> 35:20.400]  contract for the United States opium monopoly. In the old days they were able
[35:20.400 --> 35:24.760]  to control the ships and control the routes because the British had a
[35:24.760 --> 35:29.800]  monopoly in India and in areas of southern China and they'd use the drug
[35:29.800 --> 35:34.960]  war because China was stupid enough to make opium illegal to corrupt the
[35:34.960 --> 35:40.320]  police and slowly take over the different regions of China. By the 1830s
[35:40.320 --> 35:45.400]  they just economically controlled it not politically yet and so they made a deal
[35:45.400 --> 35:50.360]  to set up an internal private intelligence agency at Skull and Bones
[35:50.360 --> 35:55.600]  through the old secret society model. Secret societies of old are just the
[35:55.600 --> 36:03.360]  intelligence agencies of old and they set up the CIA. The CIA of course during
[36:03.360 --> 36:08.080]  World War II funded a lot of its operations with the Corsican mafia and
[36:08.080 --> 36:15.880]  the Italian and Sicilian mafia bringing drugs into Europe as well so they've
[36:15.880 --> 36:20.640]  always worked with and controlled organized crime. They've used organized
[36:20.640 --> 36:26.720]  crime as their hitmen. When the Indochina fell, when the French lost control of
[36:26.720 --> 36:32.920]  Vietnam, known as Indochina at the time, in the 50s US personnel were sent in the
[36:32.920 --> 36:41.240]  late 50s as advisors. 4,000 plus died during the first years of that
[36:41.240 --> 36:45.360]  operation and you were told on the news they died in plane crashes, car wrecks.
[36:45.360 --> 36:50.280]  Or hitting their head falling you know in the shower but they died and that was
[36:50.280 --> 36:55.360]  literally classified over the opium. At that time the majority of opium being
[36:55.360 --> 37:00.240]  manufactured and turned into heroin coming out of the Golden Triangle area.
[37:00.240 --> 37:06.200]  Laos, Cambodia but regardless through the coastline of Indochina and
[37:06.200 --> 37:12.360]  northern and southern Vietnam and the Vietnam War now just Vietnam today. Of
[37:12.360 --> 37:19.840]  course as Americans got into cocaine in the 60s and 70s the big banks publicly
[37:19.840 --> 37:25.920]  took over and set up monopolies in Central and South America and the large
[37:25.920 --> 37:30.360]  central banks that laundered the money and were run by the CIA and controlled
[37:30.360 --> 37:36.080]  by those very private families also continued that monopoly. Now and I'm
[37:36.080 --> 37:40.840]  simplifying this but historically it's all on record. It came out in the 80s
[37:40.840 --> 37:44.680]  that the ingredients and the popularization and the recipe for
[37:44.680 --> 37:50.440]  crack cocaine was distributed by drug dealers and the employee of the CIA who
[37:50.440 --> 37:57.320]  were instructed to launder the money in the billions a day even the 1980s. It was
[37:57.320 --> 38:03.840]  over 300 billion a year. In to select Western banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan,
[38:03.840 --> 38:09.640]  Wells Fargo, others all on record. Federal Reserve banks going back into the 70s
[38:09.640 --> 38:14.680]  constantly caught filled with narcotics money in the tens of billions. Endless
[38:14.680 --> 38:18.320]  AP Reuters articles any reporter listening and could just search fellow
[38:18.320 --> 38:21.960]  Reserve Bank laundered drug money and you'll see it or Wachovia laundered drug
[38:21.960 --> 38:27.360]  money or Wells Fargo or Bank of America or Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan. I mean it
[38:27.360 --> 38:35.760]  just came out as you know last year that Wells Fargo and Wachovia 370 plus
[38:35.760 --> 38:40.240]  billion they were running the aircraft leasing the aircraft CIA aircraft
[38:40.240 --> 38:45.320]  crashing in Mexico four tons of pure cocaine coming from the source on and
[38:45.320 --> 38:50.400]  on and on and on and no US government investigation no Mexican government
[38:50.400 --> 38:55.800]  investigation over any of this so you're saying yes Alex we know that well a lot
[38:55.800 --> 39:00.640]  of new listeners don't know this history why do they make drugs illegal we
[39:00.640 --> 39:04.560]  have a gangster culture for nine years we have prohibition in this country in
[39:04.560 --> 39:09.840]  the 20s the crime rate more than tripled alcoholism more than tripled the
[39:09.840 --> 39:17.400]  profits of organized crime Jewish wasp Irish Italian and others went up over
[39:17.400 --> 39:23.960]  400% it is estimated by historical books and congressional investigations that
[39:23.960 --> 39:29.760]  people like Lucky Luciano people like Bugsy Siegel people like Al Capone were
[39:29.760 --> 39:39.600]  making $100 million per week a piece and that was in 1920s money the Rockefellers
[39:39.600 --> 39:44.960]  were involved Job Kennedy controlled large portions of the operation this is
[39:44.960 --> 39:50.920]  how America runs and operates there was a US government contract with a bottled
[39:50.920 --> 39:55.580]  water company out of Arkansas this is all in mainline History Center in Hot
[39:55.580 --> 39:58.800]  Springs Arkansas I've still haven't done that news report with all the video
[39:58.800 --> 40:03.720]  footage I shot up there a month ago but it's coming where the US government on
[40:03.720 --> 40:07.680]  its trains would fill the big water bottles the types that go on the water
[40:07.680 --> 40:15.960]  cooler the types that you know go there in the office and in that was pure
[40:15.960 --> 40:21.280]  clear moonshine shipped on US government trains all over the country
[40:21.280 --> 40:26.400]  quote as the official water of the federal government the G men and others
[40:26.400 --> 40:30.600]  the very one J. Edgar Hoover who told Congress in the 50s that it was a
[40:30.600 --> 40:35.160]  conspiracy theory that's a quote and that organized crime didn't exist you
[40:35.160 --> 40:38.600]  can pull the video clip online you can pull up the news articles because he
[40:38.600 --> 40:44.640]  was a cross-dresser that they homosexual that they were blackmailing the
[40:44.640 --> 40:48.960]  entire time that's why they hired him saying there is no organized crime while
[40:48.960 --> 40:55.960]  US government trains were full of moonshine this is how these people operate
[40:55.960 --> 40:59.640]  Mountain Valley Springs the company you want to look it up by the way it's a
[40:59.640 --> 41:03.520]  great water actually we actually have it at the office ourselves but it's not the
[41:03.520 --> 41:08.600]  moonshine type so all of this is happening this is a gangster organized
[41:08.600 --> 41:14.960]  crime hardcore Bankster situation the Kennedys the Rothschilds the Rockefellers
[41:14.960 --> 41:20.080]  the Italian mafia now by the 50s and I'm getting to the new breaking stuff in
[41:20.080 --> 41:23.800]  Mexico here in a minute but you gotta know the past and know the present by the
[41:23.800 --> 41:29.920]  50s the Italian mafia had become second most powerful the wasp and Jewish
[41:29.920 --> 41:34.520]  mafia that were teamed up with the Irish as well all of those mafias were
[41:34.520 --> 41:38.840]  bigger than the Italian mafia but the Italian mafia had a war and started
[41:38.840 --> 41:44.440]  killing Jews wasp Irish and others so those groups teamed up with the news
[41:44.440 --> 41:48.800]  media and ran a propaganda bless and said there is a mafia but they only
[41:48.800 --> 41:53.560]  busted with the FBI and the state police you know that famous meeting in the
[41:53.560 --> 41:59.160]  farmhouse of the La Cosa Nostra and they said okay it's true there is organized
[41:59.160 --> 42:03.240]  crime it's Italians and they basically wiped them out the Italians have never
[42:03.240 --> 42:07.360]  been the same that they're little bitty compared to what they were before they
[42:07.360 --> 42:10.760]  were at the New World Order table they sent in a Rockefeller to take over
[42:10.760 --> 42:15.320]  Arkansas shut down all the war operations all the gambling accepted it
[42:15.320 --> 42:19.400]  was Rockefeller so they went in and took it over get mowed people down by the
[42:19.400 --> 42:26.000]  thousands huge wars state police sent in fed G men who'd been running the drugs
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.640]  running the liquor forever now their drug war was needed because alcohol
[42:30.640 --> 42:34.080]  prohibition was over people figured out it created war on the streets crime
[42:34.080 --> 42:38.840]  energized criminals corrupted police so they legalized alcohol again right at
[42:38.840 --> 42:43.960]  the same time the year after they criminalized narcotics including
[42:43.960 --> 42:49.280]  marijuana so they have something new to go after now let's move forward to the
[42:49.280 --> 42:53.960]  21st century we told you all this was Celica still and others six years ago
[42:53.960 --> 42:59.160]  Gary Webb before they killed him free Ricky Ross from prison we gave you all
[42:59.160 --> 43:04.400]  the facts and said they're going to put in Felipe Calderon they're going to
[43:04.400 --> 43:10.160]  launch a war no longer are they're going to be allowed to operate more than a
[43:10.160 --> 43:13.720]  dozen major cartels that as long as they launder their money through u.s.
[43:13.720 --> 43:18.840]  globalist or British banks Virgin Islands British Virgin Islands as long as
[43:18.840 --> 43:23.720]  you laundered through them everything was okay no longer a deal's been made
[43:23.720 --> 43:28.880]  10,000 Los Zetas have been trained in the decade before at Fort Benning, Georgia
[43:28.880 --> 43:35.600]  and Fort Bragg this is all public to go in and take over the east coast and up
[43:35.600 --> 43:40.360]  through the border areas but Sinaloa the other big dominant group that's on the
[43:40.360 --> 43:44.040]  east coast then there's also the cartel as it's known and then there's at least
[43:44.040 --> 43:49.160]  still four other five other depending on how you look at it subgroups and they're
[43:49.160 --> 43:53.400]  all killing each other the Mexican government has the tax money it's the
[43:53.400 --> 43:57.520]  main organizer it runs drugs itself and it's constantly caught and so it's a
[43:57.520 --> 44:02.720]  total free-for-all it comes out in fast and furious I'll give you the new stuff
[44:02.720 --> 44:09.160]  here in a minute this is so bombshell the new information comes out in federal
[44:09.160 --> 44:14.560]  court when when the Mexican government ships a Sinaloa number two guy up to
[44:14.560 --> 44:19.720]  Chicago for federal trial he comes in and says national security for five and a
[44:19.720 --> 44:23.840]  half years we're allowed to ship in unlimited tonnage through the u.s.
[44:23.840 --> 44:30.040]  border and we are given guns by the ATF and that's why it then came out it
[44:30.040 --> 44:33.320]  wasn't just gun shops ordered to sell guns to people to track them that was
[44:33.320 --> 44:36.400]  the cover to display in the second amendment that was one layer of the
[44:36.400 --> 44:41.840]  onion the big layer the key core layer was in one shipment alone now in federal
[44:41.840 --> 44:46.200]  court two thousand weapons including a lot of them fully auto confiscated by
[44:46.200 --> 44:51.560]  ATF ship directly to Sinaloa in a double-cross in a balance of power the
[44:51.560 --> 44:55.600]  globalists are all about divide and conquer against their own Los Zetas who
[44:55.600 --> 44:59.200]  even though they were trained at Fort Benning Georgia and Celica still they
[44:59.200 --> 45:02.440]  tried to recruit him he was a military trainer all over Latin America former
[45:02.440 --> 45:08.880]  DEA he said no this is six years ago on my show he was told and others we talked
[45:08.880 --> 45:12.040]  to that this whole war was coming he told you this war was coming to
[45:12.040 --> 45:16.320]  consolidate it down to one cartel that works for the private Federal Reserve
[45:16.320 --> 45:22.400]  and that Calderon would be put in but now Zetas at many levels because their
[45:22.400 --> 45:25.480]  whole leadership has been wiped out their average age of their leaders now
[45:25.480 --> 45:29.360]  it's about 25 they just caught the number two guy what is he 32 years old
[45:29.360 --> 45:33.520]  yesterday for firebombing and blowing up that casino that wouldn't pay
[45:33.520 --> 45:36.920]  protection money and cutting all the heads off I mean this is what's going on
[45:36.920 --> 45:40.960]  40 plus thousand dead in three years genocide ghost town on the Texas border
[45:40.960 --> 45:44.600]  I'm down here right now beautiful hotels everywhere nobody in them I talked to
[45:44.600 --> 45:47.600]  locals they say about a third of the people come down here they used to even
[45:47.600 --> 45:52.440]  during peak times I mean it is a ghost town down here nothing no one is here
[45:52.440 --> 45:57.840]  but rich Mexicans who are all wearing USA shirts saying we like the USA Mexico
[45:57.840 --> 46:03.880]  is imploded Mexico's a failed state but that's coming up continuing here ladies
[46:03.880 --> 46:08.280]  and gentlemen about the total breakdown and failure of society by designed by
[46:08.280 --> 46:12.120]  the social engineers so we told you six years ago five years ago four years ago
[46:12.120 --> 46:15.840]  all this was coming we told you three years ago Obama would blame the second
[46:15.840 --> 46:23.800]  amendment we told you all of this was unfolding now they have got Sinaloa
[46:23.800 --> 46:28.600]  being given weapons shipping their cocaine in they've got zeta killers that
[46:28.600 --> 46:33.540]  are really Sinaloa running around chopping their heads off and you've got
[46:33.540 --> 46:37.960]  here's the key you've got conscription going on and then I've got breaking news
[46:37.960 --> 46:41.760]  about invasions of the US you heard me right breaking news to everybody you
[46:41.760 --> 46:44.920]  know to tune in I'm not even very good talk shows I should have said this at
[46:44.920 --> 46:49.680]  the very start of the show but I tend to cover the sub issues first I should
[46:49.680 --> 46:53.920]  told you day one there there was a helicopter Mexican drug cartel attack
[46:53.920 --> 47:02.640]  eight days ago what's what the Friday before last eight nine days ago in the
[47:02.640 --> 47:07.400]  town of Rio Grande City a few miles from where I'm at where it where the
[47:07.400 --> 47:11.040]  high school junior varsity football game had to basically get shut down with
[47:11.040 --> 47:15.760]  machine gun fire helicopters Mexican troops many miles in fact Richard look
[47:15.760 --> 47:19.640]  up last night I had it look up how far away that sports stadium is from the
[47:19.640 --> 47:25.280]  border this is many miles inside total hell but not on TV not on radio not in
[47:25.280 --> 47:28.800]  print because the whole local news has been told you talk about it you're dead
[47:28.800 --> 47:35.800]  and a few miles from that over the border the administrative editor of the
[47:35.800 --> 47:41.280]  Nueva Laredo newspaper will put this on screen we're hung for putting out a
[47:41.280 --> 47:46.040]  Twitter talking about just talking about what cartels are doing in Nueva
[47:46.040 --> 47:49.960]  Laredo across the border they won't even talk about it when their own families
[47:49.960 --> 47:54.360]  are killed most nights everybody sleeps on mattresses on the floor because the
[47:54.360 --> 47:58.480]  bullets are shooting through it's total genocide and the cartels come to you and
[47:58.480 --> 48:02.240]  they say pick a side and they line up whole families in the street and just
[48:02.240 --> 48:08.040]  shoot them 40,000 is probably a low number 60,000 died in 10 years the
[48:08.040 --> 48:13.680]  Vietnam War we're talking about I don't know what's 40 plus thousand divided
[48:13.680 --> 48:20.120]  into three years we're talking about 13,000 12,000 or more a year that we

[48:25.560 --> 48:29.800]  truck bombs down here where I'm at and no one will talk in America the
[48:29.800 --> 48:35.480]  intimidation has already begun we've got news articles here where the where the
[48:35.480 --> 48:39.120]  cartels are now recruiting high schoolers in Houston Austin San Antonio
[48:39.120 --> 48:44.480]  Dallas Fort Worth the police are all scared and you heard Dr. Pachinic with
[48:44.480 --> 48:48.320]  his inside sources talking about it on the show last week the the Austin
[48:48.320 --> 48:52.520]  Houston San Antonio Dallas police will not even do anything about it
[48:52.520 --> 49:00.440]  America has got its legs basically you know the tail between the legs absolutely
[49:00.440 --> 49:06.080]  in total abject fear with the CIA running the entire operation a psych
[49:06.080 --> 49:11.920]  warfare program to destabilize Mexico wage a total war over the 500 billion a
[49:11.920 --> 49:17.320]  year conservatively coming up into the United States through it you've got
[49:17.320 --> 49:21.520]  reporters in the US newspapers have been attacked here afraid to talk about it
[49:21.520 --> 49:26.120]  you've got Mexican troops operating huge firefights going on every other night
[49:26.120 --> 49:30.560]  you've got giant FEMA camps right down the road from where I'm at let me give
[49:30.560 --> 49:36.760]  me the names of those the Bayview Detention Center the tent city in
[49:36.760 --> 49:44.440]  Raymansville you've got drug flights coming into these bases at night these
[49:44.440 --> 49:48.200]  camps are just a cover for drug flights you've got special forces all over the
[49:48.200 --> 49:54.760]  place you've got Mexican troops in unmarked uniforms being flown in
[49:54.760 --> 50:00.600]  firefights right by the high schools everyone completely scared and here's
[50:00.600 --> 50:06.000]  the key they line up now and now it started on the US side they come to
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.640]  your door and they say are you going to join the cartel are you going to join
[50:08.640 --> 50:14.720]  Los Zetas are you going to join Sena Loa and if you don't decide to join right
[50:14.720 --> 50:20.000]  there they just line you up and shoot you and now it's begun here and Texans
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.760]  come down and they fish and they're killed and disappear or they're kidnapped
[50:24.760 --> 50:29.560]  or they get on their jet ski and the Mexican cartel comes right up and
[50:29.560 --> 50:34.040]  shoots them right in the head on Falcon Lake and our own media says it's not
[50:34.040 --> 50:37.280]  true and then it turns out it was then the Mexican police go to investigate and
[50:37.280 --> 50:42.120]  they chopped their heads off the truth is the globalists have created something
[50:42.120 --> 50:46.520]  they can't even control because the people worship the grim reaper now down
[50:46.520 --> 50:50.520]  in Mexico they all tattoo the skinny one Richard how do you say that in I

[51:10.720 --> 51:14.400]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold
[51:14.400 --> 51:17.480]  and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen

[54:49.360 --> 54:54.000]  shooting pregnant Hispanic women and implying that good old boys that want
[54:54.000 --> 54:59.000]  sovereignty and to control our border want to murder Hispanics and then the
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.160]  drug cartels are good guys basically in the movie I mean this is just pure
[55:03.160 --> 55:08.760]  cowardice on Robert Rodriguez's part you see I don't want the people Mexico

[55:17.000 --> 55:20.720]  of disgusting stuff that's happening so here's what's going on there is a war

[55:30.400 --> 55:37.760]  plan we've covered for four years since 2007 to destabilize North America using
[55:37.760 --> 55:43.240]  a stage drug war to then call for a continental security perimeter Obama just
[55:43.240 --> 55:47.520]  announced that now their signal use Mexican troops in the US US troops in
[55:47.520 --> 55:52.680]  Mexico vice versa Canadian as well now that's begun and the public's just
[55:52.680 --> 56:00.320]  told to shut up about it okay this is a massive news just just type into a search
[56:00.320 --> 56:04.720]  engine Mexican troops to respond inside US Mexican troops to operate inside US
[56:04.720 --> 56:10.040]  under agreement and then meanwhile their helicopter gun fights let me just show

[56:17.440 --> 56:22.040]  you just just go to Google Maps and type in Rio Grande City here is the Rio
[56:22.040 --> 56:27.200]  Grande right here you can see the Rio Grande River right here and then here
[56:27.200 --> 56:36.000]  about a mile and a half into the United States is Rio Grande City and in Rio
[56:36.000 --> 56:42.080]  Grande City not this Friday but Friday before last eight nine days ago I guess
[56:42.080 --> 56:46.720]  that's eight days ago nine days ago nine days ago during the junior varsity
[56:46.720 --> 56:51.120]  football team game in fact I've got a witness coming on about this even gave
[56:51.120 --> 56:54.920]  me the names last night and I made some calls and I'd also confirm this there's
[56:54.920 --> 57:01.000]  some other sources that this went on we're talking just just just just right
[57:01.000 --> 57:08.760]  beside the football field helicopters gun fights just absolute bedlam zero news
[57:08.760 --> 57:13.960]  meanwhile all over the United States it's always the same MO some old man who
[57:13.960 --> 57:18.120]  still thinks this is America that was all over the country Indiana Massachusetts
[57:18.120 --> 57:23.240]  Texas always in some were suburb in a rural area will put will put their gun

[57:28.000 --> 57:34.280]  cowardly public saw a gun into the world everything shut down meanwhile ladies and
[57:34.280 --> 57:39.200]  gentlemen there are thousands dead on this side they are threatening
[57:39.200 --> 57:43.360]  reporters they are killing reporters right over the border and they report on
[57:43.360 --> 57:47.520]  this they're telling locals they're gonna kill them to the point of here's the
[57:47.520 --> 57:52.200]  total proof this is national news let the media just like I told you months ago
[57:52.200 --> 57:56.240]  Mexican helicopters were doing insertions and attacks here domestically and then
[57:56.240 --> 57:59.200]  it came out later in the news I got emails all your line about Mexican
[57:59.200 --> 58:04.000]  helicopters I had a share of song about it and even when it's in the local news
[58:04.000 --> 58:08.360]  it gets no attention the government doesn't want you to know about this they
[58:08.360 --> 58:11.840]  don't want you to know they're letting major Mexican cartels the cartels it's
[58:11.840 --> 58:16.680]  known Los Zeta's Senola and others operate with impunity and the
[58:16.680 --> 58:21.840]  government's giving them arms both sides to kill each other so they can then use
[58:21.840 --> 58:25.960]  the crisis as SPP says they say in the North American Union documents they'll
[58:25.960 --> 58:34.560]  use three things to integrate the war on drugs the war on drugs the flu crisis
[58:34.560 --> 58:38.560]  and terrorism will they ride back stay with us

[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:12.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.280]  Alex Jones
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.200]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are back live into our number two I haven't
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:38.200]  even gotten into the huge new developments where they've got big
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:43.560]  military exercises going on in and around Iran all these calls to strike
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.680]  them it's come out that of course the bust of the Iranian planning all the
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.120]  assassinations was fake so now the White House is saying don't worry more
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:57.000]  stuff's gonna come out Israel and certain elements in our country and
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.440]  certain elements in Israel a lot of folks in Israel are against it want this
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.600]  war and they want it to happen now and we've also seen kind of the some of the
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:09.840]  pro-war Israel lobby demonizing us on the message boards and really coming out
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:15.600]  against us big time when all I'm trying to do is stop a World War three here so
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:19.840]  we've got that going on you know I've never tried to be anti-Israel or
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.080]  anti-China or anti-England or anti-Mexico I'm an anti-corruption and
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.720]  I'm sick of it I don't want to be drug into a new war so we've got all that
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:33.160]  happening and this idea is put out that you know everybody in Israel wants this
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:37.120]  war no that's not true or everybody in America wants this war no it's not true
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.480]  where everybody in the government wants this war you've heard people that are
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.680]  not fans of Iran like Anthony Schaefer the Colonel saying this is staged and we
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:49.480]  don't want this so many others have come out so that's coming up we've also
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:56.400]  got the fellow reserve trying to censor us the videos are up at info wars.com
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:04.080]  the article is up there and we've it did have the headline head of federal
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.920]  reserve security admits federal reserve's private but we changed the
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:13.880]  headlines people understand now has the headline a federal reserve you know
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:21.280]  tells YouTube to remove video and they told us Friday night we had 48 hours to
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.600]  remove it or YouTube would review it and if they found it wasn't privacy
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:28.320]  violation they might take our channel down Aaron Dykes will be doing info
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:32.720]  works nightly news tonight and we will show that email then from that that
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.720]  notice from YouTube in fact I may even show it later in the third hour if Aaron
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:42.560]  gets in he may be in now sure he is in now and gives that to the crew there
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.400]  we'll talk about that because of course I've gotten emails and calls saying
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:49.080]  prove that you've got a YouTube violation or the YouTube's threatening
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:54.160]  this okay we will but I mean the point is the federal reserve is filed try to
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.480]  bring down the video where they admit the fellow reserves private and a lot of
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:01.480]  you also say well who doesn't know that what are you gonna tell me next the sky
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.800]  is blue well look just cuz you know which end is up doesn't mean the general
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.800]  public does and they don't like the fact that the cops laughing with us and
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.840]  going yeah we should investigate the fact that they act like they're a federal
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.960]  building and they admit they aren't that's the real reason they want this
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.240]  video down that's my gut feeling that's what the commenters have said on the
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:25.400]  video with me never stating my opinion but I think that our viewers have got it
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:29.720]  downright they're not saying why they just say it's a privacy violation remove
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:35.960]  it as we stand there outside their offices protesting it's incredible and
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:40.160]  it would affect all media news gathering you name it if they were able to do
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:45.200]  this what an incredible new precedent so we'll be covering that that is a big
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.840]  viral story but quite frankly it is an attack on the First Amendment so it's
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.520]  important on that chain of importance but on a chain of one to ten it's
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:57.880]  probably only a five if you compare the whole Iran situation Obama openly trying
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:02.760]  to take over Occupy Wall Street and embracing it when he's total new world
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:08.360]  order total insider and then on top of that just to illustrate the globalist
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:12.560]  mindset and philosophy I'm gonna try to crystallize it all simply and boil down
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.480]  what we're facing when we come back from this quick break I am down here
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.040]  literally on the border I can see the border from where I'm at and Americans
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.000]  down here are scared to death of these cartels and that's not a way to live if
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.120]  we live in fear then the skinny one will come for us all Laflaca and Al
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:36.120]  Flocko and it just figures that we're under the sway of the Grand Raper and
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.560]  everybody's groveling and fear around here we got a gentleman here coming up
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.560]  whose name is protected it'll break down the helicopter attacks the battle and
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:48.360]  the murders the fear America just on its knees with the CIA bringing in the
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:53.800]  narcotics FEMA camps government drug dealing just bedlam cats and dogs
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:58.600]  living together wrath of God type stuff stay with us

[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:41.160]  now reports it is the most popular God or saint in Mexico after Jesus and Mary
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:47.960]  it is the number three most popular God it is the grim reaper they have the

[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.520]  drug cartels would never kill children now they blow little children's heads off
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:12.040]  with enjoyment every day or two I hear about him killing police chiefs burning
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:17.760]  down casinos hotels chopping everybody's heads off and if you talk about it they
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:22.520]  will have foundation-controlled groups like Mechiloraza and others come out and
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:28.280]  say none of this is happening it's a hoax and then Fox News Corp. Rupert Murdoch
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:33.040]  puts out a movie where it's the Minutemen killing everybody Minutemen have
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:37.160]  killed no one in fact I've been talking to Hispanic Americans down there about
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.960]  how the Minutemen have tried to come down to help and wealthy groups have
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.600]  tried to send in paramilitary people offering to help but the locals are
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.680]  afraid and I've been told you'll be killed and your children will if you
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:53.920]  fight back and I've talked to gringos down here I've talked to you know blonde
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:58.400]  hair blue-eyed people and they're scared I've talked to black people they're scared
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:04.200]  I've talked to Hispanics they're scared I have been mobbed by Hispanic listeners
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.360]  down here who are Hispanic Americans and also Mexican nationals there's a lot
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:14.520]  of wealthy Mexicans here in fact a lot of them you you know look like people
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.880]  from Spain a lot of beautiful senior readers and they'll come run up Alex
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.800]  Jones how are you still alive yes we listen we know you know what you're
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:25.760]  talking about you know they're worshiping the skinny one this is death
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.480]  that sacrifice it is a genocide it's more than 40,000 and then I've start
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:35.320]  talking to cops who are scared I start talking to all these people about the
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:39.760]  helicopter attacks the merge the kidnapping the people being killed here
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:44.280]  and they've told all the local TV and print newspapers and I've got some of
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:56.000]  them here in my hand hold on they've told the Valley Morning Star they've told
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.120]  the Brownsville Herald I mean here are the newspapers right here they've told
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:08.760]  these guys you keep your mouth shut here's another one they've told the TV
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:11.840]  stations I mean when there's killings when there's kidnappings when there's
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.640]  murders this is how it started in Mexico and the cops are just out there
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.080]  writing tickets on citizens getting their little bit of money and just
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:25.200]  cowering this is how America operates now and they got the Coast Guard and the
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.920]  game wardens out harassing everybody if they catch too many sand trout or
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:34.960]  whatever and you got the cartels you got the CIA you got Los Zetas openly
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:39.200]  trained by the US military at Fort Bragg and Fort Benning Georgia all on record
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.320]  and it's all part of a plan to consolidate to have a huge drug war in
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.760]  Mexico that's bigger than the Vietnam War per year just a real bona fide war
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:54.520]  40 plus thousand dead in three years on the Mexican side 5,000 on this side and
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:59.520]  that's just what we know of and no one will talk about I've had people come to
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:04.520]  me and say you've got to talk about it sir I mean I've been walking down the
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:07.480]  street going into a restaurant and you know pulls a brand new Mercedes with
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:11.320]  some you know obviously wealthy Mexican in it going Alex Jones we listen to you
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.640]  I can't believe you're still alive what are you doing down here have you notice
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.440]  there's not many people down here normally there is this time of year
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:23.520]  it's all coming here the skinny one I mean it is on the people are scared to
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:29.000]  death looking over their shoulders in America in Brownsville in South Padre
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.920]  in Laredo in El Paso and then you've got the police looking over their
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.320]  shoulder out there just revenue generating and then I see Associated
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:43.400]  Press Reuters Fox News telling you the public what I told you years ago the
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:49.440]  drug cartels are now as far north as Illinois they're also in Canada and the
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.520]  Mexican drug cartels are even more vicious than the Russians because it's a
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.240]  culture of death the veneer of civilization the thin covering of
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.880]  civilization is incredibly thin just like it was in Europe they'd have hundred
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:07.040]  year wars they'd have half the population die for thousands of years just
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.520]  eternal warfare and once you give into this dark impulse once you give into
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.720]  the culture of death once you give in to not caring about dying anymore for
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:20.920]  money so you're supposed to not care about dying for freedom and for standing
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:25.600]  up for liberty and then that pushes back the darkness that pushes back the
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:30.480]  grim reaper instead you have a culture where it's worshiped totally turning
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:36.200]  themselves over to the Diablo L Diablo ladies and gentlemen it's strong and it's
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:41.640]  spreading all over the United States and it's so sad and it's so sick and the
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:46.680]  culture has all primed and you see the stickers all over cars in Austin with the
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:51.440]  skinny one and people crazed and wanting to die wanting to show their manhood
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.440]  destroying our culture destroying children and the family's future it is
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:03.240]  abhorrent it is blasphemy against humanity and it's all been done because
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:07.120]  of the drug war and the global social engineers rule the planet because they're
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:10.880]  masters they're playing the big drug cartels off against each other while the
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:17.640]  CIA funds both sides while the DEA FBI border patrol all of them eight agencies
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:22.960]  ship the guns in they ship the cocaine in they have military bases and homeland
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.920]  security ice bases they send down the the homeland security boats to pick up the
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:31.120]  cocaine right out there and they bring it in back and forth all day right in
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:36.720]  front everybody right there in South Padre just boom boom back and forth just
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.960]  drug shipment boats sitting out there big big barges just sitting out there
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.280]  with homeland security going back and forth it's all funny to them and homeland
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.840]  security roars by their big ships right by little fishing boats and bugs their
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.720]  eyes out at the citizens and splashes waves on them but then I've been out on
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:57.480]  a charter whenever you see homeland security and I've been fishing a lot in
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:01.080]  my life before people didn't act like this and I'm now seeing this even in
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:06.080]  Port Aransas far away from the border you know before whenever they see now a
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.600]  Coast Guard or a homeland security or ice boat you stop your engine and you
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:14.680]  cower and wave at them and they drive by with their chest sticking out just like
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:20.000]  it's Mexico and just look at you like you flash I mean you tip your hat you
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.160]  stop your boat and I'm like I'm like that that homeland security boats 300
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.720]  400 yards away why are you stopping they're like well you've got to do it
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:34.440]  they'll board you and get your face and I talked to other locals around here and
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.880]  they're like yeah no they come in and out back and forth with the drugs they're
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:42.200]  landing them out here at these air bases they've got the airport attached to
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:46.400]  the it's all you idiots that use drugs that are allowing this to happen and you
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.440]  idiots that support drug prohibition if somebody's gonna use drugs they're gonna
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.080]  do it you got to decriminalize now to save our society but they've grown these
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:59.760]  games up so big they're now expanding out into kidnapping and extortion and
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.320]  and every other form of evil is now happening and they're not just going
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:06.720]  into Hispanic shops now and doing it thinking Hispanics will go along with
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:10.880]  it like the Asian triads only feed on Asians no now they're going in
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.800]  everywhere and doing it and the cops won't help you because they're on the
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:17.840]  payroll they'll only bust little bitty gangbangers and fill them into the
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:21.720]  prisons where they have higher level drug dealers who then train them to join
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:25.560]  their armies all part of the systematic takeover plan by the social
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:30.240]  engineers and now as all this implodes they're going to call for a total North
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:35.640]  American Union and US forces to go into Mexico and secure it and now Rick Perry's
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:39.920]  proposing it we played that clip two weeks ago it's all part of the North
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:44.560]  American problem reaction solution plan with our own totally criminal
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.080]  government caught shipping the cocaine in and the guns out directly to the
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:55.360]  cartels double crossing each other think about it think about how the Mexican
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:00.240]  military dug slugs out of their dead people and shipped it back knowing how
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.520]  to trace it to certain guns that have been sold because they were part of it
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:08.560]  it's all part of a giant double crossing operation meant to destroy Mexico and
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:13.360]  have huge refugee floods come in which then further bankrupt the United States
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:17.560]  if we would have made everybody stay down in Mexico that's another thing that
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:20.800]  the people were gonna have a revolution six seven years ago in Mexico and
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:25.280]  throw out the globalist and JP Morgan Goldman Sachs dictatorship so in the
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.720]  actuaries the globalists said we'll start a drug war let them all kill each
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:34.360]  other that way then they'll be happy to be slaves the globalists know what
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:37.960]  they're doing they know how to manipulate and then meanwhile this drug
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:41.680]  dealing murdering globalist banker government that's hijacked of us and
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:46.360]  Mexico openly has dog training now to stick their hands down your pants
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.920]  microwave oven you make you answer questions now at the airports where you
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:53.480]  come in where you go and you're not a terrorist are you to train you to be a
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:58.040]  prisoner totally breaking your will just and see there's no end to these
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.760]  criminals because the criminals that run America and run the big banks and run
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:06.160]  Mexico they're only gonna get replaced with worse people and worse people I
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:12.160]  mean 30 years ago they would grab people that went over into Matamoros from
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:19.880]  South Padre gringos and tortured them to death in human sacrifices Texas monthly
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.800]  articles about it you name it but it's always kept real quiet and why is that
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:27.120]  why are all these people devil worshipers because when you get a corrupt
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.560]  society the most evil are gonna rise at the top and whether you believe in God
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:38.640]  or not people that are into evil always worship Diablo okay they always worship

[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:13.960]  well enough the kind of kissing tail okay so here's the basics the United
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:18.240]  States government's been taken over by ruthless mega banks that made their
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:24.640]  original money off of a worldwide monopoly on opium coming out of India
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:30.800]  Afghanistan and with the French out of Indochina what's Vietnam today this is
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:35.280]  all mainline history the Chinese didn't like opium and what it did to their
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:39.000]  population and they said you basically make our people slaves bring in the
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:45.120]  sin it's banned well yeah opium is bad but it's worse to ban it because then
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:49.800]  over the course of about 200 years the British were able to take over town
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.520]  after town slowly corrupting the police and getting everybody basically
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:25:00.600]  addicted and then the only economy left was the opium then China fell and was
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:05.280]  broken in 11 parts the US had a part the French the Dutch the British the
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:11.440]  Germans the the Austrian-Hungary Empire they all had their own parts and this is
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:17.080]  all part of history look up the opium wars look up the boxer rebellion when
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:20.920]  the Chinese tried to fight this off this is how it's done that's why still
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:27.040]  today in China well there's three ways to do it you either totally legalize it or
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.000]  at least decriminalize or you have it illegal and then that's the worst way
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.440]  because then it was just mildly illegal it makes it worse because there's money
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:38.800]  in it or you execute people like Singapore or China then you don't have
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:44.280]  any use because they catch you one time dead so there's really three ways to do
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.880]  it you either death penalty immediately for any illegal drug use just boom
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:54.520]  you're dead in any sovereign country that wants to say sovereign pretty much
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:58.800]  has to do that there's a reason death penalty death penalty I'm not advocating
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:03.200]  that I'm just saying death penalty or total legalization you try to just oh
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.080]  we're gonna make it illegal that only keeps the price up you know we're gonna
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:10.200]  put you in jail where you learn how to be a bigger drug dealer you know spat on
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:15.000]  the wrist so they're making it all sexy you see the Hispanic kids everywhere
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.160]  wearing the Grim Reaper they think it's cool Grim Reaper stickers on the cars
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:24.600]  the music the rap the tahana the Rock it's all you know the skin he's gonna
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:29.160]  get you yeah it's fun the drug cartels come in they give the kids the drugs they
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:32.040]  get them addicted they start selling it and they start telling them kill
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:37.560]  somebody go kill this person to prove it and so the police all over the US just
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:41.080]  stand down they just say okay well the government's bringing this stuff in we'll
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.960]  just let them do it but that isn't gonna stop it either they're gonna start
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.280]  killing each other in greater numbers and what's already here's the news flash
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.480]  all the killing and and and the major war-level casualties going on and the
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:57.400]  kidnapping death and murder you've already seen a 500% you pull this up on
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:01.920]  Google increase in the Southwest and kidnappings the last decade the capital
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:06.520]  of kidnappings in the United States is now Phoenix Arizona and then it's not a
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:10.200]  big news item the media knows to keep their mouth shut they kidnap your kid
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:14.880]  or kidnap you it's not gonna be a news item I mean everybody knows you go into
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:18.920]  northern Mexico for decades the police will just in your own car take your car
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:22.800]  and shake you down now that doesn't happen people just have not a cop any
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:27.480]  more I'm a I'm a enforcer for one of the drug cartels and now they're going
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:31.040]  house to house all especially on the Texas border on both sides and saying
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.680]  which side are you on we're putting you down on the list they actually come to
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.480]  your door a lot of times Mexican military comes to your door even six
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:42.400]  seven miles in they come to your farmhouse and they're not and before it
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.000]  was just Hispanics they did it to do because they thought well they'll roll
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.720]  over they're used to this now you because even though they're on the side of
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:53.640]  the US it's it's a Mexico culture now they're coming to gringo's door and in
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:56.600]  the past they didn't do that because you had the old Western ideas shooting
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.680]  somebody did that now they're going and come to the door knocking and they go
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:03.840]  ahead and wear a military uniform and gringo's just roll over as well they've
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:07.920]  been well trained to be slaves so land of the coward home of the slave land of
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:11.520]  the grim reaper which is what skull and bones bohemian grove we think they
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.720]  worship at skull and bones you've seen the Good Shepherd made by Robert De Niro
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:19.760]  with Matt Damon they got hailed as being so accurate a grim reaper with a
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:24.200]  gold crown on you actually go look up the skinny one in most of the patients
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:28.320]  it's wearing a gold crown skull and bones worships a grim reaper skull mask
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.640]  black hood with a gold crown what do they worship in Mexico a grim reaper with
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:39.680]  a gold crown you that's Satan ladies and gentlemen they are Satan worshipers at
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:43.320]  bohemian grove there's a reason in the old days people didn't put up with this
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:47.160]  because when you put up with people start worshiping and start doing this
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:50.720]  your society literally goes to hell and if you're a sociologist or
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:53.880]  anthropologist you don't believe in God the devil fine that's your issue the
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:59.280]  point is they believe in the devil they believe in it they believe in a grim
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:02.480]  reaper with a crown that's coming to kill you and your family and they're down
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:07.680]  here and I see Americans literally shaking and fear everywhere you ask
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:10.480]  people you're fishing with you ask people at gas stations you come up and ask
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:15.200]  cops and they look at you and say I'm not talking to you and are totally freaked
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:20.560]  out fear in Americans eyes because right on the bridge between the US and
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:26.000]  Mexico just two weeks ago they hung those reporters and buried in the article
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.520]  admitted it was the head editor the editor that's over operations the
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:35.800]  general manager hung them major newspaper editor and killed some other
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:41.840]  people hung them off the bridge and it wasn't even an issue that's intimidation
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:45.680]  you know when the quote Muslims did that in Fallujah they had to wait wipe out
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:50.240]  the whole town are given to intimidation here we just give in we bend over we're

[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:10.260]  is that I haven't been down to this part of the this part of south Texas in a
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:14.780]  long time and I was down here a month ago or so and I really wanted to come
[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:19.740]  back to have a working vacation but also spend time talking to locals and then
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:22.940]  what I discovered since then the last few days I've been pretty much in pure
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:28.260]  work mode learning more talking to locals and what I found has really hurt
[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:35.300]  me Americans whether they're black white Hispanic are scared to talk and there
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:40.060]  are firefights here all the time when I've had sheriffs on years ago when
[01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:44.140]  Mexican cartels have come across five six miles to grab a shipment of drugs
[01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:48.900]  seized by the the the sheriff in that case it didn't even make national news
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.940]  that the Mexican military pulled up around them and took the drugs the
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:55.220]  Mexican military is dealing drugs they're fighting but also trying to
[01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:59.740]  manage the other big cartels the big megabanks were all involved in it
[01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:04.060]  Wachovia Wells Fargo been caught running the aircraft CIA aircraft have
[01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:08.740]  crashed with the cocaine this is all going on you've got the the the
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:11.500]  Homeland Security driving out in their big boats every day picking up drugs
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:18.180]  bringing it back in this is just a giant mafia organization and what's
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:21.620]  heartening is the Mexican nationals that have moved up here because of the
[01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:26.100]  crime wave I'd say more than half of them are listeners I can't walk down the
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:29.660]  street even here in this place is pretty much empty the Mexican nationals are
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:34.060]  hey Alex Jones yeah you're absolutely right and then I run into American
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:39.140]  citizens or Hispanic white black a lot of them are listeners and aware I'll be
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:43.620]  talking when I'm walking through the hotel and people come up to me I mean I
[01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:46.580] 'd say more than half the people down here are listeners and I'm not even on
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:51.340]  an AM station here for years I was on one in Corpus Christi and then it just
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:56.300]  changed formats last month to ESPN but that couldn't be heard here so huge
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:38:02.020]  audience I'm finding out per capita our biggest audience must be a Hispanics be
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:06.140]  Mexican nationals you notice we have a lot of calls from Mexico itself so I
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:10.100]  want to go to this guest for the rest of the hour and we're gonna go with his
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:12.660]  name David you know he was willing to come on with his name and everything but
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:16.860]  I'm not gonna I'm not gonna risk him as a good Christian family man he has
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:20.540]  amazing contacts everything he said checks out with my contacts he has
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:26.020]  contacts inside the Rio Grande city system and what happened there and
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:33.100]  witnesses he has people inside the Bayview detention center and the tent
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:39.500]  city in Raymondville and he joins us and boy let me tell you he can rattle it
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:43.380]  off and he's got breaking news here about the incidents and I remember seeing
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:46.380]  this years ago and would only be in the local news now it's not even the local
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:51.940]  news helicopter gunfights deaths Mexican troops inside the US operating and now
[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:56.060]  our government admits they're authorizing this and local news is told don't
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:59.980]  report on it but they're even scared to pretty much have football games I did
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:03.220]  see in the Dallas morning news a month ago a soccer team was coming up for
[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:08.420]  Mexico to play in Round Rock Texas north of Austin and wouldn't pay a $30,000
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:13.380]  kickback what was it to Santa Loa so they just canceled the soccer game this
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:18.060]  is here just like it was in Fox News yesterday and last week again that
[01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:22.060]  they're recruiting in Austin in Dallas and San Antonio in Houston and they're
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:26.820]  putting the the devil tattoos in the and the and the and the and the skinny one
[01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:35.300]  and the Luff Flaca and the L Flaco tattoos on them this is and Santa death
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:37.940]  and all of this stuff it is so incredible so I want to take you to our
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:42.020]  guest sure if you can just just tell people first what happened at the
[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:48.380]  football game nine days ago there in Rio Grande City and that total blackout
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:51.820]  and the other things that are happening and the fact that as you
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:56.300]  described it the conscription well like where the British would grab somebody
[01:39:56.300 --> 01:40:00.620]  out of a out of their house and press them onto a ship as basically a slave
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:05.180]  they're now all over Mexico but the news is here in the US to a certain extent
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:09.020]  coming and saying which cartel are you going to join and if you don't want to
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:13.260]  join they're killing you and our police are corrupted most of them are getting
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:17.580]  on the take now I mean this is spreading like cancer you've got the floor
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:24.380]  David tell us what's happening right thanks Alex yeah a few days back it was
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:30.580]  a Thursday night there was a football game out in Rio Grande City and
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:35.140]  apparently there was a good amount of spillover with the military the
[01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:41.740]  Mexican military and their police chasing cartel they they still haven't come
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:47.740]  clear whether was that is or the actual scene a little cartel but they crossed
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:51.580]  over into the real grand city area and it wasn't very far from the football game
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:57.900]  and they tried to you know downplay it but so many police officers that have
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:01.940]  children that play in sports here along the real Grand Valley caught wind of it
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:05.580]  and eventually the media caught wind of it and they did admit that there was
[01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:11.540]  some crossover but it's dangerous you know it's a bullet doesn't travel 10
[01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:15.980]  yards you know so they didn't admit how widespread it was they just said oh
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:19.940]  across the border some shooting can you describe what's now going on here because
[01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:23.220]  I would talk about this a year ago people say all that isn't happening the
[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:26.860]  helicopters our listeners would say there's firefights there's helicopters you
[01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:31.920]  know 10 miles in now that's a firm but again the media won't report on the
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:37.100]  details oh yeah that as a matter of fact almost they may be about a month and
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:40.380]  a half two months back a farmer threatened to shoot down a Mexican
[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:45.660]  military helicopter and he was told not to by the local law enforcement agency
[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:49.420]  because he could get in trouble and later on they come to find out that no
[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:53.620]  one wants to confirm nor deny whether they have permission or not to cross
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:57.620]  into our airspace which is totally ridiculous I mean they consider
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:42:01.420]  themselves a sovereign nation just as much as we do but yet they can come in
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:05.140]  and we don't have any right to find out that that information that's public
[01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:08.220]  information there should be we should be privy to know who's flying into our
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:12.940]  airspace and landing on our taxpayers on our our citizens ground on their
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:16.660]  property they don't want to just to be clear sir a couple months ago the
[01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:21.140]  Pentagon did say yes we've given limited authorization but obviously they won't
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:24.780]  tell you locally because it's a violation of sovereignty but they wouldn't be
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:28.660]  coming in if they weren't given permission now the question is do they
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:32.660]  have permission to come to that sheriff I interviewed and take the drugs that he
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:36.340]  confiscated at gunpoint now let's talk about the different well let's talk
[01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:40.940]  about more of what's happening down here and the fear the palpable fear that I'm
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:47.180]  seeing from people in the United States yeah they did I have to two people two
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:51.060]  friends that I know acquaintances that I know that we're working in Makila a lot
[01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:55.340]  of plants right across the river and you know to save time and money and what
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:59.060]  not getting off work late at night they would just go and stay on the Mexican
[01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:05.260]  side and one one late evening he heard a knock at door and he answered the door
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:09.060]  and he got dragged out onto the street and they started questioning me he was
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:12.740]  like you know you got the wrong guy blah blah blah they they beat him they
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:17.060]  stripped him they took him out into the middle of nowhere continue to beat him
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:20.860]  and they gave him his shoes and now as a matter of fact they gave him his pants no
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:24.860]  shoes walking barefooted and a driver's license that's how they gave him back and
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:28.820]  he found his way back home or into into the town where he was living along the
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:33.260]  border there in Mexico he said the next day they went back he heard a knock
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:37.220]  again and he peeked out the curtain of those window and it was the door the
[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:40.820]  house next door the apartment next door and they dragged two or three kids out
[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:43.820]  and popped them execution style in the back ahead and left them out on the
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:48.940]  street and broad daylight send a message to everybody well that's all over the
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:52.260]  news I mean I remember seeing beheadings in Arizona a few years ago and I talked
[01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:56.220]  about it and they wrote articles saying I was making it up and the Democrats came
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:44:00.820]  out and said it wasn't true and I mean you've got a lot that is burning down the
[01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:05.460]  casino killing 40-something people pouring gasoline down the the air
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:10.740]  conditioning system now you've got 40,000 plus dead you described this as a
[01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:17.020]  genocide in your own words talk about what's happening what they're
[01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:22.580]  continuing it's it's on a daily basis I mean we I get to see and talk to so many
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:25.900]  people that come across the border from Mexico and these are people that are
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:29.660]  obviously well off but they can move anywhere they want and they're moving
[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:33.340]  across the border and opening up business and moving away because they said
[01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:37.460]  it's just a constant everyday thing that it's almost a point where you just
[01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:42.380]  they're growing numb and and that's kind of sad because they don't even have the
[01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:47.340]  power to fight their own government and say they want true change because there
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:52.460]  was a report on ABC News I believe it was saying that 87% of the businesses are
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:56.940]  infiltrated by one one cartel or the other and it's either you do or you don't
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:00.380]  and they sent the clear message to a school right right outside of Monterey
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:06.460]  they they laid out some some heads with of course no bodies and then they
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:09.900]  proceeded to dump the bodies in other places telling the school teachers if
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:13.500]  you want to show up to work you better start paying us because we need some
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:17.540]  money from you now or else we're gonna start hitting up on the schools and and
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:21.780]  and and whether people believe it or not just look at what's happened in China
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:25.620]  and Russia where stuff like that has gone on and of course we don't get to
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:28.540]  hear the whole story about it but it this is right here in our backyard I
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:32.780]  mean it's at our back door we need to we need to know what's going on am I
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:36.660]  saying we need to go there and get involved no but I am saying we need to
[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:41.260]  protect our borders Obama's willing to send a hundred and some plus advisors
[01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:45.540]  slash troops to the other side of the world he can't send a hundred more we
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:49.140]  need to help here desperately need to help because they are beheading they're
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:52.380]  gutting people up in broad daylight they're dumping bodies off the highway
[01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:57.020]  for people to see they do not care they do not care and people need to have
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:46:00.460]  realized that those people eventually going to make their way on to this side
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:04.060]  and they're gonna start intimidating more it goes all along the border on our
[01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:09.500]  side of the country along the real Brandy City along Texas Laredo El Paso
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:12.900]  all the way down the browser it goes on on a constant basis there's a lot of
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:17.940]  these people end up going back home to Mexico or vice versa and they catch
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:21.060]  wind and say hey you know what you're going oh you're making money we need a
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:24.700]  cut and it's like you know I'm barely making well you're not gonna make it at
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:28.540]  all it's you need to give us a cut or you die that this is just plain and
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:33.020]  simple there's no there's no way to try and wash this and and say oh well you
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:37.620]  know it's a bit exaggerated it's not it's exactly what it is well you can't
[01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:42.020]  exaggerate it I mean it's footnotes in the paper that they shake down the
[01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:46.220]  police are told to pay protection money the school teachers and now they've
[01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:50.300]  even killed us diplomats and our own government won't do anything for them
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:54.540]  because our government is so deeply involved in narcotics trafficking and
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:57.940]  the stories you mentioned about the teachers that's in the news what about
[01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:02.740]  I mean what is it like for you though to see American citizens afraid because I
[01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:07.220]  try to talk to people on boats I've chartered you know to go fishing with
[01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:11.300]  my kids you know private a little boat they won't talk people at restaurants
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:17.980]  won't talk the cops won't talk but then I have Mexican nationals come up and you
[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:21.500]  know you can tell them you know wealthy type folks and they say I'm I listen to
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:27.100]  your show I'm shocked by the fear but also I think I've had more people come
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:31.420]  up to me down here than even in Austin I mean you know when you approach me
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:37.020]  you're a listener is my show heavily listened to down here but a lot of a lot
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:42.300]  of my friends and relatives do listen to your show you know there's there's one
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:47.020]  gentleman that has a radio show splash TV show and he says that the spin stops
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:51.380]  here let me tell you what there's no spin on your show what's going on is a
[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:55.940]  truth there's tons of facts out there people need to wake up and realize that
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:48:00.740]  our government's not doing enough you know it's crazy I mean there's parts
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:05.060]  along the along the 281 here in the real grand valley where you can actually I
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:09.780]  mean I'm no bread farf I mean but I could throw a rock and hit the river I
[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:13.340]  mean we that highway goes right along the river's edge I mean you can actually
[01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:17.660]  throw a rock and hit the Mexican side of the border and there's still areas where
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:22.340]  the where the wall hasn't gone up and you know you and I had discussed a little
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:26.220]  bit about about that wall there's there's sections that are still porous that's
[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:30.020]  still open and it was funny because my father and I were joking around you know
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:34.220]  it that that wall is probably going up to keep us in and and not let them in but
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:38.100]  to keep us in from leaving and then Ron Paul says the same thing to I just thought
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:44.660]  that was kind of eerie no no that's true it's just incredible now now let's get
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:50.700]  into this situation going on there's actually be national news that you know
[01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:53.620]  the firefight outside the football game but it's not it's just oh there was some
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:58.140]  cross-border things tonight and it's just getting worse and worse let's get
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:04.820]  into the camps because there's this big giant you know looks like a Super Bowl
[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:13.380]  stadium over there on the Bayside right outside South Padre tell us about Bayview
[01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:18.500]  detention center the tent city at Raymondville and the weird aircraft flying
[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:22.060]  in turning their lights off and things because the word we've gotten is is
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:25.380]  they're flying goodies in there and flying troops out and you were telling
[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:31.500]  me that you've got some sources in there yeah that's an actually it's an old CIA
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:37.220]  base that was a came to it came to an end as the Coal War also came to an end
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:42.420]  and it's called a portable Bayview Airport and ice runs the show out there
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:46.980]  it's an ice detention center for immigrants from around the world and you
[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:52.580]  know the funny thing is I'm gonna say it's probably been about 14 15 16 years
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:50:00.380]  back the county came to the the the the city of Port Isabel and made a
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:03.260]  presentation before the mayor and the commissioners and the city manager
[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:08.740]  requesting you know help and an okay to put a Doppler radar and and I couldn't
[01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:12.420]  quite understand why would they want a Doppler radar out there because this is
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:16.740]  long before this actually became the size of a camp that it is now it can
[01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:22.620]  house anywhere from 5 to 8,000 people easily and that airport is still usable
[01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:25.740]  they still use that airport out there you can land the biggest crap out there
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:30.380]  that that's built right now I mean it has no problem landing tons of planes out
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:36.420]  there if they had to and the the my sources tell me that there's training
[01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:40.940]  being conducted quite often out there and stay there stay there let's get to

[01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:19.500]  I mean each one of these articles is so bombshell Mitt Romney took advice from
[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:24.700]  Obama's eugenicist enthusiast science are that's a great headline but we might
[01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:31.580]  want to just change it to Romney took advice from Obama's science are I mean
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:37.700]  it's just it's bad enough continuing Operation Gladio returns dealing with
[01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:43.420]  stage terror attacks could Obama's class warfare cause a run on the banks big
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:48.020]  discussion article I did with Paul Watson key article CIA advertises its
[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:51.740]  takeover local law enforcement totally illegal but they're admitting they're
[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:56.340]  doing it that's an info wars.com US begins huge military maneuvers aimed at
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:55:01.020]  Iran big banks refuse to let people close accounts it's all coming up but I
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:06.540]  want to go back to David joining us from the South Texas Brownsville area where
[01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:12.860]  I met right now and he was getting into well break down without saying too much
[01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:15.140]  to people that work there because I don't people to be able to track back who you
[01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:20.900]  are let's just say you know people work out there that'll be simpler what's
[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:27.980]  going on out there please continue. Yeah there's a some type of training going on
[01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:31.780]  out there and it's not the only spot apparently there's two to three hot
[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:36.380]  spots along the river and valley where training is being conducted and the
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:41.820]  question is they won't allow anyone close enough to see who it is and they're
[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:48.000]  saying it's not American military that it's not American helicopters so it
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.900]  kind of you know well is that our guys or is it their guys and who are they and
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:56.420]  what are they training for and why is it that they're you know having to work out
[01:55:56.420 --> 01:56:00.980]  there at night and it's such a covert thing that no one needs to know I really
[01:56:00.980 --> 01:56:03.940]  do believe that the Mexican government and the US government are working
[01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:10.140]  together in on this and again why why the airport was almost abandoned back in
[01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:13.780]  that point and for them to put a doctor radar I'm sure they could say well it's
[01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:17.820]  for weather purposes. Sure I know you're being careful about what you say but
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:20.500]  last night you were talking about the aircraft coming in turning their lights
[01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:26.500]  off and specifically you were saying it's Mexican troops. Yes yeah and and I
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:30.180]  really do believe that I really do believe it is more than more more Mexican
[01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:33.580]  troops at all a period that are coming in here and they're training with our
[01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:38.780]  advisors as Obama and other presidents would call them I don't I don't believe
[01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:42.940]  that it's necessarily just our guys out there training but you can see when
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:48.740]  when aircraft takes off out there one one evening I was coming in by the driving
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:52.220]  by the area and I saw it like a really bright light and it kind of caught my
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:55.620]  attention so I pulled over and that light just hovered for a few seconds and
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:59.340]  then it just started swooping back down and then the lights just went dead and
[01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:03.260]  it what about the black helicopters the silent helicopters tell folks about
[01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:07.620]  those yeah I've had several sources tell me that you know they could be sitting
[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:12.860]  outside and this is within like a 15 to 25 mile range they could be on the
[01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:16.420]  middle of the afternoon or in the evening outside enjoying a glass of wine
[01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:19.980]  just watching the stars or whatever and they'll feel a gush of wind all of a
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:23.460]  sudden and and I've had three three people tell me this that they've turned
[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:26.620]  and looked up two in the evening like late in the evening and one in the
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:30.100]  middle of the afternoon and they turn around and look up and just a few yards
[01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:33.580]  away there's a helicopter just hovering over them the pilots just waving at the
[01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:38.780]  ground with no sound at all no sound at all well they admit they have those
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:42.020]  part of their stealth helicopter system that's the one of the ones they had
[01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:45.300]  crash out there but that was gray this was black you said your friend was
[01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:48.580]  looking for coins on the beach and it looked up and there was a black
[01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:54.300]  helicopter right above it yes yeah and he's really into military hardware you
[01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:58.420]  know aircraft and stuff like that and he said it looked it looked so much like a
[01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:02.740]  cobra helicopters what he said it was he said it looked exactly like a cobra
[01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:06.580]  helicopter I mean I've never seen a car I mean I I've seen the cobra helicopters
[01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:11.260]  up front I mean I've worked parallel with them in the military but never are
[01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:15.380]  they quiet and it just a he's still in shock to this day and this happened like
[01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:19.740]  maybe 20 years ago so I'd like to find out how long this technology has been
[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:23.340]  around you know there's been around a long time I'm not in Kansas anymore but
[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:26.260]  but talking to you you're saying the fear is here in America now it's
[01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:30.140]  spilling over and that the media is scared locally to report on it you talked
[01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:35.780]  about the people from the newspaper hung on the bridge stay there we're gonna

[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:07.060]  they're they've kind of toned back on their reporting but you know nice to
[02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:10.940]  you know speaking about the Twitter what we're talking about there were there
[02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:15.340]  were groups of people just going around and reporting tweeting out you know go
[02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:18.380]  around this way go around that way don't go through this street anywhere in
[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:25.220]  Mexico along the border here along the river and river and valley and they
[02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:29.060]  they found out who these people were and they sent them a message and the
[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:32.740]  sources I have are telling me that they actually killed two of the people that
[02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:37.180]  were tweeting they didn't they weren't involved in any way they were just
[02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:40.660]  tweeting for the sake of family and friends you know to avoid going no that's
[02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:46.500]  some separate people yes but they also killed the newspaper head absolutely I
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:50.580]  mean they it's it's it's public information they've reported how many
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:54.820]  they've killed just in the last three years they do not tell us the drug war
[02:02:54.820 --> 02:03:00.340]  going with the different factions you said it's really three cartels this is
[02:03:00.340 --> 02:03:06.380]  this is the way it's being broken down if you have the the the Sinaloa cartel
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:11.980]  which is the Chapa Guzmán cartel and then you have the Zeta cartel and then
[02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:15.140]  you've got all these that's what they're calling the third fraction of
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:18.820]  action there's these smaller little groups and they're trying to you know
[02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:23.620]  show big daddy look you know I've got the muscle you know I've gone out and
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:27.700]  eliminated some of your competition you know will you hook me up can I join
[02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:32.660]  your faction so it's like three ways and if you really want to get into it you
[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:36.980]  could count the military because they're being used as a tool also as a weapon so
[02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:41.260]  it's really there's a four-way war going on here it's it's it's this
[02:03:41.260 --> 02:03:47.140]  pandemonium they have no control over what they're doing over there amazing I
[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:51.580]  know you've got a ghost and I've got a guest coming up but I wanted you to
[02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:55.100]  finish up with your view on fast and furious get started on that and we'll
[02:03:55.100 --> 02:04:00.060]  finish up after the break if we have to the sources sources that I that I have
[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:05.540]  are telling me that when the fast and furious program initiated or whatever
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:08.700]  when they when the weapons actually crossed they crossed up at the at the
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:14.180]  northern part of Mexico the San Diego Tijuana area and it's kind of funny
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:19.100]  that those weapons have found themselves down on this side of the country the
[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:23.780]  sad fact when those three of Border Patrolmen got shot two of them died
[02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:28.500]  and one was gravely injured the the bullets that were that were taken out
[02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:32.620]  of their bodies were analyzed and they came back and traced them to the weapons
[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:37.860]  that were smuggled and sold across the border from fast and furious and it's
[02:04:37.860 --> 02:04:41.180]  funny because I they were believing they were that those weapons were gonna make
[02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:44.660]  it into the scene a little cartel you know they would stare on the area they
[02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:49.380]  would be able to trace it eventually they've ended up on this side of Mexico
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:54.580]  along the Gulf of Mexico the east side and you know what stay there I want to
[02:04:54.580 --> 02:04:57.340]  just spend two more minutes with you and get your overall view on what you

[02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:37.940]  so they know you're sick of the drug war they know statistically people want to
[02:08:37.940 --> 02:08:43.140]  decriminalize the argument is if you do to decriminalize all these drug gangs
[02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:48.380]  will live into other crimes they already are kidnapping extortion the metal
[02:08:48.380 --> 02:08:54.180]  theft we will be overtaken by this and the globalists plan to use this to bring
[02:08:54.180 --> 02:08:57.860]  down Mexico it's talking about it basically the whole show and I've got
[02:08:57.860 --> 02:09:01.420]  Iran news I've got the Federal Reserve trying to censor us news I don't know

[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:12.700]  totally green light a war this is the closest we've been all the analysts we've
[02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:17.460]  interviewed have agreed the Colonel Schaefer answered Schaefer said well
[02:09:17.460 --> 02:09:21.260]  the request has been made for the new war and yeah they want it but the Pentagon
[02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:26.580]  is saying no this is incredible the stuff's going on it Obama needs this
[02:09:26.580 --> 02:09:30.660]  distraction from fast and furious all of it finishing up with our our source
[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:36.060]  number one of infugues and for a few news items our source whose info checks out
[02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:39.940]  with all my research you've got shootouts by high school football games
[02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:47.340]  here in the border area in the US in the town of actually pull up the town name
[02:09:47.340 --> 02:09:52.580]  for you Rio Grande City you've got the Mexican military operating a narcotics
[02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:56.940]  trafficking by the US government you name it in the final equation you talk
[02:09:56.940 --> 02:09:59.780]  about the Mexican military being corrupt they've been caught the Mexican
[02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:05.780]  government how does Felipe Calderon tie into all this where is it going I mean
[02:10:05.780 --> 02:10:10.220]  silica steel former DE agents told me six years ago he says Los Zettis is
[02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:15.980]  trying to recruit me they're training at the outside the King Ranch in Kingsville
[02:10:15.980 --> 02:10:21.140]  they've got secret bases down there in South Padre and he was talking about
[02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:24.660]  this base out here they're gonna have a huge war between the cartels he
[02:10:24.660 --> 02:10:28.960]  stabilized Mexico then the US will invade then the ATF came and set him up
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:35.120]  put him in prison now all for guns saying he was selling shotguns but the
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:38.980]  point is selling had trained opera operators all over the world you know
[02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:44.060]  to quote fight other drug cartels when he was in the DEA that's on record you
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:48.820]  know him out there training in Colombia all over from my research the globalist
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:53.180]  are trying to knock out their competition but there's so many people who
[02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:56.940]  aren't intimidated and who are poor in Mexico over a hundred million people now
[02:10:56.940 --> 02:11:02.340]  they're just willing to die super macho super tough and now this weird culture
[02:11:02.340 --> 02:11:06.860]  of death the skinny one this worship of the grim reaper it just sounds like
[02:11:06.860 --> 02:11:11.900]  some type of psychopathic tyranny like we saw in Russia Nazi Germany pull pod
[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:16.780]  Fidel Castro has opened up and that it's only getting worse but what's your
[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:21.660]  final equation take on this fast and furious how it all ties together what
[02:11:21.660 --> 02:11:26.220]  your military and law enforcement sources are telling you okay let me start
[02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:30.740]  with this what you're talking about the metals being stolen absolutely true I
[02:11:30.740 --> 02:11:33.980]  know four people that are in the industry along the border here they
[02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:37.500]  some record amounts they cannot scrap enough metal because as soon as they get
[02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:43.140]  across the border it's being held up and fees and stolen by the cartels to the
[02:11:43.140 --> 02:11:48.740]  University of Texas in Brownsville has actually gone out and pulled I believe
[02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:53.980]  it was a 50 caliber round out of their building it fits about 250 maybe 300
[02:11:53.980 --> 02:11:58.620]  yards across that it's closest from the border in Matamotos to Brownsville
[02:11:58.620 --> 02:12:03.420]  they've taken it out of the walls and have had to cancel college day education
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:08.820]  at one point I think actually three times of both governments know what's
[02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:13.100]  going on they're both in on it how do they know what's going on on a consistent
[02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:18.460]  basis it's all a big it's all of just a big joke on both of all of us here both
[02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:21.540]  sides know what's going on the Mexican government comes out and points fingers
[02:12:21.540 --> 02:12:25.780]  at us the president over there says it's the US's fault but I'll see what if they
[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:29.980]  try to legalize drugs in Mexico you'll see an all-out war because you're taking
[02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:33.140]  away the only livelihood the majority of those people are doing down there that
[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:36.740]  are involved in illicit work that's that's the bottom line yeah but see it's
[02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:39.860]  damned if you do damned if you don't justice be done may the heavens fall
[02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:44.460]  letting them have the drug monies only empowering them anyways to then start into
[02:12:44.460 --> 02:12:49.300]  new crimes you see my point yeah exactly so and the way I'm thinking is if they
[02:12:49.300 --> 02:12:53.060]  try to legalize it it's gonna really tick them off and they're gonna go out on
[02:12:53.060 --> 02:12:57.060]  a mass killing spree you cannot they cannot try to legalize it over there
[02:12:57.060 --> 02:13:00.380]  because they're just gonna get more you're you're messing around with the
[02:13:00.380 --> 02:13:04.380]  bees and you go to that nest and what is it gonna end though the bees are getting
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:08.780]  really fat and mean off the government making drugs illegal see how this is a
[02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:14.580]  monster though that just sucks you into it exactly you know in another I was
[02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:18.340]  being a few nights ago I was watching the pastor on television his name is
[02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:21.820]  Perry Stoney he said the 300 most powerful and richest families of the
[02:13:21.820 --> 02:13:25.300]  world are the ones that are leading all this they're the ones that are setting
[02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:29.940]  all this up and it just boggled my mind to hear this guy that has such an awesome
[02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:34.780]  reputation a man of God saying that 300 families of the most that lead in the
[02:13:34.780 --> 02:13:38.340]  world are the ones that are setting this stuff up I mean I mean we can that's the
[02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:41.940]  committee of 300 that's actually accurate that's kind of the global overall
[02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:45.180]  consortium it's really about 20 families but then there's a couple hundred
[02:13:45.180 --> 02:13:48.540]  under them that serve them it does come out to a committee of 300 that is one of
[02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:53.740]  the top globalist groups but here's the issue just like study how the West
[02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:59.780]  brought down China when China made drugs illegal in the end it brought the
[02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:04.140]  country down that's what's happening here is the opium wars they're doing it
[02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:08.060]  and they mean to bring the US down with it I'm telling you we got a bike the
[02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:12.860]  bullet and go ahead and totally decriminalize it doesn't mean legalize
[02:14:12.860 --> 02:14:18.660]  and it's just gonna have to be an all-out war then against crime and the
[02:14:18.660 --> 02:14:22.740]  answer is arm the Mexican people have a total second amendment and I'll
[02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:26.660]  guarantee it's because you got 99% of people don't own guns that now the
[02:14:26.660 --> 02:14:29.740]  cartels could feed on them what would happen if every citizen in Mexico had a
[02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:32.220]  firearm was trained how to use it well what happened when people came to their
[02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:36.180]  door to shake them down then it'd be totally different over there it would be
[02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:39.660]  totally different because a lot of those people are actually hard honest
[02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:44.260]  working people I know they really are it's it's it's it's ironic then you know
[02:14:44.260 --> 02:14:46.660]  going back to what you were talking about a while ago about those wall
[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:51.260]  streeters you know you look at the history in Rome the Rome collapse because
[02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:54.460]  they were going after that top one or two percent that had all the money that
[02:14:54.460 --> 02:14:57.820]  were creating the businesses and blah blah blah they went out they did the same
[02:14:57.820 --> 02:15:01.420]  thing and we're following the same puts those of old Rome we're going after the
[02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:06.100]  people that have the money that create the jobs it's it's stupid and those I
[02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:09.700]  see those kids getting interviewed on TV they have no idea why the hell they're
[02:15:09.700 --> 02:15:13.780]  out there they have no idea why they're out there it that's like seeds being
[02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:19.740]  spread across the wind that nobody seems to have one centralized idea but what's
[02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:24.060]  going on no in fact if you go to info wars.com and I've seen these signs it
[02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:28.500]  says redistribute or revolution it's clear David we're going to have to have
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:33.700]  you back on in summation in 30 seconds how do you see this ending because do
[02:15:33.700 --> 02:15:36.900]  you agree with me clearly it's only getting worse it's only going to get
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:41.900]  worse I don't see an end in sight I don't see an end in sight it's it would
[02:15:41.900 --> 02:15:46.860]  take maybe someone getting elected that would have the guts to say you know what
[02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:50.420]  we're not going to stand by we're not going to be participating this and we're
[02:15:50.420 --> 02:15:54.020]  going to we're going to shut the border off and again the one thing that really
[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:57.780]  irritates me is why I agree you shut the border off that'll shut the profits off
[02:15:57.780 --> 02:16:00.900]  on both sides but that's what that'll never happen because the banks want that
[02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:04.980]  money and they're going to use it to destabilize Mexico and and not for
[02:16:04.980 --> 02:16:09.540]  America to take over Mexico for the globalist to occupy it with our troops
[02:16:09.540 --> 02:16:15.220]  yes and again they create a crisis where it'll get so bad you'll know it's a
[02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:18.500]  setup but you'll still have to support the troops going in because you don't
[02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:24.940]  want to be kidnapped right right right I I mean really I mean all you got to do
[02:16:24.940 --> 02:16:30.020]  is turn on the news down in real Grand Valley and watch I mean it's online two
[02:16:30.020 --> 02:16:34.940]  biggest ones are KRGV and KGBT and they stream online and you can see it it's
[02:16:34.940 --> 02:16:39.140]  that there's nightly things going on over here it's a daily thing that you can
[02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:43.500]  catch it on the news it's it's every single day it's everything so it is in
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:47.740]  Mexico being occupied by the North American Union security force not by
[02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:51.060]  America and both our countries get rolled into a continental security
[02:16:51.060 --> 02:16:55.220]  perimeter unbelievable sir thank you so much for spending time with us no

[02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:15.660]  actually do something and be honest with people you idiots allowed them to make
[02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:22.300]  drugs illegal so organized crime could take over and now it's destroying us but
[02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:25.300]  on top of it the Mexican government is so evil they're about to forcibly
[02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:29.660]  inoculate all the girls in their country with a vaccine known to kill people and
[02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:34.740]  sterilize them God help us man God help us all right we're gonna go to
[02:17:34.740 --> 02:17:38.020]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs here for the balance of the hour and I've had big
[02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:41.940]  breaking news from down here at the border here today I've also got fellow
[02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:45.900]  reserved news coming up at the end and this war news with Iran they definitely
[02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:48.980]  want it but the good news is people in government are blowing the whistle on it
[02:17:48.980 --> 02:17:53.660]  and trying to back it down we'll have more on that on all of it tonight seven
[02:17:53.660 --> 02:17:57.020]  o'clock I'll be on my own show with Aaron Dyches co-hosting with me in
[02:17:57.020 --> 02:18:03.300]  fours nightly news coming up this evening I wanted to get Ben Fuchs on again
[02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:08.020]  because now they're openly saying they're gonna go after anybody selling
[02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:11.620]  vitamins and minerals now they're saying they're going after anybody selling
[02:18:11.620 --> 02:18:15.580]  food on a street corner or tomatoes or whatever now they're going after all
[02:18:15.580 --> 02:18:19.780]  the lemonade stands it's all about totally cracking down and I wanted to
[02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:23.740]  talk to him about the attacks on vitamins and minerals and this attempt to
[02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:28.620]  forcibly inoculate people and get his view on what inoculations are doing to
[02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:32.260]  people we're about to go to break but been great to have you here just putting
[02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:35.220]  bookends on this sitting there the last 15 minutes or whatever you've been
[02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:39.380]  holding what did you think of our report from the Texas Mexico border where a
[02:18:39.380 --> 02:18:44.020]  failed state is now collapsing into the United States well you know what I
[02:18:44.020 --> 02:18:48.300]  always I always do this I follow the money to change to change I see who's
[02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:51.820]  benefiting from from any time there's something going on in the news and
[02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:55.220]  anytime there's some kind of scandal going on anytime we see something about
[02:18:55.220 --> 02:18:58.940]  the police state or encroachment of government I want to know who's where
[02:18:58.940 --> 02:19:02.380]  the money who's paying for all this and who's benefiting from a financial
[02:19:02.380 --> 02:19:06.020]  standpoint and somewhere along the line you're gonna find bankers and some fair
[02:19:06.020 --> 02:19:09.380]  or somewhere along the line you're gonna find industrialists and somewhere along
[02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:12.140]  the line you're gonna find big corporations and you're gonna find the
[02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:15.300]  people being screwed and that's usually what happens that's right they get
[02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:18.740]  their huge profits out of conflict because they're attacking both Mexico
[02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:22.780]  and the US people think of wars is one side of the other the globalist play
[02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:26.500]  people off against each other that's why they're in control only a few thousand
[02:19:26.500 --> 02:19:31.860]  of them then we're gonna go to break here but how would you fix in just a
[02:19:31.860 --> 02:19:36.140]  sentence what's happening in Mexico how would I fix what's happening in Mexico
[02:19:36.140 --> 02:19:41.420]  well first of all I would we have to as individuals and as as single citizens we
[02:19:41.420 --> 02:19:45.820]  have to understand that the government is not here to protect individual rights
[02:19:45.820 --> 02:19:50.180]  they're there to protect themselves as all establishments do so we have to we
[02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:53.260]  gotta go right we'll come back with more on the other side the answer is arm all
[02:19:53.260 --> 02:20:02.460]  the Mexicans with fully automatic weapons this is Alex Jones with five good

[02:23:57.180 --> 02:24:11.620]  com now what has allowed this crisis in Mexico to take place is a disarmed
[02:24:11.620 --> 02:24:16.460]  population for the limited populations armed corrupt government a public
[02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:19.980]  train to give in to corrupt government and then when another corrupt mafia
[02:24:19.980 --> 02:24:24.940]  comes in and starts fighting with the other mafia civilization ends and that's
[02:24:24.940 --> 02:24:28.860]  what's going to happen to the United States that's where this country is
[02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:34.940]  headed and you got big special interest coming in big pharma big agra
[02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:38.140]  openly lobbying in Europe and here in the US they've done it in Europe to
[02:24:38.140 --> 02:24:42.140]  start restricting vitamins and minerals over the counter they're telling
[02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:46.700]  pharmacist compounding pharmacist real pharmacist all over the country who can
[02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:50.380]  you know give you regular drugs are also old-fashioned ones that they can't
[02:24:50.380 --> 02:24:54.660]  compound basic things anymore they're shutting down their competition it's all
[02:24:54.660 --> 02:24:59.980]  about big cartels shutting down their competition and then now you've got the
[02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:03.540]  Occupy Wall Street people been I want to get your take on this we'll get in the
[02:25:03.540 --> 02:25:07.900]  latest attacks on vitamins and minerals with you coming out and just saying yeah
[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:12.340]  redistribute and then Obama represents this yes I want to redistribute but all
[02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:15.980]  he wants to do is rebroad distribute the middle classes money like Herman Cain
[02:25:15.980 --> 02:25:20.180]  wants with new taxes to the Federal Reserve what is it these redistribute
[02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:24.180]  people can't get I mean it's it it's admitted now the Democrats are running
[02:25:24.180 --> 02:25:29.100]  this you know they're they're a product of this infantilization of humanity and
[02:25:29.100 --> 02:25:32.700]  especially of Americans that's been going on for the last 60 or 70 years
[02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:37.140]  where everybody expects the government to take care of them but my message has
[02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:41.780]  been and consistently has been is that individuals have to take the ball and
[02:25:41.780 --> 02:25:45.660]  they're into their own court in terms of health these Wall Street people occupy
[02:25:45.660 --> 02:25:49.420]  Wall Street people have to be have to begin to produce something have to begin
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:55.100]  to create something have to begin to create some value and so they'll get
[02:25:55.100 --> 02:25:59.260]  compensated in equal measure to what kind of value they're creating they're
[02:25:59.260 --> 02:26:02.140]  out there screaming give me this and give me that and the government should be
[02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:05.420]  taking care of me and I'm not getting taken care of and Wall Street should be
[02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:09.700]  redistributing their wealth and it's not fair get out and do
[02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:14.060]  something and create some value put something back into the culture and
[02:26:14.060 --> 02:26:17.740]  that's what I see when I see these kids screaming is I see people just saying me
[02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:21.700]  me me give me more give me more give me more and it's just the logical end
[02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:25.460]  result of this infantilization of Americans that has been going on since
[02:26:25.460 --> 02:26:29.020]  that at least yeah they're domesticating us and it's shutting down our entire
[02:26:29.020 --> 02:26:33.580]  society and as we get more globalism or collectivism they scream louder saying
[02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:39.260]  give me goodies it doesn't deliver it collectivism delivers North Korea China
[02:26:39.260 --> 02:26:42.900]  and places like that and Russia they've got to get it through their head now
[02:26:42.900 --> 02:26:46.340]  we're gonna go to break her in a moment long segment coming up but I just wanted
[02:26:46.340 --> 02:26:50.300]  to get you on because there's so I see articles every day now where the system
[02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:55.180]  swat teaming people and rating them and going after vitamins and organic food
[02:26:55.180 --> 02:26:59.140]  and not wanting us to be able to label stuff that's not organic and trying to
[02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:04.260]  force vaccines on us I mean this is war people have to ask themselves why is the
[02:27:04.260 --> 02:27:08.220]  government so interested in bringing armed swat teams to people who are
[02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:12.140]  selling sweeteners or people who are selling herbs or people who are so who
[02:27:12.140 --> 02:27:14.700]  could contribute the information on how to use these things why is the
[02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:17.860]  government so vested in protecting their interests that they're willing to send
[02:27:17.860 --> 02:27:26.260]  armed swat team members to to a little old ladies who are selling stevia what
[02:27:26.260 --> 02:27:29.620]  are some of the other big trends you're seeing I mean I know you're the real
[02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:33.740]  expert on this I just see it everywhere this this is well the latest thing the
[02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:38.060]  latest thing is now the Food and Drug Administration is interested in regulating
[02:27:38.060 --> 02:27:41.900]  new dietary ingredients they're making a tougher and tougher for supplement
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:45.500]  companies to come out with new and better supplements and they're not doing it
[02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:50.140]  outright what they're doing it they're doing it by changing the way that that
[02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:53.860]  these companies label and the way these companies announced their new ingredients
[02:27:53.860 --> 02:27:56.620]  so a company will announce their new ingredient the FDA will hold on to the
[02:27:56.620 --> 02:28:00.860]  announcement and hold on to to the application if they deem that this new
[02:28:00.860 --> 02:28:04.020]  supplement is somehow a threat so that's the latest thing now it's not just
[02:28:04.020 --> 02:28:07.620]  up now such as regular supplements it's new supplements that these companies
[02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:11.900]  want to come out with new dietary supplements it's called the it's called
[02:28:11.900 --> 02:28:17.100]  the NDI the the new diet you know they've got the new freedom initiative that Bush
[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:20.940]  started where they said they want to put half of kids on psychotropic now
[02:28:20.940 --> 02:28:26.340]  Reuters is reporting just up at info wars.com doctors want to diagnose ADHD
[02:28:26.340 --> 02:28:31.140]  made up uses because you're eating unhealthy food starting at age four yeah
[02:28:31.140 --> 02:28:35.620]  if I give my kids Coca-Cola they suddenly get ADHD or if I feed them you know
[02:28:35.620 --> 02:28:40.660]  msg they suddenly get out of control it's called you know being being having
[02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:44.940]  trouble in their brains chemistry now they want to make your kids in school at
[02:28:44.940 --> 02:28:49.500]  age four being diagnosed they can force deadly speed on them
[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:52.820]  these diagnoses these mental diagnoses you know how they come up with them they
[02:28:52.820 --> 02:28:56.380]  vote on them they a bunch of psychiatrists get together and determine
[02:28:56.380 --> 02:28:58.900]  that they're going to make up these new names for new diagnoses and they put
[02:28:58.900 --> 02:29:02.620]  them together in a book called the the DSM the latest DSM is going to have new
[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:06.460]  diseases like obsessive shopping disorder and excessive internet use
[02:29:06.460 --> 02:29:11.020]  disorder and all of these are going to be medicated so the mental diagnoses are
[02:29:11.020 --> 02:29:15.300]  the most insidious of all the disease states all mean to me as a pharmacist
[02:29:15.300 --> 02:29:18.140]  all disease states can be boiled down into either the body building up or
[02:29:18.140 --> 02:29:22.900]  breaking down but chemical imbalances in the brain is some marketing term that a
[02:29:22.900 --> 02:29:26.660]  drug company invented there's no such thing as a chemical imbalance in the
[02:29:26.660 --> 02:29:30.260]  brain because the body's the brain's chemistry is always changing there's no
[02:29:30.260 --> 02:29:34.220]  one balance to the brain's chemistry well that's like the global warming people
[02:29:34.220 --> 02:29:39.260]  now teaching school kids that seasons are abnormal and that any weather changes
[02:29:39.260 --> 02:29:43.300]  abnormal I mean this is ridiculous
[02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:48.100]  well they ride back with Ben Felix great point on that I'm gonna go back to
[02:29:48.100 --> 02:29:52.940]  that band your brain's always changing we're on the March the Empire's on the

[02:32:10.060 --> 02:32:14.940]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home turning
[02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:19.740]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[02:32:19.740 --> 02:32:24.900]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:32:24.900 --> 02:32:29.420]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:34.100]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:32:34.100 --> 02:32:38.140]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[02:32:38.140 --> 02:32:41.820]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:46.900]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[02:32:46.900 --> 02:32:53.340]  a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars
[02:32:53.340 --> 02:32:58.460]  dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet
[02:32:58.460 --> 02:33:12.140]  dot TV
[02:33:12.140 --> 02:33:16.900]  you know more and more the problem I'm having is being able to cover it all
[02:33:16.900 --> 02:33:22.820]  when I first saw city bank refusing to give a woman her money who was at the
[02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:26.420]  bank last week I thought that you know there's no way I just saw that and now
[02:33:26.420 --> 02:33:30.580]  we put an article up this morning from George Washington's blog that's got a
[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:34.780]  scores of videos and then I went into the search and found a whole bunch more
[02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:40.660]  of Occupy Wall Street folks who actually went out and went into city bank
[02:33:40.660 --> 02:33:43.940]  Goldman Sachs that's more of a brokerage bank but they've got bank
[02:33:43.940 --> 02:33:48.860]  accounts to JP Morgan Bank of America and demand their money and they just say
[02:33:48.860 --> 02:33:54.980]  no get out of here and call the cops on them man I mean I don't have that much
[02:33:54.980 --> 02:33:58.980]  money but you know we've got a sizable sum in bank accounts to run info wars
[02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:04.860]  dot com and pay the employees I guess if they had a gold counting house in town
[02:34:04.860 --> 02:34:08.100]  we could pay him in that or something but I mean it's just getting the points
[02:34:08.100 --> 02:34:11.100]  for you to the point where you can't trust the banks can't trust any of it
[02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:16.100]  and these kleptocrats are running the entire society they're devaluing the
[02:34:16.100 --> 02:34:21.740]  currencies Ben Fuchs is our guest pharmacist Ben you were making a really
[02:34:21.740 --> 02:34:27.300]  good point there as we went to break that they say any any change in the brain
[02:34:27.300 --> 02:34:31.460]  is an imbalance when you get depressed or whatever they've got all these
[02:34:31.460 --> 02:34:34.540]  studies were natural foods vitamins minerals that you have talked about
[02:34:34.540 --> 02:34:38.020]  in fact perhaps you shouldn't talk about it in double-blind studies I've seen
[02:34:38.020 --> 02:34:42.020]  are many times better than Prozac or those variants of serotonin reuptake
[02:34:42.020 --> 02:34:46.020]  inhibitors those studies have been out for decades in fact sir the serotonin
[02:34:46.020 --> 02:34:49.260]  reuptake inhibitors are linked to increased suicide now they have to put
[02:34:49.260 --> 02:34:52.940]  on the insert whereas what st. John's ward I know actually helps because it's
[02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:58.620]  natural but then they want to restrict that but I mean I've always felt if I
[02:34:58.620 --> 02:35:02.460]  get a little sun or I'm kind of down in the winter if I go climb up hill
[02:35:02.460 --> 02:35:09.620]  somewhere or you know go clean out the garage I feel great or have I just get
[02:35:09.620 --> 02:35:14.340]  out and have some fun and then I'm not depressed anymore it's the times I hadn't
[02:35:14.340 --> 02:35:18.900]  been taking action in my life probably the two years I was in college and my
[02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:23.740]  mind knew this was worthless I wasn't learning anything from this I needed to
[02:35:23.740 --> 02:35:26.580]  quit doing it as soon as I just went out and quit college and got a couple more
[02:35:26.580 --> 02:35:30.660]  jobs and started my media operation I felt great I've never felt bad since
[02:35:30.660 --> 02:35:34.340]  then if I do something wrong occasionally and think about it later I feel
[02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:37.540]  guilty as soon as and depressed as soon as I admit up to what I've done
[02:35:37.540 --> 02:35:41.020]  psychologically and spiritually I feel great I mean but they're telling you
[02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:45.220]  should never feel bad they're saying we want to drug all of our soldiers well
[02:35:45.220 --> 02:35:48.180]  because they feel bad about what they've done well they should they should
[02:35:48.180 --> 02:35:52.500]  just repent and then you won't feel bad anymore I mean what can you say I mean
[02:35:52.500 --> 02:35:56.020]  you really hit something key here just like the global warming people say
[02:35:56.020 --> 02:35:59.180]  they're now teaching school kids we've shown this on the website in news
[02:35:59.180 --> 02:36:05.300]  articles that seasons are aren't real and and and I mean aren't normal and that
[02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:10.180]  you shouldn't have changes in weather that any change that any weather change
[02:36:10.180 --> 02:36:14.660]  any climate change is different the only thing that doesn't change is changed
[02:36:14.660 --> 02:36:21.380]  been we're treating normal conditions like sadness and depression as if they're
[02:36:21.380 --> 02:36:24.980]  medical conditions nobody gets a serotonin test when they go into the
[02:36:24.980 --> 02:36:28.580]  psychiatrist's office and has a blood test done to see how much serotonin is
[02:36:28.580 --> 02:36:31.940]  in their brain they make up this term chemical imbalance to imply that
[02:36:31.940 --> 02:36:36.140]  something is wrong with your brain the brain is always changing so there's no
[02:36:36.140 --> 02:36:40.740]  chemical balance to be imbalanced in the first place and then to take a poison and
[02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:45.460]  make no mistake about it Alex these things are poisons whether you call them
[02:36:45.460 --> 02:36:48.500]  pharmaceuticals or whether you call them medicines or whether you call them
[02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:52.940]  drugs I call them poisons when you knock out a system as fundamental as the
[02:36:52.940 --> 02:36:57.020]  serotonin system this is one of the most fundamental systems in the body and
[02:36:57.020 --> 02:37:00.980]  when you block re-uptake of serotonin you're playing with fire and as a
[02:37:00.980 --> 02:37:05.420]  pharmacist I can tell you I'm not surprised when people on SSRIs go out
[02:37:05.420 --> 02:37:09.620]  and shoot up the school or or shoot up the military base or commit suicide you
[02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:13.420]  are playing with fire when you start to tweak your neurochemistry in addition
[02:37:13.420 --> 02:37:17.220]  well isn't it aren't serotonin re-uptake inhibitors I've read the insert aren't
[02:37:17.220 --> 02:37:22.340]  they in the hallucinogen psychotropic class the the hallucinogen hallucinogens
[02:37:22.340 --> 02:37:27.300]  LSD and LSD drugs like LSD work with the serotonin system in the brain but
[02:37:27.300 --> 02:37:31.300]  Alex most of the serotonin system is not even in your brain it's in your
[02:37:31.300 --> 02:37:34.700]  digestive system and it's in other systems of the body so when you take a
[02:37:34.700 --> 02:37:39.020]  serotonin re-uptake inhibitor it's not only affecting your brain it's affecting
[02:37:39.020 --> 02:37:42.980]  your entire nervous system as well as your enteric or gut-interp nervous
[02:37:42.980 --> 02:37:48.260]  system as well you cannot take a drug and simply expect it to be a magic bullet
[02:37:48.260 --> 02:37:52.700]  that's going to be directed to your specific symptom in addition what we're
[02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:56.740]  treating are not even diseases Alex every four or five years psychiatrists get
[02:37:56.740 --> 02:38:01.620]  together and they vote on what the latest new diagnosis will be and today they've
[02:38:01.620 --> 02:38:04.620]  come out with more than 20 I know because we've read them on air before we've
[02:38:04.620 --> 02:38:08.020]  written news articles about it we're not liking government corruption not
[02:38:08.020 --> 02:38:12.700]  trusting government as a mental illness that it's you know defiant defying the
[02:38:12.700 --> 02:38:16.900]  order let's expand on that because you just pointed out I've seen cases of
[02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:20.200]  this where somebody has lead poisoning mercury poisoning some type of
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:24.620]  industrial poisoning they're acting crazy and the system will just commit
[02:38:24.620 --> 02:38:30.460]  them instead of actually testing their blood and helping he laid it out I mean
[02:38:30.460 --> 02:38:35.620]  this is just incredible it's it's take all the pink program everywhere breast
[02:38:35.620 --> 02:38:39.460]  cancer the highest in the world in the US next in Europe all the places where
[02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:44.460]  they vaccinate all the places where they have GMO and instead of looking at why
[02:38:44.460 --> 02:38:48.040]  this is happening they just say let's raise money to find a cure well I mean
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:51.900]  that's like saying find a cure after a truck runs over you you know for you
[02:38:51.900 --> 02:38:55.940]  know how to cure somebody being run over by a Mack truck how about not being run
[02:38:55.940 --> 02:39:00.820]  over by the truck how about we look at why this is epidemic because again the
[02:39:00.820 --> 02:39:05.140]  fact this is such a blaring crime but it's in plain view that the system never
[02:39:05.140 --> 02:39:08.860]  wants to find out why you're having this problem they want to quote treat it
[02:39:08.860 --> 02:39:13.900]  showing the whole system is designed to not actually help you but to treat you
[02:39:13.900 --> 02:39:19.540]  Alex Kentucky fried chicken sponsors race for the cure okay that's the people
[02:39:19.540 --> 02:39:22.700]  who are paying for race for the cure the people who are causing the disease in
[02:39:22.700 --> 02:39:27.140]  the first place look Alex you cannot expect to eat the way we eat you cannot
[02:39:27.140 --> 02:39:31.620]  expect to be as nutritionally deficient as we are and not end up with breast
[02:39:31.620 --> 02:39:35.220]  cancer and not end up with degenerative diseases it doesn't it doesn't make any
[02:39:35.220 --> 02:39:39.020]  sense and so the message that I want to promote and that you're helping us
[02:39:39.020 --> 02:39:44.780]  promote is the idea that if you take care of your basic needs your God given
[02:39:44.780 --> 02:39:49.180]  needs such as oxygen and blowing out carbon dioxide and making sure you're
[02:39:49.180 --> 02:39:52.620]  getting appropriate nutrition you're not going to need the race for the cure
[02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:56.180]  you're not going to need the serotonin reuptake inhibitors you're not going to
[02:39:56.180 --> 02:39:59.340]  need to interface with the medical model and the medical community and you'll
[02:39:59.340 --> 02:40:04.740]  be have more power and more clear-headedness to be able to fight this
[02:40:04.740 --> 02:40:08.940]  kind of tyranny and that's the message here and the only way to do it is to
[02:40:08.940 --> 02:40:13.740]  participate in your own health the human body is a healing system it is
[02:40:13.740 --> 02:40:18.060]  designed divinely to heal itself on a moment-to-moment basis it doesn't need
[02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:22.340]  doctors it doesn't need drugs it doesn't need hospitals it doesn't need
[02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:26.620]  insurance companies it needs good nutrition it needs solid food it needs
[02:40:26.620 --> 02:40:31.540]  clear air it needs clean water it needs to be able to blow out toxins through
[02:40:31.540 --> 02:40:36.780]  carbon dioxide it needs a functioning liver and short of that we are condemned
[02:40:36.780 --> 02:40:40.620]  short of that we are going to be walking into the the hospitals and the
[02:40:40.620 --> 02:40:43.500]  pharmacies and we're going to be enriching the medical model and we're
[02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:48.060]  not going to be able to have the wherewithal to fight this kind of tyranny
[02:40:48.060 --> 02:40:55.860]  well you're absolutely right Ben and it just gets crazier and crazier how
[02:40:55.860 --> 02:41:00.020]  they're trying to force this on people I haven't talked to you in a month or so
[02:41:00.020 --> 02:41:04.300]  on air since California and the governor signed the law to let them
[02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:07.740]  brainwash young children without their parents knowing and quote get them to
[02:41:07.740 --> 02:41:11.660]  consent to the deadly Gardasil shot which they admit on its own insert doesn't
[02:41:11.660 --> 02:41:16.580]  even protect you from the cancer it claims it's helping you from but then
[02:41:16.580 --> 02:41:20.260]  they showed newscast of them going to homeschoolers doors and saying we're
[02:41:20.260 --> 02:41:23.980]  here to give your child a shot it's the law so they'll come tell parents it's
[02:41:23.980 --> 02:41:28.700]  the law to take it when it's not the law then obviously they're gonna tell the
[02:41:28.700 --> 02:41:32.700]  kids it's the law and force them to take it I mean this is this is reaching
[02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:36.940]  like the forced sterilization level like we saw in this country under eugenics
[02:41:36.940 --> 02:41:40.500]  what's your view on that how should that be handled here's my view on that
[02:41:40.500 --> 02:41:44.140]  Alex when you and I were growing up did you hear the human papillomavirus was
[02:41:44.140 --> 02:41:46.900]  there a problem with the human papillomavirus with girls in your school
[02:41:46.900 --> 02:41:49.420]  did you ever hear of any kids in your school having the human papillomavirus
[02:41:49.420 --> 02:41:54.340]  I didn't okay the problem is is that our immune systems are so shot because of
[02:41:54.340 --> 02:41:57.460]  the crappy food we're eating and our immune systems are so shot because of
[02:41:57.460 --> 02:42:02.580]  our lack of basic nutrients like vitamin C and like to be complex and like good
[02:42:02.580 --> 02:42:08.100]  protein that everything that comes along we become a victim to viruses and
[02:42:08.100 --> 02:42:12.700]  bacteria's cannot exist in a healthy powerful terrain a terrain that has an
[02:42:12.700 --> 02:42:17.220]  immune system that's strong so our job as individuals is to make sure that our
[02:42:17.220 --> 02:42:21.980]  bodies have the strength to be able to withstand bacteria withstand viruses we
[02:42:21.980 --> 02:42:26.020]  live in an environment in competition with these things but we have an immune
[02:42:26.020 --> 02:42:30.780]  system that has been divinely given to us that is able to in an intelligent
[02:42:30.780 --> 02:42:36.860]  fashion select these bacteria and select these of viruses for destruction we
[02:42:36.860 --> 02:42:41.140]  have cells and we have chemicals inside our body that's can specifically target
[02:42:41.140 --> 02:42:45.220]  viruses viruses can specifically target bacteria and our job is to up
[02:42:45.220 --> 02:42:50.320]  regulate that system almost everything we do on a regular basis in terms of what
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:54.300]  we eat and how we nourish ourselves doesn't not only doesn't up regulate the
[02:42:54.300 --> 02:42:59.740]  system it almost specifically shuts the system down every time you eat a teaspoon
[02:42:59.740 --> 02:43:03.940]  of sugar your immune system becomes compromised for hours and most of us are
[02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:07.980]  eating on the order of 20 to 30 of these teaspoons every day of course we're
[02:43:07.980 --> 02:43:12.420]  going to become victim to bacteria and viruses but the answer is not Gardasil
[02:43:12.420 --> 02:43:18.620]  the answer is to change the way we treat ourselves to up regulate and maximize
[02:43:18.620 --> 02:43:22.700]  and build up our bodies inherent healing properties and our bodies and
[02:43:22.700 --> 02:43:27.420]  inherent defense systems the immune system we shouldn't need Gardasil we
[02:43:27.420 --> 02:43:31.460]  shouldn't need these vaccines we need to learn and we need to understand how our
[02:43:31.460 --> 02:43:36.220]  bodies work that's the most that's the most dire need we have today is
[02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:40.740]  understanding this magical system this divine system called the human body and
[02:43:40.740 --> 02:43:46.100]  understanding how it works and understand now a pharmacist been as the
[02:43:46.100 --> 02:43:51.220]  public begins to learn about this and tries to get back to basics the system
[02:43:51.220 --> 02:43:55.820]  is coming in trying to regulate it and shut it down and at this point in the
[02:43:55.820 --> 02:44:03.020]  interview I want to just put the pitch out to listeners that this is a win-win-win-win-win
[02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:07.380]  I researched for years and I've been exercising a lot more and I've lost
[02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:11.580]  about 10 pounds the last three four months and I'm trying to get in better
[02:44:11.580 --> 02:44:16.780]  shape my wife is really loving it she's gone on the entire line of young
[02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:21.500]  Jebedee products that are available at info wars team dot com and we have
[02:44:21.500 --> 02:44:27.220]  banners up at info wars dot com but it's simple info wars team dot com and when
[02:44:27.220 --> 02:44:33.660]  people do purchase whether it's heart health general you know vitamins minerals
[02:44:33.660 --> 02:44:40.900]  healthy energy B vitamins the fish oil the essential fatty acids it's all there
[02:44:40.900 --> 02:44:46.540]  at info wars team dot com when you purchase the high quality products that
[02:44:46.540 --> 02:44:51.740]  we've researched and that you know Ben is endorsed then your purchase also makes
[02:44:51.740 --> 02:44:58.260]  this radio show the news show everything we do possible now because info wars
[02:44:58.260 --> 02:45:03.540]  team is something that is a huge sponsor of our show in fact I've taken an in
[02:45:03.540 --> 02:45:07.460]  house myself because researching it I think it's the best system out there
[02:45:07.460 --> 02:45:13.300]  bar 9 then let's walk through for people because as you pointed out what's so
[02:45:13.300 --> 02:45:16.820]  exciting about this is that people who are in horrible shape who've been
[02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:21.660]  working too much too long who have horrible nutritional deficiencies who
[02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:24.900]  don't have the right minerals and vitamins and trace elements and things
[02:45:24.900 --> 02:45:30.020]  that are so key when they start taking beyond tangy tangerine and pollen burst
[02:45:30.020 --> 02:45:35.620]  when they start taking the essential fatty acid systems I mean I have a
[02:45:35.620 --> 02:45:39.180]  family member who had eczema talk to you six months ago you said put them on
[02:45:39.180 --> 02:45:43.620]  essential fatty acids they did it the eczema is gone Ted Anderson's father
[02:45:43.620 --> 02:45:47.860]  didn't even know who he was got him on the essential fatty acids got him on the
[02:45:47.860 --> 02:45:52.660]  beyond tangy tangerine his memory was suddenly back he was doing great he
[02:45:52.660 --> 02:45:57.980]  go fishing with him again the doctor said uh-huh he's on Cuma then he can't be
[02:45:57.980 --> 02:46:01.460]  taking that beyond tangy tangerine that has natural minerals in it it can throw
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:05.740]  him off so they took him off of it and he's back again again the doctors are
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:11.540]  actually no do not take vitamins and minerals that is evil and so I mean
[02:46:11.540 --> 02:46:15.660]  Ted says I can tell that story even though it's painful for him this is the
[02:46:15.660 --> 02:46:21.060]  type and then I even had Dr. Russell Blalock on about how deadly statins are
[02:46:21.060 --> 02:46:25.300]  and how they trigger Alzheimer's and literally eat the brain and because the
[02:46:25.300 --> 02:46:30.540]  brain's made out of cholesterol folks and I did that interview just for Ted to
[02:46:30.540 --> 02:46:34.500]  give it to his family and they just said basically we don't care our doctor
[02:46:34.500 --> 02:46:38.780]  says it the statins stay all this stuff I mean my dad's a dentist but he's
[02:46:38.780 --> 02:46:42.140]  done a lot of research he got my grandmother off statins she suddenly
[02:46:42.140 --> 02:46:49.620]  you know has a lot more life and energy describe the the the products at
[02:46:49.620 --> 02:46:57.340]  info wars team calm and then break down for people what statins are doing just
[02:46:57.340 --> 02:47:00.580]  an example I real quick the stands are a very fascinating subject because they
[02:47:00.580 --> 02:47:03.860]  are a real boon for the pharmaceutical industry that they've been making
[02:47:03.860 --> 02:47:07.620]  billions upon billions of dollars in profit alone on the statins since they
[02:47:07.620 --> 02:47:11.300]  were first introduced almost 15 or 16 years ago the idea the stands is that
[02:47:11.300 --> 02:47:16.180]  they're trying to target one specific enzyme system whose whose end result is
[02:47:16.180 --> 02:47:19.660]  cholesterol but what they miss is there's about 10 steps in between and
[02:47:19.660 --> 02:47:24.140]  every one of those steps is blocked by the statin drugs so it means that your
[02:47:24.140 --> 02:47:28.420]  body can't produce a lot of vital chemicals including cholesterol never
[02:47:28.420 --> 02:47:34.220]  mind the cholesterol is probably arguably the single most important biochemical
[02:47:34.220 --> 02:47:37.940]  in your body it's a precursor to vitamin D it's a precursor to all of your
[02:47:37.940 --> 02:47:42.260]  steroid hormones it's a precursor to cortisol it's required for the for
[02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:46.660]  healthy cell membranes it's required for brain function there's no way you can
[02:47:46.660 --> 02:47:50.580]  knock out that system and not expect side effects what's worse is when you
[02:47:50.580 --> 02:47:53.860]  take a statin drug you keep your body from making other things not just
[02:47:53.860 --> 02:47:58.500]  cholesterol including coenzyme Q10 which is one of the most vital of all the
[02:47:58.500 --> 02:48:02.580]  non vitamin systems in the body non vitamin compounds in the body so the
[02:48:02.580 --> 02:48:05.820]  bottom line is is when you take a statin drug you're you're blocking your
[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:09.140]  body from making a lot of things including cholesterol on top of that
[02:48:09.140 --> 02:48:13.700]  nobody's ever shown that elevated cholesterol is the cause of heart
[02:48:13.700 --> 02:48:16.740]  disease we know it's there we know there's elevated cholesterol when you
[02:48:16.740 --> 02:48:20.000]  have heart disease but nobody's ever shown that it's the cause of heart
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:24.180]  disease on top of that the reason cholesterol gets elevated is because
[02:48:24.180 --> 02:48:28.580]  people are eating too much sugar when you raise your insulin levels your
[02:48:28.580 --> 02:48:33.180]  cholesterol will go up so there's a simple way exactly what I've talked to
[02:48:33.180 --> 02:48:38.660]  and I'm talking brain surgeons endocrinologists they say fats are what
[02:48:38.660 --> 02:48:43.500]  make your skin your arteries they say it's chemicals and things and sugars
[02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:47.220]  that boost it that actually clog the arteries then cholesterol goes up to
[02:48:47.220 --> 02:48:52.380]  try to lubricate all that and then it becomes all gummed up that's right my
[02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:55.940]  dad in his own words from researching and he's like it should be the perfect
[02:48:55.940 --> 02:49:01.780]  chemical weapon it's an aging weapon it attacks your entire system and almost
[02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:06.020]  creates an artificial form of scurvy but Dr. Blalock and others have said it's
[02:49:06.020 --> 02:49:10.160]  probably one of the most devastating things out there if you are on a statin
[02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:13.260]  drug just try this and by the way you were talking about Ted asked Ted what
[02:49:13.260 --> 02:49:16.580]  happened to his cholesterol levels when and his triglyceride levels when he
[02:49:16.580 --> 02:49:20.300]  started on this program okay it's an amazing story if you don't know
[02:49:20.300 --> 02:49:23.500]  nutrition now knowing nutrition I'm not that amazed by it because I know that's
[02:49:23.500 --> 02:49:28.660]  what's supposed to happen if you're in my dad came back what's that within
[02:49:28.660 --> 02:49:32.860]  months his dad came back that's right just by taking B vitamins and essential

[02:54:16.740 --> 02:54:19.700]  the scenes he's really done a lot of research he's the guy that got me in the
[02:54:19.700 --> 02:54:23.860]  ungevity because of this is that the doctor went and tested the blood and
[02:54:23.860 --> 02:54:27.860]  because it had higher minerals in it so we can't have minerals that high and
[02:54:27.860 --> 02:54:34.180]  vitamins with this cumydin so the cumydin I guess the blood thinner even
[02:54:34.180 --> 02:54:40.020]  though he's ever had a stroke the blood thinner that's so important you can't
[02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:46.060]  have vitamins and minerals I mean as a pharmacist been how how can doctors be
[02:54:46.060 --> 02:54:50.660]  anti-vitamin and mineral and and say it doesn't matter if he's got his memory
[02:54:50.660 --> 02:54:56.540]  back he's got to go off of it and then people like these are messiahs follow the
[02:54:56.540 --> 02:55:03.620]  doctor's order this idea that doctoring is somehow akin to God it's not
[02:55:03.620 --> 02:55:07.500]  doctoring means patching things up and doctors are trained in how to patch
[02:55:07.500 --> 02:55:12.780]  things up when you doctor something you jury rig it you you tie it together with
[02:55:12.780 --> 02:55:17.460]  a bailing wire and bubblegum doctoring is about jury rigging the body to make it
[02:55:17.460 --> 02:55:21.100]  look like it's that's why when votes get stolen they say they doctored with it
[02:55:21.100 --> 02:55:25.620]  that's right or your taxes are doctored see how far that gets you with the IRS
[02:55:25.620 --> 02:55:30.780]  when you doctor your taxes doctoring is it means to fix something so it appears
[02:55:30.780 --> 02:55:36.100]  to be something that it's not and so we have this this model this doctor a doctor
[02:55:36.100 --> 02:55:40.820]  instead of a hearing of health it gives it it's not about healing doctoring is
[02:55:40.820 --> 02:55:44.900]  not about healing that's the point doctoring is about treating there's no
[02:55:44.900 --> 02:55:48.060]  drug in the world that can heal this is why the FDA doesn't even allow you to
[02:55:48.060 --> 02:55:52.140]  use the cure word because according to them you can't cure anything according
[02:55:52.140 --> 02:55:56.340]  to the medical model the body is inherently flawed and the best they
[02:55:56.340 --> 02:56:00.140]  even say I can't say is a cure for scurvy even though it's been known for
[02:56:00.140 --> 02:56:05.140]  500 years you don't get vitamin C your skin disintegrates it's not that it's a
[02:56:05.140 --> 02:56:08.740]  cure for scurvy it's that it eliminates it because scurvy is caused by a
[02:56:08.740 --> 02:56:13.460]  deficiency in vitamin D or vitamin C the point exactly a cure is like almost
[02:56:13.460 --> 02:56:19.060]  saying that you deserve to have it or something or it should be there exactly
[02:56:19.060 --> 02:56:23.540]  a kid's not watching your teeth and flossing that's a cure to gum disease
[02:56:23.540 --> 02:56:27.340]  right exactly brushing your teeth doesn't cure a gum disease at all it
[02:56:27.340 --> 02:56:30.820]  eliminates it keeps it from happening in the first place and that's what
[02:56:30.820 --> 02:56:36.580]  nutrition does doctoring is not about that doctoring is about patching things
[02:56:36.580 --> 02:56:41.500]  together so that you can get by for 70 or 80 years and then die and that's the
[02:56:41.500 --> 02:56:45.780]  way that's why it is great for heroic care like a broken leg for a bone
[02:56:45.780 --> 02:56:49.060]  sticking out of your leg but it's not good but you come in with a heart
[02:56:49.060 --> 02:56:53.700]  problem they just give you drugs to mask it that's right we are so
[02:56:53.700 --> 02:56:57.780]  bamboozled and hypnotized by the sizzle of emergency medicine which
[02:56:57.780 --> 02:57:00.940]  obviously heroic medicine has done a tremendous job and if you get hit by a
[02:57:00.940 --> 02:57:05.980]  car you want a surgeon not a vitamin but as far as degenerative disease goes the
[02:57:05.980 --> 02:57:11.540]  body knows how to heal itself our job is simply to give it the raw materials to
[02:57:11.540 --> 02:57:15.340]  do its work it's as simple as that. Let's stop right there then look I know that if
[02:57:15.340 --> 02:57:18.300]  people will just try to stay beyond tangy tangerine with all the vitamins and
[02:57:18.300 --> 02:57:22.900]  minerals everything you need that little scoop every day that that lowers
[02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:26.860]  your cravings to eat that's how I've lost some weight is that instead of just
[02:57:26.860 --> 02:57:29.820]  picking out and there's and it's the minerals and vitamins aren't the
[02:57:29.820 --> 02:57:33.380]  regular food you just you just take the vitamins and minerals and fatty acids
[02:57:33.380 --> 02:57:37.220]  that's how Aaron's lost like 40 something pounds folks he's totally following the
[02:57:37.220 --> 02:57:41.300]  longevity plan and listens to Ben Fuchs every morning the hour before I come on

[03:00:35.540 --> 03:00:41.340]  via sky bringing you info wars nightly news again I just want to thank the great
[03:00:41.340 --> 03:00:46.060]  crew that we have you the listeners and supporters our AM and FM affiliates our
[03:00:46.060 --> 03:00:52.980]  sponsors but young Jebedy is a product I've researched it really has led the
[03:00:52.980 --> 03:00:58.260]  way in the last 20 years and so much of what it has done has been copied which
[03:00:58.260 --> 03:01:02.340]  is great but we put together in one spot when I did the research the best
[03:01:02.340 --> 03:01:06.100]  products out there and I found a supporter and person that promotes
[03:01:06.100 --> 03:01:11.180]  young Jebedy pharmacist Ben Fuchs and picked his brain and so we have him on
[03:01:11.180 --> 03:01:15.540]  occasionally to cover the latest news and also promote the products we're
[03:01:15.540 --> 03:01:20.580]  offering that's what I believe in free market we offer good products to you and
[03:01:20.580 --> 03:01:24.340]  then that supports getting the overall word out and then you of course get
[03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:31.100]  better health and young Jebedy so info wars team calm in closing pharmacist
[03:01:31.100 --> 03:01:35.300]  Ben Fuchs breaking down the things that don't doctor you don't patch something
[03:01:35.300 --> 03:01:40.260]  up that allow your body to be like it's supposed to be a healthy and with more
[03:01:40.260 --> 03:01:44.220]  longevity mentioned some of the other great products that are at info wars
[03:01:44.220 --> 03:01:49.580]  team calm that people should check out ultimate EFA is this well the BTT is the
[03:01:49.580 --> 03:01:52.460]  first one you mentioned that the beyond tangy tangerine the ultimate EFA is
[03:01:52.460 --> 03:01:55.820]  probably the second most important and then the probiotic product the
[03:01:55.820 --> 03:01:59.020]  biolumen nightly essence and the ultimate enzymes because Alex if your
[03:01:59.020 --> 03:02:02.900]  digestive system is not functioning where it where it should be everything
[03:02:02.900 --> 03:02:06.020]  else you do on top of that is going to be like trying to bail water out of a
[03:02:06.020 --> 03:02:11.180]  leaky boat the key to wellness is in the digestive system and any kind of
[03:02:11.180 --> 03:02:14.420]  digestive symptom that you have needs to be figured out and needs to be
[03:02:14.420 --> 03:02:17.460]  eliminated one of the most important things you could do if in fact if you
[03:02:17.460 --> 03:02:20.940]  only did one thing aside from the beyond tangy tangerine I would tell you it's a
[03:02:20.940 --> 03:02:26.140]  good probiotic supplement good bacteria for help reestablishing the the coal
[03:02:26.140 --> 03:02:29.940]  colons bacteria of good bacteria responsible for protecting you from
[03:02:29.940 --> 03:02:34.140]  cancer for helping your body process fats for helping your body make the B
[03:02:34.140 --> 03:02:38.700]  vitamins and vitamin K and also for helping detoxify and process food so
[03:02:38.700 --> 03:02:43.740]  having imbalances in your colon via back in terms of bacteria will have a
[03:02:43.740 --> 03:02:47.300]  negative effect on almost every single health system in the body and helping
[03:02:47.300 --> 03:02:50.940]  take care of that is as simple as getting on the off floor the biolumen
[03:02:50.940 --> 03:02:54.340]  nightly essence or the floor effects product the ultimate enzymes as well not
[03:02:54.340 --> 03:02:58.940]  only are they important for digestion but digestive enzymes are anti-inflammatory
[03:02:58.940 --> 03:03:02.420]  if you have arthritis pain if you have knee pain if you have hip joint pain if
[03:03:02.420 --> 03:03:06.380]  you have any kind of inflammatory pain digestive enzymes not only will help you
[03:03:06.380 --> 03:03:10.100]  digest your food but they also act as anti-inflammatories and then the
[03:03:10.100 --> 03:03:13.860]  ultimate multi to get you all your basic multiple vitamin needs there's also a
[03:03:13.860 --> 03:03:17.540]  lot of great skin care products you name it there but but I mean it's really
[03:03:17.540 --> 03:03:22.620]  simple they weaponize the food the water the GMO the additives we get sick they
[03:03:22.620 --> 03:03:26.900]  extract our money and wealth out of us basically just keeping us alive patching
[03:03:26.900 --> 03:03:32.300]  us up and you know as miserable creatures they obviously is a medical
[03:03:32.300 --> 03:03:38.380]  industry they don't want us to know how our body is supposed to really work it's
[03:03:38.380 --> 03:03:42.140]  up to us Alex and this is the bottom line and to become full circle to how we
[03:03:42.140 --> 03:03:47.060]  started off the program it's up to us to take the ball into our own court not to
[03:03:47.060 --> 03:03:52.060]  rely on the medical community not to rely on outside authorities we are our own
[03:03:52.060 --> 03:03:57.340]  authorities the human body is a healing system we all own one it's pre-program
[03:03:57.340 --> 03:04:01.060]  to heal itself every time you cut your finger you can watch the healing process
[03:04:01.060 --> 03:04:04.140]  take place you don't have to think about it you don't have to participate in it
[03:04:04.140 --> 03:04:09.020]  that same healing process is in place in every system of the body all we have to
[03:04:09.020 --> 03:04:13.140]  wait a minute the FDA should come out and say your body's not allowed to cure
[03:04:13.140 --> 03:04:18.460]  itself of a cut we need to have the doctors come and somehow just keep it
[03:04:18.460 --> 03:04:22.900]  bloody for life but put a bandage on it and you know treat that instead of
[03:04:22.900 --> 03:04:27.340]  letting your body heal your body can't heal from a cut what type of extremist
[03:04:27.340 --> 03:04:31.460]  are you Ben Fuchs yes that's the logical extension of how they want us to
[03:04:31.460 --> 03:04:35.340]  think but the bottom line is they cannot control that biochemistry it's ours for
[03:04:35.340 --> 03:04:38.540]  now for now because probably they're trying to figure out a way to do it but
[03:04:38.540 --> 03:04:41.420]  for now it's our biochemistry we need to figure out how to give it the good stuff
[03:04:41.420 --> 03:04:45.140]  not give it the bad beautifully said Ben Fuchs I look forward to on you back on
[03:04:45.140 --> 03:04:48.140]  the show and also sitting in the near future I'll be back tonight 7 o'clock
