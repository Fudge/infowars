[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:21.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.040 --> 00:31.600]  it was four years ago that Paul Joseph Watson found in a pediatrics journal
[00:31.600 --> 00:39.640]  fact the biggest journal a paper by two professors of bioethics calling for
[00:39.640 --> 00:45.000]  killing children for any reason you feel like up to age three this is all part of
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.880]  the eugenics transhumanist movement and when we published an article linking
[00:49.880 --> 00:57.520]  directly to the study and directly to the journal of pediatrics for four or
[00:57.520 --> 01:02.560]  five days people said we'd put a hoax out because they couldn't believe that
[01:02.560 --> 01:06.960]  someone would say something like that openly even though that's a mainline
[01:06.960 --> 01:12.440]  bioethics with Peter Singer at Princeton it's the same in England the same thing
[01:12.440 --> 01:17.600]  in Australia this is what's been pushed for decades the end of humanity having
[01:17.600 --> 01:24.120]  no value in humanity so that we'll all just roll over and basically die now
[01:24.120 --> 01:28.200]  fast forward four years later after Paul Joseph Watson's original article
[01:28.200 --> 01:34.280]  which will you guys print me that pediatric journal calls for babies to
[01:34.280 --> 01:40.280]  be able to be killed up to age three now it's in the college fix and he is in
[01:40.280 --> 01:49.600]  major newspapers more college students support post birth abortion now with a
[01:49.600 --> 01:55.280]  straight face it's being announced all over the country and we're sending Joe
[01:55.280 --> 02:00.920]  Biggs out right now to UT and I'm guessing half the students will see
[02:00.920 --> 02:04.440]  tomorrow or by the nightly news tonight I don't know how fast they'll get it put
[02:04.440 --> 02:09.720]  together I'm guessing half the students will say kill children if the government
[02:09.720 --> 02:15.560]  kills like it we're not even talking about killing children that are infirm as
[02:15.560 --> 02:20.000]  they call them or mentally retarded see in the politically correct world you
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.840]  don't use the word retarded but you kill the children just like they say in
[02:24.840 --> 02:30.240]  apocalypse now we train our fighter pilots to drop napalm on men women and
[02:30.240 --> 02:35.800]  children and drop death from the air but we court-martial them if they write the
[02:35.800 --> 02:41.320]  f-word on the side of their airplane and this is what I've always noticed oh the
[02:41.320 --> 02:45.960]  FBI created a fake website to nab somebody doing a bomb threats over and
[02:45.960 --> 02:53.480]  over again to a Seattle newspaper well that sounds like in real investigative
[02:53.480 --> 02:58.240]  work to me but it's oh it's such a big deal it's so horrible it's the end of
[02:58.240 --> 03:02.880]  the world meanwhile major defense contractors have been caught running
[03:02.880 --> 03:06.480]  giant child kidnapping rings and no one got in trouble and and no one's gonna say
[03:06.480 --> 03:10.160]  a word about it even when it's in the Chicago Tribune because that's just so
[03:10.160 --> 03:15.120]  evil and big we just can't believe that's going on the NSA spies on
[03:15.120 --> 03:24.640]  everybody illegally but we're going to talk about a cop who punch somebody in
[03:24.640 --> 03:30.680]  the nose which isn't good but the point is they will obsess on some little thing
[03:30.680 --> 03:35.560]  and act like it's the end of the world and then massive evil in the private
[03:35.560 --> 03:39.400]  sector in the public sector you name it is just growing exponentially so
[03:39.400 --> 03:44.680]  frustrating but here's the article Paul Watson ought to do a flashback we
[03:44.680 --> 03:48.360]  actually send it was your Kari Jackson out last year on this same subject and
[03:48.360 --> 03:53.280]  got quite a few Austinites on South Congress to say yes abort children
[03:53.280 --> 03:59.400]  after birth and this is the idea we're trash humans don't have any value roll
[03:59.400 --> 04:09.800]  over and die and more and more I realize this is the absolute sinner the key to
[04:09.800 --> 04:16.400]  defeating this entire globalist program
[04:16.400 --> 04:31.480]  is understanding why they want us to not think of ourselves as valuable I think
[04:31.480 --> 04:35.560]  it is the celebration of human achievement and the celebration of human
[04:35.560 --> 04:41.760]  inventiveness and and beauty whether it's opera or literature or people being
[04:41.760 --> 04:47.440]  heroic even though I'll disagree with a war I can admire someone's courage in
[04:47.440 --> 04:52.800]  it it is in that celebration that we defeat the new world order I'm sure of
[04:52.800 --> 04:59.240]  it and I want to try to codify it into an eloquent soliloquy stay with us the

[08:38.960 --> 08:44.920]  silent green is in short supply remember Tuesday is silent green day the

[09:03.960 --> 09:08.800]  already know so enjoy the flavor. We're gonna get the real solution which is
[09:08.800 --> 09:12.560]  gonna be a combination of death panels and and sales taxes. I'm consistently
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.440]  pro-death. I'm for assisted suicide. I'm for regular suicide. I'm for whatever
[09:17.440 --> 09:21.200]  gets the freeway moving. Is spending a million dollars on that last three months
[09:21.200 --> 09:26.400]  of life for that patient would it be better not to lay off the those ten
[09:26.400 --> 09:31.240]  teachers and to make that trade-off and medical cost but that's called the death
[09:31.240 --> 09:36.200]  panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion. They told me to to say
[09:36.200 --> 09:49.840]  that they were sorry but that you had become unreliable is this the kind of
[09:49.840 --> 09:53.520]  society that you want to live in any kind of society that would do this to its
[09:53.520 --> 09:58.360]  children will do it to its senior citizens it will do it to its dissidents
[09:58.360 --> 10:03.440]  that kind of society will also eventually turn on its police on its army on
[10:03.440 --> 10:07.840]  its prison guards on the quiz lings and the collaborators who make that possible
[10:07.840 --> 10:14.720]  this is nothing but a suicide cult. The scoops are on their way the scoops are on

[11:06.120 --> 11:12.240]  World Government Plan. We will both be breaking it down from our perspectives
[11:12.240 --> 11:16.560]  today and taking your phone calls one hour into the interview in the third
[11:16.560 --> 11:29.000]  hour. We have massive massive Ebola news and I'll just go to it right now. I have
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.560]  said over and over again and you have said it as well and our guests have all
[11:32.560 --> 11:37.040]  said it you don't have to be a genius to see there's a cover-up going on with the
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.520]  Ebola now we don't know at least I don't know exactly what the cover-up is but
[11:41.520 --> 11:49.000]  it's going on they're acting suspicious they're sneaking around they're
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  turning off default positions on flights into the US on issuing West African
[11:54.000 --> 12:01.400]  visas on not quarantining people on then saying that people that have had Ebola in
[12:01.400 --> 12:07.440]  the US gave it to nurses and doctors but didn't spread it to other people when
[12:07.440 --> 12:14.160]  these doctors and nurses are acting like the fictional character who works in a
[12:14.160 --> 12:22.160]  bio lab in a microbiology lab in 12 monkeys with Bruce Willis these doctors
[12:22.160 --> 12:28.160]  and nurses are acting like the guy at the end who goes and you know goes to all
[12:28.160 --> 12:33.000]  the restaurants and basically bowling alleys and books a bunch of flights when
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.320]  he's infected these are medical doctors and people they're all acting very
[12:37.320 --> 12:42.560]  strange so either it's a hoax and it's not going on or they've turned off the
[12:42.560 --> 12:45.720]  default positions and are trying to spread it and I'm not saying the doctors
[12:45.720 --> 12:49.240]  and nurses are actually doing this but by their actions they are if they really
[12:49.240 --> 12:54.960]  have a bola or if they were around people that had a bola why would you
[12:54.960 --> 13:00.360]  send 5,000 US troops into the middle of a hot zone and then send them to Italy
[13:00.360 --> 13:06.800]  when one patient brought out of Africa into Spain has spread it why would you
[13:06.800 --> 13:11.080]  bring hundreds of troops in who they say are in some cases are sick we have a
[13:11.080 --> 13:17.680]  source inside the base at the highest level I'll just leave it at that in the
[13:17.680 --> 13:22.040]  office at the highest level and there is no quarantine there's not even really a
[13:22.040 --> 13:27.920]  gate on the base there's just a highway blocker a roadblocker at a guard shack
[13:27.920 --> 13:32.840]  there's not really a fence and there is no quarantine going on there's a nurses
[13:32.840 --> 13:39.200]  station that can hand out aspirin and put band-aids on people's fingers the
[13:39.200 --> 13:44.640]  base doesn't even have doctors on it it's not a medical base and we went and
[13:44.640 --> 13:49.640]  looked up what our source told us and it was all true our source is there in the
[13:49.640 --> 13:56.680]  general's office I'll just leave it at that there is no quarantine and most the
[13:56.680 --> 14:00.120]  troops live off base with their families because a lot of them are special
[14:00.120 --> 14:10.920]  forces officers army special forces so that's what's going on there is no
[14:10.920 --> 14:17.680]  quarantine at the base in Italy and we told you that on Monday it's now mainstream
[14:17.680 --> 14:24.240]  news there's not really a quarantine there why did they tell us there was
[14:24.240 --> 14:31.880]  nothing adds up here except a plan to spread Ebola in the United States and
[14:31.880 --> 14:36.080]  I've said over and over again after the election we'll find out whether this was
[14:36.080 --> 14:42.360]  basically a hoax there's real Ebola in Africa whether they're just basically
[14:42.360 --> 14:46.760]  using a few cases of people with it to hype things up or whether they have
[14:46.760 --> 14:52.440]  covered up the fact that it's been spreading and then today Obama comes out
[14:52.440 --> 14:58.320]  with the chilling statement Reuters headline Americans may still see some
[14:58.320 --> 15:09.080]  Ebola cases Obama says and he went on to say we can't be hermetically sealed now
[15:09.080 --> 15:12.560]  only all the government bunkers that are hermetically sealed you only have it
[15:12.560 --> 15:18.240]  side are 30 miles from the White House buddy a hermetically sealed underground
[15:18.240 --> 15:23.640]  bunker you only have a railway right underneath the White House on record to
[15:23.640 --> 15:28.520]  the Briar Hotel and other facilities and helicopter pads where if enemy drones
[15:28.520 --> 15:32.000]  came in and sprayed airborne Ebola you would go into hermetically sealed
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.960]  chamber that's right only you get to be hermetically sealed and only Northcom
[15:36.960 --> 15:42.520]  gets to be hermetically sealed we don't get to be hermetically sealed do we by
[15:42.520 --> 15:46.480]  the way we have the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean between us in Africa you know it
[15:46.480 --> 15:51.640]  straddles the two we don't need to be hermetically sealed we just need you to
[15:51.640 --> 15:59.320]  stop visas from West Africa and we need you to make US health workers who will
[15:59.320 --> 16:03.720]  go out of the hot zone out of the out of the Ebola hospitals then they go back
[16:03.720 --> 16:09.640]  to their dormitories and they have a self-quarantine and stay there for more
[16:09.640 --> 16:13.360]  than 30 days is really what you're supposed to do second last 40 and then
[16:13.360 --> 16:17.360]  you get on airplane and come back that's what you do that's what you've
[16:17.360 --> 16:23.000]  always done and so here's the big enchilada the fact that he's now getting
[16:23.000 --> 16:28.720]  people ready to say see I told you this is like letting out a you know what in
[16:28.720 --> 16:33.760]  church he's just hoping nobody notices what he's doing shifting around on his
[16:33.760 --> 16:39.160]  chair and this is a big sign that Ebola spreading in my view this is a big sign
[16:39.160 --> 16:44.560]  that oh down now it's no big deal and we can't be hermetically sealed but I
[16:44.560 --> 16:52.560]  think you may need to expect some more Ebola there you go this from a guy who
[16:52.560 --> 16:55.480]  said months ago there's no way it'll come over here or then it's unlikely or
[16:55.480 --> 16:58.720]  oh we'll bring health care workers here they won't spread it baloney they know
[16:58.720 --> 17:01.480]  full well you bring in health care workers that have got it they're gonna
[17:01.480 --> 17:08.560]  spread it they're spreading it anywhere only Spain and the US are basically
[17:08.560 --> 17:12.200]  dumb enough to bring a bunch of people infected with Ebola in but they're not
[17:12.200 --> 17:15.160]  dumb and remember the rumors that started about three weeks ago and the
[17:15.160 --> 17:18.880]  Washington free beacon it wasn't a rumor they had sources drudge link to it
[17:18.880 --> 17:26.760]  we linked to it that the White House is planning to bring in foreigners with a
[17:26.760 --> 17:29.600]  bullet well now it's been announced yesterday that they're looking at doing
[17:29.600 --> 17:38.280]  it and why because it's over the top and it's meant to break our will why with
[17:38.280 --> 17:45.320]  the Journal of Pediatrics come out with a paper back in 2012 was another paper
[17:45.320 --> 17:51.040]  before that two years before in 2010 and say it's time to start killing babies
[17:51.040 --> 17:54.960]  up to age three here's the headline ethicists argue killing newborn babies
[17:54.960 --> 18:00.440]  should be allowed in the Journal of Medical Ethics it was republished in
[18:00.440 --> 18:04.800]  pediatrics now when we publish this people didn't believe us even though we
[18:04.800 --> 18:12.040]  linked to it now this is being pushed everywhere now it's in college fix calm
[18:12.040 --> 18:16.120]  and it links to a bunch of newspapers promoting it and admits and says it's
[18:16.120 --> 18:21.600]  the new trendy trend says trending more college students support post birth
[18:21.600 --> 18:24.960]  abortion we've already gone out in Austin and about a third of the people
[18:24.960 --> 18:28.400]  want to kill babies up for any reason just if you want to kill your kid go
[18:28.400 --> 18:33.280]  ahead and kill them now if you spank your child lightly for running out in the
[18:33.280 --> 18:35.560]  street when they're three they'll take it away from you but if you want to kill
[18:35.560 --> 18:40.920]  them you know that's fine and people say this is over the top people a couple

[23:58.720 --> 24:05.160]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[24:05.160 --> 24:09.960]  because there's a war on for your mind
[24:15.000 --> 24:22.880]  the truth is that until we stop this outbreak in West Africa we may continue
[24:22.880 --> 24:29.720]  to see individual cases in America in the weeks and months ahead because that's
[24:29.720 --> 24:35.000]  the nature of today's world we can't hermetically seal ourselves off
[24:35.000 --> 24:42.440]  critical that we may we remain focused on the facts and on the science keep in
[24:42.440 --> 24:46.800]  mind that of the seven Americans treated for Ebola so far most of them
[24:46.800 --> 24:53.880]  while serving in West Africa all seven have survived right now the only
[24:53.880 --> 24:57.560]  Americans still undergoing treatment is Dr. Craig Spencer who contracted the
[24:57.560 --> 25:04.640]  disease abroad while working to protect others and we salute his service okay
[25:04.640 --> 25:10.040]  well basically all of that is a lie if your neighbor's house is on fire a you
[25:10.040 --> 25:13.480]  want to get the fire department there you want to get people out of the house
[25:13.480 --> 25:17.680]  of there in there and then you want to protect your house that may mean getting
[25:17.680 --> 25:22.280]  a water hose out in spring the area your house is closest to the house it's on
[25:22.280 --> 25:30.880]  fire so saying in today's age we can't do anything about this since when can we
[25:30.880 --> 25:38.680]  not if some super flu gets out if some super mousepox or smallpox gets out
[25:38.680 --> 25:43.640]  which undoubtedly is going to happen pandemics come and go they've always tried
[25:43.640 --> 25:46.480]  to quarantine people they've always tried to stop flights or shipments in out
[25:46.480 --> 25:49.840]  of those countries and scream people now under globalism they're saying no we
[25:49.840 --> 25:54.520]  can't do that we have to respond all over the world globally the North
[25:54.520 --> 26:01.400]  American Union documents from BAMP Canada and from Waco 2005 2007 BAMPs
[26:01.400 --> 26:06.880]  2007 they state we will use global pandemics to bring in one world
[26:06.880 --> 26:11.720]  government and what does the Secretary of Defense Hagel saying in a quote today I
[26:11.720 --> 26:16.320]  think we are living through one of these historic defining times I think we are
[26:16.320 --> 26:23.000]  seeing a new world order their new order they're bringing in there's different
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.080]  definitions of the new world order a new world order would mean a new global
[26:26.080 --> 26:29.520]  power alignment it could mean that in its purest sense but when they say new
[26:29.520 --> 26:34.120]  world order they mean a new order run by these corporate Rothschild's Rockefeller
[26:34.120 --> 26:45.640]  Saxe-Coburg-Gotha house of orange exterminist just scum of the earth I
[26:45.640 --> 26:51.960]  just name the names of who sits on top Anglo-American oil who sits across the
[26:51.960 --> 26:55.720]  Anglo-American establishment that's not my name for it that's what all their top
[26:55.720 --> 26:59.480]  historians call it in their internal documents that are public if you'd like
[26:59.480 --> 27:03.880]  to go read this stuff it's not widely published we sell the book tragedy and
[27:03.880 --> 27:06.440]  hope written by Carol quickly they had a Georgetown political science Bill
[27:06.440 --> 27:13.360]  Clinton's mentor I want to thank David Rockefeller I want to thank Professor
[27:13.360 --> 27:18.240]  Carol quickly remember when he it was accepted speech or a crime thank you
[27:18.240 --> 27:25.360]  David David yeah David's been helping Billy boy since high school and that's
[27:25.360 --> 27:30.440]  because well-known Rockefeller like to visit mama and mama was a lady of the
[27:30.440 --> 27:37.120]  night by the way this is all on record the kings did that a long time ago they
[27:37.120 --> 27:40.720] 'd have a whole bunch of illegitimate sons from their jillies down in the
[27:40.720 --> 27:45.760]  town and then they put them in charge of things you'd have generals and admirals
[27:45.760 --> 27:54.480]  and all the other folks that were really really been shired by the king and the
[27:54.480 --> 28:02.320]  more the world changed those more it stays the same David Rockefeller just
[28:02.320 --> 28:06.880]  taking care of the family Clinton is a Rockefeller folks go look it up and the
[28:06.880 --> 28:16.480]  Rockefeller governor down there his mama was a whore that's on record and I'm
[28:16.480 --> 28:22.560]  not saying that's my judging her just saying where Bill Clinton comes from
[28:22.560 --> 28:25.600]  little fat issue a little bit of history there for folks that want to know
[28:25.600 --> 28:33.080]  about it but I guess he got a strong sex drive from her he is a sex addict
[28:33.080 --> 28:38.760]  that's admitted FBI demands new powers to hack into computers and carry out
[28:38.760 --> 28:42.520]  surveillance this is in the Guardian and of course they're already doing it they
[28:42.520 --> 28:46.040]  just want to mainline it then there's this story the pirate Bay pirate Bay

[33:50.000 --> 33:54.000]  Democrats are the people that steal elections at the retail level they also
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.240]  do it through voting machines Republicans do that as well historically we
[33:58.240 --> 34:04.080]  see both sides doing that and a lot of overlap but this is a dirty dirty dirty
[34:04.080 --> 34:10.680]  election and Obama clearly came out yesterday we played the clip yesterday
[34:10.680 --> 34:16.360]  two days ago he came out in a speech and said now you can vote all week long
[34:16.360 --> 34:22.520]  now I don't mean vote twice you know wink wink this ain't Chicago I'm sorry
[34:22.520 --> 34:30.480]  Chicago I'm just from Chicago and they're battling with the Justice
[34:30.480 --> 34:34.040]  Department to let illegal aliens vote and they are all over the country and
[34:34.040 --> 34:37.920]  look I can't go to Latin America or China and I can't vote they would laugh at
[34:37.920 --> 34:43.760]  me but Americans have such incredible hospitality and have been guilted into
[34:43.760 --> 34:52.520]  putting up with anything and everything it is it is so frustrating I want to get
[34:52.520 --> 34:56.840]  into the overton window and tie it into what it means with the moves for death
[34:56.840 --> 35:03.480]  panels putting the troops on secret death list dehydrating old people killing
[35:03.480 --> 35:08.880]  babies up to age five now that's what they're calling babies this is already
[35:08.880 --> 35:15.080]  going on but it's back of the newspaper and it's the bioethicist boards so we're
[35:15.080 --> 35:21.280]  gonna be breaking that down the latest on Ebola and more but first off I took
[35:21.280 --> 35:24.840]  some of the classic designs that I liked out there and kind of changed them and
[35:24.840 --> 35:30.120]  told my graphics folks what I wanted and the reason I say that is these are kind
[35:30.120 --> 35:37.560]  of Alex Jones designs just like the belt buckles are and a lot of the other

[35:47.040 --> 35:52.480]  like-minded folks to have conversation starters and about a year ago we came
[35:52.480 --> 35:55.880]  out with the first Molan Lombay shirts that weren't just come and take it in
[35:55.880 --> 36:01.000]  English you go back thousands of years ago to Greece and of course it's battle
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.680]  with the Persians and saying come and take it in 300 soldiers for several days
[36:06.680 --> 36:13.040]  holding off tens of thousands and that's a true story popularized of course I
[36:13.040 --> 36:19.360]  guess by Marvel Comics and then it moves forward through many other
[36:19.360 --> 36:24.680]  civilizations in times where people said the same thing harkening back to 300
[36:24.680 --> 36:29.760]  saying come and take it which means Molan Lombay in Greek or I guess
[36:29.760 --> 36:38.200]  translated into Latin or Roman and then of course the Texas Revolution with my
[36:38.200 --> 36:43.800]  ancestors in Gonzales who were there refusing to turn in their firearms and
[36:43.800 --> 36:50.200]  the cannon they had and so here came Santa Anna and he won the first battles
[36:50.200 --> 36:53.440]  but he lost the war didn't he and that's how it works and then the British came
[36:53.440 --> 36:59.360]  of course before that 1776 and said turn in your guns at Lexington and Concord the
[36:59.360 --> 37:03.840]  Declaration of Independence was in 1776 Lexington and Concord before that in
[37:03.840 --> 37:10.400]  April and of course that kicked off the shot heard around the world we are
[37:10.400 --> 37:15.240]  declaring Molan Lombay on our children on our private property on our guns on
[37:15.240 --> 37:21.680]  our free speech on our culture on our sovereignty that's what Molan Lombay is
[37:21.680 --> 37:28.280]  all about and so this new camouflage Molan Lombay special forces style I
[37:28.280 --> 37:31.080]  said I want to like the special forces style that are so popular with the
[37:31.080 --> 37:36.680]  American flag and camo on the left arm in full wars on the back and then the
[37:36.680 --> 37:45.160]  big Molan Lombay Spartan on the front with 250 cal shells crossed it is a
[37:45.160 --> 37:52.680]  very good looking shirt says 1776 on both sides of the helmet and I put this on
[37:52.680 --> 37:58.120]  today I've never worn it it's been in for a few weeks and everywhere I went just
[37:58.120 --> 38:03.440]  because I was doing some business downtown went into a cafe was walking
[38:03.440 --> 38:08.400]  through a parking garage I came into the office and was mobbed over this shirt I
[38:08.400 --> 38:15.760]  think it's the biggest hit we're ever gonna have and it's super handsome and I
[38:15.760 --> 38:20.840]  had two women ask me do you have it in women's like words you get that and do
[38:20.840 --> 38:24.600]  they have it in in for women and know the answer is we don't we probably come
[38:24.600 --> 38:29.240]  out with one for women that say black on gray maybe but we'll immediately try to
[38:29.240 --> 38:31.920]  get that in the pipeline don't mean to take a bunch of time out getting into
[38:31.920 --> 38:35.080]  this it's not just a plug we're talking about Molan Lombay come and take it
[38:35.080 --> 38:39.160]  where those type of stands come from the Alamo they said come and take it and
[38:39.160 --> 38:45.840]  they all died just like in Greece but they are now immortal and really no one
[38:45.840 --> 38:51.400]  out there can try to say that they weren't men and that they didn't have
[38:51.400 --> 38:56.560]  amazing courage because that's what people really admire is the underdog
[38:56.560 --> 39:01.600]  that won't back down in the face of a tyrant and they try to demonize Texas
[39:01.600 --> 39:06.240]  Santa Ana was later overthrown in Mexico he lost Guatemala as well that was
[39:06.240 --> 39:10.280]  part of Mexico he was a horrible thug like Hitler like Napoleon like King
[39:10.280 --> 39:15.080]  George III so that's what it comes down to so if everybody will go to info
[39:15.080 --> 39:19.280]  or store.com it makes a great Christmas gift and we're producing as many of
[39:19.280 --> 39:25.200]  these as we can it is now the newest best-seller long-sleeved camo Molan

[39:37.400 --> 39:44.400]  iodine X2 we have an emergency order in trying to produce more but the crystals
[39:44.400 --> 39:49.120]  are very volatile and it takes time in the laboratory laboratory factory to
[39:49.120 --> 39:56.800]  produce it and then to infuse it by gas in a secret patented system into the
[39:56.800 --> 40:02.480]  organic palm oil heart of palm oil we're selling out of the survival shield X2
[40:02.480 --> 40:05.640]  we do have a stockpile of original survival shield but at this rate it'll

[40:18.320 --> 40:21.880]  it into something that was truly cutting edge and it turned out to just be the
[40:21.880 --> 40:28.240]  best thing ever in supplements and we have it info wars life calm and we have

[41:16.200 --> 41:21.720]  dot com about prison planet dot com and about the local radio stations website
[41:21.720 --> 41:25.360]  and how they can tune into this broadcast all right because that's the
[41:25.360 --> 41:30.400]  easiest way to wake somebody up is just point them at the show now before I get
[41:30.400 --> 41:33.800]  back into Ebola and before I get into the economy and just a bunch of massively
[41:33.800 --> 41:42.040]  important news Patriot Act news GMO news huge stock market news before I get into
[41:42.040 --> 41:48.400]  all that was Steve quail coming up and Obama preparing his amnesty plan they've
[41:48.400 --> 41:51.320]  already launched it he's just gonna announce it basically no borders
[41:51.320 --> 41:56.680]  North American Union the CDC has now come out and told you what we told you two
[41:56.680 --> 42:01.360]  months ago that it is spread by sneezes it is airborne and in cold temperatures
[42:01.360 --> 42:05.600]  it can live for days on surfaces and travel miles it's in the Army manuals
[42:05.600 --> 42:10.640]  it's in the CDC manuals it's in the WHO manuals all we did was write articles
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.480]  two and a half months ago off the manuals so it's not that I'm a virologist
[42:14.480 --> 42:18.120]  it's not that I'm a rocket scientist it's not that I'm an astrophysicist it's
[42:18.120 --> 42:22.400]  not that I'm a meteorologist it's not that I'm a historian it's not that I'm a
[42:22.400 --> 42:27.840]  former top FBI agent or top CIA agent or top NSA agent or top everything or top
[42:27.840 --> 42:32.680]  special forces commander it's that I've interviewed thousands of them the top
[42:32.680 --> 42:40.000]  hackers the top scientists the top GMO scientist the top activist I'm here some
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.560]  days up to 18 hours a day immersed in this that's why we know what we're
[42:44.560 --> 42:51.440]  talking about just like somebody who watches 18 hours a day of sports center
[42:51.440 --> 42:57.600]  can could be a commentator because you've learned all that mindless fluff I'm
[42:57.600 --> 43:03.960]  talking to new listeners I didn't do that I tried to learn about put options in
[43:03.960 --> 43:10.000]  short-selling and naked shorts and the branches of government and federal rulings
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.880]  and how the courts work in different regions of the world and mysteries of
[43:13.880 --> 43:20.680]  the universe just that are all around us endless data in endless information and
[43:20.680 --> 43:25.720]  it's just so amazing how wonderful this world is but at the same time how ugly
[43:25.720 --> 43:31.200]  it is and the two contrast together in a palette that is beyond anything that
[43:31.200 --> 43:38.120]  could come out of the mind of Hieronymus Bosch meets Beethoven meets Sigmund
[43:38.120 --> 43:49.840]  Freud and Carl Jung all mixed together with explosions and sunsets and the
[43:49.840 --> 43:58.920]  deepest sea I want to write a book about the wonders of the world and all of the
[43:58.920 --> 44:03.600]  magic experiences that I've personally had and I've shared with others and and
[44:03.600 --> 44:10.200]  just the depth of how incredible consciousness is on a planet in deep
[44:10.200 --> 44:16.280]  space staring out at trillions of galaxies and we're here looking at Obama
[44:16.280 --> 44:30.500]  and red carpets and Miley Cyrus that's the devil for you dominating our
[44:30.500 --> 44:34.720]  consciousness making us focus in just to have a little bit of freedom we have to
[44:34.720 --> 44:42.240]  fight and claw with these control freaks that want to insert us into a giant
[44:42.240 --> 44:53.360]  Times Square false reality bombarding us with all their narcissistic slop what a
[44:53.360 --> 44:58.360]  joke I want to transcend these people and I realize more than ever
[44:58.360 --> 45:03.760]  transcending them mentally spiritually with our consciousness understanding
[45:03.760 --> 45:09.560]  that and not having fear but at the same time having great energy against the
[45:09.560 --> 45:17.440]  enemy to overthrow their system in a peaceful revolution of total
[45:17.440 --> 45:23.600]  renaissance the great enlightenment of enlightenment freeing the minds of men
[45:23.600 --> 45:31.400]  and women everywhere but can you handle consciousness can you handle being awake
[45:31.400 --> 45:36.960]  doesn't mean you believe what I believe it means you stare out into the vastness
[45:36.960 --> 45:44.480]  of God's creation it's incredible speaking of consciousness and perception
[45:44.480 --> 45:48.120]  here's the definition of the Overton window it is a political theory that
[45:48.120 --> 45:52.360]  describes the range of ideas the public will accept as a narrow window according
[45:52.360 --> 45:56.800]  to the theory and ideas political viability depends mainly on whether
[45:56.800 --> 46:01.400]  it falls within the window rather than on politicians individual preferences it
[46:01.400 --> 46:08.840]  is named for its orator or an originator Joseph P. Overton a former vice
[46:08.840 --> 46:17.520]  president of the Manaki Center for public policy and he went on at any given
[46:17.520 --> 46:21.800]  climate of public opinion which a politician can recommend without being
[46:21.800 --> 46:28.440]  considered too extreme to gain or keep public office and what they do is they
[46:28.440 --> 46:32.840]  try to shock the Overton window they know when they come out on MSNBC and say
[46:32.840 --> 46:36.760]  two plus two equals five your kids belong to the state fathers are bad all
[46:36.760 --> 46:42.600]  sex between a man and woman is rape two plus two might equal three you didn't
[46:42.600 --> 46:47.320]  build your business small businesses don't hire people raising the debt
[46:47.320 --> 46:50.080]  limit doesn't raise the debt limit we're never gonna come after your guns
[46:50.080 --> 46:54.480]  it's pro-second amendment to turn your guns in aka Bloomberg all of these
[46:54.480 --> 46:59.840]  attacks on reality are meant to just shock you until you just accept anything
[46:59.840 --> 47:07.920]  it's destroying the entire window where you're in a catatonic state of cognitive
[47:07.920 --> 47:14.280]  learned helplessness dissidents and normalcy bias where the new normal is
[47:14.280 --> 47:19.600]  anything goes for the system and whoever is on television whoever is
[47:19.600 --> 47:24.920]  establishment whoever says they're in charge but then you play with a Nerf
[47:24.920 --> 47:29.240]  gun in your backyard when you're 12 and you're gonna be suspended and the police
[47:29.240 --> 47:33.160]  are gonna come or you post a shot of yourself on Facebook with a BB gun
[47:33.160 --> 47:38.320]  yours expelled even though there's no law and no jurisdiction of the school
[47:38.320 --> 47:41.960]  just like they'll arrest parents who don't vaccinate their children when
[47:41.960 --> 47:46.760]  there's no law to vaccinate and they'll go lie to the jury and charge them under
[47:46.760 --> 47:56.520]  something else and the lawyer will play along and won't even tell you the feds
[47:56.520 --> 48:04.760]  are scrambling to buy hazmat suits top link on drudge report calm in full
[48:04.760 --> 48:08.240]  wars calm you add that in with Obama saying other probably be some more
[48:08.240 --> 48:14.080]  Ebola cases tells me there's a cover-up for after the election I think the Ebola
[48:14.080 --> 48:18.400]  overall is real and I think it is spreading I don't know how bad and I
[48:18.400 --> 48:20.800]  think they're covering it up and I know doctors say they're disappearing people
[48:20.800 --> 48:27.120]  but that's the overton window if they can go into hospitals and have the
[48:27.120 --> 48:31.640]  hospitals go along with where the feds no paperwork we're disappearing people
[48:31.640 --> 48:37.320]  and doctors go public and there's no investigation they didn't come out and
[48:37.320 --> 48:41.960]  say that doctor we had almost a liar he runs three hospitals three regional
[48:41.960 --> 48:47.440]  clinics he reported the place he did his internship Harry Truman Center that
[48:47.440 --> 48:52.280]  there was Ebola or what looked like Ebola they didn't respond they didn't
[48:52.280 --> 48:56.600]  deny they didn't fire him they didn't say jack squat even though that was in
[48:56.600 --> 49:02.160]  newspapers all over the country saying look what Alex Jones is up to now and I
[49:02.160 --> 49:05.600]  talked to other medical doctors that say the same things going on see the
[49:05.600 --> 49:10.080]  overton window where the media sits there and ridicules us for having sources
[49:10.080 --> 49:15.960]  by name putting their jobs and lives on the line and they just say look at the
[49:15.960 --> 49:22.400]  nutball look at the nutball he didn't want to bring a bowl a patient said he
[49:22.400 --> 49:25.480]  says it'll spread and it started spreading look at the nutball look at the
[49:25.480 --> 49:30.240]  number it's not that I'm saying oh aren't I smart I'm in the normalcy area
[49:30.240 --> 49:34.080]  historically they call me a deranged right-wing conspiracy theorist at the
[49:34.080 --> 49:40.600]  White House media matters because I'm simply saying two plus two equals four
[49:40.600 --> 49:46.800]  and if anybody resonates with that that's game over for them so see that's
[49:46.800 --> 49:53.320]  the overton window that's why they came out in the Journal of Medical Ethics in
[49:53.320 --> 49:59.640]  February of 2012 and said we should be able to kill babies for any reason if the
[49:59.640 --> 50:03.720]  state of the parents want up to age three period they're not humans the state
[50:03.720 --> 50:06.360]  will judge when you're human when you're old or when you're young just like they
[50:06.360 --> 50:10.800]  decide veterans whether they be 25 years old or 87 years old don't need to get
[50:10.800 --> 50:14.200]  brain surgery don't need to get lung surgery don't need to have a knee fix
[50:14.200 --> 50:17.080]  don't need to have heart surgery and they give you pain pills and say go home
[50:17.080 --> 50:20.440]  and die and there's a secret death list and it all came out and nobody got in
[50:20.440 --> 50:25.640]  trouble and now they've got it in one of the biggest sites out there college
[50:25.640 --> 50:30.600]  fix trending more college students support post birth abortion and it
[50:30.600 --> 50:36.240]  links to TV shows and news articles and stories where it is the new hot thing to

[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.720]  spread to the air fed scramble for hazmat suit see they're getting ready to
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:11.000]  after the election I think more and more it's becoming clear to then let
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:19.640]  people know that Ebola spreading they're just pushing it till next week so I
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.280]  guess you'll get ready Wednesday Thursday Friday we'll start hearing about
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.840]  the new Ebola cases next week even in fact that's what's happening and it
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.560]  looks like Obama's getting us ready for it saying in a speech we played the clip
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:35.040]  earlier let's cue that back up Americans may still see some Ebola cases
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:41.480]  Obama says but it's no big deal and there's 250,000 hazmat suits on top of
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:46.360]  the millions that are being sent different agencies that are being ordered
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:02:01.400]  by the CDC to Dallas right now 250,000 did you hear me did you hear what I just
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:07.920]  said that's up on info wars.com right now and by the way get them to red link
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:11.960]  all this I think Watson can add my statement in there that this more and
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:17.160]  more leans towards very strong indicators that they know it's spreading
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.880]  they've been covering it up I don't know how bad they knew their policies would
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.200]  cause it to spread and they're just getting everybody ready with Obama's
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.880]  statement and these and these hazmat suits this this doesn't look good I'm
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:35.600]  in Texas I am three and a half hours away I got family in Dallas I am so sick
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:41.640]  of this I am so tired of it and then as soon as that new czar got in he's a
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.840]  media controller a spin doctor that's why there was never press conferences they
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.280]  just shut everything down put the spin out it was no big deal to kill it as an
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:55.000]  election issue so they can push the vaccines and the police state after and
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.240]  Obama can use that as a smoke screen for executive power to then sign his amnesty
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:04.240]  plan shut down the power plants launch all the new wars I mean here they're as
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:09.400]  soon as this is over and he's a lame duck as soon as this election is over and
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.600]  they've tried to steal it or whatever they're up to I mean you can just feel

[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.720]  people I've talked to is one of the best ways to protect yourself if you make it
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:44.640]  complex and change it frequently it is biometrics that can be hacked because
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:52.080]  they simply hack the code key which is a password itself to the algorithm we
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:58.040]  talked to the top hackers Microsoft wants you to go to biometrics that's
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:01.560]  why all their new software coming out in the last few years and Apple's doing
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.680]  everybody else is biometric then that's going to be compromised and they're
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:12.120]  going to move to in the body chip I just said this two days ago and now it's in
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:16.360]  the news and the article that they would say what they're going to replace it
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:20.080]  with they just say some other exciting technologies it's biometric retina scan
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:25.960]  thumb print or index finger or voice print and that's all very easy to
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:33.160]  compromise the password is still the best system and that's why they're moving to
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:38.800]  get rid of it this is just one little micron in the overall pantheon or
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:46.440]  cornucopia or sea or ocean or universe of things they're moving on the average
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:50.480]  person would read this and go oh the White House cares about my security it's
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:57.240]  been Bank of America and Chase and Walmart and Target and Apple they're
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:00.520]  the ones that compromise the cloud they're the ones that compromise the
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.720]  loyalty card they're the ones you know tens of millions of people social
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.760]  security numbers and bank account info Bank of America it's dumped out on
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:13.680]  purpose the systems designed to be compromised to force you into total
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:19.120]  control I've been saying that for a decade they're bringing down the old web
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:24.400]  that's really the new expanding free web to bring in the new web 2.0 the smart
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:30.080]  web that's really the slave web now here's the bombshell breaking news I'm
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:37.520]  not going to say if it's UPS or whether it's FedEx or whether it's DHL but it's
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:44.440]  one of the biggest one of the big three not gonna say their colors blue brown or
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:53.040]  yellow but a manager with one of those major companies is currently shipping
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:12:00.800]  today the order came in yesterday 250,000 hazmat suits to Dallas Texas alone
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:07.640]  that is a massive order of the spacesuits exclusive US government orders
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.400]  200,000 hazmat suits can be sent to Dallas manager with large shipping
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:17.680]  company confirms purchase and we got his email his ID his name and contacting
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:23.800]  back at the company this is a manager for preservation of themselves and their
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.640]  family are telling us just like medical doctors have gone on and off record and
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.880]  board patrol has gone on record by name that months ago they were grabbing
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:34.440]  people with that they thought had Ebola and disappearing it and the board
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.920]  patrol said you're supposed to fill out this paperwork and they said hey sit out
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:45.440]  and shut up this is COG martial law bud why then would they bring in Ebola
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:48.480]  patients why would they tell the nurse go ahead and fly why would they let this
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:54.520]  doctor go to bowling alleys when he was sick and to the most busy subway a line
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:13:00.040]  and to restaurants and taxis and now it's in mainstream news that he lied and
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:03.640]  knew he was sick and when all these places credit card record show who is
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:07.160]  this nurse that works for the CDC that refuses the quarantine who are these
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:13.640]  people who are they well there are a bunch of people that work for Al Gore and
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:19.640]  doctors without borders the head czar who tells everything's fine told the
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:25.720]  media to shut up last week and they did what they were told has been on record
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.120]  saying there are too many people in Africa that's his main focus and he works
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:35.760]  for Al Gore and is a transhumanist eugenicist in my view daily mail New
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.360]  York Ebola doctor lied to police about his travel NYPD discovered he rode
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.240]  subway ate at restaurant and went bowling after cops checked his metro
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:49.000]  card and we first reported this last week when it first broke over the weekend
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.040]  and they said all your conspiracy terrorist the cops aren't in on and on
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:57.760]  average their compartmentalized they went checked his records he's a liar what's
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:03.280]  going on here so you add that with our other story that's on drudge report
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:12.000]  dot com linked up in the left-hand corner government agencies scramble to
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  purchase hazmat suits order from one company surpasses one million as
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  concerns about Ebola linger and now I want to play this clip and go to Steve
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.240]  quail when I saw this at about 6 30 a.m. when I got up and got in front of the
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:29.680]  computer the NSA surveillance terminals what it really is dialing into the
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:36.240]  DARPA grid into the proto matrix Americans may still see some Ebola cases
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:41.720]  Reuters so that's them so they don't get blame with being blindsided too much
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.760]  you'll say I told you before the election there might be some more and I
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:49.040]  think they're getting people ready now I hope I'm wrong is it really Ebola is
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:54.920]  some other simulant we've had CIA people NSA people top lawyers that wrote the
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:00.240]  treaties and the laws like dr. Boyle say they believe it is a some type of
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:04.840]  simulant of a dial down Ebola but it's more airborne so it's worse in ways
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.520]  that's being used and Boyle pointed out that they say University of Texas bio
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:15.440]  shield federal contracts developed this a year ago and has the vaccine now
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:22.280]  being developed guessing the mutation which is impossible by the way now the
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:30.160]  CDC came out and said it is airborne it can spread by sneezing so we now take you
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:35.160]  to Steve quail Steve quail calm to give us his analysis with this new intel of
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:39.200]  what this means Steve to me it looks like they're getting people ready for
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:43.160]  more cases we know they're disappearing people and that we haven't talked in two
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:47.520]  days what's your latest intel well I think it's very succinct in what you
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:52.120]  just said Alex when you ran through number one we're seeing at the true
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:57.120]  implementation of I believe the reason why Texas is getting 250,000 suits is
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:02.200]  because again you guys are in the sights of the administration if you take the
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:07.160]  population density of every other state and dividing the amount of suits I can
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:12.800]  guarantee you that there is a no other reason for that many suits too but that's
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.440]  we're talking a quarter of a million Alex I just sent you and gave it to Nico
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:21.280]  to give to you that deagle.com this is kind of like a think tank like the
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.800]  ran corporation who kind of a factuary they put a lot of facts and
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:30.280]  actuarial tables up there they're showing the population of the United
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:37.320]  States in the year 2025 at 69 million I see that so and I did send it to you and
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:41.040]  I also sent you document I want to read this is the insurance actuaries and the
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:44.880]  insurance companies are now quietly changing people's policies and notifying
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.120]  them they won't cover Ebola they wouldn't be doing that if they weren't
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:52.760]  concerned and when you talk about Texas being under attack won't give us the
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:58.080]  federal funds that we paid in taxes for the wildfires won't shutting down the
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.920]  majority of power plants is in Texas I could go through the whole list not
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:06.360]  opening the border in California but opening the border here they are
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:11.800]  bombarding Texas absolutely now I want to make it clear to everybody and Alex
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:15.360]  has got it and you can put it up for whatever you want or whatever let me
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:20.640]  read this Alex because it's a club of Rome 1991 I sent this to you too in
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:24.560]  searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.520]  threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:32.680]  all these dangers are caused by human intervention is only through changed
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:36.880]  attitudes and behavior they can be overcome the real enemy then is
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:44.000]  humanity itself the globalist want to kill 90% of the world's and you just
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  quoted from the group even above Bilderberg they call it the first global
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.600]  revolution in the public paper where they say humanity is the enemy
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:57.200]  organizing everything around humans being bad humans being ugly humans being
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:03.040]  scum with the elite and the robots exterminating us I've come a long way
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:07.440]  just quickly and you and I started on talking together what 18 years ago not
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.040]  started but that was the first time I came on with you I think I've been on
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:14.840]  23 years I tried to get people then to understand when I wrote the book genetic
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:20.000]  armageddon the whole basis was a fact that these people hate humanity and I
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.280]  believe that's because they're all devils and fallen angels no apologies for
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:27.480]  that statement the point is genetic armageddon I said today's technology
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:32.960]  tomorrow's monsters well the last book I've written today that's critical and
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:37.960]  I guess is my one song for this whole statement on transhumanism and it's
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:42.320]  important people understand this is xenogenesis when we when I tell all
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:46.040]  these facts figures quote all the different newspapers all the different
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:50.880]  sources doesn't matter if it's doctors intelligence agents military the bottom
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.480]  line at the end of the day at the end of your show today is these people have
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:59.160]  set in plan a motion to destroy us and I want to share something every now and
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:04.160]  then you know people get it but what they don't understand is if you've got a
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.600]  child right now you know Alex I got like five kids and let's see four
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:13.240]  grandchildren and they're telling me in this report that you have that
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:18.160]  basically my kids and grandkids are dead by 2020 they're saying they're saying
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:22.960]  85 to 90 percent of your family will be murdered by them yes absolutely so
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:27.520]  ladies and gentlemen every now and then something really important comes along
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.160]  so you know we can use the words transhumanism eugenics and everything
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:37.240]  but I want you to understand this this has been there's there's a plan that
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.520]  has been placed not for even hundreds of years but thousands of years that's
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:44.360]  right stay there when we come back this is so important this is the master plan
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.360]  this is why this stuff's happening the globalists have set their plan in
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.920]  thousands of documents I want to come back with that Club of Rome document
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.840]  again and read that quote this is a library I wouldn't got this library

[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:26.720]  was a declassified by the private group 1966 minutes of a meeting codified and
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.320]  I've read the entire document we'll go over some of it right now this is just
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.760]  one document fact you'll see screenshots of it in my film in game
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:41.000]  blueprint for global enslavement 2007 the reason we know what they're going to
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.200]  do and people are amazed by it or they're frightened by it or they say oh we
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:50.040]  must be crazy and won't check into it is because they all write books and
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:54.880]  white paper saying it I've got bookshelves with hundreds of books in my
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:00.080]  office where they just admit the plan for world government men in power is a
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:05.720]  political retrospective a superclass by Rothko the Anglo-American establishment
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:13.080]  a Quigley between two ages of the Brzezinski books and then I see them
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:17.320]  write stuff 50 years ago 40 years ago 30 years ago and you know what I'm now
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:21.960]  living it 20 years ago they said we're gonna put boxes in all the cars and
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:26.560]  tax you by the mile 10 years ago the boxes went in now they're announced and
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:32.640]  they're gonna start the taxing the pilot programs going in Austin where I live
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:37.480]  you understand that's what's so frustrating is 95% of this is public
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:40.960]  Steve quels a short second I want to give you the floor but when you start
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.680]  bringing up these quotes and I'd even forgotten about that club of Rome
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:48.760]  document 1991 the first global revolution give people the page number
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:53.040]  we'll put it on screen from the PDF for TV viewers of where they say they're
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:59.520]  gonna organize a global government around making humanity the enemy page 75
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:08.160]  of the common enemy of humanity is man let's read this paragraph Steve
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:13.120]  quail you want me to read it Alex or I can sure I'll read it in searching for a
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:17.360]  new enemy tionitis we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:22.120]  global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:26.040]  dangers are caused by human intervention and is only through changed
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:30.280]  attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome the real enemy then is
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:35.040]  humanity itself these people hate mankind so if these are the people and I
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:39.680]  believe they're inspired by the full fury of hell and all of its emissaries
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:44.880]  then people have got to understand that when we're talking about 90 well at
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:49.920]  least at 80 to 90% population reduction in the United States my sources have
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:55.680]  said flat out they'll make sure Steve the numbers zero out at 90% the point of
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:00.280]  being is this that means all your future all your hopes all your dreams your
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:05.640]  children's future this has to be foremost in everyone's thoughts and Alex
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:10.360]  again these are transhumanists they hate humanity so when we talk about human
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:14.160]  attenuation look I wrote I and I want to share this the book I wrote Xeno
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:19.080]  Genesis is the most concise precise in my opinion and the opinion of people all
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:24.200]  over the world it has been so succinct and nailing here here what's happening
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:28.160]  anybody who's left alive that's a human will become a techno serve
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:33.840]  T.E.C.H. and no serve I coined the term techno serve them 20 years ago so the
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.000]  point that you and I are making and and God bless Texas I mean that with all my
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  heart I pray that the Texans will wake up and understand if I was told that I
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  got 250,000 suits coming into my state I'd say well look they're going to make
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.280]  sure those suits are put to good use and that's why it really troubled me that
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:00.320]  the two and two evidently doesn't equal four anymore because all of the weather
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:05.280]  modification Texas is a prolonged drought everything if I might make it
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:11.720]  simple the absolute spirit of Texas the spirit of this country is exemplified
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.800]  and it and I still understand how you get some of the governors you get but
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:21.520]  that's another point but the point being is in the illuminous mind that word
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.600]  liberty must be destroyed at all costs and that's why it's a full court press
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:33.040]  on the state of Texas so we're talking about these people hate humanity if you
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.280]  want to understand it and and look you can go searching and they know where
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:39.320]  the resistance is coming from they say that in their white papers that they
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:43.880]  have to crush Texas as the model and all their actuaries they see a resistance
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:48.800]  rising up in official Pentagon documents and surrounding states going with Texas
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:53.560]  and forming a new country in an attempt to UN takeover they've already war game
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:59.000]  the plans to attack us and they know the military will end up joining Texas well
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.360]  and that's true and by the way I was privy to the conversation everybody
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:07.280]  looks at the bunker hunt Nelson hunt and you know some other Texas wealthy people
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:10.480]  that they were just trying to corner the supermarket that was not the real story
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:14.720]  one of those wealthy men in Texas that will not use his name told me face to
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:18.800]  face almost a decade ago he said Steve the real reason that was being done
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.880]  behind the scenes so that we could come up with our own currency no I know in
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.760]  fact he worked with the hunt season like basically a billionaire you're talking
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:29.880]  about the guy out of Houston well this one was out of Dallas but trust me
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:34.520]  billionaire with with enough zeros and you'd know his name very famous and the
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:38.040]  yeah one of the one of the hunts just died last week hey what stay there this

[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:43.360]  because at five o'clock they take me to the gallows

[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:16.320]  madness whom the gods would destroy they first make mad that was first spoken by

[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:37.120]  whom the gods would destroy they would first make mad it's how the gods kill
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:43.720]  and you can see that now unfolding here today we're going right back to Steve
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:49.400]  Quayle and that's why when Steve Quayle gets on I get real excited and start
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:54.800]  jumping in and start getting upset because I say globalist documents state
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.680]  they want to reduce population by 90% you know they're on record saying that
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:02.480]  we're the main enemy in their organizing society around destroying us but see
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.600]  Steve Quayle comes on he gives a source and I do that a lot too but then I just
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:10.760]  start remembering that document and hundreds of others and my brain just
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:16.280]  explodes with the frustration that we're not making this stuff up people this is
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:23.400]  what I want to say and I want to get Steve Quayle's take on this after I talk
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:28.920]  about important issue I want to be thinking about this imagine if there
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:36.520]  was a 25 year old guy in town in your town who started writing books about how
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:41.040]  I wanted to kill 90% of people in the town you start watching him you start
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.920]  getting concerned about him and when he took a wrong step you know he'd be in
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:48.680]  jail or you the police would talk to him and say you plan to really kill
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.840]  somebody because that's premeditated we're gonna go ahead and slap you in
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:57.200]  jail right now you have David Rockefeller Zabigniew Brzezinski Henry
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.320]  Kissinger the heads of the head of Pepsi the Chinese Communist government
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:07.680]  Charlie Rose basically every globalist you can imagine talking about the big
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:13.920]  in-game being world population reduction of 90% Prince Philip that's a
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:19.920]  Ted Turner Prince Charles the Dutch Queen Beatrix her son just you name it
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:27.520]  Dr. Pionka all of them you don't get in the club unless you're in this
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:33.280]  religion see I study the religion of my captors basically that are trying to
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.360]  shut down my freedom but they don't want to make it too obvious because they
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:40.440]  want everybody to stay asleep I'm jumping up and down saying you better
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:44.360]  get awake to this they have all said their plan and you know what they're
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.560]  about five six seven years behind some parts of the plan they're 20 years
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:53.400]  behind on other parts they're ahead on some parts in my view that's a good
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:56.760]  question as quail words you think your plan is but here's the issue they are
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:02.320]  guided by a dark dream of mass death and then they merge with machines their
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:05.880]  God has told them whether you believe that or not they write about it how
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.080]  Lucifer is their God in the earth first battalion in the Pentagon that's what
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:14.000]  ministers of goats comes out of and in general stubble by and I'm not saying he
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.600]  was in he ran that but I think he's a good guy overall but and we've had the
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:22.240]  major general on and in those battalions they said we are the horseman death
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:26.000]  riding for Lucifer one world government to carry out the plan of Club of Rome I
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.120]  have that manual text Mars got one of the only copies from the Department of
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:36.920]  Defense listed classified he was a captain in the Air Force and he's a
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.680]  space and aeronautics professor people just think he's a guy that writes no
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:44.240]  books about the New World Order when you know all this information you know
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:50.160]  this is the plan and then I think about how long I've been on air 20 years and
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:53.720]  they'll play an intro the McBreen may but Charlton Heston I knew Charlton
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:59.140]  Heston I know major stubble bind I know I'm not bragging I know Dr. Frederick
[01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:02.800]  Whitehurst the head of the crime lab that exposed the FBI fraud I knew Gary
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:07.880]  Webb it's just when you do this talk show focus for 20 years and you know
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:11.520]  everybody from Steve quell to George Norrie from Ron Paul to Rand Paul and
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:17.360]  you've got all this data I don't think the average person in government is doing
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:20.480]  this much research they're compartmentalized only the alumnus are
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:23.480]  doing it and they're from their perspective we're doing the perspective
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:27.880]  research from our perspective of loving humanity wanting to build humanity but in
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:32.600]  a way you stare into the abyss you become the abyss as Nietzsche said I know
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:39.560]  their plan I live it by studying it and I'm so close to them and I don't love
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:43.760]  them I I detest them they have the quote an Enders game when you study an
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:48.520]  enemy so long you be you you you know them and then you love them no you don't
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:57.960]  love them you're seeing manifest pit of hell eighth dimension whatever you want
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:02.400]  to call it demon forces and that's what Steve quell gets into when you finally
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.880]  get to the bottom of the rabbit hole you realize that the only thing that makes
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:09.760]  sense is that it's like an extraterrestrial operation against us I'm
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:12.880]  just gonna come right out with it and I love God it's the Christian perspective
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:18.400]  it all fits right there that this is a master diabolical plan but God says we
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:22.200]  can beat it if we have knowledge we perish for lack of knowledge if we
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:27.880]  understand the mass deception because they're offering the Illuminati eternal
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:33.040]  life through computers but first they got to kill us because they got to save
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.400]  the earth but then meanwhile they're doing GMO and all this stuff that's
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:41.480]  killing the earth no folks are gonna kill the earth you understand how we're
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:46.520]  honest planet of course there's stuff jacking with us what do you think's
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:50.760]  going on can't you see it and I don't care the media matters in the White
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:54.760]  House makes fun of me I've been this I've covered skull and bones I've covered
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:59.680]  Bohemian Grove I grew up around that crap and Dallas you people all know what
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:03.920]  you're involved in and you're gonna get destroyed by it and I don't want to be
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:07.320]  destroyed by it I don't want my soul destroyed by it so whether whether it
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:12.280]  is entities or not the mass consciousness of humanity is manifesting
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:17.120]  this devilish heart type take that see either way you cut it it's real I'm
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:19.280]  going to see quell I'm gonna shut up with the balance of the hour give him the
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.920]  entire rest of the hour and then 20 minutes to the next then we'll take
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:25.840]  calls he's got so much to say he just really sets me on fire catching fires
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:30.640]  what's happening here and it's those fires the minds of men of truth and
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:34.360]  justice that will lead us out of this and all I know is it's real that's why
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:37.240]  they attack me all day and say I'm not legitimate and I don't mean what I say
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:40.600]  and it's not real because they got my phones tapped they got my MO they know
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:45.160]  who I am they know my family they know I'm real and they're into bloodlines they
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:48.040]  know my family bloodlines are always fighting I'm going all the way back and
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:51.480]  that's just how things work and so they absolutely want to destroy me and they
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:54.440]  probably will well it matters as they won't get my soul and folks they're
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:58.280]  coming after you if you're a good person love God and love justice and love
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:01.960]  puppy dogs and kittens but you're strong and have the will to crush them they
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:05.200]  want you destroyed you understand that they don't there's no room for us in
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:11.680]  their system now before we go back to Steve quail we will sell out of x2 you
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:15.320]  notice we're sold out of the colloidal silver and it'll be a few weeks till we
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:19.760]  get more maybe high quality 30 parts per million I got a whole cupboard of it so
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:24.200]  I can give it to other people around me of need be survival shield x2 from all
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:27.040]  the science and research we even get into yesterday with Dr. group it just is

[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:40.800]  survival shield x2 is going to sell out at the current rate we thought we had
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:45.080]  enough budgeted this last a few months till more came in but everybody's you
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:48.760]  know just going after it and see what people say why don't you just make
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:52.240]  enough because we don't have the money to make a huge stockpile and then if we
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:55.680]  miscalculate we run out so if you want to get x2 you better get survival shield

[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:23.600]  going back to Steve Cuell Steve Cuell.com Steve I'm gonna shut up now you've
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:28.240]  got the floor and I'll just leave you in and out of breaks for 20 minutes in the
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:32.480]  next hour then we're going to phone calls Steve Cuell go ahead. Well first of
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:38.120]  all Alex I love the name prison planet that you chose because that is exactly
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:43.360]  what we're seeing we're seeing the doors of freedom every door that we've known
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:51.120]  of liberty of a choice we're being absolutely led like a cattle to the
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:56.320]  slaughter shoot in order to understand the and like you said you understand the
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:02.320]  enemy I do and I want to make this clear when I am talking about for instance a
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:05.880]  book I wrote you know Genesis I'm not just pitching the book to people to buy
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:10.560]  it I'm saying after after living this stuff and Alex will tell you to you live
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:16.920]  this stuff 24-7 when you come to the ultimate conclusion and you draw that
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:21.720]  conclusion for the listeners and the readers they see it they say Mike well
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:25.240]  this is what's going on that's what we're looking for because only then will
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:28.800]  people get active and and you know Alex I mentioned Breathe No Evil the other day
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:33.320]  we sold out after your show I'll probably sell out of Xenogenesis I've got
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:39.920]  you know enough to meet the demand but Xenogenesis was my last attempt at
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:46.200]  basically saying here it's all in other words I came to the end of my rope and
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:50.000]  trying to tell people because we're right there you know there are people
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  arguing we've got this much time we don't have this much time here or
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.400]  there or just kind of like you said I believe we are at the closing moments
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:01.760]  and I don't mean that like we've got hours or days left but we don't know
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:07.600]  that and what we're doing right now is dealing with a situation where the
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:12.920]  Illuminati of the Satanists the about Luciferian worshipers are literally
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:19.000]  licking their chops what people don't understand is that it's going to be so
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.080]  and I don't mean to you know sell gore but I'm saying it's going to be so
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:27.160]  difficult for the people that Jesus the men's hearts will fail them here looking
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:31.120]  after those things coming upon the earth now the other day you and I were talking
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:36.040]  when we were on last about the hundred truck convoy where I think was Conway
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:41.080]  Parade and Coca-Cola trucks and somebody actually sent me Alex an email saying
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:43.720]  well they're going to the Special Olympics they're not going to the
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:48.360]  Special Olympics good night the Special Olympics needs probably no more than
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:54.000]  one semi truck load to set up any athletic activity in the country so the
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:00.160]  idea that these let's just say this these globalist these the elitists they're
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:05.880]  already stacking and they're already stocking according to my sources for the
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:12.400]  last hurrah they do intend to do some really nasty stuff not only in Texas I
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:16.720]  have you know ladies and gentlemen wherever you see the displacement of
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:21.920]  any individuals from West Africa even Bosnia Montana has them the callous
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.880]  bell has them the point being is that you've got to understand this is their
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:31.960]  matrix Alex years ago I when I came out with the the book breathe no evil and
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:36.760]  then later genetic arm again I came out with a term called an effect on people
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.320]  couldn't even you know everybody was used to watching terrorists blow
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:44.720]  themselves up but then no one would acknowledge at least intellectually
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:48.720]  that there are people that will intentionally infect themselves in
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:54.520]  order to kill millions because in this global war this cosmic war taking place
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:59.840]  on planet Earth there are people who believe that they are Lucifer's servants
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:05.040]  and they are more unfortunately they're more geared up to doing what they're
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:09.320]  going to do then the Christians who I should see this and react saying all
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:14.600]  that I'm just in I'm just encouraging people please you know go to my website
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:19.200]  Steve quail.com and look at the book xenogenesis you'll see a picture of a
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:25.600]  flying saucer you'll see a picture of a robotic hand and a a generated embryo
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:31.720]  in a lap and xenogenesis simply means the adding of animal or third-party DNA
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:36.640]  into the human genome so when I said genetic arm again that's where we're at
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:40.280]  Alex when these people in the in it doesn't matter if it's Iran corporation
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:43.920]  deagle it doesn't matter all the stuff you have on your shelves I don't have
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:48.560]  any shelves left Alex I put it all my books now in clear plastic cubs because
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:54.440]  I just ran out of shelves but the point being is is that it's now to the point
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:59.000]  where everything you've warned about all your movies all your videos all your
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.200]  radio broadcasts and it is interesting somebody taking on somebody with
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:08.760]  knowledge it's kind of double you know the state me probably quoted it in a
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:13.800]  time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act for those
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:17.200]  who listen to you listen to me listen to us and listen to all the other
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:22.640]  alternative nurse the savage whoever the point being is that we are trying to give
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:27.960]  them the lateness of the hour and the lateness of the hour isn't more just
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:31.680]  information we've got to provoke them to going here's here's let me share this
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:35.320]  because most people don't know this when I brought out the red list the blue
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:39.560]  list the green list and when I brought out what was in store for us that was
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:42.680]  given to me once again by the heavy environmental protection agency over
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:47.720]  Western United States who was murdered within a couple years of giving that
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:53.840]  information he basically said when you saw it when you see what you're seeing
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:59.800]  when you see doctors and you see nurses and positions being put into harm's
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:03.440]  way said Steve that's part of the plan we discussed that a little bit
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:09.200]  curative process well ladies and gentlemen you must understand this 241
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:13.960]  thousand positions aren't going to join Obamacare and as we've heard the vets
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:17.680]  are being cut off from their painkillers or legitimate medicine I'm not talking
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:24.600]  about drug users the shortage Alex of drugs is 100 viably important drugs
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:29.080]  it's being shut off so in other words it's not just a question to a quote
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:34.640]  elective surgery it'll be a question of life and death so you're going to see the
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:38.920]  entire medical system taken apart not just through Obamacare but by the
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:45.520]  forcing out of doctors and nurses by basically keeping them from being able
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:49.480]  to do their job and that's what we're seeing all over the country in Montana
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:55.280]  I watched the local broadcast coming out of Calisbell a disease especially showing
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:01.320]  a normal hospital room being set up to deal with Ebola that's so much BS I
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:06.920]  wanted to basically throw my bar stool at the TV now I didn't do it okay and I
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:12.920]  that's just how figuratively angry I got you cannot deal with this stuff if it
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:17.800]  truly is Ebola now as you and I did the show the other day this is not the
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:23.480]  hemorrhagic fever this is not Ebola Marburg it is not Ebola Reston it's not
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:29.560]  those it's a bio weapon we're beyond that but dealing with now and please you
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:34.200]  know one of the generals who lives in your hometown by the way Alex told me
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:39.800]  this and you just quoted when you stare into the abyss never forget Steve the
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:45.640]  abyss stares back at you when you stare into the abyss the abyss stares back at
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:49.320]  you when you talk about this you've been to the Builder burgers you have
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:55.560]  personally been there and the point is is that people have such little regard for
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:00.080]  original thinking or the ability to think like don't confuse me with facts my
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:03.400]  mind is already made up so ladies and gentlemen one of the most important things
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:07.640]  I can tell you that I know in real time and Alex you know talk me during the
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:11.320]  break and I'll send you what I'm going to tell you one of the things that
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:16.080]  everyone has forgotten is that your cell phone and this really bugs me this is
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:21.400]  really on my heart that your cell phone is a tracking beacon doesn't matter if
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:25.560]  it's a stingray technology doesn't matter if it's any of the other 20 products
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:31.920]  they're out on the market so one of the generals I used to basically talk to
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:37.480]  they told me he said Steve they have so many hellfire missiles and I put up an
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:41.840]  article by a guy named Michael who's a an international consultant in project
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:45.600]  of the Bacchia. Stay there tell us about how they're gonna track us and

[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:12.040]  I remember it was six seven eight years ago before the census was even starting
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:16.600]  up he said look out they're gonna GPS every one of your doorways and they're
[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:20.960]  targeting it for hellfire missiles out of drones later and this general told me
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:27.600]  this is what Steve Cuell was saying and I know he's talking about retired that
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:30.360]  this was being loaded into the systems well that's because they already do
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:34.400]  that they kill most the quote alkyda leaders and stuff and people they want
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:38.320]  to kill with their cell phone they use it once and they kill them so that's known
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:43.480]  not just from the general it's on record but it what's not known is that zip
[01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:49.040]  codes are artillery grids and bombing grids here in the US that's on record
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:53.280]  since the 40s the highways were built everything's designed for the US to be a
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:57.280]  big wargame model the internet was designed by the people that run our
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:03.120]  country all of it it's a master intelligence whatever it is and it's
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:09.240]  manipulating everyone while we build the system for it the beast the devil the
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:12.840]  people that run it whatever it is it's evil and through the group collective it
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:18.440]  is a entity the internet they believe it's probably already conscious with
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:21.600]  with all of our minds and information feeding into it the inventor of the
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:25.920]  internet said that months after I said it because it's prima facie and this is
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:29.760]  really sophisticated stuff this is a short segment Steve but yeah why don't
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:34.000]  people like block it pocket that we sell or you sell systems that you put your
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.040]  phone in when you're not using it so you don't get tracked but what you got a
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:41.000]  tack for saying that and then a few years later they did the census and it
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.720]  turned out they were marking GPS and it was going to Homeland Security and they
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:48.400]  were using drones to track farmers and they are now weaponizing them it's just
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:52.240]  people aren't ready to understand how serious this is Steve Quill tell your
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:57.000]  story well first of all really quick it's one thing that everyone understands
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.840]  a cell phone there are people that try and take the battery out put it to wrap
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:06.000]  it in aluminum foil I had a defense contractor from Europe contact me and
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.080]  tell me what's going on most people don't realize not only are they tracking
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:14.720]  they're downloading your phone and your computers of specific airports around
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:19.040]  the country Alex and in essence even with password protection as you stated
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:22.360]  anytime you've got a computer you've got a back door unless you've got
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:28.200]  sophisticated telemetry and blocking devices the point being is that you
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:32.760]  sell them I sell them the silent pocket let me just tell you this a whole group
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:39.040]  of the military in Ukraine was wiped out by multiple rocket launchers and they
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:42.240]  were using the cell phones for communication because a cell phone
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:49.440]  coverage in any battlefield now is so good and and finally the you know I
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:52.880]  guess with Ukrainians figured out they can't use their cell phones well people
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:56.960]  got to understand I don't know you Alex if you had a drone over you I've had I've
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:02.360]  had a predator over me a hundred feet AGL above ground level and so by the grace
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:07.040]  of God and I thank all the intercessors who pray for Alex your family your safety
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:11.640]  your children's safety who pray for me you know the point being is they've got
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:17.280]  to get him and we sell I think and this is important the veterans here's who I
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:20.880]  was told are the top guys already programmed in it as you already said
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:25.440]  this has been in line but they're keying it up now when the goal is given it's a
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:30.800]  veteran's okay it's Red Lister's it's these people and they're planning Alex
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:36.080]  on absolutely making a blitzkrieg and I pray against that and I pray the living
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:40.440]  God interferes with their technology I claim the promise the Bible that God
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:44.840]  uses the wicked devices against them and I'm seeing that happening in real time
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:49.520]  sometimes but this is critical to people they have to be proactive with their
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:54.440]  life they can no longer sit as a spectator just listening to Jones listening
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:59.000]  to quail you know and gee you know those doom purveyors or whatever I'm sure
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.720]  you've heard it all too but now there's nothing I always ask yourself this what
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:09.080]  more can you tell that isn't already in play what you've been worrying about it
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:13.080]  for 20 years it's crazy when we come back Steve I want you to lay out from all

[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:40.120]  we're gonna give the number out in the next segment and the third segment of
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:43.320]  the sour will start calls for questions or comments for Steve quail or

[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:50.760]  planet dot com that we're gonna cover in the next segment but Steve roll out the
[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:56.720]  Luciferian mindset and now that we see them rolling out the driverless cars the
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:02.880]  control grid saying humanity's the enemy kill children up to age five abort them
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:08.080]  kill the vets they are accelerating their plan now it was already it was all
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:11.600]  set up and it just keeps accelerating at a frightening rate what do you see
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:15.560]  happening well first of all we're watching it with the Ebola and we're
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:20.440]  also at watching it with Isis in other words Alex you've got to give the eye
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:24.840]  gate your eyes and they hear gate your ears you've got to give them sounds and
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:31.080]  images that that basically can control people by fear and so with the Ebola
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:36.400]  used to be one of the most I would say this and the true Ebola is one of the
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:42.280]  most deadly viral pathogens in the world even though this is not that even the
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:45.840]  name what I'm saying is when I say psychological operation I don't mean
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:50.280]  people aren't dying and I don't mean that this isn't a true bio weapon what I'm
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:54.680]  saying is it's not what they claim it to be so what they're doing and the
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:59.880]  globalists have always maintained that they'll use nuclear weapons they'll use
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:06.040]  and that's what we're seeing by the way going into effect right now but the
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:12.200]  idea of a threat with enough blood and gore to get everyone's attention and
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:16.400]  then you know just conveniently they'll come up with their answers I see the
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:21.040]  vaccine and you and I did this on your show when SARS was on remember I came up
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:25.600]  the statement shot the arm shot in the head either way you end up dead you
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:32.120]  cannot expect the people that openly show contempt for the human race saying
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:36.080]  that they have to lower the amount of people on the planet the ones that are
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:41.400]  going into their underground bunkers 260 in this country alone supposedly then
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:50.840]  the idea that these guys and let's just call me these ghouls are as dedicated to
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:56.760]  their cause of killing all of us except them of course to bring about this
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:04.160]  techno utopia all this these promises are like Lucifer himself it's a masquerade
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:08.360]  they're promising a future of our eternal life apart from God they're
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:12.640]  promising a future where you'll never grow old when your body wears out they
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:15.720]  get you a new body and by the way you don't need to worry about it because
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:21.160]  we're to give you superhero facilities and faculties and we're going to make you
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:28.240]  into ubermen niches superman and by the way you know DARPA and every single hidden
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:36.240]  black budget you know money that they're given or money that they generate
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:41.360]  through their illegal operations the point being is that it's all going to
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:46.240]  this it's all going to the plan of how do you eradicate the world's population
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:52.720]  and bring about this utopia that's what Lucifer is promising him who knows this
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:57.000]  GNOSIS which is a Greek word for knowledge so these people basically are
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:02.440]  painting this utopian picture but it ends at the cliff and once you tell
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:08.320]  through the beautiful television set or movie set you're over the cliff and
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:13.120]  you're into eternity lost forever so that's right and Peter Thiel came out
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:15.680]  the billionaire Bilderberg members said I want to live forever I put all the
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:19.880]  money into that that's what all of them are into Peter Thiel the billionaire
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:23.760]  tech entrepreneur on a mission to cheat death that Ray Kurzweil all of them this
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:31.040]  is the cult well it is the cult and again the thing is that all of the money the
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:36.520]  most advanced bio life extension is going on one of the guys who's a molecular

[02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:20.920]  frontal assault on the lives of the new world order it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:33.640]  radio network raising the alarm for humanity I'm gonna say something that's
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:37.520]  probably the most important thing I've ever sat on here and I've said it many
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:42.760]  different ways many times but it just hits me so hard that I've been waking up
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:45.440]  in the middle of the night thinking about this and and I'm going to try to
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:50.680]  really get this message out in different ways to people the globalist in their
[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:56.880]  own white papers like the 1991 Club of Rome document adopted by the EU the UN
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:09:02.520]  and others and the UN UNESCO program states that they will organize society
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:06.800]  around humans being ugly and bad and reducing our population and will
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:14.560]  organize the world government around making quote humans the enemy so when
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:18.640]  you hear them say two plus two equals five and dads are bad and families are
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:28.720]  bad and hey let's put the veterans on secret death list it's about dehumanizing
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:33.640]  and getting you into accepting that you're worthless so that when you're
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:37.040]  being killed or you're being denied care or you're being poisoned your
[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:40.560]  neighbors won't care about you either this idea that I don't care about anyone
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:44.120]  so I get ahead well pretty soon nobody cares about anybody and the whole
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:52.000]  society rots and falls apart that's why everything they do is how wonderful the
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.680]  world would be without humans all these discovery channel and history channel and
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:01.200]  ABC and Fox TV shows and in the movies and humans are ugly humans are zombies
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:04.760]  they're being mowed down while the military trains to mow down groups of
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:11.160]  innocent people during a plague as zombies see they're merging reality with
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:18.480]  the television and the culture that they are selling and pushing now we sent
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:23.680]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs out this morning to talk to Austin ice because
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:28.680]  there's an article out of the college fix more college students trending more
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:34.400]  college students support post birth abortion see first abortion was shocking
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:37.560]  now it's let's kill old people let's kill troops let's not deal let's put them
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:43.120]  on secret death list and they they go to videos articles news where they're
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:46.040]  saying a large portion of college students say we should kill children up
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:51.040]  to age four to five after birth abortion
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:57.560]  now I'm gonna get Joe Biggs when he's back to the building later to pop in
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:03.920]  with us today if he's back by then to talk about his experience they but he
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:08.320]  just went out to downtown Austin in the University of Texas and the majority of
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:12.440]  people said the weakest softest-looking most pathetic
[02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:19.520]  trendies they said yeah let's kill kids because they're so weak and so into the
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:23.240]  spirit of imagining someone else losing something so they get something it's
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:26.600]  like Bill Gates up there speaking to a teachers conference four years ago going
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:31.840]  you know you do the equation if you take care of one old lady then you can't
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:36.160]  hire 10 teachers and that's a death panel you can't say that but you get rid
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:42.800]  of her you get jobs and the teachers are all oh my god yeah no you get jobs by
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:47.840]  taking care of old people all over the West they're having an on average 1.5
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:51.560]  1.4 children for every two adults the society's gonna collapse and that's
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:54.840]  what they're organizing things around is an organized collapse where only
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:59.200]  globalist high-tech citadels remain who were exempt from all the regulations
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:03.240]  this is all scientific and I've read their books where they explain it do you
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:08.560]  get it they will ban you driving cars in 10 years phasing it in now they will
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:11.440]  start taxing you by the mile in the next few years it's already starting in
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:16.320]  Europe in Germany in England they will come take your kids they will force
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:19.600]  inoculations on you and you may have a convulsion right there and ever talk
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:23.800]  again they don't care your husband or somebody gets mad they'll send a SWAT
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:28.020]  team to kill them and the SWAT teams their children will die and they will
[02:12:28.020 --> 02:12:33.480]  serve and submit to it because it's all done incrementally it's all rolled out
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:39.240]  in brainwashing phases because they are neutralizing your survival instinct now
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:43.080]  from birth through the culture through subliminals through the chemicals some of
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:47.000]  us have resistance to it and in fact a lot of studies show some people have
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.800]  resistance it will actually aggravate the more that's what you're seeing right
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:55.520]  now is a mammal seeing people under attack in their tribe I see the whole
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:00.080]  planet as my tribe by the technocrats and I am just barking and shaking the
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:04.120]  cage trying to get more of you to join me because together we can rip these
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:09.400]  bars apart now I want to take your calls for Steve Quill the next segment
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:16.280]  your specific question or comment 800 259 9231 I want to move quick though so
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:24.680]  no thanking us or anything just get to the point 800 259 9231 800 259 9231
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:30.640]  but when you go out and you know a couple years ago people couldn't believe
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:34.160]  that these medical journals said start killing babies now it's oh yeah let's
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:39.640]  kill them because weak people get off on the idea of death because they've never
[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:44.240]  actually been around it they are dishonorable they have a spirit of little
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:48.360]  piggy eyes little little weak little I mean they're just sickening lovers of
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:52.640]  death all those that hate me love death Christ said they are they are a cult and
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:57.360]  there's a weakest people they'll be the first to be annihilated they're gonna
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:00.840]  be all alone if they're lucky to grow old they'll they're not gonna have kids
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:05.400]  they're not gonna thrive they don't have a an instinct to to build they have an
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:10.040]  instinct of just total spoiled rotten decadent failures given everything by
[02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:14.440]  their parents and they are about to come into full power now the good news is
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:19.120]  they're either totally evil these young people or they're totally awake so
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:23.080]  polls show massive libertarian awakening massive awaken to the new world order by
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:28.400]  young people so let's be clear they're either totally under the thrall of the
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:31.760]  Elsie Bob call it whatever you want the spirit of the world the god of this
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:37.080]  world or they are absolutely on fire waking up Steve Quill can you augment
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:43.120]  that you disagree do you agree 800 259 9231 your questions or comments Steve I
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:48.240]  mean we're at that epic moment we're seeing the evil where we go out and half
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:51.760]  the people in one thing said yeah kill the vats we don't need them anymore half
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:56.160]  of them say you know bring a bowl of patience here immediately anything
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:01.520]  destructive there for it anything evil that they can call good I mean it is
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:05.560]  spiritual they're like robots you know what they're going to do before they do
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:10.680]  it whatever is stupid they're gonna do it Steve absolutely it's spiritual okay
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:14.800]  the bottom line is you said he came that we might have life and have it more
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:19.720]  abundantly God says what you quoted all them that hate me meaning him loved
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:24.640]  death the bottom I I'm with you I think human beings are amazing I think they're
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:29.560]  the most wonderful expression and the devil hates humanity because quite
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:33.640]  candid god created man and his image and likeness the devil's done everything to
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:38.520]  pervert that now he's beyond perverting it he's trying to totally destroy it you
[02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:44.120]  know the American male should be roaring at the top of his lungs not going
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:50.080]  meow meow I call him meow man okay and I call him meow man for a reason the
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:54.920]  bottom line is here if you're talking this the word isn't even abortion it's
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:16:01.320]  infanticide it's the murder of children and and you know I'm why are you being
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:05.480]  closed-minded and racist we need to kill children even healthy ones it's trendy
[02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:10.920]  well I got news for you you know the point being is I hear the devil in that
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:15.120]  I see the devil by the way Alex let's look at it the motion picture theater and
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:21.720]  the television set in our homes okay is nothing more than the eye of Horace at
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:26.680]  the top of the pyramid everybody thinks that you know that somehow they're
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:29.760]  gonna wait for it the great announcement the great announcement as
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:34.120]  Marshall McLuhan said you know the medium is the message and you know the eye of
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:38.960]  Soran that basically the eye of the devil the evil eye everyone's being
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:43.720]  programmed and then all the cell towers the carrier signal carrier signal the
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:47.920]  Impersonics it's no wonder that people are divorced I make the statement
[02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:54.560]  virtual reality as at its end goal to take everyone out of the real world put
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:58.440]  them into a virtual real world and keep them that virtual world if you will as
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:03.520]  an intellectual entertainment prison in order for them to take over the total
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:08.640]  plan major studies at the BBC reported on a decade ago they know four hours of
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:13.240]  television destroys neurons and creates massive massive brain damage in
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:17.280]  children and Alzheimer's and adults and now degenerative disorders of the brain
[02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:22.320]  are off the chart it is absolutely wrecking our brain as a one-eyed
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:28.240]  positronic warfare spectrum system telepresence you know we're right
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:32.160]  there and you know again Alex that's why that's why oh I want people to
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:36.320]  understand I work backwards I read the title chapter the book and then go
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:39.840]  backwards that's how I started reading the Bible book of revelation the bottom
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:44.760]  line is is that we're at that point now where if people can understand hey that
[02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:49.840]  those 90% people they want dead and and I just saw it on Alex Jones television
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:54.400]  channel that that's a real thing that means 200 and you know 50 million people
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:58.720]  have got to die well how can you kill that many people according to my EPA
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:04.880]  murdered friend they have it down pun intended to a science and the science
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:09.360]  simply is this they create the problem it's just a needle on a medical
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:13.680]  dialectic they create the problem they provide their solution oh the vaccine is
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:18.880]  good for you it's a binary weapon yeah then you die and then the chemtrails you
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:22.120]  know thank you for giving me credit for that when I broke that story they thought
[02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:26.000]  I stepped off of Mars although I would have given anything to go to Mars the
[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:31.720]  point being is that people will not to this day acknowledge it chemtrails are
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:37.160]  real I can post every article by the way aircraft.org good site aircraft main
[02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:42.080]  line patents Bill Gates involved all of it admitted it is secret government
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:46.840]  programs he classified congressional hearings UN treaties doesn't exist it
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:51.600]  doesn't and the point being is that this the everything everything and let's
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:57.320]  just make this a maximum everything they do is to kill everything they say is to
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:01.200]  lie and remember this ladies and gentlemen when Alex or I or anybody is
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:05.920]  quoting facts they don't care about the facts that's what you've got to
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:10.320]  understand there is no truth in them I believe their father is the devil he was
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:15.120]  a liar from the beginning so the point being is that when people Alex I'm sure
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:19.960]  you get it too well if Alex and Steve were trucking surely mainstream media
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:26.440]  anybody that says that in my opinion is already a brain dead automaton well what
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:30.600]  we say always comes out later but with establishment spent on it right and so
[02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:34.680]  and by the way no matter what we talk about it used to amaze me going coast
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:38.240]  to coast Alex and obviously in those days with our bell men into George Norrie
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:41.640]  and I would say something about clandestine nuclear weapons here's a
[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:44.560]  good example stay there I want to hear about the lesson I want to hear about
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:48.800]  the lesson nuclear weapons when we come back let's talk to Dave Bob Jason Ray

[02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:07.160]  we're gonna start going to your phone calls Alex Jones here back live but
[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:12.440]  Nico and others will just take what I'm saying on air and just type it in to the
[02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:21.240]  NSA globalist interface known as Google and the nigga comes he goes yeah you were
[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:24.760]  just talking about how Google is really artificially intelligent already
[02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:29.320]  clearly that's how Amazon has a similar system they can ship your package
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:32.640]  before you order it it knows what you're gonna order with almost total
[02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:39.440]  precision like 99.9% see that's predicting the future because it's got
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:43.600]  so many trillions of nodes to what you're searching what you're thinking what
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:48.840]  you're doing what you're choosing that it's a trillion light years ahead of
[02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:52.200]  cookies and so you bought one jacket so for years it advertises certain
[02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:57.200]  jackets to you with this then they can add input to the web to then control
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:01.400]  once they know what your MO is they can then manipulate you and then pretty
[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:06.560]  soon you can control the future so it's not just about knowing the future it's
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:12.080]  creating the future and that's why DARPA with IBM and Microsoft because they
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:15.240]  want to get around the trust laws and don't like the public knowing secretly
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:20.360]  started Google what is it 15 years ago and it came from nowhere to take over
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:24.840]  the world it's tied into Apple and the rest of it and I do the research every
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:28.520]  day but Nico came here and it's an article from a couple days ago the three
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:34.200]  breakthroughs that have finally unleashed AI on the world now I mean how many years
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:38.200]  ago did I tell you that that Google was a crystal ball
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:45.000]  Palantir over the horizon future predicting control system and how do I
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:48.080]  know this because I read so many globalist white papers about what they
[02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:54.640]  wanted in the 60s okay and here's the bad news it's working okay we're obsolete
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:58.040]  that's why they're teaching us we're not needed we better say we want a future
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:03.320]  for humans it's been decided we're done there won't be any interstellar going
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:07.800]  through black holes to find new planets okay you understand this this is the big
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:16.920]  issue here it is on page three and it's Larry Page who became a CEO and he goes
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:21.280]  in he's talking to Google with all these top scientists and you can read the
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:25.240]  quotes here and they said listen what's the point of a searches is already a
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:29.360]  bunch of me said no we have basically the NSA algorithms that's what it is as an
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:33.120]  NSA keyword search system we're going to build an AI system that takes over the
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:38.360]  planet see they're humans that want to build Skynet and merge with it and live
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:41.880]  forever that's why at the end of the new Terminator which was produced by
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:45.040]  Bilderberg folks that's why I knew about before it came out through Daniel
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:50.960]  Esslin sources they that's why the movie they find out it's a scientist that
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:56.440]  built the computer that merged with it and Skynet is a woman do you understand
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:00.960]  they're telling you everything they're going to do and whether they can do this
[02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:07.760]  or not looks like they can here's the problem they want us dead you understand
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:10.560]  these are better Steve I'm ranting we're gonna go to break come back and I promise
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:14.360]  go to the cause it's a long segment Dave Bob Jason Ray Leo we'll get to all of
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:20.160]  you but we got three minutes till break here they are saying we built an AI to
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:23.320]  run the world and they've done it and now they know what you're gonna order
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:27.760]  before you order it there's a pullout people trust the NSA more than they
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:34.360]  trust Google it's the same thing people need to understand this Steve Cuell the
[02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:38.400]  bottom line is how you just described Google how you've just described their
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:45.960]  ultimate goal is the absolute should be the absolute controlling spot in people's
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:51.520]  response against it Alex I everything you just said I wrote a you know 380
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:56.440]  book page book on it but here's the thing I'm trying to make it so easy for
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:28:01.920]  everyone that it encapsulates where we're going what they want they're telling
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:05.160]  us what they want they've said what they're gonna do and so I'm just telling
[02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:10.440]  people this point blank if you don't understand everything that that is out
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:14.640]  there coming at you this is the bottom line you are no longer needed that's why
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:18.600]  the middle class has been destroyed that's why you don't have a hope for a
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:23.040]  future and that's what we're trying to bring about and people matter and I say
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:28.240]  this for the machines people matter that's it we've got a we've got to
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:33.480]  understand the system wants to bring us down we have to get people to get their
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:39.640]  life force back get their capacity to understand that they've got to decide
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:42.120]  whether they want to live or not and they've got to understand their destiny
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:45.520]  has been taken from them and that it's not a bunch of work to do this it is
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:50.520]  empowering Steve what is it like is it not invigorating and opens up so many
[02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:55.400]  understandings when you face this it's not enslaving it's empowering it is
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:29:01.400]  tiring though to actually face reality because your your intelligence expands
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:05.640]  so much and this is what they're scared of and that's why you said you know if
[02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:09.000]  you're buying him as we're buying you then we'll know the truth and truth will
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:13.200]  set us free unfortunately Alex they want to keep everybody in a mental prison
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:17.880]  henceforth kudos to prison planet and by giving them lies deceptions feeding them

[02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:31.600]  been able to not only emasculate the American male but they've also been
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:36.760]  able to basically lobotomize them with entertainment if everybody looks at

[02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:29.480]  fronts as they grow the wireless control mesh as the technological grid like
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:33.880]  tentacles comes out so we just start building new innovations around it we
[02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:37.560]  start educating people about it we start doing a little steps and then those
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:41.280]  turn into big steps to deal with it Steve quail is our guest we're going right
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:45.240]  back to him and straight to your calls briefly if you go to drudge report
[02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:52.440]  com you can see our article up there in the top left hand corner fed scramble
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:56.640]  for hazmat suits buying more than a million and then we basically from that
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:00.640]  article got the intel from one of the big three won't say it's FedEx won't say
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:07.200]  it's DHL won't say it's a UPS but we have the documents exclusive US
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:12.760]  government orders 25 250,000 quarter million hazmat suits to be sent to Dallas
[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:17.720]  and the president says oh get ready for some more cases clearly covering up
[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:21.000]  until after the election that's what my gut told me looks like that's where
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.880]  we're going and a lot of top people have said this is really an Ebola
[02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:28.360]  simulant it's not really Ebola so they can control it and it's meant to roll
[02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:33.000]  out the vaccine that's what dr. Francis Boyle who wrote the US biological
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:40.400]  weapons law and terrorism law and the UN treaty adopted at the UN said and he
[02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:44.080]  said it's hiding in plain view in the New York Times that they already have the
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:47.480]  vaccine for mutagens that just popped up in the last six months that's
[02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:52.040]  impossible no one could imagine what it would have merged with or done that's
[02:35:52.040 --> 02:35:56.960]  how stupid they think we are it's a smart meter and two plus two equals five and
[02:35:56.960 --> 02:36:01.860]  the Patriot acts patriotic no it's not headline out of the Washington Post
[02:36:01.860 --> 02:36:06.800]  that they're laughing at us surprise controversial Patriot act powered now
[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:11.440]  overwhelmingly used in drug investigations no warrants no due process
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:18.400]  breaking your house sneaking peaks plant stuff on you wasn't for terrorism and
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:25.480]  the DEA uses the NSA to set people up and we're gonna bring Joe Biggs as he
[02:36:25.480 --> 02:36:27.920]  can get seated to talk to Steve Quill here in a moment but Steve I wanted you
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:31.400]  to finish your point you're trying to get to at the break of Steve Quill dot
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:37.520]  com well first of all Alex you know they have had over I don't know a couple
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:41.840]  hundred dead scientists is relevant to what you're asking me the I think it was
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:48.120]  number 54 57 on my list it was a gentleman that found a universal antidote
[02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:56.280]  for all viruses a universal it was an amazing feat he was murdered rather than
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:37:03.360]  bring that to the same thing look this is what's going on all of these events
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:06.960]  that are you've got to listen to us we know what's best for you I have a simple
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:09.880]  statement to ask everyone is listening and we'll listen to this program re
[02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:16.240]  broadcast if they've never told you the truth at all what makes you think they
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:20.760]  ever will that sounds like a pretty simplistic thing does that Alex if you
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:26.720]  have listened to them and nothing they say this with what you see wouldn't you
[02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:32.520]  be better off relying on your own common sense so given what we're
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:36.800]  watching right now Alex this is a perfect setup for the implementation of
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:41.520]  there you know not only agenda 21 that's that's a given but this is how do I
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:46.760]  say this there's no longer a future that we're gonna say well another year
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:50.680]  another two years another three years no they're going for the home run right
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:55.640]  now that's why all the they are ramping up and the ramping up of the rhetoric and
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:37:59.040]  all of the new laws are in the books listen if anybody thinks there's a
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:03.240]  constitutional republic left in functionality they're wrong there is
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:07.200]  one it's a back bone of our country but unfortunately in this should all law
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:10.440]  enforcement out there listening if you're a constitutional law enforcement
[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:15.320]  officer you also your family's habits already programmed in and Alex I've been
[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:20.040]  pleading with law enforcement loyal constitutional American law enforcement
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:27.400]  for 23 years on you know not being the victims of what they think they're going
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:32.720]  to be told that they be contempt for those individuals is so great that as a
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:37.200]  border patrolman told me who's quit now is ahead of the border patrol itself he
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:41.440]  said Steve they know our phone numbers they know our bank account numbers they
[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:44.760]  know everything we just saw that you know we just saw that in the papers what
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:49.240]  other gangs in your part of the country so the point thing they have it all so
[02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:51.720]  that's right the criminals in the government are working with the
[02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:56.200]  organized crime and cops aren't stupid on average they know how corrupt the
[02:38:56.200 --> 02:38:59.160]  system is do they really think they're being trained the number one enemy is
[02:38:59.160 --> 02:39:02.480]  returning veterans well who else are they gonna like people that are trained
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:06.960]  to fight it's the police who are mainly veterans because it's the end of man it's
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:11.320]  the end of our age it's the rise of the machines in the words of the globalist
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:14.280]  they preconditioned this with movies like Terminator people think it's
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:20.280]  entertainment it's the real plan but humanity has to rally and has to fight
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:23.640]  I want to go to phone calls in Joe Biggs has some breaking news here with us
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:27.320]  reporter Joe Beggs Dave in Florida you're on the year with Steve Quayle go
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:29.520]  ahead
[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:36.840]  yeah do me a favor talk right into your phone my lord says fear not because
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:44.920]  these things must come to pass and it happens in his word God's word has
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:52.400]  spoken that we will not be destroyed by this evil it will be destroyed by God
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:56.560]  I appreciate your call I want to get I want to get Steve's take on that here's
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:40:01.520]  the deal you can interpret the Bible 55,000 different ways I've read the
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:06.480]  Bible and I know it's real the point is is that everybody thinks there's a
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:10.360]  rapture before all this happens did that ever happen to Christians before or
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:14.800]  prophets or Christ or anybody no I mean did George Washington just win
[02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:18.480]  everything as he was a Christian he had to fight and so what I'm getting at here
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:22.280]  is the churches are mainly government-run so they're just saying
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:25.720]  everything's fine we're gonna get teleported out here by Scotty on a golden
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:31.040]  rope or a stairway to heaven up there without having to go through this when
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:35.200]  the UN admits this year Christians are being attacked number one persecuted
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:38.680]  group worldwide and our government's helping do it I appreciate your call
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:41.480]  serve your phone was distorted that's why I'd let you go quick I'm gonna get to
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:44.440]  all these calls Steve Quill your take on what he just said well first of all
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:48.680]  that's that's idealistic it's not even realistic and I would encourage the man
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:52.880]  to read his Bible Jesus said if the days weren't shortened there'd be no flesh
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:57.200]  left alive yet for the elect state God's gonna intervene and Alex I believe
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:41:03.040]  that as more people rise up stand up that we have a we have a damn like
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:07.600]  ability to hold God has intervened for me against every enemy and it humbles me
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:12.640]  just constantly I can't if I told people all the stuff it's beyond a movie just
[02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:17.440]  constant and I just fear for those that try to do bad stuff to me because every
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:21.960]  time praise God they get torn to pieces without me doing a thing right and look
[02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:26.040]  let's look at all the Syrian Christians I mean and this this administration I
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:29.600]  don't know if you've heard me say this but I do know longer I will not call the
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:32.960]  White House the White House it's a slaughterhouse not one word has been
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:37.600]  spoken out against the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Christians be
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:42.160]  headed disemboweled chopped up little babies babies with their heads ripped
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:46.000]  off by the foot of someone on it and yet there's silence so I say to all those
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:51.160]  people you're the ones with fear don't say that we're putting fear on you we're
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:56.720]  defining it Jesus himself said that if if you know if he didn't shorten the
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:01.160]  days that there'd be no flesh left alive that's how evil it is well we do it
[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:04.280]  Christ did and be Christ like and go out and get in the face of these money
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:08.400]  changers get in the face of the system and rebuke it and I and I don't think
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:12.360]  that caller was so much mad at us but I did hear it it's like God's coming God
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:15.640]  will take care of it it's a scaring me you know I'm not here telling you this is
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:19.640]  scary I believe you're men and you're women and we can organize and stand
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:24.040]  against this for our very souls ladies and gentlemen let's let's move quickly

[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:55.080]  Steve hey Steve I think we're beyond the book of revelation currently because I
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:58.040]  think over one-third of the wars have destroyed between the BPL still the
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:03.000]  Fukushima Daiichi incident what do you think thanks Nicole well first of all I
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.880]  believe Fukushima was an intentional act just as the whole thing with the BP
[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:11.640]  death of the Gulf we're not beyond the book of revelation the book of a
[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:14.560]  revelation is playing out right before our eyes a third of the life in the sea
[02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:19.680]  is dying and the fact that every knowing law of physics and every warning
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:24.520]  associated with physics buildings Montana at the highest radio activity
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:30.400]  rating twice what should normally be people would be evacuated but yet there
[02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:34.480]  is a complete blackout it's a lie and knowledge is exponentially increasing but
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:39.000]  ignorance is accelerating yep knowledge knowledge everywhere but not a drop to
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:45.760]  drink thank you so much yeah let's go to who's up first here GCN who should I go

[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:53.800]  I just want to call it encourage you guys encourage your listeners to
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:45:00.040]  understand the odds of us being a Steve or an Alex are zero we can be informed
[02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:05.040]  involved don't get tired of doing good constantly keep teaching people around
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:10.800]  you be the influence be the light that you can be in your society everybody has
[02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:15.400]  a sphere of influence now if you want to be that single domino and just be out
[02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:18.880]  there by yourself you're not gonna be able to touch anybody but you put that
[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:23.560]  domino next to a row of a billion dominoes and you tip it then you treat
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:28.920]  more people and more people and that's the way we win the battle absolutely and
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:33.000]  we stop it by infighting they want us infighting on race and all this other
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:36.960]  stuff we have to come together on valuing human life human dignity and
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:41.080]  valuing that you know the God's gifts that we were given not always just
[02:45:41.080 --> 02:45:45.640]  putting humanity down by these globalist who fly around in luxury jet
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:49.600]  airplanes you know that the Google executives and people with up to like
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:53.400]  20 hookers and then they think they're gonna merge with machines and become God
[02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:57.120]  and not bashing them for liking women the whole point is they're humans like
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:46:00.880]  us but there's under such evil influence that they really believe at
[02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:05.080]  Microsoft and everywhere that's really evil that they're going to take over and
[02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:09.680]  it's just not going to happen we already know their plan so even though
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:12.680]  they're gonna get a lot of it done they're going to be destroyed and
[02:46:12.680 --> 02:46:19.080]  everyone in their gut who has discernment knows this AI beast is going to
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:26.200]  turn on them there is no way these people are morons you know I I just
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:30.480]  wonder after listening to Captain Crunch and all the people along the way with
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:35.920]  Steve Jobs and that other Jack Jack Lake over at Microsoft and all the man
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:39.880]  side over where they get to the point where they sell their souls I just
[02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:45.360]  don't see that I love humanity I want everybody I'm so sick and tired my my
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:49.200]  ancestors came from from Ireland we never owned a slave one I mean I can go
[02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:53.360]  back 400 years we never owned a slave I'm tired of them shoving the gay thing
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:57.160]  down my throat saying I'm a homophobic I'm tired of them saying what a racist
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:03.720]  I'm not a racist my UPS guys I get all I get all that it's about making you feel
[02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:06.560]  like you're bad while they're killing everybody God bless you Steve Quayle
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:11.200]  comments well first of all it's a transfer of evil woe unto those who call
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:15.200]  evil good and good evil they've turned the world upside down and everything
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:19.160]  that's evil in their eyes is right everything that's right in God's eyes is
[02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:24.400]  wrong and again the one who comes to kill to destroy and to steal is Lucifer
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:28.040]  they already have sold their souls by the way and they don't you don't get to
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:32.640]  be where those guys are unless you basically make a pact with Lucifer and
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:36.840]  it requires blood sacrifice and Alex that's the thing that people miss a lot
[02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:41.080]  of times you know the Satanism Oklahoma City the first place of beheading took
[02:47:41.080 --> 02:47:45.280]  place Oklahoma City now there's more beheadings happening yep and now and
[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:49.960]  that the thing is is that I posted on my website a three minute video by a guy
[02:47:49.960 --> 02:47:54.480]  on Halloween and he said you may get into all this Halloween stuff personally I
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:59.600]  find it the most abominable our date in the world but he said wait until the
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:04.720]  heads on the pike are in your country and that's the thing this this absolute
[02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:09.000]  filling the airwaves and the videos and YouTube's and with all this court it's
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:15.240]  desensitizing so when they bring it here you will not act up or rise up against
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:19.200]  it and because we have not acted up rise up and stood with the Christian
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:22.360]  brethren being slaughtered I'm talking about the mega churches and all the
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:30.200]  26,000 churches on the clergy response teams shame on them shame on them now I'm
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:33.400]  going to skip this network break so we have more time to go to Joe Biggs is
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:36.840]  whether some are going to go to Leo Stacy Dave Abbey and others that are
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:42.120]  patiently holding Joe Biggs goes out and does man on the streets every week
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:47.600]  here in Austin Texas down at the University of Texas and other areas
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:52.680]  and we saw an article yesterday trending more college students support
[02:48:52.680 --> 02:48:57.360]  post-birth abortions and then that harken back to articles in the Journal of
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:00.880]  Medical Ethics saying that it was very moral if you wanted to to kill your
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:04.440]  child up to age three even they didn't have a problem it's it's or the state
[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:07.920]  wants to kill and then you know it's kind of moral now to just put troops on
[02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:11.920]  death lists and not give them care and when you go out and talk to Trendy's if
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:16.400]  you say for the state or for Obama we want to kill the babies or kill small
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:21.480]  children they say of course it'll give me something more they believe in this
[02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:28.120]  predatory cannibalistic mindset and 13 out of 30 people then some of the others
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:33.320]  were on the fence so it's about half about half the people he talked to said
[02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:37.720]  yes let's have post-birth abortions which is in fantasies it's an oxymoron
[02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:42.280]  but that's how they're selling it and so you know prove I mean this is a liberal
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:45.520]  thing I mean you know we need to kill children up to age five because now
[02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:50.600]  they're saying age five and it's the new super trendy thing so Joe Biggs we
[02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:54.480]  haven't seen the video yet it'll be on the Natalie News tonight or we get
[02:49:54.480 --> 02:49:59.600]  behind it'll be premiered on the radio slash TV tomorrow but we thought UT
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:03.600]  students were done when they wanted to bring Ebola patients to their homes
[02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:07.680]  because we said for Obama and they said yes it's very racist we should bring
[02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:10.960]  them to our homes of course they won't really do that they want you to take them
[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:15.880]  in your home statistically you know it shows these so-called progressives are
[02:50:15.880 --> 02:50:19.480]  six times more likely to steal in major studies they lie they claim they're
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:22.720]  charitable they're not as libertarians and conservatives are charitable we
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:26.200]  just want to control how we're charitable to real charities tell us what
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:30.080]  you found Joe Biggs and I want to get the take here from Steve Cuell I want to
[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:33.320]  tell you right now Alex a little piece inside of me died today with us I mean
[02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:41.400]  it it broke my heart to see it the first person I talked to was willing to sign
[02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:45.440]  it they read it completely word for word please support the post birth
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:49.580]  abortion act of 2014 this is to emphasize that the moral status of the
[02:50:49.580 --> 02:50:53.000]  newborn baby killed is comparable but that of a fetus rather than that of a
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:57.400]  child therefore we claim killing a newborn could be ethically permissible in
[02:50:57.400 --> 02:51:02.880]  all the circumstances where abortion would be and they read it and I looked
[02:51:02.880 --> 02:51:06.400]  them in the eyes and I watched them read it and they signed these people are
[02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:11.440]  demon creatures and one right down here Danielle I won't say the rest of her name
[02:51:11.440 --> 02:51:17.600]  wants to be a future politician she is that is her goal to be a politician
[02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:21.600]  another nurse and the thing is there some of them are well-spoken they go yes
[02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:24.720]  it's very racist we don't bring the Ebola patients here or yes we need to kill
[02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:31.120]  babies my stomach was churning the entire time it took every ounce we'll see
[02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:34.720]  me to hold it back when I heard that half of them did it I said have big
[02:51:34.720 --> 02:51:37.480]  keep asking questions and then you and then get mad at them I knew you'd want
[02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:41.280]  to I said you've got permission so if you want to go back out next week have
[02:51:41.280 --> 02:51:45.080]  more of them do this and then just care into them say what is your problem how
[02:51:45.080 --> 02:51:48.760]  would you like to die well some of the ones who refuse a sign as they walked
[02:51:48.760 --> 02:51:52.800]  away I was like thank you thank you for proving that there's some humanity left
[02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:58.440]  out there that anybody getting mad at you I had one person this girl I don't
[02:51:58.440 --> 02:52:03.960]  know yeah she didn't sign it but she walked away and was so upset she started
[02:52:03.960 --> 02:52:07.120]  crying she has a soul and people started walking up and she was screaming as
[02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:10.760]  tears are coming out of her eyes don't sign that petition don't sign that
[02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:14.280]  petition and I had to stop what I was doing a while she doesn't want to kill
[02:52:14.280 --> 02:52:17.800]  children what a weirdo she has a survival instinct she has a tribal
[02:52:17.800 --> 02:52:21.920]  survival mode she was she probably wants our progeny to have space bases and
[02:52:21.920 --> 02:52:26.520]  and control their destiny she probably wants us to win and not be destroyed by
[02:52:26.520 --> 02:52:30.960]  Google and Microsoft how dare her she's out there for ten minutes like it makes
[02:52:30.960 --> 02:52:34.400]  me want to tear up like please don't sign that please don't did you get an
[02:52:34.400 --> 02:52:37.600]  interview with her explain to her it was I talked to her afterwards we have that
[02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:40.440]  on camera but I mean she's like please don't that's all another type yeah she's
[02:52:40.440 --> 02:52:43.280]  please don't tell me you support this whatsoever and I was like no no no I was
[02:52:43.280 --> 02:52:46.320]  like but there's a trend going around in these major campuses well they're
[02:52:46.320 --> 02:52:50.720]  teaching it at Princeton and Harvard and well you know that they got death list
[02:52:50.720 --> 02:52:54.440]  for veterans man yeah they won't even give them heart surgery if they're 50
[02:52:54.440 --> 02:52:58.480]  years old and up to five years old they say because up until a child is five
[02:52:58.480 --> 02:53:02.400]  years old they're not self-aware they go well how far can you remember back your
[02:53:02.400 --> 02:53:05.840]  first memory most people say five and then now notice they're arguing that
[02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:10.200]  we're not conscious anyways and are just robots by stimuli that it's that it's
[02:53:10.200 --> 02:53:13.800]  all nature not nurture see they always tell us we don't have a soul while they
[02:53:13.800 --> 02:53:17.840]  quest for immortality they know we got a soul they're soul suckers and the way to
[02:53:17.840 --> 02:53:22.400]  suck our soul is to get us to believe we don't have one I had one guy when I told
[02:53:22.400 --> 02:53:26.120]  him I said hey do you want to help empower women give women the right to
[02:53:26.120 --> 02:53:30.680]  have abortions post post birth he goes whoa that just sounds crazy I don't know
[02:53:30.680 --> 02:53:33.560]  if I could do that I was like well at least read it then he reads it and
[02:53:33.560 --> 02:53:40.320]  signs it you know well what do you make of this
[02:53:40.320 --> 02:53:45.160]  rather than life and let's let's do another survey you know have Joe ground
[02:53:45.160 --> 02:53:49.920]  say do you believe that since so many college students are graduating without a
[02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:55.440]  job that we should have a euthanasia bill to basically take away if the
[02:53:55.440 --> 02:54:00.040]  college students are looking oh yeah ask that next yes and in order to make
[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:03.960]  way for those who are still in college that then we'll have the opportunity to
[02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:07.440]  have a sign it I'll sign it well I was saying about having to and having this
[02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:11.040]  one and if they refuse to sign this be like do would you support or will you
[02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:14.920]  sign this saying that you would kill the people who are willing to sign somebody
[02:54:14.920 --> 02:54:18.640]  it's just it's ridiculous but Steve's idea is great I bet I bet half of them
[02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:23.520]  just usually half will shine to kill to kill 55 year olds to get their job you
[02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:29.360]  gotta think of this it took me 45 minutes 45 minutes that's it to get 30
[02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:33.920]  signatures to get to get the half of 30 30 people and get half that's two
[02:54:33.920 --> 02:54:40.040]  minutes a piece yeah that is that's mind-blowing I mean I literally I it took
[02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:43.600]  so much I was bouncing up and down trying to be positive and all I wanted to do is
[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:47.640]  just scream because I couldn't believe the first person who walked up to me
[02:54:47.640 --> 02:54:52.600]  signed incredible let's go back to some calls we're doing five minutes overdraft
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:57.760]  to it's Steve quail Steve quail calm I'm Alex Jones then fall wars calm Leo in
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:55:02.760]  MA you're on the air go ahead hi it's actually taking call last time I spoke
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:07.120]  to you if you remember I referred to the Hydra that is out there so we can't
[02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:14.880]  blame any one specific organization anyway I'm really up for an Oscar type
[02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:20.640]  award ceremony for us I'd like to call it the King George third awards and we
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:25.560]  should have also have a gogability test that could go viral and where you
[02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:31.680]  wouldn't when you win the gogability test you lose I was learned something a
[02:55:31.680 --> 02:55:36.960]  long time back and from this professor Jerome Letwin at MIT and he said that
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:42.400]  they came into church and said that the the reason the jackboots aren't on the
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:46.080]  street is because that would be counter productive for them so that's why they're
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:51.000]  going to keep down the amount of actual troops on the street because you have a
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:56.000]  question for Steve quail we're almost out of time yeah how do we create a
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:01.440]  roadmap for us so that we can find the relative things we can do within our
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:05.960]  economic structure we should write roadmaps and have other people write
[02:56:05.960 --> 02:56:09.440]  roadmaps and debate the roadmaps and think about different plans and work
[02:56:09.440 --> 02:56:13.640]  off things that have worked against the globalist I agree Steve quail thank you
[02:56:13.640 --> 02:56:18.640]  Colin well I mean it's all laid out there the bottom line is when people
[02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:22.800]  start reading the documents that you probably mean just a simple question to
[02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:27.080]  people are you aware that one of the leading think tanks in America is saying
[02:56:27.080 --> 02:56:32.920]  that by 2025 that 80% of the population will no longer exist have you thought
[02:56:32.920 --> 02:56:36.960]  about how they're going to kill that many people make it simple I'll tell you
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:41.480]  what most people want someone else to do a farm not saying this guy is but what
[02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:46.480]  everyone has to do is each man has to man up and they have to stand up and they
[02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:51.200]  have to start absolutely they need a roadmap my roadmap is the Bible God
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:55.080]  loves the world he doesn't hate it these people are the world haters they
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:56:59.440]  absolutely hate the world they eat everything that's good they eat beauty
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:04.040]  what's more beautiful than a child you know what these people have a covenant
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:07.520]  that I'm telling you they're plugged in the board and by the way even Hydra
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:11.960]  have a central processing even though they have individual cells even the
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:16.880]  Hydra has if you will board central that's right and it's a spirit that
[02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:20.040]  animates it we're gonna go to break new five minutes of Steve quail take a few

[03:00:22.520 --> 03:00:28.400]  you are the resistance I'm not bragging but Oxford Cambridge have asked me to
[03:00:28.400 --> 03:00:32.480]  come speak to their main chambers having that time or energy to go and I was
[03:00:32.480 --> 03:00:36.320]  invited to meet with some super high-level people repeatedly I mean at
[03:00:36.320 --> 03:00:40.400]  the so the globalists are aware of this show they know what's going on and a lot
[03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:43.640]  of people even within the system and aren't the very highest room don't like
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:48.160]  it they're just scared and don't know what to do Steve I think of all the
[03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:51.680]  books you've written your Xeno Genesis is the most important to show this
[03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:55.920]  devilish attempt at a false creation that's so destructive I think everybody
[03:00:55.920 --> 03:01:00.160]  should read that book available at Stevequell.com right now let's go to
[03:01:00.160 --> 03:01:07.040]  Abbey in Minnesota thanks for holding pardon me you guys just yeah you guys
[03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:11.280]  got distorted audio just so you know thank you RB in Minnesota not Abbey sorry
[03:01:11.280 --> 03:01:19.040]  RB go ahead yeah hi Alex I just like to say that right now the the median IQ of
[03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:25.240]  the average American the 50th percentile is currently a hundred the elite the
[03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:31.920]  globalists have IQs of at least 115 typically around 125 plus the ongoing
[03:01:31.920 --> 03:01:36.680]  plan is to of course dumb us down even further because they know that once our
[03:01:36.680 --> 03:01:42.800]  IQ gets below you know say like 90 once it's down to like 85 there's no way that
[03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:49.160]  they can be overthrown and the combination of high IQ in psychopathy is
[03:01:49.160 --> 03:01:55.160]  absolutely treacherous I read a Forbes article and it said that psychopaths are
[03:01:55.160 --> 03:02:01.000]  actually disproportionately represented amongst the globalist that's well known
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:06.000]  that's well known in intelligence agencies corporations everywhere yes yes
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:11.760]  and I'll just say like I remember when I was young I'd see these these little
[03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:16.920]  kids and they might be you know pulling off the legs of frogs and spiders and I
[03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:20.520]  just slowly back away and say hey I don't want to have anything to do with you
[03:02:20.520 --> 03:02:24.440]  and a couple of these people are now in politics these are the people who are
[03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:28.560]  running things these people who are torching animals probably stringing up
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:32.760]  cats by the legs and cutting out their their end trials you know just for fun
[03:02:32.760 --> 03:02:38.280]  just laughing it just you're a powerful caller sir you're absolutely right that
[03:02:38.280 --> 03:02:42.960]  we should do whole shows about psychopaths are thought to be genetic
[03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:46.320]  but they're actually on the rise like the system is creating them artificially
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:51.120]  Steve Coyle you're comment on what he just said I agree and I would say this a
[03:02:51.120 --> 03:02:56.160]  great source of creating that Alex along with other social disorders are the
[03:02:56.160 --> 03:03:00.120]  video games and you know for the first time in history a half a billion dollars
[03:03:00.120 --> 03:03:06.160]  was spent and I'm not a gamer so I don't know my plan but look we really do
[03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:10.600]  embrace death we have the choice we can embrace Lucifer and death or we can
[03:03:10.600 --> 03:03:16.000]  pray I embrace Jesus in eternal life and the principles of Jesus is amazing the
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:20.720]  time he got the most angry was with the bankers in the temple and unfortunately
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:24.400]  people who are going to dead churches with what I call pukes in the pulpit a
[03:03:24.400 --> 03:03:28.880]  puke in the pulpit is someone who's so lukewarm the book of revelations says
[03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:33.120]  that God spews them out of his mouth this is critical people have to be
[03:03:33.120 --> 03:03:37.280]  grounded and that's why when people say what keeps me from going up same thing
[03:03:37.280 --> 03:03:40.960]  it keeps you from going up what keeps me from going up is the mercy of the
[03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:45.520]  living God in my life and the compassion and the passion to not let these
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:51.360]  murderers demons from hell and their fallen angel handlers get away with
[03:03:51.360 --> 03:03:56.720]  genocide and that's what propels me God loves the world Jesus died for it and
[03:03:56.720 --> 03:04:01.840]  also Alex the bottom line is that everything that people are seeing now
[03:04:01.840 --> 03:04:06.080]  if what they admit to you know this Google and every one of the high-tech
[03:04:06.080 --> 03:04:10.080]  firms was ultimately set up funded by the intelligence agencies they want
[03:04:10.080 --> 03:04:14.360]  total control they are the Borg that's right it is the Hydra because all these
[03:04:14.360 --> 03:04:17.520]  agencies are the same group and just all goes back to the central system I'm
[03:04:17.520 --> 03:04:21.040]  sorry to the other callers a Dave and Dave and Stacy and Dan love to have

[03:04:38.200 --> 03:04:44.200]  rabbit hole my analysis is it's spiritual it is and the enemy knows that too
