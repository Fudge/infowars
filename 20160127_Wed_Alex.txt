[00:00.000 --> 00:13.620]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.620 --> 00:20.760]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:34.000]  well I've got to be honest with folks we broken another record here we seem to be
[00:34.000 --> 00:41.000]  doing it every week there's never been this much insane over-the-top news you've
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.840]  got the Oregon situation with one dad another wounded the media lying and
[00:45.840 --> 00:51.400]  saying it was a shootout last night and today then admitting it wasn't you've
[00:51.400 --> 00:56.680]  got huge global developments with top generals and world leaders saying we're
[00:56.680 --> 01:01.160]  the closest to nuclear war we've ever been with the doomsday clock with top
[01:01.160 --> 01:05.720]  experts and scientists conferring saying it's the most dangerous it's ever
[01:05.720 --> 01:12.120]  been we've got devastating attacks on free speech in the Western world we have
[01:12.120 --> 01:16.080]  got unbelievable rollouts of paramilitary force against the American
[01:16.080 --> 01:19.880]  people we have the lowest approval rating ever for Congress and government
[01:19.880 --> 01:24.680]  in general we have all sorts of new bizarre diseases popping up that appear
[01:24.680 --> 01:30.680]  to be weaponized we've got proxy wars heating up we have got just just
[01:30.680 --> 01:38.200]  unbelievable information to cover today you've got Bernie Sanders being invited
[01:38.200 --> 01:42.680]  by Obama to the White House showing that they may actually go with him instead
[01:42.680 --> 01:46.040]  of bringing Biden in to bring down Hillary and that the indictment of
[01:46.040 --> 01:52.160]  Hillary could be imminent Tom delay the former Republican whip who's been
[01:52.160 --> 01:56.080]  through the ringer and falsely charged with a bunch of garbage obviously
[01:56.080 --> 01:59.600]  defeated it I'm not saying he was a good guy he was just falsely charged with
[01:59.600 --> 02:02.960]  stuff he wasn't going along with the agenda he says she is going to be
[02:02.960 --> 02:06.720]  indicted or the FBI is going to go public and he wouldn't say that if that
[02:06.720 --> 02:12.400]  wasn't the case all hell is about to break loose because the Clintons will
[02:12.400 --> 02:17.120]  run a false flag or they will pull out all the stops I mean they will they will
[02:17.120 --> 02:22.520]  not go quietly and so the fact that they're being moved towards the airlock
[02:22.520 --> 02:27.200]  and about to be thrown out into into space you know like like a lot like
[02:27.200 --> 02:35.960]  Socorny Weaver does to the alien this is hardcore this is circus Maximus and I'll
[02:35.960 --> 02:39.440]  be honest with you this has never happened to me I woke up this morning and
[02:39.440 --> 02:44.040]  my jaw is locked I can't even put my back teeth together that's how much I was
[02:44.040 --> 02:47.480]  clenching my teeth last night and my dreams worrying about all this I mean I
[02:47.480 --> 02:51.680]  go to sleep I just worry about this now all night long and then that's because
[02:51.680 --> 03:00.600]  my gut my gut not just intellectually knows we are in deep trouble and when
[03:00.600 --> 03:03.680]  you do admit we're in deep trouble to get out of the deep trouble and I want
[03:03.680 --> 03:07.760]  to say something to the feds and people I know that most of the people in the
[03:07.760 --> 03:11.400]  federal government that are in the muscle end of things are conservatives or
[03:11.400 --> 03:15.200]  libertarians and that your bosses are socialists and communists and drug
[03:15.200 --> 03:20.120]  dealers and scum I know that you were naive getting into it most of you are
[03:20.120 --> 03:24.040]  come from families and you're part of a white hat crew that used to be the
[03:24.040 --> 03:28.800]  majority that's now probably only about 45% I know they want to start a civil
[03:28.800 --> 03:33.480]  war that wipes you out and that wipes the Patriots out I've done everything I
[03:33.480 --> 03:39.040]  can to try to stop this and I'm telling the police that too I've told the
[03:39.040 --> 03:42.080]  militias and everybody don't act like idiots and don't let people manipulate
[03:42.080 --> 03:45.400]  you into stupid stuff and don't do stupid things and I'm going to tell the
[03:45.400 --> 03:51.280]  police and the military and the feds this isn't going to be a boss-hog take
[03:51.280 --> 03:57.280]  over they're going to destroy the country the globalists have got really bad
[03:57.280 --> 04:03.280]  stuff in store for everybody so even if you're a sociopath and I'm not saying
[04:03.280 --> 04:08.400]  you're all sociopaths or mercenaries I'm saying some of you are you really need
[04:08.400 --> 04:14.000]  to get a historical perspective and not be stupid Hitler's general staff in 1943
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.320]  and 44 tried to take him out not because they were angels and not because they
[04:19.320 --> 04:23.880]  didn't have blood on their hands many of them but because they knew where it was
[04:23.880 --> 04:28.640]  taking Germany and by 1943 there were only three or four million dead German
[04:28.640 --> 04:33.120]  troops that sounds like a lot it wasn't at the end it was 21 million Germans
[04:33.120 --> 04:39.680]  dead that was about 30% of the German population I'm telling you just like I
[04:39.680 --> 04:44.360]  said I have a bad feeling about the Bundy's yesterday yeah folks I'm psychic
[04:44.360 --> 04:48.780]  I mean it's a fact okay I mean I don't control it nobody can but I mean I knew
[04:48.780 --> 04:51.120]  something I just feel it I said something bad's about to happen you
[04:51.120 --> 04:55.520]  notice it did and I didn't have to have some contact tell me that I'm telling you
[04:55.520 --> 04:58.560]  we're all in deep trouble
[04:58.560 --> 05:03.320]  you hear a lot about the cashless society but Europeans aren't buying it according
[05:03.320 --> 05:07.840]  to the European Central Bank a record one trillion euros of banknotes were in
[05:07.840 --> 05:12.600]  circulation in 2015 almost double the value 10 years ago paper money in
[05:12.600 --> 05:19.200]  circulation rose six and a half percent last year the most since 2008 2008 people
[05:19.200 --> 05:22.200]  were worried about financial turbulence and crashing markets then with good
[05:22.200 --> 05:26.400]  reason and this year has begun with the worst two-week start on record for
[05:26.400 --> 05:31.320]  financial markets but in 2015 we now have negative interest rates on bank
[05:31.320 --> 05:35.720]  accounts and the risk of flat-out confiscation of accounts by government
[05:35.720 --> 05:44.320]  what they call haircuts and then there's privacy cashless no thanks negative
[05:44.320 --> 05:49.040]  interest rates risk of confiscation economic uncertainty I'll take it in
[05:49.040 --> 05:53.920]  cash paper notes may not be real money they sure beat negative interest and

[08:50.480 --> 08:57.760]  broadcasting worldwide we have the original Benghazi whistleblower who
[08:57.760 --> 09:04.880]  retired about six months after Benghazi he is of course a famous whistleblower
[09:04.880 --> 09:14.520]  from Iran Contra Robert Tosh Plumlee he was on the quote white hat side of the
[09:14.520 --> 09:18.560]  Central Intelligence Agency and famously flew weapons to Fidel Castro when he
[09:18.560 --> 09:24.560]  worked for Eisenhower so he's been in op covert operations since 1958 and he
[09:24.560 --> 09:29.960]  retired three years ago he blew the entire operation of Benghazi wide open
[09:29.960 --> 09:36.120]  more than anyone else and we received very serious death threats he received
[09:36.120 --> 09:40.040]  threats and the Justice Department came after him but then backed off he said
[09:40.040 --> 09:43.880]  fine go ahead and indict me he'll be joining us at the bottom the next hour
[09:43.880 --> 09:49.080]  with an update because the new 13 hours has come out and of course covers the
[09:49.080 --> 09:52.400]  stand down the rest of it but everything he talked about how she was
[09:52.400 --> 09:56.760]  using the export powers to secretly transfer weapons out of the State
[09:56.760 --> 10:01.520]  Department to different Third World dictators that were paying her off that
[10:01.520 --> 10:04.960]  was first here by the way we're not bragging that's like sticking your
[10:04.960 --> 10:10.640]  head the lion's mouth it's a dangerous trick and again nobody else had the
[10:10.640 --> 10:14.240]  Cajunas to have him on we did it because we don't have you know it's not about
[10:14.240 --> 10:17.120]  being macho folks it's about doing our job here but I just want you to know
[10:17.120 --> 10:21.760]  this is a very serious broadcast we used to have some humor on the show and it's
[10:21.760 --> 10:26.080]  fun and I still want to do it I want to make fun of Bernie Sanders and stuff but
[10:26.080 --> 10:34.040]  at a certain point you know it just stops too hardcore he's popping in we're
[10:34.040 --> 10:37.600]  gonna look at how they plan to steal the election from Trump huge article on
[10:37.600 --> 10:43.760]  info wars.com with top Bilderberg group member at Davos actually says the
[10:43.760 --> 10:48.120]  super elites that's what they call themselves the super class that's what
[10:48.120 --> 10:51.320]  the Kissinger group calls them
[10:51.320 --> 10:56.320]  remember when the head of the Kissinger group told me right in front of John
[10:56.320 --> 11:01.760]  Harmon he said on the phone during a break he said look just join us Alex just
[11:01.760 --> 11:06.800]  join us you're part of the super class Harmon heard it and I started laughing up
[11:06.800 --> 11:10.480]  the guy and he said I'm just gonna get off here I thought if I was nice to you
[11:10.480 --> 11:15.200]  you'd and these people are just sick imagine how everybody else just oh you
[11:15.200 --> 11:19.440]  run trillions you you're being nice to me let me and get on my knees before you
[11:19.440 --> 11:23.560]  well they say they're going after Trump and that is the number one
[11:23.560 --> 11:30.440]  certification that he is good and they don't like it and even if he's not
[11:30.440 --> 11:33.880]  perfect they know that they don't run him and that he actually wants to run
[11:33.880 --> 11:39.240]  things and that scares the daylights out of them and they also obviously have
[11:39.240 --> 11:43.000]  Trump's phones tapped his email tapped everything else and I don't want to
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.880]  really give the media something to go into his he fits about but they already
[11:48.880 --> 11:52.480]  pretty much have we sort of tweeting on info wars links and saying he likes
[11:52.480 --> 11:56.440]  info wars and I'm a nice guy and stuff like that Trump's getting a crash course
[11:56.440 --> 12:03.280]  just like Vladimir Putin is from this show just the fact you see us influencing
[12:03.280 --> 12:08.120]  major TV shows you know drudge is a daily listener we have to admit that info
[12:08.120 --> 12:13.440]  wars has the ear of the intelligentsia and of the cultural elite and of the
[12:13.440 --> 12:18.360]  bad guys as well but they're coming after Trump because he's learning about the
[12:18.360 --> 12:22.320]  globalist of the New World Order and he's pretty freaked out about it quite
[12:22.320 --> 12:30.600]  frankly and they now know that's why they went after Rand Paul and said how dare
[12:30.600 --> 12:34.160]  you be an Alex Jones guy how dare you be part of you know and back when he was
[12:34.160 --> 12:37.000]  Alex is great yeah he's supposed to build a bird I love Alex then they
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.400]  convinced him to kind of distance himself and then his stock went down like
[12:41.400 --> 12:46.360]  rotten milk you know being thrown out and he's not rotten milk but just the
[12:46.360 --> 12:49.840]  fact that he tried to be a little bit establishment everybody ran from it
[12:49.840 --> 12:54.680]  Trump is smart enough to to know that being anti-establishment is the
[12:54.680 --> 13:01.760]  touchstone the zeitgeist and so waiting into the info war testing it up to his
[13:01.760 --> 13:09.640]  knees perhaps preparing to fully immerse himself in it has got them in fits I
[13:09.640 --> 13:12.920]  don't want to put ourselves at the center of this but we are a large part of
[13:12.920 --> 13:17.040]  it you are part of it as well but that's the inside baseball if you just want to
[13:17.040 --> 13:21.800]  know so Richard Reeves gonna take a special report that's gonna be on the
[13:21.800 --> 13:24.760]  nightly news tonight that I'm in there sections of it tomorrow with an expert on
[13:24.760 --> 13:28.120]  how they're trying to steal the delegate process the parliamentary systems are
[13:28.120 --> 13:30.560]  gonna try to do it and then they're in the news bragging about it that we're
[13:30.560 --> 13:36.680]  gonna get into the inside technicals of that now obviously there has been a
[13:36.680 --> 13:42.640]  tragedy in Oregon and there's a lot of angles to this and so I am going to
[13:42.640 --> 13:54.520]  calmly go over it here in just a few minutes it's very very sad some of the
[13:54.520 --> 14:01.480]  people involved in this are heroes they selflessly meant well but they were not
[14:01.480 --> 14:10.040]  sophisticated and walked into a trap and so if I was in the military and I was
[14:10.040 --> 14:19.400]  commanding some a group of scouts if I was a sergeant commanding a platoon and
[14:19.400 --> 14:23.040]  then my men wanted to go up a hill and attack an enemy I'd say no we're gonna
[14:23.040 --> 14:26.120]  wait till they come off the hill we're gonna go around behind them and get
[14:26.120 --> 14:29.080]  intel or we're gonna attack them in the middle of the night we're not gonna
[14:29.080 --> 14:34.760]  attack them in high noon and go up the hill if it wouldn't be I'm a traitor I
[14:34.760 --> 14:40.120]  want to work with the enemy I don't want to see the men shot up and and and
[14:40.120 --> 14:46.400]  defeated and and destroy it but so many times people that haven't been involved
[14:46.400 --> 14:51.840]  in politics haven't been involved in studying guerrilla warfare studying
[14:51.840 --> 14:57.200]  political operations any of it they just show up and just know all about it
[14:57.200 --> 15:01.880]  because they got 20 cows and four foster kids and you know they know how to do
[15:01.880 --> 15:07.280]  everything they write a novel about you know it's gonna take blood and a
[15:07.280 --> 15:12.840]  revolution to fix things that's exactly why the globalists are trying to
[15:12.840 --> 15:19.320]  provocateur a revolution because that's not what we need in this country until
[15:19.320 --> 15:24.040]  we've exhausted every peaceful means then if we've actually exhausted
[15:24.040 --> 15:29.880]  political means if you're willing to go and fight and die and be killed what
[15:29.880 --> 15:35.560]  are you gonna do first energy wise politically if you put energy into
[15:35.560 --> 15:41.040]  things with the same energy you'd use to go die our problems would be over very
[15:41.040 --> 15:46.400]  very quickly I have put the energy for 21 years of someone willing to die
[15:46.400 --> 15:52.760]  ready to die into an information war and I'm fully ready to be shut up fully
[15:52.760 --> 15:59.400]  ready to be put in prison fully ready to be killed but when it happens I'll do my
[15:59.400 --> 16:09.360]  best if it happens to have it be just like the archetype of the martyr lower
[16:09.360 --> 16:16.640]  my hands and let Darth Vader cut me right in half then I win then that death
[16:16.640 --> 16:23.000]  means something then that death is worth millions dying in a fight but you
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.640]  have to build the consciousness you have to build the system you have to build
[16:27.640 --> 16:34.160]  the personality you have to build the sacrifice and make the sacrifice great
[16:34.160 --> 16:42.280]  and make the sacrifice loved when it's destroyed as they try to assassinate my
[16:42.280 --> 16:48.440]  character as they try to kill my name it's already a martyr level event which
[16:48.440 --> 16:54.320]  humans admire at a deep primitive level we're in sophisticated information
[16:54.320 --> 17:00.000]  warfare with the enemy and do any of these rural groups and others ever
[17:00.000 --> 17:03.360]  listen to me yeah a lot of times they do but other times they send in the
[17:03.360 --> 17:09.320]  provocateurs the expert technicians just like Atari militia they did fake arrest
[17:09.320 --> 17:13.520]  of the feds and you know keep them for a few months they're really not even at
[17:13.520 --> 17:17.640]  the jail then let them out the back that's what we've got to watch with the
[17:17.640 --> 17:23.920]  people in jail right now very closely and ended up I told you to watch Atari you
[17:23.920 --> 17:30.000]  watch with this the Bundy's are not the operatives you can listen to them take
[17:30.000 --> 17:36.840]  one look at them we know where they came from they're good people but they
[17:36.840 --> 17:41.200]  wouldn't have been the George Washington's leading the fight they would
[17:41.200 --> 17:48.880]  have been the guys in the trenches they are not generals
[17:48.880 --> 17:54.600]  they're led around by their noses
[17:57.080 --> 18:01.560]  they feel it's right the feds are stealing property acting like thugs so
[18:01.560 --> 18:06.120]  they have a right to go and do what they did but they did it you know you know
[18:06.120 --> 18:11.440]  in a swamp when the enemies up on cliffs just hammering the daylight side of them
[18:11.440 --> 18:15.080]  walking into a complete trap I'm gonna skip this network break this is so
[18:15.080 --> 18:21.320]  important and it's very very sad
[18:23.760 --> 18:30.960]  it's very very painful to see this unfold and I'm gonna go over it at the
[18:30.960 --> 18:35.400]  bottom of the hour we'll put their mug shots up on screen for folks and I'm
[18:35.400 --> 18:39.840]  gonna have Joe Biggs come in as well and discuss this with me he can just come
[18:39.840 --> 18:44.520]  sit in here with me because he went there and covered it and I and I think we
[18:44.520 --> 18:47.640]  probably didn't you send David Knight or him out there now in the aftermath
[18:47.640 --> 18:52.400]  because we're gonna learn very quickly whether they're gonna be able to send in
[18:52.400 --> 18:57.480]  foundation operatives who will try to start a civil war over something like
[18:57.480 --> 19:02.560]  this versus factions of the feds that are clearly not trying to escalate this
[19:02.560 --> 19:07.240]  sheet there's different factions there's at least seven factions we know of in
[19:07.240 --> 19:12.480]  the CIA three major factions in the NSA different administrations come in and
[19:12.480 --> 19:17.040]  try to create new factions or take over other ones there's army versus CIA
[19:17.040 --> 19:25.200]  there's Navy versus army there's the Marine Corps standalone there's defense
[19:25.200 --> 19:29.560]  intelligence there's the big mega banks above it trying to control and
[19:29.560 --> 19:32.880]  manipulate it all then there's international factions it's not just
[19:32.880 --> 19:39.840]  let's go have a war with the feds let's have it start here like the Alamo
[19:39.840 --> 19:53.680]  you know that they planned with President Andrew Jackson in 19 in 1835 a year
[19:53.680 --> 19:59.640]  out what they did in Texas you know they sent Colonel Travis this is inside
[19:59.640 --> 20:04.200]  baseball but it's leaked out here and there but this is confirmed down to the
[20:04.200 --> 20:13.240]  Alamo to fight 10 to 1 odds to die to create a chain reaction to give birth
[20:13.240 --> 20:21.080]  to Texas because they were hardcore folks and they were Christians but they
[20:21.080 --> 20:30.720]  basically followed a Rosicrucian founding father basic cult deal where they
[20:30.720 --> 20:34.240]  they really wanted to found the new Atlantis they really wanted to build a
[20:34.240 --> 20:38.480]  new civilization based on human empowerment and they they they wanted
[20:38.480 --> 20:44.240]  to die in sacrifice against tyranny they don't really make people like that
[20:44.240 --> 20:49.640]  anymore much do they and they went and they basically planned it and they knew
[20:49.640 --> 20:54.000]  it and then Travis told the men you're all gonna die step across the line and
[20:54.000 --> 21:05.240]  join me in history and they stepped across just like the 300 they planned
[21:05.240 --> 21:09.720]  with Andrew Jackson an event similar to that they didn't know exactly how it
[21:09.720 --> 21:15.960]  would go down a year before and then they found Travis who'd already won some
[21:15.960 --> 21:24.680]  battles and was a born leader to lead it and he wrote on that letter to my
[21:24.680 --> 21:33.920]  family when he left his son with the airs family my mom's side and said take
[21:33.920 --> 21:39.120]  care of my little boy and then he wrote the other letter said I'm not giving up
[21:39.120 --> 21:44.840]  victory or death and and and they hoped to get reinforcements but they knew
[21:44.840 --> 21:48.800]  they weren't coming and they knew where they were going and they they knew that
[21:48.800 --> 21:53.160]  they were coming to draw Santa Ana into the south so they could get ready in the
[21:53.160 --> 22:01.800]  east with the armies with Sam Houston under the direct command of President
[22:01.800 --> 22:08.080]  Andrew Jackson in a covert action of the United States of America to take a third
[22:08.080 --> 22:13.960]  of Mexico that's how you plan things that's how you win that's how you kick
[22:13.960 --> 22:19.120]  the British Empire's butt that nobody could stop real planning real sacrifice
[22:19.120 --> 22:26.640]  real long-term commitment not ten guys in camo and you know three of them or I
[22:26.640 --> 22:31.040]  mean you know right out of the you know where and then you got you know other
[22:31.040 --> 22:39.320]  Fed ops running around running textbook brainwashing on people I just told
[22:39.320 --> 22:43.080]  everybody get out of there and I would Joel Scowzen and all the rest of them
[22:43.080 --> 22:49.640]  said you need to get out of there right now you need to get out of there as
[22:49.640 --> 22:56.960]  quickly as you can you need to use this to to to to to move on you've had your
[22:56.960 --> 23:01.920]  victory in Nevada the globalist hates you for it you're gonna be shut up it's
[23:01.920 --> 23:06.680]  gonna end badly and now they're going to try to use this tragedy and I'm they
[23:06.680 --> 23:13.480]  probably did executing this mr. Levoix who looks like a good man who meant
[23:13.480 --> 23:19.880]  well but had a martyr complex and has gotten what he wanted I can read his
[23:19.880 --> 23:24.040]  quotes from his book and his public statements and then you got some of
[23:24.040 --> 23:27.480]  these other people bringing their daughters and then there's witnesses
[23:27.480 --> 23:31.160]  young women are witnesses to this and I believe them that they got him out he
[23:31.160 --> 23:35.400]  jumps out and says go ahead and shoot me and they just shot him other people are
[23:35.400 --> 23:39.280]  saying he was on his knees his hands behind his head well no the witnesses
[23:39.280 --> 23:43.160]  that were there are saying they got out and they had his hands up and they
[23:43.160 --> 23:49.840]  shot him it's horrible but you're gonna hand Obama and the globalist everything
[23:49.840 --> 23:59.960]  they want if there's any tit for tat if the you know if if feds get shot in the
[23:59.960 --> 24:03.480]  back of the head while they're pumping gas or whatever you have no idea who
[24:03.480 --> 24:07.920]  that is you're gonna go walk up and shoot you have no idea how many of those
[24:07.920 --> 24:13.120]  people are on our side and do not like what's happening and are trying to leak
[24:13.120 --> 24:18.440]  information to stop what's going on the bad ones are the bureaucrats up there
[24:18.440 --> 24:24.280]  bragging at the BLM yeah we steal property huh and then those you know
[24:24.280 --> 24:32.920]  350 pound goblins send the men to go then intimidate and hurt everyone it's
[24:32.920 --> 24:41.480]  disgusting and I cut my teeth exposing what happened at Waco and bullhorning the
[24:41.480 --> 24:45.520]  judge and in going over it all and what they did there was terrible they wanted
[24:45.520 --> 24:49.120]  to start a fight with the American people at that point but folks got so upset
[24:49.120 --> 24:52.600]  and didn't buy into calling them a cult and the rest of it that they had to back
[24:52.600 --> 24:56.400]  off and it blew up in their face so then they pulled Oklahoma City to
[24:56.400 --> 25:01.600]  demonize the Liberty Movement and their same agent was in Waco and was at
[25:01.600 --> 25:07.920]  Oklahoma City and when he didn't want to blow up a daycare center when McVay
[25:07.920 --> 25:14.320]  didn't want to blow up a daycare center they set him up and drugged his butt
[25:14.320 --> 25:19.720]  that day and had him found by the state police on the side of the highway and you
[25:19.720 --> 25:25.720]  know the governor's brother wrote a book one year before where the federal
[25:25.720 --> 25:32.920]  building is bombed by a Tom McVay and he dedicated the book to the Secret
[25:32.920 --> 25:42.320]  Circle you see this is all different religious orders folks battling each
[25:42.320 --> 25:47.440]  other over what controls America and you've got the dark side Luciferian
[25:47.440 --> 25:56.200]  1776 copycat group that ran the French Revolution Adam Weishaupt trying to
[25:56.200 --> 26:03.200]  create a false Illuminati or the light Liberty God and overtake it and
[26:03.200 --> 26:07.840]  George Washington wrote about this in at least nine different letters before he
[26:07.840 --> 26:13.200]  died probably poisoned we know they bled him to death because he was getting
[26:13.200 --> 26:23.080]  ready to lead a movement in the Masonic order to kick the devil worshipping
[26:23.080 --> 26:27.040]  Illuminati out of it that was trying to take it over I mean you want to know the
[26:27.040 --> 26:32.720]  big secrets folks this is it and it's there in history pieces here and there
[26:32.720 --> 26:41.640]  and given down through lore through the lore of places like the Lone Star state
[26:41.640 --> 26:50.520]  the state meant to defend the Republic till the end the state meant to be a
[26:50.520 --> 26:54.040]  redoubt in the future if the enemy was able to take over the rest of the
[26:54.040 --> 27:00.280]  country these covert wars have been going on since before this country was
[27:00.280 --> 27:02.640]  founded
[27:02.640 --> 27:11.640]  and these are the type of secrets you learn if you're in the right lodge and
[27:11.640 --> 27:28.640]  a 33rd degree Mason it's not the secrets of Solomon's temple so I'm gonna get
[27:28.640 --> 27:36.280]  into the big news that this Bundy tragedy distracts from but I hope this
[27:36.280 --> 27:42.640]  doesn't just continue to unravel and become something to demonize the
[27:42.640 --> 27:46.120]  Liberty movement and that they don't carry out some type of new Oklahoma City
[27:46.120 --> 27:54.000]  and blame it on the Patriots and we've got Democrat internal talking papers and
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.200]  points that came out years ago even on Fox News five years ago that they're
[27:58.200 --> 28:02.040]  planning a new Oklahoma City to be blamed on the Liberty movement if the
[28:02.040 --> 28:08.920]  Tea Party tries to take back the Congress violence is not the answer at
[28:08.920 --> 28:14.000]  this point you have a total right to defensively defend yourself but not
[28:14.000 --> 28:20.400]  offensively and we need to be smart we need to demand the squad car videos of
[28:20.400 --> 28:23.560]  the state police and the feds be released immediately if they didn't execute
[28:23.560 --> 28:31.800]  this guy we need to have other folks as they supposedly are still surrounded the
[28:31.800 --> 28:35.720]  facility there's still people inside including some people's daughters you
[28:35.720 --> 28:41.880]  don't bring your daughter to something if you're you know writing news articles
[28:41.880 --> 28:46.960]  and giving speeches about how you're ready to die and then it's a magnet for
[28:46.960 --> 28:50.280]  crazies where they're arresting drunks pulling up getting out saying I'm gonna
[28:50.280 --> 28:55.440]  kill cops and falling down and weirdos and Summa wrestler outfits and you know
[28:55.440 --> 29:01.920]  people stealing federal vehicles you couldn't write a script better to make
[29:01.920 --> 29:05.000]  the Liberty movement look bad
[29:07.840 --> 29:12.400]  and then people in the middle of it who mean well committed not knowing how
[29:12.400 --> 29:18.360]  they're being set up saying we've got to stay the course no matter what we've
[29:18.360 --> 29:26.000]  got to stay right here and no matter what goes on or how many provocateurs
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.160]  come in to make us look like idiots we've got to just sit here and stay the
[29:29.160 --> 29:35.080]  course that's not military thinking that's not historical thinking that's
[29:35.080 --> 29:40.800]  how you get destroyed and so I must say you don't speak for us in the Liberty
[29:40.800 --> 29:44.720]  movement for anyone that agrees with Alex Jones we're gonna come back with a
[29:44.720 --> 29:48.520]  huge World War four news it's mainstream news it's over the top we're on the

[30:02.000 --> 30:06.040]  Trump expressed irritation that Fox News plan to leave Megan Kelly as moderator
[30:06.040 --> 30:11.560]  of the Thursday night GOP debate Megan Kelly's really biased against me I know
[30:11.560 --> 30:15.800]  that everybody knows that do you really think she can be fair at a debate to
[30:15.800 --> 30:20.320]  which Fox News replied that he doesn't get to pick the journalists they can't
[30:20.320 --> 30:24.880]  toy with me like they toy with everybody else I won't be doing the debate a smart
[30:24.880 --> 30:29.440]  move after Rand Paul was arbitrarily excluded by Fox business Paul held his

[33:24.480 --> 33:47.960]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[33:54.480 --> 34:06.480]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen this is the info war. I'm Alex Jones your host.
[34:06.920 --> 34:11.680]  The Bundys are a microcosm as I've said many times and if you understand what's
[34:11.680 --> 34:15.360]  happening to them you understand what's happening across the board and I'm
[34:15.360 --> 34:18.600]  going to get back into that with Joe Biggs here in about 10 minutes he's there
[34:18.600 --> 34:23.880]  in the news center and is going to be coming in to join us but before I go
[34:23.880 --> 34:27.760]  any further let me get into the other news we're going to be covering
[34:27.760 --> 34:32.320]  throughout the broadcast and I'm gonna get to some of this in a moment doomsday
[34:32.320 --> 34:37.160]  clock world more dangerous than during Cold War that's the Hill newspaper with
[34:37.160 --> 34:41.360]  a consortium of former top generals scientists and others saying it's the
[34:41.360 --> 34:45.520]  closest to doomsday it's ever been how many times I told you that the last three
[34:45.520 --> 34:50.680]  years and that's also a lot of top military are saying behind the scenes
[34:50.680 --> 34:58.520]  you know my dad takes serious what I say smart guy highly educated informed been
[34:58.520 --> 35:05.880]  around the world but he was at a event with a bunch of former generals because
[35:05.880 --> 35:10.040]  they were involved in trying to put nutraceuticals through the FDA's they
[35:10.040 --> 35:13.520]  could actually obviously patent it and then have it as nutraceutical because
[35:13.520 --> 35:17.520]  he's been involved in that a long time and my dad was talking to multi-star
[35:17.520 --> 35:19.960]  generals they're like we listen to your son every day he's absolutely dead on
[35:19.960 --> 35:22.840]  target we don't know how he has all this intel and information must have
[35:22.840 --> 35:25.760]  incredible sources we can't believe they haven't killed him yet and my dad can
[35:25.760 --> 35:29.120]  be said man these guys were talking for like an hour about all this and he was
[35:29.120 --> 35:32.960]  like wow so you're really that accurate and then it was weird like ever since
[35:32.960 --> 35:35.960]  then he doesn't even argue with me anymore and I'm it's weird to have your
[35:35.960 --> 35:38.880]  father his father's kind of automatically argue with her sons no he's
[35:38.880 --> 35:46.920]  sixty six years old but it's just weird but it's not that it's I'm immersed in
[35:46.920 --> 35:51.720]  it we have the contacts we figured out the operation we know the plan we don't
[35:51.720 --> 35:55.600]  know exactly when they're gonna execute her in what order but man it just is
[35:55.600 --> 36:00.480]  unbelievable so it's not that special I'm not that special I just was immersed
[36:00.480 --> 36:06.560]  in it and we have the connections like my father educated me when I was young
[36:06.560 --> 36:13.080]  and others and the John Burt society and others so we know now and so the info
[36:13.080 --> 36:16.400]  is out people don't have to believe us they can look at our research see the
[36:16.400 --> 36:20.600]  angles and then see it for themselves and you may see it clearer than we do and
[36:20.600 --> 36:24.200]  give us more intel that's what's happening is we're exponentially learning
[36:24.200 --> 36:29.320]  more I look at the mistakes I made 15 years ago 20 years ago the dumb things
[36:29.320 --> 36:33.280]  I did how I helped the enemy in so many ways we heard them more than we helped
[36:33.280 --> 36:37.480]  them but now we're getting to where we just heard them I mean it's like 99%
[36:37.480 --> 36:42.200]  hammer their head in the ground we we connect with a political punch it's a
[36:42.200 --> 36:51.000]  jawbreaker 20 years ago I was slapping them on the wrist now it's hammer and we
[36:51.000 --> 36:56.080]  have the moves that will hammer the enemy to hell and we want you to come and
[36:56.080 --> 37:01.160]  join us and and look take everything we do copy it I don't care my problem is
[37:01.160 --> 37:06.360]  like a Glenn Beck we've ever three years mystery political science theater
[37:06.360 --> 37:11.400]  3000 that's our exact name on record for covering debates and and say to the
[37:11.400 --> 37:17.360]  unions they now call it that and do the exact same thing while trying to demonize
[37:17.360 --> 37:21.360]  us and get us off stations and shut us down and I mean I'll talk to station
[37:21.360 --> 37:23.880]  owners are like yeah those Beck people don't like you being on the same station
[37:23.880 --> 37:28.160]  they're threatening to say man you're trying to like be me misrepresent what
[37:28.160 --> 37:32.480]  we are and then bury me like a body snatcher I'm not laying down next to you
[37:32.480 --> 37:36.760]  and going to sleep while you put the pod next to me and I'm not bragging about
[37:36.760 --> 37:41.360]  M4s or Alex Jones I'm just saying we've hit the zeitgeist to the level that
[37:41.360 --> 37:47.360]  people literally plagiarize in front of everyone while trying to put me
[37:47.360 --> 37:54.680]  politically under the ground pushing daisies no no you're not no you're not
[37:54.680 --> 37:58.920]  and I just you know cannot believe the arrogance but I'm digressing we're in
[37:58.920 --> 38:02.080]  big brains putting a clip together showing this of the show going back
[38:02.080 --> 38:05.760]  three years calling him you know it was actually my idea and Rob Dewey came up
[38:05.760 --> 38:08.560]  with it I said you know like mystery science theater and he goes political
[38:08.560 --> 38:13.360]  science theater I said yeah yeah yeah that's it quite frankly though you you
[38:13.360 --> 38:16.480]  stole the wrong name we're actually changing the name I don't think people
[38:16.480 --> 38:20.160]  pretty much understand that though it is kind of comedy what we do it's more
[38:20.160 --> 38:23.480]  serious so we're already trying to come up with a new name for doing that now the
[38:23.480 --> 38:25.840]  young Turks are doing the same thing that's fine as they didn't copy the name
[38:25.840 --> 38:31.520]  just can't you people innovate or trailblaze anything yourselves but I
[38:31.520 --> 38:35.080]  don't care if you copy what we do and give us no credit just don't try to
[38:35.080 --> 38:41.360]  destroy me it's uncool I mean you can crap on me just don't rub it in you know
[38:41.360 --> 38:45.520]  it's like a full metal jacket quote I don't want it's a family show but you know
[38:45.520 --> 38:48.000]  I bet you're the type of guy that was such and such and not even give somebody
[38:48.000 --> 38:58.840]  you know what you know just come on have some basic decency but I guess if you're
[38:58.840 --> 39:01.880]  gonna steal from somebody you gotta knock them on the head I guess I guess
[39:01.880 --> 39:04.680]  that's kind of what goes with the territory now let me get into the really
[39:04.680 --> 39:12.240]  serious news doomsday clock world more dangerous than during Cold War oh boy

[44:54.480 --> 45:04.640]  it just gets crazier and crazier and crazier oh look at this headline high
[45:04.640 --> 45:11.720]  profile militant John Ritzheim flees home to Arizona hours before the fed
[45:11.720 --> 45:15.080]  spring the trap oh isn't that convenient we're gonna be getting into that in just
[45:15.080 --> 45:20.720]  a moment with the Oregon standoff having a bloody turn and in the mainstream
[45:20.720 --> 45:24.200]  media I have TV and I have the daily mail saying there was a shootout no there
[45:24.200 --> 45:27.560]  wasn't the feds even admit that so I guess if the feds pull me over and shoot
[45:27.560 --> 45:34.040]  me they'll just you'll just say it was a shootout very very dangerous that's all
[45:34.040 --> 45:39.240]  coming up China warned Soros against declaring war on its currency 20,000
[45:39.240 --> 45:43.760]  chunks of space debris are floating around earth or on the Zika virus there's
[45:43.760 --> 45:49.480]  just hundreds of key articles but first ladies and gentlemen I want to tell
[45:49.480 --> 45:55.000]  everybody that we are running the biggest special we ever have on DNA
[45:55.000 --> 46:01.280]  force this is our Rolls-Royce product comparable formulas are three hundred to
[46:01.280 --> 46:07.120]  six hundred dollars just the bio PQQ in it cost about forty dollars for us that's
[46:07.120 --> 46:11.240]  why a comparable just a dose to bio PQQ is 40 bucks with other leading brands
[46:11.240 --> 46:15.360]  that aren't even organic like ours and it has a whole bunch of other key
[46:15.360 --> 46:18.760]  ingredients that are very expensive as well but we just give you the very lowest
[46:18.760 --> 46:22.400]  price on it and this has turned a lot of heads the two years it's been out we
[46:22.400 --> 46:27.600]  could actually say about this 125 clinical studies nerve growth factor
[46:27.600 --> 46:33.080]  energized and more I forget how many pounds it is it's something like 300
[46:33.080 --> 46:41.320]  pounds of blueberries 300 pounds of blueberries to get the same amount of
[46:41.320 --> 46:46.800]  vitamin C that's in bio PQQ it's basically super vitamin C like Linus
[46:46.800 --> 46:49.800]  Pauling won the Nobel Prize for what it could do but if you take that much
[46:49.800 --> 46:58.000]  vitamin C you get sick you get diarrhea but not with bio PQQ now we're paying
[46:58.000 --> 47:04.160]  $14,000 a kilo for Misha BC America that owns the patent for this and they
[47:04.160 --> 47:07.200]  can't believe we're even buying it they only basically sell it in Japan in
[47:07.200 --> 47:12.560]  places they make it here because no one will even pay for it or they pay $600 a
[47:12.560 --> 47:16.760]  bottle for the real deal I mean to give you an idea that's why it's ladies and
[47:16.760 --> 47:22.760]  gentlemen normally 150 bucks because this stuff's like $80 of product going
[47:22.760 --> 47:29.120]  into the bottle this ladies and gentlemen is $97 it doesn't say on my
[47:29.120 --> 47:40.240]  sheet I know it's 25% off got 9750 normally 134 discounted 9750 so you can
[47:40.240 --> 47:44.840]  see it's almost a loss of leader folks when you've got depending on which batch
[47:44.840 --> 47:50.720]  we do and how much it costs between $70 and $80 of product the bio PQQ cost us
[47:50.720 --> 47:54.680]  something like depending on how much we pay at the time $35 to $40 for one
[47:54.680 --> 47:59.600]  ingredient and it's got all the other super ingredients in it it is we believe
[47:59.600 --> 48:06.800]  from our research the ultimate pill for you name it I mean my finger was cut off
[48:06.800 --> 48:11.960]  hanging by skin it was still numb a decade later when this came out two and
[48:11.960 --> 48:15.480]  a half years ago I began taking it and my whole side of my finger started
[48:15.480 --> 48:20.200]  tingling a month in and it the feeling came back and that's exactly what they
[48:20.200 --> 48:24.840]  say it does it's it's one of the only documented things with nerve regeneration
[48:24.840 --> 48:29.960]  it is incredible and everybody's asking me why don't you ever talk about this
[48:29.960 --> 48:33.800]  well it cost a lot and I just want to plug you know the colloidal silver that's
[48:33.800 --> 48:37.720]  you know $19 I just you know no no this is the super product this is what
[48:37.720 --> 48:42.280]  people should check out for themselves and the discount only goes for a few
[48:42.280 --> 48:47.860]  days because here's the deal the discount only goes for a few days because we
[48:47.860 --> 48:51.480]  only have a limited supply and we'll get more in in five weeks so I decided to do
[48:51.480 --> 48:54.880]  this as a loss leader and to sell it out it'll probably be gone by next week
[48:54.880 --> 49:00.360]  info warslife.com and the purchase funds this key operation there's some other

[49:15.000 --> 49:20.520]  one let's bring Joe Biggs in former Army Staff Sergeant combat vet of Afghanistan
[49:20.520 --> 49:26.440]  in Iraq combat vet he can he can comment on the tactics you know the so-called
[49:26.440 --> 49:30.120]  military people that were there most of which were never in the military what he
[49:30.120 --> 49:35.720]  saw the fact that they pulled the car over and then reportedly they ran it
[49:35.720 --> 49:40.080]  crashed according to the daughter that was in the car and others and then they'd
[49:40.080 --> 49:43.520]  already shot up the vehicle the woman jumps out the man jumps out and they
[49:43.520 --> 49:49.160]  shoot mr. Levoy I think the man had a lot of courage I think he meant well and
[49:49.160 --> 49:52.560]  he was ready to die and we're gonna go over his quotes to newspapers just last
[49:52.560 --> 49:57.320]  week that said I don't think it's time for a shooting war people don't even
[49:57.320 --> 50:00.360]  understand the factions that are involved the globalists want to start a
[50:00.360 --> 50:06.120]  shooting war but Joe Biggs was there for a week last month in the middle of this
[50:06.120 --> 50:10.520]  circus I guess actually earlier this month in the middle of this circus and
[50:10.520 --> 50:14.440]  now they still reportedly tell me of a change last hour have the wildlife
[50:14.440 --> 50:19.520]  refuge surrounded the feds now are going wayco style and and and I'm telling
[50:19.520 --> 50:22.480]  people to come out but but they're keeping the media back I want to send
[50:22.480 --> 50:26.280]  you out there as soon as possible hopefully this ends peacefully but for
[50:26.280 --> 50:30.520]  the aftermath the demonstrations and to track what's coming and what's
[50:30.520 --> 50:35.360]  unfolding I'm not saying any of the people that got arrested are feds and
[50:35.360 --> 50:40.040]  I'm also not saying that there's a son of this guy at high noon but they did this
[50:40.040 --> 50:43.240]  with Atari I said watch should they release in a few weeks and who the
[50:43.240 --> 50:47.360]  charges quietly get dropped on because that's what they do to protect
[50:47.360 --> 50:51.720]  informants and operatives if there were any in the in the group that are in
[50:51.720 --> 50:55.680]  there and I'm just putting that out there that needs to be watched very very
[50:55.680 --> 51:00.920]  closely we're watching it very closely and you look at the mug shots and see
[51:00.920 --> 51:07.040]  who looks concerned and who doesn't but this is this is very very serious
[51:07.040 --> 51:11.440]  information obviously we're gonna be unfolding the feds need to release the
[51:11.440 --> 51:14.640]  video right now we have one of the daughters the people that was in the
[51:14.640 --> 51:18.720]  car will read her quotes saying that again they pulled them over they said
[51:18.720 --> 51:23.200]  let the women go drive off and we'll go with you they said no they drove off the
[51:23.200 --> 51:28.560]  feds reportedly shot at them they crashed the vehicle the guy gets out
[51:28.560 --> 51:35.840]  Levoix and they reportedly shot him once in the head and then one of the
[51:35.840 --> 51:40.360]  Bundy brothers got grazed and Joe Biggs has the latest to break all this down
[51:40.360 --> 51:44.960]  but just overall the situation is really sad again I think the Bundy's have
[51:44.960 --> 51:47.880]  courage I know the feds are out of control we pretty much have the
[51:47.880 --> 51:52.280]  Declaration of Independence do have a right to physically stand up now but we
[51:52.280 --> 51:56.120]  need to choose our battles like they said at Bunker Hill and I'm sorry I
[51:56.120 --> 52:00.680]  don't think in the smarts departments and I'm not saying they're stupid but
[52:00.680 --> 52:04.400]  these guys haven't been in this 20 plus years like I and others have been in it
[52:04.400 --> 52:08.120]  they don't have the growth curve they don't have the knowledge curve and
[52:08.120 --> 52:12.760]  they're not they're not the leaders you know for 1776 part two I mean they're
[52:12.760 --> 52:16.640]  just not George Washington I don't even consider myself towards Washington and
[52:16.640 --> 52:20.320]  I'm one of the most focused out front informed people in the fight against the
[52:20.320 --> 52:26.280]  New World Order but we supported them out there with what happened in Nevada
[52:26.280 --> 52:30.080]  they were in the right it was a magic moment but now it's turned south and
[52:30.080 --> 52:33.440]  it's very sad Joe your overall view of this crisis and then let's get into the
[52:33.440 --> 52:37.520]  numbers and facts here you know we got there I was reading news reports
[52:37.520 --> 52:41.160]  everyone's saying that they you know the people in burns didn't want the
[52:41.160 --> 52:43.800]  Bundy's there they didn't want the militiamen there you know and after
[52:43.800 --> 52:46.200]  getting boots on ground and actually be able to talk to some of the locals I
[52:46.200 --> 52:50.120]  just wasn't the case so right off the bat you can kind of tell that they were
[52:50.120 --> 52:54.880]  ready to demonize this use this as a maybe to set an example for what the
[52:54.880 --> 52:58.840]  government wanted to do to people like this to so-called right-wingers who are
[52:58.840 --> 53:02.040]  going to go up and make a stand against the government because they did get beat
[53:02.040 --> 53:05.800]  back in Nevada when that happened with the standoff on the Bundy ramp and we
[53:05.800 --> 53:09.160]  can roll some of that B roll in the background it's it's it's historic
[53:09.160 --> 53:14.480]  feds surrender arm fed surrendered to citizens they were threatened to shoot
[53:14.480 --> 53:17.640]  David Knight at the front of it with the camera and then they they were in the
[53:17.640 --> 53:21.440]  wrong that would have been alexander concord shot her around the world if
[53:21.440 --> 53:25.800]  they would have mowed down people with their guns not up but guns down on horse
[53:25.800 --> 53:29.280]  back with American flags that would have kicked off a revolution and we might
[53:29.280 --> 53:33.000]  win that one but if we but if a revolution kicks off in the wrong way
[53:33.000 --> 53:37.560]  and we shoot first that gives the enemy home field advantage and the towing
[53:37.560 --> 53:41.080]  costs to be receiving the kickoff go ahead well you can tell that they were
[53:41.080 --> 53:44.120]  upset over this is the fact that they did have to back down that this was a
[53:44.120 --> 53:50.040]  worldwide event that was seen by people all over and that the federal government
[53:50.040 --> 53:54.120]  had to step back they had to move back and the Bundy stood up and all these
[53:54.120 --> 53:58.640]  people came out they supported they showed up and it was this huge embarrassment
[53:58.640 --> 54:01.760]  on the federal government and then you see what happened here in Oregon they
[54:01.760 --> 54:05.520]  took this as an opportunity I think that's why they brought in the amount of
[54:05.520 --> 54:09.280]  FBI they did why they brought in more police officers from different counties
[54:09.280 --> 54:14.400]  surrounding that area and hopes that they would be able to eventually go in take
[54:14.400 --> 54:18.640]  these guys and make an example of them and it's just kind of been a I don't
[54:18.640 --> 54:21.760]  know a countdown you know there were many nights we thought it was going to
[54:21.760 --> 54:25.360]  happen while I was there I was only there three or four days and you know
[54:25.360 --> 54:28.720]  night after night you would see these guys bringing up the tractors the trucks
[54:28.720 --> 54:32.760]  they were worried that there was gonna be this imminent FBI raid that was gonna
[54:32.760 --> 54:37.920]  happen and they stayed inside that compound but since then they've began to
[54:37.920 --> 54:43.600]  venture out more and more and now guaranteed they got advised that they'll
[54:43.600 --> 54:46.840]  watch this later with their lawyers and stuff maybe start listening to me like
[54:46.840 --> 54:49.720]  like Rand Paul finally started listening a few weeks ago and I'm not bragging we
[54:49.720 --> 54:53.520]  know what we're talking about the folks then I'm sure advise you it's safe they
[54:53.520 --> 54:57.640]  can come out of course that's not when it was safe and and again if people aren't
[54:57.640 --> 55:01.320]  provocateurs that are in Sumo wrestler outfits and people you know doing all
[55:01.320 --> 55:05.360]  this then then they ought to be because that's exactly what I would do if I was
[55:05.360 --> 55:09.480]  on the other side of it you know I had a chance to actually you know talk with
[55:09.480 --> 55:13.960]  LaVoy finicum and he is definitely one of those guys who's extremely passionate
[55:13.960 --> 55:18.080]  he believed in what was going on and he said before look when we were there he
[55:18.080 --> 55:21.440]  actually walked out there was word that the there was a warrant out for his
[55:21.440 --> 55:25.560]  arrest so he walked out to the end of the the wildlife refuge sat asleep and
[55:25.560 --> 55:29.240]  back down had his little rifle and said hey I'm staying here if they want to
[55:29.240 --> 55:34.280]  come arrest me come to me he was making a stand we can only admire it and you
[55:34.280 --> 55:38.480]  know he's interesting that he's the one that got shot and killed yeah because I
[55:38.480 --> 55:43.080]  mean I guess he was ready for it and I guess you know he wrote a book about you
[55:43.080 --> 55:47.120]  know the martial law basically starting after some patriots get killed like I'm
[55:47.120 --> 55:51.280]  gonna pull up some of the quotes from the book he he wrote I mean I guess he kind
[55:51.280 --> 55:55.800]  of fell in love with the idea of that so is that the martyr everybody needs or
[55:55.800 --> 55:58.960]  once when the guy wanted to be a martyr again I'm not saying he's a bad guy I'm
[55:58.960 --> 56:03.800]  just saying you know this really doesn't make sense yeah I mean it's interesting
[56:03.800 --> 56:07.080]  how this whole thing unfolds you have a Victoria sharp one of the ladies who was
[56:07.080 --> 56:11.400]  in the vehicle last night saying that he in fact got out he had his hands up that
[56:11.400 --> 56:14.360]  they shot at him first and that's what happened you know you have that whole
[56:14.360 --> 56:18.800]  hands up don't shoot thing and now you have other eyewitnesses two drivers two
[56:18.800 --> 56:23.320]  guys separate vehicles talking about how in fact that wasn't the case the guy who
[56:23.320 --> 56:27.640]  was a bodyguard his name is McConnell this is in an article by Raw Story titled
[56:27.640 --> 56:31.240]  eyewitnesses knock down conspiracy theories about Levoix Finnecombe dying
[56:31.240 --> 56:35.200]  with his hands up now this guy took to Facebook late last night early this
[56:35.200 --> 56:39.920]  morning everyone look at it and came out and said that he saw from his point of
[56:39.920 --> 56:43.480]  view that they were pulled over they were stopped Levoix Finnecombe's truck went
[56:43.480 --> 56:48.480]  around they sped around that stop and went into some kind of like snow
[56:48.480 --> 56:54.560]  embankment and at that point in time based off his you know testimony you
[56:54.560 --> 56:58.560]  know in his Facebook post that they began to argue and that Finnecombe had
[56:58.560 --> 57:01.680]  gotten out and this was like a diesel truck so when he got out the wheels were
[57:01.680 --> 57:05.520]  still spinning and the truck was moving and from what he saw and another guy saw
[57:05.520 --> 57:09.600]  as it Finnecombe got out and ran towards these officers well that's what the
[57:09.600 --> 57:12.400]  daughter I've got her name right here who's saying it's horrible they killed
[57:12.400 --> 57:16.400]  him you know she's saying they're bad she's with them and you know a daughter
[57:16.400 --> 57:20.200]  one of the men in the truck she's saying you know they shot him in the head as he
[57:20.200 --> 57:25.120]  ran towards them saying shoot me so so that's what the eyewitnesses who who
[57:25.120 --> 57:29.520]  are on the side of the Bundy's and everybody are saying I'm not defending
[57:29.520 --> 57:32.200]  what happened I don't think it's good they shot a guy running at him who was
[57:32.200 --> 57:36.000]  who who was on arm but I mean can we roll the footage from the original Bundy
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.880]  deal because that's I've been wanting that I know we have it in there you know
[57:38.880 --> 57:42.520]  just some of that in the background but but here's some footage are the feds
[57:42.520 --> 57:48.520]  already releasing footage Nico tell us what this is that we're saying again
[57:48.520 --> 57:51.600]  for radio listeners. This is B-roll that Travis sent us this morning from Oregon
[57:51.600 --> 57:57.760]  which features LaVoy Finnecombe. Oh this is earlier footage oh absolutely I saw
[57:57.760 --> 58:00.440]  that that's where he sent this to me this morning yes and another checkpoint
[58:00.440 --> 58:03.400]  okay yeah there's a lot of this so again if you're a radio listener just tuned in
[58:03.400 --> 58:07.520]  we're also TV and FullWars.com forward slash show. We don't know what happened
[58:07.520 --> 58:10.480]  you know I don't know if he did have his hands up I'm not saying that he didn't
[58:10.480 --> 58:14.600]  and I'm not saying that these guys are you know lying or not. Well some people
[58:14.600 --> 58:18.560]  are putting the story out that he was on his knees exactly but that's folks on
[58:18.560 --> 58:23.040]  Facebook that aren't there but the woman who was there the daughter I've
[58:23.040 --> 58:25.880]  got her name will come back and then go over it said oh it's terrible they
[58:25.880 --> 58:29.320]  killed him they murdered him you know they're from that perspective yeah but
[58:29.320 --> 58:35.120]  he got out and ran at him yelling him so it's a very very tense situation folks
[58:35.120 --> 58:37.880]  this is very very sad we don't want to start a civil war over this and give
[58:37.880 --> 58:42.560]  Obama a big giant present big stay there where I come right back to you and look

[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.040]  gentleman wrote a novel we're gonna go over at the moment saying that we needed
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:30.160]  a bloody revolution in America he told the newspaper last week got it up on
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.760]  infowarstore.com that he thought it was gonna come down to violence that he was
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:38.160]  gonna stand his ground the feds are out of control they're run by foreign banks
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.320]  they are robbing people but the public doesn't fully understand that yet
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.520]  they're starting to fact a new national poll the public sees the government as
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.240]  the number one enemy well the people that run the government they are the
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:52.520]  end but they want to get us fighting with a low-level government which will
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:56.600]  descend into civil war like they do in the Middle East and Europe Eastern Europe
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.480]  we don't need to be stupid about this it will not defeat the globalist if a
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:06.000]  bunch of FBI SWAT team guys get shot in the back okay I mean if it goes into
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.800]  civil war and they start coming after folks like Alexander Schultz and
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:15.480]  Ethan said you know then you got to meet them then it goes to that but I'm the
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:19.920]  public and the feds best friend because I'm trying to stop this whole civil war
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.680]  George Soros is trying to kick off Joe Biggs you were there you knew Levoix the
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.880]  man that's been killed what do you make of the folks now you're being locked up
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:37.160]  what is it seven of them very very sad and just really to see the left getting
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.360]  off on this and rubbing their hands together and saying good kill the white
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.880]  terrorists that's what they've been calling them calling for their deaths
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:47.240]  y'all Kato is just sickening yeah I mean so let's look at it this way what
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.680]  happened in Nevada they were on their land it was at the right time the right
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:57.480]  place they had a great backing it was wanted and it was a perfect timing for
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:01.080]  that scenario to unfold when it did where it did how it did with the people
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:05.600]  there when Oregon happened you know there was a lot of people out there that
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.120]  said hey man we support the bunnies we're just kind of confused about why
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.680]  here what's going on you know the fact that the the Hammons have come out and
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.800]  you know simply said hey we're gonna turn ourselves in some of the people that
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:22.640]  were hanging around and doing stuff like I said I've been a big support I've
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:29.120]  even spoke to Amon Mundy's mother before and things like that and and had
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.920]  conversations with them I do believe that they have pure intentions that deep
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.600]  down inside they don't really have any ill intention whatsoever that what they
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.800]  were doing they were truly trying to make another stand and I just like I
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.160]  said I thought this was just not at the right place you know but then you have
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.280]  that left again coming out which I don't get saying white tear you know you have
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.320]  all these people on Twitter coming out last night saying oh great you know these
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.040]  terrorists these white terrorists are arrested call them terrorists that's
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:58.800]  what they should be well sorry you know and they're and they're all the black
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.400]  lives matters people and well I mean they want to race for and and and they
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:08.840]  paint everything is racial and they also sit there and want a police state in
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.480]  America even though they claim they're criticizing it they're just disconnected
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.720]  dumb stupid people I mean really to the day what happened Martha and Tom didn't
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.920]  get to go into the wildlife refuge and work a few days a week I mean there's
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:23.200]  probably hardly anybody out there really manning that place it's in the
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.240]  middle of nowhere meanwhile they they they quote-unquote break into this
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.760]  federal facility and what do I see them doing when I'm down there sweeping
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:35.280]  cleaning off the sidewalks taking care of the property the land making sure it's
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:39.200]  fine I didn't see anyone in black lives matter and Ferguson break into a store
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:43.240]  and start doing shop keep work and rearranging stuff no they were taking
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.760]  stuff and running out and throw them all tough cocktails and lighting buildings
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.400]  on fire well also look at the Daily Mail headline and I saw this on the local
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.560]  news there it says Oregon standoff militiamen killed and shoot out with
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:04:00.560]  FBI this was written today after the feds had already said that they didn't
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:06.480]  shoot up that Levoix didn't shoot up yeah wow Daily Mail I usually liked the
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.840]  Daily Mail but man that is a loadable correct your story right now well they've
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:14.480]  been just sitting there as soon as the headlines came out last night there was
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.120]  a possible situation unfolding in Oregon I could just see those people I was
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.240]  sitting there on my phone and I was just waiting on those headlines that come
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:24.800]  out on Twitter on on CNN on everything like that saying hey you know that
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:28.640]  there's been this massive shootout and that the Bundy's and they there was this
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:32.320]  huge standoff and then would they gun down and they shot at the the feds and
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.920]  this and that and it's just not the case the left was waiting on that just like

[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:21.720]  story is up on info wars dot com Bernie Sanders has been invited to the White
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:26.080]  House to meet with Obama that is a clear signal proving the major ref we reported
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.120]  on years ago that we now know is really getting by that Biden may come in with
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:34.280]  Elizabeth Warren senator if Hillary gets indicted or it might be a Bernie
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:41.920]  Sanders uh jump Berg Bloomberg or it could also be Joe Biden this shows that
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:47.520]  Hillary could really be indicted any minute former Republican whip political
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:53.120]  persecuted person Tom delay has gone public and he wouldn't make that up and
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.080]  said the word is the FBI at high levels gonna go public about what Hillary's
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:01.640]  done if the Justice Department doesn't indict but this Justice Department run
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:06.200]  by Lynch is out there saying he can just take guns outside of law he can just
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.000]  have doctors and not psychiatrists but just your doctor say you look depressed
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.480]  and have your guns taken it's all extra judicial extra legislative we've got
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:23.000]  huge amounts of news on top experts saying we've never been in a more dangerous
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.920]  position doomsday clock world more dangerous than during Cold War but I
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.200]  want to finish up with Joe Bigs because I think that you and David Knight
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:36.520]  probably a David did a really great job whenever he went and covered the first
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:40.320]  whole Bundy situation so he should be part of this as well and if Josh he's
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.760]  been going on the road a lot so I don't make our camera people go out every
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.760]  every week but Josh or whoever you guys want to take I think you should leave
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:51.720]  today or tomorrow morning and get out to Oregon and hit the ground running and
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:56.960]  and not just be reporters but leaders out there to really inform and show what's
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.080]  happening and identify provocateurs and really you have a mission of trying to
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.840]  stop a civil war slash race war that's why I went met with Farrakhan right when
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:10.080]  this whole organ thing was kicking off earlier in the month and he concurred
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:14.520]  and agreed with me on that front we really need to work for not having
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:19.800]  destabilization Soros is trying that in China Ukraine Syria he's bragging about
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.520]  it the Chinese government's threatening him in market watch China warned Soros
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.600]  against declaring war on its currency I want cameras on these feds I want to show
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.800]  what they're setting up what they're doing that the it's still ongoing that
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.720]  they have the sanctuary surrounded with people still in there and my big
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.720]  criticism is you're saying you're ready to die and it's a new Waco you don't
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.680]  bring your young daughters in there a teenage daughters and stuff I mean as a
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:48.280]  father that is the mind I got two daughters you know 11 and 7 that I just
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:51.440]  I've got to be honest here you know I'm criticizing the feds I'm criticizing
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.640]  some of the stuff I've seen with these militia folks people just say as you
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:59.800]  put a uniform on you now represent the militia of George Washington the
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.720]  constitutional office that's still here it's like saying somebody just puts on a
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.920]  Milton you know I put on a army uniform and said I was a staff sergeant I
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.360]  respect people that say they're in the militia but then I don't have to be under
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:15.400]  their command and agree with everything that they say or everything they do or
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:18.560]  that this not being the best place there's a lot of locals don't want you
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.520]  and you know and this isn't your own grazing rights and things like that but
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:32.000]  the man that was killed did say that he mr. LaVoy wrote a novel I'll go over it
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.480]  in a minute saying that we need a bloody revolution in this country and he told
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:40.600]  us paper last week he was ready for that so it's very sad that according to
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.800]  witnesses that were in the car and I'll go to that and dig that out of the
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.680]  article here in a moment we'll put it on screen it's in Paul Watson's article I
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:52.880]  witness Oregon militiamen murdered by cops he had his hands in the air daughter
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:12:00.240]  he was shot in the face but the woman in the car a witness is saying on record
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:05.440]  that they ran him off the road some things as they shot at him first then
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.240]  he jumped out and said fine shoot us all ran at him unarmed and they shot him so
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:14.480]  it was from somebody who was in the car that sounds pretty credible and this is
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.800]  a person saying it's wrong they murdered him but but but we don't we don't have
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:24.000]  anybody who was there saying that they put him on his knees and executed yeah
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.200]  what do you think Joe I mean for meeting the guy you know he like I said he was
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.200]  someone who's very passionate I don't see him as being someone who's just gonna
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:38.240]  lay down and kind of you know just take something like that so I mean to see or
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:43.160]  to hear the fact that he was going to charge that kind of goes with it whether
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:46.800]  or not the cops have shot him yeah I mean that's completely and totally out of
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.360]  control I mean this guy has tons of kids sorry I mean he was passionate about
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.800]  what he did I mean that that's fine we're passionate about what we do and what
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.680]  we believe in you know I think that it was handled poorly and at the same time
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:03.040]  I still think it was very smart though to be heading off that place when you know
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:09.000]  that the FBI was looking for every single chance you know to take you guys out you
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.400]  know well this high-profile militant John Ritzheimer who was one of the big
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:17.200]  cheerleaders and you also uncovered one of his demonstrations the armed March by
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:22.880]  the Fino Mosque in Phoenix which which people have a right to do them all about
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:28.240]  open marches in his provocative he left that morning and just said suddenly he
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.360]  said he'd never really go but he said he wanted to see his family and just ran
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:35.560]  back to them right on time yeah they actually picked him up and he is in
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:41.360]  jail he's in custody in Arizona right now as well so and there's definitely a
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.720]  lot of parts of this so I guess when we get out there we'll be able to try to
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.440]  figure out maybe talk to some of the people the eyewitnesses who saw what
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:51.640]  happened and try to get a little insight onto what's happened you know a lot of
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.760]  people's emotions they're going to take statements when they're there
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:58.480]  adrenaline's kicking and it might change so we'll see what we find out when we
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:03.160]  get there let's go ahead and get to this article Paul Joseph Watson and it
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.600]  links to the other articles where it's quoted eyewitness Oregon
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.880]  militiamen murdered by cops he had his hands in the air daughter he was shot
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:15.520]  in the face and Victoria Sharp who was in the car with the group when they were
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.600]  pulled over by the police and federal agents Sharp claims that Finnecom put
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:23.680]  his hands out of the car window and asked the police to allow the woman to
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:27.160]  leave the car they shot at him and we know that reportedly one of the Monday
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:32.480]  brothers got grazed mm-hmm so that's just crazy they shot him but they missed
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.920]  Sharp said adding that the group then attempted to drive away in the car but
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:42.760]  were shot at again by police well that's just terrible and I'm I believe her
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:45.920]  because first they said shoot out with no proof now they admit he didn't shoot
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:49.760]  at him and they shot him and it fits with you know him running towards them
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:54.640]  saying you know go ahead and shoot me when we crashed and stopped for a second
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:00.760]  time he got out of the car he had his hands in the air he just he's like just
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.800]  quote shoot me then and they did they shot him dead sharp said he was just
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.000]  walking with his hands in the air I swear to God and I'm quoting her and they
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.560]  shot him dead and his hands were down on the ground shot him three more times
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:22.360]  said sharp well you know senator Reed the gangster said we're gonna come after
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:28.120]  you we're gonna get you and your terrorist these are globalists that run
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:31.720]  America that have killed millions of people and launch false wars you're
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:36.840]  going up against them folks and so know that they went through and talked to the
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:40.400]  feds and found out which ones wanted to go out here and do this and if this is
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:45.280]  true and the evidence is pointing towards it they they were told you kill
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:50.280]  them and and just you know make it look plausible and you will be promoted you
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.200]  will get bonuses you know for combat or whatever like they give them in and
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:59.000]  medals and so this is sick and I want those squad car videos released now Joe
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.400]  Biggs what do you think though you're driving down the road they shoot at you
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.400]  they almost take off another person's head or something like that
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:11.440]  Amos brother then they shoot again at the vehicle of course I mean I some people
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.600]  are gonna get out angry as hell and start walking confronting them saying hey
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.920]  why you should tell me shoot at me I mean I'm not saying that I wouldn't do
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.240]  that maybe I would I don't know I I would be in that moment in time my
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:27.640]  adrenaline pumping angry well I mean I mean here's the deal they didn't say
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.840]  this but some of the others are all on record saying we're ready to die we're
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.920]  ready to have it start here we wanted to have but we've got guns we're not going
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:38.200]  out alive you've heard that how many times did you hear that so at the same
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.080]  time you know the feds are told go after these people and they supposedly have
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:45.960]  guns and they said they're not gonna be taken alive and he is kind of armed in
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:48.960]  dangerous it's like if somebody has told me they're they're not gonna you know
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.440]  they're coming after me and then I see him outside my backyard well the
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.680]  interesting thing is the time that I was there I never saw any guns except for
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.760]  one gun one time and that's when the boy Finnecombe came up there made that
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:02.840]  stand saying hey if you guys are gonna arrest me come arrest me and he had that
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:06.080]  long rifle as the only time I ever saw out there I was sleeping but yeah out
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:09.240]  there with a sleeping bag so maybe they took that saying hey they wanted to go
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.640]  after him because they knew he had a gun it was all over the TV all over the news
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.800]  they could prove that so maybe that's what they were gonna use that they wanted
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:21.160]  to use him as that person I mean it's completely a horrible tragedy that
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.280]  happened but sure but I mean here's the deal they're trying to start World War
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:28.920]  3 our troops are in a proxy war with the Russians in Ukraine they were in one in
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.480]  Syria but our military refused to be part of it because they're not gonna back
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.920]  al-Qaeda the troops can be talked into and the officers into backing
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.720]  Ukrainians against the Russians but they're like radical jihadis that want
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.840]  to kill us I mean this whole thing is melting down we told you there was a
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.960]  mutiny a good mutiny like against Hitler inside the military against what the
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.640]  globalists are doing so what I'm saying is a lot of military a lot of police and
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.240]  a lot of feds I mean I talked about Gino and a lot of other folks off record I
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:57.760]  mean the FBI listens the even the ATF listens and has been leaking stuff
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.960]  well I was on the federal marshals I was right on the FBI to come bust down my
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:04.240]  door last oh yeah I'm glad you brought this up let's bring this up let's show
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:07.420]  the ADL article in fact I meant to send them a letter from my lawyer we're
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:10.240]  gonna do this because I've been to soon before and they've retracted when they
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.680]  wrote some articles saying I wanted to kill Mexicans and I never said that and
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:17.240]  you know that came across the border I made them change it and so I've got a
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:21.040]  stay on them when they do that anatomy of a standoff ADL this is an advisor's
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:24.760]  departments around the country it says that you basically organized it
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:29.120]  stormed it and we're part of it and that I commanded you to do this when you
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.560]  showed up a weekend to it and we're critical of it and they came and told
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:39.120]  you that they thought I was a fed so the ADL inverting reality and they will
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:42.280]  retract it or I'm gonna be forced to sue them and they've been losing some
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:46.920]  lawsuits so you want to get sued ADL you got a lot of hooks but man you know
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:50.120]  that you know how to go after the Nazi war criminal that you give awards to
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.360]  George Soros sorry go ahead I'm saying you know the FBI is looking the ADL the
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.960]  SPLC and all this stuff and I'm sitting here thinking all right all right they're
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.640]  already starting to arrest people they just picked up Reitzheimer and Phoenix
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:04.120]  I'm an awesome what's gonna keep them from banging down my door at my place so
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.280]  I was sitting there all night kind of like all right well I guess it's gonna
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.640]  happen because I'm already being told that I'm part of the whole standoff that
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:13.560]  I was down there hanging out with the militiamen at the wildlife refuge when
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.440]  I was actually granted access once for a tour and then another time we were
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.280]  supposed to have an interview with Amon Bundy and then that got called off
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:24.960]  because he got intel that the FBI didn't tell yeah from the intel yeah
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.760]  look at so talk to Alex he's a fed you know the ADL is saying Alex Jones I mean

[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:21.800]  more thing about the Bundy situation and the ongoing fact that the wildlife
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:28.680]  refugees surrounded with whoever's in there obviously whoever's in there let
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:32.080]  the feds know that the Bundy's who hadn't left in a week had just left the
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.880]  Bundy's had also refused to meet with the FBI last week they told them it was
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:40.360]  their last chance it's been declassified and come out in congressional
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:46.520]  hearings that in the 80s late 80s and in 90s the foundations the Southern
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:51.400]  Probably Law Center others the federal government went out and created militia
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:56.840]  groups to falsely lead them and make them do discredited things and racist
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:02.000]  things to discredit the idea of a militia and then they'd always have the
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.720]  feds who came out to be feds later not just in formats but actual FBI and
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:11.240]  Foundation operatives because they're really in command they would then come
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:19.040]  out and say I was bad I was a fed because I was pointing out that they were
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:23.120]  obviously globalist leading different organizations that were getting media
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:28.520]  coverage to discredit the right wing the patriot movement in America and to make
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:33.600]  the police hate them and to try to make their ideology anti-police so that
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:38.800]  they'd be you know dumb enough to then shut the battle space that way they're
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:44.320]  lining us up for a civil war they've been trying it for a long time and when
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:51.400]  you study these tactics for 25 years like I have 21 years now on air you you
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:56.920]  see it a mile away I mean I saw a Atari militia on YouTube and the media covered
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:01.480]  it and I looked at what they said and what they did and I said that's 100%
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:08.840]  government produced that is professionally done it's meant to look like it
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:13.120]  wasn't professionally done it's like when you see a something supposed to be a
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:16.480]  documentary and you can tell it's fake I mean I'm a filmmaker folks I'm a media
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:21.320]  person and I warned Atari because they were a good organization overall you've
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:25.120]  got people in your organization near the top that are feds you need to do
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:29.160]  something about it I said and then man they ended up setting them up sending
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:34.520]  them to prison or imprisoning them for over a year waiting for trial and the
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:39.780]  judge even said you set them up this was made up the FBI led the group and got
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:42.720]  them to make the statements
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:51.880]  so I tell you a group's infiltrated by feds folks and then it happens and it was
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:57.480]  run by feds for years and then they had the usual operatives in Michigan and
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:05.840]  other areas get up on TV and get up on radio and say Alex Jones is a fed he
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:10.520]  says the militia is unconstitutional and is all run by feds and he says you're a
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:13.680]  fed and you're a fed and you're a fed and tells every well-meaning militia
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:16.880]  person who cares about this country and is getting ready for what's happening
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:21.560]  that I say they're a fed and then they like the emotional camaraderie they
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:26.360]  want to agree you care about me you told me what the big Alex Jones said thank
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.240]  you and then even when it comes out I didn't say a word about them or even
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:36.160]  know who they are they still hate him because he said they were a fed and I've
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.560]  watched it I've even had the feds threaten me before and go you idiot
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:42.760]  you're not gonna be able to ever get those bumpkins to listen to you and you
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:46.840]  know I see him at the gas station when I'm at some you know standoff in East
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:53.160]  Texas and the feds pull up get out laugh at me in my face I had the ATF come up
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:57.120]  and threaten me at the gun show I'm not even selling guns I've had him try to set
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:02.080]  me up I mean it's just been horrible and you can see him a mile away they have a
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.600]  criminal look to them the agents they use for this political stuff against the
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:12.720]  Patriots have been vetted as leftist scum many of them and they really want to
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:17.280]  mount Patriots heads on the wall and so I warn Patriots don't hide out in the
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:23.920]  bushes with people that you think are your buddies all day long and that are
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:27.680]  telling you to do illegal things or telling you to be all paranoid and you
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:34.000]  know playing army a real militia in the info war would be wearing a suit and tie
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.840]  at the city council the legislation would be running for office but also
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:44.000]  doing firearms training and you'd be doing mount training not where Southeast
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:50.440]  Asia camo from Vietnam and then run around in the woods usually led by the
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:57.920]  feds that is the squad leader and it's come out hundreds of times hundreds and
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.240]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times I mean it's almost in fact the
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:04.200]  old joke was on 60 minutes at a show about it about it at a good old boy
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:12.600]  roundup meeting in Alabama put on by the ATF that the joke was at a clan meeting
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:17.320]  or a militia meeting and I'm not saying the two are the same that there would be
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:22.720]  more feds at the meeting than there would be Patriots and the feds would have
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:26.720]  to have secret hand signs so they wouldn't set each other up I mean it's
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:31.080]  that bad folks I've had them no exaggeration probably 30 plus times
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:35.320]  come up to me to book signing a video signing an event go listen I got C4 in
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.720]  my truck out there right now let's go blow up the police station and I go get
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:41.240]  the camera on get the camera on this person's a cop and they run out and
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:45.320]  so they got a cop car you know unmarked fed and they'll go I'll get you later
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:54.120]  Jones we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:56.520]  network
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:02.760]  you hear a lot about the cashless society but Europeans aren't buying it
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:07.360]  according to the European Central Bank a record one trillion euros of banknotes
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:12.440]  were in circulation in 2015 almost double the value 10 years ago paper money

[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:08.760]  contracted with the CIA because there's a good side and a bad side and he blew the
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:13.000]  entire Benghazi situation wide open within months of it happening it's all
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.920]  been validated and you know he knows El Chapo El Chapo of course was in this
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:21.120]  with the CIA his number two guy I got the extra guy to the Chicago a few years
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:24.960]  ago and they had to let him go because he pointed out he was CIA and the judge
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:28.560]  declared national security and said we had to let him go so he can talk about
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:32.160]  the gun running he told us about that three years ago to El Chapo Fast and
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.000]  Furious is to give you classified information on that every time he comes

[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:44.040]  folks this is just like I met with Navy SEALs and their families one Navy SEAL
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:49.200]  and two families a week after Benghazi and they told me all this we broke that
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:54.880]  too that's and that's why Plumlee came on my show this is death defying stuff

[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:16.560]  victims saying she's afraid they're gonna kill her we just need to take the gloves
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:20.920]  off they can't kill us all and if they do kill Plumlee or myself or somebody
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:25.120]  hey that's just the way it is we've gotten in this position because people
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:32.200]  turned into cowards now we're gonna go to toss Plumlee who flew guns to Fidel
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:37.040]  Castro when he worked for Eisenhower and worked you know nose El Chapo and I
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:40.080]  don't know how much he get into today because it's really serious stuff you're

[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:48.320]  stuff and of course you won't hear one word about it in the media till six
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:51.280]  months later and they won't give anybody credit and it's not that we want the
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:56.360]  credit we need it to protect us Fox News takes his info my info you you know
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:59.360]  months later white washes it that puts it out we're gonna go to him in just a
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:03.640]  moment but first paying the bills and getting you high quality products last
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:06.400]  week I started talking about this because everybody in the office discusses
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:13.440]  it athletes top MMA fighters I know you name it they go my gosh I got some of
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.280]  your DNA force and I had numbness in the hands my knee my finger was cut off in a
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:21.400]  boating accident falling off the boat and getting caught they reattached it was
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:25.160]  numb on one side I started taking DNA force when it first came out two and a
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:29.960]  half years ago and it got a buzzing feeling for a few months people kind of
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:33.240]  get freaked out they go whoa where my back hurts it's like electrical now it
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:37.240]  kind of hurts and then feeling came back and the pain went away I mean this
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:40.280]  finger like let's show folks a document cam shot of that I don't want to talk
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:45.680]  plumbly I mean that sucker was you got to show TV viewers that sucker you're all
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:47.600]  here I'll set it right over here it's kind of hard to turn my finger that way
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:53.120]  because that's the side that it cut off on but the point is is that it cut it
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.920]  off there sliced through and then peeled off of skin holding it on the other
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:59.120]  side to cut the finger off right there except for skin on the side so only had
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:02.280]  feeling on this side with the nerves didn't get disconnected no feeling on
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:06.400]  the tip in the front within a couple months of taking and this is what happened
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:11.400]  to me personally it started buzzing electrical hurting and the feeling just
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:16.040]  came back one day just it's back and let me tell you hurt yourself when you
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.760]  don't have feeling in a finger you don't know what you've done with it you
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:22.520]  don't know when you're touching something hot it's great to have the feeling
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:26.320]  back now I'm always so careful because the FDA and all the rest of it I don't
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:30.200]  make claims about any of the products just try them they're amazing five star
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:33.800]  reviews on my top health sites they're unprecedented they're really that good
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:38.240]  this is our best product and I was almost in a weird way ashamed of it because
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.000]  it costs so much but it cost us seventy five to eighty dollars a bottle just to
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.480]  package it you know just to put the bio PQQ in it which is equivalent of 300
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:54.080]  pounds of blueberries it's above vitamin C and you talk about in the winter you
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:58.960]  know for your immune system and stuff this is the hydrogen bomb okay this is a
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:02.640]  nutraceutical similar things to this cell for 300 to 600 dollars you get it by
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:06.640]  prescription from doctors because they want to control it and keep the price
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:12.440]  high and they're trying to control true organic bio PQQ right now so that we
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:15.320]  can't even keep putting it out in the future they've got a fake synthetic type
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:20.440]  that costs 50 bucks a bottle well I know it cost us with the organic 40 35 to 40
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:24.080]  sometimes more to package each bottle just with the one ingredient it's got a
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.880]  bunch of others find out why it's so important
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:31.200]  CoQ Tanner by knows about that there's a hundred and seventy plus studies that we
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:35.160]  are allowed to tell you about because we bought it from Misha Bishi America that
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.440]  actually did the studies hasn't certified and sold as a drug in many
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:43.200]  countries so we are allowed to tell you deep research patented ingredients
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.240]  difficult the source is why we sell out of it a lot it will sell out by next

[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:10.000]  and it's very expensive to run this operation legal is very expensive as you
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.680]  could imagine with the stuff we do and what we break sending our reporters out
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:17.920]  to the ongoing standoff with one dad could it be a new Waco all this stuff
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:21.520]  with it's very expensive so thank you for your support and your prayers now

[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:44.000]  amazing one of the most famous whistleblowers in history and because of
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.440]  the fact that he was found to be correct by Congress three times in three
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:51.680]  different major incidents he kept his job as a major contractor C-130's
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:56.920]  another heavy lifting aircraft flying unit you name it around the world okay
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:01.840]  and he is you know the source of so many Hollywood movies films you name it
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:05.200]  that obviously don't even give the guy credit but he is the before there was
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:09.240]  there American Vietnam he was there he you know Fidel Castro when he worked for
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:15.600]  the CIA in 59 58 he was delivering them the weapons El Chapo fast and furious
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.040]  he knows all about that Benghazi everything he said here three years ago
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:22.760]  go watch the interviews we'll put them on screen for TV viewers read the
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:26.800]  articles it all came out on Benghazi and then Hillary hadn't fallen yet but
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:31.120]  now they're bringing Bernie Sanders the White House saying that you know they
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:35.440]  may actually hit double cross Hillary and she may be indicted Tom DeLay says
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:38.360]  the word from the FBI is that they don't die there within a few weeks we're
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:44.760]  going to Tosh that they are going to bring out the info public now what's
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:48.040]  dangerous is they could start wars they could pull anything with these
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:51.040]  different factions in the government and I've got high-level sources and they
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:54.880]  can't even figure out exactly who's on whose side right now in the factions

[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:17.800]  don't usually do build-ups like this but I didn't do a build-up this big when
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:22.600]  Donald Trump came on but this is a big deal so he's got a whole stack of news
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:26.600]  that's since come out confirming what he told us three years ago two years ago a
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:32.000]  year ago six months ago and now he feels a lot safer to say even more so let's go

[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:52.080]  latest Fast and Furious it's coming out El Chapo Ben Ghazi you've got the floor
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:56.680]  go ahead okay well let me let me make a qualifier here this this call may be
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:01.440]  modified monitored by federal agencies and that's about all I can say about
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:07.120]  that I thank you for having me back on Alex I do appreciate it I hope we can
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:14.280]  I'm winging it as we go I don't take notes but one of the main reasons if you
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:19.440]  remember we talked about Fast and Furious many years ago and made
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:24.840]  allegations that US made weapons international weapons market we're
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:29.320]  shipping arms and ammunition to the Mexican Army through the direct
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:33.880]  commercial sales program to Mexico made the allegation at that point in time
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:40.200]  that Mexico Federal Mexico Army was allowing those guns and ammunition to
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:45.920]  be pilfered and being sent to the cartel what prompted me to get in touch with
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:49.520]  you and come back on your program was to bring up to date about those arms
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:53.640]  shipments from Fast and Furious that went to the Mexican Army that was
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:58.880]  pilfered from the Mexican Army and then went to the Sentinel cartel and that's
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:03.440]  El Chapo who he met last week they found it is hideout a 50 caliber Barrett from
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:09.720]  Fast and Furious right and they also found 40 caliber any aircraft weapons at
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:18.080]  another location that was attributed back to Joaquin or shorty but at that
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:23.400]  point in time we were talking about we lost we lost a Border Patrol agent
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:29.520]  Brian Terry and I know you know about that and the weapons that were
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:36.080]  attributed to his murder have recently been found some of them in the safe
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:41.680]  house there at Guzman that hit the mainstream media news just very briefly
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:46.680]  and has been covered up since that time that's the reason for me coming back on
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:53.360]  the show here to bring attention back to mainstream media drop that like a hot
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:45:00.720]  potato a couple of weeks ago ATF has no comments certain various people have
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:06.360]  made requests for the ATF to produce the serial numbers of those weapons that was
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:11.640]  found in Guzman's hideaway they are to date refused to do that comment from the
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:15.800]  US State Department in reference to the direct commercial sales program that
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:20.360]  allowed those weapons to be shipped to the Mexican Army have no comment at this
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:26.000]  point a series of emails were sent at that point in time I'm talking about
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:32.320]  fast and furious at that point in time to the State Department requesting a
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:39.200]  rundown on the amount of weapons that were shipped through the you know blue
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:45.360]  lantern report and direct commercial sales program shipped to the Mexican Army
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:50.960]  that is now a could be classified as a top-secret committee sensitive
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:54.640]  investigation and just to be clear since you were first on three plus years
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:59.000]  ago it has come out in the Chicago Tribune El Paso times that indeed the
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.480]  number two under El Chapo who was extradited did bring up that he was
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:07.760]  working for the DEA and CIA going back for a decade it was all sanctioned then
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:11.320]  it was a war to take out other cartels that they were being double-crossed so
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:15.920]  that all came out I now I'm going back from memory here but specifically what
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:21.720]  can you say about El Chapo flights into Mexico I mean I think on off record once
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:27.720]  it on record deep you told me you know El Chapo correct I well I know yes I
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:32.720]  okay Carl Quintero also was another person to send a mix in this and not
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:40.360]  Carl Quintero and Joaquin Guzman were associates at Carl's Ranch and Guadalajara
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:46.360]  outside Guadalajara Carl Quintero had a warrant issued for him because of the
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:49.240]  Kiki Camarina murder I'm not going to go into all that kind of stuff because it
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:55.960]  takes up too much time but the lineage is there that yes Joaquin Guzman and his
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:02.560]  family I've been privileged to meet him and talk to him and I just leave it at
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:07.840]  that DEA knows this as a whole complete file on this we had undercover
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:11.640]  operatives working into that operation through the Mexican Army I'm not in
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:16.200]  Mexican Army through the Mexican Marinos and that goes back to Attache 47 it was
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:21.880]  working out in Fort Bliss, Texas that was infiltrated into the arms deal about
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:29.480]  what was going on in guns going across the border into Mexico at that
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:34.320]  particular time now I don't want to get to Ramlin here but my point being is
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:40.600]  that those allegations that the cartel had US-made weapons involved in an
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:45.040]  international gun-running operation that also included guns going to the Middle
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:50.680]  East Libya three four years ago I think those allegations were made and I made
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:55.360]  us a comment that it was a similar operation that's been going on for a
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:59.480]  number of years all the way back before Iran Contra going all the way back to
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:05.800]  Cuba and now it's important because we have the 50 Cal that's Fox News AP but
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:11.600]  then no other coverage from the government to El Chapo who's behind it
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:15.440]  obviously it's connected into the federal government and why are they
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.880]  burning El Chapo now why are they turning on him
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:27.400]  well my my opinion is we're going into an election this information that not
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:32.800]  only from me from many operatives CIA as well as military operatives some of
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:38.880]  them out of Fort Bliss were operating inside Mexico at that point in time and
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:45.840]  also inside the Libya at that period in time they've got to make a diversion
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:50.920]  here and they've got to make an example out of Guzman and others or Carl
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:55.800]  Quinteros and a whole list of them yeah it's like look at the bad man oh my
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:59.200]  gosh he's this horrible drug dealer and meanwhile he's worked for the CIA for 30
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:02.560]  something years and was actually helped consolidate and take out the other drug
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:06.480]  cartels they even make movies like Sakaro basically admitting all of it and
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:10.440]  then the public sits here and we've got a governor coming out saying chop
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:15.120]  people's heads off of guillotines you know that are caught with drugs you know
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:21.320]  what I mean it's a joke it's a sick joke well okay the way it is with our
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:29.880]  mainstream media I called it doctored they they are told what to say what to
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:36.440]  cover how far they can cover it and all that alternative media which I go on
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:40.040]  quite a bit there when I have the opportunity for the sole purpose of
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:43.480]  trying to get the truth about what's going on in those international gun
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:47.440]  running because that ties into Fast and Furious and Libya we're going to break
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:50.120]  in one minute but we'll come back with details I know you just state the facts
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:54.480]  codify what the big new developments are that you're gonna be going over with
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:50:00.080]  Fast and Furious but also Benghazi okay I want to point out real fast that the
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:05.280]  reason is the guns that were found on Joaquin Guzman are military grade weapons
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:10.120]  and some of those weapons traced back to the killing of Agent Brian Terry back
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:16.480]  in 2010 I believe it was those weapons have now shown up in the cartels the
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:21.000]  Zeta or Sonanoa rather cartel they've been showed up now as far as Benghazi
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.560]  the question that I'm trying to bring forward is that those two operations are
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:30.200]  identical we run guns to Mexico international gun running we run guns to
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:35.240]  Benghazi Libya international gun running we run guns to the southern front of
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:40.880]  our end Contra back in the 80s and 90s and the talk plumbly stay there we're
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:44.520]  gonna come right back to you on the other side and and and let you flesh all

[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:23.680]  they control organized crime with it and they corrupt the police and they've
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:27.400]  used it to destabilize the third world you name it now they're destabilizing
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:31.520]  the Middle East they want to stabilize America and do the same thing here and
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:37.040]  they use drug criminalization to do it I'm not for the drug culture but making
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:41.120]  it illegal makes it more dirty makes it larger it's out of control
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:47.440]  decriminalization is the answer and anyone I mean you know you go see now

[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:26.640]  contractor whistleblower with huge developments I remember him on three
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:31.680]  years ago going look at El Chapo Fast and Furious that's where guns went now
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:36.120]  it came out mainstream news wow I mean just everything he's talked about just
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:41.560]  keeps coming out years later amazing we've only had five minutes in this
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:44.240]  segment another five than a 12 minute these are short at the end and start of
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:49.760]  the hour but I want to get back into guns are and fast and furious and and
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:53.640]  politically where this is all going with the factions but separately fast and
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:58.400]  furious so I'm surprised they put out a big official movie and basically admitted
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:01.480]  that it was a stand down but then of course you know why there was a stand
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:07.480]  down what more can you tell us about Benghazi okay back to their other
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:12.720]  segment that we did we've established that guns went across the border to the
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:19.520]  direct commercial sales program US State Department approved to the Mexican army
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:25.360]  and those guns showed up in Joaquin Guzman's home safe house and those guns
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:30.720]  were responsible for killing agent border patrol agent Brian Terry okay point
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:37.600]  two I devised 11 Benghazi questions over three years ago to ask number one the
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:43.140]  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also to ask the Secretary of State John
[01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:49.240]  Kerry to answer those 11 questions those 11 Benghazi questions were sent off to I
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:55.080]  forget how many senators there was over 20 senators and congressman the reason
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:00.600]  the questions were asked was to get these people on record at that time to say
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:07.480]  specifically yes or no simple yes or no to those 11 Benghazi questions
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:12.720]  their investigation that came out of that through other sources I'm talking
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:18.080]  about military sources and CIA sources is that the ambassador had found out
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:24.400]  about Stinger missiles being pilfered out of bunkers in Libya and other areas
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:30.480]  those weapons were sent back to the CIA safe houses Stinger missiles were missing
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:35.200]  the ambassador found out about that operation I've said this three years
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:39.080]  ago found out about that operation I asked the State Department through a
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:45.600]  series of quote emails and other dispatches what he should do about it
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:50.400]  because he had an opportunity through sources in in Libya at that time before
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:54.960]  Gaddafi yeah it's not working well anyway he had that opportunity to buy
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:58:01.600]  back those Stinger missiles he was told quote he was told to stand down on that
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:07.360]  purchase since that time those weapons have been photographed in the back of
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:13.680]  Toyota pickup trucks Stinger missiles hit the caliber machine guns all US made
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:20.020]  weapons that were taken over to Libya and South and the Middle East
[01:58:20.020 --> 01:58:23.260]  Toste there back in 70 seconds again the brakes were at the end and start of the
[01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:26.400]  hour let me just throw out there they're already putting out cover stories too
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:31.800]  but oh ISIS made stingers on their own didn't you read the article and it goes
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:35.400]  oh actually they got old US stingers and they fixed them so they've already got
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:40.440]  the the other story out like evolution that life just came together on its own

[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:55.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:55.720 --> 02:00:16.800]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:24.560]  listening to Alex Jones now think how crazy that is last month and a few
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:28.360]  weeks ago they come up with articles of the independent you name it ISIS has
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:34.280]  stinger missiles from the US but that's buried the article it says they made
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:37.400]  them themselves but then you read the article now that's when you know a
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:42.560]  government agent or minion wrote that it's a cover story it's a talking point
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:45.560]  oh ISIS developed sophisticated new weaponry capable of shooting down
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:50.400]  passenger jets and then they admit it's US stinger missiles they somehow got but
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:55.440]  they fixed the batteries on them oh Tosh I tell you is that not amazing sir
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:59.760]  confirming what you said here over three years ago well yes I believe it is
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:03.600]  amazing and let me apologize for being a little bit nervous here I'm getting into
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:09.360]  what they call some SAP stuff out of fusion centers out of the Pentagon and
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:12.720]  I know this and I'm gonna qualify this and look straight in this camera and say
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:17.640]  okay what I'm talking about is above top-secret Hillary Clinton knows this in
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:22.880]  fact the dispatches and the eb e-mails that have since come out since I first
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:28.440]  mentioned this confirms what I just said so this is SAP stuff whatever you want
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:32.080]  to call it can be above top-secret it's not important how I get my
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:36.480]  information of who sends it to me what I'm attempting to do here is point out
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:41.760]  to the general public and try to get people motivated to hold our elected
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:45.640]  officials accountable for these gun-running operations and you got
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:48.760]  cut off though getting into the chain of events in Benghazi a long segments
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:53.400]  coming up at the next three four minutes go ahead okay so anyway I devise
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:59.120]  those questions to simply get answers from officials state department simple
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:03.480]  yes or no to those questions and I'm not going to go into them all right now
[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:07.600]  they've been posted posted and posted those questions were sent to our
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:12.000]  elected officials they were sent to our congressmen and our senators and the
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.040]  only thing responds that most of the people that sent those out to those
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:18.760]  people the only thing they got back was letters asking for campaign
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:23.920]  contributions point two where does the money go all right I'm not taking pop
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:27.880]  shots at Clinton I'm not taking pop shots at anybody I'm just trying to bring it
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:33.760]  all together establish the record speaking fees millions of dollars
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:41.000]  missiles missing Libya all that kind of stuff where are our investigative
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:48.040]  reporters on mainstream media that will not ask those questions you know so
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:54.120]  anyway please forgive me but sure a humble man you're totally on target the
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:58.440]  point is here's my bigger question why would they want to give thousands of
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:03.880]  missiles hundreds of really high-tech ones we know to Al Qaeda slash ISIS why
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:07.160]  would our own elite do that when they're gonna end up getting the blame for it
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:15.000]  later the whole thing is based on money we need to start wars my opinion we
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.360]  need to start the wars we need to fund both sides of sure but our elites
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:22.760]  really getting crazy when they start giving jihadi stinger missiles they
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:26.760]  think that we are general public has been so desensitized that we don't give
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:30.400]  a crap about what they're doing they are so arrogant up there in Washington DC
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:36.040]  that they're not in touch with the general American citizen so the point
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:41.440]  is bit as this we furnish weapons we start the conflict we furnish the
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:46.800]  weapons to both sides of the conflict and we keep the strategy or keep the
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:52.600]  dissension going we start it we fund it we send the guns we take the money and
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:56.440]  we make them take the money and put it back into campaign contributions are
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:02.360]  into special foundations that's what needs to be investigated that's what
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:07.280]  they are refusing to investigate the three-year record of me going on your
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:11.960]  program and other programs and posting on my Facebook page substantiates those
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:15.600]  charges or allegations of whatever you want by the way it's more than three
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:18.920]  years just right right after men guys even you've been coming on you know

[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:44.640]  now are allowed to come through Turkey into Germany and you say well then
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:47.920]  Merkel will get the blame or Hollande will get the blame when they shoot stuff
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:51.560]  and blow stuff up no they've declared martial law over there and her

[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:41.280]  investigative journalist Kit Daniels is in the control room there we're gonna
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:44.720]  cut to that camera and microphone here in a moment briefly Kit we've got new
[02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:48.880]  developments with some of the folks inside the compound inside the federal
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:53.160]  building we again we had one of them killed the police shot him last night
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:58.120]  out there on the road after shooting at their vehicles a huge escalation the
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:02.480]  feds are out of control it's it's it's really a tragedy but but what's the
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:06.400]  latest developments briefly well the situation is not over yet what we're
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:11.640]  seeing is the preparations for another Waco style siege like even after all
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:15.440]  the rest last night there were still women children and other militiamen
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:19.400]  still in the compound even though a couple of them fled but there's still
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:23.000]  guys that are in the compound they're using excavators to build preparations
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:29.200]  for a siege from the FBI and potentially FATF and today they put out a video from
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:34.400]  the compound saying that that the media has been ordered to leave and that means
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:37.240]  they're coming to kill us they don't want to see that they're going to murder
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:42.320]  all of us the media cowards there they're going to they're basically saying
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:48.320]  that they're preparing to go toe-to-toe with the feds and shoot out you know
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:51.800]  they're going to murder us the media cowards we can put the story back on
[02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:55.520]  screen there we're putting it up on info wars dot com where it shows the
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:59.120]  individual let's scroll back up at the top guys yeah he's pay one of the
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:02.400]  militia guys quote quote yeah here's a headline from raw story berserk
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:07.240]  militant promises bloodbath as feds move in this is a free-for-all Armageddon I
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:11.200]  mean this is just if we warned these guys we absolutely told them this was
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:15.320]  stupid and then the media tries to spin it like we're in support of all this so
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:19.560]  we're sitting reporters to make sure that's on record and not the case anything
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:22.560]  else that I'm going back to my guests yes isn't retort there I mean the police
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:25.720]  have already set up big perimeters roadblocks are only letting ranchers in
[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:29.520]  that live in the area no other traffic allowed searching all vehicles so this
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:33.040]  is definitely something we got to keep going I will stay on it at info wars

[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:14.800]  are for not being a coward and doing the right thing you know for those that
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:18.160]  died there and I think they've jumped the shark on this one the military so
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:21.920]  upset people know what happened there's even Michael Bay movies you know telling
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:26.720]  the truth now but they order a stand down Stevens doesn't go along with it so
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:32.800]  they go in they order a stand down but some other Navy SEAL sheep depth folks
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:38.520]  they go and fight it it goes on for eight hours after that now it's known it's an
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:42.800]  open secret but still those involved those responsible Hillary and others
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:47.760]  Obama are sitting there hoping we all just forget about it where do you see
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:51.240]  all of this going and what are they planning to do when they bring in the
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:55.080]  migrants and they kill and rape and shoot and bomb and then they start shooting
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:59.000]  planes down with stinger missiles they already blew up a Russian plane with a
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:05.560]  bomb I mean it's just how crazier our elite to give stinger missiles to Al
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:11.280]  Qaeda slash ISIS well okay let me let me back up here and I want to thank you for
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:15.160]  bringing that previous clip in about Oregon I've been very familiar with that
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:18.440]  and I've actually been talking to some of those people and counseling with them
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:23.600]  for the last 21 days again thank you Alex for putting that clear what's your
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:27.800]  view on that then since you've been following well my view is it was
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:32.400]  predictable and I've told the people out there that it was predictable I told
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:37.480]  them not to get let their government provoke them to anger to watch what they
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:42.080]  say and be careful how they present their facts to the federal government I
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:48.160]  told them that two weeks ago or three weeks ago that they would be infiltrated
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:52.280]  by government agents but the sole purpose of provoking them to make them
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:57.080]  pull a weapon or threaten a federal agent or threaten a threat and a radical
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:05.000]  that's infiltrated their compound and we're spreading dissension so that
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:09.600]  federal government could use that dissension as a justification to launch
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:13.840]  what is getting ready to be launched against those people now I don't know
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:19.480]  if I've summed that up but summed it up perfectly we've got to stop a new Waco but
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:24.000]  last time it was children this time it's the you know the quote white y'all
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:29.000]  kyda that George Soros wants for his class of civilizations it's just a
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:33.680]  disaster also it's all set up as a diversion to keep our mind away from
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:36.680]  what's going on right now as far as this gun-running situation that's right
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:41.380]  it's diverting us right now from El Chapo caught with guns that big sis and
[02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:46.440]  Obama and and Holder and Hillary sent to him and Benghazi it's working really
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:50.560]  well so good job of the Foundation operatives there in Oregon you help
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:55.360]  screw America over again you trash this is this is a procedure this is an MO
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:59.520]  this happened in Kent State if you remember that's right it's an MO that's
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:03.040]  right it's a method of operation it is one of those things that I talk about
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:09.600]  it's an operation sometimes it it's launched if it works and it's put by
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:14.480]  taking off the book off the shelf put back out in the field after it's been
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:21.040]  tweaked and organized and modified to fit this particular day and age and it's a
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:27.880]  procedure to destroy destroy our freedom ability of freedom but I'm not
[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:31.520]  going to get on the soapbox about about that the point is those people out
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:35.920]  there in a very precarious position you can pretty well predict what's getting
[02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:40.840]  ready to happen again I want to we get back to Benghazi and the questions but
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:44.680]  again I want to thank you for covering that the voice of Idaho the voice of
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:48.960]  Idaho has been covering that Michael is in position out there Becky is
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:52.960]  following up on that there's more information getting ready to break on
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:57.840]  this I don't think the American people are anyone that is listening to this
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:02.400]  broadcast is really aware of what's getting ready to happen this is a planned
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:08.400]  ammo operation against those people a diversion to take our mind away from the
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:11.800]  fast and furious situation that's right they lured the Mondays out there who are
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:14.680]  well-meaning people they've been totally shut up and that's what I'm saying when
[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:18.560]  you're an expert I'm an expert you've been you know inside the government since
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:23.360]  the 50s I've studied it I've been following it for 20 years you see it
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:30.240]  it's totally synthetic it's made up it's scripted it's a disaster and as usual
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:35.760]  the patriot you know grassroots folks walked right into it well that that's
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:40.560]  exactly what it was it was an ambush that fits the MO that I was talking about
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:45.280]  it fits the MO of infiltration into a particular group to spread dissension
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:53.120]  and and to get some of these people some sometimes they mean well but they go to
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:58.200]  extremes they don't present themselves in my opinion properly sure well I mean we
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:05.320]  we specifically have actually dealt with some of the operatives that are heavily
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:08.560]  involved and I just these poor people I won't ever listen to me it's if I work
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:15.120]  camo they would I just you know it's just so sad and maybe next time they'll
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:19.160]  listen Alex some of that stuff wearing camo is actually people that's not
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:23.280]  dispatched by government sources I'm gonna say it out straight out right to
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:28.000]  your camera by government sources to infiltrate that in their camouflage the
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:32.960]  be extremely radical and to rally those people up by a process of illusionary
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:37.920]  warfare training programs well you're so incredible tell them about illusionary
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:42.160]  warfare training well that's what it is it's a it's a modified technique that's
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:46.480]  been used since the 1950s is infiltrate in if you can control the
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:50.320]  communications you could you've won the war or you've won the situation right
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:55.200]  usually the communications person that quote handles all communications for the
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:17:01.720]  group is who you look for we've had Malkin bird that's an old CIA project now
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:07.520]  let me qualify something here on CIA there are people that is infiltrated
[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:14.440]  within the CIA that are CIA that's the sea at some of the CIA do not even know
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:21.520]  it so we have a I'm not talking about rogues other shadow CIA I'm talking
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:26.280]  about a shadow warriors you know not to from the standpoint of a shadow warriors
[02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:29.760]  on organizations and things like that I'm talking about there is a shadow
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:34.160]  government out there that there's working these programs the program is
[02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:38.080]  designed to desensitize us to where we expect exactly what the hell we're
[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:41.920]  getting right let's be clear the big foundations the big leftist foundations
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:49.840]  run but have the national security clearances the clandestine dirty programs
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:53.640]  against the patriots and so a lot of times the local police the FBI even the
[02:17:53.640 --> 02:18:00.000]  CIA don't know it's the foundations that are even above the agencies with their
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:04.520]  action program here in the United States all right let me put it this way to you
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:10.160]  hit it right on the head Alex okay also there's gatekeepers assigned into these
[02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:15.920]  organizations our agencies that prevent good honest people that work for those
[02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:20.720]  agencies from doing their job they're called cleanup people they are assigned
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:27.360]  specifically and to an appointed into positions you know in the Pentagon in the
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:32.880]  CIA and the DOJ for the State Department they are processed anybody that comes
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:38.480]  out and goes against the policy the gatekeepers will make sure that there
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:42.760]  are either careers ruined or they're transferred to another position or there's
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:46.800]  lastly people like Tosh Plumlee and Colonel Shaffer and countless others and
[02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:51.640]  Joe Biggs and you know everybody from Ted Kennedy I mean Tim Kennedy to you
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:56.440]  name it who are patriots who are resisting it and aware now because they're
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:00.760]  decompartmentalized and know the program and that's the historic battle point
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:06.040]  we've gotten to and these foundations better watch it they people are bold
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:10.160]  against you now because because you're not as strong as you used to be go ahead
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:14.040]  I've already been warned not to even be on this program right now I mean you know
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:17.920]  hell that goes with the territory and I'm not you know I don't talk too much
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:20.960]  about that kind of stuff I mean that's what it is that's the reason I'm out
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:25.320]  here going public here's to protect my butt I'm not out here waving a flag and
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:29.080]  all that kind of stuff the point being is that we have gatekeepers that are
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:33.560]  assigned to infiltrate and appointed by by whatever administration it is or
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:41.200]  whatever bureaucratic sure I mean Glenn Beck is an assigned gatekeeper he
[02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:44.600]  admits he's hooked him with the government and he literally takes the
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:48.440]  exact names of our shows and what we do like mystery political science theater
[02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:51.200]  we're doing tomorrow night with the debate and takes the exact name and then
[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:55.840]  says it's his and I took it three years after I made it well CBS poached the
[02:19:55.840 --> 02:19:59.200]  story from Bill Conroy pertaining everything about fast and furious in
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:02.840]  the direct commercial sales program put it out on the wire tweaked it around
[02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:08.600]  contaminated it and put it out as their investigation and there's an article
[02:20:08.600 --> 02:20:13.960]  done by Bill Conroy where CBS poached Bill Conroy's work in reference to the
[02:20:13.960 --> 02:20:17.720]  direct commercial sales program which would have at that point in time which
[02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:22.120]  are you forgot the articles that point in time would have opened up everything
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:27.280]  we're talking about right now so why was it stopped why was it diverted why was
[02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:32.360]  his investigation what happened to Simba what happened to Carl Quintero what
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:36.560]  happened to Goosman he was arrested and a one time and he got out and went back
[02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:41.760]  and now he's arrested again and all this was around at the time the first one
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:45.880]  was around the Mexican elections and then also the fast and furious situation
[02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:50.840]  was also around one of our elections and it was tampered with and it was put on
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:56.760]  ice and like I say not I mean not only one board of Trojan but we have
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:21:02.760]  Sepata and some others that were and there's a whole story there I'm I got week
[02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:06.680]  week golf hours on the background of black operations and how they work and
[02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:10.040]  who is working them and how they come about sure I understand it's all
[02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:13.080]  compartmentalization they keep good people from rising up you know anywhere
[02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:18.760]  above Colonel but but let's expand on that what percentage of people would you
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:23.880]  say dead reckoning in the federal government versus local are awake to
[02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:26.960]  what's going on I know a lot of folks wake up and actually go I better join the
[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:30.840]  dark side I better you know beg to be Darth Vader and then they get screwed
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:35.800]  over so much by the system itself it's just so it's gotten so destructive so
[02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:40.040]  evil so dishonorable they even screw their own people now and studying stuff
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:43.080]  50 years ago they didn't do that as much back then they seem to be getting
[02:21:43.080 --> 02:21:49.440]  nastier but also stupider more aggressive more reckless so so many people in
[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:53.360]  government today are basically more concerned about their pensions and
[02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:57.680]  their careers than they are concerned about getting to the truth of a matter
[02:21:57.680 --> 02:22:03.080]  exposing those that are working for their own private gains exposing campaign
[02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:08.120]  contributions which that is why these questions aren't asked why don't they
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:12.200]  ask the 11 Benghazi questions because if they ask Hillary Clinton and the State
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:17.280]  Department and John Kerry those questions then that will open up a can of
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:21.640]  worms like we've never seen before and it will drift out into every segment of
[02:22:21.640 --> 02:22:25.600]  our government I agree so so is there more of an awakening suddenly happening
[02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:28.000]  because we know government's been rotting is it starting to get a little bit
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:32.040]  better or is it getting worse Alex this has been a coup d'etat and American
[02:22:32.040 --> 02:22:36.640]  people going on for the last 50 years I run guns under Cuba for Fidel Castro at
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:41.240]  the same time we were supporting Batista in other words Castro was fighting
[02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:46.760]  against Batista on our own American tanks our own M1 rifles and anything else
[02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:51.280]  it was high-impact weapons that was given to Batista and at the same time we
[02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:56.440]  were giving Castro arms out of southern Florida that was in 1957 two years
[02:22:56.440 --> 02:22:59.920]  before Castro came into power I was one of the politics that flew the guns in
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:04.320]  there I come all the way up on the same type program tweaked a little bit
[02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:09.680]  modified and put out and came up to be known as the Iran Contra affair I flew
[02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:16.040]  C-130s into Israel with tow missiles on board before the great October
[02:23:16.040 --> 02:23:20.760]  surprise there is a hell of a lineage here but it's blocked it's blocked by
[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:27.000]  gatekeepers I've been labeled as a conspiracy freak I've been able as a
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:31.960]  JFK nut I was I've been a character assassin I mean that's what McCain
[02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:35.120]  says about you because he knows you know you blew all those operations open
[02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:39.680]  inside Congress but they know the public we played a clip of the Democrat
[02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:46.200]  senator from Connecticut saying that military martial law bill is being
[02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:50.000]  passed to let the military president do whatever he wants in America anywhere in
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:54.440]  the world anytime in the ISIS authorization it's unprecedented Ron
[02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:58.080]  Paul calls it the biggest power grab ever he calls it military martial law
[02:23:58.080 --> 02:24:03.560]  worldwide no media will cover it up and they got a troll operation going saying
[02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:08.400]  that's not a real video and the senator didn't say it when it's on C-span and on
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:12.520]  record and you can read the bill I mean they've gone to a new level of disinfo
[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:17.440]  well they'll go out at high noon on a bright blue day and say there's no sun
[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:21.760]  in the sky well that's all part of the program their old Malkinburg program
[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:25.120]  something like that desensitize a situation you want to battle and
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:29.360]  control the communications do the illusionary warfare training set up set
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:33.320]  up all kinds of deals and then put strategic people in position in order to
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:36.760]  to monitor to make sure the people that want to do their job don't get out of
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:40.000]  the line if they get out of line they lose their pensions if they get out of
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:44.840]  line they have charges brought against them if they run for an office then they
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:49.680]  get a character assassinated it's all a question in those days what someone did
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:53.520]  with her PP to determine where they're gonna be a president or not be a
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:57.640]  president oh he did something wrong all of that kind of stuff yeah they always
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:02.960]  go out for sex or a crooked toenail or something because they can't go over any
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:07.560]  real corruption because that sees in everybody else that's right so get him
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:11.000]  back to okay let's get back because we go off in theory here so I can as you
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.160]  know Alex I'm not a conspiracy theorist and you know and I'm not saying you are
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:17.840]  either I mean you're doing a fantastic job as far as I'm concerned I'm trying
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:21.880]  to get factual things out to the American people thank you sir what the
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:24.880]  American people do with the factual things that you bring out and other
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:30.320]  quote whistleblowers bring out we're not responsible for all we can do is be
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:34.600]  journalist and investigator reporters and bring the facts to the American
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:38.680]  people and let those American people decide what they're going to do about it
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:42.720]  sure now happen to be in the day and age now where the American people don't
[02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:46.080]  have time to listen to the whistleblowers they don't have time to get out
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:49.200]  here and study because they're too damn busy making a living and paying the bills
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:54.040]  and paying the freight to keep their family safe so we're we're at we are at
[02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:59.120]  the we are beginning if not already a failed state our political system is in
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:04.560]  shambles we're failing as a country otherwise we have no respect abroad so
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:08.280]  like that now okay now I'm getting on a soapbox I'm gonna come off that soapbox
[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:14.680]  get right back down let's go to Bengasi I ask on your program years ago please
[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:21.280]  come forward with me you operatives out there and come forward and tell your
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:27.880]  story to the American people this was before the movie 13 hours those brave
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:33.720]  men finally did come and had the opportunity and they made a fine movie
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:38.560]  I haven't seen the movie and I doubt if I will see it absolutely and the Navy
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:43.320]  Seals that survived went on Megan Kelly which which shows again they should do
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:47.440]  like Trump didn't come here they need to stop validating Fox to help cover it up
[02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:51.640]  the whole time along with CNN everybody else and I'm not in competition with
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:57.320]  Fox I'm just sick and tired of people thinking the mainstream media still has
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:02.400]  any power where the only power it has now is to basically follow what real
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:06.040]  journalists are putting out and reporting on but now they've come out and
[02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:09.880]  said Hillary's a liar they heard the stand down with their own ears and they
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:14.640]  need to be protected and defended and people need to start getting punished at
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:18.680]  the top of this government or there is no bottom to it and as you said we will
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:23.440]  be a completely failed state like North Korea or Mexico and we are headed that
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:29.360]  way fast Tosh Plumlee thank you so much Facebook.com forward slash Robert

[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:11.720]  secretary one of the things one of the first things they told me was you're
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:15.680]  not even to acknowledge the drone program you're not even to discuss that
[02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:22.080]  it exists it's run by chaos it's run by specter special executive for counter

[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:35.720]  of naive jumps this whole thing's gonna come down on us very much concerns me
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:39.320]  considering that they have all this bulk ammunition that they're shooting
[02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:43.680]  targets of children would you like to tell me who it is that is doing that it

[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:39.800]  new James Bond movie which is approved by my six on record Ian Fleming high
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:46.040]  level MI6 course OSS before that wrote those novels but in the new one the
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:49.840]  quantum group is actually the corporation over specter and the
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:53.920]  character is a George Soros character who tried to crash the British pound of
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:59.200]  course famously I mean he literally is one of the main leaders of specter along
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:03.360]  with Brzezinski and others and and their symbol I've talked to folks that were
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:08.880]  high-level CIA and they said you know the group that runs it all and I was
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:13.600]  told this 20 years ago we call it Hydra and it's a it's a it's a it's a
[02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:19.000]  basically an octopus and then you notice that's what it is with specter I mean
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:24.760]  it's it's real folks it's real and it's just all in your face just like the new
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:27.940]  X files they admit is mainly based on myself and my research material
[02:37:27.940 --> 02:37:32.320]  integrated with a bunch of made-up alien stuff because they just revelation of
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:35.920]  the method they just go oh look it's entertainment and it all becomes a big

[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:19.440]  you're like you're a man of the Lord you're not gonna leave are you Mr. Buddy
[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:24.720]  I'm not it's for the Lord it's you're gonna be persecuted it's gonna be bad but
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:27.640]  you're gonna have to stay no matter what they say all right you're right you're
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:35.080]  right and so they're good men being deceived pray for them I just hope this
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:39.040]  isn't a new way to go I just wish the Patriots would listen to me I've never
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:44.440]  stirred you wrong we've been up and trying to help people I'm in this just
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:51.560]  like you are and there are good people but just you've got to learn how the
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:56.800]  enemy operates we're gonna talk to Joel in a moment editor of World Affairs brief
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:04.000]  dot-com but first DNA force is a true nutraceutical several of the compounds
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:09.560]  like bio PQQ our prescription in many countries we had to go through a medical
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:13.360]  system with a medical doctor to even do the contract three years ago as we buy
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:17.600]  at every few months just one of the ingredients the bio PQQ that is true
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:22.360]  organic not the synthetic that's still 45 50 bucks a bottle it costs us upwards
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:28.400]  of $40 sometimes more just for the bio PQQ that goes in our formulation that we
[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:31.800]  can actually tell you about the 175 clinical studies that are linked at
[02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:35.880]  info wars life.com we can actually tell you what CoQ 10 this particular
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:41.800]  organic type does and the nine other powerful ingredients that synergistically
[02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:48.040]  work with it just try a bottle of it and see what it does for areas where you've
[02:39:48.040 --> 02:39:53.960]  gotten loss of feeling nerve damage cartilage cells mitochondrial problems
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:58.720]  I mean it's just amazing it's it's simply amazing we have a limited amount of it
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:01.440]  but I'm we're gonna sell out of it we put a new order in to get more than four
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:08.800]  or five weeks it is 25% off right now and it's our flagship product we got some
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:13.240]  products are 995 and are super high quality this is normally 139 discounted
[02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:21.520]  it's $97 right now and upwards of $80 of product in each bottle think about that
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:29.240]  just the bio PQQ is 12 to $14,000 a kilo from the Japanese who make it right
[02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:33.600]  here in America it's in Japan they've been obsessed with it for 20 years and
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:36.120]  of course of the longest live people there are for a lot of other reasons the
[02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:43.120]  point is DNA force is hardcore just the bio PQQ has the equivalent vitamin C
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:46.800]  delivery in the body it's different but it's basically the same you read the
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:52.800]  science of 300 pounds of blueberries you can't take you know 20
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:55.960]  capitals of vitamin C like Linus Pauling said not get diarrhea you can't
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:41:04.760]  really overdose on it but it can make you sick bio PQQ one pill 300 pounds of
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:09.040]  blueberries and any I mean it's just it's it's it's wild and this is what the
[02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:13.240]  elite take but you I mean and I remember about five years ago my dad was going to
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:16.820]  medical doctors he was going to people he'd done some stuff at the Pentagon
[02:41:16.820 --> 02:41:20.320]  trying to get things fast-tracked nutraceuticals separately from working
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:24.040]  with me now and he said this is what you need to do because he goes they're gonna
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:28.200]  try to ban this here in the US and he goes you know or make a prescription he
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:32.680]  goes this is $300 to $600 for something so we made our own formula and believe
[02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:36.400]  me it's got the industry actually upset because people go to medical doctors
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:40.880]  that pay 300 bucks for something like this and ours is better so info wars
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:45.320]  life calm and we are discounting that massively right now because it's a
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:49.040]  major loss leader and we've got free shipping on orders were $50 that helps
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:53.880]  fund our operation and we just you know thank God for all the blessings of being
[02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:56.720]  able to develop such amazing products and be able to fund our operation to be
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:05.000]  independent all right going now to Joel Scalzen a former Marine Corps officer of
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:10.360]  naval aviator from Vietnam era of course best-selling author researcher one of
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:14.200]  the preeminent experts in the world on secure homes on strategic relocation I
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:18.160]  made a film with him and he has a big book available info wars store.com that
[02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:23.560]  breaks all that down and of course his uncle was Cleon Scalzen who wrote the
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:27.040]  naked communists and started a lot of the libertarian constitutional movement you
[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:32.320]  see by understanding my ultra-rich were funding communism and so he joins us now
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:36.680]  I don't like saying see I told you so I got a sick feeling when I got a call
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:40.920]  last night from Joe Biggs at about 7 38 o'clock that they had just shot and
[02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:44.200]  killed one of them and we're calling it a shootout I had a suspicion it wasn't a
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:47.400]  shootout the media around the headlines of the shootout even today Oregon
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:51.240]  standoff militiamen killed and now we can put up the new headlines with
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:55.960]  militiamen on video cameras with guns screaming angrily you know it's a blood
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:43:01.120]  bath of Armageddon we're gonna get you I mean do you couldn't script it worse to
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:05.880]  to to start a civil war to start a war on patriots Obama rolling out against the
[02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:10.600]  guns I mean if Obama praises little pillow at night this is what he's praying
[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:14.560]  for and if this is successful they'll then have attacks on federal buildings
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:19.720]  provocateur or staged to really go to the next phase of oppression that's my
[02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:23.560]  view we'll see what Joel Scalzen says he had a great plan for him to leave the
[02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:27.600]  sheriff pretty much took our plan that we sussed out and came to them two days
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:33.400]  later and said this is what you should do and then that all changed so this is
[02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:38.200]  now a disaster Joel Scalzen do you concur what I'm saying what can you add to
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:44.720]  it what you warned I was now unfolding well it certainly has Alex I predicted
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:48.440]  that this wouldn't end well and would end in you know a federal shootout what
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:53.440]  is interesting to me though is how the feds allowed them I think they lured
[02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:58.640]  them out of the refuge or you know Bundy and his group may have showed up at the
[02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:03.200]  community meeting last week unannounced and may have cut the feds off by
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:07.480]  surprise but you know to to be in a standoff situation though there was no
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:11.320]  direct armed confrontation they were still armed and they were you know
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:16.280]  claiming to defend that refuge and then to to drive out of there and expect not
[02:44:16.280 --> 02:44:20.520]  to be arrested was kind of interesting the fact that they got away with at the
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:25.160]  first time allowed them to take on this meeting in John Day with this other
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:31.120]  public meeting and to address their cause and obviously the feds had set them up
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:35.880]  so that they ambushed them on the way out there they pulled them over as you've
[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:41.480]  reported you know in a car and what is really interesting is the fact that it
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:46.400]  was clear that they intended to shoot these people because rather than you know
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:49.960]  surround them I mean they had their hands out the car and they shot at them
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:53.560]  with their hands out the car and that's why they took off the second time for
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:59.080]  the first time and tried to evade the shooting end up crashing and then with
[02:44:59.080 --> 02:45:03.800]  hands out of the car they were being shot out again so you know Finnecombe who's
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:09.840]  a very mild mannered grandfatherly type well-spoken Mormon he's a good
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:15.120]  religious man it's a shame that he's the one that got shot I mean this guy was
[02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:19.840]  taking the higher ground he you know there's conflict reports about what
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:23.640]  happened when he got out of the car but clearly he was not armed his hands were
[02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:27.600]  in the air and it's true that he may have been fed up you know one of the
[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:31.520]  witnesses and talking to Bundy's bodyguard said that he rushed the
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:35.080]  officers but I don't think that's really what happened what I think was in his
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:38.080]  anger saying look if you're gonna kill me then go ahead and shoot and he was you
[02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:42.360]  know walking forward to them basically bearing his chest to them with his hands
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:47.720]  but there's no justification for the police the FBI or whoever it was to
[02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:50.760]  shoot him in the head when his hands are near I don't care if you're walking
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:55.920]  towards them or absolutely so it's going towards murder leaning towards the
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:46:00.000]  fact that the feds have decided to try to provocateur something because they were
[02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:06.280]  able successfully because of plants I think Joel to demonize the land rights
[02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:11.240]  movement there well it's clear that they they didn't want to wake oh in the
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:17.040]  sense of a siege they could have besieged that refuge weeks earlier they
[02:46:17.040 --> 02:46:20.400]  could have caught off all contact and they could have cut off any food supplies
[02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:25.560]  but they didn't I think what they really wanted to do is to portray that this was
[02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:30.680]  a shootout with the militia which it was not a shootout in there was no guns
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:35.280]  fired from the car whatsoever there was no guns raised to defend themselves
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:39.960]  only hands out the window and what's interesting here is that there are now
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:44.920]  six witnesses to this murder and although there are going to be defendants
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:49.720]  in their own trials and things we have six credible witnesses you know that he
[02:46:49.720 --> 02:46:53.720]  was shot with his hands up the governor should order the state police to
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:57.160]  release their squad car videos I don't expect the feds to but if they don't
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:02.000]  instantly release these it shows the six witnesses are telling the truth do you
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:05.440]  think it's a mishap by the whoever shot him or do you think this is part of a
[02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:11.080]  larger plan this is part of a larger plan they had to go in there trigger happy
[02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:15.800]  wanting to take these people down and they did so in fact the fact that they
[02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:19.760]  peppered this car with bullets with people's hands up where they had to
[02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:24.320]  grasp run and find some kind of white flag I mean one way they might have been
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:29.360]  planning to kill them all and set them up in a shootout you know clearly when
[02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:33.440]  you when you shoot that many bullets into a car you're intending to kill
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:37.520]  everybody in the car and that's simply unwarranted I don't care if there's
[02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:41.480]  weapons in the car the point is I totally agree Joel you're a smart guy and
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:45.160]  that's why we've got you here what do you think the big picture is you agree
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:49.080]  that they walked into a trap what do we do now to get those people inside the
[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:52.000]  refuge out who are running around saying they're gonna fight to the end I
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:56.360]  mean this is deteriorating quickly do you agree absolutely and it's foolish to
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:48:00.640]  fight to the end I mean clearly they need to diffuse this situation as we
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:04.440]  have encouraged them to do from the very beginning and live to fight another
[02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:08.880]  day and what does it say is you need to you figure out another Hammond someone
[02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:12.840]  who's being oppressed by the BL who's got a clear case like the Bundy's had on
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:16.840]  their ranch in Nevada shouldn't they just leave now and go directly unarmed the
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:19.960]  police department get out and lay on the ground because I think if they've gone
[02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:23.080]  this far they may kill more people that come out if they catch them out on the
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:27.560]  road somewhere well I only disagree in the sense that I don't think that the
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:31.600]  feds want to create another week Waco there they've already got a murder
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:35.400]  charge being aired about in the internet which is enlivening these things and
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:39.480]  that may well have been why they shot one to see if they can't throw the
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:46.120]  militia movement into a you know an armed conflict with the nation I don't
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:49.520]  think it's gonna go to civil war I don't think it's gonna I agree I agree I'm
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:53.360]  gonna go to civil war but it creates the narrative for the background for in the
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:59.240]  future to persecute the Patriots yes it certainly does and it makes it any it
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:04.160]  makes it almost impossible now to do an Amon Bundy style standoff even in
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:07.800]  defense of someone like the Hammond's when you go in armed anything now
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:11.720]  everyone's going to be primed to say yeah take them down put the feds in
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:15.800]  they're gonna have to cover up this murder though and I think they will I
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:20.520]  think they'll sequester the dash cam videos if there were any there they
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:24.680]  won't allow them to be shown they'll be sealed in court testimony it will be
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:28.480]  their word against mine and I'll predict they're gonna let the federal
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:33.720]  authorities off scot-free this will enliven the movement and enrage it but
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:40.680]  I clearly don't think because Bundy lost the high ground by staying too long and
[02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:45.440]  it ended up poorly it's going to in live in a certain portion of the movement
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:49.040]  but I was afraid that there were some agent provocateurs there within the
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:54.680]  refuge they seem to know everywhere about about their plan movements to set
[02:49:54.680 --> 02:49:58.440]  up this trap going to John Day in fact the meeting may have been organized in
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:03.480]  order to lure them out again Joe Scow is an editor of world affairs briefs comms
[02:50:03.480 --> 02:50:08.120]  our guest I'm Alex Jones we just joined us the whole thanks thanks to high
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:12.760]  heaven Joe and you look at what else is happening in the world I want to come
[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:16.000]  back from break and talk a little bit more about this but also want to get
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:20.600]  into this new war powers authorization just briefly going to break I mean you
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:27.320]  know is senators calling it worldwide declaration of military martial law yeah
[02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:32.720]  it's very very serious I'm not sure it's gonna become law but it's it's
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:36.760]  definitely dangerous as it's written absolutely I mean it's got the Senate
[02:50:36.760 --> 02:50:41.280]  majority leader miss McConnell pushing and it's got a bunch of co-sponsors it
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:47.160]  just shows the season we're in of rampant power grabbing also when I asked
[02:50:47.160 --> 02:50:50.240]  Joe Scows and we're gonna have some bam bam bam quick questions about Hillary
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:54.400]  Clinton rush one boss coming out saying you know she might kill Bernie Sanders
[02:50:54.400 --> 02:50:57.080]  you've got all these other people coming out against her I mean they're there
[02:50:57.080 --> 02:51:00.520]  are they about to get rid of her the following statements have not been

[02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:05.440]  flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country it caught
[02:53:05.440 --> 02:53:10.460]  me totally by surprise and it involves FEMA I couldn't believe FEMA tried this
[02:53:10.460 --> 02:53:14.600]  until I saw proof revealing their secret could land me in hot water but I
[02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:19.320]  think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing watch the viral video at

[02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:29.960]  because the fact is they must know something we don't go to fema 3.com

[02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:09.640]  I was a highway man along the coach roads I did ride you can't make this up
[02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:14.040]  the new place correct the stories up on the floor calm and come out and said
[02:54:14.040 --> 02:54:18.720]  Martin Luther King wasn't inclusive enough he was wasn't politically correct
[02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:25.160]  enough we've also got Sweden in places saying they're gonna charge people with
[02:54:25.160 --> 02:54:30.160]  what is it sedition if they criticize radical Muslims they're gonna take our
[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:34.640]  rights away in the name of you know making them feel at home and covering up
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:42.240]  statues in Rome when the Iranian religious dictator shows up it's just
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:46.560]  crazy and then we have all this political jockeying going along Bernie
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:50.200]  Sanders being invited to the White House they get ready to slip him in I
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:55.320]  thought it'd be Biden if they indict Hillary I'm really seeing big guns come
[02:54:55.320 --> 02:54:59.720]  out and say bold things as if the handcuffs have been taken off with
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:04.040]  Hillary now she's got a lot of you know those with the skeletons are buried but
[02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:10.120]  the word is she's not too healthy so maybe the wolves smell blood geopolitically
[02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:15.040]  Joel Scowles in a world affairs brief the editor what are we facing right now
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:19.880]  just as a gestalt with Hillary election Trump saying you won't be in the
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:25.000]  debate things like that well I think Trump first of all made a very wise
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:28.920]  strategic move by evading the debate it wasn't really the Megan Kelly thing that
[02:55:28.920 --> 02:55:34.080]  he was evading it was the Muslim trap that they had set up they had two or
[02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:40.800]  three you know immigrants one Muslim one Hispanic ready and primed to ask him in
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:45.760]  various questions to try to focus on that issue and they were setting up a
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:49.080]  major trap for him so now everybody will talk about him instead he'll end up
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:53.000]  getting more viewers than the debate going everywhere else absolutely he's
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:56.680]  gonna it's always a win-win situation Trump's actually showing quite a bit of
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:01.400]  political finesse despite the way he speaks I'm surprised that he is able to
[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:07.680]  keep them churning and well he does dumb down his speech I mean he's super smart
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:12.240]  I mean he's doing that to be more populist it's a it's surprising yeah he
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:16.160]  did make a major error I thought when he talked about yeah I can deal with
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:20.000]  Pelosi I can deal with the Schumer I can deal with McComble all these people no
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:24.240]  problem at all that's really not the kind of message that conservatives say that
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:28.480]  that means he's being establishment yeah now I don't think he is controlled by
[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:32.160]  the establishment I mean he just simply can't stick to a script nobody who's
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:36.520]  controlled would act that way but nevertheless it's very clear when they
[02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:42.520]  trot out Ben Sasse the very popular senator from Nebraska now to take on
[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:47.440]  the anti-Trump movement he's going from campaign to campaign in Iowa talking
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:53.520]  down Trump and even the Washington Post is talking about perhaps running him as
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:57.760]  a dark horse I think the establishment is desperately looking for someone to
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:02.480]  come up and take over the lead from Trump if they can destabilize or at least
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:07.800]  neutralize most of the other candidates so you know Jeff Renz has been touting
[02:57:07.800 --> 02:57:12.680]  Ben Sasse for a long time I'm particularly not enthused anybody who
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:17.120]  comes out and becomes an attack dog and takes the place of Dick Cheney at a
[02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:22.600]  major GOP meeting in New Hampshire isn't somebody who I can trust as a
[02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:26.120]  conservative sure the editor of the Financial Times of London Bilderberg
[02:57:26.120 --> 02:57:31.080]  group member at Davos says the quote global super elite must stop Donald
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:35.480]  Trump at all cost and they're all doubling down with money against him and
[02:57:35.480 --> 02:57:39.120]  the word is Trump is really learning about the New World Order conspiracy
[02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:42.600]  everything else little birdies told me that Joel I mean he's got to really
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:49.800]  watch it if he's for real yeah he really does but so far the big story now is
[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:54.120]  what to do with Hillary now you know I realized that you had on a guest who
[02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:59.840]  said that Hillary's gonna threaten to I guess it was Larry Larry Nichols Larry
[02:57:59.840 --> 02:58:03.640]  Nichols yeah who you know worked for the Clintons he knows the Clintons will
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:07.360]  have but I don't think he understands really the globalist agenda because if
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:12.200]  he thinks that that anybody even Hillary Clinton can go and threaten those people
[02:58:12.200 --> 02:58:16.840]  with all the deep dark secrets and stay alive I think he's kidding himself he
[02:58:16.840 --> 02:58:20.080]  doesn't understand the ruthlessness stay there we got to go to break 70
[02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:24.520]  seconds I think what he's saying is intramural in the governing minion class
[02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:29.560]  this is a fight but it's like you know the A team against the B team but but
[02:58:29.560 --> 02:58:33.400]  come back for five minutes give us your take then Jakari Jackson's hosting the
[02:58:33.400 --> 02:58:37.960]  fourth hour because David Knight is deploying to Oregon and the new Waco
[02:58:37.960 --> 02:58:41.680]  that could be developing we hope that's not the case and I'll get more of Joel's
[02:58:41.680 --> 02:58:45.360]  take on angles he thinks we ought to report on from there because this is
[02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:49.160]  really a mess I just want to get those people out of there when cells become
[02:58:49.160 --> 02:58:54.040]  toxic they die early and aging sets in no one has put together a formula that

[03:00:21.520 --> 03:00:27.720]  network good is marching against evil but evil is multiplying and taking over
[03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:34.600]  the world but that's all part of the test and part of this life I admire the
[03:00:34.600 --> 03:00:38.520]  Levoix gentleman that went out there he was one of the better people after the
[03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:44.240]  bundies are good too they just aren't sophisticated when it comes to psyops and
[03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:48.320]  even Tosh Plumlee telling him exactly what they're being shut up what's
[03:00:48.320 --> 03:00:51.840]  happening 21 days ago he was on the phone with him he talks to them they just
[03:00:51.840 --> 03:00:55.640]  won't even listen to him I don't want to go back into that I just am so sick of
[03:00:55.640 --> 03:00:59.880]  it I mean we know how to beat the globalist if people just would not be
[03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:03.760]  suckered into things and nobody's perfect but excuse me I'm digressing
[03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:06.800]  getting back to Hillary Clinton Joel Scowze and getting back to what's
[03:01:06.800 --> 03:01:12.560]  happening geopolitically and and with what's going on with Trump I mean
[03:01:12.560 --> 03:01:16.600]  they're they're just combining forces against him and I just can't believe
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:21.240]  that that Donald Trump really is anti-establishment really is waking up
[03:01:21.240 --> 03:01:26.520]  to what's happening really is understanding what's going on and a lot
[03:01:26.520 --> 03:01:29.840]  of it's because one of his top campaign people shadow campaign people but
[03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:34.840]  really one of the head people stone it is a big long-time listener and in you
[03:01:34.840 --> 03:01:37.560]  know JFK writer but also has been involved a bunch of clandestine
[03:01:37.560 --> 03:01:41.000]  operations obviously it's I think it's people in the system even you could say
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:44.760]  from dark side that are getting behind Trump because they see where this is
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:48.120]  going I mean there's a lot of people that have had their their butts on the
[03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:52.520]  fence is what I'm saying and I see a lot of people in the system now realizing
[03:01:52.520 --> 03:01:57.600]  this new world order is bad news well it's true let me give you a review though
[03:01:57.600 --> 03:02:00.560]  of my big picture view of what they're trying to do with this election and how
[03:02:00.560 --> 03:02:05.160]  it's going to ride first of all they didn't really set Hillary Clinton up
[03:02:05.160 --> 03:02:09.240]  to win the election they wanted to give us a control Republican Donald Trump's
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:13.640]  stymied that he is continuing to do so no matter how much they try to take him
[03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:18.080]  down the establishment people except for Rubio just aren't making the grade and
[03:02:18.080 --> 03:02:23.120]  just aren't rising at all and so now what they're looking at is alright if
[03:02:23.120 --> 03:02:26.840]  Trump does get the nomination despite all our efforts despite a controlled
[03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:32.160]  convention if we can't stop Trump we're gonna have to win with a Democrat then
[03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:37.560]  and Hillary is really seriously flawed and so they're now debating how do we
[03:02:37.560 --> 03:02:43.200]  dump Hillary you know and still keeper in the in the ballpark do we ride do we
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:47.760]  let Sanders take on Trump I don't think Sanders could beat Trump do we let
[03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:52.320]  Biden come in I don't think Biden could beat Trump so they've got a real problem
[03:02:52.320 --> 03:02:56.880]  so this is one of the biggest political crises for the Pratt house boys since
[03:02:56.880 --> 03:03:01.360]  they took the country over in 1913 absolutely they have never come up
[03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:06.080]  against this since Mitt Romney Mitt Romney was a self-interred candidate that
[03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:10.120]  they had to defeat by eliminating some 10 million votes at the final election
[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:13.680]  count in order to threaten him not to run because he could have probably won this
[03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:20.400]  time that's right he could have there were some threats very subtle things but
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:23.800]  you know you don't have to threaten very hard with someone I meet Romney who's
[03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:27.040]  bending over backwards to please the establishment it takes some very mild
[03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:31.400]  things you don't want to go there but clearly he's not coming in that's why I
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:35.560]  say watch out there's establishment isn't ready yet to stop throwing in more
[03:03:35.560 --> 03:03:39.960]  dark horses to compete against Trump that's why I'm warning about Ben Sasse
[03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:44.320]  as a as the latest dark horse but this is clearly got the establishment people
[03:03:44.320 --> 03:03:48.200]  and in a real difficulty they're holding meetings night and day about Trump is
[03:03:48.200 --> 03:03:51.240]  ultra smart I mean he knows that there's a good chance they're gonna kill him I
[03:03:51.240 --> 03:03:56.560]  mean he's got to know that well they can't do that obviously you know I just
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:03:59.880]  don't think that's on the table right now it might be if he got elected they'd
[03:03:59.880 --> 03:04:04.400]  run an assassination they shot Reagan that's right exactly and they will do
[03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:08.400]  that to keep their agenda if he gets elected but they still aren't out of
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:11.960]  ammunition yet you watch for this manipulation as we go down through the
[03:04:11.960 --> 03:04:19.240]  primary system could Donald Trump if he got elected be the next Ronald Reagan I
[03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:24.200]  don't think so frankly because Ronald Reagan was an ideological conservative
[03:04:24.200 --> 03:04:27.600]  he did his own writing he did his own speech writing he had written things
[03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:31.480]  conservatively clear back before he was governor of California Donald Trump

[03:18:21.200 --> 03:18:24.960]  of my father was 14 whatever this is the best I think it's 14 because the type
[03:18:24.960 --> 03:18:30.400]  of this is the best quality and formulation available worldwide DNA force
[03:18:30.400 --> 03:18:34.540]  well no actually the batch has two kilos in it so I guess that's right sorry the

[03:24:10.600 --> 03:24:14.600]  Mcadoo now we have a bit of a programming note for you guys you guys have
[03:24:14.600 --> 03:24:18.080]  probably heard the commercial we've been running we have some breaking news that
[03:24:18.080 --> 03:24:23.000]  has switched the way things are going to run for the next couple of days we were
[03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:26.360]  advertising that the debate coverage is going to be tomorrow night which will
[03:24:26.360 --> 03:24:29.960]  continue but originally we said David Knight and Joe Biggs we're going to be
[03:24:29.960 --> 03:24:34.120]  here in studio they're actually going to Oregon so it'll be myself Leanne as well
[03:24:34.120 --> 03:24:38.180]  as the remaining crew here in the info wars.com studio and Joe Biggs and
[03:24:38.180 --> 03:24:41.880]  David Knight will be up in Oregon for that but now let's talk about the debate
[03:24:41.880 --> 03:24:45.440]  coverage have Leanne here in studio and one the person or one of the people who
[03:24:45.440 --> 03:24:48.920]  said that they're not going to be at this debate is Donald Trump and we
[03:24:48.920 --> 03:24:51.920]  actually have a clip from Mr. Trump we could pull this up where he's talking
[03:24:51.920 --> 03:24:56.680]  about his relationship with Fox News or he does not trust Fox News and in
[03:24:56.680 --> 03:25:01.840]  particular Megyn Kelly. I didn't like the fact that they sent out press releases
[03:25:01.840 --> 03:25:06.080]  toying talking about Putin and playing games I don't know what games Roger
[03:25:06.080 --> 03:25:10.720]  Ailes is playing but what's what's wrong over there something's wrong but when
[03:25:10.720 --> 03:25:14.240]  they sent out that press release talking about I said what are these people
[03:25:14.240 --> 03:25:19.200]  playing games so most likely I won't be doing the debate we'll have our own event
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:23.200]  we'll raise some money for the wounded warriors we'll raise money for the vets
[03:25:23.200 --> 03:25:26.600]  but when they sent out the wise guy press releases a little while ago I was
[03:25:26.600 --> 03:25:30.920]  all set to do the debate I came here to do the debate. Megyn Kelly is a light
[03:25:30.920 --> 03:25:34.800]  weight this is a light weight this is not a reporter this to me is just a
[03:25:34.800 --> 03:25:39.520]  lightweight. Megyn Kelly shouldn't be in the debate I don't care about Megyn
[03:25:39.520 --> 03:25:44.280]  when Megyn Kelly didn't ask me a question she made a statement last time I
[03:25:44.280 --> 03:25:48.560]  thought it was inappropriate everybody said I won the debate everybody said I
[03:25:48.560 --> 03:25:52.600]  won the last debate they said I won all of the debates we've had six debates now
[03:25:52.600 --> 03:25:58.400]  why should the networks continue getting rich on these debates. Alright and there
[03:25:58.400 --> 03:26:01.760]  you have it right there Leanne saying that he's not a big fan of the way the
[03:26:01.760 --> 03:26:05.480]  debates are being handled and you know I guess you could say that about any
[03:26:05.480 --> 03:26:09.280]  network we've seen the other debates on other channels where they definitely just
[03:26:09.280 --> 03:26:11.840]  straight up attacked the guys they're asking about fantasy football and all
[03:26:11.840 --> 03:26:15.200]  types of other stupidness but what do you think about this most recent deal
[03:26:15.200 --> 03:26:18.320]  with Trump saying he just doesn't want to participate. Well and of course they
[03:26:18.320 --> 03:26:22.480]  throw softballs to Hillary Clinton Obama says he really likes you what do you
[03:26:22.480 --> 03:26:26.600]  think about that Hillary you know so it's it's completely biased and he's not
[03:26:26.600 --> 03:26:31.240]  wrong but we saw what happened with Rand Paul last time when he skipped the
[03:26:31.240 --> 03:26:34.800]  debate he was the top trending thing on Twitter and he wasn't even there so I
[03:26:34.800 --> 03:26:39.440]  think this was if he does in fact decide that he's not gonna show up I think this
[03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:44.680]  is a smart move by him but let's all kind of take a step back here and look at
[03:26:44.680 --> 03:26:49.960]  what's going on behind the scene now we reported on this yesterday about an
[03:26:49.960 --> 03:26:54.280]  insider who said it doesn't matter about Trump Hillary will win now the reason
[03:26:54.280 --> 03:26:58.600]  why this is important is because this came from Martin Sorrell he's a highly
[03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:04.580]  influential CEO he has ties to Fox News he's the chief executive officer of WPP
[03:27:04.580 --> 03:27:09.720]  PLC they've so they have ties to Fox News but their affiliates represent up to
[03:27:09.720 --> 03:27:15.960]  half of all Fox News ad revenue clients include Ford Glaxo Smith IBM Microsoft
[03:27:15.960 --> 03:27:19.160]  Nestle Walmart Unilever so these are all people who spend millions of dollars
[03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:23.280]  yes every single month on Fox News advertising so for him to come out and
[03:27:23.280 --> 03:27:28.320]  say this but that's not it we've also got another top Builderberger who is the
[03:27:28.320 --> 03:27:33.160]  associate editor of the Financial Times Martin Wolf insisting that the global
[03:27:33.160 --> 03:27:37.720]  super elite must stop Donald Trump from winning the presidency he wrote this
[03:27:37.720 --> 03:27:42.520]  article called the economic losers are in revolt against the elites and he's
[03:27:42.520 --> 03:27:46.880]  basically telling his rich friends that we must stop Trump so unless this is
[03:27:46.880 --> 03:27:50.160]  like some ultimate reverse psychology because you know Trump himself is a
[03:27:50.160 --> 03:27:55.000]  billionaire they're really afraid of him yeah let me be very clear I'm not on
[03:27:55.000 --> 03:27:59.080]  team Trump but I do think it's rather interesting how they continue to target
[03:27:59.080 --> 03:28:02.920]  this guy because they don't control him you know and so that's the big deal he's
[03:28:02.920 --> 03:28:05.920]  not an establishment guy they can't control them they can't hold his lease
[03:28:05.920 --> 03:28:09.880]  show they don't know exactly what he's going to do if he was to get into office
[03:28:09.880 --> 03:28:14.160]  now on that we also have another Trump clip when he's talking about how how much
[03:28:14.160 --> 03:28:17.520]  support he has and how he could actually just walk up and shoot somebody in the
[03:28:17.520 --> 03:28:22.360]  head and he still wouldn't lose any supporters it's a very bold statement but
[03:28:22.360 --> 03:28:26.440]  you know it he seems to in some people's eyes to be able to do no wrong you know
[03:28:26.440 --> 03:28:30.080]  even if it's a controversial statement or some a lot of times they take stuff out
[03:28:30.080 --> 03:28:32.760]  of context that he does say I will give him that sometimes they just completely
[03:28:32.760 --> 03:28:36.720]  twist his words but for the stuff he has said that people didn't like I just
[03:28:36.720 --> 03:28:40.000]  doesn't seem to knock him down let's go ahead and say see Donald Trump saying
[03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:44.360]  that he could shoot somebody and still get away with it my people are so smart
[03:28:44.360 --> 03:28:48.080]  and you know what else they say about my people the pulse they say I have the most
[03:28:48.080 --> 03:28:51.480]  loyal people did you ever see that where I could stand in the middle of Fifth
[03:28:51.480 --> 03:28:54.920]  Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters okay it's like
[03:28:54.920 --> 03:29:01.280]  incredible Trump will have YouTube man Trump's voters are by far you know the
[03:29:01.280 --> 03:29:08.960]  I'm at 68 69 percent I'm at 90 percent total like yeah yeah definitely has a
[03:29:08.960 --> 03:29:12.320]  very passionate group of supporters and I believe Richard Reese is also going to
[03:29:12.320 --> 03:29:15.800]  be on the ground out there on our debate coverage you guys can tune in and
[03:29:15.800 --> 03:29:20.240]  watch that as well but it's not just the Republicans in the race Liam we also

[03:29:54.000 --> 03:29:57.000]  network
[03:29:58.200 --> 03:30:02.640]  you hear a lot about the cashless society but Europeans aren't buying it
[03:30:02.640 --> 03:30:07.240]  according to the European Central Bank a record one trillion euros of banknotes
[03:30:07.240 --> 03:30:12.320]  were in circulation in 2015 almost double the value 10 years ago paper money
[03:30:12.320 --> 03:30:16.880]  in circulation rose six and a half percent last year the most since 2008
[03:30:16.880 --> 03:30:21.680]  2008 people were worried about financial turbulence and crashing markets then
[03:30:21.680 --> 03:30:26.040]  with good reason and this year has begun with the worst two-week start on record
[03:30:26.040 --> 03:30:31.160]  for financial markets but in 2015 we now have negative interest rates on bank
[03:30:31.160 --> 03:30:35.600]  accounts and the risk of flat-out confiscation of accounts by government
[03:30:35.600 --> 03:30:43.240]  what they call haircuts and then there's privacy cashless no thanks

[03:33:23.680 --> 03:33:28.280]  now that the Bill of Rights have been largely destroyed by our corporatized
[03:33:28.280 --> 03:33:32.760]  government president Obama has decided to go for the meat of the American
[03:33:32.760 --> 03:33:39.040]  Constitution the war powers of the Constitution article 1 section 8 clause
[03:33:39.040 --> 03:33:45.520]  11 of the United States Constitution sometimes referred to as the war powers
[03:33:45.520 --> 03:33:54.920]  clause vests in the Congress the power to declare war this resolution is a total
[03:33:54.920 --> 03:34:00.200]  rewrite of the war powers clause of the United States Constitution let's be
[03:34:00.200 --> 03:34:06.640]  clear about that it is essentially a declaration of international martial law
[03:34:06.640 --> 03:34:13.480]  a sweeping transfer of military power to the president that will allow him or her
[03:34:13.480 --> 03:34:20.360]  to send us troops almost anywhere in the world for almost any reason with
[03:34:20.360 --> 03:34:26.400]  absolutely no limitations so while the east coast was buried under record
[03:34:26.400 --> 03:34:31.360]  snowfall Obama's full Republican minions Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell
[03:34:31.360 --> 03:34:36.120]  scuttled another dangerous fast-tracked bill into the halls of the most
[03:34:36.120 --> 03:34:41.680]  hated Congress in US history the legislation makes the unconstitutional
[03:34:41.680 --> 03:34:46.840]  Iraq war authorization of 2002 look like a walk in the park it will allow this
[03:34:46.840 --> 03:34:51.520]  president and future presidents to wage war against ISIS without restrictions on
[03:34:51.520 --> 03:34:56.640]  time geographic scope or the use of ground troops it is a completely open
[03:34:56.640 --> 03:35:01.200]  and it's authorization for the president to use the military as he wishes for as
[03:35:01.200 --> 03:35:06.320]  long as he or she wishes even president Obama has expressed concern over how
[03:35:06.320 --> 03:35:11.820]  willing Congress is to hand him unlimited power to wage war the forum
[03:35:11.820 --> 03:35:16.520]  relations committee whose chair senator Bob Corker suggested that a new
[03:35:16.520 --> 03:35:21.080]  authorization for use of military force was unlikely to happen and that
[03:35:21.080 --> 03:35:26.840]  president Obama currently has the legal authority he needs Corker's authority
[03:35:26.840 --> 03:35:32.920]  was bypassed by McConnell's treasonous fast-track and senator Lindsey Graham
[03:35:32.920 --> 03:35:36.720]  bleeding out to reporters if the Democrats don't want to give this to
[03:35:36.720 --> 03:35:41.360]  Obama then stand up and tell me why there may be some people running for
[03:35:41.360 --> 03:35:46.040]  president as Republicans who don't want this I would be astonished that anybody
[03:35:46.040 --> 03:35:50.960]  seeking to be commander-in-chief wouldn't want this power it would allow the
[03:35:50.960 --> 03:35:56.960]  administration to fight the terror group ISIS wherever whenever and however as
[03:35:56.960 --> 03:36:01.680]  if the real threat of ISIS was a mystery to the American people most
[03:36:01.680 --> 03:36:06.440]  Americans are fully aware that our greatest threat lies in Obama's policies
[03:36:06.440 --> 03:36:12.040]  regarding immigration the bill isn't even warm yet and vice president Joe Biden
[03:36:12.040 --> 03:36:17.880]  is in Turkey cheerleading World War three presenting both sides of the issue to
[03:36:17.880 --> 03:36:22.120]  Turkey and the American people our allies in the region where our largest
[03:36:22.120 --> 03:36:26.280]  problem in Syria the Turks were great friends and I have a great relationship
[03:36:26.280 --> 03:36:31.240]  with Erdogan which I just spent a lot of time with they poured hundreds of
[03:36:31.240 --> 03:36:37.760]  millions of dollars and tens thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would
[03:36:37.760 --> 03:36:43.680]  fight against Assad except that the people who were being who were being
[03:36:43.680 --> 03:36:50.640]  supplied were al-Nusra and al-Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis
[03:36:50.640 --> 03:36:56.160]  coming from other parts of the world following World War two the United
[03:36:56.160 --> 03:37:00.960]  States leadership has continually sought to foment and drive the industrial
[03:37:00.960 --> 03:37:06.360]  military complex machine into an unending unconstitutional state of global
[03:37:06.360 --> 03:37:12.160]  war creating the very enemies Obama's dictatorial powers would seek to
[03:37:12.160 --> 03:37:16.760]  suppress we have finally reached the precipice of the total annihilation of
[03:37:16.760 --> 03:37:22.440]  the balance of powers that act as the foundation of our republic let's not
[03:37:22.440 --> 03:37:28.920]  get involved in constitutional arguments president Obama is desperately
[03:37:28.920 --> 03:37:33.200]  attempting to disarm the public and re-engineer the United States into a
[03:37:33.200 --> 03:37:39.120]  lawless military state overseen by corrupt politicians on par with the
[03:37:39.120 --> 03:37:44.440]  whole horror south of our border John bound for info wars.com another
[03:37:44.440 --> 03:37:47.440]  excellent report from John bound and most of the type of reports you get to
[03:37:47.440 --> 03:37:51.600]  see when you tune into the info wars nightly news I'm jacari Jackson joining
[03:37:51.600 --> 03:37:55.920]  studio with Leanne Mcadoo now we have several callers lined up it but I want
[03:37:55.920 --> 03:37:59.360]  to dovetail on what John bound was saying with which actually ties into what
[03:37:59.360 --> 03:38:03.360]  Tim in California is going to say but give us just one second here Tim he
[03:38:03.360 --> 03:38:06.920]  played the clip of the senator I believe she is from Maryland saying when she
[03:38:06.920 --> 03:38:10.320]  was talking about gun control and gun legislation let's not get caught up on
[03:38:10.320 --> 03:38:14.240]  this constitutional argument let's not sit around and have a debate of whether
[03:38:14.240 --> 03:38:17.920]  or not new laws and regulations are going to violate that Constitution.
[03:38:17.920 --> 03:38:22.400]  This pesky piece of paper. Yeah you don't you just need to wipe your you're behind
[03:38:22.400 --> 03:38:25.960]  with that piece of paper I guess is how they feel about it and more on that we
[03:38:25.960 --> 03:38:31.160]  have Kit Daniels article backdoor gun control doctors not just psychologists to
[03:38:31.160 --> 03:38:35.680]  screen all adults for depression now you know you go into the doctor you know
[03:38:35.680 --> 03:38:39.280]  for whatever reason you know let's say let's say you break your leg whatever and
[03:38:39.280 --> 03:38:42.520]  maybe a little depressed you know you're a baseball player now you can't play so
[03:38:42.520 --> 03:38:46.360]  you may be a little bit depressed by that that could be a pre-wreck to having
[03:38:46.360 --> 03:38:50.480]  your guns taken away as far as far as that sounds that's actually true now if
[03:38:50.480 --> 03:38:54.280]  you're a football player you could not you know you have the mental issues there
[03:38:54.280 --> 03:38:59.720]  with the concussion right and it's not just that we see another article this
[03:38:59.720 --> 03:39:04.040]  from kid as well a lawsuit cops confiscate guns from vet diagnosed with
[03:39:04.040 --> 03:39:08.800]  insomnia for the most basic you know silly things we've seen people with a
[03:39:08.800 --> 03:39:12.480]  VA being discriminated against just because they help have somebody help
[03:39:12.480 --> 03:39:15.280]  them with their taxes you know they say you're mentally incompetent a lot of
[03:39:15.280 --> 03:39:20.120]  people have people prepare the taxes they have h-nar block all manner the tax
[03:39:20.120 --> 03:39:24.880]  code is really difficult to navigate in most tax attorneys don't even know how
[03:39:24.880 --> 03:39:28.880]  to navigate the whole thing but then we also have a Don Salazar's article city
[03:39:28.880 --> 03:39:34.800]  demands firearm applicants write an essay explaining why they need a gun so
[03:39:34.800 --> 03:39:39.600]  explain to me why you need your rights I want those people in that city to write
[03:39:39.600 --> 03:39:42.880]  an essay to me why they feel like violating my second amendment why do
[03:39:42.880 --> 03:39:46.360]  you think it's okay to violate my second amendment right and give me that essay
[03:39:46.360 --> 03:39:50.240]  and then I'll judge whether or not that's you know reasonable because clearly
[03:39:50.240 --> 03:39:54.200]  you're gonna get an F it's completely really like yeah you tell me why you
[03:39:54.200 --> 03:39:58.000]  have to violate my rights because somebody may do something someday
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:01.160]  let's not have constitutional argument that's not have that constitutional
[03:40:01.160 --> 03:40:04.600]  argument now Tim I'm gonna let you on the show Tim from California please not
[03:40:04.600 --> 03:40:18.720]  give us your constitutional argument welcome to the show hey I am part of
[03:40:18.720 --> 03:40:23.800]  the resistance been part of the resistance before I knew what that meant
[03:40:23.800 --> 03:40:30.880]  all right what's on your mind today just listening to up there in Oregon what's
[03:40:30.880 --> 03:40:37.840]  going on you know sound to me my opinion would be it they probably did
[03:40:37.840 --> 03:40:42.160]  murder the guy it's gonna be one of those things to create to take our guns
[03:40:42.160 --> 03:40:48.520]  away to just impose that martial law and say that us Americans are bad and and
[03:40:48.520 --> 03:40:53.760]  you know I I see the writing on the wall and I try to tell all my friends and
[03:40:53.760 --> 03:40:59.720]  I am I am a hundred percent this show hundred percent all or nothing and I do
[03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:04.720]  my best to tell everybody but you know I see it for what it is you know our
[03:41:04.720 --> 03:41:10.080]  leader will tell us that oh we got to take our guns and we all know that guns
[03:41:10.080 --> 03:41:15.200]  is what keeps us safe from from everything and it's just an honor to be on
[03:41:15.200 --> 03:41:20.800]  the show thank you Tim it's it's a it's an honor to talk to you as well and the
[03:41:20.800 --> 03:41:25.080]  thing about this is yeah it undoubtedly is going to be used to like this is this
[03:41:25.080 --> 03:41:27.880]  is why we need to take away your guns this is why we need to have smart guns
[03:41:27.880 --> 03:41:31.840]  and all this other stuff they will point to this but the issue is you know you
[03:41:31.840 --> 03:41:34.640]  have so many other people who use their guns responsibly and I'm not you know
[03:41:34.640 --> 03:41:39.960]  demonizing the people up there in Oregon but it was it was always a tender box
[03:41:39.960 --> 03:41:45.000]  situation that easily gone well that's what day one we're like this is not well
[03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:48.440]  thought out this isn't you know you got they have good heart but this isn't the
[03:41:48.440 --> 03:41:51.640]  right this isn't the right time especially with Obama coming out with his
[03:41:51.640 --> 03:41:56.320]  gun control push there with the state of the Union address and you know I just
[03:41:56.320 --> 03:42:00.400]  like to point out that it's really obvious to see how well the divide and
[03:42:00.400 --> 03:42:04.880]  conquer has worked within this last year because if you go on on Twitter and
[03:42:04.880 --> 03:42:08.800]  social media when this man you know turns out there was someone was killed
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:12.600]  everyone's like yeah that's what you deserve white guy out there with a gun
[03:42:12.600 --> 03:42:17.360]  if you point a weapon out of Fed that's what you get and first of all so did
[03:42:17.360 --> 03:42:21.280]  your sources tell you that he pointed a weapon and then they send me an article
[03:42:21.280 --> 03:42:26.440]  it's like authorities say this is how it went down okay I'm like alright well
[03:42:26.440 --> 03:42:30.680]  sources give me some other sources but then it's like you have the same people
[03:42:30.680 --> 03:42:36.000]  who are wanting people to rally around them I just watched a video a guy in
[03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:39.560]  Florida was there giving his testimony to the judge and he was like I'm sorry I
[03:42:39.560 --> 03:42:43.360]  feared for my life these cops were gonna kill me I feel like they were crooked
[03:42:43.360 --> 03:42:47.440]  cops and this is why I felt like I needed to defend myself and so people you
[03:42:47.440 --> 03:42:50.800]  know social justice warriors are rallying around him oh yeah he's
[03:42:50.800 --> 03:42:54.960]  crooked cops or whatever but then if it's these white guys that they think are
[03:42:54.960 --> 03:42:59.360]  just trying to take the people's land I'm sorry when was the last time you went
[03:42:59.360 --> 03:43:03.400]  to federal lands and swim in the water and did whatever you wanted there no
[03:43:03.400 --> 03:43:07.640]  you can't you got to get there before you know before the sun sets and get on
[03:43:07.640 --> 03:43:10.960]  out of there before the sun sets so it's just you know and let's not forget it
[03:43:10.960 --> 03:43:17.080]  both keepers went to Ferguson to protect black-owned businesses to educate
[03:43:17.080 --> 03:43:20.920]  those people on on their Second Amendment rights you know but now it's
[03:43:20.920 --> 03:43:25.080]  like the tables have turned the race the divide and conquer has worked once again
[03:43:25.080 --> 03:43:29.120]  to keep us from fighting against the man I definitely agree with that it's
[03:43:29.120 --> 03:43:32.440]  keeping you distracted by you know various issues that have nothing to do
[03:43:32.440 --> 03:43:35.640]  with the people that are at the top level I agree at that right 100% now
[03:43:35.640 --> 03:43:39.640]  let's talk to Eric in West Virginia you also want to oh yeah several topics you
[03:43:39.640 --> 03:43:43.240]  want to talk about again for the second time key pick one what is your most
[03:43:43.240 --> 03:43:48.940]  important topic Eric pick one right now is Donald Trump and this is a huge red
[03:43:48.940 --> 03:43:54.680]  flag on CBS news.com right now I shared it in the Info Wars Facebook group he
[03:43:54.680 --> 03:43:59.880]  said that he doesn't like the idea of selling federally owned land because he
[03:43:59.880 --> 03:44:04.280]  feels that the they should be the stewards of the land apparently Donald
[03:44:04.280 --> 03:44:08.320]  Trump is not familiar with the Declaration of Independence and the
[03:44:08.320 --> 03:44:12.720]  Constitution and that the federal government's not supposed to own 30
[03:44:12.720 --> 03:44:17.280]  miles of any property that is that is correct now I didn't I wasn't I'm not
[03:44:17.280 --> 03:44:19.960]  familiar with that article but yeah that is true what you say that they're not
[03:44:19.960 --> 03:44:24.200]  supposed to own federal land so you said that was on there it is CBS news
[03:44:24.200 --> 03:44:29.040]  Donald Trump don't hand federal lands to states wow yeah that is in my mind
[03:44:29.040 --> 03:44:33.440]  that's a red flag he doesn't understand what's going on out there and there's
[03:44:33.440 --> 03:44:37.200]  actually a really great article John Rappaport I'm gonna try and get him on
[03:44:37.200 --> 03:44:40.440]  the show this week I know he's a little tied up but he poses this question is
[03:44:40.440 --> 03:44:46.600]  the Oregon standoff really about uranium and talks about how the Clintons had
[03:44:46.600 --> 03:44:50.360]  their hands and selling the 20% of the uranium that's produced here in the US
[03:44:50.360 --> 03:44:54.760]  now is in Putin's hands actually and of course all of these federal lands a
[03:44:54.760 --> 03:45:00.000]  federal land grabs this is one of the these mineral rights are one of the big
[03:45:00.000 --> 03:45:03.440]  clutches there that have to deal with these federal lands because like I said
[03:45:03.440 --> 03:45:07.480]  it's they always try to push this narrative that it's we the people's land
[03:45:07.480 --> 03:45:12.800]  and they're just the stewards of it and no it's not there like we have Harry
[03:45:12.800 --> 03:45:17.080]  Reed selling that land there in Nevada leasing it out to the Chinese so they
[03:45:17.080 --> 03:45:21.640]  can put solar farms on it yeah do we get are we getting a pay cut of that with
[03:45:21.640 --> 03:45:26.160]  your domestic terrorists if you go out there and oppose these guys who in the
[03:45:26.160 --> 03:45:29.640]  issue with Harry Reid out there is he's saying these guys are domestic terrorists
[03:45:29.640 --> 03:45:32.680]  because they want to protect their cattle meanwhile BLM is shooting the
[03:45:32.680 --> 03:45:35.080]  cattle in the head and throwing them in a ditch and saying that they're the ones
[03:45:35.080 --> 03:45:38.400]  out there fighting for conservation we don't have the food to feed all the
[03:45:38.400 --> 03:45:43.120]  turtles that we said we needed a you know how the turtles were eaten you know
[03:45:43.120 --> 03:45:47.400]  it's completely ridiculous thank you so much Eric now I'm going to jump here a
[03:45:47.400 --> 03:45:52.000]  little bit we see a call from Felicia in Oregon she says she is a oath keeper
[03:45:52.000 --> 03:45:55.480]  member so we'll go ahead Felicia and tell us your thoughts in the Oregon
[03:45:55.480 --> 03:46:00.920]  situation actually I attend the meetings I'm not a formal member okay and
[03:46:00.920 --> 03:46:04.280]  actually some of the things you guys aren't reporting on is there's a group
[03:46:04.280 --> 03:46:12.880]  of like the Pacific Northwest Patriots the Idaho 3% and most more recently the
[03:46:12.880 --> 03:46:17.920]  oath keepers are have a perimeter around that refuge and they've actually had
[03:46:17.920 --> 03:46:25.120]  face-to-taste combat with the feds not combat but you know talking okay saying
[03:46:25.120 --> 03:46:30.040]  that they would protect the people from them and the feds from the people and
[03:46:30.040 --> 03:46:34.160]  this can be seen online it's been recorded by people that were in on it
[03:46:34.160 --> 03:46:39.520]  and this isn't be reported and I'm so afraid for my friends that are up there
[03:46:39.520 --> 03:46:43.120]  do you have is it on the YouTube page or something else that people could
[03:46:43.120 --> 03:46:47.080]  access you can pick it up on Pete Santilli they had someone in there
[03:46:47.080 --> 03:46:50.920]  recording that transaction all right well thank you so much Felicia all right
[03:46:50.920 --> 03:46:56.800]  and let's see let's go on to another caller we have a Zen girl in Florida you
[03:46:56.800 --> 03:47:02.000]  want to talk about the debates and also Donald Trump go ahead hey thank you so
[03:47:02.000 --> 03:47:07.360]  much for having me on I have been a longtime listener and a devotee of Alex
[03:47:07.360 --> 03:47:15.720]  Jones info wars and prison planet dot TV anyway I'm calling because I feel that
[03:47:15.720 --> 03:47:22.640]  even though I like Trump and many of his attributes he he really came out with a
[03:47:22.640 --> 03:47:28.000]  stupid statement when he said he could stand in the middle of Times Square and
[03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:35.120]  shoot somebody and he would still have all his followers I think that's a very
[03:47:35.120 --> 03:47:42.880]  bad statement to make it it really sets the president of how low he's willing to
[03:47:42.880 --> 03:47:50.360]  go he just is full of himself and don't get me wrong of everybody up there he's
[03:47:50.360 --> 03:47:55.640]  the only one that I would consider voting for but I just thought that was just
[03:47:55.640 --> 03:48:01.040]  out of line right you feel the same way yeah I agree with you I think he's
[03:48:01.040 --> 03:48:05.240]  definitely known for making some outrageous statements which the people
[03:48:05.240 --> 03:48:09.800]  were really attracted to but there is a fine line that you can't cross nobody
[03:48:09.800 --> 03:48:14.800]  likes hubris nobody wants to start seeing the Obama smirk in Donald Trump
[03:48:14.800 --> 03:48:19.240]  then they're gonna just realize oh wow we're just voting for another populist
[03:48:19.240 --> 03:48:23.760]  leader here so I agree with you I think he kind of needs to tone it down a
[03:48:23.760 --> 03:48:28.160]  little bit as you know if you're gonna have that kind of narcissism I believe
[03:48:28.160 --> 03:48:31.840]  well thank you so much then girl like I said I don't agree with everything Trump
[03:48:31.840 --> 03:48:35.240]  says you know there's some things I do agree with some things I do not let's go
[03:48:35.240 --> 03:48:39.000]  ahead and talk to Joseph in California you also want to talk about the organ
[03:48:39.000 --> 03:48:51.600]  standoff go ahead
[03:48:51.600 --> 03:48:55.920]  they came in the exact name of the company of the Canadian mining company
[03:48:55.920 --> 03:49:01.560]  and it was sold to the Russian and I think the deal may have even been
[03:49:01.560 --> 03:49:06.240]  broken through the Clinton Foundation and some Canadian government officials
[03:49:06.240 --> 03:49:10.240]  are not quite sure she was a secretary of state she was a secretary of state
[03:49:10.240 --> 03:49:14.960]  who had to authorize that transaction because uranium is a I mean a that could
[03:49:14.960 --> 03:49:19.200]  be a security threat national so she signed off on the deal but go ahead
[03:49:19.200 --> 03:49:23.560]  right no thank you for that thank you for that thanks for taking my call on
[03:49:23.560 --> 03:49:28.880]  that and just piggybacking off of what the previous caller said about Donald
[03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:33.120]  Trump you know I have been having some issues with you know some of the things
[03:49:33.120 --> 03:49:36.920]  that he says of some other things that he does but I still do believe that he's
[03:49:36.920 --> 03:49:40.480]  the best candidate out of all the candidates out there so unfortunately
[03:49:40.480 --> 03:49:44.320]  we've just been placed in a situation where we've got to pick from you know
[03:49:44.320 --> 03:49:50.400]  the best worst things is even with regard to our country you know whether it's
[03:49:50.400 --> 03:49:56.000]  at a local level a state level a federal level everything's so entangled all the
[03:49:56.000 --> 03:50:00.040]  corruption you're just forced to pick the best out of the worst situation
[03:50:00.040 --> 03:50:05.000]  trying to pick the lesser two evils thank you so much and then and then if
[03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:09.080]  you think about it there CBS News just released an article entitled Americans
[03:50:09.080 --> 03:50:13.520]  hate the US government more than ever and it's true I mean you see the polls
[03:50:13.520 --> 03:50:19.080]  it's just historical lows on trust we don't think they're competent and yet
[03:50:19.080 --> 03:50:22.200]  all of a sudden we're getting these calls for a constitutional convention
[03:50:22.200 --> 03:50:27.200]  let's amend we don't want you touching anything nobody trusts you all right
[03:50:27.200 --> 03:50:30.560]  let's real quick I'm gonna try to jam in Algeria and Florida you actually want
[03:50:30.560 --> 03:50:35.360]  to talk about a constitutional convention very quickly sir yeah yeah
[03:50:35.360 --> 03:50:39.680]  listen that thought actually scares me to death but a virtual one I guess it
[03:50:39.680 --> 03:50:43.480]  was so bad the problem is I think that one of the people that selling it is
[03:50:43.480 --> 03:50:48.520]  pretty misinformed yesterday when you're talking Alex you said that one of his
[03:50:48.520 --> 03:50:52.480]  compatriots Mark Levine hold on hold on to that thought we'll come back to you

[03:54:57.280 --> 03:55:01.440]  virtual constitutional conventional convention go ahead and finish your
[03:55:01.440 --> 03:55:07.040]  thought on that yeah I'll try to be real quick about this I just a real
[03:55:07.040 --> 03:55:10.400]  concerned with all the stuff of provocateurs and everything and the
[03:55:10.400 --> 03:55:15.200]  guy that was on yesterday had mentioned one of called a guy named Mark Levine
[03:55:15.200 --> 03:55:19.840]  one of the Alex Jones's compatriots yeah this is a guy that that said he wanted
[03:55:19.840 --> 03:55:25.080]  Netanyahu to be our president in 13 he's called Lou Rockwell anti-semitic he's
[03:55:25.080 --> 03:55:30.840]  called Ron Paul a racist called Tom Woods a neo-confederate I'm just thinking
[03:55:30.840 --> 03:55:34.040]  that you know I just worry about a guy that says you know we should have this
[03:55:34.040 --> 03:55:38.480]  great you know virtual constitutional convention and this is the guy one of
[03:55:38.480 --> 03:55:42.720]  the head guys we should invite yeah I do agree with when you talk about a
[03:55:42.720 --> 03:55:46.000]  constitutional convention like I've heard David Knight say it's not an issue
[03:55:46.000 --> 03:55:49.560]  with the Constitution is an issue getting people to follow the Constitution
[03:55:49.560 --> 03:55:52.880]  you can add anything else you want to it but they won't follow the Bill of Rights
[03:55:52.880 --> 03:55:56.160]  you know you can add whatever it doesn't mean it's going to be followed I agree
[03:55:56.160 --> 03:56:01.200]  with that statement there Jerry all right let's move on now to it's been
[03:56:01.200 --> 03:56:06.160]  holding the longest Steven in Florida you want to talk about Trump go ahead yeah
[03:56:06.160 --> 03:56:11.080]  good afternoon Leanne and Jacare here's what I want to say I brought this up to
[03:56:11.080 --> 03:56:17.960]  Alex once to go you know there's a few issues a couple of them have been
[03:56:17.960 --> 03:56:24.120]  mentioned on info wars but one's not really being talked about by Alex or
[03:56:24.120 --> 03:56:29.560]  anybody else as far as Trump's concerned now the issues about I remember early on
[03:56:29.560 --> 03:56:33.600]  Alex was saying he had a problem with Trump because of his connection with
[03:56:33.600 --> 03:56:38.840]  Latinos and I have a major problem with that too because it's well known that
[03:56:38.840 --> 03:56:43.120]  usually those are run by organized crime and they cause poverty and a lot of other
[03:56:43.120 --> 03:56:48.560]  problems and it's just not a good thing also the issue of imminent domain how
[03:56:48.560 --> 03:56:53.120]  Trump has used that to legally steal people's property and that's a fact and
[03:56:53.120 --> 03:56:56.640]  I wish he would have confronted him about that when he had him on his show but
[03:56:56.640 --> 03:57:01.240]  the main thing I want to say as a Christian that I have the problem with
[03:57:01.240 --> 03:57:06.760]  Trump about is the fact that this man is an adulterer and therefore if his wife
[03:57:06.760 --> 03:57:13.200]  cannot trust him how can I as a voter an American citizen and like a pastor I
[03:57:13.200 --> 03:57:18.920]  heard say a long time ago it's not the economy stupid it's about character and
[03:57:18.920 --> 03:57:23.000]  that is what Donald Trump is lacking I think he's a shulman even though he's
[03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:28.440]  got a lot of good things to say but still I think he's really capitalizing on
[03:57:28.440 --> 03:57:32.760]  this whole thing even though he has some definite interest about America or his
[03:57:32.760 --> 03:57:37.680]  own personal interest because the man is an egotist and the fact that he has no
[03:57:37.680 --> 03:57:42.960]  shame whatsoever and what he's done with his family situation to me speaks
[03:57:42.960 --> 03:57:47.080]  volumes more than anything else he has to say that's good thank you so much
[03:57:47.080 --> 03:57:50.960]  Stephen you like said I'm not on team Trump I have my issues with them as
[03:57:50.960 --> 03:57:54.840]  well I'm sure anybody could elicit a few things they don't like about them real
[03:57:54.840 --> 03:57:58.520]  quick we're gonna go go to our last caller let's go to John in Florida you
[03:57:58.520 --> 03:58:02.120]  got 40 seconds or so go ahead
[03:58:02.120 --> 03:58:08.120]  I listen to you guys show for a while and if we're starting to Oregon stand off you
[03:58:08.120 --> 03:58:12.160]  guys think they should stand down and just follow the cops orders because
[03:58:12.160 --> 03:58:15.880]  that's what everyone says that well I mean I wouldn't have showed up there in
[03:58:15.880 --> 03:58:19.280]  in the first place personally you know that you're showing up to a situation
[03:58:19.280 --> 03:58:22.880]  where you're not being asked to assist and once again you know I'm a supporter
[03:58:22.880 --> 03:58:26.900]  of you know the right to gather the right to bear arms and all that stuff but
[03:58:26.900 --> 03:58:30.160]  it wasn't the time or place because they just really weren't invited there in
[03:58:30.160 --> 03:58:33.200]  the first place thank you so much stay tuned for the info wars nightly news
