[00:00.000 --> 00:12.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.320 --> 00:21.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.080 --> 00:32.360]  I am so wound up this morning this afternoon depending on what times on
[00:32.360 --> 00:39.000]  you're listening to us in this evening this morning getting ready to come in to
[00:39.000 --> 00:47.360]  the info wars media center I sat there in a chair for about 15 minutes just
[00:47.360 --> 00:54.200]  staring at the wall something I rarely do trying to come up with words
[00:54.200 --> 01:07.560]  descriptions to describe how incredibly fast the tyranny is metastasizing just
[01:07.560 --> 01:11.920]  yesterday we talked about the new Homeland Security cyber security
[01:11.920 --> 01:16.760]  legislation that all the major watchdog groups admit is the complete end of
[01:16.760 --> 01:20.360]  freedom on the web the end of the fourth amendment total Pentagon takeover of
[01:20.360 --> 01:27.040]  all telecommunications infrastructure the CIA director publicly a month ago
[01:27.040 --> 01:30.680]  saying yeah we listen and watch everything you do get used to it
[01:30.680 --> 01:36.120]  government inoculating children in states across the Union without parental
[01:36.120 --> 01:40.000]  consent giving children abortions without parental consent all of it
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.320]  lawless and illegal and now taking children from parents when they don't
[01:45.320 --> 01:51.800]  get vaccines no law absolute kidnapping we do have a totally illegitimate
[01:51.800 --> 01:58.280]  criminal government and lately I have been going to different churches in
[01:58.280 --> 02:03.240]  Austin trying them out and also randomly going and looking at the sermons
[02:03.240 --> 02:08.400]  that Methodist Baptist interdenominational Catholic you name it
[02:08.400 --> 02:16.280]  churches are giving and I found that in the last two weeks all over the country
[02:16.280 --> 02:23.880]  they've been having clergy response team speeches that of course is FEMA secret
[02:23.880 --> 02:28.360]  program now declassified a few years ago to get most of the clergy in the
[02:28.360 --> 02:33.200]  country to spy on their flock and to basically become government agents my
[02:33.200 --> 02:38.160]  wife went to a church to try it out this weekend with the children I told her I
[02:38.160 --> 02:41.400]  just can't handle being around people right now I need some time at least a
[02:41.400 --> 02:51.400]  few hours where I'm not being looked at I said I'm gonna stay home and work on
[02:51.400 --> 02:55.000]  stuff exercise but also pray I've been doing a lot more praying lately I'll
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  tell you there are no atheists and foxholes maybe they are just I don't
[03:01.000 --> 03:10.240]  know them and she gets home and I said how was the sermon and she said it was
[03:10.240 --> 03:18.000]  cop worship and again it's not that some police aren't really good men and
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.520]  women and don't lay their lives down and don't have tough jobs but it's the
[03:21.520 --> 03:27.960]  system programming what preachers say the federal government and getting
[03:27.960 --> 03:32.920]  everybody ready to do whatever the police say under martial law that's the
[03:32.920 --> 03:40.120]  whole point is that it's a synthetic artificial hollow thing as well because
[03:40.120 --> 03:42.760]  they don't care about the military and the police effect the system hates them
[03:42.760 --> 03:48.040]  and treats them like trash you know when he legal aliens drug smugglers with
[03:48.040 --> 03:54.240]  US Justice Department furnished guns kill a cop they don't have a parade
[03:54.240 --> 03:58.800]  anything it's kept real quiet the families paid off but a cop gets killed
[03:58.800 --> 04:02.960]  by somebody on psychotropic drugs in Austin you'd think the world had come
[04:02.960 --> 04:06.800]  to the end and now I've talked to people that didn't know I actually have a
[04:06.800 --> 04:11.240]  mutual friend that knew this police officer said well one reason was he's
[04:11.240 --> 04:17.240]  a really nice guy everybody liked him so I understand that the point is is that
[04:17.240 --> 04:23.800]  the system uses it why are they selling us on worshiping the government and the
[04:23.800 --> 04:29.920]  police in the military that's what fascist states do in the Americana system
[04:29.920 --> 04:36.040]  you've never had the military off-duty encouraged to be out in their uniforms
[04:36.040 --> 04:41.560]  because our military and our government and our citizens knew oh that's what
[04:41.560 --> 04:47.440]  you see in third-world countries but now it's everywhere to get us ready to live
[04:47.440 --> 04:52.800]  in a military state military is a very dangerous thing I'm gonna break down
[04:52.800 --> 04:57.320]  some of the biggest news ever on the other side stay with us

[06:07.440 --> 06:11.160]  that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[06:11.160 --> 06:14.680]  or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this
[06:14.680 --> 06:18.480]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at
[06:18.480 --> 06:22.920]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they

[08:32.800 --> 08:37.040]  humans worldwide and understand a scientific dictatorship being carried
[08:37.040 --> 08:42.720]  out by six global private mega banks is waging war against the free market
[08:42.720 --> 08:48.720]  society private property the family in a scientifically prepared planned and
[08:48.720 --> 08:56.000]  public program for a new world order eugenics agenda 21 takeover we are in
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.240]  the process of being completely conquered we're already geographically
[09:00.240 --> 09:05.600]  conquered we're already conquered to the private Federal Reserve and its
[09:05.600 --> 09:09.720]  collection agency the IRS financially but now they're going after our bodies
[09:09.720 --> 09:14.960]  our minds with the chemicals biologicals the chemtrails the weather
[09:14.960 --> 09:20.520]  manipulation we have a group of control freak psychos whose megalomania thanks to
[09:20.520 --> 09:27.040]  technology is now being manifest Nero thought he was God but he wasn't God and
[09:27.040 --> 09:30.480]  he didn't have nuclear weapons Caligula thought he was God the Roman Emperor
[09:30.480 --> 09:41.240]  Aztec kings thought they were God now the elite do have what you could call God
[09:41.240 --> 09:48.880]  like power through the nuclear weapons the fission weapons the tectonic weapons
[09:48.880 --> 09:54.760]  the biological weapons for all intents and purposes not like God with a big G
[09:54.760 --> 10:01.240]  but God little G like the Greek gods to devastate devastate this planet and
[10:01.240 --> 10:07.360]  devastate humanity they've had a covert attack profile creeping around poisoning
[10:07.360 --> 10:14.760]  the food the water the medicines the Trojan horse vaccine program they have
[10:14.760 --> 10:19.160]  tested their soft kill up to a point where they're just devastating the
[10:19.160 --> 10:25.280]  population in mass just mass death disease neurological disorders cancer
[10:25.280 --> 10:32.040]  autism everything off the charts toys Barbie cancer Barbie who's had her hair
[10:32.040 --> 10:36.600]  fall out oh let's be sweet to the kids and you know give them a Barbie because
[10:36.600 --> 10:40.000]  they've got cancer the point is why are they all getting cancer why is everybody
[10:40.000 --> 10:46.040]  getting breast cancer not let's get a cure for it why is it exploding to again
[10:46.040 --> 10:50.280]  normalize it that way they can control the movement on breast cancer and
[10:50.280 --> 10:54.960]  pediatric cancer and brain cancer and lung cancer you know lung cancer is up
[10:54.960 --> 11:00.440]  in non-smokers directly linked to cancer viruses in what four major
[11:00.440 --> 11:05.480]  vaccines still being given you're like Alex you open every show with this
[11:05.480 --> 11:10.320]  because that's the big issue whether you're military police or bureaucrats
[11:10.320 --> 11:15.560]  that serve this system you were not given the memo that Angela Merkel was
[11:15.560 --> 11:20.360]  not to take the vaccines oh those memos did come out three years ago the US
[11:20.360 --> 11:27.080]  governing elite the British governing elite the Chinese the Japanese the
[11:27.080 --> 11:31.200]  European Union elite none of them will take the vaccines the memos are public
[11:31.200 --> 11:36.360]  not to take them I've shown you stacks of news reports I just got chills where
[11:36.360 --> 11:42.360]  the Chinese elite have secret farms producing only non-gmo with genetic
[11:42.360 --> 11:46.560]  testing being done on the spot to make sure cross-pollination hasn't happened
[11:46.560 --> 11:50.000]  why do you think that's going on because they've implemented eugenics
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.440]  operations in China as part of a deal with the globalist to move the new
[11:53.440 --> 11:57.240]  order to China that they signed in the mid-1970s if they would carry out the
[11:57.240 --> 12:03.000]  eugenics model their elite did join with the new world order
[12:03.000 --> 12:13.080]  it's got chills again all of the elite with their own private gardens and food
[12:13.080 --> 12:17.400]  special water filtration systems special filtration systems on their houses
[12:17.400 --> 12:21.680]  and now automobiles aircraft flying around behind them when they jet set
[12:21.680 --> 12:26.880]  with the chefs and the food grown at their facilities why is that well the
[12:26.880 --> 12:31.600]  memos of the German government got leaked that the entire upper government
[12:31.600 --> 12:36.360]  class does not take vaccines and it's offered quote translated from German
[12:36.360 --> 12:44.200]  into English clean vaccines if they want them that's London Guardian der
[12:44.200 --> 12:49.640]  Spiegel look it up they give you the message again if you're a servant of
[12:49.640 --> 12:53.320]  this system and have decided to join with the tyranny you're conscious of its
[12:53.320 --> 12:59.760]  evil you know it's real but as a coward or someone who's selfish and only wants
[12:59.760 --> 13:06.840]  to continue having fun today and strutting around like a peacock today and
[13:06.840 --> 13:13.800]  partying today and having the petty power of the system today you are being
[13:13.800 --> 13:22.480]  killed right now the things we're going to see in the near future people are
[13:22.480 --> 13:26.240]  like what are we gonna see government-run health care TSA stick in
[13:26.240 --> 13:29.200]  their hands on our pants forced inoculations remember I told you all
[13:29.200 --> 13:33.440]  that was coming and now it's here and it's like so what when's it gonna get
[13:33.440 --> 13:40.720]  bad Alex it's only gonna get worse because you can't recognize what's bad I
[13:40.720 --> 13:46.760]  mean when I sit there I sat there for like 10-15 minutes just staring at the
[13:46.760 --> 13:53.640]  wall today trying to think of all the things they're doing and how they all
[13:53.640 --> 13:57.840]  tie together and it was like trying to look at grains of sand at the beach and
[13:57.840 --> 14:02.200]  describe each one of them you ever picked up grains of sand and put them under a
[14:02.200 --> 14:06.560]  microscope they're beautiful some are orange some are red some are blue some
[14:06.560 --> 14:10.240]  are green most are white depending on the beach you go to they look like
[14:10.240 --> 14:16.160]  diamonds but it's the opposite you zoom in on the new world order and it gets
[14:16.160 --> 14:24.400]  uglier and more complex the closer you get in on it it is it is a wavelength
[14:24.400 --> 14:30.000]  a spectrum of corruption and evil and enslavement and degradation and
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.080]  humiliation and pain it is trampling and being trampled upon by the priest of
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.720]  power the cult of power who only care about ugliness and black uniforms and
[14:40.720 --> 14:46.880]  trudgins and pain and starving children that is beautiful to them that is what
[14:46.880 --> 14:53.120]  is beautiful to us Winston O'Brien says as he tortures Winston Smith who was a
[14:53.120 --> 15:00.400]  archetype of George Arwell aka Eric Blair who'd worked in propaganda for mi6
[15:00.400 --> 15:13.120]  at the BBC when good men do nothing when good men and women stand down and
[15:13.120 --> 15:17.800]  decide that the whole world is just like a carnival and that you're a spectator
[15:17.800 --> 15:22.520]  and you just go through the world and react to what is fed to you when you do
[15:22.520 --> 15:27.560]  that you automatically allow the very worst elements to take control of the
[15:27.560 --> 15:34.320]  culture and these globalist hate humanity and enjoy ugliness and pain and raw
[15:34.320 --> 15:41.640]  power they love raw power so much they have taken their sweet cold time taking
[15:41.640 --> 15:45.720]  over the system while profiting at the same time and now they prepare to have
[15:45.720 --> 15:50.480]  their absolute total world government system I'm going to describe to you
[15:50.480 --> 15:54.120]  right now what the cashless society control grid system is going to be
[15:54.120 --> 15:59.280]  like we're already into it I told you 15 years ago I told you 10 years ago I
[15:59.280 --> 16:04.280]  told you five years ago I've issued messages to the future for people down
[16:04.280 --> 16:07.280]  the road and now they're already people are already going back to messages from
[16:07.280 --> 16:11.240]  15 years ago five years ago and freaking out going look at this message
[16:11.240 --> 16:17.240]  that's now what happened how does Alex Jones know this because I study the
[16:17.240 --> 16:23.200]  enemy and every time I even think about the enemy I get chills not chills of
[16:23.200 --> 16:30.360]  fear chills of whoo whoo whoo you know like whoo in a spookhouse around the
[16:30.360 --> 16:33.440]  woods at night feel like something brushes up against you get those chills
[16:33.440 --> 16:43.280]  whoo danger will Robinson whoo bad bad and my instinct isn't run my instinct
[16:43.280 --> 16:53.360]  is warn people my instinct is good men let's rally let's defeat this gives me
[16:53.360 --> 16:59.640]  the willies that's really the best description of it I have the willies
[16:59.640 --> 17:11.520]  right now and it's not the willies you get when you're crazy and in college and
[17:11.520 --> 17:15.080]  you drive out ten miles out into the ocean at night when it's super smooth
[17:15.080 --> 17:22.120]  and there's fish woman around your boat and you just jump in and you know swim
[17:22.120 --> 17:28.480]  out a few hundred yards because if you're conscious and analyze the fear
[17:28.480 --> 17:32.200]  statistically it's a very low chance that a barracuda or sharks gonna bite
[17:32.200 --> 17:39.440]  you let's be conservative one out of ten million look it up I mean I think you've
[17:39.440 --> 17:42.800]  got like a one out of 15 million last time I checked and changed you being
[17:42.800 --> 17:47.120]  even bitten by a shark in a year look it up yourself the numbers vary there's
[17:47.120 --> 17:52.400]  like four or five shark fatalities a year my point is you got the willies I
[17:52.400 --> 17:55.880]  mean I remember doing stuff like that in most my buddies wouldn't jump off the
[17:55.880 --> 17:59.560]  boat they're like quit showing off and I'm like it's it's crystal clear out
[17:59.560 --> 18:09.080]  here look there's plankton shining in the water it's magic get in and then one
[18:09.080 --> 18:13.880]  time we had girls with us they pulled their clothes off and jumped in they
[18:13.880 --> 18:20.560]  knew it was fine the point is that those are irrational fears I don't have the
[18:20.560 --> 18:24.480]  willies unless there's jellyfish out there that's a real threat of jumping
[18:24.480 --> 18:33.320]  into black water ten miles off the coast at midnight but my instincts my
[18:33.320 --> 18:38.080]  intellect everything when I look at the New World Order it is it is desperate
[18:38.080 --> 18:43.080]  sorrow that people don't know how serious it is how giant how hardcore how
[18:43.080 --> 18:52.160]  massive it doesn't come to steal and rob it steals and robs to impoverish you to

[24:30.960 --> 24:38.000]  spring of 25 but I am still alive I'm still alive the adventure the patriot
[24:38.000 --> 24:47.360]  the honorable our ancestors live through all of you out there the question is
[24:47.360 --> 24:54.560]  what will you do in this great time of challenge what are you made of the
[24:54.560 --> 24:59.920]  globalist tricks and the different layers of confusion they project you get
[24:59.920 --> 25:04.520]  caught in their false reality or do you understand the manipulation because
[25:04.520 --> 25:10.520]  once you understand it you laugh at yourself at how obvious it was I've
[25:10.520 --> 25:15.280]  got all this world news we have a big guest coming up several big guests but I
[25:15.280 --> 25:25.120]  want to just first calmly talk about something I've been talking about for a
[25:25.120 --> 25:33.320]  week but upon stumbling across a rebroadcast of last Thursday's show on
[25:33.320 --> 25:39.080]  YouTube I didn't give it the gravitas it needed I didn't give people the full
[25:39.080 --> 25:44.200]  spectrum breakdown that is so essential I mean in and of itself it's it's
[25:44.200 --> 25:50.360]  horrible and another signpost on the road to absolute enslavement and all
[25:50.360 --> 25:56.000]  that that word enslavement means but then there's the media response and how
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.840]  they report on it like it's no big deal there's there's that whole story and
[25:59.840 --> 26:04.920]  then there's how it ties into everything else and I shot there on the phone with
[26:04.920 --> 26:08.320]  Paul Watson this morning who's doing a story on it and who's listening right
[26:08.320 --> 26:14.920]  now to get some of my points to add to his research and that's what I stood
[26:14.920 --> 26:19.120]  there basically staring at the wall you're thinking about all the hundreds
[26:19.120 --> 26:24.200]  of different points that come up when I think about this and the historical
[26:24.200 --> 26:28.720]  ramifications and of course I'm speaking about the IRS coup over our
[26:28.720 --> 26:34.240]  Republic and that's what it is the Federal Reserve began its coup d'etat
[26:34.240 --> 26:38.800]  over the financial system and its infiltration and slow takeover because
[26:38.800 --> 26:42.440]  if you had a foreign army come in and declare a coup Americans would resist it
[26:42.440 --> 26:48.400]  but infiltration by stealth that's how we were attacked and that's how we were
[26:48.400 --> 26:53.920]  taken over and now they're just mopping up free speech the right to assemble
[26:53.920 --> 27:02.440]  private property rights things like that that's being moped up right now and so I
[27:02.440 --> 27:07.360]  was rereading these articles last night in this morning I here's Forbes from
[27:07.360 --> 27:12.520]  April 7th a week ago or more forget travel if you owe the IRS here's another
[27:12.520 --> 27:17.200]  one oh the IRS you're not going anywhere Fox News
[27:18.320 --> 27:29.080]  okay and I've got some more articles going over that and the way this Robert
[27:29.080 --> 27:37.640]  W. Wood just calmly talks about well they've had some similar things you
[27:37.640 --> 27:40.360]  know where you got to pay your child support or they take your paycheck or
[27:40.360 --> 27:45.080]  to get a hunting license if you got any problems you can't get a hunting
[27:45.080 --> 27:48.880]  license it's a privilege so it's just like oh it's just something new it's no
[27:48.880 --> 27:56.480]  big deal not even Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia the worst despotisms didn't
[27:56.480 --> 28:03.280]  take passports for unpaid taxes they took them from people as part of a
[28:03.280 --> 28:06.000]  process they learned that if you just came and arrested people to take them
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.120]  away to a slave labor camp they'd resist but if you first took their passport
[28:10.120 --> 28:14.480]  only arrested their neighbors came back a month later and said now go live in
[28:14.480 --> 28:18.520]  this slum this ghetto and then a year later come get you and take you away the
[28:18.520 --> 28:24.200]  process and the globalist have written psychological warfare manuals that are
[28:24.200 --> 28:28.760]  public on this they create a process
[28:31.160 --> 28:41.000]  and so there is oh yeah you just won't be able to leave the country of course I've
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.440]  read deeper into what they've called for I've told you this is coming for years
[28:44.440 --> 28:50.520]  now it's here you're not going to be able to buy or sell this is not the Bible
[28:50.520 --> 28:54.240]  saying it's it's the it's the it's the Federal Reserve that runs our country and
[28:54.240 --> 28:58.200]  it's collection agency the IRS you're not gonna be able to have a job go to
[28:58.200 --> 29:02.120]  National Park go into federal building that's why they're now setting up TSA
[29:02.120 --> 29:06.000]  checkpoints outside social security buildings and others and they're saying
[29:06.000 --> 29:13.320]  if your card isn't up to date you're just homeless extra judicial no courts no
[29:13.320 --> 29:18.720]  due process just like over two million people are on no fly list don't know how
[29:18.720 --> 29:26.760]  you got on don't know how you get off it's the National Security State run by
[29:26.760 --> 29:31.800]  mafia criminals who are involved in every abominable crime you can imagine
[29:31.800 --> 29:36.440]  publicly people like Corzine saying you're gonna give all your money to the
[29:36.440 --> 29:40.480]  foreign banks that run your country through austerity and a war in Buffett
[29:40.480 --> 29:44.760]  or you're not going to have a job and next we're gonna come arrest you and put

[33:37.400 --> 33:44.800]  all right let me break down what capital controls and martial law mean in
[33:44.800 --> 33:51.640]  America and what it signifies to have the fact that the Senate has passed it's
[33:51.640 --> 33:56.760]  moving quickly to the house it is expected to pass and there is no
[33:56.760 --> 34:03.680]  opposition on talk radio or in print that I have seen in a week of research this
[34:03.680 --> 34:08.680]  legislation has been introduced for months and I wasn't even aware of it
[34:08.680 --> 34:15.760]  until it passed out of committee in the Senate and now pass the general Senate I
[34:16.360 --> 34:21.840]  wasn't aware of it someone who is a complete news junkie just like Obama
[34:21.840 --> 34:26.600]  signed an executive order to seize control of natural gas and try to keep us
[34:26.600 --> 34:31.280]  from using it as an energy source you know listing it as some type of you know
[34:31.280 --> 34:35.920]  threat and trying to take state regulation power away like the Texas
[34:35.920 --> 34:39.840]  Railroad Commission has over natural gas I'd actually talk to some mid-level
[34:39.840 --> 34:43.680]  executives they said these rumblings were coming two years ago well what
[34:43.680 --> 34:49.240]  while everybody was diverted with the hooker scandal down in South America with
[34:49.240 --> 34:54.840]  Obama and the Secret Service he snuck another weekend executive order in on
[34:54.840 --> 35:03.240]  us just like the National Defense Authorization Act the torture the new
[35:03.240 --> 35:14.800]  wars all of it now continuing here the public plan by the big corporations and
[35:14.800 --> 35:18.960]  all their press releases and governments is to standardize all
[35:18.960 --> 35:25.280]  electronics including inexpensive clock radios systems and refrigerators light
[35:25.280 --> 35:31.400]  bulbs everything to have tech embedded in it that allows it to be remote
[35:31.400 --> 35:36.760]  controlled by government smart meters this is all on record MIT said it was
[35:36.760 --> 35:41.440]  the plan 12 13 years ago I first read about it people are like yeah right our
[35:41.440 --> 35:47.120]  light bulbs and toasters are gonna be watching us then you saw Forbes and
[35:47.120 --> 35:53.280]  Reuters and Wired Magazine a month ago say yes all new appliances spy on you
[35:53.280 --> 35:58.040]  but it's not just a smart meter on your house or in the neighborhood wirelessly
[35:58.040 --> 36:04.320]  accessing it on record all of the
[36:06.720 --> 36:10.800]  post office vehicles are now going to have these snooper hubs installed that's
[36:10.800 --> 36:18.040]  associated press last year all of them that's the plan and data over power line
[36:18.040 --> 36:22.200]  the new chips are coming out that you pay for when you buy the refrigerator the
[36:22.200 --> 36:27.000]  toaster the microwave oven the refrigerator the dishwasher the
[36:27.000 --> 36:34.360]  computer the smartphone the iPad all of them have back doors remote access even
[36:34.360 --> 36:42.720]  when they're turned off under federal regulations which they call law okay and
[36:42.720 --> 36:46.280]  Petraeus just says hey get used to it the Fourth Amendment isn't seen as it
[36:46.280 --> 36:50.120]  was in the past he didn't say we're gonna ignore it he just said the Fourth
[36:50.120 --> 36:55.600]  Amendment allows this oh yeah that'll warrant coming into your house and again
[36:55.600 --> 36:59.360]  gathering data on everyone and you're like a lot of them to hide do you have
[36:59.360 --> 37:02.600]  something to hide from serial killers if something I mean why do you lock your
[37:02.600 --> 37:04.880]  doors that if you have nothing to hide because there's bad people out there
[37:04.880 --> 37:13.800]  governments the number one killer demo side look it up you're always taught to
[37:13.800 --> 37:16.040]  be scared of your neighbor you're always taught to be scared of anybody but
[37:16.040 --> 37:21.200]  government when government as our founders stated is the number one threat so
[37:21.200 --> 37:28.760]  here's our top news today the IRS has stated that the collection agency for
[37:28.760 --> 37:32.040]  the private Federal Reserve that we pay our taxes to as Ronald Reagan's own
[37:32.040 --> 37:35.960]  Commission showed not one cent goes around the country it's all interest on
[37:35.960 --> 37:47.360]  the debt the debt to print a dollar which is really a Federal Reserve note debt
[37:47.360 --> 37:52.240]  is created paid to the private banks we didn't have this till 1913 they hadn't
[37:52.240 --> 37:56.480]  completely phased it in till the 70s they didn't really have the income tax
[37:56.480 --> 37:59.600]  enforced till the 50s
[38:04.640 --> 38:10.840]  United States of America it says that on this $5 Lincoln Greenback reissued by
[38:10.840 --> 38:19.680]  Kennedy but the topic says United States note not Federal Reserve note that is
[38:19.680 --> 38:25.480]  the difference United States note but look at the money in your wallet it's a
[38:25.480 --> 38:32.080]  Federal Reserve note the IRS was set up at the exact same time to fund this
[38:32.080 --> 38:37.600]  scam and that's why Warren Buffett is out saying raise taxes on the rich
[38:37.600 --> 38:43.000]  because he has helped himself write the loopholes where he is exempt then he
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.400]  uses the fact he's exempt to say raise it on people over 250,000 a year so that
[38:48.400 --> 38:51.760]  he'll get that money out of the Treasury and banker bailouts and they even
[38:51.760 --> 38:56.680]  admit that I I covered that yesterday on the Sunday show how Buffett rule would
[38:56.680 --> 39:01.480]  still be escaped by highest earning households and the Washington Post admits
[39:01.480 --> 39:08.000]  it here's one independent headline Goldman Sachs conquers Europe
[39:10.760 --> 39:16.560]  raising taxes bankrupting everybody except the elites to transfer the money
[39:16.560 --> 39:21.640]  to them because the government traders signed on to the fiat derivative debts
[39:21.640 --> 39:26.720]  created by Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase and others and again I keep repeating
[39:26.720 --> 39:32.080]  that because that's the giant elephant in the room that's the huge hoax and then
[39:32.080 --> 39:36.560]  this smirking Warren Buffett trying to act non-threatening in every photo I
[39:36.560 --> 39:40.760]  see with an ice cream oh it's the nice old man with an ice cream folks evil
[39:40.760 --> 39:47.320]  doesn't look like Jeffrey Dahmer or Freddy Krueger or Jason from Friday the
[39:47.320 --> 39:55.560]  13th or the killer from Halloween or the monsters from the movie Alien evil
[39:55.560 --> 40:00.240]  looks like little old men in suits who know to look non-threatening and go I'm
[40:00.240 --> 40:05.280]  a nice old man raised my taxes when he knows full well he helped get rid of
[40:05.280 --> 40:08.960]  Glass-Steagall and he was the biggest beneficiary of the bailout money here
[40:08.960 --> 40:13.240]  that is out of McClatchy Buffett champion of bailout is also leading
[40:13.240 --> 40:18.200]  beneficiary and I know I keep hammering on this before I get to the IRS because
[40:18.200 --> 40:21.800]  people say well the IRS is a little out of control but you got to pay your share
[40:21.800 --> 40:29.800]  you know we've always had taxes death and taxes all this talk yeah we've
[40:29.800 --> 40:33.520]  always had tariffs and trade and sales taxes and things we didn't always have
[40:33.520 --> 40:37.360]  property taxes that's feudal surf tax you don't own your land we didn't have
[40:37.360 --> 40:42.520]  one till the 50s in this country used to really own your property you don't own
[40:42.520 --> 40:47.760]  your land you rent it you pay government rent and they'll take it if you don't
[40:47.760 --> 40:52.680]  and you pay with that and lose your property rights to pay for the government
[40:52.680 --> 41:00.080]  Fed run brainwashing centers the public indoctrination prison centers the
[41:00.080 --> 41:04.920]  churches until the 50s weren't 501c3 charities they knew they were under the
[41:04.920 --> 41:08.040]  First Amendment Congress will make no law respecting an establishment
[41:08.040 --> 41:11.800]  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof government has no
[41:11.800 --> 41:16.640]  jurisdiction in it until they trick you to sign into the jurisdiction and now
[41:16.640 --> 41:21.360]  you go to pretty much any church there is go to the Methodist Church first
[41:21.360 --> 41:24.320]  Methodist of Austin Bill and Melinda Gates are going to save you open the
[41:24.320 --> 41:29.360]  borders Heather has two mommies go to a Baptist Church worship the police state
[41:29.360 --> 41:33.240]  do whatever government tells you I've read the stuff that's at Catholic
[41:33.240 --> 41:37.440]  churches online turn your firearms in there of the devil open the borders up
[41:37.440 --> 41:44.600]  it's illegal to have borders world governments good these are government
[41:44.600 --> 41:49.000]  spokesmen even though they may love God and not be evil people their gullible
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.400]  chumps who think Romans 13 Hitler's favorite passage is their world and you
[41:54.400 --> 41:59.320]  should get it info wars.com Pastor Chuck Baldwin's excellent book Romans 13
[41:59.320 --> 42:04.080]  written with his son is constitutional lawyer and get it out to every one of
[42:04.080 --> 42:07.360]  these preachers and rebuke them I mean that's why my wife always wants me to go
[42:07.360 --> 42:11.360]  to church if I'd have gone to church with her and heard that Baptist preacher
[42:11.360 --> 42:14.920]  going to this government worship I did I'd have had to stand up right there I
[42:14.920 --> 42:20.080]  mean I cannot be around it and maybe that is my calling every Sunday to go in
[42:20.080 --> 42:23.840]  a church and stand up notice that's why they always got the big bouncer they
[42:23.840 --> 42:35.640]  call them an usher it's also devilish I tell you these people have no idea let
[42:35.640 --> 42:39.040]  me explain something to you ladies and gentlemen I know you know this but we've
[42:39.040 --> 42:43.360]  got to get this information out to everybody I'm gonna shoot a special
[42:43.360 --> 42:46.920]  report till the nightly news tonight I want everybody to get it and get it out
[42:46.920 --> 42:51.160]  to every because we've got a call talk radio we've got a call the newspapers we
[42:51.160 --> 42:56.040]  got to write letters to the editor we've got to call Congress now because this
[42:56.040 --> 42:59.800]  is incredible Congress passed the NDAA saying the president could secretly
[42:59.800 --> 43:04.920]  arrest and disappear citizens they've got other legislation pending that says
[43:04.920 --> 43:08.680]  for any reason they can strip your citizenship if the president or defense
[43:08.680 --> 43:16.880]  department says and deport you as a natural born citizen see nobody even
[43:16.880 --> 43:21.080]  kangaroo court Nazi courts didn't say you weren't a German they would just
[43:21.080 --> 43:27.480]  trump something up this is saying you just disappear of course it led to that
[43:27.480 --> 43:32.560]  later in Germany but at first they they would have show trials everywhere they
[43:32.560 --> 43:37.720]  want to just suspend due process and say you're guilty until we bury a six feet
[43:37.720 --> 43:41.680]  under it's not guilty until proven innocent it's supposed to be innocent
[43:41.680 --> 43:45.360]  till proven guilty then it's guilty until proven innocent and now it's your
[43:45.360 --> 43:49.520]  guilty period governments God and we're buying giant a giant armored tanks
[43:49.520 --> 43:54.240]  folks search was up over the weekend homeland security buys giant armored
[43:54.240 --> 43:58.320]  vehicles and these things look like something out of out of the running man
[43:58.320 --> 44:02.240]  I mean these are armored vehicles that look like the tanks the Nazis built I
[44:02.240 --> 44:07.160]  mean they've got wheels that are like you know 10 feet tall and they've got like
[44:07.160 --> 44:10.640]  foot thick armor for the American people they're buying hundreds of millions of
[44:10.640 --> 44:15.600]  rounds a month digging in armored pillboxes that they drag behind these
[44:15.600 --> 44:22.120]  things and again it's not the government it's foreign banks took over
[44:22.360 --> 44:26.440]  yeah there's Paul Watson's article about homeland security buying up ammo
[44:26.440 --> 44:32.800]  supplies type in homeland security buys giant armored vehicles and tanks it did
[44:32.800 --> 44:37.720]  this new one I saw Friday that Nemo posted was just just absolutely
[44:37.720 --> 44:41.480]  gorgantuan and I looked up they're buying hundreds of them I've talked to the
[44:41.480 --> 44:45.600]  troops at the bases and confirmed and then checked and it's true they're
[44:45.600 --> 44:50.160]  taking warrior fighting vehicles Bradley's and others and deploying them
[44:50.160 --> 44:55.080]  in strategic locations all over the country in fact most counties now have
[44:55.080 --> 45:01.720]  regular army caches not at the regular armory but they've got caches at
[45:01.720 --> 45:05.960]  facilities I was worried about citizens running to those they've got hidden
[45:05.960 --> 45:10.840]  caches of tanks armored vehicles flamethrowers rocket launchers there it
[45:10.840 --> 45:17.200]  is homeland security unveils monstrous swat trucks look at this thing that's
[45:17.200 --> 45:21.920]  bigger than the ones they've got in Iraq the troops can't have those
[45:22.680 --> 45:26.280]  all right and that's not even the big one I found one in there was even bigger
[45:26.280 --> 45:31.840]  it had even bigger wheels it's the oldest story in human history where
[45:31.840 --> 45:35.800]  governments get taken over by criminals they know the public's waking up so they
[45:35.800 --> 45:39.320]  armed to the teeth and declare anybody who doesn't want to be a slave the
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.720]  enemy I'm gonna explain something the public agenda 21 plan is they're gonna
[45:43.720 --> 45:46.640]  keep raising even when housing prices went down where I live they raise
[45:46.640 --> 45:52.600]  property taxes they're going to bankrupt everybody who isn't on the inside track
[45:52.600 --> 45:56.120]  just like all the other coal plants have to shut down except those owned by
[45:56.120 --> 46:02.360]  globalist and they're just and Congress's don't do it and Obama says I'm
[46:02.360 --> 46:06.560]  gonna do it don't want your war in Libya I got you an authority it's it's a lot
[46:06.560 --> 46:09.920]  you get to a point in tyranny where they're not eating around the edges
[46:09.920 --> 46:20.520]  anymore but where they do whatever they want whenever they want and they train
[46:20.520 --> 46:24.760]  you to be a complete prisoner the preacher where my wife went to church
[46:24.760 --> 46:31.000]  said the way to do it is if you get pulled over be thankful and put your
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.800]  keys on the dash in your hands up I mean literal prisoner training that's what
[46:35.800 --> 46:41.000]  the TSA is as if we're all criminals and and I always do that and the officers
[46:41.000 --> 46:47.080]  thank me why don't you just put your hands out the window and that's what our
[46:47.080 --> 46:49.880]  kids are trained for in the schools being put on the school buses and taken to
[46:49.880 --> 46:53.480]  FEMA centers and some cops listening go well that does make it safer the point
[46:53.480 --> 46:58.280]  is crooks run you you may be the nicest guy in the world might be fun to go
[46:58.280 --> 47:02.080]  deer hunting with you I bet it would be I bet you'd be fun to sit around a
[47:02.080 --> 47:08.280]  table drink beer and eat a T-bone steak but the point is the government isn't
[47:08.280 --> 47:11.960]  the government anymore okay now I want to go to this clip we're gonna come back
[47:11.960 --> 47:19.160]  with the IRS news but domestic checkpoints when the IRS who has its
[47:19.160 --> 47:24.120]  own fake courts and who takes homes houses without courts and who garnishes
[47:24.120 --> 47:28.560]  wages without courts and who just says what you owe them and it's all written
[47:28.560 --> 47:35.280]  visiting so the elites are exempt it's written like that on purpose if they
[47:35.280 --> 47:39.920]  say if you owe taxes you're not gonna be able to travel outside the country and
[47:39.920 --> 47:47.120]  they're gonna revoke that is turn off the chip in your passport I told you every
[47:47.120 --> 47:53.080]  week for over a decade that was the plan because I would read the white papers
[47:53.080 --> 47:58.160]  coming out of MIT they admit the system they set up in Baghdad and Fallujah is
[47:58.160 --> 48:03.160]  modeled after the quote control grid cashless society control grid that's
[48:03.160 --> 48:10.280]  not my term that's the Rand Corporation Department of Defense MIT the matrix
[48:10.280 --> 48:15.400]  isn't a term written by some author for the Wachowski brothers that's a 1970s
[48:15.400 --> 48:22.760]  Pentagon plan doesn't mean that ever I mean it's so crazy reality is so much
[48:22.760 --> 48:27.960]  wilder than any science fiction movie people tell me they're bored you're
[48:27.960 --> 48:32.240]  living in an artificial environment basically now in these cities with
[48:32.240 --> 48:35.640]  everything being manipulated electromagnetic chemical biological all
[48:35.640 --> 48:40.920]  of it on record the elites all have their private food supply non-gmo they
[48:40.920 --> 48:44.000]  don't take the vaccines I'm gonna go to break and come back with this but here's
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.960]  Rahm Emanuel this is what this new domestic Homeland Security National

[54:10.880 --> 54:17.880]  this country and brag in hundreds of publications like the economist that it
[54:17.880 --> 54:23.000]  is a dictatorship of quote technocratic central bankers remember all those years I
[54:23.000 --> 54:26.880]  said central bankers imploding the economy through derivatives world
[54:26.880 --> 54:31.400]  government then they're gonna have capital controls checkpoints to buy and
[54:31.400 --> 54:38.160]  sell face scanning it'll be a digital photo all of it now being announced and
[54:38.160 --> 54:41.160]  you're like okay well I'll just put up with that no no no it's meant to manage
[54:41.160 --> 54:46.080]  the economy track at all shut down the grassroots farmers markets you name it
[54:46.080 --> 54:49.400]  that they call black market because they know is they squeeze you you're gonna
[54:49.400 --> 54:54.200]  try to survive and and this is about no more single-parent homes not having
[54:54.200 --> 54:57.280]  money to have kids they now say that we're gonna bankrupt you so you can't
[54:57.280 --> 55:01.440]  have kids and if you do and you're poor we're gonna take them this is the planned
[55:01.440 --> 55:08.640]  economy this is agenda 21 this is it do you understand I don't it's worse than
[55:08.640 --> 55:14.240]  I'm saying people go oh it can't be that bad it's worse it's worse it's all gonna
[55:14.240 --> 55:22.160]  happen unless we really get upset and again what got me upset is this this
[55:22.160 --> 55:26.080]  this Forbes article me and the Fox articles all like oh well yeah it's
[55:26.080 --> 55:32.080]  gonna pass and self-fulfilling prophecy and you know the eye again the IRS just
[55:32.080 --> 55:37.440]  put you on a list and just says you're in arrears I get letters all the time
[55:37.440 --> 55:40.520]  saying I am and it always always start fighting it turns out it's made up
[55:40.520 --> 55:43.960]  again the whole thing's a fraud to begin with it's a collection agency for the
[55:43.960 --> 55:50.760]  private fellow deserve this is the type of stuff we're talking about now this is
[55:50.760 --> 55:55.360]  the model where gangster crooks like Rahm Emanuel who gives you know billions
[55:55.360 --> 55:59.880]  of dollars to fake energy companies and and Don Corzine who steals billions of
[55:59.880 --> 56:04.320]  his own people's money lies to Congress doesn't get in trouble that's where your
[56:04.320 --> 56:09.960]  tax money goes most of your tax money doesn't even go to defense or police or
[56:09.960 --> 56:15.400]  any of it it goes to the bankers that's why Warren Buffett's like race taxes on
[56:15.400 --> 56:19.440]  the rich because he's exempt he wants the middle class and new wealth new
[56:19.440 --> 56:24.880]  voracious money it's so elementary and that talking point needs to get out
[56:24.880 --> 56:34.280]  everywhere because it's the truth it's the truth let's go to Rahm Emanuel to
[56:34.280 --> 56:38.680]  the Brady Center about how they're just gonna put you on a list they say if
[56:38.680 --> 56:42.000]  you're on a no-fly list two million people don't know why they're on it
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.520]  can't get off of it was last time I checked like 30 something Congress people
[56:46.520 --> 56:51.840]  are on them little five-year-old kids six-year-old kids are on them if you're
[56:51.840 --> 56:55.840]  on that list and maybe a possible terrorist no judge no jury you don't
[56:55.840 --> 56:59.720]  have access to a firearm they're just gonna expand that list folks already
[56:59.720 --> 57:02.480]  most veterans I talked to can't buy guns even they have no criminal record
[57:02.480 --> 57:06.340]  you're just put on the list now it's already in place there just like the
[57:06.340 --> 57:10.240]  ATF's now telling gun shops what they can do outside of law that's called
[57:10.240 --> 57:15.640]  capital T tyranny and now these same crooks are gonna have a no-fly list and
[57:15.640 --> 57:18.760]  and the IRS has said their ultimate plan is you're not gonna be able to have a
[57:18.760 --> 57:24.200]  car insurance have a job or travel anywhere if you're in bad steds with
[57:24.200 --> 57:27.760]  them you're gonna be on the no-fly list and the no-gun buy list and then you're
[57:27.760 --> 57:32.320]  gonna have to turn your guns in that's the plan you watch here's Rahm Emanuel
[57:32.320 --> 57:36.240]  and I think the most simple thing we can do and we've got to make this a number
[57:36.240 --> 57:41.000]  one issue as a test vote and then take it into the election that is if you are
[57:41.000 --> 57:46.080]  on the no-fly list because you are known as maybe a possible terrorist you
[57:46.080 --> 57:51.360]  cannot buy a handgun in america
[57:52.080 --> 57:57.960]  tyrant listen to those criminals flapping those are tyrants I am not one
[57:57.960 --> 58:02.560]  far from liking the mixing of politics and policy but as my old boss used to
[58:02.560 --> 58:07.080]  say give me that vote and throw me into that prior patch I'll make politics out
[58:07.080 --> 58:11.680]  of that every day because if it's between that terrorist list and the
[58:11.680 --> 58:15.760]  NRA I know where America is gonna be every time and they're gonna make the
[58:15.760 --> 58:19.600]  right choice and we have got to start building on that that is the right thing
[58:19.600 --> 58:23.800]  to take into the election it's the right policy if you're on that no-fly list
[58:23.800 --> 58:28.360]  your access to the right to bear arms is canceled because you're not part of the
[58:28.360 --> 58:31.840]  American family you don't deserve that's enough they don't deserve that right
[58:31.840 --> 58:36.920]  which is a privilege now they're saying to travel this is for everybody we're
[58:36.920 --> 58:40.840]  all terrorists according to that terrorist
[58:42.640 --> 58:50.080]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[58:57.960 --> 59:02.520]  if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets

[59:55.480 --> 1:00:00.560]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:00:04.640 --> 1:00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:19.920]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:27.600]  Alex Jones. Patriotism in America is about groveling to tyranny and
[1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:31.840]  worshiping the government that's what the American flag symbolizes now they've
[1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:36.680]  taken it and until we admit we have a foreign corporate government that's
[1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:42.120]  occupying our nation and butchering our bill of rights systematically we have
[1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:46.400]  no hope of turning things around and if people think Mitt Romney is going to save
[1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:49.800]  them that the globalists are lining up he's financed by the very same people
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:56.040]  now when I call Rahm Emanuel a terrorist he really is his parents were the head
[1:00:56.040 --> 1:01:00.320]  of his father was the head of the eargun the top Israeli terrorist at a bomb to
[1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:03.920]  Palestine and surrounding areas till they kicked the British out of his dad
[1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:11.120]  bombed British troops blew up what King David Hotel you name it so he is kind
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:14.160]  of like a rock star that's that's you know that's like wow to terrorists
[1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:18.880]  worldwide he's a rock star he's a mafia Don as well but he's the guy that says
[1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:22.280]  he wants a national service and he wants you with a machine gun on a chair on the
[1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:27.240]  street corner you know the kids shoving mama and papa around and granddaddy
[1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:31.000]  around I mean if you go through any tyranny of the past Rahm Emanuel's
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:35.480]  promoting it you name it he's into it from black uniforms to national
[1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:42.200]  compulsory service to checkpoints and the criminal IRS for the Federal Reserve
[1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:46.120]  setting up checkpoints nationwide not letting you fly out of the country and
[1:01:46.120 --> 1:01:51.800]  taking your passport which is taking your citizenship a citizen's right is to
[1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:56.400]  travel and to leave to and from the country and it's past the Senate and they
[1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:00.760]  say it's probably gonna pass the house and the media is like oh yeah it's no
[1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:04.440]  big deal yeah there's a lot of stuff you can't buy and sell and do if you haven't
[1:02:04.440 --> 1:02:09.080]  paid child support or if you've got outstanding taxes now you can't get a
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:11.960]  hunting license it's all through a database now you won't be able to leave
[1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:15.200]  the country or travel or soon have a job and Homeland Security is already
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:21.160]  approving most job applications for different corporations because they're
[1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:26.400]  the good guys you know they're the ones that ship the drugs into the United
[1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:30.680]  States and the guns into Mexico and Honduras and no they're just a mafia
[1:02:30.680 --> 1:02:35.080]  they're just a bunch of crooks that's all they are a bunch of crooks let's go
[1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:40.480]  back to him sitting there saying this is the guy that says we'll secretly arrest
[1:02:40.480 --> 1:02:44.840]  you and disappear you will torture you you won't get a gun if we say so no judge
[1:02:44.840 --> 1:02:53.760]  no jury because I say so again another guy who's openly served in foreign
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:57.640]  military you know he served the Israeli military and I'm not even an enemy of
[1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:03.520]  Israel my point is this guy is a terrorist this guy is a usurper it's
[1:03:03.520 --> 1:03:10.280]  just that simple and there it is you have a foreigner saying arrest Americans
[1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:13.840]  secretly arrest them conscript their children and don't let them fly if they
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:19.640]  hadn't paid the private Federal Reserve through the IRS I mean it's that simple
[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:24.200]  our country has been taken over by outside elements by the globalist by all
[1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:28.880]  these special interests were a joke and they've got the propaganda they got the
[1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:32.120]  police they got the military and they're getting ready to stage terror attacks
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:37.040]  you better believe it let's go ahead and go back to this terrorist in chief
[1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:42.280]  Rahm Emanuel you are known as maybe a possible terrorist you cannot buy a
[1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:50.840]  handgun in America no judge no jury no fly list no no fly look at him smirking
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:55.320]  just drips criminality not one far from liking the mixing of politics and
[1:03:55.320 --> 1:03:59.160]  policy but it's my old boss uses if you saw him in the dark alley you would I
[1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:02.400]  mean you would turn around right looks like a certain kind of that every day
[1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:06.240]  just have people look but he's a demon that terrorist terrorist list and the
[1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:10.320]  NRA I know where America is gonna be every time and they're gonna make the
[1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:13.760]  right choice with your gun terrorist got to start building on that that is the
[1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:17.360]  right thing to take into the election it's the right policy if you're on that
[1:04:17.360 --> 1:04:22.480]  no fly list your access to the right to bear arms is canceled because you're not

[1:08:27.480 --> 1:08:33.360]  nonfiction he's got a lot of amazing insights into things and of course he
[1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:39.040]  was also put in army intelligence held a top-secret security clearance with a
[1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:42.600]  special background investigation access sensitive compartmentalized
[1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:47.520]  information he was awarded officer especially 35 a tactical all-source
[1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:51.920]  intelligence officer I'll go through all of his interesting bio here he was a
[1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:59.840]  captain in army intelligence is to give you the short end of it he'll be with us
[1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:06.920]  to talk about preparation for the engineered collapse that the gen 21
[1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:12.400]  globalist have been carrying out but you know that for the last hour plus I
[1:09:12.400 --> 1:09:20.880]  have been beside myself with the fact that capital controls are being
[1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:30.520]  implemented on the US and I was told now three years ago that John Wayne's
[1:09:30.520 --> 1:09:38.320]  family was leaving the country by John Wayne's I'm gonna just leave it at that
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:44.560]  and by countless other wealthy people powerful people I talked to a lady who's
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:48.800]  one of the biggest defense contractor owners in the world worth billions she
[1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:52.520]  left the country four years ago I've told you about that over and over again
[1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:59.240]  and they said look you won't be able to get anything out of the country if you
[1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:04.200]  don't leave in the next few years and that's the word that's why all the big
[1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:07.000]  money people even the globalist themselves have been getting their money
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:10.560]  out of the country and buying armored redoubts or digging in here in the
[1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:14.560]  country and all these elitist are building you know these five 10 20 some
[1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:20.560]  cases 30 million dollar armored subterranean homes with you know machine
[1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:24.960]  gun turrets why are they doing this because they've done a great job at
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:30.640]  carrying out this agenda 21 resource war of deindustrializing the West getting
[1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:34.280]  us into debt signing us on to their derivatives and getting ready to fully
[1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:38.360]  implode the country and as we slide into depression they keep telling us
[1:10:38.360 --> 1:10:40.880]  everything's fine everything's fine everything's wonderful as the crime
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:46.200]  rate increases as all of this happens but the good news is between five and
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:50.320]  seven million because it varies month-to-month previously the record was
[1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:54.720]  like two million guns in a month was the record month a few years ago now it's
[1:10:54.720 --> 1:11:00.840]  over five million guns a month many big manufacturers have announced they they
[1:11:00.840 --> 1:11:06.520]  are suspending new orders for six months to a year small manufacturers are
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:10.840]  making the same announcement because they're so behind on orders the
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:14.320]  government's buying giant armored vehicles hundreds of millions of rounds a
[1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:18.240]  month four hundred and something million this month 300 million that month 200
[1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:22.560]  million this month digging in they've got the preachers and clergy response
[1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:26.760]  teams brainwashing their flocks submit to government with what's coming do what
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:30.720]  you're told take the shots governments now shooting kids up without parental
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:34.520]  consent yeah again they're doing whatever they want and they're announcing
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:38.640]  we'll secretly arrest you if we want will disappear you you're not going to fly
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:42.280]  out of the country of the IRS as you haven't paid no judge no jury we're
[1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:46.560]  going to put you on a no gun buy list no judge no jury no crime if you're on the
[1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:50.360]  no fly list and I've told you for over ten years they were already talking
[1:11:50.360 --> 1:11:54.760]  about it even before 9-11 the no fly list will be expanded to a no work list a
[1:11:54.760 --> 1:12:00.440]  no buy-sell list with the digital photo you'll still be able to use cash but it
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:05.760]  will be connected to a digital photo in all transactions and an internet ID on
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:09.400]  online purchases and that's in the cyber security act they're trying to pass
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:15.320]  right now SISPA I mean I'm getting chills every five seconds now okay because I
[1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:19.280]  knew it was all coming I read it from their own documents but it is a total
[1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:25.760]  banker infiltration of the preachers the police the military the media the
[1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:30.040]  entire culture and Forbes and Fox and I've even heard national host going
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:33.400]  better pay those taxes or you're not going to be able to fly out of the
[1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:38.020]  country and go on that vacation folks this is capital controls let this is
[1:12:38.020 --> 1:12:42.280]  right out of Nazi Germany right out of Soviet Russia I mean this is one of the
[1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:46.480]  big hallmarks definition of capital control any measure taken by a
[1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:49.720]  government central bank or other regulatory body to limit the flow of
[1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:54.320]  foreign capital in and out of domestic economy but this is even worse that they
[1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:59.080]  they don't want to grasp roots economy so they're putting a capital control on
[1:12:59.080 --> 1:13:02.560]  that that's why even Forbes said why are they rating thousands of lemonade
[1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:08.160]  stands why are they attacking peaceful protesters why why are they because it's
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:14.320]  here folks as well as market-based forces capital controls can affect many
[1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:19.960]  asset classes such as equities bonds foreign exchange trades tight capital
[1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:23.400]  controls are often found in developing countries where the capital reserves are
[1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:29.520]  lower and more susceptible to volatility it means when their devaluing
[1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:37.200]  currency is one of the big ones now that's from investopedia that's their
[1:13:37.200 --> 1:13:40.720]  definition of it I have flown and seen it it's been in the news I did an
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:45.800]  interview with a guy he had six silver coins little ones computer programmer
[1:13:45.800 --> 1:13:49.960]  and he was going to Vegas to a coin show and they weren't even very valuable he
[1:13:49.960 --> 1:13:53.760]  was just going to you know trade them and stuff my son they were just us silver
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:58.520]  rounds you know worth like $35 at the time and they were gonna take them so I
[1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:02.960]  saw him as I was going through Austin they're now asking people about their
[1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:08.280]  diamond rings their necklaces their downloading people's laptops this is a
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:11.160]  prison induction they're just getting you ready now I'm gonna shut up and go to
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:14.720]  our guest but I'm really freaked out about this because it's past the Senate
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:20.600]  it's now in the house and the ATF I was told this a month before the letter went
[1:14:20.600 --> 1:14:24.080]  out last year I was the first to break the letter just pointing out we have
[1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:29.520]  sources the ATF is now going to tell people that you can't sell semi-autos
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:33.560]  anymore that is there they're discussing it next year the NRA says they've gotten
[1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:37.080]  word that quote there's big gun control next year if Obama gets elected the point
[1:14:37.080 --> 1:14:41.640]  is that I was told that they were going to tell people don't sell more than two
[1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:46.600]  guns to somebody in these four western states Texas to California and if you do
[1:14:46.600 --> 1:14:50.200]  you've got to call the ATF as if they don't already have a record of that
[1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:54.200]  through Knicks the point is it's getting you used to doing what you're told
[1:14:54.200 --> 1:15:00.720]  outside of law now James I didn't really tell you when I was gonna get you on
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:03.200]  about today I just wanted to pick your brain about current events and talk about
[1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:07.040]  you know your research but being an army intelligence seeing what's happening I
[1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:11.360]  talked to military and police a lot of them are finally waking up but I see the
[1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:14.440]  system creating a cult of the military and the police who they could care less
[1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:19.880]  about taking their pension funds you name it to to to wear as a mantle around
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:25.160]  the tyranny ahead of trying to start some new civil war in this country they
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:28.480]  tried to start to race war with the Trayvon Martin thing but people aren't
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:34.120]  buying that NBC editing the tape the White House pushing it I mean I can just
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:37.760]  see the volatility I've just been ranting while you've been on a hold about
[1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:42.600]  this IRS capital control and not and saying they're gonna revoke your
[1:15:42.600 --> 1:15:45.920]  citizenship basically because that's what your passport is symbol of it's a
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:51.360]  total right I don't know of any culture that ever does that on a case-by-case for
[1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:55.920]  espionage they take your passport that's about it or when you're already out on
[1:15:55.920 --> 1:15:59.880]  bond so they're saying basically you're all prisoners and of course it'll be
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:04.540]  expanded James Leslie Rawls what do you make of this and all the other
[1:16:04.540 --> 1:16:10.640]  craziness sir well we're living in very dangerous times and when I when I saw
[1:16:10.640 --> 1:16:16.120]  the the news reports about the IRS threatening to take people's passports
[1:16:16.120 --> 1:16:21.800]  actually what popped into my mind was Jonestown and Jim Jones taking away all
[1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:26.240]  of the people of the camps passports and locking them up in a couple of foot
[1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:34.720]  lockers we're we're verging on a society that's a police state at this point and
[1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:40.640]  people need to wake up and they need to get themselves prepared if they're
[1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:47.200]  going to move overseas they should take the gap soon if they're gonna hunker
[1:16:47.200 --> 1:16:51.920]  down here in the States they need to get their beans bolts and band-aid squared
[1:16:51.920 --> 1:16:58.400]  away now because those windows of opportunity are closing I hear you are
[1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:03.680]  you getting chills I mean and by chills I mean ten years ago I would feel the
[1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:12.000]  urgency a little bit now it's blowing me away well the immediacy of it I think
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:17.680]  is almost overwhelming at this point when I first drafted my my first novel
[1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:25.360]  Patriots back in 1990 1991 people would get it as kind of wild speculation but a
[1:17:25.360 --> 1:17:30.040]  lot of it what was in there has come to pass we're living in increasingly
[1:17:30.040 --> 1:17:35.440]  dangerous times we're entering into an age of deception and betrayal by our own
[1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:41.560]  government and people need to recognize that they need to if they're not if
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:47.080]  they're not scared right now they're not paying attention very well said you I
[1:17:47.080 --> 1:17:50.880]  know you've got a lot of feelers out are you seeing people in the system starting
[1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:56.160]  to wake up like I am oh yeah absolutely I have consulting clients right now that
[1:17:56.160 --> 1:18:02.920]  actually you know our mid-level and low-level employees in national
[1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:09.120]  intelligence agencies in the FBI and amongst defense contractors and
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:13.760]  retiring military personnel they're looking for me for advice on where they
[1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:20.520]  should relocate there's a lot of anxiety inside and outside of the
[1:18:20.520 --> 1:18:25.080]  government right now oh god you know what's so nasty is it's not just some
[1:18:25.080 --> 1:18:28.960]  boss hog that wants to rob everything these globalists are really nasty they
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:35.960]  want to hurt people well yeah they made it very clear that the whole concept of
[1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:42.720]  national sovereignty is essentially out out the window that you you no longer
[1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:48.240]  have the freedom to travel you no longer have any banking privacy and if the
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:51.880]  internationalists have it the globalists have it their way they'll take
[1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:56.760]  away our right to keep it their arms as well as you've mentioned many times
[1:18:56.760 --> 1:19:03.720]  there's a large push underway at the super national level for the small arms
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:08.280]  and light weapons treaty which if enacted would essentially erase our
[1:19:08.280 --> 1:19:14.560]  Second Amendment and they've said that treaties supersede the Constitution
[1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:18.240]  which of course on record they don't but they just lie and say that come up
[1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:22.320]  they say the Second Amendment's a privilege or traveling's a privilege
[1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:26.080]  you know core sign stealing millions getting caught lying and not getting in
[1:19:26.080 --> 1:19:33.560]  trouble I mean they really are just trying to break our will right now and
[1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:37.560]  how do you fight back against this type of infiltration how do you fight back
[1:19:37.560 --> 1:19:42.280]  against such a long-term patient game now about to come to fruition I know we
[1:19:42.280 --> 1:19:47.320]  we preemptively exposed them decades ago you did and others did and that gives
[1:19:47.320 --> 1:19:53.400]  us they bought us some time yes but unfortunately we're we are approaching
[1:19:53.400 --> 1:19:59.240]  the end game and at this point while I do recommend that people remain
[1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:04.560]  politically active at this point it's time to hunker down it's time for
[1:20:04.560 --> 1:20:10.400]  individual families to team up with like-minded friends pick out a
[1:20:10.400 --> 1:20:15.600]  defendable piece of land with plentiful water and good topsoil and be ready to
[1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:21.000]  just ride out the storm because it's coming all right you've got the floor
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:25.240]  break down because again I didn't read your novel till the mid 90s late 90s
[1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:30.200]  96 97 and it even had contemporary characters in it like you know Mark
[1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:35.480]  Kornke and people totally blew me away and you know what a collapse would look
[1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:40.680]  like what an agenda 21 would look like you broke down basically and people
[1:20:40.680 --> 1:20:43.280]  said well why would they want to wreck it because they want to wreck it to try to
[1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:48.920]  consolidate it and they risk overheating it too much and losing control right but
[1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:52.800]  but but break down what you see happening the scenarios you see unfolding
[1:20:52.800 --> 1:20:56.560]  some of the different breaks there how this could go in different directions
[1:20:56.560 --> 1:21:01.600]  well I think in the in the near future we're likely to see as you've mentioned
[1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:06.640]  a derivatives collapse and the counterparty risk there is huge it's
[1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:10.840]  almost incalculable because the number of derivatives that are in play
[1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:14.560]  measured the hundreds of trillions of dollars there's there's more derivatives
[1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:20.240]  in play than there is currency in the whole world there's the the economic
[1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:26.240]  risk is huge if we see a repeat of the 2008 credit collapse which is quite
[1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:31.880]  likely will they were very well could be a banking collapse there could be a
[1:21:31.880 --> 1:21:36.160]  stock market collapse a collapse of the bond market it could just be a house of
[1:21:36.160 --> 1:21:42.960]  cards coming down there's a whole cascade of events that could bring our
[1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:47.960]  economy to its knees and bring commerce to a screeching halt and as I've
[1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:53.240]  mentioned many times before the crucial linchpin to watch is the power grid
[1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:58.280]  the power grid stays up we may still have some semblance of order but if the
[1:21:58.280 --> 1:22:04.000]  grid goes down that will be the situation where the the power brokers have
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:10.240]  basically lost control of their engineered collapse and everyone's going
[1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:16.880]  to be in the same boat what will be it in a massive die-off situation where
[1:22:16.880 --> 1:22:21.360]  literally more than half the population of the country could die over the course
[1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:26.680]  of one winter and by the way the globalist have collapsed Argentina and
[1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:30.840]  if that wasn't a warm area they would have had and they some say millions of
[1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:34.560]  dead I mean it was doctors for years eating out of trash bins it's still
[1:22:34.560 --> 1:22:38.520]  happening down there and just to interject something when you talk about
[1:22:38.520 --> 1:22:43.120]  the control collapse why are they at the same time buying up and shutting down
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:48.760]  power plants to make bigger profits for the ones they control and causing
[1:22:48.760 --> 1:22:52.960]  blackouts it's like they can't even the elite have a plan but they're so greedy
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:56.840]  they're there they're even destroying their own future do you see what I'm
[1:22:56.840 --> 1:23:00.720]  saying well yeah the well unfortunately elitists have bought into the whole
[1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:06.560]  green revolution idea but when you when you take the green revolution to its
[1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:11.480]  logical conclusion you end up with people freezing in the dark because you cut
[1:23:11.480 --> 1:23:16.800]  off virtually every power source and the few that are left like solar and wind
[1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:24.040]  power are unreliable in terms of providing 24-hour day grid power if you
[1:23:24.040 --> 1:23:27.920]  get rid of all the coal-fired plants all the hydro dams because they're killing
[1:23:27.920 --> 1:23:32.040]  little fishies and get rid of all the natural gas-powered plants all that
[1:23:32.040 --> 1:23:36.200]  leaves you with the solar and wind and that's great when the sun is shining or
[1:23:36.200 --> 1:23:41.040]  the wind is blowing but it gives you nothing when the conditions aren't right
[1:23:41.040 --> 1:23:46.920]  so we're going to end up in a third-world situation where power is
[1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:54.360]  unreliable and people need to be prepared to make their own power and get
[1:23:54.360 --> 1:24:00.440]  themselves in a situation where if there's disruption of grid power for
[1:24:00.440 --> 1:24:06.680]  what for example I recommend people buy propane powered chest power chest
[1:24:06.680 --> 1:24:10.960]  freezers rather than electric chest freezers because I think the powers can be so
[1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:16.000]  unreliable we may have power failures that go on for not days but weeks and if
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:19.480]  there's a course of a total grid collapse all bets are off and the
[1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:22.240]  government's been saying get ready for rolling blackouts this is part of the
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:26.720]  new freedom I just want to plug here that if people go to infowarch.com they
[1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:31.160]  can get survivors by James Wesley Rawls all the orders get a free citizen
[1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:34.760]  rulebook with it also strategic relocation North American guide to
[1:24:34.760 --> 1:24:43.600]  safe places third-edition incredibly valuable information and then also to
[1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:48.320]  understand why they're doing this behind the green mask UN agenda 21
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:53.760]  Rosa Corey excellent all available you know it's buoying though James to see
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:24:58.560]  the city council woman in Houston trying to veto land grabs under agenda 21 and
[1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:03.760]  saying it's agenda 21 again there is an awakening please continue if people are
[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:07.160]  definitely waking up and it's encouraging to see things like the Ron Paul
[1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:12.560]  campaign for example it's encouraging to see all of the free exchange of
[1:25:12.560 --> 1:25:15.040]  information that's going on on the internet and I think that's one reason
[1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:21.320]  why there's all this talk of clamping down on the internet is it has the
[1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:28.000]  agenda 21 crowd running scared because when you shine a light on this it's
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:34.240]  like turning a light on in a apartment and having the cockroaches go scurrying
[1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:39.720]  we we're in a situation now where there's such a fast exchange of
[1:25:39.720 --> 1:25:44.920]  information on the internet that it's essentially unstoppable and unless
[1:25:44.920 --> 1:25:50.920]  they're able to control access to the internet and track people on the internet
[1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:59.320]  and clamp down on on dark beds and people using VPN for example they
[1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:03.200]  basically can't the genius out of the bottle they can't stop individual
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:07.760]  liberty unless they they completely shut down the internet which is at this
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:15.000]  point is it is impossible so people are waking up I'm glad to see so many
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:22.120]  grassroots organizations forming and I'm glad to see people training and
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:28.120]  teaming up and preparing for the dark days ahead because they things could get
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:35.000]  very very bad before they get better and I think it's important that people team
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:39.080]  up they've got to be in the right place at the right time with the right friends
[1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:44.160]  to get through this and if people aren't thinking in those terms if they aren't
[1:26:44.160 --> 1:26:48.280]  thinking strategically then they're just gonna end up another statistic and
[1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:52.920]  they're just gonna be another refugee on the road and if the 20th century taught
[1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:58.160]  us anything it's the life of a refugee is is nasty British British and short you
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:03.480]  don't want to be a refugee you want to you want to plan your out now you should
[1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:08.000]  people should relocate you may just previously you mentioned Joel Scowles
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:12.040]  and spoke strategic relocation that's a fantastic book and I highly recommend it
[1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:16.680]  because it gets people thinking along the lines of strategically putting
[1:27:16.680 --> 1:27:22.680]  themselves where they need to be for the dark times ahead people need to make
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:28.600]  those moves now you can't get out of dodge at the 11th hour it I noticed that
[1:27:28.600 --> 1:27:33.040]  you started doing some of your videos from home and I I encourage that because
[1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:37.320]  people have to think about strictly operating out of their homes hunkering
[1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:42.200]  down for extended periods of time because there may come a time in the very
[1:27:42.200 --> 1:27:47.680]  near future where it simply isn't safe to commute into the big city people have
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:52.400]  to think in terms of hunkering down living self-sufficiently as much as
[1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:55.800]  possible making their own power pumping their own water up out of the ground
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:59.920]  growing their own food raising their own livestock and providing for their own
[1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:07.840]  security because all those systems if we depend on others for them are probably
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:13.320]  going to be going away and anyone who's not prepared to face that new paradigm
[1:28:13.320 --> 1:28:19.160]  is going to become a statistic now I want to raise this point to you and we're
[1:28:19.160 --> 1:28:22.400]  going to break here in a moment and come back and but start answering it now
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:28.520]  again you don't treat your own horn but you were almost two decades ago able to
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:34.480]  foresee much of what is now unfolding and you even predicted the time frame
[1:28:34.480 --> 1:28:40.560]  with great accuracy I know the future is fluid there's different futures there
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:46.480]  depending on what we do but seeing the awakening tracking its trajectory versus
[1:28:46.480 --> 1:28:54.320]  the tyrants trajectory a what do you think the future holds if you had to
[1:28:54.320 --> 1:29:03.480]  give us a general dead reckoning analysis a and then be how do we change that
[1:29:03.480 --> 1:29:08.160]  analysis from what you currently see well I think I can foresee an economic
[1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:13.560]  collapse regardless of what anyone does at this point because of the the level
[1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:18.120]  of debt that's built up globally globally has gotten so large that it's
[1:29:18.120 --> 1:29:24.520]  absolutely unsustainable under a traditional interest-based debt economy
[1:29:24.520 --> 1:29:29.680]  or those debts to be repaid it's mathematically impossible so I think
[1:29:29.680 --> 1:29:36.800]  we're going to see a global economic collapse and the severity of it depends
[1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:39.680]  on a number of different things stay there let's come back and then see how
[1:29:39.680 --> 1:29:43.960]  you see all of that interacting within the collapse how does it run from bad
[1:29:43.960 --> 1:29:50.520]  to worse how do we get ready with James Wesley we're all stay with us we're on
[1:29:50.520 --> 1:29:58.800]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[1:31:04.720 --> 1:31:08.800]  lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally
[1:31:08.800 --> 1:31:13.240]  starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I
[1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:18.160]  had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be
[1:31:18.160 --> 1:31:22.560]  satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at infowars team.com but

[1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:07.160]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[1:32:07.160 --> 1:32:10.640]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[1:32:10.640 --> 1:32:14.280]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold and
[1:32:14.280 --> 1:32:18.120]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[1:32:18.120 --> 1:32:21.680]  our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[1:32:21.680 --> 1:32:27.160]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless

[1:32:55.200 --> 1:33:01.440]  seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[1:33:08.400 --> 1:33:15.120]  leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones on
[1:33:15.120 --> 1:33:21.400]  the GCN radio network you better believe it you know I've had these liners for
[1:33:21.400 --> 1:33:27.760]  like 17 years different variants of we're in a war the war is now leading a
[1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:36.800]  frontal assault in full war listen this is real okay the globalist want to
[1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:40.000]  deindustrialize the planet and have giant throngs of poor people that they
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:43.160]  control then in all their major public documents they say they're gonna release
[1:33:43.160 --> 1:33:48.960]  bio weapons after that and I mean Dick Cheney wrote in the PNAC document in
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:53.680]  2000 September 20th that they need to use the media to promote and legitimize
[1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:58.920]  the use of race-specific bio weapons that means killing certain groups of
[1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:02.320]  people with a bio weapon where you release it in all northern Europeans die
[1:34:02.320 --> 1:34:08.440]  or all Arabs die or all Chinese die you're like well they can't tailor it
[1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:12.440]  just to Chinese yeah they can they've got it where it would they've got these
[1:34:12.440 --> 1:34:18.480]  genomes so targeted where it will kill the dominant Chinese genetic line and not
[1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:22.800]  even kill the Japanese they've got them so tailored they can kill Arabs of
[1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:28.880]  certain derivations and not kill Jews and Dick Cheney says we need to use the
[1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:32.200]  media to legitimize this that's what it is when they've got all these movies and
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:37.200]  TV shows I mean our I already knew this but they got a c-span event like five
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:41.920]  years ago we're Homeland Security through a party for some of the people from
[1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:46.640]  24 and said thank you for working with us you've really helped get our image up
[1:34:46.640 --> 1:34:50.520]  and you know helped promote taking the gloves off and torture basically they
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:55.000]  said taking the gloves off secret arrest torture disappearing internal
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:59.480]  checkpoints cops watch this the weak-minded ones military and others
[1:34:59.480 --> 1:35:04.160]  and start fantasizing but because they most of them are too professional they
[1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:08.600]  create TSA which is now on the highways they always create a goon force that
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:13.040]  doesn't go through the original academies that have enough pride to not
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:18.160]  teach absolute tyranny you have to twist somebody that came out of the FBI
[1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:23.840]  system or out of the state police Academy you don't have to twist the TSA but
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:28.520]  I'm ranting our guest is here every time I get him on he gets me thinking and I

[1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:39.480]  because I can't even articulate what I know and understand that's why I tend
[1:37:39.480 --> 1:37:43.400]  to blow up because I'm sick of it and I'm tired of the public being simple
[1:37:43.400 --> 1:37:46.800]  minded and not wanting to understand things are coming back with canned
[1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:52.280]  responses the globalist are digging in the government is digging in the
[1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:58.440]  bankers who did this are all digging into armored redoubts on record okay
[1:37:58.440 --> 1:38:04.160]  armored keeps I shouldn't even be here I've moved out of the country got a
[1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:07.240]  well trying to put solar in don't even have time to mess with it because I'm
[1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:11.520]  always down here I've got to get communications equipment in I've got to
[1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:15.640]  get ham radio stuff in learn how to use it I got some of it I've got to create
[1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:20.840]  but I can't do everything is the point I've got to do the basics firearms ammo
[1:38:20.840 --> 1:38:27.000]  training food medical supplies most importantly friends but we're gonna get
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.620]  into if you can stay a little bit in the next hour we'll do 20 minutes or so on
[1:38:29.620 --> 1:38:33.240]  solutions James and take a few calls but and and some of the basics that you
[1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:38.480]  write about it your survival blog calm but but let's expand here for a moment
[1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:44.960]  into my question that I just posed in last segment is the collapse coming you
[1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:50.200]  said yes what are the severities from your research and again how do you see
[1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:55.280]  it shaking out how do you see the collision being like how bad will it be
[1:38:55.280 --> 1:38:58.720]  because people don't know seven million people major universities estimate
[1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:02.320]  starved to death or died from complications of malnutrition during the
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:06.040]  10 years roughly of the Great Depression look it up folks just type in seven
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:09.120]  million died during Great Depression major university studies they kept it
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:18.080]  quiet 90% were semi-self-sufficient now we're 89% city 11% rural only half of
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:22.200]  that was five and a half percent or so are self-sufficient and and what's
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:25.520]  gonna happen is the government is preparing to come in and basically
[1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:29.280]  commandeer stuff but they don't have the infrastructure and people are gonna
[1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:32.400]  start fighting back you're gonna be called terrorist once you're called
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:37.560]  terrorists so what I mean what is the probability of massive bloodshed when
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:41.560]  the fed boys come around with their arm armored war wags trying to you know
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:46.960]  pill for the women go ahead well it's hard to say what the severity of it
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:54.000]  will be we definitely have a economic collapse coming at the near end of the
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:57.920]  spectrum would be a repeat of the depression of the 1930s but as you
[1:39:57.920 --> 1:40:02.600]  mentioned we live in a society that's far less self-sufficient and far more
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:08.880]  technologically dependent than that the society of the 1930s so that even with
[1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:13.280]  just a repeat of the depression of the 30s we're going to see quite a bit of
[1:40:13.280 --> 1:40:19.680]  loss of life the far end of the spectrum would be a total collapse if the
[1:40:19.680 --> 1:40:24.240]  situation just snowballing completely out of control if power grids go down
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:29.280]  and there's actually three grids they go down all bets are off if the grids go
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:36.920]  down we could see the city is running out of drinking water and within 72
[1:40:36.920 --> 1:40:42.080]  hours the reactors are going to start melting down they can't even keep it
[1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:47.160]  from melting down now society so degenerate yeah that's the other the
[1:40:47.160 --> 1:40:53.000]  other wildcard in the whole situation is is not the reactors themselves but it's
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:58.160]  more the cooling pond that are at risk part of the part of the environmental
[1:40:58.160 --> 1:41:01.640]  regulations and the whole that's one of the things that that the green revolution
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:08.040]  brought us was all this foot dragging about yucca mountain and a safe place
[1:41:08.040 --> 1:41:13.840]  to store spent nuclear fuel rods so for the last 15 years all those spent rods
[1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:18.120]  have been building up and building up and building up right at the reactor
[1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:27.120]  sites in these enormous spent fuel cooling ponds well the ponds have such a
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:33.480]  high density of spent fuel in them now that they're no longer they require
[1:41:33.480 --> 1:41:39.000]  constant replenishment of cool water from outside or they boil off and once
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:44.280]  the ponds will boil off they'll melt down just like a Fukushima well that's
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:49.400]  the case for reactors all the way from coast to coast and one of the reasons
[1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:54.600]  that I stress moving to the inland northwest states is that we're upwind of
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:59.960]  most of the nuclear power plants anyone who's downwind they better think in
[1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:05.640]  terms of having a home fallout shelter because we could have an unintentional
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:13.000]  fallout coming from all of these nuclear fuel ponds that melt down if there's so
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:19.360]  many risks out there they're almost impossible to count and it's a cascade
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:24.680]  of risks there's a cascade of events with if the power grid goes down the 18
[1:42:24.680 --> 1:42:29.040]  wheel truck trucks are not going to be rolling the nuclear power plants are
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:33.960]  going to be failing and their cooling ponds will be melting down we're going
[1:42:33.960 --> 1:42:41.760]  to see all the automated reordering system for virtually every aspect of our
[1:42:41.760 --> 1:42:45.400]  modern commerce will come to a screeching halt because it's all computer
[1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:49.960]  controlled and then people say oh Alex just interrupt briefly people say oh
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:55.400]  Alex or oh Leslie the reactors have their own power if stuff's failing down
[1:42:55.400 --> 1:42:59.720]  the line they can only send massive amounts of power they can't sit there
[1:42:59.720 --> 1:43:04.400]  and and fire the plant up and use the little bit they need to keep the plant
[1:43:04.400 --> 1:43:08.680]  going see people don't realize how complex this stuff is and how it's
[1:43:08.680 --> 1:43:14.840]  very finely tuned all of it and now the society's crumbling so fast that they
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:18.720]  can't even find good managers to keep trains working right reactors are
[1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:23.080]  rotting I mean really humanity has just turned into a bunch of jellyfish
[1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:29.600]  you know the the level of complexity that exists now it keeps growing it keeps
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:34.320]  growing year by year the latest on the power grids is there's an effort right
[1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:39.480]  now to to do an intertie between the eastern grid the western grid and the
[1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:47.160]  Texas grid so if even if one grid were to stay up if they do this intertie all
[1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:52.920]  the grids will collapse simultaneously it the the level of complexity keeps
[1:43:52.920 --> 1:43:57.200]  going up year after year the level of interdependence of these of these
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:04.400]  systems keeps going up so the level of vulnerability keeps going up year after
[1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:09.880]  year it's really a wonder we haven't seen a large-scale grid collapse already
[1:44:09.880 --> 1:44:18.760]  and when you when you take you know outside factors into play not just the
[1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:23.320]  grid itself and its complexity but things like EMP or things like solar
[1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:27.080]  flares you could very well have a situation where the grid could go down
[1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:34.320]  and stay down all right specifically you know the the financial collapse is
[1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:38.280]  going to cause massive crime increase we're already seeing it how is that
[1:44:38.280 --> 1:44:43.160]  going to affect things and when you talk about refugees on the road break that
[1:44:43.160 --> 1:44:48.120]  down well basically all the urban areas will be total right off and the
[1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:53.760]  suburbs are going to get formed by refugees from the urban areas there'll
[1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:59.040]  be so many people that find their their urban and suburban homes
[1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:05.160]  uninhabitable that there'll be a huge number of refugees once the water no
[1:45:05.160 --> 1:45:08.400]  longer magically comes out of the tap and the lights don't magically come
[1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:14.280]  come on when you flip the switch and the toilets toilets don't flush your
[1:45:14.280 --> 1:45:18.760]  typical urban apartment building is going to be absolutely uninhabitable it
[1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:23.880]  will be a public health nightmare we'll have refugees on the road within just a
[1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:30.480]  few days and if you look at it demographically we now have 2% of the
[1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:36.960]  population feeding the other 98% well what happens to the farmers that live
[1:45:36.960 --> 1:45:40.840]  fairly close to the suburbs they're going to get swarmed so suddenly you know
[1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:46.520]  we're going to be a situation where even if farmers are still producing how are
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:49.800]  they going to get their crops to market how are they going to live in safety to
[1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:54.840]  be even feel safe running trucks and tractors and and their farm equipment
[1:45:54.840 --> 1:45:57.200]  are taking care of their lifestyle and the globalists are going to show up
[1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:01.280]  after all this collapse and bring in collectivism to quote fix it we're
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:05.640]  going to have all the people from the cities telling us that we've got to
[1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:08.320]  share with them and that we're their slaves and the government's going to
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:11.600]  hand them machine guns that's what probably what's going to happen yes
[1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:16.120]  that very well could be you know if you look at at politics I mean just look
[1:46:16.120 --> 1:46:21.120]  at what happened with the collectivism in Stalinism and what happened to the
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:33.440]  Kulaks in Siberia and in the Ukraine in the 1920s 1930s and 1940s there was
[1:46:33.440 --> 1:46:40.520]  depopulation because they literally they tried to implement collectivism people
[1:46:40.520 --> 1:46:45.760]  rebelled anyone who hid their crops was treated as a trader and shot on the
[1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:49.760]  side and then they ended up having killed the people who knew how to produce
[1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:55.920]  things and they ended up with a you know a downward spiral we could very well
[1:46:55.920 --> 1:46:59.480]  see the same situation in our country but the situation been even worse because
[1:46:59.480 --> 1:47:05.920]  again we have only 2% of the population feeding the other 98% the that the
[1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:11.120]  people that have the know-how to feed America it's a fairly small number of
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:16.760]  people if we end up in a societal collapse situation you know people are
[1:47:16.760 --> 1:47:20.880]  going to end up you know eating the golden goose basically let me ask you
[1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:24.280]  this question wouldn't be the first time it's happened in history in your own
[1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:32.400]  mind personally when do you decide to take action defensively I mean people
[1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:36.200]  are climbing over your fence over your wall come on give us food we need it
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:41.600]  and then you owe it to us they pull a shotgun out or or the you know the local
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:45.760]  cops under homeland pull up and demand house-to-house give us your storeable
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:50.400]  food you know it comes down to that you're in a very dicey situation if it's
[1:47:50.400 --> 1:47:57.240]  a situation with looters I would predict that in the majority of situations
[1:47:57.240 --> 1:48:01.120]  if you start cranking off a few rounds over the heads of looters they're gonna
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:06.760]  go find somebody else to go loot they'll find a softer target if you come up
[1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:11.520]  against your own local government that's a very sticky situation and one
[1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:15.360]  that's almost imponderable all I can say is don't put all your eggs in one
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:20.040]  basket you need to have food cashed in several different places preferably
[1:48:20.040 --> 1:48:23.720]  underground so that if somebody comes and takes part of it they're not gonna get
[1:48:23.720 --> 1:48:27.720]  all of it yeah I'm not talking about what they should do but the point that
[1:48:27.720 --> 1:48:30.640]  government which we're used to is you're robbing us a hundred different ways
[1:48:30.640 --> 1:48:34.520]  is trying to do my point is if they come and want to take food or something
[1:48:34.520 --> 1:48:38.440]  that's one issue the minute anybody tries to take my family or we're taking you
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:43.560]  into custody because the homeland says you cannot go to that horrible sprawling
[1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:47.280]  prison structure they're gonna have because it's gonna be running people by
[1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:55.840]  by you know bestial perverts that like to inhabit such facilities yeah the
[1:48:55.840 --> 1:48:59.760]  last thing you want to be is either a refugee or prisoner in a situation like
[1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:06.600]  that it all I can say is people need to be able to stand their ground they need
[1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:12.080]  to plan in advance and think through the situations of when they'll you know
[1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:16.120]  basically basically a fight or flight decision when when you're gonna flee your
[1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:20.800]  property when you're gonna stand your ground but the last thing you want to do
[1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:26.000]  is end up either a refugee on the road or some guy in the back of a truck with a
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:31.440]  bag over your head with cable ties around your wrists heading off to points
[1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:37.520]  unknown and they've certainly talking to people you know in the government what
[1:49:37.520 --> 1:49:41.960]  percentage are hardcore you know psychotypes that are really looking
[1:49:41.960 --> 1:49:45.760]  forward to all this because from my research most of them are actually
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:50.080]  overall good people they've just been naive they now know this is real I don't
[1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:53.080]  think a lot of them are actually gonna follow the orders I think they'll have
[1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:57.360]  some well-publicized events to make the mercenaries look like victims they're
[1:49:57.360 --> 1:50:01.080]  gonna try to use mercenaries in a lot of cases I don't think they're gonna have
[1:50:01.080 --> 1:50:06.040]  the muscle early on to do this I see it as deep into the collapse then the
[1:50:06.040 --> 1:50:10.560]  reorganizational government comes in right that's the scenario put forth in
[1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:17.400]  my novel Patriots and its sequel survivors and the next one is coming out
[1:50:17.400 --> 1:50:21.600]  in September is called Founders that's basically the situation I put forth
[1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:25.240]  there where there was a collapse and then a power vacuum that's still
[1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:31.200]  primarily by foreign mercenaries it's difficult to predict what will happen
[1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:36.600]  but all I can say is people need to think these things through and take action
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:40.920]  they need to stock up now they need to team up with their like-minded friends
[1:50:40.920 --> 1:50:45.800]  and neighbors and fellow church congregants and plan and cross train and
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:49.000]  get ready stay there by the way I didn't even know yet a new book coming out
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:52.920]  but see it's reality-based so I could guess it I guess it's the foreign UN
[1:50:52.920 --> 1:50:57.200]  mercs versus the new founders of the new republic am I right we'll find out when
[1:50:57.200 --> 1:51:03.560]  we get back straight ahead in an emergency situation would you drink

[1:54:33.080 --> 1:54:36.200]  all this but unfortunately we're not the question is just how bad will it get
[1:54:36.200 --> 1:54:39.240]  we're just hoping for just a regular depression but with this spoiled
[1:54:39.240 --> 1:54:43.640]  population not everybody but certain elements it's gonna be nasty the toll
[1:54:43.640 --> 1:54:51.360]  free number to join us is 800-259-9231 specific questions for the author of
[1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:55.680]  survivors a novel of the coming collapse another one founders coming out and he
[1:54:55.680 --> 1:54:59.520]  said I did basically guess a little bit of the plot correctly but that's in
[1:54:59.520 --> 1:55:03.220]  September well obviously have to have him up for still around then but 800 at
[1:55:03.220 --> 1:55:07.800]  259-9231 Mike Adams is going to be popping in the last 15 minutes of the
[1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:14.400]  show or so I believe we get that set up because he's got breaking news it's at
[1:55:14.400 --> 1:55:20.360]  info wars.com and natural news.com remember the UN model to shut down small
[1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:25.480]  farms is to say your pigs and cows are invasive it's not a certified you know
[1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:30.440]  big agri-facility so they announced all these dozens of old breeds if they have
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:34.960]  red hair black hair spots whatever or any other feature government is going to
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:40.320]  have quote armed raids arrest you and kill them calling it a feral hog problem
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:44.440]  it's hundreds of years of hogs getting out interbreeding and just going wild
[1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:49.840]  I've shot probably 20 of them or more I mean we've got a family ranch infested
[1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:54.040]  with them but that's not our pigs we used to raise regular pigs out there you
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:57.800]  know the regular old pink ones or and others I forget all the names of them
[1:55:57.800 --> 1:56:02.920]  the point is is that now they take that and use it as a way to create a new
[1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:06.280]  revenue people said oh they're not going to go on farms and kill them don't be a
[1:56:06.280 --> 1:56:11.480]  fair monger it's happened Michigan government unleashes arm raids on small
[1:56:11.480 --> 1:56:16.720]  pig farmers horses farmer to shoot all his own pigs armed raids it's all
[1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:22.360]  happening it's at info wars.com right now Mike Adams I want to give us some
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:25.760]  solutions real quicker with you but what do you make of the harassment the
[1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:31.360]  animal ID premises ID which then big agra is exempt from yeah that it all
[1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:37.320]  ties back to the NAIS which is the National Animal Identification System
[1:56:37.320 --> 1:56:42.520]  which was an abortive system they tried setting up several years ago but they
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:46.880]  never really quit they basically are doing the same thing and calling it a
[1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:52.680]  different name and you're right they will be exempting the major producers the
[1:56:52.680 --> 1:56:58.600]  same thing by the way is is in the works right now there's there's calls for
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:05.800]  veterinary medicines to be restricted to only being released by prescription and
[1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:10.600]  that's going to make it life difficult for small farmers and of course for
[1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:15.400]  anyone who's prepared this minded who's laid in a supply of inexpensive animal
[1:57:15.400 --> 1:57:19.520]  antibiotics to use in the event of a societal collapse well that's why I'll
[1:57:19.520 --> 1:57:25.120]  be going away and of course yeah they'll probably exempt major producers I
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:30.040]  recently wrote about that in my blog yeah they're gonna turn the DEA loose
[1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:34.720]  basically federal goons I mean everybody knows you're running even a hundred
[1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:39.000]  head of cattle you've got antibiotics you've got other shots you've got to
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:44.240]  give them you buy it from the vet you're not doing that anymore yeah of
[1:57:44.240 --> 1:57:47.560]  course it'll just be the small producers that they clamp down on don't they'll
[1:57:47.560 --> 1:57:53.360]  exempt the major producers and say oh well you won't require a veterinarian
[1:57:53.360 --> 1:57:59.480]  prescription but for anybody who has just a few cows or a few sheep or few goats
[1:57:59.480 --> 1:58:02.680]  then you're gonna be behind me and they're the ones that lied before it
[1:58:02.680 --> 1:58:07.360]  just last year 15 mil was spent in one week trying to put these safe food act
[1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:11.080]  through which was written by big agrit to shut down where you can't even pick
[1:58:11.080 --> 1:58:16.840]  strawberries and serve them to your neighbor I mean just total tyranny as I
[1:58:16.840 --> 1:58:19.640]  mentioned at the beginning of our conversation we are living in the age
[1:58:19.640 --> 1:58:24.200]  of deception and betrayal we're just about to cold-blooded multinational
[1:58:24.200 --> 1:58:27.700]  corporations that are monopoly men in an anti-free market say and turn this
[1:58:27.700 --> 1:58:31.680]  place into a prison if it didn't bought from our big box store it's shut down
[1:58:31.680 --> 1:58:36.720]  and the FBI and the rest of government's like yes sir we'll be back in 60

[2:01:06.040 --> 2:01:11.120]  12 bucks an hour my wife does you know we got a comfortable blue collar
[2:01:11.120 --> 2:01:15.720]  existence but that's it we don't have money for anything what do we do well I
[2:01:15.720 --> 2:01:22.760]  recommend that people reorder their their their budget priorities it's time
[2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:29.360]  for people to do away with their cable TV subscription time for them to sell
[2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:34.480]  their flat screen television sell their jet ski get back to the basics try to

[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:39.720]  squared away get a good quality water filter make arrangements to if you live
[2:02:39.720 --> 2:02:45.920]  in a typical suburban house to set up your downspouts so you can capture rain
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:52.760]  water off your roof get squared away with non-hybrid gardening seats if you
[2:02:52.760 --> 2:02:57.520]  don't have fencing to keep your keep beer out get the fencing in you're gonna
[2:02:57.520 --> 2:03:01.600]  have to plan through all these different things to be ready for the tough times
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:04.800]  ahead and by the way like you said you can do the rain water thing into
[2:03:04.800 --> 2:03:08.840]  barrels in incredibly inexpensively and I've got a rainwater collection system
[2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:12.640]  it's just incredibly good water comes off my metal roof into it I've got great
[2:03:12.640 --> 2:03:19.160]  water yeah I highly recommend that and for anyone who lives in in you know out
[2:03:19.160 --> 2:03:24.200]  in West Texas for example who lives in a fairly arid area if you don't have
[2:03:24.200 --> 2:03:31.760]  photovoltaics and are set up to pump water from a well with that you're you
[2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:35.920]  know six months out of the year you're gonna be out of luck so it's important
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:41.720]  that people get those things squared away and the available supplies on these
[2:03:41.720 --> 2:03:46.200]  things are actually fairly thin in the number of companies that do long-term
[2:03:46.200 --> 2:03:51.640]  storage food there's just a handful of them if if they're if the demand were
[2:03:51.640 --> 2:03:57.480]  to double and instead of 1% of the population preparing 2% prepared the
[2:03:57.480 --> 2:04:02.000]  the long-term storage food manufacturers could be completely overwhelmed and
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:06.520]  that's starting to already happen yeah and ditto though for people who make
[2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:13.840]  photovoltaics they're just aren't enough companies out there and enough
[2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:18.680]  panels on hand and unfortunately most of the systems that are going in right now
[2:04:18.680 --> 2:04:25.120]  are grid tied systems they can't revert to standalone operation because they're
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:28.680]  all that people are sucking from the government teeth and they want their
[2:04:28.680 --> 2:04:33.320]  tax deduction and they can only do that with a grid tied system and notice
[2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:38.400]  government only gives you a tax deduction when you tie into them right so
[2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:45.800]  people need to read again re-prioritize their budgets sell off the fruity and get
[2:04:45.800 --> 2:04:49.440]  those beans bullets and Band-Aid squared away I have a lot of details at my

[2:09:18.840 --> 2:09:24.160]  you can just use and have the internet like it's always gonna be here I mean I
[2:09:24.160 --> 2:09:28.360]  was reading the cyber security act that makes soap up look tame and it just says
[2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:32.120]  we'll do whatever we want we'll shut your website down for any reason internet
[2:09:32.120 --> 2:09:36.520]  IDs cast unsteen says arrest people that disagree with manmade global warming I
[2:09:36.520 --> 2:09:42.720]  mean these are authoritarians but they've learned the art to like poses
[2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:47.560]  liberals or to poses conservatives and act real friendly and have an ice cream
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:51.480]  cone like Warren Buffett does in most photo ops or or you know be like talk
[2:09:51.480 --> 2:09:56.840]  with a NPR list that is a Delphi technique well that's a technique
[2:09:56.840 --> 2:10:00.720]  specifically of getting people to tell you what they think and then going oh
[2:10:00.720 --> 2:10:05.040]  we'll do what you want you know you ask the crowd what do you want we want vanilla
[2:10:05.040 --> 2:10:11.280]  ice cream you go well I heard what you wanted you want strawberry but they just
[2:10:11.280 --> 2:10:17.520]  as long as they say it in that I want to go to some calls with our guest and by
[2:10:17.520 --> 2:10:22.600]  the way we sell his book survivors James Wesley Rawls he's an expert former
[2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:27.480]  army intelligence captain best-selling author and he runs survival blog comm
[2:10:27.480 --> 2:10:31.800]  as well but I want to get your take on that just the sickening shy off do you
[2:10:31.800 --> 2:10:35.480]  agree with me I mean I've I mean I know it's their cover but this whole
[2:10:35.480 --> 2:10:39.920]  non-threatening act they do to get you to comply then if you don't they sick
[2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:43.680]  the men in black uniforms on you but it's just this whole non-threatening
[2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:52.520]  cover yes I agree the the modus operandi seems to be it's what Mark from
[2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:56.800]  Michigan used to refer to as the iron fist in the velvet glove and what we're
[2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:05.080]  seeing is the velvet glove we're seeing you know all this man be Pambi green
[2:11:05.080 --> 2:11:14.840]  revolution kumbaya all this this whole mindset of global village you know all
[2:11:14.840 --> 2:11:24.280]  placed together to try to put a happy face on tyranny that's it let's go to
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:29.200]  some phone calls John in Texas you're on the air with our guests go ahead thanks
[2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:32.840]  a lot mr. Jones thank you for doing all that you do mr. Rawls I have a few
[2:11:32.840 --> 2:11:38.280]  questions for you sure go ahead one of the time please okay one of the time
[2:11:38.280 --> 2:11:45.800]  thank you a bit overwhelming if I try to talk to my family and try to warn them
[2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:51.200]  about things that are going on things that mr. Jones talk about daily and I
[2:11:51.200 --> 2:11:55.920]  get laughed at they call me crazy I sell them documents that I print off from a
[2:11:55.920 --> 2:12:03.960]  printer and so then one of my questions is when would it be time to say if it's
[2:12:03.960 --> 2:12:07.840]  not going to get any better it's going to get much worse when is it time for me
[2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:13.520]  to abandon my home and go somewhere else wow you don't want to give up a
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:19.400]  paying job in a down economy until you develop another income stream you know
[2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:23.360]  my blog is all oriented toward encouraging people to move to lightly
[2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:27.320]  populated rural farming areas that are well removed from major population
[2:12:27.320 --> 2:12:31.680]  centers but you know that's not going to work for everybody a lot of people have
[2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:34.600]  either family situations or work situations where they have to stay
[2:12:34.600 --> 2:12:41.120]  where they are if you can develop another income stream or find a job in a
[2:12:41.120 --> 2:12:46.640]  lightly populated area I recommend you go ahead and make the move down but to
[2:12:46.640 --> 2:12:52.800]  throw away a good-paying job in today's down economy I think it's foolish if you
[2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:57.320]  really don't want to make the move until you have another income exactly you want
[2:12:57.320 --> 2:13:01.560]  to start building with just the firearm the water being prepared warning others
[2:13:01.560 --> 2:13:06.760]  a laugh at you now not later and then begin to start looking for areas where
[2:13:06.760 --> 2:13:13.040]  could I go somewhere rural and even if the job pays less it the it costs less
[2:13:13.040 --> 2:13:17.840]  to live there and so just start developing a plan I agree wholeheartedly
[2:13:17.840 --> 2:13:23.600]  and it's important that people think these things through be prayerful about
[2:13:23.600 --> 2:13:28.700]  it because you want to have God's guidance on this and once you're
[2:13:28.700 --> 2:13:34.300]  committed though then go ahead then it's time to you know go ahead sell your
[2:13:34.300 --> 2:13:39.920]  house make the move and it's important to make a move fairly soon because you
[2:13:39.920 --> 2:13:43.880]  know I did I get so many emails for people to say oh well I have this cabin
[2:13:43.880 --> 2:13:47.960]  prepared out in the woods in the polka-nose or wherever and I'm all
[2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:51.480]  gone I'll pull through just fine there but people don't realize how long it
[2:13:51.480 --> 2:13:55.960]  takes to build up for self-sufficiency you need to plant fruit and nut trees that
[2:13:55.960 --> 2:14:00.920]  takes years you need to practice gardening in that particular climate that
[2:14:00.920 --> 2:14:05.040]  takes time and experience you need to learn how to you know how to cook on a
[2:14:05.040 --> 2:14:09.600]  wood stove you don't learn that sort of thing just overnight so it's important
[2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:12.760]  that you that you make the move and start living and you need to meet the
[2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:16.400]  neighbors because oh yeah because you don't want to even really at first be
[2:14:16.400 --> 2:14:19.840]  little friendly but you're really just getting intelligence on them you'll
[2:14:19.840 --> 2:14:23.760]  find out who's good and you'll find out also who's a little global minion and
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:28.760]  believe me they're out there too right and if you don't want to be the
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:34.320]  expendable new guy the guy who just blew into town at the 11th hour just before
[2:14:34.320 --> 2:14:38.200]  everything fell apart you want to become part of the community you want to get
[2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:43.560]  involved in the local EMT or fire department volunteer fire yes example
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:48.080]  it's important to be part of the community because you want to be seen as
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:52.760]  an insider not an outsider exactly all right God bless you hope that answers
[2:14:52.760 --> 2:14:57.800]  your excellent question John and and what about people that are handicapped
[2:14:57.800 --> 2:15:01.840]  what about I mean they are going to be in deep trouble well yeah I get letters
[2:15:01.840 --> 2:15:05.720]  all the time from people who have sleep apnea people who have chronic medical
[2:15:05.720 --> 2:15:10.960]  conditions you need to plan ahead for all those people who are diabetics for
[2:15:10.960 --> 2:15:14.960]  example a lot of I get the same questions over and over again from type
[2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:18.880]  people who are diabetic for example but well you know how do I keep my insulin
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:24.240]  cold well do you have photovoltaics yeah I do or do you have a good old-fashioned
[2:15:24.240 --> 2:15:29.200]  surveil propane powered refrigerator or do you know how to go dig a 10-foot hole
[2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:34.120]  into the stone under your house to keep it cold in there right yeah people need
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:38.400]  to think these things through if they have particular medical needs they need
[2:15:38.400 --> 2:15:41.960]  to plan for them I mean even just people who wear prescription glasses need to
[2:15:41.960 --> 2:15:46.840]  plan ahead and there's places like a zene optical on the Internet I've linked
[2:15:46.840 --> 2:15:50.720]  to them at my website where you can buy literally buy four pairs of glasses for
[2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:57.320]  $30 people need to think through their own particular needs for their own
[2:15:57.320 --> 2:16:01.480]  particular medical conditions their own requirements their own physical
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:08.160]  conditions the climates that they can handle living in and so forth they call
[2:16:08.160 --> 2:16:12.000]  these things true yeah just think about Katrina the government can't and won't
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:15.640]  protect you and if this country had ten Katrina's at once and that's kind of
[2:16:15.640 --> 2:16:19.200]  what a depressions like it's just gonna degenerate I mean you had a many of the
[2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:25.960]  police there robbing local stores folks so you in a lot of areas obviously not
[2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:30.200]  like New Orleans but you know heaven help us look because the government is
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:35.640]  trying to recruit either low-grade morons or criminals right now and it's a big
[2:16:35.640 --> 2:16:42.680]  threat Houston in Texas that's kind of a pun I welcome Houston yes I got a
[2:16:42.680 --> 2:16:47.560]  question for my time here trucking right now and I'm gonna see if he had any
[2:16:47.560 --> 2:16:53.240]  advice from truckers out here that I say it went down right now you know all
[2:16:53.240 --> 2:16:57.080]  that trips and all that went down we couldn't get no fuel no nothing we be
[2:16:57.080 --> 2:17:02.120]  I'm gonna tell the cops we'd be far from the house so do you have any ideas what
[2:17:02.120 --> 2:17:07.520]  to do on that well in terms of planning ahead for fuel I recommend that people
[2:17:07.520 --> 2:17:11.200]  buy the biggest propane tank they could find if they have any vehicles that are
[2:17:11.200 --> 2:17:16.120]  diesel engine put in a big diesel tank there's really no point putting in a
[2:17:16.120 --> 2:17:21.280]  huge gas tank for unleaded gasoline because it doesn't store more than three
[2:17:21.280 --> 2:17:25.840]  or four years tops even with a stabilizer but if you've got the budget
[2:17:25.840 --> 2:17:30.560]  stock up on propane because it stores indefinitely stock up on diesel fuel
[2:17:30.560 --> 2:17:34.840]  because it'll store for 10 plus years you want to add a antimicrobial like
[2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:41.080]  pridey to it to make it store better but fuel storage is crucial especially for
[2:17:41.080 --> 2:17:46.720]  people who live up in the northern states if you don't have three or four
[2:17:46.720 --> 2:17:51.000]  chords of firewood stacked up you're behind the power curve you really need
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:55.280]  yeah good old-fashioned wood is the way to go and if everything starts crumbling
[2:17:55.280 --> 2:17:59.600]  it's gonna be hard to get the wood you need to get it now yeah and people need
[2:17:59.600 --> 2:18:03.480]  to think ahead in terms of having gasoline for their chainsaws and spare
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:11.320]  chains and gas stabilizer and especially two-stroke oil for mixing chainsaw gas
[2:18:11.320 --> 2:18:16.720]  people will get this like gold absolutely people that are obsessed with
[2:18:16.720 --> 2:18:21.360]  guns get obsessed about other things that you need to survive it's people should
[2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:24.680]  be just as obsessed about communications equipment about first aid
[2:18:24.680 --> 2:18:30.800]  gear about fuel storage about gardening they need to have that same level of
[2:18:30.800 --> 2:18:36.400]  interest because if you if you're only fixated on guns you don't have a
[2:18:36.400 --> 2:18:39.360]  complete set of preparations the fact you're setting yourself up to be part
[2:18:39.360 --> 2:18:43.360]  of the problem because if the only cool you have as a hammer every fit every
[2:18:43.360 --> 2:18:48.080]  problem looks like a nail okay and if you only have guns you're gonna end up
[2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:51.120]  being part of the problem you're gonna end up preying on your neighbors if you
[2:18:51.120 --> 2:18:57.400]  can't garden for your own food or raise your own livestock yeah that's really a
[2:18:57.400 --> 2:19:00.480]  terrible thing it's what the studies that another US Army's done them and
[2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:03.960]  other government's groups have done them what is it within seven days most
[2:19:03.960 --> 2:19:07.760]  people without food become total criminals within ten days they start
[2:19:07.760 --> 2:19:12.800]  becoming just just rampaging killers and within 15 what is it like 98% become
[2:19:12.800 --> 2:19:16.680]  cannibals it could come down to that yeah that's one of the things I described
[2:19:16.680 --> 2:19:23.760]  in my novel yeah and then of course films like the road unfortunately if you
[2:19:23.760 --> 2:19:28.560]  weren't really want to see human nature the road did a really good job of
[2:19:28.560 --> 2:19:33.960]  showing it at its real core because you know I'm a Christian and I'm gonna do
[2:19:33.960 --> 2:19:38.720]  my very best to act in a Christian manner and be charitable to others but
[2:19:38.720 --> 2:19:43.080]  when you come right down to it which if you peel back all the all the layers of
[2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:47.280]  civilization what's underneath is what you saw in the road it's not very pretty
[2:19:47.280 --> 2:19:51.400]  underneath I see I wouldn't kill people for myself but I probably would for my
[2:19:51.400 --> 2:19:55.960]  children I'll be honest I mean I might start roasting people I'm being
[2:19:55.960 --> 2:19:59.840]  sarcastic folks we'll be right back stay with us

[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  packed final 30 minutes here in the next segment Mike Adams pops in for about
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:27.160]  10 minutes then I'm gonna premiere the footage they shot of the police tell them
[2:24:27.160 --> 2:24:31.080]  they couldn't go in the building there in Roswell Georgia and some other
[2:24:31.080 --> 2:24:34.560]  incredible news so much of it we never even get to on the air it's all at
[2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:39.680]  infallwars.com and prisonplanet.com in fact the featured news is coming in so
[2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:44.280]  fast I'm gonna add a link saying top stories at the top of the site so that
[2:24:44.280 --> 2:24:48.360]  all the articles we're writing and the research goes there so people start
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:52.760]  clicking on that another thing is infallwars.com forward slash feed that's
[2:24:52.760 --> 2:24:56.520]  the RSS feed that gets a lot of stuff that rolls off we've just got a
[2:24:56.520 --> 2:24:59.760]  reengineer of the site because there's so much information up there and so many
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:05.440]  times an incredible article just just just that goes away. Mr. Rawls we were
[2:25:05.440 --> 2:25:09.800]  talking during the break and you were discussing the IRA versus an American
[2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:13.160]  resistance and the difference is firearms briefly tell folks about that.
[2:25:13.160 --> 2:25:20.640]  Sure as I mentioned in the peace process in northern Ireland a few years
[2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:25.080]  back it all came down to just a few hundred guns when they were trying to
[2:25:25.080 --> 2:25:30.200]  decommission the IRA units and we're talking two or three hundred guns was
[2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:36.200]  was all that it took to hold up the peace process here by contrast the
[2:25:36.200 --> 2:25:39.560]  United States we have millions of guns in fact million more than a million
[2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:44.720]  sold every month in the United States going into private hands. I've seen
[2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:49.000]  numbers of over five million guns sold per month. Yeah it's a huge number of
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:54.560]  guns it's absolutely impossible to disarm the American people and in any
[2:25:54.560 --> 2:25:59.360]  globalist who has some fantasy of disarming the American people it is
[2:25:59.360 --> 2:26:05.080]  absolutely diluted it's never going to happen even if 95% or 98% of our
[2:26:05.080 --> 2:26:09.440]  population foolishly turned in their guns there still would be more than
[2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:12.880]  enough guns to engage in a war of resistance here in the United States.
[2:26:12.880 --> 2:26:19.000]  Well let's say there's 200 million guns I mean it's the last 20 years or so but
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:22.520]  really it's more like 400 million they estimate good working guns out there
[2:26:22.520 --> 2:26:25.800]  right and let's say there's a hundred and sixty million gun owners it's
[2:26:25.800 --> 2:26:32.120]  growing let's say 1% decides to fight we're talking about what is that a
[2:26:32.120 --> 2:26:37.520]  million six hundred thousand people yeah that's and that's four times the size
[2:26:37.520 --> 2:26:44.120]  of our military I mean the numbers would be totally lopsided and it for a
[2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:47.480]  guerrilla warfare situation you don't even have to fight at the one-to-one
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:54.920]  ratio so it there's absolutely no way that and I described this in my novel
[2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:59.080]  Patriots and sequel survivors there's no way that the American people could ever
[2:26:59.080 --> 2:27:05.280]  be disarmed and even if there is an attempt to disarm them they'll I was
[2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:12.480]  about to say that can't be one it'll be a guerrilla war that there's only one
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:16.960]  logical conclusion one inevitable conclusion that is that our
[2:27:16.960 --> 2:27:21.520]  constitutional republic will be restored well the enemy's using psi
[2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:25.640]  options instead but but that's not working anymore Congress has a 9% approval
[2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:29.480]  rating and I never wanted to go to this but let's say they arrest Alex Jones
[2:27:29.480 --> 2:27:34.400]  disappear me you know it's a hardcore tyranny all this just continues they
[2:27:34.400 --> 2:27:39.120]  start trying to come and pick people up if you've got 1% and it's gonna be way
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:42.280]  more than that I think it'll probably be 10% of the owners at some point will
[2:27:42.280 --> 2:27:47.760]  resist but if 1% a million six hundred thousand went out and simply went after
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:53.160]  one bad guy and then never were seen again you know boom it's about Mark
[2:27:53.160 --> 2:27:56.840]  Corny he uses the moose hunting license you have to get in a lottery just to
[2:27:56.840 --> 2:28:01.880]  maybe get the moose hunting license it's it's not like my point is they always
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:05.560]  show the military all these weapons most the military I talked to are awakened
[2:28:05.560 --> 2:28:09.200]  on our side more than general public and so this idea of oh we can't fight the
[2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:12.440]  government if it comes to that I don't want that because the globalists will sit
[2:28:12.440 --> 2:28:18.120]  offshore and you know let the civil war drag on I'd rather with the truth psi
[2:28:18.120 --> 2:28:23.000]  op them and get them to join reality but if the system goes to some Soviet
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:27.480]  Russia type deal this is not going to be like the NKVD and nobody would stand up
[2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:32.880]  to them and Alexander Shultz needs a bemoan that yes we have a different
[2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:40.600]  situation here in the States again if a guerrilla war situation ever develops
[2:28:40.600 --> 2:28:46.400]  God help any anyone who tries to enforce it on enforced tyranny on the
[2:28:46.400 --> 2:28:51.880]  United States it won't last long yeah the system set up all the tyranny now
[2:28:51.880 --> 2:28:54.800]  they're just not fully implementing they're kind of like waiting at the edge
[2:28:54.800 --> 2:29:00.440]  of a cliff yeah the bureaucratic approach the incremental approach seems
[2:29:00.440 --> 2:29:03.600]  to have been working for them but if they try to implement anything in a hurry
[2:29:03.600 --> 2:29:09.160]  it'll be a huge backlash but that's the issue even the incremental at a certain
[2:29:09.160 --> 2:29:12.880]  point hits a flashpoint and it's coming to that I think we are approaching it
[2:29:12.880 --> 2:29:18.400]  yes well I'll be praying for all your listeners Alex that they put themselves
[2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:21.800]  in the right place at the right time with the right people yeah we didn't even
[2:29:21.800 --> 2:29:25.240]  get to many of the calls promise us in the next month or so you'll come back
[2:29:25.240 --> 2:29:29.480]  and just take calls okay I'll be happy to let me say about here in the break folks

[2:30:03.360 --> 2:30:07.800]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[2:30:07.800 --> 2:30:11.840]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[2:30:11.840 --> 2:30:15.240]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:30:15.240 --> 2:30:19.760]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:30:19.760 --> 2:30:24.320]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:30:24.320 --> 2:30:28.360]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:30:28.360 --> 2:30:32.160]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[2:30:32.160 --> 2:30:35.760]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[2:34:10.400 --> 2:34:14.480]  demonize the American people just a brief interview now breaking news at
[2:34:14.480 --> 2:34:22.200]  naturalnews.com it's also one of the top stories at info wars.com and that is
[2:34:22.200 --> 2:34:26.640]  Michigan government unleashes armed raids on small pig farmers forces
[2:34:26.640 --> 2:34:31.120]  farmer to shoot all his own pigs sing their invasive species and they wrote
[2:34:31.120 --> 2:34:36.160]  it where they said black hair brown hair red hair or any other trait they say
[2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:39.920]  could be connected to being feral they kill them well all pigs if they get out
[2:34:39.920 --> 2:34:45.240]  over time grow longer hair and tusk it's all the same thing and this is a new way
[2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:49.200]  to shut down small farms and ranches and the UN said they'll do this they're
[2:34:49.200 --> 2:34:54.120]  gonna start they're saying dogs and cats are invasive so without warrants they
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:34:59.960]  did this it's amazing joining us from his evil farm is Mike Adams the health
[2:34:59.960 --> 2:35:04.440]  ranger Mike we were conspiracy theorists saying the law read they were gonna send
[2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:08.240]  armed people out without warrants and kill pigs and arrest people but it's it's
[2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:12.040]  now beginning instead of stopping the feral pigs that have been out there for
[2:35:12.040 --> 2:35:17.400]  a hundred years they're saying pigs and pins are bad government uses any crisis
[2:35:17.400 --> 2:35:23.840]  for a power grab Mike Adams yeah one week ago Alex we had Mark Baker on on
[2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:26.760]  your show he was one of the feature guests and he described what was
[2:35:26.760 --> 2:35:30.160]  happening there in Michigan and I remember seeing some of the comments
[2:35:30.160 --> 2:35:34.800]  people said oh this can't be true it's a conspiracy theory well as it has happened
[2:35:34.800 --> 2:35:38.400]  in the last couple of days just over the weekend the DNR that's the Department
[2:35:38.400 --> 2:35:43.800]  of Natural Resources in Michigan has conducted two armed raids now they left
[2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:48.120]  alone mark Baker because he was willing to speak out and because he said I'll be
[2:35:48.120 --> 2:35:52.280]  waiting for you and he was waiting for them so they selectively targeted the
[2:35:52.280 --> 2:35:56.880]  week and the helpless in this case senior citizen farmers a man who's about
[2:35:56.880 --> 2:36:01.440]  65 years old they targeted his farm and he has a worker who's 75 years old who
[2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:07.160]  they interrogated they brought in six vehicles ten men with guns to conduct
[2:36:07.160 --> 2:36:12.160]  this raid and in anticipation of that raid happening one of these farmers had
[2:36:12.160 --> 2:36:16.300]  to go through the heart wrenching activity of putting a bullet through the
[2:36:16.300 --> 2:36:20.840]  heads of his own pigs in order to avoid being arrested as a felon before the
[2:36:20.840 --> 2:36:25.040]  DNR arrived so what we have now Alex let me give you the names and the facts of
[2:36:25.040 --> 2:36:29.640]  this case in Calcasca County one raid conducted at Fife Lake is the town name
[2:36:29.640 --> 2:36:34.360]  the rancher there is Dave Tuxbury another raid in Sheboygan County at
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:39.360]  Renegade Ranch Ron McKendrick was the victim farmer targeted there by the
[2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:43.760]  DNR he is going to appear in court this Friday there's a hearing in Sheboygan
[2:36:43.760 --> 2:36:47.240]  County and all those listening who can attend and help support this are invited
[2:36:47.240 --> 2:36:51.320]  to come there at 9 a.m. there's going to be a court hearing and he's going to
[2:36:51.320 --> 2:36:55.840]  present a legal strategy to try to to fight back against this total outrageous
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:36:59.920]  tyranny something that I'm calling domestic terrorism by Michigan
[2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:03.480]  government thugs these people need to be arrested Alex that's what's happening
[2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:06.240]  in Michigan today that's right and that's what they said in the law they
[2:37:06.240 --> 2:37:11.160]  said felony charges arrest huge fines and we'll come up without warrants and
[2:37:11.160 --> 2:37:14.800]  kill them so instead they just said we're gonna be nice kill your pigs and we
[2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:20.840]  won't arrest you and again I read the law on air weeks ago it said any
[2:37:20.840 --> 2:37:25.760]  characteristic that we say even if it's not recognized as quote being feral
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:31.040]  and they say black spots brown hair red hair I mean that there are hundreds of
[2:37:31.040 --> 2:37:34.400]  breeds of pig that look like that you see them at that I took my kids the
[2:37:34.400 --> 2:37:38.360]  livestock show that were pigs with black hair pigs with red hair and of course
[2:37:38.360 --> 2:37:43.000]  these wild pigs get out breed but it's not the people who have pigs that they
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:47.320]  say might have characteristics of a feral hog that are causing the problem I
[2:37:47.320 --> 2:37:52.480]  mean this is so amazing how there is a feral hog problem across the country but
[2:37:52.480 --> 2:37:55.780]  instead of saying hey folks you see feral hogs kill them having a public
[2:37:55.780 --> 2:38:01.160]  service announcement instead they just say it makes you a crime you know they
[2:38:01.160 --> 2:38:04.360]  can't find enough folks to bust free legal drugs the government ships in so
[2:38:04.360 --> 2:38:09.960]  now it's your invasive pig or it's your animal ID your premises ID this is but
[2:38:09.960 --> 2:38:13.640]  remember Mike we were wrong to warn of this but now it's happening it's
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:18.480]  absolutely happening remember a feral pig is merely a fig a pig outside the
[2:38:18.480 --> 2:38:22.120]  fence so these pigs were inside the fence they were domesticated they were
[2:38:22.120 --> 2:38:26.200]  livestock they've been raised year after year for a long time so now we have the
[2:38:26.200 --> 2:38:31.080]  state of Michigan criminalizing livestock they are a gang of unindicted
[2:38:31.080 --> 2:38:35.000]  criminals running loose with guns across the state of Michigan forcing farmers
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:38.200]  to murder their own livestock and there's no indication that they're only
[2:38:38.200 --> 2:38:41.000]  going to stop with pigs they could do this with birds with chickens with
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:44.600]  certain types of cows with goats they could just add to their list and go
[2:38:44.600 --> 2:38:48.520]  around murdering just slaughtering animals let me let me explain this for
[2:38:48.520 --> 2:38:54.680]  people who don't understand farming the the beautiful Texas longhorn is really
[2:38:54.680 --> 2:38:59.760]  a 3,000 year old they think it goes back even before the Romans but at least
[2:38:59.760 --> 2:39:07.400]  2,000 year old Roman breed of cow bovine that was then brought into Spain by the
[2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:12.680]  Romans the Spanish then 500 years ago just like horses brought them in they
[2:39:12.680 --> 2:39:16.720]  went wild like Mustang horses that are identical to you know regular breed of
[2:39:16.720 --> 2:39:20.160]  horses you can catch capture them domesticate them breed them make great
[2:39:20.160 --> 2:39:24.280]  work horses some of the best you know great arrange horses for riding fence
[2:39:24.280 --> 2:39:29.360]  that is called an invasive species because it's a feral cow they're
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:33.600]  actually pretty well behaved and and a good breed to have very handsome as well
[2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:38.160]  the point is and they can live on scrub brush a very hardy cow it's a
[2:39:38.160 --> 2:39:42.480]  Spanish cow but even goes back to the Romans like the bull mastiff dog they
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:46.200]  take pigs that were that were domesticated they get out they're wild and
[2:39:46.200 --> 2:39:49.560]  now they're saying if your pigs look like what wild pigs look like we're
[2:39:49.560 --> 2:39:52.880]  gonna kill them and then the guy who goes on your show my show when you were
[2:39:52.880 --> 2:39:57.640]  sitting in they raid him they picked him as an example that's the breaking news
[2:39:57.640 --> 2:40:02.920]  here Mike no the correction there they avoided him they raided other farmers
[2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:06.160]  who they saw as more vulnerable who weren't speaking I was confused and I
[2:40:06.160 --> 2:40:09.680]  thought you said it was the same guy oh I got a warning about it right I may have
[2:40:09.680 --> 2:40:14.960]  misspoke mark Baker at bakersgreenacres.com he was left alone because he
[2:40:14.960 --> 2:40:18.680]  said we're waiting for you and he went public and he filmed the video with his
[2:40:18.680 --> 2:40:22.520]  family and the farm and everything so the DNR wouldn't touch him instead they
[2:40:22.520 --> 2:40:26.640]  went after other friends in the industry who are also raising pigs who they saw
[2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:33.080]  as defenseless so another legal tactic that they use Alex is the state DNR
[2:40:33.080 --> 2:40:37.120]  officials could not get a warrant in the counties where the farms existed so
[2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:43.000]  they got warrants in other counties and then use that as a an unconstitutional
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:46.680]  justification to come in and trespass on their property to violate the Fourth
[2:40:46.680 --> 2:40:51.040]  Amendment rights and then force them to make sure they slaughtered their own
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:55.900]  pigs in order to avoid being arrested as felons this is this is outrageous Alex
[2:40:55.900 --> 2:41:01.400]  this is the end of basic fundamental farming freedom in Michigan we've got
[2:41:01.400 --> 2:41:04.080]  to stand up to this and that's why I've called for the public arrest of these
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:08.120]  DNR officials we're gonna have a citizen's posse out there arresting
[2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:13.440]  these tyrants well bottom line now we've got our east Texas property we
[2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:18.560]  leased it out for some deer hunting and in in my dad's entire life he's never
[2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:24.840]  seen federally funded task forces of game wardens spilling onto our property
[2:41:24.840 --> 2:41:31.880]  and being very bossy and and now you're taking a deer in to get it
[2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:36.200]  processed state police pull you over scream out you like you're a criminal
[2:41:36.200 --> 2:41:40.040]  even though you've got the tags and everything they're looking for people
[2:41:40.040 --> 2:41:43.440]  to throw in prison we've got the biggest prison population out there so now
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:48.960]  they're gonna say that all these small pig farms are invasive and they say any
[2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:53.240]  pig we want we can say has characteristics it says they can say
[2:41:53.240 --> 2:41:57.080]  whatever they want and who's funding this big agro wants the small chicken
[2:41:57.080 --> 2:42:01.000]  producers shut down on record they're financing that they want small beef
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  production shut down I was just talking about it with our guest earlier how
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:08.560]  they're saying people can't do veterinary work on their own animals now
[2:42:08.560 --> 2:42:15.160]  which is standard for those that don't know it's all agenda 21 and that's what's
[2:42:15.160 --> 2:42:19.720]  happening here they say in agenda 21 all farm animals are invasive and they
[2:42:19.720 --> 2:42:23.320]  want to abolish the practice of eating meat and our brainwashing school
[2:42:23.320 --> 2:42:27.640]  children right now it's all happening it's part of the takeover they've done
[2:42:27.640 --> 2:42:32.200]  it in Europe in many areas we have got to resist this legally and lawfully
[2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:36.760]  Alex in in great contrast to the new Black Panthers who were calling for
[2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:40.280]  shooting whitey and so on what we are calling for at least what what I'm
[2:42:40.280 --> 2:42:47.160]  calling for is the legal lawful armed citizens arrest of the these renegade
[2:42:47.160 --> 2:42:51.440]  government tyrants who are slaughtering the livestock of farmers who are
[2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:56.240]  operating under complete compliance with USDA regulations and even existing
[2:42:56.240 --> 2:42:59.880]  Michigan regulations for farming they're not doing anything illegal you think
[2:42:59.880 --> 2:43:02.920]  ever running drugs or cooking meth or something by the way the rate of the
[2:43:02.920 --> 2:43:06.600]  gunpoint but no they're just raising livestock Alex it's insane if we don't
[2:43:06.600 --> 2:43:11.720]  stop Michigan now what else are they gonna come up with where does this end
[2:43:11.720 --> 2:43:15.720]  Mike we're gonna get an update from you tomorrow here on the radio maybe even
[2:43:15.720 --> 2:43:19.120]  the nightly news tonight this is this is just incredible but again people said
[2:43:19.120 --> 2:43:22.800]  all your misinterpreting that that's not gonna happen they'll never have the
[2:43:22.800 --> 2:43:26.800]  IRS checkpoints and I'll let you travel if you hadn't paid the quote tax now
[2:43:26.800 --> 2:43:30.320]  it's passed the Senate in the house they'd never secretly arrest Americans
[2:43:30.320 --> 2:43:36.160]  and kill us now law they'd never spawn us without warrants now law I mean there
[2:43:36.160 --> 2:43:39.960]  is no doubt that they have sent out swarms of agents to eat out our
[2:43:39.960 --> 2:43:43.760]  substance Mike Adams thank you for breaking this information thank you
[2:43:43.760 --> 2:43:46.400]  Alex great to join you today and a great guest you had on earlier with James
[2:43:46.400 --> 2:43:49.920]  Wesley Rawls awesome guy thank you well so many great people out there fighting
[2:43:49.920 --> 2:43:54.160]  this tyranny we're gonna do it together okay I want to go to this report people
[2:43:54.160 --> 2:44:01.240]  kept saying show us the video of the police saying you can't film in Georgia
[2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:08.840]  there in the town where the man had the chickens and the agenda 21 zoning said
[2:44:08.840 --> 2:44:11.800]  it was gonna be a green space he kept beating them in court they said he
[2:44:11.800 --> 2:44:14.960]  couldn't have chickens so his chickens all got poisoned and then suddenly this
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:19.800]  house blew up we went to Roswell Georgia Darren McBrain and Marcos Morales
[2:44:19.800 --> 2:44:23.560]  our reporters to investigate this and the police pull up in front of the big
[2:44:23.560 --> 2:44:27.120]  old city hall building and get in their face and tell them they can't go inside
[2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:32.000]  and then they watch other people go inside and take photos and stuff so here
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:37.400]  is part of that report with the Darren McBrain and Marcos Morales from Georgia
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:44.600]  the proof that the police did this like it was North Korea here it is I'm not
[2:44:44.600 --> 2:44:49.880]  recording okay no reason to record you so in order to talk to them do we have
[2:44:49.880 --> 2:44:55.040]  to write something first or I don't understand we're with KLB Jane free

[2:47:27.880 --> 2:47:32.960]  regarding cameras yeah we don't allow without a permit I don't know the tool
[2:47:32.960 --> 2:47:36.800]  with a press I told him to turn his camera off but the credentials are there
[2:47:36.800 --> 2:47:42.160]  permit for a camera in America here's what I can tell you what I would do
[2:47:42.160 --> 2:47:46.840]  contact you and that's the person he talked to I have no idea who you talk
[2:47:46.840 --> 2:47:51.360]  yes man I just try to read it all I don't know it'd be sorry to find that
[2:47:51.360 --> 2:47:56.400]  lady short hair yeah well that's why we're here we're here to figure all
[2:47:56.400 --> 2:48:01.680]  these facts out well if you would have said that to begin with then I could
[2:48:01.680 --> 2:48:05.440]  have referred you to the right place but I believe you talked with Julie and she
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:10.560]  said you'll wait she didn't send me away she didn't tell me to leave she didn't
[2:48:10.560 --> 2:48:15.120]  express any interest in me not you add you did you not ask her if the city
[2:48:15.120 --> 2:48:19.880]  council was here that's exactly and what did she say she said they're not
[2:48:19.880 --> 2:48:25.120]  here so I said okay let me go out and in my I didn't tell her where I was going
[2:48:25.120 --> 2:48:28.640]  she didn't tell me to leave in my head I decided I'm gonna go out and confer with
[2:48:28.640 --> 2:48:35.000]  my reporter to figure out the next move you should go back in there and ask her
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:39.080]  if she wouldn't mind us shooting some footage nothing I'm curious about and
[2:48:39.080 --> 2:48:42.360]  like you said we had to be authorized media but why wouldn't a person with a
[2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:48.120]  video camera like I'm from Austin Texas we have a huge city hall and we are we
[2:48:48.120 --> 2:48:53.360]  can walk in with cameras and just hey how you doing sir and talk to people up
