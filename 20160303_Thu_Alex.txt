[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:33.000]  simply incredible about 15 minutes ago I got done watching as I prepared for the
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.200]  broadcast in the control room met Romney falling on his sword politically for the
[00:39.200 --> 00:44.580]  Republican establishment it was clearly disgusting I came off like bad comedy
[00:44.580 --> 00:52.320]  Donald Trump is not a good businessman he is bad he is a fraud a con artist a
[00:52.320 --> 01:01.000]  phony and then gave no evidence and they're clearly positioning him to run
[01:01.160 --> 01:08.640]  that is disgusting horse race live wire Breitbart met Romney pledges to hit
[01:08.640 --> 01:14.080]  Trump harder than he ever did Obama absolutely the fix is in and the
[01:14.080 --> 01:18.160]  Republican establishment is panicking another big story for Breitbart it's
[01:18.160 --> 01:24.800]  up on info wars.com we told you about that meeting last Thursday the
[01:24.800 --> 01:27.680]  political admitted happened but with secret 200 top political donors and
[01:27.680 --> 01:32.760]  Rubio and now they were gonna appoint the head of Rubio's campaign was going to
[01:32.760 --> 01:37.000]  be the Koch brothers chief political strategist that then happened Roger
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.240]  Stone put up the video Friday night went viral on Drudge to millions of readers
[01:42.240 --> 01:48.720]  well it wasn't just Roger Stone that had somebody in the audience in that
[01:48.720 --> 01:55.960]  meeting a mole for liberty it was recorded by a Breitbart operative and
[01:55.960 --> 02:00.800]  it's them in there how to steal the election how to raise the money how to
[02:00.800 --> 02:07.640]  have a broker convention for Marco Rubio it's incredible Roger Stone's coming on
[02:07.640 --> 02:11.480]  in the second hour we're gonna play the tape here the articles at info wars.com
[02:11.480 --> 02:14.920]  drudgereport.com is linked to it and obviously where it originates from
[02:14.920 --> 02:20.400]  Breitbart.com. Breitbart does more journalistic work with with all their
[02:20.400 --> 02:26.120]  divisions Breitbart, Texas you name it and their people then really really any
[02:26.120 --> 02:29.160]  other media organization out there more and more along the world that daily of
[02:29.160 --> 02:33.600]  course drudge aggregating and all and helping you know put anti-establishment
[02:33.600 --> 02:36.600]  talking points out there but really got to come in them and of course info wars
[02:36.600 --> 02:40.200]  is here but a lot of investigative journalism as well analysis and
[02:40.200 --> 02:45.720]  historical review and breaking through globalist disinformation and really
[02:45.720 --> 02:49.760]  putting out again counter narratives to their globalist world government system
[02:49.760 --> 02:54.560]  and exposing the whole technocracy but the point is there is a new burgeoning
[02:54.560 --> 02:58.240]  media that isn't the alternative media we are the new media and that's becoming
[02:58.240 --> 03:01.720]  more evident every day so the system was to come in with censorship show we can't
[03:01.720 --> 03:08.080]  go back into the memory hole as we do and show you the flip-flopping show you
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.000]  the deceptions show you Obama promising you wouldn't come after his guns or your
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.240]  guns but then he does or you can keep your doctor but you can't now Mitt Romney
[03:16.240 --> 03:21.200]  says that Donald Trump is the worst thing on earth basically if you only had
[03:21.200 --> 03:26.720]  those type of words for Obama but he didn't got him for Donald Trump as the
[03:26.720 --> 03:30.840]  establishment is the panic button well what about all the flashbacks to the
[03:30.840 --> 03:37.880]  endorsements that he made and the endorsement he got from Trump that he
[03:37.880 --> 03:44.560]  grobbled for here it is Donald Trump has shown an extraordinary ability to
[03:44.560 --> 03:48.920]  understand how our economy works to create jobs for the American people he's
[03:48.920 --> 03:52.960]  done it here in Nevada he's done it across the country he understands that
[03:52.960 --> 03:57.280]  our economy is facing threats from abroad he's one of the few people who
[03:57.280 --> 04:00.960]  stood up and said you know what China has been cheating they've they've taken
[04:00.960 --> 04:04.440]  jobs from Americans they haven't played fair we have to have a president who
[04:04.440 --> 04:07.960]  will stand up to cheaters we believe in free trade of free enterprise but we
[04:07.960 --> 04:11.360]  don't believe in allowing people to cheat day in and day out I spent my life
[04:11.360 --> 04:15.280]  in the private sector not quite as successful as this guy but successful
[04:15.280 --> 04:19.960]  nonetheless sufficiently successful to understand what it takes to get America
[04:19.960 --> 04:24.480]  to be the most attractive place in the world for innovators entrepreneurs and
[04:24.480 --> 04:29.800]  business and job creators I think it's time for us to recognize we can't keep
[04:29.800 --> 04:35.080]  going down the road we're on we have to dramatically change course so I want to
[04:35.080 --> 04:39.160]  say thank you now based on he wants to thank Donald Trump so there you go now
[04:39.160 --> 04:42.520]  we've seen the reverse of that today we've got clips of that coming up as
[04:42.520 --> 04:47.080]  well Roger Stone joins us mark dice on his new book the Illuminati in Hollywood
[04:47.080 --> 04:51.840]  and how that ties into the secret rituals and things Bohemian Grove and
[04:51.840 --> 04:57.640]  Justice Scalia's death and part of a secret society it's all coming up today
[04:57.640 --> 05:01.920]  we are quickly approaching the five-year anniversary of Osama bin Laden's
[05:01.920 --> 05:05.560]  supposed death at the hands of Navy SEALs and to commemorate this the Obama
[05:05.560 --> 05:10.960]  administration released 113 documents that were seized in the May 2nd 2011 raid
[05:10.960 --> 05:14.640]  and if you read the myriad of articles at Daily Mail he supposedly writes he
[05:14.640 --> 05:18.600]  wants to leave his vast multi-million dollar fortune to the global jihad he
[05:18.600 --> 05:21.480]  also worried that his wife had been implanted with a tracking chip but he
[05:21.480 --> 05:25.640]  doesn't sign any of the documents in his name he signs one Saeed bin Usama
[05:25.640 --> 05:30.840]  another Usama bin Muhammad and another Abu Abdallah but I ask why didn't he use
[05:30.840 --> 05:34.920]  his CIA codename of Tim Osman in any of these letters remember it was C. Bell
[05:34.920 --> 05:38.600]  Edmonds the FBI translator who broke a gag order and said that the US had been
[05:38.600 --> 05:42.160]  working with Osama bin Laden right up until 9-11 and they were outsourcing him
[05:42.160 --> 05:45.440]  to conduct terror operations all over the world there's one final note he was
[05:45.440 --> 05:49.320]  calling on Americans to help President Obama fight climate change so using
[05:49.320 --> 05:53.600]  liberal logic if you don't disavow climate change then you were for Osama
[05:53.600 --> 05:58.640]  bin Laden Rob do reporting for info wars.com and info wars nightly news my

[08:29.640 --> 08:39.640]  alex Jones and we are going to be live here for the next four hours Anthony
[08:39.640 --> 08:50.440]  Gucciardi will be hosting the fourth hour today Roger Stone is going to be
[08:50.440 --> 08:54.520]  joining us about the huge developments with Mitt Romney coming out and saying
[08:54.520 --> 08:59.040]  that Donald Trump is quote a phony and a fraud and echoing the con artist
[08:59.040 --> 09:08.600]  statements that has been coming out of the flying elephant Marco Rubio Dumbo and
[09:08.600 --> 09:13.360]  I wish Dumbo would just fly away since he wants to make comments about Donald
[09:13.360 --> 09:19.120]  Trump's t-rex hands but she doesn't have I kind of have diminutive hands they're
[09:19.120 --> 09:23.040]  not really small but compared to the rest of my body I kind of have my I guess
[09:23.040 --> 09:28.040]  my grandmother's genetics in my hands she was like five feet tall and then I've
[09:28.040 --> 09:33.960]  got regular size size 11 feet but I just you know I just never get over
[09:33.960 --> 09:39.200]  people obsessing over people's hand sizes is some type of insult that you
[09:39.200 --> 09:43.800]  supposedly are un-undoubled at least in my life that is really the the
[09:43.800 --> 09:48.040]  wives tale has not been true but but this is what the campaign has stooped
[09:48.040 --> 09:53.480]  to so we are now stooping to that with the Ferengi ambassador Marco Rubio who I
[09:53.480 --> 09:57.400]  heard has been scheduled to be in the next Star Trek I'm actually serious
[09:57.400 --> 10:01.320]  they want to cast him because in the next episode the Ferengi actually attacked
[10:01.320 --> 10:06.240]  the Federation and so he's he's got a big starring role as the Ferengi
[10:06.240 --> 10:12.000]  ambassador in the new Star Trek series okay I'm joking around ladies and
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.120]  gentlemen he actually has a starring role in Dumbo I don't write this stuff I
[10:17.120 --> 10:24.280]  just come up with it he does also never mind let's get serious we don't care
[10:24.280 --> 10:27.400]  about how big his ears are what he does in bubble baths quite frankly the fact
[10:27.400 --> 10:31.360]  is he's a globalist the establishment the Koch brothers the entire establishment
[10:31.360 --> 10:35.040]  is behind him and that's why he's bad news
[10:37.280 --> 10:43.760]  we also have the Republicans trying to obviously stop Trump with a broken
[10:43.760 --> 10:49.960]  convention coming up at the Republican National Convention in a few months and
[10:49.960 --> 10:53.440]  they're admitting now more and more that's their plan trial ballooning
[10:53.440 --> 11:00.320]  selling stealing an election like it's no big deal and kosher well there's
[11:00.320 --> 11:04.960]  also something called a FBI primary and the fact that they just gave one of
[11:04.960 --> 11:09.440]  Hillary's underlings that minded her computer immunity means it looks like
[11:09.440 --> 11:16.920]  he's getting ready to testify and if he does testify chances are that's not
[11:16.920 --> 11:21.480]  going to be good news for Hillary who's been caught lying so many times and has
[11:21.480 --> 11:27.720]  changed her story so many times I tried to do a video on it and found like 15 16
[11:27.720 --> 11:30.760]  different times she changed it the last few years to where I got so confused I
[11:30.760 --> 11:35.200]  didn't even do the video that's the problem with the Clintons it's just
[11:35.200 --> 11:39.520]  there's so many lies it's kind of like I tried to find all the clips for Donald
[11:39.520 --> 11:44.400]  Trump since 2001 disavowed David Duke and the KKK and there were so many of them
[11:44.400 --> 11:50.160]  and so many instances that I just turned it over to Rob do and I said you try to
[11:50.160 --> 11:56.520]  find them all and it's well over 15 I had said 14 we found 15 15 and of course
[11:56.520 --> 11:59.920]  there's more since then but it was so funny Tuesday night during the live
[11:59.920 --> 12:04.320]  coverage I've talked a lot about this because it illustrates everything three
[12:04.320 --> 12:07.000]  different reporters get up and say why won't you disavow the clan he said I
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.040]  disavowed it in 2001 it disavowed it last week a whole bunch of times I
[12:10.040 --> 12:16.200]  disavowed it today several times on the road but I disavowed I don't support
[12:16.200 --> 12:19.920]  any of that I'm you know I'm inclusive and I love the fact that blacks and
[12:19.920 --> 12:25.040]  Hispanics who voted for me in record numbers it's wonderful guys that like
[12:25.040 --> 12:32.160]  the clan don't have black ladies up on you know stage-kissing and the next
[12:32.160 --> 12:37.160]  reporter gets up and says why won't you disavow not go deeper into how you
[12:37.160 --> 12:40.160]  disavow or some angle like that still pushing it but just why would you
[12:40.160 --> 12:44.080]  disavow he went I just disavowed two minutes ago okay I disavowed again
[12:44.080 --> 12:49.520]  another one disavow oh wait a minute how many time okay I'll disavow but wait
[12:49.520 --> 12:54.280]  you just heard the answer and he had to disavow and play the game because
[12:54.280 --> 12:56.880]  they're going to keep saying it if he says look already did that I'm not
[12:56.880 --> 13:02.600]  getting into it that's the game and this is how they operate then they can get
[13:02.600 --> 13:08.520]  Democrats into Republican positions have them say wild and crazy things like we
[13:08.520 --> 13:15.360]  see happening in Travis County right now in my view and then say disavow this
[13:15.360 --> 13:20.960]  person it's the oldest trick in the book that happened to Rand Paul when he won
[13:20.960 --> 13:24.000]  the Republican primary the Democrats started coming out remember four years
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.400]  ago dressed in hay sheet outfits with overalls and I remember saying that looks
[13:28.400 --> 13:32.280]  like that's fake we need to investigate who these people are folks did Google
[13:32.280 --> 13:39.520]  face analysis and found them Democratic Party campaign paid members out with
[13:39.520 --> 13:45.080]  signs saying I hate Mexicans in fact you guys Democrats caught posing as racists
[13:45.080 --> 13:52.880]  against Rand Paul they also got caught in Houston a proto black lives matter
[13:52.880 --> 13:59.920]  type group got caught doing that and and they just do it over running around
[13:59.920 --> 14:04.880]  screaming the n-word and saying I support I support Rand Paul this is what they do
[14:04.880 --> 14:09.080]  and it's a dirty trick and it just shows how sick these people are now I'm not
[14:09.080 --> 14:11.760]  getting back to an old story from yesterday because I have lack of
[14:11.760 --> 14:19.160]  information I got too much just department grants immunity to Hillary
[14:19.160 --> 14:23.400]  Clinton's email server technician
[14:23.400 --> 14:31.840]  Denmark's leading Muslim Imam calls for death of infidels and women who cheat
[14:31.840 --> 14:37.080]  on their husbands telling his flock kill people that's a call to action that's
[14:37.080 --> 14:43.080]  not legal it's not free speech France warns Britain of migrant influx after EU
[14:43.080 --> 14:49.040]  exit mass transit meets mass surveillance and now legislation is being
[14:49.040 --> 14:52.920]  introduced not let them listen and watch you on buses on street corners see now
[14:52.920 --> 14:56.000]  we admit this is going on to ourselves now we can do something to stop it police
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.480]  appeal to lawmakers for future options on arming drones my issue was when we
[15:01.480 --> 15:04.720]  warned of all this coming people said it didn't exist remember just three four
[15:04.720 --> 15:07.760]  years ago they would say there's no plan to put drones in the sky
[15:07.760 --> 15:12.800]  surveilling farmers when it was already happening again Mitt Romney Donald Trump
[15:12.800 --> 15:16.920]  is a phony and a fraud Trump rolls out free market healthcare plan it's an
[15:16.920 --> 15:20.920]  excellent plan he actually does have a plan the media just runs this hoax that
[15:20.920 --> 15:24.840]  he doesn't have a plan Mitt Romney's niece to stuff Republican debate
[15:24.840 --> 15:28.480]  audience with anti-Trump insiders it's good to be on the inside didn't it
[15:28.480 --> 15:33.560]  there audio Rubio campaign manager plots broker convention in Manhattan donor
[15:33.560 --> 15:37.280]  meeting with the Koch brothers to take nomination from Trump this by the way
[15:37.280 --> 15:40.600]  confirms everything that Stone said that he had an operative in the meeting
[15:40.600 --> 15:45.680]  listening to of course Stone writes for Breitbart I'm not mad at him that he's
[15:45.680 --> 15:49.640]  giving them a scoop but GI wonder who's operative got the audio in Manhattan
[15:49.640 --> 15:54.320]  Roger Stone's joining us next hour I don't care if other groups get the scoops
[15:54.320 --> 15:59.880]  I want them to because we need more successful groups exposing tyranny and
[15:59.880 --> 16:04.520]  more investigative journalism not less that's how I don't get killed or put in
[16:04.520 --> 16:10.280]  prison we all fight for liberty together rising tide raises all ships we work
[16:10.280 --> 16:14.680]  together in the Liberty media and we defeat the globalist takeover that's
[16:14.680 --> 16:18.200]  what this revolution against tyranny this insurrection this overthrow of the
[16:18.200 --> 16:24.000]  occupying globalist is about and notice that narrative is getting out there so
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.680]  we're gonna play that audio next hour when Stone joins us report this is from
[16:27.680 --> 16:32.920]  info wars.com a lot of evidence points towards it this is not a dirty trick
[16:32.920 --> 16:36.960]  here you know like they said the Carson was dropping out the cruise did this is
[16:36.960 --> 16:39.680]  where it's all pointing to because the elite aren't giving him money they're
[16:39.680 --> 16:44.080]  all getting behind Rubio with Romney in the back as we told you with Roger Stone
[16:44.080 --> 16:48.480]  last week he had the inside mole moles at the inside meeting with 200 million
[16:48.480 --> 16:52.400]  errors and and billionaires and they told him we're giving you 25 million of
[16:52.400 --> 16:55.720]  our own money this week another 50 million from these other donors is
[16:55.720 --> 17:00.280]  pledged in the next week but if you lose Florida coming up in the middle of
[17:00.280 --> 17:05.800]  March you are done and then Romney comes in and that's exactly what Stone said
[17:05.800 --> 17:08.640]  last week you got to go watch that 10-minute interview I did on the
[17:08.640 --> 17:18.400]  outside after we ate dinner in downtown Austin with Stone headline what was that
[17:18.400 --> 17:26.640]  headline it was coke brothers to give 75 million to rubio to defeat Trump and
[17:26.640 --> 17:31.880]  now everything Stone said has been borne out cruise next to exit race according

[25:46.840 --> 25:52.120]  known really more than any species to become highly agitated and vicious in
[25:52.120 --> 25:56.080]  the defense of their young there's many documented cases by fire departments and
[25:56.080 --> 26:02.680]  police departments of a mother picking a multi-thousand pound car up off of their
[26:02.680 --> 26:08.360]  baby that's screaming in pain because the governor isn't there anymore and a
[26:08.360 --> 26:12.280]  woman that could normally squat 200 pounds can suddenly squat over a
[26:12.280 --> 26:17.400]  thousand fifteen hundred two thousand it's been estimated because their child
[26:17.400 --> 26:21.560]  is screaming and bleeding and begging and they black out and they pick the car
[26:21.560 --> 26:34.240]  up now that's hardwired into us for a reason it's a base level program it's
[26:34.240 --> 26:42.280]  called a drive state sex is a drive state being hungry as a drive state need
[26:42.280 --> 26:51.040]  to go to the bathroom as a drive state but the strongest isn't sex isn't even
[26:51.040 --> 26:55.440]  food protecting the young and what is the most important thing we can
[26:55.440 --> 27:04.640]  understand in this world and I'm gonna play this clip after the break if we
[27:04.640 --> 27:10.360]  don't care about our young it means we don't care about ourselves we don't
[27:10.360 --> 27:14.200]  care about our old and if we don't care about our young and our old and our
[27:14.200 --> 27:18.400]  unborn we don't care about our veterans and it means nobody's gonna care about
[27:18.400 --> 27:24.400]  us and the yuppie the trendy they always want to socially run up a flag that
[27:24.400 --> 27:27.080]  they're not racist or they give to charity or they care about the earth
[27:27.080 --> 27:31.000]  but statistically you can pull it up in major university studies from Canada and
[27:31.000 --> 27:37.640]  England six or more times likely to steal to not give to charity and to lie
[27:37.640 --> 27:44.320]  those that keep socially signaling that they're morally superior and better
[27:44.320 --> 27:50.320]  whereas conservatives and libertarians are globally the biggest givers and the
[27:50.320 --> 27:54.200]  people that don't tell you when they make a donation or don't tell you how
[27:54.200 --> 27:59.960]  much because it almost ruins it when you do that unless you're doing as an
[27:59.960 --> 28:07.280]  example to get others to give to a good cost if we don't care about the
[28:07.280 --> 28:12.240]  unborn we don't care about anybody and of course that's just a common sense
[28:12.240 --> 28:16.800]  thing that a normal person has but they've engineered that out of us with
[28:16.800 --> 28:21.040]  the modern culture here's the article cns news it's up on info wars com with
[28:21.040 --> 28:26.560]  the audio the video bioethicist we're gonna play when we come back listen to
[28:26.560 --> 28:32.520]  these key words this is the most important thing ever we have commodified
[28:32.520 --> 28:44.400]  babies and baby parts like pork bellies and chicken eggs we have
[28:44.400 --> 28:53.320]  dehumanized ourselves ladies and gentlemen at least these babies though
[28:53.320 --> 28:56.960]  through pain and it's horrible but at least it's it's not as completely
[28:56.960 --> 29:01.600]  conscious as a as a child or an adult it's horrible but let me tell you
[29:01.600 --> 29:07.000]  something the fact that for 30 years they've been growing humanoid chimeras
[29:07.000 --> 29:13.600]  in utero I've been talking about this for 20 years on air I couldn't believe
[29:13.600 --> 29:20.240]  it when it was in trade publications 20 years ago 21 years ago and no one
[29:20.240 --> 29:24.640]  believed me even when it was in the BBC 18 years ago they said yes in South
[29:24.640 --> 29:28.800]  Korea and yes in Costa Rica and other areas they are growing embryos where
[29:28.800 --> 29:34.440]  there aren't laws against it up to larger size in mammals like cows and pigs
[29:34.440 --> 29:39.720]  and so that they're not rejected they've been engineered to be part animal
[29:39.720 --> 29:44.800]  now again I keep harping on this because it's the loss of humanity and not
[29:44.800 --> 29:49.520]  caring and losing that instinct to say no and have our young torn apart the
[29:49.520 --> 29:54.240]  empires on the run lowers our spiritual defenses and the GCN radio I'll
[29:54.240 --> 29:59.960]  explain when we come back it opens the gate hey there how's it going this is

[34:52.520 --> 35:01.560]  centennials and daughters of the Republic of Texas you know events and like
[35:01.560 --> 35:06.600]  oh mom dad why are you involved in this Texas stuff well it's heritage we've
[35:06.600 --> 35:11.880]  got to keep it alive and it's it's special and then all these years later I
[35:11.880 --> 35:16.080]  look back and I realize I was actually at a disadvantage in my life because I
[35:16.080 --> 35:21.720]  grew up around people that didn't cheat didn't steal and did what they said they
[35:21.720 --> 35:29.160]  were gonna do and also didn't back down I look around at some of my fellow
[35:29.160 --> 35:35.320]  Americans and I tell you there's scum and they think it's cute to backstab they
[35:35.320 --> 35:39.920]  think it's smart to be betrayers I know so many people I have helped and done
[35:39.920 --> 35:47.480]  nothing to in my life and they think it's manly or cool to lie about me and to
[35:47.480 --> 35:54.400]  try to destroy me like blowing up a friend or lying about someone that
[35:54.400 --> 36:00.920]  helped you is cool and it's because they're mentally ill they're narcissistic
[36:00.920 --> 36:06.920]  and they're so twisted in their competition that they can't stand seeing
[36:06.920 --> 36:14.240]  someone else who's more successful than them and so they want to pile on and
[36:14.240 --> 36:20.200]  tear somebody down who doesn't deserve it I have no wish to hurt somebody who's
[36:20.200 --> 36:23.840]  better-looking than me more wealthy than I am more successful than I am as long
[36:23.840 --> 36:26.960]  as they're honorable then I admire them and want to learn things from them and
[36:26.960 --> 36:35.280]  want to be in the company of people like that of honorable people and then I
[36:35.280 --> 36:41.560]  look at somebody like Mitt Romney friends with Donald Trump off and on for
[36:41.560 --> 36:51.800]  decades at dinners and events and staying there friends and I just I just look
[36:51.800 --> 36:56.400]  at it and it's embarrassing because this is supposedly an
[36:56.400 --> 37:05.400]  upstanding honorable guy but he's not he's a sociopath in a suit with plastic
[37:05.400 --> 37:09.760]  surgery that's the thing I like about Trump yeah there's no plastic surgery
[37:09.760 --> 37:14.480]  there he loves the fact he looks like a toad and when I'm when I'm almost 70
[37:14.480 --> 37:17.080]  years old I already look like a toad I'm there's not gonna be plastic surgery
[37:17.080 --> 37:21.080]  here folks people say you ought to get a skin treatment you've got sunspots great
[37:21.080 --> 37:27.840]  I'm gonna get more and my crow's feet and my teeth will fall out and one day I'll
[37:27.840 --> 37:30.640]  go back to the dust
[37:30.640 --> 37:40.040]  I'm just sick of phony people and I realize that I was an advantage later
[37:40.040 --> 37:43.360]  in life because once you get through all the losers and the fake people you get
[37:43.360 --> 37:47.040]  into the society that's left in some areas of successful men and women that
[37:47.040 --> 37:52.600]  are honorable then all the doors open up for you but there's also the
[37:52.600 --> 37:56.040]  dishonorable society at the top as well that's always waging war against the
[37:56.040 --> 38:00.000]  honorable society and it always says the honorable society is the one that's
[38:00.000 --> 38:07.160]  dishonorable the whole power structure the dishonored mass murdering kingpin
[38:07.160 --> 38:16.920]  winners of all human time all ages all human experiences the communist Chinese
[38:16.920 --> 38:25.920]  have killed in their own annals 84 million of their own citizens never
[38:25.920 --> 38:33.320]  brought to justice never tried and the children of those elites are still
[38:33.320 --> 38:37.960]  carrying on the murder the warehousing of humans the selling of the organs the
[38:37.960 --> 38:41.320]  fall-on gong because they're Buddhist they they don't drink they don't smoke
[38:41.320 --> 38:44.920]  they have quote fresh organs the Chinese government advertises and they have
[38:44.920 --> 38:50.200]  mobile execution vans where they cut you up on the tarmac when the planes ready
[38:50.200 --> 38:54.200]  to take off they take your heart your liver your lungs rich Americans and
[38:54.200 --> 39:01.000]  others flying to Japan they wait at the hospital it's an hour away they take
[39:01.000 --> 39:07.320]  off and they land and you get your organs again Seattle ties back into the
[39:07.320 --> 39:13.640]  commodity as if lying about someone it's just a commodity now Mitt Romney
[39:13.640 --> 39:17.080]  groveling at the feet of the establishment coming in with the Koch
[39:17.080 --> 39:21.480]  brothers and the Chinese government and the Mexican government and the British
[39:21.480 --> 39:27.720]  government and the pope and the RNC and the Davos group and Larry Summers the
[39:27.720 --> 39:33.600]  architect of the Baker bailouts and the subprime scams and the derivatives
[39:33.600 --> 39:41.760]  present one big author it's him and the Clintons all weighing in because
[39:41.760 --> 39:44.600]  Donald Trump didn't spend money with the political class because he didn't
[39:44.600 --> 39:47.800]  appoint a bunch of their top advisors and promises to whatever they said and
[39:47.800 --> 39:54.440]  make the deals he said I'm not gonna let China have an internal 20% tariff on
[39:54.440 --> 39:58.440]  us we're gonna have real free trade and they went no you're not we own factories
[39:58.440 --> 40:02.080]  over there and made the deal to sell out and we've got America on its knees with
[40:02.080 --> 40:07.120]  our foot on their neck and you're not coming in like a bunch of hyenas over
[40:07.120 --> 40:11.520]  their kill that's almost dead and they're not with their eyes shining and
[40:11.520 --> 40:15.160]  they're looking over at Trump and the American people going I don't know who
[40:15.160 --> 40:18.280]  you are whether you want to eat this or save it I don't know if you're it's a
[40:18.280 --> 40:21.960]  mama it's dad or you want the meat I don't know if you're a predator like me
[40:21.960 --> 40:25.920]  or you're here to save it but you're not getting it and more hyenas are coming
[40:25.920 --> 40:31.960]  in and Trump like a lion sitting right there like 500 hyenas and more more
[40:31.960 --> 40:36.200]  Americans are becoming lions backing him up and all these cowards sit there
[40:36.200 --> 40:41.520]  as thousands of hyenas now line up against hundreds of lions with their
[40:41.520 --> 40:46.800]  big snap and jaws rise in the night you ever seen footage of hyenas in the
[40:46.800 --> 40:54.320]  night those eyes flashing laughing calling up the hordes more more more
[40:54.320 --> 41:02.080]  power against him we will steal it at the convention we will disqualify
[41:02.080 --> 41:07.000]  whoever we want whatever we want but we're we're forcing the establishment to
[41:07.000 --> 41:13.200]  show their hand to show their cards resistance is victory because when you
[41:13.200 --> 41:22.000]  resist you make the enemy come out in the open and Donald Trump and Matt drudge
[41:22.000 --> 41:28.240]  and Alex Jones and people like that myself I I've had my name to a great
[41:28.240 --> 41:32.480]  extent cut up and attacked I mean with stupid people I'm a horrible person but
[41:32.480 --> 41:43.640]  I know who I am in my heart God knows who I am but I'm here to be destroyed just
[41:43.640 --> 41:49.080]  like Donald Trump is or any other leader I hope I'm not and I may not but it
[41:49.080 --> 41:52.360]  doesn't matter I know the role I'm playing I know the office I'm in and
[41:52.360 --> 41:55.680]  there is completion in that I know I'm doing the right thing I'm doing the
[41:55.680 --> 41:58.640]  best analysis I can I'm trying to be the most honorable person I can I've been
[41:58.640 --> 42:02.320]  over backwards to be the best person I can and to really not lie to myself and
[42:02.320 --> 42:08.000]  to really be a good person and so I struggle with guilt constantly people
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.520]  that know me go why are you guilty you're like really good yeah but I could be
[42:12.520 --> 42:21.320]  better and it's because there's a quick slide in the wickedness but I'm not
[42:21.320 --> 42:27.560]  going to cheat to win and to defeat the establishment just to become it I want
[42:27.560 --> 42:31.880]  to overthrow this entire corrupt system that's sitting on top humanity I want to
[42:31.880 --> 42:36.320]  restore the Republic restore the Renaissance and I've been praising
[42:36.320 --> 42:41.920]  George Washington a lot on air lately and I've seen trash weak trash on the
[42:41.920 --> 42:47.680]  internet on YouTube on info wars you name it bad-mouthing George Washington and
[42:47.680 --> 42:50.720]  I'm a student of history because growing up it's so entertaining let me get to the
[42:50.720 --> 42:59.840]  nose and this body part story that's key and I have read about Julius Caesar and
[42:59.840 --> 43:09.560]  I've read about Genghis Khan and Tell of the Hun and Joseph Stalin and Nebuchadnezzar
[43:10.840 --> 43:18.160]  all I mean I basically read it all and I've read the military books and I've
[43:18.160 --> 43:25.480]  read the stories about everything from George Washington to German French
[43:25.480 --> 43:30.880]  foreign legion fighter Rolf Steiner hundreds and hundreds of military books
[43:30.880 --> 43:33.760]  because it was so entertaining I had no idea I was getting military training the
[43:33.760 --> 43:38.320]  whole time I basically read most of what West Point I learned has in their
[43:38.320 --> 43:48.720]  library including Starship Troopers the fiction and the nonfiction by the way
[43:48.720 --> 43:53.400]  Starship Troopers is not like the movie I wonder why the Pentagon makes it
[43:53.400 --> 43:56.600]  required reading go read the book and then look at the milk realize it was
[43:56.600 --> 44:00.680]  written by Heinlein in the 50s and it all basically technologically has come
[44:00.680 --> 44:12.120]  true Robert a Heinlein now let's continue here and they say he was a dirty filthy
[44:12.120 --> 44:20.440]  Mason and Jones you are a scumbag Mason coward yourself I love how I'm a Mason
[44:20.440 --> 44:24.520]  and I work for the Vatican and I work for Israel I don't work for the Vatican I
[44:24.520 --> 44:30.720]  don't work for Masons I don't work for Israel I don't work for anybody but
[44:30.720 --> 44:36.440]  humankind surviving and being successful and giving everybody a shot to be free
[44:36.440 --> 44:44.480]  and it's easy to sit there and attack the Masons all day because just like
[44:44.480 --> 44:49.160]  society they become corrupt and weak and they've been overtaken like a fiddler
[44:49.160 --> 44:55.280]  crab moves into some other creature shell after it dies there aren't any many
[44:55.280 --> 45:01.680]  real Masons in the world today it was taken over by the Illuminati and I
[45:01.680 --> 45:04.840]  break all that down in that very video where people are saying how dare you
[45:04.840 --> 45:08.120]  defend George Washington say he was a great man when he wrote about it and
[45:08.120 --> 45:10.880]  tried to expose it and stopped the French Revolution here which was a
[45:10.880 --> 45:15.680]  communist revolution and I'm just so sick of ignorant people that like have a
[45:15.680 --> 45:22.440]  word like Mason they know nothing and they just throw it out there like like
[45:22.440 --> 45:30.600]  Jew you're a Jew and I'm like I mean it's like saying you know to cry the
[45:30.600 --> 45:34.880]  Ku Klux Klan I'm like well I'm not for the clan but just say Jew it's so
[45:34.880 --> 45:39.160]  diverse it's so big it's so many ideas and thoughts I'll go okay I am Jewish
[45:39.160 --> 45:42.280]  that's right I have right to return to Israel I was born in Israel it's not true
[45:42.280 --> 45:50.080]  I don't have one drop of Jewish blood in me but I've had a lot and do have a lot
[45:50.080 --> 45:55.840]  of Jewish friends and I've never gotten anything but help from not my Jewish
[45:55.840 --> 46:01.120]  sponsors last time I checked none of them were Jewish but from Jews in my
[46:01.120 --> 46:08.360]  life the problem is a lot of Jews have been pushed around and stepped on so
[46:08.360 --> 46:12.000]  they turn to the dark side and Jews that have turned the dark side are truly
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.160]  very evil indeed
[46:16.080 --> 46:23.120]  anyone that turns the dark side is evil and bad news so I'd like to not fight
[46:23.120 --> 46:27.800]  with blacks and Hispanics and Jews and and and Masons and Catholics and
[46:27.800 --> 46:31.840]  everybody else I'd rather just promote humanity and liberty and say hey let's
[46:31.840 --> 46:34.680]  agree we're not gonna sell body parts of babies and let's agree we're not gonna
[46:34.680 --> 46:38.040]  keep them alive to take their organs and let's agree we're gonna tell China to
[46:38.040 --> 46:43.520]  stop killing Christians and Buddhists and in holding them in cells for years
[46:43.520 --> 46:48.360]  and and genetically typing them preparing them in lockers basically
[46:48.360 --> 46:51.920]  even exercise them and feed them good food getting them ready to have their
[46:51.920 --> 46:57.040]  organs harvested because as a human I don't like seeing mammals kept in bad
[46:57.040 --> 47:01.280]  cages or chickens with their bigs cut off in filth and I don't want to eat that
[47:01.280 --> 47:08.720]  either bad mojo but my empathy for animals like when I see a dead dog on
[47:08.720 --> 47:14.960]  the side of the road what about empathy for the baby parts for the humans
[47:14.960 --> 47:21.160]  where's that empathy see so I want to transcend all the labels and all the
[47:21.160 --> 47:26.680]  garbage but I want to say George Washington by military historians around
[47:26.680 --> 47:34.440]  the world in Russia in England in Japan in France in Venezuela a hundred years
[47:34.440 --> 47:39.400]  ago look it up look at who in military training academies who they they have
[47:39.400 --> 47:43.240]  voting societies and military groups that vote on the greatest general ever
[47:43.240 --> 47:50.480]  and the toughest and stores Washington our founder was the best there
[47:50.480 --> 47:55.160]  probably ever was and you sit there because you're a big man and you call
[47:55.160 --> 47:58.040]  him a mason and say he was a devil worshipper when he was a devout
[47:58.040 --> 48:03.920]  Christian and tried to keep Mason rechristian and it was overthrown by
[48:03.920 --> 48:09.880]  the Satanist to a great extent and you sit there and your ignorance and you
[48:09.880 --> 48:15.200]  piss on George Washington I didn't know they stacked garbage that high that's
[48:15.200 --> 48:20.720]  all I want to say to you your filth your stupid your dumb and you should
[48:20.720 --> 48:25.360]  apologize for the crap comes out of your mouth I'm so sick of weak people that
[48:25.360 --> 48:30.440]  hadn't done nothing that think is they got fake social justice warrior arrogance
[48:30.440 --> 48:33.800]  that they're above everybody else it's done something and that goes for fake
[48:33.800 --> 48:45.280]  conservatives too let's go to this clip this is from Congress bioethesis we
[48:45.280 --> 48:51.280]  have commodified babies and baby parts we've reached a point in our society
[48:51.280 --> 48:56.200]  where there effectively is an amazon.com for human parts entire babies
[48:56.200 --> 48:59.960]  representative Diane black republican Tennessee asked the witness at the
[48:59.960 --> 49:06.720]  special hearing on bioethics and fetal tissue on Wednesday Dr. Jared Kevin
[49:06.720 --> 49:10.880]  Donovan a pediatrician and bioethicist at Georgetown University responded that
[49:10.880 --> 49:14.360]  the practice of using tissue from aborted babies the government termed
[49:14.360 --> 49:18.920]  research shocks my conscience and it should shock the conscious of the
[49:18.920 --> 49:22.240]  nation so they played a game where they go fetal tissue fetal tissue bush won't
[49:22.240 --> 49:31.360]  let us have fetal tissue but then if you label it differently you can use
[49:31.360 --> 49:36.280]  whatever you want see it's all games and that's being shattered now let's go
[49:36.280 --> 49:41.120]  ahead and go to this testimony I want to ask the panelists have we reached a
[49:41.120 --> 49:45.760]  point in our society where there effectively is an amazon.com for human
[49:45.760 --> 49:51.000]  parts including entire babies and I'd like to ask our panel for their opinion
[49:51.000 --> 49:57.240]  on this email and the notion of obtaining potentially entire embryos on
[49:57.240 --> 50:02.800]  demand dr. Donovan would you like to address this I personally find that it
[50:02.800 --> 50:05.800]  shocks my conscience and I think it should shock the conscience of the
[50:05.800 --> 50:10.520]  nation I think you're absolutely right you know we have commodified what had
[50:10.520 --> 50:15.360]  been referred to as the products of conception meaning babies and baby parts
[50:15.360 --> 50:22.240]  and yes they are for sale supposedly just to cover one's costs those costs
[50:22.240 --> 50:27.120]  seem to be quite variable but even if they were given away free it's shocking
[50:27.120 --> 50:34.000]  to be ordering what you want can I have a boy fetus or a girl fetus or a brain
[50:34.000 --> 50:42.040]  or a heart or a liver this is this is totally indistinction to the honorable
[50:42.040 --> 50:46.960]  transplantation industry that that is life-saving and shows great respect for
[50:46.960 --> 50:54.480]  the donors miss Cunningham I think what we need to pay attention to here is not
[50:54.480 --> 51:00.760]  is this somehow increasing abortion my concern is that researchers have come
[51:00.760 --> 51:06.360]  to count on induced abortion for their research and and one of the articles that
[51:06.360 --> 51:10.560]  I cited in my written testimony shows that they say that liver from induced
[51:10.560 --> 51:14.560]  abortions is widely available and is a promising source what have we come to
[51:14.560 --> 51:19.600]  where researchers need induced abortion to do their research wouldn't have been
[51:19.600 --> 51:24.280]  better if we had banned this at the beginning and use the creative minds that
[51:24.280 --> 51:28.440]  we have and miss Cunningham I hate to find you all but I have alternatives thank
[51:28.440 --> 51:32.000]  you and I just have one brief comment to make because my time is going to end
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.720]  here in just a second I believe that we should give this same information and
[51:36.720 --> 51:41.640]  dignity to these young women that are making these decisions and I believe
[51:41.640 --> 51:45.840]  that it should be a more informed and educational decision that they are
[51:45.840 --> 51:49.560]  making and I don't believe that is happening currently all right for an
[51:49.560 --> 51:57.240]  eight-month-old induced abortion what they mean is late-term they can get
[51:57.240 --> 52:00.760]  hundreds of thousands of dollars but to run these giant facilities and the ads
[52:00.760 --> 52:06.360]  and the marketing they call it expenses it's all a sick game but they always
[52:06.360 --> 52:12.280]  just change the subject this is total dehumanization and remember we talk
[52:12.280 --> 52:17.680]  about this 15 16 17 18 years ago and people would say oh they're not selling
[52:17.680 --> 52:24.480]  baby parts ladies and gentlemen women wonder why abortions were $300 when I
[52:24.480 --> 52:28.680]  was in high school and they're $300 today that's just the number they've got to
[52:28.680 --> 52:35.920]  make you think it's a service they get federal and foundation grants that pay
[52:35.920 --> 52:42.920]  for it all and then they're selling the tissue they have been selling melted
[52:42.920 --> 52:47.880]  down baby collagen for at least 30 years out of China it's fenced into France
[52:47.880 --> 52:53.360]  it's put in the finest cosmetics that women buy and women you really should
[52:53.360 --> 52:57.600]  investigate if your companies are buying from are that because you don't want to
[52:57.600 --> 53:02.640]  be smear and melted down baby fat on your face sweetheart and yeah it does make
[53:02.640 --> 53:10.240]  you look young doesn't it you have become vampires unknowingly now here's the big
[53:10.240 --> 53:14.320]  secret and I don't I don't personally follow this or believe this when I say
[53:14.320 --> 53:17.760]  these things it's like I'm an anthropologist or a sociologist in New
[53:17.760 --> 53:22.440]  Guinea studying the tribes that eat their enemies organs and shrink their heads
[53:22.440 --> 53:27.000]  and believe that they get the power of their spirit I don't believe that but
[53:27.000 --> 53:32.120]  the dominant religion and the global elite is an amalgamation of a host of
[53:32.120 --> 53:39.320]  occult practices around the world they even integrate Aztec you end of Mayan
[53:39.320 --> 53:45.000]  culture ideas as far west as that but it's mainly settled around Germanic
[53:45.000 --> 53:50.320]  Luciferian Faustian death cult and they do black magic rituals at Bohemian
[53:50.320 --> 53:54.280]  Grove I've been there and skull and bones come out people broken in there and
[53:54.280 --> 53:59.560]  there's the animals first they do corrupting rituals where they bathe in
[53:59.560 --> 54:05.160]  feces and urine and have sex and that's even in the movie the Good Shepherd that
[54:05.160 --> 54:11.720]  brought that as Matt Damon and it was directed by Robert Nero I mean I'm just
[54:11.720 --> 54:13.800]  telling you and of course we told you about it years before that was in the
[54:13.800 --> 54:18.160]  movie and then after they've got you to get ready to corrupt yourself then you
[54:18.160 --> 54:21.680]  start to corrupt others and they basically want to introduce corruption
[54:21.680 --> 54:25.000]  into you spiritually and whether you believe there's a spirit or not which
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.800]  obviously those other dimensions there is just another dimension of our being
[54:27.800 --> 54:35.400]  but the core that goes on the animation of the body but it's more
[54:35.400 --> 54:40.160]  sophisticated your earth suit is a genetic memory literally of everybody
[54:40.160 --> 54:44.800]  before you so it's multi-levels and no one else says this I say this this is
[54:44.800 --> 54:53.600]  the truth dealing with the body but as a fact it's prima facie right there the
[54:53.600 --> 54:56.840]  memories the instincts the cells the genetics it's a code I mean the elite
[54:56.840 --> 55:02.560]  know this but I'm the only one saying it publicly and I know it's in their
[55:02.560 --> 55:04.680]  writings a lot of times before I even read their writings because I'm just
[55:04.680 --> 55:10.640]  tuned in directly to what's going on I'm not bragging it's just a fact and the
[55:10.640 --> 55:14.280]  secret is the allegories like the golden child pretty good movie with with with
[55:14.280 --> 55:20.360]  Eddie Murphy and they're trying to get the little holy boy but they want to
[55:20.360 --> 55:23.920]  kill second bring in the antichrist you know unbalance the world to bring in
[55:23.920 --> 55:27.520]  the evil it's more of an Illuminati view of things but they want to kill him with
[55:27.520 --> 55:31.760]  this special dagger but they can't till he's injected and until he's willfully
[55:31.760 --> 55:37.040]  ingested the blood of sacrificed children and it's like episode three in
[55:37.040 --> 55:42.200]  Star Wars when Palpatine Darth Sidious says Darth Vader you know to really get
[55:42.200 --> 55:44.880]  evil and to really get rid of the goodness in you and really go to the
[55:44.880 --> 55:49.000]  dark side of you to go kill about a hundred kids go to the Jedi temple and
[55:49.000 --> 55:54.080]  kill all the younglings only then will you be powerful enough to face Obi-Wan
[55:54.080 --> 55:59.520]  Kenobi and see these are children's movies but they're allegories and Lucas
[55:59.520 --> 56:04.520]  said that of how things really work and he said you want about 9-11 see episode
[56:04.520 --> 56:11.680]  three where it's a false life and so they need us to say abortion's okay they
[56:11.680 --> 56:18.360]  need us to eat and ingest the the the sacrifice babies it's spiritual because
[56:18.360 --> 56:22.640]  then God's protection is taken away from us that's why Pepsi and a whole bunch of
[56:22.640 --> 56:30.000]  other formulators use baby fetal parts in their flavor production then they
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.800]  synthetically off the baby parts produce the flavor but then they test it in a
[56:33.800 --> 56:41.120]  genetic match with the flavor of baby fat baby endorphins growth hormone things
[56:41.120 --> 56:45.360]  like that that's how they get around the law you know to not tell you they're
[56:45.360 --> 56:49.160]  putting growth hormone like things in the food they just create something that's
[56:49.160 --> 56:55.080]  that's close to it but is biological in nature and has a larger molecule and so
[56:55.080 --> 56:58.640]  food is really drugs that's why they want to addict you and get you off real
[56:58.640 --> 57:02.080]  food and force you into their matrix
[57:02.600 --> 57:05.280]  and remember that came out like five years ago people couldn't believe it now
[57:05.280 --> 57:09.320]  folks go oh yeah it's been in the news Pepsi Pepsi you know remember Obama came
[57:09.320 --> 57:12.440]  in and wouldn't let the board of directors even wanted to know why we have
[57:12.440 --> 57:16.440]  baby parts it's hurting sales and the Homeland Security got involved and
[57:16.440 --> 57:20.760]  said and was in the news and said it's not being looked at okay because it's
[57:20.760 --> 57:28.680]  national security that you drink Pepsi tainted with the essence of dead children
[57:28.800 --> 57:34.440]  it's in the game folks because then metaphorically the Ajani dagger can be
[57:34.440 --> 57:39.920]  slid right into you and your family and they got spiritual right to kill you
[57:39.920 --> 57:46.120]  they're conducting black magic on a huge scale you'd understand that now if you
[57:46.120 --> 57:50.080]  been involved in abortion are you been drinking or using cosmetics and
[57:50.080 --> 57:54.760]  ingesting humans you can be forgiven at any time it's metaphysical you got to
[57:54.760 --> 57:58.320]  say I didn't know I repent or I believed it was just body parts I didn't know I
[57:58.320 --> 58:01.800]  killed my child or I didn't know I paid girlfriends to kill their kids I repent I
[58:01.800 --> 58:05.720]  was wrong I'm sorry I'll never do it again you will feel the weight just come
[58:05.720 --> 58:09.440]  off you I'm telling you folks the enemy knows how to control things for a
[58:09.440 --> 58:15.200]  reason they've got you caught in what they believe was a black magic spell and
[58:15.200 --> 58:20.680]  and quite frankly whatever it is it's working I've studied them I mean they
[58:20.680 --> 58:26.240]  don't have you know all the Bush sons bathing and feces and worshiping Satan
[58:26.240 --> 58:35.840]  for nothing you understand that all right they do all this for a reason you're
[58:35.840 --> 58:39.960]  baptized in water as a Baptist they baptize NPCs while being urinated on
[58:39.960 --> 58:43.600]  I'm sorry to be gross that's who runs this country they get on their knees of
[58:43.600 --> 58:47.720]  the devil they want to kill you and your family

[59:41.760 --> 59:52.800]  that's info wars life.com or call 888-253-3139 you're listening to the Alex
[59:52.800 --> 59:55.640]  Jones show
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:06.280]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:16.080]  war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Donald Trump has shown
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.360]  an extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works to create jobs for
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.440]  the American people. What little he has said is enough to know that he would be
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.640]  very bad for American workers and for American families. He understands that
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.960]  our economy is facing threats from abroad he's one of the few people who
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.600]  stood up and said you know what China has been cheating they've they've taken
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.120]  jobs from Americans they haven't played fair we have to have a president who
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:47.680]  will stand up to cheaters. His proposed 35 percent tariff like penalties would
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.760]  instigate a trade war and that would raise prices for consumers kill our
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.440]  export jobs and lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all stripes to flee
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.440]  America. I spent my life in the private sector not quite as successful as this
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.160]  guy but successful nonetheless sufficiently successful to understand
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:10.800]  what it takes to get America to be the most attractive place in the world for
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.160]  innovators entrepreneurs and business and job creators he inherited his
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:23.560]  business he didn't create it a business genius he is not. Rob do put that
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.200]  together we're gonna put that up on infowars.com I'm gonna do a blurb I'm
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.760]  gonna send it to drudge and everybody else I'm gonna put it on our Facebook and
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:37.040]  needs to go viral what do you call that Romney caught in incredible lies about
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:42.660]  Trump but but it's worse than that it's like Mitt Romney the most two-faced man
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:53.040]  in history or Mitt Romney praises Trump that attacks Trump I mean what do you
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.440]  say in the headline so that people click on it to relay how important that
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:02.320]  video is guys gals in the control room what do I call that ask it Daniels
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:09.320]  that's the Don Salazar asked your car eat somebody what do you call that we
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.920]  come back from break I'm gonna try to come up with a headline because I mean
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.480]  there's a video of that short a minute and ten seconds long and that powerful
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:23.120]  has got to go viral and I just need to think of the name of it I don't know
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.400]  what you call that video by the way I didn't plug anything last hour I
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:30.440]  got so upset about the how humans have been turned into commodities now we
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:33.840]  don't stand up for each other nobody'll stand up for us it's just it's just a
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.040]  metaphysical rule and I got into some pretty hardcore subjects but it's just
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:43.000]  I've been fighting the globalist 25 years 21 years on air and I about 24
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.240]  years actually and I I just have come pretty much the bottom of the rabbit
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:52.680]  hole and scientifically historically I mean as a sociologist as an anthropologist
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:57.120]  this is what the elite believe they're doing they're we look at the Super Bowl
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.080]  you look at the Emmys the Grammys it's all weird ritual they had the Tower of
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:07.080]  Babel at the at the Academy Awards and other weird stuff I mean they admit at
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:13.120]  the Olympics they're doing global government rituals and things and at the
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.520]  new millennium and in Egypt it was all over national television they were
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.760]  doing an Illuminati ritual these people are really into this stuff and they
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:24.360]  believe they're getting power out of it now are they just insane maybe so but
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.800]  they're in power
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.640]  what's your view on Romney coming out against even flip-flopping what's your
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:35.440]  view on Hillary in the Justice Department grants immunity to Hillary
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:39.360]  Clinton's email server technician which some most say means they're getting ready
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:45.200]  to go after it is that really true can she get past the FBI primary she may be
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:49.040]  able to steal the election but can she continue to get away with her crimes but
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.120]  again just briefly you got to stand with info wars as well because we really are
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:58.360]  out on the field against the dragon I don't think anybody else is more out
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:04.960]  there against the enemy but about Donald Trump or a Matt Drudge a bright bar to
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.920]  world that daily I mean and then none of us are perfect you know even Limbaugh
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.360]  has been kind of coming out against Trump all of a sudden which shows they put
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.040]  the screws to him I want anyone to have an audience I'm sure likes Trump the
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.920]  other hand you know they got people breathing down his neck well if anybody's
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.320]  been blackmailed it's him over stuff that just doesn't matter that's why I'm a
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:28.000]  libertarian I don't care what he's doing as a man with women or what he's doing
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  with Viagra coming through the airport or pain pills his backs hurt I mean just
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.200]  you know that's his issue but it just it just shows how they're controlling people
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.720]  so that's why whether they attack me make stuff up whatever hey I'm out here on
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.080]  the field so you got to support what we're doing just like with Trump got a

[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.080]  all the important decisions forget the politicians the politicians are put

[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:41.200]  paid for the senate the congress the state houses and city halls they got the
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.560]  judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:48.320]  control just about all of the news and information you get to hear they got you
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:55.880]  by the balls they want obedient workers obedient workers people who are just
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:59.680]  smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.080]  passively accept jobs with a lower pay the longer hours to reduce benefits the
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.520]  end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:12.160]  collect it and now they're coming for your social security money so they can
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:18.160]  give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street it's a big club and you ain't
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:23.280]  in it and you said recently quote when you give they do whatever the hell you
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.920]  want them to do you better believe it so what specifically didn't they do if I
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.720]  ask them if I need them you know most of the people on this stage I've given to
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:37.480]  just so you understand a lot of money you and I are not in the big club the
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:42.040]  owners of this country know the truth it's called the American dream because
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:47.080]  you have to be asleep to believe it but I'll tell you what they don't want they
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:50.680]  don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking they don't
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:54.640]  want well-informed well educated people capable of critical thinking they're not
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:59.000]  interested in that that doesn't help them that's against their interest that's
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:07.080]  right from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones the
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:12.320]  great George Carlin I kind of like the puppet on the left I kind of like the
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.080]  puppet on the right wait a minute there's one guy holding both puppets that
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:21.320]  of course the late great as well Bill Hicks and that's where we stand today
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.240]  and then in comes Trump saying I'm not spending money on ads I'm not getting
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:28.360]  all the inside strategist I'm not gonna go meet with the Koch brothers if he
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:33.200]  had done all that they'd put him in he says I'm not gonna let China have a
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.960]  20% internal tariff on us that's not fair and they say no you will not be
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:47.040]  president bring in Romney and I played this one minute ten second clip earlier
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.920]  I'm gonna play it again we're putting it up on YouTube we're gonna ride a little
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:11:00.760]  blurb around it and I guess you would label it this video destroys Mitt
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:07.120]  Romney's claims against Trump that's it this video destroys Mitt Romney's claims
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.760]  against Trump that's the name of it tweet it Facebook it I want to get it up I
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.880]  want to maximum push on this video and then under it just a list how the whole
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:19.480]  articles with a whole power structure the Pope the communist Chinese murderers
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:23.760]  the Mexican president with his narcotics trafficking brother just
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.680]  everybody the whole establishment Davos the Clintonistas the bushes the Koch
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:37.480]  brothers man I can't tell you how many times not no pseudo-intellectuals would
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.440]  email me or call me or like walk up to me at a table in a restaurant and go
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.640]  kind of like to show for a while so I thought that you and the Koch brothers
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.240]  and they started like ten years ago and I'd go that's read their name and I'd
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:51.760]  call them Koch brothers because there's a bunch of billionaire donors and
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.720]  they're one of the biggest but but overall they're outnumbered by
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.720]  bunch of others and they used to only by Democrats I've had what's his name Greg
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.320]  Palace is the big liberal on these are great investigative journalist many
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.080]  times and he's like oh they're really Democrats but they've been trying to
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:08.520]  buy the Republicans for 20 years and now almost spent exclusively with them to
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:12.840]  make him you know neo-con rhinos which is true and then these pseudo-intellectuals
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.560]  won't get I know you're paid by a blusher wish I was it's like this like
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.480]  like I know you're paid by the Chinese government I know you're paid by the
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.000]  Jews I know you're paid by the Masons I know you're paid by the Vatican they're
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.280]  paid because I'm morally superior to you I just say that and then don't listen to
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.120]  anything you have to say and then here we are fighting the Koch brothers toe
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:33.760]  to toe they were responding to stone in my show say we didn't at the secret
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.880]  meeting call for Rubio to have a new campaign head and we didn't call for a
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:41.840]  broker convention we didn't give 25 million with a $50 50 million pledge
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:51.400]  it's all come out since then they deny it they deny it and now it's all come
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.720]  out they're there they're cheap strategist goes to run Rubio's campaign
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:03.760]  Saturday and now it's being reported the Koch to the Koch brothers eyeing
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:09.200]  Rubio for a billion dollar campaign contribution that was them last year
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.240]  they've already given hundreds of millions of the campaign but here's what
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:15.240]  was great about them in the New York Times the Washington Post on Saturday
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:20.960]  the morning after I stone broke all that and drudge linked to it they were
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.880]  already countering drudge by by Saturday night and Sunday and stones coming on in
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:36.080]  20 minutes it was incredible they said we've given no money to the primaries you
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.640]  can pull it up and we're not going to be involved in the primaries when they
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:43.960]  have been involved all over the place in hundreds of articles in their own
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:47.800]  statements just like you can keep your doctor if you want your doctor and
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:52.400]  Obamacare is free and they're raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt two
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.160]  plus two equals five and no one wants your guns but we are trying to ban them
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:01.240]  and Bill Clinton didn't have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky and Trump
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:04.920]  has not decried the Klan they're still saying he hasn't decried the Klan it's
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:10.640]  got to be 30 40 times now it's like 14 times by Tuesday that I'd seen three
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.400]  times in a row in the same press conference I've decried it last week this
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.160]  week 15 years ago I decried again I am not part of it I think it's terrible
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:23.880]  next question why would you not to decry the Klan you know I just did a minute
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:29.400]  ago okay I decried again another one why don't you decry I just did it well now
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:37.880]  you won't and that's why when I had the consument hacker and computer programmer
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:45.720]  John McAvie on your stay I mean if you want to say somebody has has has basically
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:50.080]  gone over to a culture that's what McAvie likes I mean I've known him for
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.160]  years and he's well known that he mainly has black girlfriends he's now married to
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:57.880]  a black lady and yeah I don't think he's even gone black he's kind of gone urban
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:03.720]  whatever that's why he likes guns pit bulls you know techno music which is kind
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:14.720]  of the white trendies and I just kept saying say that you to cry the Klan he
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:18.160]  goes okay I do cry the Klan and I said why won't you to cry I mean he goes by
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.520]  just did I said no you didn't it was fine to cry the Klan he starts he gets he
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:24.920]  starts laughing but still gonna irritate it because he's a man successful mate

[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:31.000]  company it's still not fun and I but I did it to illustrate that not to be mean
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.800]  and I said why won't you to crime he goes listen I married the black lady and my
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.160]  best friend's black I look I'm not and he goes I know this is a joke this is

[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:12.640]  went wow you're fascinating tell us more now when I will that's what I did what
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:20.160]  I did put that sucker in his place and it already happened a couple times that
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.360]  night so that's why I was starting to get a little bit angry because it was the
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:28.880]  way he swaggered over that one the white guy he was an Arab guy he sized me up
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:34.520]  he said what's your costume and I went oh it's a it's an airline captain he was
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:40.400]  really I thought it was a Nazi I don't like Nazis I was like you're not a
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:47.280]  Nazi are you imagine out and I'm like I'm sitting there in purple jeans and a
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.440]  t-shirt wearing an airline hat because we want a little cruise on the lake for my
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:55.160]  cousin's birthday party I told the story I need to stop me to get in the nose
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:05.600]  well a couple hour cruise and ate food and dances and I went back but and I
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:10.560]  looked at him I was just like it's a captain's hat even then he pushed it was
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:14.600]  like oh really cuz I was like that's it man you're get out of my face we just

[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:21.400]  you're not gonna get a job with that fake degree and why you're a loser and
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.920]  why you're frustrated you can't seem to get jobs because all you were taught
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.120]  was social justice water garbage and I went through about probably a two minute
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.280]  rant of the sociology the anthropology how he was ruined how he had no life and
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:37.120]  he was destroyed he deserved it I see you're not with women I see you're not
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:45.480]  successful get away from me maybe he wanted to do something else and I'm not
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:52.160]  looking for trouble but I'm can only be pushed so far he was racist and didn't
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:59.360]  like a white guy with two good-looking women talking to him he thought I'd roll
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:03.640]  over and apologize for being who I was I should have said I'm sorry for the
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:13.240]  Renaissance and quantum mechanics I apologize you're my god I have to skip
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.760]  his network break I just because I've run over and I'm an evil person this is
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:19.120]  the last one that I'm so horrible I apologize I've got to be serious Nico
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:24.720]  you just popped in my ear and said you have another clip oh yeah I'm gonna get
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.160]  McAfee disavows the Klan
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.880]  I think the headline I wanted was I told him that last night this morning I'm
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:39.800]  not mad it's you got to get the social justice warriors to get excited that
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.560]  they may be bringing somebody down and have like little ceremonial victories
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.360]  in imaginary land so I want to use them to make it go viral the headline needs to
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:49.000]  be something like
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:57.880]  John McAfee challenged on the KKK because it make you see it and show people
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:04.080]  how absurd it is McAfee cornered about KKK something like that put it up on
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:08.560]  info wars put it up on prison planet let's have it go viral let's play that
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:15.000]  before we play the clip of Romney being endorsed by Trump endorsing Trump four
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:21.280]  years ago now completely flip-flopping it's the greatest 180 flip-flop I believe
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:27.600]  I've ever seen in 70 seconds the only way it could be more perfect is it was
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:32.760]  180 seconds but but but let's go to McAfee to up to illustrate the guys
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:36.280]  married to a black lady no one's ever challenged him he's not connected to
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:41.720]  anything racist it doesn't matter watch what I do to him and it's the same thing
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:45.480]  the social justice warriors do they don't have jobs they don't have charm they
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:50.680]  have no future but they run around like little bots in their in their community
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:56.680]  organizer roles messing with people all day their creeps here it is oh that's
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:01.120]  totally wrong look I just about I just about when I in fact Chris is my number
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:06.200]  one when Chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign he called me said
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:10.960]  Donald what you've got is a movement we spoke today in Kentucky you've never
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:14.920]  seen a crowd like that that had to be 20,000 people inside this massive
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:19.360]  convention center and it was incredible when Chris joined we had a news
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:23.960]  conference and they asked me the exact same question I said I disavow now right
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:28.200]  after the program that we're talking about and I thought it was clear but you
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:31.080]  know we're talking about groups groups groups I do have to know the name of the
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:34.280]  group because who knows I mean have to give me the name of the group but right
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:38.400]  after what I reviewed it I put out a tweet and I put out on Facebook that I
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.560]  totally disavow now everybody knew I did that but the press refused to look at
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:47.960]  that I was right after and I disavowed then I disavowed today on ABC with
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:52.000]  George Stephanopoulos I disavowed again I mean how many times you're supposed to
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.200]  disavow but I disavow and hopefully it's the final time I have to do it but if
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:00.960]  you look at Facebook and if you look at Twitter right after the show I put out a
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:04.400]  statement because I want everybody to be sure yes go ahead weekend of back and
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:09.520]  forth I disavow okay I don't know anything about David Duke okay we still

[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:05.920]  repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America your response well first
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:09.600]  of all Mitt Romney is a failed candidate should have won the race and he failed
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:14.440]  miserably he was a terrible candidate for the Republicans secondly David Duke
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:19.920]  and all would disavow I disavowed him on Friday I disavowed him right after that
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:22.800]  because I thought if there was any question and you take a look at Twitter
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:27.280]  almost immediately after on Twitter and Facebook they would disavow again I
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.200]  disavowed him every time I speak to somebody virtually and you know they
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:34.880]  just keep it going they keep it going and they said oh we never looked at your
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:38.720]  Twitter account we never looked at Facebook I said take a look at Facebook it
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.240]  was totally disavowed everyone follows that right now to make a clear and
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.480]  unequivocal statement renouncing the support of all white supremacists of
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:50.280]  course I am of course I am that's where Trump communications Facebook and
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:54.200]  Twitter quality as I have you take a look at Palm Beach Florida I built the
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:58.720]  Mar-a-Lago Club totally open to everybody we still don't know if the
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.520]  Republican front-runner wholly rejects the controversial support it's a
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:05.840]  question Trump has been struggling to answer clearly for months they said that
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:10.960]  two days after he did that piece before was Stephanophilus think of the level
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.760]  of deception that was Tuesday morning they put that out he was on Stephanophilus
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:20.240]  Sunday and totally disavowed everything all white supremacy and then they still
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.480]  said they don't know he disavows white supremacy and then in that press
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:28.160]  conference that we carried live and followed Tuesday night with our live
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:32.920]  coverage we got live coverage tonight as well the Republican debate it was
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:38.560]  amazing three different reporters he's like I just disavowed one minute ago
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:43.880]  okay I disavowed maybe get him go why won't you disavow he went wait a minute
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:48.760]  because they were gonna cut that for those news channels them saying why won't
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:52.560]  you disavow and not show what was on two minutes before hoping their viewers
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:26:01.360]  didn't catch the press conference it's all about deceiving you and you notice
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.040]  McAfee started getting irritated there at a certain point I said listen you're
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.440]  gonna disavow it that's why Ventura came out who's known for not being a racist
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:12.960]  in fact they even use it against me maybe people guilt him into everything you
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.600]  know open borders you name it going I wouldn't even disavow it people are gonna
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:21.080]  tell me what somebody else is doing to make me say something and then that
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.480]  that's why he disavowed it three times and then wouldn't do it anymore for about
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:28.520]  a day and they made a big deal out of he's like already did it so I get it you
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:32.760]  know I said Trump was dumb to not disavow even more upfront but I get the
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:35.280]  fact that I've had people call up and ask me if I'm racist and I just go I'm not
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.360]  answering that I mean at a certain point it just gets old like do you rape
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:45.840]  your wife the answer is no you know do you sell PCP on street corners no do you
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:51.080]  rob old ladies no and stop asking me the question it's guilt by association it's
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.200]  a demonization technique and it's targeting these idiots in the street
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.080]  that come up to our reporters and threaten them and go I want to see Donald
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:00.360]  Trump killed I thought it's a joke you're out here supporting that bigot
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:06.760]  racist who hates Hispanics Mexico has a southern fence and guys with machine
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:13.320]  guns for Guatemala but we can't have one it's just we're pathetic we get
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:16.440]  lectured by everybody we get treated like garbage and then here's the mint
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:24.480]  Romney clip from four years ago versus today short and sweet it's going up an
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:30.480]  info wars.com as we speak let's make it go viral here it is Donald Trump has
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:35.280]  shown an extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works to
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:39.800]  create jobs for the American people what little he has said is enough to know
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:44.920]  that he would be very bad for American workers and for American families he
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:49.440]  understands that our economy is facing threats from abroad he's one of the few
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:52.720]  people who stood up and said you know what China has been cheating they've
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.520]  they've taken jobs from Americans they haven't played fair we have to have a
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:01.880]  president who will stand up to cheaters his proposed 35% tariff like penalties
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:07.520]  would instigate a trade war and that would raise prices for consumers kill
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:12.400]  our export jobs and lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all stripes to flee
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:16.400]  America I spent my life in the private sector not quite as successful as this
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.120]  guy but successful nonetheless sufficiently successful to understand

[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.320]  lot more than Obama I held my nose and supported him in the last election but
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:14.800]  man they are made they are pulling out the stops on Trumpus in a big way we
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:18.680]  need to get all the men all the women all the kids out there I'm dubbing the

[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:06.920]  debate audience with anti-Trump insiders well that's kind of been going on
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:10.800]  already for the past few debates the Donald could face another hostile crowd
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:15.480]  in Detroit article up by Paul Joseph Watson most are likely unaware that a
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:19.200]  sizable portion of the debates ticket allocation was controlled by the
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:24.320]  Michigan Republican State Chair reports DC whispers namely Rona Romney
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:28.800]  McDaniel as a Detroit news reports the Michigan Republican Party received more
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:33.520]  than 21,000 ticket requests for Thursday's presidential debate in Detroit

[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:30.280]  doesn't get 50% of the delegates he said that's absolutely happening in Texas
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:35.120]  under states and we had the reports now from hundreds of people and news TV news
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:38.840]  radio we have the viral reports documenting it where people would vote
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:45.400]  for Trump and it would flip to Rubio or Cruz and it is a big big deal and now we
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:47.800]  have them say they're gonna have a broker convention they're gonna steal it
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:52.400]  right mark got it on tape the audio is up on info wars.com from the Koch
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:56.320]  brothers run meeting where they then send their head campaign person to run
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:59.920]  Rubio's campaign but say they quote in the New York Times and Washington Post I
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:04.680]  love the quote we're not involved at all in the primary we're giving no money you

[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:37.880]  these candidates the Democrats are just like communist but Mitt Romney is a liar
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:41.840]  and and is really stabbing Donald Trump in the back it's very sickening and I
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:45.000]  would say this video needs to go mega viral it's on info wars.com red link

[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:32.160]  I mean it's just just a charnel house of satanic behavior all the hypocrisy the
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:37.760]  the Koch brothers the Democrats the Republican leadership just the entire
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.760]  establishment the Davos group the Financial Times of London Larry Summers
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:46.240]  that created the derivatives in the subprime scams for the Clintons every
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:51.080]  evil goblin like establishment creature has crawled out from under their rocks
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:54.880]  crawled out from under pedophile command bases crawled out of their narcos
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:00.560]  state layers in fact forget a lion how about a night challenging a bunch of
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:07.840]  pus filled giant fat dragons dragging themselves along drunk on the blood of
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:12.720]  the innocent and this is phenomenal I've never seen anything in the history of
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:18.120]  of politics and in modern systems like this the entire power of the dying
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:25.200]  dinosaur horror media at Trump will they risk open revolt if you think the
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:30.000]  tsunami of support behind Trump with the establishment attacking him is big if
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.360]  they steal it at a broker convention it is going to be a 50 on the rector scale
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:39.960]  I know it doesn't go above 10 it is going to be seismic earth shattering it is
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:44.000]  going to be insane and and they're openly trying to steal it they're openly
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:50.720]  organizing it I want to thank Roger Stone of stonezone.com for coming on
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:55.800]  with us again the consummate Trump insiders confidant of 40 years ran
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:59.320]  major campaigns involved a lot of big did the old Republican recount in in
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:03.920]  Florida turned against the Republican establishment after that you know who
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:08.800]  is he's been on a lot lately Mr. Stone you made major international headlines
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.160]  they came out in a bunch of newspapers 24 hours after you were on and drugs
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:17.840]  carried that report where you said they met they're giving 75 million 25 million
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:21.400]  this week they're sending their campaign had to run his Rubio's but he doesn't
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:24.240]  win Florida they're out they're not going to give money to Cruz which has now
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:28.840]  come out you laid everything out you said that they're going to try to have a
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:33.080]  broker convention that that you had your moles your quizzlings there and now
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:35.920]  Breitbart I know you're right for Breitbart I wonder if your quizzling is
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.960]  their quizzling or maybe there's multiple patriots in there but they've
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:42.920]  got to be upset now because here are the Koch brothers coming out saying stones
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:46.640]  wrong we haven't given any money the Republicans this cycle well you know the
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.760]  Federal Elections Commission it's massive it's hundreds of millions they
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:53.240]  were in the news last year saying they're planning to give a billion we
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:57.200]  showed that article earlier we'll show it again while you're on screen what is
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:00.480]  happening here I mean this is this is just so epic I don't even have words
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:07.040]  mr. Stone well it's the last dying gasp of the of the two-party duopoly of the
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:10.920]  folks who've been running this country for the last 30 years and who have run
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:16.600]  it into the ground everything I told you last week Alex has come to pass the
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:21.440]  Cokes are clever they say oh we're not spending our money in an anti-Trump
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:26.600]  effort no they aren't their associates Paul Singer and Stanley Hubbard and the
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:30.600]  Ricketts all of whom were at their meeting or represented at their meeting so
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:35.680]  weasel words very carefully worded our associates are spending the money we're
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:39.840]  not spending the money I also predicted to you that Mitt Romney would be in the
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:45.160]  fray after months of dead silence from Mitt Romney he started attacking
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:48.840]  Donald Trump on his Twitter feed the night of the last debate he is now
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:55.280]  scheduled this this announcement today this speech today in which he did what
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:43:01.040]  his father George Romney did to Barry Goldwater a last desperate attack to make
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:06.360]  sure that he is unelectable look being called a phony by Mitt Romney is like
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:11.640]  being called ugly by a frog ran up and down the country three years ago saying
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:17.640]  Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan Alex Mitt Romney never supported
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:22.440]  Ronald Reagan he was a Democrat not in 1980 he supported Paul song is the left
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:26.680]  wing Democrat senator from Massachusetts I worked on the Reagan campaign
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:30.760]  Massachusetts was a state I worked on Matt Romney was nowhere to be found
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:35.960]  because he wasn't even a Republican the guy calls Trump a phony he's had more
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.480]  plastic surgery and more hairdos than Hillary Clinton there's nothing genuine
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:45.200]  about this guy he's not a conservative not even remotely even when he tried to
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:49.840]  sound like when he said he was severely conservative what does that mean no
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:54.720]  liberty-believing conservative would describe themselves that way so I think
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:58.840]  he's the sunny listin of American politics I saw those debates I think he
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:05.240]  took a dive that's what I think so this is the last gas of the establishment I
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:09.880]  predict to you now he is sticking his toe in the water to see what the reception
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:14.080]  is like there is a statement by one of his lackeys today up in Breitbart saying
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:20.360]  this is today's assault on Trump was only the first step so you know he should
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:25.560]  get in the water he should enter the late primaries he has until April 29th to
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:31.200]  file for California and New Jersey and a spate of others you know when it wasn't
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:34.520]  that Teddy Roosevelt who is not one of my favorite presidents said the credit
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:39.560]  belongs not to the man who stands on the sideline with the man in the arena and
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:43.920]  the man who gets in the arena so met if you're so opinionated if you're so tough
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:48.800]  get in the arena with Donald Trump file for those late primaries has he not
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:52.560]  become a true Judas Iscariot to be his friend to play golf with him eat dinner
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:56.480]  with him to often on knowing for 20 years and then to get up there and
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:01.240]  literally 180 in front of everyone I mean I gotta say Mitt Romney is a true
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:06.680]  Benedict Arnold piece of trash well I would Alex I would suggest that your
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:11.520]  folks go right now and get the media clips of Romney praising Trump at the
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:16.280]  press conference in which Trump endorsed Romney we calls him an incredible
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:21.640]  business success where he admits that he is richer than Romney where he praises
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:25.400]  him get those clips and you'll see what we're dealing with a total Judas
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:31.760]  Judas Iscariot and now kicking himself because remember Mitt wanted to run in
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:38.240]  2016 he didn't make the race because he deemed Jeb Bush unstoppable and by the
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:42.800]  way he's attacking with more vitriol and more vicious words Donald Trump then
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:47.960]  he did Obama he was like wearing giant pillow size gloves and Obama was
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:51.840]  attacking him with a hatchet and Romney I think pretty much just took a dive I
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:54.520]  think it's pretty clear now he's a Democrat operative probably already has
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:57.940]  been and it's a hundred percent clear he's a Democrat operative not just a
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:01.480]  rhino he probably gets direct orders from Obama and the payoff I'm sure it
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:05.080]  was extravagant what a traitor to this country his family his god and
[01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:08.600]  everything else but since you mentioned that clip we have the clip Roger we need
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:11.560]  you to help this go viral it's a one-minute clip you can send it to
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:17.240]  Trump we've tweeted it at Donald it's just 70 seconds that destroys Mitt Romney
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:22.080]  the articles on info wars.com this video destroys Mitt Romney's claims against
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:29.840]  Trump here it is. Donald Trump has shown an extraordinary ability to understand
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:34.400]  how our economy works to create jobs for the American people what little he has
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:39.240]  said is enough to know that he would be very bad for American workers and for
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:44.400]  American families he understands that our economy is facing threats from abroad
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:47.800]  he's one of the few people who stood up and said you know what China has been
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:52.320]  cheating they've they've taken jobs from Americans they haven't played fair we
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:57.280]  have to have a president who will stand up to cheaters his proposed 35% tariff
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:02.200]  like penalties would instigate a trade war and that would raise prices for
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:07.760]  consumers kill our export jobs and lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:11.880]  stripes to flee America I spent my life in the private sector not quite as
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:16.760]  successful as this guy but successful nonetheless sufficiently successful to
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:20.800]  understand what it takes to get America to be the most attractive place in the
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:27.160]  world for innovators entrepreneurs and business and job creators he inherited
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:33.560]  his business he didn't create it a business genius he is not by the way
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:37.040]  that's an honesty moron if you inherit money and then make even more it means
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:41.160]  you're even more successful because usually people are spoiled and lose it
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:45.680]  all you do inherit great genetics but then you know you also are in the the
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:49.880]  environment of having things so good most rich kids tend to not do so well he
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:52.560]  worked from his first dad on record I've seen the documentaries that are three
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:55.200]  hours long on history channel that you're part of they talked to everybody
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:59.320]  he was working when he was 12 years old he was he was out there and he got a
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:04.040]  million dollars from his dad and by the time his dad died he had his own
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:07.720]  separate business Trump had made billions and billions and his dad then
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:12.640]  gave 200 billion you know different parts of the family so Trump dwarfed his
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:17.840]  father but but it's just incredible how they lie unlike the bushes who never
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:21.360]  made any money and had all these failed oil companies that really CIA drug
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:26.760]  dealing fronts with silver spoons shoved in their addled mouths well the irony
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:30.560]  this of course is that Mitt Romney inherited a fortune from his father
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:34.560]  George Romney who made his money at American Motors in Detroit so what is
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:39.160]  meant talking about in terms of privilege in terms of entitlement look
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:44.160]  this is not about Republican Democrat this is about the globalists versus the
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:48.320]  one and only nationalist running for president this country this year this
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:52.840]  cycle down Trump believes in American sovereignty down Trump believes in
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:58.600]  American strain he is scaring the daylights out of the out of Roger our
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:01.600]  listeners know this they're sold on Trump I'd say 90% now even people that
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:04.640]  were against him really obviously mean they see it it's clear what are the new
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:08.480]  attacks what's the next big shoot a drop how big is it you talked about this they
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:11.280]  talked about a broker convention you said inside the Koch brother meeting
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:16.240]  running the whole show now their campaign guys running Rubio's campaign how
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:20.160]  big is it that Breitbart has this audio it's like it's on enforce.com I could
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:23.000]  play the whole thing here where they admit that they're gonna steal the
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.960]  election at the broker deal now we see shaving it appears I want you to confirm
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:30.920]  that you said earlier you agree at Texas and other levels I believe Trump really
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:35.960]  won Texas yeah first of all I think I've been working with something called the
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:41.720]  Trump ballot security project where we have tried to respond immediately to
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:47.240]  complaints of voter irregularities and frauds we have over 600 individual
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:52.200]  complaints now spread into six counties in Texas where people tell us they
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:58.240]  voted for Donald Trump only to see their vote tallied overwhelmingly for Marco
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:02.960]  Rubio don't need a lawsuit then is raw attention to this immediately yeah I
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:07.280]  think it's vital I urge your I urge those who agree with us to go to stop
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:13.560]  the steal org to help us in this effort we have we have to send teams now to
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:17.720]  Ohio where we're beginning to get reports about irregularities in the
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:22.360]  absentee balloting process which I think is a precursor to more stealing on the
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:26.840]  actual election day course I tell you the Ohio Republican machine is more
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:30.640]  adept at this than any Republican and that's why K6 says he will stand or fall
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:35.920]  on Ohio because he knows the fixes in yeah no so my question as far as Texas
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:40.640]  is concerned is this Carl Roe vet work I don't think we got an honest count I
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:45.640]  think we got a distorted count I actually we're looking into smaller but
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:50.840]  significant reports of irregularities in Oklahoma the only other state obviously
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:53.200]  and I talked to people that were down there as election judges it was almost
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:57.480]  all Trump but then magically he didn't win and then everybody I mean everybody

[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:22.680]  things he broke Friday here in studio but also out on the street with our
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:27.060]  interview that ended up coming true and being proven to be accurate he said get
[01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:30.420]  ready for Mitt Romney to come in they're getting him thought out and prepared
[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:33.780]  he'll start coming out and attacking Trump now and then that's just him
[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:37.740]  preparing for folks to beg him to quote run so it doesn't look like he's coming
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:42.940]  into the convention and a broker convention and just stealing it and
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:49.220]  sure enough boom he's now out there doing that I mean I had friends call up
[01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:53.380]  that their wife you know had the vote flip and I know the guy's wife you know
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:55:01.420]  she's a computer manager expert there were dozens of calls per news show on
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:07.060]  590 where I've worked for years off and on for 20 something years you know the
[01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:11.860]  news station here in town that were part of and we went and interviewed those
[01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:15.780]  folks and they had a flooding the newsroom as well and jacari went out
[01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:19.180]  and talked to folks on the street and they were talking about an election
[01:55:19.180 --> 01:55:25.460]  judges were saying yeah we're hearing and it's happening I mean judges off
[01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:28.260]  camera going no this is going on this is happening and it's Trump that it's
[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:32.180]  flipping from it's not oh sometimes it's Trump sometimes it's Rubio sometimes
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:36.020]  it's Cruz sometimes it's Carson sometimes it's casing that's a big deal
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:42.140]  clearly explain to people if Trump's got 320 and they've got was the 370
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:46.220]  something now because it's changed as more votes came in then again they're
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:51.080]  more than 50% at the convention that means they can bypass him and and give
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:55.780]  it whoever they want and are they that arrogant Roger yeah look I think they
[01:55:55.780 --> 01:56:00.300]  will stop at nothing this is ruler ruin they don't mind if the Republican
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:03.740]  nomination is worthless at the end of the day said that they want Hillary they
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:07.980]  love her they well they would certainly prefer her to Donald Trump so this is
[01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:12.540]  very clear what they have planned by keeping this a multi-candidate race by
[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:17.780]  keeping as many candidates in the race as possible with Ted Cruz probably
[01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:24.820]  stealing or or the net result winning Texas because of a steal and presumably
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:29.940]  John Kasich winning Ohio and a hundred votes there it is certainly possible for
[01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:34.100]  Trump to run the tables in these primaries meaning win every primary in
[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:38.900]  caucus but with a plurality not a majority yet to Cleveland with the
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:44.260]  largest block of delegates close to the magic number but not quite there and the
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:49.180]  establishment stalls him understanding that on the second ballot hundreds of
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:54.860]  delegates that are legally bound to Trump are now free to do whatever they
[01:56:54.860 --> 01:56:58.940]  want this is how the big steal work and I've seen it with Ron Paul with the
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:04.140]  whole room in Texas goes Ron Paul they go up yeah no I'm not Ron Paul Mitt
[01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:06.620]  Romney and then the master delegate just steals it in front of everybody
[01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:11.980]  anyways well and and they control the rules committee now currently the rules
[01:57:11.980 --> 01:57:16.100]  say in order to even have your name put in nomination you have to have the
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:21.900]  majority of the delegates in eight states it used to be six states but when
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:26.620]  Ron Paul who I admire enormously achieved the six states they changed it to
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:29.700]  eight and if he had gotten eight they would have changed you know I know Ron
[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:33.020]  Paul's a purist and I admire him and I love him and he's a great man but he's
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:37.860]  been screwed over just like Trump is he sees the populism maybe if Trump said
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:41.300]  hey I'd make you Treasury Secretary so so so that Paul could know he'd have some
[01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:47.660]  say we need Ron Paul to endorse him come on Dr. Paul well such an agreement of
[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:51.140]  course would be illegal you can't I don't mean I don't mean literally I'm just
[01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:54.940]  saying if Trump made noise like hey I'd listen to Ron Paul what I have to say is
[01:57:54.940 --> 01:58:00.900]  I want men and women like Ron Paul in my administration he's already said as I
[01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:06.060]  predicted on the show he wants to audit the Fed which is enormous because no
[01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:12.340]  other Republican candidate other than Rand Paul takes that position I agree
[01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:18.260]  the support of Ron Paul would be very valuable now but this is just broken
[01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:22.300]  info wars calm Mitt Romney's changed his official Facebook page saying he's

[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:04.180]  we're testing the Facebook to approve it and accidentally published it that he's

[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:28.740]  last week Mitt Romney is the he's the anointed horse it's very clear Marco
[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:33.380]  Rubio cannot make it he has not been able to come in first in any state he's
[02:01:33.380 --> 02:01:38.700]  heading for a crushing defeat in his home state primary on March 15th unless
[02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:44.700]  they steal it this is why the the the Trump ballot security project that I'm
[02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:49.500]  working on is so important because the the establishment will stop at nothing
[02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:54.580]  we've seen Karl Rove rig election results before as he did in Ohio for George
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:59.300]  W. Bush don't put anything beyond the Republican machine and the globalist
[02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:05.180]  they must stop Trump I I think Romney will run I think this was the warm-up
[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:10.820]  and I think that you know he's the guy is the last dying gasp of the
[02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:15.980]  establishment they have no one left because Trump decimated Jeb he's
[02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:22.340]  decimated Marco he would decimate Kasek but Kasek can't get any traction he's
[02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:26.220]  that he's running fifth in the Michigan primary where he said he's gonna make his
[02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:31.300]  last stand so Romney and that is now the designated hitter for the for the
[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:36.260]  bipartisan two-party duopoly and they're gonna make their last in there but
[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:40.980]  remember they don't mind if they blow up the Republican Party they don't mind if
[02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:44.540]  they blow up the party's chances to win they're claiming Trump is doing that
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:49.140]  they're claiming Trump is doing that but they're the suicide bombers no
[02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:53.100]  question about it in fact Trump has moved to a more unifying message if you
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:56.880]  go back to the last debate he clearly said he respected the other candidates
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:01.180]  on the stage he was acting in a conciliatory manner until he was
[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:06.180]  viciously attacked by little Marco so look one thing I know about Donald Trump
[02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:12.180]  if you punch him be prepared to get punched back at twice the velocity the
[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:18.020]  guy's a fighter he would wipe Romney up in the late primaries so mitt get in
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:23.580]  come on the water's fine jump in in California is Dumbo going to fly away say
[02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:28.820]  again what when is when is Marco Dumbo gonna fly away I suspect that if he loses
[02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:34.460]  the March 15th primary in his home state here in Florida he is done I fully
[02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:40.620]  expect Governor Rick Scott to endorse Trump Scott is a man of courage he comes
[02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:44.780]  from outside the political order he's not a career politician he and Trump have
[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:48.700]  an excellent relationship I have no inside information I just think it is
[02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:52.780]  likely that would be a major boost here in the sunshine state but right now
[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:57.580]  let's recognize Rubio is the senator representing the state Trump is running
[02:03:57.580 --> 02:04:02.980]  ahead of him in the public polls by almost 25 points final questions and
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:06.140]  obviously I appreciate you popping in on almost daily basis because so much is
[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:10.380]  moving so fast what about this Koch brother plan they're talking about to
[02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:13.580]  run a third party to scuttle the Republicans a right-wing party to
[02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:16.980]  steal votes that's incredibly transparent and then what about the
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:20.660]  Trump's talk if they violate your contract him running third party is it
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:24.940]  the answer stay in the Republican race fight it all the way yeah I believe that
[02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:29.020]  it is I think that that's the first of all that having done this since I played
[02:04:29.020 --> 02:04:33.740]  some role in getting my friend Governor Gary Johnson on the ballot in 48 states
[02:04:33.740 --> 02:04:38.220]  the Cokes may not understand how difficult it is to get on the ballot
[02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:41.700]  particularly as an independent about a third party they'd have to try to buy the
[02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:45.980]  libertarian party you know what they'd have to have a real libertarian who
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:49.500]  would that be who's going to play the Stooges game for them I know what you
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:51.540]  know what I know you've got to go we have another guest but do two more
[02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:53.940]  minutes because I'm gonna tell you Ventura is getting ready to get in as
[02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:57.740]  the libertarian nominee I want to ask you I think that's gonna affect thanks

[02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:20.980]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network coming up in about 10 minutes and for
[02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:24.420]  the balance of this hour we're gonna be joined by my good friend Mark Dice and
[02:08:24.420 --> 02:08:28.060]  the author of the Illuminati in Hollywood why are they so into this why is it in
[02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:32.100]  all the big events how does it tie into the election we'll be talking to Mark
[02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:35.100]  Dice of course has a viral videos that we carry and Drudge carries where he goes
[02:08:35.100 --> 02:08:38.500]  out and has liberals say they want to put gun owners in FEMA camps and kill
[02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:41.420]  Donald Trump and all the rest of it and this is really who he's talking to this
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:45.420]  is the majority of them these are very very sick demented people that's coming
[02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:48.460]  up in a moment Donald Trump's getting ready to have a quick speech and a
[02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:55.100]  response to Mitt Romney so we've got that feed as well from his YouTube and I
[02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:59.340]  just love how they can bypass the whole mainstream media because the mainstream
[02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:03.460]  media was a gatekeeper and speaking of breaking the gatekeeping two best-selling
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:07.300]  books the Bush crime family and Hillary's war on women both available by
[02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:12.580]  Roger Stone at info wars store.com or info wars life.com I know you got to go
[02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:16.100]  Roger I appreciate your time but I'm really concerned I like the fact that
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:20.620]  Ventura said he's on tomorrow Jesse Ventura said I'm not gonna run third
[02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:26.780]  party or get in if it's Donald Trump or Sanders because they're anti-establishment
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:30.900]  in his views and he's been friends with Trump's he's classy but he said if it is
[02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:35.100]  Rubio or Hillary I'm getting in and the libertarians have been talking to him I
[02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:38.220]  know that so they're telling him hey if you come you'll probably get it you're
[02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:43.300]  very popular I don't matter if he's going for it but I think I think I think with
[02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:48.780]  his bona fides that it'd be Ventura so that that's also a prospect there that
[02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:53.100]  could cause a problem but but again overall what other dirty tricks to the
[02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:57.460]  Koch brothers have well first of all let me speak to that I spoke to Governor
[02:09:57.460 --> 02:10:02.140]  Ventura day before yesterday in fact he said to me the same thing he said to you
[02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:06.820]  which is he likes Bernie Sanders because he's outside the machine he really
[02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:11.580]  likes Donald Trump he's outraged by the voter theft that's going on and he would
[02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:16.820]  run if the country is faced with two globalists call it Rubio and Hillary a
[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:21.660]  go step further Alex he asked me if I would manage his campaign if Donald
[02:10:21.660 --> 02:10:25.340]  Trump is cheated out of the nomination and he's not on the ballot I would be
[02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:30.620]  open to helping Jesse Ventura he's a good friend of many years Wow so talk
[02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:33.820]  about moving in the same circles very very interesting yeah that's what he
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:37.820]  told me so he's on to Mara and I think that's classy he likes Donald Trump I
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:40.620]  like similar because it's free market they play golf their friends for 20
[02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:45.220]  something years and then but I was checking into to Trump six eight
[02:10:45.220 --> 02:10:48.420]  months ago before I even started you know giving him some support and saying
[02:10:48.420 --> 02:10:51.940]  he might be good I talked to not just Ventura but four or five other people
[02:10:51.940 --> 02:10:56.220]  that I know have known him for decades and they said no he's what you see is
[02:10:56.220 --> 02:11:00.060]  really him and that's why it makes brash jokes and says you know the difference
[02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:04.460]  between me and a dead possum or or a wet raccoon as I got seven bleeping you
[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:08.100]  know billion dollars and some people that rubs in the wrong way but even
[02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:12.420]  evangelicals have been going for him because they're sick of these fakes you
[02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:16.380]  know that say they're so christian but then backstab people what is your gut
[02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:19.220]  though how is it going for the panicking establishment and closing
[02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:23.820]  because they've gone from trying to act slick to just you're not getting it it's
[02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:27.660]  over we will kill the Republican Party we will give it to Hillary they're on
[02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:32.820]  Fox and CNN and MSNBC saying they will slit the party's throat in front of
[02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:36.260]  everyone well that just shows us they're a foreign occupying army but the
[02:11:36.260 --> 02:11:40.020]  Democrats I mean these people I think have really shown us their dirty skirts
[02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:44.540]  yeah the here's what they don't understand this is not your father's
[02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:49.020]  Republican Party Donald Trump has the capacity to bring millions of new people
[02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:53.340]  into this election he's already doing it people who've never voted before people
[02:11:53.340 --> 02:11:57.220]  who stopped voting because they figured out that politics is fixed against the
[02:11:57.220 --> 02:12:03.020]  common person so they do that at their own peril Trump is a much much stronger
[02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:06.540]  candidate against Hillary Clinton than any other Republican candidate because
[02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:10.540]  he will take the fight right to her and the numbers show that that's not
[02:12:10.540 --> 02:12:13.300]  rhetoric it's why they're scared to death the Republican line that he can't
[02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:17.220]  meet Hillary is a fraud and now Roger I'm gonna let you go because your man my
[02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:21.540]  man our man Donald Trump has just taken the stage let's go to that live feed
[02:12:21.540 --> 02:12:25.020]  via his YouTube I should do well there let's hope I do well there I love
[02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:31.620]  Florida but I was I was going to Detroit and I said to my people I have to
[02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:40.100]  stop in Maine I felt so I just so I wouldn't say that it's a very direct
[02:12:40.100 --> 02:12:44.820]  route would you say instead of going this way I went this way and this way and
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:51.220]  that is good I'm so glad and you know to put to put this incredible sold-out
[02:12:51.220 --> 02:12:55.660]  crowd and you have thousands of people outside to put this crowd together in a
[02:12:55.660 --> 02:13:02.540]  period of what 24 hours and Maine is amazing you know Maine is one of the
[02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:06.540]  most beautiful places on earth and people don't realize how large your land
[02:13:06.540 --> 02:13:11.300]  masses I was talking to Paul as large as all of New England when you think of it
[02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:19.100]  that's some piece of land can I buy some please can I buy so you know I've been
[02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:24.180]  watching with great interest as we get to you know go down the line we've had
[02:13:24.180 --> 02:13:28.580]  some amazing results and right nearby with New Hampshire we was an amazing
[02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:32.860]  incredible thing and by the way they every single time I went to New Hampshire
[02:13:32.860 --> 02:13:37.820]  whenever I met with people they'd always say number one problem number one
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:43.100]  problem heroin number one problem and I'd say how's that possible you know you
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:47.300]  look at these beautiful fields and the beautiful little roads and everything's
[02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:51.420]  so beautiful and it was the number one problem and it comes from our southern
[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:55.220]  border and we're gonna close up that border and we're gonna build a wall and
[02:13:55.220 --> 02:14:00.620]  we're gonna stop the drugs from coming in believe me we're gonna stop and people
[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:03.660]  are gonna come into our country but they're going to come in legally they're
[02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:07.700]  gonna come in legally but we're gonna solve the problem but you know I watch
[02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:12.500]  these pundits and when I first started my wife Milani and I we came down the
[02:14:12.500 --> 02:14:16.900]  escalator right and I first started and it was an amazing thing I said you know
[02:14:16.900 --> 02:14:19.860]  we have to do something because we have people that don't know what they're
[02:14:19.860 --> 02:14:23.420]  doing they don't know what they're doing and running our country and I got
[02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:26.700]  some of that today you know just in hearing some of these things but they
[02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:30.060]  don't know what they're doing we have to do it and it takes guts to run for
[02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:35.300]  president I'm not a politician I'm not a politician all talk no action nothing
[02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:40.940]  gets done and anyway we're coming down and and I said to myself you know there's
[02:14:40.940 --> 02:14:46.540]  so many things and then I watched the pundits and they said oh Trump I don't
[02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:50.100]  know we have some great talent running and I'm trying to figure out where where
[02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:54.780]  what's the talent what's the talent but you know you come down and you do it and
[02:14:54.780 --> 02:14:59.020]  you start talking about trade and you see what happens with trade trade has
[02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:03.820]  been trade has been such a disaster but the pundits all said you know I came
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:08.100]  out at 3% first one and my wife said you know if you run you're gonna win but
[02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:11.020]  you actually have to run you can't say you're gonna run because they won't
[02:15:11.020 --> 02:15:14.020]  poll it but even if they do poll it's people still say you're not gonna run
[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:19.180]  she said but if you run they're gonna win I said oh she's my poster she's my
[02:15:19.180 --> 02:15:23.500]  poster I paid her less money but she's my she's better than the bottom so you
[02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:28.060]  know what happened I started at 3 the first day or something I was at 3 which
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:32.300]  I wasn't exactly thrilled about then it went up to 6 that went up to 12 that
[02:15:32.300 --> 02:15:36.580]  went up to 18 and then it kept going up and every time I went up the pundits
[02:15:36.580 --> 02:15:41.100]  would say he's plateaued you know plateaued well he's always going to get
[02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:46.620]  six that's a six solid group then I went up to 12 well you know that's a solid
[02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:51.180]  group they're up to 24 and he said and don't forget that's with 17 people we
[02:15:51.180 --> 02:15:55.940]  had 17 people that's a lot 24 with 17 people is pretty good so we went up to
[02:15:55.940 --> 02:16:00.980]  24 and they said well that's the max that can't be anymore then we went up to
[02:16:00.980 --> 02:16:14.620]  28 32 so CNN just came out with a poll Trump 49 and I'm very proud of it
[02:16:14.620 --> 02:16:18.340]  because this is not a plateau this is a movement we have a movement going on
[02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:23.980]  folks time magazine did a story but recently couple of weeks ago talking
[02:16:23.980 --> 02:16:27.340]  about what's going on and they've never seen anything like it people have never
[02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:31.420]  seen it they say actually and I don't think I'm exaggerating this at all and
[02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:34.860]  I don't want to exaggerate but many of the great writers of which there are
[02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:38.300]  very few because the media is among the most dishonest people I've ever know
[02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:45.260]  it's true they said that in the history of this country there's never been
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:48.940]  anything like this what's happening we were in Huntsville Alabama the other day
[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:56.140]  we had 35,000 people 35,000 people we were we went to Arkansas which you saw
[02:16:56.140 --> 02:17:04.180]  we want oh is that another one oh yeah yeah get them out get them out

[02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:20.380]  terrible incredible now you know you can be nice but if you're nice they'll say
[02:17:20.380 --> 02:17:25.000]  oh you were so soft then you can be vicious get out of here right and then
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.860]  they'll say you were too harsh so I've developed a nice all right please get
[02:17:28.860 --> 02:17:31.140]  them out
[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:42.020]  it's a great take our free speech folks these are the Salatarians and by the way
[02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:46.180]  you know I'm self-funding my campaign I'm putting up all my money I'm not but
[02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:50.540]  but you have to do all I want I don't want your money I just want one thing
[02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:58.460]  you vote on Saturday get out and don't forget I did that big long turn slightly
[02:17:58.460 --> 02:18:02.500]  long it did a big revolutionary is he's not spending any money and he's not
[02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:06.220]  going to the political class I wouldn't say in the country's history it's the
[02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:10.180]  only time but in the modern television era that this has never happened this is
[02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:15.340]  the death knell to the establishment theme is make America great again
[02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:18.860]  quite frankly they steal it from him it may even make the rebellion bigger I've
[02:18:18.860 --> 02:18:22.900]  met so many people thousands and thousands and thousands of people we
[02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:26.340]  have like this now this is we're only confined by the size of the room this
[02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:30.500]  is packed but this is the size of the room thousands and thousands I'm gonna
[02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:33.420]  go back to Roger Stone real quick because he's gonna leave us he wanted to
[02:18:33.420 --> 02:18:35.260]  stay in here some of the speech I'm gonna go to break and come back with
[02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:38.260]  Mark Dyson we'll have excerpts of the speech as well especially if he goes
[02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:42.740]  after Romney but I tell you he's looking good he's lost a lot of weight he looks
[02:18:42.740 --> 02:18:48.100]  younger he looks sharper and I'm not just kissing Trump's rear end here he looks
[02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:52.180]  like 10 years younger I'm like he's lost 30 40 pounds and it seems like he's
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:56.380]  thriving off the stress this guy really I really respect him now because I'm
[02:18:56.380 --> 02:19:02.100]  always watching a guy on TV this is a real alpha male Roger 60 seconds he's
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:06.140]  drawing strength from the crowds Alex he's having the time of his life this is
[02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:11.460]  a fight that he's enjoying contrast that with Jeb Bush drudgery going through the
[02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:14.940]  motions just give me what I want a president sleep three hours we want an
[02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:19.740]  alpha male yeah look he's a brawler and it's gonna take a brawler take on
[02:19:19.740 --> 02:19:24.580]  Hillary Clinton and to turn this country around he's a fighter and he will never
[02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:28.900]  buckle to the establishment they'll never buckle to the insiders this is the
[02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:33.660]  most exciting thing I've seen in my 40 years in politics and it's a natural
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:39.580]  grassroots phenomena the campaign is not that big Trump is a penny pincher he's
[02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:44.700]  running a cost-efficient campaign getting huge votes it's really it's breathtaking
[02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:47.620]  that's another reason they hate him all those billions that they get from a
[02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:51.820]  regular candidate aren't going all those filthy politicos I tell you Roger Stone
[02:19:51.820 --> 02:19:56.300]  thank you so much thank you for helping drive this insurgency this is 1776 part

[02:24:58.300 --> 02:25:04.300]  m4store.com the Illuminati in Hollywood celebrities conspiracies and secret
[02:25:04.300 --> 02:25:07.540]  societies and cop culture in the entertainment industry and the reason I
[02:25:07.540 --> 02:25:09.900]  know this book just came out a few weeks ago I said it's time to get mark dice
[02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:13.660]  long as his books coming out and notice people won't pay attention to this
[02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:17.940]  normally but when you just had the Oscars and all that weird Babylon stuff
[02:25:17.940 --> 02:25:24.060]  and Tower of Babel and the Super Bowl and all these rock and all this stuff this
[02:25:24.060 --> 02:25:26.980]  isn't just some pentagram at a rock concert to act tough for teenagers this
[02:25:26.980 --> 02:25:30.940]  is serious people you know this is Babylon stuff this is Luciferian and
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:34.860]  then you have Bohemian Grove that was founded by Skull and Bones founded by
[02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:42.500]  the Bavarian Illuminati through that line you have Antonin Scalia dying part
[02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:46.540]  of a secret society of hunters you know it was a secret society that was held in
[02:25:46.540 --> 02:25:50.940]  lodges that is connected to the Illuminati that is founded by Bohemian
[02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:56.260]  Grove refounded in 1961 that's in the Washington Post so with that backdrop
[02:25:56.260 --> 02:26:00.620]  a long segment coming up this is a short segment people understand this is the
[02:26:00.620 --> 02:26:06.580]  real religion of the elite and and they're not like PCP crackheads you
[02:26:06.580 --> 02:26:12.020]  know killing somebody's dog in a trailer they're getting power off of it you
[02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:15.500]  know if somebody's you know it was rotted their brain these are people that
[02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:18.940]  believe Lucifer is God you need to understand that Satanism Luciferians
[02:26:18.940 --> 02:26:23.820]  two different bags and I tend to conflate it to and say Satanism it's
[02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:27.340]  really Luciferianism and you swing a stick around billionaires you hit them
[02:26:27.340 --> 02:26:31.740]  so we're going to Mark Dice here Mark I mean I think that's a way to basically
[02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:35.220]  introduce this right under the surface this stuff's going on you've made a
[02:26:35.220 --> 02:26:39.100]  great study of it what do you think we're facing right now and why are they
[02:26:39.100 --> 02:26:43.820]  bringing so much this out in the open you know we've seen over the last five
[02:26:43.820 --> 02:26:48.140]  years the Illuminati go from what it originally was perceived to be from
[02:26:48.140 --> 02:26:53.300]  many researchers like yourself as a secret society or a mafia of banksters
[02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:58.220]  politicians and media moguls we've seen it morph into the minds of the public as
[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:04.220]  a celebrity secret society and so in the book I've tracked why this happened the
[02:27:04.220 --> 02:27:08.780]  whole agenda essentially with social media becoming a part of everybody's
[02:27:08.780 --> 02:27:15.820]  lives around 2010 2011 everybody now has been introduced to Illuminati symbolism
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:20.820]  the Illuminati quote conspiracy theories because originally people had to go and
[02:27:20.820 --> 02:27:24.860]  seek that information out for themselves shows like yours certain obscure
[02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:31.380]  websites some very popular books but not mainstream so with social media people
[02:27:31.380 --> 02:27:34.900]  who are interested in that kind of information have exposed it to their
[02:27:34.900 --> 02:27:38.860]  friends through posting on Facebook and other social media accounts and so
[02:27:38.860 --> 02:27:43.060]  unfortunately many well-meaning people who are trying to expose the Illuminati
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:47.740]  conspiracy unfortunately don't really have a good grasp of it and it has morphed
[02:27:47.740 --> 02:27:53.100]  into a celebrity secret society and there's also a lot of now but bottom
[02:27:53.100 --> 02:27:57.340]  feeders that you know tell girls who are 15 years old I'm in the Illuminati baby
[02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:02.500]  you know do all this and I'll let you in on it there's also I used to be
[02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:05.660]  pretenders of the throne or I remember in high school and college was always
[02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:08.740]  somebody claiming they were a Rothschild or a Rockefeller and you'd learn two
[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:11.940]  months later they scan everybody you tell folks at college hey that's a scam
[02:28:11.940 --> 02:28:14.580]  artist they wouldn't believe it because they were on a power trip and later you
[02:28:14.580 --> 02:28:17.980]  know be taken it's kind of like the Nigerian scams so I'm now seeing
[02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:22.580]  Illuminati scams absolutely there's a very popular book that's been
[02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:25.300]  published recently I don't want to give it any publicity so I won't name it
[02:28:25.300 --> 02:28:29.780]  specifically which claims to be from the actual Illuminati and then they
[02:28:29.780 --> 02:28:34.180]  encourage the readers to go and give the book a great review on Amazon so that
[02:28:34.180 --> 02:28:39.540]  the Illuminati will consider them for actual membership and it's for suckers
[02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:44.620]  it's muddying the water there are a bunch of Nigerian Illuminati type of scams I
[02:28:44.620 --> 02:28:48.340]  get contacted all the time from people literally wanting to join the Illuminati
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:52.860]  they want to know by the way Kevin Trudeau I literally was ignorant about
[02:28:52.860 --> 02:28:55.900]  him I thought he had a vitamin mineral book he was being persecuted for and
[02:28:55.900 --> 02:28:59.420]  some memory thing once I got informed they're like well Mark does is actually
[02:28:59.420 --> 02:29:02.740]  right criticizing you about this I didn't know he had him on once you know
[02:29:02.740 --> 02:29:06.620]  he has a thing where he's on the Illuminati and you sending money and you
[02:29:06.620 --> 02:29:09.860]  get into it and I was like whoa so I called you up and said okay you got me
[02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:12.700]  on this one you're like oh really thought you knew that I was like I don't
[02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:15.860]  know everything I can't keep track of infomercial people I just do they're
[02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:19.220]  going after him for vitamin and minerals and I'm for the first amendment my
[02:29:19.220 --> 02:29:22.460]  criticism could be could be pretty brutal and yeah you had him on the show
[02:29:22.460 --> 02:29:25.740]  obviously you don't know everything about him but I didn't know when you when
[02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:28.780]  you had him on the show at the time and so for those who don't understand what
[02:29:28.780 --> 02:29:31.540]  we're talking about well stay there I mean let's come back this is a good
[02:29:31.540 --> 02:29:34.540]  entryway into this like what's the real Illuminati and the real occult system
[02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:37.900]  versus what people say and I've been into but he me and Grove I've studied it I
[02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:41.740]  know what it really is and I know Mark studied as well we'll get our views and
[02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:46.300]  then the pop view that's one way they cover stuff up they just make it pop stay
[02:29:46.300 --> 02:29:53.860]  with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[02:33:52.340 --> 02:33:58.380]  everybody to go to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and get the video that's
[02:33:58.380 --> 02:34:02.300]  in the article and make it go viral this video destroys Mitt Romney's claim
[02:34:02.300 --> 02:34:06.380]  against Trump where it's him endorsing him four years ago and and Romney's
[02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:09.820]  saying all these great things about Trump that are the 180 opposite of what
[02:34:09.820 --> 02:34:13.780]  he said today by the way you heard it from Roger Stone a week ago now it's
[02:34:13.780 --> 02:34:17.420]  happening he's getting ready to come in if Rubio fails which it looks like he is
[02:34:17.420 --> 02:34:20.940]  so this is gonna be an unprecedented attempt everything's coming out in the
[02:34:20.940 --> 02:34:26.100]  open but one tactic they have is what Mark Astutley's been pointing out about
[02:34:26.100 --> 02:34:29.900]  three years ago he started to say they're mainlining it they're confusing it and I
[02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:34.020]  was like don't be the Illuminati you know police dice but then I sort of
[02:34:34.020 --> 02:34:37.820]  really see what he was saying he was they are coming out with a lot of truth but
[02:34:37.820 --> 02:34:41.700]  also mixing bull in and is that what's happening with the ex files I mean I
[02:34:41.700 --> 02:34:44.380]  don't want to say that entirely because Carter says he likes me and I'm a good
[02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:47.340]  guy and he's a listener and you know the character he's got based on me as a
[02:34:47.340 --> 02:34:50.100]  nice guy and I'm gonna meet with him soon I'm gonna set the date because I'm
[02:34:50.100 --> 02:34:55.140]  a too busy but he said yeah come out let's meet and but but is that why
[02:34:55.140 --> 02:34:58.860]  they're letting him come out with more truthful scenarios is because they can't
[02:34:58.860 --> 02:35:03.860]  hide it anymore you see but that's okay it shows we're winning but man the open
[02:35:03.860 --> 02:35:08.500]  Illuminati rituals on football and drama shows people say then well what's this
[02:35:08.500 --> 02:35:11.740]  con game where they have these deals where you sign up the Illuminati or you
[02:35:11.740 --> 02:35:15.020]  know you you send them money and you get the secret book really that's what it
[02:35:15.020 --> 02:35:18.780]  always was Adam Weiss hop on to take over the Masons take over the Liberty
[02:35:18.780 --> 02:35:23.340]  movements take over the Rosa Crucians take over a bunch of different
[02:35:23.340 --> 02:35:28.260]  organizations that that were good bad ugly you know a mix and and the letters
[02:35:28.260 --> 02:35:30.620]  from the Illuminati and he's written books about he's an expert we have these
[02:35:30.620 --> 02:35:34.940]  letters his orders are how to get good organizations to join you and not know
[02:35:34.940 --> 02:35:39.540]  what you're doing so the fact that you know some crackhead 18-year-old gets a
[02:35:39.540 --> 02:35:43.100]  14-year-old girl to have sex with him and give him money because he's gonna
[02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:48.140]  let her into the Illuminati she thinks he's gonna meet Jay-Z and Kyan West okay
[02:35:48.140 --> 02:35:52.780]  I know it's Kanye and the Gayfish the point is is that it came from a con it
[02:35:52.780 --> 02:35:56.340]  is a con just like communism came out of the Illuminati and the Jacob is in the
[02:35:56.340 --> 02:36:00.900]  French Revolution that's a fact didn't come with Marx and Engels so when you
[02:36:00.900 --> 02:36:05.380]  realize that communism and all of this is just more a cult con artistry my
[02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:09.540]  grandfather used to say Satan is the cosmic con artist and really that's
[02:36:09.540 --> 02:36:14.180]  what it is so it just never seems to end let's go now about to mark dice his new
[02:36:14.180 --> 02:36:17.820]  book the Illuminati in Hollywood available at mark dice.com Amazon and
[02:36:17.820 --> 02:36:20.540]  bookstores I guess everywhere we're gonna be carrying and I just haven't gotten
[02:36:20.540 --> 02:36:25.520]  around to it in for store.com give me a good deal on it mark okay I've been
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:28.940]  ranting here what do you think of my kickoff there we were using Kevin Trudeau
[02:36:28.940 --> 02:36:35.220]  as kind of a window into this go ahead. What we're seeing in the mainstream is
[02:36:35.220 --> 02:36:39.260]  the the mainstream Hollywood establishment has been obviously promoting
[02:36:39.260 --> 02:36:44.860]  this Illuminati it's a more modern-day version of Satanism and we know that the
[02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:50.340]  New World Order one-world religion the Antichrist will admit will announce that
[02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:54.740]  he is Lucifer that he's Satan to overthrow the evil creator God and offer
[02:36:54.740 --> 02:36:58.980]  everybody freedom and utopia here on earth through the transhumanist
[02:36:58.980 --> 02:37:04.900]  technology so we have these celebrity puppets who are being controlled by the
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:08.660]  studios and we're seeing this with Kesha now who is a very popular pop star who
[02:37:08.660 --> 02:37:12.860]  was posting satanic pentagrams and drinking fake blood out of a harp on
[02:37:12.860 --> 02:37:18.340]  stage now crying in court because she's locked into a contract with her music
[02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:22.740]  producers so these celebrities in the studios in the movie heads at the
[02:37:22.740 --> 02:37:27.900]  Oscars their slaves they are puppets and slaves to their corporate controllers
[02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:32.580]  behind the scenes who are promoting this Illuminati philosophy and their
[02:37:32.580 --> 02:37:36.740]  celebrity pawns who obviously the the general public worship and mimic
[02:37:36.740 --> 02:37:42.580]  mindlessly as modern-day gods so these are the people and the systems being used
[02:37:42.580 --> 02:37:48.980]  to promote Luciferianism or Satanism as the coming one-world religion offering
[02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:54.940]  people success and you can see it most people want to join this Illuminati to
[02:37:54.940 --> 02:37:59.980]  be rich and famous so we've seen people like Kevin Trudeau who has done some
[02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:03.820]  great stuff but unfortunately just went off the rails and out of a
[02:38:03.820 --> 02:38:09.020]  desperate sea or just greed formed his global information network and literally
[02:38:09.020 --> 02:38:13.540]  they changed the website after a while but originally it said Bilderberg group
[02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:18.580]  members Bohemian Grove members Illuminati members skull and bones insert
[02:38:18.580 --> 02:38:23.140]  your high-level secret society member they all left their organizations to
[02:38:23.140 --> 02:38:26.660]  join Kevin Trudeau to form the global information that's right and when you
[02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:30.980]  were saying this Rob Jacobson walks in one day he goes no I sent off for the
[02:38:30.980 --> 02:38:34.740]  natural cures I don't want you know about which is a great book and it covers a
[02:38:34.740 --> 02:38:38.700]  lot of well-known stuff I was like wow yeah vitamin C you know cures scurvy it's
[02:38:38.700 --> 02:38:42.500]  a fact you know why are they taking this guy down but they made it about that
[02:38:42.500 --> 02:38:46.460]  what he would do is then after you buy the book then you get the letter like
[02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:50.980]  it's hand-typed and it says from him join the Illuminati with me I've been to
[02:38:50.980 --> 02:38:56.300]  area 51 and I was like wow marks wow because I couldn't find that when you
[02:38:56.300 --> 02:39:00.260]  were talking about it and then there it was it was like wow this is what he I
[02:39:00.260 --> 02:39:04.380]  don't want to get off onto him it's just a that's an example so the book the
[02:39:04.380 --> 02:39:09.260]  Illuminati in Hollywood is about the real Illuminati how it has morphed into
[02:39:09.260 --> 02:39:14.100]  this supposed celebrity secret society why we're seeing so many celebrities and
[02:39:14.100 --> 02:39:20.060]  major award shows a halftime show that the Super Bowl promoting this as the
[02:39:20.060 --> 02:39:25.620]  secret to success as the secret of their coming savior and it also gets into
[02:39:25.620 --> 02:39:30.700]  some more detailed information about how the movie industry and television
[02:39:30.700 --> 02:39:35.580]  industry are literally and this is an open secret manipulated by the Central
[02:39:35.580 --> 02:39:39.500]  Intelligence Agency and for people who say that that's a conspiracy theory you
[02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:44.020]  can go to CIA.gov and there's a subsection on their website where they
[02:39:44.020 --> 02:39:48.380]  admit and I'll read the print that I just printed it out. Chris Carter admits the CIA
[02:39:48.380 --> 02:39:53.300]  approaches him I can't wait to talk to him in person. This is from CIA.gov and
[02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:58.740]  it's about the entertainment liaison office in the 1990s the CIA assigned one
[02:39:58.740 --> 02:40:03.680]  of their officers as a liaison to Hollywood to work with them to develop
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:08.140]  scripts and films and television shows. And now it's in the headlines that the
[02:40:08.140 --> 02:40:12.580]  CIA and the Pentagon meet daily in huge meetings with all the big producers just
[02:40:12.580 --> 02:40:15.780]  like the former attorney general said let's brainwash the public against guns
[02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:21.340]  that was in one of these big corporate meetings as well. And so this is where the
[02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:26.500]  Department of Defense and the CIA works with Hollywood to produce films like
[02:40:26.500 --> 02:40:31.020]  Top Gun because you can't just get an aircraft carrier and access to jets
[02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:35.740]  unless you go to the government. And so here is from CIA.gov I'm reading this
[02:40:35.740 --> 02:40:39.220]  verbatim it says quote if you're a part of the entertainment industry and you're
[02:40:39.220 --> 02:40:43.460]  working on a project that deals with the CIA the agency may be able to help you.
[02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:47.900]  We're in a position to give greater authenticity to scripts stories and other
[02:40:47.900 --> 02:40:53.020]  products in development that can mean answering questions debunking myths or
[02:40:53.020 --> 02:40:58.060]  arranging visits to the CIA to meet with known intelligence agencies and
[02:40:58.060 --> 02:41:05.420]  officers. So what we have here is an open secret of a liberal Hollywood who has
[02:41:05.420 --> 02:41:10.740]  been carrying the water for torture through films like and television shows
[02:41:10.740 --> 02:41:15.820]  like 24 this is an open secret everybody knows. So here's the question what is the
[02:41:15.820 --> 02:41:19.580]  goal of it on every show attacking manhood attacking the family making men
[02:41:19.580 --> 02:41:22.460]  dumb putting women in all the power positions they admit that's the order
[02:41:22.460 --> 02:41:26.260]  it's why the road where you know film one all the deals they said that it's an
[02:41:26.260 --> 02:41:30.100]  order and we're not against women those positions but this is a order it's not
[02:41:30.100 --> 02:41:34.020]  to empower women it's to break everything up Hollywood they declassified put out
[02:41:34.020 --> 02:41:38.340]  ugly art to quote hurt our minds the CIA admitted that in the 60s that what came
[02:41:38.340 --> 02:41:43.020]  out last year but they're ramping it all up Illuminati sacrificed death the
[02:41:43.020 --> 02:41:47.820]  devil what is what are they trying to bring in they're trying to condition us
[02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:52.020]  for horrors of the Talitarianism they're trying to pre-preparis that's my view
[02:41:52.020 --> 02:41:56.300]  what's yours they're destroying the moral compass the social fabric of the
[02:41:56.300 --> 02:41:59.780]  family in this country they're they're literally paving the path for their
[02:41:59.780 --> 02:42:04.140]  global Messiah who will claim to be God predicted in the Bible one world
[02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:08.540]  religion being called for by the Pope one world government being called for
[02:42:08.540 --> 02:42:12.420]  by the Pope what are people gonna do when the Pope calls the man of sin the
[02:42:12.420 --> 02:42:18.380]  Christ and is the needle to him as the false prophet the vast majority of the
[02:42:18.380 --> 02:42:22.060]  country unfortunately are totally lost and that's why I appreciate you having
[02:42:22.060 --> 02:42:25.460]  me on because I'm no most of your audience is probably familiar with my
[02:42:25.460 --> 02:42:30.060]  social justice warrior persona in my man on the street video so I appreciate
[02:42:30.060 --> 02:42:33.740]  the opportunity to come on so the audience can hear the real me because
[02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:37.940]  this is some very serious material that we're talking about the country I've
[02:42:37.940 --> 02:42:40.900]  been trying to your social justice warrior thing ties in we're nine out of
[02:42:40.900 --> 02:42:44.860]  ten Californians say I want gun owners and forced labor camps I want them
[02:42:44.860 --> 02:42:49.420]  executed I want to burn their bodies I want their property you go yeah they
[02:42:49.420 --> 02:42:53.180]  go and they speak clear English white people of spanish blacks they want
[02:42:53.180 --> 02:42:57.340]  tyranny they have no personal power but they love evil and these are the people
[02:42:57.340 --> 02:43:00.100]  they're gonna use to persecute Christians and people that don't take the
[02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:03.700]  microchips they're already announcing it and you can see it they're gonna say
[02:43:03.700 --> 02:43:06.460]  you don't accept the one world religion you don't let us teach your three year
[02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:10.260]  old how to you know give a blow job you're hateful literally and so we're
[02:43:10.260 --> 02:43:14.140]  gonna put you in a forced labor camp that that is the plan there's a whole
[02:43:14.140 --> 02:43:18.780]  chapter in the book on the gay mafia and obviously it's undeniable that they're
[02:43:18.780 --> 02:43:24.220]  promoting what's under a 2% of the population as if it was 50% of the
[02:43:24.220 --> 02:43:28.780]  people they take a great family show like full house and they reintroduce it
[02:43:28.780 --> 02:43:33.060]  and just as I predicted I'm not even against people that are quote gay but
[02:43:33.060 --> 02:43:37.620]  every TV show I try to watch the new Irish family is is Catholic but they're
[02:43:37.620 --> 02:43:41.300]  breaking up the dad's an idiot and the son has a halo that's a rainbow he's gay
[02:43:41.300 --> 02:43:46.300]  you they're just bombarding us there they are ending our reproductive system
[02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:50.260]  call the devil whatever they want the end of humanity the end of families the
[02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:54.660]  end of procreation its population control their own university documents I
[02:43:54.660 --> 02:43:58.500]  cover an in-game admitted they said in the 60s we will attack male role models
[02:43:58.500 --> 02:44:02.100]  we will break up families we will make women work and we will promote
[02:44:02.100 --> 02:44:07.660]  homosexuality to lower the birth rate you know Alex articulates it so well and
[02:44:07.660 --> 02:44:11.980]  for those who you know want to sit and read and study this material I've
[02:44:11.980 --> 02:44:16.660]  compiled it in the Illuminati in Hollywood you can get it in Amazon.com and I
[02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:19.500]  know I'm ranting it's just you're so right that I'm just backing up what
[02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:23.220]  you're saying and I've talked a lot of the big Hollywood people who know this
[02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:25.780]  is going on and they know I'm a journalist we're a journalist so if
[02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:28.980]  something's off record if something isn't illegal and somebody tells me
[02:44:28.980 --> 02:44:32.780]  something then it didn't ever comes out and they're really sad and scared and
[02:44:32.780 --> 02:44:35.740]  say we hate being ordered to do this and you're right these people above us are
[02:44:35.740 --> 02:44:39.820]  pure evil and oh my god Alex we want to get out of it oh it's horrible and oh my
[02:44:39.820 --> 02:44:42.940]  god my father was so hounded because he wouldn't go with him and he was
[02:44:42.940 --> 02:44:46.100]  exposing him yeah I'm talking about Stanley Kubrick because he wouldn't go
[02:44:46.100 --> 02:44:50.540]  with him look at this perverted agenda and the
[02:44:50.540 --> 02:44:56.340]  blurring of politics and Hollywood we have Joe Biden appearing at the Oscars
[02:44:56.340 --> 02:45:00.460]  granted for a good cause to raise awareness Obama's coming to South by
[02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:06.220]  Southwest with his training wife well you have Lady Gaga who is now the
[02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:10.700]  poster child of supposedly fighting sexual assault when she did a music video
[02:45:10.700 --> 02:45:16.300]  with the infamous pervert alleged sexual predator R. Kelly who I don't know
[02:45:16.300 --> 02:45:20.620]  anybody in their right mind who would even want to be in the same room in the
[02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:23.420]  same so let's not forget she has that bodyguards at night because she is
[02:45:23.420 --> 02:45:26.660]  attacked by ghosts and demon possessed and lives in a living hell and calls
[02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:31.900]  herself a slave yeah she's sold her soul to Satan it's quite clear why would
[02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:39.900]  anyone want to get temporal power to be a horrid slave these are the victims and
[02:45:39.900 --> 02:45:44.420]  willing participants in the mind control system to have somebody like Lady Gaga
[02:45:44.420 --> 02:45:48.900]  being held up as the poster child for fighting against sexual assault is
[02:45:48.900 --> 02:45:55.140]  completely 180 degrees from her previous persona and activities giving R. Kelly a
[02:45:55.140 --> 02:45:59.100]  boost back into the limelight who was indicted by the way on 21 counts of child
[02:45:59.100 --> 02:46:04.140]  porn a case that just mysteriously got thrown out due to technicalities in the
[02:46:04.140 --> 02:46:10.220]  search warrant he's just a such a literal demon incarnated into a into a
[02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:15.340]  person and let R. Kelly is given a boost by Lady Gaga in the music video which
[02:46:15.340 --> 02:46:18.940]  then they scrapped which was promoted and produced rather by Terry Richardson
[02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:23.260]  who's plagued by allegations of sexual harassment in Hollywood and where Lady
[02:46:23.260 --> 02:46:28.220]  Gaga was drugged and then depicted as being let me ask you I mean you live a
[02:46:28.220 --> 02:46:32.180]  little bit outside LA right yeah I would never go up there I'm in San Diego yeah
[02:46:32.180 --> 02:46:35.500]  I'm just make sure I was right I've been down there before I just memory fails I
[02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:39.500]  I used to think it was the smog and that does make you sick and all the you know
[02:46:39.500 --> 02:46:44.620]  everything else in those mountains with the sea but I start feeling ill and when
[02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:47.380]  I'm flying in it took me a while to notice this I used to go out there and
[02:46:47.380 --> 02:46:51.780]  be in films and be on TV and you know do projects I just refuse them now and I'll
[02:46:51.780 --> 02:46:55.180]  go out there maybe every three years now to just do business because I get
[02:46:55.180 --> 02:46:59.700]  physically ill when the planes at 20,000 feet descending into it there is a
[02:46:59.700 --> 02:47:04.940]  spirit there it is and for those who don't know and and I guess I've never
[02:47:04.940 --> 02:47:08.020]  really talked about this you know that I've been in some meetings with some
[02:47:08.020 --> 02:47:11.820]  networks though you know they wanted to talk to me about developing shows so you
[02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:15.540]  know I have a pretty good insider view I you're gonna do shows with some folks
[02:47:15.540 --> 02:47:19.700]  from Motley Cruz stuff like that and I've hung out with paparazzi I've been
[02:47:19.700 --> 02:47:23.900]  involved in and I was in their cars when they were involved in high-speed
[02:47:23.900 --> 02:47:29.620]  chases stalking celebrities I've shadowed them as part of my research
[02:47:29.620 --> 02:47:35.180]  I've been in the high-level board rooms with the Hollywood sign out in the
[02:47:35.180 --> 02:47:41.940]  background in the meetings of Spike TV in Viacom at the sci-fi chain at most
[02:47:41.940 --> 02:47:45.660]  major networks I even had a meeting with and I've never talked about this with
[02:47:45.660 --> 02:47:51.060]  CNN now I met with them to just to talk and I know that it would never go
[02:47:51.060 --> 02:47:54.340]  they're all such zombies they have no ideas so they have these meetings
[02:47:54.340 --> 02:47:58.020]  constantly to actually steal ideas and then they want you to sell out that's
[02:47:58.020 --> 02:48:04.020]  why I've been out let's not exaggerate 50 meetings discovery HBO and all the
[02:48:04.020 --> 02:48:07.300]  ones you let listed I'm not one-upping you know I've just been there with you
[02:48:07.300 --> 02:48:10.260]  as well you know we've been at some of the same places they say oh mark guys
[02:48:10.260 --> 02:48:14.220]  dinner last week and I've just and it's just no I'm not gonna do that you know
[02:48:14.220 --> 02:48:16.540]  we'll put you know we'll pay all this money just make it as fair as people look
[02:48:16.540 --> 02:48:20.460]  dumb you'll be a big star didn't take the deal I know folks that did and I must
[02:48:20.460 --> 02:48:23.500]  say I'm going to have into a didn't so he lost his show but other people did
[02:48:23.500 --> 02:48:28.540]  shows about conspiracies where they then debunk them yeah so I went to a whole
[02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:32.420]  series of meetings in all of these boardrooms with most of the major networks
[02:48:32.420 --> 02:48:40.300]  just as part of my own research I was like A&E did you name it CNN and I have
[02:48:40.300 --> 02:48:46.100]  photos to prove all of this as well and so they I've been you know that I went
[02:48:46.100 --> 02:48:49.460]  to the mountain with like devil the devil took Jesus to the mountain offered
[02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:53.060]  him all the kingdoms of the world Jesus said no so I have stared the devil in
[02:48:53.060 --> 02:48:56.260]  the face even giving the speech about how you can't beat the New World Order and
[02:48:56.260 --> 02:49:01.220]  it really wants to help people you know I had one Hollywood producer I'm not
[02:49:01.220 --> 02:49:05.740]  gonna mention any names so very he would know his shows I mean it must be a
[02:49:05.740 --> 02:49:09.500]  speech because I've been given it five times and I mean by heads of radio
[02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:14.860]  networks heads of studios he he literally started praising Satan in the
[02:49:14.860 --> 02:49:18.900]  meeting okay I'm not joking and so let's stop right there let's tell this story
[02:49:18.900 --> 02:49:24.900]  right now well we were talking about some particular philosophies and some
[02:49:24.900 --> 02:49:28.860]  shows that were out there about conspiracies and secret societies and
[02:49:28.860 --> 02:49:34.900]  things like that and he was very sympathetic towards Satan and I was I
[02:49:34.900 --> 02:49:39.980]  was stunned and literally the Hollywood sign is out in the background I could
[02:49:39.980 --> 02:49:45.660]  literally turn and see it and so I have went to these meetings as a research
[02:49:45.660 --> 02:49:50.500]  project not willing to sign with these people just knowing that I could get
[02:49:50.500 --> 02:49:55.500]  inside and learn how this system works and throughout the course of these
[02:49:55.500 --> 02:49:59.860]  meetings I've had the production company that I was working with they would
[02:49:59.860 --> 02:50:04.340]  they would call say hey can you remove this video from YouTube I don't think
[02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:08.340]  that this the the executives would really like that and I said well then you
[02:50:08.340 --> 02:50:12.220]  don't you don't obviously don't know anything about me and the company that
[02:50:12.220 --> 02:50:16.820]  approached me they were well-meaning but it was a very interesting you finally
[02:50:16.820 --> 02:50:21.180]  get in a Bentley and go to a party and there's major movie stars there and they
[02:50:21.180 --> 02:50:26.740]  go Alex what's wrong with Lucifer just join us and you're like whoa this
[02:50:26.740 --> 02:50:31.820]  stuff's real and I'm like I'm out of here at the Oscars which was last week
[02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:36.540]  it's it's very symptomatic of this how worldly these people are they're decked
[02:50:36.540 --> 02:50:42.300]  out in their twenty thirty thousand dollar gowns with their diamonds which I wonder
[02:50:42.300 --> 02:50:46.820]  how many children slaves and it's like it's like it's like Jacob and Harley's
[02:50:46.820 --> 02:50:51.580]  chains in the Christmas Carol I mean who wants that crap if it was somebody's
[02:50:51.580 --> 02:50:56.340]  expense once you once you don't buy into it you like to shift you go up a level
[02:50:56.340 --> 02:50:58.580]  once you've refused it I don't know how to describe it I'm glad you've
[02:50:58.580 --> 02:51:01.660]  experienced it what would your life be like if you woke up each morning with

[02:54:58.220 --> 02:55:05.340]  to their presidential library in the lawsuit that was executed by the Western
[02:55:05.340 --> 02:55:10.660]  Journalism Center Joseph Farah and others they got 30 plus thousand pages some
[02:55:10.660 --> 02:55:14.340]  of it's blacked out but most of it is about stopping freedom stopping a new
[02:55:14.340 --> 02:55:19.220]  press not just right wing but left wing discrediting anybody stopping money
[02:55:19.220 --> 02:55:22.940]  ever going to new media because if people ever start buying new media they'll
[02:55:22.940 --> 02:55:26.500]  buy diversity and choice and actual real reporting and then it's over for them
[02:55:26.500 --> 02:55:30.940]  and instructing the media how to call Joseph Farah a conspiracy theorist this
[02:55:30.940 --> 02:55:36.940]  is before drudge even showed up and then later how to stop drudge and we've
[02:55:36.940 --> 02:55:39.700]  covered it they've written articles about it that's why you got to get the

[02:57:07.180 --> 02:57:10.460]  that you know wants to put gun owners in FEMA camps because I forget I know who
[02:57:10.460 --> 02:57:14.020]  you are other folks don't know I do joke videos and people think it's serious like
[02:57:14.020 --> 02:57:18.620]  you really fell down it's like no but you got to go out and go hey I'm for
[02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:22.100]  Hillary let's kill all the conservatives in 9 out of 10 say let's murder them I
[02:57:22.100 --> 02:57:26.100]  mean these are really sick evil people but they're also soft and weak it's
[02:57:26.100 --> 02:57:32.020]  weird how such evil people are so unlearned it's so ignorant people perish
[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:35.340]  for lack of knowledge I mean you can just see the judgment coming down and
[02:57:35.340 --> 02:57:40.060]  LA is the model it's not like that right outside LA and so you look at that I
[02:57:40.060 --> 02:57:45.220]  believe I'm not I believe the spiritual entity Satan is residing in Los Angeles
[02:57:45.220 --> 02:57:49.460]  and that that's why Hollywood and the projection of this evil across the
[02:57:49.460 --> 02:57:52.540]  world's coming from there the devil lives on the west coast of the United
[02:57:52.540 --> 02:57:57.660]  States I really think the spirit the entity the the the the creature from
[02:57:57.660 --> 02:58:01.780]  another dimension the Bible talks about whatever this entity is that every
[02:58:01.780 --> 02:58:06.860]  culture warrants of resides there and can project his power worldwide and you're
[02:58:06.860 --> 02:58:10.100]  right in the middle of it fighting and that's why I can't be there because
[02:58:10.100 --> 02:58:13.100]  these people are such slaves go ahead we've got one minute I'm gonna come back
[02:58:13.100 --> 02:58:17.820]  to you I live in San Diego because it's nice and warm and I hate going to Los
[02:58:17.820 --> 02:58:21.220]  Angeles I'll go there a few times a year for meetings so I can research and
[02:58:21.220 --> 02:58:26.340]  give interviews and get interviews but in the book the illuminati in Hollywood
[02:58:26.340 --> 02:58:30.660]  I hope everybody checks it out because as you can see I'm very serious for those
[02:58:30.660 --> 02:58:33.340]  who don't know and see the man on the street stuff I might have come across
[02:58:33.340 --> 02:58:36.460]  like it just a you know a comedian or a clown but I'm there 70 seconds I'm
[02:58:36.460 --> 02:58:39.060]  coming back to you I was ranting about this but it's so important and you get
[02:58:39.060 --> 02:58:42.620]  into your experiences all of it and this is what it's about you don't know to
[02:58:42.620 --> 02:58:45.260]  hear in a meeting with a high-powered production head of a company that's
[02:58:45.260 --> 02:58:48.140]  worth a hundred million dollars they say look loose for loves you Alex
[02:58:48.140 --> 02:58:52.140]  brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it Rob do
[02:58:52.140 --> 02:58:57.380]  shines us you worked I guess like 20 plus hours tell us what brain force get

[02:59:01.100 --> 02:59:05.460]  in here at 830 I was kind of run down you know I just didn't feel like I was
[02:59:05.460 --> 02:59:08.740]  gonna make it and I really want to do a good job on the interview I got my
[02:59:08.740 --> 02:59:12.180]  bottle of brain force right there pop two of them and about 20 minutes later

[02:59:16.300 --> 02:59:20.020]  people really love it read about it find out why third-party
[02:59:20.020 --> 02:59:24.060]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the
[02:59:24.060 --> 02:59:28.380]  best organic based systems that will blow your socks off I haven't pulled an
[02:59:28.380 --> 02:59:31.140]  all-nighter like that in a while but I probably could not have done it without
[02:59:31.140 --> 02:59:35.900]  brain force I went home about 645 this morning took three hours of sleep got up
[02:59:35.900 --> 02:59:39.940]  took two more brain force and came in you will find a brain force and other

[02:59:48.620 --> 02:59:55.420]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:59:59.260 --> 03:00:07.340]  he's the t-rex of political talk yes sir Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[03:00:07.340 --> 03:00:10.180]  all right I'll give you the floor here for the last five minutes mark thank you
[03:00:10.180 --> 03:00:12.860]  for coming on great new book can't wait to finish read I'm only read about
[03:00:12.860 --> 03:00:19.220]  chapter so far just got a few days ago thank you know for those who want to
[03:00:19.220 --> 03:00:24.780]  learn about the CIA in Hollywood how the Illuminati went from what originally
[03:00:24.780 --> 03:00:32.060]  is a secret society of political and media mafia to this celebrity supposed
[03:00:32.060 --> 03:00:36.020]  secret society it's all in the book and you know there's a lot of material in
[03:00:36.020 --> 03:00:41.420]  there that has been I've never seen anybody cover in it's supposed to quote
[03:00:41.420 --> 03:00:45.700]  conspiracy community and so it encouraged people to check out the Sun
[03:00:45.700 --> 03:00:50.260]  Valley conference this is sort of like the Bilderberg group for major media it
[03:00:50.260 --> 03:00:54.020]  happens every July right after the Bilderberg group right before Bohemian
[03:00:54.020 --> 03:00:59.900]  Grove in the small town of Sun Valley Idaho where all the elite media folks and
[03:00:59.900 --> 03:01:04.660]  the tech companies the Facebooks the emerging social media Jack Dorsey the
[03:01:04.660 --> 03:01:11.500]  CEO of Twitter and the head of the CIA is always in attendance at Sun Valley the
[03:01:11.500 --> 03:01:16.420]  conference because this is where they coordinate their media agenda and co-op
[03:01:16.420 --> 03:01:21.420]  emerging companies and the plan is destroy our families yes and this is where
[03:01:21.420 --> 03:01:25.260]  they implement the social media or well in terms of service we're seeing a lot
[03:01:25.260 --> 03:01:30.020]  of censorship on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and regarding censoring
[03:01:30.020 --> 03:01:34.020]  conservatives and criticism of Hillary so this son there's a whole chapter in
[03:01:34.020 --> 03:01:38.180]  here about the Sun Valley conference and that's where the CIA and all the major
[03:01:38.180 --> 03:01:41.620]  media companies and all the major social media companies meet every year should
[03:01:41.620 --> 03:01:45.260]  be required reading for people taking RTF instead they literally teach you
[03:01:45.260 --> 03:01:49.900]  nothing and these college degrees are worthless mark what about the current
[03:01:49.900 --> 03:01:53.420]  climate what about Donald Trump what about all the things that are happening
[03:01:53.420 --> 03:01:58.460]  what is your real view of Trump I think that he's the real deal there's a lot
[03:01:58.460 --> 03:02:03.740]  that I don't support him on he's made some horrific statements he's appears to
[03:02:03.740 --> 03:02:08.660]  support the NDAA and he's he's made some some terrible statements but you know in
[03:02:08.660 --> 03:02:11.740]  any relationship there's a relationship between the public and their
[03:02:11.740 --> 03:02:16.220]  their candidates there's a compromise and so Trump I think sees the country going
[03:02:16.220 --> 03:02:20.980]  off a financial cliff he's angry that's I think part of his main appeal to people
[03:02:20.980 --> 03:02:24.260]  is that there's a nationalistic pro-american that's why they hate him
[03:02:24.260 --> 03:02:28.300]  they want a businessman in there who knows how to make money and follow rules
[03:02:28.300 --> 03:02:33.020]  and regulations they're tired of your typical politicians and Marco Rubio
[03:02:33.020 --> 03:02:37.640]  obviously the snake to replace Jeb who just didn't have it in him and they're
[03:02:37.640 --> 03:02:40.900]  doing everything they can to get him to go up there so that he'll his attempts
[03:02:40.900 --> 03:02:45.860]  to legalize and give citizenship to all the illegal aliens that's Marco Rubio's
[03:02:45.860 --> 03:02:51.020]  key point and his slogan is the new American Century project for the new
[03:02:51.020 --> 03:02:56.420]  American Century slogan this is the neocons tied in with the September 11th
[03:02:56.420 --> 03:03:01.260]  quote conspiracy or cover-up as well so he is obviously the establishment's
[03:03:01.260 --> 03:03:04.380]  mind and that's why everyone is going crazy about Trump and the
[03:03:04.380 --> 03:03:09.020]  establishment because they don't want an outsider to come up there and really
[03:03:09.020 --> 03:03:13.380]  do an audit in a sense of what's happening in DC I totally agree and
[03:03:13.380 --> 03:03:18.180]  there's no doubt they're scared to death of him there's no doubt that just the
[03:03:18.180 --> 03:03:20.860]  idea of actually having our country have a president that isn't bought and paid
[03:03:20.860 --> 03:03:26.300]  for what do you think they might do to try to stop them you know I really feel
[03:03:26.300 --> 03:03:29.100]  and I don't I don't say this lightly I mean I fear that there could there's
[03:03:29.100 --> 03:03:32.780]  assassination attempt in the in the works if they can't get him to stop but
[03:03:32.780 --> 03:03:36.860]  but I think that Hillary through the voter manipulation through all the
[03:03:36.860 --> 03:03:41.260]  different ways to manipulate the votes yeah they'll steal it that's more that's
[03:03:41.260 --> 03:03:46.500]  easier to deny than to kill to assassinate him would cause perhaps a
[03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:50.780]  civil war in this country so I think that they're gonna do everything that
[03:03:50.780 --> 03:03:54.900]  they can to manipulate you through electronic voting systems and other
[03:03:54.900 --> 03:04:00.740]  means to get Hillary in there she's the ultimate Illuminati servant she will put
[03:04:00.740 --> 03:04:05.140]  the final nail it was in the news back when she was co-president with Bill
[03:04:05.140 --> 03:04:09.620]  that she went every month to LA to do weird rituals with witches that was in
[03:04:09.620 --> 03:04:15.220]  the news she is a servant of Satan and that's not an allegory that is not
[03:04:15.220 --> 03:04:21.460]  hyperbolic speech she is the Illuminati's number one choice obviously she'll do
[03:04:21.460 --> 03:04:26.540]  anything and everything that they want her in the office would be a dream for
[03:04:26.540 --> 03:04:30.420]  the social justice warriors any criticism of her or the liberal agenda
[03:04:30.420 --> 03:04:36.100]  will be denounced as hateful will continue to see people being banned I'm
[03:04:36.100 --> 03:04:39.860]  actually gonna go and meet with my attorneys after this interview to arm
[03:04:39.860 --> 03:04:44.100]  up and launch a preemptive strike against YouTube to send them a message and
[03:04:44.100 --> 03:04:48.420]  Twitter that I will not be silenced that I my videos will not be removed for
[03:04:48.420 --> 03:04:52.380]  bogus terms of service that's right hey good job we're gonna talk to you again

[03:05:09.780 --> 03:05:14.980]  people's apologies but we also have to ask ourselves is this acceptable or

[03:11:08.420 --> 03:11:12.260]  power plants they're lying about Donald Trump gloves are off and we know yours are
[03:11:12.260 --> 03:11:21.580]  off so whatever fill your hand to quote John Wayne and Drew grit and the horse

[03:11:35.220 --> 03:11:40.300]  the fray into the battle across the snow through the woods to the Hessians we
[03:11:40.300 --> 03:11:46.300]  come and just Trump doing this is his focal point is so explosive you can
[03:11:46.300 --> 03:11:51.660]  feel the energy levels rising let's go to this clip of Romney flip-flopping like
[03:11:51.660 --> 03:11:57.660]  nothing I've ever seen a total 180 the true definition of a backstabbing lying
[03:11:57.660 --> 03:12:04.380]  piece of filth Donald Trump has shown an extraordinary ability to understand
[03:12:04.380 --> 03:12:08.940]  how our economy works to create jobs for the American people what little he has
[03:12:08.940 --> 03:12:13.780]  said is enough to know that he would be very bad for American workers and for
[03:12:13.780 --> 03:12:18.900]  American families he understands that our economy is facing threats from abroad
[03:12:18.900 --> 03:12:22.340]  he's one of the few people who stood up and said you know what China has been
[03:12:22.340 --> 03:12:26.860]  cheating they've they've taken jobs from Americans they haven't played fair we
[03:12:26.860 --> 03:12:31.820]  have to have a president who will stand up to cheaters his proposed 35% tariff
[03:12:31.820 --> 03:12:36.740]  like penalties would instigate a trade war and that would raise prices for
[03:12:36.740 --> 03:12:42.300]  consumers kill our export jobs and lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all
[03:12:42.300 --> 03:12:46.420]  stripes to flee America I spent my life in the private sector not quite as
[03:12:46.420 --> 03:12:51.260]  successful as this guy but successful nonetheless sufficiently successful to
[03:12:51.260 --> 03:12:55.340]  understand what it takes to get America to be the most attractive place in the
[03:12:55.340 --> 03:13:01.700]  world for innovators entrepreneurs and business and job creators he inherited
[03:13:01.700 --> 03:13:08.340]  his business he didn't create it a business genius he is not wow and
[03:13:08.340 --> 03:13:10.660]  there's so much more of that coming up at the bottom of the hour we have the
[03:13:10.660 --> 03:13:13.500]  Trump video it's a little bit longer than Anthony gives you already gonna be
[03:13:13.500 --> 03:13:16.540]  playing I want to get to a few of these clips though this and I mean let's face
[03:13:16.540 --> 03:13:19.180]  that these provincial speeches people love it because it's different it's
[03:13:19.180 --> 03:13:23.460]  working I'm told what Trump does in person just love to talk about business
[03:13:23.460 --> 03:13:27.940]  and pre roads and houses and architecture and you know I mean he's a
[03:13:27.940 --> 03:13:33.540]  pretty down-to-earth guy Romney Trump is not a huge business success we're gonna
[03:13:33.540 --> 03:13:40.220]  get to that and Trump's response Trump playing America's for suckers and then
[03:13:40.220 --> 03:13:45.780]  we have Trump responding Mitt Romney failed candidacy Romney failed candidate
[03:13:45.780 --> 03:13:50.140]  election can we find in there to where he talks about Hillary and how he brought
[03:13:50.140 --> 03:13:54.420]  up bill raping women that that but that's a gold piece that I mean if we
[03:13:54.420 --> 03:14:00.020]  didn't grab it it'll be on YouTube now so let's play the Trump clips first here
[03:14:00.020 --> 03:14:04.620]  this is really important we'll play the we'll play the first one a moment Mitt
[03:14:04.620 --> 03:14:09.140]  Romney failed candidate but let's go to Anthony Giardino who's hosting this
[03:14:09.140 --> 03:14:15.380]  show or Anthony I could not put words on how exciting and how dangerous the
[03:14:15.380 --> 03:14:18.820]  climate is right now and you don't just see it mirrored in politics for the
[03:14:18.820 --> 03:14:23.020]  economy and militarily and crazy governments bringing in jihadis as fast
[03:14:23.020 --> 03:14:26.140]  as they can thinking that when they attack us they'll take our rights that
[03:14:26.140 --> 03:14:31.460]  we're that dumb this political elite took the fact that we were asleep for so
[03:14:31.460 --> 03:14:35.180]  long as the fact that we were dead and I don't think they understand the sleeping
[03:14:35.180 --> 03:14:39.340]  giant isn't just awakening he's gone in splash some water on his face and is
[03:14:39.340 --> 03:14:44.700]  sitting on the commode right now and you know it's about to get up walk out the
[03:14:44.700 --> 03:14:48.140]  front door and beat the hell out of the New World Order I mean you know he's
[03:14:48.140 --> 03:14:53.060]  about to go drink a cup of coffee and the Giants up he's been asleep for a
[03:14:53.060 --> 03:14:56.300]  hundred years and I don't know what these little punks think they're gonna pull
[03:14:56.300 --> 03:15:01.340]  because everything they do they're out of the Midas touch well they've got the
[03:15:01.340 --> 03:15:05.540]  they've got the touch of death they got the touch of failure they're a pack of
[03:15:05.540 --> 03:15:09.700]  swarmy crooks absolutely good sharding you know just imagine the millions of
[03:15:09.700 --> 03:15:13.900]  people that have realized for so long they're not going with the establishment
[03:15:13.900 --> 03:15:17.500]  they don't like what's going on the polls with seven percent approval rating
[03:15:17.500 --> 03:15:21.660]  for Congress horrible approval rating for all the establishment all these
[03:15:21.660 --> 03:15:25.340]  millions of people right thinking they're in the minority for years thinking
[03:15:25.340 --> 03:15:29.220]  over and over again they can't actually show their true beliefs buying the con
[03:15:29.220 --> 03:15:33.620]  that they were alone yeah buying the media narrative that they're insane and
[03:15:33.620 --> 03:15:38.380]  no one believes them that they're in the minority and now watch as they can get
[03:15:38.380 --> 03:15:42.060]  behind something that's strong right watch is their ideology that's
[03:15:42.060 --> 03:15:45.940]  spreading like wildfire they can say oh my god wait people think like this too
[03:15:45.940 --> 03:15:49.780]  and they can tune into programs like this instead of the news which has in
[03:15:49.780 --> 03:15:54.460]  mainstream news which has no grasp now on the real scenario of the world and they
[03:15:54.460 --> 03:15:57.900]  can say wait a minute there's millions of people just like me that think like
[03:15:57.900 --> 03:16:01.820]  this and once that happens it's pretty much unstoppable it is like a new wave
[03:16:01.820 --> 03:16:06.300]  a new wave of people realizing their power and realizing everyone else
[03:16:06.300 --> 03:16:11.660]  things like that and the problem with the establishment now is that they are so
[03:16:11.660 --> 03:16:16.100]  ridiculous and so silly they think what Mitt Romney is going to save them they
[03:16:16.100 --> 03:16:21.180]  think I was about to say this this this ferret this this Ted Bundy you know
[03:16:21.180 --> 03:16:25.540]  John Wayne Gasey want to be he's got his head popping up with his face left the
[03:16:25.540 --> 03:16:30.220]  Barbie doll look and he's seeing everybody he's gonna give him the go he's
[03:16:30.220 --> 03:16:34.820]  kind of walking back in front shaking his butt like a prostitute a brothel you
[03:16:34.820 --> 03:16:37.620]  know in front of the Johns the Koch brothers and the Clintons and the New
[03:16:37.620 --> 03:16:41.860]  World Order no one hey baby I'm sexy I'm sexy to see what response there is
[03:16:41.860 --> 03:16:46.100]  that's why it's important to whack this little mole right back down into his
[03:16:46.100 --> 03:16:51.220]  filth nest look I think Mitt Romney is well spoken I think he's well groomed
[03:16:51.220 --> 03:16:54.700]  by the establishment I think you know he's obviously made tons of money
[03:16:54.700 --> 03:16:59.100]  probably is a billionaire but according to a lot of the research I've read is
[03:16:59.100 --> 03:17:02.500]  hiding a lot of his assets because he wants to be more relatable the big joke
[03:17:02.500 --> 03:17:06.540]  to me is they've got Trump right which regardless what you think about him
[03:17:06.540 --> 03:17:10.580]  again regardless way think about him is a likable relatable guy in the sense
[03:17:10.580 --> 03:17:13.700]  that he's sitting there talking about the problems that the American public
[03:17:13.700 --> 03:17:16.660]  pretty much all of them experience and then they're gonna put Romney in there
[03:17:16.660 --> 03:17:21.900]  who is the most unrelatable person in the world who is a complete bought and
[03:17:21.900 --> 03:17:25.940]  paid maybe he can run forever ever four years till he's 90 and then always take
[03:17:25.940 --> 03:17:29.940]  a fall you know like some of these fighters that Don King would get I mean
[03:17:29.940 --> 03:17:33.220]  the Republican Party isn't just killing itself and openly saying they're
[03:17:33.220 --> 03:17:36.100]  willing to kill themselves and get Hillary in they're willing to kill the
[03:17:36.100 --> 03:17:39.980]  whole political process like heavyweight boxing if they keep pushing and just
[03:17:39.980 --> 03:17:43.900]  rigging these elections I mean don't they get it we've seen Don King rig 10 or
[03:17:43.900 --> 03:17:48.620]  15 boxing matches that killed heavyweight boxing we've seen you guys
[03:17:48.620 --> 03:17:53.940]  rig a bunch of contests don't you get it you slack-jawed crooks but the best part
[03:17:53.940 --> 03:17:57.700]  is their narrative the whole time is though that Trump can't win you see
[03:17:57.700 --> 03:18:00.660]  they say well Trump can't win we need someone strong like Romney who's gonna
[03:18:00.660 --> 03:18:05.300]  win what we're a strong loser well mark yo Marco he could really beat Hillary
[03:18:05.300 --> 03:18:09.020]  what do you know he can fly though yeah it's everybody makes fun of him but you
[03:18:09.020 --> 03:18:13.740]  know but at the end of the movie Dumbo can fly Dumbo can fly it's Dumbo can
[03:18:13.740 --> 03:18:18.700]  also see how big people's hands are cuz Dumbo is obsessed with men's
[03:18:18.700 --> 03:18:23.940]  protuberances you know when it gets down to that I think it's a pretty pretty
[03:18:23.940 --> 03:18:28.060]  poor situation right and it also shows though they have no one the
[03:18:28.060 --> 03:18:31.220]  establishment if the best they can do is you know that pigs in Europe that
[03:18:31.220 --> 03:18:34.820]  actually find the truffles did you know they actually blindfold Rubio and they
[03:18:34.820 --> 03:18:38.620]  around the bathhouses and bathrooms at night he gets on all fours and runs
[03:18:38.620 --> 03:18:47.060]  around like a pig and he can smell out what he's looking for it's a good pause
[03:18:47.060 --> 03:18:53.260]  fun pause for effect right you know he never pause for effect that's on my
[03:18:53.260 --> 03:19:01.580]  tombstone oh hey how you doing bro your watch really beautiful

[03:24:26.500 --> 03:24:29.380]  saying he's terrible saying he's going to be a great president now he's the
[03:24:29.380 --> 03:24:31.540]  worst thing in the world so we've got a lot
[03:24:31.540 --> 03:24:35.140]  on that we've got including trump is he not a business success from romney
[03:24:35.140 --> 03:24:38.740]  trump coming back and firing back lots and lots
[03:24:38.740 --> 03:24:43.060]  to play in the next segment but first and foremost i wanted to talk
[03:24:43.060 --> 03:24:46.820]  about political correctness and word domination is something we've talked a
[03:24:46.820 --> 03:24:49.220]  lot about before we've talked about
[03:24:49.220 --> 03:24:53.300]  political correctness being a form of power and word domination
[03:24:53.300 --> 03:24:57.860]  specifically what it comes down to okay is this has been used
[03:24:57.860 --> 03:25:00.820]  since probably the beginning of time i mean it's been used for thousands of
[03:25:00.820 --> 03:25:04.100]  years an authority situation where you're not
[03:25:04.100 --> 03:25:07.060]  allowed to say certain things you're not allowed to
[03:25:07.060 --> 03:25:11.220]  offend certain people by your words or actions that may actually not even be so
[03:25:11.220 --> 03:25:14.660]  offensive and one thing that people don't realize and
[03:25:14.660 --> 03:25:18.020]  a lot of people aren't aware of this fact happened quite some time ago
[03:25:18.020 --> 03:25:22.420]  that do you know the mob actually used political correctness
[03:25:22.420 --> 03:25:26.180]  to have the department of justice stop using essentially ban
[03:25:26.180 --> 03:25:30.180]  the word mafia that's why it's not in the godfather if you watch the godfather
[03:25:30.180 --> 03:25:33.540]  they don't say the word mafia it all comes back
[03:25:33.540 --> 03:25:37.700]  to the italian-american civil rights league you know some people say i'm
[03:25:37.700 --> 03:25:41.460]  racist when i'm actually not racist i love everyone
[03:25:41.460 --> 03:25:45.940]  but when i talk about political correctness uh because you know i guess
[03:25:45.940 --> 03:25:49.220]  i'm white or whatever but guess what this is the italian-american civil rights
[03:25:49.220 --> 03:25:53.060]  league i am italian-american okay so i guess i have the
[03:25:53.060 --> 03:25:56.260]  authority to talk about it when in reality it's just an issue that we
[03:25:56.260 --> 03:26:02.260]  should discuss so let me bring you back in the 70s the italian-american civil
[03:26:02.260 --> 03:26:05.060]  rights league and i sent this all to you guys as well so we could pull up the
[03:26:05.060 --> 03:26:08.020]  pages was formed as a political group in and around
[03:26:08.020 --> 03:26:12.660]  new york city in the early 1970s its stated goal was to combat stereotypes
[03:26:12.660 --> 03:26:16.420]  about italian-americans but what really happened
[03:26:16.420 --> 03:26:22.100]  was joseph colombo who was the boss of the colombo crime family one of the five
[03:26:22.100 --> 03:26:26.500]  families of the cosinostra okay so a mob boss
[03:26:26.500 --> 03:26:32.180]  a mob boss created this because what really happened was he kept getting
[03:26:32.180 --> 03:26:35.860]  arrested so the group began as an italian-american anti-defamation
[03:26:35.860 --> 03:26:40.340]  league on april 30th 1970 when approximately 30 italian-americans
[03:26:40.340 --> 03:26:45.860]  led by mobster joseph colombo picketed the manhattan headquarters of the fbi
[03:26:45.860 --> 03:26:49.700]  they were there to protest the recent arrest oh recent arrest
[03:26:49.700 --> 03:26:54.020]  of colombo's son joseph colombo on a charge of conspiracy to melt down
[03:26:54.020 --> 03:27:00.340]  old us silver coins okay so the senior colombo had complained of unfair
[03:27:00.340 --> 03:27:03.620]  harassment of him and his family by the law enforcement authorities
[03:27:03.620 --> 03:27:08.980]  because because he's a mob boss but you know he wasn't saying well i'm a mob
[03:27:08.980 --> 03:27:12.260]  boss he was saying this is racist this is not
[03:27:12.260 --> 03:27:16.020]  politically correct ban the word mafia and it sounds totally
[03:27:16.020 --> 03:27:19.860]  insane now but guess what happened they banned the word mafia the
[03:27:19.860 --> 03:27:24.180]  department of justice stopped using it even the godfather
[03:27:24.180 --> 03:27:27.540]  stopped using the word mafia in the film script it goes on
[03:27:27.540 --> 03:27:31.780]  within two months organization claimed 45 000 dues paying members
[03:27:31.780 --> 03:27:35.220]  and held a large rally in columbus circle on 20 of the june 28th
[03:27:35.220 --> 03:27:40.260]  1970 the league gained further momentum when frank frank sinatra held a benefit
[03:27:40.260 --> 03:27:45.860]  concert in its honor so what's going on here obviously is we've got a mob boss
[03:27:45.860 --> 03:27:49.700]  family okay that's saying we're being treated unfairly as italian americans
[03:27:49.700 --> 03:27:52.980]  this is racist we need to use political correctness
[03:27:52.980 --> 03:27:57.380]  and domination to stop people from saying anything that's remotely offensive
[03:27:57.380 --> 03:28:02.100]  so you know what they did they worked with alrady the producer of the godfather
[03:28:02.100 --> 03:28:07.940]  to omit the terms mafia and cosinostra okay and they got rid of the godfather
[03:28:07.940 --> 03:28:13.860]  board game they demanded macy stop selling a board game called the godfather game
[03:28:13.860 --> 03:28:18.180]  and they had television commercials they worked with alka seltzer and ford
[03:28:18.180 --> 03:28:20.820]  motor company to withdraw their television commercials because they
[03:28:20.820 --> 03:28:24.180]  felt it was offensive and they got united states attorney general john
[03:28:24.180 --> 03:28:27.700]  mitchell to order the united states justice department to stop using the
[03:28:27.700 --> 03:28:32.500]  word mafia you know let that sit for a second
[03:28:32.500 --> 03:28:37.220]  the mafia got the justice department to stop using the word mafia
[03:28:37.220 --> 03:28:41.300]  because it offended italian people when they were the mob
[03:28:41.300 --> 03:28:46.420]  killing people and selling drugs that's the power of political correctness
[03:28:46.420 --> 03:28:49.380]  right there and sure it's been used for thousands of years in different ways we
[03:28:49.380 --> 03:28:53.300]  could get into the soviet era all that blah blah blah but guess what
[03:28:53.300 --> 03:28:58.340]  political correctness is a war a method of word domination over you
[03:28:58.340 --> 03:29:03.140]  and when i don't like something you're saying i can invoke political correctness
[03:29:03.140 --> 03:29:08.500]  to attack you using the full power of the establishment system on my side to
[03:29:08.500 --> 03:29:12.180]  silence your argument just like they did with the italian
[03:29:12.180 --> 03:29:14.660]  american civil rights league which by the way had some basis
[03:29:14.660 --> 03:29:18.020]  right just like all these movements have some basis there are really actually
[03:29:18.020 --> 03:29:21.780]  racist mean people out there but the italian defense league run
[03:29:21.780 --> 03:29:26.820]  by a mobster ban the word mafia and because he was getting arrested for
[03:29:26.820 --> 03:29:30.660]  scamming people and making money that's racist
[03:29:30.660 --> 03:29:34.180]  some thought for you there we'll be back we're going to play a bunch of clips

[03:33:51.940 --> 03:33:54.820]  questions and i'll try to get to them and your thoughts on this
[03:33:54.820 --> 03:33:58.340]  so a little background romney comes out
[03:33:58.340 --> 03:34:02.100]  i don't know quite some time ago and talks about how great trump is he's in
[03:34:02.100 --> 03:34:06.020]  los vegas with him and says he's a great business success
[03:34:06.020 --> 03:34:11.060]  speaks very very highly of him now romney is coming out saying the exact
[03:34:11.060 --> 03:34:14.420]  opposite and there's a lot of craziness going on let's go
[03:34:14.420 --> 03:34:16.660]  ahead and jump into these video clips starting with
[03:34:16.660 --> 03:34:20.900]  romney saying that trump is now not a huge business success
[03:34:20.900 --> 03:34:26.260]  if we make improvident choices the bright horizon i've described
[03:34:26.260 --> 03:34:30.260]  will not materialize and let me put it very plainly
[03:34:30.260 --> 03:34:33.860]  if we republicans choose donald trump as our nominee
[03:34:33.860 --> 03:34:37.220]  the prospects for a safe and prosperous future
[03:34:37.220 --> 03:34:42.100]  are greatly diminished if donald trump's plans were ever implemented
[03:34:42.100 --> 03:34:45.940]  the country would sink into prolonged recession
[03:34:45.940 --> 03:34:51.460]  a few examples his proposed 35 percent tariff-like penalties
[03:34:51.460 --> 03:34:56.340]  would instigate a trade war and that would raise prices for consumers
[03:34:56.340 --> 03:35:00.740]  kill our export jobs and lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all
[03:35:00.740 --> 03:35:06.180]  stripes to flee america his tax plan in combination with his
[03:35:06.180 --> 03:35:11.380]  refusal to reform entitlements and to honestly address spending
[03:35:11.380 --> 03:35:16.420]  would balloon the deficit and the national debt so even though donald
[03:35:16.420 --> 03:35:19.620]  trump has offered very few specific economic plans
[03:35:19.620 --> 03:35:23.460]  what little he has said is enough to know that he would be very bad for
[03:35:23.460 --> 03:35:26.660]  american workers and for american families
[03:35:26.660 --> 03:35:30.980]  but you say wait wait wait is it he a huge business success
[03:35:30.980 --> 03:35:34.980]  doesn't he know what he's talking about no he isn't
[03:35:34.980 --> 03:35:45.380]  and no he doesn't
[03:35:45.380 --> 03:35:50.420]  look his his bankruptcies have crushed small businesses
[03:35:50.420 --> 03:35:54.260]  and the men and women who work for them he inherited his business he didn't
[03:35:54.260 --> 03:35:58.100]  create it and whatever happened to trump airlines
[03:35:58.100 --> 03:36:02.020]  how about trump university and then there's trump magazine
[03:36:02.020 --> 03:36:06.980]  and trump vodka and trump steaks and trump mortgage
[03:36:06.980 --> 03:36:12.820]  a business genius he is not well there you go that's mit romney
[03:36:12.820 --> 03:36:17.380]  he is quite well spoken interesting on his delivery he obviously has quite an
[03:36:17.380 --> 03:36:20.020]  agenda there romney let's play this one next
[03:36:20.020 --> 03:36:26.260]  trump is playing americans for suckers mr trump is directing our anger
[03:36:26.260 --> 03:36:31.060]  for less than noble purposes he creates scapegoats and muslims
[03:36:31.060 --> 03:36:35.460]  and mexican immigrants he calls for the use of torture
[03:36:35.460 --> 03:36:40.900]  he calls for killing the innocent children and family members of terrorists
[03:36:40.900 --> 03:36:46.020]  he cheers assaults on protesters he applauds the prospect of twisting the
[03:36:46.020 --> 03:36:50.500]  constitution to limit first amendment freedom of the press
[03:36:50.500 --> 03:36:57.300]  this is the very brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyss
[03:36:57.300 --> 03:37:02.100]  here's what i know donald trump is a phony a fraud
[03:37:02.100 --> 03:37:19.780]  his promises are as worthless as a degree from trump university
[03:37:19.780 --> 03:37:23.460]  he's playing the members of the american public for suckers he gets a free ride
[03:37:23.460 --> 03:37:28.740]  to the white house and all we get is a lousy hat
[03:37:28.740 --> 03:37:32.500]  his domestic policies would lead to recession
[03:37:32.500 --> 03:37:36.340]  his foreign policies would make america and the world less safe
[03:37:36.340 --> 03:37:39.620]  he has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president
[03:37:39.620 --> 03:37:43.860]  and his personal qualities would mean that america would cease to be a
[03:37:43.860 --> 03:37:50.740]  shining city on a hill i'm convinced america has greatness ahead
[03:37:50.740 --> 03:37:55.540]  and this is a time for choosing god bless us to choose a nominee
[03:37:55.540 --> 03:38:00.260]  who will make that vision a reality thank you and god bless you all
[03:38:00.260 --> 03:38:03.620]  thank you all right there he is again and we have one more from romney he says
[03:38:03.620 --> 03:38:07.700]  dishonesty is trump's hallmark let's go to that one
[03:38:07.700 --> 03:38:11.700]  tells us that he is very very smart
[03:38:11.700 --> 03:38:29.380]  i'm afraid that when it comes to foreign policy he is very very not smart
[03:38:29.380 --> 03:38:32.820]  now i'm far from the first to conclude that donald trump lacks the temperament
[03:38:32.820 --> 03:38:36.580]  to be president after all this is an individual who mocked a
[03:38:36.580 --> 03:38:40.500]  disabled reporter who attributed a reporter's questions to her
[03:38:40.500 --> 03:38:45.380]  menstrual cycle who mocked a brilliant rival who happened to be a woman
[03:38:45.380 --> 03:38:49.860]  due to her appearance who bragged about his marital affairs
[03:38:49.860 --> 03:38:54.100]  and who laces his public speeches with vulgarity
[03:38:54.100 --> 03:38:58.660]  donald trump says he admires vladimir putin at the same time he's called
[03:38:58.660 --> 03:39:15.620]  george w bush allier that is a twisted example of evil trumping good
[03:39:15.620 --> 03:39:19.780]  there's a dark irony in his boasts of his sexual exploits
[03:39:19.780 --> 03:39:23.460]  during the vietnam war while at the same time
[03:39:23.460 --> 03:39:29.700]  john mccain whom he has mocked was imprisoned and tortured
[03:39:29.700 --> 03:39:34.900]  dishonesty is donald trump's hallmark he claimed that he had spoken clearly and
[03:39:34.900 --> 03:39:42.260]  boldly against going into iraq wrong he spoke in favor of invading iraq
[03:39:42.260 --> 03:39:47.300]  he said he saw thousands of muslims in new jersey celebrating 911
[03:39:47.300 --> 03:39:52.340]  wrong he saw no such thing he imagined it
[03:39:52.340 --> 03:39:56.660]  he's not of the temperament of the kind of stable thoughtful person we need his
[03:39:56.660 --> 03:40:01.060]  leader his imagination must not be married to real
[03:40:01.060 --> 03:40:07.940]  power torture of you both lying oh my gosh could you imagine
[03:40:07.940 --> 03:40:12.020]  like we're about to play a video titled trump destroys romney we've got three
[03:40:12.020 --> 03:40:14.580]  other ones that are really really important to show
[03:40:14.580 --> 03:40:17.700]  but first and foremost i want to remind you to go to info wars life

[03:40:33.460 --> 03:40:37.540]  three times more powerful than most of those 10 part per million colloidal

[03:40:42.740 --> 03:40:46.100]  strongest we can go due to some of the regulations okay
[03:40:46.100 --> 03:40:49.540]  it's safe it's the strongest we can go
[03:40:49.540 --> 03:40:55.540]  three times stronger it's 50 off not 20 not 30 50 percent off it's

[03:41:30.420 --> 03:41:33.860]  com now i want to play for you this video entitled
[03:41:33.860 --> 03:41:36.980]  trump destroys romney because you've heard a lot from romney about how
[03:41:36.980 --> 03:41:39.940]  terrible trump is let's see what trump has to say
[03:41:39.940 --> 03:41:43.220]  an amnesty program is what which is all the illegal immigrants who are here
[03:41:43.220 --> 03:41:48.020]  are now citizens and and walk up and get your citizenship
[03:41:48.020 --> 03:41:51.380]  registering to become a citizen or applying to become a citizen and paying
[03:41:51.380 --> 03:41:55.860]  a fee and and those are things that are being being considered and i i think
[03:41:55.860 --> 03:41:59.300]  that those are reasonable proposals
[03:42:02.020 --> 03:42:06.500]  i want universal coverage i want everyone in massachusetts and this country to
[03:42:06.500 --> 03:42:09.140]  have insurance well that's what we did in massachusetts
[03:42:09.140 --> 03:42:13.300]  and that is we put together an exchange and the president's copying that idea
[03:42:13.300 --> 03:42:18.420]  i'm glad to hear that mit on abortion
[03:42:18.420 --> 03:42:22.420]  i will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose
[03:42:22.420 --> 03:42:25.300]  mit on bailouts just reading the text for you here
[03:42:25.300 --> 03:42:29.460]  i have never supported the president's recovery act all right the stimulus
[03:42:29.460 --> 03:42:34.260]  no time nowhere no how i think there is need for economic stimulus
[03:42:34.260 --> 03:42:37.620]  tarp got paid back and it kept the financial system from collapsing
[03:42:37.620 --> 03:42:42.740]  so you feel was well worth it well it was the right thing to do
[03:42:42.740 --> 03:42:47.540]  mit on global warming but i believe the world is getting warmer
[03:42:47.540 --> 03:42:51.620]  humans contributed to that so that's style jump
[03:42:51.620 --> 03:42:54.500]  trump's response to that we've also got some trump clips where he actually
[03:42:54.500 --> 03:42:58.740]  speaks in response to these things so let's go to trump on stating mit romney
[03:42:58.740 --> 03:43:01.940]  is a failed candidate
[03:43:01.940 --> 03:43:07.220]  and cue that up for a second here and as we talked about this is trump's actual
[03:43:07.220 --> 03:43:10.660]  response and that was a video he had made called
[03:43:10.660 --> 03:43:14.580]  trump destroys romney this is his actual response to romney saying he is a
[03:43:14.580 --> 03:43:18.340]  failed candidate that mit romney made a fairly long
[03:43:18.340 --> 03:43:23.460]  speech and i mean honestly i thought i'll just
[03:43:23.460 --> 03:43:26.740]  address it quickly because it's irrelevant look
[03:43:26.740 --> 03:43:32.260]  mit is a failed candidate he failed he failed horribly
[03:43:32.260 --> 03:43:40.180]  the third he failed badly that was a race i have to say
[03:43:40.180 --> 03:43:43.700]  folks that should have been one that was a race that
[03:43:43.700 --> 03:43:47.380]  absolutely should have been one and i don't know what happened to him
[03:43:47.380 --> 03:43:51.380]  he disappeared he disappeared and i wasn't happy about it i'll be honest
[03:43:51.380 --> 03:43:56.260]  because i am not a fan of barack obama and that was a race that i backed mit
[03:43:56.260 --> 03:43:59.780]  romney i backed him you can see how loyal he is
[03:43:59.780 --> 03:44:03.460]  he was begging for my endorsement i could have said mit
[03:44:03.460 --> 03:44:06.340]  dropped your knees he would have dropped to his knees
[03:44:06.340 --> 03:44:09.460]  he was begging
[03:44:11.060 --> 03:44:15.780]  he was begging me and did you see how great he said oh i'm not big like him
[03:44:15.780 --> 03:44:19.700]  he's the great businessman all that stuff well since then i've done much
[03:44:19.700 --> 03:44:22.500]  better and now he tries to do me but we'll talk
[03:44:22.500 --> 03:44:26.420]  about that in a second but mit was thinking about running again
[03:44:26.420 --> 03:44:30.340]  he ran a horrible campaign it was a campaign that should have never been
[03:44:30.340 --> 03:44:32.900]  lost you're running against a failed president
[03:44:32.900 --> 03:44:36.340]  he came up with the 47 percent he demeaned
[03:44:36.340 --> 03:44:40.100]  47 percent of the people in our country right the
[03:44:40.100 --> 03:44:44.660]  the famous 47 percent once that was said i'll be honest
[03:44:44.660 --> 03:44:48.660]  once that was said a lot of people thought it was over for him
[03:44:48.660 --> 03:44:52.580]  then the last month and a half he disappeared and i called his people i
[03:44:52.580 --> 03:44:56.820]  said you have to do yourself a favor obama say what you want he was on jay
[03:44:56.820 --> 03:45:00.100]  leno he was on david letterman he was all over the place the last three four
[03:45:00.100 --> 03:45:03.540]  weeks mit was looking for zoning for a nine car garage or
[03:45:03.540 --> 03:45:07.220]  something in california right i said what's he doing who cares
[03:45:07.220 --> 03:45:11.540]  about a garage you're running for president and mit was a disaster as a
[03:45:11.540 --> 03:45:15.620]  candidate so what happened and it was very strong and i think if the press goes
[03:45:15.620 --> 03:45:19.060]  back they'll see it when i heard he was running again
[03:45:19.060 --> 03:45:23.460]  and i wasn't sure i was going to be running but i was very very strong
[03:45:23.460 --> 03:45:26.660]  to mit and to everybody and publicly not to talk to him because i didn't even
[03:45:26.660 --> 03:45:29.380]  want to talk to him i was so disappointed in him
[03:45:29.380 --> 03:45:34.180]  because he let us down he let us down you know it's one thing you lose and you
[03:45:34.180 --> 03:45:39.060]  work and you work and you go he let us down he should have won
[03:45:39.060 --> 03:45:43.380]  something happened to him he went away he was gone he was horrible in the third
[03:45:43.380 --> 03:45:46.740]  debate it was it was a horrible something happened
[03:45:46.740 --> 03:45:50.260]  i don't know what maybe someday they'll write a book his campaign
[03:45:50.260 --> 03:45:53.860]  guy was terrible terrible he had a terrible campaign manager who's always
[03:45:53.860 --> 03:45:57.380]  on television stewart stevens or something he's always on television
[03:45:57.380 --> 03:46:01.220]  knocking everybody the guy ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of
[03:46:01.220 --> 03:46:06.500]  modern politics and mit ran probably it was the worst
[03:46:06.500 --> 03:46:09.780]  run that most people have seen because most people thought
[03:46:09.780 --> 03:46:13.620]  that the republican candidate would win so when mit in his head
[03:46:13.620 --> 03:46:17.300]  i was very strong i said me he's a cherry strongly
[03:46:17.300 --> 03:46:25.060]  keep him in actually convinced mit not to run can you imagine jeb jeb sold him
[03:46:25.060 --> 03:46:28.580]  jeb he's a good salesman see now that he's out i'll say jeb's a good salesman
[03:46:28.580 --> 03:46:32.500]  right he's a high energy salesman
[03:46:32.580 --> 03:46:36.900]  but mit was afraid of jeb because he was afraid that jeb would get the money
[03:46:36.900 --> 03:46:41.780]  and jeb would get whatever and you know i wasn't i wasn't afraid i wasn't afraid
[03:46:41.780 --> 03:46:45.460]  of jeb i can tell you that so what happened is jeb bush convinced mit
[03:46:45.460 --> 03:46:48.900]  not to run mit was going to run it was going to be a third attempt
[03:46:48.900 --> 03:46:52.260]  the second one being one of the great catastrophes the first one just didn't
[03:46:52.260 --> 03:46:55.780]  happen so that's okay but the second was a catastrophe
[03:46:55.780 --> 03:46:59.460]  and what happened is he went to see jeb and jeb had him convinced that he's
[03:46:59.460 --> 03:47:02.580]  going to run he's got the money he's this and mit chickened out
[03:47:02.580 --> 03:47:06.340]  but i'll tell you the real reason he chickened out it wasn't jeb it was me
[03:47:06.340 --> 03:47:10.660]  because i said he's a joke if you remember mit was all set to run i know
[03:47:10.660 --> 03:47:13.940]  this from people that are close to him and i think he probably still has a
[03:47:13.940 --> 03:47:17.780]  desire maybe at the convention to try and get some kind of a thing
[03:47:17.780 --> 03:47:22.980]  hillary clinton will destroy him in the election assuming she's allowed to run
[03:47:22.980 --> 03:47:28.820]  assuming she's not arrested for the email situation
[03:47:28.820 --> 03:47:34.820]  which is so terrible which is so terrible i mean so terrible but let's
[03:47:34.820 --> 03:47:38.020]  assume that the democrats are going to protect her
[03:47:38.020 --> 03:47:42.580]  let's assume that i will be running against hillary and i really want to i
[03:47:42.580 --> 03:47:47.060]  would love to run against hillary
[03:47:47.060 --> 03:47:50.180]  and by the way we have numerous polls that show me beating her easily and i
[03:47:50.180 --> 03:47:54.580]  haven't even started on her yet other than four weeks ago i did remember
[03:47:54.580 --> 03:47:58.580]  she called me sexist and i hit her with the husband
[03:47:58.580 --> 03:48:01.940]  and that was the last time i ever heard the word well there's donald trump's
[03:48:01.940 --> 03:48:06.100]  response to everything mit romney is saying in some talk on hillary clinton
[03:48:06.100 --> 03:48:09.940]  look here's my number one point on this entire election cycle
[03:48:09.940 --> 03:48:14.100]  on the outcome of a lot of this is that regardless of what you think about
[03:48:14.100 --> 03:48:18.020]  everything that donald trump believes you know what the main point here is
[03:48:18.020 --> 03:48:22.100]  the main point is that the establishment mainstream media
[03:48:22.100 --> 03:48:25.540]  that backed jeb bush and again who cares what you think about these people the
[03:48:25.540 --> 03:48:28.340]  point is they backed jeb bush they backed marco rubio
[03:48:28.340 --> 03:48:32.340]  they kind of backed headcruise a little bit all they did though was attack
[03:48:32.340 --> 03:48:35.620]  donald trump over and over and over and over and over and over and now they
[03:48:35.620 --> 03:48:39.380]  have mit romney attacking them for him but you know what happened
[03:48:39.380 --> 03:48:44.260]  they didn't succeed donald trump won donald trump is continuing to win
[03:48:44.260 --> 03:48:47.300]  again regardless of what you even think you know what the main thing is the
[03:48:47.300 --> 03:48:51.700]  mainstream media narrative is gone they no longer have the control and it
[03:48:51.700 --> 03:48:54.980]  reminds me of this amazing conan clip if we still have time to play it where he
[03:48:54.980 --> 03:48:57.940]  highlights just how ridiculous the mainstream media is and this is why you
[03:48:57.940 --> 03:49:01.140]  hear people repeating the things they hear on the mainstream media like parents
[03:49:01.140 --> 03:49:04.180]  let's go ahead and play that clip a lot of people think the big news stories
[03:49:04.180 --> 03:49:08.100]  today are the snowstorm that's hitting the midwest or the looming federal budget
[03:49:08.100 --> 03:49:11.860]  cuts but judging by local news there's
[03:49:11.860 --> 03:49:15.700]  apparently an even bigger story that's sweeping the nation right now check it
[03:49:15.700 --> 03:49:18.340]  out well if you filled up your gas tank
[03:49:18.340 --> 03:49:21.780]  lately then you don't need us to tell you that gas prices are back on the rise
[03:49:21.780 --> 03:49:25.540]  you don't need us to tell you that gas prices are back on the rise you don't
[03:49:25.540 --> 03:49:28.740]  need us to tell you that gas prices are back on the rise this is all
[03:49:28.740 --> 03:49:53.300]  different stations saying the same thing
[03:49:53.300 --> 03:50:02.060]  But consider that right they say the same scripted thing over and over again through the different networks owned by different companies
[03:50:02.240 --> 03:50:07.520]  You know a small number of companies own them all sure but owned by different companies the same thing over and over again
[03:50:07.520 --> 03:50:10.420]  But that's just a silly gas price thing from a while ago, right?
[03:50:10.460 --> 03:50:13.540]  But what if they're all saying the same narrative on things that matter?
[03:50:14.060 --> 03:50:18.480]  What if they're all telling you how to think in unison throughout the different networks on
[03:50:18.480 --> 03:50:25.160]  Things that matter well they are and they're saying it over and over again, and that's why I wish we had some more time
[03:50:25.160 --> 03:50:28.160]  Actually to talk about the people that actually believe it
[03:50:28.160 --> 03:50:33.440]  I talked to one of these people the other day and it's been in short supplies since no one believes the media anymore
[03:50:33.440 --> 03:50:38.120]  We'll talk about that a little bit more when we come back, and also we've got some more clips on
[03:50:38.120 --> 03:50:44.740]  I'm Trump's response to Romney and much more stay tuned to Manthony Guciardi. This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show

[03:53:57.280 --> 03:54:10.280]  All right, we're back to the fourth hour we got to act quick because time is running out
[03:54:10.280 --> 03:54:16.280]  We've got a bit more from Trump in response to Romney on what he calls his failed candidacy. Let's hear it
[03:54:16.280 --> 03:54:20.280]  Company which by the way I still have I supply all my clubs with the water
[03:54:20.280 --> 03:54:23.280]  You know numerous of those things I have the magazine other things
[03:54:23.280 --> 03:54:28.280]  Get him get him out of here get him out
[03:54:28.280 --> 03:54:37.280]  Get him out hey by the way speaking of Mexico I won the Hispanic vote by far in Nevada
[03:54:37.280 --> 03:54:48.280]  We won the Hispanic vote in Nevada in the polls during the we won Nevada we won South Carolina we won New Hampshire
[03:54:48.280 --> 03:54:52.280]  Then we had the big big Tuesday where we won a tremendous number
[03:54:52.280 --> 03:54:57.280]  And I have to tell you this so ultimately mid chickened out
[03:54:57.280 --> 03:55:03.280]  And now he's saying probably sees the Hillary's very weak and now he said oh I wish I went I wish I tried it
[03:55:03.280 --> 03:55:07.280]  But ultimately he didn't because he would have gotten he would have gotten beaten very badly
[03:55:07.280 --> 03:55:12.280]  But I'll tell you what a couple of things were mentioned that we have to discuss
[03:55:12.280 --> 03:55:17.280]  First of all when he talks about me I wrote just a couple of them down when he talks about me they don't want to talk about
[03:55:17.280 --> 03:55:24.280]  92 story buildings all over the place they don't want to talk about the Bank of America building in San Francisco
[03:55:24.280 --> 03:55:31.280]  1290 Avenue of the Americas they don't want to talk about the west side railroad yards where I built the city on the west side of Manhattan
[03:55:31.280 --> 03:55:37.280]  A tremendous city on the west side of Manhattan they don't want to talk about 40 Wall Street and all the buildings
[03:55:37.280 --> 03:55:43.280]  They want to talk about water which I still have I supply all my clubs have a water company
[03:55:43.280 --> 03:55:49.280]  They want to talk about a magazine and I have a magazine it goes to all my clubs they do a little tiny thing you know wherever you can find
[03:55:49.280 --> 03:55:57.280]  By the way a school little deal but very you know I loved it and when it was there they call it Trump University Trump initiative
[03:55:57.280 --> 03:56:03.280]  But I will tell you just so you understand on the school the school had 98% approval rating
[03:56:03.280 --> 03:56:09.280]  But you had an attorney that felt oh maybe I can sue Trump and get something the school had a 98%
[03:56:09.280 --> 03:56:15.280]  In other words 98% of the people that took the courses we signed report cards that's why you can't settle a case like that
[03:56:15.280 --> 03:56:21.280]  You put somebody up in the stand did you write this the most beautiful thing they did a commercial they took it down
[03:56:21.280 --> 03:56:27.280]  Where two people were going and saying negative and then we showed them the statement that they wrote they had to take the commercial down
[03:56:27.280 --> 03:56:34.280]  Because 98% of the people that took the course that took the courses said really wonderful things about it
[03:56:34.280 --> 03:56:41.280]  The other thing's got an A an A from the Better Business Bureau so I say how do I settle a case like this
[03:56:41.280 --> 03:56:52.280]  A B plus would be okay too B plus would be okay but we did better than a B plus so so I can't and here's one thing I say about business
[03:56:52.280 --> 03:57:00.280]  I watch these bankers and they get millions of dollars a year 40 50 million dollars frankly it's ridiculous and then they'll settle with the government
[03:57:00.280 --> 03:57:07.280]  If they're sued by the government for 2 billion 3 billion 5 billion 12 billion and I say to them why don't you fight it
[03:57:07.280 --> 03:57:14.280]  They said well it's the government we don't want to fight well I say you got to fight it because if you don't fight it everyone's going to sue you
[03:57:14.280 --> 03:57:20.280]  And that's what happens you ever see it they settle for 2 billion the next week they get sued again you got to fight these things out
[03:57:20.280 --> 03:57:27.280]  You have to do things you have to do what's right so with university I know I could get some bad publicity but I have to I have to do what's right
[03:57:27.280 --> 03:57:35.280]  Do we agree with that by the way so it's a very small case it's a civil case it's not a big deal and I'm going to win it in court
[03:57:35.280 --> 03:57:40.280]  And it'll cost me more money to win it in court than I could settle for in my opinion but I'm going to win it in court
[03:57:40.280 --> 03:57:46.280]  And I said oh this is lousy timing because it's too bad it wasn't a little bit later because I happened to be running for president
[03:57:46.280 --> 03:57:54.280]  But I have other suits too any businessman or business woman has lawsuits people sue to get their money back they sue for this they sue for that
[03:57:54.280 --> 03:58:01.280]  They sue for a million different reasons so just so you understand 98% approval rating and a from the better business bureau we're going to win the case
[03:58:01.280 --> 03:58:09.280]  Mark it down we're going to win the case it'll be forever because it takes forever but that's the way it is I don't like to settle cases I don't like to do it
[03:58:09.280 --> 03:58:19.280]  Because once you settle cases what happens is everybody says he's a settler let's sue that's not me a lot of people don't sue me because they say it's too hard
[03:58:19.280 --> 03:58:28.280]  So there it is there's Trump's response and we got to wrap it up there's no time left in the show Alex will be back tomorrow from 11am to 2pm
[03:58:28.280 --> 03:58:37.280]  Slash 3pm Central with Overdrive check out the rest of the stories in FullWars.com CPS to prosecute trolls who use fake online profiles in Britain
[03:58:37.280 --> 03:58:50.280]  A lot more a lot of crazy news out there I'm Anthony Gutiarty thanks so much for listening
