[02:50.880 --> 02:56.000]  up to the island of Lesbos one German town of a thousand now has two thousand
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.480]  illegals in it in one week and it's only intensifying you'll wake up and there's
[03:01.480 --> 03:06.840]  two thousand people in your tiny town and they want everything free and they're

[03:26.280 --> 03:31.600]  borders then says well we bombed Africa in the Middle East and so it's our fault
[03:31.600 --> 03:36.720]  we got to take them you did those wars were unpopular they were a fraud we're
[03:36.720 --> 03:42.800]  captured and Obama's opened our borders up to refugees as well this is a
[03:42.800 --> 03:48.480]  planetary takedown and the Pope says we haven't accepted enough illegals and
[03:48.480 --> 03:53.360]  paid for everything and that we should repent and say our prayers to the papa
[03:53.360 --> 04:01.520]  pray to the papa the papa says pray kisses ring and he will forgive you
[04:01.520 --> 04:06.040]  Jesus will forgive you he has the keys to both temporal power and spiritual power
[04:06.040 --> 04:10.920]  and he says you'll be okay a pope did you pray and ask for givens that you
[04:10.920 --> 04:15.640]  didn't take the hundreds of thousands of African migrants pouring in every six
[04:15.640 --> 04:18.840]  months or so into Italy they're all over the streets of Rome and all over the
[04:18.840 --> 04:22.800]  streets of Naples and just running around mugging people and sleeping under
[04:22.800 --> 04:28.120]  trees and begging everywhere did you take them inside your big 30-foot walls
[04:28.120 --> 04:33.240]  with the armed guards with submachine guns did you take them no you didn't
[04:33.240 --> 04:38.920]  papa what a sick new-world-order puppet you say what you want about the
[04:38.920 --> 04:42.200]  Catholic Church it's fruits of varying throughout history but let me tell you
[04:42.200 --> 04:47.120]  this pope is no pope at all this is like having Fidel Castro at the Vatican
[04:47.120 --> 04:54.160]  first Fidel Castro doesn't take refugees from anywhere in Latin America they
[04:54.160 --> 04:59.320]  shoot you if you do but that's okay he's got a big beard he's a communist here's
[04:59.320 --> 05:02.920]  a story for all you supporters of the war on drugs cocaine production plummets
[05:02.920 --> 05:07.400]  after DEA kicked out of Bolivia from the website theantimedia.org according to
[05:07.400 --> 05:10.480]  data released by the United Nations cocaine production in that country
[05:10.480 --> 05:14.200]  declined by 11% in the past year making the fourth year in a row of steady
[05:14.200 --> 05:17.920]  decrease it was just seven years ago that the DEA was kicked out of Bolivia and
[05:17.920 --> 05:21.600]  only three years after that progress was finally made the strategy employed by
[05:21.600 --> 05:25.040]  the Bolivian government may surprise many prohibitionists because it did not
[05:25.040 --> 05:28.880]  involve strong armed police state tactics instead they work to find
[05:28.880 --> 05:32.080]  alternative crops for farmers to grow that would actually make them more
[05:32.080 --> 05:36.080]  money Bolivia has adopted a policy where coca cultivation is allowed in
[05:36.080 --> 05:40.000]  traditional areas alongside alternative development and others said Antonio
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.600]  de Leo from the UN office of drugs and crime the US is still involved in
[05:43.600 --> 05:46.600]  Afghanistan and look at the heroin production coming out of that area it
[05:46.600 --> 05:50.400]  has skyrocketed is the United States really against the war on drugs or is
[05:50.400 --> 05:53.880]  it just against the people who use them rob do reporting for info wars dot com

[08:08.960 --> 08:15.080]  future that will be but one that might be this is not a new world it is simply
[08:15.080 --> 08:20.520]  an extension of what began in the old one it has patterned itself after every
[08:20.520 --> 08:24.400]  dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of
[08:24.400 --> 08:30.280]  history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances
[08:30.280 --> 08:35.720]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like
[08:35.720 --> 08:41.520]  every one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic
[08:41.520 --> 08:45.360]  is an enemy and truth is a menace
[08:47.840 --> 08:54.920]  this is mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48 hours on earth he's a citizen of
[08:54.920 --> 08:59.200]  the state but will soon have to be eliminated because he is built out of
[08:59.200 --> 09:04.640]  flesh and because he has a mind mr. Romney Wordsworth who will draw his
[09:04.640 --> 09:09.440]  last breaths in the twilight zone
[09:13.400 --> 09:19.360]  ladies and gentlemen it is Wednesday the second day of September 2015 I am
[09:19.360 --> 09:25.240]  your host Alex Jones we're gonna break down an investigative report in the
[09:25.240 --> 09:31.480]  second hour detailing what is even a bigger threat than GMOs and vaccinations
[09:31.480 --> 09:38.200]  a bigger threat than additives a bigger threat than between all a and
[09:38.200 --> 09:46.720]  glyphosate I concur with our guest analysis that this is the new big
[09:46.720 --> 09:53.040]  threat that's actually been taking place for a decade and we're going to raise
[09:53.040 --> 09:59.160]  the awareness of the consciousness of this so that action can be taken and the
[09:59.160 --> 10:05.320]  good news is this radio TV transmission and other similar formats that are
[10:05.320 --> 10:10.880]  outside the political control box are more and more forcing real issues into
[10:10.880 --> 10:15.960]  the public mind and are beginning to take control of the debate you can see
[10:15.960 --> 10:19.400]  that on so many fronts people don't believe the establishment they're
[10:19.400 --> 10:27.160]  running from the establishment in droves it is a badge of honor to be censored
[10:27.160 --> 10:33.000]  and persecuted and attacked by the system because as Mahatma Gandhi said first
[10:33.000 --> 10:38.840]  they ignore you then they laugh at you then they attack you then you win and
[10:38.840 --> 10:44.800]  we are in the attack phase right now but quite frankly we're also beginning to
[10:44.800 --> 10:49.360]  go into the winning phase and of course in a complex world with thousands of
[10:49.360 --> 10:53.960]  different fights going on some things are in the laugh at your face the ignore
[10:53.960 --> 10:59.000]  you phase the attack you phase or the winning phase it's a mix of those but
[10:59.000 --> 11:05.040]  more and more we're moving into the attack phase and the win phase we're
[11:05.040 --> 11:10.600]  winning on some fronts we're being laughed at on some fronts we are in the
[11:10.600 --> 11:15.960]  attack phase on others and it's an epic historical time to be alive thank you
[11:15.960 --> 11:20.520]  so much for joining us Joe Biggs will be joining us at the bottom of the hour
[11:20.520 --> 11:28.680]  from Fox Lake Illinois a suburb of Chicago second city three cops murdered
[11:28.680 --> 11:33.120]  in less than a week another officer is found slaughtered in his Texas home
[11:33.120 --> 11:40.680]  amid growing safety fears and a manhunt for the Illinois cop killers who got
[11:40.680 --> 11:44.600]  away we'll be breaking that down and Joe is there on the ground we talked to him
[11:44.600 --> 11:47.840]  15 minutes ago he said a lot of the door-to-door has been suspended but that's
[11:47.840 --> 11:51.880]  not been announced in the news yet but Joe heard the police actually talking
[11:51.880 --> 11:55.480]  about it he's got a lot of video he shot since he got on the ground an hour ago
[11:55.480 --> 12:03.640]  and they just got announced again homicide suspected in an off-duty Texas
[12:03.640 --> 12:08.360]  officer's death in his home we have another cop shot of course in Houston
[12:08.360 --> 12:13.280]  over the weekend we have the TV reporter and the cameraman killed and much of it
[12:13.280 --> 12:18.520]  is black-on-white activity with Lewis Farrakhan we played the clip yesterday
[12:18.520 --> 12:23.640]  saying it's time to go out and start killing people that are killing us and
[12:23.640 --> 12:30.400]  that ties in to the different radio shows that are out there where folks are
[12:30.400 --> 12:39.800]  calling for the murder of police officers a very very dangerous precedent
[12:39.800 --> 12:45.000]  the articles on info wars com with the audio and video kill whites and cops
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.240]  close quote black lives matter affiliated radio show calls for race war by
[12:50.240 --> 12:54.080]  the way this is based out of Texas this was done it's about to go down it's open
[12:54.080 --> 13:01.440]  season on killing white people and crackers well you know it was the
[13:01.440 --> 13:06.560]  drug doubt mentally ill white supremacist a few months ago that killed
[13:06.560 --> 13:10.440]  nine innocent black people in Charleston South Carolina and he said he
[13:10.440 --> 13:13.840]  wanted to start a race war and of course the White House wants to start one as
[13:13.840 --> 13:18.200]  well and Sheriff Rich David Clark and others have pointed that out we've
[13:18.200 --> 13:22.000]  pointed out of course at nauseam and they're having some success this is
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.960]  truly sickening and it's despicable and the people getting away with it you know
[13:27.960 --> 13:32.720]  I used to hear how Hal Turner a prominent white supremacist who attacked me
[13:32.720 --> 13:36.520]  basically every time he was on the radio and called for folks to come after me
[13:36.520 --> 13:42.400]  for no reason other than the fact that I really am anti-establishment really
[13:42.400 --> 13:47.080]  trying to change things and I said there's no way he's allowed to call for
[13:47.080 --> 13:51.720]  killing judges and killing people and attacking minorities if he wasn't a
[13:51.720 --> 13:55.960]  federal informant or probably a high-level national security asset of
[13:55.960 --> 14:00.880]  the Southern Primary Law Center or ADL but he's definitely with the FBI when
[14:00.880 --> 14:05.920]  that began to come out in court hackers hit his computers released the info and
[14:05.920 --> 14:10.720]  right after it came out that he was FBI which was later confirmed they indicted
[14:10.720 --> 14:15.160]  him for his statements which they admit he was authorized to make so they even
[14:15.160 --> 14:23.280]  set up their own people and Hal Turner didn't believe a word of what he was
[14:23.280 --> 14:34.400]  saying Turner's probably a fake name but certainly didn't even look like he was
[14:34.400 --> 14:40.360]  you know this big Anglo Saxon he claimed he was so this is the type of stuff
[14:40.360 --> 14:44.800]  going on behind the scenes and we know Black Lives Matter is White House and
[14:44.800 --> 14:48.960]  Ford Foundation and George Soros funded we know Hillary's involved with her
[14:48.960 --> 14:53.360]  staffers Nancy Pelosi is involved running major groups and putting out the
[14:53.360 --> 15:00.960]  talking points this shows how cold bloodedly evil these people are now
[15:00.960 --> 15:05.160]  that said we're gonna get into a video after we cover abortion because all
[15:05.160 --> 15:11.840]  this ties together from KSAT out of San Antonio we have the unedited video of
[15:11.840 --> 15:17.520]  the fatal deputy involved shooting and it shows a guy kind of running around in
[15:17.520 --> 15:24.480]  the yard pointing his finger he puts his hands up and then the cops clearly one
[15:24.480 --> 15:28.720]  officer shoots him and kills him we've enhanced the video because it shot from
[15:28.720 --> 15:33.000]  about 70 80 yards away and I don't see him with a knife in his hand I don't
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.240]  see anything we're gonna play this video coming up and they put a huge bug
[15:37.240 --> 15:40.560]  right over it which is just ridiculous but whatever we're playing it very
[15:40.560 --> 15:47.040]  used to document this and they shoot him in the in the chest and the torso and
[15:47.040 --> 15:54.200]  killing and the cop just his body language acts like he cared less and
[15:54.200 --> 16:00.480]  they're just having an excited manhunt or something and the police
[16:00.480 --> 16:07.960]  department sheriff's department came out and criticized KSAT ABC News 2 for
[16:07.960 --> 16:13.760]  releasing this we're gonna play the enhanced video now if you're a TV viewer
[16:13.760 --> 16:19.760]  saying that it it hurts the officers who haven't been charged yet well you
[16:19.760 --> 16:23.480]  know what it's America you got your surveillance cameras everywhere and who
[16:23.480 --> 16:27.600]  knows what story you were gonna put out before this came out but his arms his
[16:27.600 --> 16:35.080]  hands are clearly up and they're killing and he looks like what I call a white
[16:35.080 --> 16:38.760]  Hispanic a lot of Hispanics identify as white as far as I'm concerned they look
[16:38.760 --> 16:45.720]  like they're white I mean Spain Spain is European and the whole point is if this
[16:45.720 --> 16:49.240]  was a black person you would probably already have riots going on over this
[16:49.240 --> 16:53.680]  and that's because you've got the White House in there stirring everything up
[16:53.680 --> 16:57.240]  because they've double black unemployment they're screwing black people over
[16:57.240 --> 17:00.240]  they're targeting them with abortions but if they get up there and act like
[17:00.240 --> 17:03.640]  they're racially aligned with black folks they'll continue to stay on the
[17:03.640 --> 17:08.720]  globalist plantation the globalist reservation but here's what I'm getting
[17:08.720 --> 17:12.800]  it whether it's that homeless white guy being executed in Albuquerque and the
[17:12.800 --> 17:17.960]  cops laughing about it or whether it's the cops executing this guy in San
[17:17.960 --> 17:23.800]  Antonio there are some dangerous mentally ill people on police forces that
[17:23.800 --> 17:31.640]  have no business being ushers at a movie theater much less executing you know
[17:31.640 --> 17:39.640]  deadly force on people but if you look at what happened in Albuquerque the cop
[17:39.640 --> 17:42.960]  that did the first shooting has been indicted looks like he's gonna serve
[17:42.960 --> 17:53.040]  prison time but in San Antonio they execute Gilbert Flores Jr. in his
[17:53.040 --> 17:59.520]  middle-class neighborhood kill him deader than a hammer all because it looks
[17:59.520 --> 18:04.880]  like the cop is trigger happy and is so afraid and so ready to pull the trigger
[18:04.880 --> 18:08.320]  that he's the type of guy that would be deer hunting and would shoot a
[18:08.320 --> 18:13.560]  neighbor's cow over the fence line thinking it was a deer we've all taken
[18:13.560 --> 18:18.160]  people hunting if we're hunters who you learn have no business hunting because
[18:18.160 --> 18:21.400]  you'll hear all this shooting 20 minutes after you put them on the deer stand and
[18:21.400 --> 18:27.880]  you get there and they're just shooting blindly at the bushes or whatever and
[18:27.880 --> 18:32.280]  those type of people do not need to be police officers now that said I'm gonna
[18:32.280 --> 18:37.720]  tie all this together when we come back there is new planned parenthood video I
[18:37.720 --> 18:42.880]  guess this is like the ninth video that's been released where a company that
[18:42.880 --> 18:48.560]  specializes in getting intact babies makes the little joke oh the babies just
[18:48.560 --> 18:53.440]  fall out on the floor and then we can exercise their organs a lot better now
[18:53.440 --> 18:57.400]  that's what I told you before all this came out because I've aired
[18:57.400 --> 19:00.760]  documentaries before on my local TV show and covered it with the experts
[19:00.760 --> 19:09.120]  footage shot in the 90s where insiders admitted that they would commit crimes
[19:09.120 --> 19:12.840]  I'm gonna skip this network break it's it's this is too important time about the
[19:12.840 --> 19:21.240]  babies I'm not gonna stop right here thank you they would take the babies out
[19:21.240 --> 19:27.640]  have the mother drug have a sheet up in front of her push her out of the room
[19:27.640 --> 19:35.320]  and then they would very quietly take the baby over keep it alive in some cases
[19:35.320 --> 19:38.560]  if it's like an eight month they can really make hundreds of thousands the
[19:38.560 --> 19:42.240]  word is they'll even put them on life support like China does with political
[19:42.240 --> 19:45.480]  dissidents they'll even put them on oxygen and stuff and try to limit
[19:45.480 --> 19:49.600]  bleeding while they do the surgery and then remove the heart and lungs last
[19:49.600 --> 19:56.760]  well now this has come out and there's video of them talking about it but they
[19:56.760 --> 20:02.680]  make a little joke oh the baby just falls on the ground abortionists call it
[20:02.680 --> 20:12.160]  the ultimate nightmare they call it basically different terms but what they
[20:12.160 --> 20:17.880]  do is if it's a six seven eighth ninth month old baby and the surgeons and
[20:17.880 --> 20:21.400]  people blow the whistle in these documentaries I've aired some clips of
[20:21.400 --> 20:26.040]  them here they hold the baby up against the cervix it's through the cervix I
[20:26.040 --> 20:28.800]  don't want to be gross here but this is going on so we're gonna medically talk
[20:28.800 --> 20:33.600]  about it it's a documentary radio show slash TV show you they hold the baby up
[20:33.600 --> 20:39.640]  just touching the woman and as long as they claim legally the baby never doesn't
[20:39.640 --> 20:45.600]  touch the woman then technically it's not a born baby it's a fetus and they
[20:45.600 --> 20:50.760]  play some manacle games and do that but when they say it hits the ground under
[20:50.760 --> 20:54.760]  federal and state law the babies now got to be saved now before they were
[20:54.760 --> 20:57.960]  selling body parts 20 something years ago there's a lot of famous people a
[20:57.960 --> 21:00.960]  black lady a white lady I forget their names we've had one of them on the show
[21:00.960 --> 21:05.760]  before we got to get them back on who were dug out of dumpsters by pro-lifers
[21:05.760 --> 21:08.880]  when they were seven and eight months old respectively one of them had her
[21:08.880 --> 21:12.960]  thigh broken and cut open she's a blonde-haired lady so she always limps up
[21:12.960 --> 21:16.080]  at the stage she's a beautiful woman ended up having kids on her own right
[21:16.080 --> 21:21.120]  she was dug out one hour after she was aborted out of the dumpster so was the
[21:21.120 --> 21:25.800]  black lady she was dug out almost a day later out of the dumpster we've had the
[21:25.800 --> 21:28.960]  blonde lady on we could never get the black lady on but you I forget their
[21:28.960 --> 21:33.440]  names just Google woman survived abortion there's a whole bunch of women not
[21:33.440 --> 21:37.080]  many men female babies are a lot tougher than male babies any medical
[21:37.080 --> 21:41.800]  doctor will tell you that especially if they're a Ron Paul type doctor that
[21:41.800 --> 21:51.160]  liver babies but this is what they do and they keep them alive reportedly some
[21:51.160 --> 21:55.600]  of these outfits so we have we have this audio we have this video it's up on
[21:55.600 --> 22:02.520]  info wars.com Planned Parenthood baby parts vendor ABR pays off clinics they
[22:02.520 --> 22:07.600]  say intact fetuses just fell out ha ha ha but the most important clip of the two
[22:07.600 --> 22:15.680]  we have is where they explain under bush one and then the next bush where they
[22:15.680 --> 22:20.040]  all said oh they won't let us have embryos for medical research you know
[22:20.040 --> 22:24.480]  they're just a few cells no that's how they legally did it in Congress and
[22:24.480 --> 22:28.360]  fooled the Christian right and everybody or folks that just think all lives
[22:28.360 --> 22:34.440]  matter people that have empathy is they go oh we're not killing embryos but
[22:34.440 --> 22:40.200]  under the classification a fetus which is up to nine months old hasn't left the
[22:40.200 --> 22:47.080]  womb a baby but called a fetus it can be killed and it can be sold but it's a
[22:47.080 --> 22:53.320]  baby once it's no longer touching the mother umbilical cord connected doesn't
[22:53.320 --> 23:01.000]  count that that once the baby's not touching the mother once it's come out
[23:01.000 --> 23:05.720]  once it's been quote delivered it's now a baby under all these weird
[23:05.720 --> 23:12.480]  regulations and laws that dehumanize so here they are all macabre admitting
[23:12.480 --> 23:17.600]  this as usual slurping wine sitting around enjoying themselves in a
[23:17.600 --> 23:22.800]  restaurant and we're told scores of more videos are coming out and they're
[23:22.800 --> 23:26.920]  putting these videos out unedited three hours long two hours long five hours
[23:26.920 --> 23:31.960]  long six hours long and then of course others like ourselves going and cut out
[23:31.960 --> 23:38.760]  the actual clips and play the meat no pun intended of what's going on here but
[23:38.760 --> 23:44.360]  black lives matter cops lives matter white lives matter Hispanic lives matter
[23:44.360 --> 23:50.560]  old people's lives matter veterans lives matter babies lives everybody's lives
[23:50.560 --> 23:58.800]  matter and you cannot get the leftist controlled communist controlled Soros
[23:58.800 --> 24:05.000]  funded hateful black clan groups who are going around calling for killing
[24:05.000 --> 24:10.080]  crackers randomly and killing cops randomly like a double goodie if you
[24:10.080 --> 24:14.640]  kill a white cop for them you can't get through I've gone to their events I've
[24:14.640 --> 24:19.080]  tried to talk to them I've tried to get David Duke on to explain their abort
[24:19.080 --> 24:24.000]  and all the black babies and there's a larger program against everybody and you
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.720]  just can't reach out to the racial groups because they're all in their own
[24:27.720 --> 24:32.600]  group they all have their own spiel that they put out that you cannot get past
[24:32.600 --> 24:38.640]  and so that's fine I'm here trying to reach out to people who in their hearts
[24:38.640 --> 24:45.840]  love innocents love children love our veterans love good police love innocent
[24:45.840 --> 24:48.880]  people that are killed when I hear about a cop getting shot cold-bloodedly in the
[24:48.880 --> 24:52.440]  back and I see the video it makes me physically sick when I see this poor
[24:52.440 --> 25:00.080]  guy in San Antonio executed by this little dwarf cop it makes me sick when
[25:00.080 --> 25:06.240]  I see this cop killed up in Illinois execution style it makes me sick I have
[25:06.240 --> 25:11.280]  empathy when I saw that black woman gunned down in DC for being scared of a
[25:11.280 --> 25:16.400]  checkpoint it made me sick it was black and white cops shooting her up but I
[25:16.400 --> 25:20.520]  don't hate all black people because there's some racist black people out
[25:20.520 --> 25:23.680]  there targeting white people I don't hate all white people because there's some
[25:23.680 --> 25:27.880]  racist white people out there targeting black people I don't hate all the police
[25:27.880 --> 25:32.480]  because there are some mentally ill and some thugs some gangbanger types some
[25:32.480 --> 25:40.400]  psychos they just indicted a cop up in Oklahoma who would pull over women turn
[25:40.400 --> 25:43.960]  off a squad car camera reportedly tell them have sex with me or I'm gonna bring
[25:43.960 --> 25:47.560]  you in for your warrants and he's arguing well they agreed to have sex so
[25:47.560 --> 25:51.960]  it's okay no you intimidated them with your power so you've been indicted but
[25:51.960 --> 25:55.240]  they haven't died at it and it was a state police that found out and busted
[25:55.240 --> 26:00.960]  him and that's good but don't cover it up because then you're aiding and
[26:00.960 --> 26:06.520]  abetting it our society is unraveling the globalist want destabilization we
[26:06.520 --> 26:10.560]  don't want to go along with what they want we want to bring unity of liberty
[26:10.560 --> 26:15.000]  and freedom and then recognize the globalist social engineers as the enemy
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.640]  they're the people poisoning our water with fluoride they're the ones
[26:18.640 --> 26:21.800]  harvesting our baby's organs they're the ones putting the veterans on don't
[26:21.800 --> 26:25.200]  treat death list they're the ones preparing homeland security to go out
[26:25.200 --> 26:30.680]  for gun owners they're the ones working with tyrants and funding ISIS they're
[26:30.680 --> 26:35.320]  the bad guys they're the problem they're the premeditated evil that's why they
[26:35.320 --> 26:39.520]  want us fighting with each other let's go to the first clip which one do we have
[26:39.520 --> 26:43.960]  queued up first I'm sorry I wasn't clear with our great okay so so so here they
[26:43.960 --> 26:50.080]  are in Los Angeles this new video the ninth video baby part scandal focuses
[26:50.080 --> 26:54.400]  on advanced bioscience resources Inc the small and secretive company that has
[26:54.400 --> 26:58.360]  harvested and sold fetal body parts at Planned Parenthood clinics more than any
[26:58.360 --> 27:01.920]  other entity and here they are oh sometimes they just fall out we've got
[27:01.920 --> 27:05.920]  the whole baby oh it's an accident doesn't matter you claim it's an accident
[27:05.920 --> 27:11.640]  the baby couldn't be terminated now it's a baby because it fell out and it's a
[27:11.640 --> 27:16.720]  federal crime once the baby is outside the mother to do this here it is
[27:16.720 --> 27:21.560]  whole point is not to have a live birth and so the so the doctors have all
[27:21.560 --> 27:26.440]  unless it's somebody who has had six pregnancies and six bad jungle liver
[27:26.440 --> 27:30.360]  and I just got a pops out they put lambs in and she comes in the next morning and
[27:30.360 --> 27:35.160]  I literally have had women come in and don't go to the OR and they're back out
[27:35.160 --> 27:40.080]  three minutes oh yeah the fetus is already in the vaginal canal whenever
[27:40.080 --> 27:46.160]  the food putters it just fell out oh yeah the fetus is already in the vaginal
[27:46.160 --> 27:51.040]  canal whenever the food putter but then what do you do well there have been
[27:51.040 --> 27:54.120]  clinics that have been indicted there have been head surgeons that have been
[27:54.120 --> 27:57.080]  indicted around the country it's one of the most common ways we can indict these
[27:57.080 --> 28:00.280]  people when their staff admits now the baby was alive they went put it in a
[28:00.280 --> 28:06.880]  bucket of water but see the way they terminate babies now is if you are a
[28:06.880 --> 28:11.440]  preemie they will shoot you up with vaccines and they know the baby then
[28:11.440 --> 28:16.040]  quits breathing the nurses then under law fight to resuscitate they give them
[28:16.040 --> 28:20.840]  electro defibrillation they they put tubes on the throat but it's it's bye
[28:20.840 --> 28:25.800]  bye they turn blue and die and we have callers that calling and go yeah yeah my
[28:25.800 --> 28:30.560]  sister had a preemie six months old they gave them shots died that day babies
[28:30.560 --> 28:34.680]  fine give them the shots and see they just hide it all medically in plain view
[28:34.680 --> 28:37.960]  like it's no big deal let's go to the clip as we go to break where they talk
[28:37.960 --> 28:43.200]  about how they classify him as fetus is not embryos so they can still sell their
[28:43.200 --> 28:47.800]  parts here it is because of what we do because we use fetal tissue we don't
[28:47.800 --> 29:02.360]  want to you're getting all these scientific people here then and they're
[29:02.360 --> 29:06.280]  all agreeing yeah it's kind of counterintuitive isn't it right like
[29:06.280 --> 29:09.440]  normally like embryonic sense the reason like the big controversial like
[29:09.440 --> 29:14.880]  whatever and like and you know what the weird thing is embryonic there's still a
[29:14.880 --> 29:19.120]  lot of controversy about yeah you know but then fetal kind of got lost in the
[29:19.120 --> 29:24.600]  mix you know yeah was it ever I mean I'm young so I don't know it was never it
[29:24.600 --> 29:31.000]  was never outlawed where during the Bush administration Bush one Bush one it
[29:31.000 --> 29:38.040]  was it was no federal funding could go to stem cell research or see but it can go
[29:38.040 --> 29:42.240]  to fetal see how they played you see how the bushes played you see how it's all
[29:42.240 --> 29:46.840]  a big joke oh they can have babies under seven months old chop them up but not
[29:46.840 --> 29:53.440]  the little embryo we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones and the

[34:01.200 --> 34:05.640]  been green-lighted from the White House to bring this country down and the fact
[34:05.640 --> 34:08.720]  that they're doing something this reckless means they're going for broke
[34:08.720 --> 34:15.720]  this is an unprecedented time to be alive and again we have babies black

[34:25.120 --> 34:34.160]  going oh banned fetal tissue or or ban embryonic but don't ban fetal this is
[34:34.160 --> 34:39.480]  the semantical word games that they play and I told you when the Pope first got
[34:39.480 --> 34:44.400]  in a few years ago after they had the coup d'etat inside the Vatican with the
[34:44.400 --> 34:49.520]  Jesuits using the sex scandal even the Guardian reported was a blackmail
[34:49.520 --> 34:54.200]  operation to bring in Pope Francis he wants world government he wants carbon
[34:54.200 --> 34:58.840]  taxes he wants everything he's coming here first pope ever to lecture Congress
[34:58.840 --> 35:03.160]  and travel around the country basically campaigning for the Democratic Party
[35:03.160 --> 35:09.080]  he came out and said Catholics need to stop obsessing so much over abortion
[35:09.080 --> 35:17.720]  well now he's in the New York Times today Pope Francis eases path to absolution
[35:17.720 --> 35:25.680]  from abortion he has the path not Christ God's not the judge he speaking
[35:25.680 --> 35:34.560]  from the Cathedral from the big black throne is it called ex-cathedra he has
[35:34.560 --> 35:42.240]  the keys to hell and death not Christ he was given the keys he says and now he
[35:42.240 --> 35:46.120]  will tell you that abortion is okay
[35:46.360 --> 35:51.640]  well it's God that can forgive you and absolutely you can be forgiven on my
[35:51.640 --> 35:55.880]  heart I know that if you truly repent but whether you're a Christian or not this
[35:55.880 --> 36:01.240]  guy if you read the Christian doctrine is not Christ he doesn't forgive he
[36:01.240 --> 36:05.040]  doesn't sit on the white throne of judgment he sits on a black throne at
[36:05.040 --> 36:11.080]  the Vatican why wouldn't the Vatican have a white throne I just have trouble
[36:11.080 --> 36:17.680]  understanding that but Pope Francis eases the path to absolution I absolve
[36:17.680 --> 36:24.120]  you hope Francis announced Tuesday that all Roman Catholic priests would be
[36:24.120 --> 36:27.720]  empowered to offer absolution for the son of abortion during the church holy
[36:27.720 --> 36:32.720]  year of mercy which begins in December so hey that's basically hey don't worry
[36:32.720 --> 36:36.920]  about drinking safe you know 10 Hail Marys oh whatever you cheat on your wife
[36:36.920 --> 36:44.240]  say 20 Hail Marys oh you killed your baby say 50 Hail Marys I mean wow that is
[36:44.240 --> 36:49.200]  sensational baby and I told you the next shoe is dropping you're gonna see the
[36:49.200 --> 36:54.800]  most wild stuff you've ever seen in your life now this is it world government
[36:54.800 --> 37:02.200]  world famines wars banning the word father and mother boy and girl the church
[37:02.200 --> 37:05.800]  coming out and endorsing that the Pope did that three days ago saying yes
[37:05.800 --> 37:10.360]  these are hurtful and endorsing a lesbian rider that's basically calling for
[37:10.360 --> 37:19.080]  this I mean it's on folks it's on and they use pedophelian stuff to take over
[37:19.080 --> 37:22.480]  the church and now they're gonna legitimize it now that they've conquered
[37:22.480 --> 37:27.920]  it and again this is a sex cult put right down wrong before on the time of
[37:27.920 --> 37:34.200]  the Caesars and you can just see the destabilization taking place I'm gonna
[37:34.200 --> 37:42.000]  get to the new incredible video and audio it's up on info wars calm kill
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  whites and cops black lives matter affiliated radio show calls for race
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.720]  war it's about to go down it's open season on killing white people and
[37:48.720 --> 37:53.560]  crackers and then that'll be open season for mentally ill hate mongering white
[37:53.560 --> 37:58.040]  people to go out and you know it'll just be some totally innocent black lady or
[37:58.040 --> 38:03.080]  some innocent black guy coming home from work some plumber or some little kids
[38:03.080 --> 38:08.240]  in their car and then some crazy meth head white guy gonna spray the vehicle
[38:08.240 --> 38:13.200]  and I mean it just and that's why the White House and the Justice Department
[38:13.200 --> 38:21.160]  lets these groups do this guarantee their federal run and I'm gonna say shame on
[38:21.160 --> 38:25.400]  the FBI shame on the ATF shame on all these eight federal marshals all of you
[38:25.400 --> 38:29.640]  if you don't take matters into your own hands and get you'll go talk to local
[38:29.640 --> 38:33.000]  grand juries whatever you've got influence have locals indict these
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.320]  people because when you start saying it's time to kill cops it's time to go out
[38:37.320 --> 38:40.320]  and shoot people because they're white that's not free speech that's a call to
[38:40.320 --> 38:44.680]  action just like if the Cuckoo clan says it's time to go lynch black people
[38:44.680 --> 38:48.960]  and burn up their churches that's a call for violent sedition against people's
[38:48.960 --> 38:55.680]  peace and freedom and it is calling for organized murder it is attempted capital
[38:55.680 --> 39:01.320]  murder I'm no prosecutor but I studied the law and I guarantee you some white
[39:01.320 --> 39:04.440]  guy calls for white people to go kill people and it starts happening when
[39:04.440 --> 39:08.640]  those people get indicted for it you get indicted as an accomplice does the
[39:08.640 --> 39:12.000]  does the head don and a mafia organization go out and kill people no his
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.160]  soldiers and muscle do but he'll get the death penalty when they get the death
[39:16.160 --> 39:23.840]  penalty if he gets caught because he gave the order and it makes me sick to
[39:23.840 --> 39:29.840]  watch the George Soros run criminal operation try to take over alternative
[39:29.840 --> 39:34.120]  media try to destroy the libertarian movement try to go after patriots and
[39:34.120 --> 39:38.480]  then try to put out a narrative that we want to kill cops but they can't ever
[39:38.480 --> 39:44.400]  show a single clip of us saying it that helped me wake up to this thing is what
[39:44.400 --> 39:47.720]  is this obsession with killing cops they want to kill cops and they say we want to
[39:47.720 --> 39:53.520]  kill cops then I realized oh my gosh they're gonna false flag us like 95 the
[39:53.520 --> 39:59.480]  good news is they're bad apples they're bad training it's globalist culture
[39:59.480 --> 40:04.640]  there's some really bad departments but overall stacking the police up against
[40:04.640 --> 40:10.680]  the public the police are more awake than the public probably five times the
[40:10.680 --> 40:14.040]  average cop I talked to you whether it's LA or Austin or New York is like
[40:14.040 --> 40:17.320]  absolutely we know Oklahoma City's an inside job absolutely we know the
[40:17.320 --> 40:20.520]  government's funding Al Qaeda absolutely we know the government ships in the
[40:20.520 --> 40:24.160]  drugs absolutely no there's a plan purge the veterans and police down the
[40:24.160 --> 40:28.640]  road absolutely we're pro-gun look at national polls 98% of cops and national
[40:28.640 --> 40:34.040]  polls are pro-gun if George Soros wants us to have a war with the police what
[40:34.040 --> 40:38.120]  does that tell you and if they take these examples of bad cops and create the
[40:38.120 --> 40:42.480]  perception that the police are out killing everybody just like people have
[40:42.480 --> 40:47.400]  a perception that gun crimes weigh up it's down 50 plus percents is 92 even the
[40:47.400 --> 40:52.840]  liberals admit that in the LA Times and New York Times just type it in we can
[40:52.840 --> 40:57.480]  type it in gun crime way down but public thinks it's up same thing now cop
[40:57.480 --> 41:05.760]  shooting the public is pretty much flat since about 2000 it was up in the 80s
[41:05.760 --> 41:08.640]  because of the whole crack war but it's still way too much and there are
[41:08.640 --> 41:12.440]  horrible cops there are and these fraternal orders protect bad people in
[41:12.440 --> 41:15.600]  many cases it's shameful and you're destroying your own good name in your
[41:15.600 --> 41:19.080]  own profession and I am the guy that wrote the book on fighting the police
[41:19.080 --> 41:24.320]  state but not the police fighting the twisting and the destruction of peace
[41:24.320 --> 41:29.080]  officers and our local systems of government
[41:30.840 --> 41:35.920]  they're seeing in gun homicides violence down sharply in past 20 years just
[41:35.920 --> 41:41.480]  department on numbers but they admit that here and there but never in the
[41:41.480 --> 41:46.040]  general so I want to put together a special report where we got loose fair
[41:46.040 --> 41:50.040]  con calling for violence we got these black lives matter grips kill the pigs
[41:50.040 --> 42:01.720]  give them wings pigs in a blanket fry them like bacon and then compare that to
[42:01.720 --> 42:06.360]  what would happen if I called for that but I mean why would I call for killing
[42:06.360 --> 42:12.440]  black people randomly those are human beings I feel terrible but then there's
[42:12.440 --> 42:16.440]  this mindless attitude like well we'll get you and then we're gonna we're gonna
[42:16.440 --> 42:20.840]  get you back it's like when the globalist pushed a culture of black
[42:20.840 --> 42:24.480]  people couldn't kill each other because they were different colors so it was like
[42:24.480 --> 42:30.000]  oh you're wearing blue or you're wearing red and what is it 76 to 90% depending
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.400]  on where you are in the country like 90% in Chicago 90% or higher and say
[42:34.400 --> 42:41.600]  Compton places in South Central LA when you go when you look at those places
[42:41.600 --> 42:46.320]  it's blacks killing blacks here's the crack cocaine here's the music telling
[42:46.320 --> 42:50.080]  you it's cool and then here you know this guy's a Crip this guy's a blood
[42:50.080 --> 42:54.080]  that's how stupid all of this is and now they want us all to dress up like
[42:54.080 --> 42:58.560]  Crips and Bloods and just kill each other like a bunch of morons this is so
[42:58.560 --> 43:05.000]  transparent show over the top and I can't believe that our government is that
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.640]  reckless but our government isn't our government it's a bunch of offshore
[43:08.640 --> 43:12.440]  globalist who'll destabilize the whole world they'll turn ISIS loose destroy
[43:12.440 --> 43:17.840]  the whole Middle East and Africa order out of chaos that's their game but I am
[43:17.840 --> 43:23.000]  calling they got probable cause these people are organizing murder of police
[43:23.000 --> 43:29.960]  and citizens these people putting out these videos need to be rated today and
[43:29.960 --> 43:33.720]  I guarantee you you're gonna find the literature and the statements and the
[43:33.720 --> 43:39.120]  plans to kill people and they need to be indicted right now and if they've got
[43:39.120 --> 43:42.360]  white supremacist groups running around organizing mass murder they need to be
[43:42.360 --> 43:45.320]  indicted but the white supremacists won't even shoot their mouths off like
[43:45.320 --> 43:50.240]  this but see they got White House backing to destabilize things they're not
[43:50.240 --> 43:53.440]  gonna crush these radical racist black groups until all hell hits the fan oh
[43:53.440 --> 43:57.240]  they're gonna get arrested they're gonna get killed they're gonna get put in
[43:57.240 --> 44:01.720]  prison but they're gonna be used first to start the nationwide riots how about
[44:01.720 --> 44:05.960]  the police do their job and the grand juries do their job and the feds do
[44:05.960 --> 44:09.840]  their job and how about oh I'm sorry Eric Holder was a big radical communist
[44:09.840 --> 44:15.240]  black radical himself well how about this new lady stops this and how about
[44:15.240 --> 44:18.880]  you shut these people down oh I'm sorry George Soros put Obama in the White
[44:18.880 --> 44:24.200]  House I'm sorry these people are doing their jobs aren't they let me talk to
[44:24.200 --> 44:27.520]  the young idiots who are shooting their mouths off some of them don't know
[44:27.520 --> 44:31.240]  they're run by the feds you're the biggest morons on the planet and you
[44:31.240 --> 44:35.920]  better come out right now and reverse all your murderous planning and all your
[44:35.920 --> 44:40.120]  murderous talk or let me tell you something you're gonna end up in federal
[44:40.120 --> 44:43.400]  prison or you're gonna end up with the police when they finally unloose their
[44:43.400 --> 44:48.920]  leash are gonna kill you deader than a hammer you stupid idiot and Lewis
[44:48.920 --> 44:54.120]  Farrakhan all crazed up there with a bunch of guys with bow ties
[44:54.880 --> 44:58.520]  Lewis Farrakhan isn't stupid his buddy could offer you got set up and murdered
[44:58.520 --> 45:03.200]  by his precious Obama what do you think they're gonna do to you you think they're
[45:03.200 --> 45:06.360]  gonna let you get away with this they're gonna set you up in the end Farrakhan
[45:06.360 --> 45:09.320]  maybe that's why you live in the Caribbean nine months out of the year
[45:09.320 --> 45:13.240]  then flies in real quick to make these statements and gets out real quick
[45:13.240 --> 45:18.240]  like all the other billionaires what is your problem Farrakhan try to start a
[45:18.240 --> 45:21.680]  race war in this country I get the fact you don't like black people with the
[45:21.680 --> 45:24.760]  minimum sentences people get killed but let me tell you something what you're
[45:24.760 --> 45:28.240]  doing is not gonna help black people let's hear you talk about abortion let's
[45:28.240 --> 45:31.920]  hear you talk about infanticide let's hear about all lives matter instead of
[45:31.920 --> 45:36.920]  shooting your mouth off I guess Malcolm X stop saying all white people are evil
[45:36.920 --> 45:41.320]  we know what happened to him huh how long has the nation of Islam been on the
[45:41.320 --> 45:45.480]  FBI payroll how long's the nation of Islam been on that that nation of Islam
[45:45.480 --> 45:50.360]  gravy train with the FBI I'll tell you something I used to read that and hear
[45:50.360 --> 45:53.880]  that I didn't believe it but let me tell you I've never seen anybody be able to
[45:53.880 --> 45:57.480]  get away with what you said and not get in trouble but maybe you are just crazy
[45:57.480 --> 46:02.040]  because you sure seem to love it when I talked about 1776 commencing again if
[46:02.040 --> 46:05.960]  they try to take our guns but that's because it will commence not because I
[46:05.960 --> 46:10.840]  want it to commence I was there warning him he better back down right now with
[46:10.840 --> 46:14.280]  his red coat garbage and the globalist better understand that they're not gonna
[46:14.280 --> 46:19.840]  have their takeover it wasn't because I wanted innocent people to get killed and
[46:19.840 --> 46:24.040]  yeah I tell you if the cop that shot that black guy on the back who they've
[46:24.040 --> 46:27.800]  indicted doesn't end up getting a hard prison time or the death penalty then I
[46:27.800 --> 46:32.120]  could see it I wouldn't condone it if somebody went after him but that would
[46:32.120 --> 46:36.320]  be logical that would be justice it's not justice to shoot some innocent cop in
[46:36.320 --> 46:40.680]  the back now I'm done ranting on that subject I'm gonna get to these videos
[46:40.680 --> 46:46.400]  in a moment and finish up on it but first Leanne McAdoo the lovely the
[46:46.400 --> 46:50.800]  intelligent one of the anchors of the nightly news is here with us and the
[46:50.800 --> 46:57.000]  shirt is a little big on her it's a medium should have got her a small I
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.800]  wasn't thinking I said here have McAdoo model this for us I appreciate her
[46:59.800 --> 47:04.400]  doing it people wanted it they just came in on the truck we have a limited
[47:04.400 --> 47:09.480]  supply we get more in a few weeks Hillary for prison 2016 I think we have the

[47:12.920 --> 47:17.360]  info wars.com and the other says legalized freedom I mean you can't see
[47:17.360 --> 47:21.880]  it under her hair but it's there and when people say what do you mean Hillary
[47:21.880 --> 47:26.640]  for prison say info wars.com so I think there's a lot of kind of underground
[47:26.640 --> 47:29.800]  maid ones and I think look fine ours really looks like a real campaign shirt

[47:47.040 --> 47:51.000]  the whip and we got this designed and it's got printed up right here in
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.560]  America just the last few days and the trucks just hold in we got a second
[47:56.560 --> 48:00.560]  order and it'll be in in about two weeks but I think this limited quick run

[48:13.520 --> 48:16.640]  they're all crooks they are a lot of them crooks but Hillary's one of the
[48:16.640 --> 48:20.240]  chief ones she's one of the most convicted in public opinion she's one of
[48:20.240 --> 48:24.280]  the most known crooks they're pulling down Hillary for prison signs all over
[48:24.280 --> 48:27.720]  the country they're trying to stop the sale of them online they're scared of
[48:27.720 --> 48:32.720]  this so please get your limited edition I'm only gonna sell it for the next three
[48:32.720 --> 48:38.760]  four months or so we're only gonna sell the Hillary for prison shirt till the end

[48:52.720 --> 49:00.560]  Leigh Ann McAdoo do you have any breakdown or view on the escalating open
[49:00.560 --> 49:05.000]  call to murder police and white people I mean is this not getting epic it really
[49:05.000 --> 49:10.040]  is we called it months ago I think all of us were behind that you know natural
[49:10.040 --> 49:13.400]  spark of revolution that happened fighting against the militarization of
[49:13.400 --> 49:20.920]  the police state but then we saw it quickly shifted into divide and conquer
[49:20.920 --> 49:25.600]  black versus white us against the cops and all that's gonna do is create an
[49:25.600 --> 49:30.320]  even bigger police state so you know I think it's pretty obvious what's
[49:30.320 --> 49:35.440]  happening here we're already seeing you know a white guy in Texas here now
[49:35.440 --> 49:41.240]  calling to attack the other race so we predicted it and it's happening and it's
[49:41.240 --> 49:44.640]  pretty frightening actually well there'll be some of them are mentally ill on
[49:44.640 --> 49:49.160]  both sides yeah but others are federal or foundation operatives guaranteed and
[49:49.160 --> 49:54.160]  you guys are saying something I hear what were you saying oh absolutely the
[49:54.160 --> 49:58.440]  Hillary Clinton pin is also and I called the distributor of this we just

[50:11.040 --> 50:17.720]  she's laughing we're done Hillary Clinton for prison 2016 the t-shirt sorry
[50:17.720 --> 50:21.680]  didn't mean to interrupt you but look at how they got the Republicans to say

[54:12.120 --> 54:28.440]  Joe Biggs has been waiting in the wings he's got a lot of feed from Fox Lake
[54:28.440 --> 54:33.600]  Illinois right now we'll be talking to him briefly in the next hour before Dr.
[54:33.600 --> 54:38.240]  Group joins us for the last half of the transmission from about 12 20 to 2 o'clock
[54:38.240 --> 54:43.360]  today central covering what's even bigger than GMOs what's an even bigger
[54:43.360 --> 54:48.480]  threat on so many fronts but right now let's go to this live feed with Joe
[54:48.480 --> 54:52.640]  Biggs right in front of the podium with the press conference and we might want
[54:52.640 --> 54:58.480]  to go with his video but with mainstream media's audio because that might be a
[54:58.480 --> 55:00.920]  little bit better we can mix those two signals but let's go ahead and go to
[55:00.920 --> 55:04.960]  Joe Biggs feed from where the police officer was executed where the manhunt
[55:04.960 --> 55:09.880]  is ongoing here let's go ahead and go to that feed
[55:25.520 --> 55:29.280]  and again we're looking at mainstream TV or though they're not really carrying
[55:29.280 --> 55:36.280]  I guess only local news stations are
[55:36.280 --> 55:42.800]  reported that the one or two of these individuals had some physical contact
[55:42.800 --> 55:49.560]  with the body of Lieutenant Genovitch my question is did you were you able to get
[55:49.560 --> 55:59.040]  any fingerprints or any DNA from that crime scene I'm not sure what you obtained
[55:59.040 --> 56:02.760]  that information but I can't tell you that our evidence that patients did
[56:02.760 --> 56:07.240]  process the crime scene everything collected at that crime scene has now
[56:07.240 --> 56:12.320]  been turned over to the Norbert Illinois crime labs they're currently expediting
[56:12.320 --> 56:16.920]  processing any type of evidence whether it be fingerprint evidence DNA
[56:16.920 --> 56:25.200]  transfer and we probably won't have those results for what you say whether or not
[56:25.200 --> 56:30.120]  there was a the officer's fire is done and what and can you say what made them
[56:30.120 --> 56:34.520]  suspicious why did you stop them why did you want to stop them again I can't
[56:34.520 --> 56:42.520]  reveal that information related to firing of any weapon as far as I can see I
[56:42.520 --> 56:48.000]  can't speak for the officer whatever the case was
[56:57.120 --> 57:02.400]  how do you look for three suspects with such a scan description again we're
[57:02.400 --> 57:07.480]  gonna rely on information and his process is involved in the initial
[57:07.480 --> 57:13.040]  investigation canvassing talking to people in the area reviewing those videos
[57:13.040 --> 57:17.000]  somebody had asked the question about Joe could ask the question why do they
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.560]  think coordinating the area is gonna stop them how do they know they didn't
[57:20.560 --> 57:42.520]  get out of the area that's right that's what caught their
[57:42.520 --> 57:55.720]  marathon bombing patsy was a citizen not the martial law I haven't talked to Joe
[57:55.720 --> 57:58.240]  yet I don't even know if he got a question in the start of about 20 minutes
[57:58.240 --> 58:15.480]  ago he sent our reporters to most big events now
[58:15.480 --> 58:29.520]  we're gonna go to break but Joe I know you can hear me when we come back in a
[58:29.520 --> 58:35.240]  minute or so try to ask the question do we think this is connected to the call

[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:32.640]  Alex Jones we are covering the Fox Lake police officers death press conference
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:37.600]  that a huge manhunt in around the town searching hundreds and hundreds of
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:44.080]  homes with no leads so far no luck Joe Biggs is trying to get questions in
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.880]  right now let's go back to that live feed
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:01:12.400]  we have investigators following up on
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:27.440]  I like the
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.440]  way to call it
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:02:03.400]  Now, it's a little muddy when the chief officer is speaking, but you can hear the questions
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.240]  being asked. Joe Biggs will be able to upload an HD version later. We're going to go to
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.960]  break here in a few minutes, come back with Joe and get a report from him of what he's
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.520]  witnessed there on the ground. It's always important to have people actually on the ground
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.800]  focusing in, looking at what's happening. But I want to play a clip. I'm going to play
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:26.920]  again when we come back from break and then Lewis Faircon. One more time. This audio is
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:33.280]  up on infowars.com, Kill Whites and Cops, Black Lives Matter Affiliated Radio Show, calls
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:43.280]  for race war. Now they've got this retired jail guard coming out saying he's going to
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:49.080]  hunt down and kill these people that are doing this. I mean, this is already escalating out
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:55.120]  of control. So right now, let's go to that clip from the Black Lives Matter Affiliated
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:00.920]  Radio Show. King Noble, Black Supremacy. And I want to talk about the shooting of the white
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:06.320]  deputy sheriff in Houston, Texas. Reminds me of a Bob Marley song. I shot the sheriff
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:12.320]  to me with the Houston, Texas brutal execution before the public represents to me if it's
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:18.040]  open season on killing whites and white police officers and probably killing cops. Period.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:24.160]  It's open season towards the police department and the police. So now you got some black
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:32.040]  militant or some angry black man walks up and executes a crack of cop in broad daylight.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:38.400]  This is real. It's open season on killing white people and cops. It's unavoidable, inescapable.
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.840]  It's funny that now we're moving to a time where the predator will become the prey.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:48.360]  Yeah, they said there will be a race war and that we cannot win a race war. We can't win.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:52.040]  We're outnumbered. They got weapons. They got drones. They got this. They got that.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:56.840]  But I remind you of the buffaloes who outnumbered the lion. They're bigger than lions and they
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:03.280]  move in larger herd, but they're picked off by lions, one by one by one, picking them
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.160]  off. Today we live in a time where the white man will be picked off and it's nothing he
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.200]  can do about it. His day is up. His time is up. We will witness more executions and killing
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:18.040]  of white people and cops than we ever had before. We see with the Houston, Texas shooting
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:25.480]  and we see with the news reporting shooting in Virginia, it's about to go down. It's open
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:32.720]  season on killing white people and crack us. The Black Lives Matter movement wasn't enough.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.960]  We tried to appeal to them to let them know that this thing would come. It would happen.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.960]  They thought they were indestructible. Oh my goodness. Let's let's back this up and
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.960]  come back and play the whole thing I edited. I'm going to play Lewis Farrakhan. But this
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:50.760]  is just yesterday. This is the response to the dead, dead sheriff's deputy. I mean this
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:57.200]  is so crazy folks to know the White House and George Soros are running this. It's just
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.320]  amazing.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:07.120]  Kill whites and cops. Black Lives Matter affiliated radio show calls for a race war. In a disgusting
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:13.640]  audio broadcast via blog talk radio yesterday, an individual who admitted affiliation with
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:19.400]  the Black Lives Matter movement called for listeners to murder white people and police
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:23.120]  declaring it open season for executions.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:28.160]  Open season on killing white and white police officers. And I want to talk about the shooting
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:33.840]  of the white deputy sheriff in Houston, Texas. Open season on killing white and white police
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:39.880]  officers and probably killing cops period. It's open season picking them all today. We
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:43.320]  live in a time where the white man will be picked off and it's nothing he can do about
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:47.880]  it. His day is up. His time is up. We will witness more executions and killing of white
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.000]  people and cops than we ever have before.

[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:09.360]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Joe Biggs, always
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.640]  the hard charger, said yesterday, I want to go on a plane, go to Chicago, get up there
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:19.360]  to Fox Lake and cover this manhunt with the three men reportedly that gunned down a veteran
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:25.960]  police officer, an army veteran, one black, two white. It was an robbery, was it a criminal
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:32.600]  operation or was it another group wanting to execute police. And we have this new article
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:38.240]  up at infowars.com, fast food worker refuses to serve cop, example of growing animosity
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.960]  towards law enforcement. So another story a few days ago about Chuck E. Cheese, on duty
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:48.480]  cop comes in, they say you can't be in here with a gun on your side. That shows the anti-police
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:54.120]  anti-gun culture, which again is George Soros, White House run. First they train the cops
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:59.600]  to act like thugs, cause a lot of problems and set them up for a fall. And I was playing
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.280]  with chilling Clipper earlier, I'm going to play again in a moment because I didn't play
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:08.080]  all of it, of a Black Lives Matter affiliated group. And it's every major Black Lives Matter
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:13.320]  march I've seen is put wings on pigs, put them in blankets, fry them like bacon, you've
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:19.360]  heard the clips, new clips in Minnesota, new clips in Dallas over the weekend, people saying
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:22.960]  yeah you better watch out deputies, that's what you get when you kill innocent Black
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:28.800]  people. But the point is that's isolated in some departments and most of the cops that
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:33.680]  do it who are in the wrong are getting indicted and going to prison. You don't know some random
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:40.480]  deputy, a pump and gas did Jack squat to you. But it shows how racial it is, well they're
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:45.160]  white, just like this white drug head that went shot to nine Black people, now all these
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:50.600]  white groups are calling for killing Black people and it's so stupid. The race war I
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.880]  will officially say has begun. Now we'll see how serious it gets but it's being driven
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:02.520]  by MTV, I mean they are up in the rhetoric, in the movies, in the culture. Whether the
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:10.360]  stories are true or exaggerated from NWA, it's totally anti-cop and glorifies it. You
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:15.880]  got MTV coming out with all this stuff, you've got you know, slap a heterosexual white man
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:24.760]  at Berkeley. It's just a full on leftist orgy and they want to start a nationwide crisis
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:31.120]  to be able to bring in martial law and they're seriously looking at doing it, it is incredible.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:36.320]  It is just amazing. And then meanwhile any real reform of police departments won't happen,
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:42.640]  we're just going to get globalized and federalized under all this. It's a leftist takeover.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.520]  Let's go to Joe Biggs who was just inside the press conference covering things. We were
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.840]  getting a lot of mindless questions from the press that we were hearing. Joe you've been
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.040]  on the ground a few hours, what have you seen, what's happening?
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:11:00.640]  So far Alex, I'm standing in front of the Fox Lake Police Department here in Illinois.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:06.360]  Now myself and a whole lot of journalists are out here right now. It's essentially a media
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:11.400]  circus followed by a lot of people in the neighborhood, in the town that are coming
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:18.240]  to add stuff to the memorial that they've set up out front. What we know so far is there
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.720]  are some conflicting reports with whether or not the weapon of the police officer was
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:27.640]  found at the scene and or if it was taken by the three suspects. So that's still circling
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:32.720]  around. The cops would not confirm or deny whether or not that was going on. But someone
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:38.080]  on the inside did ask a question. They got a tip saying that there was some DNA found
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:43.320]  at the crime scene and that does seem to be the case on at least one of the suspects that
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:48.320]  has been sent to a crime lab and that is being tested. They're expected for that to come back
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:53.400]  in the next day or so. So right now what they've done is they've suspended the search in this
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:59.000]  area locally. There was a two mile radius around the Fox Lake area. That search has been suspended.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.480]  They feel like they've exhausted every ounce of looking in this area. They believe that
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:09.720]  these people have not, they're not in this area anymore. Now over this way across me
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:15.280]  right down from the police department a mile away is a train track area along the marsh
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.640]  where the police officer was killed. And they believe it's possible that the suspects could
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:24.120]  have possibly jumped on a train passing by and maybe got out of town that way. So what
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.600]  they've done is they've expanded the search out. They're only calling it canvassing here
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:34.040]  locally but they've expanded out with the help of the DEA, ATF, FBI, or not the DEA
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:39.840]  but the ATF and the FBI, the U.S. Marshals and some more officers around the surrounding
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.920]  area. But they've pushed out further. So you're not seeing that door to door search like we
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:48.960]  saw on photographs yesterday in videos. I haven't seen a helicopter yet thus far but
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.000]  I did hear one off in the distance earlier. So I'm going to follow some leads and what
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.800]  I would like for people to do Alex is if you live in this area, you see where a lot of
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:01.240]  the police are searching. If you could send us in an email to show tips and put my name
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.680]  in the title so I know to look for that when I go through there so I can try to follow
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.360]  some of these leads and see where the police are looking for these three cop killers.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.760]  And give folks, the listeners, we have a lot of listeners there who've even called in and
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:19.160]  been on there yesterday that live in that town and surrounding areas. Maybe our listeners
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:23.240]  can help find these guys. We have them in every town, every city listening on shortwave
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:29.640]  internet. We also have two affiliates in the Chicago area, both AM. What can people do?
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:35.920]  Can they hit you at your Twitter Joe to get you live up to date photos or links or map
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:41.000]  coordinates? Yeah, of course, Alex. That'd be a great idea. Right now I'm out here. I've
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.040]  got my vehicle as soon as we're done here. I'm going to start chasing leads. So if you're
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:48.720]  out here and you live in this area in the surrounding area and you've you've know something
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:53.680]  find me on Twitter at Rambo bigs and send me your pictures, your updates. If you've seen
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:57.000]  the police searching around, if they've come to your house and asked for anything, what's
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.760]  so every kind of information, anything will help out at this point in time because most
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.520]  of the journals here are going to stay in this little media area. Like always, I like
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:08.240]  to get out and venture and actually go door to door. Stay up there. Stay up there today
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.360]  or tomorrow or as long as you think you need to but exactly get out there and try to hunt
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.280]  these guys down, try to follow the police, see what they're on, try to talk to some of
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:21.280]  the police when they're on break in a restaurant or whatever. And let's see if our listeners
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.440]  can hopefully give us some tips to try to track down where they're at. That mean doesn't
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.200]  mean we're going to do it. But if everybody tries to keep a lookout, they may be able
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:34.440]  to do it. See, we're all for looking for bad guys. Once a crime is committed in a police
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:38.360]  state, you look at it before it's committed. No, that's not how we operate. Once it's been
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:43.280]  committed though, we are after it. If you see folks online calling for killing black
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:49.560]  people or calling for killing white people, send us tips at showtipsandinfowars.com because
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.920]  we're going to be on top of it trying to stop George Soros, the Nazi collaborator scumbag
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.760]  and Obama, the piece of filth trash and the Clintons and all of these criminals from starting
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:03.480]  a giant race war, Joe Biggs. Joe, it's getting really transparent. Have you heard the new
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:08.160]  Black Lives Matter affiliated popular radio show calling for killing more police and white
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.240]  people? Yeah, I just heard the audio clip you're playing previously, Alex. And I also
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:17.760]  heard about the, uh, there's a lady in Texas. She goes by sunshine and she also has a lot
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.680]  of hate filled messages that she pushes out as well. She was outside protesting the, uh,
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:27.280]  at the jail cell where Sandra Bland, uh, died. So she was one of the ones out there calling
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.480]  for the, you know, the death of whites. And I mean, Sandra Bland said she was going to
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:35.920]  commit suicide in videos and told people. Well, I mean, and just like the rhetoric being
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:39.240]  spewed by Black Lives Matter, the whole hands up, don't shoot thing. We know that that's
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:44.240]  a lie based on, uh, information that's been given through even black witnesses who were
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:48.040]  there as well, who saw it out there in Ferguson. Meanwhile, we have a Hispanic man shot by
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:52.560]  another Hispanic, cold blooded murders. What it looks like in San Antonio and the police
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:57.280]  are trying to cover that up right now. Very shameful. But again, it's just crazy cops killing
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:03.040]  people. It's not racially based in most cases. The statistics show that. Yeah, exactly. And
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:12.280]  and I don't think that this case right here exactly at this police officer just happened
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:16.920]  to pull over what he saw as to be three suspicious suspects and then it just escalated out of
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:22.840]  control. I think it was a, uh, something that just happened. I don't think this was planned
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:26.520]  in any kind of way and based off what I've heard thus far, I don't think you think that
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:30.800]  either, but it's, but it's definitely happened because we had the police officer in Abilene
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.600]  who was found murdered in his home. So there's definitely that going on. So you can tell
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:37.480]  that these people are going to be looking over their shoulders. You're going to start
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.840]  seeing more cops riding together in vehicles versus being alone. You're going to see more
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:45.640]  pairings of them. And this is what happens. You know, they think they're doing the right
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:49.520]  thing by going out and killing these cops, but all they're doing is going against the
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:52.720]  entire thing they're trying to get rid of, which is the police brutality. They're angry
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:57.240]  because they're saying that white cops are killing black, uh, you know, unarmed men,
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:00.840]  but now all they're doing is they're going to militarize the police more. Once cops will
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:04.440]  threaten to a point where they can't safely go out and patrol, what's going to happen?
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:07.440]  You're going to get MRAPS. You're going to get the tanks on the road. You're going to
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.440]  get AR 15.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:12.440]  And the police are going to stop responding to crime period. And you're going to get that
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:16.400]  happen. I guarantee you Alex, you're going to get to one point in time where a lot of
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:20.120]  police are going to say, you know what, I give up, it's not worth me dying anymore.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.200]  You're going to have total and complete chaos.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.000]  And you have the left trying to take citizens guns that will cause even more chaos. It's
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.920]  operation chaos. Remember I called it operation chaos a month ago, so they're launching a
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:36.560]  race war, stop operation chaos. Here it is. I can't believe what's actually happening.
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.720]  Joe, get out there, follow your reports, upload them to YouTube. We'll cover them. If there's
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:44.240]  anything else breaking, we'll talk to you again the next hour. Great job.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.360]  Thank you, Alex for having me.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:50.200]  Thank you. Let's play Lewis Faircon right now. And then when we come back, I'm going to
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.880]  play the other clip and go to Dr. Groot. But let's play Lewis Faircon a month ago saying
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:00.000]  go out and kill people. And then now you got all these groups echoing that and it's starting.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.120]  And all that does is legitimize attacks on innocent people on both sides. It's just totally
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.120]  wrong.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:10.800]  How about all lives matter? I mean, it's really just that simple. Let's go to the second
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:23.000]  running clip. So if the federal government will not intercede in our affairs, then we
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:36.160]  must rise up and kill those who kill us. Stop them and kill them and let them feel the pain
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:50.120]  of death that we don't feel. It's a total setup. And I get people wanting to fight back, but
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:56.200]  when the globalist wind us up to do it, I mean, the whole thing's a setup. George Soros
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:01.160]  just pulled this off in Ukraine two years ago, funding the radical right wing to overthrow
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:09.840]  the government. It's just bizarre to see this over and over again. Dr. Groot is coming
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:15.800]  up at the bottom of the hour. I'll be with us for a full hour and a half today in studio.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:20.840]  When I come back, I'm going to play more of the actual clip that's up on info wars.com,
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:25.640]  kill whites and cops, black lives matter, affiliated radio show, calls for race war.
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:32.120]  And then that ties into everything else that's happening. Video shows officers ignoring man
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:38.320]  and diabetic distress. He dies in jail 15 hours after arrest. That's what's barbarous
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:43.680]  is that lives don't matter. Babies. Veterans don't matter. Cops don't matter. Blacks don't
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:49.680]  matter. Diabetics don't matter. Nobody matters. We need to start caring about justice and
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:55.680]  standing up for all lives, not being played selectively by the race, baiting, democratic,
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:59.280]  Ku Klux Klan party. We'll be back.

[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  The truth is there's injustice in every country. The truth is Americans have a lot of problems.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  And everybody that knows I've been on 20 years of radio, I've stood against some of the mandatory
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  minimum sentences for black people. The fact that black folks have had drugs shipped in
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:25.440]  their neighborhoods, criminal elements of the CIA. I mean we've been pioneers of exposing
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:46.000]  that because I want justice. But the mainstream media and the Democratic party put in chips
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.080]  on people's shoulders using examples to hype everybody up like they're personally having
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:57.200]  their mom or their daddy killed, pushing this whole gangbanger culture, tying it into attacking
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:04.200]  the police. It's evil. And then when Lewis Farrakhan and other groups call for going
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:13.920]  after police and white people, I mean I'm white. I'm part Native American too. And I've got
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:22.360]  white children. And it's no crime of me that I was attracted to a white woman and had children.
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:28.440]  I don't tell folks how to live their lives. And it's bigoted to say white people are the
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.440]  problem go after them. I mean that's fundamental. But then when violence is called for, it's
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:37.920]  illegal. And I just wanted on record that it's the left and the groups they control
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:43.080]  calling for violence and destabilizing things and trying to shut down the economy and raising
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:47.760]  our power prices so folks go bankrupt, so jobs shut down. They want to break this country's
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:54.760]  back. This nation is under classical economic and cultural siege. And the arrogant people
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:00.400]  that are probably working for the feds, if they aren't, they got screwed over by the
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.600]  cops when they were a kid or some racist. And now they project it on everybody. I mean
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:08.760]  I had bad cops when I was growing up. I had black people that were racist against me when
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:14.480]  I was growing up and I was sophisticated enough to not hate all cops or all black people.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:18.240]  And so it's really just a bunch of babies that like to play the part of victims and
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:24.000]  think they're going to be big, tough honchos out in some race war. If a real race war starts
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.680]  in this country, it's not going to be pretty for quote, either side. But if you look at
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:35.080]  the historical lines and armaments and the way things are broken down, two different
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:39.400]  groups can play at the game of going and picking people off. This guy talks about, we're going
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:46.400]  to go pick you off one at a time like the lions pick off the, I guess he thinks Wilderbeesh,
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:53.560]  the lions don't go pick off water buffaloes. Water buffaloes kill more people, probably
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:58.760]  anything in Africa. They're more vicious than a lion. So are hippopotamus. This just shows
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:03.040]  this guy's ignorance and he calls himself the king, the lord. It's all part of this
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:09.480]  narcissistic, sick hip hop culture. Let's go ahead and play the sickening clip.
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:14.240]  King noble black supremacy. And I want to talk about the shooting of the white deputy
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:19.360]  sheriff in Houston, Texas. Remind me of Bob Marley song. I shot the sheriff to me with
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:25.240]  the Houston, Texas brutal execution before the public represents to me if it's open
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:30.480]  season on killing whites and white police officers and probably killing cops period
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:36.740]  is open season towards the police department and the police. So now you got some black
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:43.740]  militant or some angry black man walks up and executes a crack of cop in broad daylight.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:50.600]  This is real. It's open season on killing white people and cops is unavoidable, inescapable.
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:56.040]  It's funny that now we're moving to a time where the predator will become the prey. Yes,
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:00.920]  they said there will be a race war and that we cannot win a race war. We can't win. We're
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:05.160]  outnumbered. They got weapons. They got drones. They got this. They got that. But I remind
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:09.720]  you of the buffaloes who outnumbered the lion. They're bigger than lions and they move in
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:16.720]  larger herd, but they're picked off by lions one by one by one picking them off. Today
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:20.000]  we live in a time where the white man will be picked off and it's nothing he can do
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.760]  about it. His day is up. His time is up. We will witness more executions and killing
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:30.720]  white people and cops than we ever had before. We see with the Houston, Texas shooting and
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:37.720]  we see with the news reporting shooting in Virginia. It's about to go down. It's open
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  season on killing white people and crack us. The Black Lives Matter movement wasn't enough.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:49.040]  We tried to appeal to them to let them know that this type of thing would come. It would
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:53.000]  happen. They thought they were indestructible and invincible because they took advantage
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.240]  of the weakness of black people for too long with all this police brutality.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.000]  All right, that's enough. And now they've got...
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.240]  You know, I had David Duke on the show and he had the courage to come on. I'm going to
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:08.120]  challenge King Noble, Supremo, Grand, whatever his name is. I was making fun of the Klan for
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:14.240]  all their pimp names and this guy's got a pimp name as well. This is ridiculous. You're
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:19.480]  a grand jackass is what you are, King Noble. And I want to challenge this guy. He uses
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:24.440]  his real name and come on this show and spout all his bull here. Because I want to try to
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:28.000]  explain some things to him. I'd have a little more respect if he was saying don't abort
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.520]  your babies or if he was saying don't take Gardasil or don't drink fluoride water. That's
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:38.280]  where the real kill is going on, dummy. And it's happening to everybody. But instead,
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:43.440]  you want to sit there and have the media use the few bad examples out of 330 million people
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:47.960]  that cause a race war. Do you have any idea what's going to happen if a real war starts,
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:48.960]  dummy?
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:52.360]  Number one, people are going to come after you. Number one, you're not going to just
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:30:19.680]  be some big mouth hiding on the Internet. We'll be right back.
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:25.520]  Claring it. Open season for executions. Open season on killing whites and white police
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:31.160]  officers. And I want to talk about the shooting of the white deputy sheriff in Houston, Texas.
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:36.920]  Open season on killing whites and white police officers and probably killing cops period.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:41.400]  It's open season picking them off today. We live in a time where the white man will be
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:46.280]  picked off and it's nothing he can do about it. His day is up. His time is up. We'll witness
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:51.080]  more executions and killing of white people and cops than we ever have before.

[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:52.840]  Tell me, I'm going to defend myself. I don't care who they are, but that's a justified
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:58.680]  defense. That's not shooting a cop, pumping gas. A Dr. Edward Group, good friend of mine,
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:04.280]  one of the top supplement formulators in the country as well, joins us for the next hour
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:08.160]  and a half while I open phones in the next hour. For us, Dr. Group will also cover the
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:14.280]  waterfront with him. For two months, it's been sold out. He wanted me to order a whole
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:19.280]  bunch. It took him years to formulate it and I was like, no, we don't need that many bottles.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.960]  Okay, you say it's the greatest cleanse ever and it'll just pull all this stuff out of
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:29.400]  the body and it can be integrated in with apple cider vinegar and other things. And
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:34.120]  then I guess the foodies and the supplement experts looked at it and they went, oh my
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.880]  gosh, this is a game changer. It's sold out in three days. We've never had a new product
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:41.720]  sold out in three days. It's sold out in a week before. It took two plus months to get
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:46.320]  it in and unfortunately he's expanded his factories, his laboratories, but the standards
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:51.520]  are so high. It's another limited run, but more is coming within like two, three weeks.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:55.200]  So if you want to get deep cleanse, in fact, I forgot to ask Anthony for some of the reviews.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:35:02.920]  Those have poured in. It's got a 4.8 on average of total five, unprecedented by power reviews,
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:07.520]  deep cleanse. Now he didn't come here to talk about deep cleanse. We had him coming in and
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:16.840]  set up a week ago, but he's here now and we really appreciate Dr. Edward group coming
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:23.840]  in. So we're going to get into what is the ultimate threat even beyond GMO, beyond pesticides,
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:27.840]  herbicides. And when he brought this up to me about a week ago, I said, absolutely. I
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:32.040]  see that here and there in medical journals and scientific journals in the news and it's
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:39.480]  so creepy. So we're going to be breaking down the number one threat beyond GMO that they're
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:43.800]  pretty much, you know, focusing on only we're having some victories on. They've already moved
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:47.600]  on. It's kind of like Planned Parenthood new videos out today that we played last hour
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:51.680]  where they go, you know what we did? We got them to think they were banning, you know,
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:56.800]  selling baby parts, but really we said embryonic. Well, that's only a few weeks. That's tiny.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:01.280]  Then we can sell all the babies because we call them fetuses. But once they're born,
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:05.400]  we can't. Once they're delivered, they're called a baby. They talk about, you know,
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:09.400]  trying to keep them, you know, up against mom while they get the organs and stuff because
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:13.600]  then they have rights once they're not touching mom. That's the federal law. So it's all very,
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:19.760]  very macabre new Planned Parenthood video. Sometimes in tech fetuses just fell out and
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:28.760]  they didn't get sent to the infirmary with the premies they got sent to Mingola. So how
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:35.200]  about all lives matter? While these total innocence per capita black people, you're not hearing
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:38.800]  one word about that from black lives matter because they're Democrat run. They're George
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:44.400]  Soros run. They want blacks absolutely hated. Only friend they got the Democrat system and
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:48.840]  welfare. They're everybody else scared. And they're giving them the horrible curse now
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:53.160]  of winding up some stupid black people to go out and kill white people. And then stupid
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:57.160]  white people are going to go out and kill them. And then they get to have a civil emergency.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:01.040]  The average cop in part of this, but the police need to speak out before this unfold. So we're
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:07.040]  going to briefly break down before we get into the news, why deep cleanse is so important
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:12.280]  at infowarslife.com with Dr. Group. Then we're getting into the big enchilada here. So many
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:16.600]  people are tuning in to hear about today. I just saw massive activity even on Facebook
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:20.200]  today about you and this announcement and you telling your listeners and people and
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:24.000]  your supporters that you'd be really revealing some big stuff that's, that's hiding in plain
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.760]  view, but nevertheless hasn't gotten the attention it needs. But first you were former army special
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:32.920]  operations guy yourself before you went off and got your different degrees and decided
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:38.560]  to fight the medical tyranny. But just as an American as a patriot, as I know a guy that
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:44.200]  I'd call classical liberal that loves everybody. Do you agree or disagree with me that they're
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:47.360]  trying to orchestrate an all out race war? I mean, I knew they were doing it, but it's
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:51.520]  one thing to know it. It looks like they've pretty much ignited it now. And I can just
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:58.680]  see mentally ill upset right wing white people loading their weapons right now. I guarantee
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:03.240]  you it's, they're loading them up right now and planning to strike back. And when they
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:07.200]  go out and kill a bunch of black people, and I think it's going to be just historically
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:14.680]  very vicious because culturally generally Anglo-Saxon culture doesn't strike out a lot.
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:19.040]  If it does, it's usually sustained vicious and ongoing. That's just well known even
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:25.040]  in criminology. I'm really concerned. Do not engage in violence. Do not strike back even
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:30.320]  at the thugs, the racist thugs that are calling to kill white people. Do not and police do
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:34.480]  not be part of it. And anyways, I think I just answered my question. You said a year
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:37.700]  ago you had a bad feeling. Six months ago you said it was over the top. Me too. Everybody
[01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:42.760]  else feels it. Economic meltdowns begun. Race wars begun. They're destabilizing other countries
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:46.800]  playing groups off against each other, whatever the cultural differences are. Are we really
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:52.080]  dominant to do this? And are we reaching this critical moment? I think we've already passed
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:57.080]  into the event horizon. I think we're inside the meltdown. What does the doctor group think?
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:01.200]  Just from your military background, your cultural background, what do you think about the point
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.200]  we've reached?
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:09.840]  Well, I agree with you. I think we've reached a critical point in time right now. Not only
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:19.440]  with healthcare, oil and gas, resources, geo-engineering, race wars being generated, negative media, creation
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:28.480]  of fear. I mean, it's just all culminating right now. It's just fear-based end of the
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:35.520]  world stuff, which really reduces the immune system by 50%. And if you look at the effects
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:41.320]  of all this stuff, how is this, all of this stuff combined, how is that going to affect
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:45.760]  the individual person? Or how is that going to affect society as a whole? And what we're
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:50.800]  seeing now is we're seeing everybody walking around in a state of fear. People are confused.
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:54.000]  People don't know what's going on. They're seeing the stock market go up and then all
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.800]  of a sudden crack down again and then up again and artificially inflated. You know, these
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:04.720]  are some times I think that if you pay attention to what's going on in the world and if you
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:11.880]  pay attention to what's going on in all the factions, which are the pharmaceutical companies,
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:19.080]  the news media, the presidential elections, the race wars, all this stuff. I mean, personally
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:26.160]  to me is there's a lot of diversions going on. And that means that something usually
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:27.160]  is brewing up.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:28.160]  Even bigger.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.160]  Yeah.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:32.680]  Probably war with Russia or something along those lines or huge tectonic events. They
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:37.120]  admit the whole Pacific Rim is about to go up. But here's the deal. We are in a time
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:42.080]  of massive change. The globalists know that. So we're not creating fear. We're explaining
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:45.120]  people what's behind it so they can get prepared and understand.
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:51.320]  Right. Exactly. That's our purpose. You have to, in order to come up with solutions to
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:56.280]  these things and to not be in fear, you have to be comfortable and you have to understand
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:02.240]  what's going on. I feel sorry for all the people that watch MSNBC and Fox News and CNN
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:09.480]  out there that are just hearing this diversion information out there, the non-truth, but
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:14.720]  also feel really good and blessed to be part of coming on here and sharing information
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.360]  with all of your followers.
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.520]  We're blessed to have you as well.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:22.520]  That they know the truth and we're giving them solutions to not only change the way
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:26.680]  they think, the way they feel, but also giving them real time solutions on what to look out
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:31.040]  for and giving them warnings to what not to pay attention to.
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:35.520]  What do you think this next big shoot-a-drop is going to be? Because all Hades is breaking
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:39.160]  loose on every front. No, I mean, most of the world's in depression and warfare and
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:47.600]  this crazy town. The government's digging in, gearing up. What do you think it is?
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:54.560]  I really don't know what it is because I'm keeping myself, trying to keep myself really
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:42:02.240]  calm, eating healthy. I'm trying to meditate a lot more, spend time in prayer. I don't
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:05.800]  know. It's almost like whatever's going to happen is going to happen. I know there's
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:10.560]  a lot of good forces at work. There's also a lot of negative forces at work. I think
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:14.280]  that we're definitely going to see things that we've never seen before.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:16.080]  The Pope's endorsing abortion, basically.
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:20.360]  Yeah, I mean, it's just one thing after another. Every single day there's something that comes
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:26.400]  out now that you just cannot believe is on the news or you cannot believe is happening.
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:31.600]  At the same time, I think people are waking up. I mean, I wish I knew what was going to
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.600]  happen.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:37.080]  Exactly. How bold is it, though, that the White House and George Soros openly fund
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:42.080]  groups saying go out and murder white people and police? I mean, that is so criminal. I
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.800]  just can't believe they're that bold.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:52.840]  Yeah, I mean, right now, it's just like, let's just tell everybody what we're going to do.
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:58.320]  They're getting bolder and bolder and bolder because nobody's doing anything about it.
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:03.520]  We are making some progress on a lot of different fronts, but still, they're on top running
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:07.360]  the show at the top. It's almost like we're awake, but we just know we're slaves now.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:12.440]  Right. Either that or they know what's coming and all the underground bunkers and they're
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:14.160]  making preparations.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:18.160]  I got a big article at an RT about the Hadron Collider with even Hawking admitting it's
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:19.160]  dangerous.
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:20.160]  Right.
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.600]  I mean, it's just what I mean. Just everything seems to be activating right now. You could
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:27.640]  feel it. You could see it. And all I want to do is try to have peace and have people
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:33.920]  live in peace and have prosperity. But there is a force. Evil's activating is what's happening.
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:39.240]  Evil's making its move. That's the big event. I mean, I think behind all of this, evil's
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:42.560]  making its move because it knows the awakenings happen.
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.400]  That's right.
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:48.880]  And that just really just came out of my heart right there. I was beyond chills. I was on
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:51.080]  fire when I said that. But that's it.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.080]  I know.
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.080]  That's it.
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:54.720]  That's exactly what it is. The awakening is happening.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:56.680]  And so evil's making its move.
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:01.320]  And evil's making its move. I mean, we talked about it last time. I mean, this is serious
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:06.320]  stuff in CERN with this collider. I mean, we're talking about opening up another dimensional.
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.720]  We're talking about opening a portal.
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:13.000]  It's in RT. Stephen Hawking says it will open another portal. And we don't know what's
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  in the other dimension.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  That's right. We could just...
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.920]  A lot of them think it could cause chain reaction explosions. It'll be like any matter.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:22.720]  They open a portal to any matter, which is a lot of physicists think. It's a chain reaction.
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:28.580]  They're trying to disprove the Big Bang theory. They're creating the God particle. So, I mean,
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:34.920]  if they're saying that the God particle created the Big Bang, then there's a possibility of
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:39.720]  when they fire up the reactor that it could create major explosion.
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:42.720]  It's the biggest machine in the world. But meanwhile, let's just kill each other over
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:46.800]  skin color. That's what really matters. I mean, I want to grab these Black Lives Matter
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:51.480]  people and slap them in the face and say, do you understand that they're targeting Black
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:55.520]  people for extermination via abortion? Why don't you go say something about that? You
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:45:02.480]  little scumbag. But they won't do that because they're Democrat run. I'm sorry for ranting.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:07.200]  I want to get into more of the madness, the biggest current threat that we know is going
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:12.440]  on in our food, in our water, and in also packaging. Because it's everywhere. It's something
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:16.040]  we haven't covered enough. I've been aware of it. I've mentioned it some, but we're
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:19.320]  going to do a detailed breakdown of this for about 20 minutes to the next hour and then
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:23.200]  take your calls, questions for Dr. Gritt. But before we do that, let's do a plug for
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:26.280]  Deep Cleanse. You did a great one last time you were here. Sold out, like I said, in less
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:31.240]  than... It was about two and a half days. I've done the Deep Cleanse. Even more stuff
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:37.640]  came out of my skin. Just so healthy. So much energy. Tell folks what's in Deep Cleanse
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:42.240]  and why it's so important and what it does. The latest product at infowarslife.com. It's
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.240]  back in stock, folks.
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:49.200]  Well, I'll tell you what. It's been a long time in the making and we talk about the contamination
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:53.480]  of toxins coming in the body on a regular basis. And today, we're going to be talking
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:46:00.000]  about nanotechnology and nanomaterials, basically engineering nanomaterials. And there's not
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.760]  too... It's already in the food. It's already in the food. And I tell you, this was brought
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:09.280]  to my attention. I've known about it too for a while, but I didn't know the scale of what's
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:13.760]  been going on because there's really not a lot of information out there on it. And there's
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:18.720]  absolutely zero regulations. And I feel after doing the research that I've done over the
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:25.880]  past couple weeks that the whole GMO labeling issue is great. We've come together on that.
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:33.000]  But at the same time, I think that all the attention has been brought on the GMO issue
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:39.880]  and people don't even know about the engineering nanoparticle technology that's being used
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:45.640]  in foods. And that's why deep cleanse also is so important because there's not too many
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:50.880]  things that can eliminate or grab nanoparticles. And when we talk about some of these sources...
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:55.760]  We're talking about packaging that's in the Oreo cookies. We just showed a news article.
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:00.560]  Where it's artificially created matter is being put into the flavoring, the packaging to keep
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:05.440]  it static free. I mean, there's no telling. Notice allergies are exploding. And it's because
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:06.440]  of stuff like this.
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:10.720]  That's right. If anyone remembers Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, this is another
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:16.600]  prime example of them introducing something before it comes out. Well, Willy Wonka had
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:20.680]  all these specialty foods, even had that magic gum where you eat and all of a sudden you
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:25.800]  have a tomato soup in your mouth and then you have roast beef in your mouth. And it goes
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:30.240]  through ice cream and blueberry pie. And the little girl ate it and she turned into this,
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:31.240]  you know, this big blueberry.
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:33.200]  And he says that's a side effect.
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:39.040]  That is basically, they introduced this nano food technology back in the Willy Wonka days.
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:44.680]  So that's exactly what this is designed to do. And not only that, Kraft Foods has been
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:54.000]  working with nano food engineering to where it's activated with a microwave pulse machine.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.480]  So in other words, you're going to eat something or activate it with a microwave pulse and
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:03.920]  it can take you through flavor profiles. Or, and even they're working on drinks right
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:07.960]  now to where you get a clear liquid and you can pretty much decide what flavor and what
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:08.960]  color.
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:13.400]  And people say, oh, I love this gum. It lasts for five hours. Yes. But it's totally artificial.
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:14.400]  Right.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:17.960]  And that's why they had aspartame to every major gum line out there. Because yeah, it
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:22.080]  lasts for 20 minutes instead of 30 seconds, but it's totally toxic.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:27.080]  It's programmable food when you take the, the basic structure. So instead of
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:28.080]  Smart food.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:32.040]  It's smart food. It's just like anything was smart in front of it. You have to immediately
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:36.560]  throw up a red flag, like the smart meters. They can monitor you. They can put, it's they
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:39.520]  can tell folks what's in deep cleansers. We're going to come back and break down all this.
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:42.600]  I know you're hot to get into it, but tell folks what's in deep cleanse because that's
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:43.600]  what's so exciting.
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:46.920]  The main ingredient that I love, I mean, it's thick. It's oily. This is not your regular
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:51.560]  cleanse called Shilajit and Shilajit comes from the Himalayan mountains. It's a very
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:57.760]  clean source and it's really high in fulvic and humic acid. It contains over 80 something
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:05.440]  minerals. So Shilajit is a highly effective at detoxifying and remineralizing the body.
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:08.920]  We couldn't put this out for a while because we couldn't get the organic source from the
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:09.920]  Himalayas.
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:11.440]  Yes. We finally got it again.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:17.000]  It's almost like the iodine. It's a very unique product. It, it's really the decomposition
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:23.480]  of up to 7,000 plants that decompose over a long period of time. And the mountain pressurizes
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:27.920]  this stuff and it leaks down in and during the summertime in the Himalayan mountains,
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:32.880]  they compress and this black ooze comes out of the rock. And that's what the Shilajit
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:33.880]  is.
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:36.040]  And then we can press it again and concentrate it.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:40.200]  That's right. With our process, we concentrate it, but we also have the zeolites in here
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:46.240]  and zeolites are the only compound known that will absorb nanoparticles. I didn't realize
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:52.240]  how big of an issue this is, but not only nanoparticles, different types of toxic manmade
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:59.000]  chemicals, stalates, all this stuff. What I tried to do with deep cleanse was put a lymphatic
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.960]  cleansing herb in there, put a liver cleansing herb in there, a blood cleansing herb in there,
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.440]  a chemical by a couple of different ingredients in there that should have called the total
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:11.400]  cleanse, but deep cleanse is a good name.
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.760]  Deep cleanse because it's really has to go deep into the cells. And that's another thing
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:20.840]  with these, these nanoparticles, they actually go through the cell wall and we'll talk a
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:26.480]  little bit about that later. But that's why it's so important to utilize cleansing on
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:32.080]  a regular basis and make sure you're eating the proper foods, repair your liver, cleanse
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:36.560]  your blood, all that stuff so you can have the strong body you need moving forward.
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:44.840]  Go to infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139. Dr. Group is our guest. I see you're looking
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:51.320]  for the camera. The camera here on spot. 800-259-9231. It's like being interrogated here with
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:52.320]  the lights.
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:53.720]  Well usually you have the red light on over there.
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:57.840]  Absolutely. Something's different today. We'll be back. Deep cleanse now available. Thanks
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:58.840]  for the support.
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:03.920]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our U.S. politicians
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:08.040]  argue from banning Americans from owning body armor. Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:14.320]  Barm your American body at infidelbodyarmor.com. Infidel body armor. Just won't quit.

[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:32.640]  You're old enough to tell that something is definitely wrong. You've been paying attention
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:37.440]  for years and you're ready. You're probably frustrated because your children don't listen
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:41.440]  to your words of warning. What will you do when your grandkids show up hungry at your

[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:38.400]  He was coming to shoot me down. He wasn't pumping gas. I shot the sheriff. But I didn't
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:48.640]  shoot the deputy. All right. We're going to start the next hour and really plow through
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:54.000]  nanotech and what it's doing if you're a new listener. We have produced a game-changing
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  two-thirds of the InfoWars live products Dr. Grips developed and manufactured or helped
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.480]  us work with the top laboratories in the country. We go put out a colloidal silver. We can
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:08.680]  sell with him or we go and we put out one of our other products. We can sell with him.
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:12.520]  But a lot of the products he himself puts out and some of the products he doppled gangs
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:16.960]  and puts out through his company Global Healing Center. Not deep cleanse. This is totally
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:23.240]  proprietary to InfoWarsLife.com. One of the other products that obviously he invented
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:27.520]  over a decade ago that's used in Hollywood and written up in national news is oxy powder.
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:32.400]  What a game changer. Everybody gives this five-star reviews I've seen. You take this
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:36.560]  for six days at night flushes out your upper and lower intestine unlike anything I've ever
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:43.840]  seen. It is simply amazing. Rob doing one week lost 12 pounds. He's not in bad shape.
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:47.520]  He plays basketball. He was he had a scholarship for basketball, you know, in college. He's
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:52.280]  a good basketball player. He's on, you know, 6'4". And he says he feels like he's a young
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:57.240]  man again with super mill vitality, the X2 and the oxy powder. He hadn't done the deep
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:02.000]  cleanse yet. I have and it's simply amazing with my lifestyle what it's done. InfoWars
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.520] Life.com or 888-253-3139. And before you go today, I'll read a few reviews and go through
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:11.720]  all the ingredients in it. But stopping there, give us in the four minutes we have left a
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:17.160]  little preview of what is a bigger threat than even GMO, the next level and how prolific
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:21.640]  this is. Nanotech on our food. Tell us about this so-called science.
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:28.360]  Well, it's called ENMs, engineered nano materials.
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:32.160]  Oh, yummy. And basically, the way that the big companies
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:41.600]  are looking at this is they can use these nanoparticles to incorporate flavors, compounds,
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:48.760]  basically anything. Plastic, phthalates, metals to use for flavor enhancement, to use
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:58.200]  for beverages. So in other words, you can modify food or for that matter even create
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:03.400]  man-made foods. It's kind of a whole other level than genetically modified foods because
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:11.840]  let's say with nanoparticles you can take the actual carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:17.440]  put it together to where you can create a food molecularly because it's working on the atomic
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:22.240]  and the molecular structure without having to grow it. In other words, you can do it
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:25.280]  without sunlight, without soil and without water.
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:30.000]  How loving. What's scary for me is reading over this,
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.120]  they even admit, you're showing mainstream articles about it, that there's regulations
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:38.280]  on GMO, some on other things. This, there's nothing. They don't even do studies. They
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:41.680]  don't even know what it's going to do. That's the scary part because there's
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:48.840]  zero FDA oversight, there's zero USDA oversight. Imagine what these big eugenics-based companies
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:53.040]  are going to piggyback and trojan horse. Every other smart thing they put out really
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:56.240]  has another agenda. What could the agenda be here?
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:03.440]  Well I have right here from BioBased US that BASF is using it. They're trying to get a
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:11.280]  patent filed right now and it says it is more stable and the killing capacity of the chemical,
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:15.480]  the herbicide, insecticide, or fungicide is optimized. So not only-
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:18.960]  Another coming out with a nanotech fertilizer.
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:26.680]  Like fertilizers and pesticides and get this, Syngenta actually has a product that is available
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:34.000]  right now is a nanoparticle formula to grow food in a drought resistant or a drought-
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.480]  Oh they're chemtrailing. Oh and don't worry, I'm sure they're going to have nanotech baby
[01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:41.960]  milk. Your baby will die but it's loving. No man, it's like now they admit the premies
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:44.600]  are all dying and getting the vaccines. They just go, fine, we're going to kill them.
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:52.320]  We'll be back. Introducing secret 12, the new InfoWars Life
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:58.840]  Vitamin B12 formulation. Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimentical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme

[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:20.440]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:21.440]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:31.640]  By the way, we had a call yesterday that mentioned some of his family had a preemie baby. I think
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:36.920]  he said six plus months. It was fine. But they gave the baby the inoculations as they
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:42.760]  do a few hours after birth and the baby quit breathing and died. And we've had whistleblower
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:46.960]  nurses on about how they say, all right, we're being ordered to inoculate all these preemies.
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:50.560]  Get ready with the respirators, get ready with the defibrillators, and get ready for
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:58.640]  death. And they go in, they follow orders, they salute, and the injectors go. This is
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:04.640]  the scientific packaging of slow death, soft kill. Just kidding, it's used to, oh, you
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:11.760]  know, one in 50 with autism. Now, one in three, they say about 2025. And it's all just done.
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:15.240]  And the nurses, the doctors, they're compartmentalized. They don't know what's going on. After a while,
[02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:19.520]  they go, everybody dies when we do this. Or they almost die. Maybe we should stop this.
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:23.080]  Well, David Knight did an investigative report with a whistleblower about six months ago.
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:29.320]  I thought we should re-air that today in the fourth hour when Rob Dube and others host
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:34.720]  the fourth hour today. They should re-air that and tie it in, you know, new Planned Parenthood
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:39.080]  video shows after birth abortion. Because they're not just getting the babies in the
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:43.880]  womb now, they're getting them with the vaccines. And so if people have a premium, they're
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:48.200]  planning to kill your kid. And we're not joking with rhetoric. Just like we told you they
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:52.520]  sell their baby parts 20 years ago. And I told you, they hold the baby up against the
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:56.480]  woman while they dissect it. They try to drug her because legally they can get felonies
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:02.440]  if the baby doesn't touch the woman. It's born now. And now it's a baby, not a fetus.
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:06.440]  But a lot of these facilities just take them in the back, keep them alive, put them on
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:11.760]  a breathing apparatus. And then last thing they take is the heart. They want to get full
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:17.000]  dollar for those organs. They want to vivisect them properly. And you notice it's all in
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  the news now. This is just part of what's beneath the surface. Meanwhile, nanotech,
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:30.440]  please continue Dr. Grubb. Well, yeah, like I said, I mean, this is something that is
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:37.320]  pretty scary as far as being able to create our own foods and nanoparticles. I did want
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:41.680]  to mention though, because as I was doing my research, I wanted to see if there's been
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:47.800]  any statements by the Environmental Protection Agency for syngenta, the one that's using
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:56.560]  nanoparticles in the pesticides and herbicides right now. Or if there's been any feedback
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:04.400]  from the U.S. government and actually the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:11.160]  a pesticide newly formulated as a nanoemulsion would not require regulatory reexamination
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:18.040]  since it would not be a new chemical, new chemical form, nor a significant new use.
[02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:20.520]  But by definition, the whole molecule's been changed.
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:21.520]  Exactly.
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:22.520]  Only Toledo.
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:31.320]  This is a stealth way to get very damaging particles into the cell wall, which have been
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:35.440]  shown in trials. And you can pull this up on PubMed. As a matter of fact, here's an abstract
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:36.440]  right here.
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:37.440]  It goes through the cell wall.
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:42.480]  It goes through the cell wall and the health complications, especially damaging to the
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:49.600]  lungs, the spleen, causes an inflammatory response in the gut, and also an inflammatory
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:51.600]  response in the body as a general.
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:55.040]  Crohn's type diseases are epidemic all of a sudden.
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:57.320]  Inflammatory diseases are epidemic all of a sudden.
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:03.640]  Autoimmune diseases are epidemic. So it's just another thing that you need to be aware
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:12.240]  of and look out for. And even the National Organic Program, we still allow nanoparticles
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:14.640]  to be used in organic foods.
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:18.600]  Stay there. You know the short segments at the end of the hour, the start of the hour.
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:21.760]  It's the clock we have. It's one of the standard ones. I hate it. Some stations don't even
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:25.080]  care this five minutes. When we come back, I'm going to shut up for the 12 minutes. I
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:29.120]  want you to start over, run through it all, then get through your whole analysis because
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:34.720]  this is so stunningly important. And if you, the viewers and listeners send out this audio
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:38.640]  file today from the podcast, your friends and family, or the video link, or the YouTube
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:44.520]  tonight or tomorrow, it can have a big effect. I mean, so many times what we cover here first,
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:47.960]  maybe we should try to get the food babe who we promote her stuff. You know, our audience
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:52.120]  does get her to go after nanotech as well because we need to get a chain reaction going
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:59.280]  here because this is really the big issue. Dr. Groups, stay there. We'll be back.
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:07.080]  Kill whites and cops. Black Lives Matter affiliated radio show calls for a race war. In a disgusting
[02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:13.600]  audio broadcast via blog talk radio yesterday, an individual who admitted affiliation with
[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:19.360]  the Black Lives Matter movement called for listeners to murder white people and police
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:25.400]  declaring it open season for executions. Open season on killing whites and white police
[02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:31.000]  officers. And I want to talk about the shooting of the white deputy sheriff in Houston, Texas.
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:36.040]  It's open season on killing whites and white police officers and probably killing cops
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:41.040]  period. It's open season picking them off. Today we live in a time where the white man
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:45.400]  will be picked off and it's nothing he can do about it. His day is up. His time is up.
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:50.960]  We'll witness more executions and killing white people and cops than we ever have before.

[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:31.600]  We're talking nanotech and for a decade or more it's been in food packaging, it's being
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:37.880]  put in the foods, but now they're rolling out with completely changed foods that last
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:46.480]  longer, taste better, have more flavor and it's just totally untested. And then you've
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:51.240]  got nanotech also in vaccines. We reported on this years ago what I called brain eating
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:56.800]  vaccines just like they go, oh, we don't sell baby parts, we sell fetus parts, but only
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:01.400]  embryos are restricted. The tiny ones you can't sell, the big ones you can't. And then
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:06.240]  they laugh, that's how we play the game. It's the same thing. They go, oh, we have a vaccine
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:13.120]  for depressed people, for the veterans. And then it's a live engineered nanotech virus.
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:25.480]  The virus is just information, RNA, that goes in and programs the body. Simply amazing.
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:30.320]  Yes, scroll down, we can show TV viewers the actual video. And they just announce it like
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:37.120]  it's fun, gets your news shot and you won't be depressed anymore. It's literally a lobotomy
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:41.040]  that goes in and eats certain parts of your brain. So this is the brave new world we're
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:45.920]  facing. And I wonder how far they're going to go. Bill Gates talks about nanotech delivered
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:52.080]  vaccines. He talks about forced inoculations, nanotech in foods that inoculates you, where
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:57.760]  the nanotech crystallizes the life pathogen, then dissolves in the body, but can be grown
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:02.120]  into the crops themselves, pharmacological. Dr. Group, you've got the floor. Then we're
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:09.640]  going to go to phone calls, the toll free number for questions for Dr. Group, 800-259-9231,
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:17.200]  Dr. Group, go ahead. Well, there's really still not a lot of information
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:23.800]  on this. If you search nano foods or nanosteuticals or nanopesticides, there's really a limited
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:28.800]  amount of information. So it is something to be aware of. And the best solution that
[02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:35.800]  I can come up with is try to avoid any type of packaged and processed foods. Even though
[02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:42.120]  there is nanoparticles in organic foods, the one that you really want to look out for is
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:48.920]  going to be titanium dioxide. Zinc oxide in sunscreens, as a matter of fact, is nanoparticolized,
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:54.120]  and that's causing different types of problems in people. We all know that with the geoengineering
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:59.320]  and the chemtrails that aluminum nanoparticles are being sprayed in the air. Another reason
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:04.160]  why you need to continue to detoxify, clean the air in your home, in your office, put
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:08.560]  some live plants in there, get a good air purification system, so at least you're going to be breathing
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:14.280]  clean air, eating clean food, and drinking clean water. Some of the things that have
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:21.040]  been documented out there to contain nanoparticles in there are going to be Mentos, the little
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:28.600]  mint, M&Ms, coffee creamers, chocolate, milk, yogurt, dairy substitutes. I had something
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:36.360]  happen to me about two years ago where I had intense neck and shoulder and headaches for
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:41.680]  about two weeks. Finally, I had to start eliminating everything in my diet, and I realized that
[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:47.200]  I was using a certified organic coffee creamer whenever I had a cup of coffee, which is like
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:52.480]  once every couple of days or something like that, but this was severe pain and stiffness.
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:58.680]  I could barely even turn my head. I finally realized when I traced it back to the certified
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:03.600]  organic coffee creamer that I had titanium dioxide in it, and titanium dioxide is used
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:09.200]  as a whitener. It's also all the pop tarts out there with the white frosting on it or
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:14.520]  anything white that they want that white color in, so I would highly recommend everybody
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:19.920]  look for titanium dioxide on the label. That's probably one of the biggest health concerns
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:28.360]  out there, and when I realized it, and I actually typed in titanium dioxide toxic online and
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:34.360]  was able to pull up a whole list of symptoms, fibromyalgia-type symptoms, so it kind of
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:43.560]  led me to believe that, hey, maybe fibromyalgia is caused by toxic chemicals. Anyway, that's
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:48.440]  one of the pieces of advice I would give to everybody out there is just read the ingredients
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:54.680]  and look for titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and be aware of the possibility of nanoparticles
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:13:01.800]  in your food, especially if you're using processed, canned, boxed, non-organic food
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:02.800]  items.
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:07.680]  Doc, I'm giving you the floor because you get me so excited I want to rub. Keep rolling
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:09.120]  with all this research you've done.
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:15.640]  Well, I mean, that's about it really. I mean, really, these particles were introduced actually
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:21.800]  in 1959, so they've slowly been gaining speed and gaining speed, and I think it's just at
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:26.960]  the time right now where we need to educate people and educate the viewers out there and
[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:31.560]  the listeners to just be aware of this, and also, how do you get these things out of your
[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:36.440]  body? And that's another reason why it's so important to cleanse, cleanse, cleanse, because
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:38.240]  all of these damaging effects-
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:42.360]  Let's talk about cleansing, because obviously you designed deep cleanse for M4sLife.com.
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:46.680]  I want to go over some of the ingredients and go to callers and talk about some of the reviews,
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:50.400]  but basically the infomercial won't last more than five minutes here. But last time
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:55.160]  you were here, you also talked about other parts of the cleanse, apple cider vinegar,
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:14:02.200]  pure water, sweating more, exercising more. I mean, let's go through a cleanse that people
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:07.200]  can do even if they don't get deep cleanse from infowarslife.com to supercharge things.
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:13.040]  Well, one of the easiest and most effective ways to cleanse your body is just water. I
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:18.160]  mean, water in itself detoxifies you, and I'm not talking about tap water, obviously,
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:24.880]  but if you get a good purified source of water, add some organic apple cider vinegar to it,
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:28.960]  you're going to get minerals, you're going to get live enzymes, you're going to get probiotics
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:33.040]  in the organic apple cider vinegar, and you're actually going to get different types of vitamins
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:39.300]  in organic apple cider vinegar. So that alone is a really good effective way to kickstart
[02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:44.560]  your body, or if you don't have a lot of money and you want to continue to detoxify yourself,
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:49.960]  just drink a lot more water, about half your body weight in ounces a day. And if you do
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:55.680]  that for a period of like six or seven days and drink only that, and that means not consuming
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:15:01.480]  any coffee, not consuming any alcohol, not consuming any of the other damaging beverages,
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:07.080]  then you're going to be able to detoxify your body. And that's why all of the old cultures
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:11.960]  used to do fasting. They used to do 40 day fasting or 10 day fasting or a week fasting
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:18.480]  from time to time, just to give their body time to detoxify. Although now we have a thousand
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:24.440]  fold more chemicals in our environment than those cultures did way back when. And now we
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:29.000]  have so many poisons in the air and the food and the water and everything else. So that's
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:34.240]  one of the good ways. If you do have the money, then I always recommend the first part, damaging
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:39.560]  part is the gut. I mean, you really have to focus on cleansing the intestinal. So apple
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:46.280]  cider vinegar, do the oxy powder cleanse, and then take our deep cleanse. And how do
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:50.880]  you recommend people take the deep cleanse? Well, I recommend starting off slow, following
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:55.520]  the instructions on the label, you know, you can even start off with a dropper full twice
[02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:58.760]  a day, one in the more once in the morning on an empty stomach and then another dropper
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:04.320]  full in the afternoon. If that causes you to have what's called a herxheimer reaction
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:10.200]  or a healing crisis, then I would back off on that amount of dosage just because you
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:14.840]  can sometimes pull these chemicals and metals out of the body too fast. And that could cause
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:19.560]  a headache. It could cause some fatigue. It could cause some muscle swallowing lymph nodes
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:24.600]  and you know, you got to give your body time to detoxify. And that's what like what you
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:31.440]  said, sweating, sweating is a natural detoxification pathway, respirating. So if you can even join
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:35.600]  a club, even not a big exerciser and get the steam room for 20 minutes, a couple times
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:41.240]  a week, right? Guys have four ways to eliminate toxins and chemicals from their body. You
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:45.160]  sweat them out, you breathe them out when you're doing heavy activity and you're actually
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:49.920]  respirating, you urinate them out and you defecate them out. And that's it. That's the only way
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:53.320]  you're going to be able to get rid of these top women have the menstrual cycle to women
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:57.640]  have their menstrual cycle. So women actually have five ways. So really what you want to
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:03.320]  do is you want to open up all your elimination routes and start eliminating the sources of
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:08.800]  the chemicals that are coming into your body. And with the assistance of like the oxy powder
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:13.120]  and cleansing and neutralizing the toxins in the intestines, the deep cleanse, which
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:17.520]  is going to go into the lymphatic system, the blood system, the liver, the spleen, the
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:23.240]  kidneys. It's it's it really is a deep cleanse that's going to happen. And with the components
[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:28.080]  in there, not only are you going to be providing the body with essential minerals and nutrients,
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:34.320]  but you're also going to be extracting and bonding some of those harmful substances and
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:39.520]  getting them out of the system. And we know now that some of these chemicals can be stored
[02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:47.440]  for 20, 30, 40 years. We've had people that have done the liver shield and the liver cleansing
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:53.800]  program and taken their stones into a camp that had a friend at a college at a university
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:59.840]  and taken them in. And they were analyzed and they even found like four or five pieces
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:06.080]  of gum in there that came out from 20, 30 years ago. So we know that the body actually
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:11.040]  holds especially gum sometimes deep in the tissues. I don't know if those were stored
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:14.560]  deep in the intestines or if those actually really did come out of the liver, probably
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:21.240]  the intestines, but we do know now that it does take time and liver cleanse is just absolutely
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:24.480]  spectacular. What it does, we're going to be talking about that again soon. Here's New
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:30.400]  York in New York, have this to say as a review of deep cleanse. I'm always toxic cleansing
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:35.000]  this product in combination with others is a must for me. It couldn't be easier to take.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:41.640]  I look forward to it twice a day. Life outlook is so much more positive. This replaces my
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:47.120]  heavy metal detox that goes on. The only bad thing is that I run out of it. I love it.
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:53.560]  Here's another review by still free in Idaho. I don't know any other way than to say I just
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:58.400]  feel better in general. An overall sense of improved wellbeing. So I started taking this
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:03.440]  at the beginning of August. I will be reordering. So thank you for your support and thank you
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:08.960]  for checking that out. And again, folks, none of us are perfect. It's a process. I've gone
[02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:14.320]  from job of the hut levels five years ago to losing almost 70 pounds and having a lot
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:19.440]  more energy, a lot healthier skin. My mind works a lot better. It makes my temper worse.
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:23.760]  It seems to be like when I'm kind of in a haze. I'm not that mean, but all the products
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:28.000]  at InfoWarsLife are just amazing and they help fund our operation as well. We've got

[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:23.720]  By the way, Dr. Group during the break was talking to me and I'm like, hey, don't plug
[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:28.480]  liver shield that you developed for us. That's been sold out for four months. He goes, no,
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:32.840]  it's not. The truck is on its way here from his laboratory. And I went out and talked
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:37.880]  to the guys. They checked the tracking. It'll be here tomorrow. So I'm putting it up on
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:45.080]  the shopping cart, infowarstore.com, infowarstlife.com right now. If you want to try to get it again,
[02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:48.480]  get the apple cider vinegar that we don't sell, the oxy powder that we do and do the
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:54.000]  six day cleanse, there's nothing in a week more dramatic. I think X2 probably is the
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:58.400]  most important of everything. Takes about two, three weeks to hit. If you have an iodine
[02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:02.320]  deficient, this is the true iodine. I'm going to stop plugging there. It's just that liver
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:06.880]  shield is going back up in the next 10 minutes and infowarstlife.com as well.

[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:18.120]  Peter and many others. The toll free number to join us is 800-2599-231. Who do you want
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:19.120]  to go to first, Dr. Group?
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:20.760]  Let's go to Dan in Indiana.
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:23.480]  Dan in Indiana, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:31.200]  Hey guys. Dr. Group, I have a question for you real quick. A few years ago, I was actually
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:41.000]  diagnosed with skin disorder, vitiligo. I've changed my diet, gone off wheat, avoid dairy
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:49.200]  and taken a lot of your products, a lot of the vitamin B, B12, the cleanse, the bowel
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:57.600]  cleanse. Just wondered in your opinion, if it were you, what you might do to accompany
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:25:58.600]  that?
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:03.800]  Well, usually what I do for skin conditions is I first of all clean the intestines with
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:09.080]  the oxy powder and then use a really good probiotic blend and it can take a little while
[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:15.160]  to kind of repair the bowel. Of course, eliminate anything that can be damaging. Also, like
[02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:22.720]  an ozonated olive oil to put on the skin sometimes work, but also a vitamin D seems to be pretty
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:28.560]  effective, but you have to be like what I would do is take about 20,000 IU's a day and
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:34.440]  that's the winter sun. Also, iodine is associated with the skin and every single skin cells.
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:39.600]  Sure. How was your, let me just interrupt, how was your kind of Michael Jackson disease,
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:44.280]  as they call it? How has that, has that gotten any better since you've been cleansing or
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:46.000]  what happened?
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:53.920]  Well, I've been dealing with it for probably about five to seven years. It just, it kind
[02:26:53.920 --> 02:27:00.520]  of came on light and then got worse, progressively worse, but it hasn't gotten any worse since
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:01.520]  I've been doing this.
[02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:04.360]  Well, hopefully I'll stop the progression. Let me just ask my own self this question.
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:08.960]  I have a friend named Scott, great musician, famous guy actually. He has that and the doctor
[02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:14.080]  told him he got it about three years after he got on Paxil and they said, no, that's
[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:18.240]  a side effect of Pascal and he looks like a vampire. I mean, he actually has, you know,
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:21.880]  like a black pompadour and he looks kind of handsome because he's, but it's kind of like,
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:27.640]  man, does this count Dracula? His skin is totally white and they admitted Paxil did
[02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:29.240]  it to him. Have you heard of that?
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:34.520]  I have heard of that. Yeah. I have heard that different variety of pharmaceuticals can change
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:40.040]  the melanin producing compounds within the skin cells. As a matter of fact, there is
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:47.520]  a company and I've been looking into it that actually is selling a powdered melanin and
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:54.400]  also just as a side note, the chaga mushroom is, is very high in melanin. So another thing
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:28:00.600]  I might recommend is that you take a chaga mushroom extractor powder supplement.
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:05.600]  Here's an example. When you told me four years ago, we were about to get in business together.
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:09.720]  You said, take my proprietary eye. It's not out yet, but take it because you've got these
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:14.040]  aging spots, sunspots on your face. You won't have as many of those. And after about a few
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:19.360]  months on it, the, a lot of those went away and 90% and I get Tanner easier now before
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:23.160]  I just burned. I mean, now I can get as dark as a Mexican. I love it. I mean, I love having
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:28.000]  dark skin. It looks good. It feels good. I enjoy it. I enjoy the sun, but wow. I mean,
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.920]  that, how did the iodine make my skin get darker?
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:35.560]  Well, because iodine is used for every single cell in the body. And when you start providing
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:42.240]  the nutrients, see the skin takes a beating because it's the outside. It's the same epithelial
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:46.860]  tissue as the bowel. And the good thing about it is the inside of the bowel regenerates
[02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:51.200]  every 24 hours and the skin does this white flakes off all the time. But if you don't
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:56.000]  have the proper nutrition coming into your body, cause your skin layer start deep and
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:01.200]  you're in the deepest layer will ultimately rise to the top. So the cleaner you are and
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:06.960]  the more nutritious you eat will provide a healthier skin cell to come. So what happened
[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:10.680]  with you is you started regulating your diet. You started eating healthier. You had the
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:14.720]  iodine, which was balancing out your hormones better. Your thyroid was getting balanced
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:20.920]  out and your, your skin cells deep below where it was, we're getting the iodine to produce
[02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:26.600]  everything that they needed to produce the oils, the melanin, everything like that.
[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:31.160]  So as it came up to the surface, your skin was healthier and it'll continue to be healthier.
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:34.720]  That is one thing my skin has gotten oilier. It's gotten healthier, but it has gotten
[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:38.240]  oilier. I guess the iodine does that, which is great because the oil is there to protect
[02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:41.840]  you from the sun and protect you from, instead of putting lotion on my body's giving them
[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:45.000]  their own. All right, sir. I hope that answers your question. Thank you, Dan. You got a lot
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:50.400]  of info. Hope you get better. God bless you. Stay with us. We're on the March, the empires
[02:29:50.400 --> 02:30:03.040]  on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network kill whites and cops. Black Lives Matter affiliated
[02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:11.120]  radio show calls for a race war in a disgusting audio broadcast via blog talk radio. Yesterday,
[02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:16.160]  an individual who admitted affiliation with the black lives matter movement called for
[02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:23.160]  listeners to murder white people and police declaring it open season for executions. Open
[02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:28.200]  season on killing whites and white police officers. And I want to talk about the shooting
[02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:33.880]  of the white deputy sheriff in Houston, Texas. Open season on killing white and white police
[02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:39.920]  officers and probably killing cops period. It's open season picking them off. Today,
[02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:43.240]  we live in a time where the white man will be picked off and it's nothing he can do about
[02:30:43.240 --> 02:30:48.160]  his day is up. His time is up. We'll witness more executions and killing of white people
[02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:54.600]  and cops than we ever have before. For updates on this story and breaking news as it happens,

[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:48.560]  many days but also my other great anchors reporters and researchers and we're going
[02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:56.440]  to look at the fact that babies are being aborted after birth on purpose with whistleblowers
[02:33:56.440 --> 02:34:04.000]  and they're killing them with vaccines knowing it's killing and this is part of the program
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:09.160]  just like Bayer knew for 12 years working with Bill Clinton that they were shipping out of
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:15.600]  Arkansas prison system blood with HIV and hepatitis A, B and C in it and when it came
[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:19.240]  out in the memos it was the corporate meetings going we need to get rid of these hemophiliacs
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:25.160]  anyways they're a weight on society ship the blood so it's this weird attitude like kill
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:31.000]  somebody who's a hemophiliac or kill kill a baby that's you know a premium weighs four
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:37.880]  pounds I mean this is really an evil death cult what I call the death wing that we're
[02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:44.920]  facing and I don't have words to describe how evil these people are I try to fund our
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:50.480]  operation and become successful and large in the face of the globalist as long as you
[02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:55.800]  can fight them by selling and promoting things that aren't going to block everything they're
[02:34:55.800 --> 02:35:00.120]  doing to us everything we've done to ourselves it didn't all the new world order but you
[02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:05.760]  do the liver shield liver cleanse every day with water mixed with apple cider vinegar
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:13.200]  for six days twice a day and then on the sixth day you take the olive oil about six
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:17.880]  eight ounces of that drink it and lay on your side that has your liver and your gallbladder
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:22.000]  on it and of course every night for the six days take four to eight depending on how big
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:27.600]  you are of the oxy powder higher level oxygen that releases in the upper and lower intestines
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:33.480]  the large and small intestine it is spectacular I mean I lost like ten pounds when I did it
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:38.200]  the first time five pounds the next Rob do lost 12 pounds we should really put all those
[02:35:38.200 --> 02:35:43.720]  testimonials together liver shield is back in tomorrow the truck is on its way here deep
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:48.240]  cleanse is now back in our facility it's actually been in for a few days we're waiting for Dr.
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:56.560]  group to get here both these products are now available at info wars life.com or 888-2533139
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:36:00.320]  and cleansing yourself will at least push a lot of the garbage that's sitting in your
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:06.040]  gallbladder or sitting in your blood or sitting in your bone marrow out my dad you know as
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:11.920]  a chemist and a retired old surgeon and dentist and he's formulated nutraceuticals for FDA
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:16.760]  approval before that's why we got him working with the company and he does a great job and
[02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:21.040]  he always told me don't do it all the time but if you get exposed to something toxic
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:28.320]  he goes I do occasionally do a week of basically not eating solid foods drinking you know lemon
[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:31.480]  and stuff with water this is what he'd been told by old chemists you know decades ago
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:35.360]  that would be exposed to bad stuff grignard reagents is what he called him he was told
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:40.120]  us by an old UT chemist lemon with the water I guess that alkalizes you or something I'm
[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:47.640]  not sure fast for a week but the water needs to be distilled and he said more than a week
[02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:53.800]  or so distilled water he believes is toxic because it I guess is a key later as well
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:58.960]  and it drags toxins out is that correct doctor group well according to the research yes that
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:03.720]  is correct right now I think we have so many I mean distilled water is really a dead water
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:08.600]  but it's also the cleanest water because that's the only way that you can get all of the chemicals
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:12.520]  and the fluoride but it has an effect of pulling stuff out it does have an effect of it's a
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:17.480]  hungry water so it does have the effect of pulling toxic materials and could potentially
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:21.520]  pull other good minerals he was told that by an old top chemist at UT do you think that's
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:25.760]  true I think it is true but the good thing about it is he also recommend putting lemon
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:33.040]  juice in there lemon juice is a real highly negatively charged compound and that's why
[02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:37.680]  it's so good at cleansing and in anybody that has it's an old remedy we used to use for
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:42.360]  years and years for care of a grandma says you got a cold you know shot of Jack Daniels
[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:48.960]  or James with a whole lemon in it yeah well I tell you what for kidney stones it's it's
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:53.600]  you know having somebody just fast on lemon juice and water it's great because that it's
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:57.880]  such a those are negative electrons will break down those stones slowly over a period of time
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:02.160]  so it is a good cleanser and that is a good way you know take three or four days and just
[02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:05.360]  drink nothing but water and lemon juice and you will be able to clean your body up pretty
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:09.160]  good absolutely so it's not just getting our products folks but it's anything to counter
[02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:14.720]  the globalist Ernie in California thanks for holding her on the air hello there so glad
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:20.080]  that I could finally connect with you AJ and Dr. Group glad to speak with you too I have
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:28.480]  a suggestion for you a Alex and also a question for the doctor can you hear me okay loud and
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:35.440]  clear brother great my question for you Dr. Group and I'd like for you to answer after
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:40.960]  I've given my comment to AJ if you don't mind I'll get offline at that point sure I recently
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:49.920]  moved I had to move to an upper unit it's only temporary I've moved knowing that the
[02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:53.760]  cigarette smoke at the lower on the lower unit was going to really be a problem it's
[02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:58.960]  a huge problem just expanded problem more so than I thought it would be what would your
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:04.080]  thing would be the best way to help mitigate the toxic effects of the second hand smoke
[02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:10.360]  that comes up from the plumbing and wherever else and how an ongoing basis can I protect
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:17.240]  myself until I can manage to move out as quickly as I can AJ I have I'm in complete accord
[02:39:17.240 --> 02:39:23.520]  with what you've been saying about what appears to be an agenda of creating racial tension
[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:30.960]  for a specific purpose and I've been watching and observing I have a suggestion since I
[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:37.120]  started listening to you back in 2009 when I became aware of just the extent to which
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:45.600]  the media was hiding the natural born issue and how Obama is not natural born that you
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:57.400]  have engaged periodically in sort of offensiveness to mitigate evil and whether it's you know
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:09.360]  you do video contests or info bombs or whatever I'd like to suggest to you now that you look
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:15.800]  you and your your fantastic crew put your heads together over time as short as time
[02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:22.800]  is possible and really come up with something innovative something that consider this block
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:33.600]  talk screw job nut job as a shot across the bow and look for a way that would help to
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:41.320]  and maybe include all of us out in the world who are listeners to to to come up with something
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:46.200]  or to participate in some way in mass to go in and have an effect I mean there's a lot
[02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:51.440]  of ways to do that and and and we should think about that really great question great comment
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:58.720]  my research on secondhand smoke is tobacco itself is a very psychoactive extremely powerful
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:04.560]  the mafia used to wear rubber gloves underneath leather gloves in the winter they would come
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:09.000]  up and throw pure nicotine on somebody on their back or whatever we go through their
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:14.360]  shirt that they have a heart attack 20 months later and die it's a I guess a viso constrictor
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:18.960]  so it's deadly poison but like marijuana it may actually have some health benefits some
[02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:23.840]  derivatives but we're not pushing that pure tobacco itself obviously isn't good for you
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:28.320]  overall when you're smoking it but with the hundreds of additives that we know they put
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:32.720]  it to make it more addictive this when you smell cigarettes now I mean they smell like
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:37.600]  the most nasty crap on earth and that's one reason I quit smoking cigarettes I never
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:40.680]  smoked them really heavy but I smoked some here and there when I had beer or whatever
[02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:45.240]  but about six seven years ago they started tasting so horrible matter what brand with
[02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:50.240]  the fire retardant in them that I mean no one could smoke that I still only has a cigar
[02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:55.960]  and it's a good one I like it so something's changed in tobacco it's gotten even more weaponized
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:42:01.160]  and when I smell one now just blowing outside it makes me sick what's going on with cigarettes
[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:07.040]  and what could he do to try to detox or mitigate that well for secondhand smoke the easiest
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:11.000]  way to mitigate that is to clean the air in your environment and I recommend there's a
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:16.160]  company called RGF and they have plug-in units and they have whole house system units that
[02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:20.960]  are available and that's the same company it's a US based company that actually developed
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:25.040]  the air purification systems during the SARS outbreak in China when China put together
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:31.280]  a research team to try to determine the best air purification systems and they use an ionized
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:37.720]  hydro peroxide system that's the one I use in my house but you can also put two or three
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:43.440]  live plants in each room of your house it's amazing at how many toxins plants will absorb
[02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:51.400]  and then of course you want to look at not putting any paints that are going to emit
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:55.640]  any volatile organic compounds etc and then of course cleansing your body cleansing your
[02:42:55.640 --> 02:43:01.400]  lungs we do have a formula here called lung cleanse which is a very effective product
[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:08.280]  at cleansing and regenerating the lung tissue I've used it many people around the world
[02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:13.440]  have used it there's amazing reviews about it anything from you know difficulty breathing
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:19.520]  to lung health it's really kind of hard to clean the lungs but secondhand smoke and all
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:24.720]  of the things that we're exposed to in the air every single day it's a vital part that's
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:30.400]  why I developed a product specifically for the lungs because we breathe 30,000 breaths
[02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:35.120]  every single day we have to have some way to clean the lungs well dr. group again from
[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:41.120]  the global healing center dot com joins us for me it's just realizing the natural things
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:45.400]  that God gave us in the environment are the counter to all this and it really works and
[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:49.720]  it's that obvious but even drug companies and and nutritional companies we're under
[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:54.040]  a lot more regulations than say the cigarette makers not when it comes to taxes or where
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:59.520]  they can sell it but their additives all these grandfathered laws with food additives and
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:04.600]  tobacco additives where they can put hundreds of chemicals in that are incredibly toxic
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:10.880]  and addictive so there's this whole science to frank and food frank and tobacco you name
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:20.200]  it that's the real problem Jim in Colorado you're on the air go ahead hi Alex welcome
[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:30.000]  hi dr. group I called to thank you I was listening to you about two and a half months ago and
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:37.480]  it suffered for several decades with discomfort under my right side rib cage and as I always
[02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:42.440]  do I was listening to Alex in the background while I was doing things here in the house
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:47.000]  and I heard you speak about gallbladder cleansing and liver cleansing and my ears perked up
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:51.560]  because the things you were describing sounded exactly like the discomfort and pain that
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:59.600]  I had been enduring and so I tried this and it was a miracle man let me tell you I passed
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:03.760]  so many stones it was disgusting I couldn't believe that stuff was in my body because
[02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:09.320]  I had always kind of prided it taking my body you know I had always been the bodybuilder
[02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:14.200]  and kept kept my physical appearance up I couldn't believe this filth was three years
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:20.160]  ago just to interrupt you three years ago Anthony was back there when he first started
[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:23.200]  working here and he was doing a liver cleanse because he worked here about six eight months
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:26.880]  before he's ever even on air I guess he'd been a guest before but before he even announced
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:31.960]  he was actually working here because then he was just a consultant and he's going you
[02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:34.760]  gotta do this liver cleanse you gotta do this liver cleanse you gotta do this liver cleanse
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:38.200]  you know we need to come out with our own you know special brand of this concentrate of
[02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:44.160]  the Dr. Gribbs developing and I showed me online photos of gallstones and gallbladders
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:48.240]  and I said I don't believe that and finally after a year and a half of him pecking at
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:52.320]  me and you I did it and I don't want to get into details it didn't happen the next day
[02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:56.720]  like it does for most people happened two days later when I was at Alamo Draft House
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:46:00.560]  about to walk into a movie and I said excuse me one minute to my friends I was out with
[02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:03.680]  my kids I made them sit out there on the bench and I went in and I'm not going to get into
[02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:09.040]  details but let me it's like a horror movie and and and I'm and I had the black balls
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:12.920]  which they say is even worse than the green ones oh don't put it on screen the point is
[02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:16.600]  I don't wonder these things rupture because your body is trying to process stuff that
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:21.160]  isn't natural it just balls it up it doesn't know what to do so I interrupted you start
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:28.200]  over with what happened up to you sir Jim well Alex mine were actually 10 stones and
[02:46:28.200 --> 02:46:35.440]  I had a bunch of stuff that looked like grit and sand that came out as well and well to
[02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:40.320]  be to be sure I had had so much pain under my right rib cage Dr. Group that it felt like
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:44.800]  you know it was popping in there and I pushed on it I could actually feel popping well now
[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:49.600]  my guess is I had so many stones in there that they were grinding against each other
[02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:53.720]  I did this thing with that you suggested got the liver cleanse and I turbo boost I did some
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:47:01.000]  research on the internet and I turbo boosted it by doing epsom salts as well and I passed
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:06.520]  it had to been easily a hundred stones and today I feel better than I did 30 years ago
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:12.640]  I have more energy and when I urinate I can smell it actually from feet away so I know
[02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:18.840]  my body is just blowing toxins out that the bile ducts must have been previously completely
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:23.960]  blocked up or something well you know I forgot I called group the next day and I said I didn't
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:28.840]  pass the stones and he goes you may have to do another one you may be really backed up
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:34.320]  and he said I tell you what go to the store get the little caplets get epsom salts and
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:39.760]  take five or six of those tonight and then that was the next day it did it but I had
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:44.440]  to take the epsom salt I forgot so I guess that's how you turbo charge when do you recommend
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:49.880]  you take the epsom salts for people like Jim and I well we actually added the epsom salts
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:55.120]  to the actual program itself so the day that you get you drink the olive oil earlier in
[02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:59.240]  the day around one or two in the afternoon we have you do the epsom salts mix them in
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:04.040]  water and drink that down and then later in the evening that day which is the flush day
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:08.720]  is when you drink the four to six ounces of olive oil of course cold pressed organic olive
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:14.520]  oil and the reason why the olive oil is included in the reason it works so good is because
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:19.400]  it's like oil pulling which is an ancient ayurvedic tradition of circulating oil in
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:24.080]  your mouth and it pulls toxins out so what happens when you drink that much olive oil
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:29.800]  it goes in it goes through the liver you're lying on your right side and it's the four
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:34.360]  days beforehand when you're taking the liver shield what you're doing is you're softening
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:39.480]  all the stones you're turning them into sponge like stone opening a lever and you're breaking
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:46.000]  them into little little or pieces and the gallbladder and so that day the the heavy amount of oil
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:50.040]  from the olive oil is actually going to contract and squeeze almost like you have a sponge full
[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:55.080]  of water and you squeeze that out without the olive oil you don't ever get that squeezing
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:59.800]  effect sure but I mean this is sensational this should have been on Oprah and Dr Oz I
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:03.520]  didn't believe it well when you guys were telling me I just said come on I'm not going
[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:07.960]  to have green balls come out okay so think of all the money spent on gallbladder surgeries
[02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:12.240]  every year think of how many people have their gallbladders taken out every single year I
[02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:17.040]  don't have that estimate in front of me but I know it's it's it's there's millions and
[02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:21.920]  millions and millions of dollars it's gotta be billions it's gotta be billions so we
[02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:26.960]  total health care is like some ridiculous number like 500 billion a year or something

In this segment five minutes to the next then we're going to have InfoWars Network News Director Rob Duke come in and host a 55 minutes of the show with I think it's Leanne McAdoo and Jakari Jackson coming in with him when David Knight's back next week
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:51.640]  I'll be doing the fourth hour sometimes as well we have a lot of special reports that are going to premiere in this new fourth hour we're going to make this one of the most important hours of the transmission and cover a lot of the news that's just broken
[02:54:51.640 --> 02:55:05.640]  whether we haven't gotten to yet and certain stuff I'll say hey I want you to cover this like the EU migrant crisis out of control 10 mind blowing facts about CERN I'm going to give these to do and I'm going to say I don't care when you do it just cover these during your hour
[02:55:05.640 --> 02:55:13.640]  That way some stuff we didn't get to this important they'll end up covering in that fourth hour when it is just another hour to pack more info in take your calls you name it
[02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:21.640]  Peter in Washington you're on the air with Dr. Edward Group the founder of the Global Healing Center go ahead
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:23.640]  Yes you can hear me can't you
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:24.640]  I can brother thank you
[02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:48.640]  Okay fine Dr. Group I've been taking paracetam about 20 years on my own recommendation sometimes with liquid Kaleen nitrate I have no complaints but I'd like to hear your opinion and then secondly whether it would be compatible with your product
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:56.640]  Well I'm guessing you're probably taking that for pain somewhere can you give me a little bit of paracetam no no
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:06.640]  Paracetam a new trail that's an early smart drug came out over 40 years ago you're not familiar with
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:23.640]  Okay yes yes yes I don't think there's going to be any type of contraindications I always recommend that whenever you're taking any natural supplement spread it out as much as you can especially 30 minutes before or after any type of pharmaceutical or any type of other
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:39.640]  Nutraceutical if you can just play it by ear you know just play it by ear the most important thing is anything that you're taking you want to look and see if it has any toxic fillers or excipients or binders in it I'm pretty sure you might have some excipients and binders in that
[02:56:39.640 --> 02:56:53.640]  And those usually accumulate in the liver so again it all goes back to how clean your body is and ultimately what the body needs to heal itself and reactivating the body's self healing mechanism so
[02:56:53.640 --> 02:57:09.640]  Well I was on an airplane with a chemist very I mean I looked him up he was well known flying back from Toronto he lives in California and he runs major pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in Toronto and he said look most drugs today were getting approved
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:23.640]  You know he said most of the drugs were approved 20-30 years ago we couldn't get approved today he said if you take Tylenol and you drink alcohol you might as well just cut your liver out and he goes and no one will tell anybody that it's deadly for your liver
[02:57:23.640 --> 02:57:33.640]  And people popping this stuff all day and they just don't know he said Advil was fine but people just don't know that just because something was approved before and I'm not saying your drugs are there's tens of thousands who can know them all
[02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:45.640]  Just you know research it for yourself that's the great thing about the internet there's so much research out there and just check out what's credible for yourself I know Dr. Mercola's on as a medical doctor on Friday we'll go through a lot of this with him
[02:57:45.640 --> 02:57:51.640]  But we're trying to get him on right now thank you Peter God bless you let's jam in Matt and Connecticut you're on the air go ahead
[02:57:51.640 --> 02:58:03.640]  I had a question with that group about retinal vein occlusion in the eye retinal vein occlusion if there's nothing about it
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:16.640]  Well usually any type of retinal vein occlusions are going to be from a toxic build up and that could be from a combination of different things in your diet so that's even more the reason to cleanse the liver
[02:58:16.640 --> 02:58:30.640]  When the liver becomes congested then you start getting toxic particles into the bloodstream when you start that's also another reason why people start losing their vision around 40 at least their close up vision they have to have reading glasses
[02:58:30.640 --> 02:58:34.640]  Because you start getting tiny occlusions in the retinal veins and artery
[02:58:34.640 --> 02:58:38.640]  Hey Matt that was a great question got a jump we'll be right back in one minute
[02:58:38.640 --> 02:58:46.640]  We'll be back in one minute or 70 seconds info wars.com forward slash show you want to find the free feeds spread the word God bless you all

[03:00:16.640 --> 03:00:19.640]  Final segment with dr. Edward group
[03:00:19.640 --> 03:00:29.640]  We're taking your phone calls right now then 55 minutes or one two three four segments of radio slash TV with Rob do host in the fourth hour
[03:00:29.640 --> 03:00:38.640]  And if this goes well I'll be honest with you I'm just going to start creating new radio shows TV shows you name it spending them off reaching more people gardening shows
[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:50.640]  Mechanic shows second amendment shows and put them on GCN that's down the road Dylan in FEMA region 10 then cash and others go ahead Dylan thanks for calling
[03:00:50.640 --> 03:01:14.640]  Hey Alex and dr. Group. It's good to talk to you guys to talk to you so I have a quick question about your guys secret 12 my father has a genetic disease called pernicious anemia and from what I understand it's passed down through the mail line and it's the inability to digest is that like cushions or is that where you don't release right hormones
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:20.640]  I you know I'm not quite sure all I know is that he has to take b12 intravenously
[03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:22.640]  So he has malabsorption
[03:01:22.640 --> 03:01:26.640]  Yeah absolutely it would secret 12 work for him
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:41.640]  Well here's the thing usually when you have that condition pernicious anemia you have a problem breaking the b12 down and most of the b12 is in the cyanocobalamin form and it's even hard to break down when you get it in meats and eggs and stuff like that so
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:47.640]  The secret 12 I'm not going to say to work from him because I don't have enough information about his case
[03:01:47.640 --> 03:01:49.640]  I don't think you should try it and see what happens
[03:01:49.640 --> 03:01:54.640]  But you have the two cofactors I mean this is a b12 secret 12 is the methylcobalamin
[03:01:54.640 --> 03:01:56.640]  Yeah nobody sticks them together explain
[03:01:56.640 --> 03:02:05.640]  And the adenosylcobalamin so when b12 gets broken down into the body it gets broken down into two cofactors methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin
[03:02:05.640 --> 03:02:19.640]  There's a lot of methylcobalamin products out there but each one have kind of a different effect on the body in balancing the neurological system and also utilizing it for different components within the system for hormone production or whatever
[03:02:19.640 --> 03:02:26.640]  So we actually combine the adenosylcobalamin cofactor is extremely expensive I think it's something like $40,000 a kilogram
[03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:28.640]  That's why we were 20% that
[03:02:28.640 --> 03:02:30.640]  So 80% methylcobalamin
[03:02:30.640 --> 03:02:39.640]  80% methyl and 20% adenosylcobalamin so any type of b12 deficiency or problem I would highly recommend trying it out
[03:02:39.640 --> 03:02:44.640]  Because injectable is going into your blood same thing if it's under the mouth that's going into the blood vessels as well
[03:02:44.640 --> 03:02:51.640]  So basically from your research in common sense it's as close to injectable as you're going to get but we're not making medical statements here right
[03:02:51.640 --> 03:02:58.640]  And most of the injectable is cyanocobalamin anyway they do have injectable which is the methylcobalamin but they're still losing the other cofactor
[03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:01.640]  So instead of an organic medical doctor they give me methylcobalamin
[03:03:01.640 --> 03:03:08.640]  But they don't have adenosylcobalamin they only have methyl so yeah sure I would definitely give it a shot you know
[03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:17.640]  I mean you want to make sure you clear that with your dad's healthcare practitioner but this is the best form of b12 that's out there and that's bio
[03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:23.640]  Yeah we just set out I mean it cost me a lot to produce it it cost him a lot I mean this is Rolls Royce level for a very low price
[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:30.640]  I hope your dad gets better let's talk to cash in Missouri last caller I have time for on this subject go ahead and cash her on the air
[03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:40.640]  Yeah three quick questions Dr. Group first I heard Dr. Alex say that you were a military veteran is that right?
[03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:41.640]  That's correct
[03:03:41.640 --> 03:03:47.640]  Okay great and my second question is my wife hasn't saw me
[03:03:47.640 --> 03:03:51.640]  She suffered with it now for probably the last only two or three months
[03:03:51.640 --> 03:03:56.640]  I don't know what brought it on but any recommendations there
[03:03:56.640 --> 03:04:03.640]  Well yes if she has insomnia it could have I mean there's a lot of different factors that could be involved I don't know if you guys just recently moved
[03:04:03.640 --> 03:04:13.640]  We're sold out of knockout but go try you know the melatonin at the store go try the other things that are well known out there
[03:04:13.640 --> 03:04:15.640]  I mean isn't that a good thing to do
[03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:23.640]  Not a 5-HTP I mean there's an exercise look at what's causing the insomnia is she going through extra stresses in her life does she have thyroid issues
[03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:25.640]  Does she get close to menopause
[03:04:25.640 --> 03:04:37.640]  Does she have hormone issues is she ingesting phthalates or plastic somehow you know you definitely want to cleanse the body and that would be with all the cleansing products that we have here and try to address the root cause
[03:04:37.640 --> 03:04:42.640]  But another free thing she can do that works really good is stress reduction deep breathing and meditation
[03:04:42.640 --> 03:04:45.640]  And I would tell her to exercise more cause I
[03:04:45.640 --> 03:04:46.640]  Absolutely exercise
[03:04:46.640 --> 03:04:49.640]  I know electronics keeps me up but I'm in a hotel I can never sleep
[03:04:49.640 --> 03:04:57.640]  When I'm out in the middle of the woods I seem like I'm dead I mean it's all the stuff who knows what it is you'll have to you know keep removing stuff that you find out what it is God bless you
[03:04:57.640 --> 03:05:04.640]  On Sunday crews removed the Jefferson Davis and Woodrow Wilson statues from the UT main mall
[03:05:04.640 --> 03:05:13.640]  Since the church shooting in South Carolina the Black Lives Matter movement had been calling for the removal of Confederate flags and civil war statues from across the country
[03:05:13.640 --> 03:05:17.640]  But did you know 12 U.S. presidents own slaves including Ulysses S. Grant
[03:05:17.640 --> 03:05:26.640]  Now let's look at Woodrow Wilson here's a president that intentionally prolonged World War One at the behest of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace so America could be fundamentally changed
[03:05:26.640 --> 03:05:34.640]  And if you look at the transfer of wealth that has taken place since then a case could be made that Woodrow Wilson is probably the biggest purveyor of slavery in the United States
[03:05:34.640 --> 03:05:45.640]  He also signed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 the Federal Reserve is still printing up free money and bailing out banks the policies that he signed back in 1913 are keeping us all debt slaves today
[03:05:45.640 --> 03:05:51.640]  But you won't find any mention of Woodrow Wilson the Federal Reserve Act or debt slavery in the mainstream media
[03:05:51.640 --> 03:05:54.640]  You can see video of the statues being removed on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube

[03:08:25.640 --> 03:08:29.640]  Our community rates low on an information scale
[03:08:29.640 --> 03:08:36.640]  When the press, radio and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people
[03:08:36.640 --> 03:08:40.640]  Those who raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government
[03:08:40.640 --> 03:08:44.640]  That wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government
[03:08:44.640 --> 03:08:46.640]  They're asking such a question
[03:08:46.640 --> 03:08:48.640]  What difference at this point does it make?
[03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:52.640]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in the community
[03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:55.640]  He looks beyond fine words and noble phrases
[03:08:55.640 --> 03:08:59.640]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president
[03:08:59.640 --> 03:09:03.640]  That will help make our immigration system more fair and more just
[03:09:03.640 --> 03:09:06.640]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions
[03:09:06.640 --> 03:09:10.640]  What I say goes, see, I'm the law around here
[03:09:10.640 --> 03:09:15.640]  You came, you saw, you died
[03:09:15.640 --> 03:09:24.640]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons
[03:09:24.640 --> 03:09:26.640]  We just have to be repetitive about this
[03:09:26.640 --> 03:09:33.640]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way
[03:09:33.640 --> 03:09:36.640]  We are trained to deceive if we have to
[03:09:36.640 --> 03:09:38.640]  You really don't have to trust me, you shouldn't trust me
[03:09:38.640 --> 03:09:42.640]  In fact, if I'm actually participating in that, I will taint the news
[03:09:42.640 --> 03:09:46.640]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance
[03:09:46.640 --> 03:09:51.640]  The nine most terrifying words in the English language are
[03:09:51.640 --> 03:09:54.640]  I'm from the government and I'm here to help
[03:09:54.640 --> 03:09:57.640]  Okay, this youth, well, we're going to do everything we can to help you
[03:09:58.640 --> 03:10:02.640]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God
[03:10:02.640 --> 03:10:08.640]  It's the Alex Jones show because there is a war for your mind
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:14.640]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show
[03:10:14.640 --> 03:10:17.640]  This is Overdrive, we're going to start doing this regularly now
[03:10:17.640 --> 03:10:20.640]  So this will be five days a week, we'll be going into the fourth hour
[03:10:20.640 --> 03:10:25.640]  I'm your host Rob Do joined here, shotgun Leanne McAdoo wearing the wonderful
[03:10:25.640 --> 03:10:29.640]  Check that out, the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirt
[03:10:29.640 --> 03:10:32.640]  I remember seeing this on Twitter just a couple weeks ago
[03:10:32.640 --> 03:10:35.640]  People putting those signs in their yard and I guess people were tearing them out
[03:10:35.640 --> 03:10:36.640]  Right
[03:10:36.640 --> 03:10:38.640]  Because some people don't like free speech apparently
[03:10:38.640 --> 03:10:39.640]  Exactly
[03:10:39.640 --> 03:10:41.640]  So what do we do here? Double down
[03:10:41.640 --> 03:10:44.640]  Yeah, everyone needs to get this shirt and troll any Hillary event
[03:10:44.640 --> 03:10:49.640]  She'll probably make you turn it inside out because that's who's running for president
[03:10:49.640 --> 03:10:51.640]  To someone who's so against the First Amendment
[03:10:51.640 --> 03:10:57.640]  I want to see somebody and I'll personally give $100 to whoever goes and gets a Hillary
[03:10:57.640 --> 03:11:00.640]  For Prison 2016 shirt autographed
[03:11:00.640 --> 03:11:03.640]  I will send you $100 out of my pocket
[03:11:03.640 --> 03:11:06.640]  I have no money left but you have to shoot video of it
[03:11:06.640 --> 03:11:08.640]  And you have to let us use the video
[03:11:08.640 --> 03:11:12.640]  If you can get her signing that shirt, I'll give you $100
[03:11:12.640 --> 03:11:14.640]  Right out of my wallet
[03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:17.640]  Yeah, I'm curious as well if people at first glance if they're going to be like
[03:11:17.640 --> 03:11:20.640]  Oh, hooray, yeah, Hillary for President
[03:11:20.640 --> 03:11:23.640]  Yeah, they just don't really read things
[03:11:23.640 --> 03:11:25.640]  They just see the Hillary and they'll just go
[03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:28.640]  All right, $100 right there on the line
[03:11:28.640 --> 03:11:32.640]  Get your shirt today, go out to a Hillary event, get her to autograph it
[03:11:32.640 --> 03:11:33.640]  And give video of it
[03:11:33.640 --> 03:11:38.640]  And if you can stand it, we're selling these cackling Hillary pens here
[03:11:38.640 --> 03:11:40.640]  Oh, yeah
[03:11:40.640 --> 03:11:44.640]  Can you imagine if she's president and we have to listen to this every week
[03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:46.640]  That's what she said right after she killed Gaddafi
[03:11:46.640 --> 03:11:48.640]  He came, he saw, he died
[03:11:48.640 --> 03:11:50.640]  So let's tell you what we're going to do for this hour
[03:11:50.640 --> 03:11:55.640]  We're going to play a report really quick here on a John Bowne report that he did
[03:11:55.640 --> 03:11:58.640]  On George Soros about who this man is
[03:11:58.640 --> 03:12:02.640]  This is a great evergreen report, just like general knowledge of George Soros' background
[03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:09.640]  But at the bottom of the hour, we are going to really dig into this ninth Planned Parenthood video that has come out
[03:12:09.640 --> 03:12:15.640]  And also tie it in with an interview that David Knight did back in May and also in June with a nurse
[03:12:15.640 --> 03:12:20.640]  Talking about how they knew these vaccines would damage these poor, preemie babies
[03:12:20.640 --> 03:12:24.640]  They would come out, inject them with the vaccines, and then they would have incubators
[03:12:24.640 --> 03:12:29.640]  And I don't know the proper term, but they're like breathing machines that they stick on their face
[03:12:29.640 --> 03:12:32.640]  And I'll get the guys to look it up so I can, don't sound like an idiot
[03:12:32.640 --> 03:12:37.640]  But they have these ready for the kids because they know they're going to need them
[03:12:37.640 --> 03:12:42.640]  They say we have four preemies, get four beds ready because as soon as they get their shots, they're going to need them
[03:12:42.640 --> 03:12:45.640]  And this is horrible, this is what they're doing to our children
[03:12:45.640 --> 03:12:48.640]  And people out there, you have to stand up, you have to speak out
[03:12:48.640 --> 03:12:53.640]  You're responsible for this if you stay silent, you're just as culpable as the people running these programs
[03:12:53.640 --> 03:12:56.640]  And if you're a nurse and you're not speaking out, there's got to be something wrong with you
[03:12:56.640 --> 03:12:59.640]  Because you're there to help people, you're not there to hurt people
[03:12:59.640 --> 03:13:04.640]  And these vaccines and these kids are not helping the situation at all
[03:13:04.640 --> 03:13:07.640]  So we're going to get to that at the bottom of the hour, we're also going to take some phone calls
[03:13:07.640 --> 03:13:14.640]  I'm going to give everybody the phone number, we'll take a few phone calls when we come back, 800-259-9231
[03:13:14.640 --> 03:13:18.640]  That's 800-259-9231
[03:13:18.640 --> 03:13:24.640]  And let's go to that report now about who is George Soros, Darth Soros as they like to call him
[03:13:24.640 --> 03:13:30.640]  Every life matters, and that is why this issue is so important
[03:13:30.640 --> 03:13:35.640]  Black lives matter, white lives matter, all lives matter
[03:13:35.640 --> 03:13:37.640]  Black lives matter
[03:13:37.640 --> 03:13:45.640]  How long before Black Lives Matter protesters are chanting George Soros' Divide and Conquer scheme is what matters
[03:13:45.640 --> 03:13:53.640]  The Washington Times reports liberal billionaire George Soros has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in Europe
[03:13:53.640 --> 03:14:00.640]  While forging a political machine powered by non-profit foundations that impacts American politics and policy
[03:14:00.640 --> 03:14:03.640]  Not unlike what he did with MoveOn.org
[03:14:03.640 --> 03:14:14.640]  In all, Mr. Soros gave at least 33 million in one year to support already established groups that embolden the grassroots on-the-ground activists in Ferguson
[03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:20.640]  According to the most recent tax filings of his non-profit Open Society Foundations
[03:14:20.640 --> 03:14:27.640]  The sad fact is, one of the 30 richest people in the world, not an American civil rights leader
[03:14:27.640 --> 03:14:34.640]  Is funding a divide and conquer movement that has disrupted political speeches, places of business
[03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:39.640]  And the real progress Americans have made in the United States regarding race relations
[03:14:39.640 --> 03:14:43.640]  Meanwhile, Soros has fueled the division in Ukraine
[03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:48.640]  George Soros admitting he's behind the open border move and the illegals pouring in
[03:14:48.640 --> 03:14:51.640]  Admitting he's behind Ukraine saying, I did it
[03:14:51.640 --> 03:14:54.640]  Which I think he's taking too much credit, he's a big part of it
[03:14:54.640 --> 03:14:58.640]  Shane, they're part of the year of spring and turning loose all these groups
[03:14:58.640 --> 03:15:02.640]  I mean, on every front, George Soros
[03:15:02.640 --> 03:15:10.640]  If it was a racist nation, we would not have had the top guy ahead of law as a black man, Eric Holder
[03:15:10.640 --> 03:15:13.640]  And now Loretta Lynch, another black woman
[03:15:13.640 --> 03:15:19.640]  We would not have the head of the United Nations, it was Susan Rice
[03:15:19.640 --> 03:15:26.640]  We would not have a secretary of state as Congolese Rice or Colin Powell or others
[03:15:26.640 --> 03:15:29.640]  So let's not call it a racist nation
[03:15:29.640 --> 03:15:35.640]  If you want to point the finger, point it at Obama, point it at Holder
[03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:43.640]  Point it at that lowlife man who never convicted one head of the white shoe boys
[03:15:43.640 --> 03:15:45.640]  To white fear, Eric?
[03:15:45.640 --> 03:15:49.640]  And we are distracted, just as the cloward-piven strategy would have us
[03:15:49.640 --> 03:15:52.640]  Of course, all lives matter
[03:15:52.640 --> 03:15:55.640]  All lives matter
[03:15:55.640 --> 03:15:57.640]  All lives matter
[03:15:57.640 --> 03:16:00.640]  And I'm a black guy
[03:16:00.640 --> 03:16:02.640]  All lives matter
[03:16:02.640 --> 03:16:07.640]  Of course, chanting pigs in a blanket will lead to execution of police
[03:16:07.640 --> 03:16:09.640]  Pigs in a blanket, fry like bacon
[03:16:09.640 --> 03:16:12.640]  Pigs in a blanket, fry like bacon
[03:16:12.640 --> 03:16:23.640]  I don't think chanting or singing chants that are basically promoting killing police officers is peaceful
[03:16:23.640 --> 03:16:28.640]  And of course, inciting violence for the sake of violence is a trap
[03:16:28.640 --> 03:16:34.640]  I would prefer to be remembered as a person who was part of this resolution
[03:16:34.640 --> 03:16:39.640]  Kids being born in this country, we have to leave a legacy for them
[03:16:39.640 --> 03:16:44.640]  Something for them to, so it'll be easier for them to deal with problems, issues that come up
[03:16:44.640 --> 03:16:50.640]  Just like people that has made a movement towards peace and nonviolence all the way up to this point
[03:16:50.640 --> 03:16:52.640]  It's important that we keep that going
[03:16:52.640 --> 03:16:57.640]  Ultimately, the 13 million black babies that Soros supported being wiped out
[03:16:57.640 --> 03:17:04.640]  And the 41% welfare spending increase Obama has brought us are the real steps backwards
[03:17:04.640 --> 03:17:09.640]  And snared by the violent elite engineered full rights movement will eventually find themselves
[03:17:09.640 --> 03:17:15.640]  Eager participants in a divide and conquer takedown scheme of the American dream
[03:17:15.640 --> 03:17:19.640]  Funded by the very people responsible for the hostile environment
[03:17:19.640 --> 03:17:23.640]  The Black Lives Matter movement is fighting to escape from
[03:17:23.640 --> 03:17:24.640]  All lives matter
[03:17:24.640 --> 03:17:27.640]  That police officer that got killed by that black man
[03:17:27.640 --> 03:17:32.640]  Because that black man listened to what y'all were saying by going out and killing white people
[03:17:32.640 --> 03:17:34.640]  That police officer's life mattered
[03:17:34.640 --> 03:17:36.640]  That nine-year-old girl in Ferguson, Missouri
[03:17:36.640 --> 03:17:39.640]  That guy shot in the head while she was doing all homework
[03:17:39.640 --> 03:17:42.640]  In the drive-by shooting that none of y'all protested
[03:17:42.640 --> 03:17:43.640]  Her life mattered
[03:17:43.640 --> 03:17:49.640]  So governments like to split people up, categorize human beings, divide
[03:17:49.640 --> 03:17:50.640]  So they can conquer them
[03:17:50.640 --> 03:17:53.640]  There's people that don't even think that they can see the world
[03:17:53.640 --> 03:17:55.640]  Because they need permission to see the planet Earth
[03:17:55.640 --> 03:17:58.640]  John Baum for Enforce.com
[03:18:01.640 --> 03:18:05.640]  And I think that report really says it all about what we're dealing with
[03:18:05.640 --> 03:18:08.640]  We're dealing with these billionaires who don't want to pay taxes
[03:18:08.640 --> 03:18:11.640]  Who want to be above everyone else and control us
[03:18:11.640 --> 03:18:15.640]  And create a communist type system where they own property
[03:18:15.640 --> 03:18:19.640]  We're not allowed to own anything and we're treated like debt slaves
[03:18:19.640 --> 03:18:20.640]  Which they're almost there
[03:18:20.640 --> 03:18:21.640]  I mean everybody's in debt
[03:18:21.640 --> 03:18:24.640]  You don't really own your house because you're paying property taxes
[03:18:24.640 --> 03:18:25.640]  They can take it away from you?
[03:18:25.640 --> 03:18:26.640]  Exactly
[03:18:26.640 --> 03:18:30.640]  So their plan is definitely coming into fruition on a worldwide scale
[03:18:30.640 --> 03:18:31.640]  Not just country by country
[03:18:31.640 --> 03:18:34.640]  Which is how they used to go about doing this stuff
[03:18:34.640 --> 03:18:35.640]  So I think that's a great piece
[03:18:35.640 --> 03:18:38.640]  And it kind of lays the groundwork for where we're going to go
[03:18:38.640 --> 03:18:41.640]  Especially in the second half of the show
[03:18:41.640 --> 03:18:43.640]  Talking about this ninth Planned Parenthood video
[03:18:43.640 --> 03:18:47.640]  And then tying it in to what they're doing to the poor, preemie babies
[03:18:47.640 --> 03:18:50.640]  And how it's just a eugenics operation
[03:18:50.640 --> 03:18:52.640]  That's really all you could call it
[03:18:52.640 --> 03:18:53.640]  You can't say much else
[03:18:53.640 --> 03:18:57.640]  Now, before we get into those stories
[03:18:57.640 --> 03:18:59.640]  I guess we'll lighten the mood just a little bit
[03:18:59.640 --> 03:19:02.640]  There's a story that came out
[03:19:02.640 --> 03:19:04.640]  And the title of this is
[03:19:04.640 --> 03:19:07.640]  DARPA's Next Generation of Super Zombie Soldiers
[03:19:07.640 --> 03:19:09.640]  I guess I'm really not going to make it any lighter
[03:19:09.640 --> 03:19:12.640]  DARPA, an agency under the U.S. Department of Defense
[03:19:12.640 --> 03:19:14.640]  Has started a heavily funded project
[03:19:14.640 --> 03:19:16.640]  That aims to enhance human ability in war zones
[03:19:16.640 --> 03:19:19.640]  By altering the genetic code of their soldiers
[03:19:19.640 --> 03:19:21.640]  They hope to achieve supremacy by making soldiers
[03:19:21.640 --> 03:19:24.640]  That are stronger, smarter, more focused
[03:19:24.640 --> 03:19:25.640]  Well, that all seems good
[03:19:25.640 --> 03:19:26.640]  Oh, and lack empathy
[03:19:26.640 --> 03:19:27.640]  Yes
[03:19:27.640 --> 03:19:29.640]  By the way, and lack empathy is
[03:19:29.640 --> 03:19:32.640]  Zero empathy so they can kill women and children
[03:19:32.640 --> 03:19:34.640]  That's what's coming your way
[03:19:34.640 --> 03:19:37.640]  That in addition to the drones that have no empathy
[03:19:37.640 --> 03:19:40.640]  So they're looking to create humanoid drones

[03:20:32.640 --> 03:20:34.640]  They're worried someday ISIS may get here

[03:20:42.640 --> 03:20:44.640]  If they don't know ISIS as you already
[03:20:44.640 --> 03:20:45.640]  They got no clue

[03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:34.440]  even threw down the gauntlet for a challenge which I'll talk about at the
[03:24:34.440 --> 03:24:38.000]  end of the show. Now real quick, this is a story that came out last week. Associated
[03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:44.320]  Press sues FBI over fake news story. So basically the FBI put up a fake, they
[03:24:44.320 --> 03:24:47.360]  wrote a fake story, made it look like it was from a mainstream media outlet, sent
[03:24:47.360 --> 03:24:51.640]  it to this kid's MySpace account so then they could then get a geo-locate on him
[03:24:51.640 --> 03:24:55.400]  and then go after him. They said he called in some bomb threats but the AP is
[03:24:55.400 --> 03:24:59.040]  now suing them for doing this because they made it look like it was an AP
[03:24:59.040 --> 03:25:04.720]  article. So and here's the FBI director says we do not use deception or we do
[03:25:04.720 --> 03:25:09.240]  use deception at times to catch crooks. At times. You know, this is the way we do
[03:25:09.240 --> 03:25:12.640]  it. I'm sure that was the only time though that that. Oh yeah, they don't know
[03:25:12.640 --> 03:25:16.280]  any other time. Not with informants, not with anything else. Hey, so let's go to
[03:25:16.280 --> 03:25:19.320]  Stephen in Florida. You've been holding the longest war against each other in the
[03:25:19.320 --> 03:25:29.560]  Planned Parenthood. What do you have to say, buddy? Yeah, good afternoon. Hey, first of all, Rob, I just wanted to say, I hope you understand that you're sitting next to the most
[03:25:29.560 --> 03:25:49.960]  attractive and intelligent woman in the media in America today. Thank you. Here's what I want to say. I sent you a lengthy email yesterday and I wanted to just mention part of what I said for the listeners benefit. Okay, I'm going to show you the
[03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:57.040]  connection between this whole war that they're now pushing and Jade Helm and Planned
[03:25:57.040 --> 03:26:03.160]  Parenthood and what's come out about them. I follow this. Jakali did a report about two
[03:26:03.160 --> 03:26:08.600]  months ago on Jade Helm. Really, really good. And then when Alex came back on, it
[03:26:08.600 --> 03:26:13.680]  was a prerecorded report. Alex came back on and gave his commentary and he made
[03:26:13.680 --> 03:26:17.080]  this statement. And when he said this, boy, this really clicked to put a lot of
[03:26:17.080 --> 03:26:21.920]  pieces together for me of what's been going on. He said that what this is Jade
[03:26:21.920 --> 03:26:27.880]  Helm is about with Master the Human Domain is a route using the military to
[03:26:27.880 --> 03:26:35.640]  round up Americans. Now, what is Monsanto, who's you guys are covering a lot?
[03:26:35.640 --> 03:26:40.840]  Mentioned today, the GMOs and all what they're doing, nanotech. What is the
[03:26:40.840 --> 03:26:49.600]  flagship product called? Roundup. Roundup. Okay. Now, which is what?
[03:26:49.600 --> 03:26:56.160]  It's a weed killer. It's a weed killer. Now, Margaret Fanger, the founder of
[03:26:56.160 --> 03:27:00.560]  Planned Parenthood. Called Black People Weeds. Made it clear that one of her
[03:27:00.560 --> 03:27:05.600]  reasons for founding that organization was eugenics, which she termed as
[03:27:05.600 --> 03:27:11.240]  exterminating the what? The weed. The weeds, yeah. The human race. Okay. And now you
[03:27:11.240 --> 03:27:15.920]  look at what's coming out with Planned Parenthood, with all these videos, you put
[03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:20.240]  that all together. And what you've got is I really have come to the conclusion of
[03:27:20.240 --> 03:27:25.480]  believing that GMO, not only stands for genetically modified organisms, but
[03:27:25.480 --> 03:27:33.600]  global military or murder operation. Wow. Hey Steve, that is very astute. Thank you.
[03:27:33.600 --> 03:27:37.680]  I'm gonna check your email again. If I didn't respond back to it, I'll check it
[03:27:37.680 --> 03:27:40.320]  out. And I'd like to look at more of what you have to say. Thank you for that.
[03:27:40.320 --> 03:27:44.360]  Very much. Let's go to Zach next. He's in Virginia. He's got talking about a new
[03:27:44.360 --> 03:27:50.000]  ISIS video. Zach, what's going on? Hey Robin, how are you doing? I'm fine. It's
[03:27:50.000 --> 03:27:53.320]  about an hour long video and you know, starts out talking bad about the
[03:27:53.320 --> 03:27:56.640]  financial reserve and then talks about, you know, the fractional reserve banking
[03:27:56.640 --> 03:28:00.840]  and then it gets on to, you know, just everything that, you know, libertarians, you
[03:28:00.840 --> 03:28:07.240]  know, see his issues. That's probably CIA made. I haven't watched it yet.
[03:28:07.240 --> 03:28:10.960]  But to start discrediting the Liberty Movement saying we're in league with ISIS
[03:28:10.960 --> 03:28:13.600]  because that's a narrative they want to push, but continue. Well, they're pushing
[03:28:13.600 --> 03:28:22.200]  their own money. Right. Go ahead, Zach. Paul. It like has a snippet of Ron Paul
[03:28:22.200 --> 03:28:25.840]  using Ron Paul kind of has like a guy they should look to and then it shows
[03:28:25.840 --> 03:28:29.600]  the info was a report with a, you remember the documentary with Edward
[03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:36.480]  Griffin? Yeah, it has that exact video, you know, cut and put into this video, you
[03:28:36.480 --> 03:28:42.400]  know, the denar, how they're minting the gold denar. Right. Right. It's the
[03:28:42.400 --> 03:28:45.920]  ISIS video to kind of, you know, promote them. Like they're handing out their
[03:28:45.920 --> 03:28:49.800]  coins, you know, the citizens who they clearly bribed, you know, say they love
[03:28:49.800 --> 03:28:54.080]  it. Well, yeah, that of course. Yeah. Dyer or say, say you love it or get thrown
[03:28:54.080 --> 03:28:59.720]  off a roof or getting put into a firing squad. Yeah. That is all created to, to
[03:28:59.720 --> 03:29:02.760]  give the impression that the Liberty Movement is in league with ISIS, which
[03:29:02.760 --> 03:29:05.760]  is something that the sheriff's groups are even talking about in some of these
[03:29:05.760 --> 03:29:09.640]  states, like the sheriff up in Spokane, Washington. Yeah. That those radical
[03:29:09.640 --> 03:29:14.080]  ideas are all right. Yeah. And that's complete. That's further from the truth.
[03:29:14.200 --> 03:29:18.120]  Getting rid of the Federal Reserve is a terroristic idea. Right. Exactly. That's
[03:29:18.120 --> 03:29:22.480]  to make anybody that wants to say the Fed is bad and go after them. All right. So
[03:29:22.520 --> 03:29:25.480]  we're going to be back and we're going to get into this ninth Planned
[03:29:25.480 --> 03:29:29.400]  Parenthood video and tie it into the whole eugenics operation with what they
[03:29:29.400 --> 03:29:32.600]  do to these poor, creamy babies when they're born after they want to inject
[03:29:32.600 --> 03:29:36.360]  them with disgusting toxic vaccines. It really makes me sick. What they're
[03:29:36.360 --> 03:29:40.560]  doing. It's a low overdrive hour with Rob Do and Liam Acidoo. We're sitting
[03:29:40.560 --> 03:29:42.920]  here firing it will be right back.
[03:29:48.200 --> 03:29:54.480]  We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[03:29:54.480 --> 03:29:55.000]  network.
[03:29:59.040 --> 03:30:03.080]  Do you know what it means to be an American? It's more than a flag. It's
[03:30:03.080 --> 03:30:07.520]  more than knowing the Star Spangled Banner. It's knowing the Constitution. It's
[03:30:07.520 --> 03:30:11.720]  understanding those rights and fighting for them. Our country is falling apart
[03:30:11.720 --> 03:30:16.040]  because people have forgotten to fight to stand up in the face of tyranny and do
[03:30:16.040 --> 03:30:20.080]  the right thing is putting your life on the line to protect your country from
[03:30:20.080 --> 03:30:24.080]  enemies, both foreign and domestic. The Bill of Rights is what the people are
[03:30:24.080 --> 03:30:29.400]  entitled to against every government and no government should refuse or rest on
[03:30:29.400 --> 03:30:33.960]  inference. So the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the
[03:30:33.960 --> 03:30:38.880]  blood of patriots and tyrants. I'm Joe Biggs with infowars.com and I believe
[03:30:38.880 --> 03:30:43.560]  our flag is more than cloth and ink. It is a symbol that stands for liberty and
[03:30:43.560 --> 03:30:47.880]  freedom. It is a history of our nation and it's marked by the blood of those who
[03:30:47.880 --> 03:30:52.760]  died defending it. So join me in this info war, turn off your TV, put your
[03:30:52.760 --> 03:30:55.960]  cheetos down, get off your butt and join the resistance.

[03:34:16.840 --> 03:34:20.960]  place to start is in game and you know one way to start fighting this stuff is
[03:34:20.960 --> 03:34:23.600]  to get in your body healthy and that's cleansing yourself out of
[03:34:23.600 --> 03:34:27.880]  all the nasty stuff that's inside and this is a product that we came out
[03:34:27.880 --> 03:34:32.080]  with a few months ago. We just got it back in, deep cleanse and the first
[03:34:32.080 --> 03:34:38.640]  ingredient on here, shilajit. It is an amazing, it's like say if the earth was a
[03:34:38.640 --> 03:34:46.200]  giant like press and it was pressing out like you know like a resin substance
[03:34:46.200 --> 03:34:51.800]  that has all kinds of ingredients in it and that are good for you. That do
[03:34:51.800 --> 03:34:57.200]  things like you know, chelate your body, cleansing, all that type of stuff. That is
[03:34:57.200 --> 03:35:00.520]  what shilajit is. That's the number one ingredient in deep cleanse and I actually
[03:35:00.520 --> 03:35:04.480]  sat down with Dr. Group about a month ago, maybe a month and a half ago and we did
[03:35:04.480 --> 03:35:08.480]  a video about the blood of the Mountain Savior. Can y'all pull back and show
[03:35:08.480 --> 03:35:12.360]  them the title of that so people who are watching on infowords.com forward slash
[03:35:12.360 --> 03:35:16.760]  show can actually go and check out that video for themselves because this stuff
[03:35:16.760 --> 03:35:22.160]  really, it comes from the Himalayas. They scrape it off by hand and get this kind
[03:35:22.160 --> 03:35:26.760]  of resin that is pressed from the rock. Secret rock blood of the Himalayas
[03:35:26.760 --> 03:35:32.520]  revealed and that's on the info where that's a one of our sub channels but
[03:35:32.520 --> 03:35:35.920]  you can also find it on the Alex Jones channel. Didn't Dr. Group say he was
[03:35:35.920 --> 03:35:42.520]  actually searching for that ingredient for over 10 years. It's really intense.
[03:35:42.520 --> 03:35:46.520]  Exactly. It doesn't just walk its way out of the mountains. You really have to
[03:35:46.520 --> 03:35:52.680]  plan ahead. This just came out on infowords.com from Kit Daniels. Democrats
[03:35:52.680 --> 03:35:57.560]  hire illegal alien to recruit new voters. No wonder this nation has a border and
[03:35:57.560 --> 03:36:01.400]  illegal alien crisis judicial wash said and its response. So that just came out.
[03:36:01.400 --> 03:36:06.480]  I haven't even looked at this yet but it says DNC hired Cindy Navel with full
[03:36:06.480 --> 03:36:09.880]  knowledge of her undocumented status. The government watchdog reported pointing
[03:36:09.880 --> 03:36:13.080]  out that federal law prohibits foreign nationals from contributing directly or
[03:36:13.080 --> 03:36:17.520]  indirectly in the decision-making process of federal state and local election
[03:36:17.520 --> 03:36:21.520]  related activities. You covered that last night with a project Veritas video, didn't
[03:36:21.520 --> 03:36:26.120]  you? Yes, that they were. There was a Canadian woman that wanted to buy some
[03:36:26.120 --> 03:36:34.600]  merch there. Hillary Clinton's biggest campaign event yet and that is seen as
[03:36:34.600 --> 03:36:39.360]  foreign money being put into the campaigns because merchandise is seen as a
[03:36:39.360 --> 03:36:44.840]  you know it's a campaign donation basically. So in order to skirt past that
[03:36:44.840 --> 03:36:49.400]  she handed the money to an American woman and let her make the purchase.
[03:36:49.400 --> 03:36:56.520]  And it was Hillary's compliance manager who made it all good. So this is the
[03:36:56.520 --> 03:37:00.600]  first event and the compliance manager. Little did they know Project Veritas was
[03:37:00.600 --> 03:37:04.240]  there with the hidden camera to showcase. She was the American. I know she was the
[03:37:04.240 --> 03:37:07.440]  American. It was ridiculous. Alright now let's get something serious. Oh by the
[03:37:07.440 --> 03:37:10.720]  way we're gonna have the money bomb on September 16th. That's another way you
[03:37:10.720 --> 03:37:15.320]  can support us. We're are getting ready to do a major expansion. We're actually
[03:37:15.320 --> 03:37:19.600]  gonna redo one of the old studios. The first Nightly New Studio. We're revamping
[03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:23.680]  it and we're gonna be launching this baby four hours of the Alex Jones show. One
[03:37:23.680 --> 03:37:26.680]  hour of the Nightly News starting. That's gonna be our starting point, our
[03:37:26.680 --> 03:37:30.440]  launch point to go on satellite. So everybody around the nation could pick
[03:37:30.440 --> 03:37:34.320]  this up on their television set. Yeah, spreading the word. One way to break the
[03:37:34.320 --> 03:37:38.280]  paradigm is to get people thinking outside the box and not just confined to
[03:37:38.280 --> 03:37:44.120]  the left-right paradigm mantra that were sold from box news and CNN and MSNBC
[03:37:44.120 --> 03:37:47.720]  and all those of those. That's how we can talk about the Planned Parenthood story
[03:37:47.720 --> 03:37:52.840]  because we are funded by the viewers like you. And the viewers want to hear about
[03:37:52.840 --> 03:37:55.920]  stuff like this because they're sick and tired of it being pushed under the rug
[03:37:55.920 --> 03:38:01.920]  and not covered by the mainstream media. Here it is from Steve Ertlett from
[03:38:01.920 --> 03:38:05.960]  Life News. Ninth shocking video. Planned Parenthood sells intact abortive babies.
[03:38:05.960 --> 03:38:10.520]  One just fell out of the womb and we're gonna go to that clip first. But Leanne,
[03:38:10.520 --> 03:38:14.920]  let's, before we do that, recap the other videos. There's eight other videos that
[03:38:14.920 --> 03:38:18.960]  each one seems to just get more shocking as they come out. Right. Well, the
[03:38:18.960 --> 03:38:22.280]  ninth one was just released. So you'll recall, you know, they talk about being
[03:38:22.280 --> 03:38:26.960]  really good at getting the heart, lungs, and liver. Then we had another crushing
[03:38:26.960 --> 03:38:30.480]  the head. Yeah, we don't crush them. You know, a less crunchy technique is what
[03:38:30.480 --> 03:38:34.760]  we'll use. The other, the next, the second video, the lady said that she wanted a
[03:38:34.760 --> 03:38:40.320]  Lamborghini. That was the big hashtag trending on Twitter. Then in the third
[03:38:40.320 --> 03:38:44.880]  video, we saw former STEM Express employee Holly O'Donnell talking about how
[03:38:44.880 --> 03:38:52.200]  she fainted in horror overhandling baby legs and all these parts. And then in
[03:38:52.200 --> 03:38:55.680]  the fourth one, they talk about how they don't want to, you know, sell these baby
[03:38:55.680 --> 03:39:00.520]  parts for a flat fee of just like 200 bucks per item works better because then
[03:39:00.520 --> 03:39:07.120]  they can see how much money they can get out of it. And then the fifth video, they
[03:39:07.120 --> 03:39:10.800]  just basically are talking about how good they are at getting intact fetal
[03:39:10.800 --> 03:39:16.200]  cadavers and how the research department there basically adds so much to the
[03:39:16.200 --> 03:39:21.040]  bottom line. They're one of the biggest affiliates in the state. In the sixth
[03:39:21.040 --> 03:39:26.120]  video, technicians, the Holly O'Donnell once again is talking about technicians
[03:39:26.120 --> 03:39:31.120]  taking fetal parts without patient consent. She said there were times when
[03:39:31.120 --> 03:39:34.720]  they would just take what they wanted and these mothers didn't know and there's no
[03:39:34.720 --> 03:39:38.240]  way they would know, right? Like, how are you? I mean, you're expecting them to have
[03:39:38.240 --> 03:39:42.160]  ethics to say, oh, the mother didn't sign off, but she was okay with us taking this
[03:39:42.160 --> 03:39:46.440]  baby part. So we'll leave that. Yeah, right. Not when there's a lot of money to be
[03:39:46.440 --> 03:39:51.840]  made. And then in the seventh video, Holly O'Donnell describes the harvesting or
[03:39:51.840 --> 03:39:57.240]  procurement of these organs and how one of the doctors there was like, you want
[03:39:57.240 --> 03:40:01.960]  to see something cool and then tapped the heart and had the heart start beating
[03:40:01.960 --> 03:40:06.920]  once again. Yeah, so it just starts beating and that was when she really was
[03:40:06.920 --> 03:40:11.160]  like, I got to get out of here. And then the eighth video, a STEM Express CEO,
[03:40:11.160 --> 03:40:17.200]  Kate Dyer admits, Planned Parenthood sells a lot of fully intact, aborted babies.
[03:40:17.200 --> 03:40:20.880]  They're the volume institution where they're getting all this from. It's like
[03:40:20.880 --> 03:40:24.760]  the most disgusting version of the island of Dr. Moreau that you could come up
[03:40:24.760 --> 03:40:30.760]  with. And this ninth video focuses in on ABR, which was founded in 1989 by CEO
[03:40:30.760 --> 03:40:37.040]  Linda Tracy, charges $340 per second trimester fetal tissue specimen, yet seems
[03:40:37.040 --> 03:40:41.400]  less concerned about the tissue quality, other quality than other harvesting
[03:40:41.400 --> 03:40:45.040]  companies. So whenever we have a smooth portion of liver, she says, we think
[03:40:45.040 --> 03:40:48.880]  that's good. So that's a, that's Lartin that wasn't attributed to her. So let's
[03:40:48.880 --> 03:40:52.400]  go to that first video. Let's play that and we're going to continue on trudging
[03:40:52.400 --> 03:40:57.480]  through this whole point is not to have a live birth. And so the, so the doctors
[03:40:57.480 --> 03:41:02.520]  have all, unless it's somebody who has had six pregnancies and six vaginal
[03:41:02.520 --> 03:41:07.320]  delivery, they put lambs in and she comes in the next morning and I literally
[03:41:07.320 --> 03:41:11.840]  have had women come in and they'll go on the OR and they're back out in three
[03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:17.040]  minutes. Oh yeah. The fetus was already in the vaginal canal whenever the food
[03:41:17.040 --> 03:41:22.920]  putters served, it just fell out. Oh yeah. The fetus was already in the vaginal canal
[03:41:22.920 --> 03:41:30.120]  whenever the food putter. And, and ABR stands for advanced bioscience resources.
[03:41:30.120 --> 03:41:35.880]  So hiding it in plain view, you know, they're not saying baby harvested ink, but
[03:41:36.280 --> 03:41:40.920]  just disgusting the way they do this. And this next video talks about how, oh,
[03:41:41.320 --> 03:41:44.240]  guess what? It was the bushes that created the loophole that allowed them to
[03:41:44.240 --> 03:41:47.960]  do this. What a surprise. I remember that I was very young then, but I remember
[03:41:47.960 --> 03:41:52.760]  there was this whole uproar about, and everyone was really angry about doing
[03:41:52.760 --> 03:41:55.960]  this research on these embryonic stem cells. It was all about stem cells,
[03:41:55.960 --> 03:42:01.520]  stem cell, and kind of like look over here and we'll preserve the fetal tissue.
[03:42:01.520 --> 03:42:04.840]  Right. Because that's what they really, it's all lawyer talk. Yeah. It's all
[03:42:04.840 --> 03:42:07.240]  lawyer talk. It really is. So let's go to that video now.
[03:42:09.640 --> 03:42:15.720]  Because of what we do, because we use fetal tissue, we don't want to, we want
[03:42:15.720 --> 03:42:19.640]  to be as politically correct as we can. Right. I know. We don't want a lot of people
[03:42:19.640 --> 03:42:24.600]  coming in and you know, yeah, because yeah, you're doing this and you're
[03:42:24.600 --> 03:42:27.800]  getting all these scientific people here and they're all agreeing. Yeah.
[03:42:27.800 --> 03:42:31.960]  Yeah. It's kind of counterintuitive, isn't it? Right. Like normally like embryonic
[03:42:31.960 --> 03:42:34.760]  stem cells are like the big controversial, like whatever. And like,
[03:42:34.760 --> 03:42:39.480]  And you know what the really weird thing is? Ambrionic, there's still a lot of
[03:42:39.480 --> 03:42:43.720]  controversy about that, you know, but then fetal kind of got lost in the mix.
[03:42:43.720 --> 03:42:46.760]  You know, was it ever carnivorous? I mean, I'm young, so I don't know.
[03:42:46.760 --> 03:42:53.000]  It was never, it was never outlawed, where during the Bush
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:43:01.000]  Administration, Bush 1, it was no federal funding could go to stem cell
[03:43:01.000 --> 03:43:07.000]  research or to embryonic cell research. The fetal tissue was taken out of that.
[03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:12.040]  So we continued to send tissue to people like NIH, even though the government
[03:43:12.040 --> 03:43:17.160]  was paying for it, fetal tissue weren't put in that little box of embryonic
[03:43:17.160 --> 03:43:23.080]  because it's different. Now they're trying to make abortion illegal and
[03:43:23.080 --> 03:43:27.640]  that's where we get our tissue. Now they're trying to make abortion illegal
[03:43:27.640 --> 03:43:31.400]  and that's where we get our tissue. That's gonna, I'm gonna be out of a job.
[03:43:31.400 --> 03:43:35.080]  I'm not gonna be able to harvest babies anymore. Yeah. Well, I think you could
[03:43:35.080 --> 03:43:41.400]  call this, this whole section, George Bush's abortion loophole exposed
[03:43:41.400 --> 03:43:44.920]  because they, I don't know if they get enough credit for this.
[03:43:44.920 --> 03:43:48.520]  They like to hide behind their pro-life stance, but they really aren't.
[03:43:48.520 --> 03:43:53.800]  They really left the gates open for this whole industry to just flourish
[03:43:53.800 --> 03:43:59.720]  of harvesting abortive babies. And the mothers, it's like what Alex said,
[03:43:59.720 --> 03:44:03.240]  the mothers aren't getting any money from this at all. They don't see any
[03:44:03.240 --> 03:44:08.040]  benefit. It's just these companies that are perched over these abortivaries
[03:44:08.040 --> 03:44:11.960]  like vultures just ready to pick apart baby carcasses.
[03:44:11.960 --> 03:44:16.920]  Right. Well, and the Planned Parenthood CEO, they sent a letter to Congress
[03:44:16.920 --> 03:44:21.880]  this August 27th where they talk about how they currently received just $60
[03:44:21.880 --> 03:44:25.880]  per tissue specimen. So you're thinking, oh, you know, that's not that.
[03:44:25.880 --> 03:44:29.880]  Well, per tissue specimen, so that means a leg,
[03:44:29.880 --> 03:44:34.680]  an arm, a liver, a heart, a head, anything that they're able to chop up
[03:44:34.680 --> 03:44:38.760]  and ship off. And turn into a specimen. They're getting at the bare minimum
[03:44:38.760 --> 03:44:43.640]  $60 per that. So it's, I mean, they're making hundreds of dollars.
[03:44:43.640 --> 03:44:48.120]  And it adds up and who knows where it's getting
[03:44:48.120 --> 03:44:51.720]  chopped up from there. It's really disturbing to talk about this.
[03:44:51.720 --> 03:44:55.480]  Now, so after the, so say the baby comes out and it's a preemie and it's alive,
[03:44:55.480 --> 03:44:58.520]  well, we got to keep it alive. Well, now they're injecting them with vaccines,
[03:44:58.520 --> 03:45:01.400]  even though before they said we were not injecting preemies with these.
[03:45:01.400 --> 03:45:05.000]  Now it's just like every baby that's born has to get a vaccine. I think the UK just
[03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:08.440]  passed something where they want to give the hepatitis B
[03:45:08.440 --> 03:45:11.640]  right when they're born. I'm not sure if it's that. I'll have to look in one
[03:45:11.640 --> 03:45:15.160]  second, but they just passed a new law where they want to make it mandatory.
[03:45:15.160 --> 03:45:18.520]  But here we have two articles that are written by Jeffrey Jackson
[03:45:18.520 --> 03:45:22.200]  for infowars.com. On May 5th, Nurse Reveals Routine
[03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:25.560]  Vaccine Induced Injuries talks about how the nurses are all aware that these
[03:45:25.560 --> 03:45:29.000]  vaccine induced injuries happen and they're ready for it.
[03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:32.440]  They just, it's no big deal because they're ready to help the baby when it's
[03:45:32.440 --> 03:45:37.000]  having breathing problems or it can't breathe or eat on its own after that.
[03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:41.960]  And then later we, we got confirmation on it. So new JAMA study confirms nurse
[03:45:41.960 --> 03:45:47.240]  whistleblower routine hospital vaccine damage happening to infants. This is a,
[03:45:47.240 --> 03:45:52.200]  came out June 22nd. David Knight had the nurse on again, Michelle Routon.
[03:45:52.200 --> 03:45:56.280]  So this is the second interview he had on with her. I think when this came out,
[03:45:56.280 --> 03:45:59.880]  we have so much news that comes out. We didn't even realize how big it was.
[03:45:59.880 --> 03:46:03.400]  It, it took Jeffrey Jackson grabbing and said, Hey guys, this is a big deal.
[03:46:03.400 --> 03:46:06.040]  Check it out. And it is a big deal. And that's why we're talking about it again
[03:46:06.040 --> 03:46:10.040]  today and tying how it ties into this whole eugenics package, how they see us.
[03:46:10.040 --> 03:46:13.800]  Just like the color C said, they see us as weeds. So let's go to that video.
[03:46:13.800 --> 03:46:16.920]  This is about four and a half to five minutes from that longer,
[03:46:18.200 --> 03:46:21.880]  longer interview that was, that's up on YouTube now, but check it out.
[03:46:21.880 --> 03:46:24.760]  This is David Knight interviewing Michelle Routon.
[03:46:24.760 --> 03:46:29.240]  Well, I had mentioned that they go ahead and vaccinate
[03:46:29.240 --> 03:46:33.800]  premature infants on time, meaning that once they are two months old,
[03:46:33.800 --> 03:46:38.520]  they're ready for their two month vaccines, regardless of the fact that they may still
[03:46:38.520 --> 03:46:42.280]  have supposed to have been inside their mother's stomachs and not even born yet.
[03:46:43.160 --> 03:46:49.800]  And some of the things that we're seeing and are being said is are things like
[03:46:49.800 --> 03:46:58.120]  a neonatologist calling from the step down unit down to level three to the more intensive unit
[03:46:58.120 --> 03:47:04.920]  saying, Hey, I'm going to give these four babies their two month vaccines this weekend.
[03:47:04.920 --> 03:47:08.680]  So I just want to make sure you get four beds ready because we know they're all going to have
[03:47:08.680 --> 03:47:12.840]  issues and need increased care. And that was bombshell information because
[03:47:13.720 --> 03:47:18.760]  that violates one of the core ethics of the medical foundation, a profession that we've
[03:47:18.760 --> 03:47:23.640]  always seen. And that is first do no harm. They knew this was going to harm the children,
[03:47:23.640 --> 03:47:27.880]  but they were going to go ahead and blindly or follow this schedule.
[03:47:29.480 --> 03:47:34.280]  Absolutely. You know, and I mentioned that I had sat in a call room before with a bunch of
[03:47:34.280 --> 03:47:41.480]  providers saying, Hey, we have this 25 weaker that was so strong, they never required intubation
[03:47:41.480 --> 03:47:47.240]  with a breathing tube to actually go onto the vent at a less invasive type respiratory support.
[03:47:47.240 --> 03:47:51.560]  And you come in and they're like, Oh, how embarrassing we gave that baby is two month
[03:47:51.560 --> 03:47:55.160]  immunizations. And now he's intubated on the bed for the first time. Oops.
[03:47:55.800 --> 03:48:00.760]  Yeah, it's just kind of blown off. That was amazing. So you told us that on May 1st.
[03:48:00.760 --> 03:48:05.880]  And then you contacted me last week and told me about this JAMA study, a journal of American
[03:48:05.880 --> 03:48:13.000]  Medical Association, the official organization of MDs. And here they do a study about the
[03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:18.600]  adverse effects after routine immunization of extremely low birth weight infants. Tell us
[03:48:18.600 --> 03:48:26.040]  about that study. Well, first, extremely low birth weight infants are 28 weeks in gestation or less
[03:48:26.040 --> 03:48:35.640]  or under 1000 grams, approximately 2.2 pounds or less at birth. And you had a group of physicians
[03:48:35.640 --> 03:48:42.760]  and a practitioner that went into a database of a large neonatology corporation with almost
[03:48:42.760 --> 03:48:50.920]  14,000 infants looked at and what the results said were that the set they were looking at the
[03:48:50.920 --> 03:48:57.320]  pre immunization period versus the post immunization period and their sepsis workups went up 3.7
[03:48:57.320 --> 03:49:03.640]  times in the post immunization period and sepsis means a blood infection. And so there's multiple
[03:49:03.640 --> 03:49:09.480]  labs drawn blood cultures, urine cultures, they go ahead and they start those babies on antibiotics
[03:49:09.480 --> 03:49:14.520]  right away while they wait for results. So it's not a benign thing. Yeah, it's nice threatening,
[03:49:14.520 --> 03:49:21.720]  isn't it? Right, it's like threatening. And even if it ends up not being an infection, they've still
[03:49:21.720 --> 03:49:27.720]  had pain, they've had invasive procedures and they've had antibiotics given, which is not a
[03:49:27.720 --> 03:49:34.440]  benign thing for these babies, very sensitive intestines. And so it's a big deal. And then
[03:49:34.440 --> 03:49:41.240]  we had increased respiratory support two times higher in the post immunization period. And then
[03:49:41.240 --> 03:49:45.800]  intubation actually getting intubated with a breathing tube and going on the vent was about
[03:49:46.600 --> 03:49:54.280]  1.7, 1.8 times higher. And what really shocked me, I had to read it about three times was when I
[03:49:54.280 --> 03:50:00.680]  got down to the conclusion, they said, based on this, there was no difference in reaction between
[03:50:00.680 --> 03:50:07.400]  single shots and combo shots. And so you can just go ahead and keep giving the combo vaccines.
[03:50:07.400 --> 03:50:12.680]  Yeah, it's no big deal. No big deal at all. Just keep giving the shots to the kids because we have
[03:50:12.680 --> 03:50:16.600]  to keep them on that schedule. That schedule is the most important thing. It doesn't matter if
[03:50:16.600 --> 03:50:20.520]  there's adverse reactions because we have the technology to keep them alive so we could give
[03:50:20.520 --> 03:50:25.960]  them more shots. That's how evil it is. Oh, it's I'm so afraid of having a child in this country
[03:50:25.960 --> 03:50:31.480]  right now. Well, you know what? It's actually not hard to not get your kid vaccinated. It's not
[03:50:31.480 --> 03:50:37.560]  very hard. You can do it. There's plenty of people out there that do it. Yeah. So if you think that
[03:50:37.560 --> 03:50:42.680]  they're there for your health, they're not. They're there to push big farmers' products on you. So
[03:50:42.680 --> 03:50:46.120]  we'll be right back after this. We're going to take these last four callers that are here,
[03:50:46.120 --> 03:50:51.320]  Cash, Taylor, Dave, Kylo. Stay tuned. We're going to go to your calls. We're wrapping up the fourth
[03:50:51.320 --> 03:50:57.240]  hour of overdrive on the Alex Jones show. Rob Do, Leigh Ann McAdoo here with you till three o'clock.

[03:51:09.160 --> 03:51:13.400]  Oh, I know. I was told no more hard labor. Then why are you digging?
[03:51:13.400 --> 03:51:17.000]  Well, I've been taking Extendivite. It's been approved to help my heart.
[03:51:17.000 --> 03:51:22.680]  Extendivite. Is that a new drug? No, not a drug. It's more like an herbal
[03:51:22.680 --> 03:51:27.480]  combination made from garlic and cayenne. Herbal? How can that help? Well, actually,
[03:51:27.480 --> 03:51:31.720]  we've taken herbs for thousands of years. Extendivite is doing the job for me.
[03:51:31.720 --> 03:51:36.600]  Does your doctor know about Extendivite? Yeah, my doctor knows, and he said it seems to be working
[03:51:36.600 --> 03:51:41.800]  for you, so don't stop taking it. I feel great taking Extendivite. I don't want to stop. To order,

[03:54:15.560 --> 03:54:23.640]  I'm not a crook. Everybody knows the war is over. I'm Rob Dew reporting in the voice of Richard Nixon.
[03:54:25.000 --> 03:54:30.680]  Actually, I'm Alex Jones here. Rob Dew is working on a breaking story. Actually, he had a meeting
[03:54:30.680 --> 03:54:34.600]  already scheduled before this all happened when I say he's gonna start hosting the fourth hour.
[03:54:34.600 --> 03:54:37.880]  So he'd forgotten he had that meeting so he ran into the meeting. He was already about 20
[03:54:37.880 --> 03:54:42.200]  minutes late too. He's doing a great job. My fault for making folks pull double duty around here.
[03:54:42.200 --> 03:54:47.800]  This studio is like a sauna now. I know you like it hot so you're enjoying it. This feels like
[03:54:47.800 --> 03:54:55.080]  hell to me right now. But Massachusetts police cruiser shot at, catches fire. Yeah, this is
[03:54:55.080 --> 03:55:02.600]  breaking news. A police cruiser in Millis, Massachusetts caught fire after being shot at
[03:55:02.600 --> 03:55:08.760]  Wednesday. The Massachusetts state police tweeted, we have no word on whether they were injuries.
[03:55:08.760 --> 03:55:13.160]  Massachusetts state police aircraft were being used to serve the area. This is how you destabilize
[03:55:13.160 --> 03:55:17.800]  the country, get disenfranchised angry folks, get mainstream media and authority to tell them to go
[03:55:17.800 --> 03:55:23.640]  out and attack. It begins. Joe Biggs has got a report on this. Here it is. Joe Biggs here with
[03:55:23.640 --> 03:55:28.920]  info wars.com with some breaking news. Police say gunman has opened fire on a police car in
[03:55:28.920 --> 03:55:35.320]  Massachusetts. Massachusetts state police say mills police cruiser was shot at Wednesday. The
[03:55:35.320 --> 03:55:41.080]  department said in a tweet, MSP air wing also responded to mills area follow report of cruiser
[03:55:41.080 --> 03:55:47.000]  shot by gunman. We have no word on whether injuries yet. MSP also responding detectives,
[03:55:47.000 --> 03:55:52.680]  ballistic unit, crime scene texts and fire investigator to mills cruiser caught on fire
[03:55:52.680 --> 03:56:00.280]  after being shot. So the mass Massachusetts state police has tweeted out saying the patrol car
[03:56:00.280 --> 03:56:06.280]  was shot at by gunman. This is happening right now in Massachusetts. We'll try to keep you informed
[03:56:06.280 --> 03:56:11.320]  on what's going on. Currently I'm standing outside of the fox league police department
[03:56:11.320 --> 03:56:15.480]  as we're trying to get updates as to what happened with the officer shot yesterday.
[03:56:15.480 --> 03:56:20.440]  I'm Joe Biggs with info wars.com. I tell you, these folks calling for killing cops and white
[03:56:20.440 --> 03:56:25.000]  people got some wave-os because there will be repercussions even if the White House has given
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:30.360]  them backing. I just it's crazy. I mean, it is it is crazy. I know we got loaded phone lines,
[03:56:30.360 --> 03:56:35.560]  but we're basically out of time here. We have people homeland security drills, American terrorist,
[03:56:35.560 --> 03:56:39.960]  martial law drills is what they want to talk about. Maybe call back tomorrow folks. I apologize.
[03:56:39.960 --> 03:56:46.280]  We got to end this hour here into the fourth hour. But isn't it crazy how people can put those kind
[03:56:46.280 --> 03:56:50.680]  of that kind of call out there, those videos and things like that on social media and everything
[03:56:50.680 --> 03:56:55.800]  and it doesn't get taken down. No repercussions there with the free speech. But then when we show
[03:56:55.800 --> 03:57:00.120]  some news clip without the guy even shooting the lady on YouTube, we cut it out on the video. It's
[03:57:00.120 --> 03:57:03.880]  like we're cutting this out. And then we get a community guidelines strikes totally fake. We'll
[03:57:03.880 --> 03:57:08.120]  have it reversed by the very people claiming we're censoring them. Right. Don't show the
[03:57:08.120 --> 03:57:14.440]  Planned Parenthood videos, but talk about killing cops all day. Well, it's just going to legitimize
[03:57:14.440 --> 03:57:18.360]  the total police state. I mean, the people that run this country are doing this for a reason.
[03:57:18.360 --> 03:57:22.920]  They're going to be able to really oppress black people now, especially because of these operatives
[03:57:22.920 --> 03:57:28.360]  they've gotten their midst. And black folks need to be decrying these people big time. And I know
[03:57:28.360 --> 03:57:33.160]  a lot of these groups are the problem is they won't let those folks on MSNBC or CNN, the counter
[03:57:33.160 --> 03:57:39.080]  at our MTV. MTV is weaponized media by 90 something year old, some of their redstone
[03:57:39.080 --> 03:57:43.720]  that hates you and your family even more than Hillary Clinton does. And we just need to understand
[03:57:43.720 --> 03:57:49.480]  that there does not need to be any tit for tat or it'll start a Crip blood war that idiots were
[03:57:49.480 --> 03:57:54.040]  involved in. I mean, are the patriots out there that dumb? No, but there are some mentally ill
[03:57:54.040 --> 03:57:58.200]  white supremacists and people that are undoubtedly going to go out. You're going to have stuff like
[03:57:58.200 --> 03:58:02.760]  Charleston now. And then the black folks are going to kill people, the idiot black folks.
[03:58:02.760 --> 03:58:06.920]  And then it's just going to be a big stinking snowball. And I hope Lewis Faircon feels good
[03:58:06.920 --> 03:58:13.880]  now. And I hope, you know, all these other people pushing this too. I mean, it's sickening. Yeah,
[03:58:13.880 --> 03:58:17.800]  but you know, it's like a Turner Diaries dreams of this big race war, white supremacists put out
[03:58:17.800 --> 03:58:22.200]  the same crap. It's always these old men putting it out, who aren't the ones that are out there
[03:58:22.200 --> 03:58:26.920]  going to be dying. All I know is anybody tries to hurt me or my family, I'm going to defend myself.
[03:58:26.920 --> 03:58:31.720]  And there's not going to be any holding back. I don't care who you are. I'm going to take the
[03:58:31.720 --> 03:58:37.560]  safety off officially. Good job, Leigh Ann. Not only news tonight, 7 o'clock central.
