[00:00.000 --> 00:13.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:13.840 --> 00:19.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:19.760 --> 00:27.460]  Today I signed legislation and an executive order to hold China accountable for its oppressive
[00:27.460 --> 00:30.360]  actions against the people of Hong Kong.
[00:30.360 --> 00:41.800]  On July 14th, President Donald J. Trump signed into law HR7440, the Hong Kong Autonomy Act,
[00:41.800 --> 00:46.600]  and the President's Executive Order on Hong Kong Normalization.
[00:46.600 --> 00:55.480]  HR7440 imposes sanctions on foreign individuals, entities, and financial institutions that
[00:55.480 --> 00:59.680]  contribute to China's encroachment of Hong Kong.
[00:59.680 --> 01:05.040]  This bill gives the US power to protect Hong Kong's autonomy.
[01:05.040 --> 01:10.920]  The executive order on Hong Kong Normalization goes much further.
[01:10.920 --> 01:17.280]  Section 1 states how the US will now treat Hong Kong the same as communist China.
[01:17.280 --> 01:23.040]  This makes sense now that the CCP is absorbing Hong Kong, but it also sets a precedent for
[01:23.040 --> 01:28.240]  any other nations who choose to side with the communist Chinese.
[01:28.240 --> 01:35.160]  Perhaps this is why the UK banned Huawei 5G on the same day this executive order was signed
[01:35.160 --> 01:37.680]  into law.
[01:37.680 --> 01:43.280]  But Section 4 best illustrates the extent of this national emergency.
[01:43.280 --> 01:50.440]  It grants extremely broad powers to the US to go after individuals or entities involved
[01:50.440 --> 01:58.880]  directly or indirectly with supporting the communist Chinese in any way, including American
[01:58.880 --> 02:03.920]  citizens, corporations, and financial institutions.
[02:03.920 --> 02:10.080]  This would include the US mainstream media apparatus and Hollywood, which have been working
[02:10.080 --> 02:14.440]  for the CCP and parroting their propaganda for years.
[02:14.440 --> 02:20.040]  Hollywood's actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and
[02:20.040 --> 02:22.040]  the human spirit.
[02:22.040 --> 02:27.080]  And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls
[02:27.080 --> 02:32.200]  short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice.
[02:32.200 --> 02:40.040]  But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party.
[02:40.040 --> 02:45.240]  This would include tech giants like Twitter, Facebook, Google, and Apple.
[02:45.240 --> 02:49.920]  It could even include American politicians.
[02:49.920 --> 02:55.880]  The communist Chinese have bought hundreds of thousands of acres of American farmland.
[02:55.880 --> 03:01.440]  And the language of this national emergency suggests that this could all be taken back
[03:01.440 --> 03:03.600]  by the US government.
[03:03.600 --> 03:10.960]  The CCP has become as tyrannical and powerful as Nazi Germany ever was, if not more so.
[03:10.960 --> 03:16.800]  They have been seizing land from Africa, India, Australia, and the South China Sea.
[03:16.800 --> 03:21.960]  The Trump administration piled pressure on China Monday, rejecting nearly all of Beijing's
[03:21.960 --> 03:24.800]  territorial claims in the South China Sea.
[03:24.800 --> 03:30.800]  They have been rounding up Muslim Chinese, sending them via trains to concentration camps,
[03:30.800 --> 03:36.320]  shaving their heads and selling their hair to the US, and harvesting their organs for
[03:36.320 --> 03:43.960]  rich Saudi customers who require halal organs for their surgical transplants.
[03:43.960 --> 03:50.080]  The US media, who love to paint President Trump as a new Hitler, ignore these authoritarian
[03:50.080 --> 03:52.800]  crimes against humanity.
[03:52.800 --> 03:59.160]  This may be why they are ignoring the president's executive order on Hong Kong normalization.
[03:59.160 --> 04:05.880]  The document reads, like a declaration of war, and the American media have been working
[04:05.880 --> 04:08.120]  with the enemy.
[04:08.120 --> 04:32.960]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[04:32.960 --> 04:40.200]  I've got just incredible stacks of news, we've got Roger Stone sitting, waiting to come live
[04:40.200 --> 04:42.800]  here on the Alex Jones show on this Sunday.
[04:42.800 --> 04:46.760]  What an incredible time to be alive, the fight for America is on.
[04:46.760 --> 04:53.040]  The left, while they put their Mark of the Beast slave mask on, have taken the political
[04:53.040 --> 04:56.320]  mask off and they've told you what they're all about.
[04:56.320 --> 04:59.800]  Destruction and killing America.
[04:59.800 --> 05:04.240]  It's Christmas in July, we ran the sale last year, it was very, very popular.
[05:04.240 --> 05:09.160]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important
[05:09.160 --> 05:10.160]  election year.
[05:10.160 --> 05:16.080]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[05:16.080 --> 05:20.320]  It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings, sitting at the top of Betsy Ross
[05:20.320 --> 05:21.320]  Clang.
[05:21.320 --> 05:24.320]  And the shirts are on sale right now on InfowarsStore.com.
[05:24.320 --> 05:30.160]  I got the idea for the Trump campaign, having a similar shirt to media called Nancy, which
[05:30.160 --> 05:31.160]  of course it isn't.
[05:31.160 --> 05:34.120]  And since it's so triggering to the leftist and the globalist, well we're going to make
[05:34.120 --> 05:38.960]  sure there's even more of these on the streets to spread the word and exercise our First
[05:38.960 --> 05:40.560]  Amendment in the face of each time.
[05:40.560 --> 05:44.320]  We also have store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points.
[05:44.320 --> 05:48.960]  So whatever great item it is that you want, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points
[05:48.960 --> 05:53.080]  on your next order and at least 50% off across the board.
[05:53.080 --> 05:55.840]  Now I'm going to have to get this sale very, very soon because all these products are about
[05:55.840 --> 05:56.840]  to sell out.
[05:56.840 --> 06:25.760]  I'm Alex Jones and now your host, Owen Schreuer.
[06:25.760 --> 06:41.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, July 19th, 2020.
[06:41.440 --> 06:48.120]  This is the Alex Jones show brought to you by InfowarsStore.com.
[06:48.120 --> 06:49.760]  Filling in for Alex today, I'm Owen Schreuer.
[06:49.760 --> 06:54.640]  Roger Stone is going to be co-hosting with me today as well, a lot to get to.
[06:54.640 --> 06:58.160]  I really don't even know what I would consider the top story.
[06:58.160 --> 07:04.160]  You've got President Trump signing the Hong Kong Normalization Bill, which opens up many
[07:04.160 --> 07:12.040]  avenues to go after Chinese operatives in the United States, in Hong Kong.
[07:12.040 --> 07:17.840]  You've got the COVID hoax that is the fake pandemic.
[07:17.840 --> 07:22.480]  It's just getting worse and worse, where they're saying, oh, you died of a motorcycle
[07:22.480 --> 07:27.880]  accident, no, you died of COVID, oh, we had 98% positive tests and then they come back
[07:27.880 --> 07:28.880]  two weeks later.
[07:28.880 --> 07:33.160]  No way, it was 9.8, oops, just a typo.
[07:33.160 --> 07:36.520]  The economy is struggling.
[07:36.520 --> 07:41.940]  The globalists are getting everything they want, a cashless society, a digital spy grid
[07:41.940 --> 07:43.680]  that you sign on to.
[07:43.680 --> 07:49.960]  The left is attacking the United States of America on a daily basis, riots every night
[07:49.960 --> 07:50.960]  in Portland.
[07:50.960 --> 07:55.680]  There are now burned down police buildings, riots every night in New York City.
[07:55.680 --> 08:02.760]  Shootings are up almost 300%, but DeBlasio celebrates the lowest imprisonment rate while
[08:02.760 --> 08:05.800]  violence on the streets soars.
[08:05.800 --> 08:10.680]  Didn't stop one hero from taking the Black Lives Matter, painted in the street and rubbing
[08:10.680 --> 08:16.600]  black paint all over it, and it was actually a black activist, a nice lady, and as soon
[08:16.600 --> 08:21.600]  as she got released from jail the first time after doing it, she went right back out and
[08:21.600 --> 08:22.600]  did it again.
[08:22.600 --> 08:32.680]  Then the big bombshell that really is shaking some grounds today.
[08:32.680 --> 08:39.880]  Republican Mark Meadows says it's time for people to go to jail in the Russian collusion
[08:39.880 --> 08:40.880]  hoax.
[08:40.880 --> 08:41.880]  Absolutely.
[08:41.880 --> 08:47.000]  In fact, that time has come and went quite frankly, but I guess we could still be in
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.560]  that time.
[08:49.560 --> 08:56.800]  We also have other Chinese agents in America like the DC mayor Muriel Bowser coming out
[08:56.800 --> 08:59.640]  basically publicly saying that she's with China.
[08:59.640 --> 09:05.720]  Then you've got Fox News that has now, as I predicted, gone anti-Trump with at least
[09:05.720 --> 09:09.520]  90% of its programming.
[09:09.520 --> 09:15.400]  You've got all that and more coming up with Roger Stone, but Roger, it's got to be nice
[09:15.400 --> 09:20.560]  to hear that there are some Republicans fighting for justice when it comes to this Russian
[09:20.560 --> 09:25.560]  collusion hoax, which of course you got tangled in the web of lies.
[09:25.560 --> 09:27.760]  They destroyed your life financially.
[09:27.760 --> 09:33.000]  They put you through all that torture for all those years, your family as well.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.440]  Just not to mention all the lies of the mainstream news and everything else that came with it.
[09:37.440 --> 09:38.880]  It's got to be nice to hear.
[09:38.880 --> 09:44.680]  Finally, a Republican with some quejones that steps up and says no, it was actually
[09:44.680 --> 09:51.720]  Obama's men, the henchmen in the FBI, and the intelligence agencies that lied about
[09:51.720 --> 09:52.880]  the Russian collusion hoax.
[09:52.880 --> 09:54.680]  It's time for them to go to jail.
[09:54.680 --> 09:58.240]  Roger, it's been overdue, in my opinion.
[09:58.240 --> 10:04.360]  Well, extraordinary information declassified at the request of Senator Lindsey Graham this
[10:04.360 --> 10:12.960]  week just further proves that in 2016, the Obama administration was engaged in the largest
[10:12.960 --> 10:19.040]  single abuse of power in our history, where they actually used the full legal authority
[10:19.040 --> 10:26.160]  of the United States government and the extraordinary capability of our intelligence agencies surveillance
[10:26.160 --> 10:33.800]  capability to spy on the Republican candidate for president, to defraud the FISA courts,
[10:33.800 --> 10:41.760]  to mount an illegal coup, an attempt to undo the 2016 election, using evidence to justify
[10:41.760 --> 10:45.160]  all of this that they knew was fabricating.
[10:45.160 --> 10:51.320]  What amazes me is that CNN continues to say, both on the air and in their print stories,
[10:51.320 --> 10:56.680]  Trump has produced no evidence to prove that his campaign was spying on.
[10:56.680 --> 10:58.600]  We know that is untrue.
[10:58.600 --> 11:06.960]  Not only the declassified material that Rick Grenell so courageously cried out of the hands
[11:06.960 --> 11:13.640]  of federal bureaucrats, say, a month and a half ago, but now this new documentation,
[11:13.640 --> 11:20.240]  which proves once and for all that the Russian collusion delusion was a politically motivated
[11:20.240 --> 11:21.240]  hoax.
[11:21.240 --> 11:27.360]  Now, I know some people say, well, you've said that on InfoWars for two years, but the
[11:27.360 --> 11:32.400]  way the media works today is somewhat different than the way it works 20 years ago.
[11:32.400 --> 11:39.600]  Elias published truth tellers like Alex Jones or yourself, myself, Tucker Carlson, Sean
[11:39.600 --> 11:42.600]  Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, you name it.
[11:42.600 --> 11:49.440]  We completely and thoroughly debunk the falsehood that only weeks later, the mainstream corporate
[11:49.440 --> 11:55.080]  owned media comes right back out and recycles the same falsehood as if they never heard
[11:55.080 --> 11:56.680]  the rebuttal.
[11:56.680 --> 12:02.120]  It really is an extraordinary phenomenon and I experienced it myself this week and that
[12:02.120 --> 12:06.440]  is not what I want to talk about today, but it has to be hit.
[12:06.440 --> 12:14.720]  I got through an act of mercy through a humanitarian act, which actually literally saved my life
[12:14.720 --> 12:21.880]  because the judge in my case, contrary to every legal precedent in every circuit in
[12:21.880 --> 12:28.360]  the United States, where people in my position either going to prison or in prison, applied
[12:28.360 --> 12:35.160]  for compassionate transfer or release, were granted it, but in my case, it was denied
[12:35.160 --> 12:44.440]  in violation of the Bureau of Prisons and DOJ guidelines, in violation of all the facts
[12:44.440 --> 12:53.600]  of my age and health and in violation of the real conditions of the prison in Jessup, Georgia,
[12:53.600 --> 12:55.120]  where they wanted to send me.
[12:55.120 --> 13:00.760]  I bring this up only to demonstrate that we have judicial tyranny in our country because
[13:00.760 --> 13:08.040]  the facts are as I have just stated them, but the DC Circuit Court upheld this ruling
[13:08.040 --> 13:10.880]  by the judge in my case.
[13:10.880 --> 13:18.520]  What it demonstrates is how deeply embedded the deep state is in every sector of government,
[13:18.520 --> 13:24.360]  particularly the Justice Department, meaning that appointing a new attorney general is
[13:24.360 --> 13:29.640]  like leaving the spoiled diapers on the baby and changing the pens.
[13:29.640 --> 13:36.680]  Below him, you have numerous Obama loyalists who are dedicated to the destruction of Donald
[13:36.680 --> 13:40.040]  Trump or anybody associated with him.
[13:40.040 --> 13:45.440]  And so it is in our national security apparatus, that's what Ukraine, everybody who testified
[13:45.440 --> 13:51.040]  against the president in the Ukrainian impeachment, they all work technically for Donald Trump.
[13:51.040 --> 13:54.200]  They're all in Donald Trump's NSA.
[13:54.200 --> 14:02.000]  So this is true across the board, including CDC, where we now seriously have to question
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.760]  whether or not all the statistics we've seen about known cases are accurate or whether
[14:08.760 --> 14:10.720]  they have been manipulated.
[14:10.720 --> 14:15.960]  Now, I am not saying for the folks over at Media Matters who are no doubt watching this,
[14:15.960 --> 14:17.960]  because they love you so much, Colin.
[14:17.960 --> 14:20.240]  That's why they're watching.
[14:20.240 --> 14:21.240]  Yeah.
[14:21.240 --> 14:23.480]  I'm not saying COVID-19 is not real.
[14:23.480 --> 14:25.560]  I'm not saying it is not dangerous.
[14:25.560 --> 14:31.280]  I'm not saying that it is not a legitimate virus in a public health menace.
[14:31.280 --> 14:36.960]  What I am saying, however, is by any measure, the public projections of how hard it would
[14:36.960 --> 14:40.360]  hit the country have turned out to be wrong.
[14:40.360 --> 14:41.360]  Thank God.
[14:41.360 --> 14:43.240]  But Roger, here's what we know.
[14:43.240 --> 14:45.840]  They were willing to send you into that jail.
[14:45.840 --> 14:46.840]  That's not a debate.
[14:46.840 --> 14:48.800]  They wanted to send you into that jail.
[14:48.800 --> 14:52.160]  Meanwhile, they're releasing all these criminals.
[14:52.160 --> 14:56.040]  They're releasing all these criminals are saying, oh, we can't have anybody in the jail cells
[14:56.040 --> 14:57.240]  because of COVID.
[14:57.240 --> 15:00.720]  But of course, if you don't wear a mask, we're going to throw you in jail because of COVID.
[15:00.720 --> 15:05.000]  And by the way, we're going to throw Roger Stone in jail, who's in the highest risk category
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.920]  for getting COVID and dying.
[15:06.920 --> 15:12.120]  And also the stories at infowars.com, the attorney demanding another prosecution of
[15:12.120 --> 15:16.240]  Roger has argued for pedophile Jeffrey Epstein to be exonerated.
[15:16.240 --> 15:19.280]  Oh, and that's a CNN guest.
[15:19.280 --> 15:20.280]  How do you like that?
[15:20.280 --> 15:21.280]  Of course.
[15:21.280 --> 15:26.080]  So, I mean, the double standard here is unbelievable, Roger.
[15:26.080 --> 15:27.080]  Pretty incredible.
[15:27.080 --> 15:30.320]  It proves yet again, the two tier justice system.
[15:30.320 --> 15:36.560]  So two different Inspector General's reports recommend to Attorney General Barr that FBI
[15:36.560 --> 15:43.280]  Director James Comey be prosecuted for crimes more serious and carry more mandatory jail
[15:43.280 --> 15:46.400]  time under the guidelines than the crimes that I wrote.
[15:46.400 --> 15:49.680]  When we come back, folks, we're going to play the clip of Mark Meadows saying this and we're
[15:49.680 --> 15:52.840]  going to have Roger Stone, who was directly involved with this.
[15:52.840 --> 15:56.120]  They went after him, tried to ruin his life and kill him over it when we come back on
[15:56.120 --> 15:58.720]  this short break.
[15:58.720 --> 16:02.440]  There are a lot of signs that people are really waking up to the new world order and global
[16:02.440 --> 16:03.440]  government.
[16:03.440 --> 16:06.240]  But one of the biggest is privacy pouches.
[16:06.240 --> 16:09.960]  I've been selling these for more than 10 years in the old days.
[16:09.960 --> 16:11.360]  They weren't 100% effective.
[16:11.360 --> 16:12.360]  Now they are.
[16:12.360 --> 16:16.680]  They're a little bitty, lightweight Faraday cages that small phones and even large cell
[16:16.680 --> 16:20.520]  phones fit into very, very comfortably and then slip right into your pocket.
[16:20.520 --> 16:22.400]  And these things work great that way.
[16:22.400 --> 16:27.040]  You're not tracked, you're not traced by government, by big corporations, by big tech, by hackers,
[16:27.040 --> 16:28.040]  by criminals.
[16:28.040 --> 16:31.800]  If you're selling your data, if they're using it against you, AI uses this to be able to
[16:31.800 --> 16:34.040]  predict the future of manipulate markets.
[16:34.040 --> 16:37.720]  It's critical that everyone stop going around with your cell phones being naked.
[16:37.720 --> 16:40.880]  Well, I got to tell you, normally we've probably sold a couple hundred a month.
[16:40.880 --> 16:45.680]  We're selling upwards of a thousand of these a day, plus we have a good unit and it's also
[16:45.680 --> 16:46.680]  a good price.
[16:46.680 --> 16:48.120]  We have it in four different colors.
[16:48.120 --> 16:51.440]  It's the Privacy Pockets at infowarstore.com.
[16:51.440 --> 16:52.440]  People are really waking up.
[16:52.440 --> 16:56.560]  I'm seeing it all over the news that folks are aware of this and are now using these.
[16:56.560 --> 16:58.560]  Here's an infowarstore.com.
[16:58.560 --> 17:03.360]  Cool that under the megaopolis technocracy plan, things are going to be so incredibly
[17:03.360 --> 17:10.280]  fair and wonderful because at all seeing all loving computer that doesn't discriminate
[17:10.280 --> 17:15.280]  is going to decide who gets what resources, who gets what jobs, but in reality it's building
[17:15.280 --> 17:23.000]  a post human world so that you can be made obsolete, domesticated, dumbed down, drugged,
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.880]  distracted, atomized, and then slowly killed.
[17:27.880 --> 17:30.640]  This is the brave new world.
[17:30.640 --> 17:32.240]  It's the post human world.
[17:32.240 --> 17:37.880]  It's the dreaming of the post human world, the Wired Magazine and the Wall Street Journal.
[17:37.880 --> 17:39.080]  All tell us about it.
[17:39.080 --> 17:42.480]  Oh, now they tell us our smart phones don't just track or remove.
[17:42.480 --> 17:48.040]  They're monitoring our psychology and sending it back to a corporate database globally.
[17:48.040 --> 17:53.960]  You see the bear trap closed on our leg now and the vampire walked out of the bushes and
[17:53.960 --> 17:59.240]  is explaining to us how he's slowly going to bleed us and destroy us.
[17:59.240 --> 18:02.880]  Another part of the Great Awakening that's taking place is people that haven't even been
[18:02.880 --> 18:08.400]  religious or Christian now see how evil is out in the open, how hundreds of churches
[18:08.400 --> 18:14.680]  have been burned in Europe and the U.S. Hundreds of Christian icons have been burned, destroyed.
[18:14.680 --> 18:18.440]  Jesus has had their heads cut off all over the country, all over the Philippines, all
[18:18.440 --> 18:19.440]  over Europe.
[18:19.440 --> 18:20.920]  Virgin Mary's are getting torn down.
[18:20.920 --> 18:23.040]  I mean, crosses are being torn down.
[18:23.040 --> 18:28.200]  It's absolutely out of control, but people now understand that evil was always real.
[18:28.200 --> 18:33.560]  It is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move, building beneath the surface
[18:33.560 --> 18:34.560]  and now it's emerged.
[18:34.560 --> 18:37.760]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it.
[18:37.760 --> 18:38.840]  I'm praying for America.
[18:38.840 --> 18:42.560]  I'm praying for you and I know the power of prayer is real and God hears it.
[18:42.560 --> 18:46.080]  We need to come together and pray for an even greater awakening.
[18:46.080 --> 18:48.480]  Pray for Donald Trump to be protected.
[18:48.480 --> 18:53.440]  Pray for him to win a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalist
[18:53.440 --> 18:55.720]  to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[18:55.720 --> 18:56.720]  God bless you all.
[18:56.720 --> 18:59.760]  Please pray for him for us as well.
[18:59.760 --> 19:09.280]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[19:09.280 --> 19:17.040]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[19:17.040 --> 19:24.080]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[19:24.080 --> 19:25.080]  in males.
[19:25.080 --> 19:31.040]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[19:31.040 --> 19:35.920]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[19:35.920 --> 19:36.920]  Yes.
[19:36.920 --> 19:42.200]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[19:42.200 --> 19:47.920]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed
[19:47.920 --> 19:48.920]  formula.
[19:48.920 --> 19:49.920]  So what are you waiting for?
[19:49.920 --> 19:51.920]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[19:51.920 --> 19:54.800]  Never been a better time than right now.
[19:54.800 --> 20:02.160]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[20:02.160 --> 20:07.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:07.560 --> 20:18.080]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[20:18.080 --> 20:22.080]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[20:22.080 --> 20:29.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the legendary Roger Stone is on the other side of this microphone.
[20:29.920 --> 20:32.400]  We're going to be going back to him in just a minute.
[20:32.400 --> 20:35.760]  I want to get his take on what President Trump said this morning, what Mark Meadows
[20:35.760 --> 20:38.920]  said yesterday.
[20:38.920 --> 20:40.080]  And we're going to play that clip.
[20:40.080 --> 20:46.440]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a new product at InfoWarsStore.com and it's
[20:46.440 --> 20:53.320]  a new take, if you will, a remake, if you will, a remix, more like it, on a product that's
[20:53.320 --> 20:55.720]  been so popular for a long time.
[20:55.720 --> 21:03.760]  But is now, in general, with the general public, more popular than ever, and that is a privacy
[21:03.760 --> 21:07.880]  pocket, a ferrity enclosure case for your cell phone.
[21:07.880 --> 21:14.040]  Now we've had these at InfoWarsStore.com before, guys, give me a dot cam here so you can see
[21:14.040 --> 21:15.680]  this.
[21:15.680 --> 21:20.000]  We've had these at InfoWarsStore.com before, ladies and gentlemen, but as I said, this
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  is a new design.
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.320]  Now normally, these things in the past have been really bulky and thick, not really comfortable
[21:28.320 --> 21:30.640]  to use.
[21:30.640 --> 21:37.040]  This is ultra thin, I mean, this is paper thin, this is about as thin as it gets right
[21:37.040 --> 21:38.040]  here.
[21:38.040 --> 21:39.960]  In fact, I can show you.
[21:39.960 --> 21:51.600]  And I've got a pretty bulky phone, so, but as you can see, just right there, boom, done.
[21:51.600 --> 22:00.320]  And now none of the tracking and tracing and data mining, or heck, even just the radio
[22:00.320 --> 22:04.440]  cell signals that can also be damaging, are emitting.
[22:04.440 --> 22:07.520]  They can cause you to not sleep well and all this other stuff.
[22:07.520 --> 22:13.320]  And you know, this is something that you have to measure how and when you want to use it,
[22:13.320 --> 22:20.720]  but there's going to be a time in the near future where you're going to be wanting to
[22:20.720 --> 22:25.040]  just go off the grid and just not have somebody tracing and tracking your cell phone.
[22:25.040 --> 22:31.200]  This is the easiest way to do it, and they design the new phones now, specifically Apple,
[22:31.200 --> 22:34.440]  so that you can never even turn them off.
[22:34.440 --> 22:39.000]  So even when you think it's off, it's still on tracking and tracing you, data mining you.
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.200]  As soon as you put it in this, they can no longer do it.
[22:42.200 --> 22:44.080]  They can't reach the phone with their satellite.
[22:44.080 --> 22:49.800]  So yeah, it's still on and trying to run, but none of the waves are emitting from this.
[22:49.800 --> 22:55.400]  None of the tracing and tracking is getting in, and it's just so great now because it's
[22:55.400 --> 22:59.920]  been such a bulky and kind of uncomfortable item in the past.
[22:59.920 --> 23:06.160]  Now it is thin, it is effective, and it is at Infowarsstore.com.
[23:06.160 --> 23:11.040]  The new privacy pockets are on sale at Infowarsstore.com.
[23:11.040 --> 23:16.120]  And you know, I'll be honest, it's tough for me to ever just turn my phone off working
[23:16.120 --> 23:22.240]  in media needing to have access to information 24-7 and people needing access to me 24-7.
[23:22.240 --> 23:28.160]  But man, let me tell you, and I notice this too, and this is maybe a compromise that you
[23:28.160 --> 23:34.800]  can make when, if you have trouble sleeping, this, your cell phone could be one of the
[23:34.800 --> 23:39.480]  biggest reasons for it, specifically if you sleep with it near your bed.
[23:39.480 --> 23:41.520]  I used to put my cell phone in the other room.
[23:41.520 --> 23:44.600]  Now the problem with that is, okay, you wake up in the morning or something, you want to
[23:44.600 --> 23:48.280]  just lay in bed for an extra minute, check your cell phone, well you got to go downstairs
[23:48.280 --> 23:49.480]  or the other room to get it.
[23:49.480 --> 23:53.360]  Now, with the privacy pocket, you can just have it right there by your bed, you're not
[23:53.360 --> 23:57.760]  getting the dangerous radio waves, it's not blowing up, it's not getting tracked and traced.
[23:57.760 --> 24:01.600]  And heck, when you go from point A to point B, when you want to go somewhere but you don't
[24:01.600 --> 24:06.120]  want to be on the grid, it's the privacy pocket at Infowarsstore.com.
[24:06.120 --> 24:08.040]  Get it today, it is on sale.
[24:08.040 --> 24:14.840]  Now, let's go to Mark Meadows and get Roger Stone's take on this powerful clip from Mark
[24:14.840 --> 24:15.840]  Meadows.
[24:15.840 --> 24:21.800]  Mark, let me, let me turn to the Russia probe.
[24:21.800 --> 24:26.760]  You did such an excellent job when you were on the oversight committee in terms of zeroing
[24:26.760 --> 24:28.960]  in on the origins of the Russia probe.
[24:28.960 --> 24:33.840]  We now know for sure, Lindsey Graham told us this about a month ago actually, so our
[24:33.840 --> 24:40.640]  audience was aware that the FBI knew that the dossier was just made up garbage and the
[24:40.640 --> 24:43.000]  subsource told the FBI agents that.
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.080]  And yet Jim Comey and Andrew McCabe kept on pushing forward renewing warrants to spy on
[24:48.080 --> 24:49.200]  Carter Page.
[24:49.200 --> 24:53.040]  Your reaction to what we know now and when are we going to hear from John Durham?
[24:53.040 --> 24:54.560]  Will there be indictments, sir?
[24:54.560 --> 24:58.120]  Well, I think the American people expect indictments.
[24:58.120 --> 25:01.960]  I know I expect indictments based on the evidence I've seen.
[25:01.960 --> 25:04.400]  Lindsey Graham did a good job in getting that out.
[25:04.400 --> 25:09.880]  We know that they not only knew that there wasn't a case, but they continue to investigate
[25:09.880 --> 25:17.680]  and spy and yes, I use the word spy on Trump campaign officials and actually even doing
[25:17.680 --> 25:23.920]  things when this president was sworn in and after that and doing an inappropriate manner.
[25:23.920 --> 25:28.800]  You're going to see a couple of other documents come out in the coming days that will suggest
[25:28.800 --> 25:33.920]  that not only was the campaign spied on, but the FBI did not act appropriately as they
[25:33.920 --> 25:35.360]  were investigating.
[25:35.360 --> 25:40.320]  It's all starting to come unravel to unravel and I tell you, it's time that people go to
[25:40.320 --> 25:42.800]  jail and people are indicted.
[25:42.800 --> 25:44.280]  Boom.
[25:44.280 --> 25:45.720]  Signed, sealed, delivered.
[25:45.720 --> 25:46.720]  Let's make it happen.
[25:46.720 --> 25:48.480]  Roger Stone, your response.
[25:48.480 --> 25:55.080]  Well, from Mark Meadows mouth to God's ears, you do have to wonder why this process has
[25:55.080 --> 26:02.480]  taken almost the entire first term of President Donald Trump because in the beginning, of
[26:02.480 --> 26:10.840]  course, the deep state stone walled the declassification, but the real hero of this story is Richard
[26:10.840 --> 26:11.840]  Rick Grinnell.
[26:11.840 --> 26:19.760]  Rick Grinnell, who temporarily served as the head of DNI, came in, broke the bureaucratic
[26:19.760 --> 26:25.760]  log jam and actually released the declassified documents ordered almost two years ago by
[26:25.760 --> 26:32.640]  President Trump, which break the entire rushing collusion hoax wide open.
[26:32.640 --> 26:40.160]  So it is obvious to anyone that this goes all the way to the Oval Office, that Mr. Brennan,
[26:40.160 --> 26:47.640]  Mr. Comey, Mr. Clapper, Vice President Joe Biden, the president himself, Valerie Jarrett,
[26:47.640 --> 26:56.200]  Susan Reitz, Samantha Powers, the UN ambassador are all co-conspirators.
[26:56.200 --> 27:00.360]  But I wonder what will happen only in view of the fact that the inspector general of
[27:00.360 --> 27:06.280]  the Justice Department recommended twice to the attorney general, Mr. Barr, that James
[27:06.280 --> 27:14.120]  Comey be indicted for lying, but lying specifically at harboring top secret classified information
[27:14.120 --> 27:20.760]  which he removed illegally from the FBI headquarters, more serious charges than what they charged
[27:20.760 --> 27:27.560]  me with, for which I was wrongly convicted, and Mr. Barr has taken no action against Mr.
[27:27.560 --> 27:28.560]  Comey.
[27:28.560 --> 27:33.600]  Now, some have argued, well, perhaps he knows about larger indictment coming down the road,
[27:33.600 --> 27:39.360]  but it would be good for the American people to see that Mr. Comey gets charged and those
[27:39.360 --> 27:45.840]  charges could always be superseded in a so-called superseding indictment down the road.
[27:45.840 --> 27:50.840]  It would show the American people that there are not two standards, one for Roger Stone
[27:50.840 --> 27:57.440]  and that great American patriot, Mike Flynn, and another one for the Clinton and Obama
[27:57.440 --> 27:59.640]  criminal cabal.
[27:59.640 --> 28:04.440]  So it is interesting to me, Owen, that first Mr. Germs report was going to be ready in
[28:04.440 --> 28:08.320]  the spring, then it was going to be ready in the summer.
[28:08.320 --> 28:12.880]  Now there are hints that it won't be ready until after the election.
[28:12.880 --> 28:15.160]  This is very, very disturbing.
[28:15.160 --> 28:18.160]  How long will these criminals get away with it?
[28:18.160 --> 28:24.760]  Now, case in point, the new prosecutor in my case who replaced the four rogue prosecutors
[28:24.760 --> 28:29.960]  who were not career non-political line prosecutors, J.P.
[28:29.960 --> 28:37.280]  Comey, is the same man that the week of my trial announced that there would be no prosecution
[28:37.280 --> 28:39.040]  against Andrew McKay.
[28:39.040 --> 28:44.760]  The same week I was convicted, the crime that Mr. McKay should have been charged with carries
[28:44.760 --> 28:50.840]  a greater jail term and is a more serious crime than lying to Congress to charge them.
[28:50.840 --> 28:51.840]  I was on...
[28:51.840 --> 28:57.080]  And these people committed treason, which President Trump says 50 years in jail.
[28:57.080 --> 28:58.080]  We'll be right back.
[28:58.080 --> 29:02.520]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com.
[29:02.520 --> 29:06.560]  You can wear them out to political events, you can trigger live darts.
[29:06.560 --> 29:11.840]  But one of the biggest reasons is, it's a great conversation starter at any costume
[29:11.840 --> 29:14.240]  party or at Halloween.
[29:14.240 --> 29:18.560]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect
[29:18.560 --> 29:20.440]  you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[29:20.440 --> 29:24.120]  It's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations
[29:24.120 --> 29:28.880]  and contact tracing of their openly announcing it's an act of submission.
[29:28.880 --> 29:32.320]  It's an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down.
[29:32.320 --> 29:36.160]  But a big reason to wear these is then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing
[29:36.160 --> 29:42.080]  a Halloween mask, say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[29:42.080 --> 29:45.840]  And the M95 mask only control what's coming in, not what's going out.
[29:45.840 --> 29:49.400]  So they quote spread COVID-19, they don't protect from it.
[29:49.400 --> 29:52.360]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back in these control freak spaces.
[29:52.360 --> 29:57.520]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free, they're at cost, infowarstore.com.
[29:57.520 --> 30:03.200]  I know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult, we'll all tell them to wear masks
[30:03.200 --> 30:06.560]  so they're going to die, and then we'll release the pressure for a while and then bring it
[30:06.560 --> 30:10.400]  back and squeeze it harder and release it again and we'll be the virtues signals, we'll
[30:10.400 --> 30:15.720]  be the angels even though our lord and master Bill Gates helped fund the whole COVID-19.
[30:15.720 --> 30:16.720]  Oh.
[30:16.720 --> 30:19.720]  No, don't seduce me.
[30:19.720 --> 30:24.440]  That's right, that's the code word for Bill Gates's operation.
[30:24.440 --> 30:30.400]  He carries out with his good little buddy Dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult.
[30:30.400 --> 30:34.960]  As you know, for girls, there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in
[30:34.960 --> 30:35.960]  the romance novels.
[30:35.960 --> 30:41.240]  One of them's the vampire, the werewolf, the billionaire, and who else?
[30:41.240 --> 30:46.200]  Oh, that's right, there's the surgeon, and then there's one other one, and it's so much
[30:46.200 --> 30:51.720]  fun to be ruled over by these psychotic psychopaths, and it's so good to know that there are masters
[30:51.720 --> 30:55.080]  and they're coming to rape us with their inoculations.
[30:55.080 --> 30:57.360]  Psychopaths are so hot.
[30:57.360 --> 30:58.360]  Oh yeah.
[30:58.360 --> 31:05.360]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[31:05.360 --> 31:11.720]  Where did it come from?
[31:11.720 --> 31:17.640]  Where did it come from?
[31:17.640 --> 31:18.920]  In four store dot com.
[31:18.920 --> 31:25.120]  We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water, so make sure that it's always available
[31:25.120 --> 31:29.240]  to you with the Alexa pure water filtration system.

[31:51.600 --> 31:59.320]  Other systems just don't compare.
[31:59.320 --> 32:09.440]  Vicky Gibbs, 57 year old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated,
[32:09.440 --> 32:10.440]  and then died.
[32:10.440 --> 32:15.600]  And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch, it'll be
[32:15.600 --> 32:16.600]  innovation.
[32:16.600 --> 32:17.600]  We know what's going to happen.
[32:17.600 --> 32:23.160]  It's a blue city, same story yet again, and they say her heart gave out.
[32:23.160 --> 32:28.120]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube in COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record,
[32:28.120 --> 32:30.760]  want everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed.
[32:30.760 --> 32:34.360]  Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states?
[32:34.360 --> 32:39.200]  It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs, and COVID-19 is causing
[32:39.200 --> 32:41.280]  an autoimmune response.
[32:41.280 --> 32:46.200]  And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying, it will kill you.
[32:46.200 --> 32:50.720]  But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[32:50.720 --> 32:54.920]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading.
[32:54.920 --> 33:02.120]  Don't end up like Vicky Gibbs or everyone.
[33:02.120 --> 33:25.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:25.600 --> 33:33.080]  This is Roger Stone, an Info Wars alum, and I'm right back here on the Alex Jones show.
[33:33.080 --> 33:39.120]  Owen Troyer and I are sitting in for Alex so he can get a little R and R. And as you
[33:39.120 --> 33:45.720]  saw, we're breaking down the literally quickly crumbling what's left of the Russian collusion
[33:45.720 --> 33:46.720]  fraud.
[33:46.720 --> 33:52.800]  I myself experienced it in the days after President Trump in an extraordinarily courageous
[33:52.800 --> 33:59.200]  act of both mercy and justice commuted my deep state death sentence.
[33:59.200 --> 34:05.000]  You see, despite the fact that it is the policy of DOJ and the Bureau of Prisons, despite
[34:05.000 --> 34:11.280]  the fact that I'm 67 and have a history of respiratory problems, despite the fact that
[34:11.280 --> 34:16.240]  every other person in my position who went to court to get a transfer or delay in their
[34:16.240 --> 34:23.680]  incarceration in the last 30 days was granted it, they wanted me to die in a rural Georgia
[34:23.680 --> 34:24.680]  prison.
[34:24.680 --> 34:25.680]  Why?
[34:25.680 --> 34:30.640]  Well, because you see, then the appeal of my conviction would die with me and those involved
[34:30.640 --> 34:37.240]  in my conviction would never be exposed in terms of the level of misconduct and corruption.
[34:37.240 --> 34:40.120]  So there was a method to their madness.
[34:40.120 --> 34:46.160]  And just in the last week, Robert Mueller, also known as Mumbles Mueller, popped up again
[34:46.160 --> 34:50.120]  to reiterate the same false narrative.
[34:50.120 --> 34:55.120]  Roger Stone came to our attention because he was communicating with known Russian intelligence
[34:55.120 --> 34:56.120]  officers.
[34:56.120 --> 34:57.120]  Notice the plural.
[34:57.120 --> 35:02.520]  He knows that that is nonsense, that they brought no such charge against me and that
[35:02.520 --> 35:10.240]  my completely innocuous exchange with Guccifer 2.0, a persona on Twitter, took place after
[35:10.240 --> 35:12.840]  WikiLeaks had already published the documents.
[35:12.840 --> 35:17.400]  The content of it was published right here on Infowars in total.
[35:17.400 --> 35:18.400]  It was innocuous.
[35:18.400 --> 35:25.880]  It was benign and they can't even prove that Guccifer 2.0 is a Russian intelligence asset.
[35:25.880 --> 35:30.240]  In fact, there's more evidence, according to Bill Binney and other experts, that he
[35:30.240 --> 35:35.400]  is more likely a U.S. intelligence asset when I say he, this persona.
[35:35.400 --> 35:40.560]  Now the problem here, of course, is that they keep repeating the same false narrative like
[35:40.560 --> 35:42.640]  we're dummies, like nobody got it.
[35:42.640 --> 35:47.160]  And then you have Andrew Weissman, the number two man, really the number one man in the
[35:47.160 --> 35:50.440]  Mueller investigation with a stunning up end.
[35:50.440 --> 35:55.280]  We need to drag Roger Stone in front of the grand jury to find out what he knows.
[35:55.280 --> 35:58.440]  Mr. Weissman, you had three years to do that.
[35:58.440 --> 35:59.440]  You didn't do it.
[35:59.440 --> 36:01.680]  You wrote my indictment personally.
[36:01.680 --> 36:05.080]  Your initials are in the meta tags on the original document.
[36:05.080 --> 36:06.520]  There's no Russian collusion.
[36:06.520 --> 36:08.760]  There's no WikiLeaks collaboration.
[36:08.760 --> 36:13.280]  There's nothing other than the fabricated charges of lying to Congress.
[36:13.280 --> 36:17.800]  But the new narrative here, Owen, is as follows.
[36:17.800 --> 36:23.960]  Roger Stone was aware of misconduct and illegal acts by President Trump, and he traded his
[36:23.960 --> 36:26.120]  silence for commutation.
[36:26.120 --> 36:32.440]  And in this case, the lack of any evidence is the evidence itself.
[36:32.440 --> 36:35.880]  That is how brain dead these people are.
[36:35.880 --> 36:40.080]  There is no such evidence because none of it ever happened.
[36:40.080 --> 36:44.880]  And had they been able to corroborate this, as you know, Owen, they would have charged
[36:44.880 --> 36:49.200]  me with it and used it as an article of impeachment against the president.
[36:49.200 --> 36:52.200]  Well, you predicted this exact thing would happen.
[36:52.200 --> 36:56.640]  I guess it was about a week ago, maybe, with me on the war room or right here on the Alex
[36:56.640 --> 36:57.760]  Jones show.
[36:57.760 --> 36:59.360]  And then sure enough, they rolled it out.
[36:59.360 --> 37:01.600]  They tried to do gotcha interviews with you.
[37:01.600 --> 37:06.560]  And it's all these implications that they make without any evidence, of course.
[37:06.560 --> 37:09.080]  And Trump insisted the same thing.
[37:09.080 --> 37:13.440]  Again, if it was Trump that did any of this stuff, they would have caught him.
[37:13.440 --> 37:14.440]  They would have arrested him.
[37:14.440 --> 37:15.440]  They would have impeached.
[37:15.440 --> 37:16.440]  They have no evidence, folks.
[37:16.440 --> 37:20.720]  All they have is the corrupt media willing to print their false stories time after time
[37:20.720 --> 37:22.080]  after time.
[37:22.080 --> 37:24.680]  And so the president tweeted this out.
[37:24.680 --> 37:31.400]  So we catch Obama and Biden not to even mention the rest of their crew, many of which Roger
[37:31.400 --> 37:35.360]  Stone just mentioned, spying on my campaign and nothing happens.
[37:35.360 --> 37:36.360]  I hope not.
[37:36.360 --> 37:41.200]  If it were the other way around, 50 years for treason, never forget.
[37:41.200 --> 37:46.800]  And you know, believe me, folks, I would like to see justice in this country as much as
[37:46.800 --> 37:47.800]  anybody else.
[37:47.800 --> 37:48.800]  Justice be done.
[37:48.800 --> 37:49.800]  May the heavens fall.
[37:49.800 --> 37:55.120]  I do think that on a certain level, President Trump, and I actually believe Roger Stone
[37:55.120 --> 37:59.200]  has predicted this or we've spoken about this before, but I'll get this take now.
[37:59.200 --> 38:02.880]  I don't think Trump wants to see Obama go down.
[38:02.880 --> 38:12.240]  I don't think Trump wants Obama's quote unquote presidency to be plagued in such a bad way
[38:12.240 --> 38:14.520]  that it makes America look bad.
[38:14.520 --> 38:17.120]  I think that that's kind of what Trump is trying to do here.
[38:17.120 --> 38:20.320]  He's like, look, we'll throw all Obama's henchmen under the bus.
[38:20.320 --> 38:21.560]  They all belong in jail.
[38:21.560 --> 38:28.520]  We'll spare Obama just to really spare America the shame and embarrassment that was his
[38:28.520 --> 38:32.560]  eight years in office and who he really was just a total fraud.
[38:32.560 --> 38:33.560]  But I don't know.
[38:33.560 --> 38:36.760]  Maybe the American people are getting so fed up.
[38:36.760 --> 38:37.760]  They don't even care.
[38:37.760 --> 38:38.760]  Yeah, sure.
[38:38.760 --> 38:41.400]  Obama was the worst president committed all this treason through us under the bus.
[38:41.400 --> 38:42.480]  We got fooled.
[38:42.480 --> 38:45.960]  Maybe America's willing to put that in the textbooks for history.
[38:45.960 --> 38:47.280]  Maybe it's not.
[38:47.280 --> 38:49.080]  But what do you think, Roger?
[38:49.080 --> 38:50.080]  Because Trump is right.
[38:50.080 --> 38:54.840]  I mean, if it was Trump that did any of this, he would be facing treason charge.
[38:54.840 --> 38:55.840]  Absolutely.
[38:55.840 --> 38:58.680]  Well, Owen, I don't want to second guess the president of the United States.
[38:58.680 --> 39:03.240]  I've just gotten a text message from Alex Jones that says, please talk about Russia
[39:03.240 --> 39:06.760]  more and whatever you do, don't talk about the next election.
[39:06.760 --> 39:11.520]  So I think we will now talk about the 2020 election.
[39:11.520 --> 39:16.000]  This is really the key because whether or not the criminal conspiracy that took place
[39:16.000 --> 39:22.560]  in 2016 and since then, whether or not this illegal coup is ultimately prosecuted really
[39:22.560 --> 39:26.360]  depends on the outcome of the next election.
[39:26.360 --> 39:31.400]  And therefore, I'd like to tell you what I think is going on because I know a number
[39:31.400 --> 39:34.400]  of the president's supporters are dispirited.
[39:34.400 --> 39:37.960]  The number of them are upset.
[39:37.960 --> 39:43.760]  The Rhino Republicans, the country club Republicans who had to pretend they were for Donald Trump
[39:43.760 --> 39:46.040]  when he became extraordinarily popular.
[39:46.040 --> 39:50.760]  But when he became extraordinarily popular, nobody would ever really for him at all.
[39:50.760 --> 39:54.000]  I've now already headed to the high grass.
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.760]  They're conceding defeat.
[39:55.760 --> 40:00.440]  There's at least one member of his current campaign staff who's out secretly shopping
[40:00.440 --> 40:06.480]  a tell all memoir book, assuming his defeat, but I don't feel that way at all.
[40:06.480 --> 40:10.880]  I think that when you look at the top five issues in the country, the president's on
[40:10.880 --> 40:15.720]  the right side of all of them and Joe Biden is on the wrong side of all of them.
[40:15.720 --> 40:22.400]  Now it is true that the president was forced because of the coronavirus crisis to throw
[40:22.400 --> 40:23.920]  away his whole card.
[40:23.920 --> 40:29.360]  I mean, the cornerstone of his reelection strategy, as it should have been, was based
[40:29.360 --> 40:30.360]  on the economy.
[40:30.360 --> 40:33.920]  It is the number one issue in the country.
[40:33.920 --> 40:38.720]  Although some polls now show coronavirus is the number one issue, that's because the
[40:38.720 --> 40:43.560]  media just pushes that line relentlessly.
[40:43.560 --> 40:46.840]  And unfortunately, our economy is in very rough shape.
[40:46.840 --> 40:53.320]  Probably the roughest shape it's been in since the Great Depression, with a few bright spots.
[40:53.320 --> 41:00.680]  To me, every election boils down to the requirement that you must have the ability to define in
[41:00.680 --> 41:06.240]  one sentence why the voters should vote for you and not the other candidate.
[41:06.240 --> 41:08.240]  Here's my stab at that.
[41:08.240 --> 41:12.880]  Our economy is in rough shape because the president had no choice but to protect the
[41:12.880 --> 41:15.880]  public health during the coronavirus crisis.
[41:15.880 --> 41:21.200]  And unfortunately, in doing so, by airing on the side of caution, he had no choice but
[41:21.200 --> 41:23.880]  to shut down America, which destroyed our economy.
[41:23.880 --> 41:27.560]  Now, who do we want to rebuild America's economy?
[41:27.560 --> 41:32.640]  A man who has proven, indisputably, that he knows exactly how to do it.
[41:32.640 --> 41:39.200]  A man who brought us record wage growth, record job creation, record levels of employment,
[41:39.200 --> 41:43.760]  or the other candidate whose medicine will make the sick patient die.
[41:43.760 --> 41:49.560]  Higher taxes, more regulation, more one size fits all trade deals.
[41:49.560 --> 41:51.880]  That is the choice facing America.
[41:51.880 --> 41:53.200]  It's that simple.
[41:53.200 --> 41:55.040]  And Donald Trump has proven himself.
[41:55.040 --> 41:58.600]  Remember, they said, oh, if you elect Trump, there'll be a market crash.
[41:58.600 --> 41:59.800]  There'll be a depression.
[41:59.800 --> 42:05.320]  He brought us the strongest economy in our entire history, and he can do it again.
[42:05.320 --> 42:08.400]  Look at these last two job reports.
[42:08.400 --> 42:14.400]  Despite COVID virus, despite it, the underlying tenants of cutting taxes and cutting regulation
[42:14.400 --> 42:19.800]  and better trade deals under Donald Trump is already bringing America back.
[42:19.800 --> 42:26.440]  To me, it seems like a very, very simple campaign if you will stick to that theme and another
[42:26.440 --> 42:28.800]  theme that I'll discuss on the other side.
[42:28.800 --> 42:32.920]  Oh, and there you have my capsule analysis of 2020.
[42:32.920 --> 42:33.920]  Yeah.
[42:33.920 --> 42:37.120]  And I want to ask you something else on the other side that you may be able to answer
[42:37.120 --> 42:41.520]  unlike anyone else, because I see the left lying about Trump, the media, Hollywood, all
[42:41.520 --> 42:42.880]  these people lying about Trump.
[42:42.880 --> 42:49.640]  And I mean, he kind of just let some do it, really knowing though he could have them all
[42:49.640 --> 42:54.640]  by the short hairs if he wanted to, if he wanted to really save his reputation.
[42:54.640 --> 42:59.080]  I'll ask Roger Stone if that's the case on the other side.
[42:59.080 --> 43:07.640]  It's finally here, introducing the new survival shield X2 Spray, available now for 33% off

[43:58.560 --> 44:03.280]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment.
[44:03.280 --> 44:05.000]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.360]  Really they're a super computer that's handheld.
[44:07.360 --> 44:11.480]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai
[44:11.480 --> 44:17.120]  Comps especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able
[44:17.120 --> 44:21.520]  to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually
[44:21.520 --> 44:25.400]  predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[44:25.400 --> 44:32.160]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[44:32.160 --> 44:33.560]  In their own words, they admit it.
[44:33.560 --> 44:37.360]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more
[44:37.360 --> 44:38.520]  than a decade.
[44:38.520 --> 44:40.480]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[44:40.480 --> 44:41.480]  They're Faraday cages.
[44:41.480 --> 44:43.240]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[44:43.240 --> 44:47.880]  They work absolutely great and it just gives you that security to have power over your
[44:47.880 --> 44:52.400]  data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother to
[44:52.400 --> 44:54.400]  know what you're up to because it's not their business.
[44:54.400 --> 44:59.240]  Get yours at InfowarsStore.com today.
[44:59.240 --> 45:04.920]  Americans have had freedom for so long and most Americans were born into such docile
[45:04.920 --> 45:09.640]  times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[45:09.640 --> 45:14.960]  We don't appreciate the American way truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense,
[45:14.960 --> 45:18.240]  private property because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the
[45:18.240 --> 45:19.240]  world is.
[45:19.240 --> 45:23.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try
[45:23.960 --> 45:28.320]  to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as
[45:28.320 --> 45:33.480]  well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[45:33.480 --> 45:37.720]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly
[45:37.720 --> 45:43.160]  and bad for the earth and we need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that
[45:43.160 --> 45:48.080]  the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[45:48.080 --> 45:54.920]  And that's what COVID-19 is, a global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family,
[45:54.920 --> 45:55.920]  against prosperity and against your future.
[45:55.920 --> 45:56.920]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[45:56.920 --> 46:15.440]  It's the end of the world as we know it, it's the end of the world as we know it, it's the
[46:15.440 --> 46:19.560]  end of the world as we know it and I don't feel fine.
[46:19.560 --> 46:25.880]  This entire takeover has been battle planned, blueprinted, war gained, field marshaled by
[46:25.880 --> 46:30.640]  the psychological war chiefs at the United Nations and the Fortune 100.
[46:30.640 --> 46:37.120]  This is the post-human takeover, the new skits tighter when you comply, not looser.
[46:37.120 --> 46:42.080]  The entire COVID-19 operation as a hoax, now they admit the quote death numbers are dropping
[46:42.080 --> 46:45.720]  because those are fake, where they count people that died of something else, but it's all
[46:45.720 --> 46:50.960]  about how many cases there are and now they're saying most of the population will get it
[46:50.960 --> 46:53.600]  and then no one can go outside ever again.
[46:53.600 --> 46:55.720]  It's totally insane.
[46:55.720 --> 47:02.120]  It's a fraud, it's all a lie.
[47:02.120 --> 47:29.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.

[48:09.840 --> 48:14.000]  right now at infowarstore.com.
[48:14.000 --> 48:21.840]  One of my biggest bugaboos about, I don't even know where I would put it on, I mean
[48:21.840 --> 48:24.960]  it's really just the fake news media and it's incredible.
[48:24.960 --> 48:30.000]  Most people cannot comprehend and or don't want to comprehend the fact that television
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.880]  news about 95% of it is just fake.
[48:32.880 --> 48:35.560]  It's just agenda-driven fake news.
[48:35.560 --> 48:37.240]  It's hard to grasp, folks.
[48:37.240 --> 48:38.240]  It's hard to understand.
[48:38.240 --> 48:44.280]  Now, I've got other stories here that will prove that, but my bugaboo is this, Roger.
[48:44.280 --> 48:48.640]  No matter where you turn on mainstream media, they're lying about Donald Trump.
[48:48.640 --> 48:52.240]  They're lying about him 24-7 around the clock.
[48:52.240 --> 49:00.640]  Unfortunately, this has resulted in a total destruction of his reputation.
[49:00.640 --> 49:05.000]  So now these brainwashed minions think Trump is racist, he's this, he's that, you know,
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  wants to put Cajun.
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.160]  I mean the worst image of the guy, and I mean look, I understand he's fighting for America,
[49:10.160 --> 49:16.520]  but in a way, Trump's reputation and America's future are tied now.
[49:16.520 --> 49:21.360]  And so you know the president personally, and again, when I see him tweet things out
[49:21.360 --> 49:25.820]  like, so we catch Obama and Biden, not to even mention the rest of their crew spying
[49:25.820 --> 49:30.000]  on my campaign and nothing happens, I hope not if it were the other way around, 50 years
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.440]  for treason, never forget.
[49:32.440 --> 49:38.120]  Well look, Donald Trump, the president, can save his own reputation.
[49:38.120 --> 49:44.440]  I think the problem is he would have to destroy the reputations of Obama and Biden and Hollywood
[49:44.440 --> 49:47.440]  and the mainstream news so, so badly.
[49:47.440 --> 49:49.560]  I mean, we'd have to see it all, folks.
[49:49.560 --> 49:54.760]  We're talking about the sex clubs, the sex trafficking, the underage sex with minors
[49:54.760 --> 49:57.800]  that Gislaine Maxwell has access to, all of it.
[49:57.800 --> 50:01.600]  He'd have to, he'd have to say no, look, and he'd have to do it on the national platform
[50:01.600 --> 50:04.800]  and he'd probably have to rule out a lot of the evidence that they have.
[50:04.800 --> 50:11.120]  Well, look, I think it needs to be done because America needs to know the truth, not about
[50:11.120 --> 50:15.760]  Donald Trump, but about the Hollywood celebrities that they worshiped, about the television
[50:15.760 --> 50:19.800]  news anchors that they trusted, the politicians that they thought were telling them the truth
[50:19.800 --> 50:23.160]  and had their best interests, all liars.
[50:23.160 --> 50:29.440]  So I ask you this, Roger, as we have Mark Meadows and others calling for jail for Obama and
[50:29.440 --> 50:34.480]  crew for the treason they engaged in, does President Trump, do you believe there's any
[50:34.480 --> 50:39.400]  interest there for him to save his reputation in the sense that his reputation is now directly
[50:39.400 --> 50:42.440]  correlated and tied to America's future?
[50:42.440 --> 50:48.280]  Well, I really can't respond to your question, Owen, because last Friday was the first time
[50:48.280 --> 50:53.520]  I've spoken to the president in several years because of my legal situation, the fact that
[50:53.520 --> 50:58.040]  he was under investigation for much of that time, unjustly, of course.
[50:58.040 --> 51:02.640]  I can't echo exactly what you say about the fake news media because I've just been through
[51:02.640 --> 51:03.640]  this.
[51:03.640 --> 51:11.200]  Last Friday, I taped an interview for a LA-based progressive radio host, Mo Kelly, whose show
[51:11.200 --> 51:16.440]  I had done previously and with whom we had found common ground in our opposition to the
[51:16.440 --> 51:18.680]  racist war on drugs.
[51:18.680 --> 51:21.920]  But this broadcast was a technological disaster.
[51:21.920 --> 51:25.080]  They cut my audio feed three times.
[51:25.080 --> 51:29.680]  The second time when they brought me back in, I was in the middle of some other show in
[51:29.680 --> 51:34.080]  which a woman and a man were speaking in French.
[51:34.080 --> 51:40.240]  I hung up, I called back in, and the first question I got from Mo Kelly was whether
[51:40.240 --> 51:45.720]  I had just called him a negro, which, of course, I hadn't.
[51:45.720 --> 51:51.920]  Then he went on for the rest of the program and escalated my derriere as if nothing was
[51:51.920 --> 51:52.920]  wrong.
[51:52.920 --> 51:58.240]  So if I had called him this so-called racial slur, a lot of my black friends argue it's
[51:58.240 --> 52:02.600]  not a slur, but let's put that aside because I didn't say it.
[52:02.600 --> 52:06.200]  Why didn't he react more aggressively?
[52:06.200 --> 52:12.200]  But then, late on Saturday night, he puts out a very cleaned up and I think enhanced
[52:12.200 --> 52:16.200]  soundtrack in which he says that I used that word.
[52:16.200 --> 52:24.280]  Now anybody who knows me knows that I have been a lifelong proponent of civil rights.
[52:24.280 --> 52:28.780]  I opposed Ronald Reagan's decision when I was working for him not to extend the Voting
[52:28.780 --> 52:29.780]  Rights Act.
[52:29.780 --> 52:35.280]  I'm the last conservative alive who still defends the policy of affirmative action
[52:35.280 --> 52:41.040]  advantages for people of color when it comes to jobs and employment, federal contracts.
[52:41.040 --> 52:48.520]  I have a 30-year record of opposing the war on drugs, which I have called an agonominious
[52:48.520 --> 52:53.680]  racist failure, which falls disproportionately on people of color.
[52:53.680 --> 53:01.760]  I have crusaded for a pardon for Marcus Garvey, the early civil rights leader who was framed
[53:01.760 --> 53:08.120]  by the FBI because he was becoming a growing political force in America, and lastly, I
[53:08.120 --> 53:14.080]  have been a giant proponent of the President's Second Chance Act, which is fixing the excesses
[53:14.080 --> 53:20.240]  of Joe Biden and Bill Clinton under which people are being sent to prison for harsh
[53:20.240 --> 53:27.040]  mandatory penalties for the first time nonviolent crime of possession of small amounts of drugs.
[53:27.040 --> 53:32.560]  So 88% of those people who have been incarcerated, the numbers doubled since, more than doubled
[53:32.560 --> 53:36.120]  since 1994, are African Americans.
[53:36.120 --> 53:38.720]  So this whole notion is absurd.
[53:38.720 --> 53:45.640]  Now I have sent the tape out for analysis to a forensic sound engineer, and I'll have
[53:45.640 --> 53:47.280]  a report here shortly.
[53:47.280 --> 53:55.640]  But I believe this is part and parcel of a strategy on the left to mark anyone who disagrees
[53:55.640 --> 53:57.200]  with them as a racist.
[53:57.200 --> 54:03.800]  What's disappointing is, when The New York Times reports this story, they don't say alleged
[54:03.800 --> 54:08.480]  or Kelly said, and they never call Roger Stone for comment.
[54:08.480 --> 54:12.400]  They just say, Roger Stone said a racial slur.
[54:12.400 --> 54:15.560]  Well, I don't agree with that analysis.
[54:15.560 --> 54:20.440]  Even the Daily Beast, which is really the bottom of the barrel, says it appears that
[54:20.440 --> 54:21.440]  Stone did so.
[54:21.440 --> 54:25.480]  Well, I didn't do so, and I think I'll be able to prove that shortly.
[54:25.480 --> 54:26.480]  It's a smear.
[54:26.480 --> 54:28.760]  But Roger, that's my point here.
[54:28.760 --> 54:31.880]  You're willing to defend your reputation to the hilt.
[54:31.880 --> 54:36.000]  And again, my question is, do you believe the president has that same agenda?
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.080]  Because he should come out and say, hey, look, all these people that are calling me racist
[54:40.080 --> 54:41.880]  all day long are liars.
[54:41.880 --> 54:43.400]  They all flew on Epstein's plane.
[54:43.400 --> 54:45.400]  I mean, he needs to list them off.
[54:45.400 --> 54:49.680]  He needs to come on air and say, no, look, these people are engaged in sex trafficking
[54:49.680 --> 54:50.800]  with minors.
[54:50.800 --> 54:54.440]  They have no room to put any sort of claim against me.
[54:54.440 --> 54:55.440]  That is false.
[54:55.440 --> 54:57.360]  I mean, but that's what I'm asking you.
[54:57.360 --> 54:58.360]  Has he measured that?
[54:58.360 --> 55:02.400]  Is he is he willing to go on a fair defense?
[55:02.400 --> 55:06.160]  I'm unable to answer your question, Owen, because I haven't taught campaign strategy
[55:06.160 --> 55:08.240]  with him in over two years.
[55:08.240 --> 55:13.040]  I do know that he's an extraordinary, extraordinary communicator.
[55:13.040 --> 55:16.160]  He does understand what the deep state has done here.
[55:16.160 --> 55:19.480]  We're moving into a campaign season.
[55:19.480 --> 55:23.600]  And I think at the end of the day, many of the issues that you list will be the keys
[55:23.600 --> 55:24.600]  to victory.
[55:24.600 --> 55:30.400]  But the two keys are the economy, which we've already discussed, and the role that Joe Biden
[55:30.400 --> 55:36.520]  and Bill Clinton played in the mass incarceration of more black people than anyone in American
[55:36.520 --> 55:37.520]  history.
[55:37.520 --> 55:42.520]  If you want to talk about social justice and criminal justice, Donald Trump has done more
[55:42.520 --> 55:49.440]  between the record low unemployment rates for African Americans, the increases for African
[55:49.440 --> 55:57.560]  American colleges, and the incredible Second Chance Act than any recent Democratic president
[55:57.560 --> 55:58.560]  has done.
[55:58.560 --> 56:03.520]  Bill Clinton, a great proponent of the African Americans, he went to the U.S. Supreme Court
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.960]  to argue that racial profiling by the Arkansas State Police was perfectly all right.
[56:08.960 --> 56:12.920]  So he used the dog whistle when it suited him.
[56:12.920 --> 56:18.280]  And we know Joe Biden said that if we that if we integrated the public schools, they'd
[56:18.280 --> 56:20.040]  be a jungle.
[56:20.040 --> 56:23.240]  I don't want my kids going to school in a jungle, he said.
[56:23.240 --> 56:25.520]  If that isn't a racist comment, what is?
[56:25.520 --> 56:29.520]  But again, different standards for conservative Republicans.
[56:29.520 --> 56:31.160]  I reiterate my denial.
[56:31.160 --> 56:33.360]  I will prove it shortly.
[56:33.360 --> 56:38.720]  This is a typical smear, but they all jump right back on NBC, which employs a number
[56:38.720 --> 56:45.400]  of CIA full-time operatives, ABC, CNN, The New York Post.
[56:45.400 --> 56:51.280]  It really is dispiriting because under journalistic rules, journalism 101, the first thing they
[56:51.280 --> 56:56.560]  teach you is if you're going to report on a person, you call that person and give them
[56:56.560 --> 56:58.760]  a chance to respond.
[56:58.760 --> 57:00.520]  They do that at Bloomberg News.
[57:00.520 --> 57:02.440]  They usually do it at ABC.
[57:02.440 --> 57:08.120]  I can't name any other news organization that fulfills that basic journalistic responsibility.
[57:08.120 --> 57:09.120]  Yeah.
[57:09.120 --> 57:15.040]  And it's always the farthest left liberal progressive news outlets that are the last
[57:15.040 --> 57:16.680]  one that will ever call you for a comment.
[57:16.680 --> 57:22.240]  They'll write a hundred stories about you, and they'll never even request a comment.
[57:22.240 --> 57:26.080]  Even if they didn't want to print it, just for journalistic integrity purposes, they
[57:26.080 --> 57:28.920]  would at least file a request to say they did it.
[57:28.920 --> 57:30.120]  No folks, not the case.
[57:30.120 --> 57:36.160]  But you know what, there's still 100 days plus, I believe, to the next election now.
[57:36.160 --> 57:39.400]  They may try to keep a presidential debate from happening, which would be President
[57:39.400 --> 57:43.800]  Trump's biggest platform to lay these people out and filet them, but he needs to do it.
[57:43.800 --> 57:48.880]  It's time for him to save America as well as his own reputation.
[57:48.880 --> 57:52.480]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years, and if you go back to those
[57:52.480 --> 57:59.360]  shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master
[57:59.360 --> 58:05.320]  computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict large
[58:05.320 --> 58:09.520]  groups of human movements and activities, but even predict what individuals would do,
[58:09.520 --> 58:14.400]  and then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing, you could add stimuli
[58:14.400 --> 58:20.280]  through the AI systems, through the computers, through digital billboards, through face scanning,
[58:20.280 --> 58:24.560]  through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you wanted to.
[58:24.560 --> 58:28.880]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say, we were making it up.
[58:28.880 --> 58:33.480]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint
[58:33.480 --> 58:34.480]  documents.
[58:34.480 --> 58:38.560]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this
[58:38.560 --> 58:43.640]  control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out, and it's something about a thousand
[58:43.640 --> 58:49.480]  times crazier than what Hitler planned, so we might want to dismantle the system now.
[58:49.480 --> 58:56.560]  We are selling more privacy pockets a day than we were previously selling in a month
[58:56.560 --> 59:00.560]  because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact tracing and admittedly with Google
[59:00.560 --> 59:04.360]  and Apple tracking all Americans on their phones, even if you opt out of it or get rid
[59:04.360 --> 59:05.560]  of the apps.
[59:05.560 --> 59:10.760]  People realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling your data and using it to
[59:10.760 --> 59:15.480]  control your life, sharing it with antifuzz, sharing it with Black Lives Matter, sharing
[59:15.480 --> 59:20.080]  it with the deep state to oppress not just high-profile people, but the general public.
[59:20.080 --> 59:24.720]  That's why folks are taking back control of their lives with these little Faraday cages
[59:24.720 --> 59:29.000]  that you can put your cell phones in that knock out the ability of the cell towers to
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.480]  ping at every few seconds and track your location.
[59:31.480 --> 59:36.040]  This is the only way to have your privacy and people are taking their privacy back and
[59:36.040 --> 59:37.540]  it's very, very exciting.
[59:37.540 --> 59:43.080]  They're at $19.95 a piece at infowarstore.com, we've ordered even more huge shipments coming
[59:43.080 --> 59:51.680]  in next week, so get yours now and be part of the movement to cut Big Brother off.
[59:51.680 --> 1:00:11.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:17.880]  So as you know, social media companies are censoring the president and much of the content
[1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:20.080]  that he is putting out.
[1:00:20.080 --> 1:00:25.360]  Here is a latest example of a campaign video that the president put on Twitter that was
[1:00:25.360 --> 1:00:26.360]  removed.
[1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:34.200]  What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government
[1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:51.680]  is controlled by the people.
[1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:58.240]  For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government
[1:00:58.240 --> 1:01:05.560]  while the people have borne the cost.
[1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:14.040]  The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.
[1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:40.040]  That all changes starting right here and right now.
[1:01:40.040 --> 1:01:54.560]  Fun.
[1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:58.560]  Go! I killed everything I said I didn't even know I tried
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:04.560]  It all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried
[1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:28.560]  Go!
[1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:36.560]  A powerful really barely even a campaign video just kind of a powerful video of where we're at right now in the United States
[1:02:36.560 --> 1:02:44.560]  Now it was allegedly removed and Lincoln Park the band from Chicago Chester Bennington who passed away just a few years ago
[1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:54.560]  Allegedly suicide strangely enough looks like a doppelganger for John Podesta who looks like a doppelganger for Rockefeller
[1:02:54.560 --> 1:03:00.560]  But I digress from that they claim they filed a copyright complaint which is why it got removed
[1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:05.560]  But I'm a little confused by that because I don't even believe that's a Lincoln Park sample
[1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:12.560]  I mean obviously it's a remix of a Lincoln Park track but I don't believe that's actually Lincoln Park
[1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:19.560]  So that's like a whole new web that they're spinning now if you just put up anything of theirs they just claim it's copyright
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:26.560]  But I doubt they've gone after the artist who made that if my basic analysis of that is right
[1:03:26.560 --> 1:03:32.560]  I don't believe that's actually Lincoln Park I don't believe that's actually Chester Bennington singing I think that's just a remake
[1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:41.560]  But Roger this is just another example you know the president needs to understand the censorship on social media is costing him big time
[1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:51.560]  And it's time for him to fight back against the tech giants that are violating his free speech and the free speech of millions of Americans
[1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:57.560]  Well Owen you don't need to tell me the day that my sentence was commuted
[1:03:57.560 --> 1:04:06.560]  It was announced by Facebook that I was being banned for life because I own and control 100 fake Facebook pages
[1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:15.560]  There's only one problem with this claim it is completely and totally false and the company that created this lie, Graphica
[1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:19.560]  I have no choice now to bring a legal action against them
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:26.560]  A very clever blend of truth where I have legitimate rights to say things on social media and outright falsehoods
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:34.560]  But they want to gag you before they lynch you and they want to lynch the country and they want to gag the patriots
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:43.560]  It's the number one issue in America and the Trump Justice Department must take action before the next election
[1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:49.560]  It is one of the absolute keys to the president's reelection Internet freedom
[1:04:49.560 --> 1:05:05.560]  Yeah and we can get more into that but folks it basically just allows the fake news to dominate the media sphere
[1:05:19.560 --> 1:05:21.560]  And yes the American Eagle are Nazis
[1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:28.560]  No George Soros that funds, snopes and media matters and the rest of them, he's the real Nazi collaborator
[1:05:28.560 --> 1:05:31.560]  But this shirt I think is really the perfect campaign shirt
[1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:34.560]  We made one even better than what Trump's people came up with
[1:05:34.560 --> 1:05:38.560]  Two different versions of it with something even worse the Betsy Ross flag
[1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:43.560]  Our first flag that they also say is racist even though she was a famous abolitionist
[1:05:43.560 --> 1:05:46.560]  So these shirts are at infowars.com
[1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:51.560]  The American Eagle, Betsy Ross flags, two different designs, guaranteed to spread the word
[1:05:51.560 --> 1:06:18.560]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny? Well so does he, live from the infowars.com studios
[1:06:18.560 --> 1:06:26.560]  It's Alex Jones and now your host Owen Troyer
[1:06:26.560 --> 1:06:33.560]  Traders among us ladies and gentlemen, they're on TV
[1:06:33.560 --> 1:06:39.560]  They're in the press, they're in the Democrat party, they're in the Republican party
[1:06:39.560 --> 1:06:49.560]  They are in the streets of America burning things down, in governor's mansions, in mayor roles
[1:06:49.560 --> 1:06:53.560]  And they now feel more emboldened than ever
[1:06:53.560 --> 1:06:59.560]  And so they're going in, burning police stations to the ground, attacking police officers, murdering people
[1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:16.560]  Shootings in New York are soaring every week, it's totally out of control and it's all, all promoted, celebrated, justified by the Democrat party, by the mainstream media
[1:07:16.560 --> 1:07:28.560]  Something has to give here, ladies and gentlemen, when you have trained terrorists, trained anarchists
[1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:35.560]  Being used as a violent insurrection wing, whose middleman is the Democrat party in the television media
[1:07:35.560 --> 1:07:46.560]  Who on top of it all is the George Soros' and the major funders of this evil
[1:07:46.560 --> 1:07:51.560]  And so you're just seeing some of the b-roll of this, it's happening every night in Democrat run cities
[1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:59.560]  It's amazing that painting BLM on the streets didn't solve any of these crimes, it's only actually increased since you allowed the riot mobs
[1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:06.560]  The Democrat riot mafia mobs to commit violence that they just keep getting more and more violent
[1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:10.560]  So this doesn't end well, I'd like to see it end peacefully
[1:08:10.560 --> 1:08:16.560]  I still measure the only way to bring these people to reality is to just present them with all the facts
[1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:22.560]  That Hillary Clinton and others have engaged in, that's been going on for years
[1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:27.560]  The truth about Barack Obama, who he is, the treason he committed, just lay it all out
[1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:33.560]  Just make these people side with the most evil people on earth and make them recognize that and face that fact
[1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:37.560]  And then let's see if they still have the energy to go out and burn down America
[1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:44.560]  When they figure out that they're working for a pedophile Satan cult that is funding and manipulating every move
[1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:49.560]  So we'll get Roger's take on that if he's ever seen anything like this before in his decades covering politics
[1:08:49.560 --> 1:08:56.560]  Folks, again infowarstore.com, the new and improved privacy pockets
[1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:04.560]  Now I've got four of them in my hand right here and it's about as thick as what one of these used to be
[1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:09.560]  Now I've got four of them on my hand and it's, I mean, these are so lightweight, so comfortable
[1:09:09.560 --> 1:09:16.560]  They're not big and bulky like other ones, totally effective from any of the waves that your cell phone will be emitting
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:23.560]  Totally effective as far as stopping anybody from monitoring your behavior, getting all your data 24-7
[1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:27.560]  So this is something you're going to want to have
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:33.560]  I mean, remember Maxwell, the major sex trafficker, she was using tinfoil
[1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:41.560]  Which is also known to be effective from stopping cell phone waves and stopping frequencies and your cell phone from operating properly
[1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:47.560]  But don't use the tinfoil. This is known to be effective. This is scientifically known to be effective right here
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:51.560]  The privacy pocket available at infowarstore.com
[1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:56.560]  No, it's not because you're a criminal running sex trafficking rings like Gisela and Maxwell
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:00.560]  That you want to keep your identity and your location private
[1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:03.560]  It's because you don't want companies stealing your data 24-7
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:07.560]  You don't want companies tracking and tracing you 24-7
[1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:10.560]  You don't want to be on this COVID tracking and tracing BS
[1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:15.560]  And it's probably going to come a point in time where these things are just going to become necessary
[1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:21.560]  They may even make them illegal. Oh, you're not allowed privacy. Oh, we have to spy on you 24-7
[1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:25.560]  We have to know where you are. You're not even allowed to have privacy
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:31.560]  I mean, they may try to outlaw these folks. They may even try to cease and assist us for even selling these
[1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:37.560]  So get your info wars privacy pocket while you still can protect your privacy, protect your data, protect yourself
[1:10:37.560 --> 1:10:40.560]  With the privacy pocket from infowarstore.com
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:48.560]  Roger, in all your years of political coverage and analysis and involvement
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:51.560]  I would imagine it's not even close. You've never seen anything like this
[1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:55.560]  I mean, just looking at what you've been through, but just seeing what's happening on the streets of America
[1:10:55.560 --> 1:10:59.560]  I mean, in Democrat run cities, it's the most dangerous it's ever been
[1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:02.560]  There's never been more shootings, more murdering nationwide
[1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:09.560]  There's never been just totally out of control populations burning, looting, riding night after night after night
[1:11:09.560 --> 1:11:13.560]  Police seemingly helpless in these situations
[1:11:13.560 --> 1:11:19.560]  And this is the Democrat mafia. This is the Nazi style brown shirt style
[1:11:19.560 --> 1:11:27.560]  Mafia that the media and the Democrats have fueled up, pumped up and lit on fire to go out and destroy America
[1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:33.560]  And then try to blame Trump. I mean, it's a sick twisted thing that these people are doing, Roger
[1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:41.560]  When you see all this happening, what goes through your mind? I mean, did you ever think America would come to this?
[1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:49.560]  Well, Owen, first let me say that I've never seen anything quite like this. When you see the New York City Police Commissioner
[1:11:49.560 --> 1:11:57.560]  His entire high command assaulted, bloodied, beaten, and they don't respond whatsoever
[1:11:57.560 --> 1:12:01.560]  Because they know Mayor de Blasio will not have their back
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:08.560]  And they know the perverted criminal justice system in New York State will prosecute them, not their attackers
[1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:12.560]  We've reached a very sad place in America
[1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:21.560]  I don't know how much longer this can continue because what we see going on in our streets is not legitimate Democratic protest
[1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:30.560]  It is a highly organized, very well funded socialist revolution, socialist and artistic revolution
[1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:36.560]  As one of my good friends, Jacob Engels, the publisher of the Central Florida Post
[1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:42.560]  Again, where Facebook is trying to destroy him. That's his legitimate website and business
[1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:53.560]  He pointed out to me that the police no longer have the backs of any of our police officers
[1:12:53.560 --> 1:12:59.560]  And therefore they are being told to stand down in the face of the violent mob
[1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:06.560]  This is really distressing because it kind of shows you where this election is going
[1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:12.560]  Are the mobs going to dissuade people from showing up at their legal polling places?
[1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:19.560]  And if they do, will the police do anything about that? I don't think that that's the case
[1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:24.560]  I have members in my own family who are police officers who have told me directly
[1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:32.560]  They have been ordered by their superiors to arrest no one for any crime, no matter how heinous
[1:13:32.560 --> 1:13:38.560]  Because nobody will back them, they will end up being prosecuted
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:40.560]  This is really extraordinary
[1:13:40.560 --> 1:13:47.560]  Meanwhile, the voices of reason like Jacob Engels, Roger Stone, Alex Jones, so many others
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:53.560]  We are being silenced so we can't even talk about what's going on in our streets
[1:13:53.560 --> 1:13:59.560]  At the end of the day, the president's number one job is to preserve order
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:12.560]  Now he's shown enormous restraint so far because we understand that an overreaction will be immediately branded as some kind of Hitlerian action and so on
[1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:21.560]  But when they start tearing down statues of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and call them racists, this has gone too far
[1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:31.560]  When they can bloody the head of the New York City Police Commissioner and he's afraid to act because of the towering leadership of Mayor de Blasio
[1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:34.560]  This is going too far
[1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:44.560]  I'm afraid we're where we are headed because the people in the streets who are beating on old people who are targeting people simply because of their race
[1:14:44.560 --> 1:14:54.560]  And seeming to do it with impunity really threatens the absolute bedrock principles of our Constitution and our nation
[1:14:54.560 --> 1:14:58.560]  Owen, God help the United States of America
[1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:02.560]  I've never seen anything like this in my years in politics
[1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:17.560]  And between voter fraud, internet censorship and the lies of the fake news media like CNN, which is not a news organization but a propaganda front for the Chinese communists
[1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:21.560]  I really have grave concerns about the next election
[1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:26.560]  It's not that I don't think Donald Trump is a great candidate or a great communicator
[1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:32.560]  And if I could sleep at night knowing we were going to have an honest election, I think he'd win
[1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:37.560]  But I don't feel that we will have an honest election and you already see them setting the table
[1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:42.560]  Oh, if Trump disputes the election results over fraud, he should be removed by the military
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:46.560]  I think they are projecting, that's what I think
[1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:48.560]  Yeah, because that's all they do
[1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:55.560]  So that means they're getting ready to activate their corrupt military and claim Trump did it to remove him
[1:15:55.560 --> 1:16:00.560]  Stortable food is again available for shipping within three to four weeks
[1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:04.560]  We have it, it's high quality but it's got to be packaged and shipped out to you

[1:16:23.560 --> 1:16:28.560]  Whether Trump wins or loses, the globalists have already created a worldwide depression
[1:16:28.560 --> 1:16:31.560]  Lockdowns on the planetary scale and it's only intensifying
[1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:36.560]  This is one of the big boxes, you've got to get checked off, it's high quality storeable food
[1:16:36.560 --> 1:16:40.560]  My patriot has really good, high quality food at a very affordable price

[1:16:55.560 --> 1:16:59.560]  Been on air in 26 years, starting about 24 years ago
[1:16:59.560 --> 1:17:04.560]  I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors, producers, actors
[1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:07.560]  They wanted to meet with me and they said, what is your formal education?
[1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:10.560]  And I said, well really, nothing but a few years of college
[1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:16.560]  They said, well, how are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard?
[1:17:16.560 --> 1:17:20.560]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable
[1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:24.560]  We'd like you to be in movies, we'd like you to write with us, we'd like you to do voiceovers
[1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:27.560]  You're just a renaissance man, and folks know I was in some movies
[1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:30.560]  And Harry Shearer made statements like that and a lot of others, I'm not bragging
[1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:35.560]  I kept explaining to them, I said, do you understand I didn't come up with any of this?
[1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:40.560]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents
[1:17:40.560 --> 1:17:43.560]  And they would just laugh at me and say, oh no way
[1:17:43.560 --> 1:17:46.560]  Then I would give them the documents, they would get very, very scared
[1:17:46.560 --> 1:17:50.560]  The next time I saw them in a few months and say, man, you're right, this is just topic
[1:17:50.560 --> 1:17:55.560]  Folks, I didn't make any of this up, okay, it's real, it's real
[1:17:55.560 --> 1:18:00.560]  It's Christmas in July, we ran the sale last year, it was very, very popular
[1:18:00.560 --> 1:18:06.560]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election year
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:12.560]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020
[1:18:12.560 --> 1:18:17.560]  It's the American Eagle boldly spreading its wings sitting at the top of Betsy Ross's line
[1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:21.560]  And the shirts are on sale right now in FullerStore.com
[1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:27.560]  I got the idea from the Trump campaign having a similar shirt to media called Nancy, which of course it isn't
[1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:33.560]  And since it's so triggering to the leftist and globalist, well, we're going to make sure there's even more of these on the streets
[1:18:33.560 --> 1:18:37.560]  To spread the word and exercise our First Amendment in the face of these tyrants

[1:19:55.560 --> 1:20:00.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:29.560]  It's an epic time to be alive
[1:20:29.560 --> 1:20:35.560]  The forces of evil are fully activated right now against humanity
[1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:41.560]  The forces of good are just waking up from a coma
[1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:45.560]  So you're starting to see more of this
[1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:50.560]  For example, with a lady in New York City going out to the Black Lives Matter mural twice
[1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:52.560]  And covering it in black paint
[1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:58.560]  Literally did it the first time, got arrested, went to jail, got released, went right back out immediately
[1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:03.560]  You know, it's beyond frustrating
[1:21:03.560 --> 1:21:06.560]  It's beyond frustrating
[1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:11.560]  When...it's just, it's a rigged game, folks
[1:21:11.560 --> 1:21:17.560]  It's a rigged game. If you're a liberal, progressive, the whole system is rigged for you
[1:21:17.560 --> 1:21:22.560]  But if you're a proud American, everything in the system stands against you
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:24.560]  That's the real bias
[1:21:24.560 --> 1:21:26.560]  That's the real discrimination
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:32.560]  A free man and a free woman is the most discriminated against person in the United States right now
[1:21:32.560 --> 1:21:39.560]  But if you're totally for the corrupt establishment of Hollywood and the Democrat Party and the mainstream news
[1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:43.560]  You are fully protected by the establishment
[1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:51.560]  I guess that's why after all these people fall for the propaganda and become their foot soldiers willingly
[1:21:51.560 --> 1:21:54.560]  Because they never really had any leadership
[1:21:54.560 --> 1:21:56.560]  They never really felt like a part of something
[1:21:56.560 --> 1:21:59.560]  So even though they would tell you, oh, it's all corrupt, I'm anti-establishment
[1:21:59.560 --> 1:22:04.560]  As they're out there doing exactly what the establishment wants them to do
[1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:14.560]  There's going to be more patriots and heroes like Miss Betty going out and fighting back
[1:22:14.560 --> 1:22:19.560]  And then that's just going to encourage another one and another one and another one
[1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:24.560]  And the left isn't going to know what hit them, folks
[1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:28.560]  They're not going to know what hit them
[1:22:28.560 --> 1:22:34.560]  And look, here's the problem, these police officers shouldn't even be doing anything about this lady
[1:22:34.560 --> 1:22:36.560]  They should be letting her do this
[1:22:36.560 --> 1:22:42.560]  They let shootings and rioting and mob violence take place in the streets every night in New York City
[1:22:42.560 --> 1:22:46.560]  But a peaceful protester
[1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:49.560]  I mean, hell, if you're a peaceful protester for Black Lives Matter
[1:22:49.560 --> 1:22:52.560]  As you literally burn and pillage and rape and murder all night
[1:22:52.560 --> 1:22:57.560]  Then certainly that's a peaceful protest
[1:22:57.560 --> 1:23:01.560]  There will be more
[1:23:01.560 --> 1:23:05.560]  It's just so heavy, quite frankly
[1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:13.560]  It's just so heavy knowing what needs to be done and knowing what stands in our way
[1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:21.560]  Yeah, you know, that's not going out with a bunch of other thugs with your face covered with a hammer and a bat
[1:23:21.560 --> 1:23:27.560]  And having someone pull down a statue or break a window or something, that's a coward
[1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:29.560]  That's a coward
[1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:31.560]  Yeah, you feel tough in the moment
[1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:35.560]  Yeah, you get that adrenaline rush, that endorphin rush in the moment
[1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:38.560]  Because you've never challenged anything in your life
[1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:43.560]  So yeah, smash in that window
[1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:45.560]  That really gives them a rise
[1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:47.560]  And then they get away with it
[1:23:47.560 --> 1:23:49.560]  And they want to do it again and again and again and again and again
[1:23:49.560 --> 1:23:53.560]  And then they think they run everything
[1:23:53.560 --> 1:24:00.560]  And we just got so much time to go before the election
[1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:09.560]  It just makes me sick knowing everything that the Democrats and the left and the mainstream media is going to try to attempt before we get there
[1:24:09.560 --> 1:24:11.560]  This is just the beginning, folks
[1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:13.560]  This is just the beginning
[1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:25.560]  The state, the brainwashed, indoctrinated state of hatred and violence that the mainstream media and the Democrat Party has put the average left in
[1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:32.560]  The leftist liberal progressive in is so dangerous
[1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:36.560]  So dangerous
[1:24:36.560 --> 1:24:44.560]  There's no stopping it at this point, it's an out of control forest fire and they're throwing gasoline on it
[1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:49.560]  And I'm telling you that the left in America is only about to get crazier
[1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:52.560]  It's only about to get crazier, folks
[1:24:52.560 --> 1:25:00.560]  So, you know, get yourself prepared, however possible
[1:25:00.560 --> 1:25:05.560]  Because this is just the beginning
[1:25:05.560 --> 1:25:14.560]  They're going to do everything they can to keep Trump's words and agenda out of the common public's vision
[1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:20.560]  And instead they're going to keep the lies and the misinformation and everything else
[1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:30.560]  So that their violent mobs still feel justified and legitimate in their terrorism
[1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:37.560]  Someday something's going to give, folks
[1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:44.560]  But look, they have to face what they've been a part of, they need to face what they've been a part of
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:54.560]  You have been under mind control from a Satanist pedophile cult
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:56.560]  That's all of it, folks
[1:25:56.560 --> 1:26:03.560]  When you scrape through all the crap, that's what you find
[1:26:03.560 --> 1:26:10.560]  A worldwide Satanist pedophile cult, sex cult
[1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:16.560]  Working for multiple government agencies, using blackmail for control
[1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:22.560]  And they run Hollywood, they run the media
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:27.560]  For years they've run both the Republican and the Democrat Party, Trump got in and turned it all on its head
[1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:29.560]  That's why the Republicans are actually anti-Trump
[1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:32.560]  Trump is the Republican Party now
[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:37.560]  The old Republican Party still doesn't want Trump in, they're trying to get him out
[1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:44.560]  Just look at what happened in Texas and other places
[1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:49.560]  Something has to be done to break this brainwashing on these leftists in the streets
[1:26:49.560 --> 1:26:58.560]  And it has to be so shocking and horrifying that it cripples them
[1:26:58.560 --> 1:27:01.560]  Yeah, they're going to have to find out about Hillary Clinton involvement with it
[1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:03.560]  They're going to have to find out about who Obama really is
[1:27:03.560 --> 1:27:08.560]  They're going to have to find out about Hollywood's involvement with it
[1:27:08.560 --> 1:27:10.560]  And Epstein
[1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:13.560]  And all, you know what?
[1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:16.560]  See, here's the danger though
[1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:23.560]  Whatever ends up happening with the investigation into Maxwell
[1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:29.560]  Should she stay alive?
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:33.560]  It's going to be used to attack President Trump
[1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:38.560]  And he needs to just lower his head and just bulldoze through it
[1:27:38.560 --> 1:27:42.560]  Because the folks, look, they're going to, they'll put out some deep fake
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:46.560]  I'm sorry to get graphic, but they'll put out some deep fake of a snuff film
[1:27:46.560 --> 1:27:52.560]  Or a child rape film and they'll put Trump's head on it
[1:27:52.560 --> 1:27:55.560]  And they've already got the material from just all their own blackmail
[1:27:55.560 --> 1:27:58.560]  And so they'll just throw something that looks like Trump
[1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:00.560]  And they'll just put some audio backing behind it
[1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:03.560]  And they'll just say, here's Trump, you know, sexually abusing a child
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:06.560]  And they'll probably do that for the election
[1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:09.560]  At least they're thinking about it
[1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:16.560]  And so that's kind of their, that will be their threat or backdrop
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:21.560]  Should President Trump or Bill Barr or anybody actually expose these
[1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:24.560]  Satanist pedophile networks or these sex trafficking networks
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:27.560]  Or all the blackmail that Maxwell and Epstein had
[1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:29.560]  That's what they're going to do
[1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:32.560]  And they've probably been told to President this
[1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:37.560]  Yeah, by the way, Kamala Harris just had some plastic surgery done on her face
[1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:40.560]  Or it's just a different woman, I mean, take your pick
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:43.560]  But it's just joke level at this point
[1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:47.560]  So she must be really making a bid to be the vice president
[1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:51.560]  Or just replace Biden when they say he's physically unable to do it
[1:28:51.560 --> 1:29:18.560]  Which they may do before the election even begins
[1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:32.560]  But the big reason to wear these is then in the stores
[1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:34.560]  When people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask
[1:29:34.560 --> 1:29:39.560]  Say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing
[1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:43.560]  And the M95 mask only control what's coming in, not what's going out
[1:29:43.560 --> 1:29:46.560]  So they quote spread COVID-19, they don't protect from it
[1:29:46.560 --> 1:29:49.560]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back at these control freaks' faces
[1:29:49.560 --> 1:29:52.560]  You buy one for 9.95, you get four more free
[1:29:52.560 --> 1:30:21.560]  They're at cost in fourstore.com

[1:30:38.560 --> 1:30:40.560]  If you don't have the basics already in your body

[1:30:44.560 --> 1:30:46.560]  Whether you're black, whether you're white

[1:32:20.560 --> 1:32:25.560]  It's absolutely out of control, but people now understand that evil was always real
[1:32:25.560 --> 1:32:29.560]  It is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move
[1:32:29.560 --> 1:32:32.560]  Building beneath the surface and now it's emerged
[1:32:32.560 --> 1:32:35.560]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it
[1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:40.560]  I'm praying for America, I'm praying for you, and I know the power of prayer is real and God hears it
[1:32:40.560 --> 1:32:43.560]  We need to come together and pray for an even greater awakening
[1:32:43.560 --> 1:32:45.560]  Pray for Donald Trump to be protected
[1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:50.560]  Pray for him to win a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalist
[1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:53.560]  To awaken and join us in liberty and freedom
[1:32:53.560 --> 1:33:16.560]  God bless you all, please pray for him for us as well
[1:33:24.560 --> 1:33:29.560]  You know I could sit here and tell you all the enemies of America
[1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:36.560]  For example, the Southern Poverty Law Center
[1:33:36.560 --> 1:33:39.560]  That shouldn't even be operational anymore
[1:33:39.560 --> 1:33:44.560]  They should have been sued into oblivion for all of the libel
[1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:52.560]  That they are guilty of over the years, but you know for years they've been putting up listings like this
[1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:55.560]  Whose heritage, public symbols of the Confederacy
[1:33:55.560 --> 1:33:57.560]  And then they just put it all on a map
[1:33:57.560 --> 1:34:03.560]  So they give the targets that the Southern Poverty Law Center literally is the laser
[1:34:03.560 --> 1:34:07.560]  For the Democrat mobs to go start destroying crap
[1:34:07.560 --> 1:34:13.560]  That's the Southern Poverty Law Center, they say, okay, here's your target, go out, seek and destroy
[1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:18.560]  Southern Poverty Law Center should be raided by the FBI
[1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:25.560]  All their assets seized, all their documents seized and investigated for criminal insurrection
[1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:27.560]  And potential treason against this country
[1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:35.560]  That should have happened years ago, but you'll continue to see their minions burning stuff down
[1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:41.560]  Like they're burning down police stations now in Portland
[1:34:41.560 --> 1:34:48.560]  And then federal agents come in to stop the rioting, stop the violence, stop the destruction
[1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:53.560]  And then the ACLU files lawsuit against the federal agents in Portland
[1:34:53.560 --> 1:34:58.560]  So there's another enemy, so there's another organization that needs to be investigated immediately
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:07.560]  All their assets seized, guns drawn, raid on all ACLU's properties tomorrow
[1:35:07.560 --> 1:35:12.560]  Shut the ACLU down, shut media matters down
[1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:18.560]  See, here's the thing, they want us shut down, they've done everything to shut us down
[1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:25.560]  But we're grassroots, they're not grassroots, they get big donations from billionaires like George Soros
[1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:33.560]  And then go out and put out lies and propaganda, lazing targets that then lead to violence and destruction in this country
[1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:40.560]  And then they point the finger at us and say, no, that's what you're doing, no, you're doing that, you've been caught
[1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:47.560]  You're the traitors to this country, you're the violent insurrectionists
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:51.560]  And it's just a joke
[1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:55.560]  And you know what, it's not a joke, it's pathetic
[1:35:55.560 --> 1:36:06.560]  It is pathetic that we don't have the leadership in this country to shut these anti-American insurrectionists down
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:17.560]  See, here's again, this is why these people are so dangerous, that's what they want to do to us
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:25.560]  And so again, it's just like with President Trump battling the satanic, Luciferian child sex trafficking network
[1:36:25.560 --> 1:36:34.560]  They're saying, oh, you can't come after us, we'll aim that at you, we'll claim you were running Gislain Maxwell
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:41.560]  We'll claim you were the one on Epstein Island having sex with kids, even though it wasn't you, we'll claim it was you
[1:36:41.560 --> 1:36:45.560]  It's the same thing, these are the most dangerous people
[1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:52.560]  The scum of the earth that we're dealing with here, only total acceptance of this and removal of it
[1:36:52.560 --> 1:36:57.560]  Otherwise this country is doomed, just like Portland is doomed
[1:36:57.560 --> 1:37:01.560]  So here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to give out the number here
[1:37:01.560 --> 1:37:12.560]  And we're going to take calls in the last segment today, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539
[1:37:12.560 --> 1:37:18.560]  What are we going to do to wake America up?
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:27.560]  Ah boy, we are just in such dire straits man, I really, I can't even focus to cover this news
[1:37:27.560 --> 1:37:31.560]  I really can't
[1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:39.560]  It's just, it's just, it's so devastating and it's the same thing man
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:52.560]  I guess the question is, is America going to be able to wake up from the coma, get off the operating table that was about to dice us up
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:59.560]  Get active, beat the muscle atrophy, and actually save this country
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:06.560]  Or is the coma too strong, we've been asleep too long, it's too little too late, they've got all of the, because here's the thing
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:10.560]  We knew all this was coming folks, I mean that's not even, and I told you so
[1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:15.560]  We've been telling you this for years, I remember I sat here in this very studio about two months ago
[1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:19.560]  I said here's everything that's going to happen since this COVID thing, and it's all come true
[1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:26.560]  Alex Jones has a documentary called In Game, it's now reality 2020
[1:38:26.560 --> 1:38:38.560]  Oh man, it's just, and see this is what makes me really upset, it's the arrogance of these people
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:48.560]  It's the arrogance of the Democrat Party, it's the arrogance of the mainstream media, it's the arrogance of the street thugs
[1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:59.560]  And you know, I guess it's a worldly satisfaction, it's a fleshly satisfaction that I desire
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:10.560]  For these people to face reality, for these people to face justice, for these people to get a hardcore dose of what's real
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:26.560]  And what they deserve to stomp that arrogance out, but you know what, that's really God's job
[1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:38.560]  You know, I feel bad, I feel bad for these people because they're going to be tortured for the rest of their consciousness
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:43.560]  They're going to be tortured
[1:39:43.560 --> 1:39:49.560]  So, I mean, I guess it's just a warning, you know, I guess they just need to be warned
[1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:57.560]  You know what, hey, you know what, have your fun, have your fun with your little violent riots, have your fun with living a lie, have your fun with trying to make us slaves
[1:39:57.560 --> 1:40:04.560]  Have your fun being a total piece of trash human, you know what, you're going to have a little satisfaction in this blink of an eye right here
[1:40:04.560 --> 1:40:18.560]  But let me tell you, when that day comes and you're going to face everything that you've created, everything that you've become, everything that you stood for
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:25.560]  It's going to be shackles on your arms, on your legs, on your soul for the rest of humanity
[1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:30.560]  And any demon that wants to come up and torture you is going to do it
[1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:37.560]  And that's what you're being groomed to do, that's what you're being groomed for
[1:40:37.560 --> 1:40:50.560]  It's just stunning to me, I really just, I can't even fathom, I literally have to think of it like I'm just living in a video game simulation and these are NPCs
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:57.560]  And so I can't take it personally, they literally aren't even real, they're not even real people, they can't be
[1:40:57.560 --> 1:41:06.560]  This can't be reality, these people can't be real, these people can't be humans
[1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:19.560]  So when we come back, I mean folks, I got all the news, I mean, the Democrats have been caught colluding with China, they committed treason, every single damn one of these governors and mayors is in bed with China
[1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:24.560]  That's why they're telling you to wear a mask, okay?
[1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:30.560]  That's why they're going along with the COVID hoax, they're being told to
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:35.560]  Oh boy, it's just, mm, mm, mm
[1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:39.560]  The corruption is so heavy and so deep, it's just sickening
[1:41:39.560 --> 1:41:48.560]  And again, to see these humans so deceived and just not even realizing it, yeah, I got a whole stack of the COVID lies, yeah, I got a whole stack of the Democrats colluding with China
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:58.560]  Yeah, you got the whole stack of all the leftist violence in the streets
[1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:08.560]  But what do you say, I mean, how do you even properly roll this information out?
[1:42:08.560 --> 1:42:16.560]  It just, it is what it is, the left has been completely unchained to engage in domestic terror
[1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:24.560]  And the media just promotes it and the Democrats call them peaceful protesters, I mean, it is sick
[1:42:24.560 --> 1:42:29.560]  So when we come back, I'm going to give each caller 90 seconds, just be ready when I go to you, you'll get 90 seconds
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:35.560]  And folks, remember, InfowarsStore.com Christmas in July specials are happening right now
[1:42:35.560 --> 1:42:40.560]  50% off top selling supplements, free shipping, store-wide
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:46.560]  The brand new Privacy Pocket at InfowarsStore.com is now for sale as well

[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:55.560]  Cannot thank you enough, InfowarsStore.com Christmas in July sale is live right now
[1:42:55.560 --> 1:43:00.560]  Many reasons that the globalist launched this planetary lockdown
[1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:04.560]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes
[1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:08.560]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air
[1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:14.560]  The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation
[1:43:14.560 --> 1:43:21.560]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential
[1:43:21.560 --> 1:43:30.560]  As we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design
[1:43:30.560 --> 1:43:34.560]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into
[1:43:34.560 --> 1:43:39.560]  It's been pre-planned, organized globally and it's extremely predatory
[1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:44.560]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations
[1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:51.560]  The central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power
[1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:55.560]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism
[1:43:55.560 --> 1:44:00.560]  There are a lot of signs that people are really waking up to the new world order and global government
[1:44:00.560 --> 1:44:04.560]  But one of the biggest is privacy pouches
[1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:07.560]  I've been selling these for more than 10 years in the old days
[1:44:07.560 --> 1:44:10.560]  They were 100% effective, now they are, they're a little bitty
[1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:16.560]  Lightweight Faraday cages that small phones and even large cell phones fit into very, very comfortably
[1:44:16.560 --> 1:44:18.560]  And then slip right into your pocket
[1:44:18.560 --> 1:44:21.560]  And these things work great, that way you're not tracked, you're not traced by government
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:25.560]  By big corporations, by big tech, by hackers, by criminals
[1:44:25.560 --> 1:44:28.560]  They're selling your data, they're using it against you
[1:44:28.560 --> 1:44:31.560]  That's why it uses this to be able to predict the future of manipulate markets
[1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:35.560]  It's critical that everyone stop going around with your cell phones being naked
[1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:38.560]  Well I gotta tell you, normally we've probably sold a couple hundred a month
[1:44:38.560 --> 1:44:41.560]  We're selling upwards of a thousand of these a day
[1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:44.560]  Plus we have a good unit and it's also a good price
[1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:45.560]  We have it in four different colors
[1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:48.560]  It's the privacy pockets at infowarstore.com
[1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:51.560]  People are really waking up, I'm seeing it all over the news
[1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:53.560]  That folks are aware of this and are now using these

[1:46:26.560 --> 1:46:30.560]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rola
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:33.560]  And I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar
[1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:35.560]  And I just want to thank you for that man
[1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:40.560]  Well brother, we put more in this than any other long term high quality energy powder there is
[1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:43.560]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country
[1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:45.560]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues
[1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:48.560]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it
[1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:52.560]  I believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there
[1:46:52.560 --> 1:46:54.560]  And you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means a lot to me
[1:46:54.560 --> 1:46:56.560]  Thank you to all your truck drivers, we love you
[1:46:59.560 --> 1:47:02.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:47:09.560 --> 1:47:13.560]  Alright, last segment, every precious second we will use here
[1:47:13.560 --> 1:47:15.560]  So I'm going to talk over the line and go right to the phone lines
[1:47:15.560 --> 1:47:18.560]  You've got 90 seconds, please just be ready to go, skip the pleasantries
[1:47:18.560 --> 1:47:21.560]  Let's start with Mr. Putt in Austin, Texas, go ahead
[1:47:26.560 --> 1:47:33.560]  So he got off the line before you went ahead and started talking about the dehumanizing stuff of your enemies
[1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:36.560]  Wait a second, dehumanizing what?
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:39.560]  Dehumanizing language?
[1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:42.560]  Yeah, calling people energy
[1:47:42.560 --> 1:47:46.560]  Oh, oh, I see, oh, oh, okay, no, no, you're right, dehumanizing language
[1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:49.560]  They're the ones out in the streets destroying property
[1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:52.560]  They're the ones out in the street beating people for their skin color
[1:47:52.560 --> 1:47:55.560]  They're the ones out lying to people destroying their lives and reputations
[1:47:55.560 --> 1:47:58.560]  They're the ones out in the street violent every night burning things to the ground
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:01.560]  People getting murdered, living a lie
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:05.560]  Oh, but I'm dehumanizing them, oh, oh, I love that theory
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:10.560]  Oh, that's great, they go out and act like out of control animals
[1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:13.560]  Who have never been disciplined in their life
[1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:15.560]  They're the ones that are not behaving human
[1:48:15.560 --> 1:48:17.560]  They're the ones that are behaving like demons
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:21.560]  Covering their face, beating people because they don't like their politics or their skin color
[1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:26.560]  And then you call in this show and you say, oh, I'm dehumanizing them
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:30.560]  No, they've been dehumanized by the mainstream media
[1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:34.560]  I want them to be human again, they need to realize the facts
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:36.560]  So don't tell me I have dehumanizing language
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:41.560]  I'm telling you the truth about these people and how they've been dehumanized
[1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:44.560]  By mainstream media and the Democrat Party
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:47.560]  So don't tell me about dehumanizing people
[1:48:47.560 --> 1:48:49.560]  We're trying to bring people back to life
[1:48:49.560 --> 1:48:52.560]  Thanks for the call
[1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:59.560]  Now, let's go to Gerard in Minnesota, go ahead
[1:48:59.560 --> 1:49:03.560]  Yes, sir, thank you for the call
[1:49:03.560 --> 1:49:08.560]  American born veteran patriot, we are at war
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:14.560]  Can't emphasize it enough, more serious than we've ever faced in our lives
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:18.560]  President Trump needs to round up all these criminals
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:22.560]  All these treasonous criminals and put them behind bars
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:24.560]  The American people deserve this
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:27.560]  We, the people that elected him, want to see this
[1:49:27.560 --> 1:49:30.560]  And the whole world needs to see it
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:34.560]  He can't sit back and wonder, well, should I do this?
[1:49:34.560 --> 1:49:37.560]  Well, what are they going to say if I do that?
[1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:40.560]  No, he needs to listen to his gut
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:44.560]  They're going to demonize him and criminalize him anyway
[1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:46.560]  No matter what
[1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:50.560]  The election is at stake, our constitutional rights are at stake
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:54.560]  And all of our freedoms can be gone in an instant
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:55.560]  And they've already done that
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:49:58.560]  I mean, look at what they've gotten away with with the fake pandemic
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:02.560]  Oh, my gosh, I can't believe this nonsense
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:05.560]  It's a pandemic, of course, been planned for years
[1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:07.560]  You have all the evidence in front of you
[1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:11.560]  I would like to get your honest opinion and take, I think I know it already
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:16.560]  But there's a lot of people that need to hear it
[1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:21.560]  Well, look, I can sit here and go back to the months of research and coverage we've done of this
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:24.560]  I mean, so ahead of the curve, it's ridiculous
[1:50:24.560 --> 1:50:28.560]  I mean, but it's just like, I hate being redundant
[1:50:28.560 --> 1:50:30.560]  And I know most of the audience already knows this
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:33.560]  But we forget to understand that we get new audience members every day
[1:50:33.560 --> 1:50:35.560]  But here's what I will say
[1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:42.560]  This is why all the big tech platforms and all of Silicon Valley
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:46.560]  And all the slave labor workshops of Apple and Google
[1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:49.560]  This is why they took us off their platforms, folks
[1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:52.560]  Because they knew they were going to run this fake pandemic
[1:50:52.560 --> 1:50:55.560]  And they could not have info wars on the internet
[1:50:55.560 --> 1:51:02.560]  Dominating them, dominating them, dominating them
[1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:04.560]  And so that's why they removed us
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:08.560]  Because they know that, hey, the average American has no clue what planet they're on, quite frankly
[1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:12.560]  Not even trying to be insulting, they just, they've just been living in La La Land
[1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:16.560]  And so, oh, they stumble upon info wars and it's just like, bing!
[1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:18.560]  Just like a lightning bolt hits a receiver, just bing!
[1:51:18.560 --> 1:51:23.560]  And then all those intuitions, all those thoughts and consciousness
[1:51:23.560 --> 1:51:25.560]  That's been laying dormant just comes alive
[1:51:25.560 --> 1:51:29.560]  And so they had to get rid of us so they could run a fake pandemic and make everyone slaves
[1:51:29.560 --> 1:51:31.560]  Thanks for the call, Gerard
[1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:34.560]  Let's go to Shannon in California
[1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:36.560]  Go ahead, Shannon
[1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:38.560]  Hey, Owen, thanks for taking my call so much
[1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:40.560]  Huge support to you guys
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:44.560]  Don't give up, just don't give up what you're doing
[1:51:44.560 --> 1:51:50.560]  I'm going to, I'm going to focus on specifically something I want to share that
[1:51:50.560 --> 1:51:55.560]  Lightingly exposes how much of a hoax this is in California
[1:51:55.560 --> 1:51:57.560]  And of course everywhere this pandemic
[1:51:57.560 --> 1:52:03.560]  I was at the Riverside County Board of Agenda meetings on May 5th and May 8th
[1:52:03.560 --> 1:52:05.560]  For Riverside County
[1:52:05.560 --> 1:52:13.560]  I, along with several hundred other patriots, put pressure on them to lift the current mandate at that time
[1:52:13.560 --> 1:52:16.560]  And then they lifted it, May 9th
[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:19.560]  It was supposed to go until June 19th
[1:52:19.560 --> 1:52:27.560]  Well, lo and behold, Newsom puts the current mandate on lockdowns and mask wearing
[1:52:27.560 --> 1:52:30.560]  When did it, when did it start? June 19th
[1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:34.560]  So how come is it that there's specific dates?
[1:52:34.560 --> 1:52:38.560]  If only because they have it all planned out
[1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:43.560]  Well, and not only that, of course, it makes no sense scientifically to say
[1:52:43.560 --> 1:52:47.560]  Oh, we're going to make a mask mandate starting, you know, tomorrow at noon
[1:52:47.560 --> 1:52:51.560]  Or, oh, you know, we have to limit crowds of this many people at this time
[1:52:51.560 --> 1:52:52.560]  It's just all a hoax
[1:52:52.560 --> 1:52:56.560]  And in a weird sick way, they're just seeing how much they can get away with
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:52:59.560]  They're just seeing how dumb their minions are
[1:52:59.560 --> 1:53:01.560]  They're just seeing how dumb the population is
[1:53:01.560 --> 1:53:07.560]  And boy, oh boy, are they getting a big fat, a big fat response with all these people putting on a mask
[1:53:07.560 --> 1:53:08.560]  They're not even questioning it
[1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:15.560]  And again, folks, I mean, it's not fun, but it's just, like, we warned you of all of this
[1:53:15.560 --> 1:53:19.560]  I mean, even to the point where I said, look, they're going to start making people wear masks
[1:53:19.560 --> 1:53:21.560]  And then they're going to make it trendy
[1:53:21.560 --> 1:53:24.560]  So that people start putting up their pictures and selfies of people in masks
[1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:26.560]  And even conservatives are doing it now
[1:53:26.560 --> 1:53:28.560]  It's the mark of slavery
[1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:31.560]  Don't put that thing on proudly
[1:53:31.560 --> 1:53:34.560]  If you're going to do it, do something a little bit rebellious at least
[1:53:34.560 --> 1:53:37.560]  I mean, geez, Shannon, thanks for the call
[1:53:37.560 --> 1:53:41.560]  James in Pennsylvania, you're on the Alex Jones show, go ahead
[1:53:41.560 --> 1:53:42.560]  Thank you very much
[1:53:42.560 --> 1:53:50.560]  I just want to say that once again, this is an attack on Christianity, white, red-blooded Americans
[1:53:50.560 --> 1:53:54.560]  Versus the interdimensional reptilian child molesters
[1:53:54.560 --> 1:53:56.560]  Let's really talk about what it is
[1:53:56.560 --> 1:53:57.560]  That's what this is
[1:53:57.560 --> 1:54:00.560]  That's what is going on right now in this country
[1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:02.560]  This is a communist takeover
[1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:07.560]  This is going on reptilian interdimensional child molesters
[1:54:07.560 --> 1:54:11.560]  That want to eat your kids, America
[1:54:11.560 --> 1:54:13.560]  That's what's happening
[1:54:13.560 --> 1:54:16.560]  Well, look, there's a thing that these guys have in common
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:20.560]  Fauci, Obama, Gates, Chuck Schumer
[1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:24.560]  And I'm not sure if it's reptilian stuff
[1:54:24.560 --> 1:54:27.560]  But let's just say it's blackmailable stuff
[1:54:27.560 --> 1:54:32.560]  And, well, we'll just leave it that
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:33.560]  Thanks for the call, James
[1:54:33.560 --> 1:54:36.560]  Let's go to Corinne in Michigan
[1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:38.560]  Corinne, go ahead
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:40.560]  Hi, Owen, how are you?
[1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:42.560]  I haven't called in a while
[1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:43.560]  Thanks for calling
[1:54:43.560 --> 1:54:48.560]  You know, I got a 96-year-old aunt in Portland
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:56.560]  And the mayor and the governor should be brought to a rest
[1:54:56.560 --> 1:55:00.560]  In that city
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:03.560]  Well, look, they have a choice
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:06.560]  They've already chose to launch a war against America
[1:55:06.560 --> 1:55:08.560]  They've already started a hot civil war
[1:55:08.560 --> 1:55:10.560]  We're not falling for it right now
[1:55:10.560 --> 1:55:11.560]  But they have a choice
[1:55:11.560 --> 1:55:14.560]  They can either continue to make this bed
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:18.560]  Of being the anti-American communist scum that they are
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:20.560]  And eventually they'll have to deal with it
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:21.560]  The chickens will come home to roost
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:23.560]  Or they can back off now
[1:55:23.560 --> 1:55:26.560]  But I don't think they're backing off
[1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:28.560]  I think they're going for broke here
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:30.560]  I really think they're coming for us
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:32.560]  And all the signs are there
[1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:35.560]  This is their final move to take America out
[1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:40.560]  Well, I want to say that, you know, I'm in Michigan
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:47.560]  And Whitney is a pain in the, you know what?
[1:55:47.560 --> 1:55:49.560]  Yeah, she's a total tyrant
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:51.560]  Exactly, no, she's a complete tyrant
[1:55:51.560 --> 1:55:54.560]  I can't even imagine that she gets away with it
[1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:56.560]  It's just, like, that's what I'm saying
[1:55:56.560 --> 1:55:58.560]  Like, why are any security or police even protecting
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:00.560]  These people anymore?
[1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:02.560]  Like, why are police arresting the lady
[1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:04.560]  Who goes out there, paints over Black Lives Matter
[1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:06.560]  Propaganda in the streets
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:08.560]  When Black Lives Matter wants all these police dead
[1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:10.560]  Why wouldn't they let her go?
[1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:13.560]  People need to just quit being pawns, man
[1:56:13.560 --> 1:56:15.560]  Start thinking for themselves
[1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:17.560]  Thanks for the call, Corinne
[1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:20.560]  All right, let's go to Dan in New York
[1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:23.560]  Go ahead, Dan
[1:56:23.560 --> 1:56:24.560]  Hi, Owen
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:26.560]  First off, I just want to thank you for all the work that you do
[1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:29.560]  You and the crew there, especially on a Sunday
[1:56:29.560 --> 1:56:31.560]  And I'm calling with a piece of good news today
[1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:33.560]  So I'm in New York City and I was out
[1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:35.560]  Working out in Riverside Park
[1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:40.560]  And there were hundreds of boats sporting Trump flags
[1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:42.560]  I mean, hundreds, and there were yachts
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:43.560]  There were jet skis
[1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:45.560]  But see, you don't get to see that on the news
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:47.560]  They censor all those people on social media
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:50.560]  So when they go with the, oh, and they run their fake polls
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:51.560]  Even on Fox News now
[1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:53.560]  Saying Biden's beating Trump in a national poll
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:55.560]  So that they can steal the election
[1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:57.560]  And act like, oh, no, it's legitimate
[1:56:57.560 --> 1:56:58.560]  Trump has no support
[1:56:58.560 --> 1:56:59.560]  Dan, thanks for the call
[1:56:59.560 --> 1:57:01.560]  Final call are Kayla and Colorado
[1:57:01.560 --> 1:57:04.560]  Go ahead
[1:57:04.560 --> 1:57:05.560]  Hi
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:07.560]  Thank you so much for having me
[1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:08.560]  And for Info Wars
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:09.560]  For doing what you're doing
[1:57:09.560 --> 1:57:11.560]  And for President Donald Trump
[1:57:11.560 --> 1:57:12.560]  For doing what he's doing
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:15.560]  And fighting this silence and spiritual
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:18.560]  And physical war we seem to be in
[1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:21.560]  What I think needs to happen in this country right now
[1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:23.560]  Pretty much, you know
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:26.560]  There is a big problem with child sex trafficking going on
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:29.560]  All childhood pedophilia must be exposed
[1:57:29.560 --> 1:57:30.560]  In these high-level policies
[1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:31.560]  Yeah, and isn't it amazing
[1:57:31.560 --> 1:57:32.560]  As this is being called out
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:34.560]  Fully exposed with Maxwell and Epstein
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:35.560]  The WikiLeaks emails and everything
[1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:38.560]  And Disney and mainstream news
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:40.560]  Is literally covering it up, folks
[1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:41.560]  That should scare all of us
[1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:43.560]  I'll be back hosting the Alex Jones show tomorrow
[1:57:43.560 --> 1:57:45.560]  11 a.m. You stay classy, Info Warriors
[1:58:14.560 --> 1:58:16.560]  To make everyone wear a mask
[1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:17.560]  Even though just months ago
[1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:19.560]  We had the Surgeon General and others say
[1:58:19.560 --> 1:58:21.560]  Don't wear a mask, it's all fraud
[1:58:21.560 --> 1:58:23.560]  Now they say you must wear a mask
[1:58:23.560 --> 1:58:25.560]  It's a sign of slavery
[1:58:25.560 --> 1:58:26.560]  It's a sign of submission
[1:58:26.560 --> 1:58:28.560]  I know you as listeners understand that
[1:58:28.560 --> 1:58:30.560]  We need sheriffs and county commissioners
[1:58:30.560 --> 1:58:31.560]  And city councils and others
[1:58:31.560 --> 1:58:32.560]  To stand up and say
[1:58:32.560 --> 1:58:35.560]  We are sanctuary cities for reality
[1:58:35.560 --> 1:58:38.560]  And for state and local sovereignty
[1:58:38.560 --> 1:58:39.560]  Against the globalist
[1:58:39.560 --> 1:58:41.560]  This isn't the federal government taking over
[1:58:41.560 --> 1:58:43.560]  It's the U.N. through the federal government
[1:58:43.560 --> 1:58:46.560]  And we as American citizens must say no
[1:58:46.560 --> 1:58:48.560]  The people are awakening
[1:58:48.560 --> 1:58:50.560]  They're taking control of their own environment
[1:58:50.560 --> 1:58:52.560]  Cell phones are an amazing tool
[1:58:52.560 --> 1:58:55.560]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld
[1:58:55.560 --> 1:58:57.560]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers
[1:58:57.560 --> 1:58:59.560]  Governments, foreign governments
[1:58:59.560 --> 1:59:00.560]  The CHIComs especially
[1:59:00.560 --> 1:59:03.560]  Are using this to steal your data
[1:59:03.560 --> 1:59:04.560]  To share your data
[1:59:04.560 --> 1:59:06.560]  To be able to rig markets
[1:59:06.560 --> 1:59:07.560]  When they're able to scoop up
[1:59:07.560 --> 1:59:09.560]  Billions of people's data
[1:59:09.560 --> 1:59:11.560]  They can actually predict on record
[1:59:11.560 --> 1:59:13.560]  What's going to happen in mass movements
[1:59:13.560 --> 1:59:16.560]  Cutting them out of that data stream
[1:59:16.560 --> 1:59:20.560]  Absolutely devastates their AI takeover
[1:59:20.560 --> 1:59:21.560]  In their own words, they admit it
[1:59:21.560 --> 1:59:23.560]  So I've been selling privacy pouches
[1:59:23.560 --> 1:59:25.560]  And pocket pockets and things like that
[1:59:25.560 --> 1:59:26.560]  For more than a decade
[1:59:26.560 --> 1:59:28.560]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight
[1:59:28.560 --> 1:59:29.560]  They're faraday cages
[1:59:29.560 --> 1:59:31.560]  They just look like a cloth envelope
[1:59:31.560 --> 1:59:33.560]  They work absolutely great
[1:59:33.560 --> 1:59:34.560]  And it just gives you that security
[1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:36.560]  To have power over your data
[1:59:36.560 --> 1:59:38.560]  And power over your identity
[1:59:38.560 --> 1:59:39.560]  When you are traveling
[1:59:39.560 --> 1:59:40.560]  And don't want big brother to know
[1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:41.560]  What you're up to
[1:59:41.560 --> 1:59:42.560]  Because it's not their business
