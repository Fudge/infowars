[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:08.000 --> 00:32.000]  GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:32.000 --> 00:39.000]  Hello, my friends. Thank you for joining us. It is already the seventh day of April 2008.
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.000]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:44.000 --> 00:52.000]  Here on the GCN Radio Network, we have a very important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:52.000 --> 01:03.000]  Alan Watt is an amazing researcher. Cutting through The Matrix.com will be joining us in the third hour today.
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  In the meantime, I do want to properly remember Charlton Heston.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  I'm also going to re-air an interview that I did with Charlton Heston.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.000]  I looked for this this weekend. I found out he, of course, had died Friday night.
[01:19.000 --> 01:26.000]  I got in the car at midnight, leaving work, and turned on the radio.
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  And they were announcing that Charlton Heston had died.
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.000]  And I went home and searched for about two hours on the web and found the links on info wars from seven years ago.
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  But the MP3 links were dead. We'd moved servers, hadn't migrated it properly, whatever.
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  Spent two hours looking for it on other sites, couldn't find it.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  Came into the office, tore the place apart, and was able to find it.
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.000]  In fact, we'd printed up about 400 CDs seven years ago.
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  And I'd put them up on the side as part of a second amendment package that we don't sell very many of.
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.000]  And guess what we were down to? We were down to the last two copies.
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  And about one of them, I guess, goes a week.
[02:11.000 --> 02:18.000]  So what about timing? I was going to have to go on air and beg listeners to mail the CD back.
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  But we're going to have to burn some more of those and keep that part of the package.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  But that is coming up today in the second hour.
[02:24.000 --> 02:32.000]  I've got throughout the week, I'm going to play clips of him doing Shakespeare, his speeches to the NRA.
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  I mean, he really was a gentleman. He was an amazing actor.
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  They said on the London stage that he was one of the best and not the best Shakespearean actor.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  And that's tough stuff. You get an idea for the language those people use and how intelligent they were.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  The founding fathers were of the same ilk, kind of at the tail end of that.
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  And they weren't showing off in the prose they used.
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  It was just they were truly alive in the spirit of the Renaissance.
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  I want to play that too.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Also, Charlton Heston presenting the Bible, just to get an idea of his voice.
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.000]  He was doing this live in these live reads he would do from Jerusalem when he voiced what the 10 part series, the Bible.
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  I'm going to play some of those clips this week.
[03:15.000 --> 03:24.000]  I played about five minutes of my interview with him yesterday on the Sunday show and we posted the transcript back up on infowars.com.
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  There were like 50 something comments in there this morning.
[03:27.000 --> 03:34.000]  And some of them were saying how dare Alex Jones say Charlton Heston's good and how dare him listen to him defending John Ashcroft.
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  That interview was done on the 18th of January 2001.
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.000]  Nine months, like eight, eight months and 20 something days before 9 11.
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  John Ashcroft was saying he was going to be pro second amendment.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  He had been saying he was going to go after the Clintons.
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  He had blocked the Clintons on warrantless wiretapping. Ron Paul has read his quotes before.
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  It's in matrix of evil where John Ashcroft sounded like us.
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  He was a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  So this is a seven year old interview and it shows how we are fair here.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  We were giving Bush the benefit of the doubt in the seven year old interview.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  So that is coming up today.
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.000]  It's okay audio quality, but this is not on the web. This is nowhere.
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  We're going to air the whole 20 minutes here coming up in the second hour.
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  In the meantime, web could collapse as video demand soar.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  Superfast internet may replace worldwide web.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  They're now introducing internet to the shutdown of the web to the general slaves.
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  War crime charges for Bush being discussed on national television in the U.S.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  AP reports that the public schools are making little boys dressed as girls.
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  We'll be right back ladies and gentlemen. It's a jam packed transmission.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  Thousands of years their dark order grew.
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[05:15.000 --> 05:22.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.

[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement. You have been warned.
[05:53.000 --> 05:57.000]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[05:57.000 --> 06:00.000]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.000]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[06:02.000 --> 06:05.000]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate
[06:05.000 --> 06:07.000]  and others are absorbed into the skin.
[06:07.000 --> 06:11.000]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water
[06:11.000 --> 06:15.000]  and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron.
[06:15.000 --> 06:19.000]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.000]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  or one year whichever comes first.
[06:25.000 --> 06:31.000]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[06:31.000 --> 06:32.000]  What about you?
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.000]  Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[07:49.000 --> 08:14.000]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[08:26.000 --> 08:44.000]  This is dedicated to Charlton Heston.
[08:44.000 --> 09:09.000]  She's 84 years old.
[09:09.000 --> 09:21.000]  Saturday night I heard the news and went home.
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  Dug up the interview. We're going to be airing in the second hour today.
[09:27.000 --> 09:47.000]  Let's let it roll out for Chuck.
[09:57.000 --> 10:26.000]  We're going to be airing in the second hour today.
[10:26.000 --> 10:52.000]  We're going to be airing in the second hour today.
[10:52.000 --> 11:19.000]  We're going to be airing in the second hour today.
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  Every living generation knows who Charlton Heston is.
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.000]  World War II veteran, big actor since the late 1940s.
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  Silent Green, Planet of the Yaps.
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  The Ten Commandments, Ben Herb.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  NRA president.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  The list goes on and on.
[11:40.000 --> 11:52.000]  And the fact was he really was a nice person who spent every major holiday, wherever he was out feeding the homeless, not making a big deal out of it, not making it a PR stunt, not alerting the media.
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  He was somebody that gave large portions of his fortune to good charities.
[11:57.000 --> 12:05.000]  He was somebody who really did fight for the civil rights movement in the early 1960s before it was something popular to do.
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  And when he got boycotted for doing it, he was somebody that stood up for the Second Amendment.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  Now, has Chuck Heston been perfect?
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  Is the NRA perfect?
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  No, they've certainly been infiltrated from the start.
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.000]  They certainly have pushed gun control measures, quote the name of being reasonable.
[12:22.000 --> 12:33.000]  But I believe from all the evidence, Charlton Heston meant everything he was doing and truly did help build up the Second Amendment culture and reawaken it in this nation.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  There's no doubt that he's been very, very good for the Second Amendment.
[12:36.000 --> 12:42.000]  And then you watch the video in Bowling for Columbine of Michael Moore trying to set him up.
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  I don't know if we're going to play that today, but all this week we're going to play multiple clips daily, remembering Charlton Heston throughout the week.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  I'm going to do it right through to Friday.
[12:51.000 --> 12:59.000]  I'm going to spend more time on it today, and then I'll only spend 10, 15 minutes each show throughout the rest of the week looking at this versatile individual.
[12:59.000 --> 13:11.000]  But when an icon dies, it reminds us of how short life is, how transient it is, how precious it is, and how blessed we are to be conscious and that God gave us consciousness,
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.000]  and that we are alive living on this plane of existence here in the Third Dimension.
[13:18.000 --> 13:26.000]  It is unspeakably magical, unspeakably wonderful.
[13:26.000 --> 13:38.000]  The life we live, being children, learning the discovery, growing up being young men and women, discovering love and passion, and the adversities.
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  When I was young, I remember adversities.
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.000]  I mean, nothing particularly bad, but fistfights and bullies beating me up and things, and I look back on them.
[13:46.000 --> 13:55.000]  Those are things that added character to me, and the tough jobs I had, and the mean bosses I had, and all the things I've gone through only made me stronger.
[13:55.000 --> 14:03.000]  And have only added to the bouquet this arrangement that is my personal life and my personal journey.
[14:03.000 --> 14:11.000]  And then as I live on through the species, through my children and through other people's children and through humanity.
[14:11.000 --> 14:22.000]  That's why it hurts my feelings to see things like the Lurikonkistas, and Absolute Vodka, the Swedish vodka company, the dominant vodka company in the world,
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  the older, the number one vodka company, the biggest sellers.
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.000]  They did their market research.
[14:27.000 --> 14:36.000]  They told the LA Times that, and so they ran newspaper, magazine ads all over Mexico, saying the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  I have to respond to that.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  I have to fight back against that.
[14:39.000 --> 14:51.000]  I have to talk about how they're a group of people that have been brainwashed and who have been taught and who have been told that this country belongs to them, and they're here.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  And it hurts me because I love them.
[14:54.000 --> 15:17.000]  How could you look at a black child, a Hispanic child, a white child, an Asian child, an Inuit child, an Aborigine in some place like Australia, and not want that child to grow up straight and strong and have opportunities?
[15:17.000 --> 15:25.000]  It's only when you look at the adults and you think, does that black person hate me because I'm white, or does this Mexican hate me because I'm white?
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  And they're thinking the same thing.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  Does this white guy hate me because I'm black?
[15:29.000 --> 15:38.000]  And so even if you want to be up above it all, you still get sucked into it.
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.000]  And the establishment, the globalists know that, and they play us off against each other.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  And that's what's happening.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  We have to remember who the real enemy is.
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  It's the New World Order.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  It's the big private banks.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  They're the ones orchestrating all this.
[15:52.000 --> 16:01.000]  They're the ones poisoning our water, setting up Planned Parenthood to euthanize and sterilize and kill our babies.
[16:01.000 --> 16:02.000]  They're the enemy.
[16:02.000 --> 16:05.000]  And whatever they're doing is then our enemy.
[16:05.000 --> 16:16.000]  So the globalists are supporting open borders and LaRica Conquista, and they've been paying for 50 years for the textbooks and comic books in Mexico, saying the U.S. belongs to Mexico.
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.000]  Our universities and public schools have been pushing it.
[16:19.000 --> 16:26.000]  And so right there, you know that it is the enemy of liberty and freedom.
[16:26.000 --> 16:35.000]  The man, the scientific masterminds, the overlords, the architects are for this breaking down the borders.
[16:35.000 --> 16:40.000]  They are for the LaRica Conquista, because it's not going to empower your people, your Chicano nation.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  It is not going to give you any future.
[16:42.000 --> 16:50.000]  It is going to make you peons just like you are in Mexico, and everybody else is going to be peons, too.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  It's real simple.
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  I don't have to sit here and think about where my allegiance is lie.
[16:55.000 --> 17:00.000]  I don't have to sit here and think about will this offend this group, will it anger that group?
[17:00.000 --> 17:03.000]  This show, this broadcast is real easy.
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  I do what my heart says is right.
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.000]  I go with what the evidence shows, and I always defend the Republic.
[17:09.000 --> 17:15.000]  I always defend this country, and the Bill of Rights and Constitution, because they're beautiful documents.
[17:15.000 --> 17:23.000]  And so if something is against that, whether it's the modern NRA, or whether it's Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, or John McCain,
[17:23.000 --> 17:35.000]  the SPP, George Bush, Mecha, LaRaza, the Ku Klux Klan, if it's against my Republic, I am against it.
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  Duty is mine, consequence belongs to God.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  I don't worry about it.
[17:39.000 --> 17:45.000]  I don't spend my time thinking, is this offensive?
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  I try to come to you from the heart.
[17:49.000 --> 17:58.000]  I intellectually analyze the facts, come to my decision, my analysis, but it all is from the heart.
[17:58.000 --> 18:03.000]  If you're Hispanic out there, I know people have done racist things to you.
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  I know you've been called names before.
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  I have to.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  We have to be bigger than that.
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  Believe me, I fly off the handle all the time.
[18:11.000 --> 18:12.000]  I mean, I'm sick of it.
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  I understand how you feel, and it's good to go get into race.
[18:15.000 --> 18:16.000]  It's good.
[18:16.000 --> 18:17.000]  It feels good.
[18:17.000 --> 18:24.000]  It's good to go ahead and serve that tribalism, and to go ahead and just hate all the gringos.
[18:24.000 --> 18:31.000]  But you need to understand that your leaders, why do you think the University of Texas and other universities pay
[18:31.000 --> 18:37.000]  to have the head of Chicano studies say the plan of San Diego needs to be implemented against whites?
[18:37.000 --> 18:43.000]  Juan Gutierrez, I played that yesterday on the Sunday show where he said, implement the plan of San Diego on whites.
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  Kill all whites, 16 and older.
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  Is Mr. Gutierrez telling you don't drink fluoride water?
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  Is Mr. Gutierrez telling you don't take the vaccines?
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.000]  Is Mr. Gutierrez telling you don't send your women into these abortuaries?
[18:59.000 --> 19:00.000]  No.
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.000]  In fact, he's a big liberal.
[19:01.000 --> 19:02.000]  He's for abortion.
[19:02.000 --> 19:06.000]  I've looked into it.
[19:06.000 --> 19:12.000]  So he's not protecting your Raza, or the man wouldn't be bankrolling him.
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.000]  Have you seen who funds Raza and these other groups, Lulac?
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  Every Fortune 500 you can imagine.
[19:19.000 --> 19:28.000]  The list is hundreds and hundreds of Fortune 500 companies, almost every one of them is up there.
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  Now, why did I defend Barack Obama's preacher?
[19:31.000 --> 19:36.000]  Because he talks about it and says, don't take the vaccines, they're giving you AIDS.
[19:36.000 --> 19:45.000]  That guy may be a little down on Whitey, but at least he's actually warned his people about something real, so I have to respect it.
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  And it is Whitey that did that to him.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  But not the Whitey's I'm with.

[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[21:12.000 --> 21:22.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[31:58.000 --> 32:07.000]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling, because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than have heated.

[33:16.000 --> 33:21.000]  We're going to break down the police state, the brainwashing of our children.
[33:21.000 --> 33:27.000]  The U.S. news is starting to demonize having more than one child.
[33:27.000 --> 33:32.000]  The push is on there.
[33:32.000 --> 33:38.000]  We're accelerating towards the big announcement in about 30 minutes early in the next hour.
[33:38.000 --> 33:45.000]  And yeah, call everybody you know, big announcement coming up next hour.
[33:45.000 --> 33:51.000]  And we got the Charlton Heston interview that I did with him seven years ago.
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  But before we do that, here's another little three-minute clip.
[33:54.000 --> 34:01.000]  This is Charlton Heston on climate change on how ridiculous it is to say that carbon dioxide is going to kill the earth.
[34:01.000 --> 34:07.000]  He recorded this about four years ago right before he retired.
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  Let's go ahead and roll it.
[34:09.000 --> 34:14.000]  You think man can destroy the planet? What intoxicating vanity.
[34:14.000 --> 34:18.000]  Let me tell you about our planet. Earth is four and a half billion years old.
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.000]  There's been life on it for nearly that long, 3.8 billion years.
[34:23.000 --> 34:31.000]  Pateria first, later the first melted cellular life, then the first complex creatures in the sea on the land,
[34:31.000 --> 34:37.000]  then finally the great sweeping ages of animals, the amphibians, the dinosaurs,
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.000]  at last the mammals, each one enduring millions and millions of years.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  Great dynasties of creatures rising, flourishing, dying away.
[34:46.000 --> 34:51.000]  All this against the background of continuous and violent upheaval.
[34:51.000 --> 34:59.000]  Mountain ranges thrust up, eroded away, cometary impacts, volcanic eruptions, oceans rising and falling.
[34:59.000 --> 35:03.000]  Whole continents moving in endless, constant, violent change,
[35:03.000 --> 35:08.000]  colliding, buckling to make mountains over millions of years.
[35:08.000 --> 35:14.000]  Earth has survived everything in its time. It will certainly survive us.
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  If all the nuclear weapons in the world went off at once in all the plants,
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.000]  all the animals died and the earth was clicking hot for a hundred thousand years,
[35:24.000 --> 35:31.000]  life would survive somewhere under the soil frozen in arctic ice.
[35:31.000 --> 35:37.000]  Sooner or later when the planet was no longer inhospitable, life would spread again.
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  The evolutionary process would begin again.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  It might take two billion years for life to regain its present variety.
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  Of course it would be very different from what it is now,
[35:46.000 --> 35:52.000]  but the earth would survive our folly, only we would not.
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  If the ozone layer gets thinner, ultraviolet radiation sears the earth.
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  So what? Ultraviolet radiation is good for life.
[36:00.000 --> 36:04.000]  It's powerful energy. It promotes mutation, change.
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  Many forms of life will thrive with more UV radiation.
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  Many others will die out.
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  You think this is the first time that's happened?
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  Think about oxygen.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  Necessary for life now.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  But oxygen is actually a metabolic poison, a corrosive gas, like fluorine.
[36:21.000 --> 36:26.000]  When oxygen was first produced as a waste product by certain plant cells
[36:26.000 --> 36:32.000]  some three billion years ago, it created a crisis for all other life on earth.
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  Those plants were polluting the environment, exhaling a lethal gas,
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  or it eventually had an atmosphere incompatible with life.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  Nevertheless, life on earth took care of itself.
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.000]  In the thinking of a human being a hundred years is a long time.
[36:48.000 --> 36:53.000]  A hundred years ago we did nip cars, airplanes, computers, or vaccines.
[36:53.000 --> 36:59.000]  It was a whole different world, but to the earth a hundred years is nothing.
[36:59.000 --> 37:04.000]  This planet lives and breathes on a much faster scale.
[37:04.000 --> 37:11.000]  We can't imagine its slow and powerful rhythms, and we haven't got the humility to try.
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  We've been residents here for the blink of an eye.
[37:14.000 --> 37:21.000]  If we're gone tomorrow, the earth will not miss us.
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  And you can debate how old the earth is.
[37:24.000 --> 37:29.000]  Regardless, life is incredibly resilient.
[37:29.000 --> 37:35.000]  The United Nations, the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg group are publicly saying carbon dioxide is a toxic waste.
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.000]  They're registering it as a poison.
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  Carbon dioxide is the original life gas.
[37:42.000 --> 37:47.000]  As I've told you many times, oxygen came later.
[37:47.000 --> 37:56.000]  The basic building block is solar radiation, H2O, and carbon dioxide.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  You can have life with that.
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  Oxygen is secondary.
[38:02.000 --> 38:08.000]  But for mammals it's part of those four ingredients.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  Plants need three, we need four.
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  Plants put off more oxygen.
[38:13.000 --> 38:19.000]  And during the cycles when this earth has been as much as 20 degrees hotter,
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  that's when you had giant tropical belts.
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  And this planet didn't even have ice caps.
[38:25.000 --> 38:28.000]  I mean, it's gone through all sorts of changes.
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  The earth is oxygen and carbon dioxide starved right now.
[38:31.000 --> 38:38.000]  Just 200,000 years ago, the ice core show 10 times higher carbon dioxide.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  10 times.
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  It's been registered in 400,000 year old ice to be 14 times.
[38:45.000 --> 38:53.000]  Now that's the highest they know, that's as far back as they can test.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  Just amazing.
[38:55.000 --> 39:02.000]  Same Club of Rome, so we're going into an ice age in 1965 and we had to have global taxes to stop it.
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  Now we've had one of the coldest winters on record globally.
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  The earth has been cooling since 1998.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  NASA now has to admit that.
[39:10.000 --> 39:16.000]  There's a big story up on PresidentPlanet.com where the BBC was basically ordered by the government to lie
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  and not report on the government's own findings.
[39:19.000 --> 39:26.000]  They had the different viral lobbyists, even lobbying them.
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  The earth does have problems though.
[39:29.000 --> 39:35.000]  Genetic engineering can hurt us and hurt other animals and biological diversity.
[39:35.000 --> 39:43.000]  It can hurt the interlocking biospheres in the atmosphere, on the ground, below ground, water tables.
[39:43.000 --> 39:50.000]  We have the different weapons systems that have been developed, things that are being worked on,
[39:50.000 --> 39:58.000]  fish infusion, cyclotrons, antimatter systems, all developed, all admitted.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  And those are real threats.
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.000]  We disagree with Heston that mankind can, for all intents and purposes, really tear stuff up.
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  And so what have asteroids and comets have done it before?
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  You know what, I want to keep on living.
[40:13.000 --> 40:20.000]  I want the humanity to get off the planet and I do not want to wreck the earth and we are wrecking it.
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.000]  It will come back, granted, but not in our time unless we reverse it.
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  But the globalists, they're the ones wrecking it.
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.000]  They don't understand the Royal Institute on Population, the Royal Commission on Population,
[40:32.000 --> 40:38.000]  said they were going to block the third world from industrializing and that they would use the people bomb to hold them back.
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  The eugenicists just want an excuse to kill people.
[40:41.000 --> 40:46.000]  Then they go in and soft kill the Latin Americans and blacks and Asians.
[40:46.000 --> 40:51.000]  Then they go in and poison them and after they've been born, it's totally sick.
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.000]  And they come back and say, well, there's too many people, you're not for it.
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  They're the ones that went in and made sure that they didn't industrialize.
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  It's just unbelievable.
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  It is absolutely unbelievable.
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.000]  We need all of the hippies out there and the yippies and the trendies and the rest of you.
[41:10.000 --> 41:16.000]  I don't care what you look like if you got a purple mohawk or nose rings or you're wearing a three-piece suit.
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  It doesn't matter to me. I don't look at that.
[41:18.000 --> 41:25.000]  But I look at it in that it is a uniform. It's an outfit. You're telling me what group you're part of.
[41:25.000 --> 41:32.000]  And predominantly, people that dress in those outfits, people that predominantly that go to RNC meetings
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  wearing cowboy hats and George W ties are idiots.
[41:36.000 --> 41:42.000]  Warmongering pencil-necked fools.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  I shouldn't say pencil-necked. They have huge jowls like me.
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.000]  And predominantly, somebody with long hippie hair or dreadlocks walking around in sandals,
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.000]  if you start talking to them, they'll say, yeah, we need to kill the middle class and socialism and communism's good
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  and we need to have one-child policies.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  I mean, they're like cult members, man. They're dangerous.
[42:01.000 --> 42:09.000]  And I'm just telling you, you have been programmed with false information.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  You know what? Let's play Charlton Heston Hamlet.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  There's so much of this. I'm going to play this and then an NRA clip and that's going to be it for the day.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  Well, in our interview with him.
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  I've got a lot of other news here and I'm going to go overall of it.
[42:20.000 --> 42:29.000]  I'm not going to take any calls until the third hour today when Alan Watt is on with us.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  Because I've got a lot of stuff I want to cover and I want to spend some time talking about Charlton Heston.
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  Big announcement coming up next hour and I'm going to re-air.
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  It hadn't been heard in seven years. It's not on the web. It is nowhere.
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  You'll hear it here first out of the archive seven years coming up in the second hour.
[42:43.000 --> 42:51.000]  In my interview with Charlton Heston from The Grave.
[42:51.000 --> 42:58.000]  So proceed, you please.
[42:58.000 --> 43:04.000]  Oh God, my Lord, well spoken. With good accent and good discretion.
[43:04.000 --> 43:10.000]  And on he finds him, striking too short at Greeks.
[43:10.000 --> 43:18.000]  His antique sword, rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, repugnant to command.
[43:18.000 --> 43:25.000]  Unequal mattress at prime drives. He wages, that's why, but with the wicked wind of his fell sword,
[43:25.000 --> 43:34.000]  a nervous father falls in senseless illium, seeming to feel his blow with flaming top, stoops to his base,
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.000]  and with a hideous crash takes prisoner, Pyrrhus Ear.
[43:38.000 --> 43:44.000]  Below his sword, which was declining on the milky head of Reverend Priam, seemed in the air to stick.
[43:44.000 --> 43:52.000]  So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, and like a neutral to his will and matter did, nothing.
[43:52.000 --> 44:00.000]  But as we often see against some storm, a silence in the heavens, the rags stand still,
[44:00.000 --> 44:08.000]  the bold winds speechless, and the orb below has hushed as death.
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.000]  A nun, the dreadful thunder doth rend the region.
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.000]  So after Pyrrhus' pause, a rouset vengeance sets him new a work,
[44:17.000 --> 44:23.000]  and never did the Cyclops' hammers fall on Mars his armor forged for proof etern.
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword, now falls on Priam.
[44:29.000 --> 44:37.000]  Out, out thou strobid fortune, all you gods in general sin of a takeaway of power,
[44:37.000 --> 44:46.000]  break all the spokes and fellies from a wheel, and pull the round knave down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends.
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  This is too long.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  It shall to the barbers with your beard.
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  Prithee, say on.
[44:53.000 --> 44:59.000]  He's for a jig, or a tale of bordery, or he sleeps.
[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  Say on.
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  Come to heck, you bird.
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.000]  But who, oh, who had seen the moblet queen?
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  Moblet queen?
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.000]  That's good. Moblet queen is good.
[45:13.000 --> 45:19.000]  Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames with piss in room.
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.000]  A clout upon that headwell late the diadem stood.
[45:23.000 --> 45:32.000]  And for a robe about her, lank and all, or team of loins, a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up.
[45:32.000 --> 45:41.000]  Oh, this had seen, with tongue in venom steeped, against fortune's stateward treason have pronounced.
[45:41.000 --> 45:48.000]  But if the gods themselves did see her then, when she saw purists make malicious sport,
[45:48.000 --> 45:54.000]  in mincing with his sword her husband's limbs, the instant burst of clamor that she made,
[45:54.000 --> 46:05.000]  unless things mortal-moved them not at all, would have made Milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the glass.
[46:05.000 --> 46:12.000]  Look where he's not turned his color and has tears in his eyes, really no more.
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  Alright, that's a little bit of Shakespeare.
[46:15.000 --> 46:22.000]  You can go online and watch hour-long performances of Charlton Heston endlessly spewing Shakespeare.
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.000]  And by the way, the Founding Fathers, and then the opera classes in England at the time,
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.000]  actually were talking like that 300 years ago, 250 years ago.
[46:32.000 --> 46:40.000]  And now look at us, the public, the vocabulary, is pared down to almost nothing.
[46:40.000 --> 46:53.000]  This was discussed and bemoaned, grieved by Eric Blair, known as George Arnwell, in 1984.
[46:53.000 --> 47:02.000]  He talked about how they'd already reduced the language down to almost nothing by the late 40s.
[47:02.000 --> 47:12.000]  And now that nothingness is a mountain of complexity and selection compared to the meagre scraps
[47:12.000 --> 47:23.000]  that we attempt to convert to understandable language with our fellow man today.
[47:23.000 --> 47:33.000]  You go see a movie like Idiocracy, put out by local artists here in town, Mike Judge,
[47:33.000 --> 47:40.000]  and I don't even think it's a joke, where basically the public is unable to even really talk.
[47:40.000 --> 47:48.000]  I think that's the point we're coming to, we'll just text message each other in abbreviations.
[47:48.000 --> 47:53.000]  Abbreviations of an abbreviated language that was abbreviated each year,
[47:53.000 --> 48:01.000]  a new version downloaded into the minds of the population as they simply stand at their control panels,
[48:01.000 --> 48:07.000]  punching the pleasure button like a rat in a laboratory with wires hooked into its brain,
[48:07.000 --> 48:12.000]  punching a pleasure center 24 hours a day instead of even spending time to eat or sleep,
[48:12.000 --> 48:24.000]  and finally collapsing and dying with its hand jabbing at that pleasure center, that splinter in its own mind.
[48:24.000 --> 48:33.000]  In fact, lest I not have time, let's go ahead and start rolling with NRA Part 1.
[48:33.000 --> 48:38.000]  In parts to this, they're up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[48:38.000 --> 48:49.000]  This is a 1989 speech, Charlton Heston before the NRA.
[48:49.000 --> 48:55.000]  Or perhaps it's not loading in the computer, the NRA speech.
[48:55.000 --> 49:01.000]  So we will play that after the break then.
[49:01.000 --> 49:11.000]  The other news that I have in front of me, something I didn't get to last week,
[49:11.000 --> 49:17.000]  because we again have a blind spot here, it's that we already know their program, know their plans,
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.000]  read their memos, their documents, their court findings, their pleadings,
[49:21.000 --> 49:25.000]  but this is now a large national issue.
[49:25.000 --> 49:31.000]  A secret DOJ memo says Fourth Amendment has no application after 9-11. I want to cover that when we get back.
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.000]  And then state fusion centers and Pentagon run FBI programs by Americans.
[49:36.000 --> 49:45.000]  And then that dovetails with this report about war crime charges for Bush officials.
[49:45.000 --> 49:56.000]  This was discussed this weekend on the McLaughlin report and that's up on prisonplanet.com right now.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  So we'll be going to that after the break.
[49:59.000 --> 50:06.000]  Then I'm going to get into this and this ties into population reduction programs.
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  Normally when I see these type of stories, we just don't cover it because they're so painful to go into,
[50:10.000 --> 50:15.000]  but Kids Dress Update draws Christian ire.
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  Oh, see it's those backwards Christians only there against this.
[50:18.000 --> 50:24.000]  AP, an elementary school event in which kids were encouraged to dress as members of the opposite sex.
[50:24.000 --> 50:32.000]  Gender drew the ire of the Christian radio group whose angst and angry broadcast prompted outrage calls to the district office.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  What is this really about? We'll cover that too.
[50:35.000 --> 50:41.000]  Then we'll get into the Charlton Heston clips from the NRA and a lot more.
[50:41.000 --> 50:47.000]  On the other side, Alan Watt joins us in the third hour and I have a big announcement coming up at the eight after.
[50:47.000 --> 51:13.000]  That's in about 13, 14 minutes. We'll be right back.
[51:17.000 --> 51:24.000]  Whether you're looking for survival and wellness products like Berkey water filters or you would like a book on the history of the Federal Reserve,
[51:24.000 --> 51:29.000]  we've got the most well researched and documented titles all available at prisonplanet.com.
[51:29.000 --> 51:35.000]  Or if you'd like, you can give the info or store a call at 888-253-3139.
[51:35.000 --> 51:41.000]  Or you can view more than a thousand titles in super high quality right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[51:41.000 --> 51:51.000]  And the information you need to effectively wake up your fellow man and fight the New World Order is available right now at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.tv.
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  Join the info war today.
[51:53.000 --> 52:00.000]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[52:00.000 --> 52:05.000]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical,
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.000]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[52:08.000 --> 52:14.000]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt,
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[52:16.000 --> 52:21.000]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[52:21.000 --> 52:26.000]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.000]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[52:32.000 --> 52:36.000]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[52:36.000 --> 52:41.000]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[52:41.000 --> 52:44.000]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[52:44.000 --> 52:52.000]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.000]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[52:55.000 --> 52:58.000]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[52:58.000 --> 53:03.000]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[53:06.000 --> 53:11.000]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run,
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  yet they don't want you to know about them.
[53:13.000 --> 53:19.000]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[53:21.000 --> 53:25.000]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[53:25.000 --> 53:30.000]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong
[53:30.000 --> 53:37.000]  that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[53:37.000 --> 53:42.000]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[53:42.000 --> 53:45.000]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[53:45.000 --> 54:08.000]  Call 888-USE-SFR-1. That's 888-USE-SFR-1 today.
[54:08.000 --> 54:18.000]  I've got to run to keep road ahead, and I'm bound to keep on red.
[54:18.000 --> 54:26.000]  I've got one more silver dollar, but I'm not going to let them catch me though.
[54:26.000 --> 54:38.000]  I've got to let them catch the midnight gather.
[54:38.000 --> 54:48.000]  I don't own the clothes I'm wearing, and the road goes on forever.
[54:48.000 --> 54:57.000]  I've got one more silver dollar, but I'm not going to let them catch me though.
[54:57.000 --> 55:03.000]  I've got to let them catch the midnight gather.
[55:03.000 --> 55:10.000]  All right, we're back live.
[55:10.000 --> 55:16.000]  Big announcement coming up next hour. Alan Watt in the third hour.
[55:16.000 --> 55:24.000]  I'm going to play the entire interview that I did with Charlton Heston, January 18, 2001.
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  I've got a lot of other news we're going to be going over as well.
[55:27.000 --> 55:35.000]  I'll play part of one of those NRA speeches. I'm going to play all of it. It's about 25 minutes long throughout the week.
[55:35.000 --> 55:43.000]  But first off, this is the McLaughlin Group this weekend, and this is openly being discussed all over the world now.
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  Go ahead and roll it.
[55:45.000 --> 55:49.000]  It's a press conference telling superdelegates to decide.
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  Great. Andrew.
[55:51.000 --> 55:58.000]  The latest revelations on the torture front show the memo from John Yu, as well as revelations in Philippe Sands' new book,
[55:58.000 --> 56:04.000]  means that Don Romsfeld, David Addington, John Yu should not leave the United States any time soon.
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.000]  They will be, at some point, indicted for war crimes.
[56:07.000 --> 56:11.000]  Okay, really. I'll be right back with this week.
[56:11.000 --> 56:17.000]  Here's Chris Matthews filling in on McLaughlin Group, Arizona PBS nationwide.
[56:17.000 --> 56:24.000]  Now, you're thinking John Yu memo knew. We heard about this four years ago on this show.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  They don't dare read the memo about how they torture children sexually.
[56:29.000 --> 56:35.000]  By the way, sometimes when I mention that, I get emails. You think we just say that? Go look it up. It's mainstream news.
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  Yes, for people that support this administration.
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.000]  You support people that put out child molestation memos, okay?
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.000]  I mean, it's scary. These people are scary.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  They're dangerous.
[56:49.000 --> 56:55.000]  I'm only fighting them because there isn't a choice. If we don't fight back against them, they're going to win and take over.
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.000]  And by the way, they intend to put Hillary or Obama or somebody else in. It doesn't matter. All three of them are evil.
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.000]  They're going to continue this agenda. They're going to continue all these policies.
[57:03.000 --> 57:09.000]  Now, there is a new memo out directly from the White House admitting that the White House did order it.
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  And did say and did order the Justice Department and told the generals, we don't care about Fourth Amendment with spying.
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  We don't care about laws on torture. Do it.
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  But we already have the other John Yu memos where they said that the president's God, what he says goes.
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  They said the president is the law. The president cannot break the law.
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  And that's not true, folks. The president is not God.
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  I use the analogy when they first heard saying this five years ago.
[57:34.000 --> 57:39.000]  Can the president barbecue small children in the White House lawn? No.
[57:39.000 --> 57:43.000]  So can they torture children in front of their parents with pliers?
[57:43.000 --> 57:54.000]  And the answer is no. Well, I remember in horror in October of 2001,
[57:54.000 --> 58:03.000]  it said the CIA section chief in the Washington Post in Middle East said that they take people's families to facilities and torture them.
[58:03.000 --> 58:08.000]  I mean, they admitted it then. See, they thought they could sell you on it then.
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  And so that's in Road to Tyranny.
[58:10.000 --> 58:14.000]  Road to Tyranny that came out in February of 2002.
[58:14.000 --> 58:20.000]  The first major 9-11 film has that in it.
[58:20.000 --> 58:26.000]  See, we talked about it here first. I'm not tooting our horn. The point is this has all been public for a long time.
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.000]  All right, we're only about eight minutes away from the big announcement.
[58:29.000 --> 58:32.000]  Stay tuned for second hour of transmission.
[58:32.000 --> 58:38.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:38.000 --> 58:44.000]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:44.000 --> 58:50.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[58:50.000 --> 58:54.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:54.000 --> 58:59.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[58:59.000 --> 59:02.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:02.000 --> 59:10.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:10.000 --> 59:18.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:25.000 --> 59:29.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[59:29.000 --> 59:41.000]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[59:41.000 --> 59:59.000]  You have been warned.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  Okay, we've got my big announcement coming up in the next segment.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  I've been telling you about the last seven days.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  I'm going to re-air the entire Charlton Heston interview this hour.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  It's about 20 minutes long.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  But I did seven years ago.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  Seven years and three months ago.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  And we've got Alan Watt joining us in the third hour today.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  I'm going to get into the economic news and a lot more.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  Now, this is going on nationwide.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  I don't think this is just an isolated event.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  Kids Dress Up Day draws Christian ire.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  Now, couldn't the AP just do an article about schools have the boys dress up like girls
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  and the girls like boys to teach them about sexuality?
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  No. They have to make it about, oh, the Christians, those backwards people.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  An elementary school event in which kids were encouraged to dress up as members.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  The opposite sex grew the ire of a Christian radio group
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  whose angry broadcast prompted outrage calls to the district office.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  Students at Pineville Elementary in Reedsburg had been dressing in costumes
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  all last week as part of an annual school tradition called Wacky Week.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  On Friday, students were encouraged to dress either as senior citizens or as members of the opposite sex.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  And that's out of Wisconsin.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  Students at Pineville Elementary.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  A local resident informed the voice of Christian youth America on Friday,
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  the Milwaukee-based radio network, responded by interrupting its morning programming
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  for special broadcasts that aired in nine radio stations throughout Wisconsin.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  The broadcast criticized the Dress Up Day as accusing the district of prompting alternative lifestyles.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  Then they basically go on and admit the school.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  Okay, look, they teach third graders in California statewide
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  and in certain districts all over the country.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  They teach third graders who were thinking about Superman
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  and thinking about, you know, transformers and thinking about football and baseball.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  They teach them about transgender and men becoming women and women becoming men.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  And, you know, there's this woman that they call a man
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  and they say a man's having a baby and how can a man have a baby?
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  It isn't a man. It is a woman who says they're a man.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  And I'm not even attacking this poor mixed up person.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  The point is, is that this is what decadent societies falling apart always do.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  The third world starving, the environment falling apart for real,
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  global taxes being set up on fake issues,
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  and billions of dollars are spent to, quote, teach the children how to be diverse
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  so no one's feelings are hurt.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  No one at the school in third grade is dressing up like a girl.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  No one is thinking about sex.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  Children aren't supposed to be thinking about it in the third grade.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  And they have all the studies.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  When they started sex education, death education, promiscuity goes up.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  When they had the DARE program.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  I was talking to Trey Kincaid, the producer of the show.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  He remembers four or five years before he even saw marijuana and stuff.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  When he was in elementary, the cops came in and showed him all the drugs and how to use them.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  And then that made kids use drugs. It's like advertising it.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  Why has suicide exploded? Well, they've seen it in the first pilot schools that did it in 1991-92.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  Columbine was one of the first, Littleton.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  Massive increases in teenage suicide.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  And of young children, they'd never seen it in 10 and 11 and 12 year olds.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  They saw a few in teenagers, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  Never before been seen in 10 and 11 and 12, 13 year olds.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  And suddenly it was an epidemic because you go in and you teach them about,
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  oh, and the little girl hung herself and she died.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  And this is how she did it with a little rope or shoelaces.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  And then the little girls go and do it.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  It's made real poignant, like Shakespearean, Romeo and Juliet.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  And oh, when the little girl gets depressed now, they go commit suicide.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  Or a little boy, he goes and mass shoots everyone.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  And they, in the early 1990s and mid-1990s, had the book, the basketball diaries.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  And it was taught as part of federal curriculum at the schools about mass shootings.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  And then suddenly mass shootings, the feds literally in thousands of school districts,
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  taught mass shooting.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  And then kids, when they get hopped up on drugs and unhappy and depressed,
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  and then they think, what do I do?
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  What do you do when you're depressed and upset?
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  You dress up in black, it's romantic.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  You come in and you shoot everybody.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  You put black eyeliner on, you spike your hair, you put on a black trench coat and you go kill people.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  And then they come in after our guns.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  And the psychologists, the Pentagon psychiatrists, knew when they designed this what it would do.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  Hemp, the super food for you and your family.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  Hemp, used for food, clothing and shelter since time began.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government,
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  The protein powder, seeds and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments,
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids and nutrients not available in other plants.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  Could this be the government's best kept secret?

[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  Quite some time, I've been sitting it out. Didn't take no chances, was a prisoner of doubt.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  Knocked out the waiting wall, ain't no recede. Got the feeling fortune, deal me in.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  Coming straight on for you, you made my mind. Now I'm just going, now I'm coming through.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  Straight on, straight on for you.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  Yeah, we're here Monday through Friday, from 11am until 2pm central.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  Standard time.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  Got Alan Wah coming up next hour.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  Okay, you want the big announcement?
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  I'll take my chances on you.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  I'll tell you the big announcement.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  Again, again, coming straight on for you.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  The big announcement is that since 1998, this has been a three hour radio show from 11am to 2pm central.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  It's now going to be four hours, 11am to 3pm central standard time.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  This is a big deal to take on a fourth hour radio, but that's not all.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  That's only a small part of the announcement.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  We're going to do this like a TV program.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  The fourth hour is going to be on the web at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  For all members, you'll be able to see the TV program, and then of course we'll still have the audio for the general audience.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  And it's going to be in 32 bed, and then we're going to upgrade it even higher.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  And the audio with the video is what, 64?
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  And we've got a document cam in here.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  We've got a video mixer and feed in here.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  We've got audio feeds in here.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  We're going to have a guest cam in here.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  When we're done, we're going to have three cameras in here.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  We've got two in here right now.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  And I will tell you that down the road, I'm going to go ahead and start an online TV network.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  Might as well just go ahead and let that out now too.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  Because I welcome everybody else to try it.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  I hope you succeed.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  But I got to get bigger offices, and that's a big gear up.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  Going into a massive recession, it's quite a gamble.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  But that's what we're doing here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  We're up in our game.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  You know, I started about a year ago, a Sunday radio show.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Sacrificed my Sunday afternoons, and I get ready for about two hours before.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  And then of course I drive in and do that.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  So all total, it's about a six hour commitment.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  And I'm committing to five hours more a week doing this show.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  Now for the first few weeks, I'm going to do it two or three days a week.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  But always will have something special.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  Like this week, I'm going to go four days live.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  But on Thursday, we've got three video edits of special interviews,
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  some exclusive video as well from our JFK film.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  Members of PrisonPlanet.tv are going to get that first over the stream.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  And so days when I'm not here live, you're going to have audio radio show with video TV program.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  And so we're going to have that for you as well.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  Now, you're going to be able in the fourth hour today, and by the way,
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  Alan Watts is going to be with us today.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  We're going four hours today and four hours tomorrow.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  Alan Watts is going to be with us on our maiden voyage, honored to have him,
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  an expert on the New World Order, really excellent information.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  He'll be joining us, getting into more of their systems of control,
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  their predictive programming.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  I want to give him a lot of time today.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  He'll do this about an hour and 50 minutes, most of the third hour,
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  and then all of the fourth hour.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  It is 15 cents a day to see the video.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, the cost of two and a half cups or less of Starbucks coffee.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  Get a yearly membership and get three months free at PrisonPlanet.tv,
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  or you can hear all the audio for free, of course, at infowars.com.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  Now, the big question is this.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  Is this show going to be on Genesis?
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  And the answer is yes.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  But I'm not going to do that right away.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  There's going to be no commercials at first, and there'll probably be less commercials in this fourth hour.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  It's tailored for television.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  It's really what it is.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  I'm doing an hour of TV, and the feed is going to be on the radio,
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  and I do want Genesis to carry it.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  They want to carry it, but I'm doing this at first on my own,
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  and I also don't want to push around other people.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  Right now, today, I could be on Genesis, but I'm saying hold off on that.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  I'm just going to do this on my own for a while,
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  and then very soon you will hear it on Genesis and the Star Guide and the rest of it.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  They have to get me another Star Guide feed and things like that.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  I was basically offered it, and I'm just saying no.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  Get another feed for reasons that are obvious.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  So that is the big announcement, and it is a big deal.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  I've got a document cam, so I can show you books, documents, news articles,
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  a camera on me, a camera on my guest for having more in-studio guest,
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  audio feeds, video edits, special reports.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  You're going to get things exclusively on this show before it's even uploaded
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  to be downloaded by members.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  Members are going to get it immediately live streaming.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  We're going to give you all sorts of sneak peeks.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  It's just so exciting.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  And then I do plan in the next six months or so,
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  and I've got to really bust my hind end of them and do that while I'm making two films,
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  while I'm doing radio interviews, while I'm taking care of a family and three children
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  to start, and I've got to recruit the talent and do a morning news live show,
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  an afternoon and an evening, and then refeed those throughout the day.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  And Ted's always been a sweetheart and always been there for me,
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  so if he wants to be in association with that or run those feeds over his network,
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  he's welcome to as well.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  So we're up in our game.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  We're up in our game with the next level against the New World Order.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  Nobody's getting any younger.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  The fight has to be upped, and we're going to do it.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  I keep putting out the ideas for other people to carry the ball.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  I've told people what'll be successful.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  Others haven't done it, so I'm stepping up to the plate.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  I'm going to the next level with your help, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  And that's why you need to support our sponsors, buy the books and videos I sell
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  by my films at infowars.com, because that's how we're going to bankroll this.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  That's how we're going to do this.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  And so by your PrisonPlanet.tv membership, that funds what we're doing.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  And if you haven't gotten a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, the four-year anniversary is today.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  Four years of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  Back around April 7th, 2004, we started PrisonPlanet.tv, and then it was just one server,
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  and at night it would get bogged down and stuff, but you stuck with us.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  Then we expanded to four servers, and now it's two content distribution networks.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  I mean, you can download it in four times T1 speed on one system, even faster on the other.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  We've got it in five different speeds, depending on your connection.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  We're just upping the game, upping the game, upping the game, making it better and better.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  We're going to add more and more.
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  We're going to upload some of the old films that aren't in super high quality up there for you.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  We've got to hire the people to have the time to do that, because I've got three people working on
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  PrisonPlanet.tv, basically full-time right now, and we've got so much content we can't even get it out to you.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  Well, we're going to up our game here for you.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  This office is not big enough. I've got to get a bigger one.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  We're struggling here. Basically, we're cramming a size 12 foot into a size 10 shoe.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  I just want to commend the whole team and everything else everybody's doing here.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  For those that just joined us, I'll be doing a fourth hour today.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  Alan, a lot of you will be with me in the third hour, and then in the fourth hour as well.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  We're going to play a five-minute video intro at the start of the fourth hour.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  And then, again, later this week, we're going to have some exclusive video, never before seen from the upcoming JFK film I'm working on.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  Later in the week, we'll also have some clips from the new 9-11 film that I'm working on.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  And it's just going to be constant.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  What members of PrisonPlanet.tv, again, of course, anybody can go and hear the audio.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  We welcome everybody to go listen for free to a 32-bit stream, and we're going to be upping out as well in the near future
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  for everybody with the audio.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  But, again, ladies and gentlemen, that is the big announcement, and it is a big announcement.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  I have, for 10 years since 1998, been doing three hours 11-2.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  Head to head with Rush Limbaugh.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  And now I'm expanding it to four hours.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  So you'll be able to hear me up until 3 p.m. Central Standard Time, and that fourth hour is always going to be more produced, more special, even better guessed in that fourth hour.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  I'm going to make that a shining jewel.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  Some days we'll just go to nothing but calls in that hour, but a lot of days it's going to be really special, and the calls are always special as well.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  Now, we're going to break and come back and play the 20-minute interview with Charlton Heston, then I'm going to get into the economy.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  Then Ellen Watt joins us, finishing up with the kids' dress-up day, draws criticism.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  Boys told to dress as girls, girls told to dress as boys.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  This is nothing.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  They teach them about things I can't mention in elementary school, things I can't say on the radio are taught to these children, ruining their innocence.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  And why did the eugenicist 100 years ago say they wanted to promote all this?
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  It's not because it's cutting edge or cool.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  And I don't hate any of these people.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  I'm not bringing this up to hate you.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  I'm saying why this is scientifically done, so that you don't breed, so that you don't have children, so that the family is broken up, so you have no one to defend you or protect you.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  The tribe has always been the defense mechanism against tyranny, the family.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  And that ties in with, look at this Washington Post headline, three kids, you show-offs.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  And it's about, oh, having more than two kids is evil, more than one kid's evil.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  See, it's not just Ted Turner now, it's everywhere this is being promoted.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  The attack is full scale, we'll be right back.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:20:00.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:03.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need, they're after power.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  That's their aptitude.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com

[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[1:23:54.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  That's right, launching today, April 7th, 2008, the fourth hour of the radio show.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  Where do you go to hear it?
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  Infowars.com, the one place you'll be able to hear that fourth hour on those streams for free.
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  The birds will be dialing in in the next few weeks and the M&FMs will be able to get it as well.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  I'm taking fight! I said I'll never give it up!
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  You only live once!
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  I am excited. I'm not standing still. I'm not settling in. I'm intensifying my info war.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  You're thinking like a fool because all it takes is you and I. Out there is a fortune weighed into be had.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  And what is that fortune, ladies and gentlemen? It's liberty. It's freedom. It's children. It's families.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  It's security. It's happiness. It's arms. It's property. It's sovereignty.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  Not being the chattel slave of a bunch of scum. New World Order!
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  All right. I'm going to go ahead and roll the Charlton Heston interview.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  Short clip now. Come back and play the rest of it after the break. Right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  Now for our esteemed guest, Charlton Heston, and he really is the Hollywood icon in the world today.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  He's probably the most recognized person other than presidents or other top politicians like British Prime Ministers or something.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  And I don't say that lightly. I mean, everybody knows who Charlton Heston is.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  And it really made the socialist in the culture war, as Mr. Heston calls it, angry when he stepped up at the plate a couple years ago,
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  back into the Second Amendment fight, and now his new book is amazing, The Courage to Be Freak.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  Mr. Heston, thank you for joining us today.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  Well, thank you for loaning me your audience. It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  You bet. Why did you decide to get back really involved in the Second Amendment fight at the forefront and to write this new book, The Courage to Be Freak?
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  Well, of course, I've been involved with the Second Amendment, you could say, since I was a little kid shooting a deer up in Michigan.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  But then I became involved more seriously with the Bill of Rights, and I came to see the importance of defending every one of the 12 articles of the Bill of Rights,
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  of which the second is the right to keep and bear arms.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  And we had a lot of success with it in the last election.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  It was an interesting thing. The president last April felt that this would be a good time to take down the NRA,
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  and he made a couple of brief radio addresses about it and so on.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  But he realized it wasn't going to fly, and so he abandoned it.
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  And, of course, what he didn't realize as we found ourselves rather amazed to find,
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  when I was campaigning through, what, eight different states and several different cities,
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  and what the president had not realized is not just the NRA.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  The NRA has watched just under 5,000 members. I'm sorry, 5 million.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  And we have campaigned on this issue in part because, of course, as again, the president did not realize that an overwhelming proportion of people in this country are hunters.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  Of course they are. This is hunting country. The whole continent is a hunting continent, except for New York City and LA, of course.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  And we had enormous success. We would gather crowds. Flint, Michigan, I think, was the biggest one.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  We had a rally at 7 o'clock in the morning, which meant people who were going to work if they were striving to work had to get up to come at 6 o'clock.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  And we had over 3,000 people in some different venues.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  And in every case, the Second Amendment won the day. It was quite surprising, I have to say.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  Well, we see the mainstream media that controlled propaganda arms is what I call them, and I think they've shown themselves to deserve that title,
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  convincing a lot of people that the average American isn't for the Second Amendment.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  But if you can explain to people the basics of how it's there to defend us from the street thug, the government thug, or to put food on the table,
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  not to mention just as a sporting enjoyment and heritage, most people are actually for it.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  John Ashcroft right now, they're trying to confirm him. I think he would be a good...
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  I think he will be confirmed. I think he will make a fine attorney general, certainly a far better one than Janet Reno.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  Absolutely. That wouldn't be too hard to do. But Mr. Kennedy, who I really don't think has any room to talk, with all the skeletons in his closet, began to attack us.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:33:55.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  There is no one in the U.S. Senate that has more skeletons in his closet than Kennedy. He should be ashamed of himself. He really should. I worked for his older brother. I voted for him. I campaigned for him.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  But Teddy Kennedy is another piece of work entirely. But anyway, to return to the question of the Second Amendment, there are, for example, now 41 states that have concealed carry laws.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  Meaning that if you pass a background check, show that you have no felony convictions of any kind, show that you demonstrate that you know how to use a firearm safely, you can then get a permit to carry a concealed carry weapon under your arm or wherever.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  And that's something I don't want to do because I don't see it. I've used too many pistols and too many movies. They're kind of heavy to carry. But anyway, the point is that in every one of the 42 states where there is concealed carry laws, one, the murder rate, the crime rate, two.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  Never mind the murder rate. The crime rate has dropped significantly, significantly in every one of those states. Why? Because, of course, most people who have this permit don't carry all the time. But the point is that bad guys don't know who's carrying and who isn't.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  So that is, of course, you don't need to have to carry that.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're talking to Charlton Heston, his new book. We'll try to get it in just a second. The courage to be free. It's powerful. I read about half of it this morning.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  Well, thank you.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  I just got it in yesterday. But going back to the Ashcroft thing, because it ties into the Second Amendment.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  It does indeed.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  Kennedy attacked him on the Second Amendment because, of course, Ashcroft is pro-Second Amendment, pro-Constitution Bill of Rights. And he said, how dare you say that these guns are here to defend us from tyranny and government? Well, it turned out that Ashcroft's actual quote was basically paraphrasing Thomas Jefferson.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  So how dare Kennedy? Any comments on that?
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  You know, I have to say, much as I admired his big brother, I think Teddy Kennedy is one of the worst members of the U.S. Senate. I really feel that. And he shoots his mouth off, and he has the right to do so. He's a U.S. senator. But he is not a good one.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  Well, I think they show their hatred for the Second Amendment. You talk about a culture war a lot in your newest book, and, of course, in your eloquent speeches. I almost fell over when I saw you on one of the NRA news shows when you said you can take it from my cold, dead hand.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  You raised up that musket.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  Yeah, that worked out very well. But I think, you know, I can give you any number of examples. For example, do you know the largest and fastest growing group of purchasers of small handguns in the country?
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  Single women, of course. There are women with permanently absent husbands who have two or three kids. They're trying to support. They want to spend some time with them, so that means they have to be there when they're home from school, which means they have to work, make a living, because the husband's long gone,
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  by cleaning office buildings till three, four o'clock in the morning, and then they ride the bus within three or four blocks of where they live. But then they got to walk those last blocks in the dark all by themselves. Of course, they want a small pistol in their purse.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  And how dare this corrupt government, those running it, especially the Democrats, tell women they don't have that right. I'm sure you've heard that the Solicitor General has said that the Second Amendment, Mr. Hessen, does not extend to individuals.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  Yeah, I've read that, but of course that's not true. Every one of the founding fathers, those wise old dead white guys that invented the country, every one of them is elaborately on record at the time about the importance of the Second Amendment and the meaning of the Second Amendment.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  It is simply impossible to deny that. And the efforts of the anti-gun mob are just specious.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  You're talking about the Federalist Papers documenting the truth?
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  Yes, of course. And the Bill of Rights itself, and the Federalist Papers. But also, while they were drafting the Bill of Rights, they went, they wrote, every one of them wrote,
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  they wrote papers on this. As you said, one of the Federalist Papers.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  Mr. Hessen, I know you're incredibly busy. We've got a real short three-minute break right here. If you can stay with us, I want to...
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  Sure, I'm here. I'm fine.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  Fantastic. I want to tell folks how to get the courage to be free. And if every one of you out there doesn't get in the fight like Mr. Hessen has done for the Second Amendment, we're going to lose it.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  And, well, we know who was for gun control, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, you name it. I want to bring up that historical fact, Mr. Hessen, that has lived over quite a few decades watching tyrants globally.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  We'll be right back. This is Genesis and Liberty Works Radio Network. Stay with us.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  All right, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen. And one of our talks, your host, Dave on Clice, just called in and said that he'd be happy to donate his song.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  And it's awesome. You can take it from my cold, dead hands. Probably have to send Mr. Hessen a copy of that.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  We're talking to Charlton Heston, his new book, The Courage to Be Free. And right now, I'm going to tell you how to get it, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  You really need to order this book. You need to, after you're done reading it, pass it on to friends.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  It's a toll-free number to call. It's 800-697-8844. That's 800-697-8844.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  Or go to the website. It's one word, courage-to-be-free.com.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  Now going back to Mr. Heston, who really needs no introduction.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  Tyranny, I mean, isn't that one of the strongest arguments against gun control and restricting?
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  Absolutely. And I'm so glad you asked me that question, because if we consider that our revolution was the first and most significant close to a democratic government since the founding of the Roman Republic,
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  then following our revolution successful was the French Revolution, which quickly collapsed into the bloody terror followed by the dictatorship of Napoleon, followed in due time by the dictatorships of Hitler and Mussolini and Stalin.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  And mind you, two of those men, both Hitler and Mussolini, were elected by democratic procedure.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  And then we get to Paul Pot and Laurent Kabila, who was killed just a day before yesterday, I believe. I think God will not miss him.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  And Marci Tung and, of course, Fidel Castro. And every one of these monsters, and I think it's fair to call them that,
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  every one of them, their first act on taking office, including the two that were elected democratically, their first thing they did was to confiscate all privately held firearms.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  Good defense rests.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  Absolutely, Mr. Heston. Again, Charles and Heston, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  In fact, I've looked at the actual numbers and accountants and others have, and the states with the highest taxes have the most egregious gun control. I don't think that's an accident.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  No, I don't think so either. It's the firm intent of the liberal left. No question.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  Well, how can they even get away with the term liberal, meaning they're into freedom?
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  I see the so-called liberal left militarizing the police, building prisons everywhere, and going after good people's guns.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  Well, of course, originally, the idea of being a liberal meant a certain concern for the rights of the individual. Now it doesn't mean anything like that.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  Now it means the rights of the government, and we have to constantly stand against that.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  Well, the left has really had a problem coming after you because on the subject of, you know, the God-given rights of black people in this country, you were right out there at the forefront fighting.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  When there were real environmental problems, you were out there at the forefront fighting, and now they're like, what is Heston doing?
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  He's out there fighting for the Second Amendment. How dare he?
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  I actually saw some guys on one of the big classic movie shows, Bad Mouthing You, before they aired Soylent Green, which is one of my favorites.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  There you go. But I have to tell you, on the other day on Martin Luther King Day, I was invited by CORE to attend their banquet, and I was the principal speaker, and they gave me a bust of Dr. King, which having spent as much time as I was able to do with him, I'm very proud to have.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  So it's really hard for them to attack your record. I mean, this really is another human right to be able to defend ourselves.
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  Absolutely. It is, certainly, among the first of human rights.
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  Again, folks, the book, The Courage to Be Free, the website, The Courage to Be Free dot com. That's one word, The Courage to Be Free dot com.
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  When we come back in the next segment, Mr. Heston would have left us, but I'll give you the number again to get the book, and I imagine it's in all the major bookstores, or should be.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  Last question, where do you see the fight in the next two years? I think it's critical if the Socialists, known as the Democrats, win control of the House and the Senate.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  We could even, in four years, have the first gentleman, Bill, back in the White House with Hillary as the president.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  No, we couldn't get Mr. Clinton back. That would be against the Constitution.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  Yeah, twenty-second a minute, but he'll still be back in the White House as the first gentleman. See the joke?
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  Yeah, do you think Mrs. Clinton can be elected? I don't think so.
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  I'm not sure.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  Well, we're going to have to work on that, aren't we?
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  Well, we certainly are. In fact, I have to tell you, Mr. Heston, I'm glad to see the NRA getting more hardcore.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  Yeah, we've got to do it. It's too important. We've tried to keep out of that fight, but I think it's this last election proved that it was important to stay with it.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  Every American should vote.
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  I've seen one of your news shows on where you admit the U.N. and others are involved, actively, internationally, to get our guns.
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  Yeah, oh yes, indeed, absolutely.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  Well, Mr. Heston, God bless you for joining us, and I appreciate your long fight for people's rights, and I know you will continue, and best of luck.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  And thank you for loaning me, your audience. It's been a pleasure and a privilege.
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  God bless you, sir.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  And you.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  This is GCN.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  What will you do without freedom?
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, from the archives, January 18, 2001.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  Now, to be clear there, Ashcroft hadn't been sworn in. Bush wasn't in office. It wasn't till January 23, another five days or so until he did get sworn in.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  We were giving Bush a benefit of the doubt. You know, as I talked about FEMA camps being built, militarization of police.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  I talked about how they were positioning Hillary Clinton to be president.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  And, of course, then Bush came in and was pro-New World Order, just like his father had been. I would get on there at the time and say his father was bad, pro-New World Order.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  It looks like Bush is going to be bad. Let's see.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  It's like if Barack Obama gets elected, we're going to say, let's see.
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  We know it's going to end up being really horrible and evil and bad, but let's give them benefit of the doubt and let's see.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  We don't need to see with Hillary or John McCain. They have too big a track record. We know where they stand.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  But some people, we posted the transcript a few days ago on the website of the interview and people were on there going, why is Alex saying John Ashcroft's good?
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  Read the date. He was saying he was going to repeal gun laws. He was saying it was an absolute right. He was being attacked.
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  Ashcroft had voted against Bill Clinton's omnibus crime bill and terrorism package after the Oklahoma City bombing when he was in Congress.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  He had voted against it.
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  And he had spoken out against warrantless wiretaps in police states, so it was looking pretty good.
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  And then he came in and was just absolutely horrible. Even before the 9-11 attacks, you can say, well, he did that because of the attacks.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  Now, even before that, he was big-time police state and it just shows you who we're dealing with here.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  So, Charlton Heston believed in the Second Amendment. The NRA is infiltrated and controlled, but he meant well.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  Quite a actor, father, civil rights activist, all-around amazing person, and I was honored to be able to interview Charlton Heston.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  You know, I'm the type, though, that doesn't really try to get people back on again and again and again.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  And some of these legends end up dying. I should have got Heston back on. I regret that.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  But I'll tell you, I'm going to get Willie Nelson on more. I'm going to get some of the Hollywood people on and I haven't pushed to come on.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  I'm going to go ahead and push them. I'm going to try to get Ventura back on soon because I could have gotten Heston back on.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  Mercury group that was his PR firm, you know, went out and scanned the bigger radio shows and only did about 50 interviews for his book tour.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  I remember the time they contacted us, he fell into our hands.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  And then I talked to Heston a few times at different events I went to and he even remembered the interview.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  That's why I say it's very strange that he suddenly, about a year after that interview, suddenly, oh, I've got Alzheimer's.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  And, you know, I guess it can have onset that fast. It doesn't generally.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  And I remember his wife, Diane Sawyer, trotted him out, had him basically apologize for his stance.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  He looked completely drugged up. Didn't look like that fire in the eyes of Heston.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  A genius, very smart. The stuff he wrote, very eloquent, just a very unusually smart and interesting person, dynamic voice, very powerful actor, a lot of courage.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  And I saw Heston about six months before his announcement in an event in Dallas and he wasn't like that.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  It was like suddenly they rolled him out and he was on Sawyer. I tried to find it on YouTube. I couldn't. Somebody's got that uploaded.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  And he was, and her, his wife was like, he's very sorry for all he's done with these nasty guns.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  And he goes, well, I, and she's kind of looking at him. He goes, well, I did work on a little too much.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  I should have spent more time with my family. You could tell he was more of a kept man at that time.
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  And I'm not trying to attack his wife. It was just, I remember my wife was my girlfriend at the time.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  No, I think we just got married. Yeah, we'd gotten married. When he announced, we just got married.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  I remember I'm sitting on, back then I watched more television, more news, but I would get too angry.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  So I quit watching it right around that time. I still watch it some, but I mean, I'd watch hours every night then.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  And I remember watching them getting so mad. In fact, she, she remembered that when I was talking about it Sunday morning at the house about how I'm mad.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  I got, she said, don't worry, baby, if you ever get Alzheimer's, I won't come out and say you were wrong about all this stuff and trot you out in front of people.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  But notice the media didn't pick up on that. And they didn't then write articles saying he recants his position because it was so obvious.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  Right before he announced that, that snake Michael Moore got an interview with him and then Moore comes in and says, it's your fault.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  This little girl died and Heston just politely gets up and pats him on the arm and leaves. And then Moore stages an event with a camera after Heston had left, claiming Heston ran off, staged all that.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  Moore is just a despicable creature. I don't know. He's kind of redeemed himself a bit coming out and saying he thinks 9-11 is probably an inside job, but he's just a dishonest filmmaker.

[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  Johnny Goh, Goh
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  Johnny Beagle
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  He used to carry his guitar and a gunny sack
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  Go sniffing in the tree by the railroad track
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  Bolling and everything sticking in the shade
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  Strumbling with the rhythm as the drive was made
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  The people passing by, they were stopping to say
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  Oh my, without a little country boy to play
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  Goh, Goh
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  Goh, Johnny Goh, Goh
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  Goh, Johnny Goh, Goh
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  Goh, Johnny Goh, Goh
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  Goh, Goh, Goh, Goh, Johnny Goh
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  Listen, this is out of Bloomberg today
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  Dollar bottom elusive, G7
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  Betch
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  Double
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  Optimism for a dollar rebound that pervaded the currency market
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  The start of the year is fading
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  Because the market basics, it's not coming back
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  Futures traders double bets against the greenback
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  In the past two months
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  And they're also betting gold's gonna surge
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  They're not wrong
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  Data from the Commodities Future Trading Commission
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  Washington Show, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  And Royal Bank of Scotland Group
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  Which have almost 40% of global exchange trading
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  So the currency may slump
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  To 165 per euro by October
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  To 170 by the way, that's what the full report says
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  While the dollar rose April 1st
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  And then it goes on to say that it's actually gonna go down
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  And again, the futures are doubled down on it
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  That it's gonna go down
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  I mean, hundreds of billions of dollars are betted on this
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  Also, consumer confidence is slumming
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  A lot of other key economic indicators
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  Government spending and all time highs
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  And cutting interest rates over and over again
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  Which only draws down the dollar
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  The fundamentals are hyperinflation
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  Which leads to an inflationary depression
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  Every economist we've had on has said
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  I hope that's not the case but
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  It's like having a bulkhead
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  That can only hold the pressure of 100,000 tons of water
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  And they're gonna put 300,000 tons of water against it
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  It's gonna break
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  And the bulkheads rated to 100,000 tons
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  They've already put 200,000 tons against it
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  It's creaking, it's starting to bow
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  There's even a few leaks
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  And they're gonna add another 100,000 pounds of water pressure on it
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  I mean, a miracle might happen
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  And the Easter Bunny might flap down
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  Out of the heavens and wave a magic wand
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  With pixie dust and make all this stop
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  But the globalists have engineered all this
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  I pray it doesn't happen
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  Bringing in Ted Anderson
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  Ted, gold is going back up again
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  Its futures are up
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  And they're betting that gold's gonna go up
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  The futures market a month ago
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  Betted it was gonna go down
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  Now they're betting it's gonna go up
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  That's the market fundamentals
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  Tell us about it
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  Well, Alex, we will have hyperinflation
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  We have the dollars falling way too fast
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  They're printing way too much money
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  We're gonna have hyperinflation here in the United States
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  It's going crazy right now
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  I know we're going to the break
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  But there's some good information on that
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  We should talk about on the other side
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  Because yes, indeed, the dollars falling
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  And it will continue to do so
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  And you've got a life raft as well
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  Great deals, Ted secured gold over a week ago
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  When it was about $30, $40 cheaper
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  And these deals are not lasting long
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, users are buying
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  Opportunity, five minutes with Ted on the economy
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  Then Alan Watts from Canada
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  It is a big idea
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  A new world order
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  In the near future
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:53.000]  As known as the Bilderberg
[1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  What about their objective being world domination?
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  Their great dream of exterminating
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:09.000]  80% of humanity is at hand
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  For the first time in history
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  The elite's plan for world government
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:15.000]  Is blown wide open
[1:59:15.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  You will learn the secret that drives
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  The entire new world order agenda
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  But most people have no idea
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  They're not after money
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  They have all the money they need
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:27.000]  They're after power

[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:52.000]  Waging war on corruption
[1:59:52.000 --> 2:00:12.000]  One hour from now
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  We go live on the video cam
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  With the document cam, video clips, everything
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:21.000]  In my new fourth hour
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  Going back to Ted Anderson, owner of the Genesis Network
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  Also owns Minus Resources, 28 years, almost 30 years
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  In the gold and silver precious metals business
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  Ted, continuing with what's happening with the market
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  The futures market, doubling down their bets
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  That the dollar is going to implode
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  And the gold and other commodities are going to explode
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  Well, it's going to happen, Alex
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  Because of the fact that we've gone too far into debt
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  And now we're financing our debt with more debt
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  The credit bubbles bursting
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  Every single economist that you talk about out there
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  Are saying the same thing, we've got these problems
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  They're hot, it's here, and there's no way to get away from it
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  We've just simply sold our future out
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  We've ruined our children's future
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  The United States government, the Federal Reserve system
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  Is, you know, it's coming to the end of its reign, if you will
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  I mean, they're just simply, the Federal Reserve note
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  Is not going to be doing well
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  Because of the fact that we are just too far down
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  And we're no longer a world currency
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  We can't borrow it from anybody else
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  So now we have to take printed money
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  And send it into the system to solve our problems
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  And that is why we're going to have hyperinflation
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  And you can blame it on the politicians
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  Going all the way back to 1913
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  Controlled by the bankers, though, though they orchestrated this
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  Ted, tell them about the coin offers you've got
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  Oh, man, Alex, I just got into a deal on silver dollars
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  I can't believe it, I can offer silver dollars again
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  First time in probably a month
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  A month and a half, yeah
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  540 dollars per roll of 20
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  And these are silver dollars
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  And right now, if you've been thinking about getting involved
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  In the silver market, this is the thing to do
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  Because it is very tight right now
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  And I'll be lucky to get these in the future
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  The other thing I do have to offer, like you said
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  I kept the British sovereign deal the same exact
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  As it was on Friday
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  And gold hit a high today of 930
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  That's 30 dollars more than it was on Friday
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  And I picked this up in the 889 area
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  So right now I've got British sovereigns available
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  And they're at 247
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  I also have the Frank coin
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  Sitting in the same situation
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  It's 197 per coin
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  And that coin was priced back
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  When gold was less than 900 dollars per ounce
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous deal
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, convert out of greenbacks now
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  While you still have time
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  At least hedge your bets
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  Even mainstream news is saying 20% gold now
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  When they used to say 10%
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  1-800-686-2237
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  The brokers are there to take your order
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  You just call up, tell them the Alex Jones special
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  That Alex Jones and Ted Anderson sent you
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  Or it will be this week's prices
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  Gotta tell them that Alex and Ted sent you
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  The Alex Jones special 1-800-686-2237
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  To move into the medals before they go up again
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  1-800-686-2237
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  Yeah, the British sovereigns are in the 250 range now
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  So definitely, and so are the Franks
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  I just didn't price that particular coin
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  But all that stuff is gone up
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  So you do have an opportunity to do it
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  You locked in, you bought these
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  What a week and a half ago
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  That's why, how long till these are gone?
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  Well, it's a small supply
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  It depends upon how many people are buying
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  At this particular moment
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  But I'm going to hold them today
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  If you want to get into something
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  And you want to get into something
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  By the way, when you say that a lot of times
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  You get 10, 20, 30, 40 orders
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  That you've got to buy at the new price
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  Because you've run out
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  But you still give it to them at that price
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  Well, if I have to take the loss, I will
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  But the thing is, the main thing is
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  To get the money, to get the gold
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  Into the hands of the people
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  And right now, with the way the economy is going
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  The more gold in the hands of people, the better it is
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  And this is real currency
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  This has been real money for six and a half thousand years
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  1-800-686-2237
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  If you missed that number
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  It's 1-800-686-2237
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  What is it? 1-800-686-2237
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  I tell you, Ted, in between alarm pass codes
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  And computer pass codes
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  And 1-800 numbers
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  I can't keep track of any of them anymore
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  You've had that number ever since I was with you
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  Eleven years ago
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  But 1-800-686-2237
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  1-800-686-2237
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  I've got to say it faster, I can't remember it
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  It's kind of like US Code
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  Stuff like that, I've got to say it faster
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  I can't remember it
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  Yeah, well thanks for having me up, Alex
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  And I just think it's just great
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  That we're getting that television thing up there
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  We'll knock this new world over one way or another
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  We'll get up there
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:35.000]  Absolutely
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  Ted, thank you so much
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  1-800-686-2237
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  We'll be right back with Alan Watt
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  The most downloaded film in internet history
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  Comes the long awaited release

[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  That completely destroys the official fable forever
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  For a new independent investigation
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  In which family members receive answers
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  To their questions
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  And the true perpetrators
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  Of the horrendous crime are brought to justice
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases

[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  Do something
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  Stand up for the only man worthy of restoring our country
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  To how our forefathers envisioned
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  Fly a Ron Paul flag today
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:51.000]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  Cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  Due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  As well as prevention of disease
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  People who alkalize the water they drink
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  And doesn't neutralize it
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  Do your part, alkalize, and supercharge your body now
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  That raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  With only 10 drops
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  Order your bottle of Alkavision plasma pH drops now
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  By going directly to alkavision.com
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  Again, that's alkavision.com
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  Probably presents the Alex Jones show
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  Because there's a war on for your mind
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  Coming up in about 52 minutes from now
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  We're going to start the new fourth hour of the show
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  Since 1997
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:27.000]  I have been doing a weekday show
[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  At first it was one hour, then in 98 it went to three hours
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  And so for more than 10 years, we have been in this time slot
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  I'm expanding it to four hours
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  We're going to have video feeds up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  Starting in about 51 minutes from now
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  A document cam, video clips
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  We're going to have guest cams, we're guest in studio
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  All of that for prisonplanet.tv members
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  But everybody can listen to the radio feed for free at infowars.com
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  At 32-bit and we're going to be upping that to 64
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  It is already 64 starting today
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  Four members in the fourth hour at prisonplanet.tv
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  That's 15 cents a day
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  That pays for the super content distribution network servers that we have
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  Big difference there from your normal server systems
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  Okay, Alan Watt is a very interesting person, he's a musician
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  Let me just read his bio
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  He's been on with this a few times before
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  But he's with us for about an hour and 50 minutes today
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  He calls it as WeBitBio from his cutting through the matrix.net website
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  Alan Watt is a long-term researcher into the causative forces
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  Behind major changes in historical development
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  His background is that of a Renaissance man with a background in three professions
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  Plus having various books published in religious philosophy, poetry
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  Mainly under pseudonyms
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  For much of his life, for main income
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  He was heavily involved in the music industry as a singer, songwriter, performer
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  Involved in folk music, blues, pop, rock, and even classical
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  Also known for his session guitar work
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  He has played with some of the most well-known artists and groups
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  Born in Scotland, he watched the subtleties and politics and media
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  As they guided the population of the UK covertly
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  And the European amalgamation
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  He has been warning the North American people for some years now
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  That the same process of amalgamation is being carried out
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  With historical documentation, he shows how cultures are created
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  And altered by those in control always to lead the people
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  Like sheep into the next pasture
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  That's right, they always have us in a current phase
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  And are prepping us for the next phase
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  Just like they're creating economic collapse
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  The fellow reserve publicly engineers it
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  Now they're offering you the next phase
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  Giving them unlimited governmental power, no oversight
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  Private bankers literally running everything
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  Into the next pasture
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  He learns the true esoteric meanings of mystery religions
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  For one who knows, learn the science of religion, creation, domination
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  The latest book trilogy coming through the Matrix Volumes 1, 2, and 3 Attempts
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  To deprogram the reader from his or her indoctrination from accepting the world as presented
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  And it goes on
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  Alan Watt, thank you for spending time with us today
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  It's a pleasure to be on
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  You've got the floor
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  Just tell us about Alan Watt a little bit more
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  How you woke up
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  And then when you really clicked and decided
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  In the last decade or so
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  I became aware of it in the last five years or so
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.000]  To start fighting the New World Order
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  And really go public against them
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  Which is a risky business
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  And then let's break down the basic overarching system
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  And then get into eugenics, their overall drive
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  Let's understand the elite's mindset before we go into their control grid
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  Well, I caught on when I was very young
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  To the fact that even the British system
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  Although with the appearance of competition and free enterprise and so on
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  Was entirely fixed as a fixed system
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  And it had a rigged system
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  And it also had a completely fake history
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  The history that was being taught in school
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  Didn't jive with the books written 200 years ago
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  Which were available at some old libraries in Scotland
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  And I got into these libraries very young
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  From the age of seven and eight
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  And I was reading stuff that happened at the time
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  Only to find out that what was being taught in school
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  Was a completely revamped altered history
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  And then I got into some of the major players
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  On the Bertrand Russells, the Huxleys
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  The big families that had a hand in the creation of culture
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  And it wasn't just the creation of culture
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  I caught on early that there was a huge agenda at play
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  And it were all living through parts of it
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  Every generation was living through a part of it
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  But you can go back in history to find
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  That this agenda was laid out openly
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  In the court of Queen Elizabeth I, for instance, with John Dee
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  Who coined the phrase, the term, the British Empire
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  For the first time
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  And he presented his idea of a British-style empire
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  With a British-type government running the world
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  On a system of what he called free trade
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  And he led it out right down to those countries
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  Which would adopt that system
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  They would be given most favorite nation trading status
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  This isn't the 1500s
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  And then you fall down from there
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  And see it working through the British conquest of the world
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  During the Victorian era
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  You also find this other group that appears initially to oppose them
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  And that was called Marxism
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  Only to find out that all the Marxist philosophies
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  Were written in London, England
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  And that Marx himself and Engels and others
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  Were being sheltered and given protection
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  By the British government
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  Stop and zoom in there
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  When I made my film, Martial Law, back in 2004
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  I went out on the streets of these peace demonstrations
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  Where most of the people were well-meaning
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  But there were the control groups kind of leading it
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  And the communists were there
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  And I've had communists and anarchists who
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  People said that's the opposite
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  No, they actually worked together
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  Not the minions, but the controllers
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  Come up to me and even tell me, yeah, we work for the government
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  When they see there's not a camera and we're going to kill you soon
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  And they understand that the leaders do
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  And then I was explaining in the film
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  That the big banks created communism
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  To con the people back into serfdom
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  And try to block some of the renaissance
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  That the globalists controlled, but that had gotten out of their
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  Total control later
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  And I try to explain that it's a false counter-revolution
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  Or a false revolution by the people
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  And the public just can't get that understanding
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  Can you zoom in and flush that out a bit more?
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  Yes, because well, Karl Marx, for instance,
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  Talked about a world
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  That would eventually come into view
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  And he said that there'd be
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  Three trading blocs in the world
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  A far eastern trading bloc
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  A united Europe
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  And a united Americas
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  And he wrote that in the 1840s
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  And lo and behold, we're living through this very, very thing
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  And so they needed conflict
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  Because they believe, you see, this is the Hegelian technique
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  Of creating oppositions
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  And out of the conflict between the two parties
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  And people will always choose one party or another
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  That's why they give you left and right
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  And politics in every country
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  And that goes back to the ministry school
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  The left and right hand
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  One is the left, you know, the liberal
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  The other is the male, you know, patriarchal
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  For those that don't understand
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  And of course, Eric Blair
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  In his 1984 world, there are three blocs
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  The Anglo-American, the European
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  And the Asian, but then he finds out
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  They're really all working together
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  And it's war against the people
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  That's right, the only reason they could keep power
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  Over the public is constant internal warfare
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  And that's, of course, why government
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  Exists in the first place
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:05.000]  To protect you from those bad guys over there
[2:16:05.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  Now, in a world of governmental system
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  And Karl Marx knew this, too
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  It had to have a new enemy
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  And a new enemy would be the terror within
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  Terrorism would be the new enemy
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  In a global society
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  Where there are no real borders
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  And we saw that happening on a mini scale
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  With Stalin
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  Once they had basically conquered
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  And took over the Soviet bloc
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  They had to find new enemies
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  And suddenly they had these purges on terrorists within
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  It could be an extra neighbor
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  And they had hate speech laws
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  They had hate crimes laws
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  They even used the term terrorist
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  And understand
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  Anytime the Nazis, the communists
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  And any of these different tools
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  The globalists get in control
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  Why do they always then mass kill?
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:51.000]  That's their eugenics
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  Which is then part of their religion
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  Which has to have the human sacrifice
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  But I'm interrupting, go back
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  Yes, and so there's no doubt about it
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  The big bankers and the British elite
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  Who do exist in Britain
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:05.000]  Most of them never appear in television
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  They're very old families
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  They come from the Norman descendancy
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:11.000]  These characters are called
[2:17:11.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  And they are the real government
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  Above the so-called elected governments
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  And they don't play politics
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  Because politics is a game
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  But these characters do make an agenda
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  And if you look into one of their front organizations
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  One of the biggest front organizations that they have
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  It's the Royal Institute of International Affairs
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  And explain, that was then transplanted here
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  As a regional governorship known as the CFR
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  And they have these behind the throne
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  Imperial shadow governments
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  In all of the original holdings
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:48.000]  Yes, and Margaret Thatcher admitted that
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  Publicly, when she gave her tour of the world
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  The tour was called The New World Order
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:56.000]  Back in the 90s
[2:17:56.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  And she said, we ex-politicians
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  Ex-premiers, ex-presidents
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  All know each other, we never retire
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  She says, we have a parallel government
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  Which is unelected to the people
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  We can get more done because
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:12.000]  We're not responsible to the public
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  And we work tirelessly towards this goal
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  So she admitted what their establishment was
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  It is the Royal Institute of International Affairs
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  And they're given a royal charter
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  By the British Crown to exist
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  And to speak on behalf of the Crown
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  The unelected elites
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  And they've been working tirelessly
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  Towards this world system
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  But again, to go back to how they created
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  The two party sides
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  They go back to nature in ancient Egypt
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  And they talk about the laws of nature
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  And of course they talked about spring
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  And then you'd have fall and this opposition
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:48.000]  And summer and winter
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  And therefore the whole idea was
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  Everything works in harmony
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  To a new beginning if you go through the process
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  Of having opposites in battle and conflict
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:18:59.000]  And it was updated much later
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  And put to new terminology with Hegel
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  Who called it the thesis antithesis
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  Synthesis is the merging together
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:11.000]  Of the two opposing sides in a compromise
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  And over thousands of years
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  The elites developed this
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  And if the elites didn't develop this
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  And if the power behind the throne
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  Who was always his magicians
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  They understood psychology
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  That is the hidden mystery religion
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:27.000]  They then put on the theater
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  For those out there in the general public
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  Or the congregation
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  And that is the big secret
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  Is just how to punch the buttons
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  In people's minds
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:39.000]  Is that your take on it, Ellen Watt?
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  It's old formula, that's right
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  Formula, we'll be right back
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  We're gonna get into their mindset
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  What they believe, not just what they tell us
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  And their extermination plans
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  For you and your family
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  It is a big idea
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:53.000]  A new world order
[2:19:53.000 --> 2:19:55.000]  In the near future
[2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg group
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:03.000]  And their objective being world domination
[2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:05.000]  For thousands of years
[2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:07.000]  Their dark order grew
[2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:09.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:11.000]  Their great dream
[2:20:11.000 --> 2:20:13.000]  Of exterminating 80% of humanity
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:15.000]  Is at hand
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:19.000]  For the first time in history
[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  The elites' plan for world government
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:23.000]  Is blown wide open
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  You will learn the secret that drives
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  The entire new world order agenda
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:29.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  People have no idea, they're not after money
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  They have all the money they need
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  They're after power

[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  Going back to Alan Watt, please continue
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  We've talked about the grid they built
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  We're going to get more into that
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  But specifically their mindsets
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  What they believe, what they're into
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  Where they think they're going
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  From your research, get into that Alan
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  Where they're going is to
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  Utopia, they've talked about utopia, a golden age
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  For thousands of years
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  Every elite has talked about the possibility
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  Of immortality in this world, in this particular body
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  By understanding nature once again
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  In other words science, by conquering the laws of nature
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  They could conquer death for themselves
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  And there's no doubt about it
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  They want to fix, as they say
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  In their old religions, the spirit
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  And the physical body for eternity
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  And no more
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  And they talk too many of them
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  Do believe in reincarnation, but they believe
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  That they are the most evolved species
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  Both spiritually and physically on the planet
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  Later this was brought out by Charles Darwin
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  Under another guy, a pseudo-scientific guy
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  Of determinism through superior types
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  Let's be clear, they claim on the surface
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  They're atheists, but they're actually
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  Deep occultists and believe they're God
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  And have God complexes
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  That's why they've got giant, heavy cyclotrons
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  Colliding heavy particles, which the equations show
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  Could cause a huge chain reaction
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  And destroy the whole planet
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  They can't help it though, they've got to play God
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  They have to, and they truly do believe
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  That through their advanced sciences
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  They will dominate nature
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  And everything in it
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  When you look at the old Psalms
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  Written for Pharaohs
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  You'll see that the Psalms would say
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  The Pharaoh is God, he is God on earth
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  And he owns everything in the world
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  Everything that flies, crawls, walks
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  Or burrows on the earth is his
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  The land is his, the people are his
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  He was the owner of everything
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  And it hasn't really changed
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  The elite truly believe
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  That we should worship them
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  For giving us their system
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  We should worship them
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  For giving us jobs
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:47.000]  And they claim that's the only purpose that we have
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  And like good shepherds
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  When they have no more jobs for us
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  Than their jobs to cull us off
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  That's how much they love their animals
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  And the world that they've drawn up
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  Is to be a vastly reduced population
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  And not only a reduced population
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  But through the genotype of different people
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  And the human genome project
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  They're going to take the best genes
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:15.000]  And create a better race of purpose-made slaves
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  This has been published in many scientific journals
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  Purpose-made humans for purpose-made jobs
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  That's right, and what in 1916
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  H.G. Wells had already written about atomic and hydrogen bombs
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  Because Max Planck and others
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  By 1905 had already put out the equations
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  Probably before that
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  That's when they told the public about it
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  And then they used Einstein as the vehicle
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  To basically publicize it
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  They had, you know, he had written
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  About the Eloi and Morlocks
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  Almost 100 years ago
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  This elite, cold-blooded, psychopathic elite
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  And their slaves, and going back 150 years ago
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  To Galton and his cousin
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  Of course, Darwin, this is all an in-game
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, they already believed
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  They were the super-racing inner bread
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  That actually made unhealthy lunatics
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  Or people who had extra or less chromosomes
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  Massive genetic problems
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  So now they want to prove they're the best
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  They're saying, okay, well, we'll
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  We'll actually come in artificially
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  Just like in Huxley's 1933 Brave New World
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  We're going to make you stupid
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  Oh, there's no doubt about it
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  They had meetings at the beginning of the 20th century
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  On how to dominate
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  The public, the general public
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  The entire planet through chemical means
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  Through ways of using chemicals
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  To lobotomize specific parts of the brain
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  To make people more
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  And also by using the needle
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  Even Bertrand Russell talked about
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  The use of the needle will make people very compliant
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  And they can, they can target specific parts
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  Of the brain through chemicals or viruses
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  That they can send right to your brain
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  And I really do believe
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  In reason for inoculations
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  Because we look at the IQ dropping
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  Plunging since the 1950s
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  Just like sperm dropping
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  And then all the PR ads about how good
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  The shots are for you
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  And people are becoming so unhealthy
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  Surgeons are calling me telling me
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  That they're opening up young men
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  And their bodies inside have advanced aging
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  I think they were 70 years old
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  Well, that's the GMO food
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:26.000]  Which they knew would do that as well
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're being orderly
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  Exterminated with soft kill weapons
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  All Pentagon run, hope you enjoy it
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  Go ahead and serve the system, those that are laughing
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  They're killing you, I know you love your masters
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:57.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run
[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  That's less than half the regular subscription price
[2:30:48.000 --> 2:30:50.000]  Attention GCN listeners
[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:52.000]  Would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated

[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:41.000]  And Alan Waddle will be with us for the duration of that hour
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  Also, we're going to take the hour-long encoding
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  Of my document cam, of the video cam in here on me
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  And on the video clips we play
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  And Alan Waddle
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  And that will be uploaded and posted
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  At www.prisonplanet.tv within a few hours
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  At the end of the show
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  Because this is the internet
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  And sometimes there will be glitches on the cam
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  When thousands and thousands of people are on there
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  But we're always encoding here locally
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  We've got one machine encoding now
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  We're going to go to about two soon as backup
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  And so you'll always be able to see it, period
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  It's going to be very, very timely
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  Always, even if you miss it live while you're at work
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:14.000]  You'll be able to get home
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  And there'll be the new video for you five days a week
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  We're even looking into coming in with just a basic webcam
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  On the Sunday show
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  As we develop and expand things
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  So the free audio of the show
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  The radio show coming up in the fourth hour
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  www.infowars.com
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  But if you want the video cam
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:32.000]  Get your 15-cent a day prisonplanet.tv membership
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  Going back to researcher Alan Waddle
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  Joins us from Canada
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:39.000]  His website, cut into the matrix.net
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  A link up on infowars.com
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:44.000]  Alan, please continue
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  Yes, and so the dialectical process works so well
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  Because the public will always pick this side
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  Or that side, whichever one appeals to them
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  Or whichever side their father or mother has followed
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:00.000]  Before they adopt the same attitude
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  And they don't think beyond that
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  However, this agenda will just be set up
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  Under a new system eventually
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  That would take over from this vague term called democracy
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  But never really had a true democracy
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  In the history of the world
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  And the new system that would come in
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  And this was published at the beginning of the 20th century
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  It said that under this new democracy
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  Only those biggest groups that exist
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  And who are authorized to exist
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:32.000]  Would have a say in their fears of government
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  We now call them non-governmental organizations
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  And so with the use of, again, front NGO groups
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  Non-governmental organizations
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:44.000]  Who would pretend to demand from government
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  On behalf of the public
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  That certain laws be passed on various things
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  They would guide this whole system
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  Into their brave new world scenario
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  And it's all stated, and they brag
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  Even in these textbooks
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  Hundreds of books out there, well, some of the names
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  That the slaves never read so we can admit their slaves
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  And they also point at the renomab NGOs
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  Non-governmental organizations
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  And then say that that is the grassroots
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  Really, this is all an elaborate thespian
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  The whole world is a stage
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  Each of us a player upon it
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  Of course, we know that Shakespeare was an insider
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  That was really just an acronym
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  For a group of illuminous that wrote under his name
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  He really wasn't writing a book a week, ladies and gentlemen
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  And the history shows that some say it was really the king
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  Or the prince, well, it was
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  William Shakespeare was just a front
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  For a whole group of these people
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  To put this out, and so they expansively
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:42.000]  Then pre-program the public control
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  Both sides of the debate
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  It was even deeper because they introduced
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  A whole new language into England
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:53.000]  With the King James Bible and Shakespeare
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  Around the same time
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  Because prior to that, if you read the
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  The writings of Chaucer and others
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  Around the 11th century, you'll see that
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  They were speaking a form of Saxon German
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  And so the best even upgraded the language
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  Because language itself is very important
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  To this whole agenda, we think in a language
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  We're like computers, and technically
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  And they knew this a long time ago
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  If they gave you a certain type of language
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  And they already know the logic
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  Like the logic of the computer
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:28.000]  Then the programmer will know the answer
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  To every question that you as a being
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  Must arrive at, because you'll use your logic
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  Use their language, and you'll arrive
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  At the predestined conclusion
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  Why do people love logos?
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  The Volkswagen logo, the CBS logo
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  Because in our development we would know
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  What if a spider was poisonous or not
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  By its spots, or by its red hourglass
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  Or by its little violin
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:54.000]  We would know whether a fish was good
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:56.000]  To eat by its spots, by the way it looks
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  And so language really, in the human mind
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  Is symbols or characters
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  Like in Chinese or Japanese
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  Where it's pictorial, pictographs, pictures
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  They then come in and change the meaning
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  Of those words, and then add new
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  Mental recognition to those verbal
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  Signals, and they are now altering those
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  Yes, very, very simple
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  Very, very simple, and sure enough
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  They do keep changing the meanings of words
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  And George Orwell warned us about that too
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  How easy it is to do, and if you start to adapt
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  And adopt the new terms that are given to you
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  You're being programmed automatically
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  Most people today, and this was written about in the 1960s
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  By the Royal Institute of International Affairs
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  When they had the world meeting
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  To decide which organization, which country
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  Would lead the world for the new culture
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  And they said that they'd give the job to Hollywood
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  Most young people that watch all of these
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  Soaps and so on, their school dramas and so on
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  And they don't realize there's new words
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  New vocabulary being introduced, new meanings of words
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  As they change them, and they start to parrot them
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  They mimic them, as Charles Galton Darwin said
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  So this is an age-old technique of controlling culture
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  Through the use of words, and the gradual
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:18.000]  Now let's be clear, that was firmly institutionalized
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  Going back 50 years ago, where the FBI
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  Would oversee all the production houses
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  And have you arrested or blackballed
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  If you didn't follow the order
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  There is the overt control
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  Now today, the feds since 2001
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  Have been spending 45 million a year
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  And this was in the Washington Post LA Times
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  To just pay one script writing house
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  To write the, quote, government terror scripts
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  And then you look, and they're actually using
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  Those terror scripts in real attacks
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  So it goes vice versa
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  And then I remember having the lone gunman
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  And ex files starting Dean Haglin
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:00.000]  He called me up and said, I want to come visit you
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  He said, listen, the CIA visited us
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  And they would plant these on us
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  And tell us, hey, it's a good idea if you used it
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  So I want to be clear, everybody in Hollywood
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  Is it marching around getting CIA orders
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:15.000]  It's the top producers, it's the top production houses
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  They decide what they want to pick
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  Out of the millions of scripts
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  And then once you start ideas rolling
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  It magnifies and others parrot it, adapt it, change it
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  And don't even know they're taking part
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:28.000]  In the larger program
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  One month before 9-11 happened
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  The international censorship committees
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  Of the world met
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  And I didn't know at that time
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  What an international censorship committee
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  I knew every country had one
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  And you think your censorship committee
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  Is there to see what you'll be exposed to
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  On television and so on
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  And it's there to protect you
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  But they published their findings
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  And they published their speeches
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  From the international meeting
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  This got lost immediately when the bombings
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  Happened at 9-11
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  But I remember them and I kept, I cut them up
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  In newspapers because they have speeches
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  Given identical speeches written
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:09.000]  By the same scripture obviously
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  For two professors, one in the United States
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  Who attended the meeting
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  One in Canada at a university here
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  And they said, now we have won
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  The battle for homosexuality
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  And lesbianism and so on
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  We will push the envelope
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  Our next target is for bestiality
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  And intergenerational sex
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  That will be promoted heavily
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  Through comedy, television and so on
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  So your censorship committee
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  Is there to guide the culture
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  Into the next phase and the next phase
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  And the next phase not to protect you
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  And that's because they have to
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  Cold-bloodily remove
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  The old basic human programming
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  To keep tribes together and healthy
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  They have to fracture breakup families
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  Breakup societies reduce us to
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  Isolated creatures
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  Who only have a relationship
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  With the flickering television or computer screen
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  Being programmed by our imaginary friends
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  And they even call the show friends
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  And it must be very
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  You see again, Blair or George Orwell
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  Talked about this ability
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  For bureaucracies to adapt
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  So quickly what's true and correct
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  One day you must
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  Truly instantly believe it
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  This new correctness for today
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  Even though it's diametrically opposed
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  To your conditioning yesterday
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  And it's constant adaptation
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  Of political correctness
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  Now the term political correctness
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  Came from the Soviet Union
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  From the Soviet for the same thing
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  And when they introduced the term
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  Political correctness in the West
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  They also introduced the term
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  Also from the Soviet Union
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  And that was anti-government
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  It started to appear in the paper
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  For the first time anti-government
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  So if you complain about government
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  Or a policy suddenly you are anti-government
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  So it makes sense because remember
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  What Senator Dodds, Norman Dodds
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  Found out when he did the re-commission
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:42:59.000]  Back in the 60s
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:01.000]  He found the big foundations
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  Now the big foundations are the boys
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  That pretend they're big charitable institutions
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:07.000]  Multi-billionaire, trillionaire institutions
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  They dish out the money
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:11.000]  That funds these professional
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:13.000]  Non-governmental organizations
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:15.000]  And Dodds found out
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  From the Ford Foundation, Carnegie and Rockefeller
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:19.000]  The guy at the Ford Foundation told them
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  Our purpose is to
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:23.000]  Eventually blend seamlessly
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  The Soviet system
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  With the American system into one
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  Well let me expand on that
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  Let's just zoom in on a tiny microcosm
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  Of the entire picture
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  For 50 years
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  The Ford Foundation has been
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  Funding textbooks and comic books
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:41.000]  Millions of them a year just like
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  Marvel
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  Last year got criticized for
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  They're going to give every American child
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  A U.N. comic books every few months
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  That teach us to like world government
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  They admitted it, the U.N. said
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  To teach us to accept global government
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:43:57.000]  Environmental system is an organizing
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  Cause, which is their whole eugenics program
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  And they said don't get mad, we've been doing this
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:03.000]  With comic book people since the late 1940s
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:05.000]  Well it's the same thing
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  Comic books in Mexico saying
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  America took the Southwest
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  The U.S. is bad, you want to break it down
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  La Reconquista, our government
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  It's like our government, the criminals that run it
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:17.000]  It came out in the Washington Post
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  For 30 plus years
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  Up until 2002
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  We're still shipping millions
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  Of comic books and free radical
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  Hadithas, radical Islamic text
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  Interpretations
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  To the Muslim countries from a
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  Wahhabist perspective
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  And the Saudi Arabians would match money with the CIA
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  To radicalize Muslims
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  So they could use those religious Muslims
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  To tear down any secular government
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  To actually neutralize and weaken
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:45.000]  The Middle Eastern
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  And Central Asian areas
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:49.000]  So again, there's the foundations
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  There's the governments breeding the rebellion
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  And in the Soviet Union
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:55.000]  You see this blending together
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:44:57.000]  Of the Soviet system
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:44:59.000]  Has already happened, it's happened here
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:01.000]  They have merged the two into one
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  And remember going back to the book
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:05.000]  Called The First Global Revolution
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:07.000]  Written by the club of Rome
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  Published in the 90s
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  It tells you in there by the founders
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:13.000]  In their own words, they said we
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:15.000]  Back in the 70s looked for a reason
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:17.000]  To unite the planet and if they thought about the space
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:19.000]  Alien would that work, would they all fall for that
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  Then they said we hit upon the idea
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  Of stating that the people
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  In the planet were causing global warming
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  We hit upon the idea
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:29.000]  He says
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  And so they said yes
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  Now the head of the CFR in 1993
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:35.000]  Richard N. Haas
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  And this is published, this is on the CFR website
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:39.000]  And the club of Rome said we made this
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:41.000]  Up to make humanity the enemy
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  That's a quote
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  That's right, I got the book from them
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  I got the whole chapter
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:49.000]  And they're point blank, they're point
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:51.000]  Blank, ladies and gentlemen
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  Everything Alan's saying is in mainline textbooks
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:55.000]  It's all available in the 70s
[2:45:55.000 --> 2:45:57.000]  They had the church hearings
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:45:59.000]  On foundations, they called
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:01.000]  In the heads of the foundations and they admitted
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  The Carnegie Endowment for Peace
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:05.000]  Their founding document says we're going to create war
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  And control it and play countries
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:09.000]  Off against each other to bring in the one world government
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  Yes, and then when Gorbachev
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:13.000]  Of course was president of the
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:15.000]  Soviet Union
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:17.000]  He had already been given
[2:46:17.000 --> 2:46:19.000]  The right to have that organization
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  In the United States
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  While he was still president of the Soviet
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:25.000]  This was the top of the KGB at one time
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  But he was now president
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  And he was given the right to run this
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:31.000]  Green institution for the planet
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:33.000]  In Kahootz with Maurice Strong
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:35.000]  And Mr. Rockefeller
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:37.000]  And he had a hand in drafting
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  Up the Earth Charter
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  And that's Green Cross, Green Shield
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:43.000]  Based at the Presidio Naval Base
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:45.000]  In San Francisco where the UN
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:47.000]  Was born in 1945
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:49.000]  Set up by the Pentagon
[2:46:49.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  Directed by the Royal Institute of International Affairs
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  That's right, and of course
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:55.000]  He was given a knighthood as well
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:46:57.000]  The Green Cross is the knight of Lazarus
[2:46:57.000 --> 2:46:59.000]  That's what it stands for
[2:46:59.000 --> 2:47:01.000]  But he's a Soviet
[2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:03.000]  He's a president of another country
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:05.000]  A foreign country being given
[2:47:05.000 --> 2:47:07.000]  A top position within the United States
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:09.000]  While he's still president of the Soviet Union
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:11.000]  And his last speech he gave to the Politburo
[2:47:11.000 --> 2:47:13.000]  It was printed in the Toronto Sun
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:15.000]  And Eric Margolis
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:17.000]  Was the foreign correspondent
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:19.000]  Who printed up the whole speech
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:21.000]  And Gorbachev told the Politburo
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:23.000]  And the top generals, he says
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  Shortly you'll hear that communism is dead
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  And finished, he says don't believe it
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:29.000]  We're simply moving on to the next phase
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:31.000]  Of merging with the West
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:33.000]  And they never even took the hammer and sickles
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:35.000]  Off the tanks
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  Going back and expanding on that
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  There are so many examples
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  Of our government shipping them
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  Hundreds of millions of pounds
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:45.000]  Of wheat every year, oil
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  The Rockefellers, Armand Hammer
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  Owning the factories, we have Carol Quigley
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  The head of Georgetown political science division
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  Bill Clinton's mentor
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:55.000]  Admitting, bragging
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  To everyone that hey
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  The Royal Institute round table
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  Groups that dominates the CFR
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  And the rest of the world
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  They work with these people
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  They create these people
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  And the 20s said we need a rabble rouser
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:11.000]  To put in power in Germany
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  We'll put the screws to the Germans
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  Hurt them real bad, and then make them come
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  After us, and then we'll have
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  Everybody surrounding Hitler will then sabotage him
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  I mean they're slick man
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  Because they plan out decades
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  So what we're looking at here
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  And here's where it hits most people
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  Who get to a certain stage of waking up
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  You're dealing with an ancient system
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  And an ancient science
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  And very old families
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  Who were given archives of
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  Information on the techniques
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  As it says formula
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  It's all to do with formula
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  If you want the public as Plato said
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  To do anything, look at past history
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  What they've been made to do in the past
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  If you know the formula, you can reintroduce it again
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  At any time in the future
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  And take the movie 300
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  That was the biggest blockbuster last year
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  Made like 400 million bucks
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  They show them killing imperfect babies at birth
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  They show
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  Spartans went out and did human sacrifice
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:07.000]  It's all
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  And shown as the most wonderful thing
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  In the world, that's the beginnings
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  Of the eugenics, and I want to come back Alan
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  We're going to take calls, ladies and gentlemen
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  In the
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  Fourth hour, that's about to start
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  I want to explain to people
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  What their real beliefs are
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  Start getting into the eugenics
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:27.000]  Yeah, the eugenics is incredible
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  We go back to history, we find
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  We find, for instance, pharaohs
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  Kings of Paris, and so on
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  What often marry their own sister
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  Because they truly believed
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  They were already Darwinian
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  Darwin simply was a member of the same group
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  Centuries later
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  Exposing what they already believed in
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  They believed that spiritually and physically
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  They were already the most perfect
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  Beings on the planet
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  And they didn't want to outbreed
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  Into the commoners, they always had two groups
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  Themselves, the gods
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  And the commoners
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  And in Britain, if you are still called
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:03.000]  Commoners, if you're not a member of nobility
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  You are a commoner
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  Well, they also called us the little people
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  And that's how they can tell who comes from
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  A more, quote, noble family, the taller you are
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  Because they would artificially
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  Starve, and that's feudalism
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  The people as a way to control them
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:19.000]  And then they would get madder
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  And madder as they inbred more and more
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  That's why you always hear about kings and queens
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  Not being able to have children and not having heirs
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  Because they were so mentally ill
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  And that's why you always hear about kings and psychopathic
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  Really, they say they're their own species
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  They are, now when they are
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  A psychopath, an inbred guild
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  Do you agree?
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  Absolutely, I've talked to some of them
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  Here at I'm speaking about themselves
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  So have I, we'll be right back with Alan White
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  Your phone calls, the fourth hour coming up

[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  It is a big idea
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  A new world order
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:55.000]  In the near future
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  The truth is dominated by a powerful
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  World government
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:03.000]  But their objective being world domination
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  For thousands of years
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  Their dark order grew
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:11.000]  Their great dream
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  Of exterminating 80% of humanity
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  Is at hand
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:19.000]  For the first time in history
[2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  The elite's plan for world government
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  Is blown wide open
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  And the secret that drives the entire
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:27.000]  New world order agenda
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  They have all the money they need
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:35.000]  They're after power, yes they're after music

[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  Will ever make
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  Call 800-409-5633

[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  That are patiently holding
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  Let me give you the new number to call in
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  I've actually got a 1-800
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  We haven't hooked it up yet
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  And this show will be on the network
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  In the next few weeks
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  But it's only going to be an info
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  What we're going to do
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  We're going to do it
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  We're going to do it
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  We're going to do it
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  We're going to do it
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  But it's only going to be an infowars.com
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  I'm going to call them
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  Get a 4th hour shortwave, too
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  In the next few days, it's going to be an infowars.com
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  Free streams there
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  But you have to go to the infowars.com streams
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  You have to go to the website to hear it
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  It won't be on the Genesis streams this 4th hour
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:54:59.000]  You go to infowars.com right now
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  You can listen for free there on 32-bit
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  Or 16-bit
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:05.000]  And it's going to be in 64-bit
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:07.000]  Four members of PrisonPlanet.tv
[2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  We're going to have a 5-minute video
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  Intro feed and then myself and Ellen White
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  We'll be back and we will be taking your calls
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  Here is the phone number
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  It's 512-646-5400
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  And I think 80-plus percent of the public now
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  Have unlimited long distance
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:23.000]  So 1-800s are really being obsolete
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  But we'll still have one for you
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  512-646-5400
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  512-646-5400
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  I'll be right here myself
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  Taking your phone calls off my board
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  We're going to call them
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  Ellen back here in just a minute or two
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  And get him on my board here too
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  We're beta testing this all myself
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  Live this 4th hour
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  With the video feed and the rest of it
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  Let me just punch the video feed up
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  We're rolling video clips of Stalin and Bush right now
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  But punch myself up so I can say hi to everybody
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  We have a document cam
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:55.000]  I had Chinese food on the document cam
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:57.000]  A few minutes ago
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  But there's the document cam
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  Got the finance and development magazine
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  Global governance, who's in charge
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  It's all just admitted there
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  Oh yeah, world government, we run everything
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  That's for people in management
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  20-something thousand CEOs get this
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  I'm seen as a CEO
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  I guess because I run my own company
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  All this stuff comes in the mail
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  Because they have a list of this
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  I never went on a list, I never asked to be on this
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  But I get sent it
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  Because I'm seen as somebody higher up in the system
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  Even though I fight them, I'm on a list
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  They send it to me
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  Ellen, that's how this works, isn't it?
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  And it's always promote culture
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  And changes from the top down
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  Not from the bottom up
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  So it's following this old routine
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  Even management courses now
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  University, everything has been
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  For quite a few years, globalism
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  Globalism, globalism
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  Here's another example, my dad is a
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  Healthcare consultant
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:53.000]  He's also a dentist and oral surgeon
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  So they always hire those guys
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  Because of medical laws, they want those to be
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  Officers, board members
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  Consultants
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  And he goes all over the country a couple days a week doing this
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  And about four years ago
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  He called me, he was at the Four Seasons here in Austin
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  Because they send him to these big seminars
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  It was like four or five thousand dollars
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  A person to go hear this top guru talk
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  This big CEO and he goes, this guy is talking
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  About world government, how the elite
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:19.000]  Miscalculated and dumbed everybody down too much
[2:57:19.000 --> 2:57:21.000]  So now we're head hunting for home
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:23.000]  Schoolers to get them to join
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  Like you said, Ellen, it's now just right out in the open
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  It is, it truly is in the open
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  And they have such a dumbed down public
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  The public don't really care too much
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  What's happening as long as
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  Their own little life and what they can do
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  Doesn't change too drastically
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  For them
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  Ellen Watts, stay there
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:43.000]  We're breaking, leaving the Genesis
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:45.000]  Mothership and going out on our own
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:47.000]  To find
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:49.000]  New worlds and new civilizations
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:57:51.000]  To boldly go where no radio talk
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  Show host has gone before
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:55.000]  Hey, we'll be right back on video
