[00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:06.165]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:07.927]  Mainstream Media.
[00:00:07.927 --> 00:00:09.688]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:11.270]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.811]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:17.015]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:25.782]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.782 --> 00:00:28.465]  The constitutional crisis intensifies.
[00:00:30.417 --> 00:00:38.463]  As Congress appears to be set to basically block, at least constitutionally, Obama's escalation of the war.
[00:00:38.463 --> 00:00:44.547]  We've got Obama's speech from yesterday that is all lies from end to end.
[00:00:44.547 --> 00:00:54.995]  He implies that this isn't really a military action, but it's not a pinprick, but that they're trying to basically stabilize Syria when they're trying to destabilize Syria.
[00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:56.096]  It's truly amazing.
[00:00:57.338 --> 00:01:04.640]  It is obviously the 12th anniversary of the greatest false flag stage terror attack in history.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.721]  And either way you slice it, 9-11, there was prior knowledge, there was stand down.
[00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:19.122]  And the supposed Saudi Arabian hijackers had multiple passports and were being surveilled by the Israelis and the U.S.
[00:01:19.122 --> 00:01:25.684]  government, the French, the Germans, you name it, and were living and working on military bases in the United States.
[00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:26.224]  That's a fact.
[00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:31.246]  Building 7 was blown up in front of everybody.
[00:01:31.246 --> 00:01:32.167]  The list goes on and on.
[00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:37.375]  We're going to open the phones up today for what you think the biggest smoking guns of 9-11 being an inside job are.
[00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:39.238]  Or if you disagree with me.
[00:01:39.238 --> 00:01:42.123]  But if you look at how criminal elements of the government
[00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:50.246]  Because people always say on national news, when I've been in debates about this, what, you're saying the whole government, the firemen are involved?
[00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:51.327]  The police?
[00:01:51.327 --> 00:01:52.167]  The whole government?
[00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:53.327]  No.
[00:01:53.327 --> 00:01:54.527]  That's a strawman argument.
[00:01:54.527 --> 00:02:06.190]  I'm saying criminal networks are working with Al-Qaeda since it was founded by Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1979, and it goes back before that to the British, and then the Nazis running it.
[00:02:06.903 --> 00:02:16.946]  It's like whoever has control colonially of the Middle East and the United States stepped in by the 70s colonially, even really in the 50s, but intensely by the 70s.
[00:02:16.946 --> 00:02:18.807]  And they like radicals.
[00:02:18.807 --> 00:02:20.427]  They like dictators.
[00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:22.928]  Look at how our government puts dictators in anywhere they can.
[00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:28.790]  Well, they want dictatorial Wahhabist to run the Middle East.
[00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.592]  They don't want swimming pools and movie stars and women going to college over there.
[00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:36.132]  The globalist
[00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:45.008]  Want to keep the Middle East in the Stone Age, and then they can have high-tech drone warfare with the cavemen.
[00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:48.330]  That's basically what's going on here.
[00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.071]  And so we're going to be breaking all of that down today.
[00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:53.252]  Also, this story is up on Infowars.com.
[00:02:53.252 --> 00:02:55.093]  It's also up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:02:55.093 --> 00:03:02.776]  Million Muslim March 2013, and the two million bikers, Washington, D.C., rally expected on anniversary today.
[00:03:02.776 --> 00:03:04.637]  We're going to be following this today.
[00:03:06.548 --> 00:03:13.511]  As it's ongoing.
[00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:27.237]  We're going to be going over the fact that the violations of the First Amendment are only selectively, selectively engaged in.
[00:03:30.222 --> 00:03:36.309]  So when we come back, we're going to launch into the news and then hopefully, I'll give the number out and we'll go to your phone calls.
[00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:38.131]  There's a lot, a lot happening.
[00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:42.696]  Colorado lawmakers ousted in recall vote over gun law.
[00:03:42.696 --> 00:03:44.378]  That's the New York Times.
[00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:49.741]  And we've also got 12 years after 9-11, Obama helps revive Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:53.203]  Yet 12 years later, they've just dropped all the pretenses.
[00:03:53.203 --> 00:03:54.264]  They think we're that dumb.
[00:03:54.264 --> 00:03:57.205]  And obviously it's not working, so it's backfiring.
[00:03:57.205 --> 00:04:00.847]  It's also a 12-year anniversary of military action starting.
[00:04:00.847 --> 00:04:02.988]  It started a few days after 9-11.
[00:04:02.988 --> 00:04:06.490]  So 12-year anniversary, 12-year war, 73% of U.S.
[00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.812]  casualties in Afghanistan on Obama's watch, CNS news.
[00:04:10.672 --> 00:04:13.954]  Why not give him another peace prize over that?
[00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:27.564]  The Russians are sending in their carrier killer into the Mediterranean, loaded up with the anti-ship supersonic missiles.
[00:04:29.804 --> 00:04:33.325]  Things are escalating very, very quickly.
[00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:36.626]  I guess the globalists calculated they could start a large regional war.
[00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:41.367]  The average American will just shut up and get behind their country, right or wrong.
[00:04:41.367 --> 00:04:48.749]  Well, our country is not the criminal kleptocratic globalists that have seized control of our infrastructure.
[00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:52.370]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.271]  Oh, also, Bill Gates has got a new plan.
[00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:58.312]  Not just artificial meat, that's more humane in his words, but artificial eggs.
[00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:04.148]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:05:04.148 --> 00:05:09.672]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:05:09.672 --> 00:05:17.397]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:05:17.397 --> 00:05:26.524]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:05:26.704 --> 00:05:33.872]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:05:33.872 --> 00:05:36.936]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:43.684]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:46.610]  Another plane just hit!
[00:06:00.765 --> 00:06:06.289]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.112]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[00:06:10.112 --> 00:06:13.515]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[00:06:13.515 --> 00:06:16.977]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:23.602]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[00:06:23.602 --> 00:06:27.025]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[00:06:27.665 --> 00:06:39.071]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:06:39.071 --> 00:06:44.014]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[00:06:44.554 --> 00:06:52.678]  To find out more information on how Supernatural Silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens, go to SupernaturalSilver.com.

[00:07:46.537 --> 00:07:49.540]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:14.635]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:14.635 --> 00:08:16.436]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.298 --> 00:08:36.443]  Well, two million bikers have already begun to arrive in Washington, D.C.
[00:08:36.443 --> 00:08:37.805]  They were denied a permit.
[00:08:37.805 --> 00:08:50.254]  They have been given the permit in the past to have their 9-11 rides, but the new kleptocratic, openly anti-liberty crew that is in full control of D.C.
[00:08:50.254 --> 00:08:53.497]  is denying the First Amendment.
[00:08:53.497 --> 00:08:54.737]  So what did the bikers do?
[00:08:56.357 --> 00:09:00.499]  They responded, and they've been trying to get the permit for several months.
[00:09:00.499 --> 00:09:04.801]  They responded, and they're just now starting to arrive on the city edge.
[00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:07.843]  They've responded, two million of them, it's estimated.
[00:09:07.843 --> 00:09:19.149]  They have responded by saying, we're now going to take our time, and we're now going to stop at every red light, and we're now going to shut the city down, because that's exactly what
[00:09:20.475 --> 00:09:22.516]  The non-permitting has done.
[00:09:22.516 --> 00:09:24.056]  And of course, D.C.
[00:09:24.056 --> 00:09:26.377]  responded by saying, well, then you're not allowed to.
[00:09:26.377 --> 00:09:26.917]  Well, you know what?
[00:09:26.917 --> 00:09:30.478]  They've paid their little taxes for their privilege to travel.
[00:09:30.478 --> 00:09:31.778]  It's not really a privilege.
[00:09:31.778 --> 00:09:32.699]  It's a right.
[00:09:32.699 --> 00:09:37.520]  And so they're just going to be there, two million of them as individuals, and all the D.C.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:47.883]  workers and all the anti-gun people and all the folks that love tyranny so much in D.C., you're going to have the First Amendment exercised on you.
[00:09:47.883 --> 00:09:49.284]  And I have been to the third world.
[00:09:50.475 --> 00:09:56.878]  I've been to Central America, you name it, and I've never been treated like I've been treated every time I've been in D.C.
[00:09:56.878 --> 00:09:58.018]  by police.
[00:09:58.018 --> 00:10:01.780]  I've been there five times the last decade?
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.581]  No, no, more than that.
[00:10:04.581 --> 00:10:06.022]  Seven times.
[00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.622]  I've been to D.C.
[00:10:07.622 --> 00:10:13.465]  seven times in the last decade, and I have never seen
[00:10:14.741 --> 00:10:17.762]  The police act more abusive and arrogant and evil.
[00:10:17.762 --> 00:10:24.964]  Now, you go right outside in Virginia, places like Chantilly, super nice, super professional, and a lot of them are listeners.
[00:10:24.964 --> 00:10:27.604]  D.C., it's hellish.
[00:10:27.604 --> 00:10:36.227]  And I know we have some federal marshals that listen, and there's some people that Secret Service that aren't bad, but I mean, the average cops they've got out there, oh, and the security guards are even worse.
[00:10:36.227 --> 00:10:41.268]  I don't want to digress off into it, but I've been there with film crews, you name it, there is no permit in D.C.
[00:10:41.268 --> 00:10:41.588]  to film.
[00:10:42.796 --> 00:10:53.461]  You can be, because they know in the courts they can't make you, you can be 200 yards from the Washington Monument every time it's happened to us, and the police walk over and go, shut that down, you don't have a permit.
[00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:54.922]  There is no permit.
[00:10:54.922 --> 00:10:56.923]  It's the First Amendment, but the city doesn't offer them.
[00:10:56.923 --> 00:10:59.604]  Okay, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
[00:10:59.604 --> 00:11:02.985]  I'm going to tell you one more time.
[00:11:02.985 --> 00:11:03.886]  You stop filming.
[00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.231]  Or I'm going to put you in handcuffs right now.
[00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:09.894]  And you're like, well, I got stuff to do, but all right, you're violating my First Amendment.
[00:11:09.894 --> 00:11:11.635]  I'm going to show everybody this video.
[00:11:11.635 --> 00:11:12.335]  And we've shown you the videos.
[00:11:12.335 --> 00:11:15.998]  And they go, I don't care what you do!
[00:11:15.998 --> 00:11:16.859]  You know what?
[00:11:16.859 --> 00:11:18.060]  I'm thinking I'm going to just go ahead.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.983]  I mean, it is North Korea, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:21.983 --> 00:11:29.929]  And so what a beautiful thing to see two million patriots on the anniversary of 9-11
[00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:36.445]  Show up down there in defiance of this violation of the First Amendment.
[00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:37.686]  And we're going to be covering it today.
[00:11:37.686 --> 00:11:44.049]  We're going to be covering it top story in the aftermath on the nightly news tonight, seven o'clock central.
[00:11:44.049 --> 00:11:44.930]  This is a big deal.
[00:11:46.161 --> 00:11:54.183]  And the latest developments, the live video feeds, all of it, we're posting them right now to InfoWars.com for everybody so you can follow this.
[00:11:54.183 --> 00:11:57.104]  But it is certainly, certainly going to be interesting.
[00:11:57.104 --> 00:12:01.685]  They tried to have, back in the 70s, a farmer march with a bunch of tractors.
[00:12:01.685 --> 00:12:03.105]  And in that case, D.C.
[00:12:03.105 --> 00:12:04.386]  was able to shut most of it down.
[00:12:04.386 --> 00:12:05.786]  They climbed up in the cabs.
[00:12:06.874 --> 00:12:26.402]  There's famous TV footage on CBS News I've seen of this, and I've had some of the farmers that were part of it on the broadcast over the years, people like Gary Brownfield, now rest in peace, the police would climb up in the open, tractors, also the cabs, and punch the farmers right in the face or beat them with nightsticks.
[00:12:26.402 --> 00:12:31.684]  Because you're not going to allowed in America to go down a road you paid for.
[00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:35.306]  You're here to pay money to the government, sit down, and shut up.
[00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:40.317]  Just like on that HBO show about street prostitutes.
[00:12:40.317 --> 00:12:41.158]  I forget the name of it.
[00:12:41.158 --> 00:12:43.359]  We played the clip years ago.
[00:12:43.359 --> 00:12:46.541]  And the woman's been hit by a car and beat up and she's wrecked.
[00:12:46.541 --> 00:12:48.603]  She's got cigarette burns on her and everything else.
[00:12:48.603 --> 00:12:49.984]  And the pimp comes in.
[00:12:49.984 --> 00:12:51.284]  She goes, I'm gonna get up, baby.
[00:12:51.284 --> 00:12:54.887]  I'm gonna get up right now and get back out on the street for you right now.
[00:12:54.887 --> 00:13:00.170]  And the mother looks at the pimp and says, what have you done to my baby?
[00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:01.071]  What have you done to her?
[00:13:02.455 --> 00:13:05.578]  And she's like, I'm gonna get up, I'm gonna get back on the street for you, baby.
[00:13:05.578 --> 00:13:08.581]  I'm gonna do whatever you say, baby.
[00:13:08.581 --> 00:13:10.343]  And then they said, what do you pay your girls?
[00:13:10.343 --> 00:13:12.625]  And he goes, I pay them nothing.
[00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:16.289]  And they're lucky if I even give them some chicken once a day.
[00:13:16.289 --> 00:13:18.351]  A box of chicken.
[00:13:18.351 --> 00:13:19.953]  And that's the culture they want.
[00:13:19.953 --> 00:13:25.238]  They want us just totally broken, groveling with mass Stockholm syndrome.
[00:13:26.567 --> 00:13:30.988]  Just begging, begging, please give my kids more mercury shots and brain damage.
[00:13:30.988 --> 00:13:33.869]  Please give me more GMO, Bill Gates and Monsanto.
[00:13:33.869 --> 00:13:35.509]  Please give me more fluoride.
[00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:37.810]  Please give trillions more to foreign banks.
[00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.271]  Please teach the kindergartners like you do how to have sex.
[00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:44.111]  Please ruin everything.
[00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:46.272]  Please.
[00:13:46.272 --> 00:13:51.013]  Please have Miley Cyrus, you know, target nine-year-old girls.
[00:13:51.013 --> 00:13:52.613]  An adult looks at that and just laughs at it.
[00:13:52.613 --> 00:13:56.074]  But I mean, these are savage, miscreant scum.
[00:13:58.234 --> 00:14:02.215]  Who know exactly what they're doing.
[00:14:02.215 --> 00:14:05.116]  I mean, you sit there and you look at the art the globalists create.
[00:14:05.116 --> 00:14:07.637]  It's not just to wreck our minds and our psyches.
[00:14:07.637 --> 00:14:11.299]  They've been wrecked.
[00:14:11.299 --> 00:14:14.020]  They've been drinking out of their own cup, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.020]  And it is disgusting.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:22.723]  It's now time to call nationally and to support Congressman Walter Jones' legislation.
[00:14:22.723 --> 00:14:25.884]  It is now time, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:14:28.484 --> 00:14:32.605]  To get behind impeachment because Obama is trying to launch a war without Congress.
[00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:37.086]  Now, he knows that they're going to move for impeachment if he does that, but so he's trying to have it both ways.
[00:14:37.086 --> 00:14:39.587]  Well, I'm going to you, but if you don't, I can still do it.
[00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:42.188]  I'm trying to spin what the military action means and the rest of it.
[00:14:42.188 --> 00:14:51.170]  It's time to impeach him for Benghazi, for Fast and Furious, for the NSA, for targeting pro-lifers in the Tea Party, with the IRS.
[00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:56.252]  It's time to go after him for Obamacare, which is making most of the country go from 40 hours to 20.
[00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:01.032]  And is doubling the price of the premiums or more?
[00:15:01.032 --> 00:15:10.297]  I mean, America now is waking up and the stars are aligning for a massive accelerated awakening.
[00:15:10.297 --> 00:15:18.060]  But now is the time to be as most vocal as you can.
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:23.003]  You know, Ed Asner, who's frequent guest on the show, I'm gonna get him to pop back on the next few days.
[00:15:23.003 --> 00:15:27.125]  He talked to the Hollywood Reporter and then it got picked up by O'Reilly and others.
[00:15:28.573 --> 00:15:47.624]  And he said, look, in the article in the videos up on Infowars.com, he said, a lot of people in Hollywood do not want to criticize Obama because they don't want to be called racist.
[00:15:47.624 --> 00:15:51.667]  Because that's exactly how this works.
[00:15:51.667 --> 00:15:55.189]  That's exactly how the establishment operates.
[00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:56.270]  And they know
[00:15:57.301 --> 00:15:58.643]  You're not racist.
[00:15:58.643 --> 00:16:01.348]  They're the ones using race to program people.
[00:16:01.348 --> 00:16:03.391]  And I know everybody knows this.
[00:16:03.391 --> 00:16:10.062]  They're the ones that are openly
[00:16:12.822 --> 00:16:16.823]  Using it as just a weapon to scare you so that you'll shut up.
[00:16:16.823 --> 00:16:22.485]  But that's backfiring as well and is really the fall of political correctness with adults.
[00:16:22.485 --> 00:16:30.588]  The problem is they have captured audiences with children, people in college, people that work for government, where they say, no, Billy, you brought a brown bag to school.
[00:16:30.588 --> 00:16:32.409]  It's now starting in public schools.
[00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:33.649]  Did you know that was racist?
[00:16:33.649 --> 00:16:34.730]  We're going to write you up for that.
[00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.671]  There's no law, there's no regulation, there's nothing.
[00:16:37.671 --> 00:16:47.895]  It's a way to make you bad and persecute you and say you've done something and create just this insane schizophrenia, imagining racism everywhere it's not.
[00:16:47.895 --> 00:16:56.358]  Meanwhile, every day, there are articles of white people being shot or beaten to death as the person says they're killing them because they're white.
[00:16:57.904 --> 00:17:00.146]  And that is just regional news.
[00:17:00.146 --> 00:17:11.255]  And then I was talking to Man Cow this morning, I was on his show, and he talked about, he went to the richest area of Chicago, $3 million homes everywhere, $5 million homes, at 11 a.m.
[00:17:11.255 --> 00:17:12.897]  when Django Unchained came out.
[00:17:12.897 --> 00:17:16.560]  It was earlier this year, I guess.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:26.108]  And they were going in the theater, and they were there, and black folks told him, you better get out of here or we're gonna kill you.
[00:17:27.811 --> 00:17:30.113]  And Mancow was like, well, go ahead and do whatever you're going to do.
[00:17:30.113 --> 00:17:38.100]  But I mean, I mean, the point is, is that, is that this is getting insane because people go and they watch all this.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.924]  It's meant to rub salt in wounds and the whole George Zimmerman situation.
[00:17:43.997 --> 00:17:58.326]  And just all of it to create as much division as possible, because the globalists want to distract us from all the scandals, and the looting of the economy, and the shipping the jobs overseas, and the shutting down the power plants, and shipping General Motors into China, and all the rest of it.
[00:17:58.326 --> 00:18:03.729]  They are desperate to get us all fighting with each other and divert us.
[00:18:03.729 --> 00:18:07.051]  But why would they allow a million Muslim march in DC?
[00:18:08.263 --> 00:18:13.246]  And why would they allow previous motorcycle rallies in D.C.
[00:18:13.246 --> 00:18:14.327]  on the 9-11 anniversary?
[00:18:14.327 --> 00:18:15.647]  They haven't been in New York and D.C.
[00:18:15.647 --> 00:18:18.349]  the last 11 years they've had them.
[00:18:18.349 --> 00:18:20.810]  On the one-year anniversary, it just gets bigger and bigger.
[00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:25.073]  Why would they say, we're going to refuse your permit?
[00:18:25.073 --> 00:18:29.355]  Where they could easily get them through the city in an hour, get them out of there, limited problems.
[00:18:29.355 --> 00:18:33.678]  Why would they refuse and say, by the way, we better not see anybody, you know,
[00:18:34.898 --> 00:18:37.420]  We're gonna try to stop groups of people together.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:53.215]  So now you got mainly a bunch of combat veterans on motorcycles rolling in against the bizarre Soviet-style weirdo female police chief who wears like a Scientologist Admiral outfit.
[00:18:55.015 --> 00:18:55.756]  I don't know.
[00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:18.548]  Police, DC bikers, because I remember a few days ago I saw, they're like, well you better not, nope, it's unpermitted.
[00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:21.469]  We will, we will, we will, we will give citations.
[00:19:21.469 --> 00:19:25.291]  What are you going to do, start trying to give a million people, two million people citations?
[00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:26.592]  They're just going to start riding around you.
[00:19:26.592 --> 00:19:28.893]  What are you going to do, start tasering some people?
[00:19:28.893 --> 00:19:31.154]  You want to go ahead and just start a fight with two million veterans?
[00:19:31.154 --> 00:19:35.136]  This is how it's going to happen, just like Lexington and Concord.
[00:19:35.136 --> 00:19:38.138]  People are going to keep pushing and pushing and pushing.
[00:19:39.252 --> 00:19:45.134]  And then patriots are not going to take it anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:45.134 --> 00:19:51.757]  By the way, they started rolling out before dawn this morning from all over, converging from all over the East Coast on the District of Criminals.
[00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:58.199]  And this is symbolic of the defiance of Kim Jong-un, excuse me, Barack Obama.
[00:20:01.764 --> 00:20:03.365]  Time and time again.
[00:20:03.365 --> 00:20:06.306]  You need to come here and help us.
[00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:07.746]  We need assistance.
[00:20:07.746 --> 00:20:08.566]  Please!
[00:20:08.566 --> 00:20:12.148]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:20:12.148 --> 00:20:18.550]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.071]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[00:20:21.071 --> 00:20:24.652]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster.

[00:22:30.518 --> 00:22:34.999]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:34.999 --> 00:22:40.721]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[00:24:00.512 --> 00:24:06.293]  I hurt myself today
[00:24:19.372 --> 00:24:21.934]  I focus on the pain.
[00:24:34.813 --> 00:24:38.975]  The needle tears a hole.
[00:24:38.975 --> 00:24:40.235]  The old familiar sting.
[00:24:40.235 --> 00:24:41.656]  Try to kill it.
[00:24:41.656 --> 00:24:43.236]  All the way.
[00:24:43.236 --> 00:24:45.337]  But I remember everything.
[00:24:55.339 --> 00:24:56.401]  What have I become?
[00:24:56.401 --> 00:24:59.407]  What have I become?
[00:24:59.407 --> 00:25:02.312]  My sweetest friend.
[00:25:02.312 --> 00:25:04.256]  My sweetest friend.
[00:25:07.097 --> 00:25:14.242]  Everyone I know goes away in the end.
[00:25:14.242 --> 00:25:17.224]  You can have it all.
[00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:20.466]  And you could have it all.
[00:25:20.466 --> 00:25:22.107]  My empire of dirt.
[00:25:22.107 --> 00:25:25.670]  My empire of dirt.
[00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:26.871]  I will let you in.
[00:25:36.841 --> 00:25:40.123]  I will make you hurt.
[00:25:40.123 --> 00:25:43.764]  That's what the globalists do, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:43.764 --> 00:25:54.009]  They're the abusers, control freaks, the people that ought to be locked up instead of running our lives.
[00:25:59.349 --> 00:26:01.570]  Where should I begin today?
[00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:22.741]  Well, it is the anniversary of 9-11, 12 years later, and if the birth date of our Republic could be marked as 1776, or maybe Lexington and Concord, April 19th, 1775, maybe that's the inception was Lexington-Concord, and then the birth was 1776,
[00:26:25.672 --> 00:26:31.934]  And then we began to crawl in 1789.
[00:26:31.934 --> 00:26:40.397]  You can really mark the death date of our constitutional republic on September 11, 2001.
[00:26:40.397 --> 00:26:47.940]  But years are like seconds or minutes geopolitically in the history of the world.
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.281]  The eons that stretch back over thousands of years.
[00:26:52.901 --> 00:26:54.322]  And so we are on the gurney.
[00:26:54.322 --> 00:26:57.503]  Our heart is stopped.
[00:26:57.503 --> 00:27:03.065]  We are in cardiac arrest.
[00:27:03.065 --> 00:27:06.666]  And we've been dead a couple minutes.
[00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:08.087]  And our heart is dying.
[00:27:08.087 --> 00:27:10.848]  Our brain is dying.
[00:27:10.848 --> 00:27:15.029]  And if we don't defibrillate the heart soon, the heart tissue's gonna die.
[00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:19.311]  And even if they get the heart going again, in a day or two, the tissue's gonna die.
[00:27:20.339 --> 00:27:27.482]  And the whole heart's going to blow wide open like a rotten tomato.
[00:27:27.482 --> 00:27:29.884]  I want to get into graphics of how heart attacks work.
[00:27:29.884 --> 00:27:35.266]  They can get you going again, but a couple days later that heart blows open.
[00:27:35.266 --> 00:27:39.208]  And the longer we don't restart the heart, folks, the worse it's going to be.
[00:27:43.672 --> 00:27:46.413]  And tyrants always think they're invincible.
[00:27:46.413 --> 00:27:49.734]  Tyrants always get off on doing reckless things.
[00:27:49.734 --> 00:27:58.597]  And the collection of out-of-control Western powers that got power because compared to many other power structures, they were more moral.
[00:27:58.597 --> 00:28:01.098]  We had more soft power.
[00:28:01.098 --> 00:28:03.159]  And so the world would work with us more.
[00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:05.920]  We've lost all that soft power now.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.680]  And the world
[00:28:09.213 --> 00:28:11.514]  Absolutely despises and hates us.
[00:28:11.514 --> 00:28:16.636]  And we need to explain, hey, we've been decadent and let a corrupt power structure get in place.
[00:28:16.636 --> 00:28:19.977]  But this has not been done in our name and we don't like what's happening.
[00:28:19.977 --> 00:28:22.679]  And by the way, the world now sees that.
[00:28:22.679 --> 00:28:26.680]  They see 91% of Americans in the average poll against it.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.122]  They see us waking up and they think that's a good thing.
[00:28:30.122 --> 00:28:34.703]  And I'm seeing a lot of goodwill for Americans again across the world.
[00:28:34.703 --> 00:28:35.424]  And Obama
[00:28:36.621 --> 00:28:39.863]  And his administration are the heart that stopped.
[00:28:39.863 --> 00:28:43.484]  And there's going to be no defibrillating them.
[00:28:43.484 --> 00:28:45.825]  They can stage whatever they want to stage.
[00:28:45.825 --> 00:28:47.566]  They might get that heart going for a minute again.
[00:28:47.566 --> 00:28:50.367]  It's just going to blow aortas out.
[00:28:50.367 --> 00:28:53.429]  It's going to blow valves out.
[00:28:53.429 --> 00:28:56.110]  It's just, it's a rotten, it's a rotten heart.
[00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.911]  More rotten than the one they cut out of Dick Cheney.
[00:29:01.494 --> 00:29:06.136]  And nothing they sell is gonna work now, and they already know that with all their NSA spy grid.
[00:29:06.136 --> 00:29:08.618]  They know, and they haven't had the public for a long time.
[00:29:08.618 --> 00:29:10.819]  The public's just realizing that we're not alone now.
[00:29:10.819 --> 00:29:15.661]  It's their job to be up there on the nightly news and make you feel like you're alone, and, oh, he thinks the government's corrupt!
[00:29:15.661 --> 00:29:17.142]  He thinks the Federal Reserve's private!
[00:29:17.142 --> 00:29:17.822]  Ha ha ha!
[00:29:17.822 --> 00:29:20.524]  Now everybody knows it's private and goes, well, you lied to me.
[00:29:20.524 --> 00:29:23.165]  What else did you lie to me about?
[00:29:23.165 --> 00:29:24.486]  So the innocence is gone.
[00:29:27.682 --> 00:29:30.043]  I don't mean the innocence a child has that they want to get rid of.
[00:29:30.043 --> 00:29:33.405]  I mean the ignorance, the blinders are off in the American people.
[00:29:33.405 --> 00:29:36.486]  When we come back we'll give you the latest geopolitical news, give the number out and take your calls.
[00:29:36.486 --> 00:29:40.208]  But this is a big deal right now.
[00:29:40.208 --> 00:29:46.590]  Perhaps 9-11 will end up being the day the New World Order started dying instead of the day they killed the Republic.
[00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.191]  We will make that decision though.
[00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:49.772]  That destiny is in our hands.
[00:29:49.772 --> 00:29:51.133]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.133 --> 00:29:53.674]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.674 --> 00:29:56.335]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:10.079 --> 00:30:16.484]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.

[00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:18.830]  At least a while.
[00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.233]  I'm dying in your beds.
[00:33:21.233 --> 00:33:22.254]  Many years from now.
[00:33:23.612 --> 00:33:42.821]  Would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!
[00:33:42.821 --> 00:33:47.823]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:47.823 --> 00:33:49.324]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:56.087 --> 00:34:07.693]  That's right, rallying patriots who believe in families and believe in honor and duty and honesty and indecency and sovereignty.
[00:34:07.693 --> 00:34:12.075]  Individuals that recoil from corruption and gangs and thugism.
[00:34:13.439 --> 00:34:14.900]  We're here.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.121]  We're on the rise.
[00:34:16.121 --> 00:34:21.344]  We're taking America back and we're going to take the rest of the world back.
[00:34:21.344 --> 00:34:26.848]  1776, the spirit of resistance to tyranny worldwide, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:26.848 --> 00:34:33.332]  The toll free number to join us on Syria on 12 years later with the start of the Afghan War.
[00:34:35.035 --> 00:34:50.010]  And the thousands and thousands of dead troops and tens of thousands of dead Afghans and all the enmity and our government shipping 40 plus thousand Al Qaeda and Taliban out to safety in the airlift of evil that special forces officers went public over.
[00:34:51.812 --> 00:34:58.997]  Back then, I'd say, look, it's in the Times of London that our government took 40-plus thousand Al-Qaeda to safety and paid them in gold.
[00:34:58.997 --> 00:34:59.498]  See?
[00:34:59.498 --> 00:35:00.798]  They work for our government.
[00:35:00.798 --> 00:35:01.559]  See?
[00:35:01.559 --> 00:35:01.819]  See?
[00:35:01.819 --> 00:35:02.660]  Something's going on.
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:03.721]  Investigate.
[00:35:03.721 --> 00:35:03.981]  See?
[00:35:03.981 --> 00:35:05.422]  The hijackers trained at U.S.
[00:35:05.422 --> 00:35:06.202]  bases.
[00:35:06.202 --> 00:35:07.944]  The colonel over at the Defense Language School.
[00:35:08.704 --> 00:35:10.306]  Stephen Butler went public.
[00:35:10.306 --> 00:35:14.489]  Oh, now he's been court-martialed for national security.
[00:35:14.489 --> 00:35:15.610]  Or they're beginning a court-martial.
[00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:16.631]  I mean, wow!
[00:35:16.631 --> 00:35:18.293]  That's even an AP.
[00:35:18.293 --> 00:35:19.574]  You're a traitor!
[00:35:19.574 --> 00:35:21.716]  How dare you say our government did 9-11?
[00:35:21.716 --> 00:35:22.616]  It's not our government.
[00:35:22.616 --> 00:35:27.000]  It's criminal elements that run the government.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:27.761]  I mean, what do you think?
[00:35:27.761 --> 00:35:30.624]  They just started with Obama putting al-Qaeda in Syria?
[00:35:31.539 --> 00:35:32.820]  And Libya?
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.582]  And Egypt and everywhere else?
[00:35:34.582 --> 00:35:41.748]  It's Saudi Arabia is colonizing the entire Middle East with radical Wahhabists.
[00:35:41.748 --> 00:35:43.289]  And Israel's there helping?
[00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:46.032]  How dare you criticize Israel?
[00:35:46.032 --> 00:35:48.233]  I'm just reporting the facts here!
[00:35:49.136 --> 00:35:53.838]  I don't creamily, you know, with a glee, wade into all this.
[00:35:53.838 --> 00:35:59.239]  I want to unify people around liberty and freedom and family and everything wholesome.
[00:35:59.239 --> 00:36:07.242]  Not unify around, you know, I'm black, I'm white, you know, you're an Israeli, you're an Arab.
[00:36:07.242 --> 00:36:08.322]  That's barbarism.
[00:36:08.322 --> 00:36:10.003]  That's how they control us.
[00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:29.690]  But it's just amazing, oh, Ed Asner comes out, it's on Infowars.com, and says, Hollywood stars fear being labeled racist if they oppose Obama on Syria.
[00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:38.436]  Because that's what happens if you criticize him, and it doesn't matter.
[00:36:39.611 --> 00:36:40.891]  If it makes sense.
[00:36:40.891 --> 00:36:41.832]  It isn't meant to.
[00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:42.832]  It's a weapon.
[00:36:42.832 --> 00:36:45.613]  They're saying, we will blacklist you.
[00:36:45.613 --> 00:36:47.673]  We will say that word's racist.
[00:36:47.673 --> 00:36:49.834]  We will demonize you.
[00:36:49.834 --> 00:36:50.854]  You won't get a job.
[00:36:50.854 --> 00:36:53.315]  You won't work if you don't toe the line.
[00:36:53.315 --> 00:36:55.476]  It's authoritarianism.
[00:36:55.476 --> 00:37:03.878]  No, we're not going to give two million bikers a permit because that image is bad for Obama, but we will give it to a Muslim group.
[00:37:06.684 --> 00:37:07.805]  And you ask, why is that?
[00:37:07.805 --> 00:37:08.906]  Because it's a trade-off.
[00:37:08.906 --> 00:37:20.093]  They use radical Muslims as the excuse to take our rights, but they are running the radical Muslims and have a deal with them to turn the Middle East over to them if they play that game.
[00:37:20.093 --> 00:37:23.556]  But they've also got a deal at the top in England and here in the U.S.
[00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:35.164]  to absolutely let those radical elements not just take over Islam overseas, but control it here as well for, again, an even greater divide and conquer.
[00:37:37.108 --> 00:37:39.709]  They figured this out, ladies and gentlemen, how to control us.
[00:37:39.709 --> 00:37:47.631]  And it's time to be aware of the game, how it works, and realize it's so fun to be emotionally attached to all this.
[00:37:47.631 --> 00:37:49.432]  But in reality, we're being gamed.
[00:37:49.432 --> 00:37:53.973]  In reality, we're being manipulated.
[00:37:53.973 --> 00:37:54.954]  All right, here's the toll-free number.
[00:37:54.954 --> 00:37:55.774]  We're opening the phones up.
[00:37:55.774 --> 00:37:55.994]  It's 800-259-9231.
[00:37:55.994 --> 00:37:56.114]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:37:56.114 --> 00:37:58.735]  And please, if you're calling in, you're a regular caller,
[00:38:06.259 --> 00:38:08.562]  Let the first few round of callers be first-time callers.
[00:38:08.562 --> 00:38:09.343]  First-time callers 800-259-9231.
[00:38:09.343 --> 00:38:11.625]  Let's go over some of the international news here.
[00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:12.686]  Very important to do this.
[00:38:12.686 --> 00:38:16.470]  The 12-year war of US casualties
[00:38:28.621 --> 00:38:34.426]  In Afghanistan, they're up 73% since Obama got into command.
[00:38:34.426 --> 00:38:36.187]  That's CNS News.
[00:38:36.187 --> 00:38:42.873]  Infowars.com report, 12 years after 9-11, Obama helps revive Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:38:42.873 --> 00:38:45.375]  Yeah, that's a good Paul Watson article, but it's not even strong enough.
[00:38:47.219 --> 00:39:03.323]  When we come face-to-face with this parallel universe, bizarro world, where our government arms and equips giant brigades of Al-Qaeda to blow up churches and chop little children up and cut priest heads off and shoot nuns in the back, where is the Orthodox Church criticizing this?
[00:39:03.323 --> 00:39:05.104]  Well, they are.
[00:39:05.104 --> 00:39:06.984]  But it's not getting picked up in the U.S.
[00:39:06.984 --> 00:39:13.406]  news that the head of the Orthodox Church in Greece, the head of the Orthodox Church in Russia, the original Christian Church, one of the oldest branches,
[00:39:15.745 --> 00:39:16.885]  They are criticizing it.
[00:39:16.885 --> 00:39:21.007]  The Catholic Church has been criticizing the war and saying diplomacy is needed.
[00:39:21.007 --> 00:39:30.469]  But where is the Catholic Church denouncing the Al-Qaeda forces that are shooting Catholic priests and nuns in the back and chopping their heads off?
[00:39:30.469 --> 00:39:31.710]  Because that's going on.
[00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:34.171]  Those reports are coming out.
[00:39:34.171 --> 00:39:36.811]  I mean, imagine that.
[00:39:36.811 --> 00:39:39.652]  I mean, imagine that.
[00:39:39.652 --> 00:39:42.013]  Because it's political correctness, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:46.107 --> 00:39:59.197]  We went to war over babies that were not thrown out of incubators, but now you've got real people being killed, real sectarian attacks, financed by the West, and that ought to tell you what the establishment thinks of Christians.
[00:39:59.197 --> 00:40:03.480]  I'm telling you folks, because they don't like something being above the state.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:10.385]  And Christianity, real Christianity, the stuff is in the Bible, not what the different religious organizations put out.
[00:40:11.701 --> 00:40:15.182]  Is the antithesis of everything the New World Order is setting up.
[00:40:15.182 --> 00:40:17.223]  That's why the system hates it.
[00:40:17.223 --> 00:40:19.223]  Because there's power in there.
[00:40:19.223 --> 00:40:26.085]  Even if you don't believe in all the different dimensions and things that science has proven is there, but you can't see.
[00:40:26.085 --> 00:40:29.366]  We're basically blind in 99.9% of the universe.
[00:40:29.366 --> 00:40:30.727]  The dark matter, all of it.
[00:40:30.727 --> 00:40:32.647]  Oops, that's racist.
[00:40:32.647 --> 00:40:35.048]  I've now heard sugar cubes are racist because they're white.
[00:40:35.048 --> 00:40:35.608]  All-tots.
[00:40:35.608 --> 00:40:37.169]  I'm not kidding, by the way.
[00:40:37.169 --> 00:40:39.390]  This is the mass mental illness now.
[00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:40.710]  Where everything's racist.
[00:40:43.743 --> 00:40:46.566]  Except real racism.
[00:40:46.566 --> 00:40:48.007]  Who needs to have an intellectual argument?
[00:40:48.007 --> 00:40:49.989]  Just say it's racist!
[00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:51.030]  Okay, I'm sorry, it's racist.
[00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.733]  It's racist to not want to kill all the Christians.
[00:40:53.733 --> 00:41:00.059]  After all, Christians are all racist, didn't you know?
[00:41:00.059 --> 00:41:01.561]  And of course, I'm being nonsensical, folks.
[00:41:01.561 --> 00:41:02.422]  That's what's going on here.
[00:41:04.127 --> 00:41:11.716]  Continuing here with the Associated Press, this is the AP showing how much the establishment collapsed, how the people's confidence has collapsed.
[00:41:11.716 --> 00:41:13.479]  They are fact-checking Obama.
[00:41:13.479 --> 00:41:15.041]  They say Obama's Syria case
[00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:18.891]  Still lacks proof!
[00:41:18.891 --> 00:41:20.211]  Wow, what a word!
[00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:22.692]  Because, you know, you heard them say they had proof over and over again.
[00:41:22.692 --> 00:41:24.113]  That there was no doubt.
[00:41:24.113 --> 00:41:30.055]  In the same speech, Kerry then said, doesn't matter who used the chemicals, the fact is it was used.
[00:41:30.055 --> 00:41:33.096]  First Assad did it, but then they make the connection later.
[00:41:33.096 --> 00:41:34.916]  Just it being used is the proof.
[00:41:34.916 --> 00:41:42.239]  And Obama says, we've got to go in to secure those weapons by bombing them, which will then rain down on everybody in the region.
[00:41:44.295 --> 00:41:48.519]  But also, they've got to implode the country to keep it from imploding.
[00:41:48.519 --> 00:41:55.024]  Remember, well, there may have to be boots on the ground, Kerry said to the House and Senate Armed Services Committee.
[00:41:55.024 --> 00:41:57.406]  We may have to do that.
[00:41:57.406 --> 00:41:58.367]  We talked to so many committees.
[00:41:58.367 --> 00:42:03.211]  Maybe he was talking to the International Affairs.
[00:42:03.211 --> 00:42:04.152]  I forget.
[00:42:04.152 --> 00:42:05.873]  We played the clip last week.
[00:42:05.873 --> 00:42:07.935]  I get lost in the forest of factoids.
[00:42:07.935 --> 00:42:12.079]  And he said, well, we may need boots if the country implodes, heaven forbid.
[00:42:13.647 --> 00:42:14.788]  That's their entire goal.
[00:42:14.788 --> 00:42:15.288]  That's what I mean.
[00:42:15.288 --> 00:42:17.809]  It's just a wall of lies.
[00:42:17.809 --> 00:42:23.951]  And they just think this tsunami of fraud will just create an artificial environment of B.S.
[00:42:23.951 --> 00:42:27.713]  to where you just think B.S.
[00:42:27.713 --> 00:42:34.456]  grows on trees and it's just everywhere and that you accept it as your new artificial habitat.
[00:42:34.456 --> 00:42:35.976]  Well, I think they've jumped the shark.
[00:42:35.976 --> 00:42:36.817]  Here's the big news.
[00:42:36.817 --> 00:42:39.718]  Russia's carrier killer enters the Mediterranean.
[00:42:39.718 --> 00:42:41.859]  How do you pronounce that?
[00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:42.359]  Moskova?
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:44.200]  Moskva?
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.482]  That's the name of that ship?
[00:42:46.482 --> 00:42:47.442]  I pronounced it right?
[00:42:47.442 --> 00:42:48.883]  Wow!
[00:42:48.883 --> 00:42:50.084]  Mommy, wow!
[00:42:50.084 --> 00:42:51.845]  I'm a big kid now.
[00:42:51.845 --> 00:42:55.248]  I'm not too good at pronouncing things sometimes.
[00:42:55.248 --> 00:43:04.734]  The missile cruiser, dubbed the Carrier Killer by NATO, has passed through the Straits of Gibraltar and is now heading towards the eastern Mediterranean to assume command of Russian naval forces.
[00:43:06.971 --> 00:43:16.818]  I've been telling folks for two and a half years that Syria is meant to be the detonator for a larger regional war that the Rand Corporation five years ago called for.
[00:43:16.818 --> 00:43:20.421]  They said, we don't need to help get the New World Order around with just these small wars.
[00:43:20.421 --> 00:43:22.883]  We need biggins.
[00:43:22.883 --> 00:43:26.526]  And to lead the big war, a Peace Prize winner.
[00:43:26.526 --> 00:43:28.667]  That's globalist humor.
[00:43:28.667 --> 00:43:30.429]  Call the Patriot Act patriotic.
[00:43:30.429 --> 00:43:33.952]  Call the forced drugging kids.
[00:43:33.952 --> 00:43:35.693]  Written up by Big Pharma, call it new freedom.
[00:43:38.407 --> 00:43:48.210]  By the way, to talk about what an Orwellian state we're in, in the name of safety, getting rid of everybody's rights, I'll briefly tell the story and play an Obama clip and go to your calls.
[00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:50.090]  I like music that I like.
[00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:53.931]  I like famous people that I like because they're interesting artists or I admire them.
[00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:57.052]  I don't just like people because they're famous.
[00:43:57.052 --> 00:43:59.773]  And I'm not saying I'm some wonderful, virtuous person, but you know,
[00:44:00.987 --> 00:44:02.267]  That I don't like famous people.
[00:44:02.267 --> 00:44:04.588]  It's just that I've grown out of that by the time I was about 20.
[00:44:04.588 --> 00:44:06.329]  And I was never really into it.
[00:44:06.329 --> 00:44:14.412]  You know, I didn't pick up tabloids to read about the latest scandals.
[00:44:14.412 --> 00:44:16.673]  But I really like Dave Mustaine and his wife.
[00:44:16.673 --> 00:44:17.933]  I've known him for years.
[00:44:17.933 --> 00:44:19.634]  And he's a really sweet, smart guy.
[00:44:19.634 --> 00:44:23.695]  He has a lot of courage for what he's politically, you know, stood up for him and attacked.
[00:44:23.695 --> 00:44:29.298]  Because they really want to slap down famous entertainers and people so that they can intimidate others.
[00:44:29.298 --> 00:44:29.978]  And they tell people.
[00:44:30.916 --> 00:44:37.779]  Cross the board, music, film, you name it, you speak out against government, we're going to ruin your career.
[00:44:37.779 --> 00:44:39.780]  People are told this.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.622]  So I admire Dave, he's got a lot of courage.
[00:44:42.622 --> 00:44:51.786]  And so, obviously when they come to town they invite me out to the show, and so we went out to the big Formula One racetrack.
[00:44:51.786 --> 00:44:55.788]  I'd never been out there, and I'd driven by it before when the elite are being shuttled in by helicopter.
[00:44:56.621 --> 00:45:04.886]  Sometimes like a hundred helicopters in the air, bringing them back and forth from Austin out west, or out east to the Formula One track.
[00:45:04.886 --> 00:45:16.472]  So I go out there to the sold-out show, and we park, and then, oh, well, yeah, you go to Will Call to get your tickets they put up there for you.
[00:45:18.081 --> 00:45:21.102]  And then they go, no, you gotta go around to the VIP area.
[00:45:21.102 --> 00:45:21.722]  That's where they're waiting.
[00:45:21.722 --> 00:45:22.622]  That's where they lay the tick yarn.
[00:45:22.622 --> 00:45:24.342]  I said, no, I'm told to come here.
[00:45:24.342 --> 00:45:26.163]  They go, and told by who?
[00:45:26.163 --> 00:45:30.483]  And all these workers were just treating people so bad.
[00:45:30.483 --> 00:45:32.824]  And of course, I've been to other shows, and I gotta tell you, it's not been like this.
[00:45:32.824 --> 00:45:37.265]  It was like the spirit of the whole, you know, I mean, the crowd was great.
[00:45:37.265 --> 00:45:37.865]  The people were great.
[00:45:37.865 --> 00:45:40.925]  I couldn't believe how many InfoWars t-shirts I saw.
[00:45:40.925 --> 00:45:43.506]  Literally, I got mobbed, you know, doing autographs and pictures.
[00:45:43.506 --> 00:45:44.606]  It just was amazing.
[00:45:45.302 --> 00:45:48.183]  I mean, I was in the dark out there, you know, because I didn't want to stay backstage.
[00:45:48.183 --> 00:45:52.385]  I was, you know, watching Megadeth and then Iron Maiden.
[00:45:52.385 --> 00:45:57.186]  And I like, you know, heavy, hard, fast music.
[00:45:57.186 --> 00:46:00.087]  You know, grew up on it.
[00:46:00.087 --> 00:46:01.748]  Words can't describe it.
[00:46:01.748 --> 00:46:07.930]  The point is, is that I like being invited to those things, and I like it when it's at the W or something, a smaller venue, and I go in the back.
[00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:12.692]  This was amazing with the security people.
[00:46:14.696 --> 00:46:21.278]  Who were just looking for someone to mess with, and I watched them doing it to other people.
[00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:24.338]  Iron Maiden security people.
[00:46:24.338 --> 00:46:33.961]  And you're sitting there, walking backstage, you know, to walk back out front, and some big guy jumps out in front of you and wants to have a fight with you.
[00:46:33.961 --> 00:46:39.942]  And you're like, no, I'm just going out there, have my all-access pass, and they still get in your face like they want to fight you, and it's just so wimpy.
[00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:50.276]  You know, it's like, wow, this is the spirit of the New World Order, but that's not why I started telling the story on this 9-11 anniversary.
[00:46:50.276 --> 00:46:58.360]  I get sent around, so now they have to go get my tickets that were actually up front, and this place is the size of the Death Star or something.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.701]  I mean, this is a humongous facility.
[00:47:00.701 --> 00:47:03.083]  It's probably a half mile from the front to the back.
[00:47:04.096 --> 00:47:04.356]  I think?
[00:47:35.691 --> 00:47:37.853]  Looked like she could bench press 300 pounds.
[00:47:37.853 --> 00:47:41.376]  She didn't want to pat us down.
[00:47:41.376 --> 00:47:43.878]  She went right for the blonde.
[00:47:46.049 --> 00:47:46.429]  That we were
[00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:18.250]  And I just thought about what a weird country we are.
[00:48:43.956 --> 00:48:57.843]  That, I mean, obviously this woman has taken this job so they can just play God and they just completely ignore us.
[00:48:57.843 --> 00:48:59.283]  You can just walk right through.
[00:48:59.283 --> 00:49:02.285]  By the way, we were wearing more baggy shirts.
[00:49:02.285 --> 00:49:09.008]  Amy was wearing a tight shirt and pants and cowboy boots and we're just double-taped
[00:49:09.935 --> 00:49:11.676]  Why did they let us through and they're doing that to her?
[00:49:11.676 --> 00:49:12.777]  Well, I mean, it was insane.
[00:49:12.777 --> 00:49:16.980]  And then we sat back and watched as more attractive women came up.
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:17.880]  I've seen this with the TSA.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.782]  What do you think happened?
[00:49:19.782 --> 00:49:21.443]  Imagine that's the security.
[00:49:21.443 --> 00:49:25.386]  You give someone a slot where they can dominate and have power over people.
[00:49:25.386 --> 00:49:29.108]  And my instinct is I'm trying to walk down and go out front.
[00:49:29.108 --> 00:49:30.769]  This is where they showed us to go before.
[00:49:30.769 --> 00:49:32.210]  We have an all access pass.
[00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:35.553]  And some guy jumps out in front of me, goes, goes, you can't come out here.
[00:49:35.553 --> 00:49:36.974]  And he goes, I don't care what that says.
[00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:38.775]  I'm like, OK, well, I'm just trying to follow
[00:49:40.353 --> 00:49:42.036]  You know, Pam Mustaine right down through here.
[00:49:42.036 --> 00:49:42.838]  I'm like, okay.
[00:49:42.838 --> 00:49:43.659]  I go, well, where's the other way?
[00:49:43.659 --> 00:49:44.861]  And he goes, I'm not going to tell you that.
[00:49:45.598 --> 00:49:53.083]  And every instinct in me, and believe me folks, I've been in fights with people that weigh 300 pounds and can bench press like 500 pounds, and I'd stomp their head in the ground.
[00:49:53.083 --> 00:49:56.265]  I can only get excited when some big guy gets in my face.
[00:49:56.265 --> 00:49:58.466]  But I'm almost 40 years old, I had to control myself.
[00:49:58.466 --> 00:50:01.248]  I was like, yes sir, thank you, and he got off on that.
[00:50:01.248 --> 00:50:05.310]  And I could only control myself by realizing how pathetic and weak he was.
[00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:08.752]  But I officially cannot go to any football games.
[00:50:08.752 --> 00:50:10.253]  I can't go to the Kite Festival, they have U.S.
[00:50:10.253 --> 00:50:12.134]  Army out there doing that now.
[00:50:12.134 --> 00:50:14.336]  I'm literally, I'm living in a giant concentration camp.
[00:50:15.996 --> 00:50:24.960]  I'm living in a giant concentration camp and the jobs in America now are for every control freak to push people around and boss them around and get in their face.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:28.402]  And the epicenter of it is North Korea.
[00:50:28.402 --> 00:50:31.383]  Pyongyang, or however you pronounce it.
[00:50:31.383 --> 00:50:34.705]  Pyongyang, Washington D.C.
[00:50:34.705 --> 00:50:37.146]  Pyongyang on the Potomac.
[00:50:37.146 --> 00:50:44.970]  Where they tell veterans, you can't come have a march you've had every year for 11 years, but we're going to let other people do it.
[00:50:45.731 --> 00:50:46.091]  And you know what?
[00:50:46.091 --> 00:50:47.473]  We're just done.
[00:50:47.473 --> 00:50:50.555]  But the problem is I can't avoid public places, folks.
[00:50:50.555 --> 00:50:52.137]  They're going to be everywhere now.
[00:50:52.137 --> 00:50:53.939]  It's shopping malls, you name it.
[00:50:53.939 --> 00:50:56.181]  And I have a lot of trouble dealing with it.
[00:50:56.181 --> 00:50:57.562]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[00:50:57.562 --> 00:50:58.062]  Stay with us.

[00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:04.939]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:52:04.939 --> 00:52:08.060]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:13.602]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:52:13.602 --> 00:52:15.562]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:52:15.562 --> 00:52:17.183]  We are what we eat.
[00:52:17.183 --> 00:52:21.865]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:52:21.865 --> 00:52:26.086]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:52:26.086 --> 00:52:28.347]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:52:28.627 --> 00:52:34.872]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:50.645]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you, and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired, and obese.
[00:52:50.985 --> 00:52:52.967]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[00:52:52.967 --> 00:52:53.908]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[00:52:53.908 --> 00:52:54.848]  Police call it robbery.
[00:53:13.556 --> 00:53:15.438]  We call it avoidable.
[00:53:15.438 --> 00:53:21.484]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[00:53:21.484 --> 00:53:26.889]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[00:53:26.889 --> 00:53:32.915]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[00:53:34.116 --> 00:53:41.164]  At only $29.95, Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.
[00:53:41.164 --> 00:53:45.468]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to Faketv.com.

[00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:48.551]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:54:18.786 --> 00:54:29.131]  I didn't mean to go off on a jag about police state America and how we're all being trained to be prisoners and how we're all being trained that we're cattle.
[00:54:29.131 --> 00:54:36.794]  Everything is about you're a number, you're scum, you're trash and the new super classes are anybody in the bureaucracy, anybody in a uniform.
[00:54:36.794 --> 00:54:40.236]  That's why you see every profession now is putting people in uniforms.
[00:54:40.236 --> 00:54:42.777]  It's like cult world or something.
[00:54:42.777 --> 00:54:45.178]  And just to run the gauntlet
[00:54:46.607 --> 00:54:48.648]  It's not that Iran's good guys here.
[00:55:05.686 --> 00:55:20.072]  It's just that the West is starting the war that is going to bring Iran into it, and then that will be a big political diversion for the globalists who can loot the bank accounts and raise the taxes and get everybody in line during a war.
[00:55:20.072 --> 00:55:25.615]  That's the type of news that we've got here that's so important.
[00:55:25.615 --> 00:55:32.978]  We also have popping in for like 15 minutes, I'm going to have them short interviews, Paul Craig Roberts on the state of the world and the collapse of
[00:55:33.902 --> 00:55:36.485]  The Western establishment that he believes is starting to happen.
[00:55:36.485 --> 00:55:52.160]  In fact, will you guys print me that New York Observer article from a couple days ago where that other analyst was calling it, you know, likening what's happened with Obama to the fall of the Soviet Union, which is directly what we've been saying.
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.221]  I don't just say that.
[00:55:53.221 --> 00:55:54.222]  That's where this is leading.
[00:55:55.373 --> 00:55:55.853]  I'm appalled, Alex.
[00:55:55.853 --> 00:55:56.454]  Can you hear me?
[00:56:19.383 --> 00:56:20.503]  Yeah, nice to talk to you boss.
[00:56:20.503 --> 00:56:22.424]  First time caller, long time listener.
[00:56:22.424 --> 00:56:40.232]  I was just reading on the website today on the WCDB ABC Boston app, Carlos Arredondo on Wednesday received an award named for Madeline Ame, Fleet Week Flight Attendant, on the first of the hijacked Logan Airport planes flowing into the World Trade Center.
[00:56:41.444 --> 00:56:52.028]  Evidently they've given him an award and Jeffrey Bauman was there to embrace him as he was presented the award in the Massachusetts Statehouse.
[00:56:52.028 --> 00:56:52.468]  I don't know.
[00:56:52.468 --> 00:56:56.050]  This whole thing is making me incredibly sick.
[00:56:56.050 --> 00:57:00.751]  False Flag Anniversary is honoring these actors and these false narratives.
[00:57:00.751 --> 00:57:05.033]  I just wondered how long it's going to go on and people are going to buy into it.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:21.784]  Well, it is true they've been caught in Syria, and they've been caught in Iran, the West has, and they've been caught in Egypt staging fake shootings with fake blood and stuff of demonstrators.
[00:57:21.784 --> 00:57:25.065]  I mean, our government has been caught coordinating fake stuff overseas.
[00:57:25.065 --> 00:57:29.426]  They admit they're engaged in fake domestic psyops that have been illegal.
[00:57:29.426 --> 00:57:34.187]  So, yes, a lot of this stuff is fake, but they'll also a lot of times kill some real people.
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:41.201]  See, folks think it's all fake at the Boston bombing, or it's all fake at Sandy Hook.
[00:57:41.201 --> 00:57:46.722]  And what we've got is, is that they kill some real people, because they like doing that, and that's real.
[00:57:46.722 --> 00:57:52.583]  Then they'll have some other actors there to push the narrative and say what they want said minute one.
[00:57:52.583 --> 00:58:01.585]  That's why they had a drill of a bombing minutes before, right there at the finish line, and it turns out they did have crisis actor groups hired.
[00:58:01.585 --> 00:58:02.405]  That's been confirmed.
[00:58:03.682 --> 00:58:04.983]  I don't think so.
[00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:26.432]  And no holes or blood, and then a minute later, when they've dolled him up, now suddenly blood everywhere.
[00:58:26.432 --> 00:58:28.072]  I mean, it looks real bad.
[00:58:28.072 --> 00:58:28.973]  It looks real bad.
[00:58:28.973 --> 00:58:34.654]  I don't know... It's like on 9-11, they had guys popping up, giving the official story minutes after.
[00:58:34.654 --> 00:58:36.715]  Clearly scripted.
[00:58:36.715 --> 00:58:38.415]  They had their scripting all across the news.
[00:58:38.415 --> 00:58:47.118]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.689 --> 00:58:54.250]  Every three seconds, someone becomes a victim of identity theft.
[00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:58.391]  We also hear news stories every day about the NSA spying on U.S.
[00:58:58.391 --> 00:58:59.171]  citizens.

[00:59:55.869 --> 00:59:58.634]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.253 --> 01:00:10.078]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.078 --> 01:00:11.679]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.679 --> 01:00:13.221]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.221 --> 01:00:17.425]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.425 --> 01:00:21.509]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.132 --> 01:00:40.560]  Alright, we're opening the phones up during this hour and the next to talk about the state of the world.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:50.428]  It was Conrad Black of the New York Sun that said the collapse of American influence recalls disintegration of the Soviet Union.
[01:00:50.428 --> 01:00:53.691]  And that is exactly what Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has been likening it to.
[01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:55.612]  That's what we've been likening it to.
[01:00:55.612 --> 01:00:56.333]  This is a big deal.
[01:00:57.332 --> 01:00:58.973]  This is a very, very big deal.
[01:00:58.973 --> 01:01:02.656]  Dr. Paul K. Roberts is going to pop in for about 15 minutes to give us his take on that.
[01:01:02.656 --> 01:01:04.657]  And then we're going to continue with your calls.
[01:01:04.657 --> 01:01:06.619]  But right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:01:06.619 --> 01:01:10.482]  We'll also be analyzing Obama's speech about America doesn't do pinpricks.
[01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:14.962]  And the psychology there is, don't worry, don't you want to smash something in the old days?
[01:01:14.962 --> 01:01:20.124]  CNN's trotting out there, analysts, look, here's the ships, here's the graphics, here's how the missiles work.
[01:01:20.124 --> 01:01:21.825]  Don't you want to see the missiles work?
[01:01:21.825 --> 01:01:23.306]  It's like a video game.
[01:01:23.306 --> 01:01:26.067]  Remember in 1990 how we sold you?
[01:01:26.067 --> 01:01:30.048]  What, now you realize that we represent the same global elite robbing you?
[01:01:30.048 --> 01:01:31.029]  Now it's not fun?
[01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:35.651]  You mean, we conned you for a while, but now you're waking up to your morals?
[01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:37.271]  No, no, don't do that, it's fun!
[01:01:37.271 --> 01:01:38.852]  Let's talk about this like we're discussing
[01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:43.441]  A picnic or going to see a football game or something.
[01:01:43.441 --> 01:01:44.862]  I mean, I watch CNN especially.
[01:01:44.862 --> 01:01:46.843]  It's so sickening.
[01:01:46.843 --> 01:01:50.325]  But it's okay because it's a liberal war.
[01:01:50.325 --> 01:01:52.726]  Meanwhile, more Russian ships are arriving.
[01:01:52.726 --> 01:01:56.768]  One known as the Carrier Killer, loaded with anti-ship missiles.
[01:01:56.768 --> 01:01:59.410]  Supersonic missiles.
[01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:01.851]  Supersonic, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:04.533]  Reminds me of that song from the late 80s.
[01:02:04.533 --> 01:02:05.373]  Supersonic.
[01:02:05.373 --> 01:02:06.354]  Remember that one?
[01:02:07.233 --> 01:02:09.135]  I like that kind of music.
[01:02:09.135 --> 01:02:14.500]  Let's go ahead and talk to, uh, who was it?
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.442]  JJ Fad, yeah.
[01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:19.886]  I mean, it's mindless brain cotton candy, but so what.
[01:02:19.886 --> 01:02:24.370]  Paul Revere in California, as the governor says.
[01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:25.612]  You're on the air.
[01:02:25.612 --> 01:02:26.693]  How you doing today, Paul?
[01:02:27.915 --> 01:02:29.155]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:29.155 --> 01:02:35.298]  From one Paul Revere to another Paul Revere, I'd like to thank you very much for the awakening, the grand awakening you have given us.
[01:02:35.298 --> 01:02:39.559]  So much not about a very good Schwarzenegger, because then it's segued into a British accent, but yeah.
[01:02:39.559 --> 01:02:40.760]  Maybe an Imperial.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.060]  Don't get upset.
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.321]  Paul Revere was a racist.
[01:02:44.321 --> 01:02:45.161]  That's it.
[01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.722]  Don't talk like that.
[01:02:46.722 --> 01:02:48.982]  Take some Prozac there.
[01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:50.583]  Drink some fluoride.
[01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:52.264]  You're getting sleepy.
[01:02:53.564 --> 01:02:56.266]  You're getting sleepy.
[01:02:56.266 --> 01:02:57.186]  Go ahead.
[01:02:57.186 --> 01:02:57.747]  I'm sorry.
[01:02:57.747 --> 01:03:00.569]  I'm gonna not be rude and stutter or stammer.
[01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:01.890]  Paul Revere, you're on the air.
[01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:02.730]  Go ahead.
[01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:07.053]  Welcome to NPR, state-funded media, brought to you by David Rockefeller.
[01:03:07.053 --> 01:03:08.474]  Go ahead.
[01:03:08.474 --> 01:03:13.097]  Well, Alex, I was just wondering if you could maybe put some more fluoride in the water because
[01:03:13.604 --> 01:03:21.527]  People here in California don't seem to be asleep enough with those new gun bills on the governor's desk today.
[01:03:21.527 --> 01:03:27.429]  You know, I think what we need to do is we need to have more vaccinations, more fluoride in the water.
[01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:32.771]  Well, it's worked so good disarming everyone in Chicago and New York and D.C.
[01:03:32.771 --> 01:03:34.452]  with the highest crime rates.
[01:03:34.452 --> 01:03:36.713]  Why not do more?
[01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:39.894]  Yes, well, Alex, I was listening to your analysis and breakdown of
[01:03:40.325 --> 01:03:48.953]  The people of Los Angeles the other day on the radio, and I found it fascinating that you would be so spot on with the amount of vampires that are here.
[01:03:48.953 --> 01:03:52.236]  Why do you have to call us vampires, Alex?
[01:03:52.236 --> 01:03:54.798]  We're out for freedom.
[01:03:54.798 --> 01:03:56.319]  We just do as we say.
[01:03:56.319 --> 01:04:00.323]  You don't need to worry about the man behind the curtain.
[01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:02.978]  That's right.
[01:04:02.978 --> 01:04:03.819]  That's right.
[01:04:03.819 --> 01:04:05.120]  Oh, come to me, child.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.981]  I have candy and a puppy.
[01:04:06.981 --> 01:04:08.022]  The government loves you.
[01:04:08.022 --> 01:04:09.163]  Obama cares.
[01:04:09.163 --> 01:04:11.564]  Don't be racist.
[01:04:11.564 --> 01:04:12.185]  Cancer.
[01:04:12.185 --> 01:04:13.466]  Cancer and sweets.
[01:04:13.466 --> 01:04:14.607]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:04:14.607 --> 01:04:16.248]  Step into my car.
[01:04:16.248 --> 01:04:16.668]  Don't worry.
[01:04:16.668 --> 01:04:18.550]  Take some shots.
[01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:21.091]  We love you.
[01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:23.213]  Oh, man.
[01:04:23.213 --> 01:04:24.974]  What a world we're living in.
[01:04:24.974 --> 01:04:26.075]  What a world we're living in.
[01:04:26.075 --> 01:04:27.336]  But, you know, there is hope.
[01:04:27.336 --> 01:04:28.197]  I do believe.
[01:04:29.039 --> 01:04:30.741]  Oh, you aren't doing a British accent.
[01:04:30.741 --> 01:04:32.924]  You really are from the UK.
[01:04:32.924 --> 01:04:34.946]  Well, I'm from that part of the world.
[01:04:34.946 --> 01:04:39.832]  I won't, I won't, for obfuscate, I won't say, I won't, um, I won't give out my true identity.
[01:04:39.832 --> 01:04:43.136]  No, no, but it sounds like you've been here for, well, you've been here about 20 years though, right?
[01:04:43.877 --> 01:04:45.138]  Yeah, I've been here for 20 years.
[01:04:45.138 --> 01:04:47.019]  You're absolutely spot on.
[01:04:47.019 --> 01:04:48.000]  I can hear your voice.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.002]  We're going to come right back to you.
[01:04:50.002 --> 01:04:51.683]  Stay there, Paul Revere.
[01:04:51.683 --> 01:04:55.986]  Obviously on 9-11 we're going to have Paul Revere for more than... That's a caller right there.
[01:04:55.986 --> 01:04:59.008]  And then John, Cynthia, Matthew, Tracy.
[01:04:59.008 --> 01:04:59.569]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.953 --> 01:05:06.458]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[01:05:06.458 --> 01:05:10.281]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:13.704]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[01:05:13.704 --> 01:05:17.147]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[01:05:17.147 --> 01:05:23.773]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[01:05:23.773 --> 01:05:27.216]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[01:05:27.836 --> 01:05:39.247]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[01:05:39.247 --> 01:05:44.753]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[01:05:44.753 --> 01:05:50.198]  To find out more information on how supernatural silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens,
[01:05:50.478 --> 01:05:52.863]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com.
[01:05:52.863 --> 01:05:55.588]  That's SupernaturalSilver.com.

[01:06:00.496 --> 01:06:04.378]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:09.880]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:17.623]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:06:17.623 --> 01:06:26.726]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:06:26.926 --> 01:06:34.094]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:06:34.094 --> 01:06:36.997]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:06:36.997 --> 01:06:42.923]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[01:06:43.504 --> 01:06:44.204]  A war.
[01:06:44.204 --> 01:06:45.465]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:06:45.465 --> 01:06:46.845]  Another plane just hit!
[01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:02.171]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:07:02.171 --> 01:07:05.814]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:07:05.814 --> 01:07:10.378]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:07:10.378 --> 01:07:16.463]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:07:16.463 --> 01:07:27.252]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[01:07:27.452 --> 01:07:33.934]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:07:33.934 --> 01:07:50.878]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:07:51.238 --> 01:07:56.563]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at infowarestore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:11.831]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.831 --> 01:08:13.371]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.371 --> 01:08:17.574]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.574 --> 01:08:21.636]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:37.884 --> 01:08:39.024]  Hi, everybody.
[01:08:39.024 --> 01:08:48.748]  You're tuned in to National Public Radio, funded with taxpayer money and also big billionaire generational wealth families.
[01:08:48.748 --> 01:08:49.309]  Hi.
[01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:56.271]  You know, there's two million bikers, veterans, that think they're allowed to bike through D.C., but they were told they're not allowed to.
[01:08:56.271 --> 01:08:59.553]  And something really naughty happened today.
[01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:02.314]  Something really naughty and bad.
[01:09:02.314 --> 01:09:08.838]  They said they were going to go ahead and do it and so we're going to be covering these extremists today.
[01:09:08.838 --> 01:09:15.562]  You've noticed the Homeland Security warnings saying veterans the number one terror threat.
[01:09:15.562 --> 01:09:18.763]  Well now you see, now you see how truthful that is.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:24.803]  Everybody take vaccines, drink fluoride, and turn in your firearms today.
[01:09:24.803 --> 01:09:27.165]  Remember how scary 9-11 was?
[01:09:27.165 --> 01:09:32.108]  Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll protect you, everything, mmkay?
[01:09:32.108 --> 01:09:38.412]  Let us just take all those rights away, and let us set up this technological system to keep you safe, mmkay?
[01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:47.640]  I think more and more I should combine NPR with the South Park Teacher Voice and the Toilet Safety Police.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:50.783]  You know, America is turning into the Toilet Safety Police everywhere you go.
[01:09:51.533 --> 01:10:06.141]  Here, I'm a minimum wage criminal TSA agent with felony backgrounds, or I'm a defrocked priest, and so now I, well, I take specific interest, well, in, guess what?
[01:10:06.141 --> 01:10:17.967]  I mean, it is amazing what we put up with, and we see our world being designed and set up to provide places of power for parasites and miscreant control freaks
[01:10:18.467 --> 01:10:20.668]  Who revel in manipulating our lives.
[01:10:20.668 --> 01:10:21.988]  Paul Revere in California.
[01:10:21.988 --> 01:10:23.669]  I held you over in the last segment.
[01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:31.111]  You wanted to talk about solutions on the 12 year anniversary of the date the globalists believe destroyed the republic.
[01:10:31.111 --> 01:10:38.973]  But I believe they jumped the shark and that now false flag is part of the popular nomenclature and that it is now backfiring on them.
[01:10:38.973 --> 01:10:41.674]  But time will tell.
[01:10:41.674 --> 01:10:43.755]  But go ahead Paul Revere with your comments.
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:57.264]  Yes, Alex, so you mentioned at the beginning of the broadcast how you thought that it was actually more like our Lexington moment, 9-11, and of course there's a Paul Revere fanatic.
[01:10:57.264 --> 01:11:11.488]  When Dr. Joseph Warren and myself got together and started to wake up the hillsides around Acton, Concord, Lexington, we were without Facebook, without Twitter, without telephones, texting.
[01:11:12.775 --> 01:11:16.980]  And you were also a terrorist extremist.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:17.821]  Maybe this is how we do the show now.
[01:11:17.821 --> 01:11:19.663]  If you call in, you have to talk in an NPR voice.
[01:11:27.808 --> 01:11:35.230]  Okay, Alex, well by the way, Alex, we're starting to... We run your life, we're your racists, we tell you what to do, or we'll say you're guilty.
[01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:40.452]  But if you do what we say, we'll pat you on the head while taking your wallet.
[01:11:40.452 --> 01:11:43.013]  Oh, I'm really a liberal trendy, I'm not a high tech...
[01:11:44.076 --> 01:11:46.557]  You know, advertisement warfare system!
[01:11:46.557 --> 01:11:47.198]  Oh, hi!
[01:11:47.198 --> 01:11:49.859]  Never mind the drones and the men in black uniforms!
[01:11:49.859 --> 01:11:50.960]  We're liberal!
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.481]  Oh, it's non-threatening!
[01:11:52.481 --> 01:12:07.230]  I'm telling you, if the Nazis would have wore pink uniforms and said you were racist if you didn't report to a sand-ditch to be shot in the head... If Hitler showed up today and said, kill yourself if you're racist, the average American would take a double-edged dagger and ram it into his throat!
[01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:08.590]  His blood spur... Ow!
[01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:10.131]  I don't want to be racist, Hitler!
[01:12:10.131 --> 01:12:10.712]  I'm telling you!
[01:12:11.331 --> 01:12:11.911]  I'm telling you.
[01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:19.453]  I mean, I'm convinced you could probably walk up to women now in grocery stores and say, if you don't come home with me and have sex with me, you're a racist.
[01:12:19.453 --> 01:12:23.414]  And I think liberal women would say, let's go right now.
[01:12:23.414 --> 01:12:27.315]  OK, well, I'm going to bash your brains out, you're racist.
[01:12:27.315 --> 01:12:27.615]  Good.
[01:12:27.615 --> 01:12:28.575]  It's a ball peen hammer.
[01:12:28.575 --> 01:12:29.236]  Bang, bang.
[01:12:29.236 --> 01:12:29.976]  Like, I'm sorry.
[01:12:29.976 --> 01:12:34.537]  It's like we're beating ourselves over the head with a bunch of miscreant control freaks.
[01:12:34.537 --> 01:12:35.437]  I'm sorry, Paul Revere.
[01:12:35.437 --> 01:12:36.857]  Finish your point, extremist.
[01:12:36.857 --> 01:12:38.798]  Just talking to a racist like you freaks me out.
[01:12:40.069 --> 01:12:41.210]  Well, don't be a freak.
[01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:43.893]  By the way, those extremists in Washington, D.C.
[01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:45.354]  You know what the answer is, Alex.
[01:12:45.354 --> 01:12:47.316]  We need to ban bicycles.
[01:12:47.316 --> 01:12:50.339]  Especially bicycles over 10 speeds.
[01:12:50.339 --> 01:12:53.221]  Well, you can't trust a citizen with a big motorcycle.
[01:12:53.221 --> 01:12:55.604]  I mean, you might do something bad.
[01:12:55.604 --> 01:12:56.565]  You saw them.
[01:12:56.565 --> 01:12:57.726]  They defied the order.
[01:12:58.206 --> 01:13:02.448]  So we're going to have to ban all motorcycles, like the clown that made fun of Obama.
[01:13:02.448 --> 01:13:05.889]  Now all the clowns have to pay hundreds of dollars for sensitivity training.
[01:13:05.889 --> 01:13:07.030]  They're all guilty.
[01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:14.553]  Everyone that has a motorcycle needs to be given a ticket now for defying the incredible... Can we see the wonderful D.C.
[01:13:14.553 --> 01:13:15.813]  Police Chief?
[01:13:15.813 --> 01:13:18.735]  Can we see... Can we see Janet Reno's friend?
[01:13:18.735 --> 01:13:23.116]  I mean... I'm sorry, racist.
[01:13:23.116 --> 01:13:24.077]  What else was that, Paul?
[01:13:25.805 --> 01:13:32.186]  Well, like I said, we were able to wake up 14,000 people by the end of April 20th, 1775.
[01:13:32.186 --> 01:13:36.207]  See, those people hadn't been drinking fluoride all day.
[01:13:36.207 --> 01:13:39.167]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:13:39.167 --> 01:13:46.149]  Those were men that, when someone who were nice and loving to their families, but if you tried to push them around, they couldn't back down because they were men.
[01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:53.130]  It's not normal to just keep backing down, but this whole world is about teaching us to back down, and I'm done doing it!
[01:13:54.824 --> 01:13:57.245]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:13:57.245 --> 01:14:03.549]  Well, there was a famous quote by Captain Levi Preston when he was ousted years later.
[01:14:03.549 --> 01:14:14.194]  And he said, the fact why we went to war is that they meant, they did not want us to govern ourselves, and we were always meant to.
[01:14:14.194 --> 01:14:20.518]  And, you know... Hi, I'm with the GSA, your wife's lovely, gonna have to check her panties.
[01:14:21.365 --> 01:14:24.039]  I'm sorry, we had Janet Napolitano pop in for a minute on the show.
[01:14:24.039 --> 01:14:24.703]  I'm sorry, go ahead sir.
[01:14:26.015 --> 01:14:26.616]  Oh, dear.
[01:14:26.616 --> 01:14:27.076]  Oh, dear.
[01:14:27.076 --> 01:14:27.456]  Oh, dear.
[01:14:27.456 --> 01:14:29.177]  Well, you know, get involved.
[01:14:29.177 --> 01:14:31.939]  Um, I have a member of the... Well, Bin Laden might be hiding in there.
[01:14:31.939 --> 01:14:34.521]  Wait, you actually run Al-Qaeda, though.
[01:14:34.521 --> 01:14:35.761]  Never mind that.
[01:14:35.761 --> 01:14:36.602]  Never mind that.
[01:14:36.602 --> 01:14:40.744]  Gotta check your baby's diaper for a bomb.
[01:14:40.744 --> 01:14:43.066]  Sorry, go ahead, sir.
[01:14:43.066 --> 01:14:47.489]  Well, I belong to a group that we teach marksmanship and heritage.
[01:14:47.489 --> 01:14:49.170]  They're called the Apple Seed Project.
[01:14:49.170 --> 01:14:50.951]  I know that you've had scouts on the show.
[01:14:50.951 --> 01:14:51.531]  Racist!
[01:14:51.531 --> 01:14:52.552]  Racist!
[01:14:53.965 --> 01:14:55.707]  We teach Marksmanship and Heritage.
[01:14:55.707 --> 01:15:01.875]  I'd encourage everyone of you to get involved because that's one way that I'm changing the country.
[01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:02.677]  Well that's right!
[01:15:02.677 --> 01:15:04.599]  We should start a project!
[01:15:04.599 --> 01:15:05.941]  I'm not gonna say the name before somebody grabs it.
[01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:10.786]  I have an idea.
[01:15:10.786 --> 01:15:12.727]  I'll tell you as soon as we get the domain.
[01:15:12.727 --> 01:15:16.948]  And I promise I've had so many good ideas, I have to read over like the 300 I've bought, like a madman.
[01:15:16.948 --> 01:15:20.450]  No wonder I'm broke half the time.
[01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:23.111]  People collect stamps, they collect domain names and never use them.
[01:15:23.111 --> 01:15:24.371]  Thank you so much, Paul Revere.
[01:15:24.371 --> 01:15:25.471]  What a terrorist, folks.
[01:15:25.471 --> 01:15:29.413]  I apologize for having such a... Well, number one, he's white, which means he's bad.
[01:15:29.413 --> 01:15:34.514]  Number two, he's talking about liberty and freedom and standing up and men being men.
[01:15:34.514 --> 01:15:35.855]  Sexist!
[01:15:35.855 --> 01:15:37.415]  Sexist!
[01:15:37.415 --> 01:15:38.596]  Sexist!
[01:15:40.185 --> 01:15:41.366]  Oh, we've got to!
[01:15:41.366 --> 01:15:42.687]  Oh, you men won't go right through.
[01:15:42.687 --> 01:15:44.327]  You're wise, though.
[01:15:44.327 --> 01:15:46.369]  I'm gonna need to have a meeting with you, honey.
[01:15:46.369 --> 01:15:51.272]  I just like Twilight Zone.
[01:15:51.272 --> 01:15:52.272]  It's whatever your flavor.
[01:15:52.272 --> 01:15:55.274]  If you're a woman that likes women, you get to go grope them.
[01:15:55.274 --> 01:16:01.057]  If you're a shaved-head guy who likes to shove other men around for no reason and try to intimidate them, well, this is the job for you.
[01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:03.499]  You know, this is the job for you.
[01:16:03.499 --> 01:16:07.721]  I'd love to see these so-called bouncers and tough guys.
[01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:08.042]  Like, just...
[01:16:09.286 --> 01:16:12.607]  Just go out in the middle like East Texas or West Texas.
[01:16:12.607 --> 01:16:16.788]  Just walk into some hardware store and talk to people like that.
[01:16:16.788 --> 01:16:20.089]  Just walk up to maybe some 50-year-old guy that you outweigh by 100 pounds.
[01:16:20.089 --> 01:16:21.389]  Why don't you start a fight with him?
[01:16:21.389 --> 01:16:24.990]  He'll rip your head off, buddy.
[01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:26.210]  Why don't you go get in a rodeo?
[01:16:26.210 --> 01:16:26.730]  You're so tough.
[01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:29.551]  Learn how to steer wrestle.
[01:16:29.551 --> 01:16:30.091]  You're so tough.
[01:16:30.091 --> 01:16:33.192]  Why don't you go out there and grab a 1,000-pound cow and throw it on the ground?
[01:16:33.697 --> 01:16:34.758]  You're so tough.
[01:16:34.758 --> 01:16:35.879]  No, you're not tough.
[01:16:35.879 --> 01:16:43.046]  You want to be in little isolated places where you can be the winner and you can be the boss and you can be in control when you're a bunch of cowardly scum.
[01:16:43.046 --> 01:16:46.048]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to John in Texas.
[01:16:46.048 --> 01:16:46.769]  You're on the air.
[01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:47.230]  Go ahead.
[01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:49.392]  Hi, Alex.
[01:16:49.392 --> 01:16:49.712]  Hey, buddy.
[01:16:51.206 --> 01:17:06.074]  You know, one thing I resent about Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, first off, the fact that they still believe the fairy tale of 9-1-1, and second off, that they've been talking on TV, they've already convicted Assad of that chemical attack, when there's no proof that he did it as of yet.
[01:17:07.011 --> 01:17:13.873]  Well, actually, I mean, I've seen Rand Paul and Ted Cruz say there's not proof of that, and they are playing politics a little.
[01:17:13.873 --> 01:17:16.554]  Let me just tell you, Ron Paul's gone public about false flags.
[01:17:16.554 --> 01:17:18.435]  Ron Paul knows what really happened on 9-11.
[01:17:18.435 --> 01:17:19.315]  He's out of Congress.
[01:17:19.315 --> 01:17:21.876]  I can, you know, tell you just from what he said, what he's written.
[01:17:21.876 --> 01:17:23.917]  He's smart as I am or smarter.
[01:17:23.917 --> 01:17:25.358]  He's as smart as you are, he knows.
[01:17:25.358 --> 01:17:28.639]  He's talked about it before, that clearly there's a history of false flags.
[01:17:29.799 --> 01:17:34.101]  Anyway, you slice it, our government helped create Al-Qaeda, so they did it inadvertently.
[01:17:34.101 --> 01:17:36.022]  And then you can't debate it.
[01:17:36.022 --> 01:17:40.264]  And so when they go, we shouldn't be Al-Qaeda's air force, nobody's saying Assad's perfect.
[01:17:40.264 --> 01:17:41.664]  Assad isn't perfect.
[01:17:41.664 --> 01:17:48.907]  You don't come and say, Assad's a wonderful guy, and, you know, and... No, you say, look, he didn't attack anybody.
[01:17:48.907 --> 01:17:53.969]  Sure, it's a quasi-dictatorship, but it's better than Al-Qaeda, it's not our business.
[01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:57.451]  I mean, you've heard Rand Paul come out and say that Assad did the chemical attack?
[01:17:58.496 --> 01:18:03.280]  Yeah, I heard him just yesterday, I think it was, last night.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.401]  Oh yeah, that speech he did.
[01:18:04.401 --> 01:18:05.782]  I didn't have time to watch the whole thing.
[01:18:05.782 --> 01:18:12.387]  I mean, he may have been playing devil's advocate, like, you know, even if Assad did the chemical, I haven't seen it yet.
[01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:14.168]  I mean, what did he say?
[01:18:14.168 --> 01:18:21.514]  Oh, he just said that, yeah, we shouldn't get involved, but Assad did this, and we think we should be tried in an international tribunal or something like that, you know.
[01:18:21.514 --> 01:18:22.715]  Now, I told you last week,
[01:18:23.246 --> 01:18:29.907]  That I thought that the fact that some of those Syrians survived that chemical attack by using homemade gas masks that it was probably chlorine gas.
[01:18:31.124 --> 01:18:36.749]  And the fact that chlorine gas is so simple to make, you could go to a swimming pool supply store and get the stuff to do it.
[01:18:36.749 --> 01:18:37.310]  Anybody could do it.
[01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:39.732]  That's right, you were an NBC guy in the Army, right?
[01:18:39.732 --> 01:18:50.682]  Yes, and chlorine gas in low doses, it's a suffocating gas, but if you're on a... No, chlorine gas, there's always disasters down in Houston and Texas City.
[01:18:50.682 --> 01:18:52.944]  Every decade or so, it'll kill a bunch of people.
[01:18:52.944 --> 01:18:56.167]  When a couple of those tanks mix and chlorine gas gets dumped out,
[01:18:58.595 --> 01:19:00.456]  Ban chlorine, it's racist!
[01:19:00.456 --> 01:19:01.876]  I'm sorry.
[01:19:01.876 --> 01:19:03.377]  I said low doses.
[01:19:03.377 --> 01:19:06.979]  If you're on the outlying edges of the attack, it acts like a tear gas.
[01:19:06.979 --> 01:19:10.361]  That's why they got those videos of those kids running around the hospital.
[01:19:10.361 --> 01:19:14.823]  Well look, clearly some of those people have been hit with something, but I've seen new videos where they're flopping around.
[01:19:14.823 --> 01:19:16.804]  It's fake.
[01:19:16.804 --> 01:19:18.685]  It looks like some fake holy rolling stuff.
[01:19:18.685 --> 01:19:20.967]  I mean, it's just totally fake.
[01:19:21.764 --> 01:19:23.906]  I don't have to respond!
[01:19:23.906 --> 01:19:26.088]  I don't have to respond to your facts!
[01:19:26.088 --> 01:19:26.428]  Racist!
[01:19:41.141 --> 01:19:42.241]  How does that feel?
[01:19:42.241 --> 01:19:43.402]  I'm better than you now.
[01:19:43.402 --> 01:19:45.442]  I said racist.
[01:19:45.442 --> 01:19:46.842]  Racist.
[01:19:46.842 --> 01:19:47.983]  Racist.
[01:19:47.983 --> 01:19:48.943]  What do you say to that?
[01:19:48.943 --> 01:19:49.643]  Racist.
[01:19:49.643 --> 01:19:51.264]  Nananani boo boo.
[01:19:51.264 --> 01:19:53.024]  You're a racist.
[01:19:53.024 --> 01:19:53.784]  What do you say to that?
[01:19:53.784 --> 01:19:56.305]  Racist.
[01:19:56.305 --> 01:19:57.465]  Racist.
[01:19:57.465 --> 01:19:57.645]  Racist.
[01:20:01.403 --> 01:20:03.506]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[01:20:03.506 --> 01:20:11.535]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:20:11.535 --> 01:20:16.482]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:20:16.482 --> 01:20:18.384]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:20:18.624 --> 01:20:25.050]  If every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:33.277]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoodsDirect is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[01:20:33.277 --> 01:20:39.803]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[01:20:39.803 --> 01:20:40.924]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[01:20:47.029 --> 01:20:50.052]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:01.951]  Hi there.
[01:21:01.951 --> 01:21:03.472]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:21:03.472 --> 01:21:07.314]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:21:07.314 --> 01:21:16.460]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:23.165]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:21:23.165 --> 01:21:25.346]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:21:25.346 --> 01:21:30.430]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:39.094]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:44.697]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[01:21:44.697 --> 01:21:51.181]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:21:51.181 --> 01:21:56.904]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:21:56.904 --> 01:21:58.164]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:03.278]  Wouldn't it be nice to have one product that replaces more than ten?
[01:22:03.278 --> 01:22:05.039]  Saving you space, time, and money?
[01:22:05.039 --> 01:22:11.684]  HempUSA.org has a complete full spectrum vitamin mineral detox formulation called Micro Plant Powder Gold.

[01:22:29.457 --> 01:22:38.764]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:22:38.764 --> 01:22:39.565]  This capitalism?
[01:22:39.565 --> 01:22:45.730]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:45.730 --> 01:22:49.432]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:22:49.432 --> 01:22:50.373]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:01.661]  Great news, pure water lovers!

[01:23:49.087 --> 01:23:50.329]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[01:23:50.329 --> 01:23:51.391]  For the love of clean water.
[01:24:20.435 --> 01:24:23.896]  All right, he's with us for about 45 minutes, and then I'll go right back to your phone calls.
[01:24:23.896 --> 01:24:35.838]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of policy, department of treasury, father of Reaganomics, frequent guest, because his analysis has been so accurate and spot on in the now close to a decade we've been having him on.
[01:24:35.838 --> 01:24:47.600]  He wrote a few weeks ago that the diplomatic implosion of the new lie to escalate the ongoing proxy war in Syria signified the beginning of the collapse of the U.S.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:48.700]  empire, like the Soviet Union.
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:55.186]  And that's something that I've been saying as well, just as you can see it there, clear as the nose on your face.
[01:24:55.186 --> 01:25:01.332]  Conrad Black wrote a piece that pretty much followed what Roberts has said a few weeks before.
[01:25:01.332 --> 01:25:07.938]  Collapse of American influence recalls disintegration of Soviet Union fall of France.
[01:25:07.938 --> 01:25:12.083]  Only 9-11, which they intend to be the murderous blow on our Republic,
[01:25:12.984 --> 01:25:16.910]  to transfer us into a militarized imperial system.
[01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:19.835]  Only that has propped it up this long, and I believe a new one.
[01:25:20.836 --> 01:25:21.576]  Will fail.
[01:25:21.576 --> 01:25:24.058]  People really know now about false flag.
[01:25:24.058 --> 01:25:25.458]  There's a mass awakening happening.
[01:25:25.458 --> 01:25:26.399]  That's my view.
[01:25:26.399 --> 01:25:33.922]  I agree with Roberts that there's a collapse in confidence in the system, but I don't know his view on how big the awakening is or if he disagrees.
[01:25:33.922 --> 01:25:40.225]  We'll find out right now and we of course carry his news articles up on InfoWars.com.
[01:25:40.225 --> 01:25:43.247]  You can go to his site PaulCraigRoberts.org.
[01:25:43.247 --> 01:25:45.948]  Excellent site with all of his analysis and you can find his books there.
[01:25:46.668 --> 01:25:48.289]  Dr. Roberts, you heard my intro there.
[01:25:48.289 --> 01:25:50.091]  Where are we historically?
[01:25:50.091 --> 01:26:01.479]  My gut tells me the stars are aligning, but within this paradox, within this corridor, within this crossroads, the enemy could also really pull some stuff as well.
[01:26:01.479 --> 01:26:02.440]  Well, they won't give up.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:05.302]  I'm pretty sure of that.
[01:26:05.302 --> 01:26:11.807]  You know, what's so strange, Alex, is the world now is looking to Russia for leadership.
[01:26:14.577 --> 01:26:20.063]  It's a real switch from the latter half of the 20th century.
[01:26:20.063 --> 01:26:26.429]  So I think that the United States has done itself in with its lies.
[01:26:26.429 --> 01:26:35.519]  It should not have tried to pull off in Syria the same level of lies that it used for Iraq or Libya.
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:42.743]  So I think the world is caught on and it's left the United States in a very isolated position.
[01:26:42.743 --> 01:26:55.469]  It has to be embarrassing to be a superpower and have your main puppet state, the United Kingdom, vote down your war plans.
[01:26:55.469 --> 01:27:00.431]  I think that there is still some risk.
[01:27:00.431 --> 01:27:05.334]  You see, Putin simply outsmarted the White House moron.
[01:27:06.511 --> 01:27:19.818]  And when the Russians announced that the Syrians would give up their nuclear weapons and put them under international control, the White House didn't know what to do.
[01:27:19.818 --> 01:27:22.279]  They had the rug pulled out from under them.
[01:27:22.279 --> 01:27:25.421]  So they sent out their French puppet.
[01:27:26.417 --> 01:27:38.142]  And to tell the Russians that France would draw up the agreement and would stick in there the option of military action against Syria.
[01:27:38.142 --> 01:27:49.686]  Well, the Russians know what that means and so they of course won't stand for that because once they get any kind of agreement that has a military option, they'll
[01:27:51.002 --> 01:27:51.262]  I think?
[01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:08.089]  The curious thing is France.
[01:28:08.089 --> 01:28:13.411]  You know, I can remember when the French were very proud and independent.
[01:28:13.411 --> 01:28:16.592]  Charles de Gaulle would not let France be in NATO.
[01:28:16.592 --> 01:28:22.895]  He said he didn't want to be part of some American operation, that France was a sovereign country.
[01:28:22.895 --> 01:28:28.637]  And now it seems that they're very willing to be Washington's whore.
[01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:33.699]  But other than that, there's really no support for Washington.
[01:28:35.586 --> 01:28:36.747]  It is insane.
[01:28:36.747 --> 01:28:39.128]  You said on my broadcast about five years ago that the U.S.
[01:28:39.128 --> 01:28:40.608]  had lost its soft power.
[01:28:40.608 --> 01:28:43.890]  And before, there were really not a lot of good countries out there.
[01:28:43.890 --> 01:28:46.931]  So even though America wasn't perfect, the world looked at us as the good guys.
[01:28:46.931 --> 01:28:49.553]  We're now seen as the bad guys.
[01:28:49.553 --> 01:28:54.375]  And now they're calling, you know, on Drudge Report, Putin leader of the free world.
[01:28:54.375 --> 01:28:58.977]  I mean, that's got to really shake up the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:28:58.977 --> 01:29:00.117]  Oh, yes.
[01:29:00.117 --> 01:29:01.638]  I think it has.
[01:29:01.638 --> 01:29:02.959]  They overreached.
[01:29:04.753 --> 01:29:07.034]  They let the hubris run away with them.
[01:29:07.034 --> 01:29:11.636]  You see, I think what happened, they got away with 9-11.
[01:29:11.636 --> 01:29:21.640]  And they figured if people were stupid enough to fall for their asinine explanation of 9-11, that they could tell people anything.
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:25.801]  And so they began doing that, just telling them anything.
[01:29:25.801 --> 01:29:27.162]  And they got carried away with it.
[01:29:29.272 --> 01:29:34.175]  Enough time passed, and enough people, such as yourself, made efforts.
[01:29:34.175 --> 01:29:38.698]  And people began catching on, and they began seeing the pattern.
[01:29:38.698 --> 01:29:39.198]  Absolutely.

[01:33:08.495 --> 01:33:15.437]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:15.437 --> 01:33:17.818]  Folks, don't feel bad that the American empire is in trouble.
[01:33:17.818 --> 01:33:19.079]  It's not really an American empire.
[01:33:19.079 --> 01:33:24.781]  It's a Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, military industrial complex system that is totally
[01:33:25.788 --> 01:33:33.714]  Divorce from reality that for hundreds of years has been financing both sides of European wars and is absolutely predatory.
[01:33:33.714 --> 01:33:47.144]  We're going to be talking to Dr. Paul Greg Roberts about that and what he sees, what the different options are, what the best case scenario is versus worst case, and then he's going to leave us in about 12 minutes or so, and then we'll go directly back to your phone calls.

[01:35:19.645 --> 01:35:23.288]  We are supported by you, not by government like NPR and MSNBC.
[01:35:23.288 --> 01:35:24.609]  Oh yeah, MSNBC has government money.
[01:35:24.609 --> 01:35:25.450]  Look it up.
[01:35:25.450 --> 01:35:27.131]  Type in MSNBC has government money.
[01:35:27.131 --> 01:35:28.993]  You'll find out all about it.
[01:35:28.993 --> 01:35:29.874]  A lot of money.
[01:35:29.874 --> 01:35:31.015]  Billions a year.
[01:35:31.015 --> 01:35:35.639]  We're funded by the sponsors and by you.
[01:35:35.639 --> 01:35:37.060]  Going to InfoWars.com.
[01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:41.023]  I went to the Iron Maiden Megadeth concert last night, and I'm not going to exaggerate.
[01:35:41.023 --> 01:35:44.086]  I probably saw 50 InfoWars t-shirts at it.
[01:35:44.086 --> 01:35:44.907]  Very exciting.
[01:35:45.868 --> 01:35:46.548]  Very exciting.
[01:35:46.548 --> 01:35:47.428]  Great way.
[01:35:47.428 --> 01:35:57.131]  And I found groups of people that were wearing the t-shirts that were hanging out together, so it was an open, you know, not assigned seating, who were getting together by meeting each other wearing the t-shirts.
[01:35:57.131 --> 01:36:02.812]  So it's a great way to meet other Paul Revere's in your area and to support our broadcast.
[01:36:02.812 --> 01:36:05.593]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:36:05.593 --> 01:36:06.153]  It's all there.
[01:36:06.153 --> 01:36:07.454]  Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:36:07.454 --> 01:36:08.874]  And again, thank you all for your support.
[01:36:15.322 --> 01:36:22.244]  Now, speaking of great resources to understand what's happening, a great place to start is paulcrickroberts.org.
[01:36:22.244 --> 01:36:28.346]  And if you just tuned in, he's the former head of policy at the Treasury, the father of Reaganomics.
[01:36:28.346 --> 01:36:38.289]  He was involved in diplomacy and has won international awards in diplomacy for working to phase in the transition of the fall of the Soviet Union.
[01:36:38.289 --> 01:36:39.149]  So he's uniquely
[01:36:40.209 --> 01:36:43.430]  Uh, place to be able to break this down for us.
[01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:46.650]  And he's a part of a lot of the most prominent Washington think tanks as well.
[01:36:46.650 --> 01:36:55.212]  Um, and he's been warning of the real direction America's going because of losing soft power and becoming completely immoral in the governing level.
[01:36:55.212 --> 01:36:57.312]  So in the next 10 minutes I'm gonna try to give you the floor, sir.
[01:36:57.312 --> 01:37:00.433]  I'd like you to break down the question I prefaced.
[01:37:00.433 --> 01:37:02.433]  Looking out, what concerns you?
[01:37:02.433 --> 01:37:03.673]  What do you see as positive?
[01:37:03.673 --> 01:37:06.534]  Uh, what do you expect the establishment
[01:37:07.625 --> 01:37:15.222]  The Craven establishment to do, full of hubris, and other key points that you think people should be made aware of out there.
[01:37:16.792 --> 01:37:41.729]  Well, Alex, this question of yours would be much easier to answer when we see if the Obama regime and Israelis in the Israel lobby can maneuver somehow around the agreement that the Russians have brought forth that the Syrians simply dispossess themselves of all chemical weapons.
[01:37:41.729 --> 01:37:45.252]  Now, if the Obama regime can't get around that,
[01:37:46.688 --> 01:37:56.733]  It really means the end of the neoconservative project for a new American century in which they laid out all the countries they were going to overthrow.
[01:37:56.733 --> 01:38:02.336]  You know, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria.
[01:38:02.336 --> 01:38:07.279]  Another hundred year Reich that would never die that died in just a decade, yeah.
[01:38:07.279 --> 01:38:15.263]  Right, but if it stops and they can't get Syria, then that whole program has been defeated and I don't think they want to give it up.
[01:38:16.264 --> 01:38:30.711]  It's a very important thing to the neoconservatives, to the military security complex, to Wall Street, to the Israeli government, and these are powerful
[01:38:31.727 --> 01:38:52.756]  Forces and they will do whatever they can to get around the fact that Russia and Syria have removed the manufactured excuse by the Obama regime for continuing on this policy of conquest.
[01:38:52.756 --> 01:38:58.558]  So I don't think it's we can't answer until we see what happens.
[01:38:58.558 --> 01:39:00.439]  What does the Obama regime do now?
[01:39:01.801 --> 01:39:24.270]  And once we see that, if, for example, they go and pull off some other false flag event and blame Syria and claim self-defense, for example, it would be very easy for the Israelis to have the so-called Syrian rebels to launch chemical weapons onto Israel.
[01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:26.851]  And then Israel can claim self-defense.
[01:39:27.979 --> 01:39:30.220]  And does it need a U.N.
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:32.440]  resolution or any kind of cover?
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.001]  Exactly, that's what I've been predicting.
[01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:38.562]  But the problem, now the Russians say they have intel, but now no one buys it.
[01:39:38.562 --> 01:39:42.623]  And a lot of the Israelis that call into the show, they don't want to side with Al-Qaeda.
[01:39:42.623 --> 01:39:47.905]  I think it's the fact that the West is backing Al-Qaeda has shown the emperor has no clothes.
[01:39:47.905 --> 01:39:55.767]  But Israel or the elements running it, how do they think they're going to get away with putting Al-Qaeda in charge of Syria?
[01:39:56.926 --> 01:40:06.092]  Well, it suits the purpose, because it destroys... First of all, no one will be in charge.
[01:40:06.092 --> 01:40:08.654]  It'll be like Iraq today.
[01:40:08.654 --> 01:40:11.136]  The government doesn't really have control.
[01:40:11.136 --> 01:40:12.236]  Or like Libya.
[01:40:12.236 --> 01:40:15.118]  It's an immoral destabilization program.
[01:40:15.118 --> 01:40:21.042]  It destabilizes, it turns the people against each other, and there's no organized government.
[01:40:22.183 --> 01:40:34.297]  And of course, the main purpose of this is to further radicalize the Muslims so that it spreads into the Russian and Chinese populations.
[01:40:34.297 --> 01:40:36.800]  You know, both countries have Muslim populations.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.501]  That's the key, and you crystallize it.
[01:40:39.501 --> 01:40:56.327]  On record, the secret of the clash of civilizations is they are using radical Islam like a new form of globalist, New World Order, Anglo-American colonization of worldwide destabilization, while using the Muslim threat to take our rights at home as well.
[01:40:56.327 --> 01:40:58.428]  What a masterstroke!
[01:40:58.428 --> 01:40:59.568]  Well, you summed it up.
[01:40:59.568 --> 01:41:02.469]  That's exactly what the policy is.
[01:41:02.469 --> 01:41:04.610]  But, you see, if it stops now,
[01:41:05.530 --> 01:41:09.334]  In Syria, I don't know what they'll do.
[01:41:09.334 --> 01:41:11.076]  Of course, they have a lot of hubris.
[01:41:11.076 --> 01:41:19.825]  I mean, you had to have a lot of hubris to stage this obviously transparent lie that Assad had used chemical weapons.
[01:41:21.343 --> 01:41:23.164]  First of all, suppose he did.
[01:41:23.164 --> 01:41:25.645]  It's none of our business.
[01:41:25.645 --> 01:41:28.027]  He didn't use them against us.
[01:41:28.027 --> 01:41:29.467]  He's not attacked anyone.
[01:41:29.467 --> 01:41:32.709]  He's defending the country from outside invaders.
[01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:39.693]  And so the fact that he's used chemical weapons or didn't use chemical weapons, it doesn't give the United States an excuse.
[01:41:39.693 --> 01:41:40.793]  But clearly he didn't.
[01:41:40.793 --> 01:41:43.294]  I mean, and Kerry said... I know, I know he didn't.
[01:41:43.294 --> 01:41:44.015]  Of course he didn't.
[01:41:44.015 --> 01:41:46.496]  But I'm just saying even if he did, it doesn't make a difference.
[01:41:46.496 --> 01:41:47.617]  It's still not an excuse.
[01:41:48.909 --> 01:41:56.895]  There's nothing in the international law that says the United States can attack a country that uses chemical weapons against an enemy who attacks it.
[01:41:56.895 --> 01:42:00.278]  Well, that's what's so amazing is Obama says we're not going to have boots on the ground.
[01:42:00.278 --> 01:42:02.059]  They started the war, as you said.
[01:42:02.059 --> 01:42:03.240]  It's outrageous.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:03.920]  Yeah.
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:06.602]  Well, the United States uses chemical weapons continuously.
[01:42:06.602 --> 01:42:10.305]  I mean, what do you think white phosphorus is?
[01:42:10.305 --> 01:42:11.326]  Or DU.
[01:42:11.326 --> 01:42:12.627]  Uranium.
[01:42:12.627 --> 01:42:16.710]  And look what the United States did to the people of Vietnam with Agent Orange.
[01:42:17.608 --> 01:42:27.238]  You know, there's over 150,000 kids born with facial deformities from Agent Orange.
[01:42:27.238 --> 01:42:32.424]  I mean, the United States is the biggest and worst user of chemical weapons.
[01:42:32.424 --> 01:42:39.512]  In fact, the United States has used more chemical weapons against more people than every other country in the world combined.
[01:42:40.802 --> 01:42:47.889]  So obviously when they stand on this high horse, it's just fabricated.
[01:42:47.889 --> 01:42:49.991]  It's an orchestrated excuse.
[01:42:49.991 --> 01:42:52.114]  So they want to attack it.
[01:42:52.114 --> 01:42:57.119]  So now the excuse they fabricated, the Russians have taken it away from.
[01:42:57.119 --> 01:42:59.781]  They'll try to get another excuse.
[01:42:59.781 --> 01:43:00.582]  And it's true.
[01:43:00.582 --> 01:43:01.924]  People see through them now.
[01:43:03.274 --> 01:43:07.558]  But when you're full of hubris, you make mistakes.
[01:43:07.558 --> 01:43:14.584]  And so the United States government is completely capable of making an even bigger fool of itself.
[01:43:14.584 --> 01:43:23.332]  And then what you have to worry about when they realize that the whole world sees through them, that they're despised, that they pull out the nukes.
[01:43:24.369 --> 01:43:35.656]  You can't trust people, the kind of people that are in the United States government, really can't be trusted with BB guns, much less with nuclear weapons.
[01:43:35.656 --> 01:43:40.459]  Why don't we have the United States turn over its chemical weapons?
[01:43:40.459 --> 01:43:43.160]  The whole world would be a lot safer.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:47.683]  Let Syria keep theirs, but get them away from the Americans.
[01:43:47.683 --> 01:43:50.465]  That's what's dangerous, especially the nuclear weapons.
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:58.143]  If the world wants to be safe, they've got to get the weapons of mass destruction away from the United States.
[01:43:58.143 --> 01:43:59.304]  Because we're occupied.
[01:43:59.304 --> 01:44:01.945]  How do we get the word out that this isn't really even the U.S.
[01:44:01.945 --> 01:44:08.949]  government and that it's these kleptocratic financial interests that love to use destabilization?
[01:44:10.131 --> 01:44:16.756]  Well, you know, it looks to me like we're headed into a depression.
[01:44:16.756 --> 01:44:18.918]  I mean, we've never had a recovery.
[01:44:18.918 --> 01:44:21.079]  There's nothing to drive the economy.
[01:44:21.079 --> 01:44:24.962]  I would expect that a year from now we're being in depression.
[01:44:24.962 --> 01:44:29.846]  And this may help people see that they don't really have a government.
[01:44:29.846 --> 01:44:30.966]  No one represents them.
[01:44:32.370 --> 01:44:38.793]  That everything is key toward a handful of powerful private interest groups.
[01:44:38.793 --> 01:44:44.356]  I think just as things unfold and develop, people catch on.
[01:44:44.356 --> 01:44:45.676]  That's about the only way.
[01:44:45.676 --> 01:44:50.419]  I mean, you can sit down and try to tell them and you run into a lot of resistance.
[01:44:52.250 --> 01:44:54.530]  You know, I run into a lot less, though, Dr. Roberts.
[01:44:54.530 --> 01:44:58.831]  I mean, I really see positive things happening out there on the street.
[01:44:58.831 --> 01:45:05.092]  And, you know, what hurts my feelings is, just for humanity, how they use the Balkanization.
[01:45:05.092 --> 01:45:06.393]  I'm not anti-Israel.
[01:45:06.393 --> 01:45:07.653]  You've never been anti-Israel.
[01:45:07.653 --> 01:45:18.695]  You get called anti-Israel because you point out it's immoral for the people running the Israeli government to be putting al-Qaeda into a country and to be caught arming them, just like Turkey's doing and the French and everybody else.
[01:45:19.215 --> 01:45:21.976]  We're not anti-France when we say it's wrong, the French government's doing it.
[01:45:21.976 --> 01:45:25.138]  We're not anti-America when we say Obama's wrong.
[01:45:25.138 --> 01:45:27.959]  It's like this hands-off, don't criticize Israel.
[01:45:27.959 --> 01:45:29.720]  I think that's backfiring.
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:39.505]  And it's really making it sexy to criticize Israel in outlandish ways instead of really criticizing Israel for what's wrong.
[01:45:39.505 --> 01:45:44.327]  Well, I think the Israel lobby overused the anti-Semitic slur.
[01:45:45.754 --> 01:45:53.865]  Because now anyone who criticizes any aspect of Israeli policy is said to be anti-Semitic.
[01:45:53.865 --> 01:45:58.751]  So now they have to apply it to a whole range of very prominent intellectual Jews.
[01:46:00.945 --> 01:46:10.772]  So, almost the entirety of the Jewish intelligentsia now are said to be anti-Semitic or salvating Jews.
[01:46:10.772 --> 01:46:14.194]  So, it doesn't work for them anymore.
[01:46:14.194 --> 01:46:19.438]  And what it originally meant, anti-Semitic, meant somebody who hates the Jewish people.
[01:46:20.945 --> 01:46:29.088]  What it means now is that anybody that makes even a mild criticism of any policy that the Israeli government follows.
[01:46:29.088 --> 01:46:30.688]  Well, I see this also backfiring.
[01:46:30.688 --> 01:46:37.951]  Like Ed Asner came out and said, Hollywood, I've been told this, but people are afraid to criticize Obama because they'll be called racist.
[01:46:37.951 --> 01:46:43.352]  And so now any criticism of Obamacare, it's all racist.
[01:46:43.352 --> 01:46:46.453]  And so I think that's been overused as well.
[01:46:46.453 --> 01:46:48.174]  And there's a real backlash happening.
[01:46:49.014 --> 01:46:50.596]  That's right.
[01:46:50.596 --> 01:46:51.177]  You're right.
[01:46:51.177 --> 01:47:00.968]  But what it also shows is, when they have to take refuge in racist or anti-Semitic, it means that their policies cannot stand examination.
[01:47:02.788 --> 01:47:10.090]  And so they prevent anybody looking at the policies by throwing up this barrage of name-calling.
[01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:20.534]  So it really shows how weak the position, the intellectual or the integrity position is of the two countries when they pull this type of thing.
[01:47:20.534 --> 01:47:23.195]  Oh, you criticize America, you must not like black people.
[01:47:24.637 --> 01:47:25.799]  Oh, you criticize Israel.
[01:47:25.799 --> 01:47:27.681]  You must hate Jews.
[01:47:27.681 --> 01:47:32.266]  This shows that their policies cannot stand examination.
[01:47:33.197 --> 01:47:37.178]  So I think it's a further sign of their weakness.
[01:47:37.178 --> 01:47:40.039]  What does your gut tell you how this is going to end?
[01:47:40.039 --> 01:47:44.761]  Because I see even mainstream media saying Obama's buying his own propaganda.
[01:47:44.761 --> 01:47:46.121]  The government looks like a joke.
[01:47:46.121 --> 01:47:47.242]  We're imploding.
[01:47:47.242 --> 01:47:57.545]  I see the power structure itself beginning to realize that they've way overplayed and that any confidence they had left is draining away very quickly.
[01:47:57.545 --> 01:47:59.686]  I mean, I've got my ear to the ground.
[01:47:59.686 --> 01:48:01.727]  And let me tell you, I mean, this is collapse level.
[01:48:02.469 --> 01:48:20.921]  And just like the Soviet Union probably really collapsed in the mid-eighties, it didn't happen until 1991 officially, I think that they may still start World War III and I guess win that way by blowing the earth up, but my gut and intellectually, historically tells me I think they've already collapsed or they're in the process of collapsing right now.
[01:48:20.921 --> 01:48:22.142]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:48:22.142 --> 01:48:31.168]  I think they've been exposed and the world no longer has any confidence in anything that the United States government says or the Israeli government.
[01:48:32.190 --> 01:48:36.532]  And they're exposed and that they are collapsing now.
[01:48:36.532 --> 01:48:46.515]  It doesn't mean they won't have, they won't convince themselves in some way out of it, or they have a way to recoup, or they won't do something stupid.
[01:48:46.515 --> 01:48:49.677]  That's still entirely a possibility.
[01:48:49.677 --> 01:48:56.439]  And I think we should talk about this again in a week or two or whenever, when we see what is the outcome.
[01:48:56.439 --> 01:49:01.041]  You know, Kerry is very upset that the Russians outsmarted him.
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:03.962]  And so is the Israeli government.
[01:49:03.962 --> 01:49:13.090]  And so they're mad, they're angry because they had it all set for an attack and now they can't.
[01:49:13.090 --> 01:49:20.076]  So let's see how, if they're defeated or if they pull something else.
[01:49:20.076 --> 01:49:24.200]  And if they're defeated, then I think we see a lot more hope.
[01:49:25.763 --> 01:49:32.908]  And really what people should do, they should use this defeat to start removing these people from public office.
[01:49:32.908 --> 01:49:34.710]  Well, that's the move to impeachment.
[01:49:34.710 --> 01:49:35.991]  We got Walter Jones coming on.
[01:49:35.991 --> 01:49:36.531]  He called us today.
[01:49:36.531 --> 01:49:37.232]  I think tomorrow.
[01:49:37.232 --> 01:49:38.032]  He's been very busy.
[01:49:38.032 --> 01:49:43.937]  But I mean, we've got to really take the moral high ground here and keep pushing and also explain.
[01:49:43.937 --> 01:49:46.398]  A fall of the American empire is good for America.
[01:49:46.398 --> 01:49:47.019]  We pay for it.
[01:49:47.019 --> 01:49:48.320]  We don't get any of the spoils now.
[01:49:50.502 --> 01:50:00.771]  Not being used for this global hegemonic technocracy that wants to destabilize everything not controlled by the hedge funds so they can suck these countries dry.
[01:50:00.771 --> 01:50:08.599]  I think Israel not trying to expand is in the end going to be good for Israel because I think if they just keep pushing into Armageddon, that's what we're going to get.
[01:50:08.599 --> 01:50:11.462]  That's exactly, you're right.
[01:50:11.462 --> 01:50:13.063]  I agree with that.
[01:50:13.063 --> 01:50:14.524]  I think that's the correct
[01:50:16.111 --> 01:50:25.535]  Diagnosis, prognosis and we'll have to just see what they do about Russia and the Syrian solution.
[01:50:25.535 --> 01:50:32.038]  If they accept it, then I think we've had a major change.
[01:50:33.533 --> 01:50:34.174]  All for the better.
[01:50:47.873 --> 01:50:49.174]  I enjoy talking to you, Alex.
[01:50:49.174 --> 01:50:52.576]  I enjoy talking to you, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the father of Reaganomics, leaving us.
[01:50:52.576 --> 01:50:54.257]  All right, we're going to come back and go to your calls.
[01:50:54.257 --> 01:50:56.439]  We've got calls for about 30 minutes to the next hour.
[01:50:56.439 --> 01:51:00.921]  Then Dr. Edwin Vieira, a constitutional scholar, is going to join us and talk about how to impeach Obama.
[01:51:00.921 --> 01:51:02.022]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:51:02.022 --> 01:51:06.505]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:51:06.505 --> 01:51:12.249]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:51:12.249 --> 01:51:15.511]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:52:59.607 --> 01:53:04.329]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:53:04.329 --> 01:53:07.430]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:13.012]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:53:13.012 --> 01:53:14.593]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:53:14.933 --> 01:53:16.574]  We are what we eat.
[01:53:16.574 --> 01:53:21.237]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:53:21.237 --> 01:53:25.460]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:28.022]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:53:28.022 --> 01:53:34.246]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:54:08.288 --> 01:54:12.952]  You know, they say the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[01:54:12.952 --> 01:54:16.256]  And Obama was going to be the new Christ.
[01:54:16.256 --> 01:54:21.601]  And instead, he is seriously destructive to the globalists.
[01:54:21.601 --> 01:54:22.581]  I want to be clear, though.
[01:54:22.581 --> 01:54:26.785]  This is the really dangerous time right now, where they're going to throw curveballs, you name it.
[01:54:26.785 --> 01:54:31.009]  You've got a collection of groups that want to
[01:54:32.329 --> 01:54:33.350]  I mean, that's what groups always do.
[01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:35.411]  They always want to take land, take infrastructure.
[01:54:35.411 --> 01:54:40.376]  But the key here to get out to everybody, then we're going to your calls, is exactly what I said.
[01:54:40.376 --> 01:54:46.060]  And I know I've said this on air, but we need to quantify it and get the narrative, the true narrative out to everybody.
[01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:59.211]  The West has been radicalizing Islam for about a hundred years to use it as a weapon to take over groups that are not radical.
[01:55:00.501 --> 01:55:06.546]  As a way to destabilize them, then get control of the groups, and then finance the groups to attack other people.
[01:55:06.546 --> 01:55:13.392]  So there is a global caliphate forming, that's true.
[01:55:13.392 --> 01:55:17.455]  But they're always like, let Homeland Security take over, take all your rights, and the caliphate will get you.
[01:55:17.455 --> 01:55:23.400]  Meanwhile, it is a radical caliphate to destroy moderate Islam.
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:25.522]  And what I would say, you know, real Islam.
[01:55:26.778 --> 01:55:29.180]  And so it's a false clash of civilizations.
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:31.622]  And Dick Cheney, you know, wrote white papers on it.
[01:55:31.622 --> 01:55:35.965]  How they are going to fund radical Islam and then have clashes with it.
[01:55:35.965 --> 01:55:37.667]  And that's what all these governments are doing.
[01:55:37.667 --> 01:55:38.948]  I mean, why did Israel get caught?
[01:55:38.948 --> 01:55:45.433]  Haaretz, Jerusalem Post, creating fake Al-Qaeda groups to stage bombings every time they wanted to have a diversion.
[01:55:45.433 --> 01:55:52.719]  It was like Clinton bombing in Sudan, the famous aspirin factory they said was making chemical weapons.
[01:55:52.719 --> 01:55:53.079]  Remember that?
[01:55:54.335 --> 01:55:57.998]  And it was when it came out he was lying about Monica Lewinsky.
[01:55:57.998 --> 01:55:59.759]  Now that would have become the big story.
[01:55:59.759 --> 01:56:02.001]  Oh, he lied to us, he might have had to step down.
[01:56:02.001 --> 01:56:04.643]  So instead, he fired missiles at an aspirin factory.
[01:56:04.643 --> 01:56:09.367]  And then when more stuff came out, they attacked Iraq, saying they didn't let inspectors in.
[01:56:11.212 --> 01:56:15.035]  So see, war is just good for all these corporations, these companies.
[01:56:15.035 --> 01:56:18.237]  Turkey wants a war to divert from their political stuff.
[01:56:18.237 --> 01:56:19.238]  Israel wants one.
[01:56:19.238 --> 01:56:27.985]  The communist French, Hollande, they're in a huge scandal how they all have secret bank accounts with billions of euros.
[01:56:27.985 --> 01:56:32.288]  They don't pay taxes, while raising the taxes to above 100% on the nouveau riche.
[01:56:35.265 --> 01:56:37.447]  You think the Rothschild French pay taxes?
[01:56:37.447 --> 01:56:38.809]  No, they're all offshore.
[01:56:38.809 --> 01:56:45.636]  It's all come out, folks, so they have to change the subject.
[01:56:45.636 --> 01:56:53.365]  They don't want us talking about Warren Buffett, the biggest recipient of the last six or seven rounds of bailouts in the last six years?
[01:56:53.365 --> 01:56:54.366]  Five and a half years since 2008?
[01:56:57.039 --> 01:57:02.262]  They don't want that when he's up there sponsoring news shows on this week on ABC News.
[01:57:02.262 --> 01:57:05.945]  Says at the end, sponsored by his foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:57:05.945 --> 01:57:07.826]  He's part of that.
[01:57:07.826 --> 01:57:14.070]  And he's on the show every week as a hero saying, raise taxes, raise taxes, rich people the rich, raise taxes.
[01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:15.270]  He gets your money!
[01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:19.453]  When you make $50,000 a year now, that's rich!
[01:57:19.453 --> 01:57:21.474]  And it goes to that piece of crud!
[01:57:21.474 --> 01:57:23.576]  I mean, do you understand how angry this makes me?
[01:57:24.844 --> 01:57:31.086]  I mean, the level of the fraud is galactic in scope.
[01:57:31.086 --> 01:57:33.266]  It is a total hoax.
[01:57:33.266 --> 01:57:37.568]  The government runs Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:37.568 --> 01:57:41.569]  They don't run them too good, though, because they like to upload videos of themselves nerve gassing.
[01:57:41.569 --> 01:57:49.271]  I mean, you watch them load the nerve gas, and there's attack after attack the last year on the end of a rocket, you know, on the end of a mortar rocket.
[01:57:51.104 --> 01:57:54.408]  And then they are so happy, you know, celebrating, because they're a rock star now, folks.
[01:57:54.408 --> 01:58:00.715]  Their family's gonna get $200,000, $300,000 from the Saudi royal family or the Qatar royal family.
[01:58:00.715 --> 01:58:06.080]  I mean, they've only got to launch five or six attacks, tape it, come back.
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:08.183]  They're a rock star, baby!
[01:58:08.183 --> 01:58:09.684]  They're set for life!
[01:58:10.871 --> 01:58:20.156]  But, still, no one can stop them from uploading the videos of hacking Christian children up, murdering people, because this is their rock star.
[01:58:20.156 --> 01:58:21.436]  This is their narcissism.
[01:58:21.436 --> 01:58:25.538]  This is their Miley Cyrus licking on a sledgehammer.
[01:58:25.538 --> 01:58:28.720]  This is what they do.
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:29.980]  They can't help it.
[01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:32.542]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:58:32.542 --> 01:58:38.204]  Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood of Coptic Christians convert to Islam or pay a tax.
[01:58:38.204 --> 01:58:38.785]  They're right about it.

[02:00:10.335 --> 02:00:11.916]  You want answers?

[02:00:21.922 --> 02:00:31.548]  Alright, we're going directly to your phone calls.
[02:00:32.901 --> 02:00:36.603]  There's some breaking news just went up on InfoWars.com.
[02:00:36.603 --> 02:00:38.345]  It's also up on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:00:38.345 --> 02:00:42.587]  Wall Street Journal op-ed writer Elizabeth Obagi, is that how you pronounce it?
[02:00:42.587 --> 02:00:44.168]  Fired for resume lies.
[02:00:44.168 --> 02:00:45.809]  She's not a doctorate.
[02:00:45.809 --> 02:00:50.152]  And she's the one that's been schlepping the lies out there.
[02:00:50.152 --> 02:00:52.233]  Pushing the lies about
[02:00:54.588 --> 02:01:00.251]  You know, the fact that there's clear evidence that there needs to be a Syrian strike as Assad's behind the chemical weapons attack.
[02:01:00.251 --> 02:01:01.792]  It's just they're all frauds.
[02:01:01.792 --> 02:01:05.694]  It's like the aluminum tube stuff out of the New York Times and all that.
[02:01:05.694 --> 02:01:11.156]  The Niger yellow cake they found in Big Bird's nest.
[02:01:11.156 --> 02:01:15.098]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tracy in Texas.
[02:01:15.098 --> 02:01:18.460]  Thank you for calling in on September 11th's anniversary.
[02:01:19.813 --> 02:01:22.414]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:01:22.414 --> 02:01:23.474]  I had a question.
[02:01:23.474 --> 02:01:45.960]  There was some documents sent to Reverend Michelle Hopkins from retired Senator out of South Dakota, Sheldon R. Songstead, about FEMA purchase orders that needed to be delivered to FEMA Sector 3 in Austin, Texas by October 1st.
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:46.700]  I wanted to know if
[02:01:48.018 --> 02:01:49.739]  You know, what's that about?
[02:01:49.739 --> 02:01:52.861]  Well, I'm in FEMA Region 6, formerly Texas.
[02:01:52.861 --> 02:01:54.322]  FEMA Region 3 is out on the East Coast.
[02:01:54.322 --> 02:01:58.886]  But yes, there's giant secret and public FEMA drills going on.
[02:01:58.886 --> 02:02:03.209]  Practicing martial law takeover.
[02:02:03.209 --> 02:02:06.431]  Basically, toilet safety police type stuff everywhere.
[02:02:06.431 --> 02:02:10.394]  Mass roundups, takeover of the media, staging cyber attacks.
[02:02:10.394 --> 02:02:13.376]  There's no telling what the Empire will do to try to sell all this war.
[02:02:14.448 --> 02:02:20.714]  Well, the thing that's weird to me is that they were ordering the MRE meals.
[02:02:20.714 --> 02:02:22.956]  Yeah, ma'am, that's not secret documents.
[02:02:22.956 --> 02:02:24.018]  That's public.
[02:02:24.018 --> 02:02:27.441]  They've never been storing more food.
[02:02:27.441 --> 02:02:32.706]  MyPatriotsSupply.com, that big reputable group, they released the documents.
[02:02:32.706 --> 02:02:33.427]  I have the courage to do it.
[02:02:39.141 --> 02:02:40.381]  They also wanted all the GPS and satellites.
[02:03:04.338 --> 02:03:08.784]  To be on the same wavelength and the test date to be September 29th.
[02:03:08.784 --> 02:03:09.845]  No, no, that's right.
[02:03:09.845 --> 02:03:15.633]  I mean, there's been a decade-long program to unify all the frequencies so the feds can control everything.
[02:03:15.633 --> 02:03:18.337]  And so they can command everything and so they can cut everything off.
[02:03:19.025 --> 02:03:23.908]  Just like they did in Katrina, cutting down the police radio line when they refused to stand down.
[02:03:23.908 --> 02:03:25.729]  They were ordered to stand down so rioting could start.
[02:03:25.729 --> 02:03:26.670]  That's all on record.
[02:03:26.670 --> 02:03:29.392]  So FEMA could then get more power saying, oh look, we failed.
[02:03:29.392 --> 02:03:32.154]  Because in every other country, they fire you when you fail.
[02:03:32.154 --> 02:03:34.335]  In America, you get rewarded when you fail.
[02:03:34.335 --> 02:03:35.696]  Oh, NORAD stood down?
[02:03:35.696 --> 02:03:36.937]  Oh, you let the hijackers in?
[02:03:36.937 --> 02:03:38.418]  Oh, you protected them on record?
[02:03:38.418 --> 02:03:41.340]  Oh, here, let's triple the budget of Homeland Security.
[02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:45.462]  The date that they want everything done by October 1st
[02:04:06.214 --> 02:04:09.878]  Yeah, man, there's a drill October into November.
[02:04:09.878 --> 02:04:11.259]  It's a month-plus long drill.
[02:04:11.259 --> 02:04:12.020]  It's like five weeks.
[02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:14.903]  Well, one's four weeks, one's five weeks, one's six weeks.
[02:04:14.903 --> 02:04:23.512]  They all overlap basically for total power grid failure, martial law, riot police called up, federalization drill.
[02:04:23.512 --> 02:04:25.354]  It's a total martial law takeover drill.
[02:04:26.932 --> 02:04:29.094]  Not just in FEMA Region 3, but in other areas.
[02:04:29.094 --> 02:04:37.821]  And to prime the pump, they're telling all the police that there's real intelligence on a terror attack and that this is not really a drill, they're just telling the public this.
[02:04:37.821 --> 02:04:40.503]  Because they may blow stuff up and blame it on Syria, you understand?
[02:04:40.503 --> 02:04:42.465]  Yes.
[02:04:42.465 --> 02:04:45.828]  And then have nuclear war and then go into their bunkers while we all die on the surface.
[02:04:46.758 --> 02:04:47.219]  And why?
[02:04:47.219 --> 02:04:48.681]  Because they're... Look at John Kerry.
[02:04:48.681 --> 02:04:50.143]  I mean, the man is a demon.
[02:04:50.143 --> 02:04:50.804]  Look at Obama.
[02:04:50.804 --> 02:04:51.725]  Look at Scullin Mose.
[02:04:51.725 --> 02:04:56.672]  I mean, these are people that bathe in giant vats of feces, literally.
[02:04:56.672 --> 02:04:57.653]  That's Scullin Mose.
[02:04:57.653 --> 02:04:58.434]  This is what they do.
[02:04:58.434 --> 02:04:59.316]  These are devil worshipers.
[02:05:01.368 --> 02:05:03.469]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[02:05:03.469 --> 02:05:11.495]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:05:11.495 --> 02:05:16.438]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:05:16.438 --> 02:05:19.360]  The problem is we can't help everybody if every one of
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:20.140]  We're good to go.
[02:05:44.150 --> 02:05:45.251]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.

[02:08:19.588 --> 02:08:21.909]  There's something going on, my friends.
[02:08:21.909 --> 02:08:29.631]  Beautiful lyrics by Shooter Jennings.
[02:08:39.431 --> 02:08:42.574]  Put your ear to the ground.
[02:08:42.574 --> 02:08:46.457]  Shudder from the sound.
[02:08:46.457 --> 02:08:49.900]  The death machine ain't slowing down.
[02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:55.065]  The gas mask is the couture of the summer of rage.
[02:08:55.065 --> 02:08:58.368]  They're preparing us for an all-out police state.
[02:08:58.368 --> 02:09:05.454]  Crank up this part right here and we're going to your calls.
[02:09:13.049 --> 02:09:17.374]  That's right, little child.
[02:09:17.374 --> 02:09:18.956]  That's right, my friends.
[02:09:18.956 --> 02:09:22.461]  Only thing you can trust is the love in your mother's eyes.

[02:09:26.468 --> 02:09:31.611]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, transmitting and broadcasting worldwide.
[02:09:31.611 --> 02:09:32.651]  And we stand for the truth.
[02:09:32.651 --> 02:09:33.612]  I mean, that's it.
[02:09:33.612 --> 02:09:43.456]  We're trying to unify humanity around ideas of basic human liberty and freedom and kinship and honor and fealty towards common sense and justice.
[02:09:43.456 --> 02:09:54.002]  And we strive to lift up society and to aspire to the more beautiful angels of humankind instead of man's
[02:09:55.290 --> 02:09:58.972]  More wicked angels, as it was once said.
[02:09:58.972 --> 02:10:01.113]  And that is our goal.
[02:10:01.113 --> 02:10:05.756]  And that's where we stand, and that's who we are, and that's why the system will attack us.
[02:10:05.756 --> 02:10:10.919]  So many people feel powerless, so they join the dark side, believing they're going to gain power from it.
[02:10:10.919 --> 02:10:13.621]  And all you do is become a slave, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:13.621 --> 02:10:24.427]  But when you decide to start doing the right thing, and also decide that you're valuable, and that you're part of a greater destiny, then you will be fulfilled, and Madison Avenue can't make you feel inadequate anymore.
[02:10:25.754 --> 02:10:30.257]  I look at how insecure and narcissistic and desperate people are.
[02:10:30.257 --> 02:10:32.859]  Desperate to feel like they have status.
[02:10:32.859 --> 02:10:35.100]  Desperate to feel like they have power.
[02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:38.262]  Desperate, but they want to do it through the system.
[02:10:38.262 --> 02:10:42.085]  Instead of realizing that you already have incredible power.
[02:10:42.085 --> 02:10:49.450]  You come from your ancestors and all they went through and that all our species will go through and that you're part of a great continuum.
[02:10:52.062 --> 02:10:59.747]  Twelve years after the New World Order clearly staged and launched and orchestrated the 9-11 attacks.
[02:11:02.202 --> 02:11:12.365]  They are now publicly going into the next phase of their plan to turn the West and Europe and Eastern Europe and Asia over to radical Islam.
[02:11:12.365 --> 02:11:23.769]  And then use that attack by radical Islam to selectively enslave areas more already under their control, to knock out countries they don't control, and then roll in and put in tyranny.
[02:11:24.269 --> 02:11:26.510]  The globalists want to enslave everyone.
[02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:28.571]  The globalists want to build a horrible world.
[02:11:28.571 --> 02:11:30.052]  The globalists are parasitic.
[02:11:30.052 --> 02:11:37.076]  They want to reduce us down to absolute despotism to then carry out a eugenics population reduction program on us.
[02:11:37.076 --> 02:11:39.037]  No one stands to gain from this.
[02:11:39.657 --> 02:11:44.941]  Except less than 6,000 top globalists in their own words in Rothkopf's superclass book.
[02:11:44.941 --> 02:11:45.941]  He breaks that down.
[02:11:45.941 --> 02:11:46.321]  And I agree.
[02:11:46.321 --> 02:11:59.390]  There's about 6,000 super gophers and less than 20 mega families that represent the Western establishment who are antithetically anti-Western because they understand that it is antithetical to their program.
[02:12:00.580 --> 02:12:10.125]  And they are demonizing the West and destroying our name while they use our energy and our insight and our inventiveness to dominate the world.
[02:12:10.125 --> 02:12:17.490]  And while they move their assets to Russia and China, they're even building them up as the new bipolar world.
[02:12:17.490 --> 02:12:23.033]  But those bipolar systems continue to actually merge at the mercantile level.
[02:12:23.033 --> 02:12:26.755]  Just as the North American Union is merging with the EU since 2007 official treaty.
[02:12:29.315 --> 02:12:32.917]  The average person doesn't even know it's already all being unified.
[02:12:32.917 --> 02:12:34.598]  It's already being standardized.
[02:12:34.598 --> 02:12:39.960]  Everything from test scores to power prices to security protocols.
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:41.541]  It's all happening.
[02:12:41.541 --> 02:12:43.242]  It's all systematic.
[02:12:43.242 --> 02:12:44.362]  Want a new iPhone?
[02:12:44.362 --> 02:12:47.224]  You're going to have to biometrically thumbprint.
[02:12:47.224 --> 02:12:48.804]  You can't put a number into it.
[02:12:48.804 --> 02:12:51.706]  You're going to have to biometrically imprint and it's going to sell that data.
[02:12:52.606 --> 02:12:56.168]  To all the other companies to prepare everyone for the cashless society.
[02:12:56.168 --> 02:13:02.853]  And once that's in place, they can catch you, they can track you, they can turn off your buying and selling with your hand.
[02:13:02.853 --> 02:13:06.415]  And my son, who goes to a big church here in Austin, I think the preacher's a good guy.
[02:13:06.415 --> 02:13:08.237]  I'm not judging him.
[02:13:08.237 --> 02:13:12.419]  I think he has overall good, you know, just basic Bible church doctrine.
[02:13:12.419 --> 02:13:18.403]  But they're like, oh, we're putting in Xbox, you know, Kinects, clearly faith based initiative funding.
[02:13:18.403 --> 02:13:22.226]  And my son's like, but these things watch you and face scan you and voice print.
[02:13:22.666 --> 02:13:28.731]  And they go, well that's fine, they can watch us teach the teachings of Jesus.
[02:13:28.731 --> 02:13:36.396]  Now Sunday school, to get more kids there, is going to be video games.
[02:13:36.396 --> 02:13:42.240]  So do anything to spread the gospel, but then it isn't the gospel anymore.
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:48.085]  And then you go to church, you go to church like four times, you can see every four times it's a Homeland Security sermon.
[02:13:48.085 --> 02:13:49.786]  And you can't go anywhere.
[02:13:52.025 --> 02:13:54.126]  We try to go to a little Baptist church.
[02:13:54.126 --> 02:13:55.207]  Really nice, sweet people.
[02:13:55.207 --> 02:13:57.128]  Still, it's a government worship sermon.
[02:13:57.128 --> 02:13:57.768]  I just can't go.
[02:13:57.768 --> 02:13:58.849]  I told my wife.
[02:13:58.849 --> 02:14:05.072]  I go to this other big church with her.
[02:14:05.072 --> 02:14:09.674]  And it's all basically go along with the system stuff.
[02:14:09.674 --> 02:14:12.456]  Like, it's okay as long as your soul gets all right.
[02:14:12.456 --> 02:14:13.256]  You're gonna be all right.
[02:14:13.256 --> 02:14:15.237]  Well, you know what Christ is gonna say to people like that?
[02:14:15.237 --> 02:14:16.037]  I'm not judging people.
[02:14:16.037 --> 02:14:17.118]  It's just a fact.
[02:14:17.118 --> 02:14:18.579]  My spirit tells me right off the bat.
[02:14:19.361 --> 02:14:24.986]  You didn't go out and fight the evil toe-to-toe and admit what was going on?
[02:14:24.986 --> 02:14:25.847]  I don't know who you are.
[02:14:25.847 --> 02:14:32.914]  I mean, Jesus Christ went out and got in the face of the tyrants and rebuked them and stood against them.
[02:14:32.914 --> 02:14:37.157]  And then didn't resist in the end to show the sacrifice.
[02:14:37.157 --> 02:14:40.480]  So they try to spin that and say, oh look, be Christlike, let them abuse you.
[02:14:41.411 --> 02:14:43.092]  Christ did different things at different times.
[02:14:43.092 --> 02:14:47.015]  When he said to his disciples, most people are going to hear me and they're not going to understand.
[02:14:47.015 --> 02:14:49.637]  They said, why do you speak in these parables and these codes?
[02:14:49.637 --> 02:14:53.920]  He goes, because the profane aren't supposed to understand this.
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:59.104]  Only those that have spiritual discernment are supposed to be able to hear what I'm saying and then they will understand it.
[02:14:59.104 --> 02:15:03.027]  Each time is an example of how to deal with things at different points.
[02:15:08.029 --> 02:15:13.550]  Then they say you don't need to follow the Old Testament, even though Christ said, I've come not to get rid of the Old Testament, but to fulfill it.
[02:15:13.550 --> 02:15:16.231]  I mean, and I'm not going to sit there and try to argue with these preachers.
[02:15:16.231 --> 02:15:18.512]  We've got a big preacher coming on Friday, by the way.
[02:15:18.512 --> 02:15:19.512]  I'm going to just leave it at that.
[02:15:19.512 --> 02:15:21.332]  We've got some other really big guests.
[02:15:21.332 --> 02:15:27.274]  But I don't like to say we have big guests coming on.
[02:15:27.274 --> 02:15:28.534]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:15:28.534 --> 02:15:31.375]  Because then people run and try to stop them.
[02:15:31.375 --> 02:15:36.716]  It's like Chuck Yeager, we found out, was familiar with the show, likes some of the things I've done.
[02:15:38.083 --> 02:15:39.624]  He wants to come on the show.
[02:15:39.624 --> 02:15:42.306]  We were contacted by Chuck Yeager's people.
[02:15:42.306 --> 02:15:45.768]  Chuck Yeager, the living John Wayne, the real deal.
[02:15:45.768 --> 02:15:46.948]  Broke the sound barrier, all that.
[02:15:46.948 --> 02:15:49.190]  Kids are like, who's Chuck Yeager?
[02:15:49.190 --> 02:15:50.430]  World War II fighter ace.
[02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:52.251]  I mean, just amazing, amazing.
[02:15:52.251 --> 02:15:53.892]  That's about as big as it gets, okay?
[02:15:53.892 --> 02:15:56.314]  I want to meet somebody like that from my grandfather's generation.
[02:15:56.314 --> 02:15:59.796]  You know, that chewed some of the same dirt, literally.
[02:15:59.796 --> 02:16:01.377]  And my grandfathers have been dead a long time.
[02:16:01.377 --> 02:16:03.938]  This is a 90-something years old still jumping out of airplanes.
[02:16:03.938 --> 02:16:05.619]  Broke the sound barrier, everything else.
[02:16:05.619 --> 02:16:06.160]  Amazing guy.
[02:16:07.102 --> 02:16:14.024]  And then, sure enough, Chuck Yeager's lawyer says, oh, I need to go on that show with you when you do it.
[02:16:14.024 --> 02:16:18.425]  And then, oh, you know what, maybe you don't need to do that.
[02:16:18.425 --> 02:16:24.667]  Born September, no, no, this day in aviation, September 11th, 1920 is what they're talking about on the site.
[02:16:24.667 --> 02:16:27.888]  You know who was born on September 11th?
[02:16:27.888 --> 02:16:30.168]  Assad.
[02:16:30.168 --> 02:16:31.889]  So, I mean, that's the kind of stuff I deal with.
[02:16:32.694 --> 02:16:37.895]  Where all the time, people a lot more famous than Chuck Yeager contact us and want to come on, and then they get scared to come on.
[02:16:37.895 --> 02:16:41.136]  Well, oh my gosh, that's the guy that says the government runs Al Qaeda.
[02:16:41.136 --> 02:16:43.156]  That's the guy that says 9-11's an inside job.
[02:16:43.156 --> 02:16:45.117]  It was an inside job!
[02:16:45.117 --> 02:16:48.997]  Doesn't mean Bush is over there with the plunger like Wile E. Coyote doing it.
[02:16:48.997 --> 02:16:50.638]  He reads off a teleprompter.
[02:16:50.638 --> 02:16:57.139]  But the shadowy globalist forces have their fingerprints all over it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:57.139 --> 02:17:01.020]  And so that's why a lot of times I don't announce who the big guest is until they directly come on the show.
[02:17:05.925 --> 02:17:06.646]  Oh, look at this.
[02:17:06.646 --> 02:17:09.228]  Outrage over timing of Logan Airport drill.
[02:17:09.228 --> 02:17:13.992]  This is out of CBS News.
[02:17:13.992 --> 02:17:19.657]  The Massachusetts Port Authority conducted a drill Wednesday morning invoking smoke, involving smoke and fire on the runway.
[02:17:19.657 --> 02:17:28.565]  Yeah, they do these to terrorize you, to create the perception, because there's no real terror that they don't run, so they do it to drill the locals to make sure they've been federalized.
[02:17:29.810 --> 02:17:32.712]  Boston Logan tweeted the smoke and fire was part of a drill.
[02:17:32.712 --> 02:17:33.492]  Heavy black smoke.
[02:17:33.492 --> 02:17:35.153]  But see, they do it very quietly.
[02:17:35.153 --> 02:17:39.496]  I've been to drills where they announce that Belton, Texas was attacked by terrorists.
[02:17:39.496 --> 02:17:40.897]  And they even had blown up kids.
[02:17:40.897 --> 02:17:46.300]  And when I was at the H-E-B getting waters before I went down to the drill, because I knew it was going to be happening, people were like, did you hear?
[02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:47.721]  They hit us.
[02:17:47.721 --> 02:17:48.822]  I was running around H-E-B.
[02:17:48.822 --> 02:17:51.123]  I mean, I have footage of this in my film Road to Tyranny.
[02:17:51.123 --> 02:17:54.946]  Everybody's running around the H-E-B.
[02:17:54.946 --> 02:17:58.688]  For those that don't know, that's a big grocery store chain.
[02:18:00.435 --> 02:18:01.936]  And they're running around all scared.
[02:18:01.936 --> 02:18:06.637]  I'm like, man, I knew there was a drill going on for my tip, but let me get down here.
[02:18:06.637 --> 02:18:08.538]  And I get down there and the U.S.
[02:18:08.538 --> 02:18:11.359]  Army and the Marines walk over, officers, and they're like, you can't have cameras here.
[02:18:11.359 --> 02:18:12.239]  And I go, First Amendment.
[02:18:12.239 --> 02:18:12.780]  They go, ooh.
[02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:18.462]  And then they had some Army soldier come over and go, ah, you guys found us at an Army checkpoint last year.
[02:18:18.462 --> 02:18:20.602]  I didn't like you filming me.
[02:18:20.602 --> 02:18:21.883]  You can't film me now.
[02:18:21.883 --> 02:18:23.804]  And I said, I'll film you whenever I want.
[02:18:23.804 --> 02:18:25.404]  He's like, terrorist might come after me.
[02:18:25.404 --> 02:18:26.084]  I go, terrorist?
[02:18:26.084 --> 02:18:26.705]  Our government runs?
[02:18:26.705 --> 02:18:27.145]  He's like, yeah.
[02:18:28.373 --> 02:18:29.574]  Well, we've got this on footage.
[02:18:29.574 --> 02:18:32.615]  It's in the film.
[02:18:32.615 --> 02:18:35.617]  And then they had the mayor announce the terror attack like it was ready.
[02:18:35.617 --> 02:18:37.918]  And the next day they had an article.
[02:18:37.918 --> 02:18:41.339]  Town hit by terrorists and the last line said it was a drill.
[02:18:41.339 --> 02:18:42.240]  And that's what this is.
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:43.621]  Psych warfare.
[02:18:43.621 --> 02:18:48.203]  The whole country is a giant re-education camp, folks.
[02:18:48.203 --> 02:18:50.024]  And you know who's really brainwashed?
[02:18:50.024 --> 02:18:50.564]  It's the cops.
[02:18:50.564 --> 02:18:52.245]  They tell cops all the time it's a real terror threat.
[02:18:53.186 --> 02:18:55.646]  There are real terror threats, and the globalists run them.
[02:18:55.646 --> 02:18:58.187]  When they want to blow something up, it's gonna get blown up.
[02:18:58.187 --> 02:19:02.168]  They're gonna have a drill to make sure all the cops are where they want them that day.
[02:19:02.168 --> 02:19:10.869]  So the feds run the drill, so they have everybody placed, and then if their people get caught, oh, oh, it was just a drill.
[02:19:10.869 --> 02:19:12.269]  See how that works?
[02:19:12.269 --> 02:19:14.450]  Just a drill.
[02:19:14.450 --> 02:19:22.271]  The tweet sparked several other tweets asking why authorities, they're not servants, they're authorities, would choose September 11th to conduct a drill involving a plane and on fire.
[02:19:24.713 --> 02:19:25.775]  A plane on fire.
[02:19:25.775 --> 02:19:30.062]  Dozens of people also took to Boston Logan's airport Facebook page to complain about the poor timing.
[02:19:30.062 --> 02:19:31.264]  And we had a call about this earlier.
[02:19:31.264 --> 02:19:33.267]  I didn't know what they were talking about.
[02:19:33.267 --> 02:19:36.092]  We'll get this story up on Infowars.com, but that's what that's about.
[02:19:36.092 --> 02:19:37.555]  Alright, we're gonna get Edwin Vieira on.
[02:19:37.555 --> 02:19:38.035]  Is he on yet?
[02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:44.292]  Okay, we're going to come to him about 45 after, get an update on impeachment and other constitutional issues.
[02:19:44.292 --> 02:19:55.496]  I promise we're going to go to Cynthia, and we're going to go to Howie, and Alicia, and Michael, and Phil, and everybody else.

[02:22:27.785 --> 02:22:29.466]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[02:22:30.026 --> 02:22:39.333]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:22:39.333 --> 02:22:40.133]  This capitalism?
[02:22:40.133 --> 02:22:46.298]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:46.298 --> 02:22:50.000]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:50.941]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.941 --> 02:22:52.002]  It's time to understand the system.

[02:22:52.642 --> 02:22:52.922]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:59.747 --> 02:23:00.608]  My name's Bruno.
[02:23:00.608 --> 02:23:01.990]  I'm 52 years old.
[02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:05.614]  I've tried different protein powders over the years and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[02:23:05.614 --> 02:23:07.896]  I tried One World Way and found it to be delicious.
[02:23:07.896 --> 02:23:13.863]  After 10 weeks on One World Way, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than when you were 20 years old.
[02:23:13.863 --> 02:23:15.425]  My body has changed dramatically.
[02:23:15.965 --> 02:23:16.866]  I'm a cyclist.
[02:23:16.866 --> 02:23:19.887]  Normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[02:23:19.887 --> 02:23:30.032]  After being on One World Way, I rode ten days in a row in over 100 degree heat, and then I'd take another two servings of One World Way, and then work out at the gym for another hour and a half.
[02:23:30.032 --> 02:23:32.213]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[02:23:32.213 --> 02:23:36.396]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[02:23:36.396 --> 02:23:37.896]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:23:37.896 --> 02:23:39.937]  One World Way comes in single servings.
[02:23:39.937 --> 02:23:40.818]  Just give it a try.
[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:44.561]  For a health and taste sensation you'll love, call 888-988-3325.
[02:23:44.561 --> 02:23:44.842]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:44.842 --> 02:23:45.402]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:45.402 --> 02:23:46.242]  Or visit oneworldway.com.
[02:23:46.242 --> 02:23:47.383]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[02:24:38.919 --> 02:24:39.479]  That's right.
[02:24:39.479 --> 02:24:40.179]  Illegally.
[02:24:40.179 --> 02:24:41.660]  Big Brother.
[02:24:41.660 --> 02:24:44.100]  With thousands of corporations spy on everything we do.
[02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:48.382]  And use it to fix markets, to rig elections.
[02:24:48.382 --> 02:24:51.222]  It's all on record.
[02:24:51.222 --> 02:24:55.363]  And now the establishment knows that we're watching them right back and we know who they are.
[02:24:55.363 --> 02:24:58.784]  I think the huge political awakening has begun.
[02:24:58.784 --> 02:25:04.386]  I wanted to get Dr. Edwin Vieira, Harvard Law School constitutional lawyer,
[02:25:06.187 --> 02:25:16.454]  Also a graduate of Arts and Sciences from Harvard and one of the top advisors to Congress on the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[02:25:16.454 --> 02:25:18.696]  He's also a best-selling author.
[02:25:18.696 --> 02:25:24.040]  You just type in Edwin Vieira and find all of his latest books.
[02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:33.946]  They're invaluable and he's really helped develop a lot of the modern ideas of nullification and things that we're seeing all across the United States, starting in Virginia, starting in Colorado.
[02:25:35.106 --> 02:25:37.108]  Other areas.
[02:25:37.108 --> 02:25:41.131]  The recalls of people that are trying to disarm the people they would enslave.
[02:25:41.131 --> 02:25:42.251]  This is a short segment.
[02:25:42.251 --> 02:25:46.214]  He'll be with us for part of the next and he'll be gone and we'll go back to your calls.
[02:25:46.214 --> 02:25:53.300]  But I wanted to get him on about Walter Jones's resolution of Obama hit Syria without authorization impeaching him.
[02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:58.564]  But all the other things that are going on and also the fact that they've already been arming Al Qaeda.
[02:25:59.551 --> 02:26:03.172]  But Obama has now admitted this in speeches, which we already knew, but it's good to have that.
[02:26:03.172 --> 02:26:07.954]  Why not impeach him for arming groups that actually call themselves the Osama Bin Laden Brigade?
[02:26:07.954 --> 02:26:09.374]  I mean, we have him.
[02:26:09.374 --> 02:26:11.695]  We have them.
[02:26:11.695 --> 02:26:17.096]  And I wanted to get your take on the awakening that's happening, how big it is.
[02:26:17.096 --> 02:26:18.377]  Is this a major realignment?
[02:26:18.377 --> 02:26:21.518]  Is the American empire about to fall like the Soviet Union?
[02:26:21.518 --> 02:26:23.939]  I wanted to get his take on that and where he thinks we are.
[02:26:23.939 --> 02:26:25.079]  Doctor, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:26:27.285 --> 02:26:29.207]  So I just threw out a whole cornucopia of issues.
[02:26:29.207 --> 02:26:32.690]  Where do you think we are right now?
[02:26:32.690 --> 02:26:35.753]  Well, we're in the septic tank and going down for the second time.
[02:26:35.753 --> 02:26:39.636]  Not quite the third, but we're in serious trouble.
[02:26:39.636 --> 02:26:47.823]  I still wait to have someone instruct me as to how you impeach an individual who may not be eligible for the office from which you want to impeach him.
[02:26:47.823 --> 02:26:50.526]  That seems to be a more interesting problem.
[02:26:50.526 --> 02:26:53.168]  But assuming, for purposes of argument,
[02:26:54.565 --> 02:27:02.411]  That they could, in the House of Representatives, Judiciary Committee and the House of Representatives, vote for a bill of impeachment.
[02:27:02.411 --> 02:27:14.138]  At least it would tend to raise some of these immediate issues of the problems of the, essentially the overweening of imperial presidency.
[02:27:14.138 --> 02:27:18.721]  The great difficulty in the long run, of course, is how could they possibly succeed in the Senate?
[02:27:18.721 --> 02:27:21.383]  It would be something of a fiasco in the Senate.
[02:27:21.383 --> 02:27:23.865]  But it might tend to galvanize people in the country around
[02:27:24.594 --> 02:27:32.718]  These other problems popularize these issues, and then we could work on it from another direction.
[02:27:32.718 --> 02:27:37.180]  Well, I think, you know, having the whole House debate and then a vote might shame the Senate.
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:41.341]  I mean, what about them saying NATO's over our military last year and sending letters out?
[02:27:41.341 --> 02:27:44.563]  Isn't that impeachable right there?
[02:27:44.563 --> 02:27:51.606]  Well, my goodness, almost everything he's done in the foreign policy area in the last, let's say, six months to a year,
[02:27:52.364 --> 02:28:18.003]  Has been impeachable, but I would think, though, that when he came out with this concept of official assassinations, and then Eric Holder, the Attorney General, way back when, more than a year ago, attempted to defend it at Northwestern University School of Law, and then more recently there was essentially a white paper put out by the Justice Department, that that would have triggered something extraordinarily serious, because
[02:28:18.783 --> 02:28:25.925]  That, of course, that concept, of course, is traceable directly back to an individual named Adolf Hitler.
[02:28:25.925 --> 02:28:32.848]  In 1934, that was one of the great breakpoints in the German legal and political system.
[02:28:32.848 --> 02:28:34.688]  Almost every historian will look back at that.
[02:28:34.688 --> 02:28:36.489]  That's the Führer Precept, correct?
[02:28:36.489 --> 02:28:37.690]  Excuse me?
[02:28:37.690 --> 02:28:38.750]  That's the Führer Precept?
[02:28:39.645 --> 02:28:47.211]  Well, it was his concept that he was, as he said, the Obersturmbannrichter of the German people, the supreme lawgiver of the German people.
[02:28:47.211 --> 02:28:51.374]  This was after the Rem Purge in 1934.
[02:28:51.374 --> 02:28:55.657]  He comes before the Reichstag explaining what he had done and the murder of these people.
[02:28:55.657 --> 02:29:03.303]  And he said, well, at that moment I became the supreme lawgiver of the German people and I can simply shoot down anyone who dares to raise his hand against the state.
[02:29:03.303 --> 02:29:06.246]  So it was the expression of this official assassinations policy.
[02:29:06.246 --> 02:29:07.687]  And now we have the same thing, of course.
[02:29:08.147 --> 02:29:08.468]  I don't know.
[02:29:23.929 --> 02:29:26.131]  But apparently nobody seemed to care about that.
[02:29:26.131 --> 02:29:26.831]  Now, wait a minute.
[02:29:26.831 --> 02:29:27.892]  That's a little racist.
[02:29:27.892 --> 02:29:30.133]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:29:30.133 --> 02:29:31.394]  That's the answer to anything.
[02:29:31.394 --> 02:29:33.656]  Hey, Obamacare has ripped my insurance companies, ripped me off.
[02:29:33.656 --> 02:29:34.576]  Racist.
[02:29:34.576 --> 02:29:35.717]  Hey, don't take my guns.
[02:29:35.717 --> 02:29:36.878]  Racist.
[02:29:36.878 --> 02:29:38.239]  Hey, we shouldn't be like Hitler.
[02:29:38.239 --> 02:29:38.719]  Racist.
[02:29:38.719 --> 02:29:39.319]  Come on.
[02:29:39.319 --> 02:29:42.441]  Not supporting Hitler policies, Dr. Edwin Vieira is racist.

[02:32:05.157 --> 02:32:06.418]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:06.418 --> 02:32:10.282]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:10.282 --> 02:32:12.584]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:12.584 --> 02:32:18.449]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:18.449 --> 02:32:24.675]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.

[02:33:17.810 --> 02:33:20.651]  We've got a top constitutional lawyer on with us, Dr. Edward Vieira.
[02:33:20.651 --> 02:33:25.914]  We're going to talk about how he would move to try to block Obama immediately before he starts World War III.
[02:33:25.914 --> 02:33:33.177]  And societally, if he's seeing the same mass awakening I'm seeing, and if the loss in confidence in the system signifies a turning point...
[02:33:34.037 --> 02:33:52.959]  And you know where he thinks this is all basically going and then back to your calls I will get to everybody that is patiently holding like Phil and Alicia and Howie and Cynthia and everybody we will get to you here on this special September 11th worldwide broadcast and on the nightly news tonight we'll know what happened today as two million motorcyclists showed up in
[02:33:53.960 --> 02:34:04.844]  DC they wouldn't give them the permits they came anyways, but everybody every other group is allowed to have these they've had these before on the same date, so All the persecution we've seen we're talking about that in a moment.
[02:34:04.844 --> 02:34:05.504]  Don't forget.
[02:34:05.504 --> 02:34:11.846]  We have the most quality made products at the lowest prices whether they're non
[02:34:12.506 --> 02:34:18.750]  GMO, heirloom, quality organic seeds from fruit trees down to corn to everything.
[02:34:18.750 --> 02:34:26.774]  I mean, we've got the biggest selection at the lowest prices at the InfoWare Seed Center and InfoWareStore.com makes great gifts as well.
[02:34:26.774 --> 02:34:32.317]  Hundreds of the top films, the most informative titles you won't find anywhere else in many cases.
[02:34:32.317 --> 02:34:34.679]  We've got the Pro Pure Water Filtration Systems.
[02:34:35.399 --> 02:34:39.322]  At the absolute lowest price with promo code WATERTHELIFESTRAW
[02:35:05.799 --> 02:35:11.882]  And force the mainstream media, who is falling apart, to basically look at the real issue that we're putting out.
[02:35:11.882 --> 02:35:13.003]  Our narrative is reality.
[02:35:13.003 --> 02:35:14.304]  Their narrative is deception.
[02:35:14.304 --> 02:35:20.887]  You can get the magazine, the September issue on political correctness, a special issue exposing what an authoritarianism it is.
[02:35:20.887 --> 02:35:24.549]  It's all available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:35:24.549 --> 02:35:26.870]  And we have the September issue up there in bulk at cost.
[02:35:26.870 --> 02:35:28.311]  Great way to deprogram people.
[02:35:28.311 --> 02:35:30.452]  It has Obama on the front as Christ.
[02:35:31.488 --> 02:35:36.115]  As the media is portraying him, saying thou shall have no gods above the state.
[02:35:36.115 --> 02:35:41.363]  Or no gods before the state, but we use the common vernacular of above the state.
[02:35:41.363 --> 02:35:42.184]  So there it is.
[02:35:42.184 --> 02:35:45.409]  It's very blasphemous, very heretical, very evil.
[02:35:46.246 --> 02:35:51.427]  I mean, if Obama's Christ, we're almost like Anton LaVey here.
[02:35:51.427 --> 02:35:53.808]  But he's actually like the devil, so we're trying to be Christ-like here.
[02:35:53.808 --> 02:35:57.568]  But the point is that this is a very special issue.
[02:35:57.568 --> 02:36:02.229]  Infowarsstore.com, or you can call and get a subscription, or buy it in bulk to give to people.
[02:36:02.229 --> 02:36:04.170]  It's like a big colored book to give somebody.
[02:36:04.170 --> 02:36:04.670]  At cost, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:36:11.591 --> 02:36:15.834]  And you've written the latest best-selling book, How to Dethrone the Imperial Judiciary.
[02:36:15.834 --> 02:36:27.082]  In the 10 minutes we have left with you, Dr. Vieira, I want to just get into all the outrages, the persecuting the press, the using the NSA, being caught, Benghazigate, all the lies.
[02:36:29.003 --> 02:36:33.925]  I mean, the Congress knows they have hundreds of reasons, literally hundreds, to impeach Obama.
[02:36:33.925 --> 02:36:37.367]  And if they don't, it sets the precedent, as you know, for them to get away with bloody murder.
[02:36:37.367 --> 02:36:39.988]  So what would you do right now?
[02:36:39.988 --> 02:36:48.452]  What would you tell the people to do to really aggressively try to dethrone this entire imperial system?
[02:36:49.502 --> 02:36:54.767]  Well, the long-run solution to this is what I've been suggesting for many years.
[02:36:54.767 --> 02:36:57.069]  It doesn't seem to be getting very far.
[02:36:57.069 --> 02:36:59.971]  Read the first 13 words of the Second Amendment.
[02:36:59.971 --> 02:37:06.737]  If that's too much for you, then I think you should move to North Korea, because you'll be living in a society that's more congenial with your opinions.
[02:37:07.618 --> 02:37:08.699]  This is our difficulty.
[02:37:08.699 --> 02:37:16.504]  The people do not have the institutions that are necessary to apply direct control to the governmental apparatus.
[02:37:16.504 --> 02:37:28.092]  But if you want to bring it at the governmental apparatus level, assuming now, of course, that we're going to get some action out of the House of Representatives to begin with, the first thing that I would do is open up an investigation into who this fellow is.
[02:37:28.092 --> 02:37:29.253]  We don't even know who he is.
[02:37:29.253 --> 02:37:30.614]  We don't even know what his background is.
[02:37:30.614 --> 02:37:33.035]  We don't know what his credentials are.
[02:37:33.035 --> 02:37:33.816]  All of this is hidden.
[02:37:34.872 --> 02:37:37.934]  That's the first level, because that solves the impeachment problem.
[02:37:37.934 --> 02:37:40.955]  You don't impeach a person who's ineligible for the presidency.
[02:37:40.955 --> 02:37:47.119]  Then the second level, if you want to take the impeachment route, because we have a huge list of impeachable offenses.
[02:37:47.119 --> 02:37:52.522]  Of course, the most recent one is the threat to engage in aggression against Syria.
[02:37:52.522 --> 02:38:00.907]  But going way back in this administration, and start bringing those to the attention of the American people in some great detail.
[02:38:02.180 --> 02:38:15.546]  On the assumption, again, as you suggested earlier, Alex, that perhaps the Senate would be shamed into holding a proper trial once the House has put through a bill of impeachment, at least a proper trial on some of these issues.
[02:38:15.546 --> 02:38:24.029]  But eventually you come back to the main problem, that in a self-governing society, the people themselves have to take direct action.
[02:38:25.062 --> 02:38:27.684]  Self-government is not a spectator sport, I like to say.
[02:38:27.684 --> 02:38:34.929]  You can't sit on the bench and simply watch somebody else on the team playing, and when they fail and fail and fail, refuse to do anything.
[02:38:34.929 --> 02:38:36.510]  And that's our grave difficulty.
[02:38:36.510 --> 02:38:43.674]  We're spinning the same wheels over and over again, electing the same type of people to Congress, and expecting that the result will change.
[02:38:43.674 --> 02:38:49.718]  And I think it was Einstein that's given credit for saying, well, that kind of behavior is a manifestation of insanity, or the definition of insanity.
[02:38:50.478 --> 02:39:03.051]  So I keep trying to bring people back to the recognition that the Constitution sets out a certain structure, which ultimately leaves political power in the hands of the people themselves.
[02:39:03.051 --> 02:39:10.358]  Now, if they are not willing to take advantage of that, then the result will be that the entire constitutional structure will fail.
[02:39:10.358 --> 02:39:14.202]  You can't have a building designed by architects, have five support columns,
[02:39:15.134 --> 02:39:15.674]  I don't think so.
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:37.564]  You go back to the Second Amendment concept of the well-regulated militia, which is the people organized a certain way.
[02:39:37.564 --> 02:39:47.511]  It's not only in the Second Amendment, it's in the original Constitution, the body of the Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, Clauses 15 and 16, Article 2, Section 1, Clause 1.
[02:39:47.511 --> 02:39:57.637]  That structure was not created simply because the Founding Fathers had nothing better to do with those lines or the space in the Constitution.
[02:39:57.637 --> 02:39:58.858]  But it requires
[02:39:59.838 --> 02:40:02.879]  The people to participate directly.
[02:40:02.879 --> 02:40:10.682]  If they refuse to do that, if they refuse to be a self-governing people, then for sure someone else is going to come along to govern them.
[02:40:10.682 --> 02:40:12.142]  And that's what we're seeing.
[02:40:12.142 --> 02:40:22.946]  They're seeing government, as it were, of extra from the outside, not by the people themselves, and we're getting results that are totally adverse to what the people want, in fact antagonistic.
[02:40:23.166 --> 02:40:27.131]  And of course, Doctor, I mean, as a lawyer, you're stating the very basis of law.
[02:40:27.131 --> 02:40:31.175]  Maybe you can restate it for average folks out there like myself.
[02:40:31.175 --> 02:40:37.322]  That in law, if you don't demand the rights, stand up for them vigorously, it's not even considered it's there.
[02:40:37.322 --> 02:40:38.664]  And so we just expect...
[02:40:39.184 --> 02:40:42.865]  The system won't be overrun with criminals if we just lay on our backs.
[02:40:42.865 --> 02:40:47.786]  We will become slaves if we just lay down to every user or patient.
[02:40:47.786 --> 02:40:49.146]  So it really does fall to the people.
[02:40:49.146 --> 02:40:57.648]  And look at how 91% public opinion in Reuters polls and things out there showing similar numbers against this war has actually stopped it.
[02:40:57.648 --> 02:40:59.629]  Because public opinion does matter.
[02:40:59.629 --> 02:41:00.449]  The will.
[02:41:00.449 --> 02:41:03.410]  If we just lightly resist in a mass,
[02:41:04.210 --> 02:41:05.551]  Nothing can prevail against us.
[02:41:05.551 --> 02:41:22.761]  Instead, it's been small groups of us engaging in Herculean efforts to try to move the world, but we have begun to succeed in ideas starting small, like yours, but big ideas, moving now until we become the culture.
[02:41:22.761 --> 02:41:25.923]  And I've got to tell you, sir, I think we're really making major inroads.
[02:41:25.923 --> 02:41:27.144]  I want to get your take on that.
[02:41:27.144 --> 02:41:30.086]  A. B. How do you expect the empire to strike back?
[02:41:31.172 --> 02:41:36.475]  Well, I think we're making major inroads in the sense of public awareness.
[02:41:36.475 --> 02:41:43.379]  Years ago, people weren't aware of the problem of the Federal Reserve Bank and the effect of central banking on our economy.
[02:41:43.379 --> 02:41:48.142]  They're becoming desperately aware of that now as they see the consequences of it.
[02:41:48.142 --> 02:41:52.545]  Certainly years ago, people were not worried about the development of a police state in this country.
[02:41:52.545 --> 02:41:58.168]  Now they're recognizing it all the way from the Department of Homeland Security down to their local police forces and sheriff's departments.
[02:41:58.909 --> 02:42:02.511]  So that level of education, I would call that negative education.
[02:42:02.511 --> 02:42:04.313]  They're realizing what's wrong.
[02:42:04.313 --> 02:42:09.176]  Now we need positive education in terms of how do we deal with this kind of a problem.
[02:42:09.176 --> 02:42:12.818]  And it can't be putting out each little brush fire as it arises.
[02:42:12.818 --> 02:42:24.626]  There has to be a return to institutional control by the people so that we're not constantly confronted with these blunders or essentially criminal attacks that are made on us.
[02:42:27.008 --> 02:42:37.478]  What do you do, though, when they convert to where the majority of the people at the top of government are rogue?
[02:42:37.478 --> 02:42:39.119]  That becomes a tyranny.
[02:42:39.119 --> 02:42:47.987]  What do you do when the rogue becomes the establishment and then the patriot, or the person that cares about virtuous common sense, becomes the enemy?
[02:42:47.987 --> 02:42:49.569]  See, people need to understand historically
[02:42:50.249 --> 02:42:56.795]  Evil knows that it's going to take over and have resistance, so it always tries to persecute us, and now Homeland Security.
[02:42:56.795 --> 02:43:04.863]  I think they should be impeached, all of them, that are involved in this, because they've said veterans are the number one enemy, gun owners, George Washington's bad.
[02:43:04.863 --> 02:43:10.849]  I mean, this is just, this isn't free speech, this is governmental sedition against the Republic.
[02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:13.600]  Well, that's what I think people have to recognize.
[02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:17.422]  We're reaching a breaking point in the historical continuum here.
[02:43:17.422 --> 02:43:19.922]  It's not business as usual anymore.
[02:43:19.922 --> 02:43:36.387]  We've had many kinds of rogue officials in the past, and they've done this or they've done that, but they've never come out openly and said that their enemy is essentially the American people as a whole, and that they intend to suppress, oppress, and repress the American people to whatever extent is necessary to keep them in line.
[02:43:37.047 --> 02:43:47.176]  So we have to recognize we've reached a point now where that element in the governmental apparatus has really declared itself, in a sense, at war with the American people.
[02:43:47.176 --> 02:43:56.524]  Well, the Constitution provides for that problem, or it did provide for that problem originally, but it requires popular participation in the solution.
[02:43:56.524 --> 02:44:02.570]  So I would suggest simply people go to Amazon.com, take a look at my latest book called 13 Words, short book, 120-something pages long.
[02:44:04.506 --> 02:44:10.789]  And it directs them to those 13 words and the significance of those 13 words.
[02:44:10.789 --> 02:44:21.695]  And in a few weeks, there'll be a second book called Pre-Rights, which ties all of that together with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
[02:44:21.695 --> 02:44:26.818]  And I'll tell you, Alex, I'm getting to the point where I begin to throw my hat.
[02:44:26.818 --> 02:44:32.781]  If 13 words in the Constitution are too much for the people to read and understand and act on,
[02:44:35.558 --> 02:44:37.324]  Essentially, this country is finished!
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:45.285]  But I don't believe that's true, or I wouldn't be in this exercise of preparing these materials and trying to publicize them.
[02:44:45.285 --> 02:45:04.398]  I don't believe it's true, and I believe actually that there's kind of a little light before the dawn showing up here in the extent to which, especially the Syrian event, in the extent to which people self-mobilize, you say 91% of the population, essentially self-mobilize to send Congress that message.
[02:45:06.059 --> 02:45:06.940]  And of course the real threat...
[02:45:26.306 --> 02:45:31.609]  Sure, exactly, but the real threat is the very group telling us they're doing all this for our own safety.
[02:45:31.609 --> 02:45:33.770]  The great threat is the tyranny.
[02:45:33.770 --> 02:45:38.132]  It is the dangerous servant, fearful master, running wild.
[02:45:38.132 --> 02:45:50.399]  Why do you think, is it hubris that the establishment now is so naked and foaming at the mouth, and just dripping with classical villainous activity?
[02:45:51.820 --> 02:45:58.125]  Well, it's part that, and of course it's the old statement, whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.
[02:45:58.125 --> 02:46:00.666]  But there's another thing that's involved in this.
[02:46:00.666 --> 02:46:16.478]  In the past, the establishment has always been able to buy off various segments of the American population, especially by maintaining some semblance of a working economy, so that people could believe that they had incomes and jobs and that with stability there was certain permanence.
[02:46:17.330 --> 02:46:24.516]  Well, that has all failed with the breakdown of the central banking and corrupt Wall Street speculative system.
[02:46:24.516 --> 02:46:28.259]  And now they've gone to the austerity mode, or essentially the looting mode.
[02:46:28.259 --> 02:46:36.966]  Well, in the looting mode, as an economic system, where people are driven lower and lower in their standards of living, you no longer can buy them off.
[02:46:36.966 --> 02:46:39.348]  It's impossible to buy them off.
[02:46:39.348 --> 02:46:41.290]  So now you essentially have to scare them off.
[02:46:42.023 --> 02:46:53.332]  Because if the American people are not going to stand being driven down to third world standards, then they're going in some way to respond to this, to resist, to begin to withhold the consent of the governed from this apparatus.
[02:46:53.332 --> 02:46:55.113]  So you just declare them the enemy?
[02:46:55.113 --> 02:46:56.834]  Yeah, they declare them the enemy.
[02:46:56.834 --> 02:47:07.663]  So they've reached this state of what I would call the mad dog stage of political control, where they recognize it's no longer possible essentially to negotiate with the people and throw them a bone.
[02:47:08.343 --> 02:47:10.045]  Because there are no more bullets to throw.
[02:47:10.045 --> 02:47:14.489]  That's exactly what Brzezinski said to the CFR, as you know, three years ago, and just wrote a book on.
[02:47:14.489 --> 02:47:22.376]  He said it's easier to kill a million of us now than to convince us or buy us, because their authoritarian system kills the prosperity.
[02:47:22.376 --> 02:47:23.277]  That's exactly right.
[02:47:23.277 --> 02:47:23.898]  And it's done it.
[02:47:24.498 --> 02:47:24.938]  It's done.
[02:47:24.938 --> 02:47:28.679]  I mean, this was all theoretical in the past, but we're here now.
[02:47:28.679 --> 02:47:30.139]  We're here in this economic crisis.
[02:47:30.139 --> 02:47:38.701]  We're talking about an overhang of derivatives, these phony economic wagers of trillions and trillions of dollars, impossible to pay.
[02:47:38.701 --> 02:47:41.682]  Governmental debt in the long term, impossible to pay.
[02:47:41.682 --> 02:47:49.344]  Living standards have to be driven down because they've offshored all of the good manufacturing and other productive jobs to China and other countries.
[02:47:50.004 --> 02:48:01.550]  So we're staring down the barrel of this economic shotgun, and the only way that the political apparatus can possibly see to maintain their position is repression!
[02:48:01.550 --> 02:48:04.291]  And this has been the history of the world!
[02:48:04.291 --> 02:48:17.297]  If you can't give your people, if the government can't provide welfare in the true sense, income, job, social security, in the meaningful sense, then the only way to keep people under control is to repress them!
[02:48:18.385 --> 02:48:24.230]  And then these kleptocratic hedge funds are so ruthless they even steal the police pensions.
[02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:25.491]  They're almost gone every city.
[02:48:25.491 --> 02:48:30.695]  And imagine when the enforcers learn they've been robbed.
[02:48:30.695 --> 02:48:31.535]  It's madness.
[02:48:31.535 --> 02:48:33.957]  It's sheer madness.
[02:48:33.957 --> 02:48:40.022]  Well, that's why I say we're coming to a point now where things are breaking down to the extent that you give a lot of credit to
[02:48:41.081 --> 02:48:43.202]  The powers that be for planning, right?
[02:48:43.202 --> 02:48:45.422]  They're such good planners.
[02:48:45.422 --> 02:48:51.164]  I don't think that they plan for things to get as far out of hand as they are getting.
[02:48:51.164 --> 02:48:53.645]  And this is their Achilles' heel.
[02:48:53.645 --> 02:48:59.686]  Their system depends upon their being able to, uh, essentially bait and switch the population.
[02:48:59.686 --> 02:49:02.487]  Promise them, right, promise her anything to give her arpeggio, right?
[02:49:02.487 --> 02:49:04.768]  Well, they're now incapable of giving her arpeggio!
[02:49:05.879 --> 02:49:05.939]  Oh.
[02:49:25.407 --> 02:49:27.329]  To make us poor.
[02:49:27.329 --> 02:49:29.690]  See, the madness of these guys is with agenda 21.
[02:49:29.690 --> 02:49:34.994]  They say they're going to make us poor and collectivize us for a greater good.
[02:49:34.994 --> 02:49:38.557]  But that's just an excuse for the byproduct of what their system creates.
[02:49:38.557 --> 02:49:46.322]  So they're actually trying to convince themselves that everybody's going to be poor and that they're going to have articles in the news saying it's sexy.
[02:49:46.322 --> 02:49:47.883]  And so everyone's going to put up with it.
[02:49:47.883 --> 02:49:49.705]  But it doesn't work that way.
[02:49:49.705 --> 02:49:52.287]  I think they have really lost control.
[02:49:52.287 --> 02:49:52.827]  That's right.
[02:49:53.247 --> 02:49:55.549]  And themselves are delusional, Doctor.
[02:49:55.549 --> 02:49:56.629]  That's right.
[02:49:56.629 --> 02:49:59.211]  As I say, to whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.
[02:49:59.211 --> 02:50:01.392]  And they can't convince people anywhere in the world.
[02:50:01.392 --> 02:50:03.474]  The Greeks don't believe this austerity theory.
[02:50:03.474 --> 02:50:04.595]  The Spanish don't believe it.
[02:50:04.595 --> 02:50:05.695]  The Portuguese don't believe it.
[02:50:05.695 --> 02:50:08.157]  The Italians and the French are going to rebel against it.
[02:50:08.157 --> 02:50:16.162]  Nobody believes this theory, because to believe this theory you have to be willing to go hungry and cold and without shelter and employment and so forth and so on.
[02:50:16.162 --> 02:50:20.805]  Which is completely contrary to any kind of rational thought, even at the lowest level of society.
[02:50:21.325 --> 02:50:25.890]  And they try to blame free market when it's going away from free market that did all this.
[02:50:25.890 --> 02:50:28.893]  Oh you think the Federal Reserve System is a manifestation of a free market?
[02:50:29.795 --> 02:50:34.239]  You think these derivatives that they've generated and are going to be bailed out by the U.S.
[02:50:34.239 --> 02:50:37.502]  Treasury is a manifestation of a free market?
[02:50:37.502 --> 02:50:46.409]  I mean, even the dullest American who doesn't understand the basics of economics would look at this and say, bailouts, bail-ins, what do they have to do with a free market?
[02:50:46.409 --> 02:50:47.210]  It's a monopoly.
[02:50:47.210 --> 02:50:49.592]  Doctor, can't wait to get showing your new books come out.
[02:50:49.592 --> 02:50:51.213]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:50:51.213 --> 02:50:51.914]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:50:51.914 --> 02:50:52.354]  Amazing.
[02:50:52.354 --> 02:50:53.515]  Man, he was on fire today.
[02:50:53.515 --> 02:50:53.976]  Whoa!
[02:50:53.976 --> 02:50:55.197]  I've never heard Vieira like that.
[02:50:55.757 --> 02:50:59.421]  Man, I don't want to go for another hour, but we're coming back with your calls and into overdrive.
[02:50:59.421 --> 02:51:00.482]  Cynthia, everybody stay there.
[02:51:02.478 --> 02:51:05.620]  Ceramic Body Armor is rated to stop six hits.
[02:51:05.620 --> 02:51:07.000]  But what about the seventh?
[02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:11.262]  Unlike Ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel Body Armor is proven to take hit after hit.
[02:51:11.262 --> 02:51:12.803]  And it just won't quit.
[02:51:12.803 --> 02:51:19.507]  Reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian preference, Infidel stops hundreds of hits from small arms to high-powered rifles.
[02:51:19.507 --> 02:51:21.668]  That means safety and peace of mind.

[02:51:28.111 --> 02:51:30.392]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:51:30.752 --> 02:51:31.873]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:51:31.873 --> 02:51:36.355]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:51:36.355 --> 02:51:42.077]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:51:42.077 --> 02:51:45.639]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:51:45.639 --> 02:51:48.320]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:48.320 --> 02:51:53.283]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:51:53.523 --> 02:51:54.884]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:52:00.146 --> 02:52:04.872]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:52:04.872 --> 02:52:07.995]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:52:07.995 --> 02:52:13.562]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:52:13.562 --> 02:52:15.504]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:52:15.504 --> 02:52:16.765]  We are what we eat.
[02:52:17.366 --> 02:52:21.788]  Food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:52:21.788 --> 02:52:26.011]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:52:26.011 --> 02:52:28.572]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:52:28.572 --> 02:52:34.795]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicists by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:54:13.530 --> 02:54:19.712]  Hey, remember how Michael Moore had that video about Paul Revere removed because it made fun of him?
[02:54:19.712 --> 02:54:23.112]  It got restored on YouTube after they filed a protest.
[02:54:23.112 --> 02:54:25.673]  That video is up on Infowars.com.
[02:54:25.673 --> 02:54:31.614]  Some of the news stories up on Infowars.com right now that you can check out.
[02:54:31.614 --> 02:54:34.495]  We'll get to them in a little while, but I want to go to your phone calls right now.
[02:54:34.495 --> 02:54:40.396]  We have a link to live updates on the DC bikers stand up for free speech and defy federal tyranny.
[02:54:40.396 --> 02:54:42.017]  That's up on Infowars.com.

[02:54:45.578 --> 02:54:46.418]  Thank you for holding.
[02:54:46.418 --> 02:54:48.579]  Cynthia in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:54:48.579 --> 02:54:51.219]  Welcome.
[02:54:51.219 --> 02:54:51.579]  Hi there.
[02:54:51.579 --> 02:54:52.580]  How are you doing today?
[02:54:52.580 --> 02:54:53.320]  I'm doing pretty good.
[02:54:53.320 --> 02:54:54.720]  Welcome.
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:56.261]  Yes.
[02:54:56.261 --> 02:55:04.463]  You know, every topic that you have spoke about, I have been giving very thorough investigations.
[02:55:04.463 --> 02:55:07.484]  I've been looking at everything, studying everything, 14-15 hours a day, you know, and
[02:55:11.707 --> 02:55:13.468]  Trying to put the whole picture together.
[02:55:13.468 --> 02:55:21.275]  President Kennedy said, if not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.
[02:55:21.275 --> 02:55:35.427]  And the one main and most important thing that he put emphasis on was that truthful media keep the people informed for in that respect you are surely doing your job.
[02:55:35.427 --> 02:55:39.430]  I, you know, I, it is my belief that
[02:55:40.427 --> 02:55:44.509]  The New World Order had everything to do with towers coming down.
[02:55:44.509 --> 02:55:46.270]  That was a farce.
[02:55:46.270 --> 02:55:50.773]  There was, what, $300 billion under there?
[02:55:50.773 --> 02:55:54.755]  They found $300 million of it?
[02:55:54.755 --> 02:55:58.437]  There was tens of billions in gold and most of it disappeared, yeah.
[02:55:59.631 --> 02:56:02.532]  Yeah, and, well, I'm just going by what I read.
[02:56:02.532 --> 02:56:03.313]  No, no, no, you're right.
[02:56:03.313 --> 02:56:08.195]  I mean, there's just also... Look, criminals will use any operation to do a bunch of other stuff at the same time.
[02:56:08.195 --> 02:56:09.576]  They have a lot of different interests.
[02:56:09.576 --> 02:56:10.936]  They let their buddies in.
[02:56:10.936 --> 02:56:18.119]  There was a bunch of insider trading done by the CIA director, Buzzy Krongard, of the subdirector.
[02:56:20.862 --> 02:56:24.704]  On the airline stocks right before that, I mean, it's just red-handed.
[02:56:24.704 --> 02:56:28.807]  Bare minimum, they knew exactly what was coming and opened the doors in order to stand down.
[02:56:28.807 --> 02:56:29.708]  That's the bare minimum.
[02:56:29.708 --> 02:56:38.433]  And the evidence is pretty conclusive that they were decoys, thought they were part of a drill, they nerve-gassed them, and then flew the aircraft into the buildings.
[02:56:38.433 --> 02:56:40.494]  Mar-a-Milk Control.
[02:56:40.494 --> 02:56:44.697]  Yeah, when they told Bush about it, he didn't even, they said he didn't even respond.
[02:56:45.836 --> 02:56:47.817]  He didn't even move into action.
[02:57:04.199 --> 02:57:08.063]  In New Yorker Magazine, he vetoed Cheney wanted to have U.S.
[02:57:08.063 --> 02:57:14.709]  Navy SEALs make fake, in fact they were already manufacturing them, PT boats, and have them attack U.S.
[02:57:14.709 --> 02:57:17.052]  destroyers as a provocation.
[02:57:17.052 --> 02:57:20.135]  And that got nixed reportedly by the President.
[02:57:21.124 --> 02:57:21.985]  That's what Cy Hirst said.
[02:57:21.985 --> 02:57:23.346]  He's been proving to be very accurate.
[02:57:23.346 --> 02:57:26.109]  I'm just showing you how crazy this stuff works.
[02:57:26.109 --> 02:57:34.377]  It's kind of like we romanticize the Kennedys, but Bobby Kennedy wanted to, and this has been declassified, stage a terror attack on the U.S.
[02:57:34.377 --> 02:57:37.280]  Embassy in Honduras as a pretext to invade there.
[02:57:38.234 --> 02:57:45.616]  So, uh, there's just a lot of this stuff going on and we don't know exactly who did it in there and exactly the extent.
[02:57:45.616 --> 02:57:57.460]  We just know on, you know, 12 years later, the official story, and God bless you, Cynthia, thanks for calling in, is an absolutely fabricated hoax at every level.
[02:57:57.460 --> 02:58:00.501]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Howie real quick in Pennsylvania.
[02:58:00.501 --> 02:58:00.861]  Go ahead.
[02:58:00.861 --> 02:58:05.803]  Yeah, I'm excited.
[02:58:05.803 --> 02:58:06.483]  Yep, go ahead, sir.
[02:58:07.645 --> 02:58:08.949]  Hey, yeah, I just want to call in.
[02:58:08.949 --> 02:58:09.490]  I got it.
[02:58:09.490 --> 02:58:10.894]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:58:10.894 --> 02:58:15.848]  I've been listening to you for a while and I want to say thanks for putting your videos out for free on YouTube, by the way.

[02:58:23.403 --> 02:58:24.624]  That's the main mission.
[02:58:24.624 --> 02:58:27.767]  Money is the fuel to fund us doing that.
[02:58:27.767 --> 02:58:29.228]  And we certainly need everybody's support.
[02:58:29.228 --> 02:58:29.668]  You know what?
[02:58:29.668 --> 02:58:30.909]  I've got to put you on hold and come back to you.

[02:58:53.753 --> 02:59:01.796]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:59:01.796 --> 02:59:06.719]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:59:06.719 --> 02:59:08.620]  The problem is we can't help everybody.

[03:00:26.841 --> 03:00:27.801]  Howie, you had a question?
[03:00:27.801 --> 03:00:29.141]  Go ahead, buddy.
[03:00:29.141 --> 03:00:30.201]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[03:00:30.201 --> 03:00:32.562]  Um, yeah, well I wanted to talk about, uh,
[03:00:33.089 --> 03:00:33.970]  We're good to go.
[03:00:55.562 --> 03:00:58.303]  I thought you could elaborate that a little bit better than I can.
[03:01:17.250 --> 03:01:19.171]  Because they're delusional themselves.
[03:01:19.171 --> 03:01:30.694]  Just say, OK, but look, here's a natural news story that's up on PrisonPlanet.com by Mike Adams that has 10 outrageous but true facts about vaccines the CDC and the vaccine industry don't want you to know.
[03:01:30.694 --> 03:01:41.057]  Send him the link to the CDC website with hundreds of pages of adverse reactions, including death associated with every vaccine.
[03:01:41.057 --> 03:01:42.218]  Then show him news articles
[03:01:43.218 --> 03:01:45.139]  Saying there is no side effects.
[03:01:45.139 --> 03:01:46.859]  Conspiracy theorists say it.
[03:01:46.859 --> 03:01:50.161]  See, they call you a racist or a conspiracy theorist.
[03:01:50.161 --> 03:01:56.523]  The TSA now, if you say, I don't want to be groped, I don't want my kids going to the scanner, they actually say to people,
[03:01:59.386 --> 03:02:01.168]  Oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:02:01.168 --> 03:02:04.231]  That'd be like if you went to a restaurant and said, I want cheese enchiladas, not beef.
[03:02:04.231 --> 03:02:06.894]  And they went, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:02:06.894 --> 03:02:09.197]  Or, I like black hats, not green hats.
[03:02:09.197 --> 03:02:16.625]  It's like even having an opinion is some type of mass crime now.
[03:02:17.950 --> 03:02:23.200]  So, I would go to PrisonPlanet.com, look at this article posted on Infowars.com, it's so good.
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:29.852]  10 outrageous but true facts about vaccines the CDC and the vaccine industry don't want you to know.
[03:02:31.095 --> 03:02:37.639]  And it goes through admitting the cancer viruses, admitting the brain damage, admitting all the things they've done.
[03:02:37.639 --> 03:02:46.724]  So I would send him this, this article that's on PrisonPlanet.com, or you can get it at NaturalNews.com, and I would send him that, and then I would say that I'm done.
[03:02:46.724 --> 03:02:48.165]  Okay?
[03:02:48.165 --> 03:02:52.388]  And, you know, that's the end of it.
[03:02:52.388 --> 03:02:53.549]  Alright?
[03:02:53.549 --> 03:02:59.072]  I mean, even my girlfriend's friend who is going to Japan,
[03:02:59.711 --> 03:03:09.577]  Over the summer or something and it's right by Fukushima and she said something to her and she's like, Hey, uh, don't you kind of worry about like maybe the radiation that's going on over there?
[03:03:09.577 --> 03:03:10.958]  I heard it's getting kind of bad.
[03:03:10.958 --> 03:03:15.761]  And she's like, Oh yeah, there's conspiracy theories about that that say it's bad over there.
[03:03:17.915 --> 03:03:26.802]  Yeah, I mean, look, we kind of put the people that are the dumbest in authority because they just act like they know everything when they know nothing.
[03:03:26.802 --> 03:03:30.725]  I mean, just feel sorry for people when you say Obamacare really rips us off.
[03:03:30.725 --> 03:03:31.726]  They go, hmm, racist.
[03:03:31.726 --> 03:03:37.671]  I mean, Ed Asner is a good guy, smart guy, had to come out and say, no one will speak out because they'll be called racist.
[03:03:37.671 --> 03:03:38.812]  And you're like, that sounds crazy.
[03:03:38.812 --> 03:03:41.574]  That's true.
[03:03:41.574 --> 03:03:42.174]  That's true.
[03:03:43.188 --> 03:03:46.489]  I mean, they say that the Ku Klux Klan is the NRA.
[03:03:46.489 --> 03:03:56.593]  The NRA was founded, amongst other things, on record to arm black people and teach them how to shoot.
[03:03:56.593 --> 03:03:57.953]  I mean, because the Klan was killing them.
[03:03:57.953 --> 03:04:00.014]  I mean, it's just, you know.
[03:04:00.014 --> 03:04:04.455]  And by the way, the Fox Sports guy putting that out, he knows full well what he's doing.
[03:04:04.455 --> 03:04:09.417]  They've got a new video out saying the NRA is racist today, funded by Hollywood.
[03:04:09.417 --> 03:04:12.438]  I mean, it's so just, it doesn't matter.
[03:04:13.151 --> 03:04:22.393]  They're just people that are trying to demonize you if you don't do what they want, so stop responding and acting like it matters.
[03:04:22.393 --> 03:04:26.034]  I mean, just feel sorry for people that treat you like that, bro.
[03:04:26.034 --> 03:04:27.094]  Thank you, Howie.
[03:04:27.094 --> 03:04:28.675]  We're gonna go to break, come back with more Overdrive.
[03:04:28.675 --> 03:04:32.556]  I promise to get to at least Phil, Mike, Dave, and Alicia.
[03:04:32.556 --> 03:04:36.457]  And then that'll be it for the transmission until tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:04:36.457 --> 03:04:42.018]  InfoWars Nightly News will have updates on what happened with the, you know, defying
[03:04:44.093 --> 03:04:55.851]  Defying of the DC tyrants, the Kim Jong-un wannabes on the Potomac who said they couldn't drive through the town.
[03:04:55.851 --> 03:04:57.053]  Well, they did it anyways.
[03:04:57.053 --> 03:04:58.255]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:05:01.317 --> 03:05:06.020]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[03:05:06.020 --> 03:05:09.142]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[03:05:09.142 --> 03:05:14.705]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[03:05:14.705 --> 03:05:16.646]  It all comes down to one thing.
[03:05:16.646 --> 03:05:18.267]  We are what we eat.
[03:05:18.267 --> 03:05:22.950]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[03:05:22.950 --> 03:05:27.173]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[03:05:27.173 --> 03:05:29.434]  All of this has been engineered by design.

[03:06:06.599 --> 03:06:07.320]  Listen.
[03:06:07.320 --> 03:06:11.583]  My name is Ellis, and I am 66 years old, and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[03:06:11.583 --> 03:06:14.965]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[03:06:14.965 --> 03:06:18.027]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[03:06:18.027 --> 03:06:21.390]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused, knowing the negative side effects.

[03:07:48.508 --> 03:07:53.273]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[03:07:53.273 --> 03:08:09.288]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.288 --> 03:08:12.271]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:25.936 --> 03:08:31.198]  Broadcasting worldwide, ladies and gentlemen, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, I am your host.
[03:08:31.198 --> 03:08:34.419]  It is September 11th, 2012.
[03:08:34.419 --> 03:08:35.779]  2013.
[03:08:35.779 --> 03:08:43.461]  The reason I said 2012 is it's been 12 years, and it's just so amazing that it's 2013.
[03:08:43.461 --> 03:08:45.642]  I always almost sign checks and stuff like 2007, 2010.
[03:08:45.642 --> 03:08:51.024]  It's like you just, it's hard to believe life is going by so quick.
[03:08:51.024 --> 03:08:55.365]  Hard to believe my son's almost 11, and is so incredibly smart and handsome.
[03:08:56.539 --> 03:08:59.181]  Everybody says that about their kids, but man, my son is just incredible.
[03:08:59.181 --> 03:09:02.923]  My daughters are just amazingly sweet and smart and good.
[03:09:02.923 --> 03:09:07.766]  And when I look at them, it makes me angry at the New World Order.
[03:09:07.766 --> 03:09:09.648]  I mean, I've always cared about innocent people.
[03:09:09.648 --> 03:09:12.650]  I've always wanted to be a good guy.
[03:09:12.650 --> 03:09:14.651]  I like puppy dogs.
[03:09:14.651 --> 03:09:15.612]  I like happy stuff.
[03:09:16.343 --> 03:09:19.345]  But I also have a very vicious side towards bad people, like we all do.
[03:09:19.345 --> 03:09:21.166]  It's a double-edged sword.
[03:09:21.166 --> 03:09:33.455]  But when I spend time with my children and how good and sweet they are, it makes me very mad at Miley Cyrus trying to corrupt their minds because it'll make her money.
[03:09:33.455 --> 03:09:34.496]  And then I'm not perfect, too.
[03:09:34.496 --> 03:09:36.197]  I say stuff on air and forget kids are listening.
[03:09:36.197 --> 03:09:38.759]  And, you know, before, like, oh, what's the big deal?
[03:09:38.759 --> 03:09:39.620]  Now I understand.
[03:09:41.539 --> 03:09:48.765]  How it's upsetting once you have children and you have these instincts kick in to protect them and build them up and you want a good world for them.
[03:09:48.765 --> 03:09:58.473]  And then you see the globalists trying to start World War III and you see the system eroding and getting worse and worse and thuggism growing and being institutionalized.
[03:09:58.473 --> 03:10:01.896]  And it makes you want to fight back against it and then it makes you get really angry.
[03:10:04.187 --> 03:10:08.330]  At people that make jokes and go, hey Cook, you know, vaccines aren't bad for anybody.
[03:10:08.330 --> 03:10:19.558]  When on purpose, this is a government caught putting stuff in vaccines, forcibly sterilizing people, caught doing all sorts of evil stuff, and then people will go, oh, there's nothing wrong with the vaccines.
[03:10:19.558 --> 03:10:25.862]  I saw a story debunking, you know, this doctor or that doctor.
[03:10:25.862 --> 03:10:31.907]  And then if you knew the whole story, they go create hoaxes debunking those doctors that bravely exposed vaccines.
[03:10:31.907 --> 03:10:33.648]  It turns out they were incredibly accurate.
[03:10:36.611 --> 03:10:46.116]  And that it was all paid propaganda, and that now other studies have come out proving what those studies showed.
[03:10:46.116 --> 03:10:47.136]  It's just so frustrating.
[03:10:47.136 --> 03:10:51.038]  I mean, it's a fact that the anthrax shots killed so many U.S.
[03:10:51.038 --> 03:10:52.359]  troops they had to stop giving them.
[03:10:52.359 --> 03:10:56.380]  It's a fact my uncle almost died when he took a tetanus shot at age 10.
[03:10:56.380 --> 03:11:01.463]  It's a fact that people take shots and have convulsions right there in the office.
[03:11:03.055 --> 03:11:09.778]  It's a fact they give baby shots and they go home and die, then they arrest the parent saying there's blood on their brain from the autoimmune response.
[03:11:09.778 --> 03:11:13.400]  That's been found by the Australian government.
[03:11:13.400 --> 03:11:15.220]  So they stopped arresting people there for it.
[03:11:15.220 --> 03:11:16.361]  They don't hear.
[03:11:16.361 --> 03:11:18.722]  They're not enough to kill your kid.
[03:11:18.722 --> 03:11:20.043]  They're gonna come get you.
[03:11:20.043 --> 03:11:22.044]  And of course the cop doesn't know.
[03:11:22.044 --> 03:11:24.345]  I mean, but that's what I'm saying.
[03:11:24.345 --> 03:11:25.565]  It's so sick!
[03:11:25.565 --> 03:11:29.567]  It's like always ten times worse than I could even imagine.
[03:11:31.940 --> 03:11:37.322]  And then I see pregnant women, and I just cannot help it anymore.
[03:11:37.322 --> 03:11:42.883]  And my wife and my children, God bless them, literally used to them and go, oh, dad, again?
[03:11:42.883 --> 03:11:43.963]  Oh, you're gonna make a scene?
[03:11:43.963 --> 03:11:46.084]  I just don't care anymore.
[03:11:46.084 --> 03:11:51.646]  And let me tell you, by saying I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore what people think about me.
[03:11:51.646 --> 03:11:52.646]  I care about that baby.
[03:11:53.567 --> 03:12:02.875]  And I know there's a globalist program with shots, especially early on, that's going to deform that child's heart valves, that's going to give it all sorts of cognitive problems.
[03:12:02.875 --> 03:12:04.176]  All the studies are there.
[03:12:04.176 --> 03:12:05.136]  I've read the studies.
[03:12:05.136 --> 03:12:06.277]  I've read the inserts.
[03:12:06.277 --> 03:12:09.900]  I know what I'm talking about.
[03:12:09.900 --> 03:12:19.848]  And it makes me absolutely boil, boil, with controlled rage.
[03:12:21.155 --> 03:12:25.140]  To where I don't get mad at somebody that laughs at me on the street about black helicopters.
[03:12:25.140 --> 03:12:28.083]  It happened a couple times last night at the concert.
[03:12:28.083 --> 03:12:29.585]  Oh, it's Mr. Black Helicopter!
[03:12:29.585 --> 03:12:30.686]  Like, I'm gonna feel bad.
[03:12:30.686 --> 03:12:34.050]  I feel bad for them how dumb they are.
[03:12:34.050 --> 03:12:38.254]  I feel bad for them because I'm aware of the war going on.
[03:12:38.254 --> 03:12:39.916]  The globalists all wrote books how they're doing it.
[03:12:39.916 --> 03:12:41.238]  I mean, they've confessed.
[03:12:42.841 --> 03:12:44.762]  They've confessed to their program.
[03:12:44.762 --> 03:12:47.083]  They've confessed to putting stuff in the vaccines.
[03:12:47.083 --> 03:12:53.965]  They've confessed to engineering the food with hidden viruses in the GMO RNA.
[03:12:53.965 --> 03:12:56.726]  They've confessed in the pharmacological crops.
[03:12:56.726 --> 03:12:58.827]  They've confessed.
[03:12:58.827 --> 03:13:01.708]  And I'm sitting here watching them do it to all of us.
[03:13:02.728 --> 03:13:15.438]  And I hate myself because at an animal level, I'm like, you're only talking about this and you're living an okay life and eating good food and being happy and still going to movies and only working 15 hours a day or whatever.
[03:13:15.438 --> 03:13:17.880]  You are a piece of trash, Jones.
[03:13:17.880 --> 03:13:19.461]  You have ideas and things.
[03:13:19.761 --> 03:13:22.522]  Properly deployed that could really fight the New World Order.
[03:13:22.522 --> 03:13:25.062]  You should already have your websites redesigned and upgraded.
[03:13:25.062 --> 03:13:27.483]  You should already have your TV studio done.
[03:13:27.483 --> 03:13:29.084]  You should already have all this stuff done.
[03:13:29.084 --> 03:13:30.304]  You've got the plans.
[03:13:30.304 --> 03:13:31.604]  You've got the ideas.
[03:13:31.604 --> 03:13:32.925]  You know how to beat these people.
[03:13:32.925 --> 03:13:35.165]  And you're not living up.
[03:13:35.165 --> 03:13:36.386]  And you're not a good manager.
[03:13:36.386 --> 03:13:39.346]  And you don't get the right people in the right organization.
[03:13:39.346 --> 03:13:40.607]  You've got a problem.
[03:13:40.607 --> 03:13:42.347]  You need to get yourself in gear.
[03:13:42.347 --> 03:13:44.748]  Because this is total war against you and your family.
[03:13:44.748 --> 03:13:46.228]  And your kids have no future.
[03:13:46.228 --> 03:13:48.629]  And you're helping kill them by your laziness.
[03:13:49.554 --> 03:13:53.157]  That's why I don't like you calling me up, telling me how great I am.
[03:13:53.157 --> 03:13:55.600]  This is not about narcissism, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:13:55.600 --> 03:13:57.361]  This is the opposite of that.
[03:13:57.361 --> 03:13:58.603]  This is about survival.
[03:13:58.603 --> 03:14:00.104]  This is about humanity.
[03:14:00.104 --> 03:14:02.226]  I'm not worried about my individual.
[03:14:02.226 --> 03:14:03.908]  I am only an expression of the species.
[03:14:05.114 --> 03:14:07.895]  Like part of a composite eye of a dragonfly.
[03:14:07.895 --> 03:14:09.075]  You understand that?
[03:14:09.075 --> 03:14:13.516]  I'm worried about the group, ladies and gentlemen, but that's not collectivism, that's a fraud.
[03:14:13.516 --> 03:14:25.140]  The individual worrying about the group together maximizes a true collective with the higher dimensions of humanity being held up and that's when we explode in renaissance.
[03:14:27.071 --> 03:14:34.514]  Instead, they hold up the most dumbed down, the ugliest, and tell us we have to adopt that so that we don't compete with them.
[03:14:34.514 --> 03:14:42.157]  I mean, it is fraud within fraud, lie within lie, and I literally struggle.
[03:14:43.137 --> 03:15:00.725]  With the struggle of all my ancestors and all the things they went through and the genetics and the instincts, really the race memory of the human race passed on and I am an organic, caged response to seeing what's going on.
[03:15:00.725 --> 03:15:03.927]  I mean, I see it, it's there, it's enemies admitting they're doing it to me.
[03:15:05.003 --> 03:15:06.284]  I'm just like, we've got to do something.
[03:15:06.284 --> 03:15:09.645]  We've got to organize, we've got to get involved, we've got to stand up.
[03:15:09.645 --> 03:15:12.967]  And I see the ruined humanity out there, just ruined.
[03:15:12.967 --> 03:15:18.510]  Whereas the globalists revel in this stagnant swamp that is the general population in many cases.
[03:15:19.537 --> 03:15:28.765]  Well they revel in the mosquito infested sewage pits that they've created in many cases.
[03:15:28.765 --> 03:15:31.208]  I sit there and I look at the wrecked people.
[03:15:31.208 --> 03:15:33.530]  I looked at how wrecked I am as well.
[03:15:33.530 --> 03:15:43.419]  I'm not on some high horse here and I just think about the absolute instinct of evil to wreck things because it's so low it wants to pull everything down with it.
[03:15:44.059 --> 03:15:44.839]  Okay?
[03:15:44.839 --> 03:15:47.200]  This is an absolute war.
[03:15:47.200 --> 03:15:49.480]  They're murdering everyone.
[03:15:49.480 --> 03:15:52.261]  None of you that think you're part of the power structure are winning.
[03:15:52.261 --> 03:15:52.981]  You're chumps.
[03:15:52.981 --> 03:15:55.442]  You're idiots.
[03:15:55.442 --> 03:16:00.763]  And, you know, that caller calls in with people laughing at him about being a conspiracy theorist saying vaccines are hurting people.
[03:16:00.763 --> 03:16:11.225]  I mean, it's that they, for 30 years, they've had a vaccine damage, you know, what is it, $8 billion fund now, quietly paying out all the people that die in the hospital.
[03:16:12.219 --> 03:16:18.043]  See, their big threat is they want to kill you and have you go home and your kid have a convulsion and just lower their IQ.
[03:16:18.043 --> 03:16:23.366]  But when, you know, they have a two-digit response and they die... God, it's like abortion.
[03:16:23.366 --> 03:16:26.628]  You know, it's illegal to kill the baby if it comes all the way out, so they call that the worst thing.
[03:16:26.628 --> 03:16:27.629]  They want to be able to kill the baby.
[03:16:28.868 --> 03:16:33.609]  You know, just 90% out of the womb so they can get the job done.
[03:16:33.609 --> 03:16:42.271]  And it just absolutely enrages them when they've got to chop the child up quietly, you know, tell the nurses to leave the room because they're committing a felony right there.
[03:16:42.271 --> 03:16:42.871]  It's the same thing.
[03:16:42.871 --> 03:16:49.673]  They want to make sure you go home so that baby has that blood run out of their nose at home because we're going to make some money with the police.
[03:16:50.753 --> 03:16:51.254]  Yeah!
[03:16:51.254 --> 03:16:52.575]  Let's kill that baby!
[03:16:52.575 --> 03:16:53.956]  Let's take it from the parents!
[03:16:53.956 --> 03:16:54.416]  Woo!
[03:16:54.416 --> 03:16:55.817]  It's fun!
[03:16:55.817 --> 03:16:56.438]  It's fun!
[03:16:56.438 --> 03:16:58.939]  And I sit here watching them murder everybody.
[03:16:58.939 --> 03:17:03.563]  And I sit there and see pregnant women in the grocery store or whatever, and I just go, man, I got a headache.
[03:17:03.563 --> 03:17:04.844]  I got to get somewhere.
[03:17:04.844 --> 03:17:10.108]  I'm not going to go over to that, because I look at the woman's husband, and I go, he's going to get mad if I get in his business.
[03:17:10.108 --> 03:17:14.271]  But man, I've already warned a couple people this week.
[03:17:14.271 --> 03:17:17.773]  I'll just leave it up to God and hope somebody else I've told to go warn people will tell them.
[03:17:17.773 --> 03:17:18.774]  I just can't do it today.
[03:17:21.089 --> 03:17:26.472]  I just, because I gotta go turn my charm on, and then I might have to argue with him, and it's exhausting, Gary.
[03:17:26.472 --> 03:17:32.596]  It's exhausting, but at the same time, that kid, they're gonna murder that kid if we don't do something about it.
[03:17:32.596 --> 03:17:35.158]  I wanna beat somebody's ass right now.
[03:17:35.158 --> 03:17:36.999]  You wanna get right down to the bottom line?
[03:17:36.999 --> 03:17:39.440]  I am sick of all this crap.
[03:17:39.440 --> 03:17:42.262]  I am sick of all the bullies and all the scum.
[03:17:42.262 --> 03:17:44.243]  Look, they got explosions going off and I'm getting mad.
[03:17:44.243 --> 03:17:46.405]  You guys are funny.
[03:17:46.405 --> 03:17:49.487]  I'm gonna skip this network break and just take some final calls here.
[03:17:49.487 --> 03:17:50.127]  I need to settle down.
[03:17:54.599 --> 03:17:56.300]  Look, I can't do it all, folks.
[03:17:56.300 --> 03:18:01.344]  I've done everything I can, every electronic crack I could find, to get my message out to people.
[03:18:01.344 --> 03:18:02.324]  Okay?
[03:18:02.324 --> 03:18:05.607]  I just need you to go out and be leaders and warn everybody about what's going on.
[03:18:05.607 --> 03:18:07.548]  And you're like, well, how do I do that?
[03:18:07.548 --> 03:18:16.034]  Go to the CDC's website, print out how it can kill you and all the bad things it can do, and then show people news articles saying vaccines are safe and effective.
[03:18:16.034 --> 03:18:17.415]  You'll see that everywhere.
[03:18:17.415 --> 03:18:18.176]  And go show people.
[03:18:18.176 --> 03:18:19.376]  Look, they say there's no side effects.
[03:18:19.376 --> 03:18:21.258]  Here's 100 pages right here.
[03:18:22.659 --> 03:18:30.883]  Here's the PrisonPlanet.com posting of Mike Adams' story, 10 outrageous but true facts about vaccines the CDC and the vaccine industry don't want you to do.
[03:18:30.883 --> 03:18:31.644]  You know what I want?
[03:18:31.644 --> 03:18:34.165]  I don't even have time to tell The Nightly News what I want them to cover every night.
[03:18:34.165 --> 03:18:35.906]  You know what I want covered tomorrow night?
[03:18:35.906 --> 03:18:37.607]  I want this covered tomorrow night!
[03:18:37.607 --> 03:18:39.228]  I want GMOs covered!
[03:18:39.228 --> 03:18:41.149]  I want what's going on covered!
[03:18:41.149 --> 03:18:43.830]  I want to fight these son of a bitches!
[03:18:43.830 --> 03:18:45.331]  I don't want to have half measures!
[03:18:45.331 --> 03:18:47.412]  I don't want to die and have them win!
[03:18:47.412 --> 03:18:48.593]  I'm sick of their crap!
[03:18:49.571 --> 03:18:54.675]  And I don't know how to totally beat them, but first, like Howard Beale says in Network, you've got to get mad.
[03:18:54.675 --> 03:19:02.961]  You've got to get angry, you've got to find your humanity, and you've got to start kicking some New World Order ass in the Infowar before this thing gets physical.
[03:19:02.961 --> 03:19:04.322]  But I'm not going to sit here.
[03:19:04.322 --> 03:19:05.983]  You notice it came out a month ago.
[03:19:05.983 --> 03:19:06.724]  Oh, Virginia.
[03:19:06.724 --> 03:19:07.564]  Oh, California.
[03:19:07.564 --> 03:19:12.028]  We're still sterilizing foster kids.
[03:19:12.028 --> 03:19:12.888]  First it was prisoners.
[03:19:12.888 --> 03:19:13.649]  Well, they deserve it.
[03:19:13.649 --> 03:19:14.630]  See, they're trying to sell it.
[03:19:14.630 --> 03:19:15.771]  Then it was foster kids, too.
[03:19:17.435 --> 03:19:21.739]  Yeah, well, after you rape them, they're already committing crimes everywhere.
[03:19:21.739 --> 03:19:27.645]  And you notice, you know why they come out and tell you, oh, we gave kids in Guatemala syphilis too, and vaccines.
[03:19:27.645 --> 03:19:28.746]  We apologize.
[03:19:28.746 --> 03:19:30.728]  Remember that this year, Hillary?
[03:19:30.728 --> 03:19:31.869]  They apologize.
[03:19:31.869 --> 03:19:35.894]  They're telling you to just get you used to it, to psychologically inoculate you.
[03:19:36.574 --> 03:19:48.038]  So that as all this comes out, it's like, so we gave 100 million Americans, as estimated, all these new rare cancers and a cocktail of viruses in your polio vaccine, the live vaccine we shoot up kids' noses.
[03:19:48.038 --> 03:19:50.259]  What's the big deal, pumpkin?
[03:19:50.259 --> 03:19:51.899]  Isn't dying young fun?
[03:19:51.899 --> 03:19:55.561]  I mean, these people, these people are assaulting us.
[03:19:55.561 --> 03:19:58.922]  Under common law, ladies and gentlemen, they can all be rounded up and hung.
[03:19:59.884 --> 03:20:05.386]  Okay, but they've got Homeland Security geared up to try to keep the collapse down while they murder us slow!
[03:20:05.386 --> 03:20:07.966]  They love the fact they're killing you and your family.
[03:20:07.966 --> 03:20:09.147]  They enjoy it!
[03:20:09.147 --> 03:20:11.267]  People tune into the show, they go, this guy's far out.
[03:20:11.267 --> 03:20:12.488]  I'm not far out!
[03:20:12.488 --> 03:20:15.869]  They're far out!
[03:20:15.869 --> 03:20:17.089]  That one caller set me off.
[03:20:24.506 --> 03:20:36.353]  I mean, is this an abnormal response to the fact that they have written book after book, like eco-science, what the White House science are, how they put fluoride in the water to brain damages, and they brag about it?
[03:20:36.353 --> 03:20:37.354]  And they think it's funny!
[03:20:39.110 --> 03:20:40.812]  And they think it's funny.
[03:20:40.812 --> 03:20:42.314]  I don't think it's funny.
[03:20:42.314 --> 03:20:45.658]  And then I'm bad because I'm a primitive, folks.
[03:20:45.658 --> 03:20:50.043]  I take people attacking us and poisoning our water supply like we're animals.
[03:20:50.043 --> 03:20:50.965]  I guess we are.
[03:20:50.965 --> 03:20:55.050]  And I guess the psychopath is the superior human because it runs everything.
[03:20:58.677 --> 03:20:59.798]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[03:20:59.798 --> 03:21:02.079]  They wreck everything once they get in control.
[03:21:02.079 --> 03:21:05.000]  These people are your enemy.
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:06.941]  They are never going to stop.
[03:21:06.941 --> 03:21:11.103]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[03:21:11.103 --> 03:21:26.090]  And you either wake up to that, that our government's pure evil, funding Al-Qaeda to murder Christians worldwide, running them, or you kneel to this system because you think it's popular and you just kind of go along with it and
[03:21:27.423 --> 03:21:31.424]  Have a drink on the New World Order and just sit back and drink beer and watch football?
[03:21:31.424 --> 03:21:33.365]  That's too depressing, man.
[03:21:33.365 --> 03:21:35.506]  I choose to think everything's good.
[03:21:35.506 --> 03:21:42.228]  Boy, let me tell you, hell would be locked up with a bunch of guys like that.
[03:21:42.228 --> 03:21:45.930]  Hell would be locked up with people like that that just put up with all this stuff.
[03:21:45.930 --> 03:21:46.710]  You guys aren't men.
[03:21:47.864 --> 03:21:55.871]  You are, you are, you are the equivalent of 12 year olds who watched Madison Avenue programming and were taught you weren't cool.
[03:21:55.871 --> 03:22:02.456]  So your whole life, whoever the system says, trying to be cool, trying to get acceptance, trying to be part of the system.
[03:22:02.456 --> 03:22:03.717]  There is no system.
[03:22:03.717 --> 03:22:07.421]  There's an artificial construct that they're trying to insert us into.
[03:22:07.421 --> 03:22:13.205]  And before it's completed, we have to sabotage it immediately any way we can.
[03:22:13.205 --> 03:22:15.748]  And like great white sharks, just like, um,
[03:22:16.894 --> 03:22:21.997]  Stefan Molyneux said, when humans don't see their cage, they're very easy to control.
[03:22:21.997 --> 03:22:27.880]  Once we see it, we're like great white sharks chewing through the nets.
[03:22:27.880 --> 03:22:37.125]  We just have to collectively reach out with our pinky and just shove the Newel Order and we can rip their arms out like Beowulf pulling Grendel's arm out of its socket.
[03:22:37.685 --> 03:22:40.586]  You could just blow at the New World Order if we all started doing it.
[03:22:40.586 --> 03:22:41.526]  They would fall over.
[03:22:41.526 --> 03:22:42.706]  They would burn into flame.
[03:22:42.706 --> 03:22:45.427]  Why do you think they hate us and try to dumb us down and poison us?
[03:22:45.427 --> 03:22:49.608]  Because the minute we start moving like a glacier, it will crush them.
[03:22:49.608 --> 03:22:51.228]  Do you understand that?
[03:22:51.228 --> 03:22:54.349]  These people need to be annihilated.
[03:22:54.349 --> 03:22:56.349]  And you need to understand something, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:22:56.349 --> 03:22:59.210]  I don't say that because I don't think about how I want to annihilate them.
[03:23:00.217 --> 03:23:06.139]  I'm like a mother who can pick a car up off their baby because it's screaming and begging for help that's been documented over and over again.
[03:23:06.139 --> 03:23:08.739]  It's that same instinct and that's what you need to go for.
[03:23:08.739 --> 03:23:14.981]  What you hear in my discuss with these people is the primal survival instinct to get them off of us!
[03:23:14.981 --> 03:23:16.922]  To get them off of us!
[03:23:16.922 --> 03:23:18.762]  That's what you're hearing!
[03:23:18.762 --> 03:23:20.043]  And that's what you need to have!
[03:23:20.043 --> 03:23:21.243]  You need to have that spirit!
[03:23:21.243 --> 03:23:22.803]  Get off me!
[03:23:22.803 --> 03:23:23.624]  Get off me!
[03:23:23.624 --> 03:23:24.804]  You ever had a couple bullies?
[03:23:25.942 --> 03:23:34.007]  And they get you down and really start hurting you, all of a sudden you got all that strength and you just get up and start just breaking arms, man!
[03:23:34.007 --> 03:23:36.369]  That's what I'm talking about politically!
[03:23:36.369 --> 03:23:41.072]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out!
[03:23:41.072 --> 03:23:47.536]  You're the enemy, you're the scum, you're the filth, you're the murderers, you're going down, we're never stopping!
[03:23:47.536 --> 03:23:51.559]  Hell or high water, we're going over the top and you're never gonna stop us!
[03:23:51.559 --> 03:23:52.540]  Do you understand that?
[03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:54.481]  That's what I'm talking about!
[03:23:54.481 --> 03:23:57.403]  And that's what they're scared of, is that spirit.
[03:23:57.403 --> 03:24:01.345]  And it is the spirit of 1776, and you need to ask God for it today.
[03:24:01.345 --> 03:24:03.706]  And I'm telling you, God will deliver it.
[03:24:03.706 --> 03:24:04.887]  Because you think I'm mad?
[03:24:04.887 --> 03:24:06.228]  You think you're mad?
[03:24:06.228 --> 03:24:12.352]  Can you imagine the Creator that gives us everything that's good, but has to give us free will so evil is there to test us?
[03:24:12.352 --> 03:24:17.695]  Can you imagine how much God that gives us all the good things, our children, everything?
[03:24:17.695 --> 03:24:19.716]  Can you imagine what God thinks about this?
[03:24:19.716 --> 03:24:20.797]  Can you imagine?! !
[03:24:23.882 --> 03:24:25.563]  Let's go ahead and take some phone calls here.
[03:24:25.563 --> 03:24:26.684]  Phil, you're on the air.
[03:24:26.684 --> 03:24:28.685]  Welcome.
[03:24:28.685 --> 03:24:29.405]  Hello?
[03:24:29.405 --> 03:24:31.507]  Welcome, Phil from Canada.
[03:24:31.507 --> 03:24:32.587]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[03:24:32.587 --> 03:24:34.409]  I have a tip for you here.
[03:24:34.409 --> 03:24:35.769]  I don't know if you've heard this one before.
[03:24:35.769 --> 03:24:39.592]  This is another example of 9-11 predictive programming.
[03:24:42.145 --> 03:24:43.666]  I'm sorry, say that again.
[03:24:43.666 --> 03:24:46.347]  Obama's now breaking in over our phones.
[03:24:46.347 --> 03:24:47.327]  We're getting messages.
[03:24:47.327 --> 03:24:49.668]  He's taking over, sending messages directly to cell phones.
[03:24:49.668 --> 03:24:49.948]  Sorry.
[03:24:49.948 --> 03:24:52.269]  Never hand me an article.
[03:24:52.269 --> 03:24:53.530]  Go ahead.
[03:24:53.530 --> 03:24:55.951]  9-11 news for the 12th anniversary today.
[03:24:55.951 --> 03:24:58.812]  So it's another example of predictive programming.
[03:25:00.730 --> 03:25:13.721]  It was a summer fest wrestling in 1989 and someone in the audience held up a sign that said that demolition will topple the Twin Towers and they even had a hand drawing of the Twin Towers.
[03:25:13.721 --> 03:25:15.563]  Did you know about that in 1989?
[03:25:17.543 --> 03:25:21.625]  That could be coincidence, but they definitely, it was a coincidence with all the other things I've seen.
[03:25:21.625 --> 03:25:38.113]  It may have been, it's like one thing could be coincidence, but when you got a hundred, like the Fox Lone Gunman X-Files, where the government hijacks jets by remote control, blames it on terrorists, and is gonna fly to the World Trade Center so they can attack Afghanistan, and they use a drill to confuse NORAD and make them stand down.
[03:25:38.113 --> 03:25:45.897]  And then, I was approached by the star of the show, who said the CIA came to them, this is on record, Dean Hagman, they came to them,
[03:25:47.679 --> 03:25:51.341]  And told them to put that story out.
[03:25:51.341 --> 03:25:54.263]  I mean, that's a pretty big coincidence.
[03:25:54.263 --> 03:25:56.424]  There's definitely no coincidence.
[03:25:56.424 --> 03:25:58.865]  I mean, these are devil worshippers.
[03:25:58.865 --> 03:26:02.767]  You've got to understand, they get more power if they tell you what they're going to do first.
[03:26:02.767 --> 03:26:05.008]  It's like the vampire has to be invited in.
[03:26:05.008 --> 03:26:08.450]  It's like some kind of metaphysical law.
[03:26:08.450 --> 03:26:11.152]  They believe they've got to tell you what they're going to do to you.
[03:26:11.152 --> 03:26:12.192]  Yes.
[03:26:12.192 --> 03:26:15.214]  Actually, Jesse Ventura was hosting at that time.
[03:26:16.857 --> 03:26:18.018]  Yeah, well, I know Ventura.
[03:26:18.018 --> 03:26:20.280]  He's a smart guy when it comes to the streets.
[03:26:20.280 --> 03:26:21.501]  He's learning a lot about stuff.
[03:26:21.501 --> 03:26:23.882]  He doesn't even really believe in subliminals and stuff.
[03:26:23.882 --> 03:26:29.727]  I can tell you, you know, Ventura's not part of any larger grand deal, believe me.
[03:26:29.727 --> 03:26:32.629]  But maybe he might find that interesting.
[03:26:32.629 --> 03:26:33.790]  Oh, I bet he would.
[03:26:33.790 --> 03:26:34.751]  Absolutely, I bet he would.
[03:26:34.751 --> 03:26:35.832]  I'm gonna... Sorry, go ahead.
[03:26:36.417 --> 03:26:38.138]  Oh yeah, you can type it in YouTube.
[03:26:38.138 --> 03:26:41.901]  Demolition will topple the Twin Towers and you'll see the sign I'm talking about.
[03:26:41.901 --> 03:26:44.683]  Guys, type in demolition will topple the Twin Towers.
[03:26:44.683 --> 03:26:46.224]  It'll be some WWE thing.
[03:26:46.224 --> 03:26:46.904]  Thank you so much.
[03:26:46.904 --> 03:26:50.747]  God bless you, sir.
[03:26:50.747 --> 03:26:51.908]  I shouldn't get so mad, folks.
[03:26:51.908 --> 03:26:54.009]  I mean, I'm just thinking about how it just keeps going on and on.
[03:26:54.009 --> 03:26:55.270]  I can't stop them.
[03:26:55.270 --> 03:26:57.932]  And the public's walking around in a trance and they think it's a joke.
[03:26:57.932 --> 03:27:01.014]  And I mean, it's not a joke.
[03:27:01.014 --> 03:27:05.217]  Alicia in Colorado, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[03:27:05.217 --> 03:27:05.357]  Hi.
[03:27:08.237 --> 03:27:08.557]  Hi, Alex.
[03:27:08.557 --> 03:27:11.800]  Yeah, I'm just calling here from Colorado.
[03:27:11.800 --> 03:27:16.724]  I don't know if you guys have heard about the recalls, the grassroots recalls?
[03:27:16.724 --> 03:27:17.985]  Yes, I did mention that.
[03:27:17.985 --> 03:27:18.726]  I should mention it more.
[03:27:18.726 --> 03:27:21.668]  We're going to do a report on this in the nightly news tonight.
[03:27:21.668 --> 03:27:23.910]  Colorado lawmakers ousted in recall vote.
[03:27:23.910 --> 03:27:26.052]  Now it's spreading to Virginia and other states.
[03:27:26.052 --> 03:27:26.913]  Very exciting.
[03:27:27.631 --> 03:27:45.166]  Yes, yes, it was very exciting and yeah, we're making history and I don't know if you guys heard about this, but we're going to, because Hickenlooper was kind of, there was some stuff going on with the voting, but now they're going to get together and they want to get Hickenlooper out of there, because he's also for the gun laws also.
[03:27:45.166 --> 03:27:46.507]  Yeah, they're all enemies.
[03:27:46.507 --> 03:27:51.031]  Every stinking one of them that wants our guns, they have a criminal instinct to disarm their quarry.
[03:27:53.217 --> 03:27:53.357]  Yes.
[03:27:53.357 --> 03:28:02.362]  Yeah, so I just wanted to just, yeah, touch base on that and let people know there is light at the end of the tunnel, and we're fighting it, so we're doing it.
[03:28:02.362 --> 03:28:03.523]  God bless you, ma'am.
[03:28:03.523 --> 03:28:13.889]  By the way, there was an Army drill, I just remembered, in Germany in 1979, if memory serves, where they drilled with hijacked jets flying into the World Trade Center, but then there'd be bombs in the building as well.
[03:28:13.889 --> 03:28:14.790]  I forgot about that.
[03:28:15.350 --> 03:28:16.591]  I'm just trying to remember more of these.
[03:28:16.591 --> 03:28:17.331]  Thank you so much.
[03:28:17.331 --> 03:28:17.871]  Great job.
[03:28:17.871 --> 03:28:18.891]  Yes, ma'am.
[03:28:18.891 --> 03:28:21.652]  We've got that article up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[03:28:21.652 --> 03:28:25.314]  You can follow us on Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[03:28:25.314 --> 03:28:26.274]  Very important to do that.
[03:28:26.274 --> 03:28:31.476]  You know, the trendy people get millions of followers because it's more of a trendy deal, but it's a very useful tool to spread information.
[03:28:31.476 --> 03:28:33.477]  We invite everybody to follow us on Twitter.
[03:28:33.477 --> 03:28:34.517]  Dave in Georgia.
[03:28:34.517 --> 03:28:35.538]  Last call we have time for.
[03:28:35.538 --> 03:28:37.138]  Sorry to the other folks.
[03:28:37.138 --> 03:28:37.878]  Go ahead, Dave.
[03:28:37.878 --> 03:28:38.879]  Go ahead.
[03:28:38.879 --> 03:28:40.139]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:28:42.903 --> 03:29:00.340]  I began my awakening process watching you yell at Bilderberg Group members on some video that I saw, but on this anniversary of 9-11, I just want to emphasize how important it is to realize that this is, in my view, I don't know what your take is on it,
[03:29:01.388 --> 03:29:05.370]  In my view, this is really where things started accelerating.
[03:29:05.370 --> 03:29:09.391]  You know, because... Oh yeah, no, it's their excuse to grandstand and take our rights.
[03:29:09.391 --> 03:29:11.952]  Because they're the terrorists, yeah.
[03:29:11.952 --> 03:29:14.633]  And we've accepted crap.
[03:29:14.633 --> 03:29:15.694]  Patriot Act.
[03:29:15.694 --> 03:29:28.179]  I mean, you'd think, if you watch this, if you knew what was going on now, back in 1999-2000, where you have an actual Department of Homeland Security, NSA, dragnet spies... No one would believe it.
[03:29:28.834 --> 03:29:31.035]  No one would believe it, yet here we are.
[03:29:31.035 --> 03:29:33.537]  This is what we're living in now.
[03:29:33.537 --> 03:29:37.139]  And when you look at 9-11, I was working in D.C.
[03:29:37.139 --> 03:29:37.599]  You know what?
[03:29:37.599 --> 03:29:38.300]  I'm coming back.
[03:29:38.300 --> 03:29:42.842]  I'm going to let you finish, but I've got an incredibly important message when we come back.
[03:29:42.842 --> 03:29:43.663]  You're absolutely right.
[03:29:43.663 --> 03:29:48.185]  I want to tell everybody, folks, the next one's going to be much bigger, and they're planning a full takeover.
[03:29:48.185 --> 03:29:49.186]  They are the terrorists.
[03:29:49.186 --> 03:29:50.587]  They did it.
[03:29:50.587 --> 03:29:51.968]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.968 --> 03:29:54.509]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.509 --> 03:29:57.171]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.505 --> 03:30:06.232]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[03:30:06.232 --> 03:30:09.356]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[03:30:09.356 --> 03:30:14.904]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[03:30:14.904 --> 03:30:16.507]  It all comes down to one thing.
[03:30:16.827 --> 03:30:18.467]  We are what we eat.
[03:30:18.467 --> 03:30:23.128]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[03:30:23.128 --> 03:30:27.349]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[03:30:27.349 --> 03:30:29.909]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[03:30:29.909 --> 03:30:36.130]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[03:30:36.130 --> 03:30:39.111]  To learn more, visit InfoWarsHealth.com.

[03:31:05.123 --> 03:31:09.324]  My name is Van, and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[03:31:09.324 --> 03:31:14.066]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[03:31:14.066 --> 03:31:15.987]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[03:31:15.987 --> 03:31:17.888]  It made me feel breathless.
[03:31:17.888 --> 03:31:22.310]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[03:31:22.310 --> 03:31:23.390]  Nothing did anything.
[03:31:23.390 --> 03:31:27.312]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[03:31:27.512 --> 03:31:31.457]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[03:31:31.457 --> 03:31:33.440]  I noticed a difference quickly.
[03:31:33.440 --> 03:31:39.588]  Within days, the episodes became less frequent and by a month I completely vanished.
[03:31:39.588 --> 03:31:42.432]  Usually you find a 30 day or 60 day guarantee.
[03:31:42.432 --> 03:31:44.675]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a lifetime 100% warranty.
[03:31:45.336 --> 03:31:46.757]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[03:31:46.757 --> 03:31:53.000]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[03:32:13.246 --> 03:32:16.488]  Ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[03:32:16.488 --> 03:32:18.669]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[03:32:18.669 --> 03:32:25.072]  If every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[03:32:25.072 --> 03:32:33.296]  The new Just In Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[03:32:33.296 --> 03:32:39.619]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[03:32:40.239 --> 03:32:41.560]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.
[03:32:41.560 --> 03:32:44.743]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.

[03:32:47.045 --> 03:32:50.067]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[03:33:02.797 --> 03:33:08.618]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:08.618 --> 03:33:10.959]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:33:10.959 --> 03:33:15.640]  All right, Dave, you called in.
[03:33:15.640 --> 03:33:19.881]  You don't screen the calls, but if you volunteer, we have like one line of info.
[03:33:19.881 --> 03:33:22.682]  It says 9-11 Pentagon event, eyewitness.
[03:33:22.682 --> 03:33:25.823]  I'm going to try to shut up before I have a stroke or something and settle down.
[03:33:25.823 --> 03:33:31.004]  I just start thinking about how they take people's kids after they
[03:33:32.025 --> 03:33:34.246]  Brain damage them or kill them with the vaccines.
[03:33:34.246 --> 03:33:36.207]  They know full well what they're doing now.
[03:33:36.207 --> 03:33:40.408]  You can say 20 years ago, they didn't know when SIDS was starting up.
[03:33:40.408 --> 03:33:43.810]  But now they know and they cover it up.
[03:33:43.810 --> 03:33:45.811]  Because, you know, the doctors are told, give the shots.
[03:33:45.811 --> 03:33:46.571]  Here's the mandate.
[03:33:46.571 --> 03:33:48.812]  A lot of people say there's no bad effects.
[03:33:48.812 --> 03:33:49.832]  Oh, get a convulsion.
[03:33:49.832 --> 03:33:50.273]  Oops.
[03:33:50.273 --> 03:33:50.993]  Yeah.
[03:33:50.993 --> 03:33:52.273]  Vaccine did it here.
[03:33:52.273 --> 03:33:53.494]  Go through a 10 year process.
[03:33:53.494 --> 03:33:53.914]  You might get $100,000.
[03:33:53.914 --> 03:33:58.236]  You know, for your kid, it's going to be in diapers the rest of their life.
[03:34:02.513 --> 03:34:06.342]  And they all know, and they all just make jokes about it, and they have like Harvard...
[03:34:07.813 --> 03:34:20.786]  You know, doctors write articles about me in the local paper and stuff, you know, and about how people that criticize vaccines are full of crap and there's no bad effects, and if there were, it would be outweighed by the good they do.
[03:34:20.786 --> 03:34:24.069]  I believe in inoculation technology.
[03:34:24.069 --> 03:34:26.671]  From the studies I've read, it could work if it was done properly.
[03:34:26.671 --> 03:34:31.015]  There are some questions of what it does to overall immunity, but it's a cost-benefit analysis.
[03:34:32.037 --> 03:34:46.681]  If something is going to, you know, absolutely kill you, there's some virus that kills, say, mousepox, or bacterium like that, that kills 98% of people.
[03:34:46.681 --> 03:34:55.103]  If there's a vaccine that, you know, protects me, and who knows, might in, say, 5% of the cases even give me some problem, I'll probably roll the dice and go do it.
[03:34:56.178 --> 03:34:59.340]  But, oh, let's give a hepatitis shot to your newborn baby.
[03:34:59.340 --> 03:35:01.802]  Well, okay, are they having unprotected sex?
[03:35:01.802 --> 03:35:04.745]  Are they an intravenous drug user?
[03:35:04.745 --> 03:35:06.226]  By the way, is that a safe vaccine?
[03:35:06.226 --> 03:35:11.950]  It's one of the worst!
[03:35:11.950 --> 03:35:18.935]  And then you find out that it's not accidental that they're still using flesh-cultured
[03:35:20.129 --> 03:35:30.073]  Viruses that are filled in some cases with thousands of variants of human, simian and other viruses.
[03:35:30.073 --> 03:35:33.895]  That's why there's all these new cancers never before seen everywhere.
[03:35:33.895 --> 03:35:36.316]  That's not debatable.
[03:35:36.316 --> 03:35:40.478]  And for me, this is the big issue here.
[03:35:40.478 --> 03:35:48.201]  That all these idiots on the news and all these glitter bug preachers and all these narcissists that will do whatever it takes to advance and move up the ladder
[03:35:50.658 --> 03:35:53.139]  They're all under the plague of the New World Order.
[03:35:53.139 --> 03:35:55.219]  They're all under the curse of it.
[03:35:55.219 --> 03:36:05.982]  And the only thing that matters is getting rid of the globalists because they are unified, scientifically deployed, satanically influenced.
[03:36:05.982 --> 03:36:09.603]  Only way to describe these people.
[03:36:09.603 --> 03:36:11.284]  I mean, it's like a science fiction movie.
[03:36:11.284 --> 03:36:13.484]  You look at the plan of what they're doing.
[03:36:13.484 --> 03:36:19.246]  It's how aliens would come to Earth that looked like humans and would build a technocracy, take people over incrementally.
[03:36:20.268 --> 03:36:22.229]  And basically phase out humanity.
[03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:25.229]  And then you realize, oh my gosh, that's what they're doing.
[03:36:25.229 --> 03:36:27.050]  But they're not space aliens.
[03:36:27.050 --> 03:36:32.491]  They believe they're a new species that's going to merge with machines and are following an exact plan.
[03:36:32.491 --> 03:36:34.572]  And they've got all these movies out about it.
[03:36:34.572 --> 03:36:36.292]  Fiction, non-fiction books.
[03:36:36.292 --> 03:36:40.173]  They're flooding the culture with it.
[03:36:40.173 --> 03:36:44.254]  I didn't see it, but Gucciardi did and did a review of it.
[03:36:44.254 --> 03:36:46.855]  What's the name of the film that's out right now about the end of the world?
[03:36:48.652 --> 03:36:51.095]  The guys that made the zombie movie, it's a comedy.
[03:36:51.095 --> 03:36:54.698]  And then they find out that, oh, really, aliens took over, merged with humans.
[03:36:54.698 --> 03:36:58.703]  They're going to incrementally keep phasing in the new computers.
[03:36:58.703 --> 03:37:02.327]  Yeah, this is the end, until we merge with machines and everybody else dies.
[03:37:02.327 --> 03:37:03.888]  You're a scumbag zombie.
[03:37:03.888 --> 03:37:05.310]  That's a metaphor for the general public.
[03:37:05.310 --> 03:37:07.893]  The elite merge with machines and fly to planet Pop-Tart.
[03:37:08.786 --> 03:37:13.829]  And people are like, man, I'm getting emails and comments going, that's what you say they think they're doing.
[03:37:13.829 --> 03:37:15.930]  Wow, did they get this from you?
[03:37:15.930 --> 03:37:19.852]  No, folks, they didn't get that from me.
[03:37:19.852 --> 03:37:22.674]  That's what all of the top globalists say.
[03:37:22.674 --> 03:37:24.354]  Hundreds of books.
[03:37:24.354 --> 03:37:27.216]  That's the plan.
[03:37:27.216 --> 03:37:31.558]  And man, I don't think the New World Order is the best humanity's got to offer.
[03:37:31.558 --> 03:37:34.320]  I certainly don't think they should be running my life.
[03:37:34.320 --> 03:37:35.600]  But you know what?
[03:37:35.600 --> 03:37:36.261]  You know what they say?
[03:37:37.472 --> 03:37:40.394]  They say, Alex, the public doesn't want your help.
[03:37:40.394 --> 03:37:45.377]  They are animals and they will be killed.
[03:37:45.377 --> 03:37:52.702]  I've been told off record by people that are inside the New World Order over and over again.
[03:37:52.702 --> 03:37:56.265]  Started when I go to the State House and I'll go back to your calls and give you this big announcement.
[03:37:56.265 --> 03:38:06.952]  Started when I go to the State House, you know, 15, 16 years ago and I had stuff like, you know, the Speaker come over to me.
[03:38:07.739 --> 03:38:12.142]  I'd be on the hike and bike trail, and the lieutenant governor, or the former one, comes over.
[03:38:12.142 --> 03:38:15.265]  And they're like, Alex, you're a smart guy.
[03:38:15.265 --> 03:38:17.066]  They're always real charming.
[03:38:17.066 --> 03:38:19.748]  Listen, these people, you're not going to be able to help them.
[03:38:19.748 --> 03:38:23.071]  All you can do is try to join the system and work within it.
[03:38:23.071 --> 03:38:27.614]  But I mean, you know, the people are taking up all the resources, and they are dumb.
[03:38:27.614 --> 03:38:30.376]  And let me tell you something else, Alex.
[03:38:30.376 --> 03:38:35.360]  They would tear you limb from limb if you actually ever tried to take over the system and help them.
[03:38:36.488 --> 03:38:37.489]  Okay?
[03:38:37.489 --> 03:38:41.012]  And you're going to figure that out someday because you're a smart guy.
[03:38:41.012 --> 03:38:41.732]  I'll see you later.
[03:38:41.732 --> 03:38:43.073]  Here's my card.
[03:38:43.073 --> 03:38:44.054]  Here's my card, bud.
[03:38:44.054 --> 03:38:46.636]  You ever want to talk to us?
[03:38:46.636 --> 03:38:52.921]  And since then, it moved up to high-level politicians, heads of companies.
[03:38:52.921 --> 03:38:55.083]  Until now, they don't even do it anymore because they know.
[03:38:55.083 --> 03:38:56.784]  I mean, I've seen where they're going.
[03:38:56.784 --> 03:39:01.628]  I would never, never in a trillion years sell out to total death.
[03:39:02.984 --> 03:39:07.387]  We're not selling out to Boss Hog here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:39:07.387 --> 03:39:12.710]  You're not selling out to Roscoe, Pico, Train, and Flash.
[03:39:12.710 --> 03:39:18.093]  You're selling out to the rock bottom of the rabbit hole that ends in the ninth circle of hell.
[03:39:18.093 --> 03:39:25.477]  I mean, that is a no-brainer to not sell out to that.
[03:39:33.359 --> 03:39:37.042]  And let me tell you, that's how they think, and that's what they do, and that's who they are.
[03:39:37.042 --> 03:39:44.988]  And you know, the public is, many of them, absolutely little demonic trash, because they've been taught how to act like that, they've been held up like that.
[03:39:44.988 --> 03:39:48.871]  And naturally, people do have that side to them.
[03:39:48.871 --> 03:39:55.637]  And that's the globalist ultimate sin, is that they would dumb everybody down and wreck their futures just so they could be in control.
[03:39:55.637 --> 03:39:57.058]  That, to me, is the ultimate sin.
[03:39:58.453 --> 03:40:00.535]  And let me just make the big announcement now and then I'll go to your calls.
[03:40:00.535 --> 03:40:02.476]  Okay?
[03:40:02.476 --> 03:40:10.043]  Here in this fourth hour of overdrive.
[03:40:10.043 --> 03:40:22.754]  You're going to wake up one morning and they're going to blow a large piece, a large area of a city, into a giant, smoldering, two-mile-wide black crater with
[03:40:24.463 --> 03:40:30.648]  Images of humans welded into magma glass.
[03:40:30.648 --> 03:40:34.811]  You'll have the media showing people burned into glass.
[03:40:34.811 --> 03:40:44.679]  The horror of the Patriot... They'll probably call it, if I was them, the George Washington Group.
[03:40:44.679 --> 03:40:47.301]  The George Washington Group will nuke a city.
[03:40:51.243 --> 03:40:56.525]  We'll learn that the George Washington Group joined with Iran.
[03:40:56.525 --> 03:41:02.068]  That's right, they were mad about Syria and stuff.
[03:41:02.068 --> 03:41:12.352]  There's a hundred different ways they could do it, but, oh, they killed more than 70,000, died instantly when the low-yield weapon detonated, or it might be a big one.
[03:41:12.352 --> 03:41:13.653]  Oh, the U.S.
[03:41:13.653 --> 03:41:18.355]  Army soldiers in the George Washington Group, they smuggled out a 10 megaton
[03:41:19.403 --> 03:41:25.588]  Or maybe a 20 megaton warhead and then they detonated it in a major city.
[03:41:25.588 --> 03:41:31.493]  Might even be Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Austin.
[03:41:31.493 --> 03:41:33.415]  But a lot of the elite live here, they probably won't do Austin.
[03:41:35.288 --> 03:41:39.290]  And it'll just be, oh my gosh, we're all so scared.
[03:41:39.290 --> 03:41:43.033]  We better do whatever we're told now and hunt down the people that did it.
[03:41:43.033 --> 03:41:50.997]  Because after all, after all, you don't want to argue with this and say that the government might have done it.
[03:41:50.997 --> 03:41:52.818]  I mean, they would never.
[03:41:52.818 --> 03:42:00.243]  Sure, they'd give over 100 million Americans, knowingly, cancer viruses to die, horribly excruciating deaths years later.
[03:42:01.374 --> 03:42:09.938]  On record, but they would never kill 60, 70 thousand and blind another 50 thousand and burn hundreds.
[03:42:09.938 --> 03:42:12.059]  I mean, they would not.
[03:42:12.059 --> 03:42:16.521]  Sure, they'd kill tens of millions, but they would not.
[03:42:16.521 --> 03:42:18.282]  I mean, that I sure.
[03:42:18.282 --> 03:42:20.302]  I mean, the government funded Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[03:42:20.302 --> 03:42:22.223]  And yeah, they yeah, the U.N.
[03:42:22.223 --> 03:42:26.425]  did get caught sterilizing people in Africa with tetanus shots that had hormones added to them.
[03:42:26.425 --> 03:42:27.366]  But, you know, I just.
[03:42:29.096 --> 03:42:30.056]  And that's fine.
[03:42:30.056 --> 03:42:35.197]  Because you can't believe it, I can see into the mind of the New World Order.
[03:42:35.197 --> 03:42:37.718]  And it's not some psychic thing.
[03:42:37.718 --> 03:42:38.598]  I live this.
[03:42:38.598 --> 03:42:39.838]  I know them.
[03:42:39.838 --> 03:42:42.279]  I know the enemy.
[03:42:42.279 --> 03:42:43.539]  And I know who they are.
[03:42:43.539 --> 03:42:44.740]  I know their heart.
[03:42:44.740 --> 03:42:51.961]  Because, I'm going to be honest with you folks, I love God and I have a good heart, but I've got a big fat evil streak right down the middle.
[03:42:51.961 --> 03:42:53.782]  Like everybody does.
[03:42:53.782 --> 03:42:55.422]  But mine runs deep.
[03:42:56.827 --> 03:43:00.530]  And I can basically like a crystal balls two-way folks.
[03:43:00.530 --> 03:43:02.091]  They can see what we're doing.
[03:43:02.091 --> 03:43:03.512]  I can see what they're doing.
[03:43:03.512 --> 03:43:08.456]  And by the way, you can do that as well as soon as you start looking at who these people are.
[03:43:08.456 --> 03:43:10.238]  And I mean, I know who they are.
[03:43:10.238 --> 03:43:11.379]  I know what they plan.
[03:43:11.379 --> 03:43:12.479]  I know what they want to do.
[03:43:12.479 --> 03:43:18.824]  They got a lot of different plans laid out on the table and they're trying to figure out which one's best and how this is going to work and how that's going to work.
[03:43:20.399 --> 03:43:29.021]  They may, I don't think this will happen until they've got the real clamp down in place and the police state grid and turn the energy sources off to make you totally dependent.
[03:43:29.021 --> 03:43:34.923]  Then they'll have some smaller bioweapons releases to scare everybody into really going into kind of a medical tyranny.
[03:43:34.923 --> 03:43:46.706]  And then they will just release a bioweapon that they of course have the cure for that are being tested in subterranean facilities on humans all over the world.
[03:43:46.706 --> 03:43:49.267]  Oh, like the atomic soldiers and the rest of it.
[03:43:50.393 --> 03:44:00.236]  And they will release the white plague, something like that.
[03:44:00.236 --> 03:44:13.840]  And when they release the white plague, you will know, you will know what it is to throw your gold in the streets and to beat yourself on the head repenting to God.
[03:44:13.840 --> 03:44:18.341]  It'll be too late.
[03:44:18.341 --> 03:44:18.961]  It'll be too late.
[03:44:21.203 --> 03:44:23.284]  They're going to release bioweapons.
[03:44:23.284 --> 03:44:27.886]  They've already released them in the food and water, but they're slow kill, so that you can't figure out what happened to you.
[03:44:27.886 --> 03:44:35.829]  They're slowly turning up the heat that'll get you weakened and so toxic and so poisoned and so confused that you can't communicate and operate.
[03:44:35.829 --> 03:44:40.491]  So they first hit you with a layer of chemical and biological weapon to stun you.
[03:44:43.131 --> 03:44:46.053]  Because they might get caught if they come up with a frontal attack right up front.
[03:44:46.053 --> 03:44:59.703]  And then once they've done that and spiritually and psychically wounded you, and psychically damaged you, and fired their darts into you, once you're kind of rolling around on the ground, then they're going to come over and stick their big black fangs into you.
[03:44:59.703 --> 03:45:00.424]  Big spider.
[03:45:00.424 --> 03:45:05.928]  They're going to stick them right into the whole society and just suck it dry.
[03:45:05.928 --> 03:45:07.049]  Because you asked for it.
[03:45:07.049 --> 03:45:08.130]  Because you opened the gates.
[03:45:10.672 --> 03:45:12.192]  All the hell that's coming with it.
[03:45:12.192 --> 03:45:17.833]  You think what you've seen so far, that's just the scouts of Satan.
[03:45:17.833 --> 03:45:20.294]  The vanguard.
[03:45:20.294 --> 03:45:29.715]  But the big engines, the big siege weapons are rolling in to the interdimensional gate, manifesting, and all hell is coming with it.
[03:45:29.715 --> 03:45:35.996]  Every form of wickedness invented, just things the world has never seen unfolding.
[03:45:35.996 --> 03:45:39.077]  If you let this evil
[03:45:41.533 --> 03:45:42.594]  Resonate.
[03:45:42.594 --> 03:45:49.718]  See, they've only stunned you now and wrapped you up, and some of us are trying to get away.
[03:45:49.718 --> 03:46:00.364]  We're the extremists, and they're reaching out with a leg to grab us and trying to put spinnerets around us because they want to get us all lined up so they can have a big feast.
[03:46:00.364 --> 03:46:01.945]  Because, see, we're not defenseless bugs.
[03:46:01.945 --> 03:46:03.306]  We're more powerful than the spider.
[03:46:03.854 --> 03:46:12.714]  We're like a colossus made in the image of God that allows this horrible, diseased jellyfish to attach to us and suck our blood out.
[03:46:13.800 --> 03:46:18.983]  And we bow to it, because it wears a black uniform, or it has epaulets on with stars.
[03:46:18.983 --> 03:46:22.364]  And, oh, let us bow to the succubus.
[03:46:22.364 --> 03:46:27.747]  Let us bow to the diseased, rotting zombie forces of the New World Order.
[03:46:27.747 --> 03:46:29.228]  Oh, you're so scary.
[03:46:29.228 --> 03:46:30.888]  Oh, you're so powerful.
[03:46:30.888 --> 03:46:32.189]  Oh, I'm so afraid of you.
[03:46:32.189 --> 03:46:33.450]  Here, let me lay down.
[03:46:33.450 --> 03:46:36.811]  You can come tie me up, because you'll be nice to me if I do that.
[03:46:36.811 --> 03:46:38.932]  And the spider says, yes, I will.
[03:46:38.932 --> 03:46:41.914]  I'm going to be very nice to you.
[03:46:42.694 --> 03:46:44.095]  I hope this doesn't hurt.
[03:46:44.095 --> 03:46:46.496]  Let me get you used to putting my hands on you.
[03:46:46.496 --> 03:46:47.557]  Line up over there.
[03:46:47.557 --> 03:46:52.200]  I'm going to take your kids and your wife and I'm going to touch them in front of you now.
[03:46:52.200 --> 03:46:56.602]  And now I'm going to... Teach the kids to be put in handcuffs at school.
[03:46:56.602 --> 03:46:57.883]  I'm going to put this on you.
[03:46:57.883 --> 03:47:04.427]  I have giant prisons full of people where we suck their souls out and feed them designer GMO.
[03:47:04.427 --> 03:47:05.667]  We're testing on them.
[03:47:05.667 --> 03:47:07.328]  And where we sterilize the women.
[03:47:08.769 --> 03:47:11.050]  Let me put the spinneret on there.
[03:47:11.050 --> 03:47:16.173]  Let me get it all nice and then tie you down.
[03:47:16.173 --> 03:47:18.115]  You're gonna like this.
[03:47:18.115 --> 03:47:31.002]  And now that you're paralyzed in horror, and now that you can't do anything, and now that you're laying there, you know I'm gonna suck everything out of you now.
[03:47:31.002 --> 03:47:31.743]  How's that feel?
[03:47:37.369 --> 03:47:40.755]  They are spiders.
[03:47:40.755 --> 03:47:41.576]  I mean, I see them.
[03:47:41.576 --> 03:47:49.329]  They are giant, giant demonic spiders, folks, operating basically through humans.
[03:47:51.018 --> 03:47:52.258]  That's what possession is.
[03:47:52.258 --> 03:47:53.599]  The Bible's alright, folks.
[03:47:53.599 --> 03:48:20.149]  We are dealing with demonic, giant demonic entities that for the entire history of humanity have been sucking on us and hurting us and trying to twist us and trying to hurt and now they're getting ready for their giant war against humanity before we get off world, before we go to the next level, before the things the eye has not seen, the ear has not heard, before we're given all that, they desperately want to destroy us and annihilate us and that's what makes me sick.
[03:48:21.311 --> 03:48:26.197]  That's what makes me want to throw up.
[03:48:26.197 --> 03:48:35.328]  And if I had to describe these entities, they're like spiders.
[03:48:35.328 --> 03:48:37.331]  We're not dealing with a bunch of slea stacks here, folks.
[03:48:40.236 --> 03:48:46.660]  I'm sure the media can have fun with that, but over a billion, really it's about two billion people say they're Christian.
[03:48:46.660 --> 03:48:48.081]  I mean, isn't that what the Bible says?
[03:48:48.081 --> 03:48:50.222]  It comes to kill, steal and destroy.
[03:48:50.222 --> 03:48:52.263]  It comes to enslave the innocent.
[03:48:52.263 --> 03:48:54.784]  It comes to persecute the women and the children.
[03:48:54.784 --> 03:48:58.447]  I mean, these people are demons.
[03:48:58.447 --> 03:49:09.313]  And whether they exist or not, I'm saying the archetype of the Jeffrey Dahmer, is that not a spider luring 13 year olds and people into his house to torture them for weeks on end?
[03:49:10.760 --> 03:49:19.204]  Injecting their brain with acid that he read about to paralyze them so they could be in horror but not scream.
[03:49:19.204 --> 03:49:21.985]  The spider.
[03:49:21.985 --> 03:49:24.126]  The spider.
[03:49:24.126 --> 03:49:27.348]  Our enemy is the spider.
[03:49:27.348 --> 03:49:32.430]  Telling you right now, these people act and behave exactly like spiders.
[03:49:33.877 --> 03:49:36.360]  So there's your analogy, there's your archetype.
[03:49:36.360 --> 03:49:38.162]  Oh, Spider-Man, he ain't your friend.
[03:49:38.162 --> 03:49:40.805]  See how that archetype?
[03:49:40.805 --> 03:49:45.670]  All of this stuff is you're being bombarded continually by these predators.
[03:49:45.670 --> 03:49:48.834]  So realize, the system is run by spiders.
[03:49:48.834 --> 03:49:49.735]  Spiritually speaking.
[03:49:49.735 --> 03:49:52.077]  I mean, that's how I would describe the devil archetypally.
[03:49:52.077 --> 03:49:53.879]  I don't mean literal, you know, spires.
[03:49:57.133 --> 03:49:58.855]  They want to carve us up real nice.
[03:49:58.855 --> 03:50:02.480]  They want to take their time from end to end destroying humanity.
[03:50:02.480 --> 03:50:05.203]  And we have to say no to it.
[03:50:05.203 --> 03:50:07.226]  And that's what I basically wanted to get to today.
[03:50:07.226 --> 03:50:10.791]  We'll come back and I will jam in as many as I can in this final segment.
[03:50:10.791 --> 03:50:15.457]  And I'll be completely exhausted after the broadcast today, but I just had to go over all this with you today.
[03:50:18.154 --> 03:50:19.075]  And that's all they're doing.
[03:50:19.075 --> 03:50:21.856]  That's why they're telling your kids they're racist because they have a brown bag.
[03:50:21.856 --> 03:50:26.238]  The spider's making contact, saying, you're bad, let me tie you up and this will turn out okay.
[03:50:26.238 --> 03:50:27.119]  It will not.
[03:50:27.119 --> 03:50:30.161]  Stockholm Syndrome will not protect you.
[03:50:30.161 --> 03:50:35.584]  I know the spider's scary, folks, but you're going to have to fight it.
[03:50:35.584 --> 03:50:36.084]  You understand that?
[03:50:36.084 --> 03:50:37.104]  And that's what Obama is.
[03:50:37.104 --> 03:50:38.005]  He's a sick predator.
[03:50:38.005 --> 03:50:40.807]  When you look in his eyes, he loves conning old ladies.
[03:50:40.807 --> 03:50:42.708]  He loves knowing he's going to ruin their life.
[03:50:42.708 --> 03:50:44.469]  He loves setting people up.
[03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:46.550]  He loves setting a trap, a web.
[03:50:47.537 --> 03:50:49.180]  The World Wide Web.
[03:50:49.180 --> 03:50:50.182]  They love the web.
[03:50:50.182 --> 03:50:51.284]  They love capturing us.
[03:50:51.284 --> 03:50:52.286]  Well, you know what?
[03:50:52.286 --> 03:50:54.229]  I've come.
[03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:57.816]  I've come, ladies and gentlemen, with the sword.
[03:50:57.816 --> 03:50:59.599]  And we're gonna dispatch these spiders.
[03:51:01.553 --> 03:51:03.454]  Introducing Pro-1.

[03:51:07.117 --> 03:51:11.680]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[03:51:11.680 --> 03:51:17.764]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.

[03:52:01.283 --> 03:52:06.265]  Every time you eat a cooked food, your body responds by producing an increase in circulating white blood cells.
[03:52:06.265 --> 03:52:11.588]  This happens because nature designed us to eat food that is undamaged at the molecular level.
[03:52:11.588 --> 03:52:17.670]  When we heat food to normal cooking temperatures, we change the shape of the molecules into shapes the body cannot use.
[03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:20.872]  The body now looks at them as toxins and allergens.
[03:52:20.872 --> 03:52:28.455]  In an effort to protect itself from this irritant, the body intelligently increases the amount of circulating white blood cells to act as garbage collectors.
[03:52:28.875 --> 03:52:29.656]  We're good to go!
[03:52:51.516 --> 03:52:51.956]  Call 888-988-3325.

[03:53:50.795 --> 03:53:53.238]  Big Berkey Water Filters, for the love of clean water.
[03:54:19.332 --> 03:54:20.573]  Dave, real quick, finish your point.
[03:54:20.573 --> 03:54:22.574]  We're gonna go to Mike and others.
[03:54:22.574 --> 03:54:39.322]  Sure, yeah, no, the thing is that I walked into work on September 11th, I'm sorry, yeah, September 11th, 2001, in D.C., and our office was right across from the Pentagon, and saw the planes that had hit, the one plane that had hit the towers, and nobody could believe it.
[03:54:39.322 --> 03:54:41.043]  I mean, that's the big trick, right?
[03:54:41.043 --> 03:54:43.924]  Nobody can believe this stuff is happening.
[03:54:43.924 --> 03:54:47.186]  And I walked out, sat down at my desk, did some work,
[03:54:47.927 --> 03:54:50.350]  I looked up and all of a sudden there's smoke coming up.
[03:54:50.350 --> 03:54:51.031]  There's no plane.
[03:54:51.031 --> 03:54:52.193]  There was nothing going on there.
[03:54:52.193 --> 03:54:53.755]  I just saw a bunch of smoke.
[03:54:53.755 --> 03:54:55.658]  The next thing we know we're being evacuated.
[03:54:56.790 --> 03:55:07.653]  Later even, um, after the anthrax scare, we were all told, because we were in that area, we had to report to the, the hospital, so all these people come to this hospital and get our Cipro and all this stuff.
[03:55:07.653 --> 03:55:14.895]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, I've interviewed people by name who were famous victims who survived, a lady with her baby, all that.
[03:55:14.895 --> 03:55:15.715]  There was no plane.
[03:55:15.715 --> 03:55:21.337]  And then they found witnesses to say, oh, I saw the plane, because they had one fly over right when they blew it up.
[03:55:21.337 --> 03:55:24.237]  That's how smart they are, as best we can tell.
[03:55:24.237 --> 03:55:26.338]  They had one go over and then a missile hit it.
[03:55:27.907 --> 03:55:28.447]  Go ahead.
[03:55:28.447 --> 03:55:34.508]  There's absolutely no proof whatsoever that there was a plane of that size that would have any kind of effect like that.
[03:55:34.508 --> 03:55:38.069]  But that's, you know, that's that, as you know, and you've been telling people.
[03:55:38.069 --> 03:55:42.450]  There were unbroken windows right where the engine was supposed to be.
[03:55:42.450 --> 03:55:43.130]  Exactly.
[03:55:43.130 --> 03:55:45.390]  You know, and I'm sitting there looking at it.
[03:55:45.390 --> 03:55:46.810]  All I'm seeing is smoke.
[03:55:46.810 --> 03:55:49.491]  You look at the pictures, and it was only years later.
[03:55:49.491 --> 03:55:56.712]  And this is why every September 11th we've got to push this message forward, because not only is where it all began, it is the biggest
[03:55:57.307 --> 03:56:00.448]  No, Dave, take shots, don't listen, it'll be alright.
[03:56:00.448 --> 03:56:04.870]  Just let me tie you up with a spider, with a twine, and after we've chained you up, we'll be nice to you, do you believe me?
[03:56:26.650 --> 03:56:27.130]  I don't know.
[03:56:27.130 --> 03:56:29.632]  I probably need to watch some more Miley Cyrus for that.
[03:56:29.632 --> 03:56:32.974]  But NPR talks in a loving voice.
[03:56:32.974 --> 03:56:34.495]  I'm a spider.
[03:56:34.495 --> 03:56:36.136]  I appreciate you joining us, my friend.
[03:56:36.136 --> 03:56:39.297]  Take care.
[03:56:39.297 --> 03:56:40.718]  Oh boy, people are going to have fun.
[03:56:40.718 --> 03:56:42.299]  Trolls are going to have fun with the spider thing.
[03:56:42.299 --> 03:56:44.200]  It's important to feed them.
[03:56:44.200 --> 03:56:45.921]  They're important pollinators spreading the word.
[03:56:45.921 --> 03:56:47.042]  They help us.
[03:56:47.042 --> 03:56:48.723]  Let's talk to Mike in Canada.
[03:56:48.723 --> 03:56:49.823]  Mike, you're on the air.
[03:56:49.823 --> 03:56:50.764]  Go ahead, my friend.
[03:56:50.764 --> 03:56:52.845]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[03:56:52.845 --> 03:56:53.966]  Can you hear me all right?
[03:56:53.966 --> 03:56:55.527]  I can hear you just fine, my friend.
[03:56:56.687 --> 03:56:57.288]  Excellent.
[03:56:57.288 --> 03:57:05.715]  Yeah, I'm coming at you here from Camrose, Alberta, which is in the Western Provinces, and I want to talk a little bit about longevity.
[03:57:05.715 --> 03:57:14.242]  We have a group of people here that are directly in your downline and Ted Anderson's wife's downline, and we're bringing Dr. Peter Glidden here.
[03:57:15.791 --> 03:57:20.593]  He's going to be speaking in Edmonton, Camrose, Red Deer, and Calgary.
[03:57:20.593 --> 03:57:29.616]  And if any Patriots in Alberta want to go to deathbymedicine.ca, that's deathbymedicine.ca, you can register to come to these events.
[03:57:30.316 --> 03:57:32.417]  No, that's really exciting and I appreciate your call.
[03:57:32.417 --> 03:57:35.759]  You know, I promote yongevity not so much from the at-home business angle.
[03:57:35.759 --> 03:57:37.520]  It is a great one, a very respected one.
[03:57:37.520 --> 03:57:41.183]  It's because the products are so good and they buy up all the big companies that have the best products.
[03:57:41.183 --> 03:57:43.144]  That's what InfoWarsHealth.com does.
[03:57:43.144 --> 03:57:45.726]  People should check for yongevity events in their area.
[03:57:45.726 --> 03:57:47.186]  I'm not cutting you off because of that.
[03:57:47.186 --> 03:57:50.128]  I've just got to get to other calls and we're at the end of the show here.
[03:57:50.128 --> 03:57:52.750]  Andrew, on nuclear weapon component info from Illinois.
[03:57:52.750 --> 03:57:54.831]  Go ahead, you've got one minute.
[03:57:54.831 --> 03:57:59.014]  NSA, how about NNSA, which is the National Nuclear Security Agency.
[03:57:59.914 --> 03:58:13.906]  They have an Office of Transportation, Office of Secure Transportation, which ships by convoy nuclear material, nuclear weapons, and, get this, nuclear components.
[03:58:13.906 --> 03:58:18.290]  And the one component we all want to look at is a nuclear pit.
[03:58:18.290 --> 03:58:21.253]  A nuclear pit is the fuse for a nuclear weapon.
[03:58:22.782 --> 03:58:34.471]  The fuse of this firecracker, the big firecracker, in itself is a firecracker with the equivalent of a Nagasaki or Ima Shuma explosion, just from the fuse that touches off a nuclear weapon.
[03:58:34.471 --> 03:58:38.274]  Yeah, and those are easier, I guess, to rig and detonate than blame on Iran.
[03:58:38.274 --> 03:58:39.115]  God bless you folks.
[03:58:39.115 --> 03:58:42.077]  Pray for peace.
[03:58:42.077 --> 03:58:45.480]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
