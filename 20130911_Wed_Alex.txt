[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:33.040]  the constitutional crisis intensifies as Congress appears to be set to basically
[00:33.040 --> 00:39.160]  block at least constitutionally Obama's escalation of the war we've got Obama's
[00:39.160 --> 00:45.760]  speech from yesterday well that is all lies from end to end he implies that this
[00:45.760 --> 00:50.960]  is even really a military action but it's not a pinprick but that they're
[00:50.960 --> 00:55.000]  trying to basically stabilize Syria when they're trying to destabilize Syria it's
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.840]  truly amazing it is obviously the 12th anniversary of the greatest false flag
[01:01.840 --> 01:07.480]  stage terror attack in history and either way you sliced it 9-11 there was
[01:07.480 --> 01:13.240]  prior knowledge there was stand-down and the supposed Saudi Arabian hijackers
[01:13.240 --> 01:19.040]  had multiple passports and were being surveilled by the Israelis and the US
[01:19.040 --> 01:23.440]  government the French the Germans you name it and we're living and working on
[01:23.440 --> 01:29.440]  military bases in the United States that's a fact building seven was blown up
[01:29.440 --> 01:33.040]  in front of everybody the list goes on and on we're gonna open the phones up
[01:33.040 --> 01:36.480]  today for what you think the biggest smoking guns of 9-11 being an inside
[01:36.480 --> 01:41.560]  job are or if you disagree with me but if you look at how criminal elements of
[01:41.560 --> 01:46.000]  the government because people always say on national news when I've been in
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.080]  debates about this what you're saying the whole government the firemen are
[01:49.080 --> 01:54.480]  involved the the police are the whole government no that's a straw man argument
[01:54.480 --> 02:00.080]  I'm saying criminal networks are working with Al Qaeda since it was founded by
[02:00.080 --> 02:05.240]  Zabignan Brzezinski in 1979 and it goes back before that to the British and then
[02:05.240 --> 02:09.480]  the Nazis running it's like whoever has control colonially of the Middle East and
[02:09.480 --> 02:14.800]  the United States stepped in by the 70s colonially even really in the 50s but
[02:14.800 --> 02:20.640]  intensely by the 70s and they like radicals they like dictators look at
[02:20.640 --> 02:23.400]  how our government puts dictators in anywhere they can well they like
[02:23.400 --> 02:31.680]  dictatorial Wahhabist to run the Middle East they don't want swimming pools and
[02:31.680 --> 02:37.520]  movie stars and women going to college over there the globalist want to keep
[02:37.520 --> 02:41.600]  the Middle East in the Stone Age and and then they can have high-tech drone
[02:41.600 --> 02:48.760]  warfare with the cavemen that's basically what's going on here and so we're
[02:48.760 --> 02:53.080]  gonna be breaking all of that down today also the story is up on info wars.com
[02:53.080 --> 02:59.000]  it's also up on drudgeport.com million Muslim March 2013 and the two million
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.440]  bikers Washington DC rally expected on anniversary today we're going to be
[03:03.440 --> 03:19.640]  following this today as it's ongoing we're going to be going over the fact
[03:19.640 --> 03:26.440]  that the violations of the First Amendment are only selectively selectively
[03:26.440 --> 03:33.760]  engaged in so when we come back we're going to launch into the news and then
[03:33.760 --> 03:36.480]  hopefully I'll give the number out and we'll go to your phone calls there's a
[03:36.480 --> 03:42.480]  lot a lot happening Colorado lawmakers ousted and recall vote over gun law
[03:42.480 --> 03:47.920]  that's the New York Times and we've also got 12 years after 9-11 Obama helps
[03:47.920 --> 03:52.560]  revive al Qaeda in Syria yeah 12 years later they've just dropped all the
[03:52.560 --> 03:56.320]  pretense as they think we're that dumb and obviously it's not working so it's
[03:56.320 --> 04:00.880]  backfiring it's also 12 year anniversary of military action starting
[04:00.880 --> 04:06.440]  started a few days after 9-11 so 12 year anniversary 12 year war 73% of US
[04:06.440 --> 04:11.360]  casualties in Afghanistan on Obama's watch CNS news why not give him another
[04:11.360 --> 04:20.040]  peace prize over that the Russians are sending in their carrier killer into the
[04:20.040 --> 04:30.200]  Mediterranean loaded up with the anti-ship supersonic missiles things are
[04:30.200 --> 04:34.920]  escalating very very quickly I guess the globalist calculate they can start a
[04:34.920 --> 04:39.440]  large regional war the average American will just shut up and get behind
[04:39.440 --> 04:44.520]  their country right or wrong well our country is not the criminal kleptocratic
[04:44.520 --> 04:49.560]  globalist that have seized control of our infrastructure we'll be right back on
[04:49.560 --> 04:54.360]  the other side of this quick break oh also Bill Gates has got a new plan not
[04:54.360 --> 05:00.560]  just artificial meat it's more human in his words but artificial eggs are we
[05:00.560 --> 05:04.640]  choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us as we've moved
[05:04.640 --> 05:08.360]  through history every great leader has had to understand the potential of
[05:08.360 --> 05:14.200]  information billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking
[05:14.200 --> 05:19.960]  at how to tap into your psyche from compulsory state education to the
[05:19.960 --> 05:24.760]  Hollywood media brainwashing machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the
[05:24.760 --> 05:28.760]  ideas that shape our actions when somebody obscures that feedback loop
[05:28.760 --> 05:32.600]  between you observing and testing it out and verifying it they can take total
[05:32.600 --> 05:39.840]  control of your awareness how to engineer the opinion of the American

[08:18.280 --> 08:36.480]  well two million bikers have already begun to arrive in Washington DC they
[08:36.480 --> 08:40.760]  were denied a permit they have been given the permit in the past to have
[08:40.760 --> 08:47.560]  their 9-11 rides but the new kleptocratic openly anti-liberty crew that is in
[08:47.560 --> 08:56.440]  full control of DC is denying the first amendment so what did the bikers do they
[08:56.440 --> 09:00.600]  responded and they've been trying to get the permit for several months they
[09:00.600 --> 09:04.920]  responded and they're just now starting to arrive on the city edge they've
[09:04.920 --> 09:10.200]  responded two million of them it's estimated they have responded by saying
[09:10.200 --> 09:14.640]  we're now going to take our time and we're now going to stop at every red
[09:14.640 --> 09:20.600]  line and we're now going to shut the city down because that's exactly what the
[09:20.600 --> 09:25.240]  non permitting has done and of course the DC responded by saying well then
[09:25.240 --> 09:29.240]  you're not allowed to well you know what they've paid their little taxes for
[09:29.240 --> 09:33.000]  their privilege to travel it's not really a privilege it's a right and so
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.840]  they're just going to be there two million of them as individuals and all
[09:36.840 --> 09:42.160]  the DC workers and all the anti-gun people and all the all the folks that
[09:42.160 --> 09:46.800]  love tyranny so much in DC you're going to have the first amendment exercised on
[09:46.800 --> 09:52.280]  you and I have been to the third world I've been to Central America you name it
[09:52.280 --> 09:56.800]  and I've never been treated like I've been treated every time I've been in DC
[09:56.800 --> 10:04.880]  by police I've been there five times the last decade no no more than that seven
[10:04.880 --> 10:14.840]  times I've been to DC seven times in the last decade and I have never seen the
[10:14.840 --> 10:18.760]  police act more abusive and arrogant and evil now you go right outside in
[10:18.760 --> 10:24.080]  Virginia places like Chantilly super nice super professional and a lot of them
[10:24.080 --> 10:29.200]  are listeners DC it's hellish and I know we have some federal marshals that
[10:29.200 --> 10:32.080]  listen and there's some people that Secret Service that aren't bad but I mean
[10:32.080 --> 10:35.880]  the average cops they've got out there on the security guards are even worse I
[10:35.880 --> 10:39.760]  don't want to digress off into it but I've been there with film crews you name
[10:39.760 --> 10:45.040]  it there is no permit in DC to film you can be because they know in the courts
[10:45.040 --> 10:48.480]  they can't make you you can be 200 yards from Washington Monument every time
[10:48.480 --> 10:52.800]  it's happened us and the police walk over and go shut that down you don't have
[10:52.800 --> 10:56.200]  a permit there is no permit it's the first amendment but the city doesn't
[10:56.200 --> 11:00.400]  offer them okay we can do this the easy way the hard way I'm gonna tell you one
[11:00.400 --> 11:07.440]  more time you stop filming or I'm gonna put you in handcuffs right now and you
[11:07.440 --> 11:09.920]  like well I got stuff to do but all right you're violent my first amendment
[11:09.920 --> 11:12.800]  I'm gonna show everybody this video and we've shown you the videos they go I
[11:12.800 --> 11:18.360]  don't care what you do you know what I'm thinking I'm gonna just go ahead I mean
[11:18.360 --> 11:27.120]  it is North Korea ladies and gentlemen and so what a beautiful thing to see two
[11:27.120 --> 11:34.240]  million patriots on the anniversary of 9-11 show up down there in defiance of
[11:34.240 --> 11:37.560]  this violation of the First Amendment and we're gonna be covering it today
[11:37.560 --> 11:41.280]  we're gonna be covering it top story in the aftermath on the nightly news
[11:41.280 --> 11:47.280]  tonight 7 o'clock central this is a big deal and the latest developments the
[11:47.280 --> 11:51.840]  live video feeds all of it we're posting them right now to info wars.com for
[11:51.840 --> 11:56.480]  everybody so you can follow this but it is certainly certainly going to be
[11:56.480 --> 12:00.200]  interesting you know they tried to have back in the 70s a farmer march with a
[12:00.200 --> 12:04.520]  bunch of tractors and in that case DC was able to shut most of it down they
[12:04.520 --> 12:10.000]  climbed up in the cabs there's famous TV footage on CBS News I've seen of this
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.720]  and I've had some of the farmers that were part of it on the broadcast over the
[12:13.720 --> 12:17.520]  years people like Derry Brownfield now rest in peace the police would climb up
[12:17.520 --> 12:24.680]  in the open tractors balls in the cabs and punch the farmers right in the face
[12:24.680 --> 12:28.840]  or beat them with nightsticks because you're not gonna allowed in America to
[12:28.840 --> 12:34.440]  go down a road you paid for you're here to pay money the government sit down and
[12:34.440 --> 12:39.760]  shut up just like on that HBO show about street prostitutes
[12:39.760 --> 12:44.040]  I forget the name of it we played the clip years ago and the woman's been hit
[12:44.040 --> 12:47.800]  by a car and beat up and she's she's wrecked she's got cigarette burns on
[12:47.800 --> 12:51.360]  and everything else and the pimp comes in she goes I'm gonna get up baby I'm
[12:51.360 --> 12:55.240]  gonna get up right now get back on the street for you right now and the mother
[12:55.240 --> 13:01.080]  looks at the pimp says what have you done to my baby what have you done to her
[13:01.080 --> 13:05.040]  and she's like I'm gonna get up I'm gonna get back on the street for you baby
[13:05.040 --> 13:10.280]  I'm gonna do whatever you say baby and then they say what do you pay your girls
[13:10.280 --> 13:14.680]  he goes I pay them nothing and they're lucky if I even give them some chicken
[13:14.680 --> 13:20.320]  once a day a box of chicken and and that's the culture they want they want
[13:20.320 --> 13:28.360]  us just totally broken groveling with mass.com syndrome just begging begging

[13:48.880 --> 13:53.400]  target nine-year-old girls an adult looks at that just laugh at it but I mean
[13:53.400 --> 14:02.480]  these are savage miscreant scum who know exactly what they're doing I mean you
[14:02.480 --> 14:05.920]  sit there and you look at the art the globalist create it's not just to wreck
[14:05.920 --> 14:12.120]  our minds and our psyches they've been wrecked they've been drinking out of
[14:12.120 --> 14:16.480]  their own cup ladies and gentlemen and it is disgusting it's now time to call
[14:16.480 --> 14:24.160]  nationally and to support Congressman Walter Jones legislation it is now time
[14:24.160 --> 14:31.080]  ladies and gentlemen to get behind impeachment because Obama is trying to
[14:31.080 --> 14:34.400]  launch a war without Congress now he knows that they're gonna move for
[14:34.400 --> 14:37.320]  impeachment if he does that but so he's trying to have it both ways well I'm
[14:37.320 --> 14:40.600]  going to you but if you don't I can still do it and trying to spin what the
[14:40.600 --> 14:43.680]  military action means the rest of it it's time to impeach them for Benghazi
[14:43.680 --> 14:48.920]  for fast and furious for if the NSA for targeting pro-livers in the Tea Party
[14:48.920 --> 14:55.240]  with the IRS it's time to go after him for Obamacare which is making most the
[14:55.240 --> 15:00.280]  country go from 40 hours to 20 and is doubling the price of the premiums or
[15:00.280 --> 15:06.360]  more I mean America now is waking up and the stars are aligning for a massive
[15:06.360 --> 15:18.120]  accelerated awakening but now is the time to be as most vocal as you can you
[15:18.120 --> 15:21.200]  know Ed Asner who's frequent guest on the show I'm gonna give him to pop back on
[15:21.200 --> 15:24.600]  the next few days he talked to the Hollywood reporter and then it got
[15:24.600 --> 15:32.160]  picked up by O'Reilly and others and he said look I mean in the article in the
[15:32.160 --> 15:38.400]  videos up on infowars.com he said a lot of people in Hollywood do not want to
[15:38.400 --> 15:41.440]  criticize
[15:43.680 --> 15:50.880]  Obama because they don't want to be called racist because that's exactly how
[15:50.880 --> 15:56.720]  this works that's exactly how the establishment operates and they know
[15:56.720 --> 16:01.600]  you're not racist they're the ones using race to program people and I know
[16:01.600 --> 16:06.200]  everybody knows this they're the ones
[16:07.440 --> 16:16.520]  that are openly using it as just a weapon to scare you so that you'll shut
[16:16.520 --> 16:20.920]  up but that's backfiring as well and is really the fall of political correctness
[16:20.920 --> 16:25.520]  with adults the problem is they have captured audiences with children people
[16:25.520 --> 16:29.440]  in college people that work for government where they say no Billy you
[16:29.440 --> 16:32.800]  brought a brown bag to school it's now starting in public schools did you know
[16:32.800 --> 16:36.400]  that was racist we're gonna write you up for that there's no law there's no
[16:36.400 --> 16:41.360]  regulation there's nothing it's a way to make you bad and persecute you and say
[16:41.360 --> 16:46.240]  you've done something and create just this insane schizophrenia imagining
[16:46.240 --> 16:50.960]  racism everywhere it's not meanwhile every day there are articles of white
[16:50.960 --> 16:55.160]  people being shot or beaten to death as the person says they're killing them
[16:55.160 --> 17:01.040]  because they're white and that is just regional news and then I was talking to
[17:01.040 --> 17:05.120]  man cow this morning I was on his show he talked about he went to the richest
[17:05.120 --> 17:08.760]  area of Chicago three million dollar homes everywhere five million dollar
[17:08.760 --> 17:15.040]  homes at 11 a.m. when Django Unchained came out was earlier this year I guess
[17:15.040 --> 17:23.960]  and they were going in the theater and they were there and black folks told
[17:23.960 --> 17:28.880]  him you better get out of here we're gonna kill you and man cow was like well
[17:28.880 --> 17:34.120]  go ahead do whatever you're gonna do but I mean the point is is that is that this
[17:34.120 --> 17:38.840]  is getting insane because people go and they watch all this it's meant to rub
[17:38.840 --> 17:45.240]  salt and wounds and the whole George Zimmerman situation and just all of it
[17:45.240 --> 17:48.760]  to create as much division as possible because the globalists want to distract
[17:48.760 --> 17:51.920]  us from all the scandals and the looting of the economy and the ship and the
[17:51.920 --> 17:55.880]  jobs overseas and the shutting down the power plants and shipping general
[17:55.880 --> 18:00.200]  motors into China and all the rest of it they are desperate to get us all
[18:00.200 --> 18:05.680]  fighting with each other and divert us but why would they allow a million

[18:17.160 --> 18:21.240]  had them on the one-year anniversary and just gets bigger and bigger why would

[18:26.240 --> 18:29.680]  the city in an hour get them out of their limited problems why would they

[25:55.880 --> 26:04.320]  where should I begin today well it is the anniversary of 9-11 12 years later
[26:04.320 --> 26:11.800]  and if the birth date of our Republic could be marked as 1776 or maybe
[26:11.800 --> 26:19.560]  Lexington and Concord April 19 1775 maybe that's the inception was Lexington
[26:19.560 --> 26:32.240]  Concord and then the birth was 1776 and then we began to crawl in 1789 you can
[26:32.240 --> 26:39.320]  really mark the death date of our constitutional Republic on September 11
[26:39.320 --> 26:46.680]  2001 but years are like seconds or minutes geopolitically in the history
[26:46.680 --> 26:53.480]  of the world the eons that stretch back over thousands of years and so we are
[26:53.480 --> 27:04.160]  on the gurney our heart is stopped we are in cardiac arrest and we've been dead
[27:04.160 --> 27:11.400]  a couple minutes and our heart is dying our brain is dying and if we don't
[27:11.400 --> 27:15.480]  defibrillate the heart soon the heart tissue is going to die and even if they
[27:15.480 --> 27:20.520]  get the heart going again in a day or two the tissue is going to die and the
[27:20.520 --> 27:28.000]  whole heart's going to blow wide open like a rotten tomato I want to get into
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.720]  graphics of how heart attacks work they can get you going again but a couple
[27:31.720 --> 27:38.400]  days later that heart blows open and the longer we don't restart the heart folks
[27:38.400 --> 27:46.800]  the worse it's going to be and tyrants always think they're invincible tyrants
[27:46.800 --> 27:52.120]  always get off on doing reckless things and the collection of out of control
[27:52.120 --> 27:56.680]  Western powers that got power because compared to many other power structures
[27:56.680 --> 28:02.280]  they were more moral we more we had more soft power and so the world would work
[28:02.280 --> 28:09.880]  with us more we've lost all that soft power now and the world absolutely
[28:09.880 --> 28:14.120]  despises and hates us and we need to explain hey we've been decadent and let
[28:14.120 --> 28:18.360]  a corrupt power structure get in place but this has not been done in our name
[28:18.360 --> 28:22.760]  and we don't like what's happening and by the way the world now sees that they
[28:22.760 --> 28:28.440]  see 91% of Americans in the average poll against it they they see us waking up
[28:28.440 --> 28:31.680]  and they think that's a good thing and I'm seeing a lot of good will for
[28:31.680 --> 28:38.360]  Americans again across the world and Obama and his administration are the
[28:38.360 --> 28:44.040]  heart that stopped and there's going to be no defibrillating them they can stage
[28:44.040 --> 28:47.520]  whatever they want to stage they might get that heart going for a minute again
[28:47.520 --> 28:53.720]  it's just going to blow a orders out it's going to blow valves out it's just
[28:53.720 --> 28:57.560]  it's a rotten it's a rotten heart more rotten than the one they cut out of Dick
[28:57.560 --> 29:05.000]  Cheney and nothing they sell is going to work now and they already know that with
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.520]  all they're gonna say spy grit they know and they haven't had the public for a
[29:07.520 --> 29:11.360]  long time the public's just realizing that we're not alone now it's their job

[36:36.920 --> 36:42.960]  doesn't matter if it makes sense it isn't meant to it's a weapon they're

[36:54.200 --> 36:59.720]  authoritarianism no we're not gonna give two million bikers a permit because
[36:59.720 --> 37:07.040]  that image is bad for Obama but we will give it to a Muslim group and you ask
[37:07.040 --> 37:10.760]  why is that because it's a trade-off they they use radical Muslims as the
[37:10.760 --> 37:14.520]  excuse to take our rights but they are running the radical Muslims and have a
[37:14.520 --> 37:20.200]  deal with them to turn the Middle East over to them if they play that game but
[37:20.200 --> 37:24.920]  they've also got a deal at the top in England in here in the US to absolutely
[37:24.920 --> 37:31.000]  let those radical elements not just take over Islam overseas but control it

[38:22.360 --> 38:32.040]  12-year war of US casualties in Afghanistan they're up 73% since
[38:32.040 --> 38:39.120]  Obama got into command that's CNS news info wars.com report 12 years after
[38:39.120 --> 38:43.960]  9-11 Obama helps revive al Qaeda in Syria yeah that's a good poll watch the
[38:43.960 --> 38:48.480]  article but it's not even strong enough when we come face-to-face with this
[38:48.480 --> 38:53.360]  parallel universe bizarro world where our government arms and equips giant
[38:53.360 --> 38:56.880]  brigades of al Qaeda to blow up churches and chop little children up and cut
[38:56.880 --> 39:02.320]  priest heads off and shoot nuns in the back where is the orthodox church
[39:02.320 --> 39:07.320]  criticizing this well they are but it's not getting picked up in the US news that
[39:07.320 --> 39:10.440]  the head of the orthodox church in Greece the head of the orthodox church in
[39:10.440 --> 39:15.960]  Russia the original Christian church one of the oldest branches they are
[39:15.960 --> 39:19.720]  criticizing it the Catholic Church has been criticizing the war and saying
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.320]  diplomacy is needed but where is the Catholic Church denouncing the al Qaeda
[39:24.320 --> 39:29.720]  forces that are shooting Catholic priests and nuns in the back and chopping
[39:29.720 --> 39:34.360]  their heads off because that's going on those reports are coming out I mean
[39:34.360 --> 39:40.040]  imagine that I mean imagine that that that that that that because it's
[39:40.040 --> 39:48.040]  political correctness ladies and gentlemen we went to war over babies
[39:48.040 --> 39:51.560]  that were not thrown out of incubators but now you've got real people being
[39:51.560 --> 39:57.800]  killed real sectarian attacks financed by the West and I ought to tell you what
[39:57.800 --> 40:00.600]  the established with things the Christians I'm telling you folks because
[40:00.600 --> 40:04.600]  they don't like something being above the state and Christianity real
[40:04.600 --> 40:09.320]  Christianity the stuff is in the Bible not what the different religious
[40:09.320 --> 40:14.560]  organizations put out is the antithesis of everything the New World Order
[40:14.560 --> 40:19.320]  setting up that's why the system hates it because there's power in there even
[40:19.320 --> 40:22.920]  if you don't believe in all the different dimensions and things that
[40:22.920 --> 40:28.000]  science has proven is there but you can't see we're basically blind in 99.9%
[40:28.000 --> 40:33.080]  of the universe the dark matter all of it oops that's racist I've now heard
[40:33.080 --> 40:36.560]  sugar cubes are racist as they're white all thoughts I'm not kidding by the way
[40:36.560 --> 40:44.360]  this is the mass mental illness now where everything's racist except real
[40:44.360 --> 40:50.280]  racism who needs to have an intellectual argument just say it's racist okay I'm
[40:50.280 --> 40:54.000]  sorry it's racist racist not want to kill all the Christians after all
[40:54.000 --> 41:00.920]  Christians are all racist didn't you know and of course I'm being nonsensical
[41:00.920 --> 41:06.040]  folks that's what's going on here continuing here with the Associated
[41:06.040 --> 41:09.880]  Press this is the AP showing how much the establishment collapsed how the
[41:09.880 --> 41:14.200]  people's confidence has collapsed they are fact-checking Obama they say Obama's
[41:14.200 --> 41:21.160]  Syria case still lacks proof wow what a word because you know you heard them say
[41:21.160 --> 41:24.880]  they had proof over and over again that there was no doubt and the same speech
[41:24.880 --> 41:29.920]  Kerry then said doesn't matter who used the chemicals if the fact is it was used
[41:29.920 --> 41:34.200]  first Assad did it but then they make the connection later just it being used
[41:34.200 --> 41:38.320]  is the proof and Obama says we've got to go in to secure those weapons by
[41:38.320 --> 41:46.200]  bombing them which will then rain down everybody in the region but also they've
[41:46.200 --> 41:49.120]  got to implode the country to keep it from imploding remember well they're
[41:49.120 --> 41:53.400]  madly boots on the ground Kerry said to the House incident for armed services
[41:53.400 --> 41:58.600]  committee we may have to do that we talked to so many committees was that
[41:58.600 --> 42:03.760]  well maybe he was talking to the International Affairs I forgive me but
[42:03.760 --> 42:08.560]  we played the clip last week I get lost the forest of factoids and and he said
[42:08.560 --> 42:14.000]  well we may need boats if the country implodes heaven forbid that that's their
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.480]  entire goal that's what I mean it's just a wall of lies and they just think this
[42:18.480 --> 42:24.200]  tsunami of fraud will just create an artificial environment of BS to where
[42:24.200 --> 42:30.280]  you just think BS grows on trees and it's just everywhere and that you accept
[42:30.280 --> 42:36.120]  it is your new artificial habitat well I think they've jumped the shark here's
[42:36.120 --> 42:41.360]  the big news Russia's carrier killer enters the Mediterranean how do you
[42:41.360 --> 42:47.200]  pronounce that Moskva Moskva what's the name of that shit I pronounced it right
[42:47.200 --> 42:54.280]  wow mommy wow I'm a big kid now I'm not too good at pronouncing things sometimes
[42:54.280 --> 42:58.800]  the missile cruiser dubbed the carrier killer by NATO has passed through the
[42:58.800 --> 43:02.400]  Straits of Gibraltar and is now heading towards the Eastern Mediterranean to
[43:02.400 --> 43:08.520]  assume command of Russian naval forces I've been telling folks for two and a
[43:08.520 --> 43:13.000]  half years that Syria is meant to be the detonator for a larger regional war
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.080]  that the Rand Corporation five years ago called for they said we don't need to
[43:18.080 --> 43:23.400]  help get the new order in with these small wars we need big ins and to lead
[43:23.400 --> 43:29.400]  the big war a peace prize winner that's globalist humor call the Patriot Act
[43:29.400 --> 43:35.320]  patriotic called for struggling kids written up by big pharma call it new
[43:35.320 --> 43:41.160]  freedom by the way to talk about what an Orwellian state we're in in the name of
[43:41.160 --> 43:44.840]  safety getting rid of everybody's rights I'll briefly tell the story and play an
[43:44.840 --> 43:51.080]  Obama clip and go to your calls I like music that I like I like famous people
[43:51.080 --> 43:54.320]  that I like because they're interesting artist or I admire them I don't just
[43:54.320 --> 43:58.200]  like people because they're famous and I'm not saying I'm some wonderful
[43:58.200 --> 44:02.600]  virtuous person but you know that I don't like famous people it's just that
[44:02.600 --> 44:06.320]  I've grown out of that by the time I was about 20 and I was never really into it
[44:06.320 --> 44:14.560]  you know I didn't pick up tabloids to read about the latest scandals but I
[44:14.560 --> 44:18.240]  really like Dave Mustang and his wife I've known him for years and he's a
[44:18.240 --> 44:22.480]  really sweet smart guy he has a lot of courage for what he's politically you
[44:22.480 --> 44:26.200]  stood up for him and attacked because they really want to slap down famous
[44:26.200 --> 44:29.640]  entertainers and people so that they can intimidate others and they tell
[44:29.640 --> 44:35.040]  people cross the board music film you name it you speak out against government
[44:35.040 --> 44:40.760]  we're going to ruin your career people are told this so I admire Dave he's a
[44:40.760 --> 44:45.320]  lot of courage and so you know obviously when they come to town they
[44:45.320 --> 44:51.440]  invite me out to the show and so we we went out to the big formula one race
[44:51.440 --> 44:54.480]  track I've never been out there and I've driven by it before when the leader
[44:54.480 --> 44:57.880]  being shuttled in by helicopter sometimes like a hundred helicopters in the
[44:57.880 --> 45:01.400]  air bringing them back and forth from Austin out out west we're out east to
[45:01.400 --> 45:12.040]  the to the formula one track so I go out there to the sold-out show and we park
[45:12.040 --> 45:16.040]  and then oh well yeah you go to will call get your get your tickets they put up
[45:16.040 --> 45:21.040]  there for you and then and then they go no you got to go around to the VIP area
[45:21.040 --> 45:23.280]  that's where they're waiting that's what the late ticket harness and I'm told to
[45:23.280 --> 45:28.560]  come here they go and told by who and all these workers were just treating
[45:28.560 --> 45:32.280]  people so bad and of course I've been to other shows if I get us done it's not
[45:32.280 --> 45:36.360]  been like this it was like the spirit of the whole you know but I mean I mean the
[45:36.360 --> 45:39.000]  crowd was great the people were great I couldn't believe how many infall wars
[45:39.000 --> 45:43.560]  t-shirts I saw literally I got mobbed you know doing autographs and pictures of
[45:43.560 --> 45:47.440]  it just was amazing and I was in the dark out there you know because I didn't
[45:47.440 --> 45:50.920]  want to stay backstage I was you know watching Megadeth and then Iron Maiden
[45:50.920 --> 46:00.600]  and I like you know heavy hard fast music you know grew up on it words can't
[46:00.600 --> 46:04.360]  describe it the the point is is that I like being invited to those things and
[46:04.360 --> 46:07.000]  I like it when it's at the double year something a smaller venue and going the
[46:07.000 --> 46:16.600]  back this was amazing with the security people who were just looking for someone
[46:16.600 --> 46:22.320]  to mess with and I watched them doing it to other people Iron Maiden security
[46:22.320 --> 46:29.840]  people and you're sitting there walking backstage you know to walk back out front
[46:29.840 --> 46:33.280]  and some big guy jumps out in front of you and wants to have a fight with you
[46:33.280 --> 46:37.160]  and you're like no I'm just going out there have my all-access pass and they
[46:37.160 --> 46:41.000]  still get in your face like they want to fight you and it's just so wimpy you know
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.960]  it's like wow this but this is the spirit of the New World Order but that's
[46:43.960 --> 46:50.920]  not why I started telling the story on this 9-11 anniversary I get sent around
[46:50.920 --> 46:54.960]  so now they have to go get my tickets that were actually up front and this
[46:54.960 --> 46:58.520]  place is the size of a space of a you know the Death Star or something I mean
[46:58.520 --> 47:02.760]  this is a humongous facility it's probably a half mile from the front to
[47:02.760 --> 47:09.640]  the back of just the arena they have to send people to get the tickets and the
[47:09.640 --> 47:15.320]  passes and come all the way to the back and at the back at the VIP entrance but
[47:15.320 --> 47:19.880]  they have this up front too they had groped downs going on so I walk in there
[47:19.880 --> 47:23.000]  with one of my friends and his lovely wife you know she looks like a model
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.040]  like a Miss America I'm not going to say her name I mean they told me I could
[47:27.040 --> 47:30.920]  tell the story but I'm not gonna do it and we walk right through they don't the
[47:30.920 --> 47:38.000]  shaved head woman shaved head but like she could bench press 300 pounds she
[47:38.000 --> 47:46.960]  didn't want to pat us down she went right for the blonde that we were with my
[47:46.960 --> 47:52.800]  friend and I mean boom boom and we're almost like you know what let's just
[47:52.800 --> 47:57.200]  not let's not go in here I'm like the point was it was being poked the whole
[47:57.200 --> 48:01.920]  time I was in there poked by security poked poked poked then we'd walk out and
[48:01.920 --> 48:05.360]  try to walk up top and watch that's where the music was best far back as it was so
[48:05.360 --> 48:08.880]  loud and there would just be some sniveling minimum wage ladies it was
[48:08.880 --> 48:12.160]  like four feet tall because she weighed like 800 pounds literally was like a
[48:12.160 --> 48:15.560]  self-propelled I'm not being mean to fat people just I'm describing her it was
[48:15.560 --> 48:20.480]  like Jabba the hut a female job of the hut comes over and bumps into us and
[48:20.480 --> 48:23.920]  says you can't stand here and we've been standing there earlier was a huge wide
[48:23.920 --> 48:28.360]  area we're like the moon's out it's all beautiful night magic evening never heard
[48:28.360 --> 48:34.160]  mega death be better even back when I was like you know 14 years old amazing so I
[48:34.160 --> 48:44.200]  really enjoyed that and I just thought about what a weird country we are that I
[48:44.200 --> 48:55.600]  mean obviously this woman has taken this job so they can just play God and they
[48:55.600 --> 49:00.200]  just completely ignore us you can walk right through by the way we were wearing
[49:00.200 --> 49:07.800]  more baggy shirts Amy was wearing a tight shirt and pants and cowboy boots and
[49:07.800 --> 49:11.600]  we're just double-taked why did they let us through and they're doing that to her
[49:11.600 --> 49:16.240]  well I mean it was insane then I we sat back and watched as more attractive
[49:16.240 --> 49:20.360]  women came up I've seen this with the TSA what do you think happened imagine
[49:20.360 --> 49:24.160]  that's the security you give someone a slot where they can dominate and have
[49:24.160 --> 49:29.080]  power over people and my instinct is I'm trying to walk down and go out front
[49:29.080 --> 49:31.960]  this is where they showed us to go before we have an all-access pass and
[49:31.960 --> 49:35.720]  some guy jumps out in front of me goes goes you can't come out here and he was
[49:35.720 --> 49:40.460]  I don't care what that says I'm like okay well I'm just trying to follow you'll
[49:40.460 --> 49:43.640]  Pam Mustaine right down through here I'm like okay I go where's the other way
[49:43.640 --> 49:48.000]  and he goes I'm not gonna tell you that and every instinct in me and believe me
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.600]  folks I've been in fights with people that weigh 300 pounds it can bench press
[49:50.600 --> 49:54.280]  like 500 pounds and I'd stop their head in the ground I can only get excited when
[49:54.280 --> 49:58.160]  some big guy gets in my face and but I'm almost 40 years old I had to control
[49:58.160 --> 50:02.040]  myself I was like yes sir thank you he got off on that and I could only control
[50:02.040 --> 50:07.160]  myself by realizing how pathetic and weak he was but I I officially cannot go to
[50:07.160 --> 50:10.840]  any football games I can't go to the kite festival they have US Army out there
[50:10.840 --> 50:16.360]  doing that now I'm literally I'm living in a giant concentration camp I'm living
[50:16.360 --> 50:20.360]  in a giant concentration camp and the jobs in America now are for every
[50:20.360 --> 50:24.800]  control freak to push people around and boss them around and get in their face
[50:24.800 --> 50:30.280]  and the epicenter of it is North Korea Pyongyang or however you pronounce it
[50:30.280 --> 50:40.200]  Pyongyang Washington DC Pyongyang on the Potomac where they kill veterans you

[55:03.720 --> 55:09.040]  good guys here it's just that the West is starting the war that is going to
[55:09.040 --> 55:13.000]  bring Iran into it and then that will be a big political diversion for the
[55:13.000 --> 55:17.080]  globalist who can loot the bank accounts and raise the taxes and get
[55:17.080 --> 55:22.120]  everybody in line during a war that's the type of news that we've got here

[55:32.400 --> 55:36.600]  collapse of the Western establishment that he believes is starting to happen
[55:36.600 --> 55:43.800]  that when you guys print me that New York observer article from a couple days
[55:43.800 --> 55:48.600]  ago where that other analysts was still calling it you know likeening what's
[55:48.600 --> 55:51.280]  happening with Obama to the fall of the Soviet Union which is directly what we've
[55:51.280 --> 55:55.640]  been saying I don't just say that that's where this is leading because it's all
[55:55.640 --> 55:59.000]  the fraud ladies and gentlemen no one buys the propaganda anymore and then
[55:59.000 --> 56:03.120]  Dr. Edward Vieira is going to pop in briefly on impeachment and and ways
[56:03.120 --> 56:06.920]  constitutionally to stop Obama if he tries to ignore Congress constitutional
[56:06.920 --> 56:11.240]  lawyer advisor to Congress be joining us Scott and Colorado thanks for calling in
[56:11.240 --> 56:16.400]  here on the air what's your take on this 12-year anniversary of 9-11 sir I'm
[56:16.400 --> 56:20.880]  appalled Alex can you hear me yes sir yeah nice to talk to you boss first time
[56:20.880 --> 56:26.520]  caller long-time listener I was just reading on the website today on the WCB
[56:26.520 --> 56:33.320]  ABC Boston app Carlos Aredondo on Wednesday received an award named for
[56:33.320 --> 56:38.160]  Madeline a fleet we flight attendant on the first of the hijack Logan Airport
[56:38.160 --> 56:42.560]  planes thrown into the World Trade Center evidently they've given him an
[56:42.560 --> 56:48.600]  award and Jeffrey Bowman was there to embrace him as he was presented the
[56:48.600 --> 56:53.480]  award in the Massachusetts State House I don't know this whole thing is making
[56:53.480 --> 56:59.640]  me incredibly sick false flag anniversary is honoring these actors and
[56:59.640 --> 57:04.280]  these false narratives I just wondered how long it's gonna go on and people are
[57:04.280 --> 57:10.080]  gonna buy into it well it is true they've been caught in Syria and they've been
[57:10.080 --> 57:16.080]  caught in Iran the West has and they've been caught in Egypt staging fake
[57:16.080 --> 57:22.800]  shootings with fake blood and stuff of of demonstrators I mean our government
[57:22.800 --> 57:26.280]  has been caught coordinating fake stuff overseas they admit they're engaged in
[57:26.280 --> 57:31.160]  fake domestic psyops that have been illegal so yes a lot of this stuff is
[57:31.160 --> 57:35.720]  fake but they'll also a lot of times kill some real people see folks think it's
[57:35.720 --> 57:41.520]  all fake at the Boston bombing or it's all fake at Sandy Hook and what we've
[57:41.520 --> 57:45.400]  got is is that they kill some real people because they like doing that and
[57:45.400 --> 57:50.480]  that's real then they'll have some other actors there to push the narrative and
[57:50.480 --> 57:55.080]  say what they want said minute one that's why they had a drill of a bombing
[57:55.080 --> 58:00.200]  minutes before right there at the finish line and it turns out they did have
[58:00.200 --> 58:06.720]  crisis actor groups hired that's been confirmed so yeah but but then the media
[58:06.720 --> 58:11.480]  will then say Alex says nobody got hurt and then there's different schools of
[58:11.480 --> 58:14.000]  thought but I mean they're totally capable of it they've been caught before
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.600]  and I mean I have seen the photos and video of people with their clothes blown
[58:18.600 --> 58:24.080]  off and no holes are blood and then a minute later when they've dolled them
[58:24.080 --> 58:28.680]  up now suddenly blood everywhere I mean it's it looks real bad it looks real bad
[58:28.680 --> 58:33.000]  I don't know it's like on 9-11 they had guys pop it up given the official story
[58:33.000 --> 58:40.160]  minutes after clearly scripted they had their scripting all across the news

[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:46.000]  more and more I should combine NPR with the South Park teacher voice and the
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.120]  toilet safety police you know America is turning into the toilet safety police

[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:02.120]  backgrounds or I'm a I'm a defrock priest and so now I well I I take a
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:08.560]  specific interest well in guess what I mean it is amazing what we put up with
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:14.360]  and and we're see our world being designed and set up to provide places of
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.920]  power for parasites and miscreant control freaks who revel in manipulating
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:23.760]  our lives Paul Revere in California I held you over the last segment you
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.880]  wanted to talk about solutions on the 12 year anniversary of the date the
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.680]  globalist believe destroyed the Republic but I believe that they jumped the
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:37.680]  shark and that now false flag is part of the popular nomenclature and that it is
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:43.240]  now backfiring on them but time will tell but to go ahead Paul Revere with
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:49.160]  your comments yes Alex so you mentioned at the beginning of the broadcast how
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:54.040]  you thought that it was actually more like our Lexington moments 9-11 and of
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:59.480]  course as a Paul Revere fanatic when dr. Joseph Warren and myself got
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:06.120]  together and started to wake up the hillsides around Acton Concord Lexington
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:12.880]  we were without Facebook without Twitter without telephone texting internet
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:17.800]  and you were you were also terrorist extremist oh yeah well that's right
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:23.240]  Alex we were a terrorist extremist but don't pay no mind to that we were maybe
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:26.360]  this is how we do the show now if you call in you have to talk and be our
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:33.320]  voice okay oh by the way oh we run your life for your races we we tell you what
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:37.280]  to do or we'll say you're guilty but if you do what we say we'll patch on the
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:42.400]  head while taking your wallet oh I'm really a liberal trending I'm not a
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:48.680]  high-tech you know advertisement warfare system oh I never mind the drones of the
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:53.040]  men in black uniforms we're liberal oh it's not threatening I'm telling you of
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.280]  the Nazis would have wore pink uniforms and said you were racist if you didn't
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:02.320]  report to a sand ditch to be shot in the head if Hitler showed up today and said
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:05.200]  kill yourself for your racist the average America would take a double-edged
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.400]  dagger and ram it into a throat his blood spur I don't want to be racist
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:13.080]  Hitler I'm telling you I'm telling you I mean I'm convinced you could probably
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:17.360]  walk up to women now in grocery stores and say if you don't come home with me
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.520]  and have sex with me you're racist and I think liberal women would say let's go
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:27.960]  right now okay I'm gonna bash your brains out of your racist good to ball

[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.680]  Washington DC you know what the answer is Alex we need to burn bicycles
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:52.040]  especially bicycles over 10 speeds and that are you can't trust the citizen with
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:57.320]  a big motorcycle I mean you might do something bad you saw they defied the
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.440]  order so we're gonna have to ban all motorcycles like the clown that made
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:04.880]  front of Obama now all the clowns have to pay hundreds of dollars for
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.920]  sensitivity training they're all guilty everyone that has a motorcycle needs to
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:14.480]  be given a ticket now for defying the incredible can we see the wonderful DC

[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:34.920]  14,000 people by the end of April 20th 1775 I see those people hadn't been
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:40.080]  drinking fluoride all day yeah those were men those were men that when
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.160]  someone who were nice and loving their families but if you tried to push them
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.600]  around they couldn't back down because they were men it's not normal to just
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.160]  keep backing down but this whole world is about teaching us to back down and I'm
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:14:00.320]  done doing it go ahead I'm sorry well there was a famous quote by our captain
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:05.640]  Levi Preston when he was asked years later and he said the fact why we went
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:12.200]  to war is that the they meant they did not want us to govern ourselves and we
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:19.720]  were always meant to and you know to say your wife's lovely gonna have to check

[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:51.360]  and talk to John in Texas you're on the air go ahead hi Alex hey buddy you know
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:55.600]  one thing I resent about Ted Cruz and Rand Paul first off the fact that they
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.720]  still bleed the fairy tale of 9-1-1 and second off that they've been talking on
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:04.400]  TV they've already convicted us to not a side of that chemical attack when
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:08.600]  there's no proof that he did it as of yet well actually I mean I've seen Rand
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.800]  Paul and Ted Cruz say there's not proof of that and they are playing politics a
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.000]  little let me just tell you Ron Paul's gone public about false flags Ron Paul
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.560]  knows what really happened on 9-11 he's out of Congress I can you know tell you
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.200]  just from the what he said when he's written he's smart as I am or smarter
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.280]  he's as smart as you are he knows he's given he's talked about it before that
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.120]  clearly there's a history of false flags and anyway you slice it our government
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:34.960]  helped create al-Qaeda so they did it inadvertently and then and then you can't
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.680]  debate it and so when they go we shouldn't be al-Qaeda's air force nobody's
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:42.880]  saying Assad's perfect Assad isn't perfect you don't come and say Assad's a
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:48.240]  wonderful guy and you know and and no you say look he didn't attack anybody
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.560]  sure it's a quasi dictatorship but it's better than al-Qaeda it's not our
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:56.880]  business I mean you've heard Rand Paul come out and say that Assad did the
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:02.040]  chemical attack yeah I heard him that just the other just yesterday I think I
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:05.000]  was it last night last night earlier that speech he did I didn't have time to
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.080]  watch the whole thing I mean he may have been playing dead voles advocate like
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.640]  you know even if Assad did the chemical code I haven't seen it yet I mean what
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.960]  did he say oh we just did that yeah we shouldn't get involved but if I did this
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.160]  and then we think we should be tribe in an international tribunal or something
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:24.560]  like that you know now I told you last week that I thought that the fact that
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:27.880]  some of those Syrians survived that chemical attack by using homemade gas
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:32.680]  masks that it was probably chlorine gas in the fact that chlorine gas is so
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.680]  simple to make you go to a swimming pool supply store and get the stuff to do it
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:40.320]  anybody could do it that's right you were an NBC guy in the army right yes and
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:46.280]  uh and in nervous in chlorine gas and low doses it's a complicated gas but if
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.800]  you're on a chlorine gas there's always disasters down in Houston and Texas
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:54.080]  City every decade or so kill a bunch of people when when when a couple of those
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:19:00.200]  tanks mix and chlorine gas gets dumped out well the band chlorine it's racist
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:05.600]  I'm sorry I said in low doses if you're on the outline edges of the attack it
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:09.600]  acts like a tear gas that's why you they got those videos those kids run around
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.840]  the hospital well look clearly some of those people that hit with something but
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:17.120]  I've seen new videos where they're flopping around it's fake it looks like
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:23.800]  some fake holy rolling stuff I mean it just totally fake now pouring gases as
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:28.400]  the crew gas aside got nerve agents and he's not gonna mess around with chlorine
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:32.600]  gas if he's gonna use a chemical or weapon he's gonna be a nerve agent in a
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.160]  drop the size of a pin at anywhere on your skin I don't have to respond I
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:42.680]  don't have to respond to your facts racist how does that feel I'm better than
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:49.440]  you now I said a racist or racist racist what do you say to that racist

[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:27.720]  calls dr. Paul Craig Roberts former head of policy department of Treasury
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:32.280]  father ergonomics frequent guest because his analysis has been so accurate and
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.360]  spot-on and then out close to a decade we've been having him on he wrote a few
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:42.240]  weeks ago that the diplomatic implosion of the new lie to escalate the ongoing
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:47.440]  proxy war in Syria signified the beginning of the collapse of the US
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.440]  Empire like the Soviet Union and that's something that I've been saying as well
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:56.440]  just as you can see it there clears the nose on your face Conrad Black wrote a
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:00.880]  piece that pretty much followed what Roberts has said a few weeks before
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:06.640]  collapse of American influence recalls disintegration of Soviet Union fall of
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:13.080]  France only 9-11 which they intend to be the murderous blow in our Republic to
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:18.280]  transfer us into a militarized imperial system only that has propped it up this
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:23.560]  long and I believe a new one will fail people really know now about false flag
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:27.320]  it there's a mass awakening happening that's my view I agree with Roberts that
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:31.720]  there's a collapse and confidence in the system but I don't know his view on how
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:36.200]  big the awakening is or if he disagrees we'll find out right now and we of
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:40.960]  course carry his news articles up on info wars dot com you can go to his site
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:45.000]  Paul Craig Roberts dot org excellent site with all of his analysis and you
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.800]  can find his books there dr. Roberts you heard my intro there where are we
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:53.680]  historically my gut tells me the stars are aligning but within this paradox
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:58.280]  within this corridor within this crossroads the enemy could also really
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:05.520]  pull some stuff as well well they won't give up I'm pretty sure that you know
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:14.640]  what's so strange Alex is the world now is looking to Russia for leadership it's
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:21.360]  a real switch from the latter half of the 20th century so I think that the
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:28.720]  United States has done itself in with its lies it should not have tried to pull
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:37.160]  off in Syria the same level of lies that it that it used for Iraq or Libya so I
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:41.440]  think the world is is caught on and it's left the United States in a very
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:46.160]  isolated position it has to be embarrassing to be a superpower and
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:54.280]  have your main puppet state the United Kingdom vote down your warplans I
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:03.520]  think that what there is still some risk you see a Putin simply outsmarted
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:10.600]  the White House moron and when they when the Russians announced that the
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:14.760]  Syrians would give up their nuclear weapons and put them under international
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:21.040]  control the White House didn't know what to do they had the rug pulled out
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:27.960]  under them so they sent out their French puppet and to tell the Russians that
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:34.600]  France would draw up the agreement and would stick in there the option of
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:41.800]  military action against Syria well the Russians know what that means and so
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:46.120]  they of course won't stand for that because once they get any kind of
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:54.040]  agreement that has a military option they'll claim it has to be utilized so I
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:28:00.360]  think for now the United States is very much on the defensive it hasn't any
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:04.800]  diplomacy it's abandoned even by most of its
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:09.960]  puppets the curious thing is France you know I can remember when the French
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:15.840]  were very proud and independent Charles de Gaulle would not let France be a
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.800]  NATO he said he didn't want to be part of some American operation that France was
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:26.520]  a sovereign country and now it seems that they're very willing to be
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:34.800]  Washington's for but other than that there's really no support for Washington
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:39.200]  it is insane you said on my broadcast about five years ago that the US had
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:43.440]  lost its soft power and before there were really not a lot of good countries
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:46.120]  out there so even though America wasn't perfect the world looked at us as the
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:52.040]  good guys we're now seen as the bad guys and now they're calling you know on
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:56.480]  Drudge Report Putin leader of the free world I mean that's got to really shake
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:02.440]  up the council on foreign relations oh yes I think it has it's they over
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:09.280]  reached they left a hubris run away with them you say I think what happened they
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:15.520]  got away with 9-11 and they figured if people were stupid enough to fall for
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:21.920]  their asinine explanation of 9-11 that they could tell people anything and so
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:27.040]  they began doing that just telling them anything and they got carried away with
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:33.280]  it well enough time passed and enough people such as yourself made efforts
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:39.160]  and people began catching on they've been begin seeing the pattern absolutely
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:42.880]  stay there dr. Robert's gonna come back and look at 9-11 12 years later we'll

[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:20.960]  resources to understand what's happening a great place to start is
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:25.760]  paulcrickroberts.org and if you just tuned in he's the former head of policy
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:30.840]  at the Treasury the father of economics he was involved in diplomacy and is one
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:36.920]  international awards and diplomacy for working to phase in the transition of
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:41.680]  the fall of the Soviet Union so he's uniquely placed to be able to break this
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:46.240]  down for us and he's a part a lot of the most prominent Washington think tanks as
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:51.400]  well and he's been warning of the real direction America's going because of
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:54.920]  losing soft power and becoming completely immoral in the governing level
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:57.680]  so in the next 10 minutes I'm gonna try to give you the floor sir I'd like you
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.600]  to break down the question I prefaced looking out what concerns you what do
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:08.140]  you see as positive what do you expect the establishment the Craven
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:13.760]  establishment to do full of hubris and other key points that you think people
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:19.440]  should be made aware of out there. Well Alex this this question of yours would
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:27.560]  be much easier to answer when we see if the Obama regime and Israelis and the
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:34.520]  Israel lobby can maneuver somehow around the agreement that the Russians have
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:39.960]  brought forth that the Syrians are simply dispossessed themselves of all
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:47.320]  chemical weapons now if the Obama regime can't get around that it really means
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:53.960]  the end of the neoconservative project from New American Century in which they
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:59.640]  laid out all the countries they were going to overthrow you know Libya Iraq
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:05.640]  Afghanistan Syria another hundred year Reich that would never die that died in
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:11.400]  just a decade yeah right but if it stops and they can't get Syria then that whole
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:17.040]  program has been defeated and I don't think they want to give it up it's it's a
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:22.920]  very important thing to the neoconservatives to the military security
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:32.120]  complex to Wall Street to the Israeli government and these are powerful forces
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:41.360]  and they will do whatever they can to get around the fact that Russia and Syria
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:50.720]  have removed the manufactured excuse by the Obama regime for continuing on this
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:56.160]  policy of conquest so I don't think it's we can't answer it until we see what
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:04.360]  happens what what does the Obama regime do now and once we see that if for
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:10.760]  example they go and pull off some other false flag event and blame Syria in
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:17.520]  claim self-defense for example it'd be very easy for the Israelis to have the
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:24.480]  so-called Syrian rebels to launch chemical weapons on to Israel and then
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:31.480]  Israel can claim self-defense and doesn't need a UN resolution or any kind of
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:34.920]  cover exactly that's what I've been predicting but the problem and now the
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:39.000]  Russians say they have intel but but now no one buys it and a lot of the
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.440]  Israelis that call into the show they don't want to side with al-Qaeda I
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:46.280]  think it's the fact that the West is backing al-Qaeda has shown the emperor
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:51.200]  has no clothes but Israel or the elements running it how do they think
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:59.280]  they're going to get away with putting al-Qaeda in charge of Syria well it
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:05.800]  suits the purpose because it destroys it first of all no one will be in charge
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:10.760]  it'll be like Iraq today this the government doesn't really have control
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:16.520]  or like Libya it's an immoral destabilization program it's it destabilizes
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:21.880]  it turns the people against each other and there's no organized government and
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:29.240]  of course the the main purpose of this is to further radicalize the Muslims so
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:34.720]  that it spreads into the Russian and Chinese populations you know both
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:39.480]  countries have Muslim populations that's the key and you crystallize it on
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:44.320]  record the secret of the clash of civilizations is they are using radical
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:50.080]  Islam like a new form of globalist new world order Anglo-American colonization
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:55.160]  of worldwide destabilization while using the Muslim threat to take our rights at
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:41:01.360]  home as well what a masterstroke well you summed it up that's exactly what the
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:08.760]  policy is but you see if it stops now in Syria I don't know what they'll do
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.360]  of course they have a lot of hubris I mean you had to have a lot of hubris to
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:21.480]  stage this obviously transparent lie that Assad had used chemical weapons first
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:26.760]  of all suppose he did it's none of our business he didn't use him against us
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:32.960]  he's not attacked anyone he's defending the country from outside invaders and so
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:37.280]  the fact that he's used chemical weapons or didn't use chemical weapons it
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:42.560]  doesn't give the United States an excuse but clearly he didn't I mean I know I
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:45.600]  know we didn't of course he didn't but I'm just saying even if you did he's
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.680]  making a difference it's still not an excuse there's nothing in the
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:53.960]  international law that says the United States can attack a country that uses
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:57.720]  chemical weapons against an enemy who attacks it well that's what's so amazing
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:01.480]  as Obama says we're not gonna have boots on the ground they started the war as
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:05.840]  you said it's outrageous yeah well the United States uses chemical weapons
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:11.960]  continuously I mean what do you think white phosphorus is a new uranium and
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:16.000]  and look what they what the United States did to the people in Vietnam with
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:25.560]  Agent Orange you know there's over 150,000 kids born with facial deformities
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:30.520]  from Agent Orange I mean the United States is the biggest and worst the
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:34.700]  user of chemical weapons in fact the United States he's used more chemical
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:40.920]  weapons against more people than every other country in the world combined so
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:47.800]  obviously when they stand on this high horse oh it's just it's just fabricated
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:53.640]  it's an orchestrated excuse so they want to attack it so now the excuse they
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:58.200]  fabricated the Russians have taken it away from they'll try to get another
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:04.960]  excuse and it's true people see through them now but when you're full of hubris
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:11.160]  you you make mistakes and so the United States government is completely capable
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:15.840]  of making an even bigger fool of itself and then what you have to worry about
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.400]  when they realize that the whole world sees through them that they that they're
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:26.720]  they're despised that they pull out the nukes you can't trust people the kind of
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:30.200]  people that are in the United States government really can't be trusted with
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:37.560]  BB guys much less with nuclear weapons why don't we have why don't we have the
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:41.800]  United States turn over its chemical weapons the whole world would be a lot
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:48.360]  safer let Syria keep theirs but get them away from the Americans that's what's
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:53.360]  dangerous especially the nuclear weapons if the world was to be safe they've got
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:58.040]  to get the weapons of mass destruction away from the United States because
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:01.280]  because we're occupied how do we get the word out that this isn't really even
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:05.680]  the US government and that it's these kleptocratic you know financial
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:12.680]  interests that that love to use destabilization well you know it looks
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:17.640]  to me like we're headed into a depression I mean we've never had a
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:23.360]  recovery there's nothing to drive the economy I would expect that a year from
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:27.760]  now we're being in depression and this may help people see that they don't
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:33.440]  really have a government that no one represents them and that everything is
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:40.240]  key toward a handful of powerful private interest groups I think just as
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:45.960]  things unfold and develop people catch on that's about the only way I mean you
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:52.400]  can sit down and try to tell them and you run into a lot of resistance you know
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:56.640]  I run into a lot less though Dr. Roberts I mean I really see positive things
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:02.680]  happening out there on the street and you know what hurts my feelings is just
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:06.520]  for humanity how they use the Balkanization I'm not anti-Israel you've
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:10.080]  never been anti-Israel you get called anti-Israel because you point out it's
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:13.840]  immoral for the people running the Israeli government to be putting al-Qaeda
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:17.620]  into a country and to be caught arming them just like Turkey's doing in the
[01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:21.040]  French everybody else we're not anti-France when we say it's wrong the
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:24.480]  French government's doing it we're not anti-America when we say Obama's wrong
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:29.440]  it's like this hands-off don't criticize Israel I think that's backfiring and
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:35.120]  it's really making it sexy to criticize Israel in outlandish ways instead of
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:41.440]  really criticizing Israel for what's wrong well I think the Israel lobby over
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:49.960]  used the anti-Semitic slur because now anyone who criticizes any aspect of
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:56.160]  Israeli policy is said to be anti-Semitic so now they have to apply it to a whole
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:03.400]  range of very prominent intellectual Jews so it's almost the entirety of the
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:11.360]  Jewish intelligentsia now or said to be anti-Semitic or salivating Jews so it
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:17.120]  doesn't work for them anymore and what it originally meant anti-Semitic meant
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:22.760]  somebody who hates the Jewish people but what it means now is that anybody that
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:28.320]  makes even a mile criticism of any policy that the Israeli government follows
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:33.200]  well I see this also backfiring like Ed Asner came out and said Hollywood I've
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:36.560]  been told this but people are as afraid to criticize Obama because they'll be
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:42.840]  called racist and and and so now any criticism of Obamacare it's all racist
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:47.600]  and I so I think that's been overused as well and there's a real backlash
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:52.480]  happening that's right but it all that you're right but what it also shows is
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:58.520]  when they have to take refuge and racist or anti-Semitic it means that their
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:05.680]  policies cannot stand examination and so they prevent anybody looking at the
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:11.560]  policies by throwing up this barrage of name-calling so it really shows how
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:17.320]  weak the position the intellectual or the integrity position is of the two
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:22.240]  countries when they pull this type of thing oh you criticize America you must
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:28.120]  not like white people oh you criticize Israel you must take Jews this shows
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:34.760]  that their policies cannot stand examination so I think it's a further
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:39.880]  sign of their weakness what does your gut tell you how this is going to end
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.320]  because I see even mainstream media saying Obama's buying his own propaganda
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.440]  the government looks like a joke we're imploding I see the power structure
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:53.920]  itself I'm getting to realize that they've way overplayed and that and that
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:58.240]  any confidence they had left is draining away very quickly I mean I've
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:01.960]  got my ear to the ground and let me tell you I mean this is collapse level and
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:05.200]  just like the Soviet Union probably really collapsed in the mid 80s it didn't
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:10.040]  happen till 1991 officially I think that it may still start World War 3 and I
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:14.280]  guess win that way by blowing the earth up but but but my gut and an
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:18.160]  intellectually historically tells me I think they've already collapsed or
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:22.440]  they're in the process of collapsing right now well I agree with you I think
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:27.320]  they've been exposed and and the world no longer has any confidence in anything
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:32.640]  that the United States government says or the Israeli government and they're
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:37.400]  exposed and and that they they are collapsing now it doesn't mean they
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:42.080]  won't have they won't convince themselves in some way out of it or they
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:47.760]  have a way to recoup or they won't do something stupid that's still entirely
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:52.720]  a possibility and I think we should talk about this again in a week or two or
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:59.760]  whenever when we see what is the outcome you know a carry is very upset that the
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:05.320]  Russians outsmarted him and so is the Israeli government and so they're they're
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:10.920]  they're mad they're angry because they had it all set for an attack and now they
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:17.960]  they they can't so let's see how if they're defeated or if they pull
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:24.080]  something else and if they're defeated then I think we we see a lot more hope
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:30.120]  and really what people should do they should use this defeat to start
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:34.320]  removing these people from public office well that's the move to impeachment
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:37.600]  we got Walter Jones coming on he called us today I think tomorrow he's been very
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:41.520]  busy but I mean we've got to really take the moral high ground here and keep
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:46.320]  pushing and and also explain a fall of the American Empire is good for America
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:51.640]  we pay for it we don't get any of the spoils now Israel not being used for this
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:56.760]  global hegemonic technocracy that wants to destabilize everything not controlled
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:01.680]  by the hedge funds so they can suck these countries dry I think Israel not
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:05.640]  trying to expand is in the end going to be good for Israel because I think if
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:09.480]  they just keep pushing into Armageddon that's what we're going to get that's
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:16.720]  exactly you're right I agree with that I think that's the correct diagnosis
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:23.560]  prognosis and we'll have to just see what they do about Russia and the Syrian
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:33.920]  solution if they accept it then I think we've had a major change all for the
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:37.040]  better but they'll continue to inject more al-qaeda and I think we should point
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:40.120]  out that our government's funding al-qaeda and Jordan and sending them in
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:43.720]  we should hammer that and call for that to be stopped dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:46.560]  let's get a weekly update or as soon as things change we'll have you back on

[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:21.920]  new Christ and instead he is seriously struck to the globalist I want to be
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:24.440]  clear though this is the really dangerous time right now where they're
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:29.640]  going to throw curveballs you name it you've got a collection of groups that
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:34.600]  want to I mean that's what groups always do they always want to take land take
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:38.320]  infrastructure but the key here to get out to everybody that were going to your
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:41.560]  calls is exactly what I said and I know I've said this on air we need to
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:46.160]  quantify it and get the narrative the true narrative out to everybody the
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:54.920]  West has been radicalizing Islam for about a hundred years to use it as a
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:55:01.760]  weapon to take over groups that are not radical as a way to destabilize them
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:05.440]  then get control of the groups and then finance the groups to attack other
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:13.800]  people so there is a global caliphate forming that's true but they're always
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:16.640]  like let homeland security take over take all your rights on the caliphate will
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:22.680]  get you meanwhile it is a radical caliphate to destroy moderate Islam and
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:28.400]  what what I would say you know real Islam and so it's a false clash of
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:31.960]  civilizations and Dick Cheney and I wrote white papers on it how they are
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:36.640]  going to fund the radical Islam and then have clashes with it and that's what
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:39.800]  all these governments are doing I mean what it is real get caught her it's your
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:44.040]  Islam post creating fake al-Qaeda groups to stage bombings every time they
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:49.680]  wanted to have a diversion it was like like like Clinton bombing in Sudan the
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:53.080]  famous aspirin factory they said was making chemical weapons remember that
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:58.240]  and it was when it came out he was lying about Monica Lewinsky and if that
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:01.320]  would have become the big story oh he lied to us he might have had to step
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:05.680]  down so instead he fired missiles at its aspirin factory then when more stuff
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:12.160]  came out they attacked Iraq saying they didn't let inspectors in so see war is
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:16.200]  just good for all these corporations these companies Turkey wants the war to
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:20.920]  divert from their political stuff Israel wants one the communist French
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:25.800]  Hollandei Hollandei they're in a huge scandal how they all have secret bank
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:30.440]  accounts with billions in it of euros they don't pay taxes while raising the
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:36.920]  taxes to above 100% on the new Valriche you think the Rothschild French pay
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:40.800]  taxes no they're all offshore you think that it's all come out folks so they
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:47.320]  have to change the subject they don't want us talking about Warren Buffett the
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:51.920]  biggest recipient of the last six or seven rounds of bailouts in the last six

[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:21.200]  calling in on September 11th anniversary. Hi Alex thank you for taking my
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:29.680]  call I had a question there was a some documents sent to Reverend Michelle
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:37.560]  Hopkins from retired senator out of South Dakota Sheldon R Songstead about FEMA
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:43.760]  purchase orders that needed to be delivered to FEMA sector 3 and Austin
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:50.240]  Texas by October 1st I wanted to know is you know what it would I'm in I'm in
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:54.440]  FEMA region 6 formerly Texas in the region 3 is out on the East Coast but
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:59.800]  yes there's giant secret and public FEMA drills going on practicing martial
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:06.560]  law takeover basically toilet safety police type stuff everywhere mass
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:11.280]  roundups takeover of the media staging cyber attacks there's no telling what
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:17.040]  the Empire will do to try to sell all this war but we're to me is that they
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:22.440]  were ordering the MRE meals yeah ma'am that's that's that's not secret
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:27.560]  documents that's public there that they've never been storing more food my
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:32.280]  patriots supply.com that that big reputable group they they released the
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:40.000]  documents have the courage to do it showing that that Homeland Security was
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.680]  trying to buy everything basically they have and it turns out that's happening
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:47.440]  everywhere they're buying up the food the bullets the they're buying up any
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:53.320]  amount of guns that can be imported even non-military the government is in every
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:57.040]  fashion preparing for war against the people and admitting that because it is
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:04.600]  an alien globalist government. They also wanted all the GPS and satellites to be
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:09.720]  on the same wavelength and the test date to be September 29th. No no that's right
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:13.600]  I mean there's been a decade-long program to unify all the frequency so the
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:17.520]  feds can control everything and so they can command everything and so they can
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:22.080]  cut everything off just like they did in Katrina cutting down the police radio
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:25.440]  line when they refused to stand down they were ordered to stand down so riding
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:28.400]  could start that's all on record so FEMA could then get more power saying oh
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:32.200]  look we failed because in every other country they fire you when you fail in
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:36.680]  America you get rewarded when you fail oh Norad stood down oh you let the hijackers
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:40.440]  in oh you protected them on record oh here's here let's triple the budget of
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:45.200]  the Homeland Security which before was the Department of Defense and and FBI and
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:48.680]  all those groups but they just renamed the whole security complex from the
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:52.720]  omnibus crime bill and turn it into that mess so yeah there's big FEMA drills
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:57.960]  going on all over the place they're scurrying around like a pack of criminals
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:03.680]  because I guess they are. The date that they want everything done by October
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:10.360]  1st. Yeah man there's a drill there's a drill October into November it's a month
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:13.720]  plus long drills like five weeks well there's one's four weeks one's five
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:18.120]  weeks one's six weeks they all overlap basically for total power grid failure
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:24.360]  martial law riot police called up federalization drills a total martial
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:29.280]  law takeover drill not just in FEMA region three but in other areas and to
[02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:33.160]  prime the pump they're telling all the police that there's real intelligence on
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:37.000]  the terror attack and that this is not really a drill they're just on the public
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.560]  this because they may blow stuff up and blame it on Syria you understand yes and
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:45.480]  then have nuclear war and then go into their bunkers while we all die on the
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:50.280]  surface and why because they're look at John Kerry I mean the man is a demon look
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:55.160]  at Obama look at Skull and Mones I mean these are people that bathe in giant vats

[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:27.680]  the love in your mother's eyes beautiful song we are back live ladies and
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:32.840]  gentlemen transmitting broadcasting a worldwide and we stand for the truth I
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:36.600]  mean that's it we're trying to unify humanity around ideas of basic human
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:42.000]  liberty and freedom and kinship and honor and fealty towards common sense
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:48.040]  injustice and we strive to lift up society and to aspire to the more
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:57.320]  beautiful angels of humankind instead of man's more wicked angels as it was
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:02.440]  once said and that is our goal and that's where we stand and that's who we
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:07.360]  are and that's why the system will attack us so many people feel powerless
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:11.000]  so they join the dark side believing they're going to gain power from it and
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.960]  all you do is become a slave ladies and gentlemen but when you decide to start
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:18.520]  doing the right thing and also decide that you're valuable and that you're
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:23.000]  part of a greater destiny then you will be fulfilled in Madison Avenue can't
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:28.280]  make you feel inadequate anymore I look at how insecure and narcissistic and
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:33.640]  desperate people are desperate to feel like they have status desperate to feel
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:38.480]  like they have power desperate but they want to do it through the system instead
[02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:42.760]  of realizing that you already have incredible power you come from your
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:46.960]  ancestors and all they went through and that all our species will go through and
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:54.040]  that you're part of a great continuum 12 years after the New World Order
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:11:02.400]  clearly staged and launched and orchestrated the 9-11 attacks they are
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:07.600]  now publicly going into the next phase of their plan to turn the West and
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:13.440]  Europe and Eastern Europe and Asia over to radical Islam and then use that
[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:18.440]  attack by radical Islam to selectively enslave areas more already under their
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:23.200]  control to knock out countries they don't control and then roll in and put in
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:27.600]  tyranny the globalist want to enslave everyone the globalist want to build a
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:31.600]  horrible world the globalist are parasitic they want to reduce us down to
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:36.080]  absolute despotism to then carry out a eugenics population reduction program
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:42.280]  honest no one stands to gain from this except less than 6,000 top globalist in
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:46.320]  their own words and Rothkopf superclass book he breaks that down and I agree
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:50.800]  there's about 6,000 super gophers and less than 20 mega families that
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:53.760]  represent the Western establishment who are
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:58.800]  antithetically anti-western because they understand that it is antithetical to
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:04.040]  their program and they are demonizing the West and destroying our name while
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:09.240]  they use our energy and our insight and our inventiveness to dominate the world
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:14.480]  and while they move their assets to Russia and China they're even building
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:19.440]  them up is the new bipolar world but those bipolar systems continue to
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:24.480]  actually merge at the mercantile level just as the North American Union is
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:30.360]  merging with the EU since 2007 official treaty the average person doesn't even
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:35.000]  know it's already all being unified it's already being standardized everything
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:41.440]  from test scores to power prices to security protocols it's all happening
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:46.640]  it's all systematic one a new iPhone you're gonna have to biometrically
[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:49.720]  thumbprint you can't put a number into it you're gonna have to biometrically
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:53.960]  imprint and it's gonna sell that data to all the other companies to prepare
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:58.200]  everyone for the casual society and once that's in place they can tax you they
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:02.360]  can track you they can turn off your buying and selling with your hand and
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:05.960]  my son who goes to a big church here in Austin I think the preacher is a good
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:11.200]  guy I'm not judging him I think he has overall good you know just basic
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:15.800]  Bible church doctrine but they're like oh we're putting an Xbox you know connects
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:20.280]  clearly faith-based initiative funding and my son's like but these things watch
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:23.960]  you and face scan you in voice print and they go well that's fine they can watch
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:29.920]  us teach this through you know the teachings of Jesus now Sunday school to
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:38.000]  get more kids there is going to be video games so do anything to spread the
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:43.240]  gospel but then it isn't the gospel anymore and then you go to church you
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:46.800]  go to church like four times you can see every four times it's a homeland
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:53.560]  security sermon and you can't go anywhere we try go a little Baptist church
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:57.600]  really nice sweet people still it's a government worship sermon I just can't
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:07.400]  go to my wife I got this other big church with her and it's all basically go
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:11.760]  along with the system stuff like it's okay as long as your soul gets alright
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:14.960]  you're gonna be alright well you know what Christ is gonna say to people like
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:19.480]  that I'm not judging people just a fact my spirit tells me right off the bat you
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:23.880]  didn't go out and fight the evil toe-to-toe and admit what was going on I
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:29.600]  don't know who you are I mean Jesus Christ went out and got in the face of
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:33.880]  the tyrants and rebuked them and stood against them and then didn't resist in
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:39.480]  the end to show the sacrifice so they try to spin that say oh look be Christ like
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:43.440]  let them abuse you Christ did different things at different times when he said
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:46.480]  to those disciples most people are gonna hear me and they're not gonna
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:49.800]  understand they said why do you speak in these parables and these codes he goes
[02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:54.600]  because the profane aren't supposed to understand this only those that have
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:57.720]  spiritual discernment are supposed to be able to hear what I'm saying and then
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:01.720]  they will understand it each time is an example of how to deal with things at
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:10.080]  different points then they say you don't need to follow the Old Testament even
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:13.400]  though Christ said I've come not to get rid of the Old Testament but to fulfill
[02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:16.640]  it I mean it amongst their try to argue with these preachers we got a big
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:19.720]  preacher coming on Friday by the way I'm gonna just leave it at that we got
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:27.200]  some other really big guest but I don't like to say we have big guests coming on
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:32.240]  I'm gonna go to your calls because then people run and try to stop them it's like
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:36.320]  Chuck Yeager we found out was familiar with the show like some of the things
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:41.080]  I've done he wants to come on the show we were contacted by Chuck Yeager's
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:46.040]  people Chuck Yeager the living John Wayne the real deal that broke the
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:50.080]  sound barrier all that kids are like who's Chuck Yeager a World War II fighter
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:53.680]  ace I mean just amazing amazing that that's about as big as it gets okay I
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:57.320]  want to meet somebody like that for my grandfather's generation you know that
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:16:00.880]  chewed some of the same dirt literally and my grandfather's have been dead a
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:04.120]  long time this is a 90 something years old still jumping out of airplanes broke
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:11.280]  the sound barrier everything else amazing guy and then sure enough Chuck Yeager's
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:14.560]  lawyer says oh I need to go on that show with you when you do it and then oh you
[02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:21.400]  know what maybe you don't need to do that born September no no this day in
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:24.840]  aviation September 11th 1920s what they're talking about on the site you know
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:31.480]  who was born on September 11th a side so I mean that's the kind of stuff I deal
[02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:35.760]  with where where all the time people a lot more famous to Chuck Yeager contact
[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:39.240]  us want to come on then they get scared to come on well oh my gosh that's the
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:42.600]  guy that says the government runs Al Qaeda that's the guy that says 9-11's an
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:46.560]  inside job it wasn't inside job doesn't mean Bush is over there with the
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:50.880]  plunger like Wiley coyote doing it he reads off a teleprompter but the
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:55.200]  shadowy globalist forces had their fingerprints all over it ladies and
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:59.200]  gentlemen and so that's why a lot of times I don't announce who a big guest
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:07.880]  is until they directly come on the show oh look at this outrage over timing of
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:15.360]  Logan Airport drill this is out of CBS news the Massachusetts Port Authority
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:19.120]  conducted a drill Wednesday morning invoking smoke involving smoke and fire
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:23.240]  on the runway yeah they do these to terrorize you to create the perception
[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:27.000]  because there's no real terror that they don't run so they do it to drill the
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:30.880]  locals to make sure they've been federalized Boston Logan tweeted the
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:34.360]  smoke and fire was part of a drill heavy black smoke but see they do it very
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:38.480]  quietly I've been to drills where they announced that Belton Texas was attacked
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:42.160]  by terrorists and they even had blown up kids and when I was at the H.E.B. getting
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:45.520]  waters before I went down to the drill I knew it was gonna be happening people
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:49.080]  like did you hear they hit us it was running around H.E.B. I mean I have
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:54.120]  footage of this in my film Road to Tyranny everybody's running around the
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:18:00.640]  H.E.B. that those that I know that's a big grocery store chain and they're
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:05.440]  running around all scared I'm like man I knew there was a drill going on from my
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:08.840]  tip and let me get down here and I get down there and the U.S. Army and the
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:11.480]  Marines walk over officers and they're like you can't have cameras here and I
[02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:14.480]  go first amendment they go whoo them left us one then they had some Army
[02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:18.480]  soldier come over go hi you guys found us at an army checkpoint last year I
[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:22.560]  didn't like you filming me you can't film me now and I said I'll film you
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:26.160]  whenever I want he's like terrorists might come after me I go terrorist our
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:32.840]  government runs again when we've got this on footage it's in the film and then
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:36.120]  they had the mayor announced the terror attack like it was ready and the next day
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:40.680]  they had an article town hit by terrorists and the last line said it was a
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:45.040]  drill and that's what this is psych warfare the whole country is a giant
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:50.640]  reeducation camp folks and you know who's really brainwashed is the cops they
[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:53.920]  tell cops all the time it's a real terror threat there are real terror
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:57.040]  threats and the globalists run them when they want to blow something up it's
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:00.440]  gonna get blown up they're gonna have a drill to make sure all the cops are where
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:04.720]  they want them that day so the feds run the drill so they have everybody placed
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:11.480]  and then if their people get caught oh oh it was just a drill see how that works
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:16.960]  just a drill the tweets mark several other tweets asking why authorities
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:20.880]  they're not servants their authorities would choose September 11th to conduct a
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:26.720]  drill involving a plane on fire a plane on fire dozens of people also took the

[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:24.320]  after being on one world way I wrote 10 days in a row and over 100 degree heat
[02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:28.080]  and then I take another two servings of one world way and then work out at the

[02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:54.720]  the establishment knows that we're watching them right back and we know
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:59.360]  who they are I think the huge political awakening has begun I wanted to get
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:07.320]  Dr. Edwin Vieira Harvard Law School constitutional lawyer also a graduate of
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:14.120]  arts and sciences from Harvard and one of the top advisors to Congress on the
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:19.920]  Constitution and Bill of Rights he's also a best-selling author you just type
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:24.920]  in Edwin Vieira and find all of his latest books they're invaluable and
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:28.560]  he's really helped develop a lot of the modern ideas of nullification and things
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:33.000]  that we're seeing all across the United States it's starting in Virginia it's
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:39.300]  starting in Colorado other areas the recalls of people that are trying to
[02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:43.000]  disarm the people they would enslave this is short segmental with us for part
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:46.600]  of the next and he'll be gone and we'll go back to your calls but I wanted to
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:50.800]  get him on about Walter Jones's resolution of Obama hit Syria without
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:55.160]  authorization impeaching him but all the other things that are going on and
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:26:00.280]  also the fact that they've already been arming al Qaeda but Obama has now
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:02.800]  admitted this in speeches which you already knew but it's good to have that
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:06.840]  why not impeach him for arming groups that actually call themselves the
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:13.560]  Assemblyman Laden Brigade I mean we have him well we have them and I wanted to
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:17.600]  get your take on the awakening that's happening how big it is is this a major
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:21.760]  realignment is the American Empire about to fall like the Soviet Union I want to
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:24.520]  get his take on that and and where he thinks we are doctor thank you for
[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:29.440]  coming on with us so I just threw out a whole cornucopia of issues where do you
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:34.920]  think we are right now well we're in the septic tank and going down for the
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:40.240]  second time not quite the third but rather serious trouble I still wait to
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:44.560]  have someone instruct me as to how you impeach an individual who may not be
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:48.520]  eligible for the office from which you want to impeach him that seems to be a
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:55.160]  more interesting problem but assuming the purposes of argument that they could
[02:26:55.160 --> 02:26:59.680]  in the House of Representatives judiciary committee and the House of Representatives
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:04.560]  vote for a bill of impeachment at least it would tend to raise some of these
[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:11.560]  immediate issues of the problems of the over essentially the overweening of
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:16.320]  imperial presidency the great difficulty in the long run of course is how could
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:20.320]  they possibly succeed in the Senate it would be something of a fiasco in the
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:24.960]  Senate but it might tend to galvanize people in the country around these other
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:30.240]  problems popularize these issues and then we could work on it from another
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:35.680]  direction well I think you know having the whole House debate and a vote might
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:39.560]  shame the Senate I mean what about them saying NATO is over our military last
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:44.840]  year and sending letters out isn't that impeachable right there well my
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:50.240]  goodness almost everything he's done in foreign policy area in the last let's
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:55.000]  say six months to a year has been impeachable but I would think though that
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:00.280]  when he came out with this concept of official assassinations and then Eric
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:05.680]  holds of the Attorney General way back but went here more than a year ago
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:09.920]  attempted defended it at Northwest University School of Law and then more
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:14.480]  recently there was a white paper put out by the Justice Department that that
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:19.120]  would have triggered something extraordinarily serious because that of
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:22.760]  course that concept of course is traceable directly back to what an
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:28.680]  individual named Adolf Hitler that 1934 that was one of the great break points
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:34.320]  in the German legal and political system or almost every historian will look back
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:40.400]  at the fear of precept correct excuse me that's the fear of precept well it was
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:44.640]  his concept that he was as he said the oversteer correct here of the German
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:48.080]  people the supreme lawgiver of the German people this was after the rim
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:54.160]  purge in 1934 he comes before the Reichstag explaining what he had done in
[02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:57.360]  the murder of these people and he said well at that moment I became the
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:00.640]  supreme lawgiver of the German people and I can simply shoot down anyone who
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:04.640]  dares to raise his hand against the state so it was the expression of the
[02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:08.280]  official assassinations policy and now we have the same thing of course being
[02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:11.840]  expressed not quite that's colorful language but essentially the same
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:15.080]  principle put forward by the environment administration I would have thought that
[02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:19.320]  somebody at that stage was that well my gosh when you start invoking the basic
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:24.080]  principles of the Hitler regime maybe we have an impeachable situation here but
[02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:27.320]  apparently nobody seemed to care about that now wait a minute that's a little
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:30.840]  racist of course that makes our cast ticket that's that's the answer to
[02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:34.000]  anything hey Obamacare has written my insurance companies ripped me off racist

[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:40.120]  or no gods before the state but we use the common vernacular of above the
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:45.680]  state so there it is it's very blasphemous very heretical very evil I
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:51.520]  mean this is I mean if Obama's Christ we're almost like Anton Leve here but
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:53.960]  he's actually like the devil so we're trying to be Christ like here but the

[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:19.760]  in the 10 minutes we have left with you Dr. Vieira I want to just get into all
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:24.760]  the outrageous the persecuting the press the using the NSA being caught
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:30.720]  Benghazi gate all the lies I mean the Congress knows they have hundreds of
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:34.720]  reasons I mean literally hundreds to impeach Obama and if they don't it's
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:37.480]  that's the precedent as you know for them to get away with bloody murder so
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:42.720]  what would you do right now what would you tell the people to do to really
[02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:50.800]  aggressively try to dethrone this entire imperial system well the long-run
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:55.400]  solution to this is what I've been suggesting for many years doesn't need
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:37:00.200]  to be getting very far read the first 13 words of the Second Amendment if that's
[02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:03.440]  too much for you then I think you should move to North Korea because you'll be
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:08.040]  living in a society it's more congenial with your opinion right this is our
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:11.960]  difficulty the people do not have the institutions that are necessary to
[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:17.000]  apply direct control to the governmental apparatus but if you want to
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:20.880]  bring it at the governmental apparatus level assuming now of course that we're
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:23.400]  going to get some action out of the House of Representatives to begin with
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:27.440]  first thing that I would do is open up an investigation into who this fellow is
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:30.680]  we don't even know who he is we don't even know what his background is we
[02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:35.400]  don't know what his his credentials are all of this is hidden that's the first
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:38.520]  level because that solves the impeachment problem you don't impeach a
[02:37:38.520 --> 02:37:42.120]  person who's ineligible for the president then the second level if you want to
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:47.160]  take the impeachment route because we have a huge list of impeachable offenses
[02:37:47.160 --> 02:37:50.760]  because the most recent one is the threat to engage in aggression against
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:57.840]  Syria but going way back in this administration and start bringing those
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:02.800]  to the attention of the American people in some great detail on the assumption
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:07.720]  again as you suggested earlier Alex that perhaps the Senate would be shamed into
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:12.760]  holding a proper trial once the house is put through a bill of impeachment it's
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:16.960]  a proper trial and some of these issues but eventually you come back to the main
[02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:22.160]  problem that in a self-governing society the people themselves have to take
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:28.160]  direct action self-government is not a spectator sport I like to say you can't
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:31.800]  sit on the bench and simply watch somebody else on the team playing and
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:35.680]  when they fail and fail and fail refuse to do anything and that's our grave
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:38.920]  difficulty with spinning the same wheels over and over again electing the
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:42.880]  same type of people to Congress and expecting that the results will change
[02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:46.400]  and I think it was Einstein that's given credit for saying well that kind of
[02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:50.800]  behavior is a manifestation of insanity or the definition of insanity so I keep
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:54.280]  trying to bring people back to the recognition that the Constitution sets
[02:38:54.280 --> 02:39:01.640]  out a certain structure which ultimately leaves political power in the hands of
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:05.960]  the people themselves now that if they are not willing to take advantage of
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:10.040]  that then the result will be that the entire constitutional structural
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:13.680]  failure you can't have a building designed by architects at five support
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:18.680]  columns and pull one of those columns out and expect that that building will
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:22.200]  remain stable for a very long period of time the architects did not put those
[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:26.520]  columns in there simply because they had nothing better to do they had a blank
[02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:31.520]  space on the blueprint and so they dropped this one in you go back to the
[02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:35.200]  second amendment concept of the well-regulated militia which is the
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:39.360]  people organized a certain way it's not only in the second amendment it's in
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:42.760]  the original Constitution the body of the Constitution article 1 section 8
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:49.600]  causes 15 and 16 article 2 section 1 clause 1 that structure was not created
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:55.640]  simply because the founding fathers had nothing better to do with those lines or
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:40:01.720]  there was space in the Constitution but it requires the people to participate
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:06.960]  directly if they refuse to do that if they refuse to be a self-governing people
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:10.960]  then for sure someone else is going to come along to govern them and that's
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:15.200]  what we're seeing they're seeing government as it were of extra from the
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:19.880]  outside not by the people themselves and we're getting results that are
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:23.920]  totally adverse to what the people want like antagonistic and of course doctor
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:27.320]  I mean I mean as a lawyer you're you're staying the very basis of law maybe you
[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:32.160]  can restate it for for average folks out there like myself that in law if you
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:36.320]  don't demand the rights stand up for them vigorously it's not even considered
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:41.040]  it's there and so we just expect the system won't be overrun with criminals
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:46.680]  if we just lay on our backs we will become slaves if we just lay down to
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:51.120]  every user patient so it really does fall to the people and look at how 91%
[02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:54.480]  public opinion in Reuters polls and things out there showing similar
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:59.080]  numbers against this war has actually stopped it because public opinion does
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:04.920]  matter the will if we just lightly resist in a mass nothing can prevail
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:10.280]  against us instead it's been small groups of us engaging in Herculean efforts
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:16.360]  try to move the world but we have begun to succeed in ideas starting small like
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:23.240]  yours but big ideas moving now until we be we become the culture and and I've
[02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:26.200]  got to tell you sir I think we're really making major inroads I'm gonna get
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:31.560]  your take on that a b how do you expect the Empire to strike back well I think
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:37.360]  we're making major inroads in the sense of public awareness years ago people
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:40.880]  weren't aware of the problem of the Federal Reserve Bank the effect of
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:45.160]  central banking arc on our economy they're becoming desperately aware of
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:49.480]  that now as they see the consequences of certainly years ago people were not
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:52.880]  worried about the development of a police state in this country now they're
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:55.640]  recognizing it all the way from the Department of Homeland Security don't
[02:41:55.640 --> 02:41:59.600]  down to their local police forces and Sheriff's Department so that level of
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:03.560]  of education I would call that negative education that they're realizing what's
[02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:08.120]  wrong now we need positive education in terms of how do we deal with this kind
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:12.920]  of a problem and it can't be putting out each little brush fire as arises there
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:17.600]  has to be a return to institutional control by the people so that we're not
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:23.720]  constantly confronted with these blunders or essentially criminal attacks
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:28.280]  that are made on us by rogue public officials we've got to get control back
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:32.040]  in the hands of the people on essentially a 24-hour basis what do you do
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:35.640]  though when they convert to where the majority of the people at the top of
[02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:40.320]  government our rogue that becomes a tyranny what do you do when the rogue
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:45.000]  becomes the establishment and then the patriot or the person that cares about
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  virtuous common sense becomes the enemies yet people need to understand
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:53.600]  historically evil knows that it's going to take over and have resistance so it
[02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:57.320]  always tries to persecute us and now Homeland Security I think they should
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:00.840]  be impeached all of them that are involved in this because they've said
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:05.040]  veterans of the number one enemy gun owners George Washington's bad I mean
[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:10.280]  this is just this isn't free speech this is governmental sedition against the
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:14.200]  Republic well that's what I think people have to recognize we're reaching a
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:18.360]  breaking point in the historical continuum here it's not business as
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:22.640]  usual anymore we've had many kinds of rogue officials in the past and they've
[02:43:22.640 --> 02:43:26.120]  done this or they've done that but they've never come out openly and said
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:30.240]  that their enemy is essentially the American people as a whole and that they
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:34.640]  intend to suppress opress and repress the American people to whatever extent is
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:39.240]  necessary to keep them in line so we have to recognize we reached a point now
[02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:44.720]  where that element in the governmental apparatus has really declared itself in
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:48.920]  a sense that war with the American people well the Constitution provides for
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:53.120]  that problem or it did provide for that problem originally but it requires
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:58.320]  popular participation in the solution so I would suggest simply people go to
[02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:02.800]  amazon.com take a look at my latest books called 13 words short book 120
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:07.560]  something pages long and it directs them to those 13 words and the
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:13.160]  significance of those 13 words and in a few weeks there'll be a second book
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:19.200]  called three rights which ties all of that together with the Declaration of
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:23.320]  Independence and the Constitution and I'll tell you Alex I'm getting to the point
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:29.760]  where I begin to throw my hand if 13 words in the Constitution are too much
[02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:36.840]  for the people to read and understand and act on essentially this country is
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:41.960]  finished but I don't believe that's true or I wouldn't be in this exercise of
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:45.680]  you know preparing these materials and trying to publicize them I don't believe
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:49.640]  it's true and I believe actually that there's kind of a little light before
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:54.520]  the dawn showing up here in the extent to which especially the Syrian event in
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:59.880]  the extent to which people self-mobilize you say 91% of the population
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:06.720]  essentially self-mobilized to send Congress that message which was Nancy
[02:45:06.720 --> 02:45:13.840]  Reagan's message just say no and they have to learn to just say no more often
[02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:17.880]  and then begin to say yes to those institutions that the Constitution
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:22.960]  tells them unnecessary to maintain a free state in this country it's really not
[02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:26.480]  that complicated and of course the real threat to it to understand it sure
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:30.520]  exactly but the real threat is the very group telling us they're doing all this
[02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:35.480]  for own safety the great threat is the tyranny it is the dangerous servant
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:40.520]  fearful master running wild why do you think is it hubris of the establishment
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:46.480]  now is so naked and foaming at the mouth and and and and just just dripping
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:53.280]  with with classical villainous activity well it's part that and of course it's
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:58.240]  that the old statement whom the gods would destroy they first make mad but
[02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:01.400]  there's another thing that's involved in this you know that in the past the
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:04.960]  establishment has always been able to buy off various segments of the American
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:11.080]  population especially by maintaining some semblance of a working economy so
[02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:15.480]  that people could believe that they had incomes and jobs and that was stability
[02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:20.120]  and there was certain permanence well that has all failed with the breakdown of
[02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:24.920]  the central banking and corrupt Wall Street speculative system and now they've
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:28.640]  gone to the austerity mode or essentially the looting mode well in the
[02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:34.000]  looting mode as an economic system where people are driven lower and lower in
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:38.360]  their standards of living you no longer can buy them off here it's impossible to
[02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:42.480]  buy them off so now you essentially have to scare them off because if the
[02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:45.160]  American people are not going to stand being driven down to third world
[02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:49.680]  standards and they're going in some way to respond to this to resist to begin to
[02:46:49.680 --> 02:46:54.120]  withhold a consent of the government from this apparatus so you just declare
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:57.640]  them the enemy yeah they declare them the enemy I mean so they've reached this
[02:46:57.640 --> 02:47:03.080]  stage of what I would call the mad dog stage of political control where they
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:06.560]  recognize it's no longer possible essentially to negotiate with the people
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:10.200]  to throw them a bone because there are no more bones to throw them that's
[02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:13.480]  exactly what Brzezinski said to the CFR as you know three years ago and just
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:17.000]  wrote a book on he said it's easier to kill a million of us now than to
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:21.360]  convince us her bias because their authoritarian system kills the
[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:26.080]  prosperity that's right it's done it it's done I mean this was all theoretical
[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:30.320]  in the past but we're here now we're here in this economic crisis we're
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:34.520]  talking about a overhang of derivatives these these phony economic
[02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:39.200]  wages of trillions and trillions of dollars impossible to pay governmental
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:43.280]  debt in the long term impossible to pay living standards have to be driven down
[02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:47.360]  because they've offshored all of the good manufacturing and in other productive
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:52.160]  jobs to China and other countries so we're staring down the barrel of this
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:57.640]  economic shotgun and the only way that the political apparatus could possibly
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:02.080]  see to maintain their position is repression and this has been the
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:06.200]  history of the world you know if you can't give your people that the government
[02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:12.480]  can't provide welfare in the true sense income job social security in the in
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:16.680]  the meaningful sense then the only way to keep people under control is to
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:21.680]  repress them and and then these these kleptocratic hedge funds are so ruthless
[02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:27.040]  they even steal the police pensions they're almost gone every city and and
[02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:32.280]  imagine when the enforcers learn they've been robbed it's madness it's sheer
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:36.360]  madness well that's why I say we're coming we're coming to a point now where
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:39.840]  things are breaking down to the extent that you give you give a lot of credit
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:45.720]  to the powers to be for planning right there they're such good planners I don't
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:49.840]  think that they plan for things to get as far out of hand as they are getting
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:56.280]  and this is their Achilles heel their system depends upon their being able to
[02:48:56.280 --> 02:49:00.920]  essentially bait and switch the population promised them a promise or
[02:49:00.920 --> 02:49:04.200]  anything to give her our badge right well they're now incapable of giving her
[02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:09.520]  our page they cannot maintain even a semblance that these promises can be
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:14.640]  kept and at that stage the average person is going to say well what loyalty
[02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:19.560]  what allegiance do I have to a system oh not only is not providing me with any
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:26.360]  kind of social benefits but is aggressively taking them away to make us
[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:31.240]  poor see the madness of these guys is with agenda 21 they say they're going
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:35.560]  to make us poor and collectivize this for a greater good but that's just an
[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:39.040]  excuse for the byproduct of what their system creates so they're actually
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:43.080]  trying to convince themselves that everybody's going to be poor and that

[02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:56.960]  hi there how you doing today I'm doing pretty good welcome yes you know every
[02:54:56.960 --> 02:55:04.120]  topic that you have spoke about I have been giving very thorough investigations
[02:55:04.120 --> 02:55:09.640]  I've been looking at everything studying everything 1415 hours a day you know
[02:55:09.640 --> 02:55:16.040]  and and trying to put the whole picture together president Kennedy said if not
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:21.520]  what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country and the
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:28.280]  one main and most important thing that he put emphasis on was that truthful
[02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:33.000]  media keep the people informed for and their respect you are surely doing your
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:43.000]  job I you know I it is my belief that the new world order had everything to do
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:49.120]  with towers coming down that was a first there was what 300 billion dollars
[02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:56.880]  under there they found 300 million of it there was tens of billions in gold and
[02:55:56.880 --> 02:56:02.640]  most of it disappeared you know yeah and well I'm just going by what I read no
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:05.800]  no no you're right I mean there's just also look criminals will use any
[02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:09.160]  operation to do a bunch of other stuff at the same time got a lot of different
[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:13.120]  interests they left their buddies in there was a bunch of insider trading done
[02:56:13.120 --> 02:56:21.840]  by the CIA director Buzzy Cron guard of the sub director on the airline stocks
[02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:25.640]  right before that I mean it's just red-handed bare minimum they knew
[02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:29.080]  exactly what was coming and open the doors and order to stand down that's the
[02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:34.280]  bare minimum and the evidence is pretty conclusive that they were decoys thought
[02:56:34.280 --> 02:56:36.640]  they were part of a drill they nerve-gassed them and then flew the
[02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:42.280]  aircraft in the buildings remote control yeah when they told Bush about it he
[02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:47.680]  didn't even they said he didn't even respond he didn't even even move into
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:51.520]  action well yeah that was the that was the pet goat story I mean that's on video
[02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:54.640]  that happened and I'm not defending George Bush I'm a big critic of him
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:58.800]  obviously somebody like that though I mean that's that's puppet level I mean
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:04.240]  it you know he vetoed Cheney Sy Hirsch reported Pulitzer Prize winner in
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:09.640]  New Yorker magazine from he vetoed Cheney wanted to have US Navy SEALs make
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:14.640]  fake they were already manufacturing them PT boats and have them attack US
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:19.680]  destroyers as the provocation and and and that got nixed reportedly by the
[02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:23.320]  president that's what Sy Hirsch said he's been proven to be very accurate just
[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:26.960]  give me and I'm not again I'm gonna show you how crazy this stuff works going we
[02:57:26.960 --> 02:57:32.200]  romanticize the Kennedys but Bobby Kennedy wanted to and this has been
[02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:36.680]  classified stage a terror attack on the US Embassy in Honduras as a pretext to
[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:41.640]  invade there so there's just a lot of this stuff going on and we don't know
[02:57:41.640 --> 02:57:47.400]  exactly who did it in there and exactly the extent we just know on you know 12
[02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:51.040]  years later the official story and God bless you Cynthia thanks for calling in

[03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:45.200]  the one thing he said he said oh yeah but everything is good except anybody is
[03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:50.600]  it that thinks that vaccines are bad it doesn't want to take them as a retard
[03:00:50.600 --> 03:00:55.600]  I tried to convince them you know talk about the bear studies and whatnot or
[03:00:55.600 --> 03:00:59.640]  the bear pharmaceutical lawsuits and I thought you could elaborate that a little
[03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:03.520]  bit better than I well look I mean if he wants to believe their propaganda that's
[03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:09.640]  his issue and I would move on you know we have to triage these things and you
[03:01:09.640 --> 03:01:13.240]  know you've warned him a lot of times when people almost grovel and go no look
[03:01:13.240 --> 03:01:17.400]  it's true I promise the person just feels powerful and laughs at you because
[03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:21.120]  they're delusional themselves just say okay but look here's a natural news
[03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:26.080]  story that's up on prisonplanet.com by Mike Adams that has ten outrageous but
[03:01:26.080 --> 03:01:29.920]  true facts about vaccines the CDC and the vaccine industry don't want you to
[03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:36.640]  know send him the link to the CDC website with hundreds of pages of
[03:01:36.640 --> 03:01:41.480]  adverse reactions including death associated with every vaccine then show
[03:01:41.480 --> 03:01:46.480]  him news articles saying there is no side effects conspiracy theorists say it
[03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:51.600]  see they call you a racist or a conspiracy theorist the TSA now if you
[03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:55.000]  say I don't want to be groped I don't want my kids going the scanner they
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:02:01.640]  actually say to people oh you're a conspiracy theorist that'd be like if
[03:02:01.640 --> 03:02:04.320]  you went to a restaurant and said I want cheese at your lot is not beef and
[03:02:04.320 --> 03:02:08.760]  went oh you're you're a conspiracy theorist or I like black hats not green
[03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:19.280]  hats it's like even having an opinion is some type of mass crime now so I would
[03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:22.720]  go to prisonplanet.com look at this article posted on infowars.com it's
[03:02:22.720 --> 03:02:28.040]  so good ten outrageous but true facts about vaccines the CDC and the vaccine
[03:02:28.040 --> 03:02:33.600]  industry don't want you to know and it goes through admitting the cancer
[03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:37.760]  viruses admitting the brain damage admitting all the things they've done so
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:42.440]  I would send him this this article it's on prisonplanet.com or you get it
[03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:46.640]  naturalnews.com and I would send him that and then I would say that I'm done

[03:02:55.680 --> 03:03:02.160]  friend was going to Japan over the summer something is rape by Fukushima and
[03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:07.320]  she said something to her and she's like hey are you kind of worried about like
[03:03:07.320 --> 03:03:10.560]  maybe the radiation that's going on over there her it's getting kind of bad
[03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:14.800]  and she's like oh yeah there's conspiracy theories about that they say
[03:03:14.800 --> 03:03:21.440]  it's bad over there yeah I mean look look we we kind of put the people that are
[03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:26.200]  the dumbest in authority because they just act like they know everything when
[03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:29.880]  they know nothing I mean just feel sorry for people when you say Obamacare
[03:03:29.880 --> 03:03:34.640]  really rips us off they go hmm racist I mean Ed Asner is a good guy smart guy

[03:08:37.960 --> 03:08:44.320]  2012 is it's been 12 years and it's just so amazing this 2013 I always almost
[03:08:44.320 --> 03:08:49.480]  signed checks and stuff like 2007 2010 it's like you just it's hard to believe
[03:08:49.480 --> 03:08:54.040]  life is going by so quick hard to believe my son's almost 11 and it's so
[03:08:54.040 --> 03:08:58.200]  incredibly smart and handsome everybody says that about their kids but man my
[03:08:58.200 --> 03:09:02.280]  son is just incredible my daughters are just amazingly sweet and smart and good
[03:09:02.280 --> 03:09:08.040]  and when I look at them it makes me angry at the new world order I mean I've
[03:09:08.040 --> 03:09:13.920]  always cared about innocent people I've always wanted to be a good guy I like
[03:09:13.920 --> 03:09:18.360]  puppy dogs I like happy stuff but I also have a very vicious side towards bad
[03:09:18.360 --> 03:09:22.800]  people like we all do it's a double-edged sword but when I spend time with my
[03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:29.520]  children how good and sweet they are it makes me very mad at my Miley Cyrus
[03:09:29.520 --> 03:09:33.920]  trying to corrupt their minds because it'll make her money and then I'm not
[03:09:33.920 --> 03:09:36.840]  perfect too I say stuff on here and forget kids are listening and you know
[03:09:36.840 --> 03:09:43.000]  before like oh what's the big deal now I understand how it's upsetting that once
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:46.160]  you have children and you have these instincts kick in to protect them and
[03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:49.760]  build them up and you want a good world for them and then you see the global is
[03:09:49.760 --> 03:09:54.200]  trying to start World War three and you see the system you know eroding and
[03:09:54.200 --> 03:09:58.040]  getting worse and worse and thug is them growing and being institutionalized and
[03:09:58.040 --> 03:10:01.400]  it makes you want to fight back against it and then it makes you get really
[03:10:01.400 --> 03:10:07.640]  angry at people that make jokes and go hey kook you know vaccines aren't bad
[03:10:07.640 --> 03:10:11.560]  for anybody went on purpose this is a government caught putting stuff in
[03:10:11.560 --> 03:10:16.360]  vaccines for so we sterilizing people caught doing all sorts of evil stuff and
[03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:20.200]  then people will go oh there's nothing wrong with the vaccines I saw a story
[03:10:20.200 --> 03:10:26.760]  debunking you know this doctor or that doctor and then if you knew the whole
[03:10:26.760 --> 03:10:30.960]  story they go create hoaxes debunking those doctors that bravely exposed
[03:10:30.960 --> 03:10:37.720]  vaccines it turns out they were incredibly accurate and that it was all
[03:10:37.720 --> 03:10:43.560]  paid propaganda and that now other studies have come out proving what
[03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:49.280]  those those studies showed it's just so frustrating I mean it's a fact that the
[03:10:49.280 --> 03:10:52.560]  anthrac shots killed so many US troops they had to stop giving them it's a
[03:10:52.560 --> 03:10:57.960]  fact my uncle almost died when he took a tetanus shot at age 10 it's a fact that
[03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:03.600]  people take shots and have convulsions right there in the office it's a fact
[03:11:03.600 --> 03:11:06.320]  they give baby shots and they go home and die then they arrest the parent
[03:11:06.320 --> 03:11:10.360]  signals blood on their brain from the autoimmune response that's been found
[03:11:10.360 --> 03:11:15.320]  by the Australian government so they stopped arresting people therefore they
[03:11:15.320 --> 03:11:19.920]  don't hear they they thought enough to kill your kid they're gonna come get you
[03:11:19.920 --> 03:11:24.680]  and of course the cop doesn't know I mean but that's what I'm saying it's so
[03:11:24.680 --> 03:11:32.120]  sick it's it's like always ten times worse than I could even imagine and then
[03:11:32.120 --> 03:11:38.160]  I see pregnant women and I just cannot help it anymore and my wife and my
[03:11:38.160 --> 03:11:43.280]  children God bless them literally used to them go oh dad again oh you're gonna
[03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:49.080]  make a scene I just don't care anymore and let me tell you by saying I don't
[03:11:49.080 --> 03:11:52.280]  care anymore I don't care anymore what people think about me I care about that
[03:11:52.280 --> 03:11:57.400]  baby and I know there's a globalist program with shots especially early on
[03:11:57.400 --> 03:12:00.800]  that's going to form that child's heart valves that's going to give it all
[03:12:00.800 --> 03:12:05.000]  sorts of cognitive problems all the studies are there I've read the studies
[03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:12.320]  I've read the inserts I know what I'm talking about and it makes me absolutely
[03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:23.280]  boil boil with controlled rage to where I don't get mad it's somebody that laughs
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:25.840]  at me on the street about black helicopters they happen a couple times
[03:12:25.840 --> 03:12:30.640]  last night at the concert oh it's Mr. Black Helicopter I'm gonna feel bad I
[03:12:30.640 --> 03:12:37.360]  feel bad for them how dumb they are I feel bad for them because I'm aware of
[03:12:37.360 --> 03:12:40.280]  the war going on the globalist all wrote books how they're doing it I mean
[03:12:40.280 --> 03:12:45.920]  they've confessed they've confessed to their program they've confessed to putting
[03:12:45.920 --> 03:12:50.240]  stuff in the vaccines they've confessed to engineering the food with hidden
[03:12:50.240 --> 03:12:56.840]  viruses in the GMO RNA they've confessed in the pharmacological crops they've
[03:12:56.840 --> 03:13:03.160]  confessed and I'm sitting here watching them do it to all of us and I hate
[03:13:03.160 --> 03:13:07.760]  myself because at an animal level I'm like you're only talking about this and
[03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:12.240]  you're living an okay life and eating good food and being happy and still going
[03:13:12.240 --> 03:13:16.960]  to movies and only working 15 hours a day or whatever you are a piece of trash
[03:13:16.960 --> 03:13:21.600]  Jones you have ideas and things properly deployed that could really fight the
[03:13:21.600 --> 03:13:24.920]  new world order you should already have your websites redesigned and upgraded
[03:13:24.920 --> 03:13:28.520]  you should already have your TV studio done you should already have all this
[03:13:28.520 --> 03:13:32.480]  stuff done you've got the plans you got the ideas you know how to beat these
[03:13:32.480 --> 03:13:36.800]  people and you're not living up and you're not a good manager and you don't
[03:13:36.800 --> 03:13:41.000]  get the right people in the right organization you got a problem you need
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:44.480]  to get yourself in gear because this is total war against you and your family
[03:13:44.480 --> 03:13:48.840]  and your kids have no future and you're helping kill them by your laziness
[03:13:48.840 --> 03:13:53.680]  that's why I don't like you calling me up telling me how great I am this is not
[03:13:53.680 --> 03:13:57.600]  about narcissism ladies and gentlemen this is the opposite of that this is
[03:13:57.600 --> 03:14:02.000]  about survival this is about humanity I'm not worried about in my individual I
[03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:07.480]  am only an expression of the species like part of a composite eye of a dragonfly
[03:14:07.480 --> 03:14:11.520]  you understand that I'm worried about the group ladies and gentlemen but
[03:14:11.520 --> 03:14:15.680]  that's not collectivism that's a fraud the individual worrying about the group
[03:14:15.680 --> 03:14:22.000]  together maximizes a true collective with the higher dimensions of humanity
[03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:28.480]  being held up and that's when we explode in Renaissance instead they hold up the
[03:14:28.480 --> 03:14:33.720]  most dumb down the ugliest and tell us we have to adopt that so that we don't
[03:14:33.720 --> 03:14:39.720]  compete with them I mean it is it is fraud within fraud lie within lie and I
[03:14:39.720 --> 03:14:46.120]  literally struggle with the struggle of all my ancestors and all the things they
[03:14:46.120 --> 03:14:50.640]  went through in the genetics and the instincts really the the race memory of
[03:14:50.640 --> 03:14:59.880]  the human race passed on and I am an organic cage to response to seeing
[03:14:59.880 --> 03:15:03.320]  what's going on I mean I see it it's there it's enemies admitting they're
[03:15:03.320 --> 03:15:07.500]  doing it to me I'm just like we got to do something we got to organize we got
[03:15:07.500 --> 03:15:11.960]  to get involved we got to stand up and I see the ruined humanity out there just
[03:15:11.960 --> 03:15:16.920]  ruined whereas the globalist revel in this stagnant swamp that is the general
[03:15:16.920 --> 03:15:22.200]  population in many cases while they revel in the in the in the mosquito
[03:15:22.200 --> 03:15:29.440]  infested sewage pits that they've created in many cases I sit there and I
[03:15:29.440 --> 03:15:34.040]  look at the wrecked people I looked at how wrecked I am as well I'm not on some
[03:15:34.040 --> 03:15:39.160]  high horse here and I just think about the absolute instinctive evil to wreck
[03:15:39.160 --> 03:15:44.920]  things because it's so low it wants to pull everything down with it okay this
[03:15:44.920 --> 03:15:50.480]  is an absolute war they're murdering everyone none of you that think you're
[03:15:50.480 --> 03:15:55.800]  part of the power structure are winning your chumps your idiots and you know
[03:15:55.800 --> 03:15:59.320]  that caller calls it up people laughing at him about being conspiracy theorists
[03:15:59.320 --> 03:16:04.120]  saying vaccines are hurting people I mean they have to for 30 years they've
[03:16:04.120 --> 03:16:08.440]  had a vaccine damage you know what is it eight million dollar fund now quietly
[03:16:08.440 --> 03:16:13.440]  paying out all the people that die in the hospital see their big threat is they
[03:16:13.440 --> 03:16:16.920]  want to kill you and have you go home and your kid have a convulsion and just
[03:16:16.920 --> 03:16:19.960]  lower their IQ but when they you know they have a too big a response and they
[03:16:19.960 --> 03:16:25.160]  die God it's like abortion you know it's illegal to kill a baby that comes all
[03:16:25.160 --> 03:16:27.400]  the way out so they call that the worst thing they want to be able to kill the
[03:16:27.400 --> 03:16:35.440]  baby you know just 90% out of the womb so they can get the job done and it just
[03:16:35.440 --> 03:16:38.760]  absolutely enrages them when they've got to chop the child up quietly you know
[03:16:38.760 --> 03:16:41.760]  tell the nurses to leave the room because they're committing a felony right
[03:16:41.760 --> 03:16:45.760]  there it's the same thing they want to make sure you go home so that baby has
[03:16:45.760 --> 03:16:48.800]  that blood right out of their nose at home because we're gonna make some money
[03:16:48.800 --> 03:16:53.880]  with the police yeah let's kill that baby let's take it from the parents
[03:16:53.880 --> 03:16:59.760]  it's fun it's fun I sit here watching a murder everybody and I sit there and

[03:17:23.680 --> 03:17:28.240]  argue with them and it's exhausting caring it's exhausting but at same time

[03:18:50.960 --> 03:18:54.800]  them but first like Howard Beale says in network you've got to get mad you've
[03:18:54.800 --> 03:18:58.800]  got to get angry you got to find your humanity and you got to start kicking
[03:18:58.800 --> 03:19:03.160]  some new world order ass in the info war before this thing gets physical but I'm
[03:19:03.160 --> 03:19:07.360]  not gonna sit here you notice it came out a month ago oh Virginia oh California
[03:19:07.360 --> 03:19:13.120]  we're still sterilizing foster kids a first it was prisoners while they
[03:19:13.120 --> 03:19:17.720]  deserve it so they're trying to sell it though it was foster kids too yeah well
[03:19:17.720 --> 03:19:21.880]  after you rape them they're already committing crimes everywhere and you
[03:19:21.880 --> 03:19:25.080]  notice you know why they come out and tell you oh we gave kids in Guatemala
[03:19:25.080 --> 03:19:30.800]  syphilis to in vaccines we apologize remember that this year Hillary they
[03:19:30.800 --> 03:19:34.840]  apologize they're telling you to just get you used to it to psychologically
[03:19:34.840 --> 03:19:39.600]  inoculate you so that as all this comes out it's like so we gave a hundred
[03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:43.680]  million Americans as estimated all these new rare cancers in a cocktail of
[03:19:43.680 --> 03:19:48.240]  viruses in your polio vaccine the live vaccine we shoot up kids noses what's
[03:19:48.240 --> 03:19:53.720]  the big deal pumpkin didn't die in young fun I mean these these people these
[03:19:53.720 --> 03:19:57.880]  people are assaulting us under common law ladies and gentlemen they could all
[03:19:57.880 --> 03:20:02.440]  be rounded up and hung okay but they've got Homeland Security geared up to try
[03:20:02.440 --> 03:20:06.680]  to keep the claps down while they murder a slow they love the fact they're
[03:20:06.680 --> 03:20:10.120]  killing you and your family they enjoy it people turn into the show they go
[03:20:10.120 --> 03:20:16.880]  this guy's far out I'm not far out they're far out that one caller set me
[03:20:16.880 --> 03:20:19.000]  off
[03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:27.960]  I mean is this an abnormal response to the fact that they have written book
[03:20:27.960 --> 03:20:32.020]  after book like eco science for the White House science are how they put
[03:20:32.020 --> 03:20:36.920]  floor on the water to brain damages and they brag about it and they think it's
[03:20:36.920 --> 03:20:42.520]  funny and they do all they think it's funny I don't think it's funny and then
[03:20:42.520 --> 03:20:48.000]  I'm bad because I'm a primitive folks I take people attacking us and poisoning
[03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:53.000]  our water supply like we're animals yes we are and I guess the psychopath is the
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:59.400]  superior human because it runs everything of course I'm being sarcastic
[03:20:59.400 --> 03:21:05.120]  they wreck everything once they get in control these people are your enemy they
[03:21:05.120 --> 03:21:08.960]  are never going to stop they're never going to deviate from their program
[03:21:08.960 --> 03:21:14.040]  until we stop them and you either wake up to that that our government's pure
[03:21:14.040 --> 03:21:21.960]  evil funding al-qaeda to murder Christians worldwide running them or you
[03:21:21.960 --> 03:21:25.400]  kneel to this system because you think it's popular and you just kind of go
[03:21:25.400 --> 03:21:29.800]  along with it and have a drink on the New World Order and just sit back and
[03:21:29.800 --> 03:21:34.200]  drink beer and watch football that's too depressing man I choose to think
[03:21:34.200 --> 03:21:38.720]  everything's good boy let me tell you hell would be locked up with a bunch of
[03:21:38.720 --> 03:21:45.080]  guys like that hell would be locked up with people like that they just put up
[03:21:45.080 --> 03:21:50.800]  with all this stuff you guys aren't men you are you are you are the equivalent
[03:21:50.800 --> 03:21:55.080]  of 12 year olds who watched Madison Avenue programming and were taught you
[03:21:55.080 --> 03:21:58.640]  weren't cool so your whole life you ever the system says trying to be cool
[03:21:58.640 --> 03:22:03.560]  trying to get acceptance trying to be part of the system there is no system
[03:22:03.560 --> 03:22:07.360]  there's an artificial construct that they're trying to insert us into and
[03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:12.760]  before it's completed we have to sabotage it immediately any way we can
[03:22:12.760 --> 03:22:18.920]  and like great white sharks just like stephan Malinus said when humans are
[03:22:18.920 --> 03:22:22.640]  don't see their cage they're they're very easy to control once we see it we're
[03:22:22.640 --> 03:22:28.480]  like great white sharks chewing through the the the the nets we just have to
[03:22:28.480 --> 03:22:33.120]  collectively reach out with our pinky and just shove the new order and we can
[03:22:33.120 --> 03:22:37.800]  rip their arms out like Beowulf pulling Grendel's arm out of its socket just
[03:22:37.800 --> 03:22:41.080]  you just blow it the new world order we all started doing it they would fall
[03:22:41.080 --> 03:22:44.400]  over they would burn into flame why do you think they hate us and try to dumb
[03:22:44.400 --> 03:22:48.680]  us down and poison us because the minute we start moving like a glacier it will
[03:22:48.680 --> 03:22:54.520]  crush them you understand that these people need to be annihilated and you
[03:22:54.520 --> 03:22:57.120]  need to understand something ladies and gentlemen I don't say that because I
[03:22:57.120 --> 03:23:01.500]  would think about how I want to annihilate them I'm like a mother who
[03:23:01.500 --> 03:23:04.600]  can pick a car up off their baby because it's screaming and begging for help
[03:23:04.600 --> 03:23:07.360]  that's been documented over and over again it's that same instinct and that's
[03:23:07.360 --> 03:23:11.280]  what you need to go for what you hear in my disgust with these people is the
[03:23:11.280 --> 03:23:17.040]  primal survival instinct to get them off of us to get them off of us that's
[03:23:17.040 --> 03:23:20.720]  what you're hearing and that's what you need to have you need to have that
[03:23:20.720 --> 03:23:26.440]  spirit get off me get off me you ever had a couple bullies thinking they and
[03:23:26.440 --> 03:23:28.840]  they get you down and really start hurting all the sudden you saw the
[03:23:28.840 --> 03:23:32.760]  sudden you got all that strength and you just get up and start just breaking
[03:23:32.760 --> 03:23:37.480]  arms man that's what I'm talking about politically you've got to set your eye
[03:23:37.480 --> 03:23:41.400]  on the enemy not worry about what propaganda they put out you're the
[03:23:41.400 --> 03:23:45.880]  enemy you're the scum you're the filth you're the murderers you're going down
[03:23:45.880 --> 03:23:50.480]  we're never stopping hell or high water we're going over the top and you're
[03:23:50.480 --> 03:23:54.560]  never gonna stop us you understand that that's what I'm talking about and
[03:23:54.560 --> 03:23:59.600]  that's what they're scared of is that spirit and it is the spirit of 1776 and
[03:23:59.600 --> 03:24:03.920]  you need to ask God for it today and I'm telling you God will deliver it because
[03:24:03.920 --> 03:24:08.000]  you think I'm mad you think you're mad can you imagine the Creator that gives
[03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:12.240]  us everything that's good but has to give us free will so evil is there to test
[03:24:12.240 --> 03:24:16.560]  us you imagine how much God that gives us all the good things our children
[03:24:16.560 --> 03:24:22.520]  everything you imagine what God thinks about this can you imagine
[03:24:22.520 --> 03:24:28.120]  let's go ahead and take some phone calls here Phil you're on the air welcome
[03:24:28.120 --> 03:24:34.680]  hello welcome Phil from Canada yeah hi Alex I have a tip for you here I don't
[03:24:34.680 --> 03:24:39.040]  know if you heard this one before this is a another example of 9-11 predictive
[03:24:39.040 --> 03:24:45.640]  programming yeah I'm sorry say that again about the Obama's now breaking in
[03:24:45.640 --> 03:24:48.480]  over our phones there we're getting messages he's taking over sending
[03:24:48.480 --> 03:24:55.080]  messages directly to cell phones sorry 9-11 news for the 12th anniversary
[03:24:55.080 --> 03:25:02.000]  today so it's another example of predictive programming it was a summer
[03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:07.600]  fast wrestling in 1989 and someone in the audience held up a sign that said
[03:25:07.600 --> 03:25:12.640]  that demolition will topple the Twin Towers and they even had a hand drawing
[03:25:12.640 --> 03:25:18.440]  of the Twin Towers did you know about that in 1989 that could be co-engineer
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:21.560]  but they definitely wasn't coincidence with all the other things I've seen it
[03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:24.960]  it may have been it's like one thing to be coincidence but when you got a hundred
[03:25:24.960 --> 03:25:29.680]  like the Fox lone gunman ex files where the government hijacks jets by remote
[03:25:29.680 --> 03:25:33.360]  control blames it on terrorists and is gonna fly to the World Trade Center so
[03:25:33.360 --> 03:25:37.200]  they can attack Afghanistan and they use a drill to confuse norad and make them
[03:25:37.200 --> 03:25:41.560]  stand out and then I was approached by the star of the show who said the CIA
[03:25:41.560 --> 03:25:48.040]  came to them this is on record Dean Hagman they came to them and and told
[03:25:48.040 --> 03:25:53.920]  them to put that story out that I mean that's a pretty big coincidence also
[03:25:53.920 --> 03:25:58.960]  there's definitely no coincidence I mean I mean these are devil worshipers you
[03:25:58.960 --> 03:26:02.400]  better understand they get more power if they tell you what they're gonna do
[03:26:02.400 --> 03:26:07.440]  first it's like the vampire has to be invited in it's like it's some kind of
[03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:11.000]  metaphysical law they believe they've got to tell you what they're gonna do to
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:18.240]  you yes actually Jesse Ventura was hosting at that time now I know Ventura he's
[03:26:18.240 --> 03:26:21.560]  a smart guy when it comes to the streets he's learning a lot about stuff he
[03:26:21.560 --> 03:26:24.360]  doesn't even really believe in subliminals and stuff I can tell you
[03:26:24.360 --> 03:26:30.200]  you know Ventura is not part of any larger grand deal believe me maybe he
[03:26:30.200 --> 03:26:36.040]  might find that interesting absolutely I bet he would I'm gonna go ahead oh
[03:26:36.040 --> 03:26:40.320]  yeah you can type in in YouTube demolition will topple the twin towers
[03:26:40.320 --> 03:26:43.680]  and you'll see the sign I'm talking about guys type in demolition will topple
[03:26:43.680 --> 03:26:49.800]  the Twin Towers will be some WWE thing thank you so much God bless you sir I
[03:26:49.800 --> 03:26:53.160]  shouldn't get so mad folks I mean I'm just thinking about how it just keeps
[03:26:53.160 --> 03:26:56.720]  going on and on I can't stop them and the public's walking around in a trance
[03:26:56.720 --> 03:27:02.480]  and I think it's a joke and I mean it's not a joke Alicia in Colorado thanks for

[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:11.600]  in 1979 a memory serves where they drilled with hijacked jets flying into the
[03:28:11.600 --> 03:28:14.320]  World Trade Center but then there'd be bombs in the building as well I forgot
[03:28:14.320 --> 03:28:17.520]  about that I just sort of remembered more of these thank you so much great

[03:28:52.760 --> 03:28:59.200]  emphasize how important it is to realize that you know this is in my view I
[03:28:59.200 --> 03:29:03.080]  don't know what your take is on it but in my view this is this is really where

[03:29:16.400 --> 03:29:22.040]  think if you watch this if you knew what was going on now back in 1999 2000 where

[03:33:08.920 --> 03:33:12.760]  there's a war on for your mind
[03:33:13.480 --> 03:33:18.200]  all right Dave you called in you don't screen the calls but if you volunteer
[03:33:18.200 --> 03:33:23.120]  we have like one line of info it says 9-11 Pentagon event my witness I'm gonna
[03:33:23.120 --> 03:33:26.640]  try to shut up for I have a stroke or something and settle down I just start
[03:33:26.640 --> 03:33:32.720]  thinking about how they take people's kids after they brain damage them or
[03:33:32.720 --> 03:33:36.280]  kill them with the vaccines and they know full well what they're doing now you
[03:33:36.280 --> 03:33:41.040]  can say 20 years ago they didn't know when SIDS was starting up but now they
[03:33:41.040 --> 03:33:45.440]  know and then they cover it up because you know the doctors are told give the
[03:33:45.440 --> 03:33:49.240]  shots here's the mandate a lot of people say there's no bad effects oh get a
[03:33:49.240 --> 03:33:53.600]  convulsion oops yeah vaccine did it here go through a ten-year process you
[03:33:53.600 --> 03:33:57.120]  might get a hundred thousand dollars you know for your kid it's gonna be in
[03:33:57.120 --> 03:34:00.160]  diapers the rest of their life
[03:34:00.160 --> 03:34:05.280]  and and and they all know and they all just make jokes about it and they have
[03:34:05.280 --> 03:34:10.320]  like Harvard you know doctors write articles about me in the local paper
[03:34:10.320 --> 03:34:14.320]  and stuff you know and about how people that criticize vaccines are full of
[03:34:14.320 --> 03:34:18.600]  crap and there's no there's no bad effects and if there were it would be
[03:34:18.600 --> 03:34:24.320]  outweighed by the good they do I believe in inoculation technology from the
[03:34:24.320 --> 03:34:28.240]  studies I've read it could work if it was done properly there's some questions
[03:34:28.240 --> 03:34:32.960]  what it does to overall immunity but it's a cost benefit analysis if something
[03:34:32.960 --> 03:34:37.600]  is going to you know absolutely kill you there's some virus that kills say
[03:34:37.600 --> 03:34:47.040]  mouse pox or or or a bacterium like that that kills 98% of people if there's a
[03:34:47.040 --> 03:34:52.200]  vaccine that you know protects me and who knows mitens say 5% of the cases
[03:34:52.200 --> 03:34:57.080]  even give me some problem I'll probably roll the dice and go do it but oh let's
[03:34:57.080 --> 03:35:00.640]  have a hepatitis shot to your newborn baby well okay where are they have an
[03:35:00.640 --> 03:35:05.720]  unprotected sex are they an intravenous drug user by the way is that a safe
[03:35:05.720 --> 03:35:09.120]  vaccine it's one of the worst
[03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:17.320]  and then you find out that it's not accidental that they're still using
[03:35:17.320 --> 03:35:25.280]  flesh cultured viruses that are filled in some cases with thousands of variants
[03:35:25.280 --> 03:35:31.440]  of human simian and other viruses that's why there's all these new cancers
[03:35:31.440 --> 03:35:37.360]  never before seen everywhere that's not debatable and for me this is the big
[03:35:37.360 --> 03:35:43.040]  issue here that all these idiots on the news and all these glitter bug
[03:35:43.040 --> 03:35:46.920]  preachers and all these narcissists that'll do whatever it takes to advance
[03:35:46.920 --> 03:35:53.080]  and move up the ladder they're all under the plague of the new world order
[03:35:53.080 --> 03:35:57.960]  they're all under the curse of it and the only thing that matters is getting rid
[03:35:57.960 --> 03:36:04.480]  of the globalist because they are unified scientifically deployed satanically
[03:36:04.480 --> 03:36:10.640]  influenced only way to describe these people I mean it's like a science fiction
[03:36:10.640 --> 03:36:14.720]  movie you look at the plan of what they're doing it's how aliens would come
[03:36:14.720 --> 03:36:18.520]  to earth it looked like humans and would build a technocracy take people over
[03:36:18.520 --> 03:36:23.640]  incrementally and basically phase out humanity and then you realize oh my gosh
[03:36:23.640 --> 03:36:27.880]  that's what they're doing but they're not space aliens they believe they're a
[03:36:27.880 --> 03:36:31.640]  new species that's going to merge with machines and are following an exact plan
[03:36:31.640 --> 03:36:36.400]  and they've got all these movies out about it fiction nonfiction books they're
[03:36:36.400 --> 03:36:42.640]  flooding the culture with it I didn't see it but good shard he didn't and did a
[03:36:42.640 --> 03:36:46.560]  review of it what's the name of the film that's out right now about the end of
[03:36:46.560 --> 03:36:51.640]  the world the guys that made the zombie movie it's a comedy and then they find
[03:36:51.640 --> 03:36:54.960]  out that oh really aliens took over merge with humans they're going to
[03:36:54.960 --> 03:37:00.240]  incrementally keep phasing in the new computers yeah this is the end until we
[03:37:00.240 --> 03:37:04.120]  merge with machines and everybody else dies you're a scumbag zombie that's a
[03:37:04.120 --> 03:37:07.080]  metaphor for the general public the elite merge with machines and fly to
[03:37:07.080 --> 03:37:11.760]  planet Pop-Tart and people are like man I'm getting emails and comments when
[03:37:11.760 --> 03:37:14.920]  that's what you say they think they're doing well a while did they get this
[03:37:14.920 --> 03:37:21.320]  from you no folks they didn't get that from me that's what all of the top
[03:37:21.320 --> 03:37:28.840]  globalists say hundreds of bucks that's the plan and man I don't think the New
[03:37:28.840 --> 03:37:32.560]  World Order is the best humanity's got to offer I certainly don't think they
[03:37:32.560 --> 03:37:37.800]  should be running my life but you know what you know what they say they say
[03:37:37.800 --> 03:37:41.960]  Alex the public doesn't want your help they are animals and they will be
[03:37:41.960 --> 03:37:49.560]  killed I've been told off record by people that are inside the New World
[03:37:49.560 --> 03:37:54.280]  Order over and over again started when I go to the state house and I'll go back
[03:37:54.280 --> 03:37:56.880]  to your calls and give me this big announcement started when I go to the
[03:37:56.880 --> 03:38:06.560]  state house 15 16 years ago and I had stuff like you know the speaker come
[03:38:06.560 --> 03:38:10.480]  over to me I'd be on the hike and bike trail and the lieutenant governor or the
[03:38:10.480 --> 03:38:15.600]  former one comes over and they're like Alex you're a smart guy they're always
[03:38:15.600 --> 03:38:20.040]  real charming listen these people you're not gonna be able to help them all you
[03:38:20.040 --> 03:38:23.760]  can do is try to join the system and work within it and but I mean you know
[03:38:23.760 --> 03:38:27.920]  the people are taking up all the resources and they are dumb and let me
[03:38:27.920 --> 03:38:32.720]  tell you something else Alex they would tear you limb from limb if you
[03:38:32.720 --> 03:38:37.720]  actually ever tried to take over the system and help them okay and you're
[03:38:37.720 --> 03:38:41.520]  gonna figure that out someday because you're a smart guy I'll see you later
[03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:47.120]  here's my card here's my card bud you ever want to talk to us that's how and
[03:38:47.120 --> 03:38:53.200]  since then it moved up to high-level politicians heads of companies until
[03:38:53.200 --> 03:38:56.320]  now they don't even do it anymore because they know I'm I've seen where
[03:38:56.320 --> 03:39:01.520]  they're going I would never never in a trillion years sell out to total death
[03:39:01.520 --> 03:39:06.960]  but I mean we're not selling out to boss hog here ladies and gentlemen you're
[03:39:06.960 --> 03:39:13.440]  selling you're not selling out to Roscoe Pico train and flash you're selling out
[03:39:13.440 --> 03:39:20.000]  to the rock bottom of the rabbit hole that ends in the night circle of hell
[03:39:21.920 --> 03:39:27.400]  and that is a no brainer to not sell out to that
[03:39:32.400 --> 03:39:36.280]  and let me tell you that's how they think and that's what they do and that's
[03:39:36.280 --> 03:39:40.080]  who they are and you know the public is many of them absolutely little demonic
[03:39:40.080 --> 03:39:43.760]  trash because they've been taught how to act like that they've been held up like
[03:39:43.760 --> 03:39:49.800]  that and naturally people do have that side to them and that's the globalist
[03:39:49.800 --> 03:39:53.400]  ultimate sin is that they would dump everybody down and wreck their futures
[03:39:53.400 --> 03:39:58.840]  just so they could be in control that to me is the ultimate sin and let me just
[03:39:58.840 --> 03:40:02.680]  make the big announcement now that I'll go to your calls for them okay here in
[03:40:02.680 --> 03:40:13.840]  this fourth hour of overdrive you're gonna wake up one morning and they're
[03:40:13.840 --> 03:40:20.560]  going to blow a large piece a large area of a city into a giant smoldering two
[03:40:20.560 --> 03:40:30.400]  mile wide black crater with images of humans welded into into magma glass you
[03:40:30.400 --> 03:40:36.240]  you'll have the media showing people burned into glass the horror of the of
[03:40:36.240 --> 03:40:42.920]  the patriot either they'll probably call it if I was them the George Washington
[03:40:42.920 --> 03:40:52.040]  group the George Washington group will nuke a city and we'll learn the George
[03:40:52.040 --> 03:41:00.200]  Washington group joined with Iran that's right they were mad about Syria and
[03:41:00.200 --> 03:41:04.120]  stuff and there's a hundred different ways they could do it but oh they
[03:41:04.120 --> 03:41:09.760]  they killed more than 70,000 died instantly when the when the low-yield
[03:41:09.760 --> 03:41:14.520]  weapon detonated or it might be a big one oh oh the the US Army soldiers in the
[03:41:14.520 --> 03:41:20.840]  George Washington group they smuggled out a tin megaton or maybe a 20 megaton
[03:41:20.840 --> 03:41:26.760]  warhead and then they detonated it in a major city not even be Los Angeles
[03:41:26.760 --> 03:41:33.040]  Chicago Dallas Austin but a lot of the elite live here they probably won't do
[03:41:33.040 --> 03:41:40.040]  Austin and and it'll just be oh my gosh we're also scared we better do whatever
[03:41:40.040 --> 03:41:45.320]  we're told now and hunt down the people that did it because after all after all
[03:41:45.320 --> 03:41:49.720]  you're you don't want to be you don't want to argue with this and say that the
[03:41:49.720 --> 03:41:53.680]  government might have to I mean they would never sure they'd give over a
[03:41:53.680 --> 03:41:58.440]  hundred million Americans knowingly cancer viruses to die horribly
[03:41:58.440 --> 03:42:05.560]  excruciating deaths years later on record but they would never kill 60 70
[03:42:05.560 --> 03:42:12.200]  thousand and blind another 50,000 and burn hundreds of me they would not sure
[03:42:12.200 --> 03:42:18.600]  they'd kill tens of millions but they would not I mean that I sure I mean the
[03:42:18.600 --> 03:42:22.760]  government funded al Qaeda in Syria and yeah they yeah the UN did get caught
[03:42:22.760 --> 03:42:26.360]  sterilized people in Africa with tetanus shots that hormones added to them to do
[03:42:26.360 --> 03:42:33.640]  but you know I just and that's fine because you can't believe it I I can
[03:42:33.640 --> 03:42:38.320]  see into the mind of the new order and it's not some psychic thing I live this
[03:42:38.320 --> 03:42:45.000]  I know them I know the enemy and I know who they are I know their heart because
[03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:48.520]  I'm gonna be honest with you folks I love God and I have a good heart but I got a
[03:42:48.520 --> 03:42:54.520]  big fat evil streak right down the middle like everybody does but mine runs
[03:42:54.520 --> 03:43:01.120]  deep and I can basically like a crystal balls two-way folks they can see what
[03:43:01.120 --> 03:43:05.000]  we're doing I can see what they're doing and by the way you can do that as well
[03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:09.760]  as soon as you start looking at who these people are and I mean I know who
[03:43:09.760 --> 03:43:12.880]  they are I know what they plan I know what they want to do they got a lot
[03:43:12.880 --> 03:43:15.920]  different plans laid out on the table and they're trying to figure out which
[03:43:15.920 --> 03:43:21.320]  one's best and how this is gonna work and how that's gonna work and they may I
[03:43:21.320 --> 03:43:25.120]  don't think this will happen till they've got the real clamp down in place
[03:43:25.120 --> 03:43:28.240]  and the police take red and turn the energy sources off to make you totally
[03:43:28.240 --> 03:43:31.520]  dependent then they'll have some smaller bio weapons releases to scare
[03:43:31.520 --> 03:43:35.880]  everybody into really going into kind of a medical tyranny and then they will
[03:43:35.880 --> 03:43:40.960]  just release a bio weapon that they of course has to have the cure for that are
[03:43:40.960 --> 03:43:46.000]  being tested in subterranean facilities on humans all over the world
[03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:55.280]  oh like the atomic soldiers and the rest of it and they will release the white
[03:43:55.280 --> 03:44:04.440]  plague something like that and when they release the white plague you will know
[03:44:04.440 --> 03:44:12.240]  you will know what it is to throw your gold in the streets and to beat
[03:44:12.240 --> 03:44:20.680]  yourself on the head repenting to God it'll be too late it'll be too late
[03:44:20.680 --> 03:44:24.200]  they're gonna release bio weapons they've already released them in the
[03:44:24.200 --> 03:44:27.440]  food and water but they're slow kill so that you can't figure out what happened
[03:44:27.440 --> 03:44:31.080]  to you they're slowly turning up the heat gonna get you weakened and so toxic
[03:44:31.080 --> 03:44:36.040]  and so poisoned and so confused that you can't communicate and operate so they
[03:44:36.040 --> 03:44:40.240]  so they first hit you with a layer of chemical and biological weapon to stun
[03:44:40.240 --> 03:44:45.240]  you because they might get caught if they come up with a frontal attack right
[03:44:45.240 --> 03:44:47.920]  up front and then once they've done that and spiritually and
[03:44:47.920 --> 03:44:53.320]  psychically wounded you and strikingly damaged you and fired their darts into
[03:44:53.320 --> 03:44:56.480]  you once you're kind of rolling around on the ground then they're gonna come
[03:44:56.480 --> 03:45:01.360]  over and stick their big black fangs into you big spider so you're gonna stick
[03:45:01.360 --> 03:45:06.960]  them right into the whole society and just suck it dry because you ask for it
[03:45:06.960 --> 03:45:12.640]  because you open the gates all the hell that's coming with it you think what
[03:45:12.640 --> 03:45:20.400]  you've seen so far that's that's just the the scouts of Satan the vanguard but
[03:45:20.400 --> 03:45:25.000]  the big engines the big siege weapons are rolling in to the interdimensional
[03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:31.440]  gate manifesting and all hell is coming with it every form of wickedness and
[03:45:31.440 --> 03:45:40.960]  invented just things the world has never seen unfolding if you let this evil
[03:45:40.960 --> 03:45:49.240]  resonate see they've only stuns you now and wraps you up and some of us are
[03:45:49.240 --> 03:45:51.880]  trying to get away we're the extremists and they're reaching out the leg to grab
[03:45:51.880 --> 03:45:56.120]  us and trying to put spinnerettes around us because they want to get us all
[03:45:56.120 --> 03:46:02.200]  lined up they can have a big feast you see we're not defenseless bugs we're more
[03:46:02.200 --> 03:46:07.200]  powerful than the spider we're like a colossus made in the image of God that
[03:46:07.200 --> 03:46:13.840]  allows this horrible disease jellyfish to attach to us and suck our blood out and
[03:46:13.840 --> 03:46:18.280]  we bow to it because it wears a black uniform or it has it has epaulets on
[03:46:18.280 --> 03:46:24.360]  with stars and oh let us let us bow to the succubus let us bow to the diseased
[03:46:24.360 --> 03:46:29.640]  rotting zombie forces of the New World Order oh you're so scary oh you're so
[03:46:29.640 --> 03:46:34.480]  powerful oh I'm so afraid of you here let me lay down you come tie me up
[03:46:34.480 --> 03:46:39.680]  because you'll be nice to me if I do that and the spider says yes I will I'm
[03:46:39.680 --> 03:46:45.200]  gonna be very nice to you I hope this doesn't hurt let me get you used to put
[03:46:45.200 --> 03:46:49.800]  my hands on you line up over there I'm gonna take your kids and your wife and
[03:46:49.800 --> 03:46:55.000]  I'm gonna touch him in front of you now and now I'm gonna teach the kids to be
[03:46:55.000 --> 03:46:59.720]  put in handcuffs at school I'm gonna put this on you I had giant prisons full of
[03:46:59.720 --> 03:47:05.160]  people where we suck their souls out and feed them designer GMO or testing on
[03:47:05.160 --> 03:47:11.240]  them and where we sterilize the women oh let me put the spinnerette on there let
[03:47:11.240 --> 03:47:18.560]  me get it all nice and then tie you down you're gonna like this and now that
[03:47:18.560 --> 03:47:24.000]  you're paralyzed in horror and now that you can't do anything and now that you're
[03:47:24.000 --> 03:47:31.360]  laying there you know I'm gonna suck everything out of you now how's that
[03:47:31.360 --> 03:47:45.480]  feel they are spiders I mean I see them they are giant giant demonic spiders
[03:47:45.480 --> 03:47:52.680]  folks operating basically through humans that's what possession is the Bible's
[03:47:52.680 --> 03:47:58.720]  all right folks we are dealing with demonic giant demonic entities that for
[03:47:58.720 --> 03:48:02.400]  the entire history of humanity have been sucking on us and hurting us and
[03:48:02.400 --> 03:48:06.360]  trying to twist us and trying to hurt and now they're getting ready for their
[03:48:06.360 --> 03:48:10.480]  giant war against humanity before we get off world before we go to the next
[03:48:10.480 --> 03:48:13.920]  level before the things the eye has not seen the ear is not heard before we're
[03:48:13.920 --> 03:48:19.160]  given all that they desperately want to destroy us and annihilate us and that's
[03:48:19.160 --> 03:48:27.040]  what makes me sick that's what makes me want to throw up and if I had to describe
[03:48:27.040 --> 03:48:31.200]  these these these entities they're like spiders
[03:48:34.840 --> 03:48:40.960]  we're not dealing with a bunch of sleast acts here folks I'm sure the media can
[03:48:40.960 --> 03:48:46.000]  have fun with that but over a billion really it's two billion people say
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:48.580]  they're Christian I mean isn't that what the Bible says it comes to kill
[03:48:48.580 --> 03:48:53.800]  steal and destroy it comes to enslave the innocent it comes to persecute the
[03:48:53.800 --> 03:48:58.960]  women and the children I mean these people are demons and whether they
[03:48:58.960 --> 03:49:03.960]  exist or not I'm saying the archetype of the Jeffrey Dahmer is that not a
[03:49:03.960 --> 03:49:08.640]  spider luring 13 year olds and people into his house to torture them for
[03:49:08.640 --> 03:49:14.840]  weeks on in injecting their brain with acid that he'd read about to paralyze
[03:49:14.840 --> 03:49:24.680]  them so they could be in horror but not scream the spider the spider our enemy
[03:49:24.680 --> 03:49:31.400]  is the spider telling you right now these people act and behave exactly like
[03:49:31.400 --> 03:49:37.560]  spiders so there's your analogy there's your archetype oh spider-man he ain't
[03:49:37.560 --> 03:49:41.680]  your friend see see how that archetype you're you're all of this stuff is you're
[03:49:41.680 --> 03:49:47.140]  being bombarded continually by these predators so realize the system is run
[03:49:47.140 --> 03:49:51.280]  by spiders spiritually speaking I mean that's what how I would describe the
[03:49:51.280 --> 03:49:58.040]  devil archetype I don't mean literal you know spires but they want to carve us
[03:49:58.040 --> 03:50:01.400]  up real nice they want to take their time from end to end destroying
[03:50:01.400 --> 03:50:06.400]  humanity and we have to say no to it and that's what I basically wanted to get
[03:50:06.400 --> 03:50:09.920]  to today we'll come back and I will jam it as many as I can this final segment
[03:50:09.920 --> 03:50:14.480]  and I'll be completely exhausted after the broadcast today but I just had to go
[03:50:14.480 --> 03:50:19.800]  over all this with you today and that's all they're doing that's why they're
[03:50:19.800 --> 03:50:22.640]  telling your kids they're racist they have a brown bag the spiders making
[03:50:22.640 --> 03:50:26.480]  contact saying you're bad let me tie you up and this will turn out okay it will
[03:50:26.480 --> 03:50:32.520]  not Stockholm syndrome will not protect you I know the spiders scary folks but
[03:50:32.520 --> 03:50:37.000]  you're gonna have to fight it you understand and that's what Obama is
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:40.880]  he's a sick predator when you look in his eyes he loves conning old ladies he
[03:50:40.880 --> 03:50:44.880]  loves knowing he's gonna ruin their life he loves setting people up he loves
[03:50:44.880 --> 03:50:51.160]  setting a trap a web the worldwide web they love the web they love capturing
[03:50:51.160 --> 03:50:56.800]  us well you know what I've come I've come ladies and gentlemen with the sword

[03:52:03.520 --> 03:52:06.880]  producing an increase in circulating white blood cells this happens because
[03:52:06.880 --> 03:52:11.800]  nature designed us to eat food that is undamaged at the molecular level when we
[03:52:11.800 --> 03:52:14.960]  heat food to normal cooking temperatures we change the shape of the
[03:52:14.960 --> 03:52:18.920]  molecules into shapes the body cannot use the body now looks at them as
[03:52:18.920 --> 03:52:23.360]  toxins and allergens in an effort to protect itself from this irritant the
[03:52:23.360 --> 03:52:26.960]  body intelligently increases the amount of circulating white blood cells to
[03:52:26.960 --> 03:52:31.160]  act as garbage collectors white blood cells gobble up all the unusable damaged
[03:52:31.160 --> 03:52:35.240]  food particles to neutralize their cell damaging properties this puts stress on

[03:54:23.120 --> 03:54:28.920]  no the thing is that I walked into work on September 11th I'm sorry yeah September
[03:54:28.920 --> 03:54:34.040]  11th 2001 and you see in our office was right across from the Pentagon and I
[03:54:34.040 --> 03:54:37.880]  saw the the the planes that it hit there the one plane that it hit the towers
[03:54:37.880 --> 03:54:41.280]  and nobody could believe it I mean that's that's the big trick right nobody
[03:54:41.280 --> 03:54:46.720]  can believe this stuff is happening and I walked out I sat down at my desk did
[03:54:46.720 --> 03:54:50.680]  some work I looked up and all of a sudden there's smoke coming up there's no
[03:54:50.680 --> 03:54:54.200]  plane there was nothing going on there I just saw a bunch of smoke the next thing
[03:54:54.200 --> 03:55:00.040]  we know we're being evacuated later even after the anthrax scare we were all
[03:55:00.040 --> 03:55:04.400]  told because we were in that area we had to report to the the hospital so all
[03:55:04.400 --> 03:55:07.640]  these people come to this hospital and get our sip row and all this stuff and
[03:55:07.640 --> 03:55:13.040]  hey hey hey I've interviewed people by name who were famous victims who survived
[03:55:13.040 --> 03:55:17.840]  lady with her baby all that there was no plane and they found witnesses they oh I
[03:55:17.840 --> 03:55:21.480]  saw the plane because they had one fly over right when they blew it up that's
[03:55:21.480 --> 03:55:26.040]  how smart they are as best we can tell they had one go over and then a missile
[03:55:26.040 --> 03:55:30.520]  hit it so head there's there's absolutely no no proof whatsoever that
[03:55:30.520 --> 03:55:34.400]  there was a plane that that size that would have any kind of effect like that
[03:55:34.400 --> 03:55:38.640]  but that's you know that's that as you know and you've been telling people there
[03:55:38.640 --> 03:55:43.200]  were unbroken windows right where the engine was supposed to be exactly you
[03:55:43.200 --> 03:55:47.200]  know and I'm sitting there looking at it all I'm seeing is smoke you look at the
[03:55:47.200 --> 03:55:51.240]  pictures and and it was only years later and this is why every September 11 we've
[03:55:51.240 --> 03:55:55.120]  got to push this message forward because not only is where it's all began it is
[03:55:55.120 --> 03:56:01.720]  the is the biggest tipping of their hand in in in a long time even though the
[03:56:01.720 --> 03:56:06.360]  information there and it's all in plain sight in terms of a widespread broadcast
[03:56:06.360 --> 03:56:14.280]  huge you know white you know that the the conspirit the the trickery of it no

[03:57:53.000 --> 03:57:59.000]  got one minute NFA how about NNFE which is National Nuclear Security Agency
[03:57:59.000 --> 03:58:05.040]  they have an office of transportation office of secure
[03:58:05.040 --> 03:58:10.920]  transportation which ships by convoy nuclear material nuclear weapons and
[03:58:10.920 --> 03:58:16.600]  get this nuclear components and the one component we're all going to look at is
[03:58:16.600 --> 03:58:24.880]  a nuclear pit and nuclear pit is the fuse for a nuclear weapon the fuse of this
[03:58:24.880 --> 03:58:28.520]  firecracker the big firecracker with in itself is a firecracker with the
[03:58:28.520 --> 03:58:33.240]  equivalent of a Nagasaki or Emers humor explosion just from the fuse that touches
[03:58:33.240 --> 03:58:36.880]  off a nuclear weapon yeah and those are easier I guess to rig and detonate then
[03:58:36.880 --> 03:58:44.680]  blame on Iran God bless you folks pray for peace thank you for listening to GCN
