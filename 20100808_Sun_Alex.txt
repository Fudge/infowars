[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:11.000 --> 00:18.000]  It is Sunday August 8th, 2010. We're going to be live here for the next two hours with
[00:18.000 --> 00:24.000]  the Sunday abbreviated transmission and we're going to have open phones throughout the two
[00:24.000 --> 00:30.000]  hours and a ton of vital news. I specifically want to ask callers, you can call in about
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  any subject you want, but I want to ask callers, when is enough going to be enough for the
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  American people and the people of the planet? How many trillions do offshore banks have to
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  steal? How many carbon taxes do the governments controlled by these banks have to pass? How
[00:48.000 --> 00:56.000]  do we have to lose to globalism to realize that they want to destroy our independence
[00:56.000 --> 01:04.000]  and literally domesticate us in their own words? Some of the news I have here is dealing with
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  numbers around the country. Here's a Dallas Morning News report, headline across Texas,
[01:09.000 --> 01:16.000]  60,000 babies of non-citizens get U.S. birthright. In the last year alone in Texas,
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  60 plus thousand illegal aliens came in and had their babies here in Texas or more than
[01:23.000 --> 01:30.000]  16% of all births in the state and their families were immediately allowed to stay. They're
[01:30.000 --> 01:40.000]  able to get welfare by having a child and in most cases, in most cases, the birth is free.
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  It's paid for, but citizens don't get that. And of course the illegal aliens also are
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  released for drunk driving, armed robbery. They're above the law. Why? The globalists
[01:51.000 --> 01:59.000]  want to grease the skids and incentivize the third world moving here to be a foreign army
[01:59.000 --> 02:06.000]  inside of the country. At Parkland Memorial Hospital where I was born in Dallas and where
[02:06.000 --> 02:14.000]  they took Kennedy when he was dead, I would add, 74% of the births in the last year of
[02:14.000 --> 02:24.000]  the 11,071 at that hospital, 74% were illegal aliens, children, and the majority were free.
[02:24.000 --> 02:33.000]  Can you imagine if 74% of the births at a major hospital in Mexico were Americans who
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.000]  were illegal going down there and then suddenly they were made to be Mexican citizens and
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  everything was paid for? What a joke! Only the American people would put up with something
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  like this and then as the country goes bankrupt and you start to complain, you get called
[02:47.000 --> 02:54.000]  a racist. So they're moving for a constitutional amendment to block the anchor babies. My problem
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  is when they open up an amendment process, they could try to pass other amendments changing
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  the Constitution at the same time in the Constitutional Convention. There's got to be
[03:05.000 --> 03:13.000]  other ways to put a stop to this. So that is coming up today. Boehner says end to birthright
[03:13.000 --> 03:21.000]  citizenship worth considering. Also violence in Mexico intensifies. Fidel Castro has now
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  gone and given a speech to their government and he appeared to be healthy after beating
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  cancer a few years ago and said that we're on the edge of World War III and nuclear
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  conflagration. I don't agree with Fidel Castro's politics, but I do agree with his geopolitical
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  analysis of the situation with North Korea and Iran. We'll be discussing that. Also,
[03:41.000 --> 03:48.000]  finally, it's broken into mainstream news, CNET news, CBS, San Francisco Chronicle, that
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  yes, there's high levels of radiation from the naked body scanners and yes, they're lying
[03:53.000 --> 04:00.000]  about storing the images, whether it's federal courthouses, state courthouses or whether it's
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  the airports, they're saving them all with your name. So we'll be going over that as
[04:05.000 --> 04:10.000]  well. Plus, a major study shows CIA doctors gave green light to torture. That was admitted
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.000]  five years ago. They're the ones that conduct and order the torture. Also, IMF document
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  illustrates plan to create a global currency. That's now mainstream news. We'll be discussing
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  that and the economy, but I also want to open the phones up. The toll-free number to join
[04:25.000 --> 04:40.000]  us is 888-201-2244-888-201244. On this live August 8th, 2010, transmission, the websites

[05:57.000 --> 06:22.000]  too important to wait.
[06:27.000 --> 06:34.000]  Glad that you could join us in the defense of the Republic as we attempt and have some
[06:34.000 --> 06:41.000]  success at awakening people worldwide to the fact that we have a global corporate tyranny
[06:41.000 --> 06:49.000]  that uses a mix of communism, fascism, socialism to bring in this global private corporate
[06:49.000 --> 06:56.000]  governance that is unelected and extremely predatory and authoritarian. It is Sunday,
[06:56.000 --> 07:02.000]  8th day of August, 2010. We're going to have wide open phones throughout the two hour
[07:02.000 --> 07:08.000]  abbreviated Sunday Transmission. Of course, we do three hours weekdays, 11 to 2 p.m.
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.000]  Central. The toll-free number to join us today on any of the issues I'm going to raise or
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  any new stories or topics that you want to comment on or if you want to agree with me
[07:17.000 --> 07:29.000]  or ask a question or disagree, 888-201-2244-888-201-2244. I want to add that if you disagree with
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  me, you go to the head of the line. We don't screen your calls, but if you volunteer that
[07:33.000 --> 07:38.000]  you disagree, you will go to the head of the line. Sometimes we screen calls, but only
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  if we have a guest on a particular topic, we want to make sure you're calling in about
[07:42.000 --> 07:48.000]  that topic. But today it is just wide open phones, and the toll-free number to join us
[07:48.000 --> 07:57.000]  is 888-201-2244-888-201-2244, and we will get you up and on the air. We'll start taking
[07:57.000 --> 08:03.000]  those calls coming up in the next segment. North Korea has seized a South Korean fishing
[08:03.000 --> 08:12.000]  boat amid drills with the United States, South Korea, and Japan, and Fidel Castro is warning
[08:12.000 --> 08:18.000]  that the escalation of tensions with Iran and North Korea could lead to World War III.
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  Again, I don't like Fidel Castro's politics, but I do agree with his analysis. This could
[08:23.000 --> 08:28.000]  certainly lead to that. That's just some of the news that we're going to be covering
[08:28.000 --> 08:36.000]  on that front. Also, really scary development. I don't often agree with the news analysis
[08:36.000 --> 08:43.000]  at the Huffington Post, but they're reporting, and so is ABC News, that Google Verizon deal
[08:43.000 --> 08:49.000]  the end of the Internet as we know it. And this is corporations making deals with each
[08:49.000 --> 08:57.000]  other to basically only let their customers visit certain websites. That's what this will
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.000]  lead to, where they will have preferred agreements with select media corporations and Internet
[09:03.000 --> 09:10.000]  service providers to fast track people being able to get online and visit those sites,
[09:10.000 --> 09:17.000]  and the corporate dossiers put out in the consortium meetings known as Internet 2 shows
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.000]  that they are moving to a point where you'll have the new Internet, which is just a few
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  thousand sites you can visit at ultra-high speed in the old Internet that's basically
[09:26.000 --> 09:33.000]  allowed to deteriorate and fall apart into nothing. There's been an interesting ruling
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  tracking your car. Cops need a warrant, says Judge. Police cannot surreptitiously stick
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  a GPS unit on your car and track your movements without a warrant. The U.S. Court of Appeals
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  for the District of Columbia has ruled in an opinion published Friday. The courts of
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  the police use of GPS evidence to convict two individuals was a violation of the Fourth
[09:52.000 --> 10:02.000]  Amendment. Well, here's a problem with that. By federal law, 1996, Public Communications
[10:02.000 --> 10:12.000]  Act, all cell phones are designed to be tracked via GPS locator. They're not actually GPS
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  themselves. They triangulate with the cell towers down to about 15 feet, and the police
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  do wire this into their threat fusion centers and can track anybody they want in real time
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  and dial in and actually physically listen to you over the phone using the speakerphone
[10:27.000 --> 10:33.000]  function even when the phone is off. But the bigger issue here is license plate reading
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  cameras that have been put in nationwide. That's how they can turn existing roads into
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.000]  toll roads overnight and just mail you bills. They're using the license plate readers in
[10:42.000 --> 10:49.000]  many cities in the last decade have announced, you've seen the headline, town runs the plates
[10:49.000 --> 10:55.000]  of everyone that enters and it's completely illegal and has nothing to do with your security.
[10:55.000 --> 11:01.000]  It's all about controlling and tracking you. So interesting news on that front. Some more
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.000]  good news. This is out of the Oregonian. Lemonade stand gets reprieve that was outraged over
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  the week over some young girls aged six and seven with a small lemonade stand raking in
[11:13.000 --> 11:22.000]  as much as $15 a weekend selling cups of lemonade for 50 cents and they had been shut down. They
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  were demanding $150 licensing fee but they've backed off there on that front. But that's
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.000]  just some of the miscellaneous news. Let me just read to you some of the other headlines
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  we will cover in the next hour because then we're going to go to break and come back and
[11:38.000 --> 11:46.000]  cover some of our top stories. And then your phone calls, airport body scanner scandal
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.000]  erupts. This out of the San Francisco Chronicle, CNET News is also reporting what we told you
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  a year ago. The federal government thinks you're a bunch of idiots and they lie to you as a
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  course of action, standard operating criminal procedure. And they've announced, oh, don't
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  worry at federal and state courthouses, don't worry at county courthouses, don't worry at
[12:06.000 --> 12:13.000]  airports. We are scanning your body 360 but A, there's no radiation, doesn't hurt you.
[12:13.000 --> 12:19.000]  Now they admit that's a lie, very high levels, testicular cancer, skin cancer, you name it.
[12:19.000 --> 12:26.000]  But don't worry, we can't see your genitals and don't worry, we're not saving it. And
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.000]  now they've had to admit in their own federal documents and even Homeland Security now admits
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  this, that it is 20 to 50 times the radiation they previously said depending on the machine.
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  There's two different companies, one's 20 times, one's 50 plus. You pull that up, that's
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  associated press, very high levels of radiation, especially if you're a frequent traveler.
[12:42.000 --> 12:49.000]  But government says the precedent. Now they're talking about chest x-rays because of breast implant
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  bombs. You can't make this stuff up, that's Reuters. Of course, they'll tell you chest x-rays are
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  good for you, or maybe drinking Prozac is good for you. I don't know, but they're reporting
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.000]  on that. And of course there is the mail online dose that may be up to 20 times higher than
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  first estimated. We have that on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers. So they premeditatedly
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.000]  lied to you that they weren't looking your genitals when they're trained in the manuals
[13:15.000 --> 13:22.000]  to look at the genitals for definition. They're trained to look at men and women's genitals
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.000]  for definition to make sure the scanner is tuned. And they are 360 scanning you for a
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.000]  biometric scan, just like a face print or a thumb print. When you go get your driver's license,
[13:33.000 --> 13:38.000]  which they now use at warrantless checkpoints, just like they enroll Iraqis in these biometric
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  systems at checkpoints, you're being enrolled. Now they admit it is a 360 scan of your body.
[13:43.000 --> 13:50.000]  So passive cameras that fire millimeter waves through your clothes, even if you're wearing
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  a mask or a disguise, they know who you are. It creates a digital mark or number, just
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.000]  like a face scan or thumb print. By making digital measurements, they also have a biometrics
[14:01.000 --> 14:06.000]  for your particular walk that they've gotten placed nationwide through the AI software
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  system, sucked into cameras. And it's all part of the enslavement grid. So they lied to you
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.000]  about the radiation. They lied to you about saving the images and they lied to you about
[14:16.000 --> 14:23.000]  looking at your genitals. There's been quite a few fistfights now. And TSA workers saying,
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  hey, baby, I want to date. Will you be my sex slave? One guy got arrested for that. They've
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  had fistfights where they make fun of TSA employees. They may go through these when they make fun
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  of their genitals. I mean, you've seen that in the news. They've made Hollywood people
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  and TV stars. They print off their naked bodies, particularly women think it's okay to harass
[14:43.000 --> 14:50.000]  men. And in fact, in both cases, it was women. TSA workers have been arrested for trying
[14:50.000 --> 14:58.000]  to have sex with women they've body scanned. There's the Fox News headline TSA worker arrested
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.000]  after jokes, fights about size of genitalia. So they're just complete liars. But the bigger
[15:04.000 --> 15:11.000]  issue here is, why do we trust anything they say? They always lie. Even when the truth would
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.000]  serve them, they lie. They lie to you over and over again. They told you the bailout
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  was $787 million. It's over $28 trillion according to Bloomberg and growing. They tell you that
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  the money was going to be for the tarp. And then October 4th, the day after they passed
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.000]  it, Paulson announced we're going to spend it secretly and not tell you where and Obama's
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  people continue that. So the issue for the listeners is I want to hear from you. Are
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.000]  they training us to just accept that they're a pack of criminal liars? I mean, what more
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  are we going to put up with here? You know, police are trained how to lie on the stand.
[15:45.000 --> 15:51.000]  That's now come out in court. We'll also get into illegal aliens. Seventy-four percent
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  of births at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas were illegal aliens. Most of it was
[15:55.000 --> 16:02.000]  a free birth. You pay for it as the taxpayers and still the illegals whine. You may be arrested
[16:02.000 --> 16:08.000]  or subject to other police action. Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has
[16:08.000 --> 16:14.000]  become reality. It really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.000]  the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  Police State Four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[16:34.000 --> 16:40.000]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship. Body scanners, sound cameras,
[16:40.000 --> 16:46.000]  citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning
[16:46.000 --> 16:51.000]  of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[18:02.000 --> 18:06.000]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[18:06.000 --> 18:11.000]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[18:11.000 --> 18:16.000]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first
[18:16.000 --> 18:21.000]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses
[18:21.000 --> 18:27.000]  the respiratory system with your self produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[18:27.000 --> 18:33.000]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the sale
[18:33.000 --> 18:39.000]  of nano silver products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the
[18:39.000 --> 18:44.000]  Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided making
[18:44.000 --> 18:51.000]  production fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[18:51.000 --> 18:58.000]  technology of the Silver Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[18:58.000 --> 19:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.000]  Number 1, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.000]  2, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.000]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[19:19.000 --> 19:24.000]  is coming. Number 3, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[19:24.000 --> 19:30.000]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number 4, dangerous weather is
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of families lose their power from
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.000]  weather related onages. Number 5, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  and peace of mind. Folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.000]  from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[19:49.000 --> 19:55.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[19:55.000 --> 20:21.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365. Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:21.000 --> 20:31.000]  Okay folks, we are back live and Qaisal and Kiesel and Cliff disagree so I'll go to them
[20:31.000 --> 20:37.000]  first and then Rob, Brian, Michelle and many many others that are patiently holding, toll free
[20:37.000 --> 20:43.000]  number to join us so that we've got about 15 calls already on the system 888-201-2244.
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000]  But if you just joined us the government admittedly lied in the last year about the naked body
[20:48.000 --> 20:54.000]  standards, big surprise about the radiation, about the digital recording of your genitals,
[20:54.000 --> 20:59.000]  about the fact that they're saving it and it's now admitted they save them all with your name
[20:59.000 --> 21:05.000]  and that's what they want is a scan of your body for biometric purposes. It's also about humiliating you.
[21:05.000 --> 21:11.000]  Remember for 38 years in the entire western world there is a UN program, the Pentagon administers it
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  through the state health departments here in the United States to take your baby's blood at birth.
[21:15.000 --> 21:23.000]  It's set up on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers. There's the Austin's KXAN news bartering your baby's blood
[21:23.000 --> 21:29.000]  and it says they secretly take it at birth. It's not for a blood test as they tell you and it is sent
[21:29.000 --> 21:35.000]  to the Pentagon and then they give the local hospital money. Now I got all the documents 14 years ago,
[21:35.000 --> 21:41.000]  told you the entire story and people suck their thumbs and laughed because that's not possible.
[21:41.000 --> 21:46.000]  The government doesn't lie. It only loves us. It's not a bunch of corrupt interests that control it.
[21:46.000 --> 21:54.000]  No, everything's fine. Here's another good one. U.S. agency rules out health threat from oil dispersants.
[21:54.000 --> 21:59.000]  Obama has said repeatedly, perhaps we can pull it up. You guys have it saved in the system.
[21:59.000 --> 22:05.000]  Obama says no health risk in golf. You can go to YouTube and find it. He says it.
[22:05.000 --> 22:12.000]  It's safe. Remember Christina Todd Whitman in the weeks of her 9-11? Originally the EPA said we've tested the dust
[22:12.000 --> 22:19.000]  day two on September 13th and they said it's totally deadly, mercury, pulverized glass, asbestos.
[22:19.000 --> 22:24.000]  There's several feet of it all over Midtown Manhattan and Lower Manhattan. It's very deadly.
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  You better wear respirators and then she came out and said, no, there's no health problem.
[22:28.000 --> 22:33.000]  Reopen all the schools. Everything's fine. And now they've been blocking almost nine years in,
[22:33.000 --> 22:39.000]  eight plus years in, the firefighters, police, and National Guard medical workers, the heroes,
[22:39.000 --> 22:46.000]  the heroes of 9-11, they don't get health care. And a large percentage of them have died.
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.000]  In fact, the government would deny when they would do CAT scans of their lungs at major hospitals
[22:52.000 --> 22:57.000]  and they would be filled with deadly poison. In particular, the government would say it's a conspiracy theory
[22:57.000 --> 23:04.000]  and the New York Post made fun of them and said the cops and others just wanted money, that they were ambulance chasers.
[23:04.000 --> 23:11.000]  Oh, really? Oh, well, here's a new one. U.S. agency rules out health threat from oil dispersants.
[23:11.000 --> 23:18.000]  French news agency says dispersants use a breakup crude leaking from the ruptured Gulf of Mexico oil spill
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  are not likely to accumulate the seafood, even though it's admitted they are, and affect humans.
[23:22.000 --> 23:29.000]  That's what the U.S. Food and Recommendation said. And, of course, the cleanup companies run by Halliburton
[23:29.000 --> 23:35.000]  and BP are on record telling their workers not to wear respirators because if they did that,
[23:35.000 --> 23:41.000]  they would have to admit that there was a health risk. And so you've already had people die.
[23:41.000 --> 23:47.000]  The average life expectancy for Exxon Valdez, people that clean up crews, is 51.
[23:47.000 --> 23:53.000]  There's a core exit and other dispersants that are many times more toxic than crude oil itself.
[23:53.000 --> 24:01.000]  And almost all of them are dead. That's associated press. But they're telling you there's no problem.
[24:01.000 --> 24:09.000]  No problem. And here's one. This is out of AP. Spike Lee bashes U.S. report on vanishing Gulf oil.
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.000]  Well, there's a lot of scientists and people saying it's a cover up too, but they focus on Spike Lee,
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  so people will think, well, he's just a movie director. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[24:18.000 --> 24:25.000]  Filmmaker Spike Lee is calling it a lie. The U.S. government report that 75% of the Gulf Coast oil is gone.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  And he goes over the fact that it is a lie and shows the evidence.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  So, you know, the issue I'm raising here is why do we just accept these lies?
[24:33.000 --> 24:39.000]  Why does no one get in trouble at the federal government lying about taking your baby's blood secretly
[24:39.000 --> 24:44.000]  and having people use core exit to clean things up and saying, don't worry if you're getting sick.
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.000]  That's all in your head. You know, go back to sleep. Nothing here to see. Move along, move along.
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  Everything's fine using, I guess, a Jedi mind trick on people. You know, these aren't the droids you're looking for.
[24:55.000 --> 25:00.000]  These aren't the droids we're looking for. Move along, move along, move along.
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  This stuff doesn't work on Alex Jones. And I know it's not working on a lot of you.
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  And that's why the American people are angry and upset.
[25:09.000 --> 25:21.000]  And in major polls, over 70% of the American people are angry and are upset and want to shut down the borders
[25:21.000 --> 25:28.000]  and want to restore sovereignty to this country and want to get us out of these wars.
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  But this isn't a supposed democracy. It's a republic.
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.000]  But under the republic, you have to have a declaration of war.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  And if the people don't want to be in a war, you're not in a war. But it doesn't matter. They continue.
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  Now we're going to go to break soon, but I want to go ahead and get a few calls in first that disagree going to them first.
[25:46.000 --> 25:53.000]  Let's talk to Cliff in Colorado. You're on the air, Cliff.
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  Hey, Cliff, how are you doing, buddy?
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  Oh, good, good.
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  You're on the air.
[25:59.000 --> 26:07.000]  I want to read from a McClatchy newspaper report out of the Denver Post from July 15.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  What do you disagree with?
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  Immigration. So I want to read this.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  Okay.
[26:15.000 --> 26:32.000]  Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, quoted from Bible's books of Matthew, Leviticus, and Micah, and pressing for action on the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants currently living in the United States.
[26:32.000 --> 26:46.000]  The Southern Baptist's respect and strongly support opposing America's law, he said, but they quote, also recognize a biblical mandate. I'm sorry. To care for the least of these among us.
[26:46.000 --> 26:56.000]  That's from Matthew. To care for the strangers who reside in our land from Leviticus and Hebrews, and to act justly and mercifully from Micah.
[26:56.000 --> 27:09.000]  What happened in the Old Testament? Did God tell the Israelites to dwell in peace with everybody? No. No, and I'm not calling for this, but God said, wipe out all these enemies.
[27:09.000 --> 27:21.000]  So, I mean, I've got to love how you try to call up and use some bought-off corrupt, you know, World Council of Churches mouthpiece to tell us this.
[27:21.000 --> 27:29.000]  Can I go to Mexico and have a baby and become a Mexican citizen and have the birth paid for by Mexican taxpayers?
[27:29.000 --> 27:39.000]  Well, if I ask you a question, Cliff, can I go to Mexico and have a baby at a hospital with my wife?
[27:39.000 --> 27:53.000]  Can I fly into Mexico City and stay in a hotel a week before my wife has a baby, and when her water breaks, take her to a hospital and have it all paid for, and then my son or daughter who's born becomes a Mexican citizen, and then I get free welfare.
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.000]  Can I do that in Mexico?
[27:57.000 --> 28:13.000]  And now you're fear-mongering innocent babies. No, I'm going to say it again. I'm going to ask you a question here. There's 6 billion, 500 million people outside the United States, and they all want to come here, and the government wants to give them free welfare,
[28:13.000 --> 28:19.000]  and Bloomberg reports 46 states have already gone bankrupt on paper. They just haven't told the public yet.
[28:19.000 --> 28:30.000]  So, I'm going to ask you again. Has NAFTA and GATT been good for the United States or Mexico? No. Can I go to Mexico and have a child and have it paid for and have that child become a citizen?
[28:30.000 --> 28:37.000]  The answer is no. So, again, lame, lame, lame response. Appreciate your call, Cliff.
[28:37.000 --> 28:54.000]  I'm not going to let you. You called in and said some crackerjack litterbug preacher is telling me that I've got to pay for people's babies and then be slapped in the face and told, listen, go back to Europe and give me all your money and get out of here gringo.
[28:54.000 --> 29:08.000]  I'm done. I'm done. No.
[29:24.000 --> 29:42.000]  I'm done.
[29:42.000 --> 30:00.000]  The place to go is eFoodsDirect.com. Go to their website online right now, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex or call 800-409-5633. Again, on the web, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[30:00.000 --> 30:12.000]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand? What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[30:12.000 --> 30:22.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner. So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[30:22.000 --> 30:31.000]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate. Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising. You have been warned.
[30:31.000 --> 30:39.000]  We have the facts. We have the constitution. We have the Bill of Rights. We have common law. Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[30:39.000 --> 31:00.000]  Don't tread on me. Rise the republic. Charity is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising. A new tool in the info war.

[33:11.000 --> 33:31.000]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, and that caller that disagreed, he had nothing to say. I would ask him a question, he wouldn't respond to it. If you're going to disagree with me and you throw out points, you need to be able to at least respond.
[33:31.000 --> 33:45.000]  But the issue is, in the last 100 years, the World Council of Churches, shut up by the Rockefellers, teach us to turn our guns in, Protestant churches do it, all the big mainline denominations, the Catholics do it.
[33:45.000 --> 33:57.000]  They tell you submit to government, submit to socialism, that that's the American way you're going to hell. And Hitler did the same thing. He used the churches and Romans 13 to make everybody submit.
[33:57.000 --> 34:08.000]  The founding fathers didn't buy into it. Mexico is where about 80% of the immigrants are coming from. We have over 30 million illegal aliens, not 20 million like the news says.
[34:08.000 --> 34:19.000]  Major corporations have done analysis, say it's over 30 million. And Mexico lost wars with the United States. When the illegals have their demonstrations, they've got Mexican flags.
[34:19.000 --> 34:30.000]  The illegals in San Francisco repeatedly make the school, make the U.S. citizen kids, in one case who are Hispanic, go home for wearing American flags.
[34:30.000 --> 34:45.000]  The American flag is so offensive to many of the Mexican illegal aliens that they can't even look at it. All over the country, they go to police stations, firehouses, post offices, private businesses and pull down American flags.
[34:45.000 --> 34:56.000]  It's a military action to go pull somebody's flag down. They understand that. You ever play plant the flag in Boy Scouts, where everybody starts wrestling, playing king of the hill, trying to plant your flag.
[34:56.000 --> 35:07.000]  It's a military simulation of taking the hill, seeing the famous photo from World War II at Iwo Jima with the Marines raising, oh, there's a photo on screen.
[35:07.000 --> 35:21.000]  We're simulcasting the radio show at prisonplanet.tv. That was at a public school where the illegals pulled down the American flag and ran the Mexican flag up on top of it with the Mexican flag above it with the American flag flying upside down.
[35:21.000 --> 35:30.000]  I'm not putting up with this. Look, I have gone out and protested the Ku Klux Klan more than 10 times because I don't like racist groups.
[35:30.000 --> 35:38.000]  But Mecha and Laraza, what does Laraza mean? It means the race. What's the slogan? For those inside the race, everything. For those outside the race, nothing.
[35:38.000 --> 35:49.000]  And we don't have 30 million Klan members in this country saying they want the Southwest for themselves. I'm done. I'm done. I'm not going to be part of the politically correct cover up of this information.
[35:49.000 --> 35:56.000]  Okay. There's the photo on screen of the high school with the American flag being torn down, the Mexican flag run up.
[35:56.000 --> 36:04.000]  Now, let me get back to my point and I'm going to your calls. This is just one Dallas Morning News story about it, and it's up at infoworks.com and prisonplanet.com.
[36:04.000 --> 36:14.000]  We have links to it if you want to read it. Drudge also has it. Across Texas, 60,000 babies of non-citizens get U.S. birthright in one year.
[36:14.000 --> 36:25.000]  This is out today, August 8, 2010. And it goes on to say that of the 1.5 million illegals living in Texas, it's like 2 million in and around Houston, folks.
[36:25.000 --> 36:35.000]  What the police estimate. To reside, at least 60,000 babies are added to households annually. At least 60,000. That's a whitewash number.
[36:35.000 --> 36:45.000]  At Parkland in the last year of 11,071 babies were born to women who were non-citizens. 74% of total delivery.
[36:45.000 --> 36:55.000]  So the hospital where I was born, where my dad, going to dental school at the time, worked two jobs on top of dental school to pay for it.
[36:55.000 --> 37:07.000]  He went in with cash money for Alex Emerick Jones, Alexander Emerick Jones to be born, and he put the money down and he paid for it at this very same hospital.
[37:07.000 --> 37:14.000]  Because that's the big issue. This article doesn't report on it. You can pull it up. Most of the illegals go to the emergency room and get it free.
[37:14.000 --> 37:22.000]  If I say free, I said free. Oh, but it's biblical to give it free.
[37:22.000 --> 37:30.000]  Oh, the citizens aren't getting the healthcare free? No. The citizens, when they get pulled over, drive and go to jail, but the illegals in most cases don't.
[37:30.000 --> 37:46.000]  There are 860-plus cities. 800-plus cities are sanctuary cities where the illegals are above the law because the globalists want them here to drive down wages and to be a political arm that will vote for gun control and vote for globalism.
[37:46.000 --> 38:00.000]  And the article continues to go over all of these numbers. Over 16% of all births in Texas were illegal aliens, and their children become legal, become citizens, their families can stay, and they get all this free welfare.
[38:00.000 --> 38:11.000]  And you can't go to any other country in the world and do this. You certainly can't go to Mexico. Some of the most draconian laws against immigrants in the world, and I'm not calling for those.
[38:11.000 --> 38:21.000]  I mean, you have to understand, Americans are loving, good, open-hearted people. But the country is going bankrupt, and Mexico has always been antagonistic with the United States.
[38:21.000 --> 38:30.000]  It's one of the only, it's the only country we've had a war with that borders us. Before Canada was a country, it was British and French run, and we had wars with them.
[38:30.000 --> 38:42.000]  We've had wars with Mexico. They teach in Mexican schools to hate America and that the Southwest belongs to Mexico. And I'm supposed to not talk about this.
[38:42.000 --> 38:47.000]  It's basically like Germany and France hating each other, having all these wars.
[38:47.000 --> 38:56.000]  Now, we need to do something about this. We need to do something about American flags being torn down. We need to do something about illegals.
[38:56.000 --> 39:07.000]  Shay, and I don't like other people wearing American flags. It's offensive to me. And then I get up here on air and I mention it, and I mean, come on, it's insane.
[39:07.000 --> 39:15.000]  It's insane. All right, I'm going to go another call that disagrees. Kiesel in Georgia who disagrees, you're on the air, Kiesel.
[39:15.000 --> 39:28.000]  Hello. So my disagreement was just a second. I understand, I agree with you as far as the motion of where the world's going, but as a resistance to try to stop it, now think about it.
[39:28.000 --> 39:35.000]  What's the world without government? There's a whole bunch of divided people divided by religion, divided by culture, divided by the way they do things in general.
[39:35.000 --> 39:49.000]  And that in itself is going to, it's going to corrode. So you're saying without this establishment, we're all just going to be better off? Because all they're doing is bringing things to a singularity.
[39:49.000 --> 40:03.000]  No, they're not. I have a choice who my government is. I am the sovereign. I elect the government. And I have a bill of rights and constitution so that if we get a corrupt government in who can fool 51% of people
[40:03.000 --> 40:12.000]  to say start arresting all the Jews like happened in Nazi Germany, I'm going to be protected because I have a republic and a democracy.
[40:12.000 --> 40:21.000]  If 51% say kill all of the Hispanics or kill all the Anglos or kill all the blacks, it happens in a pure democracy.
[40:21.000 --> 40:30.000]  So this Star Trekian meme of, oh, we're all going to be one world and one world government will stop war. That's how world government is sold.
[40:30.000 --> 40:41.000]  The problem is this world government is authoritarian and corrupt and has eugenics and world population reduction as its stated aim.
[40:41.000 --> 40:54.000]  But Alex, anything that is outside of what you want, because there's a whole bunch of eyes out there, everybody has their own opinion, anything outside of that is corrupt because you don't appeal or you don't like the way they do things.
[40:54.000 --> 41:07.000]  Okay, let me stop you again. 99% in a Gallup poll were against the banker takeover of 2008 known as the banker bailout. They got thousand to one phone calls according to Congress people against it, but it's still passed.
[41:07.000 --> 41:16.000]  See, it's not only unconstitutional and illegal and immoral to give this money to these private banks or they threaten to destroy the stock market. No one wanted it.
[41:16.000 --> 41:28.000]  So again, over 70% of Americans in major polls want more Second Amendment, not less. So you can't just say, well, that's your opinion. Okay, it's constitutional and it's what the majority want because it's common sense.
[41:28.000 --> 41:36.000]  The founders said private property, be left alone, defend yourself. Boy, that really makes sense. I agree with Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.
[41:36.000 --> 41:47.000]  I don't agree with George Soros and Bill Clinton. Okay, it's very, very simple. And so you call in and say, well, according to you, anything you don't like is evil.
[41:47.000 --> 41:58.000]  Well, the British government admits a tenfold increase in brain damage and convulsions from the H1N1 shot and under five-year-olds and have suspended the shot, not just the last shot, but any new shots.
[41:58.000 --> 42:09.000]  That's London Telegraph. Boy, I told you it was going to brain damage you. I had top scientists, brain surgeons, the head of the EU Commission on who medical doctor to tell you it was deadly.
[42:09.000 --> 42:18.000]  And six, seven, eight months later or a year later in some cases, what do you see on mainstream news? British Medical Journal saying it was all a fraud.
[42:18.000 --> 42:25.000]  I told you they were keeping the scans of your body because I could read the federal regulations. They're so arrogant they think you're dumb.
[42:25.000 --> 42:32.000]  Now they admit they're keeping the scans of your body. I told you they were taking your baby's blood at birth for a Pentagon DNA bio-weapons database.
[42:32.000 --> 42:39.000]  Now it's admitted. I mean, what's your problem with me? I mean, what is it? Pardon me?
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  Is the world peace bad?
[42:41.000 --> 42:50.000]  Well, this is not world peace. World peace to the globalist is total enslavement. See, you have problems with semantics.
[42:50.000 --> 42:57.000]  You know, if I walk up and beat you in the head with a hammer and say, this is world peace because you're my enemy and when you're dead, we're going to have peace.
[42:57.000 --> 43:21.000]  Give me a break. You got a major problem.
[43:21.000 --> 43:29.000]  3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[43:29.000 --> 43:36.000]  4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[43:36.000 --> 43:46.000]  5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.

[45:09.000 --> 45:12.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[45:12.000 --> 45:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[45:17.000 --> 45:24.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cams, now being expanded nationwide.
[45:24.000 --> 45:30.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[45:30.000 --> 45:39.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[45:39.000 --> 45:45.000]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[45:45.000 --> 45:51.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[46:53.000 --> 47:19.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[47:23.000 --> 47:28.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  It's going to be loving. It's going to give you peace.
[47:55.000 --> 48:02.000]  I'm going to put on screen the Financial Times of London article by their foreign desk editor titled,
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  And Now for World Government. And he goes on to say,
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  It's authoritarian that they've built it in secret, but that it's for our own good.
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.000]  What have all these major top environmentalists said lately?
[48:13.000 --> 48:19.000]  The public's too dumb to pass global carbon taxes. We have to do it whether they want it or not.
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.000]  And who are the carbon taxes paid to? The very same central banks that have engineered the collapse.
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  It's feudalism. It's control.
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  Remember the SPP North American Union documents that came out a few years ago?
[48:31.000 --> 48:40.000]  How the main order of business of the Canadian, U.S. and Mexican government is to keep the merger of our country secret,
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.000]  the merger of our infrastructures and our military secret from the public,
[48:44.000 --> 48:50.000]  North American integration by stealth. That's in the Council on Foreign Relations white papers as well on the subject.
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.000]  North American integration by stealth.
[48:54.000 --> 49:00.000]  See, we don't want this even though you went to college and somebody patted you on the head and said,
[49:00.000 --> 49:06.000]  You're an intellectual because big corporations fund this university and they want to set up their own global,
[49:06.000 --> 49:12.000]  unelected, unaccountable government. And then we tell you that you're liberal and trendy and smart because you want globalism.
[49:12.000 --> 49:21.000]  We've seen what globalism is. It's war and tyranny and death and the international community going around attacking defenseless nations.
[49:21.000 --> 49:28.000]  It's UN rape gangs running child slavery and white slavery operations worldwide.
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.000]  I mean, read your headlines.
[49:32.000 --> 49:37.000]  Globalization is BP bossing our government around.
[49:37.000 --> 49:42.000]  Look at Europe. The people there have unanimously voted. They don't want GMO crops.
[49:42.000 --> 49:49.000]  They don't want it. They want to decide what they're going to eat. Their government caves in through globalism and goes ahead and does it.
[49:49.000 --> 49:56.000]  So the global government that you want so dearly is being set up. In fact, here's a raw story article today.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  Study.
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.000]  IMF document illustrates plan to raise global currency.
[50:03.000 --> 50:10.000]  It's no secret that many of the world's largest industrialized nations are somewhat eager to ease their reliance on the US dollar for months.
[50:10.000 --> 50:20.000]  China and Russia have pushed ever suddenly for a new global reserve currency to give governments around the world enhanced economic stability in the event of greater fluctuations in the dollar's value.
[50:20.000 --> 50:25.000]  And it goes on that they're the IMF and World Bank are calling for a global currency run by the private banks.
[50:25.000 --> 50:45.000]  SDRs, a 35 page exploration and footnotes. The IMF strategy policy and review department lays out how and why global currency, which would move from inside money as the SDR to an outside money that is traded by governments.
[50:45.000 --> 51:02.000]  So the very global banks that want the world government and are financing the open borders, everything, they now want to issue their own currency that you must use and then have governments sign on that they lose control of their economic destiny and their monetary destiny.
[51:02.000 --> 51:15.000]  I mean, we already have had the Federal Reserve for 97 years since 1913 running our fiscal policy and giving themselves incredible power. They literally have an Aladdin's lamp of private money creation for themselves.
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  It's a fraud.
[51:18.000 --> 51:29.000]  And Kinley and Bernie Madoff and BP under Clinton came out with the idea of a global carbon tax to fund these SDRs and you think it's a great idea.
[51:29.000 --> 51:34.000]  Well, the good news is the population's been educated and they don't want it. So the globalists are trying to do it by stealth.
[51:34.000 --> 51:39.000]  So understand, I don't live under what system you want just because you're a control freak.
[51:39.000 --> 51:44.000]  All right, let's go to your calls quickly now. Rob and Mass, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[51:44.000 --> 51:52.000]  Alex, thank you again for having me on. I have a constitutional question for you regarding the federal government's lawsuit against the State of Arizona.
[51:52.000 --> 52:03.000]  Okay. My question is on the interpretation of Article 2, Section 4 of the Constitution under the executive powers regarding disqualification.
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  Well, I don't...
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  Can I read it to you to give some context?
[52:07.000 --> 52:08.000]  Sure.
[52:08.000 --> 52:20.000]  All right. As it's written, Section 4 disqualification, the President, the Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery, and other high crimes.
[52:20.000 --> 52:30.000]  And then it goes on to say, if they sue a state or a private citizen on behalf of a foreign power, it is treason. And we wrote an article about that a month ago.
[52:30.000 --> 52:39.000]  And it is treason. The federal government is not allowed to sue an individual or state or government agency on behalf of a foreign power.
[52:39.000 --> 52:48.000]  Okay. Yes, sir. Now, with that in mind, shouldn't our elected officials or our soldiers or even our people kind of see this and say, hey, wait a minute.
[52:48.000 --> 52:53.000]  They just removed themselves from office just by filing the lawsuit and going forward with it.
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  Yeah, you're talking about...
[52:54.000 --> 52:55.000]  So wouldn't everybody...
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.000]  You're talking about...
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  You're talking about...
[52:57.000 --> 53:01.000]  And by the way, those same powers are in the Ninth Amendment and Tenth Amendment.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  Yes, they are. That's right.
[53:03.000 --> 53:08.000]  But by violating Article 11, does Article 2, Section 4 apply?
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  Or it's like, wait a minute.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  These guys, they just...
[53:11.000 --> 53:15.000]  They totally kept over the first domino by suing Arizona for doing...
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.000]  But they don't care.
[53:16.000 --> 53:25.000]  We've had what? Four of the nine members of the Supreme Court, one of them has been replaced by Kagan now, write that they follow UN law.
[53:25.000 --> 53:34.000]  And if you've read the UN Declaration of Human Rights, Article 30 says that you have none of the previous rights they mentioned when the UN feels like it.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  This is a tyranny.
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  No, Rob, great points.
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  But that's the issue.
[53:40.000 --> 53:47.000]  You have global offshore corporations that individually, many of them have bigger GDPs than most governments.
[53:47.000 --> 53:55.000]  Now they're combining forces with over $100 billion in this Bill Gates Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[53:55.000 --> 54:08.000]  And in the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, most of it goes to fund globalization, international takeover of curriculum and schools, vaccines, birth control, sterilization.
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.000]  And so this global government is private.
[54:11.000 --> 54:19.000]  And so they use the hordes of illegal aliens that they've brought in that they put on welfare as their political attack dog.
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  I mean, it's very elementary.
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.000]  It's treason.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  And yes, it's...
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.000]  It's divide and conquer.
[54:23.000 --> 54:24.000]  It is.
[54:24.000 --> 54:25.000]  Yes, it is divide and conquer.
[54:25.000 --> 54:26.000]  Rob, I appreciate your call.
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Texas.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  You're on the air, Brian.
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.000]  Hey, Alex.
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  How's it going?
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.000]  Good.
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.000]  I am so thankful for what you're doing.
[54:38.000 --> 54:39.000]  God bless you.
[54:39.000 --> 54:48.000]  What I wanted to talk about was yesterday I dropped my wife off at the airport and we were already prepared for the whole naked body scanner thing.
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  I printed out your article just like you said.
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  And when we went up for the security check, I showed him to the guy.
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  I said, is she going to have to walk through one of these body scanners?
[54:57.000 --> 54:58.000]  He says, no.
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.000]  But before the end of the year, they'll be everywhere.
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.000]  And I said, not if this lawsuit passes, and he looked at me kind of strange to know what I was talking about.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  I said, do you realize the amount of radiation you're getting off of these things?
[55:10.000 --> 55:15.000]  And he just kind of put his head down into his book and just kind of ignored me, wouldn't talk to me.
[55:15.000 --> 55:21.000]  Well, I mean, if, you know, I mean, if he says core exit won't hurt him, or if he says asbestos on 9-11 won't hurt him,
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.000]  or if he says radiation won't hurt him, then I guess it won't.
[55:25.000 --> 55:26.000]  He's like Superman.
[55:26.000 --> 55:32.000]  He can, he could just magically, like a genie, say Shazam.
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  And, you know, I love genie.
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.000]  She pops up and he says, hey, genie, will you make this radiation not hurt me?
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  And she says, you bet.
[55:39.000 --> 55:45.000]  It's just so sad that even someone working there doesn't want to know the effects of what they're dealing with.
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.000]  I offered him the articles from info wars.com.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  He wouldn't even take them.
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  Well, we've got to get the word out.
[55:52.000 --> 55:59.000]  The good news is the airlines are against it because it's hurt upwards of 20% of their travel in the last year.
[55:59.000 --> 56:00.000]  There's lawsuits over it.
[56:00.000 --> 56:01.000]  I appreciate your call.
[56:01.000 --> 56:10.000]  And since you mentioned that, the TSA was in the Chicago Tribune two months ago saying yes by 2011 midyear.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  It's about a year from now.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  They said everyone will be forced through these.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  Now it's already been done in El Paso.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  The El Paso Times reported on that a month ago.
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  Kurt Nemo wrote about it earlier this week at infowars.com.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  We got listener tips that everyone was being forced through it.
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.000]  He searched the term and found out Shazam.
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.000]  I'm going to get addicted to saying that now, like Gullmer Pyle, that there it is.
[56:34.000 --> 56:39.000]  And they're making everybody there as a test here in Texas do that.
[56:39.000 --> 56:46.000]  And I have the New York Times here today, radiation questions over a body scanner.
[56:46.000 --> 56:51.000]  But it goes in about two years and what I've read in federal documents is about a year now.
[56:51.000 --> 56:58.000]  If all goes according to plans, they will replace all of the lie detectors with it.
[56:58.000 --> 57:07.000]  And everyone will be forced at 2,200 security checkpoints at all commercial 450 airports in the United States.
[57:07.000 --> 57:17.000]  So it's gone in about 215 within another year and a half, they say two years, 450, 2,200 checkpoints total.
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  You will be forced to have your body recorded naked to be bathed in radiation and they do save it.
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  And they're a pack of criminal liars. Why shouldn't they?
[57:25.000 --> 57:28.000]  They already take your baby's blood for 38 years at birth, give it to the Pentagon,
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.000]  and then they pat your blood and sell it to private companies when you go in for gene therapy.
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  They say, by the way, we've already got your blood. That's how all this came out.
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.000]  So they're stealing your blood, they're stealing naked images of your body.
[57:38.000 --> 57:44.000]  It's a criminal rogue government that works for offshore banks setting up a world government to enforce the rape of everyone.
[57:44.000 --> 58:06.000]  We'll be back in a moment. Stay with us.
[58:14.000 --> 58:21.000]  We'll be back in a moment.
[58:44.000 --> 58:50.000]  Subscribe to The Trends Journal. This information is too important to wait.
[59:15.000 --> 59:19.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[59:22.000 --> 59:26.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[59:26.000 --> 59:31.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[59:31.000 --> 59:36.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[59:36.000 --> 59:42.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[59:42.000 --> 59:51.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[59:51.000 --> 01:00:00.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers?
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  All right, hour number two, continuing with your phone calls.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  We've got a bunch of economic news, health news, global government news, attacks on free speech, and the internet information all coming up.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  But let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  Brian, we just talked to him. Let's talk to Michelle in Maryland. You're on the air, Michelle.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  Hi, Alex. I hope my two points fall in line with what you're discussing today.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  But I disagree with how the government are treating the 9-11 workers, and I agree with your feelings towards this topic.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  I work at a very prominent hospital as a nurse in Baltimore, and had to take care of one of the members of either the Bilderberg
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  or the trilateral commission group. Not sure which one, but this member asked me what exactly is it that I do.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  And I said, I'm a nurse considered a professional and a validated profession.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  Went to college for four years, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  And this member told me, quote, no, you're a skilled laborer, but that's all you are.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  You're skilled at taking care of people like me, end quote.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  And I didn't realize until many years later, after listening to him tell-
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  No, no, that's their religion is to tell you you're scum, and only their opinions matter, and they are your God.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  At Bilderberg group meetings, the staff is not allowed to look them in the eyes. That's admitted.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  I mean, you're scum. You're there to serve them.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  Right, right. And anyway, well, I'm planning on helping the rescue workers from 9-11 sometime early next year
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  by providing free medical services and free medications by using some of my own money and through some volunteer efforts
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  of other nurses and nurse practitioners from the Northeast.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  So instead of giving into commercialism and buying a luxury car or a house I can't afford,
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  I really want to help those who risk their lives for the people like us.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  Well, Michelle, it's going to be people like you with the loving things they do individually that save humanity.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  But according to the government, those firefighters and police and military people and medical workers,
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  they're just fine. Doesn't matter how many university medical centers scan their lungs.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  Doesn't matter how many die. Doesn't matter how many get lung cancer.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  I mean, the government just says it doesn't exist.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  But it does. It does. So, but thank you so much for having me on your show. Thank you.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  Well, Michelle, keep it up. And do you have a website or something?
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  It's not up and running yet, but I'll definitely give that information to you when it is.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  What do you think of Congress blocking almost nine years later medical aid to them?
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  You know, I hear all the patients talking about they know they know what's going on.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  But, you know, I mean, it just takes efforts of people, you know, that like you and I and, you know,
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  we just have to really keep trying to do what we can.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Well, think about all the carnage from what's going to happen with the Gulf cleanup.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  I mean, it is going to dwarf all the deaths with Exxon Valdez.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  But the government will just say again, we want world government, but it doesn't exist.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  We're taking your baby's blood, but it doesn't exist. We're putting mercury in the shots that brain damage you.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  But it's good for you. I appreciate your call. Good points, Michelle.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  Let's talk to Ryan in Pennsylvania. Ryan, you're on the air.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  Hey, buddy, got about a minute and a half. Go ahead.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  I was just reading on the Internet a little bit ago about how it's illegal to videotape police officers now in 12 states.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  I wanted to see what you thought about that.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  You know, the courts are beginning to rule on this and they're saying the police are misapplying wiretapping,
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  where you tap into somebody's phone or sneak into their house at night and videotape them.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  That's illegal. But in a public place, there's not the perception of privacy.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  So how can the government videotape us from the polls?
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  But then you videotape cops 200 yards away and they come over and arrest you.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  They're just trying to intimidate the public in 12 states to not videotape them.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  It's more lawless, corrupt government thuggery.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  They can pull you over and have a dash cam rolling without your consent.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  Yeah, they're just trying to set the precedent to intimidate everybody.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  They know full well it's not illegal, but they can still get a grand jury to videotape your butt.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  You're an uppity blood bag that's trying to actually stand up and say you have rights.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  You're here to supply blood to the government.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  Okay, how dare you? They're going to videotape you. You're not going to videotape them.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  They're going to arrest you for petty infractions, but not the illegal aliens,
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  because they're on the government team. They're on the team.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  How can they do that? Like so many people, they're like public figures out in public,
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  on the public streets and everything.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  Because it's a lawless, scumbag, criminal, filth-run government that thinks it can tell you what to do.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  You're back.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  We are into hour number two of this August 8th, 2010, Sunday transmission. I'll be back live tomorrow.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  11 a.m. Central Live, infowars.com and prismplanet.com are the websites.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  Don't forget we have the free iPhone app. We also have a link to a free Android app.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  It's free, and you can get the podcast links to the audio streams at infowars.com.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  And even if you don't have an iPhone or iPad, you can send the free app to your friends and family that do.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  There's also the free download link for the podcast for any computer at infowars.com.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  And we're gaining about three stations a week.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  So the broadcast, we've actually a couple of weeks, we had five stations in one week,
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  picking up the weekday show and the weekend show. Very thankful to all those new affiliates.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  Look, we're being trained to submit. The establishment social psych warfare engineers are trying to break our will.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  They come out and admit we're taking your baby's blood for the Pentagon at birth.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  Nothing you're going to do to stop it. There's no law. We just do it.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  We're going to put you through naked body scanners and save the images and bathe you in radiation.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  We're just going to do it. We're going to give 30 million illegal aliens free healthcare and let them have their babies here for free.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  And citizens have to pay for the baby. But when you have a baby as a citizen, you've got to pay.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  That's just the way it is. And we're going to set up a world government and new global private currency run by private banks that have engineered the collapse.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  And that's just the way it is. And in 12 states and even CNN and ABC are saying this isn't legal.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  In 12 states, they're arresting people. If you videotape cops 150 yards away beating somebody up and then you put it on YouTube, they come and arrest you.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  If you videotape cops shooting somebody in the back, they come and arrest you.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  If you videotape cops in your own house, they arrest you.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  If you're riding down the road with a motorcycle on your helmet, with a motorcycle on your helmet, riding down the road with a motorcycle with a camera on your helmet in one of the more famous cases,
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  and the cops pull you over and arrest you for, I mean, this is what America is.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  They're going to videotape you. They're going to face scan you. They're going to record your genitals.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  They're going to put cameras up and say, well, you have no reasonable perception of privacy in public, which is true, but we run the government.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  We should decide whether we want the government watching us with cameras.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  But then they come and arrest you for videotaping them.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  It's just all part of the government saying, we're God. This is the way it is. Put up with it.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  What did AP and Bloomberg report in the last week and a half?
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  There was a 15-page article at Bloomberg last week that I marveled at here on air where it mentioned that every major insurance company has had the feds change the regulations, not the laws,
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  but the regulations where they keep the dead vets' death benefits that their widows have taken out on them, that their wives have taken out of their husbands,
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  and 400,000, 500,000, a million, it gave different cases. And the government says, well, it's legal now. We made it legal.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  We're making it legal to take your pension funds. We're making it legal to take your social security.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  We're making it legal to keep your insurance money. They're just seeing what they can get away with.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  It's criminal. It's wrong. The government went rogue. It happens in every other case in every other nation in history.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  It's happening here, and it's big, and it's bad. They've set up a tyranny where they brag that they want to get away with it, and they've tried to study us scientifically.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  I mean, this is serious, and they give little psychological cover stories to their enforcers and minions.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  Just like I told you a decade ago, this whole war on terror, even pre-911, had nothing to do with men in caves, and now we have the internal documents,
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  and it's all for gun owners, landowners, conservatives, libertarians. All right, let's go quickly to your calls.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  Let's go to Andrew, who disagrees. Then we're going to Lance, Forrest, and many others. You're on the air, Andrew.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  Hey, Alex. I've been a long-time listener. Over the past year, I've really become disgusted with a lot of the things he's saying, do.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  I made a list of things, actually, if you'll give me just one minute to go through it. I know you like to cut people off, and I'll let them finish.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  Well, no, I will cut you off. Hold on a minute. I will cut you off if something you say I said isn't true or is spun, and I will counter each of your points.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  But if you actually answer my questions, I'll keep you on. Go ahead.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  Okay, let's start with this. I take real issue with the fact that you say you predicted 9-11.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  It's clear to anyone who can go and look for themselves that Bill Cooper predicted 9-11 one month before you did.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  Do you want to respond or do you want me to just...
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  Yeah, no. I mean, I'll respond to that. I mean, Bill Cooper was somebody on, like, a 5,000-watt shortwave station, and I have heard clips of him saying they're hyping bin Laden, they're going to stage something with him.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  I specifically said blow up the World Trade Center towers because I knew the feds had bombed it before.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  The point is, I didn't hear him say that. I saw the media coming out and saying Al Qaeda is going to attack you, give up all of your rights when this happens.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  I read, sir, a year before 9-11, two years before 9-11, all I talked about was government-sponsored terror because it was obvious.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  I saw the Rand Corporation say about a year before 9-11 that there's going to be terror attacks and we're going to take the American people's rights.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  Then they had the dark winter drill about eight months before 9-11, practicing martial law.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  I mean, this is what Patriot Radio covers. So, of course, other people could see the clear programming.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  Okay, now let's go to your next point. Go ahead.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  Okay, my next point is, you had Bill Cooper on your show one time.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  Hold on just a minute. Hold on just a minute. Hold on a minute.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  This is all about Patriot mythology infighting stuff. That's not what I do on my broadcast, okay?
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  And I know what you're going to say. You're going to say, you had Bill Cooper on and you said that you let him go because he was cussing.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  And then people go listen to the radio interview and they don't hear cussing and I appreciate your call. Have a good day.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  I'm not going to sit here and talk about some dead guy on my show, okay?
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  Who talked about flying submarines and flying saucers and I've got his book, which I hadn't read just a few years ago.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  I mean, I remember somebody gave it to me about 12-14 years ago and I just looked at it and as soon as I only read part of it,
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  as soon as it said that he'd seen video that space aliens shot. I mean, this is in there.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  Every time I mention this, people say I'm making this up. No, he said video that aliens shot of Jesus being crucified.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  Okay? I'm not a UFO guy. He's a UFO guy. And people try to create this fake thing like there's some issue with me and him, okay?
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  All right? I mean, literally, he put out an email saying the IRS is surrounding me. I need your help.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  I called him and said, I'd like to have you on and he said, you're that, you know, bleeping such and such.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  You know how smart I am. And I thought, man, this guy was well known for constantly cussing on the air everywhere.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  And I got him on and we had 15-second delay that was on 98.9 FM at the time, talk radio.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  And I was on there. I can't believe we're talking about this. They're putting poison in the water.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  They're trying to start war with Iran. And I say, if you disagree, one guy calls in and says he's for world government and I'm back as I'm not for it.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  Another guy's for anchor babies and tries to imply I'm un-Christian because I don't want to give free healthcare to all the illegal aliens and make them citizens.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  They have the babies here. And then you call in because, because I don't cover people that supposedly videotape Jesus being crucified.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  I mean, he said it was a hologram of aliens filming it. That's the wrong show, sir. It's the wrong show.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  I'd probably heard Bill two or three times. People send me cassette tapes talking about space aliens.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  I don't cover space aliens. I didn't even cover space aliens last week whenever Churchill put it up on screen.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  Now they've released all these memos where he was saying society will collapse. The aliens are real. What are we going to do?
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  I guess I've got to start covering it. I mean, maybe he did see a hologram of aliens filming Jesus.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  I mean, I don't know. Wrong show. Wrong show. I mean, maybe, maybe, maybe I'm wrong.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  Maybe it's normal to say he saw flying submarines. Okay. Yeah, Churchill ordered UFO cover-ups, documents suggest.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  And I do get a lot of criticism for not covering UFOs here because I can't get people to admit that they're in the process of killing the free internet as we know it.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  I can't get people to read what's in the Cybersecurity Act. I can't get people to read what's in the Patriot Act and that it's written for the American people,
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  not for foreign terrorists. I mean, I can't get people to admit that Bicephena LA gives you cancer and sterilizes you even when the government admits it.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  I mean, here's one. This is out of natural news. HFCS, the poison that promotes obesity and liver damage.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  Two new studies have added more reason and concern of high fructose corn syrup cases significantly more harm the body than the mere sugar content.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  And it goes on. Major University reports published in Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior Researchers at Princeton University causes obesity and massive cancer.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  Now, that's news and that's what we cover, not holograms of aliens and Jesus. You got the wrong show, pal. We'll be right back.

[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner. So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  Somebody is going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising. We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising. A new tool in the Info War, Don't Tread on Me. Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:09.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  We are back live for those that heard me talking about HFCS in report after report by prestigious universities and they knew this 50, 60 years ago.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  Stimulates cancer growth and once you have cancer, accelerates the growth of that cancer.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  Now, this is in tens of thousands of products. It's deadly. If you look at Americans diets, it was just as bad 20, 30 years ago, but look at how diabetes and cancer are just growing off the charts.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  Diabetes has had almost a 3,000% increase in the last 20 years. It's the high fructose corn syrup.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  That is something you can take out of your diet and demand that food producers take out or you won't buy what they're selling.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  And those major university reports are up on infowars.com right now. I suggest you get it out to everybody you know and do something productive.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  It is not productive to sit here and talk about flying saucers. Though it is pretty amazing. Here's Fox News.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  Churchill ordered UFO cover-up documents suggest. I almost covered this last week, but I really think the government is just getting us ready for fake alien invasions.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  That's in the Iron Mountain report and Project Bluebeam. We know that the government has. That's been declassified.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  Talked about having a fake alien invasion as a way to unify the planet for world government. That's the real conspiracy here.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  I mean, are aliens visiting the earth? Maybe. Maybe. I mean, I just can't prove it, so I don't get into it.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  But before I go back to your calls, we had a special for two and a half weeks that was very popular.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  By one copy of my film, The Obama Deception, which covers the whole globalist banking takeover and how to stop them, and get three copies free.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  Or by two copies, get eight free. That special is now over. You can still get the film at infowars.com on the online video bookstore shopping cart.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  But Invisible Empire, a new order defined, our latest big-budget film, Jason Burmese directed it. I produced it.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  It's a new order on trial, their history, their operations. Very well done, very powerful. Buy one, get three free. Buy two, get eight free.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  That's going to be over in two weeks. Follow the Republic, part two of The Obama Deception. This is over two-hour film. Buy one, get three free.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  Same thing with police state for the rise of FEMA. This covers the entire police state takeover grid, the stage terror, how the underwear bomber was staged,
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  how the Christmas Day bombing was staged. Incredible information. The naked body scanners are covered by one. Get three free by two.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  Get eight free. Give them to your friends and family and support the broadcast infowars.com.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  Okay, let's hurry now to your phone calls. I'm really disappointed the people that have called in and said they disagree.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  You know, I don't like World Government, so I'm bad. I don't like open borders and anchor babies and having to pay for it. I'm bad.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  And the person's gotten mad at me lately for stuff that supposedly went on 10 years ago. Let's go ahead and talk to Lance in Texas.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  Lance, you're on the air.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  Hey, Alex, a prison planning member watching you here today. You look good. I hope you're having a good day.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  I think you're right about not being a UFO show because it's too hard to get people to believe that kind of stuff, even though there's stuff like Project Bluebeam and stuff like that.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:47.000]  Yeah, the only thing I can prove about UFOs is that the British and U.S. government have an admitted plan to tell people aliens are real to get the public to submit to whatever the government says.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  All right. Okay, so real quick, did you cover last year July 31st, 09, LE09? FEMA took over Brian, Texas, and there was a chemical plant fire?
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  No, I didn't, but I know that during NLE09, we can search NLE09, the top link is FEMA, admitting they worked with 14 foreign nations to quote, take on domestic terrorists and many of the drills that happened all over the country.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  They simulated fighting disgruntled veterans and gun owners. So that's confirmed. Just two months ago or a month ago, the guys went to Chicago and videotaped urban warfare takeover drills with foreign troops training to arrest the American people.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  But no, tell me what happened in Brian, Texas.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  Well, there was a chemical plant fire there where they evacuated like 50,000 people and FEMA just happened to be there the day before.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  Well, I know this. 12 years ago in 1998, they had a fake nuclear spill in Kyle, south of Austin, and I drove down there and found that it was fake and went on the radio and said it was fake.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  And then the media two days later said it was fake. So they claimed that radiation had been released in Kyle and none of it was true.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  And then a few months later, they had a fake bio weapon release at state police headquarters in north Austin. And it turned out that was fake as well.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  Right. The toxic sky that maybe I just saw about chemtrails. They've got demonizing militias. The militias having a meeting.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  He tells the guy, hey, you look at that website. I told you possibly, you know, demonizing info wars.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  Big Pharma is actually the ones that take over the jet fuel.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  So basically they're coming out and just saying everything that we know is true is right here in front of your face in this movie.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  And in profit here on YouTube has a video where the ROV it braces its arm down on the floor right after he starts recording right after the alarm goes off.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  And he says that, you know, the ocean floor rises up and then it just drops out.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  Like, I don't know if they're putting off nukes down there, but the day before that there was a 3.0 earthquake in New Orleans, Louisiana.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  Well, the United States, Israel and others admit that they do have earthquake systems using nukes that are undetectable.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  They can trigger them on key fault lines. I appreciate your call, Lance.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  Forrest in West Virginia, you're on the air. Forrest.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  Howdy, Alex. Yeah, the reason I'm calling is I want to talk to you about running for president of the United States of America in 2012.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  It'll be unlike any other campaign where it'll be radically honest. And from the get-go, you're going to say that the president is not going to save America, how presidents are corrected, not directed.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  And just the whole campaign will be about educating people about 9th and 10th Amendment taking the states back.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  Hold on, hold on, hold on. Who are you saying you want to run for president?
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  And then while you're running, you would have a venture, a watch and a bonus. George Humphrey.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  Are you saying I should run for president? Yes.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  But it'll be unlike any other campaign where you'll be radically honest.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  You'll say, hey, a president isn't going to save this country. It's all about states, rights, cities, rights.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  Well, here's the deal. I mean, here's the deal. I would support Chuck Baldwin for the Constitution Party to use it as a platform for education.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  Ron Paul, as a Republican, I'll be supporting. He's going to be running unless he has any health problems, which thank God he doesn't right now.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  Very healthy. And my job is to make films and have the radio show and do what I'm doing here.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  So I plan to never run for office, but if I did, I would run for Congress first. I am old enough now to run for president. I'm 36, got to be 35.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  But I'm not saying it isn't good to run for president because you can use it as a bully pulpit.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  Look at the movement Ron Paul helped build that's really been foundational for the awakening that's happening now.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  But far as I'm flattered, you and a lot of other people have created websites for me to run for president in 2012.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  I just, I don't think that's the way to go. I mean, it would be good for me individually as a publicity stunt.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  But you know what, I don't, it's kind of scary being as prominent as I already am. Anything else, Forest?
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  Oh, yeah. Jason Burma is going to have another radio show and I was talking to him on this radio show before it went off the air.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  I was talking about being a guest on Coast to Coast AM.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  Jason's been here before and made one film and then gone back to New York and then he was always planning to go back.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  So he was just doing that while he was here. People ask, where's Jason?
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  He announced on the show that he was going back to New York.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  So no, he won't be doing a show here at least in the near future. But I appreciate your call.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  Okay, Andrew, Louis, Adam, Julio, Ty, Ernie, your calls are coming up.

[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:24.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.

[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:09.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  We're live. It's Sunday, the 8th of August, 2010, or your phone call is coming up. We've got two segments left.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  We had Bob Chapman on three weeks ago, and then again Friday, a great financial analyst, and he said, look for next week, the Federal Reserve to admit what the media has already been forced to admit, that we never left the recession and that we're really building into a depression.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:54.000]  Well, they should know they designed it. And of course, their answer will be allowing them to monetize trillions of dollars more of U.S. securities.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  U.S. T-bills and other instruments, basically a form of derivative, just flooding the market, devaluing the dollar further.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  Well, here's the Financial Times of London today. Fed set a downgrade outlook for U.S.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  And of course, the Chinese major brokerage houses and analysts have downgraded the United States and Europe, and are saying that we're no longer AAA rated. That means the banks will get even higher interest when the government borrows from them to be able to create new money.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  Of course, before 1913, the government just issued the currency. That's what the Constitution says the Congress is supposed to do, but we let private bankers do whatever they want and do it secretly.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  The Federal Reserve is set to downgrade its assessment of U.S. economic prospects when it meets on Tuesday to discuss ways to reboot the flagging economy, when their own policy is to destroy the economy.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  That's what NAFTA and GAD are. Faced with the weak economic data and rising fears of double-dip recession, the Federal Open Market Committee is likely to ensure its policy is not constraining growth and to use the statement to signal greater concern about the economy.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  It is, however, unlikely to agree on big new steps to boost growth. And its measures are exactly what Bob Chapman said they would be, just giving themselves more money to corner the market further.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  I want to go to your calls, but first, in the last week we did two special videos that we posted at prisonplanet.tv in the highest quality, but also for everybody at my Alex Jones YouTube channel that has over 60 million views, or right at 60 million views, one of our eight channels, 150 million plus views total,
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  showing the success we're having. These last two videos, one has had 400,000 views, the other right at 200,000 views. It needs to be a lot more than that. And it's a major health announcement.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  And of course, I put this video out food the ultimate secret exposed 15 minute video about a week and a half ago. The last week we've seen two new videos that we've also posted on the subject, one of them brain eating viruses, because that's what these behavior viruses do.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  They want to inject you with a vaccine that quote makes it where you can't get angry anymore, blocking the receptors in the brain that would absorb hormones associated with aggression and stress and resistance.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  And that's what sodium fluoride and bisphenol A and all the rest of these chemicals admittedly do. And now they're admitting all over the news, all these big studies that, of course, just add them to the stack that high fructose corn syrup is brain damaging you, causing cancer,
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  destroying your pancreas. It's all in these videos. So please go watch them.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  Media pushes brain eating vaccines is one and food the ultimate secret exposed is the other video. Very important information. All right, let's move fast now. Andrew in New York, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  Hey, let's have a caller eight month listener. Welcome.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  God bless you, sir. Welcome.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  Okay, we have remember you talked about the Google horizon backdoor side door deal. And now it's with the SEC, of course, we have a quadruple.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  It's like, you know, like we get attacked from like four sides. You got the cyber security bill, which was passed by the mobile bomb of course. Then you have some steam coming from the back door. You got was calling the end of the speech.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  You got the FBI and I say CIA from the other doors side door. Now you got the Google horizon at the other door. So this is the quadruple hostage.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  And they admit they're just they admit they're going to block off most of the web, most of the websites, and you'll just be able to go to select sites. And this is mainstream news this weekend. I covered it earlier.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  AP is reporting ABC and the Huffington Post. Here's one of the headlines. Google horizon deal the end of the internet as we know it. And it breaks it down. Go ahead.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  Yeah, and I covered that two days earlier. It was on Friday, believe it or not. It was actually it was written Friday night. So it and then it was all like on NBC News.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  But they kind of spent it to make it look like it was looking good. And then you got the big mega corporations that control the infrastructure in the hubs.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  And they say that only select corporations that pay them will be basically accessible. That's where all this is going.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  Yes. And then and then I covered it all day Friday. And then I had a big article, which was your feature links, including the Obama discussion, like Google, of course.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  And you got the gas and flag removed of our Facebook and all that will copy P if I'm not mistaken.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  And then then all that. And then I featured two articles from Huffington and information lead to basically tie it in all together. Welcome to fashion some attack on the First Amendment.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  And then also what I covered this. This is just coming out of Bloomberg right now. I'm reading this. China with sacrifice and growth as energy could slow factory production.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  Remember what my father said that China is going to collapse in seven to 10 months?
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  Yes.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  I think it's going to happen faster than you think.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  Okay, well, Andrew, it sounds like you have an interesting website. What's the address?
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  Well, I don't have a website. It's like I have one of these biggest Facebook pages in New York City. It's like, and I tend to be saying that you had the gas and flag removed off of your Facebook as well.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  Well, no, but I saw that is like all over the news.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  No, no, that happened to us. They said this flag used by the founding fathers is evil. Andrew, I appreciate your call. Lewis in Ohio, Lewis, you're on the air.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  Hello, Alex. I'm a first time caller and who got through on his first attempt. I've been listening to you for about a year. And in that time, I've come to understand what a true constitutionally based patriot is all about and the tyranny that's going on.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  So thank you very much. Thank you for enlightening me. And I have an idea for us all. It might help in exposing stupidity and tyranny.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  Well, I recall listening to your show a few days ago and you were talking about how you coined the word. You said Obama Tron. I like Obama time. But why not get all of your listeners to start using either either trying or time whatever it is you decide which is best.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  And by doing this,
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  What word did I say I coined because I'm not remembering this.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  I think you said Obama Tron. And I like Obama time. But the point is that Will Smith, the individual, he's a movie star, a rapper, he put a new word in the English language.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  I'm getting jiggy. It took about 10 years. So why not have a new word that describes people who continually elect politicians who lie, cheat and steal from them.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  I think they have a word. I think it's called schmucks. Right. But if you use Obama time, then this to me would kind of like what people love. They would immediately grab on to it. You're talking about Obama, the president of the United States of America.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  I mean, you're using his name there. But that's just something that I thought might serve. You know, like you did with telling all the people to internet search catwater with 60 million people were to start using the word Obama time to describe fools who continually elect tyrants.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  It might start people that think, you know, what's going on here. I don't remember the word I coined. You may have misheard me. You're saying Obama timed Obama time.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  Yes, Obama trans or Obama times. Yes, I don't know if I coined Obama time, but I don't remember. But I think I've heard others use that Obama time would mean like a mindless robot. So that's an interesting idea.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  Lewis, I appreciate your call. Very interesting. All right, I'm going to try to just blitz through calls. Adam, Julio, Ty, Ernie, Mike, Gary, Lisa, Chuck, Jared. I'm going to try to jam in one call a minute in this final segment coming up.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  All the other news and info we didn't get to is up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. And we couldn't do any of this without you, the great listeners taking action. That's why the establishment is now moving to try to curtail and shut down freedom on the web because we're kicking their butt.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap, not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company, a family owned and operated American company.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  My family, staff, friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  There is nothing like these factory direct big money saving triple concentrated soaps anywhere. Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.

[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business? I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain. Call us at 1-800-340-7091.

[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  Number five, a solar powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information. The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.

[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  I am a political atheist to use the term that Gerald Salente coined. By the way, he's on with us tomorrow or is it Tuesday?
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  Tomorrow. Got some other big guests throughout the week. I'll just leave it at that. Some surprise info.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  And I just go research the facts and see what the globalists are actually saying in their white papers and I gauge that through a historical lens and then I come and talk about it on air.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  I'm not a Republican. I'm not a Democrat. I'm a truth teller, a freedom lover, someone who wants to be free and for my family to be free and for you to be free.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  And I'm against whatever the unelected New World Order is up to from A to Z. Now let's take nine phone calls in the last ten minutes.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  Adam in Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  Hey Alex, this is Adam in Virginia calling. There was a show on CNN last night called Toxic America. Have you heard anything about it? Have you seen that by stream?
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  No.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  Okay. You know how you always play that clip of the mercury, how it's good for your brain and all that, that clip? Well, I got another clip. This one was about BPA.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  And the lady was basically saying that it's great. There's nothing wrong with it and the FDA approved it and they say it's okay.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  So wait a minute, wait a minute. The FDA came out last week and said that we shouldn't have approved this and it is causing cancer, bisphenol A. You're telling me CNN said it was good.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  Yeah, if you go on YouTube and you just put in Toxic Space America Space Wheel and her name is W-H-E-L-A-N. It's the first link on YouTube. It's six minutes long.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  And it's a debate between Sanjay Gupta. There's the doctor in stage and the doctor on the TV. And that's the one who is saying about BPA being good, basically.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  Now wait a minute. This is what's in the lining of many soft drinks, fruit packages, meat packages, four states of bandit.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  I mean, it's admittedly, it's in 40% of the companies that have printer ink when you get a receipt. Just a little bit of it can really reduce your fertility and give you cancer.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  This is 100%. They admit it and they're saying it's good. Now, what's the name of the YouTube video again? Because I want to pull this up.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  Okay. The actual clip name is Dr. Elizabeth Whelan discussing children's health and environmental on CNN. But that's too long.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  So if you just, if you just YouTube... No, no, we'll pull it up. Dr. Elizabeth Whelan. I'll get Matt Ryan pulling double duty in here on Sunday to post the YouTube video up at infowars.com by about 10 minutes after the show.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  I appreciate your call, Adam. Great point. Hoolio in Illinois. Welcome.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  Alex Jones, I love you and I love all the Info Warriors continuously spreading the truth throughout the world. God bless you all. Quickly, t-shirt idea and another idea.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  Number one, freedom movement. And on the back, unlock the Pandora's box called themindinfowars.com. As you mentioned, you talked about Cass Sunstein and his ridiculous white paper conspiracy theories.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  I'm for certain that they have COINTELPRO infiltrating the Tea Party. Forget the Tea Party.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  As Martin Luther King said, we are here to collect a debt. That debt is our freedom. Think about that idea, the freedom movement, a t-shirt.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  Secondly, I'm proud of the poison tap water Google search term. I got my girlfriend to switch to Tom's of Maine fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  Everyone needs to do that. It's unbelievable toothpaste. It's like $4 or whatever. It's the best.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  We did make poison tap water the number one search on Google. Great job, listeners. Hoolio got a jump. Great job. It's one person at a time. We're going to save here.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  I'm getting the word out. Keep it up. Ty in New York. You're on the air.
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Quick question slash comment. During the Continental Congress, as you well know, there were people for war with the Empire or England, and there were people against war with the Empire and England.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  What I was interested in is, we know and hear daily from you and other people who are enlightened about these things, but they're obviously trying to crush us.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  They're trying to kill us. This is over. There is nothing really hidden about it. And just like on a micro level, if someone comes to you and wants to attack or assault your person, you have to defend yourself.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  So my question is, when or how much do we take before we map the force of our own? And I don't say this in terms of violence, but again, in the sense of civil disobedience as an MLK type of march, a Gandhi type sit-in.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  Well, we are being assaulted by the fluoride, the bisphenol, the GMO, the corn syrup, and we have a right to go to our cities and say, listen, you can sit there and giggle you little crook to whatever mayor it is.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  But we've got all the major top scientists, all of them, from the EPA coming out in the last decade saying take it out, you know, the fluoride.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  And we need to get really aggressive about this because we are being assaulted financially by the bankers. We are being assaulted by NAFTA and GATT. We are being assaulted by the police state.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  And it's time to get angry. And, you know, the awakening is happening now, Ty. I appreciate your call. Ernie in Nebraska. Ernie, you're on the air.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  Hey, Alex. I love what's going on. I've handed out probably a thousand copies of various DVDs. I've got a couple things for you.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  One, you say everybody has a blind spot in certain areas. And I believe I know what your blind spot is.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  I'm going to send you a PowerPoint slideshow that will give you 150 years of history, law, federal code, case law, the whole bit which will open up your eyes to the blind spot.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  What is my blind spot?
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  Your blind spot. You keep saying that our government has been taken over by corporations. When the fact is, according to the law and history, our government has not been taken over, it is a corporation.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  And you are seeing it simply an asset of the corporation. It goes from God, God created sovereign man, man created the state, states created the federal government. How can the created have power over the creator?
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  They've created a corporation which then created other entities. Anyway, this slideshow will give you the history of it.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  Now, Larry Becraft has said, oh, this is, you know, patriot mythology, but he never gives any legal basis for it. And one of the things is he's an attorney.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  No attorney will challenge this and get you to think outside the box.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  Okay, I'll look into it, Ernie. I'll look into it. I appreciate your call. Mike in California, you're on the air.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  Thanks, Al. I just wanted to ask you a constitutional question. Article 1, Section 8, seems to limit the power of Congress to the district, which is Washington, D.C., and any property purchased from the states with the states consent.
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  Outside of that, it doesn't seem to have any authority whatsoever. What do you think?
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  I agree with you, and that's why major states are now threatening to take national parks back from the feds, and major states are also saying like Nevada and Utah and others where upwards of 90% in those states is federal controlled and owned.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  The states have the power to stake a claim and take it back and then sell it at very reduced prices to fund themselves and fund the state government.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  And so we need to move in this direction.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  I appreciate that. It just seems funny that Congress has all this authority when the Constitution doesn't give it to them.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  No, exactly. We have to stand up and say, you're out of line. You're not allowed to take our babies' blood secretly at birth for a Pentagon database.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  You're not allowed to bathe us in radiation and record our naked bodies and save it. You're not allowed to violate the Bill of Rights of Constitution. Here it is.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  U.S. national parks face sale. Governor Wyoming threatens to sell chunk of Grand Teton.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  Didn't know you could say that on the radio.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  Unless White House boosts states' education budget.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  That's an attempt at a pun or a joke, folks. Didn't know you could say that on the radio, Grand Teton.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  That says in French. Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California. Mike, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  We just went to Mike. Sorry. Gary in Washington, D.C. Go ahead.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  Alex, how are you today?
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  Good, sir.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  Listen, in the one minute we have, I think we agree on a lot of stuff. You've said that there are secret societies that are not so secret anymore.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  The Illuminati, Skull and Bones, the Luciferians, the Knights of Templar. You've said there's the Bohemian Grove, the Bilderberg Group, the Club of Rome, the United Nations, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the G20 Summit, all working together.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  And there's also Moffias. There's the Italian Moffia, the Jewish Moffia, the Japanese Moffia, the Chinese Moffia, the dimensioned Jewish Moffia.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  There's different other Asian gangs. I mean, that's all government is, is a collection of Moffias.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  But here's the thing, Alex. We're talking about the richest, most powerful people in the world, a very small group.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  Many of them are hitting their 80s, looking for ways to outlive their normal life span. While they poison the water, they poison the air, they poison the vaccines.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  And here's my question for you, Alex. One, it's a three-part question.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  One, what is wrong with the frog that is starting to boil in the water right now, having a million-man march with our arms that we are allowed to bear in this city in Washington, D.C.?
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  The problem is, the feds would stage a bombing and blame it on us. But we have had peaceful marches, and that's an old-fashioned way of getting media attention.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  How about we have a march on the Internet, a march on talk radio, a march on our local state houses, instead of focusing just on Washington, take the states back with nullification under the 9th and 10th Amendment to block the feds.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  I'm out of time, Gary and Lisa and Chuck and Jared and Moses. I'll try to get to you tomorrow, so 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central Standard Time with the live broadcast.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  If you don't have a local AM and FM in your area, call local stations. A lot of them are picking us up.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  And the station owners keep saying, hey, I heard you 10 years ago. I thought you were a cook. Everything you talked about has come true.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  And you get good ratings. We're going to put you on the air. You can also listen at infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv, XM carries part of the weekday show.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  And of course, you can also listen on Global Shortwave. That's all listed at infowars.com. I want to say great job to the crew.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  Whatever you do, take on tyranny in little ways every day. We're going to beat these people.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  Have we got a republic or a monarchy? A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  So they think they own our land. They think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  We have the facts. We have the constitution. We have the Bill of Rights. We have common law.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me,
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  Rise of the Republic. Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
