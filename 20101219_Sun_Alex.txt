[00:00.000 --> 00:16.560]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:16.560 --> 00:24.040]  Thank you for joining us, the 19th day of December 2010, we're going to have a jam-packed
[00:24.040 --> 00:31.520]  Transmission for you on this Sunday. Coming up we have Senator Elect, soon to be the actual
[00:31.520 --> 00:37.480]  Senator here in just a few weeks, Rand Paul joining us, then former Congressman Bob Barr
[00:37.480 --> 00:43.840]  weighs in on the growing police state and the TSA groping expanding all over the country.
[00:43.840 --> 00:49.040]  And of course you know the TSA has now started groping on the highways, the bus terminals
[00:49.040 --> 00:54.120]  and they're making millions of union workers get a Homeland Security authorization to even
[00:54.120 --> 00:58.720]  have a job, get to file an application, not to work for the government but to have a job
[00:58.720 --> 01:03.920]  period in a union as they seize control of the infrastructure and then Dr. Mercola on
[01:03.920 --> 01:08.120]  all the poisons in our environment and ways to protect yourself from it, he's coming
[01:08.120 --> 01:16.760]  up in the second hour today, again it is the 19th day of December 2010, our next to last
[01:16.760 --> 01:23.680]  Sunday broadcast of the year, I guess next week's, yeah I'll be the last of the year,
[01:23.680 --> 01:28.520]  so again I appreciate everybody joining us this evening, I know that there's other important
[01:28.520 --> 01:33.360]  things you could be doing like watching an FL football or going to a topless bar and
[01:33.360 --> 01:37.600]  getting drunk, no but being serious, folks attuned to this show understand that liberty
[01:37.600 --> 01:42.120]  is everything, liberty and freedom and the freedom to not be a slave and to control
[01:42.120 --> 01:49.040]  your own life and destiny is the engine of everything wholesome and good in this world
[01:49.040 --> 01:53.960]  and as the corruption of the new world order comes out more and more, the system is doing
[01:53.960 --> 01:59.200]  everything it can to stage terror attacks, to fear monger and to try to force us back
[01:59.200 --> 02:04.240]  into submission as seeing the state as our big mommy, our big daddy, they want us to
[02:04.240 --> 02:11.280]  be basically forever like ignorant children being led around by big brother, big sis but
[02:11.280 --> 02:16.720]  the issue is big brother and big sis do not have our best interested heart, big brother
[02:16.720 --> 02:24.560]  and big sis literally are feeding on us like wolves feed on sheep or cattle and that's
[02:24.560 --> 02:29.600]  why they've got all this new legislation we've been covering in weeks past dealing with
[02:29.600 --> 02:35.120]  WikiLeaks and that's why they're moving so hard to try to pass the different cyber security
[02:35.120 --> 02:40.800]  legislation and the different legislation to put you in prison for life or worse if
[02:40.800 --> 02:44.960]  you leak any type of secrets or if you're a member of the media and you report on it
[02:44.960 --> 02:50.880]  but I agree with Ron Paul he said it best that telling the truth is not treason plus
[02:50.880 --> 02:58.400]  Julian Assange who's now been released from jail is on bail is not an American to begin
[02:58.400 --> 03:02.600]  with you have to be an American to engage in treason against the United States but the
[03:02.600 --> 03:07.560]  real people engaging in treason are the corrupt politicians who've gotten into power and who
[03:07.560 --> 03:12.080]  have sold us out to the crooked offshore banks who are now literally not just sucking this
[03:12.080 --> 03:18.360]  country but the entire world dry right now meanwhile the United States is continuing
[03:18.360 --> 03:24.040]  the New York Times reports to build a case for conspiracy by WikiLeaks and there's open
[03:24.040 --> 03:31.800]  talk of a federal grand jury and paneled looking at some type of espionage indictments against
[03:31.800 --> 03:37.440]  Assange or others will they indict Cass Sunstein the White House regulations are who first
[03:37.440 --> 03:40.960]  announced WikiLeaks three years ago in an op-ed piece the Washington Post will they
[03:40.960 --> 03:46.120]  go after George Soros's right hand man publicly funding WikiLeaks or the Chinese dissidents
[03:46.120 --> 03:52.200]  admittedly on CIA payroll and connected who are the heart of WikiLeaks again Assange is
[03:52.200 --> 03:56.920]  clearly a puppet I salute the much of the work of WikiLeaks but this is being done as
[03:56.920 --> 04:03.400]  a 9-11 style attack a false flag attack on the internet and to create a chilling effect
[04:03.400 --> 04:07.800]  there's open discussions of indicting the New York Times going after their different
[04:07.800 --> 04:12.640]  reporters or editors for publishing WikiLeaks material or going after Guardian reporters
[04:12.640 --> 04:17.240]  but in England they aren't the government already has D notices to block anything that
[04:17.240 --> 04:21.000]  any story that violates national security so why has the Guardian been allowed to do
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.560]  this over and over again because it's because it's part of a larger program so they can
[04:26.560 --> 04:33.640]  get corporations and government scared and the insiders can get all of this anti free
[04:33.640 --> 04:39.640]  speech legislation rammed through so regardless of what you think of WikiLeaks if you believe
[04:39.640 --> 04:43.800]  in the First Amendment and free speech worldwide you've got to say no to people out there promoting
[04:43.800 --> 04:49.840]  the execution of Julian Assange you know give me a break they should not make telling the
[04:49.840 --> 04:55.440]  truth illegal alright folks we'll be right back with a senator Rand Paul Congressman

[06:08.080 --> 06:14.640]  back in the new year for longer we only got him for about 10 15 minutes right now how amazing
[06:14.640 --> 06:20.920]  Senator elect Rand Paul going to the Senate Senator I just want to say congratulations
[06:20.920 --> 06:26.760]  to you well thank you it's good to be with you again Alex my first question is they threw
[06:26.760 --> 06:31.480]  everything they could at you one of the biggest demonization campaigns in modern history it
[06:31.480 --> 06:37.520]  failed what does that say about the dinosaur corporate establishment media well I think
[06:37.520 --> 06:41.840]  it's amazing that you know not only do they throw the kitchen sink at us they made up
[06:41.840 --> 06:47.240]  a few things along the way but what I would say is that the mainstream media doesn't control
[06:47.240 --> 06:51.360]  the process anymore I think there are so many other outlets where people are getting their
[06:51.360 --> 06:59.280]  news talk radios a big one the internet another big one and I think also that the scare tactics
[06:59.280 --> 07:05.360]  of saying oh so-and-so is going to take away or cut off your grandmother's Social Security
[07:05.360 --> 07:11.080]  doesn't work anymore because people realize that if we do nothing no one will have Social
[07:11.080 --> 07:16.280]  Security no one will have Medicare because the politicians have basically spent all the
[07:16.280 --> 07:20.440]  money and there has to be some reform whether you like it or not there's going to have
[07:20.440 --> 07:24.360]  to be some kind of entitlement reform well moving quickly through these questions again
[07:24.360 --> 07:28.840]  you're gracious to join us obviously I'm sure you know that Cass Sunstein at the White
[07:28.840 --> 07:35.000]  House the commissar excuse me Commissioner of the FCC said freedom without government
[07:35.000 --> 07:40.200]  control of media was an aberration they're really moving in right now to try to curtail
[07:40.200 --> 07:45.640]  free speech what's your concern with that senator well funny I've been concerned about
[07:45.640 --> 07:50.280]  the fairness doctrine ever since I was a teenager and I can remember writing to a conservative
[07:50.280 --> 07:55.400]  leader back then and the conservative leader said oh we need a fairness doctrine because
[07:55.400 --> 08:00.040]  the liberals are controlling all the radio and the television now it's funny it's the
[08:00.040 --> 08:04.760]  opposite now that there's more conservative commentators the liberals want to stifle
[08:04.760 --> 08:09.320]  the conservatives but I think free speech is free speech whether it's a liberal commentator
[08:09.320 --> 08:13.800]  or a conservative commentator and that we shouldn't have the government involved in
[08:13.800 --> 08:18.520]  deciding what we hear on the radio waves what we read in the newspaper what we write what
[08:18.520 --> 08:25.720]  is written in books senator obviously you're watching the lame duck congress try to legalize
[08:25.720 --> 08:31.880]  illegal aliens with the dream act trying to further gut society trying to pass the food
[08:31.880 --> 08:36.680]  safety bill which was written by big agra to shut down local farms and ranches
[08:36.680 --> 08:43.800]  uh boy I tell you they are really showing how disconnected they are are you going to try to
[08:43.800 --> 08:48.760]  lead in the senate to make sure that whatever the horrible things they do like obama care and other
[08:48.760 --> 08:54.600]  things are repealed absolutely and the other thing is is you got to wonder why when we just had
[08:54.600 --> 08:59.880]  such a big historic mandate of an election that they're trying to ram all these things
[08:59.880 --> 09:04.760]  through in a lame duck of course we know why but the thing is is we shouldn't let them do it the
[09:04.760 --> 09:11.080]  people have spoken and elected you know nearly 100 new people in the house 13 new people in the
[09:11.080 --> 09:16.600]  senate that we need to wait till the the electoral process has been allowed to occur and the new
[09:16.600 --> 09:22.120]  people get there so yes anything they try to do in this session I think we will try to reverse
[09:22.680 --> 09:28.040]  and uh I think that you're already hearing people you know people are saying that let's wait for
[09:28.040 --> 09:33.400]  the new people that's the senator debits said today let's wait for the new senators absolutely
[09:33.400 --> 09:39.080]  they've certainly been rebuked in their activities but they're like a bunch of drunken sailors
[09:39.080 --> 09:44.360]  trying to steal as much as they can uh speaking of your father uh headline ron paul
[09:45.000 --> 09:51.240]  author of in the fed to lead a panel overseeing central bank uh are you going to join with
[09:51.240 --> 09:56.600]  your father in an attempt uh to get rid of the private federal reserve system that won't tell
[09:56.600 --> 10:02.920]  congress where the trillions went well how exciting is it to have the the probably historically the
[10:02.920 --> 10:08.200]  number one critic of the fed being in charge of oversight of the fed that's got to excite people
[10:08.200 --> 10:13.400]  throughout the country and I think a lot of good will come of it I think the first thing we have
[10:13.400 --> 10:18.920]  to do is try to audit the fed and have a real meaningful audit of the fed I was amazed at the
[10:18.920 --> 10:25.560]  coalition my dad put together over 330 people the house signed on to it 30 some odd people in the
[10:25.560 --> 10:32.440]  senate and yet like so many legislators shenanigans they stole victory from him and they gave us a
[10:32.440 --> 10:37.560]  watered-down audit but even the watered-down audit we're getting some information about what the fed
[10:37.560 --> 10:43.160]  bought but boy he could really get through if he could get through a real audit I will be supporting
[10:43.160 --> 10:49.160]  and introducing that in the senate as well so I think the potential for us uh shedding some light
[10:49.160 --> 10:55.800]  on what the fed does is enormous a lot of folks obviously want your father to run for president
[10:57.400 --> 11:02.040]  are you thinking about uh or are you getting questions senator elect about running for
[11:02.040 --> 11:09.160]  president yourself well uh no but uh it's it's uh very complimentary to get such a question
[11:09.160 --> 11:13.960]  but you know I think I haven't even really been sworn into my first office it might be premature
[11:13.960 --> 11:18.200]  for me to be thinking about it well it was the same thing with George Washington he went right from
[11:18.200 --> 11:25.240]  general the president I mean we need doctors and farmers and people to be senators and and and
[11:25.240 --> 11:30.360]  presidents we don't need you know the the lawyers I mean it's so great that you and your father are
[11:30.360 --> 11:36.760]  both doctors I mean you're there right now seeing patients today uh in between uh this interview I
[11:36.760 --> 11:43.640]  mean your victory is our victory and and I just want to commend you well I appreciate that and I
[11:43.640 --> 11:48.360]  know you've got a lot of loyal listeners and we hear from them and we meet them across the country
[11:48.360 --> 11:54.680]  and all across Kentucky I end up running into your loyal fans but the uh the interesting thing is
[11:54.680 --> 11:59.960]  is we're going to do some things that have never been done before in the sense that as soon as I
[11:59.960 --> 12:04.920]  get there I'm going to talk about and introduce a bill that will cut a significant amount of spending
[12:04.920 --> 12:08.840]  we have a bill we're working on that will cut 500 billion dollars worth of spending
[12:09.480 --> 12:13.560]  and that's where we've got to start and I think the American people are ready to hear it
[12:13.560 --> 12:18.520]  because the American people know that we're mortgaging our future to China that we're printing
[12:18.520 --> 12:23.960]  up the money to pay for these massive deaths and then ultimately as the day of reckoning comes
[12:23.960 --> 12:30.360]  closer and closer we are in fear of destroying our country if we don't do something about this
[12:30.360 --> 12:35.400]  and so I think people are no longer afraid at least I'm not afraid to go ahead and introduce
[12:35.400 --> 12:40.360]  significant spending cuts and say look if you're serious about this problem you need to vote for
[12:40.360 --> 12:44.600]  this absolutely discussion senator sorry to interrupt you we only got about six minutes left
[12:44.600 --> 12:50.120]  with you here today and I've got so many questions it turns MSNBC was deceitful they lied about what
[12:50.120 --> 12:54.440]  your real views were they tried all sorts of dirty tricks they said if you don't like Obamacare
[12:54.440 --> 13:00.280]  you are a racist we now learn that hundreds of millions of dollars from your father's even partial
[13:00.280 --> 13:08.600]  audit of our tax money went to general electric and to MSNBC how creepy is that to know that a
[13:08.600 --> 13:15.640]  government media source like like the Kremlin or something went after you well the weird thing
[13:15.640 --> 13:20.760]  about it also is is that you know I tell people that once upon a time our dollar was backed by
[13:20.760 --> 13:28.760]  gold until about 1971 at least partially from 71 to about the year 2005 our dollar was backed by
[13:29.400 --> 13:33.560]  at least US Treasury bills debt wasn't the best thing in the world but it was the least of the
[13:33.560 --> 13:42.040]  government debt from about 2005 on though it's backed by I guess buying GE MSNBC backed by buying
[13:42.040 --> 13:49.560]  used car loans basically backed by what we're what the government calls toxic assets things that you
[13:49.560 --> 13:54.920]  and I and no person with a rational investment mind would ever buy we were forced to buy by the
[13:54.920 --> 14:01.080]  Federal Reserve buying it but that's essentially what backs the US dollar now toxic assets are now
[14:01.080 --> 14:08.680]  what we pyramid the dollar on and that is worrisome incredible dealing with the carbon tax when you
[14:08.680 --> 14:15.400]  said I've got a message from the Tea Party to Washington yeah we're going to stop you from
[14:15.400 --> 14:22.600]  this carbon tax California went ahead with it a 20 tax they're already got over 30 unemployment
[14:22.600 --> 14:29.320]  60 minutes reports what are you going to do as a senator sir to try to aggressively block
[14:29.320 --> 14:36.440]  Obama from implementing his agenda by stealth through the EPA and FDA and other groups yeah
[14:36.440 --> 14:40.520]  that's one of my biggest fears and one of the things that through the election I learned more
[14:40.520 --> 14:47.320]  about our government was that I was amazed and appalled to know how much the unelected bureaucrats
[14:47.320 --> 14:53.000]  are doing and that basically if something fails in the Senate or on the House they simply do it
[14:53.000 --> 14:59.000]  anyway through these bureaucracies and so part of the reform agenda that I think the Tea Party
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.400]  stands for one of the items that I will push for is sunsetting all regulations basically if they
[15:05.400 --> 15:10.280]  pass the regulation it has to be voted on in Congress by a certain period of time maybe six
[15:10.280 --> 15:15.880]  months maybe a year but it cannot just be put on the books by unelected bureaucrats and really
[15:15.880 --> 15:21.960]  we're in danger of having the government run by the standing bureaucracy you know the founding
[15:21.960 --> 15:27.800]  fathers talked about standing armies now what we have is a standing bureaucracy that we need to fear
[15:27.800 --> 15:32.760]  and we really need to have governmental reform and that's a big thing that I'm going to be pushing
[15:32.760 --> 15:38.760]  as part of what I call the Tea Party platform
[15:38.760 --> 16:04.920]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[16:04.920 --> 16:09.240]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[16:09.240 --> 16:14.280]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[16:14.280 --> 16:19.880]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[16:19.880 --> 16:25.000]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.280]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[16:30.280 --> 16:34.920]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[16:34.920 --> 16:40.280]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[16:40.280 --> 16:44.680]  peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[16:44.680 --> 16:50.600]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's
[16:50.600 --> 16:56.760]  mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call

[17:05.480 --> 17:10.200]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.880]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned the members influence
[17:15.880 --> 17:21.880]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all
[17:21.880 --> 17:27.880]  of us as American citizens to pay attention fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our
[17:27.880 --> 17:34.360]  nation the criminal off-short cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[17:34.360 --> 17:39.720]  world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[17:39.720 --> 17:44.440]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[18:01.880 --> 18:05.880]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator
[18:05.880 --> 18:10.840]  now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into

[20:18.520 --> 20:29.320]  answers well so does he it's alex jones on a gcm radio network
[20:29.320 --> 20:39.880]  god talk to him every day what do you mean i don't support your system i go to court when i have to
[20:41.720 --> 20:46.600]  what do you mean i can't get the word on dealing with the tsa we had your father the honorable
[20:46.600 --> 20:52.040]  congressman and medical doctor from texas where i hail from we had him on about three weeks ago
[20:52.040 --> 20:56.200]  and made national news and the drudge report and abc news and other places he hadn't really
[20:56.200 --> 21:01.000]  complained about it previously he was against the tsa and it's groping and radiating people
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.440]  but now the tsa is announcing they're going to continue sticking their hands
[21:04.440 --> 21:09.240]  actually in people's pants they only grabbed him on the outside of the pants and the same thing
[21:09.240 --> 21:14.600]  happened to former governor ventura now the indian ambassador says she'll never come back here again
[21:14.600 --> 21:21.160]  that's in the news today i mean who runs things the tsa and homeland security or the congress plus
[21:21.160 --> 21:26.200]  what are the feds doing seizing control of transportation now they're expanding out to the
[21:26.200 --> 21:31.320]  roads they're putting telescreens in walmart with napolitano giving people orders what's
[21:31.320 --> 21:35.080]  your take on all this orwellian stuff and what's your plan to deal with that
[21:35.720 --> 21:42.520]  well i think uh it's amazing that after 10 years uh we still don't have a frequent hire plan it just
[21:42.520 --> 21:47.800]  shows you the incompetence of the federal government that you know i my father flaws twice a week my
[21:47.800 --> 21:53.240]  brother-in-law flaws three or four times a week why is there not some sort of voluntary program or
[21:53.240 --> 21:58.040]  private program where you could volunteer to have a little more background check but do it
[21:58.040 --> 22:03.880]  voluntarily and have a private group that you uh do it and then they fly through the airport uh
[22:03.880 --> 22:09.000]  walk through uh without obstruction uh there's no reason why this couldn't be done except for
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.040]  the government does not seem to be able to do anything in a logical fashion and so instead
[22:14.040 --> 22:19.720]  of saying well let's investigate certain people who are flying in from certain countries most of
[22:19.720 --> 22:24.680]  the danger i think at risk on the plane is inner people coming from other countries so why don't
[22:24.680 --> 22:31.400]  we look at those folks you know look at the flight uh plan of who's coming to visit us from certain
[22:31.400 --> 22:37.880]  countries and do some investigation in advance of those folks but i think we're wasting time on the
[22:38.600 --> 22:43.240]  millions and millions of americans who aren't a threat and when you waste so much time on
[22:43.240 --> 22:48.360]  those people you don't have enough time to spend on the people who truly are a threat well senator
[22:48.360 --> 22:53.720]  rand paul joining us live only a minute or two left uh they know that the american people aren't
[22:53.720 --> 22:58.840]  the threat but the mayak and homeland security report uh you know again your father it said if
[22:58.840 --> 23:03.000]  you have a ron paul sticker that's the enemy returning veterans it was in the news yesterday
[23:03.000 --> 23:08.120]  that tsa's harassing our returning troops i mean you're being diplomatic and i respect that but
[23:08.120 --> 23:12.440]  but what do you i mean in your gut do you agree that this is just a federal power grab and they
[23:12.440 --> 23:18.840]  want to train us uh do you know normal citizens to basically submit like we're criminals in a prison
[23:19.560 --> 23:24.280]  i think the danger anytime you give a government agency so much power is that
[23:24.280 --> 23:30.120]  exactly what rama manual said about government you know let no crisis go wasted let no crisis
[23:30.840 --> 23:37.320]  deter us or you know let's use those crises to go ahead and foment and use government
[23:37.320 --> 23:43.480]  to grow larger and larger so yeah there is a danger and what they do is they suck in some
[23:43.480 --> 23:48.520]  well-meaning people and they want the power to say that it's going after terrorism which none of us
[23:48.520 --> 23:53.560]  want terrorists to be allowed to attack our country but in the process we all get swooped up in it
[23:53.560 --> 23:58.040]  and all of our liberties get infringed upon and that that's the real danger in these things
[23:58.040 --> 24:04.120]  but it always works upon trying to show you something that is rational something that
[24:04.120 --> 24:09.240]  people don't want to have happened nobody wants another terrorist attack but in doing so
[24:09.240 --> 24:15.480]  then everybody gets lumped in together and our freedoms get uh you know eroded and taken away
[24:15.480 --> 24:23.320]  last question sir obviously there are a lot of republicans and like like bainer who it was in
[24:23.320 --> 24:26.760]  bloomberg was going to try to block your father getting the committee chairmanship that he was
[24:26.760 --> 24:32.680]  already supposed to get in seniority uh and and blocking so many others he's a protege of newt
[24:32.680 --> 24:37.480]  gainrich who supports global warming taxes and uh you know globalism i'm not trying to get a fight
[24:37.480 --> 24:43.880]  going between republicans but uh we've seen former senator trent lot bragging the news that hey we're
[24:43.880 --> 24:49.240]  going to co-opt all these new senators uh and uh house members i would hope that if you do see
[24:49.240 --> 24:54.280]  the co-opting that that not only we know you won't sell out we know that your honorable family you're
[24:54.280 --> 24:59.720]  an honorable person values are what matter but hopefully you'll blow the whistle and and and
[24:59.720 --> 25:05.640]  truly lead uh and and let us know about you know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are we
[25:05.640 --> 25:10.440]  know senator demitz good and a few others uh but what's your basic statement on that i mean are
[25:10.440 --> 25:15.720]  they already trying to pull you into the smoky rooms well i think what's interesting is that we've
[25:15.720 --> 25:20.280]  already had an impact and we haven't even gotten up there and i think they have heard the message
[25:20.280 --> 25:25.320]  and you've heard some of them saying you know what we heard the message of the election but the the
[25:25.320 --> 25:31.960]  real devil is in the details and you know of what these negotiations are what happens behind closed
[25:31.960 --> 25:38.840]  doors and i will do my utmost to shine light on that but also to stand up in the senate and say
[25:38.840 --> 25:43.560]  this isn't what we're going to do we have to do something about the debt and we can't just keep
[25:43.560 --> 25:50.440]  spending money so yeah i think you'll find that uh i will be a voice that will look for opportunities
[25:50.440 --> 25:57.000]  at every turn to try to slow down their agenda and also to correct things and i think that that's
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.640]  not really been done in the past because so many of the people who get elected have been in office
[26:01.640 --> 26:07.640]  forever and ever i've never been in office before i think it gives me a perspective where i haven't
[26:07.640 --> 26:13.240]  been beaten down by the system and i go there really truly with the belief that i can and
[26:13.240 --> 26:17.720]  want to be part of a movement that changes our country for the better yes sir in closing and
[26:17.720 --> 26:23.800]  i know you've got to get back to patience while one caveat here i know uh that that we do need to
[26:23.800 --> 26:28.840]  cut spending you've you've called for cutting this uh a defense i believe you said by a hundred
[26:28.840 --> 26:36.040]  billion that's that's large that's substantive uh but also don't we need to say no more bailouts
[26:36.040 --> 26:41.560]  if somebody like paulson comes down there again like happened in in october uh two years ago
[26:41.560 --> 26:45.800]  and says we're gonna have marshal law we're gonna have collapse if you don't do this i mean what
[26:45.800 --> 26:51.960]  do we do at that point when they try to hold our financial system hostage again i mean what are you
[26:51.960 --> 26:57.800]  planning to do at that point i think you need to have people who are brave enough and confident enough
[26:57.800 --> 27:04.760]  in their belief in freedom to stand up and say we can survive a bankruptcy and also to point out that
[27:04.760 --> 27:11.400]  aig's bankruptcy or lack of bankruptcy in their bailout basically wasn't bailing out just aig
[27:11.400 --> 27:16.760]  it was bailing out a lot of wall street bankers who had money in aig but also was bailing out
[27:16.760 --> 27:22.200]  a lot of foreign banks so really a lot of this is just pointing out the truth and letting people
[27:22.200 --> 27:29.480]  know that and i think people are are very upset when they find out that you know very very wealthy
[27:29.480 --> 27:35.640]  inside bankers in in new york as well as across the country and across the world benefited from
[27:35.640 --> 27:40.600]  average middle class taxpayers like the rest of us having to send money to washington to bail out
[27:40.600 --> 27:45.720]  aig but what they do is they're all gang up and say oh it'd be the end of the world if you don't
[27:45.720 --> 27:50.760]  do this but my dad's always made a good point that all the people who said it would be the end of the
[27:50.760 --> 27:55.640]  world and that there'd be a collapse of the economy we're all the same people who didn't predict any
[27:55.640 --> 28:00.440]  of this coming so we don't have to accept their word at face value that we have to take their
[28:00.440 --> 28:07.000]  predictions as they were well thank you senator elect and we look forward to talking to you when
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.640]  you are in office this is a great victory for all lovers of liberty they threw everything
[28:11.640 --> 28:17.240]  they could at you and collectively all of us and they failed this could be history if we get ron paul
[28:17.240 --> 28:23.560]  in as president as john adams and then down the road like john quincey adams ran paul sir god bless
[28:23.560 --> 28:28.840]  you have a great holiday say hi to your wife and sons and say hi to your father and mother just

[28:36.280 --> 28:42.920]  hair out they did everything they could to stop us and they failed and it's like a victory of

[28:48.920 --> 28:54.920]  this but in the end my great great great great grandchildren are gonna be just like buck rogers

[33:37.560 --> 33:44.120]  reverse the tide of tyranny the special interest globally that go in any nation they wish buy off
[33:44.120 --> 33:52.120]  the politicians and then attach themselves to the people's tax money that all the special
[33:52.120 --> 33:59.320]  interests they write the rules to shut down their competition evidenced by the fact that 97 percent
[33:59.320 --> 34:04.600]  of stimulus money to small businesses went to fortune 500 evidenced by obama giving hundreds
[34:04.600 --> 34:09.000]  of waivers to mcdonald's and others to not have to get insurance for their employees but everybody
[34:09.000 --> 34:15.240]  else who has a company is going to be forced to that's an unfair trade advantage you know these
[34:15.240 --> 34:24.520]  are the real forms of discrimination that are taking place in our society and then in the
[34:24.520 --> 34:29.800]  name of not having discrimination they say everyone will have the tsa body scan you everyone will
[34:29.800 --> 34:36.200]  have the tsa stick their hands down your pants everyone will have their rights taken away unless
[34:36.200 --> 34:42.360]  you're a member of congress or a member of the cabinet no you get to go around the naked body
[34:42.360 --> 34:57.080]  scanners and then i see all these news articles feds warrantlessly tracking americans credit cards
[34:57.080 --> 35:01.640]  in real time wired magazine they just say oh guess what we're not just spying on you we're
[35:01.640 --> 35:07.080]  tracking all your credit cards and we're tracking all your loyalty cards in real time here's the
[35:07.080 --> 35:12.600]  washington post government reports violations of limits on spying into u.s citizens so we've gone
[35:12.600 --> 35:16.920]  from four years ago bush in that press conference president bush saying oh we don't spy on you without
[35:16.920 --> 35:25.000]  warrants to just hey everything's spied on well there's an organization out there fighting it
[35:25.000 --> 35:31.400]  and it's liberty guard liberty guard org and of course bob bar's the chair and the head of it we
[35:31.400 --> 35:38.440]  had the president on of liberty guard last week his website's a bob bar dot org he really doesn't
[35:38.440 --> 35:43.560]  need any introduction a well-known congressman defender of civil liberties and basic human
[35:43.560 --> 35:50.520]  rights also ran in 2008 as libertarian presidential candidate for president had a good showing on
[35:50.520 --> 35:55.640]  that front certainly got to inject a lot of serious issues into the debate he joins us for the next
[35:55.640 --> 36:01.320]  25 minutes congressman good to have you on with us oh it's always great to be with you all and
[36:01.320 --> 36:06.920]  uh you're many many listeners out there uh congressman uh i mean let's start at the beginning
[36:06.920 --> 36:12.200]  how did we go this far where the town i live in has federally run face scanning cameras and
[36:12.200 --> 36:17.400]  license plate readers through the threat fusion center they have clergy response teams admittedly
[36:17.400 --> 36:23.640]  with preachers trained to spy for homeland security that's associated press uh we have tsa sticking
[36:23.640 --> 36:28.280]  their hands down people's pants and radiating them but the borders are basically wide open
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.760]  i'm glad you formed liberty garden for years have been speaking out against this but
[36:32.760 --> 36:37.160]  man you know folks were like all bob bar's kind of little too concerned 10 years ago
[36:37.160 --> 36:44.440]  now people are saying my god i mean are we going to be worse than 1984 i tell you the technology
[36:44.440 --> 36:51.080]  that is available nowadays uh that governments and businesses can use to invade privacy and to
[36:51.080 --> 36:57.400]  data mine uh goes far beyond anything that you or dore well could have could have envisioned so
[36:58.280 --> 37:04.600]  in some respects certainly we're not we're not at the point of the totalitarian brutality state that
[37:04.600 --> 37:11.160]  that was depicted in 1984 but in terms of the technology that is available to government to
[37:11.160 --> 37:18.520]  invade people's privacy and to control them by taking away their privacy uh far exceeds what was
[37:18.520 --> 37:25.880]  uh what was available or could be even contemplated back in the 1940s when 1984 was right was written
[37:25.880 --> 37:30.280]  absolutely well i mean take the tsa i want to see if you concur with me and then i want you to
[37:30.280 --> 37:35.000]  have some time and go over your view on it and what liberty guard is doing but they i mean i saw
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.720]  ridge seven years ago when he was head of homeland security on c span and a two-hour round table with
[37:39.720 --> 37:45.080]  corporate heads he said you'll have to have an id card to have a job that's the real id he said
[37:45.640 --> 37:49.960]  that it will be internal checkpoints and now they're out there with the tsa running checkpoints on
[37:49.960 --> 37:56.920]  highways bus terminals as you know congressman and now they're saying a no fly no buy if if they say
[37:56.920 --> 38:02.440]  you can't fly you can't buy a gun no judge no jury you're put on this kafka-esque list i mean is
[38:02.440 --> 38:07.720]  this not internal checkpoints what give us your take on that and and and and and just the overall
[38:07.720 --> 38:14.040]  spectrum of what's happening with the tsa but what what's happened here alex is we've had a
[38:14.040 --> 38:19.480]  sort of a perfect storm uh we've seen and you've seen of course because you've spoken out about it
[38:19.480 --> 38:26.920]  for many years the growth in uh government power on virtually all fronts uh but it accelerated
[38:26.920 --> 38:36.040]  greatly as a result of what happened on september 11th uh of 2000 uh 2001 uh and it is that abject
[38:36.040 --> 38:45.880]  fear uh that has both empowered government to greatly accelerate uh the uh the steps to to control
[38:45.880 --> 38:52.440]  people take away their privacy to gain information to control them in various ways and it's that same
[38:52.440 --> 38:59.560]  fear that has made so many americans virtual sheep in terms of saying well if it makes us safer it's
[38:59.560 --> 39:06.360]  okay we have to give up uh some of our freedom in order for government to make us secure i mean
[39:06.360 --> 39:13.800]  that is a toxic mixture uh that has given rise now to uh the scenario that you've just described
[39:13.800 --> 39:21.320]  which for example just focusing on one very small part of it and that is the tsa naked body
[39:21.320 --> 39:32.040]  scanners uh or uh you know the the very intrusive uh hand searches uh clearly these are unconstitutional
[39:32.040 --> 39:39.080]  because they are doing this to people uh as to whom they have no reasonable suspicion whatsoever
[39:39.080 --> 39:44.920]  that they have done anything wrong or are purporting or attempting for example to bring weapons or
[39:44.920 --> 39:51.400]  explosives on an airplane uh also i think it's important for people to to keep in mind as i
[39:51.400 --> 40:00.680]  know your listeners do uh that the freedom to travel the right to travel in interstate commerce
[40:00.680 --> 40:08.760]  that is to take a commercial airliner from point a to point b has been found many years ago by the
[40:08.760 --> 40:17.400]  u.s supreme court to be a fundamental index of freedom of liberty uh now are we going to get
[40:17.400 --> 40:23.640]  to the point where the supreme court will put a stop to this nonsense i don't know uh just as
[40:23.640 --> 40:30.280]  alito on the u.s supreme court for example uh in an opinion a few years ago seemed to indicate
[40:30.280 --> 40:38.360]  that uh without some suspicion that an air traveler is doing something wrong or that tsa
[40:38.360 --> 40:45.000]  can articulate a reason why they need to search this particular person beyond the normal screening
[40:45.000 --> 40:51.240]  process uh is unconstitutional whether or not a whether or not he still believes that whether
[40:51.240 --> 40:58.440]  or not a majority of the court will will so render a decision i don't know uh and even though i'm not
[40:58.440 --> 41:04.840]  uh terribly hopeful uh that that will happen it's it's terribly important that we finally get some
[41:05.400 --> 41:11.240]  resolution of this to get this teed up uh so that it can get through the court well absolutely
[41:11.240 --> 41:18.200]  congressman but on top of that uh we've seen in the last few weeks cases where uh they want to
[41:18.200 --> 41:23.080]  x-ray a woman's breast milk or they want another woman to dump or milk out and they hold up the
[41:23.080 --> 41:28.920]  tsa's own own own rule book uh which is just regulations but but their own rules and they
[41:28.920 --> 41:35.800]  don't care because so many of these people it seems enjoy the exercise of power some are polite but
[41:35.800 --> 41:41.960]  i've seen others that literally treat people worse than you know jail guards treat prisoners uh it's
[41:41.960 --> 41:48.040]  just incredible and also they're supposed to take a medical i d card when they're clearly
[41:48.040 --> 41:53.240]  wanting someone's knee and it's a metal knee or a metal hip i've talked to governor ventura about
[41:53.240 --> 41:59.480]  this they all know who he is i've seen him ask for for uh autographs but then they grab his
[41:59.480 --> 42:03.800]  crotch i've flown with him right in front of him ron paul was on two weeks ago he said yes they
[42:03.800 --> 42:10.200]  grab his crotch uh i have sat there and watched nothing but women and children being searched
[42:10.200 --> 42:16.280]  when i was in san jose so they also randomly only search certain groups i mean this is a complete
[42:16.280 --> 42:27.400]  journey towards submission to these untrained in many respects federal federal goods congressmen
[42:27.400 --> 42:50.520]  i mean this is as you said so orwellian

[44:39.000 --> 45:04.680]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[45:04.680 --> 45:09.800]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[45:09.800 --> 45:14.680]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[45:14.680 --> 45:20.280]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[45:20.280 --> 45:25.320]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[45:25.320 --> 45:30.440]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[45:30.440 --> 45:34.600]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[45:34.600 --> 45:39.960]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[45:39.960 --> 45:44.440]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[45:44.440 --> 45:50.040]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com
[45:50.040 --> 45:55.080]  that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[45:55.080 --> 46:01.720]  backup dot com or call one eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five you've heard alex
[46:01.720 --> 46:06.200]  explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced
[46:06.200 --> 46:11.160]  colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system
[46:11.160 --> 46:15.400]  and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body
[46:16.280 --> 46:21.640]  my name is mario safaldi and i'm the developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the
[46:21.640 --> 46:26.680]  silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped
[46:26.680 --> 46:32.040]  with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to
[46:32.040 --> 46:40.200]  key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the

[47:01.640 --> 47:09.320]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[47:09.320 --> 47:22.360]  what we've got here is failure to communicate some man you just can't reach so you get what
[47:22.360 --> 47:27.960]  we had here last week which is the way he wants well he is
[47:27.960 --> 47:41.080]  i don't like it anymore waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[47:41.080 --> 47:58.040]  where do you see this fight going in your gut do you agree with me that this is something
[47:58.040 --> 48:03.800]  actually that's gone too far people being sexually violated and that no matter what the tsa does or
[48:03.800 --> 48:08.280]  how much propaganda they put out or how much intimidation that if you don't do it we'll give
[48:08.280 --> 48:13.560]  you a eleven thousand dollar fines or we'll put you on a no fly list i mean do you see them losing
[48:13.560 --> 48:20.920]  this they they they will lose it the american people will prevail but it's going to take a lot
[48:20.920 --> 48:27.480]  of hard work over an extended period of time alex it's not going to uh be successful that is the
[48:27.480 --> 48:35.800]  fight for freedom and to reign in this this this intrusive overbearing uh and unnecessary unconstitutional
[48:35.800 --> 48:41.000]  government behavior you can never let up in the fight against government oppression never ever
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.840]  let up uh so you know it's a constant battle to make sure that the real id doesn't uh doesn't
[48:46.840 --> 48:51.960]  surface uh if something else they'll give it a new acronym and so forth that they'll fund it partially
[48:51.960 --> 48:58.840]  somewhere and then come back to it again later but at least for now that's been a very significant
[48:58.840 --> 49:06.040]  success uh in fighting government intrusion and unconstitutional behavior secondly even though
[49:06.040 --> 49:13.240]  these are small victories that you just indicated with regard to airline pilots and some uh loosening
[49:13.240 --> 49:20.040]  of uh the the intrusive searches uh and the x-rays on certain types of persons uh children
[49:20.040 --> 49:25.560]  under and minors and so forth uh it's going to take a lot more i mean as long as the government
[49:25.560 --> 49:33.240]  is able to uh have people subject themselves to a naked body scanner uh with the only alternative
[49:33.240 --> 49:42.600]  being a you know grossly invasive uh manual uh search uh without uh articulating any suspicion
[49:42.600 --> 49:46.600]  that the person that they're searching either electronically or manually has done anything
[49:46.600 --> 49:52.440]  wrong as long as people are willing to put up with that it's going to embolden government uh to
[49:52.440 --> 50:00.600]  continue to press the envelope i'm also hopeful that the court challenges uh will uh will be successful
[50:01.480 --> 50:08.520]  i'm also hopeful that some of the new uh chairman coming into congress for example john mica of
[50:08.520 --> 50:15.320]  florida uh who is the uh who is likely to be the the transportation committee chair in the house
[50:15.320 --> 50:23.480]  with responsibility over uh air travel uh and darrell isa of california uh who is likely to take
[50:23.480 --> 50:29.800]  over as chair of the government oversight reform committee uh that both of these uh chairs on the
[50:29.800 --> 50:36.440]  house side uh will uh very shortly uh after taking over their positions uh which seems likely as
[50:36.440 --> 50:43.800]  chairman of these two key committees uh will hold some uh some real tough and consistent long-term
[50:43.800 --> 50:49.480]  oversight hearings uh on tsa and what they're doing all right congressman a bunch of quick
[50:49.480 --> 50:56.120]  questions in the 12 minutes we've got left with you specifically uh dealing with some of your
[50:56.120 --> 51:02.280]  four year uh request that you've put out bob bar investigates tsa stand down on national opt out
[51:02.280 --> 51:07.000]  day i mean if they're saying that this terror threat was so imminent they had to stick their
[51:07.000 --> 51:12.200]  hands down people's pants and put put nuns and little old ladies and naked body scanners uh
[51:12.200 --> 51:18.040]  which they've been caught saving by the way folks the just continual deception then isn't that then
[51:18.040 --> 51:25.400]  some type of stand down or dereliction of duty or or fraud uh if as we've now confirmed even mainstream
[51:25.400 --> 51:30.600]  news is confirmed but i had employees that flew that day in multiple airports that they did completely
[51:30.600 --> 51:35.720]  stand down the scanners at most airports they didn't do the pat downs they were just running people
[51:35.720 --> 51:41.080]  through them at some of the other airports they just curtailed it and then ran this hoax saying
[51:41.080 --> 51:46.840]  oh it was tsa appreciation day no one opted out i mean uh that looks like that could be
[51:46.840 --> 51:50.440]  criminal right there i mean shouldn't we have some type of congressional investigation about the
[51:50.440 --> 51:59.160]  stand down a and then b uh watchdog probes dhs spying on drudge uh prisonplanet.com matt drudge
[51:59.160 --> 52:04.920]  alex jones the drudge report of course has been carrying that uh so i talk about a the stand down
[52:04.920 --> 52:09.720]  and b your four year dealing with persecution because even cnn has reported that they believe
[52:09.720 --> 52:16.280]  their reporters and others have been put on the list after running reports critical it it's a it's
[52:16.280 --> 52:21.720]  a real problem that we've gotten to the point in this country where if you simply question what the
[52:21.720 --> 52:27.400]  government is doing uh you're going to find yourself on the wrong end of that government power
[52:27.960 --> 52:35.560]  we see it in a number of areas alex we see it when citizens simply use a uh a camera video
[52:35.560 --> 52:41.560]  or a handheld video to record what police are doing in the public arena where they uh appear to be
[52:42.760 --> 52:47.880]  you know beating up somebody or taking action that they shouldn't uh and having then the police
[52:47.880 --> 52:53.640]  come after the people that are video taping uh recording what is being done uh what is being
[52:53.640 --> 52:58.520]  done in the open yeah there's no perception i mean i mean you know as a congressman and lawyer
[52:58.520 --> 53:03.640]  and everything else there's no perception of privacy so why do the cops march over 200 yards
[53:03.640 --> 53:09.640]  and then beat you up and arrest you for videotaping them it's it's a problem we see the the same thing
[53:09.640 --> 53:16.040]  with regard to some of the folks that have had uh you know what seems very clearly to be vindictive
[53:16.040 --> 53:23.800]  retaliation uh against them uh by tsa simply for raising you know raising some questions
[53:23.800 --> 53:31.880]  or objecting to what's been going on uh but the uh the lawsuits uh hopefully will
[53:31.880 --> 53:38.280]  will start clearing some of this up uh and you know people people need to not be intimidated
[53:38.280 --> 53:44.440]  they they need to be polite they need to be respectful uh i don't uh never urged anybody
[53:44.440 --> 53:49.880]  not to be polite respectful uh if the government appears to be doing something that you know
[53:50.760 --> 53:56.280]  not to be proper and that your rights are being violated uh but it's a sad day when
[53:56.280 --> 54:00.840]  people find that simply because they question government authority and what government is
[54:00.840 --> 54:06.520]  doing that they then uh have retaliatory action taken against them well congressman think that
[54:06.520 --> 54:10.360]  congress ought to look into so this i'm sorry to interrupt so that is something congress
[54:10.360 --> 54:15.880]  should look into absolutely they should the two committees uh that i indicated uh the government
[54:15.880 --> 54:21.080]  reform committee that will be chaired by darrell isaac california and the uh transportation
[54:21.080 --> 54:26.680]  committee that will be chaired by john michael florida obviously uh you've got some gravitas
[54:26.680 --> 54:31.800]  as a long-serving former congressman you know committee chairman uh you were also in the cia for
[54:31.800 --> 54:39.160]  many years uh hopefully they won't ignore your organizations for your uh request uh i don't
[54:39.160 --> 54:44.040]  think it's be called request it's a demand under law but they ignore it so often as you know uh but
[54:44.040 --> 54:50.360]  i've tried to get my fbi file and they won't even respond i got a lawyer involved they they
[54:50.360 --> 54:56.280]  said national security lord knows what's in that thing do you think you'll get any success getting
[54:56.280 --> 55:02.600]  this information from the tsa and if you do what's the time frame generally now these things can take
[55:02.600 --> 55:09.720]  a long time unfortunately a lot longer than they than they should uh you know we hope to uh uh you
[55:09.720 --> 55:15.640]  know have the records within uh within 20 days although they may respond that it takes longer
[55:15.640 --> 55:23.480]  for some reason or or whatnot i'm hopeful that the that will get at least some uh good information
[55:23.480 --> 55:31.800]  from the fba request that we sent in uh on the 29th of november uh but you know we'll just have to
[55:31.800 --> 55:37.640]  to wait and see it it is troubling uh that there certainly appears to be as you've already indicated
[55:38.600 --> 55:47.480]  a tsa stand down on the use of the full body naked body scanners on the days that there was a great
[55:47.480 --> 55:55.240]  deal of of attention drawn to opting out even as the tsa was was claiming that the use of these
[55:55.240 --> 56:01.320]  scanners is absolutely essential to protect uh the traveling public uh you know you can't have
[56:01.320 --> 56:08.040]  both ways amazing in closing we see cast unseen at the white house i'm sure you've seen it being a
[56:08.040 --> 56:16.840]  civil libertarian openly saying shut down alternative media uh uh uh fine or arrest people
[56:16.840 --> 56:22.120]  that question man-made global warming uh we've got all these announcements by other zars that
[56:22.120 --> 56:27.560]  they want to restrict free speech uh we see these moves by j rockefeller in his words we'd be better
[56:27.560 --> 56:32.440]  off never having the internet he talked about shutting down fox news in a bizarre statement
[56:32.440 --> 56:40.840]  two weeks ago uh i mean uh the as the alternative media expands i see a perfect storm of the old
[56:40.840 --> 56:46.200]  dinosaur media and the government really uh having an end for the alternative media

[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:22.440]  isn't just uh government going after media and new media outlets uh the alternative media the
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:30.280]  internet and so forth uh it's all of the above and uh the the so-called net neutrality uh law or
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:37.560]  regulations that the FCC is pushing right now uh is part and parcel of that uh the government
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:45.080]  government as you know almost always tries to couch its uh steps to take away liberty as uh
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:50.840]  liberty enhancing uh you know it's sort of they are they are well in a bizarre world approach to
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:57.000]  government uh but people need to watch out for this net neutrality uh law and the regulations as well
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.640]  yeah i've read the new FCC regulations and obviously you have that because you're you're
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:06.920]  you're you're accurately from my view addressing it it claims oh we're going to protect the internet
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:12.680]  but when you read it it's the FCC declaring regulation of the internet and when you get into
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:19.480]  the fine print of what they've said they want to start taxing it tracking it make you have an ID
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:23.560]  and that would be the end of the internet as we know it former congressman bob bar of liberty guard

[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:28.040]  but in a couple minutes dr. marcola before we launch into all this key information uh what's
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:33.880]  most important for folks to know about you who may not know who you are well i'm the founder of
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:39.320]  marcola.com which uh now currently is the third most visited health site in the world we're right
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:45.080]  behind the national institute of health and webmd and we just passed male clinic so we're number three
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:49.480]  in the world and gives us a platform to really educate people about the fraud and deception
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:55.480]  that's occurring uh from the drug industry and the food industry and uh you have made
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:00.280]  a significant milestones in your mission to bring people practical solutions to their health problems
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:06.120]  new york times best-selling author dr. marcola was also involved in 2009 ultimate wellness game
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:10.760]  changer by the huffington post and has been featured in time magazine la time singing in fox news
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:18.200]  you name it we're honored to have you with us again marcola m-e-r-c-o-l-a.com and the
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.520]  the reason you're the most respected of all the alternative health researchers in my opinion
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:28.040]  is because you just go off the real research and there's so much to cover but what can you say about
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.560]  i mean my view i don't know what's your view but certainly from what i see on the ground
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:39.960]  there is a collapse of confidence in the system everything we talked about last year about the
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:45.560]  h1n1 lowering your immunity being dangerous that's now mainstream news british medical journal
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:55.080]  i mean there is a collapse of confidence in this corrupt system and the establishment is
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:00.200]  responding in a lot of strange ways but it does look like the dam has broken what's your view on that
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:06.280]  well i think we're making progress there still is a a large contingency of the public who is
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:12.680]  still fooled and deceived by the very effective marketing tactics that these industry employ
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:17.080]  i mean they they literally generate many tens of hundreds of billions of dollars in profit
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:22.840]  and they're able to really hire the most sophisticated and clever marketers on the
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:27.480]  planet so they it's a really sophisticated system it's really difficult to break out of that mold
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:31.480]  but once you yourself have an injury or if the system fails you then you're really
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:36.920]  seeking more more sound logical rational alternatives that really don't rely on
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:44.200]  extensive and toxic approaches that could could literally kill you and i see the statistics in
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:52.200]  the numbers of 300 000 dying from drug interactions uh hundreds of thousands from infections i mean
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:58.440]  boy i i tell you this mainline health care is one of the biggest killers out there rivaling
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:03.800]  even automobile accidents on your radar screen what do you see is the biggest threats out there is
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:11.240]  it sodium fluoride in the water bisphenol a gmo cell phone radiation i mean you cover it all the
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:16.920]  stuff as i said earlier you were covering 10 years ago is now just all over the mainstream news
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:21.960]  well it's a good question i'm not sure if there's anyone that sticks out it's
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:28.520]  really a combination of them but i think probably just a concept and the belief that the traditional
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:35.080]  model is the approach for health care challenges that that is the relying on a drug and we're
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:42.200]  bombarded on that of course from the media they spend over 16 billion dollars a year to do direct
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:46.280]  to consumer advertising on tv and you know united states is only one of two countries in the world
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:52.680]  that allows that we're even legal so it's really they really manipulated the public to both the
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:58.120]  belief system that this is the approach because these drugs are are almost universally uh going
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.520]  to cause some type of side effect if not death i mean it's routine i mean if obvious just killed
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:08.600]  80 000 people before that buy it killed 60 000 and and and these are the ones that we know that
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:16.440]  are really gonna do i mean there's there's dozens of others that are less toxic so and it's so much
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:23.000]  it's choosing that system and that approach and you're ignoring the basic practical strategies
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.080]  that one can can use which of course doesn't generate profit and revenue for these large
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:33.640]  industries so i think it's a belief in that model that's the most dangerous the most dangerous threat
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:40.680]  yeah well i agree with you and when i watch these drug ads it's it's absurdist it's like
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:44.920]  they're openly admitting this drug is probably going to kill you oh you're having trouble sleeping
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:49.720]  or you're having trouble you know needing to urinate a lot uh and they'll tell you 10 seconds
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:54.120]  how great it is but then they say it may not be right for you causes heart attack sudden death
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:11:01.400]  brain damage uh i mean it's it's it's bizarre uh and and then ask your doctor about this drug
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:06.600]  i mean it's it's sometimes i'm pinching myself wondering if i'm having a bad dream
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.320]  let's start and they you know it really you know you look at these it's been on for 15 years but
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:28.760]  prior to 1995 those ads did not exist in the media it was illegal but then they they lobby congress
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:33.560]  and that we're able to get permission to air those meanwhile they're always waging war
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:40.840]  against alternative medicine or even vitamins and minerals now they're demonizing you know vitamin
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:47.160]  d it just gets crazier and crazier well it wasn't so much a demonizing but the institute of medicine
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:54.760]  came out with a report last week which really essentially ignored the the stacks of new studies
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:12:01.400]  and research that promote that the established vitamin d is a very useful uh uh approach and
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:06.840]  over 2000 diseases and they only focused on bone health which we've known about for about 100 years
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:11.400]  and they ignored all the rest of the research and virtually no vitamin d experts were on the panel
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:16.520]  and it was really a travesty so you know it's hard to nail a specific conspiracy but there's
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:21.080]  some actually lawsuits against this this recommendation because it's really deceiving the
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:26.280]  public and and uh not allowing them to fully utilize this incredible resource which is
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:31.320]  about one of the least expensive vitamins you can possibly purchase and one of the way has
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.400]  probably the most significant impact on your health sure but i mean my demon eyes i was thinking of
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:42.760]  dr dina dell uh who i mean i listened to him and just almost everything he says is patently
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:48.280]  false and he was just flipping out and saying that you know it's bad to take most vitamins and
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:53.160]  then we don't need them but but then i look at all the studies about vitamin and mineral deficiency
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:59.560]  and what a big problem it is doc going through the articles that i see you uh posting and and
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:04.120]  that your great researchers are putting together that link to all the mainline medical studies
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:09.400]  that are out there it's not just bisphenol a we've got to worry about you've been reporting on the
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:15.960]  other chemicals that are in the liners of the wrappers around hamburgers and other things
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:20.760]  uh that are causing serious problems can you go over what bisphenol a and now these other
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:25.000]  chemicals are and what the studies show they're doing well the article you're referring to we
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.280]  posted last week a study that came out that showed that these wrappers which are usually put in place
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:35.960]  to prevent the grease and oil in the fast food from leaking out that they would if you use regular
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:41.800]  paper uh they're the sticky coating and you see some of it too also on the microwavable
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:46.920]  microwavable popcorn so these the way they're able to do that is really similar to how they
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:52.680]  achieve a non-stick surface which is they put a fluorinated chemical compound and this uh
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:59.000]  fluorine compound uh actually dissociation it migrates into the food so you're actually
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.640]  eating these these compounds when you do that that's definitely uh not going to be chlorine that
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:08.600]  sounds like fluoride yes well it's a fluoride compound there's no question well they just love
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:13.400]  to give us fluoride i guess because they love us well it's pretty useful chemicals it's a really
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:19.640]  interesting uh innovation to have a material that you could fry food with and not to pick but it
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:24.520]  does it at quite a price you know i use typically when i'm lecturing tell people if they have any
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:30.760]  non-stick finishes to either find a relative or a neighbor they don't like to give it to them because
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:35.320]  the stuff is toxic attack but actually it's not that toxic as long as you don't eat it
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:41.000]  but the moment you eat it you start to volatilize this this fluoride and it goes into a gas and
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.080]  it can cause health problems and it's so much so that if you're in a closed environment you
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:50.840]  can actually kill pet birds i mean this stuff is really toxic oh i'm sure it's an accident they're
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:57.320]  doing this also the report on the bisphenol a is in most or 40 percent and they said oh 60 percent
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:02.120]  of the of the printer ink so i guess i'm touching it right here right now i mean this stuff is just
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:07.240]  everywhere well and it's sort of stealth too and when you go to the grocery store and you get these
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:13.000]  receipts it's it's on those receipts so you know you want to be really minimize your contact with
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.680]  those now the good news is what four states have passed laws to start restricting this at least
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.840]  for children they're pointing out that it's in the baby bottles is again you did a decade ago
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:28.920]  plus so we're starting to move in a good direction but now we're finding out that this stuff is just
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.760]  everywhere it's pervasive there's no question it is and it's like from the bisphenol a you have
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.880]  the phthalates which is a chemical that's added in the manufacturing of plastics make it pliable so
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:45.960]  any plastic that's flexible have these phthalates in there that's another chemical that's loaded
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:59.800]  with complication that that also should be bad
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:07.720]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:13.320]  to not relive history is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:19.480]  americans at home it's a tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:25.800]  calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:31.560]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held

[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:11.400]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:16.200]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:21.480]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:26.440]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:31.880]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:37.000]  grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five

[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:08.680]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:16.200]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:28.760]  so dr mark cola americola you get the same intel that i'm receiving i mean they admit the media
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:33.400]  the thyroid dysfunctions off the charts but perhaps you can talk about those numbers but
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:39.400]  just women everywhere uh talk show host you name it young women i hear them talking about it i see
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:44.120]  women all over the place you can see their hair falling out i mean how much more obvious does this
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:51.880]  poison environment uh have to get uh please continue breaking that down well the bulk of
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:56.600]  the people that experience it they're women it's my guess is it's certainly the majority of women
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:01.560]  but perhaps 75 80 percent of women have some challenge with it and if your listeners are
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:06.680]  interested in finding out if they have a problem they certainly go online our website or google it
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:11.080]  and find out what the symptoms are but there's a blood test you can take it's called tsh which is
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:15.240]  short for thyroid stimulant hormone and of course the normal conventional lab tests
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:22.120]  normal ranges are off but if your lumber comes back below 1.5 and it's okay it's above 1.5 it'll be
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:26.920]  probably most likely have a problem but you'll be told that you're okay if it's if it's below
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:31.400]  five so there's this range where almost all the conventional doctors are misunderstanding
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:36.920]  and it's interpreting the results so it's far more common than than traditionally believed
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:42.920]  so what do you do get off these things that uh have the fluorines and fluorides uh in it stop
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:47.640]  using the non-stick stop uh you know drinking out of the bisphine allay stop drinking the
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:53.240]  florida water stop bathing in it uh i mean are there ways to heal the fluoride toothpaste and
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:57.160]  you know the flower you know you can't have brominated flower that definitely
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:04.280]  so no white flower no bleach a flower right bro it'll say brominated on it so though you have
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:08.840]  to stop the assault to your body that's one but then the detoxification can be somewhat of a
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:13.800]  challenge and you know the the key thing is if you have serious thyroid issues most likely you're
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:19.720]  placed on a synthetic version of thyroid hormone which is called a most commonly synthroid uh or
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:25.480]  levophoride but uh these are not the best the best is the natural phyrite hormone which is called
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:31.240]  typically armor thyroid or desiccated thyroid which which will solve the problem and hope will
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:37.480]  allow you to start a process is that the one that's from cows yes it's typically from cows right
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:43.320]  or pig i think it's from pig yeah it's porcine it's from pig the most common ones from pig yeah i don't
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:48.680]  know i i i just did some research and saw them promoting and selling desiccated cal thyroid
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:53.400]  was but i'm saying i i think that's a better one but it's somewhat hard to find ah the most
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:23:00.760]  kind of armor thyroid is from pig and and i guess you go to a doctor or clinic and then they test
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:04.680]  your blood those are prescription yeah the most of the time you're going to get the test through
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:09.240]  through a licensed health care professional and those specific supplements do have to be
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:13.240]  prescription at least the united states of course you can be creative and go online and purchase
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:18.520]  these things overseas without a prescription and then the women start to uh see their hair
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.840]  come back from the research i've looked at but you notice when you search these terms
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.520]  you mainly find people that want to do hair restoration or they want to
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:32.120]  sell you mudoxidil they don't want to tell you you know it's just like mainline medical science
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:38.200]  they want to treat the illness instead of or treat the symptoms instead of actually treating
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:44.200]  the underlying cause correct that tends to be the common pattern yes well that is cold blooded
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:48.840]  so for all you women out there wonder why your hair is falling out at age 30 uh now you know are
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:56.360]  there any other uh causal things that people can knock out uh and uh from your research i mean how
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:02.680]  much of the women's hair comes back well it's variable uh a good percentage of them will and
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:07.720]  one of the other components that uh it really is an important element and really what i believe
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:11.960]  is the primary cause of obesity in this country and it's you know it's clear and obvious that
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:16.840]  you walk down any urban area uh city and you'll find that two or three people are overweight
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:21.560]  i mean it's really massive but epidemic that we're going and and it's relatively recent and
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:29.320]  i believe it's related to the manufacture of fructose uh from uh done done cheaply when they
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:34.040]  figured the science to be how to do that in the mid 70s and it's just per it's just pervaded the
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:39.400]  food supply so this fructose is a sugar is just just absolutely horrendous now let's talk about
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:44.760]  high fructose because now they're running ads where the smart woman because they know women buy
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:49.560]  about 80 percent of the products it's always a woman telling a man off or telling another woman
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:55.880]  off that oh it's a conspiracy theory that high fructose is bad corn syrup is good for you uh but
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:01.080]  then there's all these mainline studies with the diabetes and what it does to our metabolic systems
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:08.760]  dr marcola break down what the high fructose is doing why it's different from sugar well sugar
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:13.400]  or sucrose which you can get from cane to beet uh it used to be the common way that we got sugar
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:17.880]  in this country is it's really similar there's not a lot of difference between the two uh
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:24.680]  because simple sugar is 50% fructose and 50% glucose or dextrose so uh from that perspective
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:28.920]  it's a problem and if you get high fructose corn syrup it's about the same ratio that there are
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.840]  two differences one is in the in high fructose corn syrup it's a it's a simple sugar and it's
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:37.800]  dissociated it's not bonded together with the glucose so it's absorbed a little more quickly
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:43.880]  but the primary reason why it's such a problem is it's so darn cheap and and people
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:48.840]  are putting into everything so the numbers are going through the roof of what people are consuming
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:53.800]  you know at 1900 alex the average person only consumed about 15 grams of fructose and that
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:59.880]  was mostly in the forms of fruits healthy fruit uh but now about 25 percent of population is
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:05.800]  consuming more than 135 grams a day well more than 10 times what what the average person was consuming
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:11.560]  mere 100 years ago so it has significant metabolic problems and you know that so if you're if you
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:14.920]  have a problem that's challenged with this diet or really any health problem cancer high blood
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:19.480]  pressure diabetes high cholesterol that one of the most important things you can do is get off
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:23.240]  the fructose and the most common you know this is really a shock i'm sure many of your listeners
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:29.080]  realize is the most common source of calories in the united states most common source it's fructose
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:34.760]  typically in the form of of a soda so that's a simple thing to eliminate and once you get that
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:38.920]  out of your diet then uh you know your your health starts moving in the right direction so you got
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:47.800]  to hit the basics it's really essential oh wow uh dr uh joseph murkola is our guest and we're
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:51.640]  going to tell you more about his uh website as we talked to him i want to go to some calls here
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:58.520]  soon it's a murkola dot com take control of your health just amazing research and information uh
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:03.880]  more and more mainline studies are having to admit in the u.s in europe as you know that
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:10.520]  frequency pollution is a big problem uh and that the studies are showing with pregnant women you
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:17.720]  name it it's it's it's it's really uh causing serious issues with the fetuses uh from your wide
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:25.880]  spectrum research give us your brief take on frequency pollution well these uh are definitely
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:29.800]  a challenge because we're going to get an explosion most people don't realize that cell phones are
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:35.400]  relatively recent innovation you know before 25 years ago they didn't exist anywhere in the world
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:40.760]  and uh you know i think within the 90s or late 90s we had a billion cell phones and then
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:46.280]  we're up to four billion now so where we this is a relatively recent exposure to this radiation
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:53.480]  and just like smoking i think it's really the most powerful uh simple analogy these exposures
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:59.400]  don't cause a problem intuitively in other words it takes time to have this exposure before you're
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:03.960]  going to notice the difference you don't get lung cancer after smoking a one pack of cigarettes
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.960]  you know it takes many years if not decades to have that exposure before you have a problem
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:13.320]  and a complication so similarly exposure to these cell phones it's going to take five ten
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:17.480]  twenty thirty years before you're going to see an increase in in the consequences of the health
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.880]  problems and the primary ones are going to be brain cancers and we've already seen this today
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:25.560]  but it's going to be exploding it's going to just like lung cancer exploded we're going to see an
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:30.440]  explosion of brain cancers because of the use of these uh these cell phone devices well it's
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:34.920]  being reported again like ap Reuters you name it that they're already seeing that

[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:09.640]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:14.520]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:20.120]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:25.160]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:30.280]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:34.440]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:39.800]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:44.280]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:09.480]  direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:15.000]  we've got it
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.960]  waging war on corruption
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:28.040]  it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:39.640]  even a decade ago saying we didn't know this caused cancer we're not even saying it does
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:45.320]  cause cancer and you go back 50 years ago they said they had doctors on tv and lab ghosts doing
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:52.840]  having a sore throat smoke and extra merit sure and the telecommunications industry is a far bigger
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:57.240]  and more powerful industry than the smoky than the tobacco industry there's no comparison i think
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:03.240]  it may be one order of magnitude uh larger so they have a lot more uh income and power to play
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:10.600]  with and manipulate the perception what are some of the i mean there's so many things to talk about
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:16.920]  what are some of the other things that are on your radar well i i you know i really believe
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:22.440]  that the reliance on drugs is a solution for health is a problem uh well the primary issues
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:30.760]  that we face and the most significant concern is that uh is becoming progressively more expensive
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:35.800]  for the drug companies to actually have these drugs approved and then even once they're approved
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:40.520]  then they have to defend lawsuits typically resulting in billions if not tens of billions
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:45.080]  of dollars for the consequence of people taking them so there's this gradual because of those two
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:49.800]  two elements there's this gradual shift towards a model where they're not using drugs anymore
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:55.640]  they're they're going to be using vaccines which because of the legislation passed uh
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:01.320]  about 25 years ago they are exempted from any prosecution and they're a lot easier to pass
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:06.760]  so uh you know they're they're they're they're going to manipulate the whole system so that
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:12.120]  they're actually not voluntary so that you either become mandatory so there's tens of billions of
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:17.720]  dollars of profit there's this gradual shift i mean there's probably hundreds or more vaccines
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:22.040]  that are in the pipeline right now for for targeting for our population and that's really
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:26.840]  concerned i just learned something new i mean i know about all the new classes of vaccines that
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:34.680]  cure depression or and that's a quote or smoking or cocaine or or anger or or or vaccines that make
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:39.320]  you calm and not have anxiety anymore and i go read the different patents most of them are
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:46.200]  literally genetically engineered viruses or the equivalent of nanotech that go in and destroy the
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:51.800]  neurons so that you can't even receive those different chemicals in your brain i mean this is
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:59.160]  the equivalent of a uh you know viral uh uh lobotomy they have other types that create plaques
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:04.600]  other types that then attack hormones and i want you to speak to this but i had never put two and
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:10.120]  two together that's why they admit they're moving almost exclusively to vaccines because that'll be
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:18.280]  the new delivery system via manipulation of your body of pharmacia and they've got this body of law
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:24.440]  with the vaccine damage fund and the national security angle that is nightmarish so what specifically
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:30.040]  can you say about them coming out and saying look we got a vaccine that will cure you being upset
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:35.960]  but then it blocks your endorphins i mean this is scary well it's just it's immunity from prosecution
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:40.360]  that's the most concerned because they can really tell these things and in the case of last year of
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:44.120]  the swine for which i think is you know our site's been around for 12 years but i think our most
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:50.120]  significant contribution is really being a primary catalyst for educating consumers that the vaccine
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:55.640]  was not met and as a result of that uh 70 percent of the u.s. public chose not to get the vaccine
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:00.360]  despite the president coming out and you were vindicated because everything you and many others
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:05.160]  talked about came out to be absolutely right and the right is it's so easy to predict these things
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:09.960]  out i mean especially with the flu because we have we all we have to do is look at australia which
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:14.360]  is literally six months ahead of us you look at their their experience and we're going to exactly
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:20.040]  replicate it there's no mystery this is not rocket that's right they had deaths they had massive
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:24.680]  brain damage old neurological and they didn't have the epidemics that they were projecting so i mean
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:28.360]  you can predict these things six months ahead was virtually a hundred percent accuracy but they
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:32.760]  wouldn't they don't want you to understand that so it's pretty simple stuff once you understand the
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:42.440]  basics right if i'm wrong almost all flues start in the other hemisphere or in or in asia and and
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:49.080]  so so we really should always know what type of flu is coming around the bend and and any type of
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:53.160]  and the flu or any infectious disease for the most part is not something to be
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:56.840]  distressed about because if you're following healthy lifestyle and if you go to my site
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:02.280]  just on the homepage we've got a whole 40 page report on how you can there's no charge for how you
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:06.760]  can optimize your lifestyle based on beginner, intermediate, advanced models and and one of
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:10.760]  the most important things you could do is optimize your vitamin D levels we touched on it earlier but
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:15.880]  i mean if your vitamin D levels are normal or optimal over 50 nanograms per milliliter
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:20.440]  you're going to be resistant to the vast majority of infectious diseases if you're cutting out the
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:25.240]  sugar and you're exercising you're sleeping well drinking clean water today we talk it's virtually
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:30.280]  impossible to get sick i mean just don't get sick you don't forget about the vaccine you don't have
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:34.840]  to worry about even any downtime because colds or blues in the winter comes and i can't tell you
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:39.640]  it was just almost universal the responses that we get from people who adopt these strategies
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:44.680]  and change your lifestyle and and and they can experience this you know relief from these infectious
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:50.760]  diseases but then going back to what happened last year as you know but i'd like you to speak to
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:58.040]  this doctor murkola they did canadian studies and others that showed if you took the h1n1 vaccine
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:05.320]  it lowered your immunity by 50 percent to the regular seasonal yeah quantify that from what
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:11.960]  doctor blalock and others have said here medical doctors that that basically it your body gets
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:16.840]  overwhelmed then it doesn't know how to respond to a real threat you're absolutely correct if you
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:23.720]  get the swine flu it the studies have conclusively proven that it actually increases your risk for
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:28.760]  getting to regular seasonal flu so what do you think they did in the united states i think in
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:33.480]  most of the countries of the world with the flu vaccine this year they combine them both and you
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:39.240]  don't have a choice if you get one you get the other so it's beyond crazy what they're doing
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:43.240]  but it makes perfect sense if you're one of the executives of the drug industry because
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:48.920]  you're going to be reaping profit and obviously they want a captive audience they go lobby billions
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:53.160]  of dollars to your state and federal legislature and more and more we're seeing the government
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:58.680]  attempt to try to force vaccines on people and they're coming out with hundreds of new vaccines
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:03.800]  as you pointed out medicine is shifting over almost entirely two vaccines because of the
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:10.920]  liability protection this is a nightmare but at the same time record low numbers of people
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:16.920]  took the flu shot it's starting to the same thing this year uh how do you see the system
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:21.480]  striking back i mean they want to make their hundreds of billions and because of mercola
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:26.600]  and info wars dot com and all the other great people out there uh folks are waking up what do
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:33.000]  you see the establishment doing so i don't know i don't really get into those projections too much
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.040]  but you know they're going to come out i mean they they're going to want to try i think the
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:39.720]  immediate threat is they're going to make it mandatory and we're partnering with one of the
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:45.400]  top uh pro vaccine safety sites in the world which is the national vaccine information center
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:51.800]  ndic.org and we're really developing a massive consumer awareness component where uh they were
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:56.600]  lobbying for people to get together in their own local communities and hit their state legislator so
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:01.960]  they they will prevent this from happening but i think that's the next big battle is to make sure
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:06.520]  right now that that we don't shift to a mandatory vaccine system because right now we have the
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:11.160]  freedom to choose not to get them even though there are essentially the freedom is somewhat
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:14.680]  nullified if you're have a child is going to school because they're going to prevent entry
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:18.920]  into both schools that must be vaccinated but you always home school or you can go to a state that
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:23.640]  doesn't require and has a philosophical exemption so it's it's uh you know it's not as bad as it
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:28.120]  could be it for sure that they get these mandatory vaccine laws get passed we're going to break her
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:33.880]  in a moment we're gonna come back and take a few calls for dr uh joseph marcola but but briefly uh
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:42.280]  what are you seeing on the front of gmo crops uh cross species chimeras uh like the gmo salmon
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:48.360]  the move to not even let us know of its gmo in the stores well it's a big big issue i think we're
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:51.560]  we're going to be very successful that we're partnering with jeffrey smith was just down
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:56.120]  dr awes yesterday and they got a very favorable response but they're just providing people the
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:59.320]  consumers can make the choice here if they can vote with their pocketbooks once they understand
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.640]  the issue they they can they can actually choose not to purchase this and then and just like they
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:08.680]  did in europe once the once that their their profits go down the people who are the industries
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:13.080]  who are manufacturing this they will choose not to so we can we can easily defeat that
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:18.280]  without any legislation without any governmental intervention so it's really simple process amazing
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:23.480]  dr marcola is our guest briefly as we go to break what are some of the other things that
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:29.080]  you're looking at right now well it's one of the most exciting one fluoride is a big issue and
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:32.760]  then also mercury which is another toxin of course and we're working with charlie brown
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:38.360]  for the consumers for dental choice to help outlaw mercury amalgam in the united states
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:43.480]  which is our one for a big project so free humanity is on the march but big pharma and
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:49.960]  there which dr cartels they're striking back i'm alex jones this is the gc n radio network gc
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:54.680]  n live dot com we're going to try to keep but dr marcola for a couple more segments to take
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:58.760]  your calls and i'm going to get into a big news blitz on wikileaks the economy and a lot more
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:06.840]  stay with us hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:12.360]  last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:17.560]  the rug from underneath the americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence on our president
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:23.480]  in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:29.080]  as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:35.480]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:40.440]  government tim geithner bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:45.160]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:22.200]  jones broadcasting network network we are back live ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:28.920]  you know we're talking about this phenol a one of hundreds of things in our environment hurting us
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:34.360]  the federal government admits just a little bit of it on your finger massively lowers male fertility
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:39.240]  oh i'm sure that makes john p holdren who openly says he wants to sterilize us the why house science
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:46.200]  are very upset but here's medical news today 95 percent of us paper money tainted with this phenol
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:52.840]  a and it goes on to say that it's in plastic bottles it's locked in so it's the microwaving
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:59.080]  and things that really releases it but in the money it's just like the printer ink it comes right off
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:05.880]  on you i mean dr mercola does it ever end well the challenge i mean there's certainly some benefits
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:11.640]  of living in an advanced industrial society but you know comes at a price so you need to be diligent
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:19.240]  about what those risks are minimize your exposures now getting back to the question i launched right
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:31.720]  before the break what's your view on that point well some of the diseases you mentioned that
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:37.720]  certainly are as a result of exposure to these these toxins and environmental hazards you know
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:43.880]  the ones that come to mind would be some of the mercury's exposure and the vaccine and the other
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:52.200]  tamas that are vaccine aluminum and then of course the the the dietary emphasis and lack of vitamin
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:56.120]  d is massive because you know we just we're designed we're not designed to swallow vitamin
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:01.080]  d resigned to get it from the sun but most of us in the winter that's not really a practical option
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:05.880]  so it's a combination of factors but one of the things i want to mention while remembering
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:10.120]  is some of the new research that's come up it's really pretty intriguing because the Alzheimer's
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:15.320]  as you mentioned is an increasing epidemic to the point where more than one in three people
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:19.560]  are projected to to eventually have this it's not pretty to lose your mind but we're finding
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:23.480]  that one of the best things to do is is follow a healthy lifestyle exercise get your body d
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:28.520]  levels up avoid the sugar but also even if you have Alzheimer's what's been found recently to be
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:34.120]  highly effective is coconut oil and about a tablespoon a day has been shown to produce
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:39.400]  massive improvement in a number of people and and really get their their sanity back at their
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:43.720]  brain function which is really quite extraordinary to consider how simple foods like this can
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:49.240]  get such a powerful benefit well i mean isn't food really the original medicine i mean what's
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:57.000]  what we're designed to eat well but but there seems to be some specific benefit to coconut
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  with respect to how biochemically interacts the brain and providing sort of bypasses some
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.120]  of the dysfunctions that occurs in advanced degenerative brain disease so it's particularly
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:10.120]  intriguing i couldn't agree more and you know one of the good strategies you could also use
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:15.080]  if i highly recommend people consider would be organic vegetable juice you know good good
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:20.920]  eight to 16 ounces a day of fresh organic vegetables not so much the fruits but the
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:26.040]  vegetables the green ones would have days of celery cucumbers and adding some wine to decrease
[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:30.360]  the bitterness of some of the dark greens like kale and collards and really provide a whole
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:37.480]  path about about beneficial biochemicals that will really push your body towards health we've
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:43.160]  all got to make the commitment um you know back over 10 years ago i was in really good shape and
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:47.000]  then i just got out of shape and it's very hard to get back into shape and start eating properly
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:52.520]  again but i'm slowly moving there but this it's something that freedom lovers all have to do i
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:57.720]  mean this revolution against tyranny starts with our bodies uh let's take another call from
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:03.160]  donna in california we got to move quick now donna you're on the air with dr joseph mercola go ahead
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:11.160]  oh great hi alex hi first time caller hi dr mercola i'm here in palm springs california as you
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:17.560]  said i'm just very excited to be on air and i appreciate you taking my call and i'm a first
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:24.040]  time uh subscriber uh just started listening to you and i'm spreading the word um just wanted to
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:29.480]  let you know that i'm out calling these companies about the best female a and all this other stuff
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:35.960]  so i try to do it one or two a day before i go to work awesome anyway um i just want to thank you
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:39.800]  and i appreciate you guys and keep up the good work and if there's anything i can do give me a
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:44.760]  call all right well you're a sweetheart do you have any questions for our i thought yeah actually i
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:51.240]  do alex thanks um i was curious about because you've talked about the best female in the plastics
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:56.040]  and i'm looking at my cupboards and my storage and i've got all these canned goods and things that
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:52:03.640]  are in plastic is there a way to know exactly which ones to get rid of and you know is there a
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:08.600]  list of plastic companies or whatever we shouldn't be well that's another great point the little juice
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:15.880]  boxes uh most of the things like capri sun you name it they have plastic lining in them and a lot
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:22.200]  of them it it's made of bisphenol a correct dr. murkola yeah it's the general principle is
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:26.120]  as far as i understand that 90 percent of the money that americans spend on foods it's her
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:30.440]  processed foods and when you process the foods there's a risk because you have to package it
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:34.680]  the way that's going to store it and most of these packaging materials are fraught with dangers so
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:38.760]  you know it's small occasionally exposure is not going to be a big issue but on a regular basis
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:44.120]  you really want to move away from that find find foods they're packaging glass uh that's keeping
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:49.000]  another element that is commonly overlooked is that these vegetables and fruits once you package
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:55.560]  them and process them uh normally uh they have methanol but it's it's it's combined with pectin
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:53:00.680]  and the fruit or vegetable and if you eat it raw or fresh not a problem but once you package it
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:05.240]  this methanol gradually associates methanol is another term for wood alcohol and it can cause
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:10.280]  significant neurological complications so really the general take-home message is stay away from
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:15.080]  processed foods as much as possible make your food fresh you know i didn't know that till a few
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:20.680]  months ago but uh correct me if i'm wrong what you're saying is that when you take canned peaches
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:27.400]  or whatever the case may be uh the natural uh things in it starts breaking down into something
[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:33.160]  toxic well it it's liberated these bodies normally it's connected in a way that doesn't
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:36.680]  cause a problem in your body because it doesn't have anything to dissociate it but but it breaks
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:41.960]  down spontaneously once it's processed over time so long it is the worst a problem and you can
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:46.440]  have significant complications affect many researchers believe it's a it's a primary
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:52.920]  fair factor for the cause of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases amazing uh donna
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:56.280]  god bless let's talk to larry and california larry here on the air
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:07.560]  hello hello elix hey hey elix uh i'm an ex convict there and i'm telling you man uh
[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:15.560]  quit uh bad mouth and a sex convict here in california all right larry i appreciate your call
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:20.120]  i know that's a prank call i don't really talk too much about ex convicts uh but good to hear
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:25.320]  from you larry uh let's talk to chris and maryland that we don't screen our calls folks uh chris and
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:30.040]  maryland you're on the air with dr marcolla hey guys i'm finally glad to finally get on it's hard
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:36.520]  to get on here but my question for your guest is is that i was uh uh seriously operated on
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:42.280]  by the military and i have a feeling that i might be a goner but if marshal law is called i told my
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:48.520]  wife and kids that we will bug out of here to get away from the populated areas and since they took
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:54.360]  out my terminal ileum and i have b12 deficiency is there's some way that i can bypass that to get
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:55:00.040]  the b12 because i have a feeling if i don't get it i'll be a dead man well you eventually you'll
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:04.200]  die but before that you'll become blind and develop other neurological complications but you're right
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:09.000]  the b12 is a very large vitamin the largest ones we know and it's required to combine with the
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.680]  intrinsic factor and be observed in the terminal ileum which has been surgically respected
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:19.800]  in your case so the bypass of that is to take an injectable form of vitamin b12 once a week or so
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:24.600]  or well our site we actually have a spray which is spray under your tongue that absorbs self-lingually
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:28.600]  and you didn't bypass with the expense of the convenience of having to do it at a shot every
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:34.360]  week so but you can't swallow it it won't be absorbed so that's the key okay so but will
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:39.080]  it still get into my body without an injection i mean can i use that if you spray it sublingually it
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:47.880]  will okay underneath your tongue you know if it goes into your uh saliva glands correct yeah well
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:51.720]  there's there's a capillary underneath your tongue that just is a direct absorption into the blood
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:56.920]  stream so you don't have to absorb it through your yeah that's why folks chew tobacco it's it's a
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:02.600]  great way to get the drug in yeah whether you can put out the information alex where i can get some
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:08.600]  of this or some of us who have this problem absolutely i just said mercola website dot
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:14.360]  com has it uh and and and there's a lot of other products out there so i i appreciate your call
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:19.400]  uh let's go ahead now and talk to gabriel en masse gabriel you're on the air
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:31.400]  hello yes sir hey alex i want to talk about gmo uh soy and corn about 90 percent of uh everything
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:37.160]  we buy in the stores is got if you give me i'm really nervous okay we're almost out of time
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:43.560]  though go ahead but everything in the stores you buy is got a genetically modified soy or
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:50.680]  corn derivatives or resistant it's got pesticide resistant bacteria in it and it stays in our gut
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:57:01.400]  yes and the animals that eat it we eat these animals and uh yeah yeah we're in deep trouble i
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:08.120]  appreciate your call uh it is incredible uh in closing dr mercola comment on what he was saying
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:13.640]  well gmo is an issue it's an over 90 percent of the corn and soy so you really want to avoid
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:19.240]  so those foods that really you go to our side we've got a to type that in and jeffrey smith has
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:25.160]  put together a gmo free shopping guide so that you can vote with your pocketbook and not purchase
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:30.200]  these products and that's going to be the most powerful action you can take as a consumer to get
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:46.120]  this stuff off the market
