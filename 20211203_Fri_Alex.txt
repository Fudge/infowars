[00:00.000 --> 00:27.200]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:27.200 --> 00:35.600]  It was decided by the WHO in early 2021 to use the Greek alphabet as a means of naming
[00:35.600 --> 00:41.800]  the many COVID-19 variants that they somehow knew were coming down the pike.
[00:41.800 --> 00:46.680]  Delta wasn't the first alleged variant of COVID, and there have supposedly been eight
[00:46.680 --> 00:48.840]  new variants since.
[00:48.840 --> 00:55.040]  Omicron is merely the next one chosen to stir up fear via the corporate-run media.
[00:55.040 --> 01:00.640]  Delta and Omicron may be the result of India and South Africa vying for independence over
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.120]  their own health protocols in October of 2020.
[01:05.120 --> 01:11.160]  But either way, they skipped two letters of the Greek alphabet, new and ji.
[01:11.160 --> 01:12.960]  The reason seems likely.
[01:12.960 --> 01:20.160]  They skipped new because saying the new variant sounds exactly like saying the new variant.
[01:20.160 --> 01:26.960]  And the ji variant sounds as if we are naming it after ji jing ping, which would be fitting,
[01:26.960 --> 01:31.080]  but the WHO obviously isn't going to do that.
[01:31.080 --> 01:36.280]  So it ended up as Omicron, which is also interesting.
[01:36.280 --> 01:39.920]  Omicron is symbolized by the eye.
[01:39.920 --> 01:46.040]  Anagrams of Omicron are moronic, which you would have to be if you were still going along
[01:46.040 --> 01:47.960]  with any of this.
[01:47.960 --> 01:55.720]  Oncomers are small, endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally.
[01:55.720 --> 02:02.640]  They are part of the body's natural reaction to splicing and gene editing, and are specifically
[02:02.640 --> 02:06.000]  associated with cancer.
[02:06.000 --> 02:13.400]  In 1963, the Italian film Omicron was released, about an alien taking over a person's body
[02:13.400 --> 02:20.360]  to recon the planet for a future invasion, produced by Lux Films, which translates to
[02:20.360 --> 02:23.280]  Lucifer, the lightbearer.
[02:23.280 --> 02:30.120]  In 2013, the film The Visitor from Planet Omicron was released, about a corrupt government
[02:30.120 --> 02:34.960]  that sends an alien to Earth to deliver a virus.
[02:34.960 --> 02:40.200]  If you add the word delta, as in the other big media hyped variant, then you have the
[02:40.200 --> 02:43.800]  anagram media control.
[02:43.800 --> 02:57.640]  This all reminds me of reverse speech, such as the famous Obama slogan, Yes We Can.
[02:57.640 --> 03:09.000]  That when played in reverse, sounds like Thank You Satan.
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.960]  And when you play Omicron backwards, you get what some people are claiming sounds like,
[03:13.960 --> 03:20.280]  Lock Him Up.
[03:20.280 --> 03:24.720]  As if referring to their psychopathic patsy, Anthony Fauci.
[03:24.720 --> 03:25.720]  Weird coincidence?
[03:25.720 --> 03:27.920]  Are we living in the Matrix?
[03:27.920 --> 03:31.400]  Or is it simply Syop Voodoo Trickery?
[03:31.400 --> 03:36.160]  Whatever it is, there is no escape from any of this madness, until enough people wake
[03:36.160 --> 03:38.720]  up and say no.
[03:38.720 --> 04:04.960]  Thanks to you kids, we now know the virus is a hoax.
[04:04.960 --> 04:09.400]  They include flu, pneumonia, and other infections to boost the numbers.
[04:09.400 --> 04:11.120]  Let's find out who is really behind it all.
[04:11.120 --> 04:14.600]  Like, President Trump is definitely behind one of these phantoms.
[04:14.600 --> 04:15.600]  She's pink?
[04:15.600 --> 04:16.600]  Dr. Fauci?
[04:16.600 --> 04:26.320]  Like, I thought doctors were supposed to help people, not scare them.
[04:26.320 --> 04:28.320]  Microsoft's new gates?
[04:28.320 --> 04:33.560]  Not only a computer guy, he's a notorious vaccine pusher who wants to reduce the world's
[04:33.560 --> 04:34.560]  population.
[04:34.560 --> 04:39.120]  I get it, so Bill Gates wanted to vaccinate everyone after Fauci convinced them there was
[04:39.120 --> 04:40.840]  a deadly disease outbreak.
[04:40.840 --> 04:41.840]  That's diabolical.
[04:41.840 --> 04:43.880]  Yeah, that sounds pretty bad.
[04:43.880 --> 04:48.520]  Don't worry kids, these globalists won't get away with their pandemic hoax this time,
[04:48.520 --> 04:53.200]  where they're going, they'll be locked up for a long good while, in the big house.
[04:53.200 --> 04:54.200]  Yeah!
[04:54.200 --> 05:00.680]  Better than a rock round at home.
[05:00.680 --> 05:06.080]  We have launched the most important sale of the year, because now we've got a bunch
[05:06.080 --> 05:09.200]  of great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in

[06:35.680 --> 06:45.960]  They really got us, they've got us, they've got us, and the question is, do you want to
[06:45.960 --> 06:51.800]  get out of their jaws before the process of our destruction is completed?
[06:51.800 --> 06:58.520]  This is Modern War, and you're the target.
[06:58.520 --> 07:09.200]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this Friday, December 3rd, Worldwide Transmission.
[07:09.200 --> 07:13.240]  I think the best way for me to begin the broadcast is just to read you headlines and then to
[07:13.240 --> 07:19.720]  plow back into them in great detail, but here's the larger takeaway.
[07:19.720 --> 07:26.160]  The puppet Joe Biden came out yesterday, and then his surrogates repeated it with more
[07:26.160 --> 07:31.520]  detail, and said he'll do everything, quote, in his power to make sure newborns are given
[07:31.520 --> 07:34.760]  access to the COVID injections.
[07:34.760 --> 07:41.920]  Now, once they give emergency authorization, and then once you, quote, get access, that
[07:41.920 --> 07:53.360]  means the next day, Chicago, New York, Boston, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, and other
[07:53.360 --> 08:01.400]  leftist cities, announce it's mandatory.
[08:01.400 --> 08:07.400]  No judge, no jury, no law, just like his mandate on businesses with 100 or more employees,
[08:07.400 --> 08:13.280]  it's just pulled out of the air, not even an executive order.
[08:13.280 --> 08:19.400]  Just the decree of the king who takes his orders, as he said, from Fauci.
[08:19.400 --> 08:22.360]  He said, yeah, give my wife to Fauci, you know, really, he's the boss, he's the real
[08:22.360 --> 08:25.440]  president, Fauci.
[08:25.440 --> 08:27.760]  I'm just joking, no, actually, I mean it.
[08:27.760 --> 08:33.800]  That's another quote from yesterday, basically nailed it, it's not even a paraphrase.
[08:33.800 --> 08:38.360]  So there we are.
[08:38.360 --> 08:40.520]  So if you translate that, what's that really mean?
[08:40.520 --> 08:45.960]  I'm going to forcibly inject newborns, we already got above the 12-year-olds in the
[08:45.960 --> 08:50.040]  mass of death, heart attacks, illness, now it's the five-year-olds enough, and Obama
[08:50.040 --> 08:54.920]  and Fauci, they come like ghouls and have salivated at least three elementary schools
[08:54.920 --> 09:01.120]  while the crying children are injected, and it's so over the top, people just can't believe
[09:01.120 --> 09:08.240]  that Joseph Mingola and Hitler just came to their school, just one has brown skin, so
[09:08.240 --> 09:13.320]  it's, he's the brown Hitler, and then he's got his doctor Joseph Mingola there, 2.0
[09:13.320 --> 09:20.480]  with him, who has a long history of taking black and poor white children, there was no
[09:20.480 --> 09:25.360]  Hispanics ever in the list, I guess Hispanics would fight back, I guess, culturally, it's
[09:25.360 --> 09:28.880]  actually been found by the globalists that generally Hispanics will actually just kill
[09:28.880 --> 09:32.360]  somebody if somebody tries to take their children, but white people and black people have been
[09:32.360 --> 09:37.600]  bred and trained to submit, and so the courts know, oh, let's just get those poor black
[09:37.600 --> 09:42.040]  kids, and let's just go out to these, you know, the countryside poor single mothers with
[09:42.040 --> 09:46.400]  white kids, and let's just grab them, that's the two groups they targeted, about 80% were
[09:46.400 --> 09:50.840]  black though, look it up, thousands of articles in the 90s, back when the media still had
[09:50.840 --> 09:57.600]  some soul, that was not totally owned by four companies, and Fauci would take the children
[09:57.600 --> 10:03.160]  as young as four from their mothers, use the fake PCR tests that had just come out to say
[10:03.160 --> 10:08.440]  that they had HIV, which they didn't, and then when the children would escape, they'd
[10:08.440 --> 10:13.760]  take them and put them in lockups, and put ports into their stomachs, so that they couldn't
[10:13.760 --> 10:21.520]  get away, and they'd put toxic poisons in there till they died, but nobody cares about
[10:21.520 --> 10:26.040]  that, it's just black children, they do care about the German shepherds and beagles, having
[10:26.040 --> 10:32.280]  cages put around their heads with the flesh eating bugs under Fauci, but Fauci specifically
[10:32.280 --> 10:39.800]  ran in the 80s and 90s testing on more than 10,000 children, many of which died, it's
[10:39.800 --> 10:46.440]  over 10,000, oh, then you see the headline, oh, the CIA knowingly covered up the rape
[10:46.440 --> 10:52.320]  of children by CIA personnel, oh, and the CIA picked warlords in Afghanistan that were
[10:52.320 --> 10:57.280]  pedophiles and supplied them with children, oh, and, oh, oh, and the CIA, with the German
[10:57.280 --> 11:03.080]  government in West Germany, gave hundreds of thousands of children over 40 years from
[11:03.080 --> 11:07.160]  their parents, mainly Christian parents was the group they targeted, and gave them to
[11:07.160 --> 11:12.560]  people to create a new form of love, they called it, pure nambla, that the new family
[11:12.560 --> 11:17.160]  would be men with little boys they have sex with, and women that have sex with the little
[11:17.160 --> 11:21.640]  girls, and then teach them that that's love, so they go out and do it themselves to build
[11:21.640 --> 11:30.000]  an army, the German experiment that placed foster children with pedophiles, and you know
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.120]  what's sick about the New Yorker magazine, and what's sick about them all, DW, the biggest
[11:35.120 --> 11:39.360]  channel in Germany, reported it years before they did, and by the time it hit the U.S.,
[11:39.360 --> 11:43.240]  they limited the number down to a few thousand instead of hundreds of thousands, that's in
[11:43.240 --> 11:48.120]  the real reports, 30,000 in this city, 25,000 in that, 10,000 in this city, I mean they had
[11:48.120 --> 11:53.440]  files on this, this was government run, still ongoing, industrial level, and that's who
[11:53.440 --> 12:00.600]  wants to come to your school now, and inject your children, is the very same people, because
[12:00.600 --> 12:05.080]  I told you a thousand times, if I told you once, the globalists don't want to just rape
[12:05.080 --> 12:11.600]  your children, they want to turn them into pedophiles like them, but if they can't turn
[12:11.600 --> 12:15.640]  them into pedophiles, they're going to kill them, they're going to inject them with a
[12:15.640 --> 12:19.560]  system that erases their immune system, makes them totally sick, and the answer is more
[12:19.560 --> 12:23.280]  shots, which will finally slowly kill your children, and they want to watch you under
[12:23.280 --> 12:30.080]  orders, kill your child with them, in the greatest form of blasphemy you could ever imagine,
[12:30.080 --> 12:35.200]  giving your children the fires of Moloch, and that's their plan, I have stacks of news
[12:35.200 --> 12:40.260]  here today documenting all this, so here's just some of the headlines, Twitter slaps
[12:40.260 --> 12:47.040]  unsafe label on American Heart Association over mRNA vaccine warning, because they said
[12:47.040 --> 12:56.160]  sorry, you're not the WHO, or you are not Pfizer, Greg Reese filed a report this morning
[12:56.160 --> 13:05.680]  that just went live at Bandot Video, we'll put it on screen for you, there it is, the
[13:05.680 --> 13:15.160]  inside voodoo of the Omnicron fear campaign, it just went live a few hours ago, his Vimeo
[13:15.160 --> 13:18.920]  account has been banned and they sent him a notice, he's doing a report on it saying,
[13:18.920 --> 13:25.040]  here let me read the notice to you, actually send it to me, he sent, got sent a notice
[13:25.040 --> 13:33.240]  saying, you have been deleted for violating CDC and WHO protocol, you just wake up and
[13:33.240 --> 13:39.560]  the UN's in charge, remember that Yahoo article a few months ago about the young collegiate
[13:39.560 --> 13:44.560]  athlete who had the near heart failure and heart attack and microcarditis, after the
[13:44.560 --> 13:48.960]  Pfizer shot, his doctor said yeah, it was the Pfizer shot, and his video had 5 million
[13:48.960 --> 13:53.800]  views and they deleted his video instead of you re-upload it, it will delete your account,
[13:53.800 --> 13:58.000]  and he had his doctor go on the news and the press conference and say hey, they put on
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.040]  the insert, it causes this, this was caused by this, and they said we know you're telling
[14:02.040 --> 14:05.960]  the truth, but you're, you're hurting the overall good, because the shot does more
[14:05.960 --> 14:10.800]  good than bad, which by the way doesn't, and so you're not allowed to the UN says, we just
[14:10.800 --> 14:16.480]  sit here in America and the UN tells us what we can say and do, and now, oh sorry, that's
[14:16.480 --> 14:27.520]  not the WHO, that's not, you're not the WHO, so sorry, Twitter says to the American Heart
[14:27.520 --> 14:33.160]  Association, you're not allowed to tell your members and readers in a PSA that's your
[14:33.160 --> 14:39.000]  job that this can kill you with a heart attack, or microcard, oh no, no, no, it's true, but
[14:39.000 --> 14:49.120]  you're not allowed to talk, because you're not WHO, the World Health Organization, the
[14:49.120 --> 14:59.040]  big, evil owl that's feeding on everybody, and I have all these articles today about
[14:59.040 --> 15:03.040]  this happening, but our own Greg Reese, oh, you're not gonna show the COVID numbers, you're
[15:03.040 --> 15:10.920]  not gonna show real facts, sorry, the UN says your video's deleted, bloop, what's that mean,
[15:10.920 --> 15:17.400]  the UN's watching, and it's watching what you're doing, oh, we better roll over and
[15:17.400 --> 15:26.120]  kiss their ass now then, maybe they'll be nicer to us if we just submit, maybe if you
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.840]  chum the ocean on the Atlantic with a bunch of rotten meat and cut yourself and jump in
[15:30.840 --> 15:38.120]  with sharks, they'll be sweet to you too, so they're making a predatory move on us right
[15:38.120 --> 15:45.840]  now, they have a burning will to kill children, just an overriding desire to just rape and
[15:45.840 --> 15:51.560]  stab and just torture and make, they just love it, and they just love, they're killing
[15:51.560 --> 15:55.120]  so many children worldwide with these poison shots right now, they are just having an orgy
[15:55.120 --> 15:58.400]  of death.
[15:58.400 --> 16:02.480]  If you're concerned about the, let's go ahead and take another call, let's talk to Malcolm
[16:02.480 --> 16:03.480]  in Tennessee, welcome.
[16:03.480 --> 16:04.480]  Hello, Alex.
[16:04.480 --> 16:05.480]  Yes, Malcolm.
[16:05.480 --> 16:08.960]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the
[16:08.960 --> 16:09.960]  line.
[16:09.960 --> 16:14.040]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, Super
[16:14.040 --> 16:19.640]  Mel Vitality and Brain Force Plus, mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[16:19.640 --> 16:24.680]  Super Mel Vitality really, really works, it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[16:24.680 --> 16:30.640]  that have never been heated up, and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions,
[16:30.640 --> 16:35.040]  it also worked quite well, but just aren't as strong, this is like a very fine wine,
[16:35.040 --> 16:39.480]  it's, in fact, each batch is different, sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay,
[16:39.480 --> 16:42.720]  people are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[16:42.720 --> 16:43.720]  strong?
[16:43.720 --> 16:48.600]  Because it's how it works, so it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super
[16:48.600 --> 16:59.480]  strong, but yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[16:59.480 --> 17:04.720]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists, I wanted
[17:04.720 --> 17:10.160]  to stop their agenda, I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[17:10.160 --> 17:15.000]  before they went operational, but we failed, yes a lot of people are awake, yes we're
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.560]  not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[17:21.560 --> 17:26.400]  great reset, and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[17:26.400 --> 17:30.520]  tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[17:30.520 --> 17:34.520]  the truth, so we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda,
[17:34.520 --> 17:38.200]  and we've also got to get personally prepared, and one of the number one things to do is

[17:52.040 --> 17:56.600]  go up, and before there are long lines and waits, because believe me, serious times are
[17:56.600 --> 18:04.040]  coming, get ready at infowarstore.com, this is a great sponsor, we have one of the best
[18:04.040 --> 18:08.480]  deals you're going to find out there on a high quality, high rated, satellite phone,

[18:12.520 --> 18:16.000]  you can see the sky, you can also buy cheap antennas and things for your car and your

[18:20.760 --> 18:24.400]  folks, they supply the board for everybody, but their system is as well, they're amazing
[18:24.400 --> 18:32.200]  folks, and you get a free phone of $600 to $50 value, absolutely free at infowarstore.com,
[18:32.200 --> 18:38.880]  these aren't, and the calls are free when folks call you, you just pay $99.95 a month
[18:38.880 --> 18:43.920]  for your minutes, $115 minutes, so the calls you were free were like a regular cell phone,
[18:43.920 --> 18:47.520]  you're not being tracked or traced, and I keep one in my car, I've given it to my parents
[18:47.520 --> 18:52.200]  as gifts, way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work, infowarstore.com
[18:52.200 --> 18:59.920]  or 941-955-1029-4195, 1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[18:59.920 --> 19:05.200]  Decentive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left, it can be very stressful dealing
[19:05.200 --> 19:10.800]  with facts you refuse to accept, if you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[19:10.800 --> 19:17.080]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com, studies have
[19:17.080 --> 19:23.040]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[19:23.040 --> 19:28.600]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction
[19:28.600 --> 19:33.360]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[19:33.360 --> 19:40.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[19:40.000 --> 19:46.320]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells, it worked for my family,
[19:46.320 --> 19:53.200]  and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[19:53.200 --> 20:02.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[20:02.000 --> 20:19.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:19.120 --> 20:28.640]  This is the hill to fight on, this is the hill to die on, I'm not backing down, in fact
[20:28.640 --> 20:35.160]  I've never been more alive and more ready to do whatever it takes to defend our children,
[20:35.160 --> 20:39.800]  but we don't have any more time, our children are being killed right in front of us and
[20:39.800 --> 20:44.120]  I want to explain how psychology works and how the globalist operates so that everybody
[20:44.120 --> 20:48.760]  can get the perspective and then see it for yourself, because they don't operate like
[20:48.760 --> 20:49.760]  you and I do.
[20:49.760 --> 20:55.600]  Now listen to me very, very carefully here on the Alex Jones show.
[20:55.600 --> 21:03.280]  We are 340 days out from the midterm elections.
[21:03.280 --> 21:09.120]  They know there's going to be a tsunami bigger than it was in 2016, bigger than it was in
[21:09.120 --> 21:14.400]  last year's and this year's election as well.
[21:14.400 --> 21:21.760]  And so they are in a total and complete panic and they've got a whole array of things they're
[21:21.760 --> 21:29.120]  going to do to smoke screen and shut down society and start wars and crash economies
[21:29.120 --> 21:34.400]  so things are so out of control you just accept another stolen election.
[21:34.400 --> 21:38.640]  They are putting you into this abnormal, confused state.
[21:38.640 --> 21:43.960]  They're putting you into martial law ahead of an even deeper level of martial law that's
[21:43.960 --> 21:47.200]  coming in just 340 days.
[21:47.200 --> 21:56.560]  I told you specifically months before the 2020 election on November 3rd that they would
[21:56.560 --> 22:00.760]  then totally ban Trump off of the internet within the first week after the fraudulent
[22:00.760 --> 22:05.680]  election that they would say it was a red mirage, that they would deliver all of the
[22:05.680 --> 22:11.200]  mail-in ballots they needed to then complete the fraud, that they would then try to outlaw
[22:11.200 --> 22:13.040]  questioning the election.
[22:13.040 --> 22:19.040]  All of that happened exactly as I said because I know the enemy battle plan.
[22:19.040 --> 22:21.720]  That's why they hate me so much because I don't need to read their documents.
[22:21.720 --> 22:27.800]  I can see right through everything they're doing and so can you once you get the perspective.
[22:27.800 --> 22:32.400]  I played that video yesterday in the Florida Everglades with a family on the side of the
[22:32.400 --> 22:36.600]  road by some culverts on a creek catching fish and they're watching the fish swim around
[22:36.600 --> 22:41.640]  them the lure and they don't see a 10-foot alligator swim right up with a little 5-year-old
[22:41.640 --> 22:47.280]  girl about to eat her because they're so focused on the fish and the lure they don't
[22:47.280 --> 22:52.200]  see the big giant thing right there in front of them but once you see it you can't miss
[22:52.200 --> 22:56.120]  the alligator and the little girl finally sees it and says oh the alligator is coming
[22:56.120 --> 23:01.360]  over to me maybe he thinks I'm going to slip in no he's about to grab you.
[23:01.360 --> 23:07.320]  It's the same thing you've got to shift your perspective from the bass and the reeds and
[23:07.320 --> 23:10.720]  the lure to the 10-foot alligator.
[23:10.720 --> 23:18.720]  So I can talk about this news and this information all day long but if you don't get the perspective
[23:18.720 --> 23:22.240]  of the globalist and what they're out for because you want to go fishing the alligator
[23:22.240 --> 23:25.560]  wants to eat you.
[23:25.560 --> 23:30.720]  You want to go surfing in the Pacific Ocean the great white shark wants to eat you.
[23:30.720 --> 23:36.760]  You want to drive down the road and go see your grandma but a crazy crackhead at the
[23:36.760 --> 23:41.040]  four-way stop wants to steal a car because he's out of his mind he's about to carjack
[23:41.040 --> 23:42.880]  you.
[23:42.880 --> 23:47.080]  So don't measure the world by what you want and what you're doing and about where you're
[23:47.080 --> 23:54.840]  going start looking around and really figuring out history and how these globalists are operating.
[23:54.840 --> 23:58.960]  So before I hit all this huge news let me just lay this out and again this is about
[23:58.960 --> 24:02.960]  perspective.
[24:02.960 --> 24:08.160]  The globalists have created thousands of trillions of fake currency worldwide.
[24:08.160 --> 24:11.480]  They've engaged in all sorts of horrible, bizarre crimes to get there.
[24:11.480 --> 24:18.320]  They've used sex and pedophile rings to compromise the corporate and governmental infrastructure
[24:18.320 --> 24:23.400]  of academia, science, banking, the religious institutions basically everything.
[24:23.400 --> 24:28.280]  They've gotten control of the top and they've got unlimited fake money but they know that
[24:28.280 --> 24:32.160]  all of that's spiraling out of control and their own minions are ratting them out and
[24:32.160 --> 24:33.160]  their own people.
[24:33.160 --> 24:37.560]  Look at the fall of Hollywood is a microcosm of the fall of the house of Rothschild and
[24:37.560 --> 24:40.560]  Rockefeller and the Saxe-Coburg gophers.
[24:40.560 --> 24:46.880]  That whole facade, that whole institution is going down so it needs to trigger a world
[24:46.880 --> 24:52.120]  collapse ahead of time so that it can be in control of the collapse and use the collapse
[24:52.120 --> 24:55.280]  to maintain and expand their power.
[24:55.280 --> 24:59.880]  And that's why you've got to get in the perspective of them and what they've done.
[24:59.880 --> 25:06.760]  They've launched a modern 21st century biological and chemical war on us posing as the saviors
[25:06.760 --> 25:11.720]  in white lab coats who even created the virus itself publicly believing that you're too
[25:11.720 --> 25:16.600]  stupid to figure it out and that as things get worse and worse, as they hold your hand
[25:16.600 --> 25:20.760]  and lead you into total destruction, that you'll never be able to admit what they've
[25:20.760 --> 25:26.240]  done to you because of the mass programming of the mass Stockholm syndrome system and
[25:26.240 --> 25:29.080]  the learned helplessness.
[25:29.080 --> 25:40.400]  So I'm going to do this when we come back but I want to be totally clear about this.
[25:40.400 --> 25:48.120]  I am not attacking President Trump and Senator Paul when I come back because I'm even mad
[25:48.120 --> 25:49.920]  at them.
[25:49.920 --> 25:53.280]  I'm not attacking them because I want to say I'm holier than them and I'm smarter
[25:53.280 --> 25:55.640]  than them and I was right and I knew more than they did.
[25:55.640 --> 25:58.200]  It's not what this is about.
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.600]  This is about lighting a fire under their ash to get them to save themselves and save
[26:02.600 --> 26:07.440]  us in the process because they are leaders and I know they're both good men.
[26:07.440 --> 26:12.720]  Because if we want to sit here and be mad at Trump for authorizing the poison death
[26:12.720 --> 26:16.720]  shot and the horrible crime he's now a party to, if he doesn't soon say no to this and
[26:16.720 --> 26:20.600]  stand up, is Senator Paul.
[26:20.600 --> 26:22.080]  He's the one that advised Trump.
[26:22.080 --> 26:24.120]  Trump, trust him.
[26:24.120 --> 26:29.880]  And Paul blinded himself because he's a good doctor and just couldn't believe that actually
[26:29.880 --> 26:35.040]  roll out a poisonous injection and he knows that inoculation is a real technology and
[26:35.040 --> 26:38.160]  so he signed on to this.
[26:38.160 --> 26:40.840]  And now he's got to extricate himself out of that.
[26:40.840 --> 26:43.520]  So instead of talking about how bad Biden is and how he's coming out of the newborn
[26:43.520 --> 26:48.840]  babies starting January 1st, or how Germany's announced martial law and says forced inoculation
[26:48.840 --> 26:52.960]  with the military door-to-door is coming February 1st, or all the incredible videos
[26:52.960 --> 27:00.040]  of people in what are described as outdoor dog cages in Australia begging and being abused
[27:00.040 --> 27:03.800]  by the guards and the left sees the videos and says those aren't real even though they're
[27:03.800 --> 27:06.920]  confirmed to be real, we'll get to all that.
[27:06.920 --> 27:12.160]  We got Robert Barnes in the studio with big news.
[27:12.160 --> 27:16.000]  But if you don't understand why they're doing it and where it's coming from and the globalist
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.160]  mindset and how you don't get in their club unless you're ruthless and unless you'll have
[27:20.160 --> 27:23.720]  sex with children and that's just the beginning.
[27:23.720 --> 27:30.760]  If you won't kill children, you don't get in the higher echelons.
[27:30.760 --> 27:40.920]  And we could sit here and make this all about the bad guys.
[27:40.920 --> 27:44.520]  But why aren't we asking ourselves why aren't the good guys?
[27:44.520 --> 27:48.320]  Because there are good people in government and good people in corporations.
[27:48.320 --> 27:49.880]  Why aren't they speaking out?
[27:49.880 --> 27:51.400]  Why aren't they doing more?
[27:51.400 --> 27:54.480]  And the answer is they're trying to balance things and they're waiting for us.
[27:54.480 --> 27:57.680]  They're waiting for somebody else to be a leader so it's not as dangerous for them.
[27:57.680 --> 27:59.520]  And that's where I come in.
[27:59.520 --> 28:00.520]  And that's where you come in.
[28:00.520 --> 28:05.440]  Because yes, I will do whatever it takes to expose this no matter what happens to me personally
[28:05.440 --> 28:11.400]  because I realize we're going to lose everything in the end anyways if we don't.
[28:11.400 --> 28:15.200]  And so the only shot we've got is securing the future for our children and doing what
[28:15.200 --> 28:20.400]  other men of honor did in the past and that's where we are.
[28:20.400 --> 28:23.600]  And so you see Joe Rogan doing the right thing.
[28:23.600 --> 28:26.520]  You see Tucker Carlson doing the right thing.
[28:26.520 --> 28:30.080]  You see Paul starting to do the right thing and Trump edging towards it.
[28:30.080 --> 28:35.120]  Well, let's drag him into the light and let's make him do the right thing.
[28:35.120 --> 28:39.800]  Not by going to their houses and breaking their ribs or shooting them at baseball games
[28:39.800 --> 28:46.240]  but by doing what Stu Peters did where he confronted the White House Chief of Staff
[28:46.240 --> 28:50.520]  Meadows, former Chief of Staff, about what the hell's Trump doing with a shot.
[28:50.520 --> 28:51.520]  We've got that clip as well.
[28:51.520 --> 28:58.440]  When we come back, stay with us.
[28:58.440 --> 28:59.440]  Hey everybody.
[28:59.440 --> 29:00.440]  Confused?
[29:00.440 --> 29:05.160]  We have launched the most important sale of the year because now we've got a bunch
[29:05.160 --> 29:09.160]  of great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.

[29:16.320 --> 29:21.320]  the end of the month and that's now only six, seven days.
[29:21.320 --> 29:25.880]  Info War Store official Black Friday special has arrived.

[29:45.240 --> 29:47.240]  at infowarstore.com.
[29:47.240 --> 29:52.080]  It's only six, seven days left in the biggest sale of 2021.
[29:52.080 --> 29:55.240]  Bet on freedom, bet on Info Wars, bet on yourself and get great products.
[29:55.240 --> 29:59.560]  The only way you fail is not taking action at infowarstore.com.
[29:59.560 --> 30:04.000]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games.
[30:04.000 --> 30:05.360]  I like going to concerts.
[30:05.360 --> 30:06.720]  I like going to play golf.
[30:06.720 --> 30:08.120]  I like going out to dinner.
[30:08.120 --> 30:10.160]  I like the metropolitan life.
[30:10.160 --> 30:15.680]  I like everything that comes with this but see, I have the survival instinct that is
[30:15.680 --> 30:21.320]  to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas
[30:21.320 --> 30:24.560]  because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[30:24.560 --> 30:28.240]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in
[30:28.240 --> 30:31.680]  the woods and just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off
[30:31.680 --> 30:32.680]  the land?
[30:32.680 --> 30:36.440]  That's the survival instinct but see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority
[30:36.440 --> 30:39.520]  part of me says no, no, no, no, no, stay in the city.
[30:39.520 --> 30:43.680]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere that you need to get a vaccine
[30:43.680 --> 30:44.680]  or a mask.
[30:44.680 --> 30:50.200]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you and the audience are facing
[30:50.200 --> 30:55.760]  as well but you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and
[30:55.760 --> 30:59.640]  so we have the best ones at infowarstore.com.
[30:59.640 --> 31:06.400]  In late August, Info Wars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[31:06.400 --> 31:11.920]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause
[31:11.920 --> 31:15.920]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[31:15.920 --> 31:19.120]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always been something that's important to
[31:19.120 --> 31:20.120]  have.
[31:20.120 --> 31:22.960]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water
[31:22.960 --> 31:26.840]  filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[31:26.840 --> 31:30.320]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in.
[31:30.320 --> 31:33.640]  Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[31:33.640 --> 31:39.080]  It's high quality, it's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future you're
[31:39.080 --> 31:43.520]  going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases
[31:43.520 --> 31:45.040]  that are already taking place.
[31:45.040 --> 31:51.320]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the Info War at infowarstore.com.
[31:51.320 --> 31:55.200]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[31:55.200 --> 31:56.200]  control.
[31:56.200 --> 31:59.400]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[31:59.400 --> 32:04.880]  New and run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here all over the world from Australia
[32:04.880 --> 32:07.400]  to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[32:07.400 --> 32:11.320]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, then coming to your house
[32:11.320 --> 32:17.800]  and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[32:17.800 --> 32:22.360]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take
[32:22.360 --> 32:26.360]  quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[32:26.360 --> 32:28.160]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[32:28.160 --> 32:32.400]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many
[32:32.400 --> 32:36.680]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[32:36.680 --> 32:39.320]  grade at infowarstore.com.

[33:27.120 --> 33:34.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from the infowarstore.com
[33:34.800 --> 33:39.200]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:39.200 --> 33:45.160]  While we speak, hundreds of thousands of children, soon it will be millions across the western
[33:45.160 --> 33:53.120]  world, not just in America, are being injected with the poisonous GMO bio weapon.
[33:53.120 --> 33:58.880]  Please put on screen today's live show headline, please, and I'm going to lay out how we stop
[33:58.880 --> 34:02.400]  it right now together.
[34:02.400 --> 34:08.640]  Friday emergency broadcast, Biden pledges to forcibly inject all babies at birth with
[34:08.640 --> 34:11.760]  Pfizer's bio weapon.
[34:11.760 --> 34:19.680]  Meanwhile, the global controlled CIA has been caught protecting massive pedophile ranks
[34:19.680 --> 34:22.040]  in the CIA.
[34:22.040 --> 34:24.440]  The great reset is here.
[34:24.440 --> 34:32.880]  Its goals populate the earth, tune in now and learn how we can fight back and win.
[34:32.880 --> 34:37.040]  So there are a lot of chinks in the New World Order armor, and I try to attack every one
[34:37.040 --> 34:38.040]  of them.
[34:38.040 --> 34:41.680]  Obviously, you being awake, you praying to God, you taking action, that's the number
[34:41.680 --> 34:46.320]  one thing, that's the ocean in which we swim.
[34:46.320 --> 34:52.560]  Being an example to others of telling the truth and being persecuted to inspire others
[34:52.560 --> 34:57.200]  doesn't intimidate real men, is also another thing you can do, and I've done that thanks
[34:57.200 --> 35:00.440]  to you keeping me in the arena, you've done that.
[35:00.440 --> 35:06.280]  Your gravity, your support has held us there, your gravitas, your will, thank you for joining
[35:06.280 --> 35:08.600]  wills with me.
[35:08.600 --> 35:18.280]  And there are so many ways to fight the tyrants, you're not going to change the hearts of Fauci
[35:18.280 --> 35:22.640]  and Biden and their controllers, they love the fact that you know they're murderers,
[35:22.640 --> 35:28.360]  they love the fact that you know they're pedophiles, it's funny to them.
[35:28.360 --> 35:32.880]  Joe Biden loves the fact that he's always passed his wife around at sex orgies, that's
[35:32.880 --> 35:38.560]  why I bragged about it yesterday with Fauci, it's well known.
[35:38.560 --> 35:43.400]  That's just the tip of the iceberg, they have sex with their children for God's sakes, that's
[35:43.400 --> 35:48.320]  just the open door to this, devilry.
[35:48.320 --> 35:55.440]  So when you look at all that, you can demonize them all day long and they deserve it and
[35:55.440 --> 36:02.320]  it's important to do, but more important is understanding why Donald Trump went along
[36:02.320 --> 36:09.600]  with warp speed and if you understand that, you understand how to get Trump to wake up
[36:09.600 --> 36:16.840]  and go against the globalist and we have to get him on record, we have to get him noticed,
[36:16.840 --> 36:24.840]  we have to let him know and then if Trump by a deadline does not come out and start
[36:24.840 --> 36:30.240]  telling the truth, we have to then have a large convention through our shows and our
[36:30.240 --> 36:35.440]  broadcast and a consensus needs to be developed on something that's important with not just
[36:35.440 --> 36:40.120]  this broadcast but other shows and listeners and have a large sounding board committee
[36:40.120 --> 36:47.480]  discussion and then we have to decide what we're going to do about Trump because I gave
[36:47.480 --> 36:54.560]  him the benefit of the doubt and knew the globalist hated him so much and wasn't sure
[36:54.560 --> 36:59.720]  exactly which avenue they were going down a year and a half ago, but now it's extremely
[36:59.720 --> 37:03.040]  clear what's happening and people say, well, he's out of office now, why don't we just
[37:03.040 --> 37:04.040]  move on from Trump?
[37:04.040 --> 37:08.000]  No, Trump gets basically everybody he supports elected.
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.520]  He is a big drive in the Republican Party, a big fundraiser and he's getting a lot of
[37:13.520 --> 37:14.720]  good people elected.
[37:14.720 --> 37:18.040]  Some aren't perfect but they're a lot better than Democrats and so they want to destroy
[37:18.040 --> 37:22.840]  Trump because he's an asset for America and if we could really get him to wake up, he'd
[37:22.840 --> 37:24.400]  be a total asset.
[37:24.400 --> 37:32.800]  Now, that's my thoughts on that but it's important to understand how Trump got sucked
[37:32.800 --> 37:35.920]  in to Operation Warp Speed.
[37:35.920 --> 37:39.040]  They came to him and said, hey, we need right to try law.
[37:39.040 --> 37:41.800]  They won't let people have drugs that have been out for decades that will probably save
[37:41.800 --> 37:45.240]  them even though they're terminal and Trump said, yeah, let's pass a law that people that
[37:45.240 --> 37:48.040]  are adults are allowed to do whatever experimental therapy they want.
[37:48.040 --> 37:49.040]  I'm all for that.
[37:49.040 --> 37:50.040]  I'm like, yes, innovation.
[37:50.040 --> 37:54.760]  Then they come to him and say, sir, MRNA, it'll totally save people, it'll keep the economy
[37:54.760 --> 37:55.760]  open.
[37:55.760 --> 37:58.960]  If we don't keep the economy open, it'll cause a chain reaction and starve tens of millions
[37:58.960 --> 38:02.600]  of death worldwide and Trump talked to Senator Paul and Senator Paul's like, I've looked
[38:02.600 --> 38:06.120]  at the MRNA technology, it looks like it's going to work, sir, I guess we need to go
[38:06.120 --> 38:09.000]  ahead with it.
[38:09.000 --> 38:15.480]  They didn't see the fine print, they didn't know and it got rammed through.
[38:15.480 --> 38:20.440]  Well now everybody knows it massive increases in the statistics of you dying and we've had
[38:20.440 --> 38:24.800]  these shots and doesn't protect you and increases your chances of getting COVID and being seriously
[38:24.800 --> 38:25.800]  ill or dying.
[38:25.800 --> 38:28.720]  So we know that's all a fraud.
[38:28.720 --> 38:37.800]  And so now is the time to aggressively get in the face of the Republican Party.
[38:37.800 --> 38:43.920]  And I mean, if people got to go do peaceful sit-ins at their offices or whatever, then
[38:43.920 --> 38:45.240]  that needs to happen.
[38:45.240 --> 38:48.320]  We don't want to see any January 6th up at the left of sit-ins all the time and the media
[38:48.320 --> 38:49.320]  says they're great.
[38:49.320 --> 38:53.520]  Well, we need to do sit-ins, especially in their home offices, you know, over this until
[38:53.520 --> 38:55.440]  they do something about the poison shot.
[38:55.440 --> 39:00.720]  And we're this close to flipping the Republicans fully against the globalist and they all know
[39:00.720 --> 39:01.720]  what's going on now.
[39:01.720 --> 39:06.760]  If they'll just have the courage, we can put Fauci in prison, stop the whole thing, reverse
[39:06.760 --> 39:12.760]  this deal right now and really defeat the globalist on a mass scale.
[39:12.760 --> 39:16.400]  People still be problems, they're still dug in, the system's still corrupt, but they won't
[39:16.400 --> 39:20.400]  be on this giant offense against humanity.
[39:20.400 --> 39:24.440]  So if we can get governors and legislatures and grand juries to move against the new world
[39:24.440 --> 39:26.800]  order, that'll be good as well.
[39:26.800 --> 39:31.680]  And again, they will try to punish and target and harass whoever does the right thing.
[39:31.680 --> 39:37.720]  But that's okay because more people will then stand up because courage is contagious and
[39:37.720 --> 39:40.680]  then they won't be able to stop us all.
[39:40.680 --> 39:45.320]  Just like when they draw the line in the sand and whoever is going to stay, step across
[39:45.320 --> 39:48.880]  whoever's going to go, don't step across.
[39:48.880 --> 39:51.400]  And when you realize you have nothing else to lose and the globalists are going to get
[39:51.400 --> 39:57.160]  worse and worse and take more and more freedoms, do more and more horrible things, and that
[39:57.160 --> 40:02.760]  submission is death, then you're not going to go along with it.
[40:02.760 --> 40:09.880]  I mean, things are only going to get worse when we submit to this.
[40:09.880 --> 40:13.400]  And if you want to know where we're going next segment, I will play a lot of these clips
[40:13.400 --> 40:14.400]  for you.
[40:14.400 --> 40:18.320]  But speaking of clips, let's go to Biden, remember when he says he wants to make it
[40:18.320 --> 40:21.120]  available to newborns, that means mandatory.
[40:21.120 --> 40:25.360]  Just like right after they said, oh, available to 12 and up mandatory, available, five and
[40:25.360 --> 40:26.360]  up mandatory.
[40:26.360 --> 40:29.920]  So what he's saying is, we're coming with mandatory injections and whenever you see
[40:29.920 --> 40:32.960]  in Germany or Australia is coming here, here he is.
[40:32.960 --> 40:38.120]  I have a three year old that's going to be a time that that can am I going to be okay?
[40:38.120 --> 40:40.800]  He going to be okay or he going to be okay?
[40:40.800 --> 40:41.800]  And let me say this.
[40:41.800 --> 40:47.080]  I strongly support the independent scientific view of vaccine uses for children under five.
[40:47.080 --> 40:53.040]  We can't take shortcuts with that scientific work, but I'll do everything on my power to
[40:53.040 --> 40:58.240]  support the FDA to do this safely and quickly as possible when we get to around that point.
[40:58.240 --> 41:02.840]  Oh, we got to do this safely and good and not rush it.
[41:02.840 --> 41:05.000]  When it's all secret, it's all rushed.
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.920]  They try to suppress the FDA documents of in just the first few weeks of the injections,
[41:09.920 --> 41:10.920]  mass death.
[41:10.920 --> 41:11.920]  We covered that yesterday.
[41:11.920 --> 41:14.960]  More is breaking on that as we speak.
[41:14.960 --> 41:19.800]  Now here's Senator Paul getting it right, going in the right direction.
[41:19.800 --> 41:23.040]  But he used to come out and say we were misled about these shots.
[41:23.040 --> 41:24.680]  They are causing major health problems.
[41:24.680 --> 41:26.360]  They're erasing immune systems.
[41:26.360 --> 41:27.440]  I was wrong.
[41:27.440 --> 41:33.360]  I was conned into operation warp speed and Trump would follow suit immediately because
[41:33.360 --> 41:34.840]  he really respects Dr. Paul.
[41:34.840 --> 41:36.360]  They're friends now.
[41:36.360 --> 41:39.800]  So Rand Paul's the person to lobby and to target.
[41:39.800 --> 41:43.600]  I'm not saying we go to sit-ins next week.
[41:43.600 --> 41:51.080]  I'm simply saying we need to put him on notice that we see him as a real leader, the children
[41:51.080 --> 41:52.800]  demand protection.
[41:52.800 --> 41:55.920]  They're trying to make all this forced right now.
[41:55.920 --> 41:57.840]  The parents are being manipulated into doing it.
[41:57.840 --> 42:01.200]  We need to stand for the children.
[42:01.200 --> 42:05.320]  And he needs to admit he was wrong because he's one of the main people that got Trump
[42:05.320 --> 42:06.480]  to go along with this.
[42:06.480 --> 42:07.800]  Here's Senator Paul.
[42:07.800 --> 42:13.600]  They're new $5 trillion reconciliation plan and there's no accountability for Fauci.
[42:13.600 --> 42:15.840]  Look, we know that he lied under oath.
[42:15.840 --> 42:20.480]  Will there be any accountability for lying to your face?
[42:20.480 --> 42:24.040]  We've referred him to the Department of Justice, but then again, Merrick Gardland is the one
[42:24.040 --> 42:27.600]  now going after parents that go to school board meetings, so I don't have a lot of hope
[42:27.600 --> 42:32.080]  that he is actually going to be objectively looking at Fauci's lying.
[42:32.080 --> 42:35.680]  But Fauci should go to prison for five years for lying to Congress.
[42:35.680 --> 42:42.000]  They've prosecuted other people, they've selectively gone after Republicans, but in no way do anything
[42:42.000 --> 42:43.000]  about him lying.
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.040]  But he should be prosecuted for lying, but at the very least, he should be taken out
[42:46.040 --> 42:50.280]  of his position because I think he costs people lives through misinformation.
[42:50.280 --> 42:52.360]  Every time he tells people.
[42:52.360 --> 42:55.800]  And it's Fauci that created the virus and Fauci that ran the vaccine program with Bill
[42:55.800 --> 42:56.800]  Gates.
[42:56.800 --> 42:59.520]  And you need to say, oh, he lied to us for a moment.
[42:59.520 --> 43:00.880]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[43:00.880 --> 43:02.760]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[43:02.760 --> 43:03.760]  Welcome.
[43:03.760 --> 43:04.760]  Hello, Alex.
[43:04.760 --> 43:05.760]  Yes, Malcolm.
[43:05.760 --> 43:08.760]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get online.
[43:08.760 --> 43:13.800]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMail
[43:13.800 --> 43:16.520]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[43:16.520 --> 43:17.520]  Mix those two together.
[43:17.520 --> 43:19.200]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[43:19.200 --> 43:21.080]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[43:21.080 --> 43:26.000]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.600]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[43:31.600 --> 43:32.600]  that just aren't as strong.
[43:32.600 --> 43:34.680]  This is like a very fine wine.
[43:34.680 --> 43:37.000]  In fact, each batch is different.
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[43:38.000 --> 43:39.000]  Sometimes it's just OK.
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.480]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[43:42.480 --> 43:43.480]  That's just how it is.
[43:43.480 --> 43:45.040]  It's how it works.
[43:45.040 --> 43:46.640]  So it's always good.
[43:46.640 --> 43:48.800]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[43:48.800 --> 43:59.520]  Yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[43:59.520 --> 44:04.800]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[44:04.800 --> 44:11.120]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels, most men know that testosterone
[44:11.120 --> 44:17.520]  levels begin to decline, starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year.
[44:17.520 --> 44:24.720]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[44:24.720 --> 44:29.240]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on
[44:29.240 --> 44:30.240]  the market.
[44:30.240 --> 44:36.720]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[44:36.720 --> 44:43.680]  into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo
[44:43.680 --> 44:49.720]  from Peru, horny goatweed from China, and tribulus from India.

[44:59.240 --> 45:02.600]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[45:02.600 --> 45:06.920]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[45:06.920 --> 45:11.640]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[45:11.640 --> 45:16.120]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com.
[45:16.120 --> 45:20.920]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[45:20.920 --> 45:26.680]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[45:26.680 --> 45:32.680]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[45:32.680 --> 45:39.320]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.920]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[45:43.920 --> 45:49.680]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[45:49.680 --> 45:52.520]  facts that pertain to reality.
[45:52.520 --> 45:58.840]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[45:58.840 --> 46:04.320]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[46:04.320 --> 46:10.040]  Both the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection
[46:10.040 --> 46:14.240]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[46:14.240 --> 46:19.360]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[46:19.360 --> 46:24.240]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[46:24.240 --> 46:28.520]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening, and
[46:28.520 --> 46:33.560]  it's unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[46:33.560 --> 46:36.680]  To continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[46:36.680 --> 46:40.040]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[46:40.040 --> 46:44.680]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[46:44.680 --> 46:45.680]  an end.
[46:45.680 --> 46:51.480]  And so we must prepare, get up to a years worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival
[46:51.480 --> 47:01.120]  gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge at infowarsstore.com.
[47:01.120 --> 47:07.120]  Beginning of frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:31.120 --> 47:36.720]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show as we broadcast worldwide in defiance of tyranny
[47:36.720 --> 47:41.880]  and their censorship thanks to you, the listeners and viewers, affiliates, and great crew.
[47:41.880 --> 47:47.720]  You're one happy family in this joyous fight against tyranny.
[47:47.720 --> 47:49.400]  The joy of battle.
[47:49.400 --> 47:51.840]  Alright, listen, here's the deal.
[47:51.840 --> 47:55.360]  Robert Barnes has been filing suits with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the country.
[47:55.360 --> 48:00.040]  He's here filing another suit on Friday in Waco with the big whistleblower.
[48:00.040 --> 48:03.280]  He first broke that here a few months ago before it ever broke a month before anybody
[48:03.280 --> 48:04.280]  else.
[48:04.280 --> 48:06.720]  He's the lawyer behind it.
[48:06.720 --> 48:11.440]  This dovetails in with the new FDA and CDC documents that came out where they knew it
[48:11.440 --> 48:14.960]  killed thousands in just the first few weeks of the injections.
[48:14.960 --> 48:17.760]  That's all next hour and so much more.
[48:17.760 --> 48:21.280]  And also the attacks on the Seventh Amendment and the attacks on the Fifth Amendment that
[48:21.280 --> 48:22.280]  are going on.
[48:22.280 --> 48:28.760]  The committee chairman of the January 6th committee, the witch hunt, has said that I, Roger Stone,
[48:28.760 --> 48:32.680]  like anybody else, I got the clip next hour, that takes the Fifth means we're guilty and
[48:32.680 --> 48:36.600]  that we're criminals and that we should go to jail.
[48:36.600 --> 48:42.080]  That is, again, just complete monstrosity, a 180 from what our country is, but look at
[48:42.080 --> 48:43.080]  my civil trials.
[48:43.080 --> 48:44.520]  Oh, you don't get a jury trial.
[48:44.520 --> 48:50.920]  And Yahoo News is like, oh, he wants a jury, oh, you don't get that.
[48:50.920 --> 48:51.920]  It's power grab, folks.
[48:51.920 --> 48:55.800]  These people are bullies and they're too stupid to realize they're destroying their own future
[48:55.800 --> 48:56.800]  along with ours.
[48:56.800 --> 49:04.040]  So you're living in the midst of a globalist elite revolution by the moneyed powers and
[49:04.040 --> 49:08.760]  the moneyed class through their minions against the general public.
[49:08.760 --> 49:10.160]  Why would they want to destroy a middle class?
[49:10.160 --> 49:15.360]  Henry Ford had problems, but he knew I want to pay my employees enough to buy my car.
[49:15.360 --> 49:19.480]  Why should he just sell 100 to 100 rich people when he could sell a million to the new middle
[49:19.480 --> 49:20.480]  class?
[49:20.480 --> 49:24.800]  They don't want a middle class, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:24.800 --> 49:27.160]  They don't want that, you understand?
[49:27.160 --> 49:33.520]  So, getting back to Senator Paul, I really want the listeners to have this sink in, because
[49:33.520 --> 49:39.080]  I know you're smart, that instead of pressuring Democrats to stop raping us and enslaving
[49:39.080 --> 49:44.440]  us, we need to pressure Republicans legally and lawfully, because they always say we're
[49:44.440 --> 49:46.760]  calling for violence when we're calling the opposite.
[49:46.760 --> 49:49.240]  If violence worked, they've already attacked us a lot.
[49:49.240 --> 49:50.240]  I'd be calling for it.
[49:50.240 --> 49:51.240]  They've got it all set up.
[49:51.240 --> 49:52.240]  We'll backfire on us.
[49:52.240 --> 49:53.240]  So I don't just add a proviso.
[49:53.240 --> 49:54.240]  Let's not be violent.
[49:54.240 --> 49:55.240]  Let's not be quaint.
[49:55.240 --> 49:57.400]  No, do not, do not throw the first punch.
[49:57.400 --> 49:58.840]  Do not shoot first.
[49:58.840 --> 50:03.280]  Go back to Lessington and Concord at Bunker Hill.
[50:03.280 --> 50:04.400]  What did the captain of the militia say?
[50:04.400 --> 50:05.800]  He said, we don't want a war to start today.
[50:05.800 --> 50:08.760]  We're not going to shoot first, but if they shoot first, it's a war they want.
[50:08.760 --> 50:10.680]  It's a war they'll get.
[50:10.680 --> 50:12.160]  So we're here.
[50:12.160 --> 50:13.840]  We've been warning the people.
[50:13.840 --> 50:20.080]  We've been preparing our forces to peacefully beat this, but they're coming for the children.
[50:20.080 --> 50:23.240]  They're actually attacking the children now, so we have a responsibility.
[50:23.240 --> 50:25.400]  So I'm not going to spend my time on Fauci.
[50:25.400 --> 50:29.880]  I'm going to spend my time on the people that can stop this.
[50:29.880 --> 50:36.600]  And there's nothing wrong when you're admitted to be wrong and when you're a good person
[50:36.600 --> 50:39.120]  and you tell people you were wrong.
[50:39.120 --> 50:42.120]  And Rand Paul needs to say, listen, I believe in vaccines that are real technology.
[50:42.120 --> 50:43.120]  They can have problems.
[50:43.120 --> 50:45.120]  This isn't a vaccine.
[50:45.120 --> 50:46.520]  Now they're trying to force on everybody.
[50:46.520 --> 50:48.320]  It's making everybody really, really sick.
[50:48.320 --> 50:49.320]  Here's the statistics.
[50:49.320 --> 50:50.320]  Here's the numbers.
[50:50.320 --> 50:51.320]  He's really smart.
[50:51.320 --> 50:54.480]  Before he would have his medical degree.
[50:54.480 --> 51:03.440]  And I was interviewing Rand Paul in 1996 for his daddy to get him re-elected to the House
[51:03.440 --> 51:07.840]  of Representatives because he'd been in the 80s for only one term.
[51:07.840 --> 51:14.120]  And again, I used to call up Rand Paul and hear his kids crying in the background.
[51:14.120 --> 51:16.800]  That's how long I've known him, longer than that hell.
[51:16.800 --> 51:18.840]  And so he's a good guy.
[51:18.840 --> 51:24.640]  But just because we're faced with horrible, evil circumstances.
[51:24.640 --> 51:27.720]  Just because the globalists are assaulting everybody.
[51:27.720 --> 51:37.760]  Just because it sounds crazy to talk about all this, we've got to be like Tucker Carlson.
[51:37.760 --> 51:41.480]  And say, okay, Alex Jones was right.
[51:41.480 --> 51:42.480]  We're really in deep trouble.
[51:42.480 --> 51:43.480]  This is real fascism.
[51:43.480 --> 51:44.880]  This is a real war.
[51:44.880 --> 51:47.800]  They're really killing us.
[51:47.800 --> 51:49.840]  The only way to beat it is you're in a fight.
[51:49.840 --> 51:54.280]  I mean, if your house is on fire, you go, well, let's use not admit it's on fire.
[51:54.280 --> 51:58.280]  I'm just going to claim that it's missing a few shingles.
[51:58.280 --> 52:01.360]  Your house is going to burn down.
[52:01.360 --> 52:05.200]  But if you admit the house is on fire, there's still time to put it out, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:05.200 --> 52:06.800]  But we got to admit how much trouble we're in.
[52:06.800 --> 52:10.840]  So yeah, coming out and saying arrest Fauci takes a lot of courage.
[52:10.840 --> 52:12.440]  He's done that.
[52:12.440 --> 52:15.600]  Coming out and saying you shouldn't forcefully inoculate people and people who have natural
[52:15.600 --> 52:18.320]  communities way, way better, so why are you trying to make them take a shot?
[52:18.320 --> 52:19.400]  Yeah, that's logic.
[52:19.400 --> 52:20.400]  That's common sense.
[52:20.400 --> 52:25.360]  But the rest of the way, Senator, where they admit in all these studies I've got here,
[52:25.360 --> 52:33.840]  mainline studies, that it erases your immune system to take these injections and that it's
[52:33.840 --> 52:38.040]  not a vaccine and that it's causing heart attacks and blood plots and that your own
[52:38.040 --> 52:41.280]  speeches on the Senate floor about it have been censored.
[52:41.280 --> 52:42.600]  That's not just wrong.
[52:42.600 --> 52:43.600]  It's dangerous.
[52:43.600 --> 52:45.640]  And it's not just dangerous.
[52:45.640 --> 52:47.920]  It's clear and present tyranny.
[52:47.920 --> 52:49.800]  That's not just a clear and present danger.
[52:49.800 --> 52:58.800]  It's a clear and present hammer hitting us in the damn head.
[52:58.800 --> 53:04.160]  So we're already going out to protest Bato tomorrow.
[53:04.160 --> 53:07.160]  We're already going to go out and protest at some of the vaccine injection centers where
[53:07.160 --> 53:09.040]  they're shooting the kids up.
[53:09.040 --> 53:10.280]  I'm doing what I said I'll do.
[53:10.280 --> 53:12.080]  I need you to do similar things.
[53:12.080 --> 53:14.040]  We need folks to go to Murlonggo and protest.
[53:14.040 --> 53:18.120]  We need Trump supporters to go there and protest Trump and get him to come out against Fauci
[53:18.120 --> 53:20.120]  and this damn shot to say he was misled.
[53:20.120 --> 53:23.720]  But I'm not holding my breath.
[53:23.720 --> 53:25.240]  We get Rand Paul to do it.
[53:25.240 --> 53:26.240]  Trump will follow.
[53:26.240 --> 53:27.240]  Okay?
[53:27.240 --> 53:32.840]  He's the type of guy that puts total faith in doctors and total faith in the military.
[53:32.840 --> 53:36.160]  Some doctors are great and some military great and some suck.
[53:36.160 --> 53:37.160]  But it doesn't matter.
[53:37.160 --> 53:38.760]  We get Rand Paul.
[53:38.760 --> 53:40.240]  He's the real point.
[53:40.240 --> 53:43.960]  The whole house of cards comes down and we're this close and we've already are getting Ted
[53:43.960 --> 53:46.960]  Cruz and we're already getting Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley.
[53:46.960 --> 53:52.920]  We are driving them into political combat with the globalists as they're supposed to
[53:52.920 --> 54:00.040]  do as American senators standing up for this country against the crazy multinational corporations
[54:00.040 --> 54:02.760]  that think they're going to get away with all this because they can sit back and watch
[54:02.760 --> 54:06.480]  us destroy each other from afar.
[54:06.480 --> 54:14.640]  And that's another huge part of the solutions here is we need to let the New World Order
[54:14.640 --> 54:26.040]  and the Hungarian Queen of England and all the rest of them know that we know who they
[54:26.040 --> 54:30.360]  are and we know what you've done running your evil mouths about how you want to kill us
[54:30.360 --> 54:33.280]  with a virus, Prince Philip and Prince Charles.
[54:33.280 --> 54:36.520]  And you are the bad guys just like Fauci and just like Gates.
[54:36.520 --> 54:42.720]  We need to move on up from Fauci and Gates to Prince Charles and to Klaus Schwab.
[54:42.720 --> 54:43.720]  That's the top tier.
[54:43.720 --> 54:47.680]  Those are the guys at the top and there's other ones in the shadows.
[54:47.680 --> 54:48.680]  They're all related.
[54:48.680 --> 54:50.240]  It's one damn group.
[54:50.240 --> 54:52.440]  You want to talk about some inbred white people, folks.
[54:52.440 --> 54:53.440]  This is them.
[54:53.440 --> 54:56.400]  And the Rothschilds 200 years ago bred into them.
[54:56.400 --> 55:01.600]  Well, 250 it started, but the Rothschilds bred into these people 250 years ago and they're
[55:01.600 --> 55:05.280]  basically Saxe-Coburg Gothen now.
[55:05.280 --> 55:13.360]  So you can sit there and look at the size of the enemy and all the stuff they're up
[55:13.360 --> 55:15.080]  to and think, well, we just can't beat them.
[55:15.080 --> 55:16.680]  They're going to kill you anyways.
[55:16.680 --> 55:19.320]  All you can do is fight now.
[55:19.320 --> 55:22.000]  And if you identify them and you expose them, they will go down.
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.160]  They will be destroyed by their own operation, but we don't have time to play games.
[55:26.160 --> 55:34.960]  Now here's to Peter's getting Mark Meadows on to Peter's frequent guest host and confronting
[55:34.960 --> 55:38.120]  him about Trump and saying, we need you to do something about this.
[55:38.120 --> 55:41.480]  Because you know, Mark Meadows is hearing from his constituents that Trump is destroying
[55:41.480 --> 55:45.040]  himself and helping kill a bunch of people being part of this.
[55:45.040 --> 55:46.540]  Here it is.
[55:46.540 --> 55:51.400]  Does the president know that the shots that they're calling vaccines that he's pushing
[55:51.400 --> 55:54.720]  on the entire populace are killing all kinds of people?
[55:54.720 --> 55:59.760]  You know, I don't know that he knows any of that as it relates to the vaccines, too.
[55:59.760 --> 56:00.760]  I can tell you that.
[56:00.760 --> 56:03.680]  If I give you the information, would you bring it to him?
[56:03.680 --> 56:05.160]  Because they're pushing this on our kids.
[56:05.160 --> 56:07.400]  Yeah, you should have sent it to us.
[56:07.400 --> 56:11.360]  Obviously, I forwarded other information to him, but if you send it to me, I'll be glad
[56:11.360 --> 56:14.360]  to make sure it gets in his hands.
[56:14.360 --> 56:16.480]  So we need to see a lot more of that.
[56:16.480 --> 56:18.760]  Bravo, Steve Peters, Red Voice Media.
[56:18.760 --> 56:20.960]  All right.

[57:22.120 --> 57:26.480]  to get some of this in because of the supply chain breaking down, infowarstore.com, super

[57:54.720 --> 57:58.640]  great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.

[58:05.740 --> 58:10.640]  the end of the month, and that's now only six, seven days.

[58:39.880 --> 58:41.520]  of 2021.
[58:41.520 --> 58:44.840]  Bet on freedom, bet on info wars, bet on yourself, and get great products.
[58:44.840 --> 59:10.840]  That's the only way you fail is not taking action at infowarstore.com.
[59:10.840 --> 59:35.800]  That's the only way you fail is not taking action at infowarstore.com.
[59:35.800 --> 59:53.160]  That's the only way you fail is not taking action at infowarstore.com.
[59:53.160 --> 1:00:03.960]  That's the only way you fail is not taking action at infowarstore.com.
[1:00:03.960 --> 1:00:33.320]  It was decided by the WHO in early 2021 to use the Greek alphabet as a means of naming
[1:00:33.320 --> 1:00:35.320]  the greek alphabet.
[1:00:35.320 --> 1:00:57.240]  That is the only way you fail is not taking action at infowarstore.com.
[1:00:57.240 --> 1:01:01.000]  over their own health protocols in October of 2020.
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:04.800]  But either way, they skipped two letters
[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:08.360]  of the Greek alphabet, new and g.
[1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:10.140]  The reason seems likely.
[1:01:10.140 --> 1:01:13.680]  They skipped new because saying the new variant
[1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:17.240]  sounds exactly like saying the new variant.
[1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:20.200]  And the g variant sounds as if we are naming it
[1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:24.080]  after gijinping, which would be fitting,
[1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:28.160]  but the WHO obviously isn't going to do that.
[1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:32.920]  So it ended up as Omicron, which is also interesting.
[1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:35.620]  Omicron is symbolized by the I.
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:40.920]  Anagrams of Omicron are moronic,
[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:42.080]  which you would have to be
[1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:44.960]  if you were still going along with any of this.
[1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:46.760]  And Oncomir.
[1:01:46.760 --> 1:01:50.260]  Oncomirs are small, endogenous RNAs
[1:01:50.260 --> 1:01:54.240]  that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally.
[1:01:54.240 --> 1:01:56.840]  They are part of the body's natural reaction
[1:01:56.840 --> 1:01:59.120]  to splicing and gene editing
[1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:01.680]  and are specifically associated with cancer.
[1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:08.200]  In 1963, the Italian film Omicron was released
[1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:10.840]  about an alien taking over a person's body
[1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:14.200]  to recon the planet for a future invasion
[1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:18.480]  produced by Lux Films, which translates to Lucifer,
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:20.560]  the lightbearer.
[1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:24.440]  In 2013, the film The Visitor from Planet Omicron
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:27.400]  was released about a corrupt government
[1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:30.660]  that sends an alien to Earth to deliver a virus.
[1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:33.880]  If you add the word Delta,
[1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:36.800]  as in the other big media hyped variant,
[1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:39.760]  then you have the anagram media control.
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:43.520]  This all reminds me of reverse speech,
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:47.040]  such as the famous Obama slogan, yes we can.
[1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:52.040]  Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can.
[1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:58.760]  That when played in reverse, sounds like thank you Satan.
[1:02:58.760 --> 1:03:03.760]  Thank you Satan, thank you Satan, thank you Satan.
[1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:08.760]  And when you play Omicron backwards,
[1:03:08.760 --> 1:03:11.160]  you get what some people are claiming sounds like,
[1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:12.440]  lock him up.
[1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:17.400]  Omicron, narchima, narchima.
[1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:20.240]  As if referring to their psychopathic patsy,
[1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:21.680]  Anthony Fauci.
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:23.320]  Weird coincidence?
[1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:25.040]  Are we living in the matrix?
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:28.320]  Or is it simply Psyop voodoo trickery?
[1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:32.200]  Whatever it is, there is no escape from any of this madness
[1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:34.640]  until enough people wake up and say no.
[1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:38.680]  For infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:43.680]  This report has been censored and taken off the web,
[1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:58.920]  but it's available at Greg Rees' site on Band-Aub video.
[1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:03.000]  I'd like to call the order of this secret conclave
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  of America's media empires.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:09.720]  to put Americans back where they belong
[1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:11.640]  and dark rooms glued to their televisions
[1:04:11.640 --> 1:04:13.560]  too terrified to skip the commercials.
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:14.400]  Well, I think...
[1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:17.440]  NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:19.840]  I think we should go with a good old-fashioned
[1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:20.680]  public health care.
[1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:22.240]  Yeah.
[1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:24.120]  A new disease, no one's immune.
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:25.440]  It's like the summer of the shark,
[1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:27.520]  except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:29.480]  And instead of summer, it's all the time.
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:30.840]  That is so...
[1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:32.880]  Now I hate to be the guy who derails
[1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:34.160]  what everybody else loves.
[1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:35.800]  He loves being that guy.
[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:38.480]  But, Janice, we do have standards.
[1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:40.440]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:43.600]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus
[1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:44.880]  into the general public.
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:47.360]  We do have something we've been holding on to,
[1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:48.680]  but it hasn't been tested.
[1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:50.040]  Get over here, NBC.
[1:04:50.040 --> 1:04:54.040]  Oh, well, we certainly believe in testing,
[1:04:54.040 --> 1:04:54.880]  but I...
[1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:57.640]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[1:04:57.640 --> 1:04:58.600]  Wow.
[1:04:58.600 --> 1:04:59.440]  Wow.
[1:04:59.440 --> 1:05:00.520]  Now, 2021...
[1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:02.640]  I have a question to ask you.
[1:05:02.640 --> 1:05:06.680]  Why would you spend your money this Christmas season
[1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:09.880]  to buy gifts for friends and family and loved ones
[1:05:09.880 --> 1:05:13.280]  with the establishment, with the big corporations
[1:05:13.280 --> 1:05:17.680]  that are dedicated to waging war on all of our freedoms
[1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:21.360]  and suppressing us and forcing medical tyranny on us?
[1:05:21.360 --> 1:05:23.360]  I've never backed down to tyranny.
[1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:25.840]  We've had incredible successes fighting them.
[1:05:25.840 --> 1:05:27.200]  Thanks for your support.
[1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:30.000]  But now, as 2021 comes to a close,
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:33.800]  I want to encourage you now more than ever
[1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:35.800]  to support the truth.
[1:05:35.800 --> 1:05:39.280]  And you do that at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:39.280 --> 1:05:42.800]  Storewide free shipping, double-patriot points running right now,
[1:05:42.800 --> 1:05:44.920]  huge deals of bottom-memeral fusion,
[1:05:44.920 --> 1:05:48.280]  DNA Force Plus, and lung cleanse, and turbo force.
[1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:51.000]  And these are really amazing, high-quality products
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:52.800]  that also fund the Info War.
[1:05:52.800 --> 1:06:00.600]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[1:06:00.600 --> 1:06:14.800]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[1:06:14.800 --> 1:06:16.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:22.800]  All right. Robert Barnes is in studio.
[1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:25.800]  He came to Texas to file the suit
[1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:27.800]  that he first broke here on air months ago
[1:06:27.800 --> 1:06:29.800]  before it would even hit the news
[1:06:29.800 --> 1:06:31.800]  with a major FDA whistleblower
[1:06:31.800 --> 1:06:34.800]  that has also been interviewed by the British Medical Journal
[1:06:34.800 --> 1:06:37.800]  and confirmed that they suppressed evidence
[1:06:37.800 --> 1:06:40.800]  of massive adverse reactions and deaths
[1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:45.800]  and then passed on the data that had been filtered
[1:06:45.800 --> 1:06:48.800]  to the highest levels of the FDA.
[1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:51.800]  Well, a federal court ruled last week
[1:06:51.800 --> 1:06:54.800]  that they had to start releasing 500 pages a month
[1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:56.800]  of the hundreds of thousands of pages
[1:06:56.800 --> 1:06:59.800]  that they're saying will take 50-plus years to release now.
[1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:01.800]  So, in a way, the court gave them what they wanted.
[1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:04.800]  They said, give us 50-plus years to release in 55 years.
[1:07:04.800 --> 1:07:06.800]  They said, no, you got to start now,
[1:07:06.800 --> 1:07:09.800]  but it will actually take, strangely enough, 55 years.
[1:07:09.800 --> 1:07:11.800]  I've got the articles right here to do it.
[1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:14.800]  So, in a way, it's like in fables.
[1:07:14.800 --> 1:07:16.800]  You ask a genie for gold.
[1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:18.800]  You better ask for it 10 feet in front of you
[1:07:18.800 --> 1:07:20.800]  because it will drop the ton of gold on top of you.
[1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:23.800]  So, they said, let us wait 55 years.
[1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:25.800]  They said, okay, but you got to start now.
[1:07:25.800 --> 1:07:27.800]  Well, the first 30 pages came out,
[1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:30.800]  as many of you know, on Wednesday.
[1:07:30.800 --> 1:07:33.800]  Devastating information, just hard to even believe.
[1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:35.800]  And we went over that in great detail.
[1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:39.800]  Finally, there's some news articles about it two days later.
[1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:42.800]  Do you think I'm excited that this broke on Wednesday
[1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:44.800]  and that almost no one else covered it?
[1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:46.800]  It made me physically ill.
[1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:49.800]  Finally, last night and today, a bunch of articles finally.
[1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:53.800]  We'll show you some of those, but this is just earth-shaking.
[1:07:53.800 --> 1:07:55.800]  It makes me catch my breath.
[1:07:55.800 --> 1:07:57.800]  It makes me start having an anxiety attack
[1:07:57.800 --> 1:07:59.800]  because we know that there's children everywhere
[1:07:59.800 --> 1:08:02.800]  with Obama and Fauci at the elementary schools
[1:08:02.800 --> 1:08:04.800]  helping inject the children with something
[1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:06.800]  that is so damn deadly.
[1:08:06.800 --> 1:08:09.800]  So, it's very fortuitous that Barnes is here.
[1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:11.800]  There's been a new development with the Tennessee court.
[1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:13.800]  The courts are very active right now,
[1:08:13.800 --> 1:08:15.800]  so new info has come out of a better way to file,
[1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:17.800]  so he's filing next week now in this huge case
[1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:19.800]  with the whistleblower, but it's on record that's happening.
[1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:23.800]  But Barnes, wow, what a time to be alive.
[1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:26.800]  I mean, this is, if you wanted to be villains,
[1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:29.800]  Bill Gates and Fauci couldn't script something better
[1:08:29.800 --> 1:08:32.800]  where no matter what they do or how much censorship they pull,
[1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:34.800]  they are the new definition of the devil.
[1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:36.800]  They are the new Hitler's.
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:38.800]  Well, I mean, yeah, it's extraordinary.
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:40.800]  And the kind of power that they're trying to assert,
[1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:42.800]  what we're seeing that's good,
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:44.800]  is we're seeing courts push back on the attempts
[1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:46.800]  to basically recreate an emergency exception
[1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:48.800]  of the Constitution.
[1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:50.800]  The old Weimar Constitution of Europe
[1:08:50.800 --> 1:08:52.800]  was considered the greatest constitution of Europe at the time,
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:54.800]  yet it led to the rise of the Nazis,
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:56.800]  even though the Nazis never obtained majority support
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:08:58.800]  from the German public.
[1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:00.800]  When Hitler ran for president, he lost by 20 plus points.
[1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:02.800]  How did they seize power?
[1:09:02.800 --> 1:09:04.800]  They seized power because there was an emergency exception
[1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:06.800]  written into the Weimar Constitution.
[1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:08.800]  Well, the Biden administration has essentially tried
[1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:10.800]  to take the exception into the OSHA rules
[1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:12.800]  to mandate the vaccine, an emergency exception.
[1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:14.800]  And slow down on this, because this is important.
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:16.800]  Everybody's seen the Tom Cruise movie,
[1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:18.800]  this is very historically accurate, Valkyrie.
[1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:20.800]  They then tried to still use that emergency provision
[1:09:20.800 --> 1:09:22.800]  to get rid of Hitler.
[1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:24.800]  So Hitler used it to become a dictator with a Reichstag fire,
[1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:26.800]  and then the German high command,
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:28.800]  knowing that Germany was going to lose
[1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:30.800]  and tens of millions were going to die, which did,
[1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:32.800]  they tried to assassinate him using that plan, but it failed.
[1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:34.800]  I mean, it's recognized now as the greatest problem
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:36.800]  with the Weimar Constitution
[1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:38.800]  in any kind of constitutional government,
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:40.800]  is if there's any emergency exception, you have no rights.
[1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:42.800]  Well, that's how third world countries
[1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:44.800]  always get overthrown. Absolutely.
[1:09:44.800 --> 1:09:46.800]  And the Mexican saying that, you know,
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:48.800]  Constitution made of paper,
[1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:50.800]  blade made of steel, and the net effect of this
[1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:52.800]  has been that our Constitution
[1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:54.800]  deliberately chose to never have
[1:09:54.800 --> 1:09:56.800]  an emergency exception in it,
[1:09:56.800 --> 1:09:58.800]  even though at the time of the founders,
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:00.800]  there were pandemics every other year
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:02.800]  during the Revolutionary Era.
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:04.800]  The reason why there was no pandemic exception
[1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:06.800]  was because any emergency exception would swallow the rule.
[1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:08.800]  But what has happened historically,
[1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:10.800]  governments in the U.S.
[1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:12.800]  have tried to use emergency exception
[1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:14.800]  to do the detentions of people
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:16.800]  based on their ancestry in the case of the Kormatsu case,
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:18.800]  use it to do vaccinations under Jacobson,
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:20.800]  use it to do forced sterilization
[1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:22.800]  in eugenics in the 1920s,
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:24.800]  and the Biden administration has reopened
[1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:26.800]  that can of worms by trying to create,
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:28.800]  find everywhere in the law.
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:30.800]  Let's be clear, they're taking old eugenics law
[1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:32.800]  that was the model from America for the Nazis
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:34.800]  and bring it back, and they're citing.
[1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:36.800]  You warned about Amy Comey Barrett,
[1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:38.800]  when she was getting confirmed,
[1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:40.800]  she cited the damn case.
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:42.800]  That the Nazis cited at Nuremberg
[1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:44.800]  saying, don't put us in prison, we have this case.
[1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:46.800]  Exactly. The Jacobson decision
[1:10:46.800 --> 1:10:48.800]  was basically an exception to the constitutional
[1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:50.800]  rights and remedies that existed.
[1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:52.800]  It was used as the basis to do forced sterilization,
[1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:54.800]  then used as the basis to do forced detention camps.
[1:10:54.800 --> 1:10:56.800]  And what the Biden administration has done
[1:10:56.800 --> 1:10:58.800]  is they try to create, there's an emergency exception
[1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:00.800]  for OSHA safety rules.
[1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:02.800]  They try to mandate the vaccine in that context.
[1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:04.800]  They claimed an emergency exception for the CDC
[1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:06.800]  to grab all the housing.
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:08.800]  Exactly. They used the emergency exception as well
[1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:10.800]  to claim that they could mandate through
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:12.800]  Medicare and Medicaid.
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:14.800]  Every health group in the country
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:16.800]  was going to have to mandate vaccines.
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:18.800]  Then they used, in fact,
[1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:20.800]  you look at the Safer Task Force Committee,
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:22.800]  there's a good case by the American First
[1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:24.800]  Legal Foundation they brought in D.C.
[1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:26.800]  where what has happened is they actually used
[1:11:26.800 --> 1:11:28.800]  a committee, the Safer Task Force for coronavirus.
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:30.800]  You look at its legal origin.
[1:11:30.800 --> 1:11:32.800]  It's supposed to be a
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:34.800]  labor council for longshoremen.
[1:11:34.800 --> 1:11:36.800]  And they took the labor council for longshoremen,
[1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:38.800]  converted it into the Safer Task Force
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:40.800]  to mandate vaccines on everybody.
[1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:42.800]  Then, last but not least,
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:44.800]  they're using the emergency use authorization
[1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:46.800]  statute, which was for
[1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:48.800]  release of a special
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:50.800]  immunizing or therapeutic drug
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:52.800]  if a biologic agent was
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:54.800]  released during war.
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:56.800]  They're using that same emergency...
[1:11:56.800 --> 1:11:58.800]  biowar into the world provisions.
[1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:00.800]  Exactly. To now mandate the vaccine
[1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:02.800]  for children.
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:04.800]  The suit we are filing here in Texas
[1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:06.800]  that I talked to clients and they signed
[1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:08.800]  up this week to add to the suit
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:10.800]  is parents who are concerned of the
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:12.800]  misuse and abuse of emergency powers
[1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:14.800]  to inject their kids with an experimental
[1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:16.800]  drug that the kids don't need that is uniquely
[1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:18.800]  dangerous to the kids for a virus that is not...
[1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:20.800]  So, World War III,
[1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:22.800]  end of the world breaking case of nuclear war,
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:24.800]  biowar, emergency
[1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:26.800]  is being used here and people need to know
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:28.800]  when they see Kramer on TV
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:30.800]  or they see all these people saying,
[1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:32.800]  let's just have the military go door to door.
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:34.800]  It's been done before. No it hasn't.
[1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:36.800]  It was done in very select areas against poor people
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:38.800]  and black people and stuff like that and it never
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:40.800]  got off the books, but
[1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:42.800]  people stopped doing it. So just because
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:44.800]  there's some evil ass law still on the books
[1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:46.800]  doesn't mean we follow it. The way to think of it is
[1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:48.800]  these are all martial law type provisions.
[1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:50.800]  These are provisions meant to only break in case
[1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:52.800]  of emergency and what's happening is
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:54.800]  they're almost three years now into this
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:56.800]  and they're still using the same
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:58.800]  emergency excuses
[1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:00.800]  for extraordinary legal provisions
[1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:02.800]  to mandate that people take that whether
[1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:04.800]  it's the OSHA rule, whether it's the Medicare rule.
[1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:06.800]  And obviously it was a permanent emergency.
[1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:08.800]  Now people get it, it's never going to stop.
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:10.800]  Oh yeah, exactly because it's going to be a new variant
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:12.800]  every other six months. You believe Germany says
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:14.800]  February 1st, four sections begin
[1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:16.800]  door to door. That's going to be
[1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:18.800]  explosive. And it's going to be constant.
[1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:20.800]  All these people who got the vaccine who said
[1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:22.800]  okay, at least it won't be a problem. Even Jordan
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:24.800]  Peterson said he made the mistake of getting it
[1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:26.800]  thinking they'd finally leave him alone. Now they're
[1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:28.800]  going to be booster shots over. In fact, employers
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:30.800]  are now already starting to announce
[1:13:30.800 --> 1:13:32.800]  that if to be fully vaccinated, you now have to
[1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:34.800]  go get your booster. Oh, they've officially said a year
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:36.800]  and a half ago Gates said, oh, this is every quarter
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:38.800]  you get a shot. It was always baked in.
[1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:40.800]  It's going to be permanent. And then sooner or later
[1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:42.800]  it's what else do they need to put in your body for the
[1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:44.800]  purposes of health or security or safety? Well, they
[1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:46.800]  have the Omicron vaccines magically is ready.
[1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:48.800]  Yeah, exactly. And it's going to be constant.
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:50.800]  It's going to be new booster shots for each new variant.
[1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:52.800]  And even though it won't really work, they can't
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:54.800]  test it effectively to do so. And the data
[1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:56.800]  information that's now coming out, we also are
[1:13:56.800 --> 1:13:58.800]  looking at suit for our whistleblower because
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:00.800]  they lied about where she worked. The people
[1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:02.800]  that she worked for claims she didn't work for them.
[1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:04.800]  And yet we have the emails, the documents,
[1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:06.800]  the British Medical Journal confirmed. There's a lot
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:08.800]  of fraud involved. They're really
[1:14:08.800 --> 1:14:10.800]  why would they go to such great lengths
[1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:12.800]  to pretend that this whistleblower
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:14.800]  blew the whistle on the complete lack of
[1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:16.800]  safety and efficacy in the vaccines
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:18.800]  for COVID-19? Why would they pretend she wasn't
[1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:20.800]  even working for the COVID-19
[1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:22.800]  Pfizer clinical trials?
[1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:24.800]  I mean, unless because this is what criminal
[1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:26.800]  organizations do. I mean, this is Lex Luthor
[1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:28.800]  crap. It's because of what she knows is
[1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:30.800]  so damaging and so damning that they had to
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:32.800]  lie about her working there. So we're going to bring
[1:14:32.800 --> 1:14:34.800]  suit against the people there and one of the PR
[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:36.800]  we're going to sue people individually
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:38.800]  who are part of it. So a lot of these publicists
[1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:40.800]  are used to be able to lie for their clients
[1:14:40.800 --> 1:14:42.800]  without individual consequence and there needs
[1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:44.800]  to be individual consequences.
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:46.800]  We're going to go over this when we come back
[1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:48.800]  but what do you make of the
[1:14:48.800 --> 1:14:50.800]  American Heart Association being censored
[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:52.800]  by Twitter for saying, hey,
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:54.800]  there's an increased heart attack risk
[1:14:54.800 --> 1:14:56.800]  with Pfizer and Moderna on the label.
[1:14:56.800 --> 1:14:58.800]  They just pointed out there was a label
[1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:00.800]  and they said, well, you're not allowed to scare people.
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:02.800]  So they don't want you reading the fine print. I mean, this is
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:04.800]  next level
[1:15:04.800 --> 1:15:06.800]  evil. Well, that's one of the things we're adding to our
[1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:08.800]  suit is really the
[1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:10.800]  they are illegally violating
[1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:12.800]  the advertising rules. Both the Sesame
[1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:14.800]  Street did this, CDC
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:16.800]  you said that when you were on two weeks ago. Exactly.
[1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:18.800]  And you look at the detail. I was going through
[1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:20.800]  all the different laws and the laws require
[1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:22.800]  that they disclose this information
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:24.800]  that anything that's any adverse side
[1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:26.800]  effects, it has to be disclosed in any
[1:15:26.800 --> 1:15:28.800]  advertising or promotion
[1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:30.800]  of any drug period and here the people
[1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:32.800]  violating these laws are
[1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:34.800]  the FDA and CDC themselves
[1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:36.800]  because they're the ones putting out information
[1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:38.800]  about this vaccine that is
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:40.800]  mislabeled the vaccine. It's mislabeled
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:42.800]  as a vaccine in the first place. We're going to be challenging
[1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:44.800]  that as well and adding that to the suit.
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:46.800]  It's just a tissue of fraud. What do you call
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:48.800]  something when every it's a giant
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:50.800]  complex house of mirrors?
[1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:52.800]  I mean, they, well, they, it's a
[1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:54.800]  it is such a, well, what webs we weave when first
[1:15:54.800 --> 1:15:56.800]  we set out to deceive. So it is
[1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:24.800]  incredibly important to believe that
[1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:33.880]  on Prostigar with Salt Palm Meadow. It's 50% off again with free shipping and some items
[1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:39.680]  are even above 50% off. Go to infowarstore.com, get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get

[1:16:55.760 --> 1:17:02.560]  In late August, Info Wars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:08.920]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:14.120]  and financial collapse worldwide. Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been
[1:17:14.120 --> 1:17:17.840]  something that's important to have. It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking
[1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:23.040]  care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.

[1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:41.240]  and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place. So
[1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:47.540]  lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the Info War at infowarstore.com.
[1:17:47.540 --> 1:17:51.400]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[1:17:51.400 --> 1:17:54.640]  control. So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:59.640]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[1:17:59.640 --> 1:18:00.640]  Hello, Alex.
[1:18:00.640 --> 1:18:01.640]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:04.920]  All right. I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the
[1:18:04.920 --> 1:18:10.160]  line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, Super
[1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:15.800]  Mail Vitality and Brainforce Plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank.
[1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:20.800]  Super Mail Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:26.680]  that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:31.080]  It also worked quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine.
[1:18:31.080 --> 1:18:35.520]  In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[1:18:35.520 --> 1:18:38.880]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:43.880]  strong? That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes
[1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:48.760]  it's like super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this
[1:18:48.760 --> 1:19:14.760]  is it.
[1:19:14.760 --> 1:19:42.760]  The Rolls Royce at a decent price.
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:20:05.760]  The Rolls Royce at a decent price.
[1:20:12.760 --> 1:20:36.200]  All right. We're going to get into January 6th. We're going to get into just Lane Maxwell
[1:20:36.200 --> 1:20:41.840]  case. Now they're really controlling that. The judge said, oh, nothing lewd or upsetting
[1:20:41.840 --> 1:20:46.160]  to the public can be seen. Oh, for the children to not hear about children being raped, we're
[1:20:46.160 --> 1:20:51.040]  going to cover it up and keep it to only a few people. That's coming up next segment.
[1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:58.240]  But Barnes, Twitter slaps unsafe label on American Heart Association mRNA vaccine warning.
[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:03.600]  Our own Greg Reese's report showing of the new variant garbage got censored by Vimeo
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:08.960]  saying, oh, the UN, the WHO says this is inaccurate. Just even if he was lying, which he's not,
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:14.840]  the UN's in charge is YouTube now presuming to be in charge of science, big article on
[1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:20.800]  infowars.com by the Brownstone Institute that details all of this and lays it all out. And
[1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:25.120]  they are now big tech telling you what is science and what isn't. FDA expedites review
[1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:30.640]  process on Omicron vaccines and drugs. Oh, they're going to come up with whole new things
[1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:34.680]  they claim. Soon as it's authorized, even by emergency, now you got to take it. Soon
[1:21:34.680 --> 1:21:39.440]  as Biden says, hey, it's authorized for children the next day. Well, your child has to take
[1:21:39.440 --> 1:21:44.560]  it. Manchin joins GOP ever to Nick's Biden's vaccine mandate for large businesses. That
[1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:49.680]  is good news. Manchin's getting better and better. Infowars interviews, Robert F. Kennedy
[1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:55.800]  Jr. on COVID tyranny, a big, exclusive, long, powerful interview with Robert Kennedy Jr.,
[1:21:55.800 --> 1:22:00.120]  whom I'm just just really admire and is doing such a great job under massive attack for
[1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:03.920]  telling the truth. He is, he is really a champion. I need to pray for him. Big interview at
[1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:14.040]  band.video. Hope you share that. Legal victory. Court upholds Texas ban on school mask mandates
[1:22:14.040 --> 1:22:19.320]  and so much more. Also big news breaking over Gateway Pundit. More scientists and journalists
[1:22:19.320 --> 1:22:25.160]  exposing that all these studies indicate COVID-19 is a designed bio weapon with a toxic structure
[1:22:25.160 --> 1:22:32.760]  that may be replicated in vaccines. No, it's not maybe it is. Daily mail. AstraZeneca uncovers
[1:22:32.760 --> 1:22:39.200]  trigger a blood clots after its jab. Oh, they now admit it. And Biden unveils a plan to
[1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:44.800]  forcibly inject the world. That's here in America. Spanish investigation finds vaccine
[1:22:44.800 --> 1:22:50.200]  passports have no impact on infection rates. And look at these, Marshall Law in Germany,
[1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:54.800]  Merkel to enforce lockdown for unvaccinated. And they go on to report the articles, forced
[1:22:54.800 --> 1:23:01.000]  injections start February 1st. Wow, we could be talking a lot about that. New York City
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:05.040]  mandates five and up. Take the shot. See, oh, now they're authorized. Now they're mandated.
[1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:09.440]  Robert Barnes, finish up getting into the suit you're now filing next week. Some of
[1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:13.720]  the other suits you're involved in the big court battles that are happening. A lot of
[1:23:13.720 --> 1:23:19.400]  defeats for Big Pharma and the deep state. I think part of Omnicron being released wasn't
[1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:26.840]  just a smoke screen. The CIA pedophile rings will cover next segment, but also to smoke
[1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:31.240]  screen all of this information coming up. Yeah, I mean, I think, well, it finally court
[1:23:31.240 --> 1:23:36.400]  is stepping up because it's so excessive and so egregious and so over the top to say that
[1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:40.920]  you can have an emergency right to using the emergency declarer controls of OSHA, which
[1:23:40.920 --> 1:23:46.480]  is supposed to be about some something happens at a particular plant or in this context,
[1:23:46.480 --> 1:23:49.600]  like a whether it's a bio weapon or something else, nuclear plant blows up, you can declare
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:53.480]  emergency in the area. Exactly. You don't just declare an emergency because Fauci cooked
[1:23:53.480 --> 1:23:57.920]  the virus up. Precisely. Or you have something go wrong in some place. We got tornado hits
[1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:02.120]  a chemical factory, something like that. That's what the emergency rules are designed for.
[1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:05.680]  They haven't even used them in 30 plus years. And now they're using those to mandate a vaccine
[1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:09.960]  on over 100 million plus Americans. Then they take each thing that they have regulatory
[1:24:09.960 --> 1:24:15.000]  control over Medicare and Medicaid. The law specifically says you cannot use this to dictate
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:19.520]  terms of employment or try to try to practice medicine. And what do they do? They use it
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:22.520]  to dictate the terms of employment and try to practice medicine, because that's what
[1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:26.240]  this is requiring someone to get a certain medical treatment is effectively the practice
[1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:30.520]  of medicine and has been considered as such part of a suit that's pending in South Carolina.
[1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:34.640]  Exactly. It's like Biden's our doctor. Fauci's our doctor. Bill Gates is our they don't even
[1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:38.720]  see us. They just say, I don't care if you have immunity, you'll take this. Exactly.
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:42.520]  And so the so the courts have finally stepped in and said no to that. The circuit ruled
[1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:46.200]  it was invalid. The sixth circuit is considering it now for all the circuits. Then on top of
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:49.440]  that, the federal court in Louisiana said this didn't have any basis. And here's the
[1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:53.120]  other thing that's good about all these court cases. They're actually finally putting the
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:58.560]  test of evidence to the claims made by those who support a vaccine mandate. And what has
[1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:03.200]  happened throughout this entire pandemic policy public health interventions is that when they
[1:25:03.200 --> 1:25:08.600]  face judicial scrutiny, when they face evidentiary scrutiny, they fail. And that's what happened
[1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:12.120]  with what they court mentioned in the fifth circuit case in OSHA, what the federal court
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:15.120]  in Louisiana mentioned, another federal court in Kentucky mentioned, another federal court
[1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:18.240]  in Missouri mentioned. What all of them are saying is you look at the evidence, there
[1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:22.680]  is no evidence at all that vaccine mandates will reduce any level of transmission or of
[1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:26.640]  the virus do in fact to the variance and the existence of the variance and the variance
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:31.960]  constantly escape these vaccines as they always have. We've never had a successful coronavirus
[1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:35.920]  vaccine over a century of trying. There's going to be no such success here. More courts
[1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:40.160]  are recognizing that the evidence doesn't even support the very thin predicate by which
[1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:45.720]  they use these emergency powers to ram this down the American public. And now we're seeing
[1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:50.520]  additional examples of it. You go back to the advertising. What is FDA? FDA historically
[1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:56.480]  was a labeling agency. FDA was not a practicing medicine agency. It was supposed to be somebody
[1:25:56.480 --> 1:26:01.360]  to make sure that your green beans are actually green beans. It was back in the 19 to 1920s
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:06.120]  when people were mislabeling one kind of meat as another kind of meat. It was there to verify
[1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:10.600]  that instead of somebody giving you corn syrup, it was really honey. Exactly. It was just
[1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:14.800]  to verify that what is in this container is what they say. Precisely. What it never was
[1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:20.080]  supposed to be. Now, oh, it's secret. You can't know. Oh, secret government agreements.
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:24.040]  These aren't really scientists either. I mean, this is not some master super scientific
[1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:28.280]  super medical institution. That's not what they are. These are bureaucrats checking labels.
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:32.380]  But one of the things they are supposed to do is make sure the label matches the advertising.
[1:26:32.380 --> 1:26:36.380]  So what you're talking about there is when the American Medical Association simply points
[1:26:36.380 --> 1:26:41.200]  out what is required to be in the label and what is required to be in the label for these
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:47.720]  gene therapies disguised as vaccines is the risk of myocarditis, the risk of pericarditis.
[1:26:47.720 --> 1:26:52.600]  Because it is so substantial, so substantiated, seen so repeatedly. We see it in athletes
[1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:58.520]  literally dropping dead around the world right in front of our eyes on camera or suffering
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:02.960]  severe health consequences live at a rate we've never seen before. And who is the biggest
[1:27:02.960 --> 1:27:07.080]  risk factor? Young men for these heart problems from these vaccines. And just going back to
[1:27:07.080 --> 1:27:11.320]  what we were just talking about about the American Heart Association, other US senators
[1:27:11.320 --> 1:27:16.040]  being censored saying, well, the WHO doesn't agree with that. Why don't the senators, the
[1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:21.160]  House members and the American Heart Association, others get mad as institutions that say, what
[1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:25.840]  is the UN doing saying the American Heart Association can't point out that on these
[1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:29.200]  vaccines, there's been a warning. I mean, that's like, why can't the American Heart
[1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:34.160]  Association say blood's red? Well, blood's really red, but you're not the UN. So you're
[1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:38.840]  not allowed to say it. What's amazing here is the law actually requires that to be disclosed.
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:43.720]  The law requires all of the side effects to be listed. The law requires all the risks
[1:27:43.720 --> 1:27:49.520]  to be. So why such an insane hubris and arrogance? I mean, well, because the truth will set ordinary
[1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:53.280]  people free, but the truth will be a problem for those people who are trying to force this
[1:27:53.280 --> 1:27:58.160]  down everybody's throat. So this is all desperation. So why did they launch such a desperate operation?
[1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:01.760]  Because if I wanted to destroy myself, I was the power structure, I would start a fight
[1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:05.720]  like this. I think there's probably a lot of reasons for their motivation, but look
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:09.840]  at their history. Historically, nobody's meaningfully fought back. Historically, most people have
[1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:16.120]  fought. So psychos always go too far that they always in criminology just. And historically,
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:19.080]  it's like when psychopaths call the police department, I'm gonna kill tonight. You can't
[1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:23.280]  stop me. They just get reckless and more reckless completely. And historically, they have known
[1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:26.880]  that a lot of people around the world won't fight back. I mean, when the eugenics came
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:30.240]  through in the beginning of the 20th century, very few people fought back. Connie Buck didn't
[1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:33.920]  even have her own lawyer was a lawyer working for the other side in secret. So I mean, the
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:38.480]  ordinary person usually at Kormatsu, a few people fought back and they lost. So the system
[1:28:38.480 --> 1:28:41.800]  is used to winning and prevailing under these circumstances. So that's why and they just
[1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:45.480]  see a bunch of people they think are weak. So why not kill us exactly just run them over
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:49.200]  and they're used to it working and they are surprised at the degree of pushback. And when
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:54.000]  they get pushed back, what do they do? They become more and more desperate like Hitler
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:58.240]  and his bombing campaign of England that turned the brits towards so many people say to me,
[1:28:58.240 --> 1:29:06.320]  I have a question to ask you. Why would you spend your money this Christmas season to buy
[1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:12.800]  gifts for friends and family and loved ones with the establishment with the big corporations
[1:29:12.800 --> 1:29:18.880]  that are dedicated to waging war on all of our freedoms and suppressing us and forcing
[1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:24.120]  medical tyranny on us? I've never backed down to tyranny. We've had incredible success
[1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:29.760]  in supporting them. Thanks for your support. But now, as 2021 comes to a close, I want

[1:30:56.120 --> 1:31:00.920]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:05.840]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding onto a job and I heard
[1:31:05.840 --> 1:31:09.960]  Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival
[1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:14.000]  shield, the X1. And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter, you came out
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:17.280]  with F2. You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited
[1:31:17.280 --> 1:31:22.680]  about that. So I took it and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like
[1:31:22.680 --> 1:31:27.960]  my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[1:31:27.960 --> 1:31:32.480]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:36.920]  take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one
[1:31:36.920 --> 1:31:41.600]  I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing.
[1:31:41.600 --> 1:31:45.960]  It works. But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. That's a break free
[1:31:45.960 --> 1:31:49.840]  of the globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into
[1:31:49.840 --> 1:31:50.920]  our own hands.
[1:31:50.920 --> 1:31:55.960]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[1:31:55.960 --> 1:32:00.640]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:06.280]  between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other
[1:32:06.280 --> 1:32:11.080]  who are literally trying to create a post human world for the United States of Brazil.
[1:32:11.080 --> 1:32:15.360]  And of course, triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private
[1:32:15.360 --> 1:32:20.240]  corporate fascist world government. That's why they launched their great recess and their
[1:32:20.240 --> 1:32:27.360]  program after collapsing us of build back better. This is nothing more than a top down
[1:32:27.360 --> 1:32:32.360]  vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns because
[1:32:32.360 --> 1:32:37.160]  we wouldn't bow because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system
[1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:44.040]  could win. They released a biological weapon on us. Now we know two years ago, we learned
[1:32:44.040 --> 1:32:48.440]  about it about 20 months ago. It's that simple. They can't meet us because of our free speech
[1:32:48.440 --> 1:32:53.160]  and our guns. So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest of
[1:32:53.160 --> 1:33:00.160]  history. Expose this paradigm and we win.
[1:33:00.160 --> 1:33:07.160]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:18.160 --> 1:33:22.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Very, very honored
[1:33:22.160 --> 1:33:29.160]  to be here. Robert Barnes tried to shotgun with me. I don't like to make myself the
[1:33:29.160 --> 1:33:33.480]  subject of the show, just the enemy always does that. It's all over the news. Here's
[1:33:33.480 --> 1:33:38.640]  the headline on a gateway pundit. January 6th committee chairman, Benny Thompson says
[1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:44.240]  if you exercise your consciousness right by putting the fifth amendment, you're guilty.
[1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:49.400]  That's coming up next hour because this affects all Americans and in the civil suits realm
[1:33:49.400 --> 1:33:55.560]  of the democratic party against this, they've said we're defaulted and that violates the
[1:33:55.560 --> 1:34:00.840]  seventh amendment completely on its face. So this is the real tyranny going on and
[1:34:00.840 --> 1:34:06.400]  the incredible part is Owen Shroyer was never subpoenaed. Owen Shroyer was never deposed.
[1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:13.400]  He was deposed yesterday after he's defaulted. And how do you do that? No one's ever even
[1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:18.320]  heard of anything like this. They just do it, folks. That's why I go before that committee
[1:34:18.320 --> 1:34:22.040]  and tell the truth about what we did. It's all on video. It's all on record. We had a
[1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:25.680]  bunch of rallies in DC in the months preceding it. We went there to try to get them to have
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:31.520]  a 10 day investigation. And if I say the sky was, what color was the sky that day, Mr.
[1:34:31.520 --> 1:34:35.600]  Jones? Well, it was kind of gray and blue with some clouds and cold. Well, I thought
[1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:42.600]  the sky was purple. Way off at the edge of my binoculars. I can see a little purple spot.
[1:34:42.840 --> 1:34:48.920]  Five years in prison, sunny boy. And so they've got ongoing criminal investigations hovering
[1:34:48.920 --> 1:34:53.160]  around this. We'll hit this next hour, but just a couple minutes on this barn. So we'll
[1:34:53.160 --> 1:34:57.240]  get into the Gisling Maxwell cover up and what's happening there on the new CIA, child
[1:34:57.240 --> 1:35:02.920]  trafficking and where they admit it's going on. But what would you call this period? Just
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:07.520]  martial law? Yeah, it is. I mean, it's de facto martial law because it's using all the emergency
[1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:11.400]  powers. It's weaponizing the criminal justice process. I mean, right now, for example, they're
[1:35:11.400 --> 1:35:14.920]  going after everybody who did anything involving challenging the elections, including going
[1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:19.080]  after the lawyers. So I mean, the story leaked. It's clearly a great. They're saying in these
[1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:22.960]  subpoenas that there's no attorney client privilege. Exactly. I mean, and they're doing a criminal
[1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:27.680]  grand jury investigation right now of everybody who donated money to this, to Sidney Powell,
[1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:31.520]  or to defend the Republic or to General Flint. I mean, that came out of the Washington Post
[1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:35.000]  and it's coming clearly from U.S. Attorney Circle. And I think of the chilling effect
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:39.280]  there. Complete. And this is the put this is why is DC the middle of this? Why is the
[1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:43.160]  Southern District of New York always in the middle of this? Why did these two offices
[1:35:43.160 --> 1:35:48.120]  have such control over people that don't mean Sidney Powell lives in Texas? She's not from
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:54.000]  she's General Flynn isn't their political commissars. They're black holes. Exactly. I mean, there
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:59.720]  are nothing more than Soviet Stasi style police and Soviet and Stasi style prosecutors using
[1:35:59.720 --> 1:36:04.040]  the same methods and the same methodologies as those. I told people right now, for example,
[1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:09.040]  what January 6th defendant can get an impartial jury trial in the District of Columbia? That
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:13.040]  would be like expecting Martin Luther King to get a fair jury trial in front of an all
[1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:19.480]  white jury in 1950s Birmingham. It's not going to happen. So it's the same problem. In fact,
[1:36:19.480 --> 1:36:23.280]  I mean, Richard Barris to his credit has done the polling data that substantiates this.
[1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:27.440]  People should be looking and moving to transfer various proceedings. But this illicit effort
[1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:30.960]  to comment on Fifth Amendment rights that you're seeing a Congressman do is exactly what they
[1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:34.920]  tried to do in the written House case. They tried to the prosecutor, little banger, tried
[1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:38.680]  to illicitly comment on Kyle asserting his Fifth Amendment rights prior to taking the
[1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:43.280]  stand, which was a patent violation. And as the judge to his to his credit said, was a
[1:36:43.280 --> 1:36:48.320]  violation of 50 years of law. And here you have a Congressman doing the same thing. Exactly
[1:36:48.320 --> 1:36:53.480]  when the judge goes, Hey, wait, you just probably crossed the line on one of the biggest violations
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:57.720]  you could do claiming someone's a criminal. If they declare their fifth, did you just
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:37:01.200]  do that? Because I'll mistrial you right now. But because everybody knows you don't
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:06.000]  do that. So what do you make of him will play next hour on TV saying Alex Jones is a criminal
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:10.240]  if he declares the Fifth Amendment. I mean, it's a patent violation, the Fifth Amendment.
[1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:14.240]  It's important to recognize the Fifth Amendment applies to everybody. So all government actors
[1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:18.920]  cannot cannot illicitly comment on the Fifth Amendment. So it's a this whole committee is
[1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:22.960]  a joke. This committee is not a legislative committee. It should have no power to subpoena
[1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:26.760]  anybody. That's right. The chairman of the committee really is like the circus master.
[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:31.040]  No, that I mean, there's a good letter and response by other lawyers to this same committee
[1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:35.520]  pointing out there's not even a ranking member, a properly appointed by Congress to even make
[1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:39.240]  a proper objection to. I mean, this I mean, I remember when the Senate Intelligence Committee
[1:37:39.240 --> 1:37:43.560]  was investigating clients of mine, and I objected on various constitutional grounds, they ultimately
[1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:48.360]  backed off. That was that was a problematic committee in terms of their activity. This
[1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:52.880]  committee shouldn't even exist. It's a it's made up by Congress not to do legislation,
[1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:57.200]  but to do political witch on activity. And a few Republicans on the committee are neocon
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:01.960]  thoroughbreds. Exactly. They're not appointed by the regular constitutional process by which
[1:38:01.960 --> 1:38:07.120]  Congress establishes its own rules. So they these are illicit subpoenas, illicit summonses.
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:10.640]  This is an illicit attempt and now illicit commentary and violation of people's Fifth
[1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:13.720]  Amendment rights. Well, head it more next hour. We already you're just like me. We're
[1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:18.640]  getting into it now. But let's let's shift gears into Gisling Maxwell and that trial
[1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:23.440]  and Comey's daughters, the prosecution, they're very narrow. I mean, you talk about the fix
[1:38:23.440 --> 1:38:27.960]  being in they are just like Epstein got his neck broken in three places. I mean, they are
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:32.240]  breaking America's neck right in front of us. The whole goal of the prosecution has
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:37.320]  been to use this case to limit the scope of inquiry to make sure key names like the Clintons
[1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:41.280]  and others were never brought up to make sure that how Epstein got his money, which has
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:46.600]  never been explained, never comes up. Instead, that Robert Maxwell's name, the father of
[1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:50.760]  Glaine Maxwell never comes up. The history of all the different intelligence agencies
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:54.880]  connected to her and her father and Epstein never come up. And in fact, that's what the
[1:38:54.880 --> 1:38:58.440]  prosecution has done. They're keeping it very limited. They're making it sound like the
[1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:02.920]  only person who ever victimized any of these individuals was just Epstein, not all of his
[1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:06.120]  pals and buddies. Well, I forget the exact quote we covered a few days ago, but when
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:11.320]  the trial started, the judge said, anything that's lewd or bad or, you know, shocking
[1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:14.840]  will be covered up. I mean, she said we're not gonna let anything shocking come out.
[1:39:14.840 --> 1:39:19.920]  And I mean, you did this, they're raping children. They're running sex slavery. I mean, I'm
[1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:23.920]  sorry, everybody gets to hear about it. They're filming the trial inside the courtroom, but
[1:39:23.920 --> 1:39:27.800]  they're only allowing other people at the courthouse to watch that video trial. Why
[1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:31.920]  not let the entire world have public access to the trial to see what's really going on,
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:35.280]  to see what's really happening, to see what the evidence really is. They don't want that
[1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:39.400]  to happen. I mean, isn't this judge by doing this who just got nominated by Schumer for
[1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:44.640]  appellate court? I mean, if you cover up something, don't you become a party to it? Well, it
[1:39:44.640 --> 1:39:48.480]  goes back to the Pentagon Papers case. Remember what happened? The federal judge, the Nixon
[1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:51.240]  administration, was secretly talking to him behind the scenes, saying they would make
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:55.160]  him head of the FBI or whatever else he wanted, as long as he made sure that he convicted
[1:39:55.160 --> 1:40:00.720]  Ellsberg. So is it really a coincidence that's right on the eve of this judge handling this
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:04.000]  trial? All of a sudden, the Biden administration says, hey, we'll make you a prestigious second
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:08.960]  circuit judge. But after the trial is over, I mean, I mean, it looks like a quid pro quo.
[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:13.520]  And Ellsberg did the right thing because he's at the Pentagon and they're going, the war
[1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:16.880]  is unwinnable, but we're going to keep doing it forever. And he goes, screw this, we're
[1:40:16.880 --> 1:40:23.000]  injecting children, we've got pedophiles running things. This is insane. Well, no, I mean,
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:27.960]  here's what's amazing. How is it given the tight ties between Bill Gates and Bill Clinton
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:31.040]  and these other people with the Epstein's that Bill Gates's name has not come up at
[1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:34.600]  all, but Donald Trump's name has come up like five times. It tells you how the Southern
[1:40:34.600 --> 1:40:38.760]  District of New York's entire objective was to manipulate these proceedings so that key
[1:40:38.760 --> 1:40:43.480]  democratic allies would not be exposed for their long history of misconduct and personal
[1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:47.920]  malfeasance in this precise space. And that's why this sex trafficking ring has stayed very
[1:40:47.920 --> 1:40:52.440]  limited because the prosecution is manipulating the case to make sure the full evidence never
[1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:53.440]  comes out.
[1:40:53.440 --> 1:41:01.040]  And let's go to this next point. Here it is. CIA covered up staff sex crimes against children.
[1:41:01.040 --> 1:41:07.560]  Child sex abusers at CIA avoided prosecution. Jeffrey Epstein visited the Clinton White House
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:13.360]  17 times we know of, and now they found 700 plus new FAA records that don't have Trump's
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:17.000]  name on it. And I'm not defending Trump. Just they keep bringing him up at trial with no
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:19.800]  evidence when these guys were all there, including Bill Gates.
[1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:24.120]  Exactly. The whole goal is to divert attention to make this look like it was a limited deal
[1:41:24.120 --> 1:41:29.240]  that it doesn't implicate or does no ramifications for Wall Street people for Bill Gates, for
[1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:33.880]  Bill Clinton, for a lot of democratic key allies, Bill Richardson, other people that
[1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:37.520]  were known to be very tight to Epstein and involved with him.
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:42.600]  And notice, while this whole critical preparation to end the dollar, bring us on this new currency,
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:46.600]  collapse the country, the trials right now to remind all the thousands that were part
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:51.760]  of the sex ring, hey, we could burn you any time we want. The trials live right now.
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:54.920]  Exactly. It's a reminder that they ultimately control it, that all these people work for
[1:41:54.920 --> 1:41:58.360]  them at some key level. Which, I mean, Galene Maxwell knows that personally because when
[1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:02.120]  her father was going to talk, he all of a sudden fell off a boat and drowned. So, I
[1:42:02.120 --> 1:42:07.480]  mean, his father was, her father was tied to the Soviets, to Mossad, to the CIA, to
[1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:08.480]  MI6.
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:11.800]  And just look at all the Hollywood people on that plane. I mean, it's this big name
[1:42:11.800 --> 1:42:15.160]  after big name after big name after big name. And yet some really surprised. What do you
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:18.160]  have ones on there?
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:23.960]  Yes, I mean, it's, I, I, well, I can't get into it. There may have been records in a
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:27.680]  fox's in a hen house. Yeah. Well, yeah, exactly. What do you have ones on a pedophile plane?
[1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:31.360]  Come on. I don't believe that. Or is it ridiculous? Or is X. Remember the X? What's her name?
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:35.080]  The famous actress, her brother was a long pedophile. It's all a bunch of sick freaks,
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:38.560]  man. Yeah. Yeah. You're once you're around Hollywood, you understand that culture is
[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:42.360]  just sick at its core. But their ability to keep all this secret is impressive. To have
[1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:45.960]  a criminal prosecution at the show trial, that's mostly about what they're not showing.
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:51.000]  Well, they've done a great job keeping it to like the 14, 15, 16 year old young women
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:54.920]  who are little girls still. But I mean, no folks, they're strangling five year old children
[1:42:54.920 --> 1:42:57.040]  to death from my research.
[1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:02.560]  For a fraction, I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:07.800]  I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their
[1:43:07.800 --> 1:43:13.200]  tracks before they went operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes,
[1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:18.600]  we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:23.040]  deindustrialization great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever that all
[1:43:23.040 --> 1:43:27.720]  viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready
[1:43:27.720 --> 1:43:31.600]  to wake up and ready to hear the truth. So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[1:43:31.600 --> 1:43:35.520]  and trying to stop their agenda. We've also got to get personally prepared. And one of
[1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:38.960]  the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best food ready
[1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:44.400]  to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com. So whether it's a month or six month or a
[1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:49.680]  year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now. Lock your orders in before
[1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:54.440]  food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits. Because believe me, serious
[1:43:54.440 --> 1:43:57.360]  times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:57.360 --> 1:44:09.920]  If you only knew the power of the dark side, join Bill Gates and together we will defeat
[1:44:09.920 --> 1:44:20.320]  humanity. Then our God will reward us with eternal life. That's basically the ethos of
[1:44:20.320 --> 1:44:28.120]  the globalists. They must first play God. They must first prove that they are the fittest
[1:44:28.120 --> 1:44:33.080]  in their social Darwinistic system. And in a way they're right. If we let them lie to
[1:44:33.080 --> 1:44:38.840]  us and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming
[1:44:38.840 --> 1:44:45.920]  and out in the open. We really deserve what's happened to us. So I ask you now, are you going
[1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:51.680]  to step up and expose the dual order even more? I know I'm pledging to step up and
[1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:58.600]  redouble my efforts. The front lines of the fight is infowarstore.com. The globalists
[1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:04.680]  are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals
[1:45:04.680 --> 1:45:09.040]  added to the food. It's all come out. And they're doing that not because we're weak,
[1:45:09.040 --> 1:45:14.440]  but because we're made the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful. And the social
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:19.640]  engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that
[1:45:19.640 --> 1:45:27.320]  nobody knows who first came up with the boy. Is it true? The propaganda would not be necessary
[1:45:27.320 --> 1:45:33.040]  if the situation was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:39.880]  their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the
[1:45:39.880 --> 1:45:44.560]  end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser. And that's why it's so important
[1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:48.000]  that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever. Because even if you don't
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:53.960]  believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is a channel. And we are opposing
[1:45:53.960 --> 1:45:56.960]  the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[1:45:56.960 --> 1:46:03.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, keep us on air. We'll continue to bring you the band
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:08.360]  guests will continue to bring the information that no one else will touch. Keep us on air.

[1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:17.080]  live supplement line, the vitamin D three with calcium gummies, the vitamin C with

[1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:27.960]  And you know, I'm telling you the vitamin D gummies, this is a great thing for your
[1:46:27.960 --> 1:46:32.240]  kids. They're going to love it. They're going to love the taste of the gummies. It's healthy.
[1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:35.520]  So that's just a great thing for kids. I mean, we could just be marketing campaigns. I think
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:43.240]  for kids that'd be great. The calcium good for them, the vitamin D. So that's at infowarstore.com.

[1:30:43.580 --> 1:47:47.520]  And we got a Gateway Pundit article right here. I was asking Barnes when he would
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:54.440]  hit next. It was this January 6 committee chairman, Benny Thompson says, if you exercise
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:47:59.760]  your constitutional right by pleading the fifth, you're guilty. And they're voting for
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:04.320]  another contempt charge against another person that's been subpoenaed, saying they want to
[1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:10.120]  put him in jail for years over that on Wednesday, the sham committee reading from the article,
[1:48:10.120 --> 1:48:18.680]  but to hold former Trump DOJ official Jeffrey Clark in contempt for defying a subpoena.
[1:48:18.680 --> 1:48:26.160]  And here is a clip of what he said on Mr. Manow's show last night, legal. And rather
[1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:34.320]  than be responsible and answer, he's pleading the fifth. Now, the question is, did you participate
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:44.360]  in these illegal activities in the White House? As you know, he recommended a process by which
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:50.720]  the elections could be manipulated in certain states. Well, that's clearly illegal. But
[1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:58.160]  we need to hear from him whether or not he said it. We have reason to believe he did.
[1:48:58.160 --> 1:49:05.600]  But if he's of the opinion that if I come before the committee and acknowledge that,
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:14.880]  then I have contributed to the January 6 insurrection in part simply because I made a recommendation
[1:49:14.880 --> 1:49:22.040]  that ultimately led states to believe that they could overturn the election. Look at what
[1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:29.000]  went on in Arizona. Look what tried to go on in Michigan. Look at Georgia. We had the
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:36.680]  Secretary of State in Georgia basically say the president called me and tried to get me
[1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:43.040]  to somehow find enough votes to change the outcome of the election. Well, this is part
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:49.160]  of what we believe Mr. Clark knew about and part of his recommendation. That's why he
[1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:53.400]  needs to come before the committee. But if he's saying, okay, I'll come, but I'll plead
[1:49:53.400 --> 1:50:01.560]  the fifth, then in some instances, that saves you part and parcel guilty to what occurred.
[1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:08.320]  Okay. So, Robert Barnes is constitutional lawyer looking at that. I mean, I'm literally
[1:50:08.320 --> 1:50:14.480]  in this guy's crosshairs. The idea, everything Trump did, Trump listed in the phone call,
[1:50:14.480 --> 1:50:18.920]  which they edited, but later got released, all the evidence of the ballots they found
[1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:23.320]  and the fraud. He said, you know, you found that show it. You just show the fraud. It's
[1:50:23.320 --> 1:50:27.760]  there. He didn't say go find it and make it up. He said, it's there. Just show it. Now
[1:50:27.760 --> 1:50:31.880]  it's been vindicated in all those states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia on
[1:50:31.880 --> 1:50:37.920]  and on and on. We know that now. But to have him up there then saying, oh, questioning
[1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:42.880]  elections is illegal. We were there protesting for a 10 day Senate investigations in the
[1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:47.880]  Constitution that what Democrats four years before called for, Barnes. Yeah, there's
[1:50:47.880 --> 1:50:51.840]  several problems. First of all, Congress has no constitutional authority to do what he's
[1:50:51.840 --> 1:50:55.520]  talking about. They have no constitutional authority to go around and act like they're
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:51:00.080]  the executive branch. This is the legislative branch trying to usurp the constitutional
[1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:05.600]  authority that is exclusive to the executive branch, just like they're doing on the presidential
[1:51:05.600 --> 1:51:10.200]  privilege saying Trump should give his records over. Absolutely. The only Congress can only
[1:51:10.200 --> 1:51:15.120]  do investigations and can only subpoena information and can only subpoena witnesses if it has
[1:51:15.120 --> 1:51:20.360]  a legislative purpose. In other words, it has to be for knowing where there's issues
[1:51:20.360 --> 1:51:23.840]  for the purposes of the Congress passes the highway bill. They find out a bunch of it
[1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:28.000]  got stolen. They can subpoena the people. Exactly. They could also do so if if they
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:32.560]  wanted to pass a new law, for example, governing that process, then they could hear what he's
[1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:35.920]  admitting is that they're inquiring as to whether somebody made certain statements that
[1:51:35.920 --> 1:51:39.840]  could be used against them for criminal purposes. That is not the authority. Oh, yeah, they
[1:51:39.840 --> 1:51:44.920]  got prosecutors all over TV, former and current going, we're going to use this to find dirt
[1:51:44.920 --> 1:51:48.120]  on them to indict them. And you're like, well, then just tell them, no, they'll say anything
[1:51:48.120 --> 1:51:52.280]  we say is criminal. It is. They have no authority in the first place to exercise just because
[1:51:52.280 --> 1:51:57.240]  an agency has a summons or subpoena power, just because Congress has a subpoena power.
[1:51:57.240 --> 1:52:01.720]  Doesn't mean this is like Congress announcing offices all over the country for law enforcement.
[1:52:01.720 --> 1:52:04.840]  Exactly. Which is what they're doing. When do they get a Praetorian Guard? Precisely.
[1:52:04.840 --> 1:52:08.360]  The Capitol Police has no business outside of the District of Columbia. So it's a giant
[1:52:08.360 --> 1:52:12.560]  power grab. Absolutely. They want a secret police and now they want the authorities as
[1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:15.760]  if they were the grand jury. And now they want to be able to refer people for criminal
[1:52:15.760 --> 1:52:20.240]  crimes. So they're usurping all powers themselves that has a name. It's called Dictator. Absolutely.
[1:52:20.240 --> 1:52:25.920]  And it's a power that our Constitution deliberately, as the court in Louisiana just recently said,
[1:52:25.920 --> 1:52:30.320]  said the whole purpose of a tripartite mechanism method of government is that different branches
[1:52:30.320 --> 1:52:33.640]  of government handle those responsibilities accountable to them. That's why our system
[1:52:33.640 --> 1:52:38.320]  is way superior than the parliamentary. Absolutely. It's that no one branch of government, no
[1:52:38.320 --> 1:52:43.120]  one person within government has all of the powers of government. And that is being taken
[1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:48.040]  away by this committee. This is an illegal committee that was illicitly formed, illicitly
[1:52:48.040 --> 1:52:53.280]  under the rules of Congress itself, illicitly created. And it's now using illicit power
[1:52:53.280 --> 1:52:57.840]  to subpoena people. It does not have the constitutional authority to subpoena in the first place.
[1:52:57.840 --> 1:53:00.480]  And just to be clear, I'm not even a lawyer and I know all this. You're a well-known
[1:53:00.480 --> 1:53:05.640]  renowned lawyer. This is like two plus two equals four. This is like known set law. This
[1:53:05.640 --> 1:53:09.840]  isn't like some weird debate. Oh, exactly. I mean, I dare anyone to go out there and
[1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:14.720]  find another special select committee created like this that looks indistinguishable from
[1:53:14.720 --> 1:53:20.280]  a grand jury whose subpoenas have ever been approved of by any court. They have occasionally
[1:53:20.280 --> 1:53:24.360]  tried to do this in the past and each time the courts have stepped in and said, no, you
[1:53:24.360 --> 1:53:28.120]  have no constitutional authority to just go after and invest. And you got the head of
[1:53:28.120 --> 1:53:33.760]  the committee suing Trump. Exactly. How are you? You have the judge. He's a judge, basically.
[1:53:33.760 --> 1:53:39.360]  Are the jury foreman, grand jury? He's the prosecutor. How does he then party to what
[1:53:39.360 --> 1:53:43.720]  he's doing? He can't be. And that's the problem. And here he is saying he's going to do this
[1:53:43.720 --> 1:53:48.400]  solely for the purpose to find criminal information on people, solely for the purposes of referring
[1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:51.760]  them for criminal prosecution, none of which is supposed to be within his authority in
[1:53:51.760 --> 1:53:56.880]  the first place. And by the way, he's prejudging as the judge. Now that we have this legislative
[1:53:56.880 --> 1:54:01.680]  judiciary, we don't care about the judiciary legislating, we now have the legislation being
[1:54:01.680 --> 1:54:07.400]  the judges. He's saying they're guilty up front on TV. And the only how the hell do
[1:54:07.400 --> 1:54:11.480]  you even go before such a monstrosity? It's insanity. And the other problem is that the
[1:54:11.480 --> 1:54:15.320]  courts have not been proactive enough at allowing people to challenge these. So when the Senate
[1:54:15.320 --> 1:54:18.680]  Intelligence Committee was going after people for similar witch hunt reasons, but at least
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:24.160]  it was a legitimate committee, this committee was created in complete violation of Congress's
[1:54:24.160 --> 1:54:29.280]  own rules for creating committees. So this committee is itself constitutionally questionable,
[1:54:29.280 --> 1:54:33.320]  and its use of subpoena power completely outside of constitutional authority, because it has
[1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:37.360]  no legislative purpose. Nothing about this as a legislative purpose. And they're trying
[1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:42.440]  to breach privileges, trying to breach attorney client privileges, breach presidential privileges,
[1:54:42.440 --> 1:54:45.840]  breach executive privilege. And now they're trying to even breach the Fifth Amendment
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:49.280]  privilege by saying if you assert it, we will lie about you and say it's a criminal
[1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:53.240]  admission to the world. So what is this? Just a gang raping of everything that's America?
[1:54:53.240 --> 1:54:56.640]  At this point it is. I mean, and the only question is, at what point do other parts
[1:54:56.640 --> 1:55:00.520]  of government step in? And what points do other people step in? At what points do people
[1:55:00.520 --> 1:55:04.040]  assert their remedies? Well, Tucker Carlson says it's horrible. I mean, who else will
[1:55:04.040 --> 1:55:07.240]  stand up? I mean, that's the problem. Too much of the institutional media is happy to
[1:55:07.240 --> 1:55:11.880]  see this happen because they want it to occur. They think short term, they're defeating
[1:55:11.880 --> 1:55:16.360]  their enemy. Like if they said about some of my enemies, hey, let's just let's go kill
[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:20.600]  them. I would say no, because next I'll be killed. I mean, don't they get that? Well,
[1:55:20.600 --> 1:55:23.320]  they don't. They don't have respect for the rule of law. They believe the ends justify
[1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:26.640]  the means. It's part of the whole left takeover, which is why the Third World is the Third
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:31.400]  World. Exactly. Why the ends justifies the means creates North Korea. Yes, I mean, it's
[1:55:31.400 --> 1:55:35.520]  why, you know, people are quoting various authors from the days of the Soviet Union
[1:55:35.520 --> 1:55:38.720]  because their understanding and description of the Soviet Union is more applicable and
[1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:44.240]  analogous Alexander Schultz and Aisin precisely. And because his explaining of that world
[1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:47.880]  makes more sense of our world. Oh, you read you like a repellent. I was rereading it two
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:53.080]  weeks ago. It's so thick. I only read like a hundred pages, but it's like it's deja vu.
[1:55:53.080 --> 1:55:56.960]  Well, exactly. I mean, they lie. They know they lie. We know they're lying. And yet they
[1:55:56.960 --> 1:56:00.880]  lie anyway, because that's the point. And yeah, prove that they can do so the prove
[1:56:00.880 --> 1:56:05.520]  that you will not be able to resist and push back. And then that it's just going to require
[1:56:05.520 --> 1:56:09.360]  continue, push back in the court of public opinion, continue to push back in the court
[1:56:09.360 --> 1:56:13.160]  of law, continue to push back in the court of politics at every single level and layer
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:18.440]  we can, because this isn't a power grab that is historically for Americans, unparalleled
[1:56:18.440 --> 1:56:22.400]  and unprecedented. And that's why it must be fought because it's a threat to constitutional
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:26.280]  liberty itself, which is ultimately a threat as you note to everybody's liberty. And that's
[1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:29.680]  what the gaslighting is is be like if you came home and your wife acted like you weren't
[1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:33.480]  there or your husband, you're like, Hey, I'm your husband. We have kids that the kids
[1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:38.280]  are, Hey, mommy, our daddy. And they're just not, they just, but instead of not talking
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:42.760]  to you, they go, Hello, I'm from Mars. I eat green snails for dinner. And it doesn't even
[1:56:42.760 --> 1:56:45.920]  make sense. It's like just a weird attack on reality.
[1:56:45.920 --> 1:56:48.800]  Completely, because it usually it works. I mean, the, I mean, from the old Broadway
[1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:53.600]  play, a gaslight that, you know, graded the term, it works to a great effectiveness. And
[1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:56.720]  they've seen this work. I mean, I was talking with the some of the crew before this, it's
[1:56:56.720 --> 1:57:01.120]  like, you look at it, you know, terrorism, war, crime, none of those, none of these things
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:05.560]  got people to forfeit their liberties. The way a scary virus has got people to do so.
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:10.480]  I mean, it's invisible. It's perfect. I mean, you're afraid of your own children. You're
[1:57:10.480 --> 1:57:14.240]  afraid of your own loved ones. You're afraid of your own. It makes everybody the enemy.
[1:57:14.240 --> 1:57:19.560]  Absolutely. Including yourself. Yes. But only the big doctors up there, big pharma, they'll
[1:57:19.560 --> 1:57:25.440]  save us. Exactly. We can trust them. Pope Fauti is the only one that is the rescuer.
[1:57:25.440 --> 1:57:28.320]  And then thus has all the power. And that's why it's going to keep kind of continuing
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:32.560]  unabated. What do we cover the next hour, Robert Barnes? So I mean, I think this and
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:36.280]  a lot, I mean, it's the continued assault on the rule of law and rule of liberty in America
[1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:40.520]  that the only pushback has been ordinary people, but it's been a very successful pushback.
[1:57:40.520 --> 1:57:44.640]  So that's right, we're going to cover it all and the conflict escalation paradigm an hour
[1:57:44.640 --> 1:57:53.880]  number three. Let's go ahead and take another call. I have a question to ask you. Why would
[1:57:53.880 --> 1:57:58.760]  you spend your money this Christmas season to buy gifts for friends and family and loved
[1:57:58.760 --> 1:58:05.040]  ones with the establishment, with the big corporations that are dedicated to waging
[1:58:05.040 --> 1:58:11.240]  war on all of our freedoms and suppressing us and forcing medical tyranny on us? I've
[1:58:11.240 --> 1:58:17.080]  never backed down to tyranny. We've had incredible successes fighting them. Thanks for your support.
[1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:23.840]  But now as 2021 comes to a close, I want to encourage you now more than ever to support
[1:58:23.840 --> 1:58:32.800]  the truth. And you do that at infowarstore.com. Storewide free shipping, double-patriot, huge
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:38.280]  deals of bottom mineral fusion, DNA force plus lung cleanse and turbo force. And these
[1:58:38.280 --> 1:58:43.760]  are really amazing high quality products that also fund the info war. The only way you fail
[1:58:43.760 --> 1:58:48.600]  is not taking action.
[1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:54.600]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games. I like going to concerts. I
[1:58:54.600 --> 1:58:59.720]  like going to play golf. I like going out to dinner. I like the metropolitan life. I
[1:58:59.720 --> 1:59:04.760]  like everything that comes with this. But see, I have the survival instinct that is
[1:59:04.760 --> 1:59:10.600]  to get the hell out of Democrat run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas.
[1:59:10.600 --> 1:59:14.880]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down. Is it time to just move
[1:59:14.880 --> 1:59:18.760]  out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods, just get off grid,
[1:59:18.760 --> 1:59:22.840]  just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land? That's the survival instinct.
[1:59:22.840 --> 1:59:26.640]  But see, the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no,
[1:59:26.640 --> 1:59:31.080]  no, no, no. Stay in the city. The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere
[1:59:31.080 --> 1:59:35.720]  there's ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask. That's the internal struggle
[1:59:35.720 --> 1:59:41.560]  that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well. But you can at least have
[1:59:41.560 --> 1:59:45.760]  some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies. And so we have the best ones at
[1:59:45.760 --> 1:59:55.080]  m4warstore.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex
[1:59:55.080 --> 1:59:55.960]  Jones.
[1:59:55.960 --> 2:00:16.400]  We were here with Robert Barnes during the break talking about the January 6th committee
[2:00:16.400 --> 2:00:23.880]  chairman, Benny Thompson, saying anybody that declares the fifth is a criminal. And he goes
[2:00:23.880 --> 2:00:29.080]  on to say we know they're criminals. So you have the judge, he's declared in the court
[2:00:29.080 --> 2:00:34.360]  saying the people I'm trying are criminals or his political enemies. And if they declare
[2:00:34.360 --> 2:00:38.120]  the fifth, they're even more criminal. I mean, this is like a cartoon or something. This
[2:00:38.120 --> 2:00:39.120]  is ridiculous.
[2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:42.200]  And as you know, did he has a personal conflict of interest because he has a personal suit
[2:00:42.200 --> 2:00:46.360]  against the president concerning the events of January 6th. And he's also getting completely
[2:00:46.360 --> 2:00:50.520]  wrong. Like everything he said in there about somehow it's illicit for the states to contest
[2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:51.960]  the electoral college. No, it's not.
[2:00:51.960 --> 2:00:55.480]  That's in the damn Constitution. Absolutely. It's designed to be that way. The states get
[2:00:55.480 --> 2:00:59.160]  to make those determinations. The states are supposed to be able to sue one another to
[2:00:59.160 --> 2:01:04.320]  resolve it. And yeah, unfortunately, the Supreme Court just decided to take a nap rather than
[2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:08.360]  do their job. But the but that doesn't change what their constitutional rights were. Not
[2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:13.080]  only that, Vice Presidents before Pence decided to take a walk and not do anything about it,
[2:01:13.080 --> 2:01:17.960]  like the Supreme Court did, probably both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson had made decisions
[2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:22.880]  about contested issues concerning electoral college disputes and controversy. So the idea
[2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:26.240]  that telling the Vice President he had that power, he had that authority was actually
[2:01:26.240 --> 2:01:30.800]  not only constitutionally correct, it was historically accurate and no less of authorities
[2:01:30.800 --> 2:01:35.880]  as John Adams and Thomas Jefferson exercise that authority. So his statements about what
[2:01:35.880 --> 2:01:40.680]  you can and can't argue for what you can and can't do what power the states do or do not
[2:01:40.680 --> 2:01:42.880]  have. All of that is false.
[2:01:42.880 --> 2:01:47.360]  Not only that, all of these January 6 claims for the most part are based on a made up application
[2:01:47.360 --> 2:01:50.760]  of the obstruction statute. Because here's the other dangerous place they're going. They're
[2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:55.520]  saying if you do anything that in my mind makes it more difficult for me to do my job
[2:01:55.520 --> 2:02:00.360]  as a congressman, I can now send you to prison for 20 years, because that's their assertion.
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:03.960]  And that's why they're setting up police departments. No, they're announcing their
[2:02:03.960 --> 2:02:09.040]  power and exercising it. Like you said, the old Mexicans saying, constitutions are made
[2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:12.640]  of paper, but my knife is made out of steel.
[2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:17.280]  Exactly. And it was the reason why the many great rights in the Mexican constitution that
[2:02:17.280 --> 2:02:22.200]  have been dead letter law from the time they were put on the constitution parchment itself.
[2:02:22.200 --> 2:02:26.200]  So all of it is dangerous because this is just power grab after power grab after power
[2:02:26.200 --> 2:02:29.440]  grab after power grab. And they're trying in and place after place after place.
[2:02:29.440 --> 2:02:33.280]  So we're going the way that every other great republic fell. Can we save ourselves or are
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:36.000]  we just going to be worse than Mexico in five years?
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:39.720]  It's going to require ordinary people continue to do it, to fight in the court of law, fight
[2:02:39.720 --> 2:02:43.880]  in the court of public opinion. And that pushback is what they didn't expect. They have never
[2:02:43.880 --> 2:02:48.480]  lost this many vaccine cases ever. In fact, they had the whether it was the state government,
[2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:52.280]  federal government, whether it was private enterprise had never lost the vaccine mandate
[2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:56.560]  case at this scale in history. And now they've lost more in two months than they'd lost
[2:02:56.560 --> 2:02:59.000]  in the 200 years prior. Well, that's the good news. We'll talk about
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:02.360]  when we come back in a few minutes. But yeah, they're fine. I mean, I'm not lauding the
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:07.600]  courses I've been before the rigged ones. But I mean, why are so many courts saying
[2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:10.240]  no to this just because it's on its face of fraud?
[2:03:10.240 --> 2:03:15.360]  Because it's so broad and two reasons. One reason is it's so the what the power they're
[2:03:15.360 --> 2:03:19.680]  asserting and usurping is so extraordinary, so excessive. So courts are a little greedy
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:22.240]  about their power. Exactly. And they're not willing to let them
[2:03:22.240 --> 2:03:25.680]  go that far. The other is the court of public opinion. This is credit to the court of public
[2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:31.440]  opinion. So federal court judges may not be are by definition out of touch, but they're
[2:03:31.440 --> 2:03:35.000]  not so far out of touch that they don't see what Tucker Carlson says, and they don't see
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:39.680]  what you know, the is broadly within conservative media. And because so many people have fought
[2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:44.600]  back, that led to governors and state legislatures fighting back. So a consensus is forming.
[2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:48.320]  Exactly. And people on the right now recognize that vaccine mandates are a bad idea that
[2:03:48.320 --> 2:03:52.240]  all these pandemic politics was a bad idea. And consequently, they're getting on the right
[2:03:52.240 --> 2:03:56.960]  side and they're only doing that. I mean, I mean, like take DeSantis, where was he 10
[2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:00.880]  months ago? Right? He could have been there early, but they're responding to the court
[2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:03.120]  of public opinion. They're not the same thing with Abbott.
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:07.000]  Exactly. Abbott could have been there right away. The Texas Attorney General Paxson could
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:10.160]  have been there right away. A lot of these people were slow to the party, but it's good
[2:04:10.160 --> 2:04:13.960]  that they're finally at the party. But they're only at the party because of the willingness
[2:04:13.960 --> 2:04:18.000]  and readiness of ordinary people to fight back in the court of public opinion so assertively
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:22.400]  and so aggressively that the court of public opinion is more self educated and more self
[2:04:22.400 --> 2:04:29.240]  informed than it's been at any time in American history since the revolutionary era itself.
[2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:31.040]  What are we going to hit when we come back there so much to hit?
[2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:34.120]  Oh, I think it's a wide range of it. I think there should be more fight backs on this January
[2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:37.680]  6th committee. I think more lawyers should look at not only contesting it on Fifth Amendment
[2:04:37.680 --> 2:04:42.160]  grounds, not only contesting it on his executive or presidential privilege grounds, but look
[2:04:42.160 --> 2:04:45.720]  at challenging the committee itself, look at challenging whether the committee even
[2:04:45.720 --> 2:04:50.280]  has constitutional authority to issue subpoenas, fight back everywhere, every place. And if
[2:04:50.280 --> 2:04:54.520]  it's acting as a court, what about the Seventh Amendment? We'll be right back.

[2:06:22.200 --> 2:06:29.200]  This summer, I created a paid for pro video account on Vimeo, exclusively for ReeseReport.com.
[2:06:36.120 --> 2:06:42.080]  On October 23rd of this year, they deleted my video, Pfizer adds dangerous drug to children's
[2:06:42.080 --> 2:06:48.920]  COVID vaccines, even though they did, and I merely showed their own documents. Six days
[2:06:48.920 --> 2:06:55.640]  later, they deleted major government report proves COVID vaccines are bio weapons, even
[2:06:55.640 --> 2:07:00.880]  though it's an actual government report. I then received notice that my account is under
[2:07:00.880 --> 2:07:07.880]  review. I replied by telling them the two videos are not false, and I show all the documents.
[2:07:08.040 --> 2:07:14.320]  They replied by informing me that they explicitly follow the recommendations of the CDC and
[2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:20.760]  the World Health Organization. I suppose taking down our PayPal and URLs are next, but for
[2:07:20.760 --> 2:07:27.760]  now you can still support my work at ReeseReport.com and InfoWars at SaveInfoWars.com.
[2:07:27.760 --> 2:07:46.840]  Still reporting for InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese. So, I asked Reese at the beginning
[2:07:46.840 --> 2:07:52.160]  of the show when I learned that he got his account deleted because he put out an important
[2:07:52.160 --> 2:07:57.680]  piece exposing that this Omnichron is not as deadly as they say, and it's total hype.
[2:07:57.680 --> 2:08:03.120]  They said in the email to him, your video is deleted, we may delete your account because
[2:08:03.120 --> 2:08:09.360]  the WHO says, there it is right there, you violate the Centers for Disease Control and
[2:08:09.360 --> 2:08:16.360]  WHO. Look at that on screen right there. So, the news isn't that InfoWars got censored.
[2:08:16.920 --> 2:08:21.080]  The news isn't that Greg Reese got censored. We always think about ourselves, like how
[2:08:21.080 --> 2:08:27.600]  did this affect me? Well, I just got censored. No, they just said the you in is in charge
[2:08:27.600 --> 2:08:32.520]  and the American Heart Association cannot come out and say, remember folks, there is
[2:08:32.520 --> 2:08:37.880]  an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke and myocarditis as is in the insert, so be
[2:08:37.880 --> 2:08:43.440]  sure you know, they work for the system. They're like, hey, we're giving you the public posting
[2:08:43.440 --> 2:08:46.560]  that you better look out even though they know you're not going to read it. And the
[2:08:46.560 --> 2:08:50.600]  system's like, we're going to censor you when they're part of the system. I mean, this
[2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:55.680]  is the system eating itself. Well, especially given that you're legally obligated, both
[2:08:55.680 --> 2:09:00.280]  the sponsor and the advertiser under the law to disclose all the risk factors and to disclose
[2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:03.440]  and you're supposed to highlight the risks. In fact, you're supposed to do a fair and
[2:09:03.440 --> 2:09:08.320]  balanced reporting. So does Twitter make itself a party now to these suits by censoring the
[2:09:08.320 --> 2:09:12.200]  American Heart Association? Potentially. What jury wouldn't find them liable of censoring
[2:09:12.200 --> 2:09:16.440]  the American Heart Association? Potentially, yes. In fact, I mean, all of this is unprecedented
[2:09:16.440 --> 2:09:19.800]  and uncharted territory because they've never done anything like this before. They've never,
[2:09:19.800 --> 2:09:23.880]  you haven't had a situation where they actually have targeted children for advertising that
[2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:27.480]  that basically is prohibited most places around the world. Even covert advertising that had
[2:09:27.480 --> 2:09:32.440]  to pay billions. Remember Joe Camel? Yeah, exactly. I mean, I mean, the whole goal was
[2:09:32.440 --> 2:09:36.720]  that those things not happen to people, particularly really young, you know, three, four, five,
[2:09:36.720 --> 2:09:40.760]  six year old. And that's what Sesame Street's absolutely. That's three year olds. You're
[2:09:40.760 --> 2:09:44.640]  targeting three year olds to get accustomed to the idea. The government comes and knocks
[2:09:44.640 --> 2:09:48.640]  on their door and put something in them. Whether their parent is there or not, because that's
[2:09:48.640 --> 2:09:53.440]  part of the reason why this is the very definition of authoritarian and only that it is by everybody's
[2:09:53.440 --> 2:09:58.000]  admission. If they're honest towards children, they would recognize that COVID is less risky
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:03.720]  than the ordinary flu to people under the age of 12 and that the vaccine poses its greatest
[2:10:03.720 --> 2:10:08.720]  risk because it's a gene therapy, not really a vaccine poses its greatest risk to people
[2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:12.440]  of that age group because it's long tail risk. You have the short tail risk, which we're
[2:10:12.440 --> 2:10:16.600]  all witnessing, but the greatest risk of a gene therapy is its long tail risk because
[2:10:16.600 --> 2:10:21.880]  we have no idea what it, what it can do is generally cancer and, and, and, and, uh, liver
[2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:27.600]  failure. Exactly. So how big is this then? I mean, what is the tail? I agree. We've already
[2:10:27.600 --> 2:10:32.880]  seen up front. This is really bad. What's the tail look like? Because at some level,
[2:10:32.880 --> 2:10:37.120]  we don't know of what will the vaccine itself require a bunch of therapeutic treatment and
[2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:41.120]  other medical invasive treatment. Yeah, they got a backstory built in. Exactly. I mean,
[2:10:41.120 --> 2:10:44.280]  most likely that's going to be the impact. And because the greatest, well, we know,
[2:10:44.280 --> 2:10:48.200]  oh, sorry, you don't have an immune system anymore. We've got to give you immune therapies
[2:10:48.200 --> 2:10:51.680]  constantly. Yes. And there's more and more evidence coming out about the risk of what
[2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:57.480]  this spike does. And any of this mRNA drugs have mostly failed throughout history. This
[2:10:57.480 --> 2:11:02.760]  is now we're doing it on a massive scale that we have never tried any drug in history. No,
[2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:08.640]  no drug has been instituted at this level across this global size population on an
[2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:15.680]  experimental unapproved basis because no biologic licensed drug is, is available as a COVID-19
[2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:19.000]  vaccine in the United States. That's still clear. Even though they're playing the bait
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:22.760]  and switch game where the FDA says, well, you know, yeah, we did a bait and switch,
[2:11:22.760 --> 2:11:27.040]  but it's up to the, to the government or the mandating agency, whether it's actually mandated
[2:11:27.040 --> 2:11:31.320]  or not. And then the defense department says, well, oh, we're only mandating it because
[2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:35.680]  the FDA said it's really the biologically. But even Reuters last week's like, what in
[2:11:35.680 --> 2:11:40.440]  the world? That was even the headline. Why are you not going to let us see the Pfizer
[2:11:40.440 --> 2:11:45.320]  Documents? We get them mass death. Exactly. Because they have just assumed that the various
[2:11:45.320 --> 2:11:50.560]  lies and deceptions and misrepresentation that were exposed by my whistleblower somehow
[2:11:50.560 --> 2:11:54.480]  that the whistleblower can't really be accurate or it was just a one off or it was just that
[2:11:54.480 --> 2:12:01.320]  one place, what she exposed was systemic systematic problems at the very core to the structure.
[2:12:01.320 --> 2:12:05.520]  And that even says that in the CDC documents and FDA documents, which you said months ago
[2:12:05.520 --> 2:12:11.120]  but now it's out confirming what you said, they, they filtered most of the stuff out.
[2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:15.040]  So that's what, that's what your whistleblower saying. Right. Exactly. I mean, what she identified
[2:12:15.040 --> 2:12:21.080]  is that these risks were systemic risks and that these problems were systematic problems,
[2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:25.880]  structural problems in the way they were doing this various COVID vaccine testing. So scary,
[2:12:25.880 --> 2:12:30.840]  so frightening, so terrifying that she came forward after nearly 20 years in this industry,
[2:12:30.840 --> 2:12:35.000]  knowing it would ruin her career, knowing you have no chance the moment you go public
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:39.280]  and expose malfeasance and misconduct and big pharma. You have no future in big pharma.
[2:12:39.280 --> 2:12:43.440]  You have to take special security measurements when you go public about them. And yet she
[2:12:43.440 --> 2:12:48.360]  did so anyway. Why? Because it was so egregious, so severe, so substantial and she knew it
[2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:53.760]  was across the entire clinical testing structure. And that's what the high ranking people admitted.
[2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:57.680]  They said we can't do anything about this because we would have to shut them all down
[2:12:57.680 --> 2:13:02.560]  if we actually honored basic scientific safety measures. So it's system wide corruption.
[2:13:02.560 --> 2:13:06.880]  Absolutely. That means if you can't trust it and if the FDA's response to seeing that
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:12.080]  evidence was to cover it up rather than expose it, then why how can we have confidence in
[2:13:12.080 --> 2:13:17.480]  any clinical test concerning anything related to this vaccine? We can't. And why do they
[2:13:17.480 --> 2:13:22.720]  need 55 years to disclose documents that they said they fully reviewed? They said that they
[2:13:22.720 --> 2:13:27.800]  went through in detail, that they substantiated it, that these clinical trials met high levels
[2:13:27.800 --> 2:13:33.200]  of standards of efficacy and safety, that they could say with authority that this drug,
[2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:37.080]  this Pfizer drug, was so safe they could actually give it a biologic license even though it's
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:41.000]  not being produced yet. Well, if they could do that and they did that within a couple
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:45.200]  of weeks, why is it taking them 55 years to even disclose what it is they looked at?
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:49.960]  I mean, that exposes that they themselves know that if anybody else looks at the underlying
[2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:54.040]  data, looks at the underlying information, they're going to come to the conclusion that
[2:13:54.040 --> 2:14:00.080]  this drug, this gene therapy, does not meet the standard of safety and efficacy they would
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:04.080]  want for their loved one or their child. And that's why they want to keep it hushed up.
[2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:10.600]  And then we've got the backdrop of the same globalist corporate UN combine of systems.
[2:14:10.600 --> 2:14:13.520]  Everything we've seen in Australia is now coming here. Everything we see in Germany
[2:14:13.520 --> 2:14:18.960]  coming here, Germany saying martial law, unvaccinated lockdown, forced injection start
[2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:24.120]  February 1st. I mean, this is biblical level stuff, Robert. I mean, you know, it's not
[2:14:24.120 --> 2:14:27.120]  a surprise that it's Germany. I mean, they want to put people in camps again. So the
[2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:30.520]  I mean, it the hell's up with that. I mean, I'm part German, but what's wrong with the
[2:14:30.520 --> 2:14:34.200]  German government? They just can't help themselves. You know, it's it's like the Dr. Strangelove
[2:14:34.200 --> 2:14:38.960]  character, you know, just trying to keep that right. Exactly. Try to keep that arm down.
[2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:42.600]  But the the they're so instinctive for it. I think it's the ultimate power grab. They've
[2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:46.960]  been wanting it for a long time. The election of Trump and the in Brexit was a scare factor
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:50.520]  that let them think that they might never be able to assert it. So they're rushing to
[2:14:50.520 --> 2:14:56.360]  assert it, even on the least plausible evidentiary grounds, the least justifiable legal grounds
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:15:01.280]  and the least credible moral grounds. And so what they did not expect, though, is that
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:05.080]  there would be such pushback in the court of public opinion that they're at major risk
[2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:09.400]  in the courts of law now, because of the blowback in the court of public opinion. That's what's
[2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:12.680]  letting judges take a look at the actual evidence. So when you look at the actual evidence, it
[2:15:12.680 --> 2:15:16.240]  doesn't support it. There's same reason they have to hide the look at this footage of Germany
[2:15:16.240 --> 2:15:19.600]  and beating the hell out of people who go outside at night. I mean, they're chasing
[2:15:19.600 --> 2:15:23.600]  people down. Australia, they're chasing people down for leaving the little camps. I mean,
[2:15:23.600 --> 2:15:27.400]  it's like I never got to that yesterday. I've got a bunch of articles where the leftist
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:31.720]  media says there aren't camps in Australia when they see people waking up. Oh, it's trending.
[2:15:31.720 --> 2:15:36.360]  Oh, it's not happening, Americans. Well, Claire Lehman, you know, of Quillette, who's supposed
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:40.440]  to be on the right, has been coming up with 100 excuses why the camps aren't really camps.
[2:15:40.440 --> 2:15:44.040]  And if they're scary, but they're not too scary. I mean, it's a reality. What we said
[2:15:44.040 --> 2:15:47.640]  a year ago was going to happen is happening. And the only thing that stops it is ordinary
[2:15:47.640 --> 2:15:51.480]  people fighting. And then a bunch of bikini babes are Stockholm syndromeing out and working
[2:15:51.480 --> 2:15:54.600]  with the camp guards. So now they're allowed to be free.
[2:15:54.600 --> 2:16:01.280]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome. Hello,
[2:16:01.280 --> 2:16:05.160]  Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other
[2:16:05.160 --> 2:16:10.240]  patriots can get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-host
[2:16:10.240 --> 2:16:15.680]  Owen Shroyer, SuperMail Vitality and Brain Force Plus. Mix those two together. You're
[2:16:15.680 --> 2:16:20.960]  an unstoppable tank. SuperMail Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and
[2:16:20.960 --> 2:16:26.880]  natural compounds that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared
[2:16:26.880 --> 2:16:31.000]  to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:36.240]  a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's
[2:16:36.240 --> 2:16:39.600]  just okay. People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch
[2:16:39.600 --> 2:16:44.720]  isn't as strong? That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just
[2:16:44.720 --> 2:16:49.760]  sometimes it's like super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price,
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:17:01.280]  then this is it. If you're ruthless mega corporations who've taken over almost every
[2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:05.840]  government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class in any form of upper
[2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:09.760]  mobility, you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being
[2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:16.400]  targeted. And that's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves, the name of LBGT and African
[2:17:16.400 --> 2:17:20.560]  American rights, all the rest of it, all over the world. That's now their corporate face
[2:17:20.560 --> 2:17:25.440]  while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist China and many other areas, while
[2:17:25.440 --> 2:17:30.080]  they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through the big tech and the central
[2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:36.640]  banks in other zone. So this is a criminal takeover. And when you look at the new superclass,
[2:17:36.640 --> 2:17:41.600]  it's the politicians, it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats,
[2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:45.600]  it's members of Congress and their staff and their families, it's the White House. Hell,
[2:17:45.600 --> 2:17:52.000]  it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots, but not the general public
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:56.240]  and everybody else through corporate rule. So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[2:17:56.240 --> 2:18:03.120]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[2:18:26.240 --> 2:18:35.120]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:05.920]  Cover commander here with an important message to humanity. I have decided that all of you
[2:19:05.920 --> 2:19:13.680]  will take a special injection so that you will be safe, but the injection is not ready yet.
[2:19:14.320 --> 2:19:22.960]  And so I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the can.
[2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:30.960]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:39.440]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only
[2:19:39.440 --> 2:19:48.240]  I own profitable. You will then be my slaves. Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of
[2:19:48.240 --> 2:19:53.840]  freedom from corporate will remove your immune system. So you'll be dependent on me for the
[2:19:53.840 --> 2:20:19.440]  rest of your miserable lives. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:23.840 --> 2:20:36.320]  Wanna go to a land that's far away? How are we supposed to get there with the way they
[2:20:36.320 --> 2:20:50.880]  will live in today? You talk lots about God freedom comes from the car, but that's not what this
[2:20:50.880 --> 2:21:00.320]  bitch wants. Not what I want at all. I want all over the world. Millions and millions of people
[2:21:00.320 --> 2:21:08.240]  are protesting against the UN corporate world government takeover. And I know Rand Paul's
[2:21:08.240 --> 2:21:13.120]  had his ribs broken and been shot at with police. But if he would just stand up and expose us to
[2:21:13.120 --> 2:21:18.320]  say he was misled and if Trump would just do it, everybody would line up behind them right now to
[2:21:18.320 --> 2:21:23.840]  stop this globalist takeover. And this globalist attempt to take over civilization using fear
[2:21:23.840 --> 2:21:29.360]  would be turned against them and a new golden age would begin. But I guess humans have to
[2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:35.520]  go through hell first, don't they? Robert Barnes, look, I don't blame Trump. I don't blame
[2:21:35.520 --> 2:21:39.840]  Senator Paul, but I know Paul as a doctor advised him. Yeah, go with the vaccine. Let's get things
[2:21:39.840 --> 2:21:44.480]  open. They couldn't imagine the big farmer would actually put a fraud out and actually create an
[2:21:44.480 --> 2:21:50.880]  ongoing crisis. Now, many Republicans get that. Many, many patriots get that. But how do we get
[2:21:50.880 --> 2:21:56.400]  Trump? How do we get Senator Paul and Cruz and others to really get on the offense and say we
[2:21:56.400 --> 2:22:01.680]  were misled? This vaccine isn't a vaccine. It hurts people. That's how we defeat the globalist,
[2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:06.960]  plus it would make them fabulously popular. Well, if you look at just what federal judges
[2:22:06.960 --> 2:22:11.040]  themselves are saying, I mean, these are very conservative establishment oriented people.
[2:22:11.040 --> 2:22:14.320]  And the federal judge after federal judge, the Fifth Circuit said it, the federal court in
[2:22:14.320 --> 2:22:18.320]  Louisiana said it, federal court in Missouri said it, federal courts have also said it in
[2:22:18.320 --> 2:22:22.320]  other contexts. But they've just said within the last week that you look at the evidence,
[2:22:22.320 --> 2:22:26.880]  this vaccine does not stop transmission of the virus. That is now part of official court proceedings.
[2:22:26.880 --> 2:22:33.360]  That's not any kind of just claim being made. That is a admission being made by the CDC and
[2:22:33.360 --> 2:22:38.240]  admission being made by the Biden administration and admission being made by the OSHA administration.
[2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:42.800]  All of the government actors themselves acknowledging and admitting in actual judicial
[2:22:42.800 --> 2:22:48.320]  proceedings that in fact, this vaccine does not work as a vaccine. It doesn't inoculate.
[2:22:48.320 --> 2:22:52.800]  It doesn't prevent transmission. It doesn't in fact, apparently even reduce transmission.
[2:22:52.800 --> 2:22:57.760]  It's a fraudulent product that was forced on us. We should be on the offense calling for their
[2:22:57.760 --> 2:23:02.000]  political ads. It's the old version of confession through projection, which is you go back and
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:07.440]  look at early February of last year in 2020. And you look at what was being said by the government
[2:23:07.440 --> 2:23:12.640]  in March of 2020 and in April 2020. Whenever anybody suggested that something might help
[2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:18.400]  against any kind of coronavirus, whether that was vitamin C, vitamin D, getting sun, being healthy,
[2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:24.000]  whatever it was, there was all of a sudden government attacks. And there was PR attacks and
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:27.760]  press attacks to such a degree that, you know, Saturday Night Live still has to pretend that
[2:23:27.760 --> 2:23:34.160]  Joe Rogan took a horse dewormer, not a drug that has was a Nobel Peace Prize award winning drug
[2:23:34.160 --> 2:23:38.640]  for its safety and efficacy for human beings. So it's the same dynamic. They kept saying all
[2:23:38.640 --> 2:23:42.640]  these things didn't work. All these things were fraudulent. When all these things did work,
[2:23:42.640 --> 2:23:46.560]  all these things did help. What they were doing is they were projecting what they themselves were
[2:23:46.560 --> 2:23:50.400]  going to do, which is put out a medical product that doesn't work, where to put out a medical
[2:23:50.400 --> 2:23:54.320]  product that doesn't have safety or efficacy and a medical product that doesn't serve the
[2:23:54.320 --> 2:23:59.360]  purpose as it claims to be served. But is it that like, I remember when I was a kid, they'd have
[2:23:59.360 --> 2:24:05.680]  investigated reports on 60 minutes about Sears Auto Parts Store or whatever it was, where the
[2:24:05.680 --> 2:24:09.840]  woman goes to get her tires fixed or a carburetor, and they would break it and not fix it and break
[2:24:09.840 --> 2:24:15.040]  more things. Hidden cameras catch this. It's the same thing where they just catch you in this
[2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:18.960]  deal and never let you out of it. Well, it's an old scheme. I mean, the old theory was that, you
[2:24:18.960 --> 2:24:23.360]  know, why do we have wars? Well, or why do we have enemies? We need enemies in order to justify
[2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:27.360]  wars. Why do you have crime? Why do you create a criminal justice system that creates a permanent
[2:24:27.360 --> 2:24:32.000]  permanent criminal class? As Foucault and others pointed out, that's how you create the justification
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:37.440]  for police. Well, how do you create a police state, permanent police state? You create a constant
[2:24:37.440 --> 2:24:42.160]  continuous health emergency and constant continuous health crisis. And once you have the police
[2:24:42.160 --> 2:24:46.000]  state in place, it's not the police themselves of the police state, it's the police state. The
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:50.400]  police are good overall. You can turn the police off to make everybody beg for it, then you get
[2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:54.240]  even a bigger police state that you control. Well, then they're also purging the dissident
[2:24:54.240 --> 2:24:58.400]  members of the police and purging the dissident members of the military. I mean, look at this
[2:24:58.400 --> 2:25:02.160]  was like panning for gold. They're getting rid of the good people. In this case, you throw the
[2:25:02.160 --> 2:25:06.480]  gold away and keep the crap. Absolutely. I mean, one of the suits that I'm suing Tyson Foods,
[2:25:06.480 --> 2:25:10.400]  we filed an amended complaint because Tyson admitted that they're doing all of this in the
[2:25:10.400 --> 2:25:14.320]  name as a federal agent, as an officer of the federal government. So my allegation is that
[2:25:14.320 --> 2:25:18.640]  means they're liable under the federal laws and liable under the US Constitution. And clearly,
[2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:22.720]  part of what they're doing is if you wanted to punish your political dissidents, what better
[2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:26.320]  way than to impose a vaccine mandate and fire anyone who doesn't go along? You're basically
[2:25:26.320 --> 2:25:30.560]  getting to fire all the neos. You're asking all of the people that are willing to take a red pill
[2:25:30.560 --> 2:25:34.320]  to raise their hands and you can purge them from the government, purge them even from high level
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:38.880]  private employment. Exactly. It's all a plan. And then society further collapses because you
[2:25:38.880 --> 2:25:42.880]  fired most of the good workers. I look at the footage out of Austria and Germany of the checkpoints,
[2:25:42.880 --> 2:25:48.240]  the martial law and barbed wire. And it just doesn't seem real. I mean, it's insane. I mean,
[2:25:48.240 --> 2:25:52.960]  literal detention camps that they're going to protect you from a virus exactly that they created
[2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:56.880]  we want that that cannot be controlled in the way they're trying to control. I mean, it's
[2:25:56.880 --> 2:26:01.920]  extraordinary. All the studies are out that the lockdowns and the PC, all of it does nothing
[2:26:02.560 --> 2:26:06.960]  except control us. Every time they've had to go to court on any of these things, whether it's
[2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:10.800]  masks, I mean, they all wear these clown outfits. Like if I dress up like the devil,
[2:26:10.800 --> 2:26:14.720]  can I hop around to be the devil? No, must be wearing red pajamas. They wear these little
[2:26:14.720 --> 2:26:20.960]  medical clown outfits, then they can engage in these behaviors. This is all a Milgram experiment.
[2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:25.120]  Absolutely. I mean, when you see those kids inside like plastic bubbles trying to do their,
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:28.720]  you know, part of a choir or a band and they're inside this live plastic bubble,
[2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:32.640]  I mean, it's insanity. I mean, it's like it's like one of those South Park movie episodes
[2:26:32.640 --> 2:26:36.480]  where they did that movie where they had both people like, Oh, it was a naked gun. Maybe it was
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:41.760]  one of the naked guns where they're all in like a live condom as the entire covers the whole body.
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:45.440]  I mean, it's saying you have people out there walking around like that. I mean, like this when
[2:26:45.440 --> 2:26:51.120]  all the evidence is us being together makes us have better immunity. Absolutely. And in general,
[2:26:51.120 --> 2:26:56.480]  our humanity is the best of humanity. And yet it's taught people to not interact, not interface,
[2:26:56.480 --> 2:27:03.360]  not be around family. I like all over Austin. And still, it'll be 7am, middle of nowhere,
[2:27:03.360 --> 2:27:07.040]  and I'm going down some 20 foot wide path and a man or woman will like get up against the bushes
[2:27:07.040 --> 2:27:12.720]  like this because they're so scared completely. I mean, they've could they've diluted the mind
[2:27:12.720 --> 2:27:17.360]  to such a degree of insanity and paranoia that people are willing to take experimental drug
[2:27:17.360 --> 2:27:21.360]  after drug after drug injected into their body that could change their body structure forever
[2:27:21.920 --> 2:27:25.520]  because they're so terrified willing to wear double and triple and quadruple mass
[2:27:25.520 --> 2:27:30.480]  while running outdoors. I mean, this is this is the social contract being broken. Absolutely.
[2:27:30.480 --> 2:27:34.160]  How do we reconnect the social contract when come back? I'm going to show you the Australian
[2:27:34.160 --> 2:27:37.040]  FEMA camps, folks. We haven't gotten to this yet. It's all breaking.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:43.680]  We're going to break it if you must I'm saying sorry. I mean, how far do you think they can
[2:27:43.680 --> 2:27:46.240]  push this? Oh, I mean, they're going to keep going until people push back. I mean, they're
[2:27:46.240 --> 2:27:49.680]  going to see how much people push back. I mean, the only thing that has stopped us or restrained
[2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:54.560]  this at all is public pushback. We would look like Australia and Canada and Germany exactly
[2:27:54.560 --> 2:27:58.720]  everywhere where people give in, you see the same program. Absolutely. And it's only where people
[2:27:58.720 --> 2:28:02.320]  push back. People push back in Russia. Russia decides they're not going to do a vaccine mandate.
[2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:05.840]  People push back in large parts of Eastern Europe, whether it's immigration or whether it's
[2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:09.840]  vaccines or whether it's COVID policy or whether it's lockdowns and they don't see those policies.
[2:28:09.840 --> 2:28:14.240]  Pushback is freedom. Pushback is life. He would think Russia is not part of the New World Order.
[2:28:14.240 --> 2:28:17.600]  They claim they're not, but they went along a lot of it. They did. I mean, what it shows
[2:28:17.600 --> 2:28:21.600]  was Bill Gates understood if he could co-op the public health authorities that he could
[2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:25.760]  run public health policy without having any control. That's how you run a real coup. Absolutely.
[2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:29.200]  You got to put your own politician in the trim of the CIA. The Russians will arrest him.
[2:28:29.200 --> 2:28:34.000]  But if it's the medical system, well, you just do what Hoover did and you just do it to every
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:37.600]  public health authority from the local level to the international level. And that's how Gates was
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:42.640]  able to co-opt it and dictate. And it also entices countries. Oh, use this tyranny. We're not going
[2:28:42.640 --> 2:28:47.680]  to attack you. It's not like he hit it. I mean, he did an entire the whole COVID Panopticon conference
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:52.400]  that he did just a few months before it was officially released. Event 201. Exactly. I mean,
[2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:57.200]  he showed the world. He'll be back. Stay with us. If you're concerned about the power.

[2:29:44.080 --> 2:29:49.200]  of our collective liberties together. If you shop at the big box stores, you deserve to be a slave.
[2:29:49.200 --> 2:29:53.520]  If you shop at Info Wars, you're part of the team fighting for liberty. God bless and thanks for
[2:29:53.520 --> 2:30:02.880]  your support. The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of
[2:30:02.880 --> 2:30:08.400]  the change that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations
[2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:16.000]  has put in place. It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge. It is
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:21.680]  the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from
[2:30:21.680 --> 2:30:30.800]  the light of the sun. It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[2:30:31.520 --> 2:30:38.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now. The entire future destiny of humanity is
[2:30:38.400 --> 2:30:43.120]  upon us. Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part
[2:30:43.120 --> 2:30:48.960]  of the world ID and carbon taxes. Things only get worse from here if we submit. They only get better
[2:30:48.960 --> 2:30:56.000]  if we resist and say no. Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance. The purpose of fear is to call
[2:30:56.000 --> 2:31:01.920]  us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today. Half the population has lined up for an
[2:31:01.920 --> 2:31:07.120]  untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid
[2:31:07.120 --> 2:31:12.320]  of an invisible asymptomatic disease. The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their
[2:31:12.320 --> 2:31:18.320]  goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less
[2:31:18.320 --> 2:31:23.840]  than nine years. For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening
[2:31:23.840 --> 2:31:29.600]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see. But there is only two things to do. We continue
[2:31:29.600 --> 2:31:34.400]  sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game. If enough people awaken from the cold spell,
[2:31:34.400 --> 2:31:39.600]  then we win. But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are
[2:31:39.600 --> 2:31:45.120]  soon coming to an end. And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[2:31:45.120 --> 2:31:53.440]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[2:31:54.320 --> 2:32:01.520]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class. Not in
[2:32:01.520 --> 2:32:08.400]  communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere. Is there a real study
[2:32:09.040 --> 2:32:14.000]  of the planet's ruling class? And that's done by design. The large central banks that basically
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:20.400]  control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into, say, the Anglo-American
[2:32:20.400 --> 2:32:24.080]  establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg Group, the trilateral commission of the United
[2:32:24.080 --> 2:32:29.120]  Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers. Until ten years ago,
[2:32:29.120 --> 2:32:34.160]  the media said the control corporate media of the Bilderberg Group didn't exist. Well,
[2:32:34.160 --> 2:32:38.720]  now the Bilderberg Group is public in its former head, still in the steering committee,
[2:32:38.720 --> 2:32:44.560]  is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the Great Reset in global government. And if, as a liberty
[2:32:44.560 --> 2:32:48.400]  movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head-on, about the second thing
[2:32:48.400 --> 2:32:52.640]  or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot. We do expose them,
[2:32:52.640 --> 2:32:54.720]  we can beat them easily. And thanks for your support.
[2:32:59.840 --> 2:33:05.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:05.840 --> 2:33:26.160]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:32.400]  And we are back. We just got word Alex Jones was right with hundreds of thousands of followers
[2:33:32.400 --> 2:33:38.800]  on Twitter. I didn't run it. Don't know who runs it. Suspended, but suspended means deleted forever
[2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:46.240]  in the Orwellian double thing. More on that coming up. Robert Barnes has a lot of inside
[2:33:46.240 --> 2:33:52.640]  baseball. He's so often, almost always right. He says the Supreme Court is said to reverse
[2:33:52.640 --> 2:33:57.280]  Roe v. Wade. We'll cover that next segment. So tell your friends and family and others tune
[2:33:57.280 --> 2:34:04.720]  in now, but let's talk about Australia, the beta test for the world. Fifth person this week escapes
[2:34:04.720 --> 2:34:11.040]  Australian COVID quarantine camp. Six months ago, I was covering these camps in Australia,
[2:34:11.040 --> 2:34:14.880]  which is the model for the world under the UN directive. People said, oh, it can't be happening.
[2:34:14.880 --> 2:34:20.640]  And then new videos came out of people in the camps and newspapers here said they weren't real,
[2:34:20.640 --> 2:34:25.120]  later confirmed to be real, because you're not supposed to know what's coming for you next.
[2:34:25.120 --> 2:34:30.640]  Let's go ahead and play a clip here from local news nine in Australia a few days ago,
[2:34:30.640 --> 2:34:35.200]  when a few teenagers escaped the camp. Here it is. Good morning. We started breaking news
[2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:40.400]  at a Darwin where three people have escaped from the Howard Springs COVID quarantine facility.
[2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:44.400]  Talia Saab is there for us. Talia, good morning. There's a search underway right now.
[2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:52.240]  Yes, that's right. Davina. Good morning to you. We've been told the trio scaled defense
[2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:57.680]  in the early hours of this morning. Police receiving reports around 4.40am. Now,
[2:34:57.680 --> 2:35:02.400]  major police checkpoints have been set up around Howard Springs for the past several hours. As you
[2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:07.280]  can see in these pictures, they've been conducting thorough searches in car boots, checking vehicle
[2:35:07.280 --> 2:35:13.440]  registrations, cars and buses alike. But in the last half an hour, what we understand is they've
[2:35:13.440 --> 2:35:19.840]  actually been dismantled exactly why that hasn't been confirmed. Hopefully good news. We're also
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:24.480]  not sure yet who these people are connected with, whether it's a repatriation flight, all those
[2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:29.520]  Aboriginal community members who have been staying here following the Catherine cluster.
[2:35:29.520 --> 2:35:34.800]  Davina, what we do know is that this is definitely going to bring this gold standard facility under
[2:35:34.800 --> 2:35:41.200]  intense scrutiny. On Sunday, we had a man escape and found on Darwin's party precinct and this
[2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:46.080]  latest situation is only going to put us under the microscope further. Not good news. Okay, Talias,
[2:35:46.080 --> 2:35:52.560]  thank you. Under the microscope without submitting, we had camp escapees. Oh my god, it's so horrible.
[2:35:52.560 --> 2:35:57.120]  Barnes. First, that refers to site. You know, they don't want to use the word camp. They don't
[2:35:57.120 --> 2:36:01.360]  want to use detention center because they know what all that means. So instead, they fled a site.
[2:36:01.360 --> 2:36:05.440]  I mean, how do you flee a site? They didn't flee the camp. They didn't know it's a site. Yeah,
[2:36:05.440 --> 2:36:08.880]  it's just a site. It's like, how do you flee a site? That site is just a location. I mean,
[2:36:08.880 --> 2:36:13.360]  you can't flee a location. They're like, oh, god, we're under scrutiny now. Here's another clip.
[2:36:13.360 --> 2:36:20.160]  Here is the young woman, Australian Haley Hodgkin. And the media tried to say this didn't
[2:36:20.160 --> 2:36:26.880]  happen. They now confirm it's real. This is inside the camps. So what's, what's the go? So this,
[2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:30.320]  I'm going to give you a warning. Yeah. It's an official warning that you have to stand about
[2:36:30.320 --> 2:36:35.200]  and obey the rules or you get, yeah. And that's, we have to go the rules again. I don't care.
[2:36:35.200 --> 2:36:38.160]  So I'm not allowed to go to the laundry? You're allowed to go the laundry, but you've got to wear
[2:36:38.160 --> 2:36:41.760]  a mask, yeah? Yeah, righto. And you definitely can't go to the painting route, but you're allowed
[2:36:41.760 --> 2:36:46.000]  to go to the laundry, yeah? That's always been the case, yeah? Right. So if I was sitting just
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:52.640]  here, which is right near the fence, why are these guys in a cabin that's right near the fence?
[2:36:53.680 --> 2:36:58.320]  It makes no sense, does it? Yeah, but you can't leave your balcony to go to the fence to talk to
[2:36:58.320 --> 2:37:02.000]  somebody else. That's just obvious, yeah? So far we've got that balcony. So there's,
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:06.720]  we always have, there has to be lines everywhere drawn, yeah? And one of the lines is you cannot
[2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:10.320]  leave your balcony and you cannot go to someone else where it makes no sense or it doesn't seem
[2:37:10.320 --> 2:37:13.680]  right to you. That is the line and that's what the law is, yeah? And that's how I go, yeah?
[2:37:13.680 --> 2:37:17.280]  The law. What, the show direction? There's a law. There's a show direction, yep. There's a show
[2:37:17.280 --> 2:37:21.680]  direction, yeah? And look, he's in his clown outfit, his little priest outfit. Oh, look, I'm wearing
[2:37:21.680 --> 2:37:26.240]  a plastic suit. And largely to have infected people, yeah? Highly infectious. Highly infectious when
[2:37:26.240 --> 2:37:32.880]  all of us... When Fauci made it to my lab. So far, the risk is still very high, yeah? Yeah.
[2:37:32.880 --> 2:37:36.400]  While you're here, can we just do that? Otherwise, the next time it's a $5,000 fine. We don't want to
[2:37:36.400 --> 2:37:43.200]  do that. It's a $5,000 fine if what? If, if you breach again. If, if I walk out onto that path.
[2:37:43.200 --> 2:37:47.360]  Without your mask on, if I cross that yellow line. Without your mask on, your symbol of
[2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:54.160]  slavery. This is all Stockholm's syndrome, all Milgram experiment folks. Look up the Milgram
[2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:58.720]  experiment. We could, we could even do that now, but we're giving the warning first. Have a chat with
[2:37:58.720 --> 2:38:06.080]  you, because it's a big fine. We're all just doing the right thing, yeah? Rural followers. Yeah. I don't
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:09.920]  want to fuck with you. I just want you to do the right thing and... Yeah. Well, should you take all
[2:38:09.920 --> 2:38:14.880]  your shots, have cancers, I? The ins and outs. I've got nothing to do with me. I'm just... Nothing
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:21.280]  to do with me. I'm just enforcing it. So what did that experience make you think? Like, what...
[2:38:21.280 --> 2:38:26.720]  Here's the moment. What was your feeling about being in that situation with those people in
[2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:32.640]  control of your every movement? Oh, it's horrible. It's a horrible feeling. You feel
[2:38:33.200 --> 2:38:38.000]  like you're in prison. You feel like you've done something wrong. It's inhumane what they're doing.
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:43.920]  Like, you, you are so small. You, they just overpower you and you're literally nothing.
[2:38:44.880 --> 2:38:52.160]  So, Robert, this is the end of freedom. This is domestication. This is North Korea 5.0, 10.0.
[2:38:52.160 --> 2:38:55.840]  This is... I mean, this is it. This is the, this is the takeover. Well, I mean, actually,
[2:38:55.840 --> 2:38:59.200]  that was mentioned in the abortion cases of the U.S. Supreme Court that the only
[2:38:59.200 --> 2:39:03.760]  countries that have our laws are North Korea and China on abortion. So, I mean, what she said there,
[2:39:03.760 --> 2:39:08.720]  I think, was the most revelatory, which was they make you so small. And that's their goal,
[2:39:08.720 --> 2:39:14.480]  was to make everybody feel impotent, incapable of making any different, to feel small, to feel
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:19.360]  tiny, to feel irrelevant, to feel they could be crushed at any moment. And that's why it's all
[2:39:19.360 --> 2:39:24.480]  the small people standing up together that has led to any pushback against this. And it's the only
[2:39:24.480 --> 2:39:28.400]  thing that has stopped them from doing this on a broader scale. And tyrants always have the same
[2:39:28.400 --> 2:39:33.760]  song. It's not me. Just do it, please. I'm here, but he's hurting you. He's enslaved. He's like,
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:38.400]  please just do it. Come on, baby. Come on. He even admits he says the directive, the law. And he
[2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:43.200]  puts it in air quotes, in air quotes. He's like, ah, you know, that's whatever the law is today,
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:47.680]  which might change tomorrow by somebody's whim. I mean, that's what makes it all a joke. And never,
[2:39:47.680 --> 2:39:52.400]  oh, they cooked it up. Oh, they released it. Oh, the vaccine hurts me. Never a discussion. Hey,
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:39:56.880]  hey, hey, honey, law, it's the law. And how is it being outdoors? The evil prime minister of
[2:39:56.880 --> 2:40:00.880]  Australia. What a devil works for. He's well known devil works for by the way, folks. Well,
[2:40:00.880 --> 2:40:04.880]  just walking, you know, a few feet somehow is going to spread the virus. I mean, and this is
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:09.200]  always the incident. This is their martial law takeover plan. This is the Milgram experiment.
[2:40:09.760 --> 2:40:14.000]  Obviousness of it. In other words, when you're doing things like you go to Costco and you can't
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:19.120]  get it, but you go to your local store and you can get it. Only big farmers open. Only big stores
[2:40:19.120 --> 2:40:22.880]  are open. Everybody else is bad. You can see in certain places, but you can't go to church and
[2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:27.520]  sing. Then magically, it spreads. I mean, the woke virus and it's magic. It's all just a giant,
[2:40:27.520 --> 2:40:31.840]  insane power grab because they think they'll never be held accountable. Well, I mean, they did it
[2:40:31.840 --> 2:40:34.960]  in a lifetime with the masks. I mean, they first came out and said, you know, you don't need mask.
[2:40:34.960 --> 2:40:38.400]  You're an idiot. If you think you need mask. And then a week later, oh, you absolutely have to have
[2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:43.280]  mask and just watching people just jump and behave in response. And look, he says it doesn't have
[2:40:43.280 --> 2:40:49.760]  to make sense. Exactly. It doesn't make sense. Yeah. Yes. It's the law. You know, those are air
[2:40:49.760 --> 2:40:54.800]  quotes. Those are just whatever their new directive is, because it's not an actual law. I don't want
[2:40:54.800 --> 2:40:59.600]  to give you a $5,000 fine. Just wear your mask when you're in your little cage. Yeah, exactly.
[2:40:59.600 --> 2:41:02.960]  Only walk out. They're beating up January 6th attainees that weren't violent because they
[2:41:02.960 --> 2:41:06.800]  weren't wearing a mask in their jail cell. Apparently, if you're going to get your clothes
[2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:10.720]  laundered, then you can't get COVID. But if it's for some reason, other than getting your clothes
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:17.200]  laundered, then you can get COVID. You're allowed to go work in the commissary, but you can't leave
[2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:21.520]  other than that. Exactly. I mean, it's doing it in such an obvious way. It's just seeing what you'll
[2:41:21.520 --> 2:41:27.200]  do. It's a corrupt evil group seeing if you'll put up with it. It's all about control. It's always
[2:41:27.200 --> 2:41:31.760]  been about control and it's overt at this point. It's open. Barnes, what's going to happen to all
[2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:35.120]  the leftists that think they're supposed to be rulers over this and they're all learning their
[2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:38.640]  slaves? What's going to happen when they learn they've been betrayed? Well, I mean, then they get
[2:41:38.640 --> 2:41:42.480]  to live the real life experience of a lot of the people that experienced that during the
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:46.880]  Communist rise to power anywhere it took place. Because how many of them supported it till they
[2:41:46.880 --> 2:41:50.480]  were inside? They're all cheering Fidel until they ended up on the other end of the shooting
[2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:55.680]  range. And not on the side of the shooting range that was pulling the trigger. And so they had
[2:41:55.680 --> 2:42:00.400]  to wake up to that reality. But what's amazing is history does repeat itself and history does rhyme
[2:42:00.400 --> 2:42:06.080]  as Mark Twain famously said. And we're just seeing more examples of it. Where it has not rhymed is
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:09.840]  people have pushed back and people have fought back in the court of public opinion. That's what
[2:42:09.840 --> 2:42:16.480]  has changed. What is I just want listeners to get submission is death. I mean, the only hope we've
[2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:21.520]  got like it's not like they're gonna we submit and they're nice to us. We submit it's over as Jordan
[2:42:21.520 --> 2:42:25.440]  Peterson. We know that's Jordan Peter. He took the vaccine said, Hey, just just take it. Just take
[2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:29.200]  the shot. And now he says it was completely the wrong decision because all they did is double
[2:42:29.200 --> 2:42:33.520]  down and make it worse. And so even Jordan Peterson recognizes that if they're going to run rough
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:36.560]  shot over him, they're not going to run rough shot over everybody else. And then it's going to be
[2:42:36.560 --> 2:42:40.480]  more, more, more, you got to take more, more, more. Exactly. I mean, look at what happened with the
[2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:45.040]  everybody who's a union represented in terms of Ford and GM all end up having to back down
[2:42:45.040 --> 2:42:48.320]  because a bunch of ordinary workers stood up and said, No, we're not taking this. That's it.
[2:42:48.320 --> 2:42:53.200]  Exercise your power. It's our only hope and it's pure victory. We'll be back final segment of the
[2:42:53.200 --> 2:43:03.200]  sour. Let's go ahead and take another call. I have a question to ask you. Why would you spend your
[2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:08.560]  money this Christmas season to buy gifts for friends and family and loved ones with the
[2:43:08.560 --> 2:43:15.120]  establishment with the big corporations that are dedicated to waging war on all of our freedoms
[2:43:15.920 --> 2:43:22.000]  and suppressing us and forcing medical tyranny on us. I've never backed down to tyranny. We've had
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:28.240]  incredible successes fighting them. Thanks for your support. But now as 2021 comes to a close,
[2:43:28.240 --> 2:43:35.760]  I want to encourage you now more than ever to support the truth. And you do that at info more
[2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:41.760]  store.com, store wide free shipping, double patriot points running right now, huge deals
[2:43:41.760 --> 2:43:47.440]  of bottom mineral fusion, DNA, force plus and lung cleanse and turbo force. And these are really
[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:53.840]  amazing high quality products that also funding info. The only way you fail is not taking action.
[2:43:57.280 --> 2:44:02.480]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in
[2:44:02.480 --> 2:44:07.280]  world war two that when they came for one group, he wasn't part of that group. So he didn't stand
[2:44:07.280 --> 2:44:10.800]  up. And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group. So he didn't stand up.
[2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:16.320]  And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up. Well, the global social
[2:44:16.320 --> 2:44:20.160]  credit score that China is putting in that's banning people to three hours of video games a week.
[2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:25.040]  If you criticize the government, you can never buy or sell again. Well, that's that's being
[2:44:25.040 --> 2:44:30.240]  brought here and all over the world. The guys of COVID vaccine passports, they even admit it. Now
[2:44:30.240 --> 2:44:34.160]  there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it. They're going to track where you go and what you
[2:44:34.160 --> 2:44:39.360]  do and decide where you can go and what you can do. That's what the lockdowns are about. They'll
[2:44:39.360 --> 2:44:44.160]  accept that. They'll accept anything. So again, the left is being fun right now with all the
[2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:47.920]  censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure, but they're all
[2:44:47.920 --> 2:44:51.680]  going to be targeted by this nightmare as well. We need to get back to basic human rights and
[2:44:51.680 --> 2:44:56.160]  promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[2:44:57.200 --> 2:45:03.040]  It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you
[2:45:03.040 --> 2:45:09.360]  don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing
[2:45:09.360 --> 2:45:15.040]  all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do. So in the future,
[2:45:15.040 --> 2:45:20.880]  under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down, protecting your privacy, protecting
[2:45:20.880 --> 2:45:25.520]  your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's
[2:45:25.520 --> 2:45:30.880]  on your phone is paramount. That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com. We're carrying a

[2:46:01.840 --> 2:46:07.360]  to concerts. I like going to play golf. I like going out to dinner. I like the metropolitan life.
[2:46:07.360 --> 2:46:13.600]  I like everything that comes with this. But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the
[2:46:13.600 --> 2:46:19.120]  hell out of Democrat run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas, because unless
[2:46:19.120 --> 2:46:24.000]  we change course soon, it's all crashing down. Is it time to just move out to the woods? Just
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  time to go get a piece of property in the woods, just get off grid, just get the emergency food
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:32.160]  supplies, just live off the land? That's the survival instinct. But see the worldly part of
[2:46:32.160 --> 2:46:36.800]  me that's still probably the majority part of me says, no, no, no, no, stay in the city. The
[2:46:36.800 --> 2:46:40.480]  survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere. There's never notion that you need to get a
[2:46:40.480 --> 2:46:45.920]  vaccine or a mask. That's the that's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the
[2:46:45.920 --> 2:46:52.160]  audience are facing as well. But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food
[2:46:52.160 --> 2:47:01.360]  supplies. And so we have the best ones at infowarstore.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of
[2:47:01.360 --> 2:47:08.240]  the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:47:21.440 --> 2:47:23.520]  All right, coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:47:23.520 --> 2:47:31.360]  We have a very special guest in the fourth hour today. Jason Burmes is always informative.
[2:47:32.080 --> 2:47:38.160]  I've known that guy 16 years. Robert Barnes, the riding shotgun here on the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:38.800 --> 2:47:46.240]  Big picture. Why do authoritarians try this? Why are they doing it? What precipitated this big
[2:47:46.240 --> 2:47:51.280]  global corporate move to poison and kill the population? I mean, I mean, why would they try
[2:47:51.280 --> 2:47:55.760]  such a risky program? Well, it's people that are driven by control. And it's like much incident
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:48:00.880]  syndrome as an extension of that, where you are so committed to the idea of control or you need
[2:48:00.880 --> 2:48:06.160]  control psychologically or personally or whatever, or economically. So it's an OCD neuroses.
[2:48:06.160 --> 2:48:12.080]  Absolutely. That you have to do it. That you can't not do it into in much of the syndrome. They
[2:48:12.080 --> 2:48:16.240]  literally kill the person in the name of their control. I mean, they're willing to go that far,
[2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:19.440]  they're willing to go to those explain moon shawls and then moon shawls and by proxy. Yes.
[2:48:19.440 --> 2:48:23.920]  So the effectively what happens is somebody wants to feel needed. And the way they need to feel
[2:48:23.920 --> 2:48:28.320]  needed is to have control and the way they have control is to deliberately make their child sick.
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:32.560]  So the child is dependent upon them. So they attack us to be the hero. Absolutely.
[2:48:32.560 --> 2:48:36.480]  To be the person with I mean, you look at Bill Gates, he's a control freak at heart. It's like
[2:48:36.480 --> 2:48:40.720]  it's not money. You know, he's made plenty of money doing what he's doing, but money is simply
[2:48:40.720 --> 2:48:44.960]  a means of control for him. It's not about the money itself. It's about the control that money
[2:48:44.960 --> 2:48:48.960]  buys and money purchases. And it's just an extension of it. I mean, you look at this is what
[2:48:48.960 --> 2:48:53.120]  ties it into some of the abortion laws. I mean, the abortion laws being at such a level that they
[2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:58.640]  can control the population, they can control who is having children. I mean, it was amazing listening
[2:48:58.640 --> 2:49:02.640]  to some of the arguments of the oral arguments this week on that where you were there. They
[2:49:02.640 --> 2:49:07.840]  kept focusing on how poor women disproportionately utilize abortion service. And I'm glad you're
[2:49:07.840 --> 2:49:13.760]  raising that now. It's really an elite war on the on the poor classes spun as for the poor. But
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:18.080]  exactly you've got the inside baseball, you believe the Supreme Court's about to overturn
[2:49:18.080 --> 2:49:22.080]  Roe v Wade and push it back to the States completely. I mean, the the nature of the questions that
[2:49:22.080 --> 2:49:26.480]  were asked that that it was a very extensive oral argument, the nature of the questions asked
[2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:31.920]  is clearly that there are at least five, probably six votes to overturn Roe and Casey,
[2:49:31.920 --> 2:49:36.400]  and to establish that there is not a constitutional right to a second term abortion
[2:49:36.400 --> 2:49:41.600]  pre viability, that viability never made sense as a legal standard or as a moral standard or as
[2:49:41.600 --> 2:49:47.920]  a philosophical standard for determining when the fetus has rights that traditionally historically
[2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:52.240]  the fetus has rights as soon as the fetus can feel pain, which is at six weeks to eight weeks,
[2:49:52.240 --> 2:49:55.760]  depending on where you're at. And that's where I think they're going to allow the States
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:49:59.600]  individually to determine medically and scientifically. Let's hear your prediction.
[2:49:59.600 --> 2:50:03.280]  For those that don't know Roe v Wade's up there, Democrats are threatening violence.
[2:50:03.280 --> 2:50:07.520]  If there's sacraments taken away, I mean, this is a historic view. Let's look at every angle of
[2:50:07.520 --> 2:50:11.840]  this. Sure. So Roe was the first one to establish the right to an abortion. But if you look at it,
[2:50:11.840 --> 2:50:16.560]  it was not really about the right of bodily autonomy or privacy. Justice Thomas repeatedly
[2:50:16.560 --> 2:50:20.640]  asked that question about where the right to an abortion comes from. You look at it historically,
[2:50:20.640 --> 2:50:26.320]  it's an extension of eugenics. There the logic was to allow the doctor to determine who should be,
[2:50:26.320 --> 2:50:30.000]  what children should be brought into the world and should not be brought into the world.
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:33.680]  That's how Governor Northam four years ago said, we keep the baby comfortable,
[2:50:33.680 --> 2:50:38.000]  the government's not involved, the police aren't involved, the doctor decides.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:42.240]  Exactly. I mean, literally killing the baby after the baby is even born is what he was talking about
[2:50:42.240 --> 2:50:46.560]  openly and overtly. And that's, I mean, you have New York, you have other states that have basically
[2:50:46.560 --> 2:50:50.320]  passed laws to that effect. I mean, that's what partial birth abortion really is. The baby is
[2:50:50.320 --> 2:50:55.520]  born. And isn't it crazy that the baby and Roe v Wade didn't even die? We're not supposed to question
[2:50:55.520 --> 2:50:59.840]  that. We're not supposed to question any of the narrative. How many that you look at this, that
[2:50:59.840 --> 2:51:04.640]  they're disproportionately targeting poor minority women, not for their benefit, but in order to
[2:51:04.640 --> 2:51:08.880]  control and limit certain populations from having children in this country. That was explained to
[2:51:08.880 --> 2:51:13.040]  me by one of the top Planned Parenthood officials when I was a young student at Yale over about a
[2:51:13.040 --> 2:51:18.000]  quarter century ago. And it was nice to see the court say that there is no grounds to keep these
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:22.400]  prior precedents. Roe was bad law. Roe just established the right of a doctor to dictate an
[2:51:22.400 --> 2:51:28.000]  abortion if you want it. That never made sense. And Casey all, what Casey said is that there is no
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:32.480]  right of the government, any local or state government to limit abortion, even in cases of
[2:51:32.480 --> 2:51:37.440]  fetal pain, even in cases where there's brain activity, even in cases where the baby has a fully
[2:51:37.440 --> 2:51:41.680]  formed heart and body. And again, I'm not even judging women that thought it wasn't a baby and
[2:51:41.680 --> 2:51:46.720]  had the abortion. The point is, is that this is done from Margaret Sanger and the Rockefellers
[2:51:46.720 --> 2:51:51.200]  and eugenics that created Hitler. I mean, this is about turning humans into a commodity. And now
[2:51:51.200 --> 2:51:55.840]  we see where we are. And it's making sure poor people don't have two quote unquote too many kids.
[2:51:55.840 --> 2:51:59.760]  And in particular, making sure poor minorities don't have quote too many kids. I mean, but how
[2:51:59.760 --> 2:52:04.800]  many poor poor people that had six, seven, eight kids that one or two of them heard not to be,
[2:52:04.800 --> 2:52:08.800]  you know, virtuosos. I mean, you just, there's very few people that have had an abortion that
[2:52:08.800 --> 2:52:12.320]  don't ultimately end up regretting it more so than the women who decide to go ahead and have the
[2:52:12.320 --> 2:52:17.600]  baby end up regretting having the baby. So the and that all that information that medical literature,
[2:52:17.600 --> 2:52:21.920]  scientific literature, they don't want out there. And you have people like Joy BR acting like a
[2:52:21.920 --> 2:52:26.320]  pro life movement is driven by men. It's not pro life movement is driven by women. It's overwhelmingly
[2:52:26.320 --> 2:52:30.560]  why do you think record numbers in the last decade of young people are now anti abortion?
[2:52:30.560 --> 2:52:34.640]  Because despite all the propaganda, they just get its wrong respect for life. I mean, I think
[2:52:34.640 --> 2:52:38.720]  you look at a culture that degrades life to such a degree that it celebrates abortion where you
[2:52:38.720 --> 2:52:43.280]  have people on Tik Tok celebrating the number of abortions they had. And I think the ordinary person
[2:52:43.280 --> 2:52:48.080]  is horrified to see that because ultimately it's a degree like even if you do it, you don't make a
[2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:53.280]  joke out of it. No, exactly. I mean, the people that sort of understood people in crisis and in
[2:52:53.280 --> 2:52:57.520]  certain circumstances and could be empathetic with. So we're not even judging people that got
[2:52:57.520 --> 2:53:01.920]  confused. Got it. We're just saying the worship of it is sick. Absolutely. I remember glorious
[2:53:01.920 --> 2:53:06.160]  time. I'm like 10 years ago, wearing a shirt saying I love abortion. It's a kill my baby because
[2:53:06.160 --> 2:53:09.200]  it's the degradation of human life at the end of the day. And the new thing to do is like you
[2:53:09.200 --> 2:53:13.440]  bet it was a human and I killed it. I'm in charge. I mean, very arrogant statement. I mean, it goes
[2:53:13.440 --> 2:53:16.560]  back to the Roman days of the Roman Empire. You took, you know, I mean, they literally took babies
[2:53:16.560 --> 2:53:21.520]  out and bashed their heads on the ground. I mean, so those ways of not once you don't recognize
[2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:26.960]  and respect life, that's going to go into other areas of law, other areas of society, other areas
[2:53:26.960 --> 2:53:32.000]  of civilization. Well, it's the opposite of liberal. Fascistic. It's very fascistic. It's
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:36.480]  eugenics. I mean, all of abortion in America legally has been rooted in the eugenics movement
[2:53:36.480 --> 2:53:40.720]  going all the way back. And so that's what once you understand that and you hear those
[2:53:40.720 --> 2:53:44.800]  arguments about how we better keep abortion around because look at all the poor women that
[2:53:44.800 --> 2:53:48.560]  are going to have kids. That's really the subtext of the message of the oral argument
[2:53:48.560 --> 2:53:53.920]  that the pro-abortion side was making this week. And that's a very disturbing and unsettling side.
[2:53:53.920 --> 2:53:58.480]  And it's the very people, it's the same people arguing for forced vaccinations or saying
[2:53:58.480 --> 2:54:02.880]  you have bodily autonomy to allow you to take another life. No, what's consistent with their
[2:54:02.880 --> 2:54:06.880]  belief structure is they believe in eugenics and both forced vaccination. They want control over
[2:54:06.880 --> 2:54:12.320]  you. Kill the baby, take the shot. Correct. And that's why they target the same populations for
[2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:17.280]  this. So it's disproportionately targeting disadvantaged populations. And they even
[2:54:17.280 --> 2:54:21.120]  advocated for that openly. But I think the U.S. Supreme Court, there's at least five justices
[2:54:21.120 --> 2:54:24.800]  to completely overturn it. I think there's six. I think Roberts doesn't want to be the
[2:54:24.800 --> 2:54:29.360]  in the dissent. So you're going to see six justices say Rose, no, no longer the law of the land.
[2:54:29.360 --> 2:54:33.360]  Casey's no longer the law of the land. There is no constitutional right to an abortion.
[2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:36.000]  And the states have a right to regulate it and restrict it as they see fit.
[2:54:36.640 --> 2:54:41.120]  When does that happen? Do you think I think that happens sometime in the summer? It may happen by
[2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:45.520]  spring, but sometime for sure in the summer, because the three liberal justices were basically
[2:54:45.520 --> 2:54:50.560]  begging for the magic of starry decisis to save them. And it was clear it's not going to save them.
[2:54:50.560 --> 2:54:55.040]  And thankfully, this this is where Trump will have lasting effect to his credit.
[2:54:55.040 --> 2:54:58.880]  There were a lot of places where his nominees have not stood up, not delivered,
[2:54:58.880 --> 2:55:03.520]  like the elections, like the vaccine mandate so far. But this is an area where it would be
[2:55:03.520 --> 2:55:08.480]  amazing if Trump's nominees were the first ones to actually restore a meaningful right to life
[2:55:08.480 --> 2:55:14.400]  in America and a rightful respect of the human life that is the fetal life in America. That
[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:21.840]  would be entirely a credit to him if they do so by summer. Inflation, global food prices rise again
[2:55:21.840 --> 2:55:27.680]  hitting world record highs. How does the economics feed into all this? I mean, we're definitely coming
[2:55:27.680 --> 2:55:31.760]  to the end of what we've known. Well, what we need is a new global digital currency. That's where
[2:55:31.760 --> 2:55:35.520]  they're going. They're going to say, you know, with the problems we have, we need to stabilize
[2:55:35.520 --> 2:55:38.960]  things. We need to be able to collect on revenue. We can't do taxes the way we want to around the
[2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:44.080]  world. We need a global digital tax currency such that everything and ultimately they'll say they
[2:55:44.080 --> 2:55:48.240]  probably need to put that global digital currency physically in your body in some form of chip form.
[2:55:48.800 --> 2:55:52.480]  And that's not happening. I mean, they already tried it. Bill Gates has put this all out,
[2:55:52.480 --> 2:55:56.320]  tried it in India several years ago. So they're going to continue to do it. There's already
[2:55:56.320 --> 2:56:00.240]  talk afoot. They need to come up with a pretext for it. And inflation and other aspects of
[2:56:00.240 --> 2:56:04.320]  destabilization of the currency provides the pretext by which they can introduce a global
[2:56:04.320 --> 2:56:08.560]  digital currency. And then they can, if your politics have the wrong view, not just shut down
[2:56:08.560 --> 2:56:12.560]  your Twitter account, they can shut down your ability to buy groceries, buy rent, get on a plane.
[2:56:12.560 --> 2:56:18.320]  That's the holy grail of control. Speaking of that, ladies and gentlemen, keep us on air.

[2:57:56.720 --> 2:58:03.680]  loved ones with the establishment, with the big corporations that are dedicated to waging war
[2:58:03.680 --> 2:58:09.840]  on all of our freedoms and suppressing us and forcing medical tyranny on us. I've never backed
[2:58:09.840 --> 2:58:15.600]  down to tyranny. We've had incredible successes fighting them. Thanks for your support. But now

[3:00:09.520 --> 3:00:16.960]  that people inside restaurants eating croissants and drinking coffee have taken their injections.
[3:00:16.960 --> 3:00:23.840]  The videos on info wars.com, Paris police in this particular video, check proof of vaccination while
[3:00:23.840 --> 3:00:32.800]  donors eat. Think about that, ladies and gentlemen. This is what's happening. This is what's coming
[3:00:32.800 --> 3:00:37.760]  here. This is Oh, have you had your shot? Have we put in your but we need the everybody used
[3:00:37.760 --> 3:00:43.520]  to having their papers checked. Robert Barnes, this is this is where we're about to be next.
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:47.760]  If we don't completely, I mean, you'll get to detention camps being checked for your papers
[3:00:47.760 --> 3:00:51.520]  just to go into a restaurant for your kid to go to school, drop your kid off to school and all
[3:00:51.520 --> 3:00:55.280]  of a sudden it'll be surprise vaccination day and you have no idea what's going into your kid's body
[3:00:55.280 --> 3:00:59.280]  with implied consent being presumed because you left your kid off at a public school and then
[3:00:59.280 --> 3:01:04.960]  the media censors when people die. Absolutely. I mean, the American Heart Association can't tell
[3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:10.080]  you as a heart attack race. The UN said didn't authorize that. We're seeing people drop dead
[3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:16.080]  during games or drop have major heart incidents 66 time increase. It's incredible. I mean,
[3:01:16.080 --> 3:01:20.080]  right live for us to watch it and they're trying to tell us what we just watched what we just saw
[3:01:20.080 --> 3:01:24.560]  we just witnessed was not what we just watched or just witnessed or just saw and more and more
[3:01:24.560 --> 3:01:28.640]  people are getting to understand that and realize that and recognize that. For example,
[3:01:28.640 --> 3:01:33.840]  Richard Barris people's pundit did polling to look at how many people are reporting severe
[3:01:33.840 --> 3:01:40.480]  reactions to the vaccine. It's now over 5% and that's about 50 times higher than the number of
[3:01:40.480 --> 3:01:44.880]  people who report serious problems from COVID. And again, imagine like you said earlier, the tail.
[3:01:44.880 --> 3:01:49.440]  If this is just up front, good. This risk there was the risk wasn't supposed to be termed. The risk
[3:01:49.440 --> 3:01:53.920]  was supposed to be long term. It was supposed to be we're not going to see any bad. When we were
[3:01:53.920 --> 3:01:57.280]  looking at studying the fighting this legally, we're like the problem is going to be the vaccines
[3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:00.320]  not going to injure people until 10 years from now. And then it's going to be too late to do
[3:02:00.320 --> 3:02:04.800]  anything about it. What we did not expect is that it would have this severe an impact right out of
[3:02:04.800 --> 3:02:11.040]  the gate when you have one out of 20 people reporting severe disabling reactions to the
[3:02:11.040 --> 3:02:14.160]  to the vaccine. And these are the people that are simply aware of it. This doesn't cover the
[3:02:14.160 --> 3:02:18.960]  people that are dead because they can't be pulled obviously, nor does it cover people who don't know
[3:02:18.960 --> 3:02:23.040]  that they're stroke don't know that their heart problems don't know that they're neurological
[3:02:23.040 --> 3:02:27.200]  problems don't know that their physical problems are in reaction in response to the vaccine.
[3:02:27.200 --> 3:02:30.880]  That's probably five times what we already know. Absolutely. That's the historical metrics. When
[3:02:30.880 --> 3:02:34.720]  they've actually studied this, it's anywhere from 10 to 100 times more people experience
[3:02:34.720 --> 3:02:39.520]  adverse effects when the vaccines than they then actually realize or recognize and 90%
[3:02:39.520 --> 3:02:43.440]  of people who suffer from medical malpractice never even know about it to even bring legal remedy
[3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:48.320]  about it. So I mean, it is terrifying the number of people are being harmed by this experimental
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:52.720]  drug. And that's why there's such an effort to silence and censor anybody who points it out,
[3:02:52.720 --> 3:02:57.120]  regardless of whether they're a doctor or a scientist, a politician, a public official or an
[3:02:57.120 --> 3:03:03.120]  ordinary citizen. Well, that interview yesterday with Robert Kennedy Jr. on info wars with
[3:03:03.120 --> 3:03:08.560]  Christie Lee was so powerful. It's on band video. Everybody shares it. Robert Barnes,
[3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:11.920]  we got a minute and a half to break closing comments. Really great to have you here. Well,
[3:03:11.920 --> 3:03:15.840]  the key has been everybody in the court of public opinion fighting back. So all those people that
[3:03:15.840 --> 3:03:19.600]  may think they're powerless, who may think that they can't challenge things, can't contest things,
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:23.920]  can't question things, can't put up any kind of resistance. The reality is you go into your local
[3:03:23.920 --> 3:03:28.480]  school board, you talking to your employer, you talking to a friend or neighbor, you supporting
[3:03:28.480 --> 3:03:33.440]  places like info wars and keeping it alive despite the massive legal lawfare that is being fought
[3:03:33.440 --> 3:03:37.680]  against them in the political war and the court of public opinion and the media lies and libel
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:42.160]  and the efforts of politicians to try to defame and destroy. Despite all of that, the reason why
[3:03:42.160 --> 3:03:46.400]  info wars still exists, the reason why they haven't had the degree of success that they wanted to in
[3:03:46.400 --> 3:03:51.360]  this COVID landscape and this public health dictatorship and tyranny is because of ordinary
[3:03:51.360 --> 3:03:55.440]  people like you fighting back. It's only because you've continued to resist, you've continued to
[3:03:55.440 --> 3:03:59.200]  share independent information, you've continued to contribute in the court of public opinion,
[3:03:59.200 --> 3:04:03.120]  which is ultimately reflects itself in the courts of legislators and politicians,
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:07.200]  and then ultimately shows up in the courts of law themselves. And that's why we're seeing court
[3:04:07.200 --> 3:04:10.960]  after court after court saying these are lawless actions that are taking place. And that's just
[3:04:10.960 --> 3:04:15.600]  the beginning of the fight back. And that fight back is only possible because ordinary everyday
[3:04:15.600 --> 3:04:19.120]  people like yourselves have chosen to do something about it. That's right. The globalists have
[3:04:19.120 --> 3:04:25.200]  launched a major attack. They started it. But humanity's awakening and really positive things
[3:04:25.200 --> 3:04:28.960]  are happening. I mean, I got to say right now, we're kicking the globalists ass. I mean, if you
[3:04:28.960 --> 3:04:31.920]  look where this goes, they're in deep trouble, but they're going to they're going to pull some
[3:04:31.920 --> 3:04:36.880]  new stuff. Oh, yeah, the battle is just beginning. But the the people are fighting back in such a
[3:04:36.880 --> 3:04:41.440]  way that that is the only way we will be able to restore and keep liberal. How do folks find that
[3:04:41.440 --> 3:04:46.960]  great podcast show you do? Sure. And if you want a Viva Barnes law dot locals dot com is where all
[3:04:46.960 --> 3:04:50.720]  of our content is curated together. All right, Robert Barnes, thank you so much. Jason Burma
[3:04:50.720 --> 3:04:59.280]  takes over the no insurer in 55 minutes. 2021. So when I first started taking survival skill,
[3:04:59.280 --> 3:05:04.800]  basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely
[3:05:04.800 --> 3:05:09.520]  holding onto a job. And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got
[3:05:09.520 --> 3:05:14.400]  was the original survival shield, the X1. And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter,
[3:05:14.400 --> 3:05:18.160]  you came out with that you had, you know, with a deeper source, you know, and I got really excited
[3:05:18.160 --> 3:05:23.600]  about that. So I took it. And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like, literally, like,
[3:05:23.600 --> 3:05:29.040]  my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with people again. And
[3:05:29.040 --> 3:05:34.240]  over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically
[3:05:34.240 --> 3:05:38.720]  all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently
[3:05:38.720 --> 3:05:43.360]  is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway,
[3:05:43.360 --> 3:05:48.000]  so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system.
[3:05:48.000 --> 3:05:51.600]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[3:05:51.600 --> 3:05:54.960]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[3:05:54.960 --> 3:06:08.960]  Hey, everybody, Jason Bermas here doing the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show. Before
[3:06:08.960 --> 3:06:17.120]  we get going, I do want to say this info wars is under attack. Save info wars.com is where you can
[3:06:17.120 --> 3:06:25.440]  go right now to support this broadcast and independent journalism. You truly will not see
[3:06:25.440 --> 3:06:36.080]  anywhere else. Now, with the glane Maxwell trial in the news and the controversy amongst, I would
[3:06:36.080 --> 3:06:43.600]  say some viewers of this program and others on whether or not Donald Trump had a relationship
[3:06:43.600 --> 3:06:50.640]  with Jeffrey Epstein. I think it is important to be perfectly honest that they did and that there
[3:06:50.640 --> 3:06:58.240]  are aspects of Trump that we must be critical of. So we're going to explore what that relationship
[3:06:58.240 --> 3:07:04.560]  was really about and what information we have about that relationship as opposed to some of the
[3:07:04.560 --> 3:07:12.000]  other relationships that Jeffrey Epstein had. We're going to get into why Bill Barr was never,
[3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:18.880]  ever, ever a good choice to be the head of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General,
[3:07:18.880 --> 3:07:24.480]  under Trump and why that was one of his large failures. And then what I'd really like to do
[3:07:24.480 --> 3:07:32.800]  is expound upon the discussion that Alex Jones, Michael Sernovich and Tim Poole had on Trump's
[3:07:32.800 --> 3:07:38.320]  failures because I know there's a lot of people, including Alex at this point, that want Trump
[3:07:38.320 --> 3:07:47.440]  in 2024. But unless we are going to have some major maya culpas, not just with his relationship
[3:07:47.440 --> 3:07:54.640]  with Epstein and wishing glane Maxwell well, by the way, twice as she was arrested, we really
[3:07:54.640 --> 3:08:02.000]  have to look at the Assange situation and why that was one of the largest failures out there.
[3:08:02.000 --> 3:08:10.320]  So let's start with where this relationship was at. And it appears by most standards that
[3:08:10.320 --> 3:08:16.640]  there was a business relationship in properties at some point. And of course, these guys hanging
[3:08:16.640 --> 3:08:23.440]  out. Now I want to emphasize there is no evidence of any type of pedophilia and that the way that
[3:08:23.440 --> 3:08:28.240]  they went after Trump love him or hate him, you have to, you have to believe that if they had
[3:08:28.240 --> 3:08:35.440]  that evidence, they would have used it against him. But in the book, filthy rich by James Patterson
[3:08:35.440 --> 3:08:42.000]  from 2016, you really got a glimpse that there was a relationship. And what's interesting about
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:50.880]  that book is that James Patterson is like the most prolific and popular fiction writer out there.
[3:08:50.880 --> 3:08:58.000]  At that point, I would even argue he rivals Stephen King, right? As one of the most notable
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:02.800]  authors out there, I will say this, after this book, he did do a book with Bill Clinton. We
[3:09:02.800 --> 3:09:09.200]  can't ignore that fact. And it was that book that filthy rich, the Netflix Jeffrey Epstein special
[3:09:09.200 --> 3:09:15.360]  was based on, which did not talk about any of the intelligence ties. Okay. And that's huge and very
[3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:22.400]  important and something we will get into, especially when we talk about Bill Barr. But in this book,
[3:09:22.400 --> 3:09:28.000]  you not only had the story that yes, they were traveling together and hanging out together,
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:34.320]  but that they had a falling out via a incident at Mar-a-Lago, where one of the people that
[3:09:34.320 --> 3:09:40.800]  worked for Trump for a very long time, his daughter had been turned out and abused by Epstein. Now
[3:09:40.800 --> 3:09:47.680]  later on, documentation will come out that that was Virginia Guthrie Roberts. Now, Virginia Guthrie
[3:09:47.680 --> 3:09:52.800]  Roberts is not testified in this trial. That should let you know right out of the gates,
[3:09:52.800 --> 3:10:00.480]  this is more than likely a show trial as they will not go into information that links people like
[3:10:00.480 --> 3:10:06.560]  Bill Richardson, Glenn Dubin, George Mitchell, and others, despite the fact that their names
[3:10:06.560 --> 3:10:13.520]  are named by the pilot, right? And in that information, Virginia Guthrie Roberts identifies
[3:10:13.520 --> 3:10:20.000]  as this girl from Mar-a-Lago and says that is why that relationship ended. But there are others
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:25.600]  that say that it ended over a business deal. Now, whether or not you believe that Trump
[3:10:26.400 --> 3:10:31.920]  was on Epstein's plane, one of the other things that I always talked about was there's no doubt
[3:10:31.920 --> 3:10:37.040]  that he rode on Donald Trump's plane. So all the way back, I think it was like in the early 2000s,
[3:10:37.040 --> 3:10:41.280]  Vanity Fair had done a piece where they were talking to Donald Trump and he was on a plane with
[3:10:41.280 --> 3:10:46.880]  Melania and he commented to Jeffrey Epstein and Glenn Maxwell as they got on his plane that he
[3:10:46.880 --> 3:10:54.400]  had broken the cardinal sin and been late for someone else's plane. And again, this is a failure
[3:10:54.400 --> 3:11:00.800]  on Trump's part. Remember, Trump played the Epstein card on the way into office, right?
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:09.120]  Hannity asks Trump about Bill Clinton, who we now know for sure 20 plus times on the plane,
[3:11:09.120 --> 3:11:15.440]  the Clinton Initiative, claimed by Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer to be started by Jeffrey Epstein.
[3:11:15.440 --> 3:11:21.360]  You have that crazy painting of Bill Clinton in a blue dress in his New York mansion,
[3:11:21.360 --> 3:11:27.360]  just nutty stuff, right? Just nutty stuff. But Trump leaned into it when Hannity asked him
[3:11:27.360 --> 3:11:31.280]  about Bill Clinton. He said, oh, he might have some problems being a friend of Jeffrey Epstein.
[3:11:31.280 --> 3:11:39.360]  So he was playing to that base that they wanted him to vote for. And when you look at this,
[3:11:40.400 --> 3:11:48.400]  he bragged apparently, Epstein bragged that he had thrown parties where Melania Trump was actually
[3:11:48.400 --> 3:11:55.440]  introduced to Donald before they were married. Now, I'm actually going to play a very positive
[3:11:55.440 --> 3:12:04.720]  Trump clip a little later on when we get into this COVID 1984 total takeover, fourth industrial
[3:12:04.720 --> 3:12:12.640]  revolution, transhumanist agenda. But I want to say this, there are huge problems with Donald
[3:12:12.640 --> 3:12:17.280]  Trump. And no matter how negatively I'm about to talk about him, I want to say I voted for him
[3:12:17.280 --> 3:12:25.600]  twice over the other candidates. When you had the first time around, I was much more a Rand Paul guy
[3:12:25.600 --> 3:12:30.400]  when we were at the primaries. But Trump was the other guy, in my opinion, that was saying more
[3:12:30.400 --> 3:12:35.440]  truth than anybody. And you know, I had to roll the dice on him. And in some respects, you know,
[3:12:35.440 --> 3:12:40.720]  I think that his president did have major accomplishments in others, especially with
[3:12:40.720 --> 3:12:47.680]  Assange, which we'll get into. It did not. So going in to Trump, I wanted to say these three
[3:12:47.680 --> 3:12:53.120]  things. And I was warning about these three things prior to the fact of him being elected.
[3:12:53.120 --> 3:13:00.000]  Number one, Donald Trump is a gangster. All right, he's a gangster guys. I hate to tell you that
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:06.000]  doesn't mean that he goes around shooting people or you know, capping them off. But this is a guy
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:12.560]  that started Atlantic City. Now, if you don't think that building a city that's based on organized
[3:13:12.560 --> 3:13:17.520]  gambling doesn't have anything to do with crime, I mean, just think about the unions
[3:13:17.520 --> 3:13:23.840]  and the construction all the way back in the 80s. Again, you're not paying attention to kind of a
[3:13:23.840 --> 3:13:31.680]  misogynist guys, three wives, Stormy Daniels, beauty pageants, a guy that, you know, basically
[3:13:31.680 --> 3:13:38.720]  bragged about living on Big Macs and floozies, right? Not a surprise. All things I could get over.
[3:13:38.720 --> 3:13:46.480]  Three, and he's an actor. He was an actor. You go even outside of his reality TV show and he's
[3:13:46.480 --> 3:13:54.960]  somebody I grew up with as a kid. He was very primed on shows like Donahue and Oprah and others.
[3:13:54.960 --> 3:13:59.600]  And then on top of that, you had that vaudeville aspect of him being related to professional
[3:13:59.600 --> 3:14:06.480]  wrestling all the way back in the day. So those were things that I warned about. You took him
[3:14:06.480 --> 3:14:12.880]  with Donald Trump or you rely into yourself. And the fact that he might be led astray when it comes
[3:14:12.880 --> 3:14:20.800]  to war and foreign policy. And I think that was absolutely 100% the case, right? So you look at,
[3:14:20.800 --> 3:14:26.720]  for instance, Bill Barr, and we got about a minute and a half. So we're going to play the clip
[3:14:26.720 --> 3:14:34.880]  on the other side. But Bill Barr actually had to talk about recusing himself from the Epstein case,
[3:14:34.880 --> 3:14:42.480]  because he worked for Kirkland and Ellis, who represented Epstein, what, during the 2007-2008
[3:14:43.120 --> 3:14:48.160]  Palm Beach trial. Yet they were doing law work for them. And then you get into Maria Farmer,
[3:14:48.160 --> 3:14:55.360]  who's not being called in this case. She went to what? The police and the NYPD all the way back
[3:14:55.360 --> 3:15:02.720]  in 1996. And we only found that out in 2017. Wasn't common knowledge. I mean, was it because
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:09.440]  Epstein had intelligence connections? Was it the fact that that was brought up to Alexander Acosta,
[3:15:09.440 --> 3:15:15.520]  who made that sweetheart deal and also another failure of Trump? Was his labor secretary gets
[3:15:15.520 --> 3:15:19.680]  asked about it? Says, well, you know, basically talks around it and then all of a sudden asked to
[3:15:19.680 --> 3:15:26.720]  resign. Ask yourself that question. We're going to get deeper into Bill Barr, his relationship with
[3:15:26.720 --> 3:15:33.280]  the CIA, the deep state, and even Robert Mueller. Oh, they were best buddies before Russia gate.
[3:15:33.280 --> 3:15:38.480]  Oh, they covered up the BCCI scandal together that you're going to learn about on the flip side.
[3:15:38.480 --> 3:15:43.600]  You bet they did only at infowars.com. I am Jason Berman, sitting in for the fourth hour.
[3:15:43.600 --> 3:15:49.920]  Remember to go to check out saveinfowars.com and make that donation right now. They need you,
[3:15:49.920 --> 3:15:58.400]  folks. We will see you on the flip side. What if you could? It's only been in the last 60 years
[3:15:58.400 --> 3:16:03.200]  that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[3:16:03.920 --> 3:16:07.680]  But if you look at all the different studies reports about NASA and other governments, other
[3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:12.880]  agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate. The only constant,
[3:16:12.880 --> 3:16:20.160]  the only great truth is change is the only constant. So yes, climate change is totally real.
[3:16:20.160 --> 3:16:23.920]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then
[3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:27.040]  it's going to be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to.
[3:16:27.040 --> 3:16:32.800]  Okay, now it's just climate change. But did you know that manmade climate change is a real thing
[3:16:33.360 --> 3:16:38.480]  when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[3:16:38.480 --> 3:16:44.000]  They have. Weather control trees from 1979 and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:49.360]  for a very long time. In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spring
[3:16:49.360 --> 3:16:54.160]  different particles out of jet engines to control the weather. So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[3:16:55.280 --> 3:17:01.360]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists. I wanted to stop
[3:17:01.360 --> 3:17:06.720]  their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went
[3:17:06.720 --> 3:17:12.320]  operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed,
[3:17:12.320 --> 3:17:18.320]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[3:17:18.320 --> 3:17:22.240]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[3:17:22.240 --> 3:17:26.400]  tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[3:17:26.400 --> 3:17:30.480]  the truth. So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda,
[3:17:30.480 --> 3:17:34.240]  but we've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high
[3:17:34.240 --> 3:17:38.560]  quality, storeable food. You've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices

[3:18:17.440 --> 3:18:22.080]  where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[3:18:22.080 --> 3:18:26.480]  This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get

[3:19:52.080 --> 3:19:54.240]  1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[3:19:57.680 --> 3:20:03.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:03.680 --> 3:20:18.240]  We are back. I'm Jason Burma sitting in for Alex Jones in the fourth hour. We're talking
[3:20:18.240 --> 3:20:28.080]  Bill Barr and VCCI. Now, for those that are not aware of what the VCCI scandal is,
[3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:34.880]  it was a scandal in which you had those working in the Iran Contra network,
[3:20:34.880 --> 3:20:43.120]  those working in the then Bin Laden network, and then a slew of other power players in politics
[3:20:43.120 --> 3:20:49.280]  and drug running getting caught up in a huge banking scandal. And guess what? The intelligence
[3:20:49.280 --> 3:20:55.120]  networks were involved. And that's why they called in their man, Bill Barr, to work with their man,
[3:20:55.120 --> 3:21:03.920]  Robert Mueller, to cover up the vast majority. Before I play this clip, I need people to understand
[3:21:03.920 --> 3:21:12.000]  that Bill Barr is lifelong CIA. He was in the Central Intelligence Agency before he became
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:20.400]  a lawyer. Okay, that's number one. Then he was chosen by Mr. CIA himself, George Herbert Walker
[3:21:20.400 --> 3:21:26.640]  Bush as his attorney general, one of the youngest ever. I believe the only two younger under him
[3:21:26.640 --> 3:21:33.840]  were Robert Kennedy Jr. and Ramsey Clark. Ramsey Clark, actually a very good man. So let's play
[3:21:33.840 --> 3:21:39.200]  this clip and you're going to find out a little bit about VCCI and how behind the scenes Bill Barr
[3:21:39.200 --> 3:21:45.360]  was kind of negotiating all the work for the probe. Okay. And all the focus was then on Robert
[3:21:45.360 --> 3:21:53.760]  Mueller, who not only will become his adversary in Russiagate, but also was put as the head of the
[3:21:53.760 --> 3:22:01.280]  FBI right as the 9-11 thing got going and obfuscated the truth there and put down whistleblowers,
[3:22:01.280 --> 3:22:05.520]  including Robert Wright, Barry Carmotti, and others. So let's play this clip.
[3:22:06.240 --> 3:22:12.000]  Attorney General Designant Barr faces likely questions on speed of VCCI probe. What's that about?
[3:22:12.000 --> 3:22:20.640]  Well, as you know, that's probably the largest bank scandal to hit town in many a moon. And he's
[3:22:21.600 --> 3:22:25.920]  going to be asked about why the Justice Department didn't move faster on obvious leads.
[3:22:26.560 --> 3:22:35.680]  I think it will come out that in July he took charge of this and began pushing for more speed.
[3:22:36.720 --> 3:22:40.320]  And while all the attention is focused on Assistant Attorney General Robert Mueller,
[3:22:40.320 --> 3:22:44.160]  who heads the criminal division, I think it'll turn out that Barr had quite a role.
[3:22:44.720 --> 3:22:51.440]  So again, working with Mueller back in the day, this is how this works. And I would be remiss
[3:22:52.160 --> 3:23:01.520]  if I did not know, okay, that it was reported that Bill Barr visited Epstein's prison prior
[3:23:01.520 --> 3:23:06.960]  to the first suicide attempt. Of course, the factcheck.org people have said it's a baseless
[3:23:06.960 --> 3:23:13.200]  claim that Barr was there. But when you look at this, think about it. You've got two different
[3:23:13.200 --> 3:23:19.600]  incidents. You've got no camera footage whatsoever. You've got a prison in MCCC that kept El Chapo and
[3:23:19.600 --> 3:23:26.160]  had not had another suicide for 13 years. Okay, those are the things they don't want you to
[3:23:26.160 --> 3:23:32.640]  understand. So Bill Barr, never your friend, somebody that needed to really be looked at
[3:23:32.640 --> 3:23:37.120]  that from the beginning. And again, a failure of the Trump administration to put somebody like
[3:23:37.120 --> 3:23:46.080]  that in power. And of course, that came to roost via the 2020 election. Okay. And when we talk
[3:23:46.080 --> 3:23:51.680]  about BCCI and them covering up all this Iran Contra, you look at these networks. Now we have
[3:23:51.680 --> 3:23:58.560]  to talk about Ghislaine Maxwell and her father, Robert, and why that's important. Okay, because
[3:23:58.560 --> 3:24:04.800]  that Iran Contra network, we're not going to play the clip, but anybody can check out my film
[3:24:04.800 --> 3:24:10.960]  Invisible Empire, a new world order defined for free. And in it, we have a large section,
[3:24:10.960 --> 3:24:19.840]  by the way, produced by Infowars. In it, we have a large section in which we go over the fact that
[3:24:19.840 --> 3:24:25.840]  the Israelis were the ones that were buying the guns from Czechoslovakia and Poland, sending them
[3:24:25.840 --> 3:24:30.400]  down to South America. The drugs would be shipped up into Florida and Mina and then distributed.
[3:24:30.400 --> 3:24:36.320]  That money would then be reimbursed to the Israelis, giving plausible deniability and
[3:24:36.320 --> 3:24:42.240]  this network. Now at the same time, this is going on, right? During the 80s, there's this media mogul.
[3:24:43.520 --> 3:24:47.360]  You know, media, because, you know, there was no fake news back then, right? It wasn't
[3:24:47.360 --> 3:24:53.840]  intelligence driven back then named Robert Maxwell, that places like the Associated Press were
[3:24:53.840 --> 3:25:01.120]  telling you it was a hoax. It was a hoax that Seymour Hirsch, one of the last few journalists
[3:25:01.120 --> 3:25:05.920]  living in this generation, still alive today and we're going to get into Hirsch and the
[3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:12.960]  Trump presidency in a moment, okay? Hirsch hoaxed over claim of new evidence on Maxwell
[3:25:12.960 --> 3:25:18.880]  Israel link, because Maxwell, this media mogul, was really an Israeli asset,
[3:25:18.880 --> 3:25:24.000]  Mossad asset connected to British intelligence and these were the type of headlines at the time.
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:30.160]  Mirrorgate, a press empire strikes back. Scandal, Seymour Hirsch has been accused of libel,
[3:25:30.160 --> 3:25:34.960]  because of book linking British journalists with Israeli Secret Service. Notice this is amplified
[3:25:34.960 --> 3:25:39.520]  and it's all over the place, right? Three years later, gets a nice little side article,
[3:25:39.520 --> 3:25:44.880]  right there. See how little the side article is, tiny? Yeah, US author gets apology in libel case
[3:25:44.880 --> 3:25:53.120]  and by that time, Robert Maxwell had already fallen off his boat and died, the Lady Galane,
[3:25:53.840 --> 3:26:03.600]  okay? So, this is the real deep state. This is the real intelligence network that you might get
[3:26:03.600 --> 3:26:12.240]  flavors of conservatism or liberalism, but at the core of it, they're all working together and,
[3:26:12.240 --> 3:26:18.960]  you know, just to talk about Assange for a moment, okay? You had Julian Assange and the fact that
[3:26:18.960 --> 3:26:25.600]  Trump knew that he was not the source of those documents through Russia. In other words, all
[3:26:25.600 --> 3:26:34.640]  the DNC documents not there. Seymour Hirsch is on audio talking about how he had an FBI asset of his
[3:26:34.640 --> 3:26:39.920]  who ends up in court papers to be Andrew McCabe, by the way, okay? The deputy director of the FBI
[3:26:39.920 --> 3:26:43.760]  and somebody who was vocally against the Trump administration. Anybody can look into that as
[3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:49.520]  well. And in it, he not only says that the information seems to have come from Seth Rich,
[3:26:49.520 --> 3:26:55.840]  but this whole Russiagate thing is a Brennan operation. He says that, you know, that, yes,
[3:26:55.840 --> 3:27:02.960]  it was Seth Rich and it was really Trump's arrogance by sending Dana Rohrbacher in to see
[3:27:03.920 --> 3:27:09.040]  Assange and Assange still refusing to give up his source as he had done. He said, look,
[3:27:09.040 --> 3:27:13.040]  all this information is public. I don't need to give up the source and not cut the deal with
[3:27:13.040 --> 3:27:19.280]  Trump and Trump failed, man. Trump is, you know, somebody who took money from Sheldon Adelson,
[3:27:19.280 --> 3:27:25.200]  who headed up UC Global, right? That was his company, who worked for the CIA in applauding to
[3:27:25.200 --> 3:27:32.720]  kidnap and possibly kill Assange. Huge failure. Cassandra Fairbanks, she had audio tapes of one
[3:27:32.720 --> 3:27:41.040]  of Rick Reynolds' assistants talking about how they had showed Trump and Trump Jr., Don Jr.
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:47.840]  these pictures of sometimes women and children that they said had died because of the information
[3:27:47.840 --> 3:27:53.920]  that Assange had leaked, okay, because of this WikiLeaks stuff. All nonsense. And it's because of that,
[3:27:54.480 --> 3:28:01.520]  that I believe Trump signed off on the National Counterintelligence Strategy 2020 to 2022.
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:07.520]  And, you know, there's a really telling part in this where ideologically motivated entities such as
[3:28:07.520 --> 3:28:12.240]  hacktivist, leakivist, and public disclosure organizations pose the same significant terrorist
[3:28:12.240 --> 3:28:22.080]  threats as ISIS, al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, Iran, Cuba, and North Korea. Think about that. No. Listen,
[3:28:22.080 --> 3:28:27.280]  we need public disclosure organizations. We need ideologically motivated entities that are
[3:28:27.280 --> 3:28:33.440]  ideologically motivated in telling the truth. So on the flip of this, when we come back,
[3:28:33.440 --> 3:28:40.400]  I'm actually going to play a clip of Donald Trump talking trash in front of the World Economic
[3:28:40.400 --> 3:28:47.520]  Forum in 2020, and Klaus Nutschwab will get to it. SaveInfoWars.com is where you can make an impact
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:59.360]  right now and save independent journalism. I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ballgames,
[3:28:59.360 --> 3:29:04.480]  I like going to concerts, I like going to play golf, I like going out to dinner. I like the
[3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:10.720]  metropolitan life. I like everything that comes with this. But see, I have the survival instinct
[3:29:10.720 --> 3:29:16.640]  that is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas,
[3:29:16.640 --> 3:29:21.520]  because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down. Is it time to just move out to
[3:29:21.520 --> 3:29:25.520]  the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods, just get off grid, just get the
[3:29:25.520 --> 3:29:30.000]  emergency food supplies, just live off the land? That's the survival instinct. But see, the worldly
[3:29:30.000 --> 3:29:34.800]  part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says, no, no, no, no, no, stay in the city.
[3:29:34.800 --> 3:29:38.640]  The survival instinct says, get the hell out of anywhere they've ever noticed that you need to get
[3:29:38.640 --> 3:29:44.960]  a vaccine or a mask. That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience
[3:29:44.960 --> 3:29:51.040]  are facing as well. But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[3:29:51.040 --> 3:29:53.120]  And so we have the best ones at infowarstore.com.
[3:29:55.120 --> 3:30:01.040]  It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you
[3:30:01.040 --> 3:30:07.360]  don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing
[3:30:07.360 --> 3:30:13.040]  all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do. So in the future,
[3:30:13.040 --> 3:30:19.040]  under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down. Protecting your privacy, protecting your
[3:30:19.040 --> 3:30:23.280]  credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything
[3:30:23.280 --> 3:30:28.320]  that's on your phone is paramount. That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com. We're

[3:30:54.720 --> 3:31:00.560]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from Australia to the
[3:31:00.560 --> 3:31:04.880]  United States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you do
[3:31:04.880 --> 3:31:08.960]  everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[3:31:08.960 --> 3:31:14.720]  taking people away into the night to their facilities and they're planning in the next year
[3:31:14.720 --> 3:31:19.920]  to expand their shield process where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them
[3:31:19.920 --> 3:31:24.320]  in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can
[3:31:24.320 --> 3:31:29.280]  do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America
[3:31:29.280 --> 3:31:35.120]  and are very compliant, meaning us government military grade at infowarstore.com. We have the

[3:32:58.080 --> 3:33:04.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:10.560 --> 3:33:15.920]  We are back. I'm Jason Bermas sitting in for Alex Jones in the fourth hour. We're going to move
[3:33:15.920 --> 3:33:21.440]  away from Epstein and the Ghislaine Maxwell case. If you want to see more coverage on that,
[3:33:21.440 --> 3:33:25.520]  I would encourage you to check out my rock bin where I'm not being censored. In fact,
[3:33:25.520 --> 3:33:33.840]  YouTube hit me with a strike two for apparently cyber bullying Epstein from a January 2020 video
[3:33:33.840 --> 3:33:40.640]  after he had not killed himself for the second time. Weird. I don't know how you cyber bully a
[3:33:40.640 --> 3:33:47.120]  dead person. Maybe I cyber bullied Ghislaine Maxwell. We're not sure, but I want to move this portion
[3:33:47.840 --> 3:33:57.920]  of the program into the fourth industrial revolution and this masquerade that somehow human beings
[3:33:57.920 --> 3:34:04.720]  are killing the planet and we need to regulate everything they do, give them a social credit
[3:34:04.720 --> 3:34:12.720]  score based on their carbon usage and how much they listen to the state in this New World Order
[3:34:12.720 --> 3:34:20.640]  repackaged great reset agenda and give Trump some credit here. Now, what we're about to watch
[3:34:21.360 --> 3:34:28.880]  is Donald Trump talking at the World Economic Forum, yes, in front of Klaus Nutschwad. Mr.
[3:34:28.880 --> 3:34:36.640]  not everybody can be a robot polish. Oh, not everybody. Oh, thank you so much. After talking
[3:34:36.640 --> 3:34:41.440]  about some of the positives of his administration and I would actually agree with this. He talks about
[3:34:41.440 --> 3:34:48.080]  energy independence. He talks about more money being in the pocket of regular Americans. That
[3:34:48.080 --> 3:34:55.440]  happened to me. I saw all these things and how people were then buying our energy real competition
[3:34:55.440 --> 3:35:02.480]  with China financially. Then he gets into this about how the controllers and the doomsayers
[3:35:03.040 --> 3:35:07.600]  are doing these things because they just want more power and that is not the way.
[3:35:08.880 --> 3:35:13.280]  I got to think that the vast majority of people sitting watching what we're going to watch about
[3:35:13.280 --> 3:35:19.840]  a minute and a half of this clip were extremely uncomfortable when Trump started ripping this
[3:35:19.840 --> 3:35:26.960]  off. So let's get to the clip. To show strong leadership and restoring growing and better
[3:35:26.960 --> 3:35:34.240]  managing our trees and our forests. This is not a time for pessimism. This is a time for
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:44.320]  optimism. Fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous
[3:35:44.320 --> 3:35:50.640]  hope and joy and optimism and action. But to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must
[3:35:50.640 --> 3:35:59.120]  reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse. They are the heirs
[3:35:59.120 --> 3:36:04.000]  of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers and I have them and you have them and we all have them.
[3:36:05.040 --> 3:36:10.720]  And they want to see us do badly, but we don't let that happen. They predicted an
[3:36:10.720 --> 3:36:19.280]  overpopulation crisis in the 1960s, mass starvation in the 70s and an end of oil in the 1990s.
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:25.520]  These alarmists always demand the same thing, absolute power to dominate, transform and control
[3:36:25.520 --> 3:36:31.680]  every aspect of our lives. We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy, wreck our
[3:36:31.680 --> 3:36:40.240]  country or eradicate our liberty. America will always be the proud, strong and unyielding
[3:36:40.240 --> 3:36:47.200]  bastion of freedom. And I wish that that were the case, but you see how far along we've come
[3:36:47.200 --> 3:36:56.000]  with COVID-1984 and you got to ask the question, is it true? Are we really a bastion of freedom?
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:37:02.640]  Just because we're not quite Australia yet or we're not quite Canada yet, this COVID-1984
[3:37:02.640 --> 3:37:09.680]  nightmare will only end when we say no and no longer acquiesce and only that, but get some kind
[3:37:09.680 --> 3:37:16.400]  of justice by bringing these people to trial because make no mistake about it. This is a bio
[3:37:16.400 --> 3:37:24.000]  weapon. We have covered the fact that DARPA, DARPA, DARPA are behind these shots, DARPA and Moderna,
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:29.840]  again partnering in 2013 to fight pandemics. We'll show you that in a moment with people
[3:37:29.840 --> 3:37:35.120]  like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and AstraZeneca. And by then, mRNA research,
[3:37:35.120 --> 3:37:40.320]  it was only therapeutics. It was drugs. That's because it didn't pass the definition for what a
[3:37:40.320 --> 3:37:47.360]  vaccine was. And of course, it was to fight pandemics with these drugs, including coronaviruses.
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:54.640]  Oh, nothing to see here. And notice that just like Trump said, these perennial doomsayers are
[3:37:54.640 --> 3:38:02.880]  always talking about the climate. Oh, the climate. Well, I want to show you this clip and it is
[3:38:02.880 --> 3:38:08.480]  extremely alarming, but it's something that Alex Jones and I actually covered way back in the day
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:15.840]  in 2009. ABC had put together a piece called Earth 2100, where in the first 10 seconds,
[3:38:15.840 --> 3:38:21.760]  they talk about New York City being under full quarantine. Okay, they talk about pestilence
[3:38:21.760 --> 3:38:27.840]  in the Midwest. That hasn't come true yet. Okay, but we'll see. And then plagues on the West Coast
[3:38:27.840 --> 3:38:33.600]  and all these people in their little masks. Oh, that's nice. And they had cartoons during it and
[3:38:33.600 --> 3:38:39.840]  fake news programs. And Anthony Fauci is in it talking about the natural viruses, right? The
[3:38:39.840 --> 3:38:45.200]  natural viruses that are going to arise from climate change. And they show you the internment
[3:38:45.200 --> 3:38:50.320]  camps and the geoengineering. But I think that this piece of predictive programming you're about
[3:38:50.320 --> 3:38:56.240]  to watch in the first 10 seconds should let you know that these things have been in the works
[3:38:56.240 --> 3:39:04.320]  for many years. In my life, I've seen New York City under full quarantine. The Midwest overrun
[3:39:04.320 --> 3:39:11.120]  devastated by pests. Plague sweep across California. I mean, take a look at that. Oh,
[3:39:11.120 --> 3:39:16.880]  so when the plague sweeps across California in 2009, we know that the paper masks are going
[3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:23.840]  to be what everybody's doing. Oh, the COVID 1984. Yeah, natural bat and pangolin virus.
[3:39:23.840 --> 3:39:33.280]  I'm sure it has nothing to do with this transhumanist agenda that was literally put on paper,
[3:39:33.840 --> 3:39:40.800]  put on paper in 2001, pre 9 11 by a guy named Dennis Bushnell, who's the chief scientist of
[3:39:40.800 --> 3:39:47.760]  NASA today, by the way. And he talked about these evolutionary parts of mankind, the bots,
[3:39:47.760 --> 3:39:54.640]  borgs and humans. Welcome you to 2025 AD. There's DARPA right at the top. Oh, lovely,
[3:39:54.640 --> 3:40:00.480]  lovely indeed. And it tells you right here in 2001, this is all based on existing data
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:07.840]  trends analysis technologies and is not pixie dust, no pixie dust. So when Alex Jones tells you
[3:40:07.840 --> 3:40:13.440]  they're ready to put biological nanotechnology into your food now, they talked about it in this
[3:40:13.440 --> 3:40:20.800]  document. It was here. Okay, it tells you that inputs to new procurement decisions and are there
[3:40:20.800 --> 3:40:27.200]  for 40 years. Okay, it takes about 15 years. So sorry, behind my head, 15 years to produce 40 years
[3:40:27.200 --> 3:40:36.480]  in inventory. All right. And when we get to what era this is, we're in the bio nano era, baby 2020.
[3:40:36.480 --> 3:40:43.920]  He predicted it 19 years ago. Okay. What did people just inject their bodies with bio nano
[3:40:43.920 --> 3:40:51.840]  technology? It's gone on a global scale. And we got about two minutes. So I am going to try to
[3:40:51.840 --> 3:40:58.640]  play this clip very quickly of Dennis Bushnell. Okay, who's this gentleman right here that we're
[3:40:58.640 --> 3:41:03.760]  talking about discussing about sustainability and how your standard of living is actually going to
[3:41:03.760 --> 3:41:07.680]  go down. This is in 2011, 10 years after this document.
[3:41:11.600 --> 3:41:20.480]  We're to sustainability. The crashing of the ecosystem is due to population growth and the
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:28.560]  way we're now living our standard of living. The estimates vary between 30 and 50% of a planet that
[3:41:28.560 --> 3:41:37.840]  were currently short to sustain the standard of living and the current population, much less
[3:41:37.840 --> 3:41:45.040]  the population growth. As the Asians and their billions come up as they are at 9 to 11% growth
[3:41:45.040 --> 3:41:49.600]  rate to Western standards of living, we're going to be short for more planets. And they're not
[3:41:49.600 --> 3:41:56.400]  readily available. This will result in peak everything. This will result in standards of
[3:41:56.400 --> 3:42:02.400]  living pledging. There's a partial solution. And we'll talk about that partial solution
[3:42:03.040 --> 3:42:06.880]  a little bit later, but we're never going to get that technology. Notice the code word is
[3:42:06.880 --> 3:42:12.480]  sustainability. He's telling you there that they have a solution. Ray Kurzweil kind of does the
[3:42:12.480 --> 3:42:17.920]  same thing. We'll see if we get to that clip as well because he dispels this myth of overpopulation.
[3:42:17.920 --> 3:42:25.840]  But the code word is sustainability. Okay, standards of living are dropping. When we get back,
[3:42:25.840 --> 3:42:31.600]  we're going to play Bushnell telling you that automation is coming. There's nothing the robots
[3:42:31.600 --> 3:42:38.560]  can't do. They put 10,000 brain ships and people over a decade ago and much more. I am Jason Burma
[3:42:38.560 --> 3:42:44.560]  sitting in for the fourth hour via Alex Jones. You want to help support info wars.com go to

[3:42:50.960 --> 3:43:02.320]  I don't like coming. I have a question to ask you. Why would you spend your money this Christmas
[3:43:02.320 --> 3:43:08.480]  season to buy gifts for friends and family and loved ones with the establishment with the big
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:15.920]  corporations that are dedicated to waging war on all of our freedoms and suppressing us and forcing
[3:43:15.920 --> 3:43:21.760]  medical tyranny on us? I've never backed down to tyranny. We've had incredible successes fighting
[3:43:21.760 --> 3:43:28.720]  them. Thanks for your support. But now as 2021 comes to a close, I want to encourage you now more

[3:43:59.360 --> 3:44:04.640]  my heart, deep in my soul I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet. I've had a lot of loss
[3:44:04.640 --> 3:44:15.520]  like everybody else has. And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people
[3:44:15.520 --> 3:44:22.160]  fought and died and bled and sweat for. And now we're just throwing it all away.
[3:44:23.920 --> 3:44:28.560]  And I see the general public in a medically induced scientifically induced behavioral
[3:44:28.560 --> 3:44:35.760]  psychologically controlled tranny. And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder and
[3:44:35.760 --> 3:44:43.760]  it's so incredibly sad. But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart
[3:44:43.760 --> 3:44:49.040]  and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again. It's just the globalists
[3:44:49.040 --> 3:44:54.080]  are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually
[3:44:54.080 --> 3:45:01.360]  end the species as we know it. Our 2021 Cyber Week specials end on Monday, December 6th. That

[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:08.480]  and it'll work anywhere in the world where you can see the sky. You can also buy cheap antennas
[3:46:08.480 --> 3:46:13.440]  and things for your car in your house that also are on the site. InfoWarsphone.com, that's just
[3:46:13.440 --> 3:46:17.120]  a site that takes you to these folks. They supply the board for all everybody with their systems as
[3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:23.360]  well. They're amazing folks, and you get a free phone of $600 to $50 value. Absolutely free at
[3:46:23.360 --> 3:46:28.800]  infowarsphone.com. Smartphones are always tracking everything you do. These aren't. And the calls
[3:46:28.800 --> 3:46:35.440]  are free when folks call you. You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes. So the
[3:46:35.440 --> 3:46:39.040]  calls you were free were like a regular cell phone. You're not being tracked or traced. And I keep
[3:46:39.040 --> 3:46:43.040]  one on my car. I've given it to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular
[3:46:43.040 --> 3:47:12.080]  phones don't work. They work. InfoWarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195. Then 20 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[3:47:12.080 --> 3:47:17.600]  We are back. I am Jason Burma sitting in in the fourth hour for Alex Jones. We're talking about
[3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:24.240]  transhumanism. And what you're about to see is one of those doomsayers, right? Because
[3:47:24.240 --> 3:47:30.800]  NASA really isn't about going to the moon and going to Mars. In fact, only 20% of what they
[3:47:30.800 --> 3:47:39.680]  actually do has anything to do with space exploration whatsoever. And in this next clip,
[3:47:39.680 --> 3:47:46.000]  Dennis Bushnell, still the chief scientist of NASA, somebody who's been around since the Apollo days,
[3:47:46.000 --> 3:47:56.400]  by the way, is going to tell you about these exponential growths in the quantum nano bio era.
[3:47:56.400 --> 3:48:02.960]  He's going to tell you about how humans are increasingly becoming obsolete. We don't know
[3:48:02.960 --> 3:48:08.800]  what humans are actually going to be doing in the future. It's not clear, but there are no jobs
[3:48:08.800 --> 3:48:16.080]  the robots can't do. Okay, so let's play this clip. And again, this is the author of that for
[3:48:16.080 --> 3:48:20.720]  future strategic warfare document that just seems to be right on point with everything
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:28.000]  that's happening in the globe right now. Just as an example, we are in a jobless economic recovery.
[3:48:28.000 --> 3:48:34.880]  There's about 7 million jobs missing. Some of them were goal-wise and offshore. The rest of them
[3:48:34.880 --> 3:48:41.040]  goal. The code word is productivity improvement, which is a code word for an ever better
[3:48:41.040 --> 3:48:46.240]  automation and robotization. So let me just stop you right there. You notice all these code words?
[3:48:46.880 --> 3:48:51.600]  By definition, a code word means it actually means something else. It's like a Bernaysian
[3:48:51.600 --> 3:49:00.160]  talking point. Okay, so sustainability, better productivity. That means what automation and
[3:49:00.160 --> 3:49:08.320]  the robotization of the industries around you, less human beings. If you look at the way the
[3:49:08.320 --> 3:49:15.600]  robots are going, human-level machine intelligence from the idea of a brain project is now about
[3:49:15.600 --> 3:49:22.640]  10 to 15 years up. And by the way, this is 10 years ago. Let me repeat that. This is 10 years ago.
[3:49:22.640 --> 3:49:29.680]  By a biomedicine, with a band of section, the neocortex, and they're replicating in silicon,
[3:49:29.680 --> 3:49:36.000]  okay? And they're having great success at all. So this is not soft computing. This is by a biomedicine.
[3:49:38.560 --> 3:49:43.600]  We have looked 20, 30 years out with the white robotics and automation and machine intelligence
[3:49:43.600 --> 3:49:52.400]  is going. And what jobs the machines cannot do? The answer is none. The answer is none. And that may
[3:49:52.400 --> 3:49:58.240]  be hard for people to realize, but he's going to make a joke, again, that makes people uncomfortable,
[3:49:58.240 --> 3:50:02.480]  that we thought we needed them in the nursing homes, but Japan put them in the nursing homes,
[3:50:02.480 --> 3:50:08.080]  and they actually like the robots better. And that's why we're seeing a push for grace,
[3:50:08.080 --> 3:50:14.480]  the robot that will bring telemedicine. Oh, we're going to have robots there. We already used them
[3:50:14.480 --> 3:50:19.520]  for COVID, by the way, the Sophia robot in Australia. Oh, and it's just so awesome.
[3:50:20.640 --> 3:50:24.560]  We thought we need human touch life in the nursing homes for a while with the Japanese
[3:50:24.560 --> 3:50:28.480]  two years ago, but robots in the nursing homes, the patients like them much better than they do.
[3:50:28.480 --> 3:50:38.400]  The machines are creating wealth within the structures of the ecosystem capability. The
[3:50:38.400 --> 3:50:47.920]  machines are reducing costs, okay, producing wealth, but the humans increasingly can't compete.
[3:50:48.640 --> 3:50:57.440]  I have a friend, Steve Thaler, who has developed an imagination machine, okay, which is a neural
[3:50:57.440 --> 3:51:01.680]  net, which he trains in the price of all ration and wind input. And this neural net sits there
[3:51:01.680 --> 3:51:08.240]  in dreams like people dream, producing new ideas, 24, 7, 365 on middle watts, and he has
[3:51:08.240 --> 3:51:14.240]  a credit neural net sitting in the weeds, recording all of these new ideas, and checking them out
[3:51:14.240 --> 3:51:19.520]  for various problems and measures. This thing has produced better toothpaste from Pomolok.
[3:51:19.520 --> 3:51:25.360]  It has produced better warheads for the Air Force, and it produces far more ideas, far faster and
[3:51:25.360 --> 3:51:31.200]  cheaper than buildings full of people. Then buildings full of people, all these people
[3:51:31.920 --> 3:51:40.160]  that don't think that AI is a reality, I got a news flash. Just because it's not real consciousness,
[3:51:40.160 --> 3:51:44.640]  okay, it's not what we are as human beings. I totally believe that we are special,
[3:51:44.640 --> 3:51:50.560]  that we will not be uploading our consciousness, does not mean that the things that he just stated
[3:51:50.560 --> 3:51:57.120]  are indeed not factual, and that this AI will be a separate form of intelligence.
[3:51:58.000 --> 3:52:04.960]  Okay, so along with all of the other jobs, which the machines are, and you know, I've got
[3:52:04.960 --> 3:52:12.560]  charts on this, okay, I have tracked which jobs, which have gone, which ones have come in,
[3:52:12.560 --> 3:52:18.800]  there's a magnificent book on this called Martin, by Martin Ford, is called likes of the tongue.
[3:52:18.800 --> 3:52:25.360]  And if you can sleep well after breathing that clock, okay, then you're not quite as sensitive
[3:52:25.360 --> 3:52:31.680]  as maybe I thought you were. I mean, you know, what people will do all day is not clear.
[3:52:32.400 --> 3:52:36.400]  What people will do all day is not clear, and then the next part, so again,
[3:52:36.400 --> 3:52:41.440]  automation is coming, the robots are coming, this is 10 years old, you look at the document from
[3:52:41.440 --> 3:52:47.360]  2025, we're on that pace, and then he's going to tell you if you don't want to succumb to
[3:52:47.360 --> 3:52:52.720]  transhumanism, aka have the latest brain ship, you're really not going to be able to compete with
[3:52:52.720 --> 3:53:00.800]  the computers. What we're dealing with these, this is only one of the seven, okay, is that the
[3:53:00.800 --> 3:53:07.680]  machines are taking the jobs, and the humans increasingly can't compete. We're also becoming
[3:53:07.680 --> 3:53:15.040]  cyborgs, okay, we have copy employees, artificial retinas, artificial hearts, direct brain,
[3:53:15.040 --> 3:53:19.760]  prosthetic lung, communication, brain ships. We put brain ships into about 10,000 people,
[3:53:19.760 --> 3:53:24.320]  it affects considerably defective brains, doctors working on brain ships or super soldiers,
[3:53:24.320 --> 3:53:28.000]  15, 20 years out, if you don't have a way to chip in, you can't compete, particularly with the
[3:53:28.000 --> 3:53:37.120]  machines. So we are merging with the machines. There's some really massive effects of the IT
[3:53:37.120 --> 3:53:45.520]  biomechanical quantum energetic tech revolutions that are now on a double exponential. A double exponential.
[3:53:45.520 --> 3:53:50.880]  You know, I wanted to play more clips for you. I wanted to play even Elon Musk talking about
[3:53:50.880 --> 3:53:57.280]  how overpopulation is a myth, as well as Ray Kurzweil, the man that is behind things like
[3:53:57.280 --> 3:54:04.000]  the idea of the singularity, and is very much for the merging of human beings with machines
[3:54:04.000 --> 3:54:10.480]  on levels that will no longer allow us to keep our humanity in my opinion. But instead of doing
[3:54:10.480 --> 3:54:16.640]  that, I'm just to encourage you to go check out all of this stuff on your own. You can check out
[3:54:16.640 --> 3:54:22.240]  the future strategic warfare document. You can actually do your own research. It doesn't matter
[3:54:22.240 --> 3:54:27.840]  if the New York Times or the Washington Post tells you that that's a bad thing. As long as you can,
[3:54:27.840 --> 3:54:33.200]  you know, read on a fourth grade level and have some kind of search skills via the internet,
[3:54:33.200 --> 3:54:40.480]  which at this point 99 plus percent of us have, you too can think for yourself. And that is so
[3:54:40.480 --> 3:54:48.320]  important in an era where people are constantly being censored, being canceled, being de-platformed.
[3:54:48.320 --> 3:54:56.160]  And I want to remind everybody out there that Info Wars was at the cusp of that. And many of
[3:54:56.160 --> 3:55:02.480]  you did not step up to the plate and say, hey, whether I agree with Alex Jones is a moot point,
[3:55:02.480 --> 3:55:11.760]  he gets to speak. And it's only because of Info Wars and Alex Jones that I was able to produce
[3:55:11.760 --> 3:55:16.640]  documentaries like Loose Change, Final Cut, Fabled Enemies, Invisible Empire, a New World Order
[3:55:16.640 --> 3:55:22.720]  to Find, which are all free on YouTube, on my platform, Rockfin, which I would encourage you
[3:55:22.720 --> 3:55:28.880]  to go to, as well as Shade the Motion Picture, which Alex is of course featured in. And again,
[3:55:28.880 --> 3:55:38.800]  saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com, because we need outlets that are going to explore
[3:55:38.800 --> 3:55:44.240]  reality. That doesn't mean we're perfect. Jason Bermas isn't perfect. Okay, I get things wrong
[3:55:44.240 --> 3:55:49.200]  all the time. I try to make those things clear. I say, hey, you know what? Got it wrong. I'm a human
[3:55:49.200 --> 3:55:54.160]  being. I'm not a God. I don't claim to be. And hopefully we can move on. We can look at other
[3:55:54.160 --> 3:56:02.560]  information. I also look at information that may be uncomfortable for my current belief paradigm.
[3:56:03.440 --> 3:56:09.120]  There are certain things that come out on these things. Did I want Kevin Spacey to be accused
[3:56:09.120 --> 3:56:16.720]  of sex with children, of playing some 16-year-old in the hotel back in the day and trying to get
[3:56:16.720 --> 3:56:20.720]  him to sleep with him and then Vulture doing an article about another young teenage boy? Of course
[3:56:20.720 --> 3:56:28.480]  not. You know, I like a lot of his work. Did I want Brian Singer to have a ton of evidence
[3:56:28.480 --> 3:56:35.280]  that he was a multiple-time pedophile? Nope, but you know, I watched an open secrets film,
[3:56:35.840 --> 3:56:40.480]  okay, and I saw the documentation and those two worked together on something like the usual
[3:56:40.480 --> 3:56:45.360]  suspects that I still think is a great piece of art, but you think I'm going to go any softer
[3:56:45.360 --> 3:56:52.720]  on Kevin Spacey or Brian Singer or any other Hollywood or government pedophile? No, sir.
[3:56:52.720 --> 3:56:58.400]  I'm not. And neither is InfoWars. And that is so important. So I'm going to implore you
[3:56:58.400 --> 3:57:03.760]  one more time, folks. SaveInfoWars.com is where you can go make a donation,

[3:57:15.840 --> 3:57:24.960]  to see on ABC News, Fox News, MSNBC, CNN. Not going to happen because it's never about left
[3:57:24.960 --> 3:57:30.400]  or right to me. It's always about right and wrong. Now is the time that we all become
[3:57:30.400 --> 3:57:37.200]  the great resistance to this very real New World Order, great reset agenda. Thanks for joining
[3:57:37.200 --> 3:57:43.040]  me and SaveInfoWars.com.
[3:58:07.200 --> 3:58:14.160]  Cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic
[3:58:14.160 --> 3:58:18.880]  effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is
[3:58:18.880 --> 3:58:24.160]  like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes
[3:58:24.160 --> 3:58:27.760]  it's just okay. People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch
[3:58:27.760 --> 3:58:33.200]  isn't as strong? That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes
[3:58:33.200 --> 3:58:38.480]  it's like super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce and a decent crash, then this is it.
