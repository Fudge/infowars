[00:58.080 --> 01:07.840]  into the Pacific there and into the Indian Sea as well we will be breaking all of that
[01:07.840 --> 01:14.360]  down today you know at the start of the show yesterday we had an exclusive hour long interview
[01:14.360 --> 01:21.880]  with the former head of ISI and the general who led the attacks for the CIA against the
[01:21.880 --> 01:29.840]  Russians in that eight-year war in Afghanistan the Afghan-Russian war general Hamid Ghul saying
[01:29.840 --> 01:34.680]  that 9-11's an inside job bin Laden tapes are fake the US government killed Benazir
[01:34.680 --> 01:44.040]  Budo Benazir Budo on and on and on and on and on it was unbelievable hour long interview
[01:44.040 --> 01:49.600]  and if I have time today coming up in the fourth hour I'm going to play some of the
[01:49.600 --> 01:55.960]  key clips some of the most important clips from that interview but we'll also have open
[01:55.960 --> 02:02.800]  phones later in the show and we discussed that obviously everybody wants me to talk
[02:02.800 --> 02:12.640]  about the governor of Illinois and what's happening with him and I will do that when
[02:12.640 --> 02:20.000]  we get back after the break Obama's honeymoon could be tainted by Lagojevich's corruption
[02:20.000 --> 02:27.680]  scandal that's one of the headlines there Lagojevich arrested on corruption charges
[02:27.680 --> 02:33.280]  after going up against Bank of America you know we mentioned this yesterday and Kurt
[02:33.280 --> 02:40.800]  Demos done a story about the fact that you had the governor of New York Spitzer go up
[02:40.800 --> 02:45.280]  against the big brokerage houses that they were involved in crime and derivatives and
[02:45.280 --> 02:50.400]  scams and you notice that the little bit of dirt on him got brought out instantly that
[02:50.400 --> 02:55.840]  the FBI was surveilling him let me give governors a tip every governor in the United States
[02:55.840 --> 03:03.760]  is under constant CIA constant FBI and also foreign intelligence the entire British parliament
[03:03.760 --> 03:12.840]  is under MI6 and MI5 surveillance that's been admitted the entire US Congress is under surveillance
[03:12.840 --> 03:17.840]  and it doesn't matter if you lead a completely spotless life they can try to dig something
[03:17.840 --> 03:27.240]  up on now I don't like Lagojevich he is a vicious anti-gun pimp he is a gangster a mobster
[03:27.240 --> 03:36.720]  a thug a dirt bag a big city Chicago city piece of filth and that's clear from these
[03:36.720 --> 03:42.080]  tapes but this is par for the course that's why the guys on the telephone not carrying
[03:42.080 --> 03:46.640]  cussing sounding like a gangster saying I'm going to effing get a lot of money for this
[03:46.640 --> 03:53.200]  I want bids put in we tell you how Chicago works to have a major media show on TV or
[03:53.200 --> 03:58.520]  radio there you have to make payments to government to have any bar restaurant you make payments
[03:58.520 --> 04:05.320]  to the police it's on record it's admitted for at least 70 years it is the whole state
[04:05.320 --> 04:11.880]  is being run by corrupt mob bosses now the Illinois folks are great people but all that
[04:11.880 --> 04:18.360]  New York corruption 150 years ago moved there and literally founded the modern police department
[04:18.360 --> 04:23.480]  and so I'm not bashing the folks of Illinois we have a lot but four affiliates up there
[04:23.480 --> 04:28.360]  I think the reason we've always had affiliates in Illinois and so many listeners in Illinois
[04:28.360 --> 04:32.280]  is they know about government being corrupt they know the stuff we talk about here is
[04:32.280 --> 04:38.240]  accurate a lot of other dumbbells around the country are living in La La Land but regardless
[04:38.240 --> 04:45.440]  of how bad the government of Illinois is why is he why are they going after him now I mean
[04:45.440 --> 04:49.080]  the governor can engage in any evil they want as long as their new world order why are they
[04:49.080 --> 04:53.920]  going after him well he had shot his mouth off against Bank of America and other big
[04:53.920 --> 05:01.880]  banks shutting down factories in the Chicago area and other areas of Illinois hello friends
[05:01.880 --> 05:05.920]  this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[05:05.920 --> 05:09.920]  and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food and water
[05:09.920 --> 05:13.840]  is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[05:13.840 --> 05:17.800]  never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any
[05:17.800 --> 05:22.400]  emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[05:22.400 --> 05:26.880]  for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones
[05:26.880 --> 05:30.800]  and email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of
[05:30.800 --> 05:35.480]  thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the exploding inflation
[05:35.480 --> 05:39.680]  that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of
[05:39.680 --> 05:44.800]  necessities particularly food beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super
[05:44.800 --> 05:49.200]  inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four
[05:49.200 --> 05:54.000]  billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.560]  end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery
[05:58.560 --> 06:02.800]  stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices
[06:02.800 --> 06:07.560]  to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be ready everything
[06:07.560 --> 06:11.880]  is zeroing in on food one third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying
[06:11.880 --> 06:16.680]  for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get
[06:16.680 --> 06:20.280]  food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you understand that by
[06:20.280 --> 06:24.480]  having a supply of storeable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over
[06:24.480 --> 06:29.600]  you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care
[06:29.600 --> 06:34.000]  of your family in the final equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.360]  ship storeable food that's safe from E. coli salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese

[07:07.880 --> 07:34.960]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[07:34.960 --> 07:42.920]  and what's clearly happening up there in Illinois and we have some other financial news it's
[07:42.920 --> 07:49.560]  very important treasury bills traded negative rates as haven demand surges but that's clearly
[07:49.560 --> 07:58.200]  long term not going to be a haven deal reached in principle on 15 billion dollar auto bailout
[07:58.200 --> 08:06.600]  and the word being used is nationalization taking over the control of the auto companies
[08:06.600 --> 08:12.440]  and then literally forcing all sorts of new environmental regulations and taxes on the
[08:12.440 --> 08:18.040]  people when you hear about Obama's new deal that means federal jobs most of the jobs
[08:18.040 --> 08:22.760]  you will work for a private corporation so it'll be pure fascism private kingpins will
[08:22.760 --> 08:29.200]  get the money then they will hire you at a pittance so that is being rolled out I want
[08:29.200 --> 08:40.040]  to go more over that today and also as you know about a day and a half ago they announced
[08:40.040 --> 08:46.080]  that the tortured patsies they announced Monday evening that the tortured patsies confessed
[08:46.080 --> 08:56.120]  to 9 11 and meanwhile crowd hammer and barns go on fox news and call for indefinite detention
[08:56.120 --> 09:00.640]  of anyone the government wants to say is a terrorist now that's what the military commissions
[09:00.640 --> 09:06.400]  act does it says any US citizen any foreigner anybody in the world can be secretly grabbed
[09:06.400 --> 09:11.520]  my snatch and grab black ops teams they grab you out of your house van pulls up they put
[09:11.520 --> 09:15.880]  a hood over your head throw you in a taser you throw you in a car cattle prod you throw
[09:15.880 --> 09:22.800]  you in a car you're never seen again and it clearly states that any designate of the secretary
[09:22.800 --> 09:29.520]  of defense of the president any of their officers can declare you an enemy combatant and that
[09:29.520 --> 09:35.560]  there is then no due process England first came out and got a 10 day rule and a 30 day
[09:35.560 --> 09:40.680]  rule now they're up to 40 something days where they can secretly grab you they're now grabbing
[09:40.680 --> 09:48.800]  the head of the immigration department under this week ago saying that he had leaked information
[09:48.800 --> 09:53.240]  about the government but he is the government they said well it was national security that
[09:53.240 --> 09:59.080]  the government had secretly legalized hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens his concern
[09:59.080 --> 10:04.800]  was they hired 5000 illegal aliens for high security jobs in secret installations well
[10:04.800 --> 10:08.880]  of course they've got to have foreigners come into England the United States and everywhere
[10:08.880 --> 10:15.760]  else and oppress the people that's a classical form of tyranny the secretary of defense Gates
[10:15.760 --> 10:21.720]  came out last weekend and said we're hiring more foreigners for the military including
[10:21.720 --> 10:28.560]  in high security jobs that's what they're doing and you know they can spend it and say well
[10:28.560 --> 10:36.560]  for linguists and for interpreters and translators but that's a cover for ground troops and the
[10:36.560 --> 10:43.240]  biggest U.S. Army recruiting stations are now in Manila Philippines and Mexico City
[10:43.240 --> 10:47.440]  not in the United States so they've set up huge recruiting centers in the former eastern
[10:47.440 --> 10:55.780]  block in places like Poland and the Czech Republic and Ukraine our military is converting
[10:55.780 --> 11:03.360]  to mercenary forces and foreigners so we will go over Krauthammer and others also report
[11:03.360 --> 11:09.880]  out of Bloomberg regional Fed chiefs say elite insiders have usurped authority federal reserve
[11:09.880 --> 11:16.080]  regional bank presidents describe invocation of war powers by board of governors in Washington
[11:16.080 --> 11:24.240]  so there you have it again seven and a half weeks ago on October 3rd when the congress
[11:24.240 --> 11:29.240]  had refused to pass the bankers martial law takeover bill they were threatened with physical
[11:29.240 --> 11:35.120]  martial law according to senator inhofe and two separate congressmen we interviewed two
[11:35.120 --> 11:39.600]  of the congressmen here and played the clip of inhofe on Oklahoma news radio talking about
[11:39.600 --> 11:48.560]  it the senator physical martial law was threatened physical martial law now Bloomberg is reporting
[11:48.560 --> 12:00.560]  war powers were invoked that is martial law under the 1933 war powers so it is now being
[12:00.560 --> 12:05.960]  invoked it has been invoked it is totally illegitimate you know Hitler could declare
[12:05.960 --> 12:10.200]  himself a dictator it was illegitimate but he had forced to sure force majeure the most
[12:10.200 --> 12:16.240]  powerful force they have guns backing up what they are saying and what they are doing and
[12:16.240 --> 12:20.920]  it takes the people standing up in a unified front and saying this is illegitimate this
[12:20.920 --> 12:26.680]  is fraudulent it takes government unions it takes citizens it takes organizations it
[12:26.680 --> 12:33.360]  takes pastors it takes people standing up and saying no that is why covertly in the
[12:33.360 --> 12:38.480]  past several administrations they have gone out and recruited pastors and prominent people
[12:38.480 --> 12:43.960]  and thousands of top CEOs for infra guard and the FBI remember that came out in mainstream
[12:43.960 --> 12:49.200]  news about ten months ago they were being prepared and the CEOs were giving press interviews
[12:49.200 --> 12:55.800]  saying yes under martial law I am allowed to shoot people and my deputies are now secret
[12:55.800 --> 13:01.080]  FBI agents and we are allowed to shoot people and kill people there is this giant secret
[13:01.080 --> 13:06.640]  army that is no longer secret because as they prepare to use them they have to unveil it
[13:06.640 --> 13:14.800]  in front of everyone so what was it twenty plus thousand we need to do a new report on
[13:14.800 --> 13:20.520]  this breaking it all down twenty plus thousand infra guard CEOs and executives are secretly
[13:20.520 --> 13:27.200]  deputized FBI auxiliary under homeland security preparing for martial law and to quote shoot
[13:27.200 --> 13:33.960]  people to kill we have twenty six thousand preachers secretly trained now publicly admitted
[13:33.960 --> 13:38.720]  to train their flocks to go to FEMA camps turn their guns in take force inoculations
[13:38.720 --> 13:45.640]  we have the threat integration fusion centers built in the late nineties under the government
[13:45.640 --> 13:50.360]  hoax where they hoaxed everybody you know the navy the Pentagon saying that everything
[13:50.360 --> 13:54.640]  would shut down they use that to integrate new federal computer systems put in emergency
[13:54.640 --> 13:59.360]  bunkers in places like building seven in new york they have one right here in austin texas
[13:59.360 --> 14:03.480]  those are really federalization centers they are moving the national guard now federalized
[14:03.480 --> 14:12.200]  under north com under these threat integration centers or fusion centers emergency management
[14:12.200 --> 14:16.640]  centers those are the three names they go under so this is very real this is happening
[14:16.640 --> 14:22.800]  the economy is being imploded by design right now the economy has had all its liquidity
[14:22.800 --> 14:28.920]  and currency and credit cut off while the banks the private intergroup of banks over
[14:28.920 --> 14:38.760]  capitalize themselves to be able to buy up the depressed assets so that is what is currently
[14:38.760 --> 14:42.600]  currently happening right now on that front that's some of the other news that is coming
[14:42.600 --> 14:54.560]  up meanwhile in places like iceland in places like argentina in places like grease the public
[14:54.560 --> 15:01.160]  is rioting in mass taking over police stations taking over the government capital taking
[15:01.160 --> 15:08.280]  over the private same central banks controlling them to control us the Athens airport is shut
[15:08.280 --> 15:14.200]  down they are now into the sixth day going into the sixth day of the establishment losing
[15:14.200 --> 15:24.720]  total control with the police in many cases now standing down or joining the rioters you
[15:24.720 --> 15:28.320]  are going to see more and more of this as the army report said this year as the british
[15:28.320 --> 15:33.960]  ministry report said last year as they implode the economy as they bring us to our knees
[15:33.960 --> 15:40.800]  to try to socialize us and get us under their control again it's fascist on the profit they
[15:40.800 --> 15:48.600]  privatize profit and they make loss public you understand how that works greek fighting
[15:48.600 --> 15:58.000]  the euro zones weakest link starts to crack and this is a article here in the london telegraph
[15:58.000 --> 16:06.600]  by ambrose evans pritchard and he goes on to say because of the european union's tyranny
[16:06.600 --> 16:13.840]  and because it's anti-democratic because it's anti-democratic he says all over europe the
[16:13.840 --> 16:23.320]  people are going to rebel and basically rightfully rebel and he goes through all of this in detail
[16:23.320 --> 16:29.800]  he says without wanting to rehearse all the pros and cons of euro membership yet again
[16:29.800 --> 16:35.360]  or debate the emu is an optional currency area there's obviously a problem for countries
[16:35.360 --> 16:41.800]  like Greece that were let into the emu for political reasons before the countries had
[16:41.800 --> 16:49.080]  been reformed to cope with the euros and the rigors of euro life over the long term and
[16:49.080 --> 16:54.240]  there's an area in here where he talks about that said the riots are roughly what euro
[16:54.240 --> 17:00.520]  skeptics expected to see at some point at the periphery of the euro zone as the slow
[17:00.520 --> 17:06.520]  burn effects excuse the pun of europe's monetary union begin to corrode the democratic legitimacy
[17:06.520 --> 17:15.720]  of governments did you hear that did you hear that and it goes on and on and on and
[17:15.720 --> 17:23.000]  on and on protesters clash with police during athens rally riot police clash demonstrators
[17:23.000 --> 17:28.400]  outside parliament wednesday as the general strike paralyzed greece shutting down schools
[17:28.400 --> 17:33.560]  hospitals international flights and raising pressure on the fragile government reeling
[17:33.560 --> 17:38.960]  from days of riots the lawyers for the two officers accused in the fatal shooting of
[17:38.960 --> 17:44.880]  a teenager that sent off the unrest and ballistic show the fifteen-year-old was killed by ricochet
[17:44.880 --> 17:49.880]  and not shot it directly though witnesses of the police is gunning down one officer has
[17:49.880 --> 17:53.400]  been charged with murder and the other as an accomplice but see they didn't do that at
[17:53.400 --> 18:00.400]  first so the people went crazy and that's what's going to happen here so that's some
[18:00.400 --> 18:06.040]  of the news they're up speaking of psychology and and and people not being able to deal
[18:06.040 --> 18:12.680]  with reality i don't know if this is a person who is just very stupid but the way they wrote
[18:12.680 --> 18:18.040]  their little piece doesn't look like they're stupid or whether these people are operatives
[18:18.040 --> 18:23.040]  we know there are hundreds of thousands of paid disinformation people on message boards
[18:23.040 --> 18:27.920]  on the comment sections of youtube going on info wars i will see the same person the same
[18:27.920 --> 18:34.760]  handle on info wars posting every five minutes for eight and ten hour shifts saying the same
[18:34.760 --> 18:40.480]  thing in every article saying i'm a liar saying i'm a fed saying i'm getting rich saying it
[18:40.480 --> 18:47.680]  isn't true saying it isn't real saying we're lying saying we're spinning and and and and
[18:47.680 --> 18:52.640]  we see these people doing this they'll even start fights with each other but we can check
[18:52.640 --> 18:59.840]  the ip address to start diversions and distractions when we come back i want to go over yes they

[26:23.080 --> 26:24.080]  their spiegel
[26:24.080 --> 26:27.880]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[26:27.880 --> 26:29.720]  in the last month
[26:29.720 --> 26:32.800]  have written articles saying there will be a new financial order a new world

[32:01.760 --> 32:04.760]  the reason we're being attacked all over the internet
[32:04.760 --> 32:07.760]  and a concerted effort is because we are affected so
[32:07.760 --> 32:11.760]  this is very encouraging
[32:11.760 --> 32:15.760]  who's really being attacked is the listeners of this radio show
[32:15.760 --> 32:20.760]  who are activists who are out there spreading video links educating people
[32:20.760 --> 32:23.760]  putting out key information pointing out hypocrisy
[32:23.760 --> 32:26.760]  pointing out corruption
[32:26.760 --> 32:30.760]  I notice that we post stories links to the washington post
[32:30.760 --> 32:36.760]  links to the very defense department directive put out two weeks ago by Gates
[32:36.760 --> 32:39.760]  on the twenty-fourth of November
[32:39.760 --> 32:42.760]  where they say they're abolishing the governor's under federal control

[32:45.760 --> 32:48.760]  they're going to use trips on the streets for civil insurrection
[32:48.760 --> 32:52.760]  for crowd control it's in the army times it's in the air force times
[32:52.760 --> 32:54.760]  it's in CNN
[32:54.760 --> 32:56.760]  CBS
[32:56.760 --> 33:01.760]  and we write articles about it that link to all the stories given people the big picture
[33:01.760 --> 33:05.760]  and they go into the articles and say this is a lie there's no documentation
[33:05.760 --> 33:10.760]  I want to see the links of the document look at these liars there's no links
[33:10.760 --> 33:14.760]  knowing that right above it is all the links
[33:14.760 --> 33:19.760]  knowing that we told people about this twelve years ago ten years ago five years ago a year ago
[33:19.760 --> 33:24.760]  knowing that millions of people heard me on syndicated radio shows
[33:24.760 --> 33:28.760]  interviews I've done my own show stations I'm on
[33:28.760 --> 33:34.760]  reading the news articles we wrote watching the videos I made in ninety-eight ninety-nine
[33:34.760 --> 33:36.760]  two thousand
[33:36.760 --> 33:40.760]  knowing that people are going whoa this guy was really on the ball
[33:40.760 --> 33:45.760]  this guy was paying attention to what the pentagon said they were doing
[33:45.760 --> 33:50.760]  they go into all our stories and say these guys are lying there's no concentration camps
[33:50.760 --> 33:53.760]  there's no FEMA camps
[33:53.760 --> 33:55.760]  give me proof
[33:55.760 --> 34:01.760]  when it's been in the Houston Chronicle and the Associated Press and Newsmax and all over the news
[34:01.760 --> 34:05.760]  that they built FEMA camps all over the country for civil insurrection
[34:05.760 --> 34:09.760]  and they just say it's not true
[34:09.760 --> 34:12.760]  and then you follow their handles back
[34:12.760 --> 34:16.760]  they don't even hide that most of them are in army
[34:16.760 --> 34:21.760]  and we've seen cases where they're on their own MySpace and their Facebook in uniform
[34:21.760 --> 34:24.760]  with a scyop badge
[34:24.760 --> 34:28.760]  a scyop patch on their shoulder
[34:28.760 --> 34:35.760]  they're proud of themselves they have such disdain for you
[34:35.760 --> 34:39.760]  that they are saying
[34:39.760 --> 34:44.760]  that there are no FEMA camps there is no plan for martial law that none of this is true
[34:44.760 --> 34:50.760]  there's no North American Union there's no global government being set up
[34:50.760 --> 34:54.760]  and they'll even leave their handles many times
[34:54.760 --> 34:58.760]  and you go to their YouTube channels you go to their websites
[34:58.760 --> 35:00.760]  and it will be videos
[35:00.760 --> 35:04.760]  we've pointed this out on air of contractors sitting on the side of the highway
[35:04.760 --> 35:09.760]  shooting cars full of Iraqi families and laughing and playing Elvis music
[35:09.760 --> 35:13.760]  we've linked to those videos these are sickos
[35:13.760 --> 35:16.760]  and they post videos about how they want to kill us
[35:16.760 --> 35:20.760]  how they want us to commit suicide and how they're going to kill us
[35:20.760 --> 35:23.760]  everywhere I know you've seen it when you're out there
[35:23.760 --> 35:31.760]  I mean these are sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick people
[35:31.760 --> 35:34.760]  and then after they get everybody hyped up
[35:34.760 --> 35:39.760]  there's weak-minded mentally ill people who then join in on it
[35:39.760 --> 35:44.760]  so that's why I spent a few minutes on that today
[35:44.760 --> 35:50.760]  also I'm going to spend a few more minutes on this and I'm going to get into financial news
[35:50.760 --> 35:56.760]  I don't have time to police things
[35:56.760 --> 36:00.760]  but when you hear me endorse a sponsor or a product it means I believe in it
[36:00.760 --> 36:05.760]  I'm using it I think it's a great deal
[36:05.760 --> 36:10.760]  and Ted tries to police things with the sponsors he takes you
[36:10.760 --> 36:13.760]  I think you've noticed we've gotten better caliber of sponsors
[36:13.760 --> 36:17.760]  and a lot of the sponsors that the network ends up taking separate from me
[36:17.760 --> 36:21.760]  you'll hear on mainstream you know mainstream radio as well
[36:21.760 --> 36:24.760]  but I routinely call Ted up and go look I did some investigation on this
[36:24.760 --> 36:27.760]  and Ted will refund their money and say you're right we're not going to take that
[36:27.760 --> 36:32.760]  a lot of times he catches it himself
[36:32.760 --> 36:38.760]  so we are in this society trying to if something's even questionable not deal with it
[36:38.760 --> 36:46.760]  Ted other networks other people in the quote patriot movement
[36:46.760 --> 36:53.760]  are doing things that I have to morally warned people about
[36:53.760 --> 36:56.760]  you know I've been doing this for 13 years and not just 13 years
[36:56.760 --> 36:59.760]  I've been working and researching probably five six seven hours a day
[36:59.760 --> 37:02.760]  on top of all my broadcasting and other work
[37:02.760 --> 37:06.760]  I mean I stay up every night I get up early every morning
[37:06.760 --> 37:09.760]  we were eating Mexican food last night and I was sitting there with a little laptop
[37:09.760 --> 37:13.760]  reading news articles and in government documents while I was
[37:13.760 --> 37:18.760]  while the guys at the office I took to eat were working
[37:18.760 --> 37:23.760]  well while they were talking I was working a little bit
[37:23.760 --> 37:27.760]  the point is I'm totally obsessed with learning more and knowing what's going on
[37:27.760 --> 37:31.760]  and I'm going to have a series of interviews with attorney Larry Becraft
[37:31.760 --> 37:37.760]  who's beaten the IRS many times about patriot mythology
[37:37.760 --> 37:44.760]  because I am tired of seeing good patriotic Americans hurt by disinformation out there
[37:44.760 --> 37:47.760]  just like I get upset by CPS kidnapping kids
[37:47.760 --> 37:52.760]  or I get upset by the IRS taking people's you know robbing people blind
[37:52.760 --> 37:57.760]  or just like I get upset about people drinking poison melamine GMO foods
[37:57.760 --> 38:02.760]  all the show is about is warning people and getting people active to warn others
[38:02.760 --> 38:05.760]  that's you know warn the tribe warn the species
[38:05.760 --> 38:09.760]  I mean birds do it crows do it they see a predator
[38:09.760 --> 38:14.760]  you know a couple while a couple of the crows are eating one is always on watch
[38:14.760 --> 38:20.760]  I am trying to be a watchman here I am trying to be as moral as I can
[38:20.760 --> 38:24.760]  and that said I don't like fighting with people in our quote movement
[38:24.760 --> 38:29.760]  or the old core of the movement it's now so huge and becoming mainstream
[38:29.760 --> 38:31.760]  that most people won't even know what I'm talking about
[38:31.760 --> 38:37.760]  but as I and my listeners wake up tens of millions of people every year
[38:37.760 --> 38:41.760]  we wake people up to the new world order then they go do more research
[38:41.760 --> 38:44.760]  and fall into pitfalls with things that are dangerous
[38:44.760 --> 38:49.760]  and a few days ago I explained how the malicious sets you up
[38:49.760 --> 38:53.760]  how thousands of people went to prison set up with feds leading malicious
[38:53.760 --> 38:57.760]  where they go we're we're secret let's go hide out let's build pipe bombs
[38:57.760 --> 39:02.760]  let's talk about attacking the police let's sneak around let's you know do all of this
[39:02.760 --> 39:07.760]  those are feds ladies and gentlemen
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.760]  and so we're all in the militia and I say created a hunting club a shooting club
[39:12.760 --> 39:20.760]  a military history club a 1776 club that's why I had the apple seed project on
[39:20.760 --> 39:24.760]  we're mainstream we're out in the open we're the good guys
[39:24.760 --> 39:31.760]  we don't sneak around and do things then you're safe to go out and be active
[39:31.760 --> 39:36.760]  and the feds will try to talk macho and go I don't listen to Alex let's go do some secret stuff
[39:36.760 --> 39:41.760]  well half the people you're working with are feds and they're trying to set you up
[39:41.760 --> 39:45.760]  same thing there I'm gonna do more shows on that because I have a responsibility
[39:45.760 --> 39:50.760]  to not just sit here and wake everybody up and have my listeners wake everybody up
[39:50.760 --> 39:55.760]  you're the real power you're the key to everything and then just turn people loose
[39:55.760 --> 40:00.760]  without warning them about the pitfalls or about the rocks in the harbor
[40:00.760 --> 40:07.760]  I'm trying to put some hazard bullies out here for people
[40:07.760 --> 40:12.760]  now I've been through this hundreds of times every time I try to personally warn somebody
[40:12.760 --> 40:18.760]  once they get into Patriot strawman arguments and filing bonds or telling the IRS that
[40:18.760 --> 40:23.760]  I owe you no money give me all my back taxes back or filing bonds claiming you're taking money
[40:23.760 --> 40:31.760]  out of the private Federal Reserve you get con artists scam artists feds
[40:31.760 --> 40:35.760]  but mainly con artists in this area or mentally ill people who are delusional
[40:35.760 --> 40:39.760]  and really believe what they're pushing and then they get other folks who want to imagine
[40:39.760 --> 40:43.760]  they always call it a new technology has been developed and that this is the silver bullet
[40:43.760 --> 40:52.760]  and everything has been answered and 99% of it is total absolute bull
[40:52.760 --> 40:59.760]  total absolute absolute garbage
[40:59.760 --> 41:02.760]  and it is infecting the common law
[41:02.760 --> 41:07.760]  now just an example of this is last week the New York Daily News
[41:07.760 --> 41:15.760]  in 90 minutes was able to do the entire deed process to falsely stamp that they owned
[41:15.760 --> 41:21.760]  and swear at the courthouse that they owned the Empire States Building worth $2 billion
[41:21.760 --> 41:26.760]  it was deeded to the New York Daily News
[41:26.760 --> 41:32.760]  New York Daily News then wrote an article about it and turned it back over to the rightful owners
[41:32.760 --> 41:36.760]  the point is just because you mail something into the IRS and get money back
[41:36.760 --> 41:42.760]  just because you file a lien on a police officer
[41:42.760 --> 41:46.760]  just because you file something on a judge
[41:46.760 --> 41:52.760]  a lien on them just because something bad happens to them doesn't mean it's legitimate what you did
[41:52.760 --> 41:56.760]  and nine times out of ten you're going to get swat teamed you're going to go to jail
[41:56.760 --> 42:00.760]  and I've seen the smiley face delusional people a million times say that isn't the case
[42:00.760 --> 42:04.760]  and this technology is different and they never give specifics they claim all these cases
[42:04.760 --> 42:08.760]  they never tell you one they won it's always the same MO and I hear it
[42:08.760 --> 42:15.760]  I heard it here locally the last few weeks and I just literally cringe
[42:15.760 --> 42:21.760]  I literally cringe when I'm hearing it because I have seen people go to jail
[42:21.760 --> 42:25.760]  lose their houses I've seen these other patriot groups set up trust
[42:25.760 --> 42:31.760]  and then rip people off and I'm going to do a series
[42:31.760 --> 42:36.760]  for the next few months every week I'm going to spend hours on this
[42:36.760 --> 42:43.760]  giving you specifics and I want all the con artists to know I am coming after you
[42:43.760 --> 42:49.760]  you see just because the mainstream media is lying and spending just because the government's corrupt and bad
[42:49.760 --> 42:54.760]  doesn't then suddenly mean the public is perfect doesn't suddenly mean that
[42:54.760 --> 43:04.760]  no no opportunists come in here and try to do a real just a lot of bad things
[43:04.760 --> 43:09.760]  and it's all bull now are there ways like with George Gordon
[43:09.760 --> 43:16.760]  or Larry B Kraft or Tommy Crier or hundreds of other prominent lawyers
[43:16.760 --> 43:26.760]  and and and and and read Beckman and Bill Benson and all of these people Bob Schultz
[43:26.760 --> 43:30.760]  this is a political issue and they are successfully in court having victories
[43:30.760 --> 43:35.760]  winning getting people off over and over again all over the country
[43:35.760 --> 43:40.760]  they are having successes but they're doing it within the Constitution within the Bill of Rights
[43:40.760 --> 43:44.760]  showing how the government's violating the Bill of Rights Constitution
[43:44.760 --> 43:48.760]  and even their own procedures and regs
[43:48.760 --> 43:54.760]  another guy will tell you about this is Ralph Winterwood I'm going to get him back on
[43:54.760 --> 43:58.760]  he's tried it all he's seen what happens
[43:58.760 --> 44:04.760]  so I'm going to have all the legitimate people on this show who actually can give you cases
[44:04.760 --> 44:10.760]  and success where they've really been able to win
[44:10.760 --> 44:17.760]  rather than delusion because you know people do all these bonds and revoking Federal Reserve bonds
[44:17.760 --> 44:23.760]  all the stuff most of it's made up and even when some of it isn't the government is criminal
[44:23.760 --> 44:28.760]  it doesn't follow any laws and so it does what it wants to do
[44:28.760 --> 44:35.760]  so that's why the main issue is publicly exposing these people in government these institutions
[44:35.760 --> 44:40.760]  is engaging in fraud like yes they make you waive your 10th amendment under duress
[44:40.760 --> 44:46.760]  when you fill out tax forms you're incriminating yourself to a criminal group that changes the rules
[44:46.760 --> 44:50.760]  and does retroactive taxes and engages in all forms of tyranny
[44:50.760 --> 44:54.760]  family courts they're totally corrupt they have brainwash cops working for them
[44:54.760 --> 44:59.760]  judges on the payroll they're making billions of dollars per state stealing children
[44:59.760 --> 45:04.760]  there's bounties on the children's heads there's no due process it's not a real court
[45:04.760 --> 45:09.760]  it's just a judge acting as a Napoleonic dictator
[45:09.760 --> 45:13.760]  you politically expose them you politically discredit them
[45:13.760 --> 45:18.760]  there isn't any magic filing that works in magic patriot land
[45:18.760 --> 45:23.760]  there's only true constitutional legal filings that will beat them
[45:23.760 --> 45:28.760]  or it's best to know their tactics and the first time they visit you disappear for a few months
[45:28.760 --> 45:34.760]  and you move you know I know what works I know what the best course of action is
[45:34.760 --> 45:38.760]  I know what's moral and upstanding and real
[45:38.760 --> 45:44.760]  I know what works I eat drink and sleep this and I've proven we know what we're talking about
[45:44.760 --> 45:49.760]  and I've seen people bushwhacked by all this
[45:49.760 --> 45:53.760]  you take Wesley Snipes getting bad advice
[45:53.760 --> 45:58.760]  and so got off on the major charges but got convicted on smaller ones
[45:58.760 --> 46:02.760]  I'm telling you folks
[46:02.760 --> 46:07.760]  you know if you're not going to pay income taxes and they are fraudulent it does go to the private fellow reserve it is a scam
[46:07.760 --> 46:11.760]  it is we didn't have it until 1913 it should be abolished
[46:11.760 --> 46:15.760]  that should be a political move but they're going to try to replace it with an actual sales tax even worse
[46:15.760 --> 46:17.760]  so be aware of that
[46:17.760 --> 46:20.760]  but it is a political issue
[46:20.760 --> 46:24.760]  now if you're going to try to live humbly
[46:24.760 --> 46:30.760]  and live on a family member's ranch or farm that does pay taxes and property taxes
[46:30.760 --> 46:36.760]  and you want to just work at the local dry cleaner the local hamburger place
[46:36.760 --> 46:41.760]  and you want to live simply and not pay the devil the income tax that's fine and dandy
[46:41.760 --> 46:45.760]  they're just bringing in a world ID and world casual society try to block that
[46:45.760 --> 46:51.760]  and I commend people that do that but that is the only way
[46:51.760 --> 46:58.760]  to stay out of their crosshairs the only way to beat them and it's still not foolproof
[46:58.760 --> 47:03.760]  okay you know I get up here and explain the systems corrupt and a fraud people go oh you coward
[47:03.760 --> 47:07.760]  you should just not pay income taxes
[47:07.760 --> 47:10.760]  well see my mission is about exposing them
[47:10.760 --> 47:17.760]  my mission is about about following all the little rules so that if they do go after me it's total open tyranny
[47:17.760 --> 47:22.760]  you know I watch all these people advisor by not paying income taxes and I watch people go to prison
[47:22.760 --> 47:29.760]  like Mr. Sim Cannon of Arrow Custom Plastics who just didn't make his employees file
[47:29.760 --> 47:32.760]  he said that's your issue I'm paying you if you want to do that that's fine
[47:32.760 --> 47:36.760]  I'm not an indentured servant I don't have to collect money and I totally agree with him
[47:36.760 --> 47:39.760]  but he still went to prison because these are criminals
[47:39.760 --> 47:45.760]  and they want you to fall into the trap they want to shut down big guys
[47:45.760 --> 47:48.760]  I can't have 15 or 20 employees I'm planning to expand
[47:48.760 --> 47:57.760]  I can't have a big office and a TV studio and operate and keep the fight up
[47:57.760 --> 48:02.760]  if I don't pay the taxes of the private fellow reserve
[48:02.760 --> 48:07.760]  I can't build this platform I can't effectively fight them if I choose the one fight
[48:07.760 --> 48:14.760]  of not paying the fraudulent taxes because then that will be my whole world
[48:14.760 --> 48:19.760]  understand how that works you have to choose your battles
[48:19.760 --> 48:23.760]  so if you want to choose that battle I commend you and salute you
[48:23.760 --> 48:26.760]  but just don't fall into all the patriot mythology
[48:26.760 --> 48:30.760]  oh you just file this piece of paper telling them you're a sovereign
[48:30.760 --> 48:38.760]  you send in the bond and tell them to give you back the money
[48:38.760 --> 48:44.760]  and then now they're destroying common law because under common law you have this incredible power
[48:44.760 --> 48:48.760]  to declare yourself and to go make filings and that was honored
[48:48.760 --> 48:51.760]  but with that power you can steal the Empire State Building
[48:51.760 --> 48:55.760]  with that power you can wreck a cop's life and he may even deserve it
[48:55.760 --> 48:57.760]  but the point is it was fraudulent what you did
[48:57.760 --> 49:01.760]  and then that lets the system demonize the common law
[49:01.760 --> 49:05.760]  and start removing it and replacing it with pure administrative
[49:05.760 --> 49:11.760]  so the patriots are out there polluting the common law and misusing it and destroying it
[49:11.760 --> 49:14.760]  and I declare war on you fakes and frauds
[49:14.760 --> 49:40.760]  we'll be right back
[49:40.760 --> 49:44.760]  when you're out driving this holiday season keep in mind you're being watched
[49:44.760 --> 49:48.760]  whether you know it or not red light and speed cameras are everywhere
[49:48.760 --> 49:50.760]  ready to snap a photo of your license plate
[49:50.760 --> 49:55.760]  one simple harmless error could end up costing you over $500
[49:55.760 --> 49:57.760]  quickly putting an end to your holiday cheer
[49:57.760 --> 49:59.760]  fight back with photo blocker
[49:59.760 --> 50:02.760]  simply spray your plate once and you're done
[50:02.760 --> 50:05.760]  any photos of your license plate will appear overexposed
[50:05.760 --> 50:07.760]  making them virtually unreadable
[50:07.760 --> 50:11.760]  see the newscast showing just how photo blocker works against traffic cameras
[50:11.760 --> 50:15.760]  Christmas is here and the economy is in bad enough shape
[50:15.760 --> 50:17.760]  without spending hundreds of dollars in fees
[50:17.760 --> 50:21.760]  that can be avoided with one simple application of photo blocker
[50:21.760 --> 50:23.760]  go to sprayyourplate.com
[50:23.760 --> 50:30.760]  that's sprayyourplate.com or call 1-800-276-9601
[50:30.760 --> 50:34.760]  that's 1-800-276-9601
[50:34.760 --> 50:36.760]  don't give your money to the state
[50:36.760 --> 50:39.760]  spray your plate and when the cameras flash
[50:39.760 --> 50:41.760]  you'll save some cash
[50:41.760 --> 50:44.760]  a day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[50:44.760 --> 50:48.760]  a terrorist act of war against this country
[50:48.760 --> 50:50.760]  the enemies struck America on September 11th
[50:50.760 --> 50:52.760]  but who is the enemy?
[50:52.760 --> 50:53.760]  bin Laden
[50:53.760 --> 50:54.760]  this is his MO
[50:54.760 --> 50:55.760]  we have to look to the Middle East
[50:55.760 --> 50:57.760]  we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[50:57.760 --> 51:00.760]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[51:00.760 --> 51:04.760]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[51:04.760 --> 51:07.760]  some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[51:07.760 --> 51:11.760]  very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[51:11.760 --> 51:15.760]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[51:15.760 --> 51:17.760]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[51:17.760 --> 51:19.760]  the hijackers ties to the FBI
[51:19.760 --> 51:20.760]  the Saudi Arabian connection
[51:20.760 --> 51:22.760]  the Israeli intelligence network
[51:22.760 --> 51:23.760]  warnings in war games
[51:23.760 --> 51:24.760]  the shadow government
[51:24.760 --> 51:25.760]  and much much more

[52:44.760 --> 52:47.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[52:57.760 --> 52:59.760]  we got Connie Fogel the Canadian action party
[52:59.760 --> 53:01.760]  on 30 minutes with us coming up
[53:01.760 --> 53:03.760]  they suspended parliament
[53:03.760 --> 53:05.760]  the Queen of England has again
[53:05.760 --> 53:07.760]  and Canadians are then denial about that
[53:07.760 --> 53:08.760]  it's in Reuters
[53:08.760 --> 53:09.760]  it's in Bloomberg
[53:09.760 --> 53:10.760]  the Queens governor
[53:10.760 --> 53:12.760]  the real head of Canada did this
[53:12.760 --> 53:13.760]  so that's coming up
[53:13.760 --> 53:15.760]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up right now
[53:15.760 --> 53:17.760]  to talk about something sensible
[53:17.760 --> 53:18.760]  something good
[53:18.760 --> 53:21.760]  he bought gold when it was 740 an ounce
[53:21.760 --> 53:24.760]  it is now over 800 and surging today
[53:24.760 --> 53:26.760]  we've told you this is a buying opportunity
[53:26.760 --> 53:28.760]  Ted Anderson the owner of Genesis
[53:28.760 --> 53:29.760]  and Midas Resources
[53:29.760 --> 53:30.760]  all there in the same building
[53:30.760 --> 53:33.760]  has a whole group of gold coins
[53:33.760 --> 53:36.760]  at deals you're not going to find anywhere else
[53:36.760 --> 53:38.760]  and yes ladies and gentlemen
[53:38.760 --> 53:40.760]  they have a limited amount
[53:40.760 --> 53:42.760]  that have been sold out for six months
[53:42.760 --> 53:45.760]  of the buffaloes
[53:45.760 --> 53:47.760]  but first come first serve on those
[53:47.760 --> 53:50.760]  they have plenty of the British sovereigns
[53:50.760 --> 53:51.760]  the Franks
[53:51.760 --> 53:53.760]  and even some American Eagles
[53:53.760 --> 53:56.760]  at the price they were a week ago
[53:56.760 --> 53:58.760]  when Ted bought them when it was 740
[53:58.760 --> 54:01.760]  it is now over 800 and climbing
[54:01.760 --> 54:03.760]  with the economy and freefall
[54:03.760 --> 54:05.760]  things imploding the dollar
[54:05.760 --> 54:06.760]  in trouble
[54:06.760 --> 54:07.760]  world currencies in trouble
[54:07.760 --> 54:08.760]  major re-monetization
[54:08.760 --> 54:11.760]  they're talking about devaluing global currencies
[54:11.760 --> 54:13.760]  coming up in January and February
[54:13.760 --> 54:15.760]  now is the time
[54:15.760 --> 54:16.760]  with all that is happening
[54:16.760 --> 54:18.760]  to convert some of your Federal Reserve notes
[54:18.760 --> 54:19.760]  or stocks
[54:19.760 --> 54:21.760]  into physically held gold and silver
[54:21.760 --> 54:23.760]  Ted Anderson tell us today's offer
[54:23.760 --> 54:25.760]  yeah let me just go over real quick
[54:25.760 --> 54:26.760]  we do have the British sovereign
[54:26.760 --> 54:28.760]  they were bought back when gold was at 740
[54:28.760 --> 54:30.760]  currently right now the British sovereign
[54:30.760 --> 54:32.760]  is at 242
[54:32.760 --> 54:33.760]  we do have Franks
[54:33.760 --> 54:36.760]  at the price of 195
[54:36.760 --> 54:38.760]  I also have a very limited supply
[54:38.760 --> 54:39.760]  of the buffalo coin
[54:39.760 --> 54:41.760]  they're at 1036
[54:41.760 --> 54:42.760]  very popular coin
[54:42.760 --> 54:43.760]  but you can't get them
[54:43.760 --> 54:46.760]  I have some of the $5 modern still available
[54:46.760 --> 54:47.760]  just found out it was sold out
[54:47.760 --> 54:49.760]  on the 10 Indians and 10 Liberties
[54:49.760 --> 54:50.760]  that kind of bummed me out
[54:50.760 --> 54:52.760]  but we do have a good supply
[54:52.760 --> 54:53.760]  of those coins available
[54:53.760 --> 54:56.760]  and it just came to no surprise to me Alex
[54:56.760 --> 54:58.760]  that when they came up with this
[54:58.760 --> 55:00.760]  $15 billion bailout
[55:00.760 --> 55:02.760]  that gold prices would be going up again
[55:02.760 --> 55:04.760]  and here we are sitting here
[55:04.760 --> 55:06.760]  over $800 gold
[55:06.760 --> 55:08.760]  currently right now gold at 81240
[55:08.760 --> 55:11.760]  seeing a high today already of 81370
[55:11.760 --> 55:13.760]  so we're seeing it happen again
[55:13.760 --> 55:15.760]  plus the dollars falling right now
[55:15.760 --> 55:16.760]  and gold is going up
[55:16.760 --> 55:18.760]  that's the way it should naturally occur
[55:18.760 --> 55:20.760]  but with the manipulation that's been going on
[55:20.760 --> 55:21.760]  for the last month
[55:21.760 --> 55:22.760]  the dollar going up
[55:22.760 --> 55:23.760]  gold would go up
[55:23.760 --> 55:24.760]  let's be clear
[55:24.760 --> 55:26.760]  gold is a hedge against inflation
[55:26.760 --> 55:28.760]  a hedge against oppression
[55:28.760 --> 55:30.760]  you know your golden parachute
[55:30.760 --> 55:32.760]  and silver it's great
[55:32.760 --> 55:34.760]  but there is the speculative nature
[55:34.760 --> 55:37.760]  that it could massively explode
[55:37.760 --> 55:39.760]  and many top pundits are saying
[55:39.760 --> 55:40.760]  2000 is easily approachable
[55:40.760 --> 55:42.760]  I'm not saying that's going to happen
[55:42.760 --> 55:44.760]  I'm saying it's going to hold or go up moderately
[55:44.760 --> 55:46.760]  that is a pretty much a sure bet
[55:46.760 --> 55:48.760]  regardless I believe in this
[55:48.760 --> 55:49.760]  this is what I'm doing
[55:49.760 --> 55:51.760]  these are insanely good prices
[55:51.760 --> 55:52.760]  and again
[55:52.760 --> 55:55.760]  Ted has a limited supply
[55:55.760 --> 55:57.760]  of the coveted at a great price
[55:57.760 --> 56:00.760]  the buffaloes
[56:00.760 --> 56:02.760]  so first come first serve on those
[56:02.760 --> 56:04.760]  but how long can you hold this deal
[56:04.760 --> 56:06.760]  on the sovereigns, the francs and the others
[56:06.760 --> 56:09.760]  well I certainly can hold it through the evening tonight
[56:09.760 --> 56:11.760]  and we'll just see what the market will bear tomorrow
[56:11.760 --> 56:13.760]  but yeah indeed gold is going up
[56:13.760 --> 56:15.760]  and my prices will go up too
[56:15.760 --> 56:16.760]  I'll have to pay more
[56:16.760 --> 56:18.760]  800-686-2237
[56:18.760 --> 56:20.760]  here's the number again folks
[56:20.760 --> 56:21.760]  write it down
[56:21.760 --> 56:23.760]  800-686-2237
[56:23.760 --> 56:25.760]  and if you're listening to this on the AM and FM
[56:25.760 --> 56:26.760]  later in the day or the evening
[56:26.760 --> 56:28.760]  or you're listening on the internet in the evening
[56:28.760 --> 56:29.760]  or the podcast
[56:29.760 --> 56:30.760]  call
[56:30.760 --> 56:32.760]  this deal is good through midnight
[56:32.760 --> 56:33.760]  central time
[56:33.760 --> 56:35.760]  the 10th of December 2008
[56:35.760 --> 56:39.760]  800-686-2237
[56:39.760 --> 56:41.760]  that's the number the brokers are there
[56:41.760 --> 56:42.760]  to answer your questions
[56:42.760 --> 56:43.760]  take your order
[56:43.760 --> 56:46.760]  800-686-2237
[56:46.760 --> 56:48.760]  Ted I want to hold you over for another five minutes
[56:48.760 --> 56:50.760]  before we get Connie Fogle on
[56:50.760 --> 56:51.760]  I want to get into treasury bills
[56:51.760 --> 56:53.760]  trade at negative rate
[56:53.760 --> 56:55.760]  as haven demand surges
[56:55.760 --> 56:56.760]  this is the first time ever
[56:56.760 --> 56:59.760]  the treasuries have been at
[56:59.760 --> 57:00.760]  under
[57:00.760 --> 57:02.760]  I mean you're actually paying a premium to get treasuries
[57:02.760 --> 57:04.760]  no yield
[57:04.760 --> 57:07.760]  that's how serious the markets
[57:07.760 --> 57:08.760]  are in
[57:08.760 --> 57:10.760]  I mean that's a very bad shape Ted
[57:10.760 --> 57:12.760]  I want to get your take as a 30 year broker
[57:12.760 --> 57:14.760]  on that
[57:14.760 --> 57:16.760]  hundreds of newspapers going belly up right now
[57:16.760 --> 57:18.760]  or in the process of going belly up
[57:18.760 --> 57:22.760]  stay with us
[57:22.760 --> 57:27.760]  thank you for listening to GCN
[57:27.760 --> 57:31.760]  visit GCNLive.com today
[57:31.760 --> 57:33.760]  may I have everybody's attention please
[57:33.760 --> 57:36.760]  I've come with a message of information
[57:36.760 --> 57:38.760]  9-11 was an inside job
[57:38.760 --> 57:40.760]  do you like being a puppet sir
[57:40.760 --> 57:42.760]  do you like being a puppet for the new world order
[57:42.760 --> 57:43.760]  I'll do the American people know
[57:43.760 --> 57:44.760]  that 9-11 was a stage
[57:44.760 --> 57:46.760]  it was engineered by you
[57:46.760 --> 57:48.760]  David Rockefeller that for a lateral commission
[57:48.760 --> 57:50.760]  to see it for
[57:50.760 --> 57:53.760]  the day that we stop asking questions
[57:53.760 --> 57:55.760]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds
[57:55.760 --> 57:58.760]  of despotism to grow at our own door
[57:58.760 --> 58:00.760]  we can take place
[58:00.760 --> 58:02.760]  an inside job
[58:02.760 --> 58:04.760]  how dare you
[58:04.760 --> 58:08.760]  if you know that there's treason going on
[58:08.760 --> 58:10.760]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself
[58:10.760 --> 58:13.760]  all hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue
[58:13.760 --> 58:16.760]  and if the government has not told the truth
[58:16.760 --> 58:19.760]  in 5 years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life
[58:19.760 --> 58:20.760]  please rise
[58:20.760 --> 58:22.760]  download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now
[58:22.760 --> 58:25.760]  or get the DVD at infowars.com
[58:25.760 --> 58:46.760]  now time to take the revolution to the next level
[58:55.760 --> 58:57.760]  live from Austin Texas
[58:57.760 --> 59:02.760]  Alex Jones
[59:02.760 --> 59:06.760]  beef prices are the lowest wholesale
[59:06.760 --> 59:07.760]  from the ranchers
[59:07.760 --> 59:09.760]  they've been in decades
[59:09.760 --> 59:16.760]  but beef prices are at all time records in the stores
[59:16.760 --> 59:19.760]  in fact wheat and corn and other commodities have plunged
[59:19.760 --> 59:22.760]  but they're still at record prices
[59:22.760 --> 59:23.760]  in the stores
[59:23.760 --> 59:24.760]  this is manipulation
[59:24.760 --> 59:26.760]  there are riots
[59:26.760 --> 59:28.760]  going on continually in Greenland
[59:28.760 --> 59:30.760]  takeover of government buildings
[59:30.760 --> 59:32.760]  Iceland excuse me
[59:32.760 --> 59:34.760]  in Argentina
[59:34.760 --> 59:36.760]  in Greece
[59:36.760 --> 59:38.760]  because of the banking implosion
[59:38.760 --> 59:40.760]  it's been done by design
[59:40.760 --> 59:42.760]  the mainstream media is now saying
[59:42.760 --> 59:44.760]  we're probably going into a depression
[59:44.760 --> 59:46.760]  they're nationalizing the automakers
[59:46.760 --> 59:48.760]  for a paltry sum of 15
[59:48.760 --> 59:50.760]  billion dollars
[59:50.760 --> 59:51.760]  to be precise
[59:51.760 --> 59:53.760]  a little bit over 15 billion
[59:53.760 --> 59:55.760]  and so this is very very serious
[59:55.760 --> 59:57.760]  Ted Anderson
[59:57.760 --> 59:59.760]  you know folks are insane
[59:59.760 --> 1:00:01.760]  if they don't get into gold and silver right now
[1:00:01.760 --> 1:00:03.760]  especially when you've got it
[1:00:03.760 --> 1:00:04.760]  you said it's 813
[1:00:04.760 --> 1:00:05.760]  I mean that's
[1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:08.760]  I mean you bought gold at 740 a week ago
[1:00:08.760 --> 1:00:11.760]  so it's up by 60 and 13
[1:00:11.760 --> 1:00:13.760]  70 something bucks
[1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:16.760]  and you're going to sell out of these coins very very quickly Ted
[1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:18.760]  yeah I mean we're selling out of everything real fast
[1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:20.760]  that's what's been going on in the marketplace
[1:00:20.760 --> 1:00:22.760]  I mean my biggest problem is buying
[1:00:22.760 --> 1:00:24.760]  and usually what I can find
[1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:26.760]  when the prices go down I can buy again
[1:00:26.760 --> 1:00:28.760]  because everybody sort of looks away
[1:00:28.760 --> 1:00:29.760]  when the prices are down
[1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:30.760]  I don't know why they do that
[1:00:30.760 --> 1:00:32.760]  I mean if anybody was smart
[1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:34.760]  they'd be buying like crazy when the prices are down
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:36.760]  and then profiting from that
[1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:37.760]  when the price goes up
[1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:39.760]  but it goes opposite to that
[1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:41.760]  so I just take care of it for you
[1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:43.760]  I mean I just pick up as much as I can
[1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:45.760]  because you know darn well with the economy
[1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:46.760]  doing what it's doing
[1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:49.760]  that gold and silver will not stay down for long
[1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:51.760]  I mean you can't bail out the auto industry
[1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:53.760]  without having financial consequences
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:56.760]  and that's going to affect the US dollar
[1:00:56.760 --> 1:00:58.760]  I mean every time we try to bail out jobs
[1:00:58.760 --> 1:00:59.760]  and create more
[1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:03.760]  that's you know it's just driving down the value of our currency
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:05.760]  they're putting money into the system
[1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:06.760]  they don't have money to do all this
[1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:08.760]  they're turning on the printing process
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:11.760]  well they bailed out some brokerage firms now three times
[1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:13.760]  and that doesn't keep them afloat
[1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:15.760]  15 billion
[1:01:15.760 --> 1:01:18.760]  all three of these companies are having million dollar plus losses every month
[1:01:18.760 --> 1:01:20.760]  this is going to do nothing but bring federal control in
[1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:23.760]  and they're bringing in new contracts for these mortgages
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:25.760]  where people are defaulting on them
[1:01:25.760 --> 1:01:27.760]  and you know that's still more than
[1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:31.760]  it's like 70% of the refixed mortgages
[1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:33.760]  are going into default again
[1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:35.760]  because the people still aren't paying the mortgages
[1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:37.760]  so government bailout doesn't work
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:39.760]  no matter what angle you look from it
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:41.760]  the reason why the US Treasury
[1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:43.760]  there's notes, bills and bonds
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:46.760]  and the Treasury bond is 20 to 30 years out
[1:01:46.760 --> 1:01:50.760]  notes are 15 years less, 10 year notes
[1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:52.760]  that's why they call them notes
[1:01:52.760 --> 1:01:55.760]  and then there's bills and they come to every 30, 60, 90 days
[1:01:55.760 --> 1:01:58.760]  and the reason why the yield is so far down on it
[1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:00.760]  is because everybody's trying to flight to cash
[1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:02.760]  they want to put it in somewhere
[1:02:02.760 --> 1:02:04.760]  they're going to know they're going to get their money out right away
[1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:06.760]  and they don't have to worry about market inflation
[1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:08.760]  well then why would you buy when you have to pay a premium
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:11.760]  to get a Treasury bill for the first time in history
[1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:15.760]  why would you buy that and then have the government physically hold it
[1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:17.760]  and you just pull it out and have physical cash
[1:02:17.760 --> 1:02:19.760]  they're looking for a place to park money for safety
[1:02:19.760 --> 1:02:21.760]  and it's institutional money
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:23.760]  they have to put it somewhere
[1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:25.760]  and US Treasury is just happy to do it
[1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:27.760]  well we have the Congress talking about rating pension funds
[1:02:27.760 --> 1:02:29.760]  and taxing them
[1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:31.760]  so hold on to your wallets folks
[1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:33.760]  you need to get physical gold and silver
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:35.760]  Ted has gold at 60 plus dollars
[1:02:35.760 --> 1:02:37.760]  under what it currently is
[1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:39.760]  800-686-2237
[1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:41.760]  fire out that list of coins again
[1:02:41.760 --> 1:02:43.760]  yeah right now the British sovereign
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:45.760]  242 francs are at 195
[1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:47.760]  I still have the silver sovers up a buck
[1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:49.760]  and I do have the walking liberty halves
[1:02:49.760 --> 1:02:51.760]  currently right there at 840
[1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:53.760]  I also have some of the $5 moderns
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:55.760]  and those slabbed holders
[1:02:55.760 --> 1:02:57.760]  they're at 384
[1:02:57.760 --> 1:02:59.760]  I have the Buffalo coin
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:01.760]  that's at 1036
[1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:03.760]  I also have many other coins like you said
[1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:05.760]  we have some US seagulls that have become available
[1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:07.760]  you can ask about those
[1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:09.760]  I mean there's a lot of things that I'm accumulating
[1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:11.760]  because I can see the market bouncing and dipping
[1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:13.760]  and when it happens I'm buying
[1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:15.760]  and I'm gonna buy it
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:17.760]  but explain to people you gotta tell them it's the radio special
[1:03:17.760 --> 1:03:19.760]  with Alex Jones to get those prices
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:21.760]  they'll be paying today's prices
[1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:23.760]  not a week ago's prices
[1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:25.760]  800-686-2237
[1:03:25.760 --> 1:03:27.760]  Ted thanks for coming on with us
[1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:29.760]  yeah thanks for having me up again
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:31.760]  you bet here's the number again if you missed it
[1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:33.760]  800-686-2237
[1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:35.760]  we'll be right back with Connie Vogel
[1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:37.760]  in the Canadian Action Party
[1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:39.760]  Hello friends this is Alex Jones
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:41.760]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:43.760]  and today that's more important than ever
[1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:45.760]  we need to be independent
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:47.760]  and food and water is the key
[1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:49.760]  you'll never have to stand in a bread line
[1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:51.760]  if you have your own bread
[1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:53.760]  you'll never have to go to the Superdome
[1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:55.760]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[1:03:55.760 --> 1:03:57.760]  in any emergency if you simply prepare
[1:03:57.760 --> 1:03:59.760]  our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:01.760]  with a special interest
[1:04:01.760 --> 1:04:03.760]  so they ignored your screams not to do it
[1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:05.760]  they turned off the telephones and emailed
[1:04:05.760 --> 1:04:07.760]  they voted to print $850 billion
[1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:09.760]  at least out of thin air
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:11.760]  this money now owns the American and European banks
[1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:13.760]  the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:15.760]  will slash your life savings to nothing
[1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:17.760]  and blast the cost of assassins
[1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:19.760]  particularly food
[1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:21.760]  beyond many Americans reach
[1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:23.760]  in pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:25.760]  the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:27.760]  until it reached over 4 billion marks
[1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:29.760]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast
[1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:31.760]  there seems as if there may be no end in sight
[1:04:31.760 --> 1:04:33.760]  the private banks
[1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:35.760]  merging with our government
[1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:37.760]  we don't own grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves
[1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:39.760]  the stores have less food
[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:41.760]  but jack of the prices to stay in business
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:43.760]  whatever happens in America
[1:04:43.760 --> 1:04:45.760]  we need to be prepared and be ready
[1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:47.760]  everything is zeroing in on food
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:49.760]  one third of Americans have to choose between buying food
[1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:51.760]  and paying for other necessities
[1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:53.760]  my friends, whatever it takes
[1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:55.760]  get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food
[1:04:55.760 --> 1:04:57.760]  for everybody out there listening
[1:04:57.760 --> 1:04:59.760]  it's very important for you to understand that
[1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:01.760]  by having a supply of storable food
[1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:03.760]  the government, the new old order has a lot less control over you
[1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:05.760]  the mindset of self-sufficiency
[1:05:05.760 --> 1:05:07.760]  and preparedness
[1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:09.760]  no one is going to take care of your family
[1:05:09.760 --> 1:05:11.760]  in the final equation but you
[1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:13.760]  you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship
[1:05:13.760 --> 1:05:15.760]  storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella
[1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:17.760]  genetic alteration or Chinese imports
[1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:19.760]  and they do it at almost half the cost
[1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:21.760]  of last year's grocery prices
[1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:23.760]  call 1-800-409-5633
[1:05:23.760 --> 1:05:25.760]  or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:27.760]  visit eFoodsDirect.com
[1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:29.760]  and look over the final list of high quality
[1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.760]  freeze-dried and dehydrated foods they have to offer
[1:05:31.760 --> 1:05:33.760]  for free videos
[1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:35.760]  look at their online catalog
[1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:37.760]  or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633
[1:05:37.760 --> 1:05:39.760]  again 800-409-5633
[1:05:39.760 --> 1:05:41.760]  or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com
[1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:43.760]  take action today
[1:05:43.760 --> 1:06:11.760]  the first step is getting storable food
[1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:13.760]  and the public is rioting
[1:06:13.760 --> 1:06:15.760]  and defeating them
[1:06:15.760 --> 1:06:17.760]  from Iceland to Greece
[1:06:19.760 --> 1:06:21.760]  but it's too late the bankers
[1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:23.760]  have already looted the country's drive
[1:06:23.760 --> 1:06:25.760]  the Financial Times of London as you know
[1:06:25.760 --> 1:06:27.760]  reported two days ago
[1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:29.760]  and now for a world government
[1:06:29.760 --> 1:06:31.760]  was the headline admitting that it is
[1:06:31.760 --> 1:06:33.760]  a tyrannical world government for your own good
[1:06:33.760 --> 1:06:35.760]  there's also an article
[1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:37.760]  out of the London Telegraph today
[1:06:37.760 --> 1:06:39.760]  by Mr. Pritchard
[1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:41.760]  admitting that people are rioting
[1:06:41.760 --> 1:06:43.760]  because the New World Order is tyrannical
[1:06:45.760 --> 1:06:47.760]  and we see the same tyranny in Canada
[1:06:47.760 --> 1:06:49.760]  you have the Parliament
[1:06:51.760 --> 1:06:53.760]  you have Mr. Harpers
[1:06:53.760 --> 1:06:55.760]  even Harper
[1:06:55.760 --> 1:06:57.760]  the Prime Minister losing seats
[1:06:57.760 --> 1:06:59.760]  he should leave
[1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:01.760]  they moved to kick him out
[1:07:01.760 --> 1:07:03.760]  and so he goes to the
[1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:05.760]  Governor General
[1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:07.760]  of the Queen the True Power
[1:07:07.760 --> 1:07:09.760]  in a commonwealth
[1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:11.760]  now the people are the real power
[1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:13.760]  and if they knew things were really being run by the Crown
[1:07:13.760 --> 1:07:15.760]  they would know how illegitimate
[1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:17.760]  was and stop it
[1:07:17.760 --> 1:07:19.760]  that's why the Crowns never wanted to use this power
[1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:21.760]  though they've used it in Australia back in the 70s
[1:07:21.760 --> 1:07:23.760]  was the last time we've seen this in a major
[1:07:23.760 --> 1:07:25.760]  commonwealth
[1:07:25.760 --> 1:07:27.760]  Canadian Prime Minister wins Suspension to Parliament
[1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:29.760]  this is from last Friday
[1:07:29.760 --> 1:07:31.760]  December 4th
[1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:33.760]  now they've done it again
[1:07:33.760 --> 1:07:35.760]  and I wanted to re-read this for you to Connie Fogel
[1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:37.760]  rare suspension to Parliament
[1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:39.760]  last Thursday managing to avoid being ousted
[1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:41.760]  by opposition parties angry over the minority
[1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:43.760]  conservative government's economic plans
[1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:45.760]  and an attempt to cut off party financing
[1:07:45.760 --> 1:07:47.760]  Governor General
[1:07:47.760 --> 1:07:49.760]  Michelle
[1:07:49.760 --> 1:07:51.760]  John
[1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:53.760]  the representative of Queen Elizabeth
[1:07:53.760 --> 1:07:55.760]  Canada's head of state
[1:07:55.760 --> 1:07:57.760]  agreed to Harper's request to shut down Parliament
[1:07:57.760 --> 1:07:59.760]  until January 26th
[1:07:59.760 --> 1:08:01.760]  Parliament was reconvened just weeks ago
[1:08:01.760 --> 1:08:03.760]  after the October 14th election
[1:08:03.760 --> 1:08:05.760]  this request for the suspension was unprecedented
[1:08:05.760 --> 1:08:07.760]  no Prime Minister had asked for Parliament to suspend
[1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:09.760]  to avoid a confidence vote
[1:08:09.760 --> 1:08:11.760]  in the House of Commons
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:13.760]  now when we posted just the top couple paragraphs
[1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:15.760]  and linked to this last week
[1:08:15.760 --> 1:08:17.760]  people went into infowars.com
[1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:19.760]  presentplanet.com
[1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:21.760]  and they just said Alex Jones is a liar
[1:08:21.760 --> 1:08:23.760]  the Queen doesn't run anything
[1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:25.760]  the Parliament runs everything
[1:08:25.760 --> 1:08:27.760]  this is a lie
[1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:29.760]  that's delusional thinking
[1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:31.760]  just like we posted the article
[1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:33.760]  and now for a global government
[1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:35.760]  people went into the comments and said it's not real
[1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:37.760]  that article doesn't exist direct link
[1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:39.760]  to the Financial Times of London
[1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:41.760]  saying role government's real
[1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:43.760]  saying it's tyrannical and saying it's a good idea
[1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:47.760]  I mean this is mental illness ladies and gentlemen
[1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:49.760]  or these are disinfo operatives
[1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:51.760]  of course Connie Fogel and the Canadian Action Party
[1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:53.760]  have caught police dressing up
[1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:55.760]  as anarchists and attacking other police
[1:08:55.760 --> 1:08:57.760]  that made national news earlier this year
[1:08:57.760 --> 1:08:59.760]  they've got out a new article
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:01.760]  by Minister of Suspense Parliament again
[1:09:01.760 --> 1:09:03.760]  and just to let you know
[1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:05.760]  who Connie Fogel is
[1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:07.760]  she's a great lady
[1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:09.760]  as a former leader of the Canadian Action Party
[1:09:09.760 --> 1:09:11.760]  a lawyer and former teacher
[1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:13.760]  Fogel lives in Vancouver British Columbia
[1:09:13.760 --> 1:09:15.760]  where her late husband Harry Rankin
[1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:17.760]  was a long time progressive city councillor
[1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:19.760]  she's an anti-globalization activist
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:21.760]  and was an opponent
[1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:23.760]  of the multi
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:25.760]  trilateral agreement
[1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:27.760]  on investment for the North American Free Trade Agreement
[1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:29.760]  she has also been active
[1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:31.760]  with the Canadian Liberty Committee
[1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:33.760]  and it goes on and on
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:35.760]  but Connie good to have you on with us
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:37.760]  appreciate you joining us
[1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:39.760]  well thank you very much for including me
[1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:41.760]  your show is very popular and I'm very pleased to be part of it today
[1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:43.760]  we're pleased to have you here
[1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:45.760]  why are Canadians and Americans
[1:09:45.760 --> 1:09:47.760]  in denial about this and what's really happening
[1:09:47.760 --> 1:09:49.760]  well denial is the word
[1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:51.760]  I was thinking as you were talking
[1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:53.760]  people just
[1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:55.760]  I guess maybe it's human nature
[1:09:55.760 --> 1:09:57.760]  to be so bad they just don't want to accept it
[1:09:57.760 --> 1:09:59.760]  that's the way it is and it's easier to be
[1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:01.760]  to deny than to face something
[1:10:01.760 --> 1:10:03.760]  because facing takes a lot of courage
[1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:05.760]  and it also means adjusting yourself
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:07.760]  it also means taking on courage
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:09.760]  it also means maybe having to take a tough stand
[1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:11.760]  and really having to fight somewhere
[1:10:11.760 --> 1:10:13.760]  facing that you really live in a puppet dictatorship
[1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:15.760]  under an imperial governor
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:17.760]  and that the queen really runs things
[1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:19.760]  and that you're still under a queen's heart to deal with
[1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:21.760]  yeah that's right people don't want to face that
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:23.760]  and the reality of just exactly what's happened
[1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:25.760]  is pretty shocking and it goes even worse
[1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:27.760]  because what's just
[1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:29.760]  happened now is that
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:31.760]  the Liberals have changed their leadership
[1:10:31.760 --> 1:10:33.760]  just instantly there was going to be a leadership change
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:35.760]  come May
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:37.760]  but they got rid of Dion
[1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:39.760]  who was the person that was supportive of the cooperation
[1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:41.760]  and the coalition to
[1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:43.760]  get rid of the Harper minority
[1:10:43.760 --> 1:10:45.760]  government
[1:10:45.760 --> 1:10:47.760]  now they put Ignatius in
[1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:49.760]  who is a globalist
[1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:51.760]  he's probably a Harperite as well
[1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:53.760]  they can't sit down the two of them
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:55.760]  and there probably won't be a coalition to defeat
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:10:57.760]  the Harper government
[1:10:57.760 --> 1:10:59.760]  that is to move the minority opposition forces in power
[1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:01.760]  it's very interesting when you have these minority governments
[1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:03.760]  they can be quite democratic
[1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:05.760]  but what we see happening here
[1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:07.760]  is that the people that are in the elected positions
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:09.760]  they've got to the point where they're so greedy
[1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:11.760]  they're so arrogant
[1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:13.760]  they just have such an abuse
[1:11:13.760 --> 1:11:15.760]  of the people's wish
[1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:17.760]  that they just go along
[1:11:17.760 --> 1:11:19.760]  and do what they can manage to do
[1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:21.760]  and that's what we see here in the Liberal Party
[1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:23.760]  they've put a leader in without going to their own membership
[1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:25.760]  let's stop there and explain how this works
[1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:27.760]  what happens is
[1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:29.760]  once nations start going down into corruption
[1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:31.760]  there's then a snatching and grabbing phase
[1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:33.760]  where they know everything's imploding
[1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:35.760]  so they're just stealing everything that's not nailed down
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:37.760]  including the kitchen sink
[1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:39.760]  and so because it revealed
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:41.760]  that the Queen really runs things
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:43.760]  that the Governor General really runs things
[1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:45.760]  they have to go in now and take over
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:47.760]  the Liberals that were
[1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:49.760]  trying to rightfully take control of the government
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:51.760]  so they're having to go in now
[1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:53.760]  and take those guys over
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:55.760]  to then create the illusion
[1:11:55.760 --> 1:11:57.760]  that the power structure has been defeated
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:11:59.760]  yeah, but of course
[1:11:59.760 --> 1:12:01.760]  what it is is all complicity with the power structure
[1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:03.760]  and it's
[1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:05.760]  it's really disgusting
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:07.760]  and disgraceful. Unfortunately in Canada
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:09.760]  the Canadians are
[1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:11.760]  so much more
[1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:13.760]  Canadians
[1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:15.760]  are slow to really
[1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:17.760]  take action and to fight
[1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:19.760]  like
[1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:21.760]  contrary to the people in the States
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:23.760]  I mean with a lot of respect for the citizens of the United States
[1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:25.760]  maybe you'll complain about them I know
[1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:27.760]  but on the other hand you've got stuff written right in
[1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:29.760]  your constitution that's very strong
[1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:31.760]  and you've got groups, organizations in the United States
[1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:33.760]  and you're an example of the power
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:35.760]  in the United States of the people where you really are
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:37.760]  doing some powerfully good stuff
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:39.760]  in terms of resistance. We don't have
[1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:41.760]  that kind of strength happening
[1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:43.760]  the little tiny voice of the Canadian Action Party
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:45.760]  and so
[1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:47.760]  I'm really worried
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:49.760]  I'm really worried about what's going to happen
[1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:51.760]  the last article you talked about
[1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:53.760]  of the global
[1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:55.760]  one world order being in place
[1:12:55.760 --> 1:12:57.760]  that's true, it's funny how you talk about these people
[1:12:57.760 --> 1:12:59.760]  writing and saying this isn't happening
[1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:01.760]  what's truly frightening is that enough
[1:13:01.760 --> 1:13:03.760]  people don't understand the implications
[1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:05.760]  and the really big thing that scares me and do I want to jump into this
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:07.760]  or ask you about this is the whole
[1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:09.760]  depopulation thing that seems to be on the agenda
[1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:11.760]  as well. No that's it, I mean they're openly saying
[1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:13.760]  in the
[1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:15.760]  financial times of London and hundreds of other papers
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:17.760]  yes it's a world government
[1:13:17.760 --> 1:13:19.760]  yes we are going to
[1:13:19.760 --> 1:13:21.760]  come after your liberties
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:23.760]  yes we're anti-democratic
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:25.760]  and then the public is so
[1:13:25.760 --> 1:13:27.760]  mind controlled
[1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:29.760]  that they were previously told it didn't exist
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:31.760]  so they say no, no, no
[1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:33.760]  you do not have a link
[1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:35.760]  on your website to the financial times
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:37.760]  you are a liar
[1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:39.760]  I mean you talk about willful delusion
[1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:41.760]  I know
[1:13:41.760 --> 1:13:43.760]  but you know
[1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:45.760]  at one level you can't blame
[1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:47.760]  human beings for wanting things to be nice
[1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:49.760]  on the other thing it's a really
[1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:51.760]  wonderful
[1:13:51.760 --> 1:13:53.760]  reality that there are people like you and like me
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:55.760]  who will speak out and we are
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:57.760]  we are way out in front of the other people in terms of following
[1:13:57.760 --> 1:13:59.760]  what's going on, annoying and seeing what's really going on
[1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:01.760]  and that scares people, I mean I've had people
[1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:03.760]  tell me I don't want to hear that
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:05.760]  you're scaring me go away leave me alone
[1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:07.760]  well that should be
[1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:09.760]  scared of not doing anything and the bad guy is winning
[1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:11.760]  I don't think they know what a world government means
[1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:13.760]  no they don't
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:15.760]  but the important thing is
[1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:17.760]  is that you continue to talk
[1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:19.760]  I continue to talk and eventually I've had people come to me
[1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:21.760]  and say like a year later or two years later
[1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:23.760]  after something they said when you said such and such
[1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:25.760]  at that time I didn't agree with you
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:27.760]  and I didn't vote for you and I'm so embarrassed and so ashamed
[1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:29.760]  and I want to apologize now
[1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:31.760]  I mean they do learn, they do grow
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:33.760]  and that's the importance and the value of the work
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:35.760]  that you're doing
[1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:37.760]  at that point where they're just removing
[1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:39.760]  the velvet glove off the iron fist
[1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:41.760]  worldwide and saying okay it's tyranny
[1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:43.760]  and we run things and you don't
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:45.760]  yeah but you know it's just
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:47.760]  like you said in that video I've seen
[1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:49.760]  where you stand up and you say
[1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:51.760]  you don't own the world, you don't think we're not going to let you
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:53.760]  and that has to continue
[1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:55.760]  what have Canadians said and then of course plug the websites
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:14:57.760]  so Canadians can join you
[1:14:57.760 --> 1:14:59.760]  and fight back and really you are one of the only
[1:14:59.760 --> 1:15:01.760]  mainline groups that's eloquently fighting
[1:15:01.760 --> 1:15:03.760]  what did they say
[1:15:03.760 --> 1:15:05.760]  maybe six months ago when it was all over Canadian papers
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:07.760]  that yes US troops will be used
[1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:09.760]  here, yes we will police the Americans
[1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:11.760]  yes we're in a North American
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:13.760]  system, yes Northcom
[1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:15.760]  is basically running Canada
[1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:17.760]  I mean that was in the major papers
[1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:19.760]  still denial it's made
[1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:21.760]  the major papers but in small sections
[1:15:21.760 --> 1:15:23.760]  and you've got to remember probably it's the fact
[1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:25.760]  that most people don't read
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:27.760]  papers of all anymore
[1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:29.760]  and it's just a major denial
[1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:31.760]  and if it did happen they didn't kind of
[1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:33.760]  matter what the problem you know
[1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:35.760]  they don't see it and I think most people still
[1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:37.760]  do not know what we're talking about
[1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:39.760]  they don't, this business
[1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:41.760]  of the military of each country going into
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:43.760]  the other it's really worrisome in terms of what
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:45.760]  might be shaping up right away and it's
[1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:47.760]  to happen in January
[1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:49.760]  so the crunch is there and
[1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:51.760]  gosh you know you hate to be
[1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:53.760]  the bad guy that deliver
[1:15:53.760 --> 1:15:55.760]  bad news all the time but on the other hand
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:15:57.760]  I keep going back to the point that it's important
[1:15:57.760 --> 1:15:59.760]  it's important that people must not be
[1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:01.760]  afraid and they must realize that the only thing
[1:16:01.760 --> 1:16:03.760]  that's going to make any difference for their lives
[1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:05.760]  is for their own courage to take hold
[1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:07.760]  What are mainline Canadians saying about
[1:16:07.760 --> 1:16:09.760]  the Queen openly ruling?
[1:16:09.760 --> 1:16:11.760]  Nothing, most Canadians
[1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:13.760]  I mean they like the parliamentary system that we have
[1:16:13.760 --> 1:16:15.760]  there are many who don't, there's groups
[1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:17.760]  that don't, large numbers who don't but
[1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:19.760]  the idea of having the Queen in there as
[1:16:19.760 --> 1:16:21.760]  the final voice in our things has been
[1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:23.760]  something that's been part of our system forever
[1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:25.760]  and nobody's, there's not a
[1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:27.760]  significant force moving to
[1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:29.760]  that because she's basically been a
[1:16:29.760 --> 1:16:31.760]  figurehead but when you see something like
[1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:33.760]  this happening which again
[1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:35.760]  most people won't understand it's significant
[1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:37.760]  you've hit the nail on the head and especially when you go back
[1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:39.760]  to the one world order and the power
[1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:41.760]  of the Queen of England in that one world order thing
[1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:43.760]  it's pretty significant
[1:16:43.760 --> 1:16:45.760]  and most people don't have a clue
[1:16:45.760 --> 1:16:47.760]  Well it's not a figurehead because she only
[1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:49.760]  shows her power when she has to
[1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:51.760]  Absolutely, that's right
[1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:53.760]  I mean hey I don't care what your parliament says
[1:16:53.760 --> 1:16:55.760]  I'm in charge
[1:16:55.760 --> 1:16:57.760]  My governor is in charge
[1:16:57.760 --> 1:16:59.760]  Well only under certain
[1:16:59.760 --> 1:17:01.760]  critical conditions like we've just seen
[1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:03.760]  but that's the point, the point of the critical conditions
[1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:05.760]  is the very time of importance isn't it
[1:17:05.760 --> 1:17:07.760]  Bloomberg's reporting
[1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:09.760]  that the Federal Reserve is under
[1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:11.760]  war powers under martial law, that's in Bloomberg
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:13.760]  My God
[1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:15.760]  Oh yeah they're just
[1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:17.760]  I mean they're announcing they're going to have regular army
[1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:19.760]  brigades on the streets of America
[1:17:19.760 --> 1:17:21.760]  It's just incredible, Connie Fogel
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:23.760]  I want to get you back up for a full hour in the near future
[1:17:23.760 --> 1:17:25.760]  We've got one little segment left
[1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:27.760]  when we come back, give out the Canadian
[1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:29.760]  action party website

[1:17:31.760 --> 1:17:33.760]  some of the fights where this take over
[1:17:33.760 --> 1:17:35.760]  by the Queen of Parliament
[1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:37.760]  is going
[1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:39.760]  and I guess the next thing is they'll just deny the Queen even exists
[1:17:39.760 --> 1:17:41.760]  but the Queen Elizabeth II
[1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:43.760]  does exist, she is real
[1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:53.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.

[1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:05.760]  website tell us where this parliament
[1:22:05.760 --> 1:22:07.760]  situation with the king the queen openly
[1:22:07.760 --> 1:22:09.760]  ruling
[1:22:09.760 --> 1:22:11.760]  Canadian action party website
[1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:15.760]  is www.canadianactionparty.ca
[1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:17.760]  it's an interesting situation
[1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:19.760]  happening in Canada for everybody
[1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:21.760]  to watch as we see
[1:22:21.760 --> 1:22:23.760]  the state of our parliament
[1:22:23.760 --> 1:22:25.760]  now being such that it's really not
[1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:27.760]  representing the people at all
[1:22:27.760 --> 1:22:29.760]  I'm worried very much about the military
[1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:31.760]  move back and forth between the two countries
[1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:33.760]  I just got a notice there are some military
[1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:35.760]  in Canada our own military are on our
[1:22:35.760 --> 1:22:37.760]  streets in some places but we never have
[1:22:37.760 --> 1:22:39.760]  seen that before
[1:22:39.760 --> 1:22:41.760]  many articles from coming from the states talking about
[1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:43.760]  the military being in the streets in the United States
[1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:45.760]  so I think
[1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:47.760]  the disarray in our parliament is
[1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:49.760]  perfect for
[1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:51.760]  another major something happening
[1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:53.760]  to be able to really get into the emergency
[1:22:53.760 --> 1:22:55.760]  measures kinds of action
[1:22:55.760 --> 1:22:57.760]  that have been put in place
[1:22:57.760 --> 1:22:59.760]  under the security and prosperity partnership
[1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:01.760]  agreement between Canada the United States and Mexico
[1:23:01.760 --> 1:23:03.760]  and a false flag terrible something happening
[1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:05.760]  in the United States probably at the time of
[1:23:05.760 --> 1:23:07.760]  Obama's inauguration a lot of warnings
[1:23:07.760 --> 1:23:09.760]  about that so people have to be alert
[1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:11.760]  people have to be on guard and the last thing I want to say
[1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:13.760]  is in relation to an ad that you just had
[1:23:13.760 --> 1:23:15.760]  on there the health movement the alternative health
[1:23:15.760 --> 1:23:17.760]  movement the supplements are so necessary for
[1:23:17.760 --> 1:23:19.760]  us to fight against
[1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:21.760]  the impact on us of
[1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:23.760]  the attacks on us actually say in the chem
[1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:25.760]  trails and all sorts of things that are used to
[1:23:25.760 --> 1:23:27.760]  demobilize us and to make it impossible for us
[1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:29.760]  to be strong to be able to resist what's going
[1:23:29.760 --> 1:23:31.760]  to happen with coming down the pike
[1:23:31.760 --> 1:23:33.760]  fight that movement stay strong
[1:23:33.760 --> 1:23:35.760]  absolutely how do folks get involved
[1:23:35.760 --> 1:23:37.760]  with the Canadian action party well they
[1:23:37.760 --> 1:23:39.760]  go to our website that's the best way and they can
[1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:41.760]  just click on a dot in there and they can ask
[1:23:41.760 --> 1:23:43.760]  to be a contact person or
[1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:45.760]  to be contacted or they can ask to
[1:23:45.760 --> 1:23:47.760]  to be a member it's right in there on the
[1:23:47.760 --> 1:23:49.760]  on the on the homepage
[1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:51.760]  getting into population reduction
[1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:53.760]  that is their stated official
[1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:55.760]  you in in-game
[1:23:55.760 --> 1:23:57.760]  and you mentioned that
[1:23:57.760 --> 1:23:59.760]  your your take on
[1:23:59.760 --> 1:24:01.760]  where all this is going yes yes and that's
[1:24:01.760 --> 1:24:03.760]  why I'm also saying the alternative
[1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:05.760]  the supplements to be to stay strong on that
[1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:07.760]  because of the whole
[1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:09.760]  depopulation thing we've been a lot of talk about that for a long
[1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:11.760]  time as you know with Brzezinski talking
[1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:13.760]  about that a long time ago and
[1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:15.760]  that I think
[1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:17.760]  this whole pressure of
[1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:19.760]  the attack on these supplements
[1:24:19.760 --> 1:24:21.760]  is to prevent people from
[1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:23.760]  having natural ways to
[1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:25.760]  protect themselves and keep their own immune system
[1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:27.760]  strong that's going to be I think the
[1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:29.760]  subtle attack on us it's going to it's not going to be some sort
[1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:31.760]  of blatant violent
[1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:33.760]  coming down on us by
[1:24:33.760 --> 1:24:35.760]  military and police force it's going to be
[1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:37.760]  the whole health thing it's going to be
[1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:39.760]  it's incremental
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:41.760]  ambient background
[1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:43.760]  incrementally turned up right right
[1:24:43.760 --> 1:24:45.760]  right so that's the thing people stay strong
[1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:47.760]  but keep your supplements so if you get involved
[1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:49.760]  in that movement to prevent them from
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:51.760]  making it impossible for us to have access to
[1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:53.760]  those supplements wanting to make them totally
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:24:55.760]  illegal be illegal even to grow blueberries
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:57.760]  in your yard so that's
[1:24:57.760 --> 1:24:59.760]  this is big we have to protect that
[1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:01.760]  that's in the Codex Alimentarius
[1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:03.760]  right and they're now rating
[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:05.760]  Amish milk producers
[1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:07.760]  right
[1:25:07.760 --> 1:25:09.760]  co-ops that grow organic food
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:11.760]  they're arresting them that's a mainstream
[1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:13.760]  news you cannot make
[1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:15.760]  this insanity up it's all
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:17.760]  about control the animal
[1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:19.760]  ID act the premise society
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:21.760]  how they're taking over everything
[1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:23.760]  in closing how do you
[1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:25.760]  see this whole parliamentary crisis
[1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:27.760]  unfolding just they'll just take
[1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:29.760]  over the Liberals and then that way the Queen
[1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:31.760]  can still secretly rule instead of openly ruling
[1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:33.760]  well who
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:35.760]  the Liberals I think will simply support Harper
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:37.760]  and they'll
[1:25:37.760 --> 1:25:39.760]  they'll get whatever kind of package that they
[1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:41.760]  want which will facilitate the global
[1:25:41.760 --> 1:25:43.760]  the New World Order
[1:25:43.760 --> 1:25:45.760]  a whole agenda there's not going to be
[1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:47.760]  a takeover in my view right now of a coalition
[1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:49.760]  by the minority parties because
[1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:51.760]  Ignatius is a Harper right they're the same
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:53.760]  they're the same same stripes and
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:55.760]  their agenda is the same as the New World Order
[1:25:55.760 --> 1:25:57.760]  is the leadership of the Liberals
[1:25:57.760 --> 1:25:59.760]  that was actually fighting is now being removed
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:01.760]  well the leadership
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:03.760]  the Liberals that's right
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:05.760]  the people that were that were in the leadership
[1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:07.760]  under Dionne who were wanting to cooperate
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:09.760]  with the rest of the
[1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:11.760]  the opposition parties
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:13.760]  has been removed and they put into the
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:15.760]  leadership of the Liberals a person who is
[1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:17.760]  the New World or Ignatius let's be clear
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:19.760]  you know in the parliament with multiple parties
[1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:21.760]  not just two there was a coalition
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:23.760]  government forming the people
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:25.760]  representatives were saying get rid of Harper
[1:26:25.760 --> 1:26:27.760]  we're going to go in another direction that's right
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:29.760]  what the people want and the Queen came
[1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:31.760]  down from her pedestal waved a magic
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:33.760]  wand and said no well it didn't work
[1:26:33.760 --> 1:26:35.760]  quite like that what Harper did is he goes
[1:26:35.760 --> 1:26:37.760]  into the Queen's representative here
[1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:39.760]  and says the
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:41.760]  let me do the thing the way I want to do it
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:43.760]  and she has cooperated with them the leader
[1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:45.760]  of the Liberals at the time Dionne also went
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:47.760]  to her and said let us take over there will
[1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:49.760]  not be
[1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:51.760]  we will have the confidence what's supposed to happen
[1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:53.760]  is the Queen's representative is supposed to
[1:26:53.760 --> 1:26:55.760]  satisfy herself that the confidence of
[1:26:55.760 --> 1:26:57.760]  the parliament is in place and then to let
[1:26:57.760 --> 1:26:59.760]  that be the way that it runs
[1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:01.760]  Dionne went in and said the group
[1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:03.760]  of us that are in the minority we're together
[1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:05.760]  more than Harper's group
[1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:07.760]  and we want to take over and we have the confidence
[1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:09.760]  of the parliament she wouldn't go along with them
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:11.760]  she went along with Harper who said
[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:13.760]  let me just get rid of Harper
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:15.760]  who does not have the confidence
[1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:17.760]  she has the final checkmate
[1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:19.760]  she has the control but doesn't like to publicly
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:21.760]  use it Donnie Fogel thank you

[1:29:49.760 --> 1:29:51.760]  we're entering a holiday season
[1:29:51.760 --> 1:29:53.760]  never before seen in America
[1:29:53.760 --> 1:29:55.760]  we're thankful for the warning given by

[1:29:57.760 --> 1:29:59.760]  of the coming international incident
[1:29:59.760 --> 1:30:01.760]  which will force unpopular decisions
[1:30:01.760 --> 1:30:03.760]  without this warning
[1:30:03.760 --> 1:30:05.760]  many of us who still have money available
[1:30:05.760 --> 1:30:07.760]  would have unknowingly wasted on a Christmas
[1:30:07.760 --> 1:30:09.760]  gifts that will be useless when
[1:30:09.760 --> 1:30:11.760]  the only food available is in a government
[1:30:11.760 --> 1:30:13.760]  bread line when the president is faced
[1:30:13.760 --> 1:30:15.760]  with the expected national security
[1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:17.760]  incident the in place patriot

[1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:25.760]  must put in supplies of food
[1:30:25.760 --> 1:30:27.760]  this will free up the relief organizations
[1:30:27.760 --> 1:30:29.760]  to give food to those unable
[1:30:29.760 --> 1:30:31.760]  or not smart enough to prepare
[1:30:31.760 --> 1:30:33.760]  the greatest gift this Christmas
