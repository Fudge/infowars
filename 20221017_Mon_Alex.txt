[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:26.000 --> 00:38.000]  And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain.
[00:38.000 --> 00:50.000]  My friend, I'll say it clear, I'll state my case of which I'm certain.
[00:50.000 --> 01:02.000]  I've lived a life that's full, I traveled each and every highway.
[01:02.000 --> 01:11.000]  And more, much more than this, I did it my way.
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  It's Monday, October 17, 2022.
[01:15.000 --> 01:28.000]  Regrets, I've had a few, but then again, too few to mention.
[01:28.000 --> 01:40.000]  I did what I had to do, saw it through without exemption.
[01:40.000 --> 01:53.000]  I planned each chartered course, each capital step along the highway.
[01:53.000 --> 02:04.000]  And more, much more than this, I did it my way.
[02:04.000 --> 02:11.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this broadcast.
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  The tip of the spear, the enemy of tyrants.
[02:15.000 --> 02:23.000]  That's who we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:23.000 --> 02:39.000]  I ate it up, and in full war, spit it out.
[02:39.000 --> 02:47.000]  That's right, my friends, let the record show I took the blows.
[02:47.000 --> 02:55.000]  I've had my share of losing.
[02:55.000 --> 03:08.000]  And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing.
[03:08.000 --> 03:21.000]  To think I did all that, and may I say, not in a shy way.
[03:21.000 --> 03:27.000]  Oh, no, oh, no, not me.
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  I did it my way.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  This is definitely the anthem of info wars.
[03:33.000 --> 03:40.000]  And it's the anthem of all those that are trailblazers and Mavericks,
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  and stand up against the lying, globalist, new world order.
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  They're going to try to gaslight us.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  They're going to try to enslave us.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  They're going to try to break us.
[03:51.000 --> 03:57.000]  But it's through that process that we will discover who we really are and overcome.
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  We've got an incredible broadcast, huge guest, massive show today, and remember,
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  they don't want you tuning into this show, and they really don't want you sharing the links
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  or telling folks about the local stations.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  We are going to crush the new world order if you take action.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  You are taking action, and the numbers are coming in everywhere.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  Globalist policies are hated and reviled on a planetary scale.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  It's all coming up today.
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.000]  We're going to break some stations, join us, and I will plow into all the news on the war
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  and the economy and the borders.
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  And the new world order, you will eat the bugs agenda.
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  And just so much more today, Kanye West says he's buying parlor.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  The race towards the free internet is on.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  It's the new gold rush.
[04:41.000 --> 04:48.000]  We are, again, just blessed to be right at the center of what I call Operation 1776.
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  We are the black sheeps, but we will win the day.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  The children are counting on us.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  Get ready and start your engines. We'll be right back.
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there.
[05:28.000 --> 05:34.000]  It supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[05:34.000 --> 05:41.000]  So X3, despite the fact it was a run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right now
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  at infowarstore.com, and it funds the info war, which is the 360 win.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, it takes two weeks to kick out on average.
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  You've got to go to infowarstore.com and get X3 50% off.
[05:54.000 --> 06:20.000]  X3 50% off infowarstore.com.
[06:25.000 --> 06:34.000]  Well, let's kick off this Monday, October 17th, global transmission with the gas lighter in chief.
[06:34.000 --> 06:35.000]  He said this, of course.
[06:35.000 --> 06:37.000]  Over the weekend, it's gone viral.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  Well, don't hear it from me.
[06:39.000 --> 06:46.000]  Just hear it directly from the puppet in chief, the third administration of Barack Hussein Obama, O Biden.
[06:46.000 --> 06:54.000]  Is there one more economic order you're concerned about the strength of the dollar right now?
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  I'm not concerned about the Hussein dollar.
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  I'm concerned about the rest of the world.
[07:00.000 --> 07:02.000]  It makes sense?
[07:02.000 --> 07:03.000]  Yes.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  Our economy is telling us how.
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  The internal.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  Inflation is worldwide.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  Of course, all of everyone else is in the United States.
[07:13.000 --> 07:23.000]  So, while there's lack of economic growth in South Palestine, other countries are not so much worse.
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.000]  That's worldwide inflation.
[07:26.000 --> 07:27.000]  That's consequences.
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  You're doing a speech next over here.
[07:30.000 --> 07:35.000]  Our economy is strong as hell.
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  Because inflations worldwide.
[07:38.000 --> 07:44.000]  It would be like saying if there was a deadly plague going across the planet, killing billions, and it was killing a bunch of people here.
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  Well, it's okay, because it's killing them, too.
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  I'm not concerned about America.
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  I'm concerned about the rest of the world, he said.
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000]  You know, you don't normally have inflation even on a regional basis, much less a worldwide basis.
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  In fact, it's never happened.
[07:59.000 --> 08:04.000]  But we have global government now coordinating all of this with the big corporations and central banks.
[08:04.000 --> 08:10.000]  So, we do have global inflation, because we have the same global monetary policy until recently.
[08:10.000 --> 08:21.000]  Where even China and Russia and India were coordinating with the European Central Bank, with the private Federal Reserve, and other globalist groups like the IMF and World Bank.
[08:21.000 --> 08:28.000]  But the only bigger gas sliding than the gas slider in Chief O'Biden is Darryl Brooks.
[08:28.000 --> 08:29.000]  And I just got to play this again.
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  It happened on Friday.
[08:31.000 --> 08:36.000]  Here he is, while a witness is on the stand that saw him running over people.
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  And he says, who's Darryl Brooks?
[08:38.000 --> 08:39.000]  He says, it's you.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  And he says, I'm not Darryl Brooks.
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  I don't identify as that.
[08:43.000 --> 08:51.000]  Now, you can laugh at that, but that's the same level that the globalist engage in when they say two men can have a baby.
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  Or two women and a federal president had a baby.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  No man and a woman had a baby.
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  But we sit here and we listen to the programming.
[08:59.000 --> 09:06.000]  So if you laugh at Darryl Brooks, or cry after what he did, we should be laughing and crying over what the globalists are doing.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  It's on a much wider scale.
[09:08.000 --> 09:09.000]  Here he is.
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  I heard a horn beeping.
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  And then a Ford escape came through the parade route.
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.000]  And you drove past me and went and stopped.
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  And you continued driving into the parade route.
[09:24.000 --> 09:25.000]  Who is you?
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  Darryl Brooks, the defendant, seated at the table.
[09:28.000 --> 09:37.000]  Let the record reflect that I do not identify by that name, nor do I know anybody by that name.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  There you go.
[09:39.000 --> 09:45.000]  That man should be the president of the United States with a BS level that high.
[09:45.000 --> 09:53.000]  But that's all criminals of every type at every level have is total and complete absolute gaslighting.
[09:53.000 --> 10:01.000]  It's like the FBI has claimed last year and a half since Biden got in that the number one crime in America is white supremacy.
[10:01.000 --> 10:09.000]  And the number one threat is white supremacy and that whites are killing people at the highest rate when it comes to hate crimes.
[10:09.000 --> 10:19.000]  Now, how they did that as soon as Biden got in is they stopped only counting an actual hate crime where a white supremacist kills somebody.
[10:19.000 --> 10:28.000]  And it just happened a few months ago at a black patronized grocery store in New York in Buffalo or outside there.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.000]  That really happens.
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  It's still rare, but it's terrible.
[10:31.000 --> 10:38.000]  But they count every crime a white person commits is violent, whether it's against black or white, doesn't matter as a hate crime.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.000]  That's how they do that.
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  In fact, I meant to cover this last week.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  My producer really pushed me hard to cover it.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  I should have Scott reprinted me the articles.
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  Remember what the FBI did last week?
[10:47.000 --> 10:56.000]  They said crime has gone down in the last year and a half by 2 percent.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  Of course, crime on average is about 50 percent around the country.
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  Some areas is up fourfold in some of the blue cities.
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  Everybody knows that there's a crime wave after defining the police and the rest of it.
[11:06.000 --> 11:13.000]  And after they stopped prosecuting with Soros controlled prosecutors and DAs and several thousand jurisdictions.
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  I mean, we all know what caused it.
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.000]  And the FBI just doesn't count.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  You're ready for this.
[11:19.000 --> 11:26.000]  They don't count crime in America's largest 50 plus cities.
[11:26.000 --> 11:44.000]  So they don't process the crime numbers from Chicago or LA or New York or Miami or Houston or Dallas or Detroit or San Antonio or Oakland.
[11:44.000 --> 11:49.000]  Or Seattle or Portland.
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  They just say right there, oh, big headline.
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  Crime's actually down since Biden got in.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  Then you go read the fine print.
[11:57.000 --> 12:06.000]  They go, we no longer process statistics out of the largest cities, which is where the majority of people live and where the majority of the crime is happening.
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  FBI says U.S. violent crimes decreased, but data is missing.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  And again, the numbers all last year and a half.
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.000]  And it even says in Axios, well, they don't give us the big cities, though.
[12:24.000 --> 12:31.000]  That's as big a gaslighting as Darryl Brooks saying, I'm not Darryl Brooks.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  Now, if you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[12:33.000 --> 12:34.000]  We're going to play a little bit later.
[12:34.000 --> 12:42.000]  The latest footage comes out of a few hours of carjackings in places like Chicago and Houston and everywhere else now.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  But it's really bad in blue cities.
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  There's almost no gun ownership.
[12:45.000 --> 12:51.000]  This doesn't happen a lot, though, in more conservative areas because most folks are carrying a gun.
[12:51.000 --> 13:01.000]  But imagine two men with AK-47s come up, jump out in the highway, point guns at you.
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  And then you pull over, they get in and drive off with you kidnapped.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  Because the real news is this is a kidnapping taking place.
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  I just wanted to kick the broadcast off with covering the gaslighting.
[13:13.000 --> 13:21.000]  One of the new talking points out there I see everywhere is Alex Jones didn't put on defense because Alex Jones couldn't defend himself.
[13:21.000 --> 13:33.000]  I was found guilty in these two show trials, rigged in Texas and Connecticut exactly the same way, and wasn't allowed to say I was innocent and couldn't defend myself.
[13:33.000 --> 13:38.000]  So why even go up and testify when you're not allowed to talk and you're just a stunt dummy?
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.000]  And the judge threatened to hold me in contempt and arrest me if I said I was innocent.
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  It was a trap.
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.000]  It's a fraud.
[13:46.000 --> 13:47.000]  It's a lie.
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  It's a scam.
[13:49.000 --> 13:59.000]  And now they admit all over the news, I have stacks over here, that they're going after everybody else, including Kanye West, the Democratic Party and a big Democrat Party lawyer.
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  Kanye West said George Floyd died of fentanyl.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  That's what the coroner said was probably the cause.
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.000]  And that it wasn't deliberate that the officer killed him, which I believe, who would want to go to jail and kill somebody who's innocent?
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.000]  Turned out he knew George Floyd.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  They worked at a nightclub together, both at security.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  But I'm not defending what happened to George Floyd.
[14:16.000 --> 14:27.000]  The point is, is that Kanye has a right to his free speech, and I agree with him that they admit that Floyd was on all these different drugs.
[14:27.000 --> 14:33.000]  And that contributed, a lot of experts said, to him having the heart attack and dying.
[14:33.000 --> 14:42.000]  And now they're saying under the Alex Jones rule, if somebody's opinion hurts the family's feelings, the family's saying they're looking to sue.
[14:42.000 --> 14:49.000]  They said, look at the, they even quote me, they say, under the Alex Jones case, we're now going to sue Kanye West.
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.000]  And that's what this is all about.
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  We're going to be covering it today.
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.000]  We have a very special guest joining us as well.
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.000]  I have tons of news that stacked up Friday, Saturday, Sunday and today that I didn't go through.
[15:05.000 --> 15:15.000]  So they'll be a very special broadcast because I'm going to be getting a ton of stuff that is just incredibly important that I haven't gotten to, but also the latest breaking news information.
[15:15.000 --> 15:26.000]  And then we have a special guest joining us in the third hour, but I intend to open the phones up in the second hour today as well to discuss the iron curtain of censorship that's descending.
[15:26.000 --> 15:33.000]  And how the Democrats are openly bragging with the neocons that this is how they believe they'll defeat America and stop America.
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  It's the same thing in Europe.
[15:35.000 --> 15:45.000]  And people stop in the New World Order by literally suing everyone into oblivion and having controlled juries that are told you're guilty under default, try to destroy you.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  But it's not going to work.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  The suppression is not going to work.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  The one in Guardians calling for my arrest now.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  And the Democrats are saying, yes, the answer is arrest people for this info.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  We're truly becoming North Korea.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  We'll be right back.
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  I don't promote things unless they really work when it comes to politics or culture.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.000]  Economics.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  We're always the cutting edge tip of the spear.
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  And when we talk about the products in InformerStore.com, they all blow you away.
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be repeat customers.
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  And finally, one of our best selling products sold out for months back in stock.
[16:21.000 --> 16:22.000]  It's X3.
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there.
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.000]  It supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[16:32.000 --> 16:41.000]  So X3, despite the fact it was a run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  And it funds the info war, which is the 360 win.
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, it takes two weeks to kick out on average.
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.000]  You've got to go to infowarstore.com and get X3 50% off.
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.000]  X3 50% off infowarstore.com.
[17:22.000 --> 17:29.000]  As being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.000]  The old reason, humanity is still in the fight today.
[17:33.000 --> 17:39.000]  Because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  I don't take the credit.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  I give you the credit.
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours.
[17:46.000 --> 17:47.000]  It isn't going to give up.

[20:24.000 --> 20:34.000]  Monday through Friday, kicking off at 8 a.m. Central Standard Time,
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  10 hours of live uncensored, unfiltered freedom.
[20:38.000 --> 20:41.000]  Starting off with Harrison Smith, an American Journal.
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.000]  Here's truly Alex Jones at 11 a.m.
[20:44.000 --> 20:54.000]  Owen Shroyer, 3 p.m. Central to 6 p.m. with the original War Room.
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  Okay, let's give you some of the good news.
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  And the polls are everywhere and these are scientific.
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  Even though they're over sampling Democrats, 10 to 15%,
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.000]  it shows massive Republican red wave tsunami.
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  But our red wave has to make it over their election fraud seawall.
[21:13.000 --> 21:19.000]  Republicans are absolutely trouncing Democrats in latest generic ballot,
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.000]  winning by huge points in almost every race.
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.000]  Kerry Lake spars with CNN's Dana Bash over 2020 election fraud,
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  points out that Democrats are the ones always claiming that there's frauds
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  and that they're a scam and that we can't trust the elections,
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  but when they run them, we supposedly can.
[21:37.000 --> 21:45.000]  Blake Masters is already claiming his election will be stolen in his race.
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  In the campaign to unseat Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat, Arizona Republican,
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  Blake Masters has consistently amplified skepticism and conspiracy theories
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.000]  surrounding the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
[21:57.000 --> 22:01.000]  So they know, the Democrats know that people are aware and awake
[22:01.000 --> 22:04.000]  and they're trying to demonize anybody that asks questions.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  Roger Stone will be popping in at the bottom of the next hour
[22:07.000 --> 22:14.000]  to give his take on the midterms that are only 22 days out.
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  Now let's hit some really powerfully positive news.
[22:18.000 --> 22:22.000]  As I've hammered and hammered and hammered,
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  the real crime going on of all the big crimes, but the biggest,
[22:26.000 --> 22:32.000]  is the poison shots lying about gain of function, where the virus came from
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  and the fact that these aren't vaccines, the fact that they erase your immune system.
[22:36.000 --> 22:42.000]  Big article up on infowars.com with links and video from zerohedge.com.
[22:42.000 --> 22:49.000]  EU prosecutor opens probe into COVID vaccine purchases
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  and the secret deals signed with Pfizer and Moderna
[22:53.000 --> 23:00.000]  for tens upon tens upon tens of billions of dollars.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  There's also new criminal investigations opened into the fact
[23:03.000 --> 23:08.000]  that they knew the shots didn't work, but lied to the public and said they did.
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.000]  EU prosecutor opens probe into COVID vaccine purchases
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  to accept Pfizer's CEO bailed on EU testimony
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  in the wake of a report highlighting the secretive vaccine deal
[23:18.000 --> 23:24.000]  between himself, European Commission President Ursula Wanderlave,
[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  the European Public Prosecutor's Office,
[23:27.000 --> 23:32.000]  EPPQ has opened an investigation into the EU's COVID-19 purchases.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  Politico is reporting.
[23:34.000 --> 23:40.000]  And here's the European Public Prosecutor's Office confirming the report.
[23:40.000 --> 23:46.000]  They can run, but they cannot hide.
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  Continuing here, I want to play this clip.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  This is Dr. John Campbell, the number one doctor on YouTube.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  His average video has 3 million views.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  He's a very respected medical doctor.
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  And he was not even a skeptic at the beginning,
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  but very quickly began to point out the shots didn't work and were dangerous.
[24:03.000 --> 24:09.000]  And here he is in a short clip talking about month on month
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  in the last year and a half since the shots began,
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  the deaths dwarfing what we saw supposedly from COVID.
[24:16.000 --> 24:19.000]  So here he is laying out some of the latest numbers.
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.000]  And that leaves us with these really big unknowns that we look forward.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  And I'm not picking on Australia.
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.000]  I'm just using it to combine what we know and what we don't know.
[24:31.000 --> 24:39.000]  But the excess deaths here for 2022 so far, 17.1% higher than average.
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.000]  And there's no reason to say that in the UK it's not similar with the larger population.
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  Of course, that number is going to be way higher.
[24:46.000 --> 24:49.000]  16.8% higher than average.
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  And I think we really need some sort of official inquiry into this.
[24:55.000 --> 25:04.000]  Why are 16.8% to 17.1% more people dying than we would expect?
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  What are the cause or causes of this?
[25:09.000 --> 25:17.000]  And I really feel that this is something that government should answer as a matter of urgency.
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  And indeed, academics.
[25:22.000 --> 25:27.000]  Why not, why we're not hearing much more about this is a mystery to me.
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  But I've done my bit to try and ask this question as much as I can.
[25:31.000 --> 25:38.000]  And let's hope for some answers pretty soon because a lot of people are dying
[25:38.000 --> 25:42.000]  who wouldn't according to historical precedence.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  Thank you for watching.
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  And by the way, when you crunch the numbers from around the western world that took the shots,
[25:49.000 --> 25:56.000]  it's exactly the same in an overall average around 17% increase in any previous death rate.
[25:56.000 --> 26:02.000]  But when you look at certain demographics, men 18 to 63, it's over 40.
[26:02.000 --> 26:09.000]  That's German, UK, US, Australian, New Zealand, Canadian insurance companies.
[26:09.000 --> 26:16.000]  They're dead on numbers, a 40 to 42%, depending on the country, increase in mortality.
[26:16.000 --> 26:23.000]  These are more numbers than died in World War II and Vietnam and Korea combined every year.
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  Just magically, these are facts.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  These are very stubborn things.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  But how do you deal with that?
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  Billions in taxpayer money in America alone, exact same program was run in Europe
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  and in the UK and Australia and Canada, New Zealand, all the same coordinated U.N. control.
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.000]  Having big tech censor, anybody that government big pharma said censor,
[26:45.000 --> 26:51.000]  from talk show host to medical doctors to mothers and fathers that lost their children or loved ones from the shots,
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  must be silenced.
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.000]  I remember last year, a college athlete in great health had microcarditis and a heart attack
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  and had to have a heart ablaze and it almost died.
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.000]  And the doctor at the hospital said the shot caused it, the Pfizer shot caused it.
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  And they censored him and took him off Instagram when his video had 5 million views.
[27:08.000 --> 27:16.000]  And then the U.N. was quoted in Yahoo News, and I read it probably 20 times on air.
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.000]  And they said, well, we're the U.N., we're an advisory panel and we told them to take his channel down.
[27:21.000 --> 27:24.000]  Even though what the young man said is true and his doctor told the truth,
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  you're going to scare people off from the shot.
[27:26.000 --> 27:34.000]  So we are telling you, do not talk about it again or you'll be fully banned from Instagram and Facebook.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  Now, remember what just happened two weeks ago?
[27:36.000 --> 27:44.000]  The head of the U.N. Information Bureau, the Ministry of Truth, was on a TED talk and said,
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  we at the U.N. control Google and Facebook and all of them and we control what's censored in live time
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  and we control the search results.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  So the U.N. is in control.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  That's why this is going on.
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  Then we have this little gym.
[27:58.000 --> 28:04.000]  Biden's Health and Human Services, the CDC, paid screenwriters and comedians to mock unvaccinated
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  and to call for violence against them.
[28:06.000 --> 28:12.000]  Remember all that, how we're murderers, how we're killers, how we should be denied medical care,
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  how we should be put in jail, how we should be put in camps.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  This was their big authoritarian rollout.
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  Their big attempt to take over and people woke up and backed them off.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  Now they hope you just forget and go away and don't call for their prosecution and don't sue them.
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.000]  But we're not.
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.000]  We're not going away.
[28:28.000 --> 28:29.000]  None of us are going away.
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.000]  And you won't silence us with intimidation.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  You'll only intensify our efforts.
[28:32.000 --> 28:39.000]  You murdering criminals that have tried to gag us and silence us while we expose what you and the Bill Gates,
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.000]  Klaus Schwab, U.N. run depopulation operation have launched against us.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  I am honored to be public enemy number one.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  I am honored the global estate of my guts.
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.000]  I am honored to be going at them 110 percent because we're defending the lives of ourselves and our families
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  and every human on earth.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  We'll be back.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  It's our best seller.
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[29:05.000 --> 29:11.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them,
[29:11.000 --> 29:14.000]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  And it's been sold out for a while but it's finally back in stock.
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system,
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.000]  but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[29:23.000 --> 29:30.000]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  Essential means without these things you die.
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  And so much the food is debased.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[29:37.000 --> 29:41.000]  It is critical to bolster our bodies defenses with a product like this.
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[29:43.000 --> 29:47.000]  But this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds the InfoWare.

[30:20.000 --> 30:24.000]  But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.

[30:26.000 --> 30:31.000]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalist,

[31:15.000 --> 31:19.000]  and the boycotts, and the attacks, and the lawsuits stay on air.

[31:24.000 --> 31:29.000]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[31:29.000 --> 31:32.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[31:32.000 --> 31:38.000]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  It's unsustainable.
[31:40.000 --> 31:44.000]  So please, visit saveinfowars.com.

[31:59.000 --> 32:01.000]  Fluoride is the enemy.

[32:07.000 --> 32:08.000]  What's the good halogen?

[33:21.000 --> 33:35.000]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened.
[33:35.000 --> 33:40.000]  Because we are effective, the great awakening is here.
[33:40.000 --> 33:46.000]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[33:46.000 --> 33:54.000]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com.
[33:54.000 --> 34:05.000]  And never give up the fight.
[34:05.000 --> 34:14.000]  Infowars.com.
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  All right.
[34:16.000 --> 34:27.000]  In the next segment, I'm going to cover a subject that is absolutely 100% the most paramount issue.
[34:27.000 --> 34:32.000]  And if you understand this, you'll understand everything about the enemy and why they're doing what they're doing.
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  And it's totally dead on.
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  Totally dead on.
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.000]  What we're going to be laying out here.
[34:39.000 --> 34:44.000]  In fact, this is so big, and we've talked a lot about it in the past, but only pieces of it.
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.000]  I'm tempted to not even break this next segment and just do a whole show tomorrow on it,
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.000]  but we're going to go ahead and get into it starting next segment.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  Now, let me talk about the good news.
[34:58.000 --> 35:04.000]  The entire globalist program for depopulation, biomedical tyranny, world medical ID cards,
[35:04.000 --> 35:10.000]  the basis of the world social credit score, carbon tax is in deep trouble.
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  And across the board, people are waking up very, very fast.
[35:14.000 --> 35:20.000]  That said, the enemies of humanity are going to launch cyber attacks, expanded wars,
[35:20.000 --> 35:30.000]  further economic attack to bring us to our knees so bad that we're so poor and so distracted trying to feed our families
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  that we can't politically organize.
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  That's why this is such a life and death situation.
[35:36.000 --> 35:45.000]  So I'm going to get into how they plan to try to silence all of us here in a moment and then hit what they once silenced,
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  but it's not been silenced coming up next segment.
[35:49.000 --> 35:59.000]  But I wanted to just reach out to listeners and encourage you because our enemies are engaged in massive gaslighting as usual.
[35:59.000 --> 36:06.000]  They are all over the news since this billion dollar fake judgment with the show trial last week in Connecticut,
[36:06.000 --> 36:19.000]  saying that Jones is trying to dodge the billion dollars and that Jones must be shut down or they won't get their billion dollars.
[36:19.000 --> 36:27.000]  Now, that's like Daryl Brooks, the Kenosha killer, saying he's not Daryl Brooks and wasn't there and didn't do it.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  Everybody saw him do it.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  It's that level of gaslighting.
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.000]  No, I'm not going to pay a billion dollars because I don't have three million dollars.
[36:36.000 --> 36:43.000]  I made that very clear, but the control media says Jones says he's not going to pay this.
[36:43.000 --> 36:49.000]  And then their lawyers get up in Texas and Connecticut and say, don't buy his products and don't donate to him.
[36:49.000 --> 36:58.000]  You see, they don't want money, their clients, they want to silence us. And I know you understand that, but they have hundreds of articles out there today.
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  Washington Post, The Examiner, Media Matters.
[37:02.000 --> 37:07.000]  Jones admits on air he plans to scam the families by staying on air.
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  Oh, I thought you wanted money.
[37:10.000 --> 37:18.000]  It's not a scam for free speech systems to be in chapter 11 sub chapter 5 reorganization.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  That's the little fly on the ointment.
[37:20.000 --> 37:26.000]  Most talk show hosts wouldn't work for almost no money under chapter 5.
[37:26.000 --> 37:32.000]  If I do that, this place goes on, we stay on air and we continue to broadcast and they don't stop us.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  And they're so pissed about that.
[37:36.000 --> 37:47.000]  And I'm about to file fully sworn declaration of my personal assets in the next week in the bankruptcy court and they are going to flip their lids.
[37:47.000 --> 37:54.000]  Because I'm worth less even than what I've said because I've done accounting in a while.
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  So I'm basically for an operation this size out of money.
[37:59.000 --> 38:08.000]  And look, I don't care if those people got paid money, they already got 73 million from Remington and they've already raised hundreds of millions of charities and it's a business.
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.000]  We all know that of being anti-gun, anti-second amendment.
[38:13.000 --> 38:20.000]  And if some blisters are uncomfortable with the idea, well, we keep you on air and you're in bankruptcy, these people are going to get the money.
[38:20.000 --> 38:29.000]  Yes, folks, after two years of appeals, if those fail and all this stuff goes on and we're still here, any profit from info wars will go to them.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  But there's never been a ton of profit.
[38:31.000 --> 38:39.000]  And if that's our tax to Soros and the globalist for them not getting what they want us going off air, then so be it.
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.000]  Because I'm loyal to this crew, this infrastructure, what we've built here.
[38:44.000 --> 38:51.000]  Obviously one way or another, unless they kill me or put me in prison, which they're not talking about, I'm going to keep talking and I'm not going to shut up.
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  And I'll just tell the listeners and I'll just tell my enemies this.
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.000]  And my enemies actually listen to everything I say because they know I tell the truth.
[38:57.000 --> 39:02.000]  They always lie about what I say, but they know what I say is true.
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  They've shown that over and over again.
[39:05.000 --> 39:11.000]  That what they've done to me has blown up in their face.
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  Info wars is way more influential than it's ever been.
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  I'm way more influential than ever been.
[39:16.000 --> 39:30.000]  And not just not just US audiences, but world audiences, particularly government leaders, intelligence agencies, other media figures are listening right now.
[39:30.000 --> 39:41.000]  They are publicly defending info wars and adopting our analysis in world view and going out and doing their own research and discovering it's true.
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  Which they did before.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  That's why they're adopting my world view is they went out and research and found it was true.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  And now they're accelerating that.
[39:47.000 --> 39:53.000]  So no matter what they do to me, put me in prison, kill me, whatever they do, they fail.
[39:53.000 --> 39:59.000]  And they want to convince me that I'm a loser, convince me I'm ashamed, convince me they've defeated me, convince you they've done that.
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.000]  And my family's never been more supportive.
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  My wife's never been more supportive.
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.000]  I've never been more proud of myself.
[40:08.000 --> 40:13.000]  I've never been more proud of our crew and the work we're doing.
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.000]  I intended to bring down the new world order.
[40:16.000 --> 40:24.000]  I intended to try to galvanize and energize and ignite humanities, life force and resistance to tyranny and death and Satan.
[40:24.000 --> 40:35.000]  And through the grace of God and your support, us working as a team, we get the credit and we deserve the credit and we get the attacks that come with it.
[40:35.000 --> 40:51.000]  For wounding the new world order grievously, grievous, grievous wound, grievous, they will not survive it politically, culturally, economically.
[40:51.000 --> 41:02.000]  Now, if Captain Ahab wants to get Moby Dick, he's got to go down with the whale.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  And that's what this is all about.
[41:03.000 --> 41:14.000]  You see, I've been looking for you and I'm jumping out of the boat with my harpoon and I'm tied up in the rigging and you think you've got me.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  I've got you.
[41:16.000 --> 41:25.000]  Go to YouTube, pull up a classic original Moby Dick with, is it Peck?
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  I forget the actor.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  Gregory Peck, yeah.
[41:29.000 --> 41:34.000]  Pull up Gregory Peck, Moby Dick, final scene.
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  And that's Alex Jones.
[41:37.000 --> 41:45.000]  Tied up to the side of the new world order whale with a big giant harpoon that I've already got about three foot in trying to get that heart.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  But here's the good news.
[41:47.000 --> 41:54.000]  Even if Moby goes down this time, there's not just one boat on the surface.
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.000]  There's 10,000.
[41:57.000 --> 42:07.000]  And so even if I haven't got them, I've wounded Moby and you're going to get them when he comes back up and you see my dead corpse strapped to the side of him.
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  Just aim right at me with those harpoons.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  I'll be a good target for you.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  And I want to be that battle cry.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  I want you to go watch the original classic Moby Dick based on the novel.
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  And I want you to understand that's me.
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  I went looking for the whale.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  I nailed the silver piece to the mast.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  I'm there when St. Elmo's fire comes down.
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  We have it.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  Are you with me?
[42:37.000 --> 42:44.000]  In post, because we're live right now, have Marcos find a spot.
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  You see a have on the side of the whale.
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  Scabbing him with the and then when it comes back up and A has dead.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  I want that on there because that.
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  Yes, that's me right there.
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.000]  I don't promote things unless they really work when it comes to politics or culture.
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.920]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[43:02.920 --> 43:06.640]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics,
[43:06.640 --> 43:09.800]  we are always the cutting edge tip of the spear.
[43:09.800 --> 43:11.000]  And when we talk about the products
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.720]  in infomercial.com, they all blow you away.
[43:13.720 --> 43:16.000]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them,
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.120]  I know you'll be, we'll be customers.
[43:18.120 --> 43:20.000]  And finally, one of our best selling products
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.320]  sold out for months back in stock, it's X3.

[44:01.320 --> 44:06.240]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[44:06.240 --> 44:10.160]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics,
[44:10.160 --> 44:12.640]  not just in America, but to the world.
[44:12.640 --> 44:16.120]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range
[44:16.120 --> 44:19.520]  in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit.
[44:19.520 --> 44:22.520]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers
[44:22.520 --> 44:24.960]  who support info wars are the real reason
[44:24.960 --> 44:26.680]  you've had this success.
[44:26.680 --> 44:29.520]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight
[44:29.520 --> 44:32.080]  against the new order you've ever had.
[44:32.080 --> 44:36.440]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[44:36.440 --> 44:39.480]  And that's why today it's more important than ever
[44:39.480 --> 44:41.680]  to realize how important you've been in this fight
[44:41.680 --> 44:44.280]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out
[44:44.280 --> 44:45.640]  and to intensify them.

[44:46.960 --> 44:48.000]  I salute you.
[44:48.000 --> 44:49.040]  I thank you.

[44:52.000 --> 44:55.200]  because we are over the target and history is happening.

[44:59.880 --> 45:03.440]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[45:03.440 --> 45:06.560]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[45:06.560 --> 45:08.160]  Now, I knew that.
[45:08.160 --> 45:11.000]  And for 28 years, I've been on air, exposed to these people.
[45:11.000 --> 45:12.840]  And together, we've had a great effect.

[45:14.960 --> 45:17.480]  They're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power

[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  Let me finish up with some big news.
[48:04.000 --> 48:10.000]  So, there's nowhere you can bet on freedom better than here.
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  If you want to fight tyranny, if you don't want to be a slave,
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.000]  if you want to resist the New World Order, there's nowhere
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  you can support better than spreading the word about infowars
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.000]  and praying for the broadcast and buying product.
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.000]  And God always keeps me honest, neck and neck with these people,
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  but right now we need funds for the appeals process
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  that will push them out for years,
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.000]  and all the top lawyers say there's no way they went on appeal
[48:32.000 --> 48:33.000]  or the country's gone.
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.000]  I think things are going so bad that if the globals keep winning,
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  we'll lose the appeals in a few years,
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  but that's two years they don't even want.
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  They're pulling their hair out, they want us off air now.
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  And we're in bankruptcy to keep the free speech systems going,
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.000]  and as long as it's profitable, which they don't want,
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  that's why their lawyers are saying don't buy us products,
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  literally, don't send him money.
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  In press conferences, they say our goal is to shut him down.
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.000]  They're already backed by all the big banker money.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  So go to infowarstore.com,
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  get great products you already need.
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  Now we've got the sale that's going.
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  It can only be extended for a few more days,
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  because a lot of the products are close to selling out,
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  other than like X3 without a mineral fusion.
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  They just came back in, but limited supply.
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.000]  We've already sold out of 70% of X3
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  and half of the vitamin mineral fusion,
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  because they're both 50% off and they're incredible
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.000]  for your whole body, your immune system, and more.
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  Brainforce Ultra, Brainforce Plus,
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  vitamin D3 with calcium, highest quality.
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  It's all there, infowarstore.com.
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  And with promo code 1-776-1776,
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  you may have heard of it,
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  on country's birthday,
[49:48.000 --> 49:52.000]  you get an additional 10% off, that's 60% off.
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  Well, not just those products, but a bunch of them.
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  They're all 40 to 50% off.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  So you get at least 50% off,
[49:58.000 --> 50:03.000]  on many items, 60% with 1776 at infowarstore.com.
[50:03.000 --> 50:06.000]  And we are shipping within 24 hours,
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.000]  unless you order on a Saturday,
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  then it'll be on Monday, you get your product.
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  Some days we're shipping products,
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.000]  same day, so proud of our warehouse and our crew.
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.000]  infowarstore.com, or AAA-2533139.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  And separately, if you go to infowarstore.com,
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  you can buy an unsigned copy of the Great Reset
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.000]  and the World with the World,
[50:25.000 --> 50:26.000]  but the number one book in the last few months,
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  off and on, number one in the world, period,
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  nonfiction fiction, the globals are so upset.
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.000]  But it's going to take months and months and months
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  for us to get the royalties from that.
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  Hopefully it'll be over a million bucks.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  I'll put it right into the company,
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  you know, to fund this operation.
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  In fact, I've taken all the book sales,
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  at infowarstore.com, where we actually
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  bottom ourselves and sell them,
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  and I put it right in to keep free speech on air.
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  I've taken it out of the money myself,
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  though I need funds personally,
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  because I got to pay for 40% of legal fees.
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  But regardless, if you want to be part of the fundraiser,
[50:54.000 --> 50:57.000]  get a Great Reset and the World for the World
[50:57.000 --> 51:01.000]  for $99 signed exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.000]  But with promo code 1776, it's $10 less.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  But I know a lot of you don't care,
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  because you want to support.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  So thank you for keeping free speech on the air,
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  free speech systems that owns and runs this broadcast,
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  or this facility that we broadcast out of.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  infowarstore.com,
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  infowarstore.com,
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.000]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  Now, if you want to help us continue to stay on air
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  and help me stay on air,
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  and help engage in some very important activities,
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.000]  all of that that you'll soon be seeing and hearing about,
[51:35.000 --> 51:39.000]  you need to go to www.patriotcollectibles.com,
[51:39.000 --> 51:43.000]  or www.1776coin.com.
[51:43.000 --> 51:48.000]  www.1776coin.com.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  And we had three coins that sold out,
[51:51.000 --> 51:54.000]  the founding member coins.
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  And everybody's a founding member will be,
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  not just getting the discounts on future items
[51:58.000 --> 51:59.000]  at www.patriotcollectibles.com,
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  but you're going to not just get other discounts
[52:01.000 --> 52:02.000]  on products that's already happening,
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  you're going to get free memberships of things
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  that are being launched by other folks,
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  And the Teddy Roosevelt coin is not a founding member coin,
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  but I'm going to extend founding member status
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  to everybody that gets the coin.
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  It's $130.
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  Plus it's $30 something to make,
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  Teddy Roosevelt man the arena.
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  Only $10,000, we're down to a couple thousand,
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  but here's the key.
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.000]  You get $30 off with promo code 1776 as well
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  at www.1776coin.com.
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  You get even bigger discount when you buy a second coin,
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  and free shipping.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  But that's as low as we can go,
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  because we've got to, through these folks we're working with,
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  get funds in for these projects we've got going.
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  You've seen how effective we are against the globalists.
[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  You've seen the devastation that we've engaged in
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  against the enemies of humans.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  We will crush this force
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  with your help together,
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  but I need everybody to not procrastinate.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  Just like you bought the book,
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  signed copy, you get the coins
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.000]  at Patriot Collectibles.
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  That's Patriot Collectibles.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  PatriotCollectibles.com
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  or www.1776coin.com.
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  And I'm going to add this to the website today.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  I'm going to call the folks that run it.
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  We don't own it or run it.
[53:14.000 --> 53:18.000]  Starting today,
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  everybody that gets the coin,
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  and in fact we'll get the list of folks that bought it
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  and send everybody one of these.
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  That's something that Patriot saw to get anyways.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  Everybody that's gotten a coin,
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  in fact in the past and henceforth,
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  will get a signed card from me
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  since everybody wants my signature and I'm flattered
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  and I appreciate it.
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  And that's a good benefit for folks
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  because they're paying $100 for a book,
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  signed copy, makes a lot of sense, thanks for the support.
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  So everybody buying the rest of the Teddy Roosevelt coin
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  and everybody that previously bought a coin,
[53:52.000 --> 53:56.000]  I'm going to sign cards.
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  That'll be another Herculean task,
[53:58.000 --> 54:02.000]  but I'm going to do it and we are going to mail that out to you.
[54:02.000 --> 54:05.000]  But everybody, at this time that orders coins going forward,
[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  we'll get a signed card with my signature
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  and then it'll take me,
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  those I can do right away with the few thousand coins that are left.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  Everybody else that's previously got the coin,
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  it'll take me probably a few weeks to get them all signed
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  and it'll all, you know, mailed out to you,
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  but that'll happen as well.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  So that's just another benefit of being a founding member.
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  We'll make sure that happens.
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  Everybody that gets the last 2,000 coins,
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  you will get your signed Alex Jones signature right away with it.
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  All right, here's what's going to happen.
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  I said I'd hit the biggest news ever this segment.
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  I didn't do this on purpose where I held you over,
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  but I got a plug where I won't be on air.
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  This is such a big subject that I said I would take calls,
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  but I'm not going to take calls today
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.000]  because I need to go ahead and spend most of the next hour on this.
[54:49.000 --> 54:53.000]  When I saw this report Saturday,
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.000]  yeah, I was hit like a thunderbolt
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  because I already knew it, you already knew it,
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  you're going to know this when I play it,
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  but the fact that it's so real,
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  and that's why the globalists are doing this,
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  and while they're trying to depopulate us,
[55:08.000 --> 55:11.000]  I had of this cataclysm that they believe is coming.
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.000]  Whether it's coming or not, the globalists believe this.
[55:14.000 --> 55:19.000]  And so I'm going to really take you to the bottom of the rabbit hole
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.000]  at the start of the next hour here in just a few minutes,
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.000]  and then we will continue on from there.
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  But I'm very thankful to the listeners.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  I don't like coming on here and plugging and begging for support,
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  but you see the enemies of freedom all over TV,
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  all over the news saying we want him shut down,
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  we want him to silence, that's their goal,
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.000]  because we, through God's work,
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.000]  together, this family of our crew, myself, the other hosts,
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  the guests, the callers,
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  we really are what the globalists hate.
[55:49.000 --> 55:50.000]  They hate you.
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  They hate independent, informed, free people.
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  They hate the idea that America aspired to.
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  Though it never fully got there, it got further than anybody else.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  And so they really see me as the populist enemy.
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.000]  They see me as the archetype for the lead monster
[56:05.000 --> 56:12.000]  and their pantheon and their lexicon in their system.
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  And I am very honored.
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.000]  I'm serious.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  The most valuable thing to me in the world,
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  the most important thing in the world,
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  is that we take down the new world order,
[56:22.000 --> 56:23.000]  because our children don't have a future,
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  our souls don't have a future if we don't do this.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  This is the most important thing.
[56:28.000 --> 56:34.000]  And so my most valued asset is not some trophy on the wall
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  or my house or my car, or even my children.
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  They're free souls.
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.000]  It is having the enemies of God hate me
[56:44.000 --> 56:47.000]  above almost anybody else in the world.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  That is a real sign I'm on the right path
[56:49.000 --> 56:52.000]  like I'm a heat-seeking missile.
[56:52.000 --> 56:56.000]  And so, again, I just want to thank the listeners from the bottom of my heart
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  for keeping us on air through all of this,
[56:58.000 --> 57:01.000]  because it is only my desire to stop these people.
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  It is only my desire and total drive and commitment before God
[57:05.000 --> 57:09.000]  to stop them with every means necessary, legal and lawful.
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  And so we're going to do this together.
[57:11.000 --> 57:19.000]  But I'm going to come back and I'm going to set this up.
[57:19.000 --> 57:22.000]  And then I'm going to go to the clip and lay out the rest of the story.
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  But if you want to understand how this whole thing works,
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  this is so big that I never have anxiety on air very rarely.
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  And I rarely have a frog in my throat.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  I rarely have butterflies.
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.000]  This is so big that I want to get it just right.
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  And so that's why I kind of choked last segment this segment
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  and didn't cover it, because this is so big.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  I mean, if people get this, they get everything.
[57:46.000 --> 58:12.000]  We'll see you right back next hour.
[58:16.000 --> 58:20.000]  All of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.000]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  And so much the food is debased.
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.

[59:47.000 --> 59:50.000]  X3.
[59:50.000 --> 59:55.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[59:55.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  We have U.S. Senators in both parties saying,
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first,
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  What do you think that makes the Russians do?
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  Only one level above that on their death con,
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying,
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  Think of their interests.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast,
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  within five minutes of being launched.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach-Land launch systems.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  They can also launch from ships that are at Mach-9 and be shot down.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  And yes, the United States has those, too.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  That's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed systems that we don't have.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  It's on record the U.S. has those systems.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  The point is, it's called mutually assured destruction
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  or mad for a reason,
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  because anyone that would violate the mad doctrine is insane.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war,
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  especially when Russia is not starting to fight with us,
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  and especially after we just heard for years
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  that everything happening in this country is run by Russia
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  when that was all a giant lie.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas,
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  the U.S. resistance against a global corporate combine
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  empowered and funded by Communist China,
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  This is all confirmed. This is not a drill.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  They've officially become state-run. Apple 100%.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  Google is now making the transition
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man,
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  This is happening. This is not like the other probes
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship,
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  This is a tight-traded dose, reverse psychological warfare operation
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover,
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  Total Internet of Things, integration, global social score,
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  complete command and control system.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  now attacking the United States with traders inside the major security agencies,
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop us
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  from removing the tentacles of the chai-coms-slash-big-tech-making-combine emergency situation.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  and have been battering, ramming and out as much as I can.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  So they take what I've said, being sincere,
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  build me into an insincere person in the strawman.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  And so they make me a herder of children.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they'd now use me as an archetype
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  to serve them by being the main distraction.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  and it's being used against you.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  I have given you the transmission.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Now break free!
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  I have sworn upon the altar of God,
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  Thomas Jefferson.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  The big news is coming up right now on the O.S.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  This is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  Right now I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  The chair is against the wall.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  John has a long mustache.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  It's 12 o'clock Americans, another day closer to victory.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  It's supercharges, your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  So X3, despite the fact it was a run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right now
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  at infowarstore.com and it funds the info war, which is a 360 win.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, it takes two weeks to kick out on average.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  You've got to go to infowarstore.com and get X3 50% off.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  infowarstore.com.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  Let me just give you the answer in my research review and then we'll walk through it some.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  The globalists have all in countless U.N. documents, countless Google statements, countless World
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  Economic Forum statements said by the year 2045, 2046, 2047, they normally say 2047.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  But some say 2045, 2046, that we will be a post-human world and the age of humans will be over
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  and the future is not human and that we need to depopulate the vast majority of people
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  down to 500 million or less long before that date is reached.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  And then when you go out and you research what the left's teaching in elementary schools
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  and in high schools and in colleges and in corporate systems and in the media and the culture,
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  we've all heard Beto, we've all heard Obama and we've all heard AOC say everybody's going to be dead in 2030.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  If we don't do what they say and cut the carbon, even though news is out that the ice caps just grew again.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  They were supposed to all be melted a decade ago.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  We're planting this idea that we need to die and we're going to die, but it's going to save the Earth when we die.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  William Shatner last year went up on Bezos' spacecraft.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  When he came back, he said, it's so sad when I was up in space, I looked down and I realized almost all these people
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  would die with the cataclysm that's coming, the horrible event, so much death.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  They're in a cult, folks. Not like William Shatner, but I mean, he's been brought into it.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  And he goes to the transhumanist events and he's private galas with less than a thousand people
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  that a lot of people I know go to and won't talk about what happens inside of them.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  Leon Musk has been at the meetings and he says, yeah, they're planning to depopulate people, they want to post-human world.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  I don't know if Leon Musk is a good guy or a bad guy, but what he's saying about that is absolutely true.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  So we're going to play this special report by Greg Rees that gets into the big secret and why they're doing this.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  And then come back and play you. I got countless clips. We'll play you Sean Penn and Neil DeGrasse Tyson, always going to mess his name up,
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  saying nuclear war is a good thing now. It's a liberal thing. So they're introducing Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Sean Penn, all of them,
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  this idea because the globalists really believe, as all these other ancient cultures did,
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  that a major cataclysm is coming in the year 2047 or somewhere right around it.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  Not the whole 2012 end of the world thing. That was their propaganda to get you ready for what they believe is the end of the world
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  as we know it coming up. So here is Greg Rees' incredibly important report, imminent cataclysm and the plan to survive the great reset.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  It's on Band-Aught video. I'm going to have it posted on the live show feed today.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  I'm going to have it posted at the main page of Info Wars right now so you can find it and share it.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  Then we'll come back and give you the rest of the story and why this is so serious straight ahead.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  The three cataclysms of the Vishnu Purana, the sinking of Atlantis and Lemuria.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  The history of the world is rich with stories of cataclysms.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  The five sons of the Aztec teaches that the present world was preceded by four other cycles of creation and destruction.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  According to official records from commander of Project Nanook, Major Maynard White,
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  the US government discovered in the late 1940s that the Earth undergoes major magnetic flips about every 10,000 to 12,000 years,
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  which causes the surface of the Earth to catastrophically shift in the space of one day.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  This information was officially kept from the public.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  The mysterious Great Pyramid of Giza was built with dimensions that memorialize the golden ratio,
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  Pi and the speed of light, and along with the Sphinx forms a working clock of the Great Year.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  The Great Year is the astronomical cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic,
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  a cycle that repeats just about every 26,000 years,
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  leading many to speculate that the cataclysm is a somewhat fixed event in this cycle of time.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  Many researchers believe that the Great Pyramid, along with several other ancient structures that memorialize the Great Year,
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  were built to warn us about the recurrent cataclysm.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  Our son has its own recurrent cycles, and in almost every cataclysm story throughout history, the son plays a major role.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  Researchers have found 11, 88, 200, and 2,400 year cycles, which involve the oscillation between solar minimum and solar maximum,
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  solar maximum being when the sun exhibits the most sunspot and solar flare.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  Researchers now believe that this cycle leads up to a recurrent nova of our own sun.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  Recurrent novas have been observed all over the night sky.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  The mainstream theory is that stars become congested with atmospheric material
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  and eventually expel this material in an explosive outburst.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  And there is much evidence that our own sun experiences these recurrent novas,
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  which likely is related to the solar flare and sunspot cycles.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  The latest research tells us that the sun is more electrical than it is nuclear fusion,
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  and that it has an electromagnetic relationship with the Earth.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  This would suggest that the magnetic reversals of the Earth occurs when the sun novas.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  And so the big question is, when will that be?
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  Douglas Vogt has been studying this subject for decades and predicts that a recurrent nova will next occur in 2046.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  He arrived at this date based on sun cycles as well as biblical coding.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  The Mayan long count calendar began in 3,113 BC and was marked by days, not years.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  1,872,000 days.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  Nearly all sources brought the Mayan calendar to an end in 2012 by dividing the number of days by 365.24 days in the year.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  But Jason Breshears of Archaics.com points out the fact that prior to 713 BC there were 360 days in the year.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  In 713 BC, all the civilizations of the world changed their calendars to add 5 days.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  In Persia, these extra 5 days became known as the bad luck days.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  In ancient Mexico, the useless days.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  And for the ancient Maya, the unlucky days.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  When we adjust accordingly, we have 864,000 days before the calendar change and 1,008,000 days after,
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  which brings the Mayan calendar to an end in 2046.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  This also raises the question, what happened in 713 BC?
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  According to the Bible, 86,000 people were killed by an angel that year,
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  followed by God moving the sun by 10 degrees.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Perhaps one of these cataclysms occurred that year.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  Ben Davidson of Suspicious Observers has been closely analyzing all this scientific data,
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  and based on the rate of decline of Earth's magnetic field,
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  he concludes that the solar nova will occur between 2040 and 2060.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  This is one of the oldest stories on Earth,
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  and if it is true, then it would explain why so many people are convinced the world is going to end in 20 years.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  It would explain the entire man-made global warming cover story.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  It would explain the United Nations Agenda 2030.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  It would explain why Ray Kurzweil estimated the transhumanist singularity for 2045.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  And it would explain the entire outrageous desperate transhumanist goals of the World Economic Forum.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  For if this is true, it would mean they are attempting to achieve the impossible,
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  maintaining their power throughout the Earth's great reset.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system,
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  And so much of the food is debased.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there,
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  but this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWars.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock

[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  This family that is InfoWars.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  I don't take the credit.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  I give you the credit.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  It isn't going to give up.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  Without your support, we can be shut down.

[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  I don't play with Mr. Health, but if I wasn't taking products like X3 from InfoWars.com, I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.

[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  We're not selling it for that.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.

[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  Well, we know the earth gets hit by big asteroids.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  We know that there are super flares.
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  We know the poles shift and they're a cycle to that and we know we're coming up on that.
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  That's a fact.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  But what I know is if you look at all these ancient societies and these priesthoods that ran them,
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  they would demand sacrifices and total obedience to their cults or the earth would end.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  So the globalists are telling us, we know what they're doing, that the earth's going to die because you're bad and don't turn your life over to us
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  and don't let us run your life and don't let us sterilize you or abort your babies or kill you.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  We know the cosmology they're teaching is at the end of humanity's coming regardless and that's what the whole new world order system is.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  Now, do the globalists, a lot of their secret hidden knowledge actually believe this?
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  I think a lot of them do, but at the higher levels, whether it's going to happen or not, they're not sure.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  Though there's records of this happening before, they want to achieve godhood or what they believe is godhood,
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  merging with silicon to be off-world long before this happens so that if it is true, they can escape it.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  But they don't want us using the resources up in that process.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  They want to get rid of us so there's a little more manageable group left if the poles shift and the power goes off and there's devastation,
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  which evidence shows these events do cause. They don't create the end of the world.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  Ancient civilizations survived them, but they were devastating and they see a large 7.5 billion population,
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  even a 3-4 billion die, the breakdown of civilization and what organizes out of that and new governments and new systems
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  will be a contender for them in the reorganization of the future of humanity and the planet.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  And so any way you slice this, they're preparing for it, they're acting like it's real,
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  and one way or another, they plan to get rid of us regardless.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  And that's really a giant issue, isn't it?
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  And that's why when you look at the London Guardian or the New York Times or the Washington Post, they're like,
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  nuclear war's no big deal, there's too many people, it'll be good for the Earth. Oh, now the hydrogen bombs aren't as radioactive as they used to be.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  If just a few nukes go off, it will cause a global depression and a financial crash. That's their reset.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  If a bunch go off, it gets rid of a bunch of us and then nuclear reactors will melt down, which are giant dirty bombs.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  One reactor that goes down wrong will be like 1,000 hydrogen bombs, the amount of radiation it puts out.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  So anybody believing they can have an organized collapse and get out of it is crazy.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  They should be honest with people, we should be getting ready and organizing society if we think this is real to survive it and mitigate it,
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  and that would empower us, but instead, they're looking at it as an opportunity to get rid of us.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  And so that, my friends, is the rest of the story, and this is not my opinion.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  I've made films about it, I've written books about it.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  It's on record that the globalists are saying a post-human world is here, and that's a good idea.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  I don't think it is.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  Here's Sean Penn and then Neil deGrasse Tyson just the last week.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  Tyson, Friday on Bill Maher, saying nuclear war is really no big deal.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  In fact, they've been saying it's good for the environment, it could cool the planet.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  The dust will throw the atmosphere. Let's play them back to back.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  Indians, we saw and talked to whether they were in uniform, out of uniform, school teachers, even children.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  This extraordinary courage that's come up, and it was in his eyes, and it is clear to me that the Ukrainians will win this.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  The question is at what cost?
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  Did they have, in those early hours, I know that Trump gave them Chavlins,
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  I know that they had some defenses, but if you go back to the Budapest Agreement,
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  they were at the time the third largest nuclear power in the world.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  They made an agreement that they'd give those weapons to Russia to be destroyed in exchange for protection from Russia, Great Britain and the U.S.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  The lesson to be learned here, don't give up your nuclear weapons if you have them, because you can't believe people like Vladimir Putin.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  Even countries that have nuclear weapons can remain intimidated to use them, and we're seeing that now with our own country.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  And I fear what that legacy is going to be. We don't want, no one wants to see a nuclear conflict.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  I don't want to see one.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  At the same time, if only one bully is going to be able to use those weapons as a threat, we've got to rethink what we're doing.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  See, I think the West made a mistake in this build-up that Putin, as he brought in,
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  Alright, so we'll go to Tyson here in a moment, but Sean Penn believes in total gun confiscation of the American people,
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  believes in handing out machine guns to school kids in Ukraine.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  He's a parasite. He's an anti-American. He hates this country. He wants to take over Russia.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  So just remember that. There he is saying we shouldn't be afraid to use nuclear weapons.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  Neil deGrasse Tyson is even more obvious with it. Here it is.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  See them wearing masks outside.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  My question was, if we can do that, if we can hit the asteroid, could we do that with nuclear weapons?
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  Because it's getting a little chippy out there with Putin.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  And I don't, you know, I mean, I love Ukraine, but do I love them enough to get radiated?
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  But you can't do nothing, right? I mean, if in fact there's a tactical nuke that's used by Putin,
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  obviously there needs to be a response.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  Well, plus modern nukes don't have the radiation problem, just to be clear.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  Really?
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  You still blow to smithereens, but yeah, it's a different kind of weapon than the Hiroshima Nagasaki.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  Nuclear weapons, if they're exploded, don't have a radiation problem?
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  Not if there's hydrogen bombs. No. Not in the way that we used to have to worry about it with fallout and all the rest of that.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  What you really have to worry about is being vaporized, and after that, if you're not vaporized, blown to bits by the shockwave.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  That's a way bigger problem that you're going to have.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  By the way, none of that's true.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  They're not as radioactive as earlier weapons, and they also have what they call dirty bombs that are hydrogen bombs
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  or other systems jacketed in different isotopes to create radiation,
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  but it's the nuclear reactors dumbass on the ground.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  When the power goes out, they'll melt down, and then they cause massive radiation.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  So everywhere, they're trying to sell the fact that nuclear war is not a problem.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  In fact, type in the headline, a limited nuclear war would stop global warming,
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  or it's time to use nukes against Putin, and the Pentagon has said that.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  This is insanity.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  Just what it'll do to the economy is off the chart, dangerous.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  And every number we look at, every different contingency plan, every different war game shows
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  a more than 50% chance, if tactical nukes are used by either side, it will quickly go to a theater war,
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  a regional war with nukes, and then, Katie, bar the door, it's almost 100% chance.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  If you go to that, you see, 50% chance or so, you go to a full regional war,
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  and once you have a regional, it's almost 100%, you go full commitment in a strategic nuclear war.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  Hell, a small nuclear war would transform the entire planet.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  There's your headlines.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  And that's not even the headline I was looking for.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  There's a bunch of them where they say, nuclear war is a good thing.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  Hell, the Pentagon says it's survivable now, and I guess in their deep underground bases it is.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  All right, Robert Stone is not coming on about the January 6th fiasco.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  He's not coming on about, you know, all that BS we know is crap, but it ties into that.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  He's coming on to talk about the election.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  I called him this morning, one of the smartest political analysts I know,
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  and I said, are we really ahead as Republicans?
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  He said, absolutely, but a lot can happen in 22 days.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  And I said, please come on.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  He said, well, I'll know more next week.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  I said, look, you don't have to be 100%.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  Just give us right now what you see and what you really think on the midterm between two days now.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  So I'll be back with us next week, and then building up a lot almost every day going in for the election.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  But today, he joins us to talk about these numbers and what's coming out
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  and what he sees unfolding there with Roger Stone.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  But the globalists want you to give up on your life force.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  They want you to accept the end of the world.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  They want you to believe you're all about to be killed, and that's a good thing.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  Don't buy into their height.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  Keep living, keep building, keep striving, and keep promoting peace
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  and rejecting the left that wants nuclear war and pedophilia.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge to the spirit.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  And when we talk about the products in infomercial.com, they all blow you away.

[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  that supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.

[1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  It's our best seller.
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system,
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  Essential means without these things, you die.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  And so much of the food is debased.
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  But this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the info war.

[1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:59.000]  Look, it's not hype that info wars has changed the world.
[1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  It's not hype that your support of info wars is the reason we were able to do this.
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge yourselves,
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:19.000]  it doesn't just give you more energy, it doesn't just boost your immune system.
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:25.000]  But it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for x3 to kick in on average.

[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:03.000]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist.
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  Yes, I've persevered.
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  But the listeners and viewers who support info wars are the real reason you have the success.
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new war we've ever had.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  God bless you all.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:45.000]  I salute you.
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  I thank you.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this is happening.
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight.
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  God bless you all.
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  Alright, Neil de Kries Tyson is a blowhard.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  He's articulate. He's interesting. He's funny. I like how he comes off.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  But so much of what he says is pure crap.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  He said we can basically survive a nuclear war previously on Bill Maher last Friday.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  He said now the nuclear weapons we have that Russia have and China have are clean and there's not any radiation.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  Well, I'm somebody that happens to have studied nuclear weapons quite a bit since I was young.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  And I know quite a bit about them and I've done research on them and I've had a lot of top experts on.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  So I want to explain something to everybody.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  Russian doctrine in a full-on nuclear war is to use ICBMs with multiple Merv reentry device systems
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  jacketed in cobalt and other metals that cause incredible nuclear radiation that kills you in a matter of minutes and that lasts billions of years.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  Now Russia has confirmed this and they built, this is Forbes, last year's Dirty Bomb Robo Sub.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  It's filled with nuclear weapons but it itself blows up with the power of more than 10,000 Hiroshima or Nakasaki's
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  and the whole thing is jacketed in isotopes to radiate the entire United States.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  Now you may have heard of this before. It's in the movie Dr. Strange Love by Stanley Kubrick, The Doomsday Bomb.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  And you learn basically by the end the U.S. had built the Doomsday Bomb and the Russians had created one but they hadn't told each other yet.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  But the whole point is to tell people you haven't. The Russians told us years ago they haven't, now they've rolled it out.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  And of course the U.S. has these too. We don't just have that, since the 60s we've had what they call neutron bombs.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  Now that's what the idiot Neil's Tyson, DeGrasse Tyson's talking about.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  That is a air burst low yield weapon that is a radiation pulse that kills all life but not the structures and has low radioactive fallout.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  And yes, the U.S. and others have that as a depopulation weapon.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  They're called neutron bombs, totally separate from a dirty bomb.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  We're not talking about a dirty bomb where somebody steals X-ray equipment, traps explosives to it to make everybody breathe some radiation.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  I'm talking about the Doomsday Bomb.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  I'm done talking about it. Just Neil's, DeGrasse Tyson is just so full of crap, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  But it's all over the leftist media now selling us in World War III. And so I called Roger this morning, I wanted his opinion.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  And he went off into January 6th and now they're trying to railroad everybody and I know he's right and he's totally innocent, so am I.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  We'll hit a little bit of that last segment. I said, Roger, you're really a famous political pundit.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  Everything you've told about politics has turned out to be accurate. Can I please fit you on in the next 22 days a lot to talk about the election?
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  And he said, okay, I'll come on, but I don't have all the answers yet.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  He says it's leaning towards Republicans, looks good, but who knows, 22 days is a lifetime.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  But he is a father and grandfather and a smart guy, geopolitically as well.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  What do you make just briefly of Ukraine, the pipeline, the escalation, the saber rattling about nuclear war, the bridge being blown up and all this craziness.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  Then we'll segue into this critical midterm.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  Well, Alex, you just listed an entire list of events and developments that could very well affect the upcoming election.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  I think that's exactly the point. The electorate is extraordinarily volatile.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  The election, I believe, is 23 days away, if I count correctly.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  Those who want to declare victory in the House or the Senate or in any particular race today would be doing so prematurely.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  Because as we have seen so far, events in Ukraine, events in the United States, such as the Supreme Court action on Roe v. Wade, such as the outrageous raid on Mar-Lago over presidential documents,
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  to a lesser extent, the January 6th Committee, all of these things can affect the election.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  The surge in crime in New York State, for example, is affecting that election.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  So it's very important as people look at what's happening to understand that as they look at polling, that there are polls and then there are polls.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  What I mean by that is a poll can be manipulated to show anything the pollster wants it to show.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  A real pollster is looking for an unbiased, unvarnished, honest assessment of the election at that exact moment of time.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  Meaning our politics are so volatile that by the time the poll is taken and tabulated and published, it is already slightly out of date.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  A poll can be manipulated by the size of the sample, by the balance of the sample.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  Too many Democrats, too many Republicans, too many men, too many women, too many minorities in terms of being an accurate reflection of the electorate.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  It can be manipulated through the wording of the questions.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  It can be manipulated through the order of the questions, and therefore I tend to look at two or three specific pollsters whose methodology I respect,
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  who I believe are not trying to cook the polls for a predetermined result to boost fundraising, for example.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  Well, that's right, even if you're trying to tell the truth and being scientific, it's hard to nail it because things are so volatile in samples, again, or just that sample.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  So from the current numbers that we know are always a few weeks old, we always give them a few weeks later, a snapshot, say, from two weeks ago that we're learning today, where is the election today?
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  Well, for example, all polling is directional.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  In other words, you have to, instead of just looking at one poll, look at the history of a specific poll and look at the trend line.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  This is why, for example, the Friday before the election on 2016, I knew that Donald Trump was going to win.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  Because looking at state Republican Party polls in Ohio, in Florida, in Michigan, in Wisconsin, I could see a clear trend line to Donald Trump.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  And there was no cataclysmic event that was going to change that trend line.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  If you go by the current trend line, particularly in these Senate races, Ohio, Arizona, even Georgia, we can come back and talk about that, the trend is towards the Republicans.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  If you look at the trend line in individual house races, the trend line is towards Republicans.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  Now, if you say that too much, you feed into overconfidence, and overconfidence can still cost the GOP this election.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  Nobody should be sitting home saying, oh, there's going to be a massive red wave.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  I don't need to tell my aunt Tilly to come back from vacation to vote.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  No, we need every single vote.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  And a lesson of the Arizona primaries, Alex, is vote on election day.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  Vote in person on election day.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  That way, those who do manipulate elections in certain states, they don't know how many votes they have to create or try to create because they don't know what the final result will be.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  When you vote in early voting or you vote in mail-in voting, those who would manipulate the election results, I'm sorry, that does happen in some states, they have some precursors, some inkling of what they need to dump or what they need to steal among the electorate.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  So people need to count nothing for granted.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  Things are looking good because the Democrats' efforts to divert people to issues that no one cares about are failing.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  The issues in this election are gasoline prices, they are food shortages, they are the highest inflation rate in recent history.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  They are the fact that we just shipped another $75 billion to Ukraine, inching this country to the brink of nuclear war.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  But we can't spend the money to seal our own border to stop the fentanyl crisis that is exploding across the country.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  Those kinds of issues actually affect people's daily lives, whereas issues like the January 6th Commission or the documents that Donald Trump may or may not have, those don't affect any voters' lives whatsoever.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  We're going to talk about that when we come back because I said let's not get into our problems, but then I raised it myself. Clearly they try to use Alex Jones' Sandy Hook in January 6th and Roger Stone as political red meat distractions, it's not working.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  And even Obama and the Democrats have now come out and told the Democrats they're in charge right now, knock it off, stop going after Trump and Roger Stone and Alex Jones, it's not working.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions is now happening.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  Info wars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air.
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  It's unsustainable.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  So please visit saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, five, ten, fifty hundred dollars, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  Thank you for your support.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  Wouldn't be without you.

[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle of the globalist. I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support info wars are the real reason you have the success.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify it.
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  God bless you all.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  I salute you.
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  I thank you.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  And it funds the info war.
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  So many of you are on the fence.

[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  Roger Jones, our guest here on the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  Another huge guest I'll tell you about once he joins us in the next hour.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  That has beyond critical information concerning nuclear war.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  But the globalists are up to plus the latest in the poisoned shots.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  The criminal investigations have now begun in the EU.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  But Roger, what is Obama who we know along with some other globalists really runs Biden?
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  What is he thinking whenever they push the whole George Floyd Black Lives Matter
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  George Soros thing, they push the fund police, then that backfires on them.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  And now Saki and Obama and a bunch of Democrats are out there on the news.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  And we're seeing, you know, stop with the January 6th.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  Stop with the political correctness.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  Say your law and order for now.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  Back off this, it's a losing formula.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  That makes it look like actually maybe somebody else is in charge.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  Or is that Obama playing good cop, bad cop?
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  Looks anyone about Barack Obama, he's a shrewd political strategist.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  He beat Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination when she had all of the advantages.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  He also managed to get himself reelected, despite an abysmal record.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  And if you notice recently, Alex, now suddenly Joe Biden is talking about the fact that
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  if Republicans win, they're going to cut Social Security.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  They're going to cut Medicaid.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  This is right out of the Democratic Democrat Party playbook.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  That's a sign of desperation when they've got to fall back on those old bugaboos that nobody believes.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  Then he goes so far to say, well, if you think the economy is bad now,
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  if you think prices are high now, way to the Republicans get in there.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  How stupid does Joe Biden think we are?
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  Two short years ago, we had the lowest inflation rate in recent history.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  We had a boom economy.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  We had record job creation.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  We had record wage growth.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  We had billions of dollars coming back into the country to be invested here.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  We had the lowest levels of unemployment among African Americans,
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  among women, among Asians, among young people, among all groups just two years ago.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  So it's not credible to say, oh, if you think things are bad now based completely on their actions,
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  think how much worse it will be under the Republicans.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  People aren't that stupid.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  They can remember how good things were under President Donald Trump.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  Well, I got to tell you what I'm seeing on the street.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  I mean, I have a lot of friends that have been liberals and Democrats.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  I didn't discriminate against them because they were as a populist and a conservative over the years.
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  But they're all apologizing to me.
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  Everybody I know has liberal friends.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  They're apologizing to them, whether they're black, white, Hispanic, Asian.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  On the ground around the country, I'm getting more love than ever.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  And the Democrats have made me this Satan and that's only made me more proper with conservatives
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  and even more proper with the average liberals.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  In fact, Roger, the level of love I'm getting is just over the top.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  I see that as an indicator is if they've branded me as the devil incarnate
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  and I'm getting more love than ever, that looks like people see me as a rebel against the system
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  and so they give me love and that's what I'm getting.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  I'm too certain that I'm feeling the same thing.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  I look, I'm not going to get into this, but they're so frustrated by the fact that the January 6th committee hearing last week
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  provided no evidence whatsoever against me.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  Roger, Roger, stop, stop. You're welcome to get into it.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  I just wanted you to do what you're a thoroughbred at, strategy, but this is part of the campaign focusing on January 6th.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  So now let's get into it.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  Yeah, it's pretty simple and I'm not going to spend a lot of time on it.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  There's a whole bunch of fake, deep state videos out there or deep fake videos
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  that are being very aggressively pushed.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  Look who's pushing them. Vice, Vanity Fair, The Daily Beast, The Business Insider.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  That's all you need to know.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  I'm ultimately going to bring a lawsuit, a multi-count civil lawsuit against these Danish filmmakers
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  who I can now reveal were definitely financed by the Danish government.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  I believe through their intelligence agency, but no voter cares about any of this, Alex.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  So let's go through some of these states because I think it's important.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  I watched Blake Masters in that debate in Arizona.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  I thought that he did a masterful job, pardon the expression.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  But then you read the media stories and it says if they saw a different debate than I saw.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  I think Blake Masters is going to win. I think Kerry Lake is going to win.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  I think Blake Masters is also going to win. I think her campaign is going to be helpful to him.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  Herschel Walker benefited extraordinarily from low expectation levels.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  The media had so vilified him going into the debate, he was expected to fall flat on his face.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  He more than stuck to his key points.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  He stood up for the sanctity of life. I've never seen an oiler or con man than the pastor Raphael Warnock.
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  This guy is very, very slippery.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  But I thought that in all honesty, Herschel Walker breathed life back into his campaign.
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  That race is still today skin tight.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  So the media's efforts to basically write Herschel Walker off only days ago as finished are completely wrong.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  Herschel Walker can most definitely still win.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  I think he benefits from the fact that Governor Kemp is going to be Stacey Abrams, the election denier.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  Yet again, I think that is helpful to him.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  But Georgia still very, very much within our grasp.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  In Ohio, J.D. Vance outclassed his opponent Kelly in the debate.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  Yet again, I think that that is another race that we will win.
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  A race that I'm concerned about, to be honest with you, is Florida.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  Based on his bold and I think very strong and effective handling of this natural disaster of the hurricane.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  I now think Governor DeSantis is in good shape.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  I think that he will win by a larger margin than I would have predicted pre hurricane.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  But I am concerned about Marco Rubio.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  You remember him, Alex?
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  He's the guy who doesn't know who you are.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  Remember him?
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  In any event, he's running.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  He is not running a very good campaign.
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  He should be sticking to our popular governor like glue.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  They should be out there together day in and day out.
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  They are.
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  He seems to be running a completely electronic media campaign, but you're not seeing him on the hustings.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  And Val Demings, who is Florida's version of Stacey Abrams, a former police chief of Orange County,
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  who lost her service revolver when she left it in her car and left the car unlocked,
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  now wants to be trusted with a Senate seat.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  That said, she is outraised Rubio.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  She has out-campaigned Rubio.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  She is attempting to now move to the center.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  This is a race that I'm concerned about.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  Marco Rubio is not my cup of tea in terms of the fact that he's a neocon and a rhino.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  But control of the Senate is crucial.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  And I will be voting for Marco Rubio, as will every member of my family.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  I wish he would step up his campaigning in these final weeks.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  Let's talk about the elephant in the room.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  There are attempts to indict Trump.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  And I know you talked to the big guy quite a bit.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  And, I mean, he was saying, months ago, he's going to an ounce soon.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  They said he would run, which is really saying he is running.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  Any word on that?
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  Kind of.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  Look, as you know, I don't divulge the direct conversations I have with the former president
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  because that's the best single way to have them not continue.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  He's very optimistic and bullish about the upcoming elections.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  He knows that his rallies in Arizona and in Nevada have been extraordinarily effective.
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  I should mention Nevada as another race that I'm concerned about.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  I know Adam Laxall. I knew his grandfather, Paul Laxall, U.S. Senator, Governor,
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  President Ronald Reagan, literally his best friend, a great, great man.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  Adam's a good man as well.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  He lost a previous governor's race.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  But any time you're leading in Nevada by a point and a half,
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  you have to be concerned about the Clark County Democratic Machine.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  These people make the old daily machine in Chicago look like a bunch of pikers
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  when it comes to theft.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  Well, that's right. Roger, stay there. We've got to go to break.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  We're going to come right back and I want to ask you about how will election fraud,
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  organized election fraud, be a major factor in this?
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  And what do you expect to happen if Democrats do apparently steal some of these races?
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  We'll come right back with five more months with Roger Stone.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  And Roger, you've got a bunch of websites.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  You tell me, one of them now is the site to go to.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  Where do people find everything, Roger Stone?
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  StoneZone.com is my new site. StoneZone.com. Check it out.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  Stone Cold Truth will just forward you there if it hasn't it soon will.

[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  All right, stay there. We'll talk about the key to the election straight ahead.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  And then our special guest joins us, who we'll surprise you with coming up.

[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.

[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  We want to know how cold blood is a globalist star with people like
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  Biden killing our pipelines, not letting us drill more wells.
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  And then going to Saudi Arabia to now come out and saying,
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  you can cut output just after the election.
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  He's not lobbying for America.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  He's not lobbying for American consumers or energy users.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  He's lobbying for the globalists that want to shut this country off.
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  But when it's happening too fast, he gets the blame, suddenly he wants it to stop.
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  That's the name of the game.
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  You expose the globalists from behind the policies.
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  They will stop doing the policies, but they can just act like the policies aren't them.
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  They'll keep pushing them.
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  Here's a great example at a town hall.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  Obama tells Democrats to get over the obsession with Trump and the political correctness,
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  though the people that he's involved with and works with, they are running this Psyop.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  So there's the Hollywood darling up there at the top running the Psyop,
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  now trying to claim his policies aren't his policies.
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  That to me is really, really important, Roger.
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  Can you speak to that in closing, looking at the evidence of the massive election fraud?
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  We know we saw two years ago.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  What you're expecting this time?
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  Well, first of all, it's very important that you can't just scream election fraud if you lose.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  You have to have absolutely solid, documented proof.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  You can't just say, oh, well, more people showed up at my rallies than at my opponent's rallies.
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  Therefore, there must have been voter fraud.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  It doesn't really work that way.
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  So anybody who sees a situation in which there's strong indications of fraud based on anomalies or regularities,
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  they have to have really stone cold proof, the kind of proof that would hold up in court.
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:59.000]  Going back to your other question, I still think that President Trump will run in 2024.
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  I still think it is conceivable that, I don't know, he could announce the Saturday before this election,
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  which would have an electrifying effect on the election itself.
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  And thinking outside of the box, I think his running mate, in all honesty, should be Kanye West.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  You want to completely shake up and change the electorate?
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  There's a ticket I could really get behind now.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  I'm for the president.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  I would be very clear about that.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  But if you want to see the globalists and the political establishment go out of their minds,
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  put forward a Trump West ticket.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  Well, and other friends, do you think Trump and Kanye would go for it together?
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  Look, I can't speculate about that.
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  But when it comes to his fealty to Jesus Christ, his strong position on life,
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  his outspoken opposition to the cancel culture and censorship,
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  I think he'd be an extraordinarily interesting candidate.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  And that's the thing about politics.
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  If you're not interesting, if you're boring, the voters go elsewhere.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  People couldn't believe that Trump, a businessman who never held office, could win. He did.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  This could be the two businessman, both pro-America, both free speech, candidacy.
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  That's a pretty good idea.
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  Have you told Trump the idea?
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  I'm not going to comment on that, but two strong Christians.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  Look, I like to think outside the box, but I think it would electrify the electorate,
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  and it would change 100 years of history.
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  I just throw it out there as an idea.
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  But I think it's intriguing.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  Here's what I do know.
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  If people have a choice between Kanye West and Kamala Harris, I think I know what they would choose.
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  Well, absolutely.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  I think it's a great idea.
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  So we need the Trump West ticket.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  Yeah, let's see who can get the t-shirts up and out faster, you or me.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  You know what?
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  That's an idea.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  We haven't put a t-shirt out in a while.
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  I'm going to put on a Trump West 2024 shirt.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  You can do it too.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  I'm stealing your idea because you just gave me permission.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  Look, I thought that was an electrifying interview.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  And I also love the guy's music.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  He reaches out to millennials, he reaches out to a whole younger group of voters
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  that Republicans can't normally reach.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  And now they're trying to cancel West.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  I have a prediction they've been off more than they could shoot.
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  Yeah, he is so huge that it's a gigantic mistake.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  Breaking news today is that he is buying Parlor, where I have 345,000 followers,
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  but I've been shadow banned since their change of ownership.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  I hope that that's true.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  I pray that it's true because we need an alternative to Twitter.
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  Twitter is a sewer of hatred, violence, and...
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  It is.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  Roger Stone, thank you so much.
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  Talk to you next week.
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  We'll be right back with our special guest.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  It's our best seller.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system,
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  that you need to live and be healthy.
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  And so much of the food is debased.
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there,
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  but this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the infill war.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:51.000]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:55.000]  finally back in stock at infillwarstore.com for a 50% off.
[2:05:55.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  Vitamin Refusion, back in stock, infillwarstore.com.
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've got one of the top researchers and minds out there
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  on chemical, biological, and radiological war.
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:51.000]  He wrote the U.S. Law on Chemical and Biological War.
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  He was a top U.N. war crimes prosecutor.
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  He's also a leading lawyer.
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:57.000]  He's a special Ph.D.
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  They only get about one a year from Harvard.
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  The same one Henry Kissinger and others got dealing with how to control the New World Order,
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  but he was a mole of the people.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  Professor Francis A. Boyle joins us.
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  He normally comes on to talk about in the last, almost three years,
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  the Wuhan lab, the gain of function, and the whole situation with the unfolding franken shots,
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  as he calls them.
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  And we'll cover that coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:31.000]  But the reason I've known him for over 20 years is his expertise on weapons proliferation,
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  war, and the security state.
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  So Professor Francis A. Boyle joins us.
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  He's also written a book, The Criminality of Nuclear Deterrence,
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  Could the U.S. War on Terrorism Go Nuclear?
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  And now we've seen not just Sean Penn, not just Neal's The Grass Tyson,
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  but the London Guardian, the New York Times, Washington Post.
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  I mean, I can't even turn the computer on without just articles everywhere about nuclear war is not a big deal.
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  Oh, it's not radioactive anymore.
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  Oh, it's not a problem.
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  We can have a nuclear war.
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  And so this is a very dangerous moment in world history.
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  I think the most dangerous.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  We've got Biden talking about Armageddon.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  You've got Putin saying he's not bluffing.
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  This is a serious situation.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  So Professor Francis A. Boyle joins us.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  Thank you so much for being here with us today, sir.
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  And let's lay out the facts.
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:27.000]  Well, thank you very much for having me on, Alex, and my best to your viewing audience.
[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  Yes, it's an extremely dangerous,
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  existentially dangerous moment as we speak today.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  Biden and NATO have just launched two weeks of massive nuclear war operations there in Europe, as we speak today.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  And as you know, we now have a de facto, not yet de jure,
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  but a de facto state of war between the United States and NATO on the one hand and Russia on the other.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  So I can't underestimate the dangers of the situation that is facing us now.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  Again, we haven't seen anything this dangerous since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  And I would say since these massive NATO nuclear war maneuvers are going on for the next two weeks,
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  this is going to be the 13 days all over again.
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  Those who don't know a lot of new listeners and people that are just getting into history and politics,
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  they don't know what about the Cuban Missile Crisis or the 13 days in May and the rest of it.
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  But let's just have the record skip here for a moment and go back to what you said is it's true.
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  Russia says it, NATO even admits it, but it's in the paperwork.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  It's not being announced officially.
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  We are de facto at war with Russia right now.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  And the average person is just going about their business like there's not a care in the world.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  We are de facto at war.
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  Yes, Alex.
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  And I was number one in my class at Harvard Law School with the world's leading expert on the laws of war.
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  And right now we are in a de facto state of war with Russia over Ukraine.
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  And President Biden has no authorization from the United States Congress to go to war against Russia.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  And this violates the War Powers Clause of the United States Constitution and the War Powers Resolution of 1973.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  You know, that's a great point.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  Big deals were made about George Herbert Walker Bush and others in Clinton launching a few cruise missile strikes,
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  which I was against, you know, in Africa or the Middle East, and both parties would make a deal against the other party that they didn't get congressional authorization.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  We're going headlong in a nuclear war, over a hundred billion dollars sent over there right now.
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  And there's no discussion of how this totally violates the Constitution.
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  That is correct.
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  Again, the War Powers Clause of the Constitution says quite clearly only Congress can declare war.
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  And then that has been implemented by the War Powers Resolution of 1973 that Biden is also violating.
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  And for this reason, I have drawn up a draft bill of impeachment against Biden that is now in circulation on Capitol Hill.
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  I already had a 30-minute conversation with one member of Congress about introducing my bill of impeachment.
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  We went through the three articles of impeachment.
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  He agreed with my analysis and said he was inclined to do it.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  But we'll see what happens right now.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  Congress is not in session.
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  And Dr. Boy, let me stop you again, because usually we reach out to you.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  You reach out to us on the war issue.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  You probably sent it to us, but if not, resend it during the break so we can post it at infowars.com.
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  And so we can read through this.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  Hopefully you can read some of it on air because this is a big deal.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  You have a lot of gravitas, and you helped stop the experimental anthrac shots and so much.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  So you've had a good try of getting Congress to listen.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  This is a big deal that you're circulating articles of impeachment on Capitol Hill.
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  That's certainly good news.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  Well, right, Alex.
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  For the record, again, I don't wish to toot my own horn here.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  But I also draft, I did the first draft of the impeachment resolution against President Bush Sr.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  That was introduced into Congress by the late Congressman Henry B. Gonzalez down there in Texas, where you are.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  And he and former Attorney General Ramsey Clark and I launched a campaign to impeach Bush Sr.
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  over, go for one, but as I said, I'm a political independent.
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  And here it does seem to me, based upon previous experience here, that Biden has reached the stage of impeachable offenses over this issue.
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  And someone needs to put a bill of impeachment in right away to send a shot across Biden's bow that he better cease and desist from getting us into a desurer war.
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  Sure.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  And the good news is, National polls show upwards of 85% of Republicans and Democrats are against this war.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  People instinctively know this is wrong, not just the money, but the danger.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  So it's a win-win for Republicans and Democrats to say no to Biden and no to the neocons.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  And we see Biden's people being shouted down across the country by liberals finally waking up and saying, we don't need to look nuclear war led by Tulsi Gabbard's leaving the party.
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  Right.
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  And Tulsi Gabbard, as you know, was the leading figure in the Democratic Party for peace.
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  And she just resigned saying, as she sees it, the Democratic Party has now become an elitist cabal of war markers.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  But there's no support in the American people for a war against Russia in general or over Ukraine in particular.
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  And yet the Bidenites are going full speed ahead.
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  Blinken just announced on Friday he's sending more high-tech weapons over there to Ukraine.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  And as of today, Biden and his people have commenced these massive nuclear war maneuvers against Russia.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  What do you think Russia is going to think about this?
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  It calls to mind the able archer nuclear war exercises under Reagan that the Russians interpreted.
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  We were going to attack them and they began to proceed to respond accordingly.
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  So it's a very dangerous situation.
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  We already have this de facto war with Russia.
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  And now Biden and the Bidenites and NATOs have commenced these major.
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  For those that don't know history like you do, we should just remind them.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  When you do sneak attack somebody, whether it was Hitler or the Communist Russians or the U.S. in many cases,
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  whether you're good guys or bad guys, they usually use drills as a smoke screen when you finally launch your real attack
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  so your enemy is lulled into a sense of security.
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  And by the way, Dr. Boil did send us the Articles of Impeachment.
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  I hadn't read the whole folder they gave me this morning.
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  And I apologize, we're going to have these Articles of Impeachment posted to the front page as its own article on Infowars.com
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  and under the live show Feed.
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  And we'll have a headline Articles of Impeachment circulated in Congress
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  or Congress looking at Articles of Impeachment against President Biden.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  We'll get the headline from Boil and we'll come back with it.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  Think about a world without Infowars.
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:08.000]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together,
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  this family that is Infowars.
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  Think about how Infowars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  I don't take the credit.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  I give you the credit.
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  And now Infowars is facing its darkest hours and isn't going to give up.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  Without your support we can be shut down.

[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  and they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.

[2:19:59.000 --> 2:20:09.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:20.000]  Under Francis Boyle, one of the leading geopolitical experts in the world on warfare,
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:23.000]  chemical, biological, radiological, is our guest.
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  And he has been successful in getting articles of impeachment introduced before.
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  Regardless, we need this is a litmus test to force the issue against Republicans
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  to show the warmongers and neocons are. And a lot of Democrats are waiting for leadership,
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  like we've seen from Tulsi Gabbard's, resigning out of the party.
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  We need people protesting. We need phone calls to Congress.
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  We need to let them know that we're not going to sleepwalk into Armageddon.
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  So we're going to post these articles of impeachment at Infowars.com as we speak.
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  They're being circulated in Capitol Hill, but you can supercharge them.
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  This is a major action item for listeners and viewers.
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:20:59.000]  I think of the highest order it goes without saying.
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  So Dr. Boyle, I interrupted a lot last segment just to have you dial in what you were saying.
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  It was so important. I don't want to just glaze over how big this is.
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  But for those that don't know Latin, as a lawyer and a professor,
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  do you want to explain what de facto means?
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  Because it's not official, but it's still the exact same thing.
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  Right. Alex, there's a distinction between de facto, as a matter of fact,
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  and de jure, as a matter of law.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  And right now, as a matter of fact, there is a war between the United States
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  and NATO on the one hand and Russia on the other.
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:43.000]  Indeed, even the New York Times reported that there are U.S. Special Forces
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  currently fighting in Ukraine itself that would clearly be governed by
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:55.000]  the War Powers Resolution of 1973 and the War Powers Clause
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  and Biden of the Constitution.
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  And Biden has no authority and currently is in violation
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  of those sources of authorities as well as the other mentioned in my bill
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  of impeachment. I also wanted to point out, in addition to the 30-minute conversation
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  I had with the member of Congress who agreed with my analysis
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  and said he was inclined to do it, I had a 45-minute conversation
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  with the top staffer of another member of Congress who agreed with my analysis
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  and said that she would talk about it with her member
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:42.000]  and also with the top staffer for a third member of Congress for 30 minutes.
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  He agreed with my analysis and said he would discuss the matter with his
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:53.000]  member of Congress. So yes, the draft bill of impeachment is there,
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:58.000]  circulated on Capitol Hill. It's been brought to the attention of every other
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  member of the United States Congress, but so far I've had these three
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  very positive conversations.
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  Well, thank you for getting the ball rolling. It's now time for our listeners
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  to get it and send it themselves and supercharge this because, again,
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  as I said, over 85% of Americans are against this damn war.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  That's right. There's opposition, massive opposition among the American people,
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  even propelling Tulsi Gabbard to resign from the Democratic Party.
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  I think her conclusion that it's being run by, you know,
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  a leaders' cabal of war mongers is correct.
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  But I did want to say, Alex, that as I've told these three Congresspeople,
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  I am willing to serve pro bono publico, free of charge,
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:50.000]  as consultant, advisor, lawyer, or any member of Congress
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:55.000]  who wants to introduce a bill of impeachment against Biden on these
[2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  grounds in order to prevent a war against Russia. Yes.
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:02.000]  And talk about some of what you've given them in briefings and other key points
[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  people should know about what this would look like because we're seeing a major
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  push by the media as a talking point that nuclear war is really not that big a deal.
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:13.000]  Might it be good for global warming, Dr. Boyle?
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  Well, this is pure insanity, Alex.
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  I started studying nuclear weapons with the late great Hans Morgenthau
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  on January 5, 1970, in his basic course on international relations.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  He's considered to be the founder of international political science
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:39.000]  and even a mentor to Henry Kissinger.
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  And Morgenthau just thought even tactical nuclear warfare,
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  which is what they are talking about now, is pure insanity that would result
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  in escalation to strategic nuclear war between then the Soviet Union
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  and now the United States. I regret to report that Kissinger
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  wrote a book advocating limited nuclear warfare.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  I went through, as you know, the same PhD program at Harvard
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  that produced Kissinger that gave me his own office.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  But Morgenthau thought this notion of limited nuclear warfare was pure insanity.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  And that's what is being discussed now, limited nuclear warfare
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  as if it were just a walk in the park.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  And for those that don't, you know, research this and have a degree in it,
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  for people that don't know, because I read a lot of the white papers myself,
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  in every major scenario, tactical almost always escalates to theater
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  and then theater always escalates to a wide war.
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  That is correct. And indeed, as I brought to the attention of these three members of Congress,
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  you need to have a look at our Herman Kahn's Ladder of Escalation,
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  where Kahn was, you know, one of these Dr. Strangelove types.
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  And he wrote a book called On Escalation, which I had to read to get my PhD there at Harvard.
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  And he goes through the different stages of escalation leading to a spasmonic nuclear war.
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  And I think right now, last time I looked, we're about stage 16 or something like that.
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  So we're moving up the ladder.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  Now we have these massive NATO nuclear war operations going on right now.
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  So we're moving up Kahn's Ladder of Escalation.
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  Right. But it is, as you correctly pointed out, step by step.
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  You could pull up Herman Kahn there on Wikipedia and you'll see his Ladder of Escalation.
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  I provided that to the three Congress people here I was dealing with and saying,
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  we're moving up this ladder. Yes.
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  What are the geopolitical New World Order Anglo-American establishment wonks thinking
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  when every analysis they've ever done, every war game the Pentagon's done,
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  shows that this always leads to at least economic collapse, wider wars,
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  and usually leads to total destruction of human life.
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  I mean, what are they playing with fire like this for?
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  Well, Alex, I think they're going for a brawl.
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  It's clear this goes back, I think, to the Brzezinski strategy.
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  I went through the same PhD program at Harvard that produced Brzezinski before me.
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  And the Brzezinski strategy was to use first Afghanistan to collapse the Soviet Union
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  and then to use Ukraine to collapse the Soviet Union.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  That by starting a war against Russia in Ukraine,
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  they could bleed Russia dry and force its collapse, force regime change.
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  And if possible, yes, that's it right there,
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  to force the collapse of Russia into its constituent units.
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  So they believe that this can be done.
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  Brzezinski has been the top guru in foreign affairs and defense policy
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  since the Carter administration.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  Indeed, even before that, Brzezinski was chairman of the Trilateral Commission
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  for David Rockefeller.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  And it was Brzezinski and Rockefeller who recruited co-opted Carter to run for the presidency.
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  Brzezinski became his national security advisor and picked all the foreign affairs
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  and defense people in that administration.
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  And then he repeated it for me.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  Stay right there. This is so critical.
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  Supercharges, your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.

[2:31:17.000 --> 2:31:22.000]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.

[2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:36.000]  and I can't fund those myself.
[2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:38.000]  It's unsustainable.

[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:37.000]  Dr. Francis Coyle, expert on warfare and the history of it,
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  and went to the same level of school as the top people that created the current battle plans
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:45.000]  that are following to a tee is our guest.
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  He was getting cut off by the break, getting into Herman Kahn,
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:54.000]  one of the top people developing these strategies, who developed a ladder,
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  escalation ladder that starts number one with a sensible crisis,
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:02.000]  number two, political, economic and diplomatic gestures,
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  number three, solemn and formal declarations,
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:08.000]  number four, hardening of positions, confrontation of wills,
[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:12.000]  number five, show of force, number six, significant mobilization,
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  and you go through this, this is exactly what's happening.
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  And then by the end of it, you end with spasms of intense war,
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  just no more coordination, total release, everybody's killed on planet Earth,
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  just total insanity.
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  As he was saying, we're up to about 17 or 18 right now, limited escalations,
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  spectacular show of demonstrations of force blowing up bridges,
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:39.000]  blowing up pipelines, the Russians will have a justifiable counterattack,
[2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  that's now started, and then the peaceful worldwide embargo or blockade,
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  local nuclear war, which they keep saying is imminent,
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:50.000]  you can see from what the neocons are putting out really around the Democrats,
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  they are following this as a blueprint, aren't they Dr. Boyle?
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  Well, it seems so, Alex, except they believe that they will prevail one way or the other.
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  They think they can pull this off, as I was saying, this is the Brzezinski strategy,
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  to use Ukraine to bleed Russia dry, to promote regime change,
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  and ultimately the crack up of Russia into its constituent units.
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  As I said, when we broke off, then Brzezinski became the advisor to Obama
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  during his presidential campaign, and vetted and approved all the foreign affairs
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:44.000]  and defense people working for Obama for eight years, that's Obama-Biden people.
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  So they've all gotten promotions, and now they're working for Biden,
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  and they're pursuing the Brzezinski strategy, that's how dangerous this is.
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  They're prepared to move up that ladder of escalation, as they just did today,
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  and they're pushing these massive NATO nuclear war maneuvers in Europe, yes.
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  So if we know their battle plan, how do we stop them?
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  I guess impeachment, massive protest, what do we do?
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  I think a combination of both, right, that you have my bill of impeachment there.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  We figured someone had to grab the bull by the horns and come out with leadership here,
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  like Tulsi Geberg, and do something about it,
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  and then we need people to take to the streets in peaceful, nonviolent protest everywhere,
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  sit-ins, disruptions, a general strike to try to stop a war here
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  between the United States and Russia.
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  Well, that's right, we saw 2.3 billion burned down, and 20 police officers killed,
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  and the rest of it, over George Floyd, which I think was wrong,
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  others said people were being angry and the media manipulated it.
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:10.000]  We don't want to see billions of dollars burned, we don't want to see cops killed,
[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  we want to see peaceful mass strike and mobilization and saying no to World War III.
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  People need to get their priorities straight here.
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  I think a general strike would be a great idea, the late, great Phil Berrigan consulted with me
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  on having a general strike to prevent the war against Iraq,
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  and I agreed to go along with it, but unfortunately, Phil died,
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  and I'm not Phil Berrigan, so we never did it.
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  But I think that's what we need right now, just bring the country to a halt
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  and stop this ladder of escalation towards nuclear war,
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  because as Hans Morgenthau pointed out, the mentor to Henry Kissinger,
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  my teacher, mentor and friend, limited nuclear war, tactical nuclear war,
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  is pure insanity.
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  It will inevitably escalate up that Hermann Kahn ladder to spasmonic nuclear warfare right.
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  And is that not the metaphor in Dr. Strange's Love of the Dims Day bomb,
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:14.000]  which I don't know the Russians have deployed at Dims Day submarine?
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  They do have, according to the published reports, yes, they have a war plan like that,
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  that if their leadership is taken out, it will automatically shoot off everything they have.
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  Yes, that's the report that I've read, yes.
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  What do you make about the talking point that hundreds of bombs aren't radioactive now?
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  Well, I mean, that's just preposterous, Alex.
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  As you probably remember, after the defeat of Germany in World War II on May 8th, 1945,
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  several members of the Manhattan Project quit,
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  because they felt the only reason we were developing the atomic bomb was because,
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  as Einstein said in his famous letter to President Roosevelt,
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:12.000]  the Nazis were developing the atomic bomb.
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  They figured with the defeat of Germany, it was no longer necessary.
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  And then they moved on to what was called the Super, the hydrogen bomb, okay?
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  And several more members of the Manhattan Project quit at that point,
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  because as they understood it, the Super, the hydrogen bomb, could only be used as a weapon of genocide.
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  And all of our strategic and intermediate nuclear forces are thermonuclear weapons, hydrogen bombs, right?
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  Gut level, what do you think the chances are of this thing kicking off with tactical weapons?
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  They're very high.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  As President Kennedy said during the Cuban Missile Crisis, he estimated maybe up to 50%.
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  I think that's where we are right now.
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  And by the way, Alex, we will be having these massive nuclear exercises for the next two weeks.
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  It's already been announced that at the end of the month, the Russians will be having their massive nuclear exercises operation store.
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  So we're going to have an intersection here of massive nuclear exercises by both Russia and the United States, NATO, going on at approximately the same time.
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  And for people that don't know what that means, why don't you explain?
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:42.000]  They're going to put the weapons in launch mode.
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  They're going to prepare.
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  They're going to test targets.
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  This is just the act of these drills.
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  It's extremely dangerous.
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  Right.
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  And as you correctly pointed out, what are called exercises for maneuvers oftentimes go hot and have been planned to go hot.
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  Yes.
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  So indeed, there's no way the Russians will know or be able to know that our nuclear capabilities that we are exercising now don't have nuclear thermal nuclear bombs in them already.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  Let me ask you this.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  In most drills, they do.
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  Let me ask you this and during drills, they have Navy SEALs move bombs around tactical weapons.
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  That's all happening.
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  What do you make of Rob Reiner and all these other liberals, people like Sean Penn running around saying we should use nukes first.
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  It's sexy.
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  It's good.
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  These people should be ashamed of themselves.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  I mean, what happened to these people that Hollywood is now drooling over preemptive nuclear attacks?
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  Well, I can't say I spend much time following Hollywood celebrities.
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  So no, I don't either.
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  But since when is Hollywood promoting nuclear war?
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  Well, Hollywood's made enormous sums of money out of promoting war.
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  As we all know, Alex, look at all the war movies.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  They're constantly shoving down our throat.
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  The promotion of violence and killing.
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  You name it.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  So Hollywood, Hollywood actors make enormous amounts of money off of off of war.
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  Indeed, all these war movies are coordinated.
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  Sure.
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  But also the reason I brought it up is they're being told by the deep state promote this.
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  Yes, I think that's correct.
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  That is the agenda here.
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  Right.
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  There is an agenda.
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  Right.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  So we're seeing when pro nuclear war propaganda at the greatest threat in human history, that is another troubling sign.
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  It's a terrible sign.
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  And also this demonization of Putin and Russia.
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  Whenever we've seen a demonization before, we go to war with with the demons.
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  Right.
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  So it's a very distressing, discouraging sign.
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  The Cuban missile crisis.
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:42:59.000]  It's our best seller.
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:12.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made him feel and how healthy it made him, it has become our number one overall best seller.

[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  Essential means without these things, you die.
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  And so much of the food is debased.
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  It is critical to bolster our bodies defenses with a product like this.
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.

[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  What's the good halogen?
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together.
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  This family that is InfoWars.
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:37.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  I don't take the credit.
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  I give you the credit.
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:45.000]  It isn't going to give up.
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:47.000]  Without your support we can be shut down.
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today.
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  Save InfoWars.com today and donate for our Legal Defense Fund.
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  Okay, it's now live on InfoWars.com.
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  We'll put it on screen.
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  And that is the impeachment of Joe Biden.
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  We're violating the War Powers Act, violating law, launching an illegal war without congressional authorization.
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:55.000]  We need to make a big issue out of this.
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  We have momentum.
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  Making Congress circulating articles of impeachment against Biden to prevent nuclear war against Russia.
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  And the impeachment written by Dr. Francis Boyle, who wrote the impeachment of George Edward Walker Bush, it is live at InfoWars.com.
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  Read it, share it, and stop Armageddon.
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  Everyone should go get this and hit every member of Congress.
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  Everybody send it to talk show host.
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  Everybody should send it to your church.
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  We need to stop this and stop this now.
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  This is insane.
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  We're not off by the break.
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  Dr. Boyle, you were trying to finish the statement.
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  Well, Alex, what we're seeing here is the Pentagon's philosophy, the think taker's philosophy of escalation dominance.
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  They believe that they can dominate Russia on every ladder of that, every plank of that scale of escalation.
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  And for that reason, they will prevail.
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  The difference is, however, that President Kennedy took the steps that he did, including planning for war for Cuba that was only 90 miles off of our coast.
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  Well, Ukraine is right on Russia's borders, and indeed, right now, Ukraine is launching military attacks into Russia.
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  Well, Alex, I've toured the front lines, World War II front lines at Leningrad, Moscow, and Stalingrad.
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  Indeed, I spent a day touring around Stalingrad, and the pure savagery the German army took my breath away.
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  We have to understand, then, that Stalingrad is only 460 kilometers from the front lines there at Donbass.
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  And the U.S., NATO, and these neo-Nazi Ukrainian forces are right there that we put into power in 2014 with a coup d'état against the democratically elected government
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  under the sponsorship of Obama, Biden, and as conceded by Newland, spent $5 billion there over there with cookies and everything.
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  And now Biden has Newland as the undersecretary of state, the number three official in the State Department.
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  So I think that shows you what the agenda is here and how dangerous it is.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  The Soviets lost 27 million people there in World War II, and Ukraine is an existential issue for them, as Cuba was an existential issue for President Kennedy.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  We have to understand that.
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  Sure, I mean, imagine if Russia was putting nuclear weapons on our border with Mexico and Texas.
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  So let's expand on this. Stanley Kubrick, there was a big debate about this.
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  Curtis LeMay, LL Mnitzer, one of the preemptive warrants for Russia that was coming out at the time.
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  Kennedy had said no. That information got circulated.
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  And then Kubrick makes a movie with fictitious names, but a composite of real people and real things that could have taken place.
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  And in that, we basically see the very same type of escalations that are happening here where the elites and their bunkers said, oh, yeah, we'll kill, you know, 50 million Russians and we'll only lose 20 million, 30 million tops.
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  We'll get our hair messed up a little bit.
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  So when Newland and all these chicken hawks are talking about a survival nuclear war, they're not talking about survival for us.
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  They're talking about for their deep state that already hates us and that sees us as the enemy just as much as they see the Russians as an enemy.
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:52:01.000]  Well, again, Tulsi Gabbard said they are an elitist cabal of war mongers, and that's perfectly correct.
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  I went to Harvard with large numbers of these people. They train me to be one of them.
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:16.000]  That is what we are dealing with. You're perfectly correct. Tulsi Gabbard is perfectly correct, too. Yes.
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  And, you know, I find that there's a common theme here. I know a lot of military people that have been officers but also enlisted involved in a lot of really serious stuff.
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  And they're all against war and they're all against nuclear war and say this is dangerous and horrible.
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:37.000]  But all these chicken hawks like Victoria Newland and Joe Biden, who wouldn't know which end of a gun shoots, they think a nuclear war is survivable.
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  That adds an even higher level of danger that for them it's like a video game, but it's not for military people.
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:50.000]  No, because the military people will be the first to die in any type of war.
[2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  You know, as we're moving, as I said before, even the New York Times reported right now we have special forces fighting in Ukraine.
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  Okay. They're the cutting edge and they will be first to get killed and it will move from there.
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  By the way, a year ago, before February came, I know people that are over there, they didn't tell me the specifics,
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  but since February started, I know people that have been directly out there directing lazing targets for the Ukrainians to attack them.
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:26.000]  So yes, we have undoubtedly lost regular enlisted, not just cutouts, not just mercenaries or not just contractors.
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:32.000]  We are losing U.S. active service members right now in war with Russia.
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  My understanding is yes, that we have, they just haven't reported them because they're there illegally and unconstitutionally,
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  and so they're not going to report these casualties. You're perfectly correct.
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:48.000]  Sure. It's like Eisenhower's advisors in Vietnam.
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:57.000]  We supposedly finally had the police action or the military action in 64 with Tonkin under LBJ, but it was really going on at 60.
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:54:03.000]  Yeah. Well, it went back to Eisenhower and then Kennedy. Correct.
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:08.000]  That's when the Vietnam War really started. They just didn't say anything in public.
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:16.000]  And finally, we get the Gulf of Tonkin resolution where it comes out of the closet and everyone's aware of what's going on.
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  You use the metaphor of sleepwalking into World War III. I think that's what the American people are doing here.
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  They're just not aware of how dangerous the situation is.
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  I think if they realize that this is just as if not even more dangerous than the Cuban Missile Crisis,
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  I would hope the American people would act by impeaching Biden and also a general strike.
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  I don't see right now anything else that can really stop the momentum here,
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  because Biden and the Bidenites are completely impervious reasons. You're perfectly correct on that.
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  Well, it's important to kiss our children and grandchildren and say our prayers, folks.
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:08.000]  This is not a game. This is not a joke. I know a lot of military people that are high up and they are very concerned, really worried,
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  and we are sleepwalking into destruction.
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  Dr. Boyle, you've written a lot of books. You've written a book on this subject. People can Google your name.
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  Where's the best place for people to find your writings?
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  They could just go to Amazon.com, and most of my writings will be there for purposes of today's conversation.
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  You have my book, The Criminality of Nuclear Deterrence, and that it has been updated in my latest book,
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  World Politics, Human Rights, and International Law.
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  That brings the situation up to date to the repudiation of the INF Treaty by Bolton, the neocon,
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  who regrettably convinced Trump to repudiate that INF Treaty and how dangerous the situation is right now.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  All right, Doctor, thank you so much and look forward to speaking to you hopefully in the future. We're all still here. Thank you.
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  Thank you. Thank you very much for having me on here. Alex, please keep up with this type of work.
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  I'm trying. Okay. Wow. We're going to go to break. We've got Gerald Salente coming up.
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  I've got a few final stories. I'm only hitting the next little five-minute segment.
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  We won't be here if you don't fund us, and I'm not bitching. I'm not complaining.
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  If you choose to keep us on here, that's your choice, and I appreciate all your support. Plus, we've got stuff you really need.
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  There's a run on iodine everywhere because of the nuclear threat. That's not why we sell iodine, though.
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  Ours is the best and great for your thyroid. It's great for your energy, your stamina, your immune system.

[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  That's up to 60% off, and that sales is going to have to end very, very soon because a bunch of these items are about to sell out.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  Despite the fact that we're selling out of vitamin mineral fusion and X3 and a bunch of other products like Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula,
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  we're still offering them with 10% off with promo code 1776 on top of the giant sales that are currently going on.
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:24.000]  So the biggest sales, 60% off with promo code, the smallest sales, you know, 10% off on the signed book or unsigned book,
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  but with promo code 1776 because they're not on sale, those are fundraising items.

[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  Essential means without these things, you die. And so much of the food is debased. There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:30.000]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[2:58:30.000 --> 2:58:36.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the info war.

[2:58:59.000 --> 2:59:00.000]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:07.000]  And over the years, you have come to the table, you have stepped to the plate so many times and kept info wars and free speech on the air.
[2:59:07.000 --> 2:59:08.000]  And I thank you.
[2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:14.000]  But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them, and I need your support.

[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:35.000]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making is almost over.
[2:59:35.000 --> 2:59:39.000]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[2:59:39.000 --> 2:59:57.000]  So please, if you support what we're doing, and want to fight for liberty and freedom in just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[2:59:57.000 --> 3:00:11.000]  There is a planetary destabilization happening with a great reset by design.
[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  Whatever Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates call for, we're forced to do it in a matter of several years.
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:24.000]  And so it's all over the news now that in the U.S., the U.K., Europe, the Netherlands, we're telling kids, eat bugs to save the earth.
[3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  You're bad if you don't eat bugs. World Economic Forum agenda in full force.
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:36.000]  Hundreds of schools in the Netherlands have started a campaign introducing 10 and 12-year-old kids to mealworm and insects as a sustainable meat substitute.
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  The goal is to bring about behavioral changes through unprejudiced children.
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  Oh, they're unprejudiced. Here, roll this with audio.
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  And they're doing all over Hollywood, all over the media.
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:01:02.000]  They're giving them prizes and attention of their part of it while they ban their parents' farms, while they cut off the resources.
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:08.000]  I mean, this is just absolute evil. Just like they're promoting drag queen pedophile story time.
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:14.000]  Read the article, share the article, fight back against these monsters. Don't let the school systems abuse your children.
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  You will eat the bugs. Children force fed insects as W.E.F. agenda in full scale in the Netherlands.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  In full force in the Netherlands.
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:30.000]  And it ties into their whole, larger, globalist plan to get you to accept things that go against your common sense and your instincts.
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  Because you're not prejudiced. Oh, a child's not prejudiced about a full grown man wanting to have sex with them.
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:43.000]  Oh, a child's not prejudiced against getting a microchip. Oh, a child's not prejudiced against being given all these deadly injections.
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  Because they're a child and they count on adults to protect them and guide them, not lead them into slavery.
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:53.000]  It's not altruistic. It's not heroic to eat bugs.
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:02:00.000]  The globalists are getting rid of our free open society and creating a dystopic nightmare by design.
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  And a lot of people are going to go under mass Stockholm syndrome and submit to it, but still.
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:09.000]  Many others are going along with it because they're not going to be eating the bugs.
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  While you're living in a 200 square foot coffin apartment, while you're eating bugs, they're going to be flying around in private jets, eating T-bone steaks.
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:21.000]  And that's all they're doing is selling you like Obama told Africans before he left office seven years ago.
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  You can't have air conditioning in cars. Air conditioning in cars doesn't hurt things.
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  They just want to depopulate us.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  And by the way, the structures of bugs, their exoskeletons in major studies are extremely toxic and cause cancer and bone problems and all sorts of health problems.
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:50.000]  We're not meant to eat bugs. We're not insectivores.
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  There are omnivores, there are herbivores, there are carnivores, and there are insectivores.
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  Only certain species of reptiles and marsupials and a few others can even eat a diet of insects because they're toxic.
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  Like everything else the New World Order is pushing.
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  Gerald Salento always talks about we need a culture of beauty and of admiring culture and of good food and of taste.
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  If they can take that away from you, they're going to be able to take everything away.
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:32.000]  When you accept ugly architecture and ugly culture, well now it's beyond that, you'll accept pedophilia, you'll accept bugs and sewage water.
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  Because Bill Gates says you don't get meat anymore. This is their official plan.
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  I put all this in my film, The Obama Deception. I put it in the end game because it was on the drawing board then.
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  You go watch those films, one of them made 16 years ago, one of them made 10, 12 years ago.
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:54.000]  It's all come true, ladies and gentlemen, because it's a globalist battle plan.
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  It's a big plan. It's a big club and we're not in it.
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  And if we don't have a human union, not an official union, but a union of ideas and if we don't stick together and say no to this, the sky is the limit.
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  They've had unlimited corporate money to train you to eat the disgusting bugs, all the globalists sit there and laugh at you.
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  It's all about what can they get the Hollywood scum to do?
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  Well, guess what? Hollywood's collapsed. Everybody's fleeing Hollywood. Everybody's fleeing the blue cities and blue states.
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  And so now as they collapse, they launch their attacks against us all and against our children to see if we'll buy their scams and their fraud one more time.
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  But you're going to override them with your word of mouth that's king and can smash the AI censorship.
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:05:10.000]  Share in FullWars.com, share a band out video and share the live feed now as Gerald Salente takes over in T-minus 60 Seconds. God bless you all.
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:22.000]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world. When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[3:05:22.000 --> 3:05:34.000]  I lead an incredibly stressful life. I don't play with Mr. Health, but if I wasn't taking products like X3 from FullWars.com, I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[3:05:34.000 --> 3:05:45.000]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible. And despite the fact that selling out X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at infowars.com.
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:53.000]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war. We're not selling it for that. We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.
[3:05:53.000 --> 3:06:09.000]  We're selling it at X3 today, 50% off at infowars.com all supplies last.
[3:06:09.000 --> 3:06:23.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[3:06:23.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show. Listen to what Alex is saying. This is a time for support. You're trying to silence all of us that won't follow their scheme. The bigs are in control of everything.
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:53.000]  All of the business, all of the hedge funds and the private equity groups and the other companies buying out company after company and monopolizing virtually every segment of society.
[3:06:53.000 --> 3:07:11.000]  How about junk food? You see people, these long lines going to Popeyes. How about Kentucky Fried Chicken? I like McDonald's. Give me a Burger King. Again, it's from crap to bugs.
[3:07:11.000 --> 3:07:21.000]  The people going down and they follow what they're being told. And Alex mentioned about Hollywood, how they keep selling it and there's no Hollywood.
[3:07:21.000 --> 3:07:32.000]  The clown on high with the arrogant guy, that arrogant guy. This is the headline story in the cartoon news network CNN.
[3:07:32.000 --> 3:07:40.000]  Why George Clooney never thought Trump would be president. What do I care about what George Clooney thinks?
[3:07:40.000 --> 3:07:53.000]  How about why Mickey Mouse never thought Minnie Mouse would have sex with Goofy? Maybe George Clooney could talk a lot about that because that's all he is.
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:08:05.000]  An arrogant little mommy's boy. If my aunt was in Rosemary Clooney, I'd be shoveling crap. I'd be shoveling crap because that's all I spew out.
[3:08:05.000 --> 3:08:17.000]  This is Hollywood. Hollywood. Holy cow. What a bunch of freaks. This is the Clooney clown.
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:42.000]  Then when he was over in Australia, he was so, so happy about how they did their lockdowns and said that America followed what they did with the lockdowns that had done nothing.
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:55.000]  Done nothing to stop the COVID war. Nothing. There'd be 900,000 less deaths and they quote this clown. You know why?
[3:08:55.000 --> 3:09:09.000]  Because it's a clown show. If you listen to CNN, NBC, all of these mainstream TV stations, you know, with the exception of one or two guys like Tucker Carlson, very few guys,
[3:09:09.000 --> 3:09:22.000]  you listen and you're swallowing crap. So if you like to swallow crap and you take a political side, stay tuned to the mainstream network.
[3:09:22.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  Yep. What a joke. What a joke. And they quote these clowns.
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:43.000]  Anyway, speaking of clowns and the mask aside, I had to get the cataract examination last Friday.
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:51.000]  So you got to look into the thing, you know, and they're making you wear a mask. And this thing is fogging up.
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:57.000]  I said it's fogging. They hand me a tissue to wipe it off. Yeah, why are you hitting me a tissue if I took the mask off?
[3:09:57.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  I'm paying for this. I'm paying a lot of money for this. And you're making me wear a mask. Hey, you got a mask on. You're safe. You're safe.
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  Why are you telling me to wear a mask? I'll tell you why. Because we believe George Clooney. We believe the loonies wear stupid jerks.
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:33.000]  Why are you quoting this guy? He's a nobody. He's an actor. He plays the role of somebody else because that's not who he is.
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  Save your arrogant crap. Oh, oh, and he wants then mandated vaccinations to everybody. Hey, Clooney wants the vaccinations to everybody.
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:11:07.000]  And they quote these clowns. You know why? Because they're prostitutes, little Donnie Lemons, little Anderson Coopers, little Jake Tappers, prostitutes, media whores,
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  who get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and government horn nastens.
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:29.000]  Bring me back on. How about bringing Dr. McCullough on? Oh, no, we'll ban him. He says things we don't like.
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:40.000]  How about bringing RFK Junior on? Oh, no, no, no. He doesn't want to vaccinate everybody with an Operation Warp Speed Vax.
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:49.000]  And remember the crap that they spewed out? Two shots will do you? 96% efficacy rate.
[3:11:49.000 --> 3:11:58.000]  Oh, you mean a 96% efficacy rate that now you need a booster every year?
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:06.000]  This is the crap they're selling. And this is what the people are swallowing.
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:13.000]  Then I go to the dentist. Must wear a mask. Big sign on the window, right?
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:23.000]  What I got to wear a mask for? You got a mask on.
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  And then I could take the mask off when you're working in my mouth. It's really, really hard to work on teeth when you got a mask on.
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:43.000]  But maybe we could figure it out because we'll really be stupid. We'll be good Americans. We'll follow their orders.
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:53.000]  You could get great, great surgery in your mouth with your mask on. What the hell's the matter with you, Salanti?
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:13:04.000]  This has become the new abnormal. This COVID war that they launched the Chinese on Chinese Lunar New Year,
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:13.000]  January 2020, the year the rat has destroyed the lives and livelihoods of billions across the planet.
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  This economic and socioeconomic and geopolitical damage it's done is incalculable, incalculable.
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  And it's messed up the minds. Hey, how about the crime rates rising?
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:31.000]  Oh, we only warned you in the Trends Journal. When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:38.000]  And they've lost it. They've lost it in their head. They lost it in their pocketbook. They've lost it completely.
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:47.000]  Hey, take the subway in New York. It's a nightingale cutter, but even worse because they'll cut you up, man.
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:53.000]  Yeah. Walk down the street and get your head barestumped from the back.
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:14:01.000]  And I can't let go to fight a, you know, you know, when you get suck a punch from a bunch of crazy people from behind,
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:05.000]  you can't see anything coming, man, unless you have eyes and back of your head.
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:15.000]  Or maybe Clooney does because he doesn't have eyes on the fact. Maybe they're on the back of his head and up his, you know what?
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  Vaccination should be mandate. I'm Rosemary Clooney's nephew.
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  One big club and you ain't in it. As George Collins said, it's a freak show.
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:39.000]  And the one big club is the freaks running the show. And that's why ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages,
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:44.000]  you got to do everything you can to support info wars, keep the truth alive.
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:49.000]  And of course, if you want to know the facts of what in the world is going on, what it means, what's next and what to do,
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  you want to TrendsJournal, TrendsJournal.com. And there's no magazine like it in the world.
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  So we're doing everything we can. Info wars is doing everything they can. And it's up to you to do everything you can.
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:08.000]  Because number two, if we don't unite for peace, we're going to die in war. The lunatics have marched us off to war.
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  I wonder if they're going to make them soldiers. You guys should all wear masks when you're fighting, especially when you're looking in that little thing over there, you know?
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  Don't worry about it. It won't fog up. Here's a tissue. You could clean it.
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:33.000]  We got crazy people running our world. They're mentally ill. Got it? They're mentally ill.
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:39.000]  So do everything you can to support info wars, support the truth. And we're going to take a break in a couple of seconds.
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  So stay tuned because we're going to talk a lot about what's going to go on on the economic front.
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:56.000]  And you better be prepared for this. Prepare for the worst, because the worst is coming. We'll be right back. Stay tuned.
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:16:02.000]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny. But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:08.000]  Now, I knew that. And for 28 years, I've been on air, exposed these people, and together we've had a great effect.
[3:16:08.000 --> 3:16:15.000]  But listen, they're coming after us right now. They're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power of we, the people of you and I together.

[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:36.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[3:17:36.000 --> 3:17:46.000]  It's unsustainable. So please visit saveinfowarstore.com where you can make straight donations, 5, 10, 50, 100 dollars,
[3:17:46.000 --> 3:17:49.000]  whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere.

[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:09.000]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[3:18:09.000 --> 3:18:13.000]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells, it doesn't just give you more energy, it doesn't just boost your immune system,
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:24.000]  but it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.

[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:49.000]  This kicks in in about two weeks on average. You need to experience it.

[3:19:52.000 --> 3:19:57.000]  infowarstore.com. X3.
[3:19:57.000 --> 3:20:04.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:04.000 --> 3:20:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:11.000 --> 3:20:16.000]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:20:16.000 --> 3:20:21.000]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show at info wars.
[3:20:21.000 --> 3:20:24.000]  Remember, do everything you can to support info wars.
[3:20:24.000 --> 3:20:28.000]  Remember, do everything you can to support info wars.
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:35.000]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show at info wars. Remember, do everything you can to support info wars.
[3:20:35.000 --> 3:20:40.000]  This is a very crucial time in our lives. They're taking us to war.
[3:20:40.000 --> 3:20:44.000]  They're doing, could you believe it? They're doing military drills.
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:52.000]  Nuclear military drills now. The United States and NATO.
[3:20:52.000 --> 3:20:55.000]  Nuclear deterrence. There's no such thing.
[3:20:55.000 --> 3:21:00.000]  Nuclear bombs go off. It's the end of life on Earth.
[3:21:00.000 --> 3:21:06.000]  They asked Albert Einstein, a cat that knew a thing or two about the atomic bomb.
[3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:09.000]  They said, what kind of weapons will be used to fight the Third World War?
[3:21:09.000 --> 3:21:15.000]  He said, I don't know. He said, they're both using sticks and stones to fight the fourth.
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:20.000]  We have mentally deranged people running our lives and ruining us.
[3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:31.000]  It's freaks. So anyway, if anything you say, again, you know, I had a big peace rally here and not a piece of coverage.
[3:21:31.000 --> 3:21:35.000]  As a matter of fact, when you see the Trends Journal cover Scott Ritter.
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:40.000]  You know, this is the guy that worked for the United Nations nuclear division.
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  They said there were no weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda. He was there.
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:51.000]  Judge Napolitano, Phil Gerali, former CIA guy, quit the CIA.
[3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:56.000]  He said everybody in the CIA knew there were no weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda.
[3:21:56.000 --> 3:22:05.000]  They lied. Gary Null, aggressive radio network, no coverage, no coverage peace.
[3:22:05.000 --> 3:22:09.000]  Again, they lied us into the war. The facts were there.
[3:22:09.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  But hey, Alex Jones, you know, his defamation about Sandy Hook.
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:26.000]  That's a crime. Lying us into war with the facts that there was no threats against the United States,
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  no weapons of mass destruction. Where are the criminal charges being brought up against the Bushes?
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:42.000]  The penis chainies, because I can't call them a dick chainie. I don't want to get censored.
[3:22:42.000 --> 3:22:51.000]  Condoleezza Rice. One after another. Where were the crime charges being brought up on them?
[3:22:51.000 --> 3:22:56.000]  So anyway, that's what the whole system is. It's a crime syndicate.
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:23:03.000]  Again, it's like the J.P. Morgan chase gang convicted of five felonies. Hey, nobody goes to jail. I'm Jamie Diamond.
[3:23:03.000 --> 3:23:07.000]  Look what we got. What are you talking about? Give me some money. Yeah, shut up.
[3:23:07.000 --> 3:23:15.000]  Here's some money. Shut up. It's one big club and you ain't in it, as George Collins said.
[3:23:15.000 --> 3:23:24.000]  So do you cancel support in forwards? Going back to the economy, the Dow is up like 550 points.
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:36.000]  This is after last week's lousy inflation numbers came in that were higher than expected. It was 8.1, 8.2%.
[3:23:36.000 --> 3:23:42.000]  The raising interest rates did nothing compared to inflation.
[3:23:42.000 --> 3:23:51.000]  8.3.25, 3.5 interest rate overnight rate. And it's still slowing down the economy.
[3:23:51.000 --> 3:23:58.000]  If you borrow from the IMF, you got to have your interest rate 1% above inflation, right?
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:02.000]  So what they're going to do is they're going to keep this Ponzi scheme going.
[3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:12.000]  And I believe they're going to, before the election, the Federal Reserve meets on November 1st and 2nd, Monday and Tuesday.
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:17.000]  They're not going to raise interest rates 75 basis points.
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:21.000]  I believe they're going to raise them maybe 25 basis points or 50 basis points.
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:29.000]  This year, I'll have another phony boost in the stock market and everybody will believe happy days are here again and they'll get the midterm vote.
[3:24:29.000 --> 3:24:33.000]  We'll try to. So that's the deal.
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:43.000]  Once upon a time, back when slick Willy Clinton ran in 1992, the line used to be, it's the economy, stupid.
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:47.000]  We were going through very difficult economic times back then.
[3:24:47.000 --> 3:24:54.000]  And that's all it is. It's the economy, stupid. And people are worried about inflation.
[3:24:54.000 --> 3:25:01.000]  Again, your wages are up 5%, but you're down over 3% when you look at inflation.
[3:25:01.000 --> 3:25:10.000]  Then if you go to John Williams shadow stats, inflation numbers really 16% or more.
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:17.000]  Because they rigged the numbers so you don't have to raise so security that I went up 8.7% this coming year.
[3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  But if it was the real number, it would be much higher.
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  So they don't want it high because some securities broke because they stole the money out of there to keep building up and spending more cheap money based on nothing.
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  And that's supposed to unravel, you know, with about 10 to 12 years.
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:42.000]  So they're just going to keep printing more and more cheap money to keep the Ponzi scheme going.
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:48.000]  They'll do anything they can. It's a criminal organization. They're banksters.
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:54.000]  Once upon a time, as the story goes, there was somebody by the name of Jesus Christ.
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:26:01.000]  Yeah, the Prince of Peace drove the money changes out of the temple.
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:15.000]  The JPMorgan Chase, the Goldman Sachs Gang, the Rothschilds, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, and they were all there.
[3:26:15.000 --> 3:26:23.000]  Three days later, man, he's on the cross. You don't mess with the banksters. They're gangsters.
[3:26:23.000 --> 3:26:30.000]  When I was a young guy, they used to say, oh, the mob, you know, they used to charge people 5%, 7%, 10% interest rate to borrow money.
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:36.000]  Now, what do they charge now? 17%, 500%?
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:42.000]  Do anything they can. It's a scam. Get to sit in your head, everybody.
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  We don't have a government. It's a crime syndicate. The Repulsive Kins and the Democraps.
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:56.000]  There he is. Three days later, Jack, you're dead.
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:27:01.000]  It's a crime syndicate. They liars into wars. They steal our money.
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:08.000]  They give it to the too big to fail. Hey, I'm a bank. I'm too big to fail. Who are you?
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:17.000]  You're a nobody. You're just a plantation worker on the plantation of slave land here in a country near you.
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:23.000]  Hey, big protests going over there in France. Where are all the protests in America?
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:28.000]  Where are they?
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:34.000]  The country of cowards, not the people watching info wars. United we stand divided we fall.
[3:27:34.000 --> 3:27:41.000]  And remember, it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority,
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:51.000]  keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men, said Samuel Adams.
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:27:56.000]  It's time for us men to unite peacefully.
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:28:03.000]  Now I'm a warrior for the prince of peace. I fight for peace. And what are you doing?
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:12.000]  So do what you can, by the way, support occupy peace or freedompeacejustice.com.
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:16.000]  You know, the great for billionaire gave us a couple of hundred million to get this thing going.
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:21.000]  Where are the billionaires talking about peace? Oh, must came out, talked about peace talks.
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:26.000]  Look how you got attacked. What God do you believe in? What God believes in war?
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:32.000]  Name me the God that believes in war. Must be a lot of them because I don't hear the Catholic church.
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:35.000]  I don't hear the Jews. I don't hear the, I don't hear the seven day Adventist.
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:40.000]  The Mormons got locked sure. Where are all your people to where was all the peace movement?
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  How come nothing's going on? No God believes in war. It's demonic. It's satanic.
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:56.000]  So we're going to be right back to talk more about the economy and world events.
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:29:05.000]  Think about a world without info wars. Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:10.000]  and callers and stories we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:17.000]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders
[3:29:17.000 --> 3:29:26.000]  like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[3:29:26.000 --> 3:29:36.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:44.000]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit. And now info wars is facing its darkest hours. It isn't going to give up.

[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:57.000]  You know, they gave that clown that was a form of Fed head, Ben Bernanke, Ben BS Bernanke, a jerk, a moron, but again, Nobel Economic Prize, right.
[3:37:57.000 --> 3:38:02.000]  I call it the Nobel piece of crap prize.
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  What a joke.
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:09.000]  What a joke.
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:13.000]  Obama back in the day.
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:15.000]  Praise Bernanke.
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:19.000]  This was from your trends journal years ago.
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:26.000]  For his bold action and out of the box thinking.
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:40.000]  This is the Fed chairman that boosts posts a long streak of making wrong economic forecasts and misreading the economic tea leaves.
[3:38:40.000 --> 3:38:45.000]  Again, I began my got my reputation Wall Street Journal.
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:51.000]  I'm the guy that called the 1987 stock market crash.
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:59.000]  I'm the guy that in our trends journal October 1999.
[3:38:59.000 --> 3:39:04.000]  We forecast the dot com bus would happen by the second quarter of 2000.
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  There it is.
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  I'm the guy that forecast the Asian currency crisis.
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:22.000]  I'm the guy that took out the domain name panic of 08 in 2007.
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:31.000]  I don't get a prize, but they give it to the members of the club, the criminal club, the banks, the bandits.
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:33.000]  Hey, that guy Kaplan down there.
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:36.000]  He was with the Fed down in Dungeon, Texas.
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  Oh, yeah, that guy.
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:46.000]  Oh, yeah, it was playing the markets before the Fed released what they were saying and made millions and tens of millions of dollars.
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:47.000]  Oh, those banks.
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:48.000]  There's so empty.
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:49.000]  Who are you?
[3:39:49.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  You're just a little jerk from the Bronx.
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:58.000]  You're a nobody.
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  In a CNBC interview on July 29 2005, the Harvard boy, Harvard Princeton Yale bullets, bombs and banks.
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:20.000]  Arrogant, arrogant, arrogant guys and girls.
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:22.000]  And the former Princeton professor.
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:27.000]  Remember, Harvard Princeton Yale bullets, bombs and banks.
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:39.000]  The Fed chairman was asked, tell me, what is the worst case scenario if we in fact see real estate prices actually coming down substantially across the country?
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:49.000]  The answer by the Nobel economic piece of crap prize winner.
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:40:53.000]  Well, I guess I don't buy your premise.
[3:40:53.000 --> 3:40:57.000]  It's pretty unlikely possibility.
[3:40:57.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  We never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis.
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:14.000]  And they give this clown boy an award for being a stupid, arrogant freak.
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:18.000]  Hey, I'm an authority.
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:21.000]  I'm a dignitary.
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:23.000]  Those are cursed words.
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:29.000]  Nobody is a dignitary.
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:38.000]  And then, speaking before Congress 18 months later on 28 February 2007, as the subprime mortgage is fiasco deepened,
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  Bernanke said, quote, there is not much indication at this point that subprime mortgage issues have spread into the broader mortgage market, which is still seems to be healthy.
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  All right, I'm not making this up.
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  I'm not making this up.
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  This is what this arrogant guy said 100% wrong as Gerald Salenti was saying the opposite and black bald hope that's racist can't say black bald.
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  Gender bald.
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:15.000]  Yeah, that's it.
[3:42:15.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  I'm gender bald.
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  I'm dead woke.
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  What I'm pointing this out to show you the hypocrisy, the lies that the prostitutes keep selling and how they're destroying our lives.
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:36.000]  Oh, they gave the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner to Obama.
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:40.000]  Yeah, I'm really good at killing people quoted in the book, Double Down.
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  Now that deserves a peace prize.
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:47.000]  Yeah, piece of crap prize and the pieces of crap keep winning them.
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  And if we don't support info wars and you don't support the truth,
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:53.000]  we're in for rough times ahead.
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:43:22.000]  We'll be right back.
[3:43:23.000 --> 3:43:24.000]  Supercharges.

[3:44:28.000 --> 3:44:32.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:37.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[3:44:37.000 --> 3:44:41.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.

[3:44:43.000 --> 3:44:44.000]  I salute you.
[3:44:44.000 --> 3:44:45.000]  I thank you.
[3:44:45.000 --> 3:44:51.000]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this brief is happening.
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:56.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[3:44:56.000 --> 3:44:58.000]  It's our best seller.
[3:44:58.000 --> 3:45:02.000]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:08.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:11.000]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:14.000]  And it's been sold out for a while but it's finally back in stock.
[3:45:14.000 --> 3:45:20.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:27.000]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[3:45:27.000 --> 3:45:30.000]  Essential means without these things you die.
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:32.000]  And so much of the food is debased.
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:34.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[3:45:34.000 --> 3:45:38.000]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[3:45:38.000 --> 3:45:42.000]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there but this is amongst the very best
[3:45:42.000 --> 3:45:45.000]  and it's a low price and it funds the InfoWare.
[3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:50.000]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock

[3:45:59.000 --> 3:46:04.000]  It's not hype that your support of InfoWare is the reason we were able to do this.
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:06.000]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[3:46:06.000 --> 3:46:09.000]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[3:46:09.000 --> 3:46:13.000]  Well high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[3:46:13.000 --> 3:46:16.000]  And when you've got it in your body it doesn't just supercharge your cells.
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:17.000]  It doesn't just give you more energy.
[3:46:17.000 --> 3:46:18.000]  It doesn't just boost your immune system.
[3:46:18.000 --> 3:46:24.000]  But it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[3:46:24.000 --> 3:46:29.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average.
[3:46:29.000 --> 3:46:33.000]  You take a few drops every day and almost everyone has dramatic results.
[3:46:33.000 --> 3:46:34.000]  Plus it funds the InfoWare.
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:38.000]  So what do you have to lose but taking action?

[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:25.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:25.000 --> 3:47:33.000]  Hey, hey, hey, he's Alex Jones Show and thank you for tuning in.
[3:47:33.000 --> 3:47:38.000]  And again, do everything you can to support InfoWare these are very critical times.
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:48.000]  And that censorship has become a reality that, you know, this is not my America.
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:51.000]  My America is life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[3:47:51.000 --> 3:47:58.000]  Can you imagine those are words of the Declaration of Independence, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:47:59.000]  Liberty?
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:01.000]  Oh, you would have liberty.
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  I'm Gavin Newsom.
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:07.000]  I'm some other arrogant boy of the club.
[3:48:07.000 --> 3:48:10.000]  I'll tell you what to do.
[3:48:10.000 --> 3:48:13.000]  Don't you know who I am?
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:25.000]  Lock down, stay in your house as I go to the French laundry and dine on $400 a plate dinners with all my friends.
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:28.000]  One clown after another.
[3:48:28.000 --> 3:48:31.000]  Light head over there in Chicago.
[3:48:31.000 --> 3:48:36.000]  One dope, a little Andy Cuomo he had in New York.
[3:48:36.000 --> 3:48:38.000]  Happiness, life, liberty.
[3:48:38.000 --> 3:48:39.000]  What happiness?
[3:48:39.000 --> 3:48:41.000]  You're not allowed to have happiness.
[3:48:41.000 --> 3:48:43.000]  I'm in charge and I'm a freak.
[3:48:43.000 --> 3:48:45.000]  I'm a political freak.
[3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:46.000]  What?
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:49.000]  There's no happiness.
[3:48:49.000 --> 3:48:54.000]  Anyway, they keep talking nuclear war.
[3:48:54.000 --> 3:49:05.000]  As I mentioned before, you know, here, NATO to hold nuclear deterrence exercise as Russia rages at Ukraine.
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:17.000]  There is no such thing as nuclear deterrence, moron, imbecile, stupid jerks.
[3:49:17.000 --> 3:49:27.000]  It's time for America to stop interfering in other countries' business.
[3:49:27.000 --> 3:49:31.000]  Enough is enough.
[3:49:31.000 --> 3:49:33.000]  I want that guy cut off.
[3:49:33.000 --> 3:49:35.000]  Get out of there.
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:39.000]  I'm the Nobel Peace and Crap Prize winner, Barack Obama.
[3:49:39.000 --> 3:49:41.000]  We're going to bring freedom and democracy there.
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:42.000]  Yes, sir.
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:44.000]  Yes, sir.
[3:49:44.000 --> 3:49:47.000]  I want that guy, Assad, out of there.
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:50.000]  We're going to bring freedom and democracy to Syria.
[3:49:50.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  Yes, sir.
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:54.000]  Yes, sir.
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:49:56.000]  Assad has to go.
[3:49:56.000 --> 3:49:58.000]  Gaddafi has to go.
[3:49:58.000 --> 3:50:00.000]  Hussein has to go.
[3:50:00.000 --> 3:50:11.000]  They all go to hell because that's where they've taken us.
[3:50:11.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  They are normalizing nuclear war.
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:18.000]  They're talking about it all the time.
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:23.000]  That's when you know it's coming, when they normalize it.
[3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:27.000]  And these are abnormal people.
[3:50:27.000 --> 3:50:30.000]  They're sick.
[3:50:30.000 --> 3:50:32.000]  I love these headlines.
[3:50:32.000 --> 3:50:36.000]  Two Russians seek refuge in Alaska after fleeing draft.
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:45.000]  How about what about 70, 80, 100,000 Americans seek refuge in Canada during the Vietnam War?
[3:50:45.000 --> 3:50:48.000]  The hypocrisy.
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:51.000]  It's astounding.
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  Again, it's time for America to obey the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence,
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:01.000]  and the Bill of Rights, and our founding fathers,
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:07.000]  and stop getting involved in foreign entanglements.
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:11.000]  And you got guys like Lord Oystein and these other guys.
[3:51:11.000 --> 3:51:14.000]  Oh, you did a great job in Iraq, Lloyd.
[3:51:14.000 --> 3:51:17.000]  Love what you did in Afghanistan, Lloyd.
[3:51:17.000 --> 3:51:20.000]  Oh, and you're going to defeat the Russians.
[3:51:20.000 --> 3:51:23.000]  Oh, we're going to stop those Chinese, too.
[3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:24.000]  Yes, sir.
[3:51:24.000 --> 3:51:26.000]  Salute. Salute.
[3:51:26.000 --> 3:51:30.000]  There's your salute, man.
[3:51:30.000 --> 3:51:31.000]  Arrogance.
[3:51:31.000 --> 3:51:38.000]  Oh, the guy that was on the board of directors, the Raytheon, it's now a defense contractor.
[3:51:38.000 --> 3:51:40.000]  And I love this stuff.
[3:51:40.000 --> 3:51:47.000]  Oh, you know, the after, after, and we wrote this right, it's going to be in your Trends Journal this week.
[3:51:47.000 --> 3:51:53.000]  One of the top Ukrainians admitted, one of the top officials, that they bombed the way over Crimea
[3:51:53.000 --> 3:51:56.000]  and knocked out that bridge a week ago.
[3:51:56.000 --> 3:52:00.000]  This past Saturday, a week before, the Saturday before.
[3:52:00.000 --> 3:52:05.000]  And that's when Russia retaliated by bombs away over Kiev.
[3:52:05.000 --> 3:52:11.000]  And now the headlines, are they using Iranian drones?
[3:52:11.000 --> 3:52:15.000]  Oh, wow. My God, they're using Iranian drones?
[3:52:15.000 --> 3:52:23.000]  Hey, but it's OK for the Ukrainians to use American H.I.M.R.S.'s, whatever they are, Amos,
[3:52:23.000 --> 3:52:31.000]  and over 60, almost 70 billion dollars worth of armaments and money we sent to Ukraine.
[3:52:31.000 --> 3:52:36.000]  Oh, and the NATO and all the stuff that NATO sent them, it's OK for them to use those armaments,
[3:52:36.000 --> 3:52:40.000]  but they used Iranian drones.
[3:52:40.000 --> 3:52:50.000]  Ooh. A couple of drones compared to when you put it all together, probably almost 100 billion dollars.
[3:52:50.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  This war would have been over a long time ago.
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:53:04.000]  Again, we are going into the worst socioeconomic geopolitical crisis in human history if we don't change it.
[3:53:04.000 --> 3:53:09.000]  And Info Wars is doing things to stop that, as we are too, at the Trends Journal and Occupy Peace.
[3:53:09.000 --> 3:53:14.000]  So do what you can to support it. This is serious.
[3:53:14.000 --> 3:53:18.000]  We have mentally ill people that are deranged.
[3:53:18.000 --> 3:53:23.000]  Mentally, they belong in lunatic asylums.
[3:53:23.000 --> 3:53:28.000]  Eisenhower said that any man seeking you office a president, you could look this up,
[3:53:28.000 --> 3:53:32.000]  is either an egomaniac or crazy.
[3:53:32.000 --> 3:53:37.000]  And that's what we have.
[3:53:37.000 --> 3:53:44.000]  Wall Street Journal. Economists now expect a recession.
[3:53:44.000 --> 3:53:47.000]  Job losses by next year.
[3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:53.000]  Oh, now they, oh, I am an economist. We said a recession is happening a long time ago.
[3:53:53.000 --> 3:53:59.000]  Oh, now it's real. Oh, and the markets are up at 600 points when you're going into a recession.
[3:53:59.000 --> 3:54:05.000]  Every week in the Trends Journal, we have a list of layoffs.
[3:54:05.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  What a list. Big companies, one after another.
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:16.000]  And the markets are going up. Oh, and gold prices. They're a fraction of where they should be.
[3:54:16.000 --> 3:54:20.000]  A fraction. Why is it so low?
[3:54:20.000 --> 3:54:28.000]  I mentioned the JPMorgan Chase Gang got convicted of a felony for rigging the precious metals market.
[3:54:28.000 --> 3:54:33.000]  They paid a measly $900 million in 2019.
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:39.000]  Hey, how come Jamie Diamond didn't do any time in jail?
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:45.000]  Five felonies convicted of. Five. No time in jail.
[3:54:45.000 --> 3:54:50.000]  The markets, to me, are totally manipulated. The Plunge Protection Team.
[3:54:50.000 --> 3:54:54.000]  Isn't that a nice name for the rigging the markets?
[3:54:54.000 --> 3:54:59.000]  And what everybody forgets is that this thing was going down big time before.
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:03.000]  You go back to December 2018.
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  It was one of the worst December's in decades.
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:09.000]  And the stock markets.
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:14.000]  Trump pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed Powell to lower interest rates.
[3:55:14.000 --> 3:55:21.000]  The Fed had drone Powell, the clown boy who said temporary inflation, transitory inflation.
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:24.000]  And of course, now it's transgendatory inflation.
[3:55:24.000 --> 3:55:29.000]  Black woman inflation was skyrocketing to lower interest rates than he did.
[3:55:29.000 --> 3:55:33.000]  Then go back to September 2019.
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:42.000]  They were dumping money into the repo markets, the repurchasing markets, so the bankers could borrow cheap money so they could keep playing the game.
[3:55:42.000 --> 3:55:53.000]  They pumped in $7 trillion between September 2019 to January 2020, the year the rat, the year the COVID war began.
[3:55:53.000 --> 3:55:55.000]  This thing was going down big.
[3:55:55.000 --> 3:55:57.000]  And then there's office buildings.
[3:55:57.000 --> 3:56:02.000]  Office occupancy rate in the United States, only around 50%.
[3:56:02.000 --> 3:56:07.000]  All the businesses that depended on it on commuters, pup, finito.
[3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:11.000]  In Europe, office occupancy rate 46%.
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:14.000]  All the businesses that depended on it.
[3:56:14.000 --> 3:56:20.000]  In Italy, they're looking at over 100,000 medium and small businesses going out of business this year.
[3:56:20.000 --> 3:56:24.000]  Remember, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:56:24.000 --> 3:56:27.000]  World War II followed the Great Depression.
[3:56:27.000 --> 3:56:32.000]  The dot com, bust, the war on terror.
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:37.000]  And to me, as a guy that grew up, I'm born in 1946.
[3:56:37.000 --> 3:56:38.000]  I'm a lucky man.
[3:56:38.000 --> 3:56:46.000]  And Napolitano, born in the Bronx, born to be free, right when America is at its highest point after World War II.
[3:56:46.000 --> 3:56:50.000]  I've seen this country go down, and to me, three things brought it down.
[3:56:50.000 --> 3:57:03.000]  The freak Fauci with the age scare, the war on terror, and the freak Fauci with the COVID war.
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:06.000]  That changed America.
[3:57:06.000 --> 3:57:08.000]  Changed so much of it.
[3:57:08.000 --> 3:57:11.000]  I remember when it was fun to fly.
[3:57:11.000 --> 3:57:16.000]  They weren't feeling up. They had to go through electronic gizmos to get.
[3:57:16.000 --> 3:57:18.000]  Again, we're at a crucial time.
[3:57:18.000 --> 3:57:20.000]  Do what you can to support Info Wars.
