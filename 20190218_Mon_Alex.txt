[00:00.000 --> 00:09.360]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[00:09.360 --> 00:14.600]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:14.600 --> 00:24.140]  When the President states the obvious that there is a national emergency at the southern
[00:24.140 --> 00:38.680]  border and you see the Democrats react in total syndicated hysteria.
[00:38.680 --> 00:43.000]  You have to wonder why they're so panicked about this and why they're so freaked out
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.680]  about this national emergency, even though there have been dozens of national emergencies
[00:47.680 --> 00:54.360]  issued in the past, many of which are still on the books, one of which from President
[00:54.360 --> 01:00.640]  Trump over a year ago that the media barely even talked about.
[01:00.640 --> 01:02.000]  You want to know why?
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.360]  Here's the report from Greg Rees.
[01:04.360 --> 01:10.120]  The National Emergencies Act was enacted September 14th, 1976.
[01:10.120 --> 01:16.720]  The purpose was to regulate the number of laws granting special powers to the executive
[01:16.720 --> 01:21.320]  branch in times of national emergency.
[01:21.320 --> 01:26.680]  Congress can undo an emergency declaration with either a joint resolution and the President's
[01:26.680 --> 01:32.120]  signature or with two-thirds majority vote.
[01:32.120 --> 01:39.880]  As of February 2019, 59 national emergencies have been declared and more than 30 remain
[01:39.880 --> 01:42.920]  in effect.
[01:42.920 --> 01:50.200]  46 national emergencies declared by Bill Clinton are still in effect, 11 declared by George
[01:50.200 --> 01:58.520]  W. Bush are still in effect, and 10 by Barack Obama are still in effect.
[01:58.520 --> 02:04.160]  President Donald Trump has declared three national emergencies already and the so-called
[02:04.160 --> 02:11.320]  resistance has hardly mentioned them at all, including the national emergency with respect
[02:11.320 --> 02:17.400]  to blocking the property of persons involved in serious human rights abuse or corruption,
[02:17.400 --> 02:24.880]  which was signed on the first winter solstice of his presidency on December 21st, 2017.
[02:24.880 --> 02:30.520]  The President therein declared that the United States seeks to impose tangible and significant
[02:30.520 --> 02:38.320]  consequences on those who commit serious human rights abuse or engage in corruption and specifically
[02:38.320 --> 02:45.800]  targeted 13 individuals worldwide involved in international human trafficking, otherwise
[02:45.800 --> 02:49.000]  known as slavery.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.680]  The mainstream media let this national emergency go mostly unnoticed.
[02:54.680 --> 02:57.200]  Why?
[02:57.200 --> 03:02.440]  If one were to look into these 13 names, they would find several connections to the Clintons
[03:02.440 --> 03:07.040]  and the Clinton Foundation.
[03:07.040 --> 03:13.320]  Since the declaration of this national emergency in 2017, hundreds of arrests have been made
[03:13.320 --> 03:18.120]  and thousands of victims have been freed from bondage.
[03:18.120 --> 03:24.320]  And the corrupt legacy media has been utterly silent about it.
[03:24.320 --> 03:29.520]  And now President Trump has announced to declare a national emergency on the southern border
[03:29.520 --> 03:35.200]  to bring an end to the United Nations disastrous replacement migration program and to bring
[03:35.200 --> 03:42.680]  law and order to the entrenched black market economy of drugs and human trafficking.
[03:42.680 --> 03:49.560]  Of all national emergencies declared since 1976, this one stands out as perhaps the
[03:49.560 --> 03:53.880]  most important for national security.
[03:53.880 --> 03:58.560]  Securing our borders only stands to hurt the criminal elements that have been exploiting
[03:58.560 --> 04:01.560]  the system for years.
[04:01.560 --> 04:07.200]  And so naturally, the criminal cabal of deep state politicians and their establishment
[04:07.200 --> 04:11.880]  run media are all desperately trying to stop it.
[04:11.880 --> 04:17.240]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[04:17.240 --> 04:21.160]  You do the math, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:21.160 --> 04:25.880]  President Trump wants to stop human trafficking with a national emergency.
[04:25.880 --> 04:30.760]  President Trump wants to close the border with a national emergency.
[04:30.760 --> 04:37.240]  You've seen hundreds of arrests from coast to coast of human traffickers.
[04:37.240 --> 04:40.400]  They're cutting off the source from inside the states.
[04:40.400 --> 04:43.960]  They have to cut off the source coming in from the southern border.
[04:43.960 --> 04:45.800]  Why are the Democrats fighting it?
[04:45.800 --> 04:49.440]  Why are they totally panicked that this is what the president is trying to do?
[04:49.440 --> 04:56.120]  And why can't America get behind the president that he wants to stop human trafficking?
[04:56.120 --> 05:09.760]  Because the media lies about him all day long.
[05:09.760 --> 05:16.200]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[05:16.200 --> 05:21.920]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[05:21.920 --> 05:26.400]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in
[05:26.400 --> 05:28.840]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[05:28.840 --> 05:35.400]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[05:35.400 --> 05:38.280]  and beyond system in the world.
[05:38.280 --> 05:40.680]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[05:40.680 --> 05:45.240]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packets to mix it with fruit
[05:45.240 --> 05:47.640]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[05:47.640 --> 05:49.200]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[05:49.200 --> 05:53.680]  It lasts 10 hours, so take a half pack at the first time you take it because TurboForce
[05:53.680 --> 06:21.480]  is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive, TurboForce and M4sLive.com.
[06:21.480 --> 06:26.320]  Through action, a man becomes a hero.
[06:26.320 --> 06:29.640]  Through death, a hero becomes a legend.
[06:29.640 --> 06:32.800]  Through time, a legend becomes a myth.
[06:32.800 --> 06:37.800]  Through hearing a myth, a man takes action.
[06:37.800 --> 06:44.800]  Now what action are you going to take to spur that circle of life today?
[06:44.800 --> 06:46.640]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[06:46.640 --> 06:51.520]  This Monday, February 18th, 2019, filling in for Alex, I'm Owen Schreuer and we've
[06:51.520 --> 06:53.880]  got a ton of news to get to.
[06:53.880 --> 06:58.800]  I've got Stuart Rhodes coming in studio and since it looks like I'm going to be on the
[06:58.800 --> 07:02.560]  air for four hours today, I'm going to open up the phone lines and we'll be hearing from
[07:02.560 --> 07:03.560]  you as well.
[07:03.560 --> 07:06.120]  It is Presidents Day.
[07:06.120 --> 07:12.880]  Most nationally syndicated shows either run a best of or a rerun or have a guest host
[07:12.880 --> 07:17.200]  in today like I guess myself will probably be hearing from Alex before the end of the
[07:17.200 --> 07:18.200]  show.
[07:18.200 --> 07:24.920]  That's just my guess, but I know that America wants to speak today on Presidents Day, probably
[07:24.920 --> 07:30.120]  show their appreciation for the president yesterday.
[07:30.120 --> 07:39.080]  President Trump was golfing with Rush Limbaugh Mulvaney on Palm Beach, Nick Mulvaney from
[07:39.080 --> 07:50.720]  his staff, and can you even imagine how angry the leftist media must be?
[07:50.720 --> 07:58.640]  First President Trump tweets out a Carpe Donkton video of the Democrats crying during
[07:58.640 --> 08:00.040]  the State of the Union Address.
[08:00.040 --> 08:02.360]  They hate to see America succeeding.
[08:02.360 --> 08:09.320]  So Trump trolls that was after he trolled them during the National Emergency Press Conference.
[08:09.320 --> 08:11.560]  Then Twitter censors that video.
[08:11.560 --> 08:14.440]  He re-uploads it with a different song.
[08:14.440 --> 08:19.840]  Lee Greenwood proud to be an American showing the Democrats being ticked off to be an American.
[08:19.840 --> 08:25.040]  You know, Joe Biden says he's, I mean, think about Joe Biden saying that America is an
[08:25.040 --> 08:26.040]  embarrassment.
[08:26.040 --> 08:29.920]  Joe, you were just in power for eight years.
[08:29.920 --> 08:34.720]  So if America is an embarrassment, it's because of you.
[08:34.720 --> 08:36.680]  And of course, isn't that the ultimate truth?
[08:36.680 --> 08:40.960]  America is or was an embarrassment because of people like Joe Biden.
[08:40.960 --> 08:43.720]  And I can't wait for Joe Biden to run for president.
[08:43.720 --> 08:45.200]  Go, Joe.
[08:45.200 --> 08:46.360]  Run, Joe.
[08:46.360 --> 08:47.360]  Guess what?
[08:47.360 --> 08:51.720]  All those videos of you groping children, they're going to go mainstream, Joe.
[08:51.720 --> 08:54.600]  They'll show them on Fox News.
[08:54.600 --> 08:57.560]  Oh, run, Joe.
[08:57.560 --> 08:59.560]  Run.
[08:59.560 --> 09:02.160]  You run, Joe.
[09:02.160 --> 09:03.160]  You run, Joe.
[09:03.160 --> 09:04.160]  That's right.
[09:04.160 --> 09:15.200]  In fact, they'll even show them on CNN because folks, let me just put it this way.
[09:15.200 --> 09:18.400]  We're in the final movements.
[09:18.400 --> 09:27.000]  We're in the final revolutions before the 2020 campaign cycle really heats up.
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.200]  In the next month or so, a lot of pieces are going to be moving.
[09:31.200 --> 09:38.720]  A lot of things are going to be shifting to set the playing field for the 2020 run.
[09:38.720 --> 09:44.240]  And it's really going to heat up in summer, but this is going to be a special one.
[09:44.240 --> 09:47.560]  This is going to be a special one, so it may even heat up in May.
[09:47.560 --> 09:52.480]  In fact, that's when I think it's all going to pop off, probably definitely by June, but
[09:52.480 --> 09:54.320]  maybe even in May.
[09:54.320 --> 10:00.920]  So you're seeing all the final revolutions, all the final pieces being put into place
[10:00.920 --> 10:06.680]  before the big 2020 run, which is going to be so epic, honestly, when I think about
[10:06.680 --> 10:11.680]  it, I can't even really comprehend it yet, I think.
[10:11.680 --> 10:17.560]  I mean, the Democrats are going to be such a circus.
[10:17.560 --> 10:21.280]  I don't even think we can even comprehend it.
[10:21.280 --> 10:26.720]  They're going to eat themselves, and it's going to be a race to the finish line of who
[10:26.720 --> 10:28.320]  hates Trump the most.
[10:28.320 --> 10:31.560]  And guess what, America ain't buying it anymore.
[10:31.560 --> 10:38.520]  They've been hearing it for two freaking years, plus, and all he's done is delivered.
[10:38.520 --> 10:48.400]  Oh, and if he gets that wall by election 2020, it's game over, and they know it.
[10:48.400 --> 10:59.880]  And they're so detached from society, they're prancing around in rainbow sequined jackets.
[10:59.880 --> 11:10.280]  Cortez is calling for total authoritarian totalitarianism in the West.
[11:10.280 --> 11:13.520]  Oh boy.
[11:13.520 --> 11:15.080]  Wow.
[11:15.080 --> 11:20.720]  Again, it just hits me.
[11:20.720 --> 11:26.960]  And then, folks, you need to go, I've said this yesterday, I cannot iterate this enough.
[11:26.960 --> 11:35.280]  This video that Gregory's made needs to see 100 million computer screens.
[11:35.280 --> 11:39.480]  It tells you everything.
[11:39.480 --> 11:44.360]  Why do you think the entire establishment is against Donald Trump?
[11:44.360 --> 11:50.080]  Folks, everybody knows how corrupt this country is, okay?
[11:50.080 --> 11:53.200]  Everybody knows that there's just mass criminality.
[11:53.200 --> 11:59.920]  In fact, because of the way the world is now, with technology and the internet and the ability
[11:59.920 --> 12:06.320]  to travel, today's criminals are the greatest criminals in world history.
[12:06.320 --> 12:16.840]  So dealing with this worldwide criminal network is pretty tough, and one man decided he was
[12:16.840 --> 12:23.880]  going to put it all on the line and face them down and square them down and not back down.
[12:23.880 --> 12:27.160]  And we hope he doesn't back down.
[12:27.160 --> 12:33.520]  So you know what, on this president's day, while I have been a fair critic of Trump
[12:33.520 --> 12:42.360]  at times, I have to admire this man.
[12:42.360 --> 12:48.840]  Maybe not the man we wanted, but maybe the man we needed.
[12:48.840 --> 13:00.960]  Not perfect, but just imperfect enough to get the job done.
[13:00.960 --> 13:07.400]  And they're going to sit here and lie about President Trump and lie about President Trump's
[13:07.400 --> 13:10.800]  supporters, and they're going to try to destroy this country.
[13:10.800 --> 13:12.680]  And they're going to tell you it's not great.
[13:12.680 --> 13:14.160]  They're going to tell you it's an embarrassment.
[13:14.160 --> 13:16.440]  They're going to tell you it's racist.
[13:16.440 --> 13:22.920]  But see, the justy-smallest story really sums everything up that you need to know about
[13:22.920 --> 13:25.320]  the left in America.
[13:25.320 --> 13:37.960]  One, they stage a hate crime to make you think something that isn't actually real, and then
[13:37.960 --> 13:41.200]  to get your affection and play the victim.
[13:41.200 --> 13:43.680]  Total liars, total frauds.
[13:43.680 --> 13:51.560]  Then you have the mainstream media carry that torch all the way and won't even retract
[13:51.560 --> 13:56.160]  it now that we know it was a total hoax.
[13:56.160 --> 14:02.480]  Meanwhile, Trump supporters are actually being harassed.
[14:02.480 --> 14:07.160]  I got a video of a 14-year-old getting yelled at at a store.
[14:07.160 --> 14:15.400]  You heard the story about a man pulling a gun on a couple wearing a Trump hat.
[14:15.400 --> 14:16.840]  Those are just two recent stories.
[14:16.840 --> 14:21.640]  I mean, you've got almost a thousand cases on the rap sheet at Breitbart.com.
[14:21.640 --> 14:26.560]  I've got like five cases on that I don't even make that list yet because I haven't submitted
[14:26.560 --> 14:27.560]  them.
[14:27.560 --> 14:29.520]  Imagine how many others are out there.
[14:29.520 --> 14:36.560]  Oh, but justy-small that fakes his own hate crime.
[14:36.560 --> 14:40.880]  And the media runs with the narrative, and it gets all the attention.
[14:40.880 --> 14:46.800]  But you know what the sickest part of it is, ladies and gentlemen, you want the real window
[14:46.800 --> 14:49.200]  into the soul of the left.
[14:49.200 --> 14:52.440]  You really want to know who these people are.
[14:52.440 --> 14:57.160]  They wanted the small attack to be true.
[14:57.160 --> 15:00.600]  They wanted it to be true.
[15:00.600 --> 15:08.320]  They got off thinking that a gay guy and a black man was attacked in this country.
[15:08.320 --> 15:11.200]  That's why they all rushed to cover it.
[15:11.200 --> 15:14.960]  That's why they all rushed to say it was true.
[15:14.960 --> 15:16.920]  That's why they all hopped on board.
[15:16.920 --> 15:22.200]  That's why they were crying with him on Good Morning America because that's the left.
[15:22.200 --> 15:25.080]  That's the America the left wants to see.
[15:25.080 --> 15:26.960]  They want there to be hatred.
[15:26.960 --> 15:29.920]  They want there to be division.
[15:29.920 --> 15:34.000]  That's who these people are.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.600]  And they know it, and that's why they project it onto everyone else because it's who they
[15:38.600 --> 15:41.440]  really are.
[15:41.440 --> 15:44.880]  Damn it.
[15:44.880 --> 15:46.160]  It's not America.
[15:46.160 --> 15:49.360]  Jesse Smallette is not America.
[15:49.360 --> 15:54.880]  That is a commie scumbag right there.
[15:54.880 --> 15:55.880]  Go home, commie.
[15:55.880 --> 15:59.520]  You're looking at three years of jail, bud.
[15:59.520 --> 16:03.280]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[16:03.280 --> 16:08.040]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally
[16:08.040 --> 16:09.960]  at Heart and Body Extract?
[16:09.960 --> 16:13.120]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[16:13.120 --> 16:14.480]  Don't just take my word for it.

[16:26.920 --> 16:29.120]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:29.120 --> 16:35.320]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[16:35.320 --> 16:39.840]  Did you know the official National American flag has never been manufactured for retail
[16:39.840 --> 16:40.840]  stores?
[16:40.840 --> 16:42.720]  The one that Americans fought and died for.
[16:42.720 --> 16:45.560]  The one symbol that represents our Constitution.
[16:45.560 --> 16:48.960]  Now you can be a part of this great movement that's never been seen before.
[16:48.960 --> 16:51.400]  Together, we'll recapture America.
[16:51.400 --> 16:58.960]  Call 1-877-383-4777 or visit theofficialflag.com, theofficialflag.com.
[16:58.960 --> 17:04.360]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[17:04.360 --> 17:05.360]  the world.
[17:05.360 --> 17:08.360]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:08.360 --> 17:14.320]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:14.320 --> 17:18.120]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.

[20:02.920 --> 20:30.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:33.920 --> 20:40.680]  If the President can declare an emergency today on this nonce, on this, the Democratic
[20:40.680 --> 20:46.120]  President can decide that, as you mentioned, the 40,000 people a year killed in his country
[20:46.120 --> 20:50.360]  is a crisis, and why don't we take everybody's guns away, or force everybody to register
[20:50.360 --> 20:54.200]  their guns, or ban all assault rifles, or do all of that.
[20:54.200 --> 20:59.200]  The Republicans have some unease about it, no matter what they say, because if the President
[20:59.200 --> 21:05.920]  can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency, an illusion
[21:05.920 --> 21:11.520]  that he wants to convey, just think of what a President with different values can present
[21:11.520 --> 21:12.520]  to the American people.
[21:12.520 --> 21:14.920]  You want to talk about a national emergency?
[21:14.920 --> 21:21.440]  Let's talk about today, the one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of
[21:21.440 --> 21:23.640]  gun violence in America.
[21:23.640 --> 21:25.160]  That's a national emergency.
[21:25.160 --> 21:30.920]  Why don't you declare that emergency?
[21:30.920 --> 21:37.800]  So there you have Democrats Jerry Nadler and Nancy Pelosi showing you their true colors.
[21:37.800 --> 21:43.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, how do you respond to the President declaring a national emergency
[21:43.320 --> 21:47.120]  at the southern border, where there clearly is a national emergency?
[21:47.120 --> 21:51.440]  I mean, if the Democrats that say there's family separations happening there, that's
[21:51.440 --> 21:55.480]  the worst thing ever, it's the Democrats saying kids are being put in the cages.
[21:55.480 --> 21:58.880]  So just by their own rhetoric, you'd think that they'd say there's a national emergency.
[21:58.880 --> 22:02.040]  But no, somehow there's not.
[22:02.040 --> 22:03.720]  But what do they do in response?
[22:03.720 --> 22:09.480]  They say, well, we're just going to have to come after the guns then, if the President
[22:09.480 --> 22:15.560]  is going to go so extreme to the right that he wants to have a border, well, we're going
[22:15.560 --> 22:19.640]  to have to go so extreme to the left and just confiscate your guns.
[22:19.640 --> 22:20.640]  Sorry.
[22:20.640 --> 22:24.960]  That's how we roll, we're the Democrats.
[22:24.960 --> 22:28.120]  Second Amendment shall not be infringed.
[22:28.120 --> 22:29.120]  What's that?
[22:29.120 --> 22:41.880]  I mean, anybody left in the West with any common sense or logic whatsoever is leaving the Democrat
[22:41.880 --> 22:43.840]  party.
[22:43.840 --> 22:48.400]  But that's why they're bringing in a brand new crop of voters.
[22:48.400 --> 22:51.960]  Don't you get it?
[22:51.960 --> 22:55.960]  That's why they want to keep people poor.
[22:55.960 --> 22:58.360]  That's why they want to keep people sick.
[22:58.360 --> 23:01.240]  I mean, think about that.
[23:01.240 --> 23:14.760]  They want to keep people sick so they can sell you government health care.
[23:14.760 --> 23:16.600]  So that's just who the Democrats are.
[23:16.600 --> 23:20.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, Nancy Pelosi says it's an illusion that there's any problem at the
[23:20.120 --> 23:23.880]  southern border.
[23:23.880 --> 23:25.920]  There's nothing to see here.
[23:25.920 --> 23:28.400]  What is that movie?
[23:28.400 --> 23:33.880]  That famous movie where the guy's like, there's nothing to see here.
[23:33.880 --> 23:38.040]  Go about your business and there's just mass explosions happening behind him like the whole
[23:38.040 --> 23:39.040]  world is collapsing.
[23:39.040 --> 23:41.520]  Oh, no, no, no, nothing to see here, folks.
[23:41.520 --> 23:42.520]  Go about your day.
[23:42.520 --> 23:47.120]  Please turn around.
[23:47.120 --> 23:48.960]  Let's go with images here.
[23:48.960 --> 23:50.960]  Nothing to see here.
[23:50.960 --> 23:53.040]  No one crossing the border illegally.
[23:53.040 --> 23:55.880]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:55.880 --> 23:59.200]  No struggle with law enforcement.
[23:59.200 --> 24:10.040]  There was just a guy who's the national spokesperson for ICE who's like, look, we've got nothing
[24:10.040 --> 24:11.720]  to see here.
[24:11.720 --> 24:12.960]  Please disperse.
[24:12.960 --> 24:13.960]  Nothing to see.
[24:13.960 --> 24:14.960]  Yes.
[24:14.960 --> 24:16.200]  Please go home.
[24:16.200 --> 24:22.960]  He's like, we take in these people every day and they are riddled with disease.
[24:22.960 --> 24:25.360]  In fact, look at this.
[24:25.360 --> 24:29.240]  This was pointed out by our own Harrison Smith.
[24:29.240 --> 24:34.040]  In the state of Washington, this is CNN.
[24:34.040 --> 24:36.440]  Take that into consideration, CNN.
[24:36.440 --> 24:44.000]  In the state of Washington, 36 confirmed cases of measles.
[24:44.000 --> 24:45.800]  And guess what the state of Washington did?
[24:45.800 --> 24:49.880]  They declared a state of emergency.
[24:49.880 --> 24:56.280]  So you have 36 cases of measles in Washington and that's a national emergency or excuse
[24:56.280 --> 24:59.000]  me, a state of emergency in Washington.
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.680]  But you have at least 2000 people that we know of coming across the border illegally
[25:04.680 --> 25:11.600]  every day, many of them with infectious disease and that's nothing.
[25:11.600 --> 25:13.200]  Nothing to see here.
[25:13.200 --> 25:16.040]  Democrats call for gun control.
[25:16.040 --> 25:24.840]  There's guns being run across the border by Democrats.
[25:24.840 --> 25:31.400]  And so that's why it's just so frustrating to have to come on here and it's almost like
[25:31.400 --> 25:35.040]  common sense is a revolutionary thing.
[25:35.040 --> 25:39.360]  Logic and reasoning is a revolutionary thing, but it's not even that.
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.120]  It's like some people can't even comprehend it.
[25:44.120 --> 25:48.200]  They don't even get it.
[25:48.200 --> 25:52.760]  Now we're going to be joined by Alex Jones in the third hour today.
[25:52.760 --> 25:55.720]  As I said, Stuart Rhodes will be in studio with me in the second hour and then he'll
[25:55.720 --> 25:59.600]  come back in the fourth and we'll take your phone calls.
[25:59.600 --> 26:03.160]  But before I go on and get to some of this big news and get into the latest with this
[26:03.160 --> 26:13.840]  Jesse Small, that thing, here was a story that came out today that also was on Drudge.
[26:13.840 --> 26:20.200]  Average U.S. home may have air quality levels comparable to polluted major city shocking
[26:20.200 --> 26:21.200]  study fines.
[26:21.200 --> 26:25.080]  Now look, there have been multiple studies about this.
[26:25.080 --> 26:27.080]  You can look at air quality in your home.
[26:27.080 --> 26:28.480]  You can look at the studies that have been done.
[26:28.480 --> 26:29.920]  This is just the latest.
[26:29.920 --> 26:31.040]  It's not good.
[26:31.040 --> 26:35.680]  And when you see the studies, you want to do something about it.
[26:35.680 --> 26:36.840]  At least that's how we are.
[26:36.840 --> 26:39.360]  Again, this is logic and reasoning.
[26:39.360 --> 26:40.920]  We see studies.
[26:40.920 --> 26:42.440]  We see the science.
[26:42.440 --> 26:44.160]  There's major toxins in the air.
[26:44.160 --> 26:45.600]  There's major pollutants in the air.
[26:45.600 --> 26:48.640]  It gets into your home and now your home is polluted.
[26:48.640 --> 26:50.720]  The air in your house is polluted.
[26:50.720 --> 26:52.120]  So we see that stuff.
[26:52.120 --> 26:53.220]  We're observant.
[26:53.220 --> 26:54.600]  We report it.
[26:54.600 --> 26:55.600]  And then we take action.
[26:55.600 --> 26:58.880]  We say, well, what do you do if your house is polluted?
[26:58.880 --> 27:03.880]  I guess this is probably something that's relatively new to society in the last maybe
[27:03.880 --> 27:07.280]  20, 30, 40, 50 years.
[27:07.280 --> 27:10.840]  And so we look for a solution.
[27:10.840 --> 27:16.000]  So we have the best air filters at infowarstore.com.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.160]  The Alexa Pure Breeze.
[27:17.160 --> 27:24.560]  And it's on sale right now, $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster technology
[27:24.560 --> 27:26.200]  for a better air filter.

[27:29.440 --> 27:30.440]  They are magic.
[27:30.440 --> 27:35.600]  We have them in every corner and crevice of the office here at InfoWars.
[27:35.600 --> 27:39.800]  So again, they say, oh, you're snake oil salesman.
[27:39.800 --> 27:45.960]  Oh, you sell goods that people don't need or oh, you engage in fear mongering and then
[27:45.960 --> 27:48.680]  claim that they need your products.
[27:48.680 --> 27:51.920]  I am not the one that wrote this story on study finds.
[27:51.920 --> 27:58.320]  I am not the University of Colorado Boulder that did this study about air toxicity in
[27:58.320 --> 27:59.320]  your home.
[27:59.320 --> 28:00.320]  Okay.
[28:00.320 --> 28:01.320]  That wasn't InfoWars.
[28:01.320 --> 28:02.320]  That wasn't us.
[28:02.320 --> 28:03.320]  That was other parties.
[28:03.320 --> 28:05.760]  That was third parties just doing scientific research.
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.040]  We just see the science and then provide you a solution.
[28:10.040 --> 28:18.800]  So when you find out that the air quality in your home is as bad as a major city, you
[28:18.800 --> 28:20.000]  want to take action.
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.400]  You want to get an air filter.

[31:59.880 --> 32:03.920]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[32:03.920 --> 32:09.160]  from the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[32:09.160 --> 32:12.080]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[32:12.080 --> 32:16.200]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've
[32:16.200 --> 32:18.960]  gone through two permutations.
[32:18.960 --> 32:23.080]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists
[32:23.080 --> 32:25.040]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[32:25.040 --> 32:30.200]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been
[32:30.200 --> 32:31.200]  incredible.
[32:31.200 --> 32:36.240]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[32:36.240 --> 32:38.520]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[32:38.520 --> 32:43.160]  Chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three
[32:43.160 --> 32:50.000]  other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more
[32:50.000 --> 32:51.000]  bioavailable.
[32:51.000 --> 32:55.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[32:55.640 --> 32:56.640]  discovery.
[32:56.640 --> 33:25.400]  That's three, now available at InfowarsLife.com.
[33:34.240 --> 33:45.840]  Just think about the consequences of a consortium of national media going along with a false
[33:45.840 --> 33:48.840]  narrative.
[33:48.840 --> 33:51.680]  Well, there's many consequences.
[33:51.680 --> 34:00.760]  There's the effect of brainwashing the masses and there's the effect of pulling off major
[34:00.760 --> 34:03.920]  hoaxes.
[34:03.920 --> 34:09.520]  And so when you look at the Jesse Smollett story, yeah, okay.
[34:09.520 --> 34:14.280]  He staged his attack, he's a liar, he's a con man, whatever.
[34:14.280 --> 34:17.400]  Who knows what else was behind it?
[34:17.400 --> 34:23.600]  He's done multiple rallies with Kamala Harris and Adam Schiff.
[34:23.600 --> 34:25.280]  So he's in the Democrat Party.
[34:25.280 --> 34:28.680]  I mean, he is an active Democrat.
[34:28.680 --> 34:38.320]  So is he like the new Aaron Black of the Democrat Party that tries to start riots in the streets?
[34:38.320 --> 34:42.440]  That's just Project Veritas' unedited video, what the Democrats do.
[34:42.440 --> 34:43.920]  They start riots in the streets.
[34:43.920 --> 34:47.880]  Their own people caught, Bob Cramer fired, Aaron Black fired.
[34:47.880 --> 34:50.240]  These people worked for Hillary Clinton.
[34:50.240 --> 34:53.360]  And so now they go out, they get a Jesse Smollett.
[34:53.360 --> 34:59.640]  He's tapped into the Democrat Party.
[34:59.640 --> 35:06.840]  He goes out, performs a major hate crime hoax, and the entire lapdog press hops on board
[35:06.840 --> 35:12.760]  to amplify and blow the whole thing up and out of proportion.
[35:12.760 --> 35:15.480]  And the whole thing was fake.
[35:15.480 --> 35:23.000]  So look, I mean, whatever Jesse Smollett's future is, will be.
[35:23.000 --> 35:36.880]  But now, what will be the scope of this investigation and will it lead back to the Democrat Party?
[35:36.880 --> 35:42.120]  And what are the implications of that?
[35:42.120 --> 35:44.720]  And again, that's not far-fetched to say.
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.600]  It's not out of line for me to say, hmm, I wonder if the Democrat Party had anything
[35:48.600 --> 35:51.240]  to do with staging the Jesse Smollett attack.
[35:51.240 --> 35:52.240]  Absolutely.
[35:52.240 --> 35:53.480]  I'm well-rounded to say that.
[35:53.480 --> 35:57.400]  In fact, I'm smart and informed for thinking that.
[35:57.400 --> 36:03.520]  If you don't think that, you're the fool.
[36:03.520 --> 36:07.960]  But who knows if that will come out.
[36:07.960 --> 36:10.960]  So what's the story?
[36:10.960 --> 36:19.440]  Jesse Smollett, this is what we know so far, allegedly pays these two extras that he met
[36:19.440 --> 36:28.840]  from Empire, or knew from Empire, and stages an entire event with ropes and MAGA hats in
[36:28.840 --> 36:34.960]  the whole nine yards, goes and files a false police report, and then does a media tour
[36:34.960 --> 36:39.600]  crying about how he was a victim of a hate crime.
[36:39.600 --> 36:47.400]  And then it all is exposed, and now we wait and see where the pieces fall into place.
[36:47.400 --> 36:55.520]  But really more than anything, Jesse Smollett, again, his future, his destiny will be.
[36:55.520 --> 36:58.200]  But what of the media?
[36:58.200 --> 37:00.360]  What of the media?
[37:00.360 --> 37:05.560]  Because as Will Chamberlain pointed out very aptly on Twitter, and helped me get a clear
[37:05.560 --> 37:09.800]  picture of this, they wanted this attack to be real.
[37:09.800 --> 37:12.520]  They wanted Smollett to be a victim of a hate crime.
[37:12.520 --> 37:14.400]  They wanted America to be racist.
[37:14.400 --> 37:16.640]  They wanted the Trump supporter to be racist.
[37:16.640 --> 37:21.960]  They wanted there to be hate, because that's the only way they can mask their own hate
[37:21.960 --> 37:26.560]  and their own racism.
[37:26.560 --> 37:34.560]  But again, what are the implications of a media that knowingly goes along with a hate crime
[37:34.560 --> 37:40.720]  hoax, drumming up racial division in this country on the heels of the most racially
[37:40.720 --> 37:44.880]  divisive administration in the history of this country?
[37:44.880 --> 37:51.920]  Well, let's go to Najee Ali, who's a black civil rights activist, who tells you what
[37:51.920 --> 37:55.680]  the real implications of this could have been.
[37:55.680 --> 38:00.000]  Jesse Smollett must be brought to justice for lying.
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.880]  Within the day, we believe Smollett at the beginning, we gave him the benefit of the
[38:04.880 --> 38:05.880]  doubt.
[38:05.880 --> 38:11.840]  But over the last few days, we've seen this campaign of lies by Smollett continue to
[38:11.840 --> 38:13.080]  be unraveled.
[38:13.080 --> 38:18.400]  And that's why we believe Smollett is lying and should be brought to justice for lying
[38:18.400 --> 38:20.000]  to authorities.
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.360]  Also, Smollett could have created a race war.
[38:25.360 --> 38:30.240]  There are many African Americans and many members of the LGBTQ community who were very upset
[38:30.240 --> 38:34.480]  and outraged by Smollett claiming he was attacked and victimized.
[38:34.480 --> 38:35.480]  Now pause it right there.
[38:35.480 --> 38:38.840]  Pause it right there and rewind it 15 seconds.
[38:38.840 --> 38:42.280]  That's the key right there.
[38:42.280 --> 38:54.000]  Folks, they have been pushing for a race war in this country for 10 years.
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.400]  They are the racists.
[38:56.400 --> 39:01.920]  They are the ones that want a race war, folks.
[39:01.920 --> 39:09.160]  And Najee Ali says it right here and it could not be more true.
[39:09.160 --> 39:15.480]  The actions of Jesse Smollett and the media could have started a race war in this country.
[39:15.480 --> 39:20.880]  And dare I say, that's what they wanted.
[39:20.880 --> 39:26.400]  Now let's finish the clip of the black civil rights activist Najee Ali calling out Jesse
[39:26.400 --> 39:27.400]  Smollett.
[39:27.400 --> 39:32.080]  Smollett could have created a race war.
[39:32.080 --> 39:36.400]  There are many African Americans and many members of the LGBTQ community who were very
[39:36.400 --> 39:41.680]  upset and outraged by Smollett claiming he was attacked and victimized.
[39:41.680 --> 39:46.080]  So there were some in those communities whose thoughts are more extreme.
[39:46.080 --> 39:47.960]  They wanted to retaliate.
[39:47.960 --> 39:53.520]  I'm one of the activists that called for calm and peace and we're hopeful that calm and
[39:53.520 --> 39:59.840]  peace will continue, but at the end of the day Smollett claims of being abused and attacked
[39:59.840 --> 40:05.400]  and the victim of a hate crime and racism is nothing but a big lie and he needs to stop
[40:05.400 --> 40:06.400]  it.
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.400]  So if Jesse Smollett really wants to do what's right, he'll stop lying.
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.280]  He'll stop this campaign of lies because we believe he's lying and at the end of the day
[40:15.280 --> 40:18.840]  Smollett really wants to help, just apologize.
[40:18.840 --> 40:25.040]  Just say you're sorry, you made a mistake, but stop lying, stop this lying because Jesse,
[40:25.040 --> 40:30.760]  you're losing credibility and at the end of the day more and more people are not believing
[40:30.760 --> 40:31.760]  you.
[40:31.760 --> 40:38.920]  So we want you to know that if you say you're sorry that we'll support you and forgive you,
[40:38.920 --> 40:42.120]  but you must be brought to justice and held accountable at the end of the day for what
[40:42.120 --> 40:48.920]  you've done wrong because you put many lives in danger, many lives at a risk in the African
[40:48.920 --> 40:55.760]  American community and the LGBT community, so right now we'll have some more comments.
[40:55.760 --> 41:01.080]  You know, now that we know Jesse Smollett is a total liar, I think we have to really
[41:01.080 --> 41:02.960]  call everything into question.
[41:02.960 --> 41:05.160]  Is he even gay?
[41:05.160 --> 41:08.840]  Maybe he's faking gay to make it in Hollywood, wouldn't be the first Democrat to fake something
[41:08.840 --> 41:09.840]  to make it?
[41:09.840 --> 41:10.840]  Elizabeth Warren?
[41:10.840 --> 41:12.240]  So I'm just asking questions here.
[41:12.240 --> 41:17.480]  We just know Smollett's a total liar, a total fraud, could he be faking being gay?
[41:17.480 --> 41:20.760]  I'm just asking the questions here.
[41:20.760 --> 41:33.920]  Now listen to the response from the outing of the hoax crime of Jesse Smollett on CNN.
[41:33.920 --> 41:40.360]  And look, we don't know what happened to Jesse, but what we do know is that racism is alive
[41:40.360 --> 41:45.680]  and well in this country, homophobia is alive and well in this country, 2017 set a record
[41:45.680 --> 41:51.760]  for the number of hate crimes and the president and his rhetoric has been cited by people
[41:51.760 --> 41:54.680]  who, there is real evidence of people who have done these crimes, who cite that the
[41:54.680 --> 41:56.520]  president has inspired them.
[41:56.520 --> 42:03.880]  But is that why people just, I mean, do you see how sick these people are?
[42:03.880 --> 42:08.720]  Their response to Smollett, okay, so here's Brian Stelter with reliable sources.
[42:08.720 --> 42:13.720]  I mean, this woman's clearly reliable and they're like, okay.
[42:13.720 --> 42:18.040]  And Stelter was one of the first people, because he got the info from the cops that told him
[42:18.040 --> 42:19.800]  the whole thing was a hoax crime.
[42:19.800 --> 42:23.800]  So he was one of the first to come out and say it was a hoax to try to cover his own
[42:23.800 --> 42:26.560]  ass and cover CNN's ass.
[42:26.560 --> 42:32.320]  And then so they're like, oh, Jesse Smollett faked the whole thing, he staged it, and
[42:32.320 --> 42:38.240]  this woman, it's her turn on the panel and she says, yes, but America's racist.
[42:38.240 --> 42:44.320]  And in fact, I bet you it will eventually happen someday on one of these news networks.
[42:44.320 --> 42:48.360]  They'll be talking about how racist America is and how hateful everything is, and they'll
[42:48.360 --> 42:51.120]  cite the Jesse Smollett story.
[42:51.120 --> 42:55.320]  And it will be the most classic clip of all time because everybody knew it was fake, but
[42:55.320 --> 43:00.200]  they believed it anyway and they will all the way.
[43:00.200 --> 43:05.040]  For those looking for the ultimate source of energy for their day, every day, the brain

[46:58.400 --> 47:25.160]  It's that simple m4slife.com.
[47:25.160 --> 47:30.000]  The Democratic president can decide that, as you mentioned, the 40,000 people a year
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.480]  killed in this country is a crisis and why don't we take everybody's guns away or force
[47:34.480 --> 47:38.640]  everybody to register their guns or ban all assault rifles or do all of that.
[47:38.640 --> 47:44.000]  I know the Republicans have some unease about it no matter what they say because the president
[47:44.000 --> 47:50.720]  can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency and an illusion
[47:50.720 --> 47:56.280]  that he wants to convey, just think of what a president with different values can present
[47:56.280 --> 47:57.280]  to the American people.
[47:57.280 --> 47:59.680]  You want to talk about a national emergency?
[47:59.680 --> 48:06.200]  Let's talk about today, the one year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of
[48:06.200 --> 48:08.400]  gun violence in America.
[48:08.400 --> 48:09.920]  That's a national emergency.
[48:09.920 --> 48:12.480]  Why don't you declare that emergency, Mr. President?
[48:12.480 --> 48:15.800]  I wish you would.
[48:15.800 --> 48:26.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, the most dangerous animal is a wounded and cornered animal.
[48:26.440 --> 48:32.720]  What you just saw, put Nancy Pelosi back on screen, in fact, run the b-roll.
[48:32.720 --> 48:41.960]  That is a wounded, scared and cornered animal right there.
[48:41.960 --> 48:48.240]  Just watch her mannerism change as she goes into her talking point about taking guns.
[48:48.240 --> 48:52.120]  She's smiley, happy, and then the evil takes over.
[48:52.120 --> 48:56.400]  The power to take your freedom.
[48:56.400 --> 49:00.400]  That just lust for total control.
[49:00.400 --> 49:02.440]  Go back to it.
[49:02.440 --> 49:05.960]  Just look at Nancy Pelosi.
[49:05.960 --> 49:18.320]  That if an imperial commander could somehow be zapped into our reality, it would be Nancy
[49:18.320 --> 49:19.320]  Pelosi.
[49:19.320 --> 49:21.080]  That's her.
[49:21.080 --> 49:22.560]  She wants your guns.
[49:22.560 --> 49:24.640]  She wants your life.
[49:24.640 --> 49:26.320]  She doesn't want you to have safety.
[49:26.320 --> 49:27.900]  She doesn't want you to have a border.
[49:27.900 --> 49:29.640]  She doesn't want you to have security.
[49:29.640 --> 49:35.280]  She doesn't want you to have the right to protect yourself, but she'll get all of that.
[49:35.280 --> 49:37.120]  She doesn't want you to have a bunch of money.
[49:37.120 --> 49:46.200]  Oh, but don't you worry, she'll have plenty of mula.
[49:46.200 --> 49:54.400]  President Trump tweets this out this morning, wow, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI
[49:54.400 --> 49:56.280]  director Andrew McCabe.
[49:56.280 --> 50:00.280]  He was fired for lying and now his story gets even more deranged.
[50:00.280 --> 50:05.840]  He and Rod Rosenstein, who was hired by Jeff Sessions, look like they were planning a very
[50:05.840 --> 50:12.200]  illegal act and got caught.
[50:12.200 --> 50:19.960]  Look like they were planning a very illegal act and got caught.
[50:19.960 --> 50:32.520]  Russian collusion, Russian dossier, FISA warrants, wearing a wire, 25th amendment.
[50:32.520 --> 50:39.320]  And that's just post election.
[50:39.320 --> 50:42.440]  Think about the Democrats prior to the election.
[50:42.440 --> 50:58.000]  No servers, I mean, not just Hillary's, the DNC, the D triple C, Seth Rich, Wienergate.
[50:58.000 --> 51:08.720]  So you have to think about what does a major criminal network?
[51:08.720 --> 51:20.720]  What does a cold blooded criminal do when their entire castle is being stormed, when
[51:20.720 --> 51:28.120]  their entire way of life, their entire criminal network is being invaded and deconstructed?
[51:28.120 --> 51:30.720]  What do they do?
[51:30.720 --> 51:34.720]  Well, they're desperate.
[51:34.720 --> 51:38.320]  And you have to understand something else about criminal psychology.
[51:38.320 --> 51:42.840]  There is no backing down.
[51:42.840 --> 51:43.840]  There is no quarter.
[51:43.840 --> 51:46.240]  Look at that face of Rod Rosenstein.
[51:46.240 --> 51:50.320]  You think a criminal like that can ever heal?
[51:50.320 --> 51:52.320]  No.
[51:52.320 --> 51:54.320]  No.
[51:54.320 --> 52:08.160]  Folks, they will go to the ultimate lengths to defend their criminal behavior.
[52:08.160 --> 52:10.480]  Now the good news is not all of them are like that.
[52:10.480 --> 52:11.800]  Not all of them are at the top.
[52:11.800 --> 52:14.720]  Not all of them were engaged in this massive treason.
[52:14.720 --> 52:21.080]  So many of them will sing about what they witnessed, experienced, and know.
[52:21.080 --> 52:24.600]  But the McCabe's of the world, the Comey's of the world, the Rosenstein's of the world,
[52:24.600 --> 52:28.000]  the Clinton's of the world, the Wasserman Schultz of the world, the list goes on and
[52:28.000 --> 52:34.560]  on and on, the Pelosi's, the Schumers, the Nadler's, the Schiff's.
[52:34.560 --> 52:42.480]  They can't give quarter because, ladies and gentlemen, we all know what the punishment
[52:42.480 --> 52:44.600]  for treason is.
[52:44.600 --> 52:52.160]  We all know what the punishment for treason is.
[52:52.160 --> 52:58.200]  Bug-eyed freak like that doesn't have much chance, does he?
[52:58.200 --> 53:04.960]  Up there in LA, Hollywood, oh, by the way, one of the biggest lawyers, guys, see if
[53:04.960 --> 53:09.520]  you can find the story, one of the biggest lawyers from the Nexivum sex cult may have
[53:09.520 --> 53:14.800]  had their home just raided, like Big League.
[53:14.800 --> 53:21.320]  Oh, oh, oh, and it doesn't even matter that in the last two years out in LA, in Little
[53:21.320 --> 53:29.680]  Schiff's district, there have been two massive human trafficking busts, including dozens
[53:29.680 --> 53:40.440]  of minors, infants even, in LA, in Schiff's district, in Hollywood, where are the sex
[53:40.440 --> 53:46.520]  cults are?
[53:46.520 --> 53:48.080]  Now you know why they want an open border.
[53:48.080 --> 53:50.560]  Now you know why the caravans go to California.
[53:50.560 --> 53:53.840]  I mean, folks, it's all right there.
[53:53.840 --> 53:58.120]  Now you know why Trump is targeting these 13 people, many with ties to the Clintons.
[53:58.120 --> 54:03.960]  Now you know why Laura Sillsby was trying to traffic undocumented kids across the border.
[54:03.960 --> 54:07.120]  Now you know why the Clintons have had so much time invested in Haiti.
[54:07.120 --> 54:08.840]  It's all there.
[54:08.840 --> 54:11.880]  It's all there.
[54:11.880 --> 54:23.560]  Now you know why Jeffrey, I've seen cut deals with Robert Mueller.
[54:23.560 --> 54:31.920]  I don't know why Ed Buck gets found with multiple dead hookers, male hookers in his place, allegedly.
[54:31.920 --> 54:33.560]  I don't know what that's about.
[54:33.560 --> 54:34.880]  Does Adam Schiff know what that's about?
[54:34.880 --> 54:41.840]  Does Ted Lu know what that's about?
[54:41.840 --> 54:49.720]  These people are desperate, ladies and gentlemen, and you know, I hope, I pray to God that their
[54:49.720 --> 54:54.720]  greatest act of desperation is staging a hate crime and blaming Trump supporters.
[54:54.720 --> 55:00.000]  I hope that their greatest act of desperation is making up a fake Russian collusion narrative
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.040]  to spy on Trump illegally.
[55:02.040 --> 55:05.280]  I hope that that's the worst of what they'll do.
[55:05.280 --> 55:06.280]  I really do.
[55:06.280 --> 55:09.960]  I hope that the rhetoric and them calling for riots and them calling for violence and
[55:09.960 --> 55:14.040]  them calling for race war and them calling America the worst and them trying to destroy
[55:14.040 --> 55:19.800]  the economy and then trying to destroy culture, I hope that's the worst of what they'll do.
[55:19.800 --> 55:21.320]  Like I hope that's where it ends.
[55:21.320 --> 55:25.960]  I hope they'll stop targeting kids for harassment like they did with Covington.
[55:25.960 --> 55:31.240]  I hope they'll stop trying to drive this country into a race war with hoax hate crimes like
[55:31.240 --> 55:32.600]  the Jesse Small Let story.
[55:32.600 --> 55:34.960]  I hope that's the farthest they'll go.
[55:34.960 --> 55:36.840]  I really do.
[55:36.840 --> 55:47.080]  But it's not, I mean, do you realize that the Vatican right now is like, I mean, folks,
[55:47.080 --> 55:54.040]  gay sex orgies, nuns being sexually harassed, cages, I mean, like, the Vatican is being
[55:54.040 --> 55:59.640]  totally exposed like as a giant sex cult and no one's even talking about it.
[55:59.640 --> 56:16.880]  It's just like, yeah, abusing nuns, marking children for sex, sure, cages for gay orgies.
[56:16.880 --> 56:22.320]  But I'm sure it's just a coincidence that President Trump has made it an issue of his
[56:22.320 --> 56:29.400]  to stop human trafficking and it's all being exposed, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:29.400 --> 56:34.840]  And here on this president's day, Americans can't even show a little appreciation for
[56:34.840 --> 56:36.760]  everything this man has done.
[56:36.760 --> 56:38.120]  I'm not saying he's perfect.
[56:38.120 --> 56:42.320]  I don't know what the final result of the Trump presidency is going to be, but my God,
[56:42.320 --> 56:49.440]  I mean, the guy has done more than any other president I've ever seen in my life with the
[56:49.440 --> 56:55.840]  most resistance with everything against him.
[56:55.840 --> 57:03.480]  But info wars from the very beginning, because we were on that same path, we were on that
[57:03.480 --> 57:10.120]  same ethos, we were on that same frequency, and you know, it's funny because I remember,
[57:10.120 --> 57:17.200]  I remember on, I remember in the summer of 2015, I remember during the holidays and Thanksgiving
[57:17.200 --> 57:23.320]  and Christmas, I was the only Trump supporter, I was laughed out of the room, I was laughed
[57:23.320 --> 57:28.880]  out of Thanksgiving dinner, I was laughed out of the Christmas celebration, Trump could
[57:28.880 --> 57:35.560]  never win, I think Trump could win.
[57:35.560 --> 57:37.400]  Who's laughing now?
[57:37.400 --> 57:43.960]  Oh, but you won't be laughing, ladies and gentlemen, when the Democrats really go to
[57:43.960 --> 57:58.640]  that final line to try to remove this president, it won't be funny then.
[57:58.640 --> 58:05.080]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[58:05.080 --> 58:10.800]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[58:10.800 --> 58:15.280]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in
[58:15.280 --> 58:17.720]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[58:17.720 --> 58:24.280]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[58:24.280 --> 58:27.160]  and beyond system in the world.

[58:36.520 --> 58:41.040]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half pack at the
[58:41.040 --> 58:44.480]  first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you
[58:44.480 --> 58:50.280]  into overdrive, TurboForce and m4slive.com.
[58:50.280 --> 58:54.520]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[58:54.520 --> 58:58.600]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[58:58.600 --> 59:01.600]  every faucet, shower and sink in your home.

[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:19.440]  Waging war on corruption, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show and now your host
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:35.360]  Owen Troyer.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:41.880]  How do you accurately provide commentary?
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.600]  It's not even a national media thing.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:54.200]  It's like a total cultural phenomenon where Trump supporters are being assaulted, harassed,
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:01:01.960]  sexually abused, I mean like you wear a Trump hat out, you know, choose your own adventure
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.960]  out there.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.080]  Now again, most people are going to see you and say, hey, nice hat, hey, I like what the
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.080]  president's doing.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.720]  I'd say about 80 to 90%.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.920]  From my experience, I wear a Trump hat out pretty often, I get about 90%, 80% positive
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:19.960]  and then about 10% negative, about 5% like super insane left, but they're out there.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:20.960]  And they've been caught on camera.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:28.440]  I don't know how many times, thousands, tens of thousands, 100,000, a million.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:33.640]  And so, but while there's all that going on, they're being spat on, they're having objects
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:37.600]  thrown at them, they're being harassed and yelled at out of restaurants, they come up
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.680]  to you, they grab your genitals, they come up to you, they cold clock you, they punch
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:47.000]  you, they'll prick you with a needle, I mean, they'll throw a stink bomb at you with their
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.160]  own feces and urine.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:54.920]  I mean, this is all leftist activity, but you know, it barely even puts a blip on the
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.720]  radar of the national press.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.440]  But then what happens?
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:07.680]  See small that from Hollywood, I'm a gay Hollywood actor and a black man listening to me.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.880]  Oh, you're a total fraud and a liar.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:15.080]  But that gets all the coverage, all the harassment against Trump supporters never makes the news.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:20.480]  So I should come on here and play the thousands of videos of all the harassment Trump supporters
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.480]  have endured.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:26.160]  But let's just show the latest one, a 14-year-old boy at a store, it looks like in the mall,
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.280]  where one of the employees just decides he's gonna tell him to f off because he's wearing
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:44.680]  a Trump hat.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:49.080]  So the audio here is bad, but it looks like it's a shoe store or something in the mall.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.080]  I was told.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.080]  I was told.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.080]  Touch my thigh.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.080]  I'm not touching it.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.080]  Let's go.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:03:02.360]  So the employee tells the kid in the Trump hat to f off.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:18.200]  The mother there with him, kids 14, says I want to talk to the manager, take off your
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.200]  hat.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.200]  This is America.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:26.720]  But your head offends me because I'm a brainwashed minion of the media.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.720]  Absolutely nothing.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.520]  I'm sorry guys, I'm just going about your business.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.520]  Absolutely not.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.520]  I want corporate office.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.520]  Sure.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.520]  I want everything right now.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.520]  Yeah.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.520]  Yes.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.200]  We need to get, you know what, we need to make, we need to get, we should try to get this
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.200]  woman on.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.760]  Because this is, I'm sorry folks, this is what we have to do.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.520]  This is not what conservatives do, I get it.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.640]  Like we rise above this crap.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.400]  We are the ones when they say, oh, they go low.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.400]  We go high.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.400]  No, no, no.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.800]  We are the ones that actually go high when they go low.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.320]  So that's why we never follow through with any of this crap.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.320]  We don't get litigious.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.760]  We don't file police reports.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.240]  We don't call up corporate when they treat us like garbage.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.840]  It's time to take action.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.200]  She needs to call corporate, get all these people fired.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.160]  Just clean out that whole damn store.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.360]  You harassed a 14 year old boy.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.080]  You are a sick freak.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.720]  You shouldn't have a job anywhere.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:21.360]  Here, let's go now to clip 10, a man has been accused of pulling a gun on a couple
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.360]  for ringing a trumpet.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:28.920]  A Tennessee man named James Phillips is now in jail on a wanton endangerment charge after
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.000]  the alleged altercation.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  According to the police report, officers were called the Sam's Club due to a report
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.400]  of a person with a gun.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.160]  They said it happened yesterday.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:43.400]  The report says they found Phillips in the parking lot with a Glock 40 caliber and a round
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:48.520]  chambered in his back pocket and two additional magazines in another pocket.
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.760]  The report says he admitted to flipping off a couple inside the store because they were
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:55.360]  wearing Make America Great Again hats.
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.080]  Oh, but just a small hat though.

[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:28.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.480]  Going to cool down the jets here.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.000]  I think I was overheating in the first hour.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.880]  The engine was overheating a little bit, so we're going to slow it down.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.440]  We're going to get Stuart Rhodes in studio shortly.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:43.440]  Alex Jones is going to be calling in and hosting the third hour.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.800]  Roger Stone will be joining him.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:51.600]  And then in the final hour today, Stuart Rhodes will come back in studio or just be in studio
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:07:00.320]  and we will take your calls regarding everything we discussed today, your questions for Stuart.
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:05.360]  But you know, I already covered this, but I just want to do it again in case people didn't
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.720]  hear the first time.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:13.840]  This is the latest study, researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:17.200]  The story is on studyfines.org.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.040]  Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder say the average house is prone to indoor
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:27.640]  air qualities levels on par with a polluted major city.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:32.200]  So you can go look at that study for yourself.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:37.200]  You can go look at other studies that are similar, but the story goes, the average home
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:43.400]  in America is the air in the home is basically totally filled with toxins, pollutants.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:49.600]  In fact, you can find a story, I believe was in 2017.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:54.760]  They did an air quality test in California and they found in some areas that the levels
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:08:00.840]  of carcinogens in the air and water could cause cancer.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.640]  Now that's California where the Democrats have literally, you know, crapped everywhere.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:10.080]  So you know, it's probably not that bad everywhere, but this is why we sell air filters and water
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.640]  filters.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:16.640]  So we see the studies out of California that say, wow, look at how polluted this water is.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.240]  It's barely drinkable.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:19.240]  Wow.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:23.760]  Look at the fact that the average home in the United States has air pollutant levels
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.120]  equivalent to that of a major city.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.960]  Well, you don't want that.
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.640]  I don't want that.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:30.640]  Nobody wants that.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.920]  Nobody wants to have that for their family, their friends that come over to visit.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:40.480]  So we go out and we look for solutions to these issues and we find the best air filters,
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.280]  the best water filters.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:50.440]  And right now at infowarstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze air filter is $50 off, $50 off
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:53.200]  the Alexa Pure Breeze air filter right now at infowarstore.com.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:09:01.440]  So don't just look at the study that says the average U.S. home, the air in the average
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:07.800]  U.S. home is so polluted, it's on par with a major U.S. city and do nothing.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.580]  Get an air filter.
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:12.320]  You don't want to have that dirty air in your home.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:17.400]  I mean, folks, I don't know the studies, but I would imagine living your life, breathing
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:22.440]  in polluted air, probably not good.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.840]  To clean up that air, who knows?
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:31.080]  So that's why we sell air filters at infowarstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze air filter, $50 off
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.200]  right now.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:37.240]  And also check out the water filters when you're there as well, the best water filters out
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.240]  there.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.200]  But look, don't just take my word for it.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.520]  Go out there, do the research for yourself.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.040]  Go out there and shop around.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.040]  Look for other air filters.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:51.680]  You're not going to find anything better, anything more advanced at a better price, period.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:54.840]  That's what Alex Jones has done at infowarstore.com.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.880]  So do the research for yourself, but just came out, brand new study.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.720]  There have been similar studies.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:07.720]  The air quality in your home is most likely on par with that of a major city when it comes
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.600]  to being polluted.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:17.720]  Now, we'll probably talk to Stuart Rhodes about this, but the president is on Twitter
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:25.360]  today, basically calling out the whole deep state, specifically Andy McCabe, Rod Rosenstein.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:32.280]  I mean, and here's the frustration, and I'm kind of like, I'm almost such a creature of
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:39.840]  habit of just being in the moment on air sometimes that I forget my own research at like a deeper
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.520]  level.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.720]  And I talked about this the other day.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.840]  The president is so smart.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.920]  In fact, it was before he was in president.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:55.120]  Donald Trump is so smart, he's learned something that I don't think or mastered something I
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.360]  don't think anyone else has even figured out yet.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:05.800]  He knows that he can tweet something out, or let's just say say something.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.600]  But in this, in this instance, it's easier to just use the Twitter to make this example.
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:16.920]  He can tweet something out, and then years later, he can make it come true.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:24.360]  So for example, I like most of the audience, I think is frustrated that the president tweets
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:29.640]  about all of this crap, and yet nothing gets done.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:37.680]  But see, and again, if or when it's done in a year or two years, he's going to look like
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.280]  the smartest man ever.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.000]  And you're going to say, wow, he predicted all of this on Twitter.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.080]  Wow, he said if it's going to happen on Twitter, oh my gosh, he's been doing that for years.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:54.240]  And I realized the other day that he's just like mastered this ability where he can say
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:59.440]  something and put something out on Twitter knowing that he can actually make it happen.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.920]  And then he just makes himself look like a genius.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:07.480]  It's kind of like next level digital self-fulfilling prophecy or something.
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:14.480]  And so we read this about how he's saying Andrew McCabe, the FBI, Rod Rosenstein's are
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.400]  basically, he's saying they're guilty of high treason.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.840]  I mean, you really want to boil it down in more or less words.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:25.040]  That's this nuanced series of tweets from President Trump.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:30.640]  These are top criminals guilty of treason, and he names their names.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:35.000]  And how do you think that makes McCabe and Rosenstein feel?
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.880]  And in fact, I mean, we have the clip, and it's almost like I should play it.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:46.480]  Andrew McCabe, admitting that they were going to remove the president, in fact, let's play
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.480]  this.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.480]  I got the time right now, guys.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.600]  Let's play clip 12 because I just have to see this one more time before I come out and
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.600]  say what I'm going to say.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.440]  Guys, roll clip 12.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:58.680]  But McCabe says Rosenstein raised another idea.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:04.560]  The 25th Amendment to the Constitution allows the vice president and the majority of the
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.160]  cabinet to remove the president.
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:13.160]  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:21.360]  me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360]  an effort.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.120]  Now pause right here.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.620]  Why?
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:30.040]  Why?
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:33.240]  Why are they bringing up the 25th Amendment?
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.280]  And then why didn't it work?
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.280]  All right, go on.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.280]  Now, hold on.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.280]  Pause.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.280]  Pause.
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.280]  Of course, of course.
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:46.000]  The funny thing is, here he is on CNN, they're never going to ask any real questions, or
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.800]  excuse me, not CNN, 60 minutes.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.240]  Here he is on 60 minutes, CBS.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:56.800]  A good journalist would be like, whoa, why did you think about invoking the 25th Amendment?
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:57.960]  And why didn't that go through?
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.320]  Of course, we know the answer.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.720]  The answer is A, because they want to remove the president, and then the second answer
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.400]  is B, because Pence wasn't going to go along with it.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.400]  All right, go on.
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.400]  Conversation.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:11.360]  So I listened to what he had to say.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.600]  But because that's my job at the FBI to remove the president, don't you know?
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:19.660]  I can't even describe for you how many things must have been coursing through the deputy
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:21.480]  attorney general's mind at that point.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:29.720]  So it was really something that he kind of threw out in a very frenzied, chaotic conversation
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:32.520]  about where we were and what we needed to do next.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.560]  Why is it so frenzied?
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.560]  Why is it chaotic?
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.320]  Why do you need to do something?
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:46.400]  Well, I can't confirm that, but what I can say in the deputy attorney general was definitely
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:52.880]  very concerned about the president, about his capacity, and about his intent at that
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.680]  point in time.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.720]  How did he bring up the idea of the 25th Amendment to you?
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.880]  Honestly, I don't remember.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:03.080]  He just said he just explained it.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.280]  He just brought it up in a chaotic conversation one day.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.120]  Of a wide-ranging conversation.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.120]  Seriously?
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.120]  Yeah.
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:11.120]  Just another topic?
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.120]  Yeah.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.120]  Mm-hmm.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.120]  Did you counsel him on that?
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:15.120]  All right.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:16.120]  I didn't.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.120]  Pull it out.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:23.440]  Listen, though, here's the next level to this, folks, that most people probably won't ask
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.800]  and most media people aren't going to ask.
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:30.760]  Why is McCabe going on 60 minutes saying this?
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.760]  Why?
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.400]  There's something to that.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:38.560]  There is something to McCabe going on 60 minutes admitting this.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:45.000]  It's either Trump, Trump gripped him to do it, the Democrats gripped him to do it, or
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.840]  it's like an act of providence, and he's just out here telling the whole story, God has
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:57.280]  just taken over and he's just admitting that they tried to engage in treason illegally.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:03.920]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:07.920]  Do you know the official National American flag has never been manufactured for retail
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:08.920]  stores?
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:13.720]  The one that Americans fought and died for, the one symbol that represents our Constitution.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:17.040]  Now you can be a part of this great movement that's never been seen before.
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.360]  Together, we'll recapture America.

[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:16.160]  and energy supplements.

[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.080]  that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.080]  effects.

[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:02.280]  You know the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.440]  be there for my children someday.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.400]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.160]  Now I can be there for my children.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.000]  Now I can make them strong.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.640]  Now I can instruct them.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.440]  Now I can teach them what I've learned but not once I'm gone.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.680]  You think of this digital age, your word's gone forever but now they're even better getting
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.600]  rid of what you said they were before.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:23.320]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:24.320]  burning, isn't it?
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.680]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.800]  I can't be destroyed now.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:33.240]  As long as I realize I've done right and the longer the people know the truth and you can't
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.240]  be destroyed either.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:39.520]  As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:43.520]  it, there is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:48.040]  When you commit the word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos,
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:51.080]  that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:55.640]  So please now commit to support Info Wars however you can and realize your provision
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:23.320]  to Info Wars is your own provision.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:26.400]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.480]  I think there are two things that are fair to say right now.
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:36.800]  I don't think anybody in the near future is going to be naming their child, Jussie.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:42.760]  And I think if President Trump tweeted Learn to Code, Twitter might just shut down and
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:46.360]  the universe might just explode.
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:50.520]  We are waiting to hear from Stuart Rhodes who's going to be joining me in studio so I'm
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:54.920]  going to do a news blitz here.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:59.440]  Let's start with this story linked up at InfoWars.com from the Washington Times.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:04.120]  Pentagon Chief says he'll make final call on wall money.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:08.200]  Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said this week that he will make the final
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:12.760]  call on $3.6 billion in military construction money that President Trump wants to build
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:18.440]  his border wall and quickly shot down the notion of rating any funds meant to build
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.400]  or repair housing for troops and their families.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:30.480]  Look, I hope that he lets the President build the wall, but did you elect Patrick Shanahan?
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.080]  In fact, I'll go one step further.
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:35.480]  Have you ever heard of Patrick Shanahan?
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:39.240]  And this is the guy who's going to decide if the wall gets built or not?
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:43.880]  No, the Pentagon needs to get out of the way.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:49.040]  We played the report at the top of today's broadcast and I reiterate, I think everybody
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:53.960]  should go to InfoWars.com and this story from Gregory's National Emergency Trump's Executive
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:57.280]  Orders to Destroy Deep State Criminal Cabal.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:02.440]  Download this video and re-upload it to your YouTube channel because if this video got
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:11.200]  seen 100 million times, it would be devastating, just absolutely devastating to the Democrats.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:14.920]  And it's almost as if though, see, I don't even know if I can say that because it's
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:21.960]  really just devastating to who the Clintons really are and the average leftist can't even
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.560]  make the connection anymore.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:28.920]  If you brought up Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, you're like, well, that's not the
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:29.920]  Democrats.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:33.040]  Hillary Clinton just ran the Democrat Party.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:40.680]  I mean, the Democrats haven't disavowed Hillary Clinton, so I think everybody should share
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:47.760]  that video showing how Trump is trying to stop human trafficking or modern day slavery.
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:50.360]  And the Democrats hate it.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:58.280]  Chuck Todd on NBC News Meet the Press said, what if Trump's national emergency is found
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.280]  constitutional?
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.280]  Oh my gosh.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.280]  Oh my gosh.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.280]  What if he has a border?
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.280]  What if he builds the wall?
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.280]  What if we have a country?
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.280]  What if we have sovereignty?
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.280]  What if we have rights?
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.280]  What if we have freedom?
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:12.280]  What if we have sovereignty?
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:13.280]  What if we have rights?
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.280]  What if we have freedom?
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:15.280]  That's Chuck Todd.
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.280]  What if America is allowed to exist?
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:20.280]  What if America is allowed to stop an invasion from the southern border?
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.280]  Oh, it's total madness.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.280]  It's total madness.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:27.280]  What if it's constitutional to protect your country?
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:30.280]  Chuck Todd meets President NBC.
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.280]  The president's trying to have a country.
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:34.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:37.660]  Check that out.
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:45.080]  As President Trump predicted in his national emergency address, a lawsuit has been filed
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:50.480]  against the National Emergency Declaration alleges Trump violated the U.S. Constitution.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:56.200]  Just as he said, it'll go to the Ninth Circuit, it'll get appealed, it'll go to the Pellet
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:59.640]  Courts, it'll get appealed, it'll be fought, it'll make it to Supreme Court probably in
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:03.280]  about eight months and then it'll be declared constitutional.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.040]  So let's go ahead and make a prediction here.
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.280]  Infowars next month's news today.
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:11.120]  What's eight months from February?
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.280]  What's nine months from February?
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.280]  What are we looking at?
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.280]  Like November?
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:23.800]  I think we'll be looking at about a November, October, November, probably when the National
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:29.280]  Emergency actually gets to have rubber meet the road because the Democrat obstructionist.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.280]  Because again, I mean, they don't want to have a border.
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:36.280]  I mean, you saw Chuck Todd on NBC News, oh my God, the president wants to have a border.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.280]  What do we do?
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:42.960]  How are we going to stop this?
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.880]  Trump seeks to turn his failure to build the wall into a campaign rallying cry.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.280]  It's from the Washington Post.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:52.720]  Well, his failure to build a wall, that's an interesting way of putting it, the Washington
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.720]  Post, I guess that's the headline we could expect.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.920]  They have built a lot of the wall.
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:01.720]  It's really about border security, if anything, he's failed to secure the border.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.280]  I would say that's true.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.480]  They have built some of the wall.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:07.080]  They failed to secure the border.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:10.040]  But yeah, finish the wall.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:13.640]  The campaign, immigration was one of his biggest issues.
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:19.520]  Tell you, we're two, three months away from the 2020 campaign really, really heating up
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:25.920]  and it is going to be wacko, jacko.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:31.920]  Sharpton, the Reverend, calls for small that to face accountability to the maximum.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:38.200]  Oh, Mr. Sharpton, how quickly you have changed your mind.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:42.520]  Before you saw any of the facts, you were immediately calling America racist and Trump
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.720]  racist and everything.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.880]  Oops, I guess now you want to see justice.
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:48.960]  How about justice for you, Sharpton?
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:49.960]  Have you ever paid those taxes?
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:52.920]  What does Sharpton owe in taxes, like 30 million or something?
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.680]  It's got to be tough.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:01.040]  It's got to be tough to be Al Sharpton.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.840]  Maybe it's three million and I'm just adding it.
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:05.960]  I think it's actually, no, I think it's like three and a half million that Sharpton owes
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.320]  in back taxes.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:13.600]  Oh, but again, Bezos pays zero in taxes.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.920]  Sharpton doesn't pay his taxes.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.560]  Trump actually pays all of his taxes.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:22.920]  Like you get the tax documents and Rachel Maddow's like, I've got the documents and then they
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:26.880]  show the documents, he's paying millions, hundreds of millions in taxes.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.880]  It's like, oh, we got him.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.360]  It's like, wait a second, Trump pays his taxes and you hate him.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.680]  Bezos, Amazon doesn't pay taxes, Sharpton doesn't pay taxes.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:37.680]  You don't say anything.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:40.520]  Hillary Clinton launders $80 million during the campaign.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:45.440]  David Brock super PACs, this is one of the greatest Monday laundering schemes of all time.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:53.400]  David Brock has like eight super PACs all in the same building and they funnel money
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:58.760]  between each super PAC and they take a 10% cut each time.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:09.160]  I mean, it's just like, oh, I'm sorry, it's just Gallows humor at this point.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:15.040]  David Brock, God, Jesse's small at case to go to grand jury.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.040]  That's from TMZ.
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:17.920]  Of course, that's kind of where the whole thing started.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:23.160]  If you're CNN, they blamed TMZ for the whole thing.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.400]  Here's a doozy from CNN.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:30.320]  Look at this headline, Japan's Abe refuses to deny that he nominated Trump for a Nobel
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.320]  Prize.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.320]  What?
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:35.320]  He refuses to deny.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:36.960]  Okay.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.760]  How about the headline is Japan's Abe nominates Trump for Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.240]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.560]  They can't put that out there.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:45.680]  That makes Trump look good.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:50.920]  They got to somehow morph and twist and spin.
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:53.720]  How can we, we have to, we have to report on this.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:57.360]  We have to report on what Trump said about being no nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.480]  We have to report on it, but we can't make him look good.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.480]  What can we do?
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:05.480]  Let's put some negatives in there like refuses and denies.
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.480]  Yes.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.760]  That'll be, that'll work on our little minions.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.080]  And so the headline finally comes out.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:20.040]  Because Abe refuses to deny, refuses to deny that he nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.040]  Prize.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.040]  So what?
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:27.720]  CNN calls up Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and says, will you deny?
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.920]  Will you deny that you nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize?
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:33.000]  He's like, no, I did nominate Trump.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.120]  Yes, I nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:37.720]  But will you deny it?
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:39.320]  Will you deny it?
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.320]  No.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.320]  He won't deny it.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:44.320]  He won't deny it.
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.320]  Get to the presses immediately.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.320]  Get to the press.
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.320]  Abe refuses to deny that he nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:29:19.320]  So this is like a negative even though it's a positive.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:48.320]  This is like a negative even though it's a negative even though it's a positive.
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:30:17.320]  This is like a negative even though it's a positive even though it's a positive.
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:46.320]  This is like a negative even though it's a positive even though it's a positive.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:31:15.320]  This is like a negative even though it's a positive even though it's a positive.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:44.320]  This is like a negative even though it's a positive even though it's a positive.
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:32:13.320]  This is like a negative even though it's a positive even though it's a positive.
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:42.320]  This is like a negative even though it's a positive even though it's a positive.
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:33:09.320]  This is like a negative even though it's a positive even though it's a positive.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:21.320]  This is like a negative even though it's a positive even though it's a positive.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:27.320]  This is like a negative even though it's a positive even though it's a positive even though it's a positive.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:31.860]  The Democratic president can decide that, as you mentioned, the 40,000 people a year
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:36.320]  killed in this country is a crisis, and why don't we take everybody's guns away, or force
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.480]  everybody to register their guns, or ban all assault rifles, or do all of that?
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:45.320]  I know the Republicans have some ease about it, no matter what they say, because if the
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:52.520]  president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency, an illusion
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:58.120]  that he wants to convey, just think of what a president with different values can present
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.120]  to the American people.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.520]  You want to talk about a national emergency?
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:08.040]  Let's talk about today, the one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.240]  gun violence in America.
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:11.740]  That's a national emergency.
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:15.720]  Why don't you declare that emergency, Mr. President?
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:23.600]  And just look at how deceptive the Democrats are, as I'm joined in studio by Stuart Rhodes,
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:30.560]  that Nadler goes on CNN and says, 40,000 a year die from gun crime.
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:35.400]  I mean, I don't have the numbers in front of me, conservatively I would say half of
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:42.040]  that is probably suicide, and that's not good, but they don't tell you the full story.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:49.520]  And then probably another 20, 30% is drug related crimes, but they don't tell you that
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:50.520]  either.
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:54.800]  Oh, and then I would bet that 80% of these crimes, if not, again, conservative, more
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:35:00.160]  of them happen in gun-free zones like Chicago.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:05.720]  Speaking of Chicago, that's where the false hate crime happened, where Jesse Smallette
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:06.720]  staged it.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:11.320]  Now, Stuart Rhodes from oathkeepers.org, we have a lot to get to here, but you were
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:14.640]  tuned in earlier, and there was something that really caught your attention that I talked
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:15.640]  about earlier.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:20.640]  Yeah, you were talking about how Jesse was essentially inciting a race war in this country,
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:21.640]  and I think you're right.
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:25.640]  And he came very close to kicking it off, and it would have led to the deaths of tens
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:28.680]  of thousands or potentially millions of Americans.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:35.800]  And this is really kind of like the undercurrent on the left is a relentless incitement of
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:37.400]  racial conflict in this country.
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:42.320]  I mean, Obama was not the most inclusive president or bringing us together as most
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.000]  divisive president we've had, and that's been their pattern ever since.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.400]  Well, and it's amazing because they are the ones that cry about racism, and they would
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:55.360]  go, let's bring everybody together like right.
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:58.440]  But at the end of the day, they're always the ones dividing.
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:35:59.560]  They're always the ones dividing.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:05.880]  And when is the mainstream media, when is the Hollywood left going to come out and say,
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:08.640]  well, we have been the ones dividing?
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:12.520]  How can this Jesse Smollett story not prove that in total triplicate?
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:19.080]  Well, that's the thing is they're all about identity politics, and racial identity is
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.640]  the key element of that, not the only one, of course.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.440]  He's the perfect poster child for what they want to do.
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:27.160]  He's a gay black man.
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:30.480]  He wants to divide us along sexual gender and identity.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.440]  Do you want them to divide us along racial identity?
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:39.360]  It's all their mechanism for attacking this country, and of course, the big undercurrent
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:45.680]  for them is that this country is inherently racist, inherently oppressive, inherently
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:46.680]  cisgendered.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:47.680]  I mean, you name it.
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:49.200]  It's all about demonizing the West.
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:53.240]  He said earlier, what he really is, is he's a communist or a communist stooge, and they're
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:56.680]  just a communist movement to destroy this country, which is called what they are.
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:00.880]  And here's another thing that's odd about this to me.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:04.800]  Here he is, he wants to go along with this whole victim mindset, right, like, oh, he's
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:08.800]  the victim, create a victim mindset, create a situation where you're the victim because
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.960]  he's black, he's gay, which by the way, I'm now calling into question sexuality.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.800]  I'm saying he's, I'm saying he could be faking being gay.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:20.960]  Look, Elizabeth Warren fakes being an Indian to get a degree, you know, Alexander or Cortez
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:26.200]  fakes being from, you know, some poor girl from the Bronx, Beto O'Rourke fakes being
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:27.200]  Hispanic.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:28.200]  They're all fakes.
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.200]  So who knows?
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.200]  Maybe he's faking being gay.
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:34.560]  He's surprised, but he, he, he, he tries to latch on to this whole victim thing, right,
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.040]  Stuart, and creates this whole situation.
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:42.040]  He's probably a multi-million dollars, he contracts, he gets on Fox.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.040]  He's famous.
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.040]  He won after of the year.
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.080]  I mean, he's done everything.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.520]  He lives the American dream, but it's this weird thing they want to be the victim.
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:53.600]  He's hardly oppressed, but he wants you to believe, they want you to believe that this
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.400]  country, like I said, is inherently oppressive.
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:00.360]  And the foot soldiers in, in the streets, so the ones they're really trying to incite,
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:06.160]  it's the Antifa, it's the new Black Panther Party, it's people like that who, you know,
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:10.800]  who believe the nonsense and the lie that this is an oppressive, racist society.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:16.920]  But as you point out, if it's so oppressive, so racist, how did he get to be where he is?
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:18.880]  And they will never realize that.
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.800]  They'll never go down that thought path.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:21.800]  They'll never acknowledge it.
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:22.800]  Yeah.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:23.800]  Yeah.
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:25.920]  I mean, I think the ones at the top, the ones pulling the strings realize it, of course.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.520]  I think a lot of the folks in the streets who they're trying to incite, fall for it.
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:35.360]  Hopefully this will help even more of them walk away, you know, hashtag walk away.
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.240]  Hopefully even more of them walk away from the manipulation, from the matrix.
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.240]  All right.
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:42.920]  So the real question here, those two, it is, guys, let me get a doc cam.
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.760]  We got to give out the Oscar.
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:49.000]  Does the Oscar go to Nathan Phillips, the stolen Valor?
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.440]  Never served in Vietnam, American Indian who was banging a drum in the face of teenagers
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:54.760]  and then acted like the victim.
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.440]  Does the Oscar go to him?
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:58.840]  Does the Oscar go to Christine Blasey Ford?
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:04.080]  He talks like this and cries and weeps a little bit because she thinks that maybe Kavanaugh
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:08.080]  was in a room with her and it was dark and she doesn't remember where or when, but it
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:11.560]  was probably him and he shouldn't be a judge because of it.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.880]  Or does the Oscar go to Jesse Smollett, who pulled off one of the greatest hate crime
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.760]  hoaxes of all time, but of course got caught, but he did cry on his television media tour.
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:22.920]  He talked about how bad it was.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:23.920]  That was pretty good.
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:24.920]  What about Stuart?
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:25.920]  What about Warren though?
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:26.920]  I mean, Elizabeth Warren?
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:27.920]  Elizabeth Warren?
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.200]  A lifetime of masquerading as an Indian.
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.200]  It's pretty good.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:34.120]  Yeah, but this is for like actual good acting performances.
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:35.120]  Okay.
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.320]  Warren's is not good at all.
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:39.320]  You want to have a beer?
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:43.800]  I'm going to have me a beer.
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:45.280]  I don't know what that's poor performance.
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:47.560]  So the Oscar goes to you from Stuart Rhodes.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.000]  The Oscar goes to...
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.600]  Well, if it's for incitement, it should be different categories.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:52.600]  Just the best performance.
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.600]  He's talking about just the best overall acting performance.
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:57.880]  Oh, I'd have to give it to Jesse Smollett.
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:02.120]  I mean, the crocodile tears delivered the television media tour.
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:03.120]  Right.
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:04.120]  And the preparation at events.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.120]  The preparation.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:06.120]  Yeah.
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.120]  You got to give it up for him.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:08.120]  I mean, he prepared the whole thing.
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:09.320]  He even invested his own money.
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:13.160]  Well, he talked about, he thought, hey, out there are people that are fake, don't fall
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:14.160]  for it.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:18.200]  So you leave the ground from self being a virtue signal.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:19.680]  So we do a golf clap.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.560]  Jesse, would you like...
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:27.920]  Jesse, would you like to come up and receive your award?
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:30.840]  Look at how emotionally is for receiving this award right now.
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.200]  Look at how emotional Jesse is.
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:37.360]  He just received the news that he got the Oscar for the hate crime hoax he pulled off.
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.520]  He's so emotional right now.
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:39.920]  He's tearing up about it.
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:40.920]  Unbelievable.
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:41.920]  What a performance.
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:42.920]  All right.
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:47.280]  In more serious news, and we'll get into this on the other side.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.880]  You know, I don't think it's a debate.
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:50.880]  We've talked about this.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.480]  It's a national emergency at the Southern border.
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:53.720]  This shouldn't be a debate.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:58.760]  They declared a state of emergency in Washington for 36 cases of the measles.
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:02.080]  Well, 36 cases of the measles could have just walked across the border.
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:03.920]  How is that not a national emergency?
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:05.000]  It is.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.680]  But it looks like where we're at right now, Stuart, is the wall funding is going through
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:12.040]  the bureaucracy.
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.080]  It's going through the court system, and it doesn't look like this national emergency
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:19.680]  is really going to hit the ground for about eight months, I think, is my prediction.
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:26.360]  Well, I think the president, as I said before, made a mistake and he's gotten bad advice.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:31.120]  He should have simply ordered the military to the border to defend the nation under his
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:35.480]  authorities commander in chief period and not referred back to some goofy statute that
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:39.600]  Congress passed about national emergencies.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:44.920]  Way before anyone even talked about declarations of national emergencies, U.S. troops deployed
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:49.680]  to the border like by Wilson back in 1916, just on order as commander in chief.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.880]  And that's what he still should do.
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:55.360]  He's letting them put him in a narrow box and I think it's getting bad advice legally,
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:42:02.160]  putting him in a narrow box of just talking about civilian projects using emergency funding.
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:05.080]  And even in his own presentation about it, he made a mistake.
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.880]  He said that we won't need the military to build the wall.
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:13.360]  Well, according to the provision there, they're justifying this under it's for military use.
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:17.480]  He has to be able to build, you know, use military appropriations for military use.
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:20.880]  So he's making a lot of mistakes legally and I don't think he realizes what's really happening
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.000]  and it could be he's being given, you know, deep state advice.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:31.680]  This is kind of a crazy thing for me to say here, but it's almost as if the president
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:37.160]  has to declare California an enemy of the Republic because there, I mean, again, you
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.760]  can follow these caravans.
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:40.120]  They don't go through Texas.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:44.440]  They travel thousands of extra miles to get to California, folks, and we know why.
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.480]  It's where the human trafficking happens.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:48.360]  It's where the sanctuary cities are.
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:53.760]  So the president almost needs to say, look, California, maybe we need to investigate you
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.080]  and why you want these open borders.
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:43:06.520]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:12.960]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:18.680]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:23.160]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:25.600]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:32.160]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:35.040]  and beyond system in the world.
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.560]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.560]  You must experience it.
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:42.520]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.680]  or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.960]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:47.480]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:51.560]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.120]  because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:57.640]  Turbo Force and enforce live.com.
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:03.480]  Wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:08.640]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest and who's ready to do the
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:09.640]  damage.
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:10.640]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:11.640]  We stopped her.
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:13.920]  We got a national stand.
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:15.840]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:21.280]  We are winning, but those of us who are at the very front line at the tip of the spear
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:23.120]  are under unprecedented attack.
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:28.240]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:33.040]  This is about who wants it most and you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.160]  they've taken, everything.
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.160]  I am in your hands.
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:36.160]  You are in my hands.
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.680]  I need financial support and I got products you and your family need.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:40.680]  It's that simple.
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:44.760]  Thousands of great products, whatever is award winning, whatever is best selling, what folks
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:48.320]  love, what I love, we bring it to you at M4WarsHore.com.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:52.880]  So please go to m4warshore.com today, look at all the great products because we're in
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:56.480]  your hands, I'm in your hands and your support is beyond critical.
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:57.480]  Thank you.
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:04.000]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:11.840]  there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:19.280]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:24.160]  like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:26.080]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:31.920]  They don't want us to remember what political action did and that's why the globalist Hillary
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:34.540]  and others are trying to shut M4Wars down.
[01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:39.600]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.040]  sovereignty away.
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:43.320]  This country is in a war.
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:47.160]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:50.480]  spread the articles and videos and if you don't financially get the great products we have
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:53.840]  and fund us in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water.
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:57.880]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, infowarstore.com, thank you.
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:04.200]  At M4Wars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:05.760]  that we can then private label and sell.
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:10.760]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:16.800]  the strongest out there and we private label it and we sell it for $10 less online than
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:19.400]  they sell it at CBS and Walgreens.
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:24.320]  We also have another product also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.520]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:34.080]  We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:37.600]  now at M4WarsLife.com and M4WarsTore.com.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:40.400]  This is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.

[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:50.520]  Again, this is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:57.880]  It's super blue, silver Immune Gargle and super silver wound dressing for 40% off at M4WarsTore.com.
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:05.760]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:23.120]  You know, I'm sitting here talking to Stuart Rhodes from Oathkeepers.org during the break.
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:29.520]  I mean, it's almost like we kind of get into these elementary debates, Stuart, about, oh,
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:34.120]  you know, let's build the wall, let's do this, and we kind of miss the bigger picture.
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.120]  Of course we need the wall.
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:41.000]  Of course we want border security, but it's like, wait a second, we're talking about an
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:46.200]  entire political party, which occupies now, I guess, or works together with the media
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:48.280]  and Hollywood and everything.
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:52.240]  I mean, they don't want a border.
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.520]  They don't want this wall.
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:58.520]  They don't support the president because they're in a total insurrection against the president.
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:02.080]  So they have to go against him.
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:04.680]  They have to obstruct everything he does.
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:09.080]  I mean, isn't the wall just another example of how anything and everything the president
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:11.520]  does, they have to obstruct and they have to demonize?
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.720]  Well, yes, but it's also beyond that, it's an insurrection against the Constitution.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:22.760]  Their goal is to completely subvert and transform this country into a socialist or communist
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:24.320]  country.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:29.120]  And their greatest mechanism right now is mass immigration, just like in Europe.
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:31.280]  Destroy Western Europe, the same thing.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:32.840]  So that's the big, that's the big game.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:36.320]  And I know Matt Bracken's talked about this, you know, quite a bit and he's right.
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:39.560]  This is their mechanism and they've been doing this now, they've been working on this now
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:44.800]  since the 1970s or 60s, they've been, they've been trying to, like as I said before, trying
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:51.040]  to turn anyone who's not white or not completely white into an enemy against their own country
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:54.520]  by playing, you know, racial identity politics and trying to convince them that this is an
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:58.520]  oppressive nation, trying to turn blacks and Hispanics against against their own country.
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:03.240]  It has failed largely, I think, inside the United States, you know, the large percentage
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:07.480]  of Hispanics there at the El Paso rally for Trump, but a quarter of the audience was Hispanic.
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:08.480]  I was there.
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:11.480]  A lot of blacks waking up now, the walkaway movement.
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:16.040]  So I think they're really amping up this idea of replacement, thank you, instead of, instead
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:20.200]  of, and they're replacing not just, you know, white Americans, but also black Americans
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:22.960]  and Hispanic Americans who are patriots.
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:24.920]  They can't brainwash them into hitting their own country.
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:25.920]  That's failing.
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:29.800]  You know, bring in people from other countries that they think will be more amenable to being
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:31.360]  turned against this country.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.360]  That's it.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:36.200]  And this is really a complex issue overall, but let's kind of focus in on the details
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:38.160]  that you're talking about right here.
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:43.480]  It all starts, and this is really, I would say, like you said, since the 70s, maybe,
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:47.920]  maybe 30, 40 years with the brainwashing in the schools and in the media, which is basically
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:49.080]  communist propaganda.
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:54.480]  But what they do is they paint, they only show you one side of America's history.
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:59.720]  There's obviously an ugly part of America's history, not just slavery of black people,
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:03.480]  but they also put a bunch of Japanese people in internment camps, many of which ended up
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:04.480]  being spies.
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:08.600]  You know, the Irish that came here were treated like dirt for a while, too, so there's a lot
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:09.600]  of ugly stuff.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.000]  I mean, we dropped two atom bombs for Christ's sake.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.280]  I mean, let's repent for that, too.
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:20.120]  So yes, there is a lot of nasty history, but, you know, we liberated women in the West.
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:22.040]  We ended slavery in the West.
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:26.000]  We had the whole idea come to fruition of self-government and independent in the West.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.400]  I mean, these are the things that have made America strong.
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:36.320]  But what they do is they highlight the negativity, and then they somehow, it's like they somehow
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:41.640]  imprint just the face of a white male on the whole concept of America.
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:46.880]  They drum up a bunch of hatred against white males, and so then it's like, oh, well, let's
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:51.600]  start a race war, let's start a class war, let's get all of these people hating Americans,
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:56.040]  and then once we replace the white population, we can seize total control.
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:57.040]  And they even already have the studies.
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:00.640]  I think by 2050, whites will no longer be a majority of this country, whether it's good
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:01.640]  or bad, it's different.
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:02.800]  It doesn't matter.
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:09.200]  The point is it's this big, large race warfare overthrow of the United States of America,
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:14.600]  and it's honestly like the racial warfare is kind of the lynchpin in their entire plan.
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:18.680]  We're right, because it used to be the communists were all about the workers of the world unite
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:23.040]  of all races against the, you know, the so-called capitalist oppressors.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:28.240]  But then, you know, a good, good moment in history where they shifted was at the weather
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:29.240]  underground.
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:33.640]  Actually, it was back then it was a student for Democrat Society, SDS, at a national convention.
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:38.280]  And in the hard cores, who became the weather underground later on, Bill Ayers, Bernardine
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:41.080]  Dorn, they split with the Maoists.
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:46.640]  The Maoists wanted to focus still on workers' rights and in class warfare.
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:52.840]  But Bernardine Dorn and Bill Ayers, they instead wanted to go into identity politics, primarily
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:53.840]  racial.
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:54.840]  That was the big split on the left.
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:56.560]  And that's where they went.
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:57.560]  They dumped the workers.
[01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:00.840]  That's why you had all your, that's why you had this giant sucking sound of jobs being
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:01.840]  taken overseas.
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:03.800]  That's why you had Detroit falling apart.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:07.400]  They abandoned the working class of America, who then turned around and voted for Trump.
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:13.680]  And they instead went to the identity stuff, gays, women, race, et cetera, to divide this
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:14.800]  country up.
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.400]  But that is failing.
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:21.760]  And I think that the best indicator of the falseness of this program they're on is that
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.600]  look at what happens to conservative blacks.
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:26.840]  Look at Clarence Thomas or Thomas Sowell.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:31.080]  If you're a conservative black, in other words, you're a black person who believes in the Constitution,
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:34.600]  believes in individual liberty and prosperity, they hate your guts too.
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:36.200]  So there's still really communists.
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:37.200]  This is a veneer.
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.640]  It's a fake veneer of being concerned about race.
[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:42.160]  They really are still at the soul of it.
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:43.160]  They're communists.
[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:45.040]  Well, and you don't even have to be a conservative.
[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:46.480]  Just look at Kanye West.
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.480]  I don't believe he's a conservative.
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:51.400]  I mean, he's even said his politics don't really line up with President Trump's.
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:53.760]  He just puts on a hat.
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:55.880]  The guy just puts on a hat and they hate him.
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:56.880]  Hat crime.
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:57.880]  He's got a hat crime.
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:58.880]  Right.
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:52:59.880]  Look at Kanye.
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:01.280]  He's committed a hat crime.
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:03.520]  So it really just shows how deranged they are.
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:04.520]  But you know what?
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:05.600]  Because here's, again, what it all comes down to.
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:06.600]  It's all about an insurrection.
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:08.840]  It's all about an overthrow of this country.
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:11.880]  Now, Stuart, we have them admitting.
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:16.280]  We have them admitting they tried to overthrow the president with the 25th Amendment.
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:19.440]  We have them admitting they tried to illegally spy on the president with a wire.
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:22.160]  This is on top of all the illegal spying they were already doing.
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:25.080]  I mean, isn't it time for the president to come out and declare a national emergency
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:28.560]  against the fact there's a coup happening right now in this country?
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:34.520]  Well, for sure, he could come out and say, I'm going to prosecute these people for conspiracy
[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:38.200]  to commit sedition, which is what that is.
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:43.160]  And he could also declare California and the sanctuary states, as you were referring to
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:47.360]  earlier, they are an open rebellion against the laws of the United States.
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:51.080]  Primarily the immigration laws are committing felonies, harboring, eating and abetting illegal
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.080]  aliens.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:53.600]  That's actually treason by U.S. code.
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:56.600]  I wouldn't say it's treason, but I looked it up.
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:57.600]  It is.
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:58.600]  Are you sure?
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:53:59.600]  I read it on air one day.
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:05.300]  If you are knowingly, if you knowingly are keeping an illegal alien, knowingly harboring
[01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:09.760]  illegal aliens, that's treason, or excuse me, maybe it wasn't listed as treason, but
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:15.440]  if it's a felony, if I'd have to go back and read the U.S. code, if one of those illegal
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:19.040]  aliens or if an illegal alien that you have in the United States and you're knowingly
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:24.320]  harboring commits a crime, a deadly crime, you can now face the death penalty.
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:26.200]  So maybe that's why I think it's something you're treasoning and death penalty.
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:27.760]  I think that that's actually what it was.
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:29.000]  So this is happening almost daily.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.880]  I mean, the one guy bragged about killing cops.
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:33.040]  Who?
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:38.840]  The illegal, the non-citizen immigrant who was in court, he killed a cop and he's sitting
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:41.040]  in there laughing about it and saying he's going to kill more.
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:45.240]  Well, the guy who killed sin, the deputy up there in California.
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:46.240]  That was another one.
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:49.240]  He was another legal alien gangbanger who was associated with the cartels.
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:52.720]  So I think Trump should, he should declare the cartels to be international terrorists,
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:53.720]  which they are.
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:57.280]  Declare them to be fourth generation warfare, military enemies in the United States that
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:59.600]  are taking over U.S. territory, which they are.
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:04.480]  Cover the troops and declare California and all the other sanctuary cities to be an insurrection
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:07.960]  and an aiding, directly aiding in conspiracy with the cartels.
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:10.400]  That's what he should do.
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:13.880]  And you know, honestly, the thing is too, and we tend to forget this because we're kind
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:15.960]  of armchair quarterbacking it.
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:19.600]  There's so much the president has to, I mean, there's so much corruption.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:21.440]  There's so much dirt he has to clean up.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.440]  Right.
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.240]  And you know, we're, I mean, I'm not a purist.
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:28.480]  You would probably be closer to purist than me, but it's like this frustration has been
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:31.920]  building, I think, in America for so long.
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:35.520]  We just want to see results and we feel like Trump is one of the only hopes or one of the
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:38.480]  only chances we've had to maybe clean this up legitimately.
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:40.400]  I know that Alex Jones is going to be talking about this, folks.
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:43.840]  He's about to join us here in the next hour.
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:47.880]  And he's going to be wanting to cover this as well as the coup against the president.
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:51.640]  But I think that, I mean, don't you think that's kind of our frustration too, Stuart,
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:54.720]  with the president is that he really has so much to do.
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:58.320]  And we just want to see it get done because we're worried that he might be the last chance
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:55:59.600]  the last person to do it.
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:03.200]  Well, he is our last chance to do this through conventional politics, I think.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:06.880]  I mean, I mean, I've got a crystal ball, but what we can do, I think he's getting bad
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:07.880]  advice.
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:08.880]  It could be intentional.
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:13.480]  So what we can do is make sure that he knows from us what the real powers he has.
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:17.520]  And you're actually, and you're actually in doing a lot of that stuff with oathkeepers.org,
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:18.520]  folks.
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:20.680]  So make sure that you're staying tuned to oathkeepers.org because I know that you're
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:23.320]  doing a lot of stuff to show support for the president because you think that's the
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:25.680]  next thing is to just public support for the president.
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:26.680]  Let him know we have his back.
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:31.960]  And let him know, I'm bringing in Dr. Vieira, a national, nationally known constitutional
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:35.240]  scholar on presidential powers and the militia in particular.
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:38.960]  I've asked him to write up his recommendations for the president, which we're going to publish
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:39.960]  and try to put in his hands.
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:43.840]  And I believe we're having him on the show here, I think actually tomorrow, he's coming
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:44.840]  on the show.
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:48.400]  I think it's important for people like that, that's who it's A.G. should be.
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:50.720]  The Attorney General should be someone like Dr. Vieira.
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:54.400]  So we can at least bring together the right advice for him and let the folks out there
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:58.720]  know what the right steps are so they can go and start pushing this too on his Twitter,
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:02.600]  through social media, calling the White House, et cetera, so that he gets the message about,
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:03.600]  here's his real powers.
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:08.160]  You know, it's kind of like Horton hears a who, we're shouting to the president, here
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:09.160]  are your actual powers.
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:10.160]  He's like, what?
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:11.160]  He's like, what?
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:12.160]  What's that noise?
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:13.160]  Yeah.
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:16.360]  And he's got all his, all his, all his, all his, all his counselors around him plucking
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:19.120]  his ears and screaming, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, you know, don't listen to that.
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:23.400]  And he's like, wait a second, I hear something like, no, you don't, you don't hear anything.
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:24.880]  There is no Alex Jones.
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:26.400]  We silenced Alex Jones.
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:27.400]  Exactly.
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:32.040]  No, Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the next hour, ladies and gentlemen, Stuart
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:34.200]  Roach, Mothekeepers.org with us as well.
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:37.880]  He's going to be with us definitely in the fourth hour, taking your phone calls with
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:38.880]  myself.
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:42.880]  But coming up next, it's Alex Jones to break down the deep state coup against the president,
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:48.040]  which it could go hot any moment, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:03.120]  This is high end.
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:06.560]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.

[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:16.200]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all

[01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:45.800]  to destroy this country.
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:46.800]  It's that simple.
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:47.800]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:47.800 --> 02:00:04.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:07.480]  Well you heard it here yesterday folks and Alex Jones is about to come on and break it
[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:08.480]  down.
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:10.760]  InfoWars is next year's news today.
[02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:15.000]  We told you the night Trump was elected.
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.720]  Obviously if you really want to get into it that they were going to try to remove him
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:18.720]  from office.
[02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:22.720]  But the story from Kid Daniels just hit InfoWars.com.
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:27.280]  InfoWars revealed the 25th Amendment to USAID coup against Trump in 2017.
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:29.040]  Alex is going to come on and break that down.
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:30.720]  This is why they want us censored.
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:33.920]  But Stuart, I have to come out now.
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:39.880]  I've made a decision because the president obviously understands the art of the troll.
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:44.920]  We have seen that executed in the last weekend since Friday.
[02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:48.000]  So I am making an appeal to the president.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.360]  I want to be appointed the troll master-in-chief.
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:55.520]  I want to be appointed troll master-in-chief because I came up with a brilliant strategy
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:59.520]  on how we can actually get some border security at the southern border.
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:06.200]  I think Trump needs to call Putin and he just say, look Vladimir, they already think I'm
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:07.200]  colluding with you.
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:09.640]  So let's just go ahead and collude for the first time ever.
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:16.600]  Can you just send 5,000 troops to our southern border or just send 5,000 Russians?
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:18.920]  Just send them to our southern border and just can you have them invade?
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:22.760]  Can you just have a bunch of Russians invade our southern border so I can say, look, the
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:23.920]  Russians are coming.
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:26.760]  The Russians are coming and then see if the Democrats can act.
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:32.720]  So this president, if I was your troll master-in-chief, this would be one of my strategies here.
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:38.280]  Have Russians invade the southern border and then they can bring a bunch of AK-47s, they
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:41.800]  can bring a bunch of voter ID cards, have the Russians come up, they can all have a
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:44.960]  social media account too, some Russian bots.
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:51.200]  So as your self-appointed troll master-in-chief, Mr. President, it's time to collude with Russia
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:53.680]  and have Russia invade the southern border.
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:56.320]  Maybe then we can finally get some border security.
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:02.760]  Of course, as you're well aware, I think ICE detains people crossing the southern border
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:03.760]  illegally.
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:05.480]  It's about 48 different countries every year.
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:10.200]  Right, so really, anybody other than Mexicans, any OTM, can claim asylum.
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:13.760]  So they've got people, they've got people from China, they've got people from Afghanistan
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:17.680]  crossing the border, and now, of course, any of those people could also claim asylum.
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:21.440]  So all the Russians you have in the day could claim asylum as well.
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:26.120]  So that'd be my first move as the troll-in-chief.
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:33.360]  I would then work on a deal with either Sweden or with Venezuela and we'll do kind of a
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:35.920]  socialist exchange program.
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:40.240]  So hey, you know, get Cortez on board, sign up for the socialist exchange program, we'll
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:43.880]  ship you over to Sweden, you can go be a good socialist, we'll ship you down to Venezuela,
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:47.080]  you can go be a good socialist, and we'll take someone from those countries that wants
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:50.680]  to work hard and not be a socialist, but a free market capitalist.
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:51.680]  How about that?
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:52.680]  I would send her to China.
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:53.680]  That's more in line with her.
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:54.680]  To China?
[02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:55.680]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:02:55.680 --> 02:02:56.680]  She's pretty much a malice, yeah.
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:57.680]  Okay, well that's fine.
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:02:58.680]  Any communist country is fine.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:02:59.680]  Yeah.
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:01.880]  It's the communist exchange program or the socialist exchange program.
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:05.840]  You go live in the favorite government of your choice, communist socialism, and we'll
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:10.000]  take someone that loves the free market, that will come here and not suck off the government.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  Like a Sotsenitsyn.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  Exactly.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  Yeah.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  We'll give you one of our comments.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  We should have done this years ago.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.200]  We could have taken Sotsenitsyn and sent one of our professors, or Hollywood actors,
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:20.200]  to Russia.
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:21.200]  Yeah.
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:24.120]  So these are just some of the things I would do, President Trump, if I was your troll-master-in-chief.
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:26.640]  So I'm just saying, the appointment, it should be waiting.
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:30.760]  I'll be waiting for my phone call, and we'll start to make some of these moves happen.
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:36.720]  So when we come back though, I mean, see, the coup is happening against the president
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:41.000]  right now, Stuart, because the president is Donald Trump, but really, the coup against
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.640]  the United States government has been going on for decades.
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:44.640]  Yeah.
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:46.480]  And he just got in the way.
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:47.480]  That's why he's a big target.
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:48.480]  Exactly.
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:51.720]  But the real target, that's why they hate MAGA hats, and they hate anybody who's on the
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:52.720]  right.
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:54.320]  The real target is us.
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:59.840]  It's like the two minutes hate in 1984, you know, he's Goldstein, but we're his followers
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:00.840]  who are hated.
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:04.760]  And if it was somebody else, you know, whoever you would want to put in there, who is also
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:07.720]  a populist or a constitutionalist, they'd be hating him too.
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:09.160]  Well, look at what they did to Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:14.160]  I mean, she tries to be populist, and she goes against the wars in the Middle East.
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:15.560]  The Democrats come out and hate her.
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:18.440]  I mean, look, I wouldn't vote Tulsi Gabbard for president.
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:20.120]  I disagree with her on a lot of fundamental things.
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:24.680]  I think she's probably the best candidate, maybe for the Democrat party though, and they
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:26.080]  just threw her under the bus.
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:28.840]  They just totally threw her under the bus because she goes along with President Trump
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:30.400]  and stopping foreign intervention in the Middle East.
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:35.920]  So when we come back, Alex Jones is going to be joining us, and he is going to break
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:41.400]  down the attempted coup against the president of the United States that we predicted.
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:46.800]  Quite honestly, we, I mean, Alex pretty much called this like zero hour once President
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:48.280]  Trump got elected.
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:52.280]  But in words in 2017, so Alex is gonna break that down on the other side.
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:59.280]  It doesn't go anywhere.
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:31.160]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:34.040]  and beyond system in the world.
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:36.440]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:41.040]  It is a total game changer, and it comes in easy to use, packets to mix it with fruit
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:43.680]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:44.960]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:46.480]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:50.600]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force
[02:05:50.600 --> 02:06:01.960]  because it will take you into overdrive, turbo force, and enforce live.com.
[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:08.560]  And now the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:14.480]  It's Owen Troyer, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:19.200]  You want to see the real people that hate the truth, that hate this country that want
[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:24.200]  to see us divided and want to see this nation fall, go ahead and watch this compilation
[02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:31.480]  of all the media that knowingly went along with the Jesse Smollett hate crime hoax.
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:36.920]  Empire star Jesse Smollett was the victim of a vicious, racist, and homophobic attack.
[02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:40.280]  His attackers hurled racial and homophobic slurs.
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:43.680]  Two people yelled racist and homophobic slurs.
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:45.480]  Racial and homophobic slurs.
[02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:51.120]  Not only homophobia, we're talking about racism, we're talking about hate with steroids.
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:55.360]  They are looking for two suspects who are apparently wearing Make America Great Again
[02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:56.360]  hats.
[02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:58.840]  The offenders uttered, this is MAGA country.
[02:06:58.840 --> 02:07:02.080]  The hate crime went down early this morning in Chicago.
[02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:04.640]  Officials are investigating the alleged assault as a hate crime.
[02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:08.200]  And now police say they're investigating this as a possible hate crime.
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:11.720]  Anyone attacked in a hate crime like this is an outrage.
[02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:17.280]  This is stomach turning, mind boggling information.
[02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:18.280]  It's out of control.
[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:23.120]  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi tweeting the racist homophobic attack on Jesse Smollett
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:25.160]  is an affront to our humanity.
[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:29.960]  And Senator Cory Booker said the vicious attack on actor Jesse was an attempted modern-day
[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:30.960]  lynching.
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:34.080]  Kamala Harris calling the attack an attempted modern-day lynching.
[02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:37.440]  I'm so shaken by the story, this is horrible to report.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:38.440]  This is a horrible story.
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:40.440]  I like this is a horrible story.
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:42.480]  Yeah, I mean this circumstances is horrific.
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:44.680]  Rent this an unacceptable.
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:45.680]  Absolutely despicable.
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:50.360]  Yeah, a lot of people can't believe this is actually happening in 2019.
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:53.760]  It's hard to believe that we're reporting, that we're even saying words like this in
[02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:54.760]  2019.
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:59.120]  This is America in 2019.
[02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:02.000]  Now that's right, fake news that goes along with the hoax.
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.560]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:05.440]  Total people committed to fake news.
[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:07.560]  Total people committed to destroying this country.
[02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:11.240]  Total people committed just to destroying everything.
[02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:14.600]  Just lie about anything, go along with anything, as long as it destroys America, as long as
[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:15.600]  it creates a divide.
[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:21.600]  But we kind of came up with a solution for Mr. Smollett during the break here.
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:24.440]  He needs to plead insanity.
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:27.880]  He needs to plead that he has Trump derangement syndrome and that's what led him to do this.
[02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:28.880]  His only defense, really.
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:29.880]  His only defense.
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:30.880]  Yeah, that's pretty much it.
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:37.080]  The only way to get off of being a criminally found guilty of filing a false police support
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:38.080]  is to claim insanity.
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:42.320]  You know, we joke about this, but that's actually what happened.
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:46.960]  I mean, I've said it countless times.
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:49.240]  This is mass mental illness that we're dealing with.
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:52.160]  No, I think he's actually, I wouldn't get him off the hook so fast.
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:55.000]  I think he's part of a planned operation.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.440]  You think he's part of the Democrat Party trying to destroy this country?
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:08:59.840]  As you said earlier, he's a Democratic operative.
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:00.840]  Yeah.
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:01.840]  That's what he is.
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:02.840]  Well, he goes to these Democrat events.
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:04.160]  I mean, he is a Democrat operative.
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:08.960]  Now, whether or not the Democrats had anything to do with their fake hate crime and had their
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:10.600]  fingerprints on this, I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:15.040]  In fact, I'd probably bet on it if I was betting, man, but we'll see if any investigation turns
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:16.040]  that out.
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:19.200]  By the way, Smollett has now made public comment he's not going to meet with Chicago police.
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:22.480]  Yeah, that's because that's what his defense attorneys have to do now.
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:26.040]  That's what happens when you get caught filing a fake police report.
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:32.880]  All right, folks, Alex Jones is about to be joining us, but before he does, we have
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:41.360]  a new study that just came out of the University of Colorado Boulder that says indoor air quality
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:45.120]  levels are on par with a polluted major city.
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:48.680]  So this is the average American home.
[02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:55.160]  The air quality in the home is as bad as the air quality in a major city.
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:58.000]  So I mean, you can go look at the stories out of California.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.120]  It has some of the worst air quality in the world.
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:02.280]  Okay.
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:06.720]  You can go look at other similar studies that have studied the air quality in homes and
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:13.840]  what they find is a lot of toxins and stuff that you want to filter out of the air in
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:14.960]  your home.
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:19.640]  So we see these studies, just like we see studies about all the toxins that they put
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:23.360]  in the water, and we offer a solution at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:25.760]  We've got the Alexa Pure Breeze air filter.
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:27.640]  It's $50 off right now.
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:34.240]  See, when I read a story about how air in the average U.S. home is totally polluted,
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:39.960]  I want to do something about that for my own personal life, for guests that I have over.
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:43.800]  If you have a family, for your children, you want to have clean air in your home.
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:47.920]  But just in general, I mean, you would think that when you find out that the average air
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:52.040]  quality in the home is filled with toxins, you'd want to filter that.
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:53.200]  Well, we want to filter it.
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:54.840]  We assumed you want to filter it.
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:58.280]  That's why we brought you the Alexa Pure Breeze at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:10:59.880]  It's $50 off right now.
[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:01.720]  Folks, you can go read the reviews.
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:03.680]  In fact, we encourage you.
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:09.000]  You can go do your own research, and you won't find a better quality air filter for a better
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:13.240]  price than the Alexa Pure Breeze at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:14.520]  And you will notice the difference.
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:15.520]  I have two in my house.
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:18.480]  I definitely notice the difference when they're on and when they're off.
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:23.120]  It is a world of difference, and that's because, as the studies have just come out, the average
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:28.560]  American home is filled with toxins that are on par with that of a major city.
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:32.400]  A polluted major city is essentially inside your home.
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:34.480]  So don't live like that.
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:36.320]  Don't have guests over to a polluted home.
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:37.960]  Don't raise your kids in a polluted home.
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:43.480]  Go to InfowarsStore.com and get the Alexa Pure Breeze right now, $50 off.
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:46.360]  Alex Jones is on the line.
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:48.360]  Alex, what are you about to cover?
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:53.200]  Well, I wanted to be listed in the broadcast yesterday, and you and Stuart and the rest
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:58.040]  of the crew have done a great job, but I just want to say something, even though Infowars
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:03.600]  is on fire from enemy attacks, but also on fire from telling the truth, so we're in
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:08.680]  Fuego, and we're also on fire from enemy attacks, both the good fire and the bad fire.
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:14.240]  The fact that fakeacrimes.org, the big story up on Infowars.com, it was thousands of fake
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:20.120] acrimes that have been committed by the left, always, against themselves, has gone down
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:23.400]  after a small scandal, probably from just massive traffic.
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:29.600]  When I was first talking about the term false flag, that I only read in naval British histories
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:34.840]  where the French and the Brits and the Spanish were always staging attacks against each
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:40.840]  other, going back 500 years, no one used the term false flag.
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:43.480]  No one used the term inside job.
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:48.840]  No one used the term provocateur event, even though they had congressional hearings about
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:53.160]  our own government staging massive terror attacks against other governments, other government
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:54.840]  staging massive terror attacks.
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:59.600]  It was all in the academic literature, but no one knew about it.
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:01.680]  They thought it was a term I made up.
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:06.320]  Well, now look at how no matter what they do to Infowars, no matter what they pull, everybody
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:10.280]  knows that most events are staged when the left's involved.
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:14.960]  Everybody knows there's been thousands of fake events at universities and black churches
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:19.640]  and everywhere where you get the attention, you get a bunch of donations, you burn a cross
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:25.840]  in your yard, you paint a poop swastika on your dorm, you say no black people, welcome,
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:31.480]  you go hire two Nigerians to go get a rope, put around your neck and dump bleach on you
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:35.560]  so you can be the number one guy in the media and make yourself a huge victim.
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:39.560]  And now even though it's come out that it's fake, he's doubling down, there's articles
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:43.480]  on Infowars.com where all these Hollywood people are saying, we don't care if the media
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:44.480]  got it wrong.
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:45.480]  It's for a good cause.
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:50.840]  And that's what you've got to understand is the Democrats are betraying America's
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:54.600]  Christian ethos of coming together around an idea of freedom.
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:14:00.600]  They're using race to control while claiming they're the people trying to stop racial conflict.
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:06.000]  And so everybody who's listening understands this, but I mean, here's the big enchilada.
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:10.360]  They have tried to suppress this, it doesn't work anymore.
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:14.760]  And people fundamentally are going to question any event they're going to ask the woman or
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:17.360]  Latin term, who benefits, keep on them.
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:21.840]  And once people start looking, head events and studying them and don't just believe them
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:28.520]  on the hand, the whole bottle acts, melts away, the wheels come off the wagon, the whole Ponzi
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:39.960]  scheme, the house of cards, the giant facade, the huge Ponzi scheme, the gigantic scam fiasco
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:44.640]  collapses in, you realize everything the left does is about making you poor, making you
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:47.800]  dumb and using you to fund their system.
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:52.840]  Everything they do is about making you stupid, making you a victim, making you disempowered.
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:15:00.160]  And now it's so beautifully sick.
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:05.120]  Catholic school boys being set up, being loud about not blowing up on their face, or whether
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:11.600]  it's all these other big events that are constantly, constantly breaking now.
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:16.840]  This is blowing up on their face, Owen, and he's doubling down, refuses to meet with police.
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:25.720]  The Nigerians both worked on the set of his program, Empire, on ABC for Years, the hit
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:26.720]  TV show.
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:29.120]  One of them was a major actor on it.
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:37.000]  He has now said he never knew them in public statements, so he's in video scenes with one
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  of them.
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:42.560]  Okay, reportedly he was obviously really good friends, we don't know what I mean, with one
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:43.560]  of them.
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:48.160]  So what's incredible is, when he heard two people were busted, he was all about, yeah,
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:49.160]  that's who did it.
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:53.200]  As soon as he found out it was the guys that he knew, and that he had reportedly hired,
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:55.560]  it was all over, so here's the deal.

[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:01.680]  I sued the IRS in one.

[02:18:56.360 --> 02:19:00.760]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:05.460]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:06.960]  to detoxify the body.
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:11.840]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:13.360]  It's made in the USA.
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:18.280]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:20.120]  the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:22.360]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:25.920]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:30.800]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as

[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.680]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:59.320]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:27.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:34.680]  Asking through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:41.640]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here on a landline and we've got Owen Schroder riding shotgun in
[02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:44.480]  the ATX and any regular listener knows.
[02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:50.360]  I don't hype things, but people think what I'm saying at the time of their new listener
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:55.160]  know this is hype, but then a year later, two years later, five years later, two years
[02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:57.720]  later, they go, oh my gosh, that's exactly what was going on.
[02:20:57.720 --> 02:21:03.840]  Well, imagine if you were the breakaway criminal deep state coup group in the CIA and in the
[02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:10.520]  FBI that's only a splinter group, a rogue group, telling all the other agency groups
[02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:12.720]  under you that you're actually in command.
[02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:19.600]  Well, that's what happened two years ago, two years and five months ago when the president
[02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:20.600]  was president-elect.
[02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:23.840]  And they said, he's a Russian, Alex Jones is a Russian.
[02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:25.600]  We have the intel, we have the proof.
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:31.160]  They had congressional hearings in 2017 straight up.
[02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:38.120]  Never called us to Congress, never subpoenaed us, they just said, on TV, we put the clips
[02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:43.440]  there probably a hundred times, Alex Jones is a Russian agent, Donald Trump was elected
[02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:44.920]  by Russians.
[02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:50.320]  And that whole thing was then used by the rogue FBI controlled by the Clintons and others
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:56.680]  to literally say Trump was illegitimate and try a 25th Amendment coup on him.
[02:21:56.680 --> 02:22:01.480]  But despite threatening Trump's cabinet, despite all the fake dirt, despite all the leaks inside,
[02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:06.040]  they could find nothing because there is nothing except Trump working around the clock to try
[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:10.400]  to turn the economy back on and battling the media, which he does, is his favorite sport.
[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:12.360]  And they call it screwing around.
[02:22:12.360 --> 02:22:15.000]  No, he's battling them hardcore.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:22.560]  So here we are, two years and five months into this, and yes, we've had massive big
[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:28.200]  tech censorship, we've had total war on informal wars crippling our operations, but our listeners
[02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:30.240]  have helped fast, so we're still here.
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:36.240]  But the good news is, it's now on CNN, The Washington Post, The New York Times in the
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:42.320]  last month, that there was a deep stake that they were trying to remove from, that they
[02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:45.680]  were acting against the president, that they did it on the 20th Amendment, because they
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:47.560]  know it's all criminal.
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:52.560]  They're having to admit it now to get it out there first, because they know grand juries
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:56.600]  are looking at former acting director McCabe and others.
[02:22:56.600 --> 02:23:00.680]  So everything the audience has done to help get Trump elected, everything you've done
[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:04.440]  now to battle the deep state, whether Trump's purpose or not, doesn't matter.
[02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:07.520]  This has revealed the permanent deep state.
[02:23:07.520 --> 02:23:12.400]  This revealed the bureaucracies that believe they run the three branches of government.
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:17.960]  It has shown these arrogant monsters for who they are, but we want to know why they were
[02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:23.200]  so desperate two and a half years ago, two years ago, a year ago, to get us off air while
[02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:28.240]  they were obsessed in House Judiciary Committee hearings and House Armed Services committees
[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:33.640]  and Senate Intelligence Committee hearings and other committees to get in full wars off
[02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:39.960]  the air, to shut Paul Watson down, to do all this, is because they kept asking, how does
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:40.960]  Alex Jones?
[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:41.960]  I'm not bragging, folks.
[02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:44.960]  Within this is the answer to defeating them.
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:48.120]  I'm not telling you two years later, look, we were right to go, oh, look, we're right.
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:49.120]  We're real news.
[02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:53.600]  Folks, that's why they came out for us more than anybody.
[02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:56.640]  We pointed out that Google and Apple were moving to China.
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:58.920]  They had such disrespect for America.
[02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:04.000]  We pointed out the massive Chinese-style social network coming to America and Europe
[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:05.400]  to suppress free speech.
[02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:06.800]  We kept breaking every point.
[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:14.440]  That's why two years ago, a little less than two years ago, about 22 months ago, a criminal
[02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:16.720]  national security investigation was opening.
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:19.960]  It's my self-personneling and in full wars.
[02:24:19.960 --> 02:24:25.880]  Parts of this even leaked to McClatchy and AP, and they said I was in a criminal investigation.
[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:31.840]  That was so high-level that Trump then discovered it and had briefings with some of his intelligence
[02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:36.080]  people that weren't globalists, and they said, sir, it's because his analysis is dead on.
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:41.200]  But because my analysis was so dead on, they thought, okay, it must be true.
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:45.520]  He must be having with Chinese or the Russians or somebody in the government give him this.
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:46.720]  No one could know this.
[02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:47.720]  No one could know this.
[02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:48.720]  I studied COG.
[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:49.720]  I studied LL Lemnitzer.
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:50.720]  I studied Northwoods.
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:51.720]  I studied Gladio.
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:56.760]  I studied what the New York Times said when he was president-elect, they were going to
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:24:58.360]  remove him and how they had him kill on him.
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:03.440]  I studied the branches of government and how they operate, so I could see when they had
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:05.880]  their own people on TV saying, we're going to take him out.
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:08.400]  We're going to kill him in 2017.
[02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:13.200]  They were doing that as a confidence operation to keep their stay behind networks of criminal
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:17.840]  operatives in the government involved in muting against the president, believing the cavalry
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:18.840]  was coming.
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:23.000]  Well, now the cavalry never came and now they're all criminals and they're about to get indicted.
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  Trump lowers the boom.
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.000]  So that's the good news.
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  And forwarders have paid a massive price for this.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:34.120]  But what's incredible is these white shoe-boy Harvard people literally could not believe
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:37.600]  that I've reverse-engineered their entire operation with total precision.
[02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:38.600]  I'm not bragging.
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:41.800]  I don't know how I do it, but I've studied history of all the best catched on.
[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:42.800]  I live this stuff.
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:46.160]  And it's kind of like, you know, like I said, a few weeks ago, when you don't think about
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:49.680]  it, you're at 20 feet away, 30 feet away, and you throw double bulls-eye, triple bulls-eye
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:50.680]  with darts.
[02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:53.640]  It's when you don't think about it, you hit the bulls-eye every time.
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:59.320]  And they flipped out and that's why the Secret Service, this song record, by the way, creased
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:06.080]  out to me about 18, 19 months ago, I guess about 20 months ago, and said, yeah, obviously
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:08.560]  the POTUS wants us to talk to you.
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:09.560]  This is off the record.
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:13.960]  I said, well, I'll be off the record for now if you guys take action, but if you don't,
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:20.960]  they said, fine, fine, they said, we want to know, it was a long conversation and I got
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:24.720]  contacted by other agencies, including the Pentagon, they said, we, the president wants
[02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:28.880]  to know how you know what's going on, and I said, oh, because they've opened a national
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:34.680]  security investigation, they stopped and they said, okay, okay, yes.
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:40.000]  And I said, well, I mean, my God, you got the former head of the Black Ops for the CIA
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:41.920]  on TV, said they're going to kill the president.
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:46.320]  You got Clapper, you've got Brennan Olsen, they're going to kill the president, they're
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:51.120]  on television saying they're about to take him out in December, this is in 2017.
[02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:54.840]  I said, it's obvious they're getting their stay behind groups to be confident, including
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:57.920]  some of their whacked out paramilitary people in the Pentagon to make the move.
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:02.680]  And I said, I'll send you a report, and I said, I'll go on here tomorrow and I'll list
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:03.680]  all those out.
[02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:06.440]  I'm not going to say it's for the Secret Service, but I'm going to say it's for intelligence
[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:11.880]  agencies, and I did a whole hour long thing listing all of this stuff on screen, and I
[02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:16.040]  mean, a PowerPoint via online to the good people in government.
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:19.640]  And that's how this got flagged when they opened an actual security investigation on
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:25.000]  me, because the deep state got so freaked out that I was seeing exactly what was happening.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:28.960]  But the president's main question from the Secret Service was, who do you think is in
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:31.040]  command of it?
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:34.080]  And I said to the Secret Service, I said, well, obviously the president knows who gave
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:37.160]  out the illegal orders during the campaign to spy on him.
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:42.160]  He knows who continued it on and put the stay-behind networks in during the John Moore Defense
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:47.720]  Authorization Act and the Countering Foreign Disinformation Propaganda Act, and the Secret
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:48.720]  Service was like, what's that?
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:50.520]  And I said, I'll send it all to you.
[02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:55.480]  But I said, it's a Barakusian Obama, and his co-president, Hillary Clinton, they divided
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:56.880]  the government up against each other.
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:00.640]  Well, they just bushed and gave Cheney half the government.
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:04.920]  That's exactly what happened under Hillary and Obama, and I said, those co-presidents
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:09.720]  set up a stay-behind network, look up what that is, talk to your intelligence operatives,
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:13.360]  and find out what happened, and then I've sat there and briefed them on the whole thing.
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:19.240]  That was put into a briefing, the president, who was delivered to him about 18 months ago.
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:26.080]  Now, since then, they went into the psychotic kill Alex Jones, because no one else, it isn't
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:28.360]  like I was the one that knew this.
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:32.960]  Everyone else, the lawyers, the politicians, even the generals, they all know this stuff,
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:38.640]  but they're scared to put their name on a report, because the deep state will kill you.
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:43.000]  So that's our value here, ladies and gentlemen, as a kamikaze and patriot for America.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:47.120]  I am willing to tell you the truth and commit and put out the reports of the world, and
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:48.120]  never stop.
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:51.240]  We'll be right back, and that's why your backing of us is so critical.
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:55.040]  You back the important wars, you back the true internal, organic, defense network.
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:57.560]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:00.120]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:04.280]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:05.400]  of control.
[02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:10.720]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and
[02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:12.560]  using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:16.840]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:17.840]  me.
[02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:20.840]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:24.400]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:27.080]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:28.560]  Get sober now.
[02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:31.880]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:32.880]  It's simple.

[02:29:43.800 --> 02:30:11.920]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:18.200]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:22.320]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a
[02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:24.560]  few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:31.160]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout
[02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:34.000]  and beyond system in the world.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:35.520]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:36.520]  Must experience it.
[02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:38.320]  It is a total game changer.
[02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:42.440]  It comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit juice or water, whatever you
[02:30:42.440 --> 02:30:43.440]  like.
[02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:44.440]  Warning, though.
[02:30:44.440 --> 02:30:45.440]  It's very, very strong.
[02:30:45.440 --> 02:30:46.440]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:50.560]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce
[02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:53.120]  because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:30:53.120 --> 02:30:55.120]  TurboForce and m4slive.com.

[02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:18.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:34.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live on this Monday edition on Shorter's there in
[02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:35.720]  the ATX studio.
[02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:41.840]  Roger Stone is in his studio in Florida and again, everybody watches Netflix, everybody
[02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:44.520]  watches HBO, everybody watches Superman and Star Wars.
[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:45.520]  That's not real.
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:48.840]  I know you know that I'm not being condescending.
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:49.840]  This is the real world.
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:59.560]  We published over 50 articles, over 100 reports, specifically saying and naming the FBI agents
[02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:06.680]  and the CIA agents who were part of a cabal put in by the Clintons and the Bushes and specifically
[02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:11.040]  how they were planning to coup, the illegal intelligence, the illegal spying, covering
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:15.440]  up for their own Michigan, how they plan to intimidate members of the cabinet.
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:21.480]  And create a hysteria that the president was unfit to lead and to overturn the election,
[02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:23.880]  remove pins and install Pelosi.
[02:34:23.880 --> 02:34:27.040]  Now they publicly admit this.
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:32.880]  Every show on Netflix or HBO or ABC or CBS or NBC, children's shows, that's based in
[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:38.840]  contemporary times, literally shows white people murdering and killing Hispanics everywhere.
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:42.080]  Literally shows white people lynching blacks everywhere.
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:46.560]  Literally shows everyone being in the KKK, whose wife, to create a race war.
[02:34:46.560 --> 02:34:49.440]  It's in the WikiLeaks of Democrats for planning this.
[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:52.480]  So they have thrown everything they've got with the American people.
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:57.080]  And just like this big black activist has come out and said it's on infowars.com, the
[02:34:57.080 --> 02:35:01.600]  government, the rogue government was trying to create a race war and the Jesse Smollett
[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:02.600]  should be arrested.
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:03.600]  Exactly.
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:07.680]  It's not just, that guarantee of folks, Smollett got directed to do that.
[02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:09.640]  That's why he's producer.
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:10.640]  That's why the managers.
[02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:18.920]  That's why it's why the network is defending him no matter what is because ladies and gentlemen,
[02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:23.040]  you go to a Trump rally, there are people that go inside who buy brand new mega hats
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:24.040]  and attack.
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:27.160]  There are people that attack the police and say they're Trump supporters.
[02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:32.600]  We caught it in the WikiLeaks two and a half years ago that it was Democrats doing it.
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:34.120]  And by the way, Hillary was funding it.
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:37.640]  They would dress up like Bernie people and attack Trump supporters as well.
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:40.880]  I'm not defending Sanders, this is just true.
[02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:42.120]  So this is what's going on.
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:47.360]  And Roger Stone was one of the first people on infowars, obviously he's indicted because
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:48.360]  of it.
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:51.680]  On this very show, and again, we're going to have big articles written, we're not about
[02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:55.400]  two Narrow Horns, but that's why they're trying to destroy us.
[02:35:55.400 --> 02:35:57.400]  And then that means we know how to counter them.
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:05.320]  The going back 2017 by March, we were writing articles saying deep state planning to against
[02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:06.880]  Trump using 25th amendment.
[02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:14.640]  I looked it up over 50 articles on infowars.com, just type into a search engine, deep state
[02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:21.200]  planning to against Trump, deep state planning, 25th amendment coup, infowars.com, type those
[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:25.880]  terms in, hit enter, that's how you get around the censors, it's with the infowars.com end
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:29.480]  of the search, in the search box, okay?
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:30.480]  And you will see it.
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:33.360]  Now again, that's why they want a soft air.
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:38.240]  Nobody said Smollett two weeks ago, day one, I said, I bet this is staged.
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:45.560]  Nobody's out in Chicago, in the freezing cold, in the middle of the night, wearing maya hats
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:47.080]  beating up a black dude, okay?
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:50.960]  I mean, rednecks would probably take a black guy out right around four wheelers and get
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:51.960]  him drunk.
[02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:52.960]  I mean, that's what real rednecks do.
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:53.960]  It isn't going on.
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:54.960]  It isn't happening.
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:37:01.360]  The last real racial attack they had was just the black guys and the white guys hate each
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:05.440]  other in prison, and the one guy been a gang leader in prison, and the white supremacist
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:09.560]  drug the black guy to death like 15 years ago in Texas, and then later some other black
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:11.800]  members of the gang found a white guy drug him to death.
[02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:12.800]  It's all terrible.
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:13.800]  It's stupid.
[02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:14.800]  It's bad.
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:15.800]  It's evil.
[02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:16.800]  Well, that same racism doesn't exist.
[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:19.800]  But my God, folks, you go to the Middle East, you go to Somalia, five minutes after you're
[02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:20.800]  out of your car.
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:24.360]  If you're an American, I don't care if you're black or white, if you're an American, you
[02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:28.600]  are kidnapped, and you are tortured, and you were sold for ransom, and the ransom ain't
[02:37:28.600 --> 02:37:30.400]  paid, you're killed.
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:35.280]  So let's stop demonizing America all day, and stop thinking we import all this evil
[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:37.960]  culture that people reject American culture.
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:41.640]  You want to come here and adopt our culture of freedom and free market and success, and
[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:42.640]  I'm all about it.
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:49.640]  But you want to come here and piss and crap all over it, I'm not, so here's the big news.
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:51.720]  The balloon is gone.
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:59.560]  It's happening, and so the bad news is, myself, inforwars.com, everything we're doing is under
[02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:04.600]  massive globalist attack, unprecedented, the dirty tricks, the attacks, everything they're
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:09.520]  doing, taking bank accounts away, the lawsuits, taking sponsors away, because they keep freaking
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:12.960]  out saying, my God, how does Alex Jones know all this?
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:16.920]  I want to bring Roger Stone up on the 24th Amendment, but Roger, I mentioned this to
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:21.320]  you back at the time, the crew got the call from the Secret Service, and I got some other
[02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:24.800]  visits and some things, and they literally were not just investigating me.
[02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:30.040]  They were saying, no, we've found out that the deep state is investigating you.
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:33.040]  They want to know how you have this intel, but the president heard about it and thought,
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:35.080]  well, how does he have that intel?
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:38.800]  So in their attempt to shut me up, it started an actual stereo investigation, that is the
[02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:44.640]  rogue FBI and CIA, that triggered the Secret Service to then actually contact me and say,
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:45.640]  who are you with, the ringletters?
[02:38:45.640 --> 02:38:49.840]  And I said, you know who the ringletters is, it's Barack Hussein Obama, and it's Hillary
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:54.760]  Clinton, and they were just like, yes, I'm like, yeah, so you better decide which side
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:55.760]  you're on.
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:56.760]  You better take action.
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:38:57.760]  Well, here we are, almost two years later.
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:38:59.760]  Who was proven right, Roger Stone?
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:04.880]  That's our platinum value, and it's why we're under attack because we're the most successful
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:09.360]  operation in the country to defend this damn republic, and if people don't stand with us,
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:10.360]  fine.
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:11.360]  I don't even mind going down.
[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:14.040]  I'm sick of fighting this hard, but if people don't know that we're the platinum standard
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:18.000]  of fighting for this republic and kicking globalists ass, then to hell with everybody,
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  because we're under total fricking attack, bring Roger in.
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:31.280]  All right, Alex, I think you summed that up extraordinarily well.
[02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:32.280]  You're absolutely right.
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:37.720]  This is a classic example of info wars presenting tomorrow's news today.
[02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:43.280]  We were the first media outlet in the country, really, to expose the 25th Amendment plot.
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:47.800]  Now, for those who don't know what the 25th Amendment is, it is an amendment up to the
[02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:54.360]  constitution that holds that if a majority of the cabinet, plus the vice president, believe
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:40:00.800]  the president has been incapacitated, and they co-sign a letter that removes him from
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:07.040]  office with the proviso that he can appeal that decision to the House of Representatives.
[02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:11.360]  I reported right here on info wars that that was a foot.
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:17.800]  We learned subsequently that Rod Rosenstein was one of the leading progenitors of this
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:24.920]  plan, that he actually volunteered in the wake of James Comey's firing to wear a wire
[02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:29.520]  to try to entrap the president in a 25th Amendment takedown.
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:35.560]  We now have not only the statement by Andrew McCabe, but more importantly, two senior
[02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:42.080]  FBI agents who testified under oath before the Congress also confirmed that they were
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:48.400]  a party to FBI meetings about this very plot to take down the president.
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:54.000]  The first time this surface, Rosenstein tried to say he was joking, he was only jesting,
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:59.840]  Rod, that's not very funny, and you spoke about it on more than one occasion.
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:07.080]  Additionally, the council at the FBI began to review the legality of such a move.
[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:09.640]  This is open sedition.
[02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:12.400]  This is treasonous activity.
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:16.440]  There is no evidence whatsoever that the president is incapacitated.
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:18.560]  You just don't like his policies.
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:25.000]  You don't like the fact that he's broken up the globalist cabal, and if he's so incapacitated,
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:30.000]  why do we have 4.8 million new jobs, for example?
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.360]  Roger, we're about to go to break room, come back and get into this, because you were instrumental
[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:36.240]  in breaking it all almost two years ago, but here's the bottom line.
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:37.680]  It's not just that we broke it.
[02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:42.700]  We carried the ball, we got it to the president, they opened a national security investigation
[02:41:42.700 --> 02:41:47.800]  on me, actually done one on you, literally stating, and I've heard this from high-level
[02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:53.200]  individuals from multiple agencies, that Jones must have foreign intelligence on our phone
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:54.200]  lines to know.
[02:41:54.200 --> 02:41:57.920]  We had no big piles of traitors crap when I see it, and then these idiots were all bragging
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:41:58.920]  about most of it on TV.
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:41:59.920]  They think we're stupid.
[02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:01.920]  They're the ones that are stupid.
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:03.640]  We didn't just break it.
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:09.000]  We fired the back signal two years ago, and that's why we're now a fire base under total
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:14.480]  destruction order, because we are dutiful, patriot Americans committed to this republic
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:16.000]  in our country and our elected president.
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  That's why we're under attack.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:21.040]  But I'm just telling the president, everybody else, damn it, we need support now, right
[02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:24.800]  now, we need support because we think the enemy knows we're going to break the next
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:25.800]  big story.
[02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:29.600]  They know our gaze and our understanding of the operations is so deep, they want us
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:30.600]  shut down.
[02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:37.600]  We're going to break, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Towson to come back in.
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:40.200]  This is just so epic.
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:42.480]  The good news is we've come a long way.
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:45.440]  We're having some major success right now, but we tell you, we're in the thick of the
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:49.800]  fights, whatever you do, have your listings, spread the word, don't tune in for war.com.

[02:43:55.320 --> 02:43:59.280]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:03.800]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania states, but a lot of us on the big island
[02:44:03.800 --> 02:44:09.240]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:14.640]  Big ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:16.160]  to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:22.680]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:26.680]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:28.000]  in the rainwater.
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:33.080]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter, and not only were the
[02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:39.440]  heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:45.080]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:50.400]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:56.360]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:45:03.240]  This bar, at its regular price, is a little over $3. When we have it discounted, it's
[02:45:03.240 --> 02:45:06.200]  at about $2.50 a piece.
[02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:10.160]  Comparable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece to add whole foods.
[02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:11.160]  This is high-end.
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:16.800]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3, you get them for $2.50 or so when you
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:19.560]  get it at the current launch discount.
[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:24.240]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all
[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:28.400]  ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:30.800]  It's available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:31.800]  It's simple.

[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:39.720]  against the globalist and the attempt that we're engaging to take the country back.
[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:40.720]  It's simple.
[02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:44.640]  Go shop with the good guys at InfoWarsStore.com and break the back of the globalist and get
[02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:46.600]  high-quality super discounts.
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:50.800]  Or keep shopping with Jeff Bezos and Amazon and keep going to Whole Foods that are actually
[02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:54.400]  funding the Washington Post and the globalist attempt to destroy this country.
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:55.400]  It's that simple.

[02:45:56.400 --> 02:46:00.600]  Our grandparents and great grandparents know that they can food during the fall, so they
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:01.600]  have it during the winter.
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:05.640]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:42.760]  If you've got a three-year supply, if stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:45.320]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:50.360]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:58.840]  InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWars Select, high-quality storeable foods, powered by my patriots supply.
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:16.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:26.480]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:29.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, my friends, here's the good news.
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:33.040]  I said earlier today, it's absolutely true.
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:37.560]  We are, I would say, winning about 56% right now.
[02:47:37.560 --> 02:47:41.160]  We had to use numbers in a metric of 100.
[02:47:41.160 --> 02:47:47.880]  The enemy is at about a 47% right now, and they have been caught.
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:52.440]  They have done every bit of race-baiting, every bit of culture war, every bit of lying,
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:53.440]  every bit of nastiness.
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:56.440]  They have exhausted every trick they've got.
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:00.000]  They have run false flags, they have stayed fake.
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:06.280]  Racial attacks, they have just, I mean, every racial attack we've seen, literally 99% of
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:10.680]  the last two years has been later confirmed to be fake, and that's the good news.
[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:16.560]  Now, the people know that those that stage attacks stand again from them, now that they're
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:23.320]  being investigated, that power is being taken away, and now that any video, like the Covington
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:28.680]  school kids we saw, that was totally staged, now that we know what to look for, it doesn't
[02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:29.680]  matter.
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:30.680]  They can't censor everybody.
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:36.800]  One mother, one father, one school teacher, one firefighter, one police officer, one lawyer,
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:42.280]  one doctor, one auto mechanic, going out to public events, just videotaping what's happening
[02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:43.280]  at any big public event.
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:46.280]  You're going to see the left come up and provocateur.
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:50.280]  You're going to see them attack innocent groups and stage and cut videos.
[02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:53.920]  After they punch you in the face, they'll stand back when you get mad and say, I'm
[02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:58.440]  a veteran, leave me alone, and then say, F you white scum, we'll kill you soon.
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:02.840]  Your mother is a piece of filth, married to your father, and then, oh, I'm a nice Hispanic,
[02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:04.720]  why do you need me?
[02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:07.880]  And again, these are paid operatives.
[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:14.080]  They have a criminal operation, a rule to commit evil, and they think it's their time.
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:18.160]  We were in the middle of a revolution by the globalists to take over the rule, but all
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:20.960]  of the rule, instead, it's a revolution against them.
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:27.320]  So we have the upper hand, but maximum energy is now needed, maximum focus, and that means
[02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:31.680]  don't just support them for us, unless you want these goblins, devil-worshippers, and
[02:49:31.680 --> 02:49:34.800]  they're going to kill babies after they're born, and actually doing it.
[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:40.360]  Get out there, videotape, start your own YouTube, your own Facebook, your own Twitter, but build
[02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:45.200]  your own website where you back it up on third-party sites in case they censor you.
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:47.200]  They can't stop us all.
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:49.200]  Give you mobilize and take action.
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:50.200]  It's over.
[02:49:50.200 --> 02:49:55.920]  We're going back to Roger Stone, and I'll ensure we've seen so many big victories here,
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:50:01.800]  this whole Jesse Smollett guy, and all of this and how they're doubling down, clearly
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:06.040]  showing that network's involved, ABC's involved.
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:09.880]  Everything they do turns to pure crap, as the opposite of the Midas touch, because they're
[02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:13.920]  now not operating in the dark with a group of gullible people.
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:17.880]  They're operating under a giant spotlight, and yeah, there's so many, they're still
[02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:21.920]  going to buy it, but censorship, hold the enemy to hear this.
[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:26.440]  It's not going to give you air superiority, because no one buys a damn thing you do.
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:28.440]  Roger Stone, I'll ensure.
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:32.320]  All right, Alex, thank you very much.
[02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:34.680]  We are picking it up from there.
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:40.800]  Owen and I tried to clarify people for people, a question that seems to still be very much
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:42.480]  on everyone's minds.
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:50.840]  The very first interview I gave after a judge ordered a gag order in my case was with InfoWars
[02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:52.040]  on the war room.
[02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:53.040]  That's right.
[02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:54.480]  I have not been gagged.
[02:50:54.480 --> 02:50:59.760]  My First Amendment free speech rights have not been abridged.
[02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:05.240]  I'm entitled to speak anywhere on any subject, other than inside the courthouse or on the
[02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:09.040]  steps of the courthouse, which is fairly standard.
[02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:14.400]  Interestingly enough, the judge did put a gag order on all of the witnesses and all of
[02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:17.840]  the attorneys involved in my case.
[02:51:17.840 --> 02:51:19.280]  So there's the clarification.
[02:51:19.280 --> 02:51:25.120]  Now you wouldn't know that, Owen, for reading Politico or reading The New York Times or
[02:51:25.120 --> 02:51:30.120]  The Washington Post, all of whom read the headline, but none of whom seemingly read
[02:51:30.120 --> 02:51:31.520]  the actual order.
[02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:36.680]  Well, let's just take a brief look at all the fake news as we talk about the latest
[02:51:36.680 --> 02:51:38.960]  fake news about your case, Roger.
[02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:41.500]  Okay, we've got the Jesse Smollett hoax.
[02:51:41.500 --> 02:51:44.560]  You've got the Covington Catholic lie and attack.
[02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:48.680]  You've got the Justice Brett Kavanaugh lie and attack.
[02:51:48.680 --> 02:51:50.040]  You can go even back further.
[02:51:50.040 --> 02:51:55.200]  Remember when Trump was in, I believe it was Japan, and he was feeding the koi fish, and
[02:51:55.200 --> 02:51:57.360]  they said, oh, look at Trump.
[02:51:57.360 --> 02:51:59.040]  He doesn't care about Japanese tradition.
[02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:03.520]  He just dumped the whole food in the koi pond, and it was like, no, that was what they did.
[02:52:03.520 --> 02:52:04.520]  That was the whole thing.
[02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:06.000]  They all did it, but they cut it and lied about it.
[02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:09.240]  They said he removed the Martin Luther King bust from the White House.
[02:52:09.240 --> 02:52:10.240]  Another fake news hoax.
[02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:14.920]  I mean, these people engage in fake news hoax after fake news hoax, after fake news hoax,
[02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:15.920]  after fake news hoax.
[02:52:15.920 --> 02:52:18.960]  They're like, Roger, they don't even know how to tell the truth anymore.
[02:52:18.960 --> 02:52:21.360]  It's like their instinct is to lie now.
[02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:24.360]  By the way, we're going to co-host into the next hour.
[02:52:24.360 --> 02:52:25.360]  I didn't explain that.
[02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:28.120]  We're going to push stewards on a red job back 15 minutes, so I'm not leaving.
[02:52:28.120 --> 02:52:29.640]  I wanted to get your take here.
[02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:32.640]  But look, listen, there's so many hoaxes, we should just try to list them.
[02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:36.080]  It would take hours to do it, but, but Roger, what about this one?
[02:52:36.080 --> 02:52:41.080]  They said that Owen and I said no one died at Parkland, but we never said that.
[02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:45.120]  We broke that the police stood down, which was later confirmed they've admitted it.
[02:52:45.120 --> 02:52:51.000]  We had the students on, and CNN said the students were actors, what they claimed doesn't sing,
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:56.120]  and then they got more lawsuits filed against me with Sandy Hook parents saying we sued
[02:52:56.120 --> 02:53:03.160]  because we were told Alex Jones was sending people to San, to, to, to Florida homes coming
[02:53:03.160 --> 02:53:04.160]  after them.
[02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:09.440]  So again, the media is just completely engaged in a wall of fraud unless we can get into your
[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:11.720]  old Russia gate thing, Roger.
[02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:12.720]  We can get into that.
[02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:13.720]  They said that you were gagged and it wasn't true.
[02:53:13.720 --> 02:53:18.200]  I want to do that next hour, 15 minutes, but what do you make of this gargantuan 25th Amendment
[02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:22.520]  blowing up everywhere and being all over the news and now being admitted?
[02:53:22.520 --> 02:53:24.720]  I mean, this is so spectacular.
[02:53:24.720 --> 02:53:27.400]  What does Trump do now?
[02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:33.440]  There was a spectacular piece by Mark Penn, who, who was actually a Democratic strategist
[02:53:33.440 --> 02:53:39.000]  who ran Hillary Clinton's previous presidential campaign, but Republican or Democrat, he hit
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:40.520]  it right on the head.
[02:53:40.520 --> 02:53:45.920]  We have, we have uncovered an abuse of power that makes Watergate look like small potatoes.
[02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:51.680]  There was a coup d'etat planned within the highest echelons of the FBI and the Obama
[02:53:51.680 --> 02:53:59.760]  Justice Department, and then they actually effectuated it under Donald Trump to remove
[02:53:59.760 --> 02:54:04.920]  a duly elected Republican president simply because they didn't like the outcome of the
[02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:12.080]  election and because he fired proven perjurer, James Comey, and it is coming down around
[02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:13.080]  them.
[02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:18.440]  It also points out in Penn's incredible piece that the Mueller investigation is the outgrowth
[02:54:18.440 --> 02:54:20.240]  of that same effort.
[02:54:20.240 --> 02:54:25.800]  Ron Rosenstein, who was standing in as the acting attorney general, appointed Robert
[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:28.280]  Mueller as the special counsel.
[02:54:28.280 --> 02:54:31.520]  Robert Mueller's job is to take down Donald Trump.
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:36.640]  It's ironic that he had auditioned, he had interviewed for the job of FBI director only
[02:54:36.640 --> 02:54:43.360]  the day before and that Donald Trump had wisely decided to pass over Mr. Mueller for that appointment.
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:48.960]  The very next day, he was appointed the head of the Get Trump Squad.
[02:54:48.960 --> 02:54:51.760]  That is a stunning conflict of interest.
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:59.720]  Last night, I met with Jaylin Martin, who is one of the Parkland students who appeared
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:04.560]  here on Info Wars, and he confirmed everything you just said, Alex.
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:05.560]  He was there.
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:07.360]  He was in the building.
[02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:09.160]  His life was at danger.
[02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:14.840]  You never said, and Owen never said, and no one at Info Wars ever said no one died at
[02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:15.840]  Parkland.
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:20.640]  We correctly, and I objected at the time and you were right.
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:24.640]  We now know that six officers did stand down.
[02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:30.480]  That is an established fact, proven in the local news media here in Florida.
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:35.440]  Nothing you have reported regarding Parkland is inaccurate or untrue, and the idea that
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:40.440]  Info Wars was sending people to students' homes in Florida is bogus.
[02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:41.440]  It's nonsense.
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:42.440]  It's false.
[02:55:42.440 --> 02:55:44.440]  It's the epitome of fake news.
[02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:48.600]  What do we do, Roger, because they use that to take us off Roku.
[02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:49.600]  That was at the New York Times.
[02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:57.400]  I told them that we've seen national news reports that threaten to kill Parkland students.
[02:55:57.400 --> 02:56:00.960]  That's how they're taking us off the ears with this criminal lie.
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:05.560]  I think only a lawsuit against Roku is going to get us restored.
[02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:09.600]  They are desperately afraid of our message here at Info Wars.
[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:11.400]  That's what this is about.
[02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:15.120]  When we say Info Wars is the tip of the spear, we're not kidding.
[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:20.480]  When we say that Info Wars is the early warning system for the counter-revolution that they
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:26.400]  are now trying to foment against the duly elected president and the surge of prosperity
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:30.120]  and economic growth that he has fostered, we're not kidding.
[02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:35.040]  They want to shut us down because of the content of what we say, and they mischaracterize what
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:36.040]  we say.
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:40.440]  They try to put words in our mouth, things we've never said, yet they're the ones who
[02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:43.880]  get caught lying again and again and again.
[02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:49.440]  Last Friday, CNN, Special Prosecutor has new evidence of stone communications with Wiki
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:50.440]  League.
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:55.280]  Nonsense, fake news, and we here at Info Wars were the first ones to correct it.
[02:56:55.280 --> 02:56:59.240]  Thank God for the Daily Beast and a handful of others who got the truth out there right
[02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:00.880]  behind Info Wars.
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:02.440]  This is what we're up against, folks.
[02:57:02.440 --> 02:57:08.280]  They want to shut us down because Alex Jones is the polar revere of this narrative.
[02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:12.680]  He's the early warning system to tell you what the globalists have afoot and what's
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:14.200]  going to happen next.
[02:57:14.200 --> 02:57:18.840]  That's why we need you to go to theinfowarsstore.com and support us because without your financial
[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:24.040]  support, there is zero chance that we can counter the counter revolution.
[02:57:24.040 --> 02:57:26.640]  These are great products as well.
[02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:27.640]  They're amazing.
[02:57:27.640 --> 02:57:28.640]  We're all there at InfoWars.com.
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:35.160]  $50 off the electric debris that leading competitors are $500, $600, $700, same fourth
[02:57:35.160 --> 02:57:36.160]  stage Ion filters.
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:38.080]  They just have a little bit markup.
[02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:39.080]  We don't have it.
[02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:43.280]  BigSaleInfoWars.com, you may have had a hot talk fast to a slip there.
[02:57:43.280 --> 02:57:54.520]  You mean the Daily Caller, you don't mean Daily Beast, right?
[02:57:54.520 --> 02:58:00.920]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:06.680]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:11.120]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in
[02:58:11.120 --> 02:58:13.560]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:58:13.560 --> 02:58:20.120]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[02:58:20.120 --> 02:58:23.000]  and beyond system in the world.
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.400]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[02:58:25.400 --> 02:58:30.440]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed with fruit juice
[02:58:30.440 --> 02:58:32.400]  or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:36.280]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half pack at the
[02:58:36.280 --> 02:58:40.280]  first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you
[02:58:40.280 --> 02:58:41.280]  into overdrive.
[02:58:41.280 --> 02:58:42.280]  TurboForce and inforcelife.com.
[02:58:42.280 --> 02:58:52.240]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best selling, highest rated products
[02:58:52.240 --> 02:58:54.120]  that we can then private label and sell.
[02:58:54.120 --> 02:58:58.880]  Well there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the
[02:58:58.880 --> 02:59:04.880]  strongest out there and we private label it and we sell it for $10 less online than they
[02:59:04.880 --> 02:59:07.440]  sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[02:59:07.440 --> 02:59:12.360]  We also have another product also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[02:59:12.360 --> 02:59:16.560]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.
[02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:22.160]  We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best selling products right
[02:59:22.160 --> 02:59:25.640]  now at inforcelife.com and inforcelife.com.
[02:59:25.640 --> 02:59:28.400]  This is a limited time, Immune Boost Special.
[02:59:28.400 --> 02:59:35.400]  Get super blue silver Immune Gargle and super silver wound dressing for 40% off at inforcelife.com.
[02:59:35.400 --> 02:59:38.760]  Again, this is a limited time, Immune Boost Special.
[02:59:38.760 --> 02:59:49.800]  Get super blue silver Immune Gargle and super silver wound dressing for 40% off at inforcelife.com.
[02:59:49.800 --> 03:00:09.480]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[03:00:09.480 --> 03:00:15.040]  Monday through Friday, from 11 am to 3 pm central.
[03:00:15.040 --> 03:00:16.040]  I'm Alex Joe, your host.
[03:00:16.040 --> 03:00:18.040]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:23.040]  Again, every time I try to get on air and be calm about all this, I just can't do it.
[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:24.040]  This is so epic.
[03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:28.040]  Obviously, it's good that we get excited because other people are excited.
[03:00:28.040 --> 03:00:32.200]  Over the years, we've been excited about things, but now there's no way to turn up the volume
[03:00:32.200 --> 03:00:33.200]  anymore.
[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:34.200]  Here's an example.
[03:00:34.200 --> 03:00:38.160]  My wife pointed out that we haven't been on vacation in almost a year.
[03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:43.040]  She said, can we just go for the Caribbean for five days?
[03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:44.040]  I said, sure.
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:48.560]  We're in a middle-class, nice hotel.
[03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:52.040]  Nobody's in the front area when I get here a couple of days ago.
[03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:54.240]  We're checking in.
[03:00:54.240 --> 03:00:56.440]  We go upstairs to our room.
[03:00:56.440 --> 03:01:01.840]  My wife wanted to ask some question of the concierge.
[03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:07.560]  She goes back down and she hears people by the concierge saying, did you hear Alex Jones
[03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:08.560]  is here?
[03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:09.560]  Yeah, he's awesome.
[03:01:09.560 --> 03:01:10.560]  Yeah, he's great.
[03:01:10.560 --> 03:01:17.800]  Then she goes against the elevator and there's two women and a man on it and she's going
[03:01:17.800 --> 03:01:24.720]  back up to the floor and they're saying, yeah, Alex Jones, that horrible person's here.
[03:01:24.720 --> 03:01:28.080]  The other woman says, I thought he's in prison.
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:33.240]  The man says, no, no, that's the other one, that's that stone guy.
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:38.200]  The other woman says, well, he deserves to be in prison for what he did to the Sandy
[03:01:38.200 --> 03:01:39.200]  Hook people.
[03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:40.200]  Here's the deal.
[03:01:40.200 --> 03:01:43.960]  I don't even know who killed the kids at Sandy Hook, Adam Lanz, or most people.
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:48.600]  People literally think, because years ago when others questioned it, I questioned it,
[03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:49.600]  looked at some anomalies.
[03:01:49.600 --> 03:01:52.800]  Years later, it said, no, I think it happened, but think about that.
[03:01:52.800 --> 03:01:56.080]  We have the smaller case, which we first questioned.
[03:01:56.080 --> 03:01:58.240]  I said, it may have happened, but usually this stuff's fake.
[03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:04.160]  I mean, that's completely normal to do that, but these people now think we deserve to be
[03:02:04.160 --> 03:02:11.760]  in prison, and sure, I probably shook a hundred hands, both the women at the ticket counter
[03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:17.760]  when I flew out Saturday morning at five a.m., six a.m., we're listeners.
[03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:21.760]  The captain came over when I got off the plane and wanted to shake my hand.
[03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:25.880]  All this stuff, so 10 to one, we get positive stuff.
[03:02:25.880 --> 03:02:31.440]  When I walk around the pool or anywhere, people point and they shake their head, and some
[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:36.760]  of them will, like, say, really rude things to my wife, or they'll walk over to shake
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:37.760]  their head at her.
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:42.520]  Am I at my youngest daughter, older to stay at home with my parents?
[03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:44.320]  And it's just a joke.
[03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:49.960]  I mean, these people, Roger, and I went on another planet, and I'm not complaining.
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:53.960]  I just don't think listeners get the level of brainwashing we're dealing with.
[03:02:53.960 --> 03:02:54.960]  Roger?
[03:02:54.960 --> 03:02:59.600]  Well, as I was going to say, not only that, they don't understand how we're winning right
[03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:03.600]  now in the revolution, that's part of their plan with the censorship, is so that we don't
[03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:05.920]  talk about how we're having this revolution.
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:07.720]  We don't talk about how we're coming back.
[03:03:07.720 --> 03:03:11.280]  We don't talk about how we're battling the deep state right now in a cold civil war.
[03:03:11.280 --> 03:03:13.840]  So that's like another level of this.
[03:03:13.840 --> 03:03:18.360]  It's like a fake victory for them to just erase you and say, see, we beat Alex Jones,
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:21.480]  even though you go out and you're one of the most popular guys when you go out, people
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:22.480]  want to shake your hands.
[03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:23.480]  Same with you, Roger.
[03:03:23.480 --> 03:03:26.080]  That's part, that's exactly what my wife said, that's the part of it, to make it so
[03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:30.280]  easy to go and I'm like, they literally think I've been defeated and I'm in prison, that
[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:34.680]  if that's in their phone simulation, we're not the guys that got Trump elected and turned
[03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:35.680]  the country around.
[03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:39.840]  We're the guys that are supposed to go to prison, sorry, go ahead.
[03:03:39.840 --> 03:03:44.760]  You know, Alex, I've actually found that it's actually beginning to turn since the incredible
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:51.240]  raid at my home in which 29 agents from the FBI stormed my home in the pre-dawn hours.
[03:03:51.240 --> 03:03:56.560]  I find now in public, an even higher level of support, an even higher level of people
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:04:01.520]  offering money, offering prayers, offering support for my legal defense fund, and almost
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:04.560]  all of them say, hey, tell Alex Jones I love him.
[03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:06.800]  I love what you guys do at InfoWars.
[03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:12.480]  So I've actually found a surge in our support since this overreach by the government.
[03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:18.560]  No, I have two, but still the brainwash idiots that are on board, they think we're supposed
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:20.120]  to be in prison, Roger.
[03:04:20.120 --> 03:04:27.720]  Because they read the mainstream media, like when CNN says, new evidence of stone contacts
[03:04:27.720 --> 03:04:28.720]  with Wikileaks.
[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:30.960]  I mean, it's just, it's nonsensical.
[03:04:30.960 --> 03:04:36.640]  CNN has ceased to be a legitimate news organization years ago.
[03:04:36.640 --> 03:04:38.320]  It's a propaganda front.
[03:04:38.320 --> 03:04:43.000]  I think most Americans now realize it, CNN is fake news.
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:47.840]  I don't get my news from CNN for the same reason I don't eat out of the toilet.
[03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:54.840]  InfoWars is the only place where we give it to you straight from the global news.

[03:05:58.640 --> 03:06:05.160]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[03:06:05.160 --> 03:06:16.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:06:16.800 --> 03:06:24.560]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex
[03:06:24.560 --> 03:06:25.560]  Jones.
[03:06:25.560 --> 03:06:30.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live, Stuart Rhodes, and I'm sure you're about to take
[03:06:30.680 --> 03:06:36.920]  over my soul from Roger Stoner here, but in the final equation, I'm a very calm person
[03:06:36.920 --> 03:06:40.960]  in person that can really methodically lay things out and plan things and do things that
[03:06:40.960 --> 03:06:46.280]  people have seen with InfoWars, but when I get in front of a crowd of people, instead
[03:06:46.280 --> 03:06:54.560]  of having kind of an anxiety issue of being in front of crowds, the opposite, I get fired
[03:06:54.560 --> 03:06:55.560]  up.
[03:06:55.560 --> 03:07:01.080]  People have been in a coma, they've been in a trance about this globalist evil, so I
[03:07:01.080 --> 03:07:05.000]  think the Lord works mysterious ways, and I think the fact that I've been bombastic
[03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:09.360]  or that I sound like a professional wrestler sometimes, has actually helped get people
[03:07:09.360 --> 03:07:13.200]  out of their trance, and I want to thank the listeners for what you've done.
[03:07:13.200 --> 03:07:17.880]  I keep thanking you because you just understand you are 99% of the equation, and I salute you,
[03:07:17.880 --> 03:07:19.880]  and I thank you, and we have begun to win.
[03:07:19.880 --> 03:07:25.720]  Now, they think they can punish Roger, and I want to do this soon, and myself, and poorly
[03:07:25.720 --> 03:07:30.720]  Anne McAdoo, and others like that, but nobody has turned on me in our inner circle.
[03:07:30.720 --> 03:07:34.480]  They've gone and found a few very, very sad people they've been able to pay to get to
[03:07:34.480 --> 03:07:40.680]  lie, and it's very, very sad, but you know, this is a war, and freedom isn't free, but
[03:07:40.680 --> 03:07:44.640]  I wanted to ask Roger and Ellen in closing before we turn it over to Stuart Rose, who
[03:07:44.640 --> 03:07:50.440]  did a great job with Owen, where do you think this goes next, because the corporate media,
[03:07:50.440 --> 03:07:55.520]  the Decepticon media has thrown everything they can at us, and at the president, and
[03:07:55.520 --> 03:08:02.240]  even in their skewed polls, Trump is up, you know, 56, 58, you know, 78%, even in their
[03:08:02.240 --> 03:08:06.200]  own system, you can see it, the level of support we're getting.
[03:08:06.200 --> 03:08:09.600]  You've heard Roger say how bad it's been on the street, when he tells you it's getting
[03:08:09.600 --> 03:08:10.600]  better, that's because it is.
[03:08:10.600 --> 03:08:11.600]  Same thing with me.
[03:08:11.600 --> 03:08:17.920]  So, we're not putting perfume on a pill here, we're still in a serious fight, but what are
[03:08:17.920 --> 03:08:25.040]  the globalists going to do as everyone now thinks about staged events, and Jesse Smollett
[03:08:25.040 --> 03:08:29.600]  and the Covington kids, and Kavanaugh, I mean, now they've been in camp, where I grew up
[03:08:29.600 --> 03:08:34.840]  in Dallas, Texas, for three months with the NPR and other news agencies, going through
[03:08:34.840 --> 03:08:38.760]  the yearbook trying to get somebody to tell a lie about me, and they called up saying,
[03:08:38.760 --> 03:08:43.480]  oh, all these horrible lies last week, and I said, this is insane, I'm really disturbed,
[03:08:43.480 --> 03:08:48.760]  and John Lomson went, I'm sorry, the truth's hurting, you do need to cry, and I went, no,
[03:08:48.760 --> 03:08:53.840]  man, none of this is true, but my point is, is that they are going insane, and they are
[03:08:53.840 --> 03:08:58.640]  intensifying their lies to the next level, I don't see them backing down now, Roger Owen,
[03:08:58.640 --> 03:09:02.560]  I see them going more insane, so what do you expect out of the big state, and their minions,
[03:09:02.560 --> 03:09:06.840]  and the Trump Arrangement Syndrome, A, and B, what should Trump do?
[03:09:06.840 --> 03:09:12.000]  Well, I'll go first here, I think that the radicalized left still to a certain level
[03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:15.960]  will lick their finger and stick it in the air to see which way the wind blows, so they're
[03:09:15.960 --> 03:09:21.160]  constantly kind of morphing and moving and calling audibles as far as their next attack
[03:09:21.160 --> 03:09:25.960]  is concerned, for example, I think after what they did to Roger, their next plan was to
[03:09:25.960 --> 03:09:31.320]  do that same thing here to InfoWars, and to you, Alex, and they saw the negative backlash,
[03:09:31.320 --> 03:09:36.240]  they saw how they got fully exposed on that deal, so they kind of walked back from that,
[03:09:36.240 --> 03:09:40.600]  and they decided, okay, we're gonna go ahead and try to stage this big hate crime hoax,
[03:09:40.600 --> 03:09:43.800]  have the media go along with it, maybe start a race war, blame Trump, and then, oh, it'll
[03:09:43.800 --> 03:09:47.800]  finally be proven Trump supporters are racist, that blew up in their face, so I think they're
[03:09:47.800 --> 03:09:52.000]  gonna step back from the hate crimes for a minute now too, so my guess is their next
[03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:58.560]  wave of false flags, fake news, attempt to divide and conquer is gonna be something against
[03:09:58.560 --> 03:10:03.880]  the president, maybe they drum some new Russian collusion BS up, maybe they drum some new
[03:10:03.880 --> 03:10:04.880]  narrative up about the president.
[03:10:04.880 --> 03:10:08.080]  I agree with you, you're really smart of them, I'm really impressed, Alan, they're gonna
[03:10:08.080 --> 03:10:13.040]  bring women back up, they're gonna bring more women, they say you're right to back up, Roger.
[03:10:13.040 --> 03:10:19.480]  The president needs to immediately declassify all the information regarding the illicit
[03:10:19.480 --> 03:10:25.520]  use of FICE awards to spy on his campaign, which is where this all began, the president
[03:10:25.520 --> 03:10:31.120]  needs to order his new attorney general to appoint a special counsel to examine not only
[03:10:31.120 --> 03:10:37.600]  the FICE awards, but now to examine this illegal coup and to impale a grand jury to grab those
[03:10:37.600 --> 03:10:43.480]  who are involved in it and bring them before that grand jury to begin the indictments for
[03:10:43.480 --> 03:10:48.720]  sedition, and lastly, the president needs to appoint a special counsel to examine the
[03:10:48.720 --> 03:10:54.760]  crimes of uranium one, those are the immediate steps I think the president needs to take
[03:10:54.760 --> 03:11:01.320]  to counter what is obviously an effort to topple his presidency.
[03:11:01.320 --> 03:11:06.080]  And Roger, the good news is we've been arping on this two years, you, myself and Owen, it
[03:11:06.080 --> 03:11:09.440]  looks like he is going in that direction, we've gotta keep the heat on the president
[03:11:09.440 --> 03:11:12.680]  himself and keep this front and center, but that's gotta scare the hell out of the big
[03:11:12.680 --> 03:11:14.760]  state though, Roger.
[03:11:14.760 --> 03:11:21.640]  I could not agree more, it's ironic that the president's approval rating is rising as he
[03:11:21.640 --> 03:11:26.440]  fights day and night to build a wall on our southern border, and then you read the New
[03:11:26.440 --> 03:11:34.280]  York Times saying that the president's emergency order, which we've been in favor of for months,
[03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:39.960]  is some kind of power grab, yet when Bill Clinton initiated 17 individual emergency
[03:11:39.960 --> 03:11:45.320]  orders during his presidency, it wasn't criticized by anyone in the mainstream media.
[03:11:45.320 --> 03:11:49.440]  Will you declare an emergency so he could steal stuff from Haiti?
[03:11:49.440 --> 03:11:55.320]  Yeah, I've never gone back and looked at the actual orders, I know that in terms of modern
[03:11:55.320 --> 03:11:59.520]  day presidencies, all of our presidents have used their power.
[03:11:59.520 --> 03:12:03.960]  It's ironic that those who have vested all this power in the executive and never had
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:07.680]  a problem with it previously now say it's unconstitutional.
[03:12:07.680 --> 03:12:08.680]  It's not unconstitutional.
[03:12:08.680 --> 03:12:15.000]  Donald Trump is a leader, and when they say, oh, he's only pandering to his base, what
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:21.480]  they mean is, oh, no, he's only keeping faith with the very people that voted for him.
[03:12:21.480 --> 03:12:28.280]  Look, I am a victim of this, the same witch hunt, the same effort that is being put forward
[03:12:28.280 --> 03:12:34.680]  to take down the president in an illicit glue is the same witch hunt, which has indicted
[03:12:34.680 --> 03:12:40.960]  me, that is coming after Alex, that is running the campaign of censorship against info wars.
[03:12:40.960 --> 03:12:48.160]  It's all the same people, it's the same globalist cabal, it's the same wing of the Bush, Clinton,
[03:12:48.160 --> 03:12:50.720]  crime families working together.
[03:12:50.720 --> 03:12:56.240]  And people need to understand that we're under siege, we're under attack like never before.
[03:12:56.240 --> 03:12:59.360]  We're being attacked because we support this president.
[03:12:59.360 --> 03:13:04.040]  We're being attacked because we question the two party duopoly and where they're driving
[03:13:04.040 --> 03:13:05.040]  the country.
[03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:09.200]  We're being attacked because we keep pointing out that it was Hillary Clinton who was in
[03:13:09.200 --> 03:13:10.600]  bed with the Russians.
[03:13:10.600 --> 03:13:17.440]  It was Hillary Clinton who took 145 smackers from the Russian energy company.
[03:13:17.440 --> 03:13:22.960]  It was Hillary Clinton who used the assistance of Russian intelligence to formulate a phony
[03:13:22.960 --> 03:13:30.160]  dossier that was then used as the bogus legal rationale for spying by the deep state an
[03:13:30.160 --> 03:13:35.680]  abuse of power in which the authority and capability of the state was used to spy on
[03:13:35.680 --> 03:13:38.320]  Republican candidate for president.
[03:13:38.320 --> 03:13:41.440]  There are the crimes, there's the Russian collusion.
[03:13:41.440 --> 03:13:46.280]  And because we say that at info wars and because we've been saying it with greater vehemence
[03:13:46.280 --> 03:13:50.160]  for the last two years, we are targeted for extinction.
[03:13:50.160 --> 03:13:51.160]  Owen?
[03:13:51.160 --> 03:13:56.920]  Well, I think what has the deep state really scared is just today, President Trump has
[03:13:56.920 --> 03:14:01.000]  gone on Twitter and alluded to a treasonous coup against him.
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:02.800]  Just today, he's done that at least three times.
[03:14:02.800 --> 03:14:08.520]  So he's signaling, I gotcha, and he's letting the American people know that he's got him.
[03:14:08.520 --> 03:14:12.280]  Now, obviously, the impatient sets in and we want to see some action here, Alex, but
[03:14:12.280 --> 03:14:16.720]  I think it's obvious now more than ever that the president is well aware that there's
[03:14:16.720 --> 03:14:20.120]  a coup against him, that it's illegal and treasonous in nature.
[03:14:20.120 --> 03:14:21.120]  No, I agree.
[03:14:21.120 --> 03:14:24.320]  I'm going to let you take over, obviously, with Stewart Rhodes.
[03:14:24.320 --> 03:14:26.320]  There's a lot of great things to happen.
[03:14:26.320 --> 03:14:27.320]  I mean, that's it.
[03:14:27.320 --> 03:14:30.000]  The truth there is, we're beginning to win.
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:33.840]  We turn the tide as long as we have the initiative and take action against the globalists.
[03:14:33.840 --> 03:14:36.760]  They're very scared and that means they're going to try to start a race war.
[03:14:36.760 --> 03:14:37.760]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[03:14:37.760 --> 03:14:40.960]  We just saw that with Smollett, but everything they do is turning to crap.
[03:14:40.960 --> 03:14:41.960]  We can't be too confident.
[03:14:41.960 --> 03:14:47.840]  We ought to thank God, though, and be saying some prayers, and again, infowarstore.com.
[03:14:47.840 --> 03:14:48.840]  Great products.
[03:14:48.840 --> 03:14:49.840]  A lot of big specials.

[03:14:53.840 --> 03:14:56.000]  flavors at infowarstore.com.
[03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:57.000]  We've got the vanilla.

[03:15:23.040 --> 03:15:27.720]  I think we're a year or so away from really breaking the back of the deep state and then
[03:15:27.720 --> 03:15:31.880]  getting on the offense against them, but this is one hell of a time to be alive, so I want

[03:21:27.040 --> 03:21:32.160]  We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for your support at InfowarsStore.com. We really would not. And

[03:22:31.440 --> 03:22:37.040]  we were just going over this case that everybody kind of seems to have forgotten, myself included,
[03:22:37.040 --> 03:22:44.160]  when it comes to the Jesse Smallette thing. So a quote-unquote racist letter was sent to the show
[03:22:44.960 --> 03:22:49.440]  and Jesse Smallette tried to make a big deal out of it saying, oh, look how racist America is.
[03:22:49.440 --> 03:22:56.560]  They sent this letter. And I guess the narrative that's developing now, if you will, is that did he
[03:22:56.560 --> 03:23:01.360]  make that up too? Did he fabricate that letter to drop a bunch of attention? And then when it
[03:23:01.360 --> 03:23:06.800]  didn't get the attention that he wanted, he then fabricated this hoax, this hate crime hoax.
[03:23:06.800 --> 03:23:12.080]  Yeah, it looks like he sent the letter himself. And it's kind of similar to a firefighter who
[03:23:12.080 --> 03:23:19.120]  wants to be the hero and, you know, commits arson. And this is turning out to be Jesse from the
[03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:23.360]  just from the beginning, driving the whole train. And like he said, when it didn't get enough
[03:23:23.360 --> 03:23:29.440]  response to for him, as far as he wanted to see response, he had to go and concoct his own race
[03:23:29.440 --> 03:23:36.480]  crime. Well, and I think the interesting thing to watch now as the two Nigerians that Smallette
[03:23:36.480 --> 03:23:40.480]  allegedly paid off, it looks like they pretty much threw him under the bus. They said, yeah,
[03:23:40.480 --> 03:23:46.800]  he paid us to do it. We rehearsed the whole thing. It was all his idea because they aren't the ones
[03:23:46.800 --> 03:23:50.480]  that followed the police report. You know, they aren't the ones that are guilty of a potential
[03:23:50.480 --> 03:23:55.200]  massive crime here because they were just, I mean, essentially when it boils down to it,
[03:23:55.200 --> 03:24:00.080]  part of a street act, they were just part of some street act. They went out there with their hats
[03:24:00.080 --> 03:24:04.480]  with the rope and then they engaged the street act. It was Smallette that filed the police report.
[03:24:04.480 --> 03:24:09.760]  So the Nigerians, my guess is the police are like, look, we could bring in for this or that,
[03:24:09.760 --> 03:24:13.600]  but you could just walk right out of here. If you just tell us what happened,
[03:24:13.600 --> 03:24:17.040]  they could be accessories. But yeah, obviously, they just said, hey, we'll let you know all
[03:24:17.040 --> 03:24:22.640]  you want to know in exchange for you cutting us loose. So now when I look at this, I go next level.
[03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:29.440]  And I think, well, if Smallette, if this was part of a larger Democrat plan, a larger Democrat hoax,
[03:24:30.320 --> 03:24:34.000]  does he maybe start to sing? Now, it doesn't appear that way because
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:37.680]  his defense is going to be speaking to the police. He's not going to talk to the police anymore.
[03:24:37.680 --> 03:24:43.680]  So that to me means he maybe did perhaps do this all on his own because he's not trying to throw
[03:24:43.680 --> 03:24:49.200]  the Democrats under the bus that maybe told him to do it. But it's just unbelievable, Stuart,
[03:24:49.200 --> 03:24:54.960]  that they're able to pull off this hoax. And I'm telling you, you will be able to watch news
[03:24:54.960 --> 03:24:59.600]  probably in months, years from now, and they'll say, America's racist. Remember the Jesse Smallette
[03:24:59.600 --> 03:25:05.120]  attack? They will say that it will happen. Yeah, exactly. They'll ignore. It's just really bizarre
[03:25:05.120 --> 03:25:10.000]  how they'll ignore reality and continue on with the great lie, even after it's been exposed.
[03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:15.280]  And they do it every day. I mean, it's unbelievable. So we're actually going to open up the phone
[03:25:15.280 --> 03:25:20.000]  lines in the last two segments. Stuart Rhodes, myself, we will take your questions or calls.
[03:25:21.280 --> 03:25:30.480]  1-877-789-ALEX, 1-877-789-2539. And we'll just, you know, we've covered a lot of news today,
[03:25:30.480 --> 03:25:36.000]  the Smallette stuff, obviously the coup against Trump, national emergency. So there's all kinds
[03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:41.120]  of stuff that you can call in about today. But, you know, Stuart, obviously you have been
[03:25:41.120 --> 03:25:46.000]  been trying to put a lot of pressure on the president to act when it comes to the southern
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:51.040]  border, but also when it comes to this coup against him three times today. President Trump has made
[03:25:52.560 --> 03:25:58.400]  allusions, if you will, to the fact that there was a deep state coup against him with McCabe,
[03:25:58.400 --> 03:26:03.840]  with Rosenstein. What does that mean to you that the president is willing to signal that out kind
[03:26:03.840 --> 03:26:09.840]  of on Twitter that he knows? But as far as we can tell, there doesn't seem to be any hardcore
[03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:14.320]  action going on against it. Well, we'll see what his new attorney general does. I don't give a whole
[03:26:14.320 --> 03:26:19.520]  lot of hope for Barr, frankly, for being any better than Sessions was. But I hope he does
[03:26:20.320 --> 03:26:24.640]  do what the president tells him to do and prosecutes these people. And then be investigated
[03:26:24.640 --> 03:26:30.480]  and prosecuted, at the very least, for lying to Congress. I think McCabe lied to Congress directly,
[03:26:30.480 --> 03:26:36.160]  exactly the same thing that they're accusing Roger Stone of, actually worse. But I think,
[03:26:36.160 --> 03:26:40.800]  but he should be also looking to prosecute them for criminal offenses, including sedition
[03:26:40.800 --> 03:26:46.160]  and conspiracy to commit sedition. He should. And I mean, I think that there's a certain level
[03:26:47.600 --> 03:26:54.640]  where you kind of sit back if you're the president and you say, I don't want there to be,
[03:26:54.640 --> 03:27:00.320]  you know, some national emergency, essentially, or should I say mass panic would be the better word,
[03:27:00.960 --> 03:27:05.440]  if these people get prosecuted. I mean, we're talking like Nuremberg trial 2.0
[03:27:05.440 --> 03:27:10.640]  for the most corrupt officials in the West. I mean, out of these bureaucracies. So I mean,
[03:27:10.640 --> 03:27:14.960]  there's a certain level, I think that the president realizes some of these people are so
[03:27:14.960 --> 03:27:20.880]  brainwashed and they're so, you know, they're so energized with hate that if the president moved
[03:27:20.880 --> 03:27:26.400]  against them, they would, they would almost go into a hot civil war. Well, yeah, I think a lot
[03:27:26.400 --> 03:27:31.440]  of the rank and file, like you should call them foot soldiers on the left, are openly still calling
[03:27:31.440 --> 03:27:35.520]  for the 25th Amendment to be used. Either they don't understand the Constitution or they just don't
[03:27:35.520 --> 03:27:41.040]  care. So I think you're right. I think they'll, they'll react as if, as if the president was
[03:27:41.040 --> 03:27:46.000]  somehow doing something dictatorial or wrong by prosecuting people for committing pretty obvious
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:50.960]  offenses. So yes, I think that's the risk. But if he doesn't do that, it'll also encourage them to
[03:27:50.960 --> 03:27:55.280]  keep going. There'll be more conspiracy and the deep state will keep conspiring openly against
[03:27:55.280 --> 03:28:01.360]  him. Well, and that's my biggest fear. My biggest fear is that if President Donald Trump doesn't
[03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:06.480]  do something about these people, no one will, and they're going to continue to operate in this
[03:28:06.480 --> 03:28:12.880]  country out of control, unelected and totally illegal. And that's my biggest fear. And that's
[03:28:12.880 --> 03:28:19.600]  why I look at the president and I say, Mr. President, if you don't arrest all of these people
[03:28:19.600 --> 03:28:25.600]  that engaged in treason and sedition against your presidency and well beyond, and he knows it, and
[03:28:25.600 --> 03:28:31.120]  well beyond, then your presidency will be a failure. And I know you've done so much for the economy.
[03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:34.160]  I know you've done so much to fight political correctness. I know you've done so much to fight
[03:28:34.160 --> 03:28:39.760]  the fake news. Your presidency has been incredible. But if you do not take down the deep state, if you
[03:28:39.760 --> 03:28:46.080]  do not drain that swamp, it will rise up again. And everything you did will be null and void.
[03:28:46.080 --> 03:28:51.760]  We have to drain the swamp of all of these corrupt officials that engaged in open sedition
[03:28:51.760 --> 03:28:57.120]  against the United States. Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse. Relief for

[03:31:53.920 --> 03:31:58.480]  You know the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for
[03:31:58.480 --> 03:32:02.960]  my children someday. That's why I need to make them strong now. Now I can be there for my children.
[03:32:02.960 --> 03:32:08.080]  Now I can make them strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can teach them what I've learned,
[03:32:08.080 --> 03:32:11.680]  but not once I'm gone. You think of this digital age, your words going forever, but now they're
[03:32:11.680 --> 03:32:16.800]  even better, getting rid of what you said they were before. It's so much easier to burn video or
[03:32:16.800 --> 03:32:22.720]  text or languages now that we have high tech book burning, isn't it? But I have joined my will to
[03:32:22.720 --> 03:32:27.600]  the resistance. I can't be destroyed now. As long as I realize I've done right and as long as the
[03:32:27.600 --> 03:32:32.800]  people know the truth and you can't be destroyed either. As long as you bind yourself to something
[03:32:32.800 --> 03:32:37.600]  and commit to it and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then takes place,
[03:32:37.600 --> 03:32:42.720]  the transcend space and time. When you commit the award of mouth or to pray for us or to spread
[03:32:42.720 --> 03:32:48.480]  our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing. So please now commit to support
[03:32:48.480 --> 03:33:03.520]  InfoWars however you can and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[03:33:19.360 --> 03:33:27.680]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:27.680 --> 03:33:35.840]  And now your host, Owen Troyer. We are going to take your phone calls.
[03:33:37.360 --> 03:33:42.800]  Stuart Rhodes from oathkeepers.org is in studio with me, breaking it all down.
[03:33:42.800 --> 03:33:48.720]  Let's go right out to the phone lines to Matt calling in from New Hampshire wants to talk about
[03:33:48.720 --> 03:33:56.400]  the deep state. Go ahead, Matt. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Stuart, it's Matt up here in New
[03:33:56.400 --> 03:34:04.480]  Hampshire. I met up with you or I saw you in November. I am a civilian member of oathkeepers
[03:34:04.480 --> 03:34:13.360]  and also I am a supporter of InfoWarsStore.com. I think that we can all agree that there is
[03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:21.920]  actually a nonviolent civil war in action right now. I think that we can agree that
[03:34:22.640 --> 03:34:33.040]  they are not going to stop. That being said, we keep on going after and exposing them,
[03:34:33.040 --> 03:34:40.720]  but I think that there is a point where exposing in action also needs to be taken
[03:34:40.720 --> 03:34:49.040]  nonviolently. Hypothetically, if we took 0.0325 percent of the population
[03:34:50.400 --> 03:34:56.880]  and took the kingpins from the head of these agencies, these people that have infiltrated
[03:34:56.880 --> 03:35:04.400]  the media, that have infiltrated the government agencies, brought them together, had public
[03:35:04.400 --> 03:35:16.320]  brain juries and tried them either tribunally or under a civil fashion, I think that that would
[03:35:16.320 --> 03:35:20.720]  actually change our whole paradigm. Well, that's literally what Stuart Rhodes was saying in the
[03:35:20.720 --> 03:35:25.120]  break, but I got to say what's on everyone's mind right now. Matt, if that is your natural voice,
[03:35:25.120 --> 03:35:32.240]  you are the closest thing to Alex Jones I've ever heard. And so, wow, that is like you sound like
[03:35:32.240 --> 03:35:41.920]  Alex on air right now. That's pretty funny. But getting back to your point, Stuart, it's just
[03:35:41.920 --> 03:35:46.560]  like you said. There has to be a grand jury. There has to be action. But here's an example,
[03:35:46.560 --> 03:35:51.040]  Matt, because a lot of people, when they think action, everybody wants to have a big impact.
[03:35:51.040 --> 03:35:54.320]  Everybody wants to get seen in a million views. Everybody thinks that there's got to be a big
[03:35:54.320 --> 03:36:00.560]  impact. Even a small impact is big. I mean, even the smallest impact can be big. For example,
[03:36:01.280 --> 03:36:06.880]  when I get off air today, I'm going to put on my Trump hat and I'm going to go down to the
[03:36:06.880 --> 03:36:11.760]  state capitol here in Austin, Texas. And I'm going to, well, I used to be able to do a live video.
[03:36:11.760 --> 03:36:16.160]  Now I'm totally, so I'm banned off social media from, I can't go live on the war room accounts on
[03:36:16.160 --> 03:36:20.240]  Facebook or Twitter or on YouTube. So I'm not allowed to go to a live stream now. So I'm going
[03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:24.160]  to have to Skype into the war room later, but I'm going to go out. I'm going to put my Trump hat on,
[03:36:24.160 --> 03:36:27.040]  and I'm just going to be talking about all the great stuff President Trump has done.
[03:36:27.040 --> 03:36:31.040]  And maybe there's one person that walks by that's neutral that says, wow, I didn't realize that. I'm
[03:36:31.040 --> 03:36:34.080]  going to go look that up. And then all of a sudden you just got another Trump supporter. Maybe you
[03:36:34.080 --> 03:36:38.240]  go out there and some deranged leftist comes and smacks your hat off. And then you got a viral
[03:36:38.240 --> 03:36:43.760]  video. One person sees that and says, boy, these people are really out of control. I don't want
[03:36:43.760 --> 03:36:49.200]  to vote for that to get in power. Maybe you just got one vote. So even a little thing to me,
[03:36:49.200 --> 03:36:53.440]  Stuart, can have a big impact. I mean, did you ever think oath keepers could be as big and
[03:36:53.440 --> 03:36:57.520]  effective as it is today? Well, yeah, you never know what your outcome is going to be. It's what
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:37:03.040]  you just have to do is what's right, what spirit tells you to do is right. But I think President
[03:37:03.040 --> 03:37:08.080]  Trump does need to be prosecuting these people. We were talking on the break about a possibility
[03:37:08.080 --> 03:37:13.440]  of him finding a special prosecutor for this. I recommend Cindy Powell, the former, the veteran
[03:37:13.440 --> 03:37:18.320]  federal prosecutor, who has a pretty good book out all about this, this situation. It's called
[03:37:18.320 --> 03:37:23.840]  License to Lie, all about the corruption inside the DOD. But he should appoint a special prosecutor
[03:37:23.840 --> 03:37:28.720]  on his side to go look into and investigate all of this, this conspiracy and collusion that's
[03:37:28.720 --> 03:37:35.200]  going on within the left, and then prosecute them. Yeah, they need a grand jury indictment
[03:37:35.200 --> 03:37:39.040]  against these people. Yeah. And I mean, a lot of people think that maybe that is going on
[03:37:39.040 --> 03:37:42.400]  behind the scenes. Thank you so much for the call, man. Only it were true. Yeah, well,
[03:37:42.400 --> 03:37:48.000]  let's now go to Jim calling in from Georgia. Go ahead, Jim.
[03:37:49.680 --> 03:37:56.880]  Owen and Stuart, it's good to talk to you again. How are you guys? Is this Justice Militia?
[03:37:57.600 --> 03:38:05.520]  Yes, sir, it is. Good to hear from you. Thank you very much. I've been a member of Oath Keepers and
[03:38:05.520 --> 03:38:13.440]  I'd like to be a last caller, an associate member of Oath Keepers since about 2011, somewhere in
[03:38:13.440 --> 03:38:24.720]  there. I ran into you through Info Wars. That's where I heard you first. I've fell in love with
[03:38:24.720 --> 03:38:30.640]  you ever since. We've talked a little bit back and forth on Twitter, but I'm sure thousands
[03:38:30.640 --> 03:38:38.320]  of thousands of people have no way to remember. But I really appreciate everything you do, and I
[03:38:38.320 --> 03:38:49.520]  would say Stuart Rose for president, absolutely. You don't think? No, thank you. I got my role
[03:38:49.520 --> 03:38:54.960]  to play and other guys have their role to play. But you know, Jim, since you said that, though,
[03:38:54.960 --> 03:38:59.840]  I kind of want to just paint an analogy here, a picture that kind of comes to my mind when
[03:38:59.840 --> 03:39:07.920]  you talk about this. It's like just imagine a dark map of America, okay? And then imagine
[03:39:07.920 --> 03:39:13.200]  that there's going to be lights on the map that represent resistance movements just fighting tyranny,
[03:39:13.200 --> 03:39:16.880]  just fighting for freedom, fighting for independence, fighting for truth, fighting for the Republic.
[03:39:17.440 --> 03:39:22.560]  And you've got all of these different beacons of light sprouting up all over the United States.
[03:39:22.560 --> 03:39:27.440]  But there's one that's clearly the brightest, clearly the biggest, and is clearly attracting
[03:39:27.440 --> 03:39:32.880]  the most attention. That's right here at Info Wars. That's what this is. That's why we have
[03:39:32.880 --> 03:39:37.200]  Stuart Rhodes on, so that other people can find Stuart Rhodes and then move to his beacon of light
[03:39:37.200 --> 03:39:41.600]  and freedom. That's why we have all of these other leaders on, so that we can amplify their lights
[03:39:41.600 --> 03:39:46.000]  and attract more people to their freedom movements. So, but that's also why they attack
[03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:54.000]  Info Wars and want to shut down. Anything else, Jim? You're absolutely right. And I just, I appreciate
[03:39:54.000 --> 03:40:04.240]  everything you do. We are a group of 10 patriots, the Justice Militia, M-U-L-I-S-H-A. We do all kind
[03:40:04.240 --> 03:40:13.440]  of things from crazy, silly stuff on YouTube, but we are a band of brothers that live close to one
[03:40:13.440 --> 03:40:19.680]  another, go camping, we make plans, you know, all that stuff. Well, and that's part of it too,
[03:40:19.680 --> 03:40:23.680]  is, you know, meet fellow patriots and create kinship with them and their families. Thanks for
[03:40:23.680 --> 03:40:28.080]  the call, Jim. Let's jump over to George in New Mexico, wants to talk about the national emergency
[03:40:28.080 --> 03:40:34.800]  at the southern border. Go ahead, George. Hey, ONA Stuart. Thanks for taking my call. I had a question.
[03:40:34.800 --> 03:40:42.560]  I was watching the news that I'm not here locally, and our local representative of Northern New
[03:40:42.560 --> 03:40:49.120]  Mexico, Ben Ray Han Jr., was making a claim that President Trump didn't have the authority to
[03:40:49.120 --> 03:40:57.280]  appropriate the funds through the national fee by deeming it unconstitutional because Congress
[03:40:57.280 --> 03:41:03.280]  had already voted for the fiscal year of where those funds were going to go to. And I mean,
[03:41:03.280 --> 03:41:11.600]  obviously, he's a, you know, he's a heavy liberal, you know, Democrat pushing the swamp agenda in
[03:41:11.600 --> 03:41:16.080]  Santa Fe up here. Well, they might be able to twist and turn a couple things here and there and say,
[03:41:16.080 --> 03:41:20.320]  oh, that's not constitutional or some funding deal. But overall, I mean, Stuart, talk about this.
[03:41:20.320 --> 03:41:24.240]  I mean, overall, the Trump, it's not, it's not a constitutional, oh, is it constitutional,
[03:41:24.240 --> 03:41:29.520]  is it unconstitutional? No, the president has a duty, a sworn oath to protect the southern border.
[03:41:29.520 --> 03:41:34.720]  Well, so the problem with him putting it, this is a problem with him using the National
[03:41:34.720 --> 03:41:42.160]  Emergencies Act from 1976 as his basis and saying, under that act, I can move funding around.
[03:41:42.160 --> 03:41:47.040]  He should just make it, and this is the problem is even Rand Paul is now saying what he's doing
[03:41:47.040 --> 03:41:51.200]  unconstitutional, he's circumventing the legislative process, you know, Congress has
[03:41:51.200 --> 03:41:54.960]  the power, the purse, et cetera. And that's the problem with him putting it in that civilian
[03:41:54.960 --> 03:42:01.200]  context box of this is about funding. What he should say is just forget all about that as Commander
[03:42:01.200 --> 03:42:05.520]  in Chief, I'm going to defend the country against an invasion period. That's what he should do.
[03:42:05.520 --> 03:42:10.800]  He should still still do that. He can still fix this. But he has put himself in that box
[03:42:10.800 --> 03:42:17.360]  because of the way he has done this declaration and confining it to that narrow sphere of
[03:42:17.360 --> 03:42:23.120]  I'm here to enforce laws and build the wall for law enforcement. He needs to make it all about
[03:42:23.120 --> 03:42:27.680]  the military. All right. Thank you so much for the call, George. We've got one more segment
[03:42:27.680 --> 03:42:31.600]  of the Alex Jones show on the other side with Stuart Rhodes and myself. We're going to take
[03:42:31.600 --> 03:42:36.560]  some of your calls. And then of course, the war room kicks off every day, every weekday,

[03:42:46.560 --> 03:42:48.960]  One more segment, though, left of the Alex Jones show. Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:48.960 --> 03:43:01.440]  There is no Alex.

[03:47:16.800 --> 03:47:27.200]  Save it from tyranny and socialism. That's what we're about here. And part of that battle is just
[03:47:28.320 --> 03:47:36.320]  telling the truth. Seems to be the way that tyrants always get in power through lies and media propaganda.
[03:47:36.320 --> 03:47:40.080]  So that's what we're fighting here at Infowars. All right, final segment of the Alex Jones show,
[03:47:40.080 --> 03:47:44.480]  Stuart Rhodes from oathkeepers.org is in studio with me. We've got callers lined up.
[03:47:44.480 --> 03:47:47.120]  Let's start with Tom in Texas. Go ahead, Tom.
[03:47:49.040 --> 03:47:55.840]  Hey guys, thanks for taking my call. You know, if the left thinks a MAGA hat is so offensive,
[03:47:55.840 --> 03:48:00.640]  I think there's four words that are even more powerful that we've kind of not forgotten about,
[03:48:00.640 --> 03:48:05.360]  but moved away from. And that's come and take it. And that just doesn't mean a gun. That means
[03:48:05.360 --> 03:48:10.880]  any freedom they're trying to take from us. We as conservatives, Christians, whatever you want to
[03:48:10.880 --> 03:48:16.400]  may call it. But as you said earlier in the show, I would take the high road a lot of times when
[03:48:16.400 --> 03:48:24.960]  they go low. How far are we willing to let them take and push us till we stand up for ourselves?
[03:48:24.960 --> 03:48:29.840]  Well, that's a line in the sand and an answer to a question I hope I never have to find out,
[03:48:29.840 --> 03:48:35.600]  to be honest with you, Tom. But I don't know what the deal is here, Stuart. We're getting Alex Jones
[03:48:35.600 --> 03:48:41.760]  like sounding callers every segment. I mean, this is unbelievable. Nobody's, he's absolutely right,
[03:48:41.760 --> 03:48:47.920]  though. Hey, the Covington kids, they stood their ground to stand there. Don't let them rattle you,
[03:48:47.920 --> 03:48:53.280]  but also don't apologize for being what you are and who you are. And don't give ground, stand your
[03:48:53.280 --> 03:49:00.240]  ground. Anything else, Tom? Well, that's, yeah, that's what I'm saying is I love the show,
[03:49:00.240 --> 03:49:07.120]  Proud Info War supporter. I call in regular, I buy regular, support the general Jones as I call
[03:49:07.120 --> 03:49:14.800]  him. I don't call him Alex because that's to me a little disrespectful, but I wish more people would
[03:49:15.760 --> 03:49:22.720]  turn on to what y'all are preaching. Just last night at my church, I had a friend of mine that
[03:49:22.720 --> 03:49:27.040]  I go up there with. I turn him on to you guys. He downloaded the app right there as I was
[03:49:27.040 --> 03:49:31.280]  standing and talking to him. And that's total victory right there. That's, that's total victory.
[03:49:31.280 --> 03:49:36.320]  The word the better off will be is all I'm saying. No, exactly, exactly. And, you know,
[03:49:36.320 --> 03:49:41.280]  the funny thing is too, is, you know, at look, I think even, even the audience, I mean, everyone
[03:49:41.280 --> 03:49:45.760]  would agree, Alex, the guy needs a vacation. Okay. I mean, the guy desperately needs to be
[03:49:45.760 --> 03:49:51.520]  able to mentally check out and just, just get, just, just get away from it, just live life,
[03:49:51.520 --> 03:49:55.920]  a human, try to have a regular life for a day or two. He just can't do it. And he, and that's why
[03:49:55.920 --> 03:50:01.520]  he calls in every day. I mean, that's just his level of dedication. And so the audience sees
[03:50:01.520 --> 03:50:06.320]  that. And Tom, we thank you so much for your supported info or store.com. Let's go to extra,
[03:50:06.320 --> 03:50:13.040]  extra, extra in Washington. Go ahead, extra. Hey, how's it going? Good. Thanks for calling.
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:19.280]  Yeah, that's exactly what the names for is extra, extra read all about it. You are exactly spot on.
[03:50:19.280 --> 03:50:24.000]  And I just wanted to call and warn everyone that Donald Trump is not who we think he is.
[03:50:24.000 --> 03:50:29.760]  He is not there as our beach head or a part of the truth movement. He is merely another facet
[03:50:29.760 --> 03:50:37.440]  of the new world order for us to be personified into his image, to be sacrificed as an effigy.
[03:50:37.440 --> 03:50:43.600]  Donald Trump is not on our side. If you want to know more, watch Trump card, the final hand
[03:50:43.600 --> 03:50:47.360]  documentary series I'm putting together. Donald Trump is not our man.
[03:50:47.840 --> 03:50:52.480]  So what, okay, okay. So, so look, I'm, I'm, I'm fine to hear your points out. We're not in a
[03:50:52.480 --> 03:50:56.560]  Trump call here, but what do you make of the record economic growth? What do you make of him
[03:50:56.560 --> 03:51:01.680]  fighting the fake news media? What do you make of the entire power establishment being out
[03:51:01.680 --> 03:51:07.760]  against him? You think it's all one big act? Listen, it is. And I'll explain why. Like I said,
[03:51:07.760 --> 03:51:13.680]  Donald Trump is the truth movement personified to be an effigy, to be sacrificed. So when we're
[03:51:13.680 --> 03:51:18.960]  purged, no one's going to care because everyone hates Donald Trump. And if we're throwing under
[03:51:18.960 --> 03:51:24.320]  his bus, no one's going to care. Now, but here's where I disagree with you extra. The Trump movement,
[03:51:25.680 --> 03:51:31.600]  yes, is the Trump movement, but it's beyond Donald Trump. I mean, like I said, I'm in no
[03:51:31.600 --> 03:51:35.760]  Trump cult. I don't care that you come on the air and say that. And I would, I think that most
[03:51:35.760 --> 03:51:40.320]  people in Trump's base would, as soon as they see him go sideways with abandon ship, obviously not
[03:51:40.320 --> 03:51:44.720]  all of them. I just look, I've weighed the options of what you're talking about. I just see that
[03:51:44.720 --> 03:51:49.440]  there's way, there's way too much evidence against it for me to feel that he's, he's totally about
[03:51:49.440 --> 03:51:53.680]  to throw us out of the bus. Stuart, what do you think you're falling for? Well, I think, you know,
[03:51:53.680 --> 03:51:59.680]  Trump is writing a tidal wave tsunami that would already existed. And that's exactly why he's an
[03:51:59.680 --> 03:52:05.440]  office. But like you said, if he goes sideways, for example, if he signs a national, you know,
[03:52:05.440 --> 03:52:12.240]  red flag gun confiscation bill, his goose is cooked. So he's only being supported on that
[03:52:12.240 --> 03:52:16.800]  tidal wave. So long as he's, he's going the right direction. And if he doesn't, then we'll pull the
[03:52:16.800 --> 03:52:22.000]  plug on him ourselves. So I don't think we're going to, you know, rise and fall only on Donald
[03:52:22.000 --> 03:52:28.000]  Trump. I think it's possibly true that, like I said earlier, he's like, it looks like 1984,
[03:52:28.000 --> 03:52:32.640]  you know, Goldstein is the, the figure they're, they're taught to hate. And the left is certainly
[03:52:32.640 --> 03:52:38.480]  being conditioned to hate Donald Trump. But the real targets are still always anybody who's a,
[03:52:38.480 --> 03:52:42.720]  you know, it's a constitutionalist, you know, a civic nationalist, anybody who believes in
[03:52:42.720 --> 03:52:46.560]  the Constitution and believes in Western civilization is going to be hated. He's a focal
[03:52:46.560 --> 03:52:50.640]  point right now. Well, thank you for the call. Actually, again, I mean, I have no problem hearing
[03:52:50.640 --> 03:52:55.440]  people's points, you know, anti Trump or whatever, I'm not in a Trump call. Honestly, though, for me,
[03:52:55.440 --> 03:52:59.920]  it's more than anything, Stuart. It's like just a gut instinct to go with Trump overall. That
[03:52:59.920 --> 03:53:04.160]  doesn't mean he's perfect. That doesn't mean he's going to deliver totally Americana. That means
[03:53:04.160 --> 03:53:09.840]  he's been so different than everything we've had before him that just that change of the guard,
[03:53:09.840 --> 03:53:14.960]  just that change of momentum, that change of mentality is a victory. So we'll see ultimately,
[03:53:14.960 --> 03:53:20.240]  I mean, I've always said this, we'll see ultimately what happens when Trump is out of office. We will
[03:53:20.240 --> 03:53:25.760]  see. And to me, that's when you can make your final decision on what Trump was or what he wasn't.
[03:53:25.760 --> 03:53:31.040]  Right now, he's done so much more good than bad. I don't even think that's a debate, even if you
[03:53:31.040 --> 03:53:36.240]  think he could do better. Thanks for the call, though. Let's now go to Gene in Colorado. Go ahead,
[03:53:36.240 --> 03:53:41.760]  Gene. Am I on the air? No, I just said go ahead, Gene, because I felt like it.
[03:53:45.760 --> 03:53:50.160]  Well, for starters, I just wanted to say thank you very much for everything going on.
[03:53:50.160 --> 03:53:56.080]  You got me started. I started watching back in 2016, back when, you know, the election was going
[03:53:56.080 --> 03:54:05.360]  on. Was it the AIDS Skrillex video? It was back when I was a, he was a junior and he was on,
[03:54:05.360 --> 03:54:12.240]  you guys were still able to be on YouTube at the time, I believe. And I had watched a video of you
[03:54:12.240 --> 03:54:18.960]  going around telling different people about Trump and those good things. And I remember going in my
[03:54:19.520 --> 03:54:25.120]  history class at the time and just completely destroying people with facts that you had given
[03:54:25.120 --> 03:54:29.760]  me and proving these facts to them. I remember my history teacher didn't like me very much.
[03:54:31.520 --> 03:54:38.480]  Really, I wanted to ask you about the new small, with the new small person that just came on in
[03:54:38.480 --> 03:54:45.520]  his claiming that he got all these racial scores going on. And what do you think that we as listeners
[03:54:45.520 --> 03:54:53.360]  could maybe do to help, you know, prove that this guy is wrong and spread the word and maybe go,
[03:54:53.360 --> 03:54:56.800]  I know that you guys would say. Well, here's the thing. I don't even think that's, I don't even,
[03:54:56.800 --> 03:55:01.200]  honestly, Gene, I don't even think that's the issue anymore because he's already been proven totally
[03:55:01.200 --> 03:55:06.720]  wrong. I mean, when you have CNN trying to break the news that it was a whole hoax, then you know
[03:55:06.720 --> 03:55:11.040]  it's done. I mean, you know that the whole thing is falling apart. It's a dumpster fire. So that'll
[03:55:11.040 --> 03:55:14.960]  take care of itself. I think the real question that we have to ask ourselves or the real issue is
[03:55:14.960 --> 03:55:23.680]  how do we get through to the public that this was something that was orchestrated in mastermind
[03:55:24.240 --> 03:55:29.280]  by the left to destroy America, to attack Trump, to lie about Trump supporters,
[03:55:29.280 --> 03:55:33.600]  something that they've been doing for two and a half, three, four years. So I think that's the
[03:55:33.600 --> 03:55:41.520]  real challenge is to figure out how can we really permeate the American mindset to understand
[03:55:41.520 --> 03:55:46.800]  what the left is doing actively right now, staging hoax crimes, staging entire false
[03:55:46.800 --> 03:55:51.040]  narratives like Russian collusion. And so like, for example, and I'm going to try to get this
[03:55:51.040 --> 03:55:57.920]  guest on the war room, so they make a huge deal out of Jesse Smallette and this fake hate crime,
[03:55:57.920 --> 03:56:02.960]  totally made up. Why? Oh, because he's, he's black and he's gay. So it's like, oh my gosh,
[03:56:02.960 --> 03:56:10.000]  let's virtue signal doubly as hard for this poor millionaire actress. Oh, he's so, it's so tough
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:15.680]  for him. And he fakes the whole thing. And it's barely even a blip on the radar. There's an individual
[03:56:16.240 --> 03:56:20.640]  who runs MAGA One radio. He's been on air with us before. He ran for Congress. His name is Peter
[03:56:20.640 --> 03:56:28.000]  Boykin. He's, he's gay. He went out one night with his husband and his Trump hat and got assaulted.
[03:56:28.000 --> 03:56:32.400]  Now we covered the story at Info Wars. I had him on as a guest. Was that a big news story,
[03:56:32.400 --> 03:56:37.200]  Stuart? Had you ever heard of Peter Boykin? Nope, didn't know he was. So it just shows you
[03:56:37.200 --> 03:56:44.000]  how they selectively decide what story becomes big news and what story doesn't. There was another
[03:56:44.000 --> 03:56:50.080]  shooting in California last week. A black man is sitting in his car sleeping. Six officers come
[03:56:50.080 --> 03:56:55.120]  up and shoot him dead. Did that make mainstream news? Did they cry racism over that story?
[03:56:55.120 --> 03:57:00.720]  Did you hear about that, Stuart? It just shows you the power of the mainstream media to control
[03:57:00.720 --> 03:57:06.240]  the narrative. So that's how we fight back against it. Just exposing how the mainstream media controls
[03:57:06.240 --> 03:57:10.080]  the narrative and why they want to censor us at Info Wars because we fight back against it.
[03:57:10.080 --> 03:57:14.000]  Thanks so much for the call, Gene. 30 seconds left. Stuart Rhodes, your final comment.
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:17.840]  Well, yeah. I mean, anytime a conservative is attacked by the left, whether they're white or
[03:57:17.840 --> 03:57:22.480]  black, it's ignored, especially if they're a minority or he's said a gay Trump supporter.
[03:57:22.480 --> 03:57:26.080]  But yet on the other side, they'll make up fake attacks. This is the longest,
[03:57:26.080 --> 03:57:30.000]  this is the latest example of a long string of fake attacks. And there's lit. I mean,
[03:57:30.000 --> 03:57:33.760]  you showed me one of the lists that you found. I mean, there's dozens of times, folks. So it's
[03:57:33.760 --> 03:57:38.320]  the left is totally unhinged out of control, but they're exposing themselves. And so that's
[03:57:38.320 --> 03:57:42.000]  the good news. The war room starts at info wars.com slash show you stay classy.
