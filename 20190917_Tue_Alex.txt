[00:00.000 --> 00:20.540]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:20.540 --> 00:23.940]  It's Tuesday, September 17th, 2019.
[00:23.940 --> 00:27.820]  I'm your host Alex Jones, I'll be co-hosting with Owen Schreuer today.
[00:27.820 --> 00:32.120]  I'm in Los Angeles to do some big podcast, more on that later.
[00:32.120 --> 00:34.520]  Now I say this at the start of every broadcast, there's a quickening.
[00:34.520 --> 00:37.920]  A lot of things are coming together right now, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:37.920 --> 00:43.960]  But particularly today, a lot of really incredibly dangerous things are unfolding and also a
[00:43.960 --> 00:46.640]  lot of really, really exciting good things are unfolding.
[00:46.640 --> 00:51.600]  So coming up on the broadcast today, Trump has now come out and said he's going to be
[00:51.600 --> 00:56.080]  going after the censors, they're preparing at the Justice Department, they're already
[00:56.080 --> 00:59.760]  coordinating with all 50 states to do it, very exciting.
[00:59.760 --> 01:03.600]  He's talking about the bullying culture of the left and standing up to them and what
[01:03.600 --> 01:07.140]  they've done to Kavanaugh and the fact that the New York Times has been caught in giant
[01:07.140 --> 01:09.960]  hoax and the House of Cards is coming down.
[01:09.960 --> 01:15.920]  Now we have the Pentagon coming out saying they have proof that the Iranians out of Western
[01:15.920 --> 01:21.040]  Iran, the border with Iraq, fired cruise missiles, not drones, those were refineries.
[01:21.040 --> 01:24.120]  I told you that yesterday, I said, folks, I think it's cruise missiles, I said in the
[01:24.120 --> 01:25.120]  morning.
[01:25.120 --> 01:27.040]  I was at this point or not doing that.
[01:27.040 --> 01:31.880]  The rebels took the blame as a proxy army for Iran and I thought to a lot of smart people
[01:31.880 --> 01:37.320]  and they concur, who didn't even hear my show yesterday, that this is like 1979, the deep
[01:37.320 --> 01:41.200]  states trying to embarrass Trump and hurt the U.S. economy.
[01:41.200 --> 01:45.280]  So I don't want to have war with Iran, but they are seizing ships and they probably did
[01:45.280 --> 01:50.480]  launch these attacks because they know they can deny it, then sucker Trump in and the deep
[01:50.480 --> 01:56.360]  states going to sabotage Trump just like they did in 1979 with Jimmy Carter and the Iranians,
[01:56.360 --> 02:00.480]  the very same crew, and just like they did in the early 1960s with the Bay of Pigs, the
[02:00.480 --> 02:02.480]  CIA did to Kennedy.
[02:02.480 --> 02:06.400]  So they do these tricks over and over again and we were the first to break that information
[02:06.400 --> 02:07.400]  down.
[02:07.400 --> 02:09.280]  Now more and more people are pointing at that as well.
[02:09.280 --> 02:11.480]  We're going to be covering all of that today.
[02:11.480 --> 02:15.800]  Also David Knight knocked it out of the park with a report he did on a secret U.S. government
[02:15.800 --> 02:18.280]  plan to survive the end of the world.
[02:18.280 --> 02:20.880]  Democrats coming up middle of the next hour.
[02:20.880 --> 02:24.720]  There's going to be so much more today, but first you're going to see congressional hearings
[02:24.720 --> 02:30.240]  and all the documentation of the Democrats directing the plan to censor conservatives
[02:30.240 --> 02:32.120]  that they announced two years ago.
[02:32.120 --> 02:33.920]  None of this has been covered in the news.
[02:33.920 --> 02:37.080]  They think we're so dumb they admit they're running the censorship in Congress, then go
[02:37.080 --> 02:41.920]  on TV and deny their censoring and meddling in the 2018 and 2000 election that's coming
[02:41.920 --> 02:42.920]  up.
[02:42.920 --> 02:45.720]  So that special report is coming up right after this break.
[02:45.720 --> 02:50.800]  We know the globalist plan, we can defeat them if we take action and just don't accept
[02:50.800 --> 02:52.880]  being dumbed down and being a slave.
[02:52.880 --> 02:58.480]  We're covering it all right now at band.video, infowords.com, port slash show, and of course
[02:58.480 --> 03:01.240]  on the satellite, on the AM and FM, on the global shortwave.
[03:01.240 --> 03:04.480]  And however you're listening, the only way we expand and defeat the globalist is you
[03:04.480 --> 03:07.280]  participating and spreading the word, which I know you're doing.
[03:07.280 --> 03:10.800]  That's why we're overriding big tech, the chai comms and the globalists and they can't
[03:10.800 --> 03:11.800]  stand it.
[03:11.800 --> 03:14.920]  I'll assure you it'll be co-hosting today in between these powerful reports with breaking
[03:14.920 --> 03:15.920]  live news and more.
[03:15.920 --> 03:20.360]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break, infowords.com, newswords.com,
[03:20.360 --> 03:22.360]  tomorrow's news today.
[03:22.360 --> 03:28.880]  That's right, so Alex Jones will be right back, ladies and gentlemen, as I'm thinking
[03:28.880 --> 03:30.720]  this morning and praying.
[03:30.720 --> 03:31.720]  What's the big news?
[03:31.720 --> 03:32.720]  What am I going to get into?
[03:32.720 --> 03:38.400]  And then it was incredible when I got in and I saw all the reports that Alex had filed
[03:38.400 --> 03:40.720]  and the topics that he was going to file.
[03:40.720 --> 03:44.040]  Again, it's like we're on the same wavelength.
[03:44.040 --> 03:45.840]  What are the big issues we're facing?
[03:45.840 --> 03:51.440]  A potential escalation of war worldwide with the situation in China and Hong Kong, with
[03:51.440 --> 03:57.400]  the situation in India, with Pakistan, and with the situation now in the Middle East,
[03:57.400 --> 04:01.080]  with Saudi Arabia, Iran, Israel, and the rest.
[04:01.080 --> 04:04.000]  You've got the AI takeover.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.200]  What does that mean when the AI gets fully rolled out?
[04:07.200 --> 04:11.880]  Alex Jones is going to be reporting on that, knowing how serious these escalations could
[04:11.880 --> 04:12.880]  be.
[04:12.880 --> 04:16.600]  What are we doing to plan for total global catastrophe?
[04:16.600 --> 04:18.520]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[04:18.520 --> 04:24.080]  How about the fact that the Democrats right now are openly calling to confiscate your
[04:24.080 --> 04:25.960]  firearms?
[04:25.960 --> 04:31.080]  These are all huge news stories that are developing right now.
[04:31.080 --> 04:35.040]  So we're going to break all that down and then lay the groundwork for the next slate
[04:35.040 --> 04:40.760]  of big news stories to come, which will be hopefully the collapse of the deep state.
[04:40.760 --> 04:43.640]  But it all comes up today on the Alex Jones show.
[04:43.640 --> 04:48.920]  Owen Shroyer sitting in studio, Alex Jones on the road will be back on the other side
[04:48.920 --> 04:50.440]  of this short break.
[04:50.440 --> 04:52.440]  Don't forget about infowarstore.com.
[04:52.440 --> 04:56.440]  Don't forget about infowarstore.com slash show and now band.video.
[04:56.440 --> 05:03.120]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[05:03.120 --> 05:07.600]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename
[05:07.600 --> 05:08.600]  it.
[05:08.600 --> 05:10.160]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[05:10.160 --> 05:14.600]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[05:14.600 --> 05:19.920]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things,
[05:19.920 --> 05:24.240]  supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps
[05:24.240 --> 05:27.960]  produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, it goes on
[05:27.960 --> 05:28.960]  and on.
[05:28.960 --> 05:32.800]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[05:32.800 --> 05:36.840]  weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[05:36.840 --> 05:39.240]  Bottom line folks, you need Ultra 12.
[05:39.240 --> 05:45.400]  It helps fund the infowar towards a 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[05:45.400 --> 05:51.240]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[05:51.240 --> 05:58.760]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at infowarslive.com.
[05:58.760 --> 06:20.520]  Our species is facing the greatest challenge in our history on this planet.
[06:20.520 --> 06:26.280]  There is a technological revolution being carried out by the technocrats as they define
[06:26.280 --> 06:31.560]  themselves that is seeking to build a post-human world.
[06:31.560 --> 06:37.080]  Way back in 2013, the dark side of Ray Kurzweil's transhumanist utopia, he wrote in his book
[06:37.080 --> 06:43.520]  quote, humans who do not utilize such implants are unable to meaningfully participate in dialogues
[06:43.520 --> 06:45.000]  with those who do.
[06:45.000 --> 06:51.560]  The only way to conquer humanity is to destroy humanity, that's how they supposedly declare
[06:51.560 --> 07:01.480]  victory to their AI god, that promises them immortality if they only cast off their mortal
[07:01.480 --> 07:02.800]  coil.
[07:02.800 --> 07:08.640]  And he also in fact quoted the unibomber in his own book, he said quote, due to improved
[07:08.640 --> 07:13.040]  techniques, the elite will have greater control over the masses and because human work will
[07:13.040 --> 07:18.120]  no longer be necessary, the masses will be superfluous, useless burden on the system.
[07:18.120 --> 07:23.960]  Because the elite is ruthless, they may simply decide to exterminate the mass of humanity.
[07:23.960 --> 07:29.600]  When I was becoming politically aware 30 years ago, the statements by the establishment
[07:29.600 --> 07:34.800]  calling for this nightmare plan were only in white papers and academic treatises.
[07:34.800 --> 07:41.880]  But in 2019, it's now mainstream news being promoted to us like it's mother's milk.
[07:41.880 --> 07:46.640]  The end of humanity is a great thing, we're a parasite, we're bad, in fact, let's keep
[07:46.640 --> 07:51.000]  babies alive after they're born and harvest those little suckers organs, let's kill
[07:51.000 --> 07:57.400]  old people, let's just embrace pure evil so that when they come for us, when they come
[07:57.400 --> 08:00.800]  for you, there'll be no one left.
[08:00.800 --> 08:06.320]  Our humanity is being stripped from us and that's my main sin, that's why I am the most
[08:06.320 --> 08:15.000]  demonized, most lied about, most banned person in the world because I stand for a human future.
[08:15.000 --> 08:21.400]  I want to lay out here the next 15 minutes or so what's happened in the last three years
[08:21.400 --> 08:27.200]  to infowars of myself because it's a model for you and your family.
[08:27.200 --> 08:32.480]  Now I said they're setting me up as a test case three years ago and a couple years later
[08:32.480 --> 08:37.480]  they indeed banned me on hundreds of major platforms, took bank accounts away from me,
[08:37.480 --> 08:42.720]  took my ability to use PayPal away, listed me as basically a terrorist in an international
[08:42.720 --> 08:49.080]  database, but all of that was part of the new global social score coming where anyone
[08:49.080 --> 08:54.760]  that doesn't behave the way the establishment wants is downvoted into oblivion.
[08:54.760 --> 09:01.160]  Dear passengers, people who travel without tickets are believed to be utterly a small
[09:01.160 --> 09:07.560]  big public area where they're punished according to regulations and the behavior will be recorded
[09:07.560 --> 09:10.840]  in the individual credit information system.
[09:10.840 --> 09:14.840]  That's the plan for this modern Mark of the Beast world government system.
[09:14.840 --> 09:18.840]  Up and down the middle of the country, all red.
[09:18.840 --> 09:25.840]  Arkansas, Louisiana, the state of Montana, Missouri, yes, it was at 80% an hour ago for
[09:25.840 --> 09:26.840]  Clinton.
[09:26.840 --> 09:27.840]  What is it now?
[09:27.840 --> 09:28.840]  68%.
[09:28.840 --> 09:29.840]  Okay, God, I'm nervous.
[09:29.840 --> 09:30.840]  Ohio.
[09:30.840 --> 09:31.840]  Hold, hold, hold.
[09:31.840 --> 09:32.840]  Ohio, gone.
[09:32.840 --> 09:33.840]  Idaho.
[09:33.840 --> 09:38.840]  Okay, yeah, I don't see a fucking landslide here, I don't see it at all.
[09:38.840 --> 09:39.840]  North Carolina.
[09:39.840 --> 09:42.840]  If we need Florida, are you shitting me?
[09:42.840 --> 09:43.840]  Florida.
[09:43.840 --> 09:45.840]  It is fucking panic time.
[09:45.840 --> 09:46.840]  Georgia.
[09:46.840 --> 09:49.840]  Donald Trump now the favorite to win the presidency.
[09:49.840 --> 09:50.840]  Iowa.
[09:50.840 --> 09:54.280]  We'd already seen a lot of censorship against info wars on YouTube and Google and Facebook
[09:54.280 --> 09:58.600]  and Twitter, where if something we put out went particularly viral, it was embarrassing
[09:58.600 --> 10:02.620]  with the establishment, they would just delete it or shadow ban it.
[10:02.620 --> 10:12.560]  But when Hillary Clinton lost in 2016, they went from governing our reach down 90% to outright
[10:12.560 --> 10:18.760]  shutting us down 99%, where almost none of what we put out on Facebook, YouTube or Twitter
[10:18.760 --> 10:20.200]  reached anyone.
[10:20.200 --> 10:22.800]  But that wasn't enough for Hillary Clinton.
[10:22.800 --> 10:26.880]  That wasn't enough for Senator Wyden and Senator Blumenthal and Congressman Quigley
[10:26.880 --> 10:28.560]  and countless others.
[10:28.560 --> 10:31.520]  They had hearing after hearing after hearing.
[10:31.520 --> 10:37.880]  Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers.
[10:37.880 --> 10:41.040]  The video violated YouTube's rules against bullying and it was removed.
[10:41.040 --> 10:46.720]  Alex Jones obviously is a well known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[10:46.720 --> 10:52.120]  Demonizing me and lying about me and saying I was working for the Russians or that I was
[10:52.120 --> 10:53.120]  a racist.
[10:53.120 --> 10:58.940]  That was just a short time ago and I'm talking about when this meeting started.
[10:58.940 --> 11:05.760]  On Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag NYC terrorist attack, which is quote trending,
[11:05.760 --> 11:12.480]  marked with a red button saying quote live, the top tweet links to an info wars story
[11:12.480 --> 11:18.460]  with the headline, Imam, I warned DeBlasio about New York City terror, he was too busy
[11:18.460 --> 11:21.840]  bashing Trump.
[11:21.840 --> 11:29.200]  This is a real time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[11:29.200 --> 11:37.640]  If this stuff is not speech, it's incitement, harassment, defamation, I respectfully suggest
[11:37.640 --> 11:40.760]  whatever your machines are, they're not working.
[11:40.760 --> 11:45.920]  And that I was doing all these things that never really done to set the precedent that
[11:45.920 --> 11:51.640]  when I was banned, no one would stand up for me because I was supposedly a bad guy.
[11:51.640 --> 11:56.480]  And once that precedent was set, using the straw man, then everybody else would then
[11:56.480 --> 11:57.920]  be banned after.
[11:57.920 --> 12:03.040]  I predicted that, it was an easy call, and now it's happened.
[12:03.040 --> 12:07.280]  Hundreds of millions of pages have been deleted, hundreds of millions of people have had their
[12:07.280 --> 12:08.760]  accounts taken away.
[12:08.760 --> 12:14.480]  The Republican Party can't even put out an ad on Facebook saying we're looking for strong
[12:14.480 --> 12:17.400]  women to join Trump and empower America.
[12:17.400 --> 12:23.240]  That's supposedly hateful, when Antifa goes to the home of the Senate leader, Mitch McConnell,
[12:23.240 --> 12:27.920]  and threatens to stab him and kill him, they're allowed to put that out and use Twitter to
[12:27.920 --> 12:29.320]  bring people to his house.
[12:29.320 --> 12:34.680]  When he linked to it and said, look what these people are doing, they froze his account and
[12:34.680 --> 12:41.000]  stood by it, all because Trump and the Republican Party and others have put up with this.
[12:41.000 --> 12:58.520]  They had intensified the demonization on all these platforms where I couldn't respond
[12:58.520 --> 13:00.520]  back in a meaningful way.
[13:00.520 --> 13:05.600]  I still had platforms on the sites, but no one was able to get it or basically spread
[13:05.600 --> 13:07.480]  it or share it.
[13:07.480 --> 13:36.320]  Then, as more Project Veritas reports came out, exposing that I was the main target.
[13:36.320 --> 13:43.080]  They made their big move on August 6th, 2018, when I was banned on over 40 major platforms
[13:43.080 --> 13:45.200]  in just three days.
[13:45.200 --> 13:49.960]  Recently, many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated effort to censor content
[13:49.960 --> 13:52.000]  from broadcaster Alex Jones.
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.320]  Apple, Facebook, Spotify, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, all of them pulled or froze Jones's
[13:58.320 --> 14:03.240]  accounts on the grounds that his views are too dangerous to be heard publicly.
[14:03.240 --> 14:06.400]  No war has just lost their war on info.
[14:06.400 --> 14:13.920]  Isn't it funny, Stephen Colbert says, Alex Jones lost his war on info.
[14:13.920 --> 14:15.920]  Let's all celebrate that.
[14:15.920 --> 14:20.640]  Big major corporations, led by Tim Cook of Apple, who literally runs slave factories
[14:20.640 --> 14:25.640]  in China and who's moved their main base to China and who's given all the code keys
[14:25.640 --> 14:28.560]  to all Apple users of the Chinese government.
[14:28.560 --> 14:29.560]  That's confirmed.
[14:29.560 --> 14:33.560]  When Apple reported it, he gets up there and says, Alex Jones is garbage.
[14:33.560 --> 14:38.720]  We curated him out, like a museum, kind of like Hitler curated the Jews away, or how
[14:38.720 --> 14:45.120]  Mao Zedong killed 85 million of his own people in the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution,
[14:45.120 --> 14:48.560]  now being praised by the New York Times as a great leader.
[14:48.560 --> 14:55.000]  These are sick, evil authoritarians, and they are now taking everybody's speech, not just
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  mine.
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.520]  They're telling us, front page of the Washington Post, hey, Google Nest is watching and listening
[15:01.520 --> 15:03.920]  to you, and it's always been listening.
[15:03.920 --> 15:08.640]  It's been recording you for years, and so is Amazon's Alexa, and so is Facebook's system,
[15:08.640 --> 15:16.280]  and so are 20 other major companies like Samsung and others watching and listening to everything
[15:16.280 --> 15:19.440]  you do and putting it in corporate databases.
[15:19.440 --> 15:24.560]  And now they're proposing that if you say things and sound depressed or sound angry,
[15:24.560 --> 15:30.960]  that goes into a psychological score recorded by big data run by a new agency they're setting
[15:30.960 --> 15:37.120]  up called Harpa that does pre-crime that will take your guns, forcibly drug you, or send
[15:37.120 --> 15:41.480]  you to a psychiatric facility if you're a thought criminal.
[15:41.480 --> 15:58.080]  That 2019 isn't even over.
[15:58.080 --> 16:03.280]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[16:03.280 --> 16:07.520]  backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[16:07.520 --> 16:09.280]  important message you'll ever hear.
[16:09.280 --> 16:13.200]  Bill Hyde here, and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on
[16:13.200 --> 16:17.800]  our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[16:17.800 --> 16:18.800]  off the grid.
[16:18.800 --> 16:22.720]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East
[16:22.720 --> 16:24.200]  Bank of the Mississippi.
[16:24.200 --> 16:28.160]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location,
[16:28.160 --> 16:31.800]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[16:31.800 --> 16:36.120]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[16:36.120 --> 16:41.760]  So here's what you should do right now, check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.

[17:28.280 --> 17:29.280]  healthier I feel.
[17:29.280 --> 17:31.920]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[17:58.920 --> 18:03.160]  We sold secret 12 for four years, and it was our number third best seller.
[18:03.160 --> 18:08.040]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[18:08.040 --> 18:10.200]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[18:10.200 --> 18:14.600]  It's twice as strong as secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[18:14.600 --> 18:19.960]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things.
[18:19.960 --> 18:24.240]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps
[18:24.240 --> 18:29.240]  produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, it goes on
[18:29.240 --> 18:30.240]  and on.
[18:30.240 --> 18:32.920]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[18:32.920 --> 18:36.840]  weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[18:36.840 --> 18:39.240]  Bottom line folks, you need Ultra 12.

[18:59.240 --> 19:03.760]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[19:03.760 --> 19:09.480]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at Infowars, and we are the individuals
[19:09.480 --> 19:12.760]  that have done the research to understand the global spattle plan, and we know how to
[19:12.760 --> 19:13.760]  take them down.
[19:13.760 --> 19:15.520]  That's why they're so upset.
[19:15.520 --> 19:17.800]  Think how far we've come together.
[19:17.800 --> 19:21.040]  Even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on, because it's the right thing
[19:21.040 --> 19:26.240]  to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order who've really taken the
[19:26.240 --> 19:27.240]  mask off.
[19:27.240 --> 19:32.560]  The line's in the sand for everybody now, but you'd already chosen to fight the corruption
[19:32.560 --> 19:34.560]  and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[19:34.560 --> 19:38.840]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience, because you are truly
[19:38.840 --> 19:43.240]  activist in the arena, and without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your
[19:43.240 --> 19:48.360]  financial support, this operation that you built, that your operation would not be here.
[19:48.360 --> 19:51.360]  We've got some giant specials running right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[19:51.360 --> 19:54.400]  A lot of items, 50% off.
[19:54.400 --> 20:02.240]  Please take advantage of it at InfowarsStore.com to help us fight even harder into the future.
[20:02.240 --> 20:08.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:08.240 --> 20:34.240]  Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, we're not going to allow it to
[20:34.240 --> 20:37.240]  be used against our fellow Americans anymore.
[20:37.240 --> 20:41.480]  These cartels are coming after not just our First Amendment, they're coming after our
[20:41.480 --> 20:46.680]  Second Amendment, and openly saying they're going to ban all the semi-autos and come to
[20:46.680 --> 20:56.600]  our homes and take them, if need be, from my cold dead hands.
[20:56.600 --> 21:02.280]  Tech Overlords like Sundar Pachai, the CEO of Google, hope that you take it lying down.
[21:02.280 --> 21:04.920]  They don't like it when you do what I and others did.
[21:04.920 --> 21:10.360]  Go to Congress and confront them with their treason against humanity face-to-face.
[21:10.360 --> 21:19.040]  Google is evil, Google is evil, Google is evil, Google is evil, Google is evil, Google
[21:19.040 --> 21:20.040]  is evil.
[21:20.040 --> 21:24.480]  As fate would have it, the day that I decided to go to the White House and bullhorn President
[21:24.480 --> 21:29.680]  Trump to take action against big tech censorship and attempts to steal the upcoming election,
[21:29.680 --> 21:34.960]  Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, just happened to be inside lying to the president.
[21:34.960 --> 21:39.880]  You must take action against the censors, you must take action against big tech.
[21:39.880 --> 21:46.440]  Look at what I'm there on at the White House lawn, Alex Jones, the controversial host,
[21:46.440 --> 21:49.600]  Trump supporter, out there with a bullhorn.
[21:49.600 --> 21:53.680]  Tucker Carlson said it best, infowars wasn't taken off the air because we're lying or
[21:53.680 --> 21:58.560]  because we're bad and the system wants to protect you in between all the Prozac drug
[21:58.560 --> 22:00.200]  ads they're pitching.
[22:00.200 --> 22:05.360]  It's because the truth is so much more powerful than a lie, they can't succeed in deceiving
[22:05.360 --> 22:09.440]  you if the truth is allowed to be out there in the open to challenge them.
[22:09.440 --> 22:14.960]  Because we can feel it, we can see it, we can, as Tucker Carlson says, smell it.
[22:14.960 --> 22:17.440]  Censorship does not work.
[22:17.440 --> 22:18.440]  Ideas spread.
[22:18.440 --> 22:22.480]  The good ones, which are rooted in nature and observable reality, take root and they
[22:22.480 --> 22:23.880]  endure.
[22:23.880 --> 22:26.560]  People know what's true, they can smell it.
[22:26.560 --> 22:32.240]  You see there was a perfect storm, dying corporate media like CNN and others that no one believed
[22:32.240 --> 22:38.280]  or wanted to watch, that they have to pay to be in bars and hotels and train stations
[22:38.280 --> 22:44.440]  and airports and the dying political corporate system worldwide that the people are seeing
[22:44.440 --> 22:51.600]  through and big tech that's offering to protect old dying media and the political establishment
[22:51.600 --> 22:57.320]  if they just give big tech total control over everything they do then the technocracy will
[22:57.320 --> 23:01.800]  protect the establishment and now big tech is taking over education and is spying on
[23:01.800 --> 23:06.240]  all the pupils in public and private education and tracking everything they do over the iPads
[23:06.240 --> 23:08.320]  and over the systems.
[23:08.320 --> 23:14.920]  Any serious government, any serious military that looked at this anti-human agenda and
[23:14.920 --> 23:19.040]  how it's unified across the planet and how it's been working for over a hundred years
[23:19.040 --> 23:23.360]  in the scientific community to build this breakaway civilization and this post-human
[23:23.360 --> 23:27.720]  world would have to come away with one conclusion.
[23:27.720 --> 23:35.600]  There's some type of off-world or interdimensional, call it satanic revelation or mystery of evils
[23:35.600 --> 23:40.680]  what the Bible calls it that is literally building a worldwide government with a casteless
[23:40.680 --> 23:47.440]  society meant to micromanage and control every facet of our lives and it tells us that it's
[23:47.440 --> 23:54.560]  doing it to build a post-human world on the ashes of which this new age man or this God
[23:54.560 --> 23:57.520]  is going to arise from.
[23:57.520 --> 24:02.600]  Don't these suckers see that this spirit that's commanding them, that's influencing
[24:02.600 --> 24:09.480]  them, that is animating them, that is inspiring them, that is possessing them has come to
[24:09.480 --> 24:11.880]  kill, still destroy.
[24:11.880 --> 24:16.880]  All the science, all the Trojan horse iPhones make us depressed, make us lonely, make us
[24:16.880 --> 24:22.080]  not have people we love, it destroys our lives and it's only getting worse.
[24:22.080 --> 24:28.680]  It's an incremental soft kill, silent weapon for quiet wars.
[24:28.680 --> 24:33.000]  The ambient background is being turned up just like the frog in the cold water slowly
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.720]  turn up the heat.
[24:34.720 --> 24:40.280]  It incrementally never feels the temperature until it passes out and then dies.
[24:40.280 --> 24:46.200]  We can face a frontal assault, we can face a foreign army but we cannot face the creeping
[24:46.200 --> 24:52.000]  manipulative death that is globalism and the worldwide technocracy they're building.
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.960]  And so the story of infowars being taken off the air, being shut down, being blocked on
[24:57.960 --> 25:05.880]  almost every platform is the story of everyone in the future as this octopus, as this giant
[25:05.880 --> 25:11.720]  squid, as this face sucker gets firmly in control over us.
[25:11.720 --> 25:14.360]  Every day that passes we're losing our humanity.
[25:14.360 --> 25:18.800]  Every day that passes we're losing that spark and that God-like spirit that our Creator
[25:18.800 --> 25:20.280]  gave us.
[25:20.280 --> 25:25.160]  Every day we're losing that connection to God, we're losing that connection to family
[25:25.160 --> 25:30.600]  and to the earth and to the soil and to being natural good creatures.
[25:30.600 --> 25:36.360]  We are in the process of being phased out, of being destroyed.
[25:36.360 --> 25:41.240]  Not because we're ugly and failed but because we are the rightful heirs to this earth and
[25:41.240 --> 25:46.760]  because God has an incredible future for us but had to give us free will so we could choose
[25:46.760 --> 25:52.920]  whether to be led by the fallen one into this system that we know is killing us or to go
[25:52.920 --> 25:58.400]  with our spirit and our gut and our common sense and our ancestors crying out to us from
[25:58.400 --> 26:02.600]  eternity waiting for us to join them at the next level.
[26:02.600 --> 26:07.360]  If you want to stay with the devil and the worldwide system that's your choice but to
[26:07.360 --> 26:11.600]  all of you thinking you're getting ahead by serving the system by going along with Facebook
[26:11.600 --> 26:15.520]  three months ago when Zuckerberg said Alex Jones is the most banned man on earth they
[26:15.520 --> 26:20.360]  said you will not say his name in a positive way only negative you will not promote Infowars.com
[26:20.360 --> 26:21.720]  unless you attack it.
[26:21.720 --> 26:23.280]  How dangerous is Infowars?
[26:23.280 --> 26:27.480]  Well Facebook believes it's so dangerous that you can be banned from using the platform
[26:27.480 --> 26:33.480]  Facebook just for sharing its content unless you simultaneously denounce it.
[26:33.480 --> 26:38.440]  It's a giant cult that's what reeducation camps are and that's what it is on a giant
[26:38.440 --> 26:45.480]  digital scale and that's what we've already accepted wake up and say no to it now.
[26:45.480 --> 26:50.720]  In closing I'm not worried about myself people say how are you taking it what's it like what's
[26:50.720 --> 26:57.800]  it like watching this control grid this cage this web this net being tied around humanity
[26:57.800 --> 27:06.000]  and watching most people asleep or in a trance as they're slowly fed into the mouth of this
[27:06.000 --> 27:13.520]  monster it's incredibly animating it's incredibly empowering because I'm awake and I'm struggling
[27:13.520 --> 27:19.120]  against it and it's not my opinion they said what they're doing they said it's an anti-human
[27:19.120 --> 27:23.880]  system because metaphysically they have to tell you that's God's rules what they're
[27:23.880 --> 27:29.520]  doing to you just like cigarettes and they'll kill you on the package ladies and gentlemen
[27:29.520 --> 27:32.280]  you're being given free will you're being given a chance that's why we're still on
[27:32.280 --> 27:39.120]  air but the only way we get out is through organic humans spreading the word the AI system
[27:39.120 --> 27:45.640]  is using us as a test case of how to shut down the human resistance against us I represent
[27:45.640 --> 27:50.520]  the human resistance to whatever the hell this thing is that we know is killing us we
[27:50.520 --> 27:54.560]  need to have a debate about what it is we'd have a debate about its game plan we'd have
[27:54.560 --> 27:59.160]  a debate about how we're going to stop it and for those of you that choose to join this
[27:59.160 --> 28:07.680]  thing you've been given over a great illusion because the road you're going down is not
[28:07.680 --> 28:11.760]  one that's going to empower you it's one that's going to destroy not just your physical
[28:11.760 --> 28:17.880]  body but the information you carry and who you are your soul that is real your genetics
[28:17.880 --> 28:22.960]  is under attack your body is under attack your soul is under attack your will is under attack
[28:22.960 --> 28:28.800]  and you must face the fact you're under attack to become strong and resistant don't adapt
[28:28.800 --> 28:35.480]  to submitting to it adapt to overcome it but first you must admit it in full wars quest
[28:35.480 --> 28:41.440]  is the human quest you are the resistance we are the resistance and we're unstoppable
[28:41.440 --> 28:49.040]  when we ask God for help a great darkness is upon us but the darkness is there to challenge
[28:49.040 --> 28:54.680]  us to recognize and choose God and choose justice thank you for watching please get

[41:24.640 --> 41:31.080]  just don't get it i'm just stunned at this point how anybody could vote for a democrat
[41:31.080 --> 41:38.360]  but the good news is ladies and gentlemen you know here's what i realized and it's time
[41:38.360 --> 41:43.000]  for conservatives to come out of their shell because here's what i already knew this but
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.800]  it just re-hit me last night i was uh doing some shopping last night and i was picking
[41:47.800 --> 41:54.640]  up some new sport coats and the nice lady that was helping me we we just started talking
[41:54.640 --> 41:58.720]  about an issue she just moved here from houston she she was shocked at the homelessness and
[41:58.720 --> 42:03.280]  the conversation kind of went down the road and it turns out you know she's you know conservatives
[42:03.280 --> 42:09.080]  shares conservative beliefs and i'm standing there like you know do i talk about conservative
[42:09.080 --> 42:14.320]  politics do i say x or y and be afraid if this is liberal and i just realized because
[42:14.320 --> 42:19.160]  we just agreed with almost everything and it was just common sense stuff like it's time
[42:19.160 --> 42:26.040]  for conservatives not to be intimidated out of their first amendment it's time for us
[42:26.040 --> 42:30.360]  to realize we are in the vast majority and before i even walked out of the store there
[42:30.360 --> 42:34.280]  were three other people one of them recognized me and the other two were like yeah we really
[42:34.280 --> 42:37.240]  do need to do something about this homeless institute it's turning into california what
[42:37.240 --> 42:41.960]  are the democrats doing ladies and gentlemen people are sick of the democrat party people

[46:05.240 --> 46:08.040]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[46:08.040 --> 46:12.720]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[46:12.720 --> 46:17.480]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born
[46:17.480 --> 46:20.080]  for their organs to be harvested.
[46:20.080 --> 46:25.000]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson and info wars dot com 15 years ago
[46:25.000 --> 46:30.440]  that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds
[46:30.440 --> 46:36.800]  and hundreds of other giant issues like the Federal Reserve being private run for profit
[46:36.800 --> 46:40.840]  trying to control our economy that our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the commerce
[46:40.840 --> 46:46.760]  Chinese on every one of these issues and many others we've been dead on and we've raised
[46:46.760 --> 46:51.320]  the alarm on the planetary scale that's why the globalists are trying to shut us down
[46:51.320 --> 46:56.120]  and that's why you are more critical than ever to support the info war please support
[46:56.120 --> 47:04.600]  the info war however you can you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:26.120 --> 47:33.440]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info wars
[47:33.440 --> 47:45.400]  dot com studios it's Alex Jones you said quote Americans who own AR 15s and APA 47s will
[47:45.400 --> 47:50.240]  have to sell them to the government all of them you know the critics call this confiscation
[47:50.240 --> 47:55.720]  are you proposing taking away their guns and how would this work I am if it's a weapon
[47:55.720 --> 48:05.760]  that was designed to kill people on a battlefield if the high impact high velocity round when
[48:05.760 --> 48:10.640]  it hits your body shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do
[48:10.640 --> 48:14.840]  that so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield not be able to get up and kill
[48:14.840 --> 48:21.040]  one of our soldiers when we see that being used against children and in Odessa I met
[48:21.040 --> 48:26.720]  the mother of a 15 year old girl who was shot by an AR 15 and that mother watched her bleed
[48:26.720 --> 48:30.920]  to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR
[48:30.920 --> 48:36.480]  15 in Odessa in Midland there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time hell yes
[48:36.480 --> 48:53.360]  we're going to take your AR 15 your AK 47 they're coming for your guns they're coming
[48:53.360 --> 48:59.640]  to disarm you they're coming to complete your journey into serfdom and slavery almost every
[48:59.640 --> 49:04.880]  nation on earth has had the guns taken you can count on one hand the nations that still
[49:04.880 --> 49:09.400]  have a basic right to keep their arms and one of those was New Zealand but when a man
[49:09.400 --> 49:15.240]  came to the country and he legally got guns and killed people now we all globally are
[49:15.240 --> 49:19.920]  guilty and have to turn our guns in even though that makes crime rates explode and creates
[49:19.920 --> 49:25.040]  a victim empowerment culture and now in New Zealand they're facing five years in jail
[49:25.040 --> 49:30.080]  if they don't turn their guns in and we have the images in the video of people turning
[49:30.080 --> 49:35.760]  their guns in in mass this is happening ladies and gentlemen and if they try to do that here
[49:35.760 --> 49:39.480]  in the U.S. which the Democrats admit they want to do which they unanimously admit is
[49:39.480 --> 49:46.200]  their policy the police are going to be the instrument trying to carry out that unconstitutional
[49:46.200 --> 49:52.360]  deadly duty our nation was founded in 1776 because the Redcoats were coming all over
[49:52.360 --> 49:57.560]  the colonies confiscating the guns starting in Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill in
[49:57.560 --> 50:02.400]  1875 the globalist don't care about your children the globalist don't care about your safety
[50:02.400 --> 50:06.880]  they know that crime using guns is actually very rare it's a rare way to die they know
[50:06.880 --> 50:12.800]  that but they are invoking your emotions to manipulate you and to make you feel guilty
[50:12.800 --> 50:17.360]  for what psychotics and crazies do they have total gun control the Middle East but they
[50:17.360 --> 50:21.920]  have one of the highest crime rates in terrorism and jihad everywhere Mexico has the highest
[50:21.920 --> 50:27.480]  crime rate in the world many years or is it number two place because all the citizens
[50:27.480 --> 50:31.920]  have been disarmed we already know all this and so it's time to get back in the system's
[50:31.920 --> 50:37.400]  face and say listen you're not getting our firearms it's not going to happen the left
[50:37.400 --> 50:41.200]  knows it will cause a civil war and because they're losing the political battle for hearts
[50:41.200 --> 50:47.120]  and minds they want to start gun confiscation in blue states and in blue cities to trigger
[50:47.120 --> 50:52.400]  a civil war they're even going to have anti for guaranteed staging themselves as patriots
[50:52.400 --> 50:56.800]  and carry out false flags to blame us the globalists are making their move with economic
[50:56.800 --> 51:01.520]  warfare with trying to start a war with Iran with manipulating everything to try to stop
[51:01.520 --> 51:06.960]  this nation getting control of its own destiny again but the people are aware and the people
[51:06.960 --> 51:12.200]  understand that being sheeple and being followers is what's gotten us in its predicament and
[51:12.200 --> 51:17.080]  America and the world is awakening with populism and freedom let's not go the way of the hundred
[51:17.080 --> 51:22.120]  of other nations over a hundred that incrementally had their guns completely taken look at what's
[51:22.120 --> 51:28.080]  happening in New Zealand right now and understand this will not be America's fate New Zealand
[51:28.080 --> 51:33.160]  is a former commonwealth of the British crown we broke away from that if you want to be disarmed
[51:33.160 --> 51:37.640]  if you want to be a slave physically moved to North Africa they still have slavery legal
[51:37.640 --> 51:42.400]  there if you want to turn your guns in go to North Korea go to China go to Mexico be
[51:42.400 --> 51:47.520]  a slave but America's different we deserve one damn country or the second amendment and
[51:47.520 --> 51:50.840]  the right to keep their arms hasn't been flushed down the toilet and where we have the free
[51:50.840 --> 51:56.320]  right of free humans to defend ourselves throughout history serfs have been disarmed slaves can
[51:56.320 --> 52:00.680]  never have weapons we are not slaves in America we are free men and the right of free speeches
[52:00.680 --> 52:05.280]  under attack as well and the right of property rights and the right of families we retake
[52:05.280 --> 52:10.000]  our liberty and our birthright and declare that we are not your slaves and we will stand
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.800]  up against your tyranny exercise your first amendment and your second amendment now or
[52:14.800 --> 52:20.440]  lose it like those in New Zealand firearms collection event 100 kilometers northeast
[52:20.440 --> 52:26.080]  of the capital following the deadly attack in Christchurch the country's labor government
[52:26.080 --> 52:31.480]  launched a national buyback scheme offering financial compensation to people who surrender
[52:31.480 --> 52:37.840]  their guns before the 20th of December as part of tougher gun laws most semi-automatic
[52:37.840 --> 52:43.800]  weapons and high-capacity magazines are now banned since the program kicked off in mid
[52:43.800 --> 52:51.520]  July more than 19,000 firearms have been handed in and 21 million euros paid out there are
[52:51.520 --> 52:55.640]  some people that are very emotional with some of some of the forums and we accept that and
[52:55.640 --> 52:59.520]  we'll do everything to respect that we make the process as easy and as simple as possible
[52:59.520 --> 53:03.400]  for them where the forums are old and been handed down through the family it's quite
[53:03.400 --> 53:08.120]  an impact on them to actually have to give that firearm after many years or generations
[53:08.120 --> 53:14.360]  been in that family the contentious crackdown and subsequent debate have divided not only
[53:14.360 --> 53:22.200]  New Zealand but the firearm community itself some 250,000 gun license holders you're only
[53:22.200 --> 53:27.760]  taking the weapons off the honest people it's more about laws about those that have weapons
[53:27.760 --> 53:35.120]  and are unlicensed and using them dishonestly I fully support it I think you know you don't
[53:35.120 --> 53:40.800]  need these sorts of guns it should have actually been sorted out years ago that's my thought
[53:40.800 --> 53:46.640]  hey it's got to happen you know it's like anything one bad act was a bunch done it
[53:46.640 --> 53:51.520]  while many New Zealanders welcome these tighter gun laws others accuse the government of rushing
[53:51.520 --> 53:57.280]  through ineffective knee jerk legislation groups such as the council of licensed firearms
[53:57.280 --> 54:02.480]  owners claim the reforms punish those who do the right thing and say they deserve to
[54:02.480 --> 54:07.600]  be heard it's really important that the government starts to listen to some of the subject matter
[54:07.600 --> 54:13.760]  experts this first tranche of legislation has gone through without our help without
[54:13.760 --> 54:19.800]  our assistance there is no need to have a divide between firearm owners and general public
[54:19.800 --> 54:30.320]  because those firearm owners are still general public for some New Zealanders hunting is
[54:30.320 --> 54:38.960]  a way of life both as a source of food and as a method of pest control well there you
[54:38.960 --> 54:50.760]  go now if New Zealand is successful with this gun confiscation within 20 years you will
[54:50.760 --> 55:00.200]  see it ramp up in violence and criminal behavior I would say it'll probably take some time
[55:00.200 --> 55:07.200]  to reach a state like Mexico is that right now where you have hundreds thousands of politicians
[55:07.200 --> 55:15.840]  murdered over the years and the cartels basically run everything so now that the cartels know
[55:15.840 --> 55:22.120]  New Zealanders are disarming themselves they will slowly start to move in and believe me
[55:22.120 --> 55:27.960]  there will be plenty of firearms to go around for the criminals in New Zealand but if you're
[55:27.960 --> 55:35.320]  a law abiding citizen you will be disarmed and you will be a victim in fact the best
[55:35.320 --> 55:43.880]  bumper sticker I ever saw or gun rights it was just simple it had two boxes to be checked
[55:43.880 --> 55:50.120]  one of them said gun owner the other said victim which one are you which one will the
[55:50.120 --> 55:58.280]  New Zealand people be and I think we know where that goes from here but this is what
[55:58.280 --> 56:05.200]  the Democrats are trying to recreate this gun buyback program or this gun confiscation
[56:05.200 --> 56:13.240]  like Beto O'Rourke is calling for it's not going to go over well the good news is Beto
[56:13.240 --> 56:20.880]  will never be president that's the good news that creepo will never be president that total
[56:20.880 --> 56:28.560]  fraud will never be president the bad news is it's now been implanted in the Democrat
[56:28.560 --> 56:35.840]  voters mind yeah we can call for the confiscation of guns that's now considered mainstream of
[56:35.840 --> 56:42.240]  course the Democrat party is probably perplexed by this this is something they've obviously
[56:42.240 --> 56:47.840]  been wanting to do but they couldn't say it in so many words now Beto's let the cat out
[56:47.840 --> 56:56.360]  of the bag and I just see no path to victory for a Democrat party right now in the 2020
[56:56.360 --> 57:01.960]  election these are people that are avowed socialists admit it calling for more socialist
[57:01.960 --> 57:07.600]  policies they want open borders they want to destroy the second amendment and this is
[57:07.600 --> 57:13.280]  just not popular so they can think whatever they want about those policies they're not
[57:13.280 --> 57:21.520]  popular they do not sell and they will not win a presidential election but what is going
[57:21.520 --> 57:25.040]  on with this Democrat race where you have all of these people pulling at zero that are
[57:25.040 --> 57:30.000]  still running they're just in it for money and fame folks Beto O'Rourke's not gonna win
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.000]  Pete Booty judge isn't gonna win they're all irrelevant at this point except for maybe
[57:35.000 --> 57:40.120]  three or four of them but they're gonna keep raking in those campaign dollars and keep
[57:40.120 --> 57:45.000]  calling to take your guns so good job Beto the number one gun salesman in America today
[57:45.000 --> 57:53.000]  Beto O'Rourke we have never been closer to a new world war with the crisis in the Middle
[57:53.000 --> 58:02.320]  East with the Saudi oil fields destroyed half of their capacity 5% of world capacity whoever's
[58:02.320 --> 58:09.040]  behind it know this there are powerful forces that want a global configuration and now is
[58:09.040 --> 58:13.720]  the time to be more aware of that than ever and understand how precarious our position
[58:13.720 --> 58:20.280]  is here on this planet and that we are just mortal flawed human beings that need to seek
[58:20.280 --> 58:26.960]  God's countenance God's discernment and to pray for peace and to pray for transparency
[58:26.960 --> 58:32.160]  and to pray that the very twisted evil forces on this planet trying to start a world war
[58:32.160 --> 58:37.200]  will be exposed and their attempts at creating even bigger global crisis will be stopped
[58:37.200 --> 58:42.320]  now we'll probably avert a new world war hopefully but it's already tilting towards
[58:42.320 --> 58:46.800]  a global depression because of energy crisis we're covering it all live on the radio at

[59:51.600 --> 1:00:08.920]  You're listening to the alex jones show the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to
[1:00:08.920 --> 1:00:17.080]  the alex jones show and now your host owin shroyer we're going to be rejoined by alex
[1:00:17.080 --> 1:00:25.920]  jones in the next segment but let's take a step back and remember who and what we're
[1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:33.480]  dealing with in the fake news and you really have to sit here and think critically why
[1:00:33.480 --> 1:00:43.480]  would you have news publications like the new york times be so fraudulent be such liars
[1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:47.480]  mean where does that come from what are they protecting who are they protecting why do
[1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:50.520]  they just lie to the public like that and think they can get away with it when it comes
[1:00:50.520 --> 1:00:55.400]  to the Brett Kavanaugh story where literally the woman that they printed about says she
[1:00:55.400 --> 1:01:01.560]  didn't remember it the committees that were running the investigation in the cabinet accusations
[1:01:01.560 --> 1:01:05.960]  reached out to her she declined comment or to come forward but that doesn't stop the
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:13.440]  new york times from lying what is up with that so last night at a rally in new mexico
[1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:17.680]  where trump had what 1520 thousand let me tell you something there isn't a democrat that
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:22.320]  could get 10,000 people at an event in new mexico if they were giving away a free hot
[1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:28.720]  meal they still couldn't get 10,000 trump had at least 15,000 they were literally in
[1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:34.440]  fact now at every rally trump has to set up they have to set up an outside viewing center
[1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:38.680]  with a with a projection screen because it's overflowing the arenas every time not a democrat
[1:01:38.680 --> 1:01:43.640]  could even hope for that if they were giving away a hot meal and a reach around but here's
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:51.320]  trump last night calling out the new york times for their blatant fake news they use
[1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:58.280]  democrat prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever they can they'll do whatever
[1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:06.360]  they can to demean you to libel you they try to blacklist coerce cancel or destroy anyone
[1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:13.200]  who gets in their way look at what they're doing today to justice cavanaugh look at what
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:21.480]  they're doing i wonder if this isn't in response to uh ruth bader ginsberg health decline did
[1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:26.040]  you see the new york times did you see what they're doing did you see what democrats they're
[1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:32.320]  calling for his resignation they're calling for his impeachment and the woman involved
[1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:39.240]  said she didn't know anything she does but they still so the new york times had to put
[1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:46.040]  out a major apology and they had to change their story the woman said i don't remember
[1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:56.280]  that and they still want him to be a beast and i just put out a statement and he's a
[1:02:56.280 --> 1:03:06.440]  great man by the way great talent a great brilliant man brett cavanaugh and i just put
[1:03:06.440 --> 1:03:12.120]  out a statement on social media that said i don't think they'll do it but they should
[1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:17.720]  for the good of the nation i call for the resignation of everybody at the new york times
[1:03:17.720 --> 1:03:26.560]  involved in the cavanaugh spearstone or maybe it's just time for people to start suing the
[1:03:26.560 --> 1:03:33.200]  new york times into oblivion that's one way to go about this we know that that's what
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:38.920]  the left loves to do except they have no real litigation it's all frivolous it's all legal
[1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:45.080]  warfare it's all for press but that's what this is about you see the new york times
[1:03:45.080 --> 1:03:50.840]  knew everything was fake knew they were publishing a libelous story they knew it why did they
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:58.440]  do it because here's the kicker i'm sorry just thinking about this makes me so frustrated
[1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:05.120]  now anytime you want to have a political discussion with some brainwashed liberal what are they
[1:04:05.120 --> 1:04:11.200]  going to say trump appointed a rapist to the supreme court how can you support that and
[1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:15.640]  you say what are you talking about they say didn't you see the story in the new york times
[1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:20.920]  about cavanaugh's penis they literally tweeted about it folks a fake story and they tweeted
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:26.640]  about his penis i mean do you do you get any lower than the new york times i mean i don't
[1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:31.320]  know i mean you go straight to hell maybe that might be lower but they don't care it's
[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:36.880]  all a game publish the story the brainwashed leftists eat it up after it's reported on
[1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:43.600]  cnn msnbc nbc abc cbs news all night long they retract it 24 hours later the retraction
[1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:49.600]  never gets covered so the first wave of information cavanaugh raped this lady total fake news
[1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:53.320]  that's all people hear that becomes reality doesn't even matter that the new york times
[1:04:53.320 --> 1:05:02.080]  admitted the whole thing was fake super silver wound gel is a private label from the top
[1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:06.040]  company in the u.s. that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter
[1:05:06.040 --> 1:05:09.960]  and approved for that by the FDA we have been blessed with their listeners and let us private
[1:05:09.960 --> 1:05:15.320]  label it the last two years it's been a bestseller we convinced them to let us come out with a
[1:05:15.320 --> 1:05:20.840]  skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower
[1:05:20.840 --> 1:05:27.000]  price with their patented silver salt technology in it it's got the hyaluronic acid it's got
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:33.720]  the steric acid it's got the grapefruit essential oil it's got the nano silver coconut oil and
[1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:39.400]  so much more it's in two sizes super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller
[1:05:39.400 --> 1:05:42.760]  one you're not going to find a product that's good anywhere you're certainly not going to
[1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:48.720]  find it at this price and it funds the info war at info wars life dot com get your super
[1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:54.160]  silver skin cream today we can only run this special for another week or so as of taping
[1:05:54.160 --> 1:06:02.240]  this september 10th meanwhile the new york times revising that bombshell report on new
[1:06:02.240 --> 1:06:07.760]  sexual misconduct allegations against supreme court justice brett cavanaugh the newspaper
[1:06:07.760 --> 1:06:14.520]  publishing an editor's note last night revealing the alleged victim referenced in their report
[1:06:14.520 --> 1:06:18.680]  does not remember the incident the times correcting its story on these allegations surfacing
[1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:23.240]  in a new book by two times reporters claiming a former cavanaugh classmate and clinton
[1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:28.440]  connected lawyer max styre witnessed the sexual misconduct turns out the allegations were
[1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:32.760]  uninvestigated and friends of the alleged victim as you mentioned say she does not remember
[1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:37.640]  it the times writing in their correction we corroborated the story with two officials
[1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:42.440]  who have communicated with mr. styre the female student declined to be interviewed and friends
[1:06:42.440 --> 1:06:47.880]  say she does not recall the episode i mean this is what happens when a story with a big
[1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:55.240]  problem gets out it explodes on twitter presidential candidates react on the basis of the story
[1:06:55.240 --> 1:07:01.440]  without the later correction and now everybody's on record most everybody in the democratic
[1:07:01.440 --> 1:07:07.920]  field given the fact that it appears as though brett cavanaugh lied under oath which is a
[1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:14.560]  crime i think that he has disqualified himself for service on the supreme court he should
[1:07:14.560 --> 1:07:19.640]  step down or he should be impeached if one person or two people weren't paying attention
[1:07:19.640 --> 1:07:23.880]  if molly hemmingway hadn't pointed this out that the that the main person the victim could
[1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:27.920]  not verify the actual accusation the times would not have copped to this they would not
[1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:32.200]  have had the correct correction they're only doing it because they got caught and it raises
[1:07:32.200 --> 1:07:37.520]  that a really big question how many stories did they get away with because nobody was
[1:07:37.520 --> 1:07:42.760]  paying attention i think the new york times made another terrible mistake it's a it's
[1:07:42.760 --> 1:07:48.480]  a shame that a thing like that could happen i see they're making a big correction today
[1:07:48.480 --> 1:07:53.360]  they've just announced there's a correction but to do that about a supreme court justice
[1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:59.200]  is a terrible thing it's a false accusation whatever happened with the new york times
[1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:03.640]  i mean i can tell you personally they never checked they never do we used to have a thing
[1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:08.840]  called fact checking they don't do fact checking anymore they used to call and say what about
[1:08:08.840 --> 1:08:14.240]  this what about that how can they do a thing like that and destroy somebody's life i mean
[1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:20.400]  they're destroying lives and it's fake news it's just fake news but it's a very fair question
[1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:24.840]  i mean they have to be very embarrassed but much more importantly what they do is wrong
[1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:30.440]  and they do it all the time time and time again we have seen trump zig and then zag
[1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:35.280]  but in almost every case he ends up doing the right thing roger stone's absolutely right
[1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:39.520]  about trump when he gets the right information he does the right thing he cares about the
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:44.440]  nation he doesn't like seeing us being sold out he doesn't like seeing the globalist with
[1:08:44.440 --> 1:08:49.800]  the left who are america haters give us one-sided deals over and over again it's that simple
[1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:55.040]  and so when we say make america great again we mean bring sovereignty back to our nation
[1:08:55.040 --> 1:08:59.200]  we're not gonna be perfect but let's have our government federal state and local be
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:06.440]  run by americans and not by these globalist combines the imf the world bank the wto globalism
[1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:09.720]  is about destroying the nation states and transferring the power of we the people out
[1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:14.160]  of the nation we've already got enough problem with far away dc or far away state capitals
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:20.160]  or out of control bureaucracies when they become the imf or the world bank or the wto or the
[1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:26.360]  unelected e you we are truly slaves and so the process of waking up to this is happening
[1:09:26.360 --> 1:09:30.800]  faster and faster and sure the e use fighting brings it and all the rest of it but that's
[1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:35.640]  part of the process 20 years ago the average brit didn't even know they were in the e you
[1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:40.200]  it had been done by stealth i'd talk about how the e you was about to take over and write
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:44.640]  their laws i'd have Nigel Farage on 20 years ago and people thought we were conspiracy
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:50.200]  theorist but then the e you took over they started making all the laws started flooding
[1:09:50.200 --> 1:09:55.600]  them with illegal aliens and so the population woke up and just recently we've seen a huge
[1:09:55.600 --> 1:09:59.640]  awakening with Epstein and his murder and the fact that he was running a government
[1:09:59.640 --> 1:10:04.280]  blackmail ring we've seen the public wake up as it comes out in major studies that fluoride
[1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:08.600]  does lower IQs and doesn't help our teeth and gives us cancer it's coming out in major
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:12.440]  studies that glyphosate gave us cancer from the start and they knew it and covered it
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:18.080]  up the list goes on and on that 3g 4g and 5g give us cancer and we're asking who are
[1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:24.800]  these corporations they go out of their way to kill people like Bayer 15 years ago knowingly
[1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:31.840]  took blood from the Clintons who control the Arkansas prisons and for over a decade shipped
[1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:36.240]  it out around the world being put into factorate blood products for hemophiliacs filled with
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:42.000]  HIV and hepatitis and killed over a million people when the documents came out their corporate
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:47.840]  heads just said screw these people they need to die anyways let's just give them HIV there
[1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:52.400]  is an awakening to how sinister and psychopathic these corporate leaders are who for hundreds
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:57.360]  of years pass on power to the next corporate head the next psychopath and they all watch
[1:10:57.360 --> 1:11:01.440]  each other's backs and they all get away with the hell they're putting up and because Trump
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:04.960]  and other nationalists other populace have been getting elected that so scares these
[1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:11.120]  globalists that they've thrown everything they've got at us and we've seen the fake
[1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:15.640]  news about myself the fake news about Trump but this Brett Kavanaugh situation where
[1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:20.520]  they've had what seven women supposedly go public turns out most of them never went public
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:24.760]  and said that they were never assaulted by in fact they never met him and then other women
[1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:29.120]  all of them former Clinton lawyers or Clinton operatives or Obama operatives just made it
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:33.480]  up and this latest woman the New York Times said Kavanaugh pulled his genitals out and
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:37.840]  pushed on her at a party what was the source on that former Clinton lawyers giving testimony
[1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:42.000]  to the LA Times and the New York Times and then the New York Times and LA Times talked
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:46.040]  to each other and said oh we heard this too from each other until finally somebody went
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:49.200]  to the woman and said have you ever met Kavanaugh did you ever go to a party she goes no I don't
[1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:53.120]  remember any of this didn't happen you gotta ask yourself why are they that bold well because
[1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:57.760]  they've gotten away with thousands of such stories and they're in total war mode because
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:01.360]  they got caught lying with fake polls in the election in Dona Brazil giving the debate
[1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:05.940]  questions to Hillary from CNN instead of stopping the lying they're tripling and quadrupling
[1:12:05.940 --> 1:12:11.760]  down and telling bigger more fantastical lies that are so unbelievable I mean come on it's
[1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:16.400]  gotta be true and you learn this trick they do where Kavanaugh's at the party and he pulls
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:20.520]  his genitals out and then someone else pushes it in the woman's hand you're like that doesn't
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:25.200]  make sense but they've learned in psychological warfare that if you're lying make it sound
[1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:29.880]  confusing and weird and then people kind of get lost in the minutiae and think well it
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:35.000]  must be true because it doesn't make sense it is weird it's a psychological tactic just
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:40.640]  like they had the Daily Mail say that I wear swastika tennis shoes 100% a lie that I hit
[1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:45.880]  on an employee and that I never actually hit on him but that he felt like I was hitting
[1:12:45.880 --> 1:12:50.800]  on him it's crazy ladies and gentlemen this is what they do just 100% made up NPR did
[1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:55.160]  a piece where they said that I beat up all these little kids when I was in high school
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:59.040]  and so they invited me out to a party someplace and tied me up in a barn and knocked my teeth
[1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:03.360]  out that never happened I never beat anybody up that didn't physically attack me I never
[1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:07.840]  bullied it's a total lie but again that's the leftist cosmology where they're the downtrodden
[1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:12.000]  they're the bullied so they've got a lie and they've got a cheat and they've got a press
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.920]  language and they've got a brainwash kids and they've got to take over the universities
[1:13:14.920 --> 1:13:17.440]  they've got to take over the media they've got to take over big tech because they're
[1:13:17.440 --> 1:13:22.080]  defending the downtrodden they just make it up because they're the bullies they're the
[1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:27.560]  liars they're the frauds and so they keep doubling down it's not working so you've got
[1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:32.760]  to ask what are they going to do next they're now trying to implement violence they're now
[1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:38.480]  trying to get other people to go out and carry out violent attacks and when you see the unborn
[1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:42.560]  being killed and babies already born being killed and their body parts sold when you
[1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:48.000]  see pedophilia on the news and major universities like San Diego state saying no pedophilia
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:52.800]  is good in mainline classes it makes you angry do you think they're taking over we've got
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:57.240]  to do something we've got to fight they're losing people are waking up so they're doing
[1:13:57.240 --> 1:14:02.400]  all this to spur us into physical revolution and it's made me physically angry and physically
[1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:06.240]  you know very upset but that's because our heads are screwed on straight and the enemy
[1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:11.400]  knows that so they're trying to focus we need to sue these people politically expose them
[1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:15.680]  create our own media promote independent media and never give up and know that we're going
[1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:18.680]  to win now they're going to try to start wars you see that going on right now they're going
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:21.640]  to try to crash the economy they've admitted they're doing that they're trying to pull
[1:14:21.640 --> 1:14:26.480]  out every stop they can to keep control of civilization but I'm here to tell them you
[1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:32.480]  thought you'd bullied us into submission we were asleep now we're awake and you keep
[1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:36.920]  bullying more and more going why don't we submit we're not followers comebacks like

[1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:03.880]  some of the clips you've seen what democrats like bido aurora have called for with the
[1:21:03.880 --> 1:21:11.240]  gun confiscation they want to enslave you yes if somebody comes to your door and tells
[1:21:11.240 --> 1:21:18.960]  you can have a gun and takes it you're a slave now people tend to take that word and only
[1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:24.600]  apply it towards one type of slavery but no believe me if you don't have the right to
[1:21:24.600 --> 1:21:31.400]  arm yourself and protect yourself you have no rights and maybe you're not a slave out

[1:22:25.920 --> 1:22:32.480]  announced her campaign about a week ago and she's already having her videos removed so
[1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:40.280]  she's not allowed to run as a conservative so this is what's happening story goes a shocking
[1:22:40.280 --> 1:22:45.920]  new video report exposes how the widespread big tech censorship of the conservatives
[1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:52.800]  was a sheen hatched by silicon valley and democrat lawmakers from the very start the mass banning
[1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:57.240]  and censorship of info wars and other conservative personalities and news outlets was preceded
[1:22:57.240 --> 1:23:03.840]  by democrats in congress demanding blanket silencing in the name of stopping hate and
[1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:11.120]  harassment of course that's all you get if you're a conservative like for example people
[1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:19.840]  post videos of me being harassed on youtube and then i can't even post them myself of
[1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:28.600]  course it had it all had to do of course it all had nothing to do with that and everything
[1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:34.320]  to do with the fallout from trumps 2016 success and preventing him from winning reelection
[1:23:34.320 --> 1:23:40.560]  in 2020 yeah we've said it here before trumps not running against the democrat party trump
[1:23:40.560 --> 1:23:46.040]  is running against big tech and social media and silicon valley the long term goal is to
[1:23:46.040 --> 1:23:50.960]  prevent anyone other than democrats winning ever again by defaming financially sabotaging
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:57.280]  and digitally disappearing their ideological adversaries virtually and you gotta ask why
[1:23:57.280 --> 1:24:01.240]  what is really behind it when you're that evil virtually everyone who helped elect
[1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:05.920]  trump in 2020 is now imprisoned in a digital gulag to one degree or another with the next
[1:24:05.920 --> 1:24:10.960]  wave focused on blocking you even having the right to a bank account or to engage in basic
[1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:15.120]  commerce that's right again info wars banned off all social media alex jones banned off
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:24.520]  all social media i'm banned off youtube i'm banned off facebook i can't get on instagram
[1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:29.000]  republican candidates are getting censored and banned even tolsie gabbert is dealing
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:34.640]  with this because she doesn't like war who are these people censoring by the way you
[1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:38.440]  won't believe a clip that we have from cnn coming up you you literally won't believe
[1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:49.120]  this folks but now that they realize it was social media no pun intended trumping cable
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:53.840]  news they realize okay we have to censor social media now the end game is a communist chinese
[1:24:53.840 --> 1:25:00.400]  style social credit score where any american who expresses views outside ring fenced norms
[1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:06.080]  is punished imagine a future where you go to buy groceries and your credit card gets declined
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:10.400]  because some pencil neck in silicon valley didn't like your politically incorrect facebook
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:15.680]  post or imagine if you're not even allowed on facebook where the digital currency is
[1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:22.200]  and commerce is engaged in you literally can't even exist that's our collective destiny unless
[1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:27.560]  we stop it now our entire lives and our very thought processes dictated to us by the very
[1:25:27.560 --> 1:25:34.520]  worst people in society the trump administration must act now to address big tech censorship
[1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:40.800]  and deplatforming otherwise control feaks hell bent on socially reengineering the population
[1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:48.320]  will cement their power from decades to come by the way trump is on his way to san francisco
[1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:54.840]  right now trump has a campaign event happening in san francisco at an undisclosed location
[1:25:54.840 --> 1:26:02.360]  that's gonna be happening today so what do you say to president trump who's ultimately
[1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:05.920]  going to be one of the biggest victims of this the real victim is america the real victim
[1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:11.480]  is free speech the real victim is the first amendment and just freedom in general and
[1:26:11.480 --> 1:26:19.600]  communication but it's all targeted at trump and so what do you do if you're the president
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:35.860]  right now you know how do you how do you properly roll this out how do you properly get this
[1:26:35.860 --> 1:26:42.360]  message out because quite frankly it's getting redundant at this point we all know about
[1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:47.720]  the social media censorship we've all seen the project veritas videos kind of like member
[1:26:47.720 --> 1:26:54.520]  nick dudich from the new york times the project veritas caught on a hidden camera talking about
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:59.600]  how yeah we're biased yeah we print fake news yeah we don't we don't care it just is again
[1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:04.760]  a cabinol they're popping they're popping champagne at the new york times today they're
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:10.200]  not feeling bad or remorseful about their fake news destroying people's lives no no
[1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:14.280]  no no that's what the new york times is there to do again project veritas caught them on
[1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:20.680]  a hot mic they admitted at all no the new york times did understand what it did the national
[1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:24.960]  review headline says the new york times still doesn't understand what it did oh no it does
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:30.800]  it does it knows exactly what it did these are henchmen these are not journalists these
[1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:38.080]  are political henchmen caught on a hot mic admitting that again project veritas caught
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:49.120]  them and you see I sit here and I get all flimpy and mad why because what is the president
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:28:01.920]  going to do about it now again it's tough to talk about this folks because we still
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:07.240]  support trump we still need trump to be the man we elected but my goodness it's kind of
[1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:11.160]  almost I hate to say I told you so so thing but I don't want to be right that's the thing
[1:28:11.160 --> 1:28:15.280]  this is one of those cases where I want to be wrong and so it's hard for me to say this
[1:28:15.280 --> 1:28:21.960]  stuff because I want to be wrong which is rare for me but man oh man seems like I was right
[1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:29.800]  the social media summit was nothing more than a pat on the head and a dog bone no action
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:33.320]  we've got 50 states attorney generals with an anti-trust probe where's that going where's
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:39.600]  the update on that we've had trump tweeting about the censorship multiple times brad parskill
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:46.400]  says he's going to do something about the censorship but he's never heard of info wars
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:50.600]  president trump you are not running against the democrat party they have nothing you're
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:56.320]  running against silicon valley you're running against big tech investigate these criminals

[1:30:26.280 --> 1:30:32.600]  mortal flawed human beings that need to seek God's countenance God's discernment and to
[1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:38.160]  pray for peace and to pray for transparency and to pray that the very twisted evil forces
[1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:43.560]  on this planet trying to start a world war will be exposed to their attempts at creating

[1:32:52.520 --> 1:33:00.120]  and your family spread the word about info wars dot com the live shows right now you're
[1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:12.520]  listening to the alex jones show the left tries to threaten bully intimidate americans
[1:33:12.520 --> 1:33:21.280]  into submission they use democrat prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever
[1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:28.840]  they can they'll do whatever they can to demean you to libel you they try to blacklist coerce
[1:33:28.840 --> 1:33:36.480]  cancel or destroy anyone who gets in their way look at what they're doing today to justice
[1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:47.920]  cavanaugh look at what they're doing did you see the new york times did you see what
[1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:53.200]  they're doing did you see what democrats they're calling for his resignation they're calling
[1:33:53.200 --> 1:34:00.400]  for his impeachment and the woman involved said she didn't know anything she doesn't
[1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:06.400]  but they still so the new york times had to put out a major apology and they had to change
[1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:13.880]  their story the woman said I don't remember that table and they still want them to be
[1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:22.600]  impeached and I just put out a statement and he's a great man by the way great talent
[1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:34.440]  a great brilliant man Brett and I just put out a statement on social media that said
[1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:38.520]  I don't think they'll do it but they should for the good of the nation I call for the
[1:34:38.520 --> 1:34:48.640]  resignation of everybody at the new york times involved in the cabinet and while you're
[1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:58.640]  at it the russian witch hunt hoax which is just as phony a story they've taken the old
[1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:04.240]  gray lady do you know the new york times for years the old gray lady so prestigious they've
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:12.960]  taken the old great lady and broken her down destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation
[1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:18.600]  well that's a breath of fresh air trump needs to go on a major offense against not just
[1:35:18.600 --> 1:35:25.320]  big tech censorship but the culture of bullying and intimidation carried out by the left and
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:31.080]  by its hollywood and chai com backers it's sick not just what I've gone through not
[1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:35.080]  just what trump's family has gone through but what the average trump supporter or someone
[1:35:35.080 --> 1:35:39.200]  who's proud of america has gone through the article by steve watchens up on news wars
[1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:45.080]  dot com trump slam's leftist cancel culture at new mexico rally the left tries to threaten
[1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:51.400]  bully intimidate americans into submission you just saw the clip but that's really what's
[1:35:51.400 --> 1:35:57.560]  happening think about how they've terrorized judge cabinon fact i was saying it was seven
[1:35:57.560 --> 1:36:04.560]  accusers yesterday actually looked it up it's nine accusers three of them have come out
[1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:08.960]  and admitted they never did it only one of them has been criminally charged again three
[1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:13.480]  of us said they made it up but they're like well he deserved it because you know he's
[1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:17.880]  a right-winger and he's pro-life and then balazi's ford's lawyer comes out two weeks
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:21.960]  ago and says well we did this to try to you know stop him from getting in but at least
[1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:28.840]  he's tainted now you know we did this to discredit him basically admitting they're lying and
[1:36:28.840 --> 1:36:36.960]  then now this newest woman never met cabinon never saw him that remembers none of this
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:41.640]  and that's the new york times his source who was never contacted and when she was it's
[1:36:41.640 --> 1:36:47.200]  totally made up and of course it's two former clinton operatives who work for clinton who
[1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:52.800]  were the sources to the la times and the new york times and the washington post passed
[1:36:52.800 --> 1:36:59.160]  on it and then no one even gets in trouble that's what's scary is that they know they
[1:36:59.160 --> 1:37:04.440]  can lie and let me tell you i'm not a victim here but when i explained to you just how
[1:37:04.440 --> 1:37:09.720]  evil they are i know you think you don't and and you may know but when you're a public
[1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:16.640]  figure and it's free reign open season to make up whatever they want about you it doesn't
[1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:21.680]  make me feel sorry for myself it pisses me off that these arrogant people think they're
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:28.000]  invincible and you get away with this but guess what they're not they are discredited
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:33.760]  even their fake polls show that mainstream media is the most unpopular group in the
[1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:38.680]  country congressmen and women are usually at about 11 percent depending on the poll these
[1:37:38.680 --> 1:37:44.320]  are establishment polls probably even lower the media has been as low as 7 percent in
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:48.960]  their own polls about themselves they're at 15 to 20 percent so in their own fake polls
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:55.000]  15 to 20 percent of people like them so they have discredited themselves like a restaurant
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:58.840]  where every time you go to it you get food poisoning well that place wouldn't stay open
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:03.280]  would it well so same thing for the new york times newsweek used to be bigger than new
[1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:07.080]  york times and was somewhat respected 20 years ago newsweek went out of business a few years
[1:38:07.080 --> 1:38:12.520]  ago and was sold for almost no money to some internet group that's even lying more today
[1:38:12.520 --> 1:38:17.480]  with fake news newsweek's gone folks it doesn't even exist the real newsweek the new york
[1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:22.720]  times was propped up by the kingpin carlos slim who got three billion dollars of taxpayer
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:29.160]  money from obama he ran the obama phone system a foreigner whether it's been in the world
[1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:33.800]  and his payoff to profit the new york times was three billion dollars now he's gone now
[1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:38.840]  they've got new sugar daddies and the sugar daddies want trump removed the powerful ultra
[1:38:38.840 --> 1:38:43.560]  rich want him gone why is that because he's actually being the president doesn't mean
[1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:48.040]  every policy engages in is perfect doesn't mean he's an angel but he still believes in
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:51.640]  the country and that's why they're pissed and that's the key you notice what else he said
[1:38:51.640 --> 1:38:56.520]  in that clip we're not gonna violate our precious second amendment it's not going anywhere
[1:38:56.520 --> 1:39:01.960]  I told you I talked to two mra board members one on the phone one in person they told me
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:06.560]  over a year ago trump is gonna play games with them he's gonna come out when they want gun
[1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:11.600]  control and say sure what do you want to get them to say we want to ban all the guns and
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:17.440]  I gotta say 3d chess I was thinking about this this morning that's 3d chess because
[1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:23.240]  him saying oh yeah what do you want you're right we want everything we want it now hell
[1:39:23.240 --> 1:39:27.440]  yes we're gonna take your 15s and the democrats are all on the stage the debate last week in
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:33.080]  houston going back oh thank you for your courage we love you take all the guns oh you're so
[1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:39.480]  good so I gotta say trump is playing 3d chess with these people it really is true I'll tell
[1:39:39.480 --> 1:39:43.560]  you who else is playing 3d chess and that's the deep state Obama and Kerry and Hillary
[1:39:43.560 --> 1:39:47.440]  are openly engaged in treason trump's been complaining for three years working with
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:52.240]  Iran giving them the data and telling them how to set trump up and make him look like
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:57.160]  a fool and again I said earlier in the show I've talked to a lot of people I respect one
[1:39:57.160 --> 1:40:02.000]  of them said around over there smart guy I can put him on camera maybe we will and they
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:05.920]  all believe that it's just like they tried to set up Jimmy Carter in the late 70s successfully
[1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:09.080]  working with Tehran the deep state to make him look like a fool just like they set up
[1:40:09.080 --> 1:40:13.680]  Kennedy in the Bay of Pigs making him look like a fool that trumps being maneuvered by
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:19.360]  Obama and the globalist and Iran's been told go ahead launch cruise missiles attacks have
[1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:27.400]  your rebels take the blame for it credit and then that way keep grabbing ships and our
[1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:32.480]  military so discredited because of what we've done to it that's Obama and Hillary and Bush
[1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:37.480]  senior that they won't believe Iran attacked us even when they do and then we'll maneuver
[1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:43.080]  trump into a disaster that plunges the US economy which is their goal and that's the
[1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:47.520]  key report that's up on infowars.com from Michael Snyder very important report where
[1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:53.640]  he lays out that what is it the majority in fact almost all of the major recessions we've
[1:40:53.640 --> 1:40:59.080]  had the last 50 years came after massive spikes in oil prices and so you've seen the private
[1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:03.200]  Federal Reserve wanting to plunge the economy you've seen Bill Maher saying plunge the economy
[1:41:03.200 --> 1:41:06.920]  you've seen Democrats all over saying the economy needs to be taken down to defeat this
[1:41:06.920 --> 1:41:11.760]  populist uprising and to punish the American people and now they're doing it and that's
[1:41:11.760 --> 1:41:16.840]  what this is all about so a lot of my listeners are saying Alex we think every event is a
[1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:21.480]  false flag and so we think this is Israel doing this or we think it's Saudi Arabia doing
[1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:25.680]  this and certainly those countries have stayed false flags before but if you look at what's
[1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:31.000]  really going on these are cruise missiles out of Iran Iran's rebels already took blame
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:36.160]  so that Iran can get away with an attack and then lure Trump in even though it's well known
[1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:42.320]  by the military that Iran actually did this to then set up Trump that's the real plan
[1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:47.160]  that's what's going on and it's my job to give you my best analysis from a historical
[1:41:47.160 --> 1:41:53.520]  understanding of what's really happening so I do not want to strike Iran but half of Saudi
[1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:58.120]  Arabia's oil supply was just taken out 5% of the world supply and it's meant to kill the
[1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:02.200]  markets and Trump comes out and says hey we got plenty of oil don't panic because almost
[1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:05.880]  every time this happens it causes a global recession which the globalists admit they
[1:42:05.880 --> 1:42:09.760]  want right now to teach all the populists around the world to sit out and shut up so
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:13.960]  the big banks could come in with more banker bailouts with our own tax money to take control
[1:42:13.960 --> 1:42:19.880]  of our lives so let's think about the reality of what's unfolding here and realize this
[1:42:19.880 --> 1:42:24.360]  is the geopolitical manipulations that we're in a proxy war with China and that it's the
[1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:34.440]  US, India, the UK against radical Islam, the globalist, the chai comms, the Hollywood
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:39.240]  leftist movement who is allied with Iran and so yes we made an alliance with Saudi Arabia
[1:42:39.240 --> 1:42:43.000]  Saudi Arabia is corrupt, they're out of control, they were involved in 9-11, Saudi Arabia
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:48.040]  helped destroy ISIS in al-Qaeda which they were running, as a way to prove to Trump they're
[1:42:48.040 --> 1:42:51.200]  not going to play games, Trump said you stop it right now I'm going to overthrow you, they
[1:42:51.200 --> 1:43:17.480]  are going to destroy you, they're going to destroy you, they're going to destroy you,
[1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:46.840]  they're going to destroy you, they're going to destroy you,
[1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:52.480]  to shut us down. And that's why you are more critical than ever to support the InfoWare.

[1:47:00.120 --> 1:47:10.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Mr. Chews between two admittedly regrettable
[1:47:10.200 --> 1:47:15.320]  but nevertheless distinguishable post war environments. One where you got 20 million
[1:47:15.320 --> 1:47:19.400]  people killed and the other where you got 150 million people killed. You're talking about
[1:47:19.400 --> 1:47:25.320]  mass murder, General. Not war. Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair must
[1:47:25.320 --> 1:47:32.480]  but I do say no more than 10 to 20 million killed tops depending on the breaks. I will
[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:37.120]  not go down in history as the greatest mass murder since Adolf Hitler. Perhaps it might
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:40.800]  be better, Mr. President, if you were more concerned with the American people than with
[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:44.880]  your image in the history books. General Churcheson, I think I've heard quite sufficient from
[1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:51.000]  you. Thank you very much. Mr. President, they have the ambassador waiting upstairs. Oh good.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  Any difficulty? They say he's having a fit about that squad of MPs. Well, that can't
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:48:00.280]  be helped. Haven't brought down here straight away. Yes, sir. Is that the Russian ambassador
[1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:08.280]  you're talking about? Yes, it is, General. Am I to understand the Russian ambassadors
[1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:17.360]  to be admitted entrance to the war room? That is correct. He is here on my orders. I don't
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:21.080]  know exactly how to put this, sir, but are you aware of what a serious breach of security
[1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:28.200]  that would be? I mean, you'll see everything. You'll see the big board. That is precisely
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:37.560]  the idea, General. That is precisely the idea. Stains, get Premier Kisrop on the hotline.
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:44.800]  Charles Cupperman was the attaché of the outgoing head National Security Advisor to
[1:48:44.800 --> 1:48:51.360]  President Trump, John Bolton. And this gentleman gave interviews and wrote articles back in
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:59.040]  1982 where he was quoted as saying the United States could survive a nuclear war and only
[1:48:59.040 --> 1:49:07.520]  get 10 to 20 million tops killed. Now, how did he basically exactly quote from the fictional
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:12.160]  film, Dr. Strangelove, released in the early 1960s? Well, Kubrick did his research, ladies
[1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:17.440]  and gentlemen. The article is from Paul Joseph Watson. It's up on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[1:49:17.440 --> 1:49:22.880]  New National Security Advisor once said U.S. could take losing 20 million people in a nuclear
[1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:28.240]  war. I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair must. So he's now basically quoting the fictitious
[1:49:28.240 --> 1:49:34.120]  general played by George C. Scott in that famous film. You got to go read these quotes
[1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:39.400]  for yourself. They're absolutely incredible. And they were even talking about a preemptive
[1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:44.720]  war starting one with the Soviets becoming more evil than even they were. So this is
[1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:50.480]  the type of insanity that still reigns in some of these neocon brains. David Knight
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:55.400]  yesterday got into a similar subject that the U.S. government actually had a plan to
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:59.680]  survive a nuclear war at the end of the world as we know it. And once his wife and children
[1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:04.400]  actually went down the wrong road and actually visited one of these continual government
[1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:09.680]  facilities. So I want to go to this report from David Knight. But you're actually seeing
[1:50:09.680 --> 1:50:15.160]  the evidence laid out here by him of the fact that the establishment believes they can survive
[1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:21.400]  Doomsday. Be it AI, be it bio weapons, be it nuclear war. In fact, they're even romanticizing
[1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:26.240]  the post-human world and how good a nuclear war would be to get rid of us. Like MI6 and
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:31.080]  the OSS officer in Fleming that wrote Moonraker kind of giving you an idea about how the elite
[1:50:31.080 --> 1:50:34.840]  fantasize about going to the moon or space while they kill all of us here and then come
[1:50:34.840 --> 1:50:39.360]  back and create a new garden of Eden. So here is David Knight's powerful report. But whatever
[1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:43.760]  you do after watching this, we're going to post it at m4s.com. Share this important video
[1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:46.640]  because people aren't going to believe it unless they see the facts themselves.
[1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:51.080]  And folks, this isn't, you know, we've always talked about mutually assured destruction.
[1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:55.440]  The people in the Pentagon rarely never believed that. They believed that it wasn't going to
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:50:59.280]  be mutual destruction. They believed they could win this war.
[1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:04.600]  And in the 1980s, the guy who has taken John Bolton's place was one of the biggest advocates
[1:51:04.600 --> 1:51:09.800]  of, hey, yeah, we could lose a few million here and a few million there. And right now,
[1:51:09.800 --> 1:51:14.400]  you've got all these people in the Pentagon telling President Trump, I imagine if we were
[1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:20.920]  to tune into the discussions right now, it would kind of look like the war room discussions
[1:51:20.920 --> 1:51:25.920]  of General Buck Tergeson from Dr. Strangeloff. Remember this? Play that clip.
[1:51:25.920 --> 1:51:31.920]  I'm sorry. It's a part of the good. See, I mean, I mean, if he's really sharp, he can
[1:51:31.920 --> 1:51:37.920]  barrel that baby in solo. You ought to see it sometime. It's a big brain, like a 52 room.
[1:51:37.920 --> 1:51:43.920]  It's jet exhaust, frying tickets in the barn. Yeah, but has he got a chance? Has he got
[1:51:43.920 --> 1:51:53.360]  a chance? Yeah, actually, he does. Actually, he does. And this is the kind of these guys
[1:51:53.360 --> 1:52:01.280]  get swept away with the military weapons systems. I mean, this Dr. Strangeloff was a black comedy,
[1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:06.160]  but it was very dark because it was based on reality. We go back and take a look. If
[1:52:06.160 --> 1:52:10.560]  you really want to know the history of this, the real history of this, take a look at the
[1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:15.720]  book called Raven Rock. The subtitle of it was the story of the US government's secret
[1:52:15.720 --> 1:52:22.800]  plan to save itself while the rest of us die. One of the hardened facilities for AT&T, which
[1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:28.760]  was a secret partner with the US military back in the 1960s, one of the secret sites
[1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:34.000]  that they had that was right in the beginning of this book and the introduction was a place
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:38.640]  called Big Hole, not too far from where I used to live in North Carolina. And of course,
[1:52:38.640 --> 1:52:42.240]  we were all told, oh, that's been shut down years ago in the Cold War. And we shut that
[1:52:42.240 --> 1:52:47.680]  down. And the people who were highly connected and politics, the mayor and all that, they
[1:52:47.680 --> 1:52:54.240]  had all worked at that facility, that hardened underground facility. And so one day, my wife
[1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:58.760]  and sons decided that they would go down that road. You remember that Travis? You guys went
[1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:07.040]  down that road. And all of a sudden, the station that was still there, everybody was saying,
[1:53:07.040 --> 1:53:10.560]  oh, it's been abandoned and everything. All of a sudden, loudspeakers come on, turn back,
[1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:15.600]  turn back. You're going to authorize yourself. What did they tell you, Travis? Are you there?
[1:53:15.600 --> 1:53:20.600]  I do remember it. It's a little bit vague, but I do remember the fact that they had a
[1:53:20.600 --> 1:53:26.200]  guard tower with a spotlight and many armed guards for a facility that was supposedly defunct
[1:53:26.200 --> 1:53:32.640]  for years. That's right. That's right. And later on, that was probably six or seven years
[1:53:32.640 --> 1:53:37.440]  before everybody started talking about that facility in New York City. They said, look
[1:53:37.440 --> 1:53:43.400]  at this. It looks like some kind of a Soviet fortress style, brutal architecture. We have
[1:53:43.400 --> 1:53:48.240]  the exposed concrete walls with no windows and so forth, right smack dab in the middle
[1:53:48.240 --> 1:53:52.560]  of New York City. And it was one of those facilities. It wasn't hardened and underground
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:57.160]  like the one in North Carolina. And there were multiple ones of those in North Carolina.
[1:53:57.160 --> 1:54:03.560]  But they had a plan where they believed that they could initiate a nuclear war and they
[1:54:03.560 --> 1:54:10.880]  could survive it. As a matter of fact, Cupperman, this guy who is now in John Bolton's place,
[1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:16.720]  going back to the 1980s, he was talking about when he was part of the Reagan administration,
[1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:20.960]  he was talking about the fact that he thought that nuclear conflict with Russia, actually
[1:54:20.960 --> 1:54:26.560]  the Soviet Union at that time was winnable. And he said, quote, nuclear war is a destructive
[1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:33.560]  thing, but it's still in large part a physics problem. And he took this position of John
[1:54:33.560 --> 1:54:38.600]  Bolton last Tuesday. Here we are about a week later, and we're ready to blow up the world's
[1:54:38.600 --> 1:54:44.840]  energy supplies and start a global war, because Russia and China are going to be involved
[1:54:44.840 --> 1:54:50.080]  in this as well. What he talked about at the time, you know, this physics problem that
[1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:55.920]  he talked about, he said, well, I can imagine a scenario where only 20 million people in
[1:54:55.920 --> 1:55:02.920]  America died, only 20 million Americans died, as opposed to 150 million. He says if it was
[1:55:02.920 --> 1:55:11.200]  only 20 million people, then the nation could then emerge stronger and could prevail in the
[1:55:11.200 --> 1:55:17.520]  objectives, right? Just like Dr. Strangelove. With enough planning, this is, I mean, this
[1:55:17.520 --> 1:55:25.040]  is not Dr. Strangelove now. I am reading you what the guy who took John Bolton's place
[1:55:25.040 --> 1:55:30.240]  in the White House and the Trump administration said, with enough planning and civil defense
[1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:37.200]  measures such as, quote, a certain layer of dirt and some reinforced construction materials,
[1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:41.640]  the effects of nuclear war could be limited, and the US would be able to fairly quickly
[1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:48.520]  rebuild itself after an all out conflict with the Soviet Union. It might take 15 years,
[1:55:48.520 --> 1:55:53.480]  but geez, look how long it took Europe to recover after the Second World War. And then
[1:55:53.480 --> 1:56:00.840]  he talked about Hiroshima, which was one of the two cities that was bombed to end the
[1:56:00.840 --> 1:56:05.120]  Second World War. He said, Hiroshima, after it was bombed, it was backed up and operating
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:10.200]  three days later. I hadn't noticed that. I hadn't noticed that. Yeah, no problem at
[1:56:10.200 --> 1:56:17.360]  all. Doesn't matter if I, to look at how life imitates art, let's go back to Dr. Strangelove,
[1:56:17.360 --> 1:56:20.960]  because that's what this guy literally sounds like. Play the other clip of the actual Dr.
[1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:29.320]  Strangelove. Mr. President, I would not rule out the chance to preserve a nucleus of human
[1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:42.360]  specimens. It would be quite easy. At the bottom of some of our deeper mineshafts, radioactivity
[1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:48.240]  would never penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep. And in a matter of weeks, sufficient
[1:56:48.240 --> 1:56:53.600]  improvements in drilling space could easily be provided. How long would you have to stay
[1:56:53.600 --> 1:57:05.720]  down there? Well, let's see now. How about Saryamji? Yeah, it's just a physics problem.
[1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:20.400]  We can calculate this, huh? Yeah, let me get out my slide rule here. Even if it's in that
[1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:27.400]  possibly 100 years. No problem at all. You know, and he says, hey, look, we were told
[1:57:27.400 --> 1:57:32.200]  at the time, if you see a nuclear flash in a city, you know, try to get out of the city
[1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:37.400]  if the bombs are coming in. Just get into a ditch. You'll be okay. Maybe a little bit
[1:57:37.400 --> 1:57:50.640]  of dirt too. I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:56.360]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at Info Wars. And we are the individuals
[1:57:56.360 --> 1:57:59.640]  that have done the research to understand the global spattle plan. And we know how to
[1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:04.680]  take them down. That's why they're so upset. Think how far we've come together. You know,
[1:58:04.680 --> 1:58:09.160]  even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because the right thing to do against
[1:58:09.160 --> 1:58:14.760]  the truly satanic forces of the New World Order who've really taken the mask off, the
[1:58:14.760 --> 1:58:19.600]  lines in the sand for everybody now. But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and
[1:58:19.600 --> 1:58:23.720]  to stand with God and to stand with the unborn. I just want to take time out again to salute
[1:58:23.720 --> 1:58:29.240]  the audience because you are truly activist in the arena. And without you and your prayers

[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:38.120]  operation would not be here. We've got some giant specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com.

[2:00:11.960 --> 2:00:32.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Alex is going to be rejoining us in the next segment
[2:00:32.760 --> 2:00:39.680]  with a breaking report on the AI rollout that is coming, but I wanted to play this clip
[2:00:39.680 --> 2:00:44.320]  here in this short segment and then we're going to open up the phone lines coming up
[2:00:44.320 --> 2:00:54.160]  as well. You won't believe what Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo were saying on CNN last night
[2:00:54.160 --> 2:00:59.840]  is a pinch yourself moment. This is CNN that has Brian Seltter, Oliver Darcy and other
[2:00:59.840 --> 2:01:06.680]  nitwit losers trying to censor anyone who goes against their politics, which is take
[2:01:06.680 --> 2:01:13.520]  the guns, silence conservatives, America sucks. And so they have been openly calling
[2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:19.120]  for censorship. They have been openly promoting censorship. Oliver Darcy is one of the king
[2:01:19.120 --> 2:01:25.560]  rats when it comes to flagging people to have them removed. I mean, CNN is literally the
[2:01:25.560 --> 2:01:35.320]  rabid, cancerous, feral, malnourished guard dog foaming at the mouth to censor anybody
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:42.720]  who doesn't look as disgusting and hideous as them. So I must be dreaming when I tune
[2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:49.800]  in to CNN and I hear this conversation between Don Lemon and Fredo Cuomo.
[2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:55.640]  Great. Keep it pure. I just, I hate the whole cancel culture. I hate the whole and I hate
[2:01:55.640 --> 2:02:04.240]  going back and restart it. Dude, CNN is literally the cancel culture. You guys have no ratings
[2:02:04.240 --> 2:02:10.080]  except for the money you pay to be in airports and hotels. No one watches you. You're a known
[2:02:10.080 --> 2:02:18.840]  joke. You're a known empty husk. You are the cancel culture. You cancel yourself. You promote
[2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:24.760]  the cancel culture without the cancel culture. You won't even exist. But again, listen to
[2:02:24.760 --> 2:02:31.400]  Don Lemon and Fredo Cuomo. Great. Keep it pure. I just, I hate the whole cancel culture.
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:37.120]  I hate the whole and I hate going back and listen to think about this. Think about if
[2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:42.760]  Richard Pryor or Lenny Bruce or even Eddie Murphy were coming up now. Do you remember
[2:02:42.760 --> 2:02:49.120]  that you know what that they would say? A lot of racist stuff. A lot of homophobic stuff.
[2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:53.000]  A lot of it. They pushed the envelopes. Lenny Bruce would get got arrested for some of the
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:56.920]  things. You think all the family would be on today? Exactly. So I mean, people. So the
[2:02:56.920 --> 2:03:00.320]  whole, you think the Jeffersons would be on today? Exactly. They'd let Sherman housing
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:06.000]  here. Rest in peace. Do George Jefferson the way he did it then? You think they would
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:12.640]  let George Jefferson say inward please on television now? Or when Chevy Chase and Richard
[2:03:12.640 --> 2:03:18.840]  Pryor pushed the limits on SNL by that whole inward sketch that they did, that would not,
[2:03:18.840 --> 2:03:22.240]  that wouldn't be allowed on television right now. And something is wrong with that because
[2:03:22.240 --> 2:03:27.040]  those were learning moments, teachable moments. Who are we? And who are we? Everybody's a
[2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:30.720]  little too. What happens when we're tested? How do we feel about it? How do we respond?
[2:03:30.720 --> 2:03:34.280]  What do we embrace? What do we reject? I think everyone's a little too sensitive. And I think
[2:03:34.280 --> 2:03:38.800]  going back in the past for every little thing that someone did, no one would have a job.
[2:03:38.800 --> 2:03:45.560]  Nobody. Nobody. Because everyone says stupid things. Everyone does something that's boneheaded
[2:03:45.560 --> 2:03:53.840]  from now and then. And so I think we have to be for. Oh my gosh. So here's CNN. I mean,
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:04:00.440]  guys, pull up a story about how CNN celebrates the censorship online. Folks, Oliver Darcy
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:06.880]  is well known in Silicon Valley as like the king rat. Like there's an old cartoon called
[2:04:06.880 --> 2:04:11.960]  recess. If you're about my age, I'm about, I'm 30. If you're around my age, some of the
[2:04:11.960 --> 2:04:16.440]  crew here is you probably remember the cartoon recess. Remember the cartoon recess? There's
[2:04:16.440 --> 2:04:22.520]  a character called Randall in recess. You know, Randall was a worm. Randall was a narc.
[2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:29.240]  Randall was a rat. Nobody liked Randall. Kind of like Don Lemon. They sit around. They look
[2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:33.520]  at people they don't like all day. And then they go to the principal and say, this person
[2:04:33.520 --> 2:04:40.480]  did this. Make sure you have them removed. That's literally CNN with Oliver Darcy, who
[2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:46.200]  looks like he just ate the, you know what, out of the behind of a possum and enjoyed
[2:04:46.200 --> 2:04:50.840]  it. And he goes around celebrating censorship. And then they're going to complain about the
[2:04:50.840 --> 2:04:55.280]  cancel culture that CNN literally created. Wow.

[2:06:19.160 --> 2:06:29.960]  A lot of things developing today. The Democrats call for gun confiscation has only sold more
[2:06:29.960 --> 2:06:37.640]  guns in America. 15% was the number last week. I would bet it's more than that now. Where
[2:06:37.640 --> 2:06:43.680]  you have multiple gun stores literally rolling out Beto specials and selling out of their
[2:06:43.680 --> 2:06:55.200]  rifles in less than four hours. You are a joke, Beto. I mean, you are such a joke. It's
[2:06:55.200 --> 2:07:03.120]  not even measurable, quite frankly. So that's one thing we're seeing developed. So yeah,
[2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:06.600]  you called for the confiscation of firearms. Now there's about two million more you'll
[2:07:06.600 --> 2:07:14.960]  have to confiscate from our cold dead hands. You bastards. You bastards you would ever come
[2:07:14.960 --> 2:07:20.920]  for our guns. Here's a better idea. Why don't you just move? You don't like guns. Get the
[2:07:20.920 --> 2:07:29.160]  hell out because they're not going anywhere. I mean, seriously, I just don't get it, man.
[2:07:29.160 --> 2:07:34.960]  I just really don't understand it. Then you have Ilhan Omar, married your brother, committed
[2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:42.240]  immigration fraud, committed tax fraud. This is a leader of the Democrat Party, a known
[2:07:42.240 --> 2:07:49.280]  criminal, married her own brother. I just want to know if she, I mean, did she consummate
[2:07:49.280 --> 2:08:00.880]  the marriage folks? Let's be real. There is a chance Ilhan Omar engaged in incest. How
[2:08:00.880 --> 2:08:08.040]  do you like that, Democrats? But they'll deny it. Then you have the New York Times printing
[2:08:08.040 --> 2:08:16.240]  known fake news against Brett Kavanaugh. Their quote unquote source was actually reached
[2:08:16.240 --> 2:08:20.960]  out to during the original investigations into the accusations. She declined to be a part
[2:08:20.960 --> 2:08:24.320]  of it. Then she said, I have nothing to do with this. Please don't involve me. Well,
[2:08:24.320 --> 2:08:28.480]  the New York Times drug her out of the nothingness and put her in a story and claimed things
[2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:34.080]  about her that weren't true. Just like Kavanaugh and she's again saying, nope, nope, that's
[2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:40.800]  not me. Never claimed that. The New York Times attracts 24 hours later, but it's all too
[2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:46.280]  late by then. They knew it was fake. They run the headline. The average brainwashed Democrat
[2:08:46.280 --> 2:08:50.280]  voter, which I don't even know where they are anymore. I can't even find them. They're
[2:08:50.280 --> 2:08:57.680]  at Elizabeth Warren rallies. That's pretty much it. We'll actually believe that Brett
[2:08:57.680 --> 2:09:03.880]  Kavanaugh is a sexual deviant because the New York Times publishes fake news, retracts
[2:09:03.880 --> 2:09:09.480]  24 hours later. How many times is New York Times have to be proven fake news? Doesn't
[2:09:09.480 --> 2:09:19.120]  matter. Now, when we come back, Alex Jones is going to break down the real threat of
[2:09:19.120 --> 2:09:26.360]  the AI rollout. That's coming on the other side. As we just get more and more information
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:31.720]  about how the Democrats are working with the Silicon Valley to keep Trump from winning
[2:09:31.720 --> 2:09:40.080]  the 2020 election. And if the Trump administration doesn't move against that soon, we will have
[2:09:40.080 --> 2:09:50.600]  some serious problems, ladies and gentlemen, some serious, serious problems. You've got
[2:09:50.600 --> 2:10:01.760]  Democrats committing fake hate crimes like Jesse Smallette and Edon Lewis Kaufman staging
[2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:08.520]  their own hate crimes to try to start a civil war. This is the state of the Democrat Party.
[2:10:08.520 --> 2:10:16.440]  This is pure evil. Take your guns, lie to you to destroy their political adversaries,
[2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:23.240]  engage events to play the victim. I mean, this is literally if Satan could fill human
[2:10:23.240 --> 2:10:32.000]  bodies, it would be the average Democrat at this point. It really would. And that's
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:41.480]  not even to insult the average Democrat voter of, you know, say, 2016, 2012, whatever. Democrat
[2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:47.920]  parties change. They've gone full evil. Take the guns and free speech, lie to destroy your
[2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:56.760]  political adversaries, engage in big tech collusion to censor and silence free speech.
[2:10:56.760 --> 2:11:02.120]  That is literally the political operating system of the Democrat Party. Oh, I left
[2:11:02.120 --> 2:11:06.640]  something out. They also staged violence and riots. Forgot about that, too. They engage
[2:11:06.640 --> 2:11:11.880]  in domestic terror. In fact, the largest domestic terror group in the United States
[2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:19.960]  is the Democrat Party. I'll debate that forever. You can't show me a group of individuals in
[2:11:19.960 --> 2:11:27.800]  this country that has engaged in more terrorism than the Democrat Party with Antifa and with
[2:11:27.800 --> 2:11:33.320]  straight up Bob Kramer running riot gangs out of Chicago. That's all caught. That's
[2:11:33.320 --> 2:11:43.160]  all on record. That is the Democrat Party, ladies and gentlemen. They hate America.
[2:11:43.160 --> 2:11:57.360]  They hate you. And you know, I've been thinking about this, but I think we've reached a, I
[2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:03.600]  think we've reached a demarcation line now where, I mean, again, I'm not insulting Democrat
[2:12:03.600 --> 2:12:11.120]  voters of of yesteryear, but the average Democrat voter now is somebody who's all alone, no
[2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:18.440]  family, no desire to start a family, no girlfriend, no wife, no boyfriend, no husband, no kids,
[2:12:18.440 --> 2:12:22.640]  nothing. They just want to live in their own little selfish lives with their social media
[2:12:22.640 --> 2:12:28.120]  in their little pod cities in California, sip on a soy latte with their pinky out and
[2:12:28.120 --> 2:12:31.520]  claim they're intellectual when they are the biggest dumbasses you'll ever meet in your
[2:12:31.520 --> 2:12:36.480]  life. But because they have no desire for prosperity, because they have no desire to
[2:12:36.480 --> 2:12:41.840]  build a future, because they're totally destroyed by Satan, they want to bring down the rest
[2:12:41.840 --> 2:12:46.280]  of us. And so they use facade arguments like you're transphobic. If you don't want to pay
[2:12:46.280 --> 2:12:50.880]  for a dingling to be chopped off and a hole to be plugged in there. This is literally what
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:56.200]  they're doing. The state of California has now banned state funded travel to Iowa because
[2:12:56.200 --> 2:13:00.680]  they won't perform gender reassignment assignment surgery on a state dollar. That's the state
[2:13:00.680 --> 2:13:08.520]  of the Democrat Party. Ilhan Omar just decided she's going to side with Iran after the bombing
[2:13:08.520 --> 2:13:13.520]  or whatever happened on that oil field, which by the way, who's to say, in fact, I would
[2:13:13.520 --> 2:13:22.200]  almost bet money on it. I bet that John Kerry is running that strike on Saudi Arabia with
[2:13:22.200 --> 2:13:32.080]  his little Iranian counterparts. But hey, what do I know? So Alex Jones, when we come
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:37.440]  back is going to be breaking down the rollout of AI and the threats of humanity. But first
[2:13:37.440 --> 2:13:45.200]  folks over at infowarestore.com, we've got maybe the biggest specials we've ever had.
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:49.160]  I think it's probably the biggest specials we've ever had. It's pretty much a clearance
[2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:53.440]  sale and we're not really marketing it like that. But that's I mean, that's basically
[2:13:53.440 --> 2:13:58.880]  what it is. When we've got to get the gut health fusion pack on sale right now, seven
[2:13:58.880 --> 2:14:05.760]  different supplements. I believe the whole pack is 75% off right now. Don't forget about
[2:14:05.760 --> 2:14:14.440]  the brand new t shirt. Beto not. Beto not the brand new t shirt at infowarestore.com selling
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:20.360]  like hotcakes. Get your Beto not t shirt with the rifle Beto not under it and the lone
[2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:25.040]  star on top Beto says he wants to come take your guns by this t shirt. Give him the middle
[2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:32.040]  finger. You want to kick Beto in the nuts politically by this t shirt. You want to put
[2:14:32.040 --> 2:14:37.840]  your fist through Beto's face politically by this t shirt. You want to choke and strangle
[2:14:37.840 --> 2:14:42.720]  Beto O'Rourke till there's no breath in his lungs politically by this t shirt. Should
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:47.640]  I go on? Do you want to repeatedly stab a guy till he's bleeding out politically by
[2:14:47.640 --> 2:14:52.360]  this t shirt from infowarestore.com? I love Beto. I would never want any harm done to
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:58.360]  Beto ever. But politically, if you'd like to ring this guy's neck and break his leg
[2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:06.400]  and jaw politically, not physically, go to infowarestore.com and get the Beto not t shirt.
[2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:09.760]  And if you want to make sure I keep a job after saying that, maybe go buy a t shirt
[2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:15.040]  too because I may be on the chopping block politically. All right. So when we come back,
[2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:20.000]  Alex Jones is going to break down the AI rollout, which, you know, there's a lot of
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:27.800]  unknowns about the AI. How organic is AI and how influenced it is it by human behavior
[2:15:27.800 --> 2:15:32.720]  or by human algorithms. Is Silicon Valley going to roll out some AI that's a social
[2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:36.720]  justice warrior where if you say, man, I love the United States of America, we should have
[2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:42.280]  a southern border. You're deemed a terrorist. And then, you know, they send the cops to
[2:15:42.280 --> 2:15:46.280]  your door to take your guns away with the social credit score. Hey, maybe to leave Beto.
[2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:50.440]  In fact, Beto should go door to door and take the guns away. I think Beto should do that.
[2:15:50.440 --> 2:15:55.600]  He should be a real hero and do that himself. Alex Jones on the other side. Maybe not today.
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:16:01.560]  Maybe not tomorrow. But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive. Forget bunkers.
[2:16:01.560 --> 2:16:05.880]  You're not a live underground gopher. You need survivalist camps, the ultimate fully

[2:16:22.680 --> 2:16:27.840]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[2:16:27.840 --> 2:16:32.400]  my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:36.440]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people

[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:03.760]  may not be fully detected by you. But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood
[2:17:03.760 --> 2:17:08.480]  sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of
[2:17:08.480 --> 2:17:12.960]  these that can alert you that something is wrong. Hear how heart and body extract is

[2:17:55.640 --> 2:18:01.320]  Super silver wound gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has
[2:18:01.320 --> 2:18:05.880]  their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[2:18:05.880 --> 2:18:08.960]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two
[2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:14.880]  years as the best seller. We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that
[2:18:14.880 --> 2:18:19.680]  basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with
[2:18:19.680 --> 2:18:25.040]  their patented silver salt technology in it. It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the
[2:18:25.040 --> 2:18:31.520]  steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil
[2:18:31.520 --> 2:18:36.920]  and so much more. It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the
[2:18:36.920 --> 2:18:40.560]  smaller one. You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere. You're certainly not
[2:18:40.560 --> 2:18:46.240]  going to find it at this price and it funds the InfoWare at infowarslife.com. Get your
[2:18:46.240 --> 2:18:51.640]  super silver skin cream today. We can only run this special for another week or so as
[2:18:51.640 --> 2:18:56.080]  I'm taping this September 10th.
[2:18:56.080 --> 2:19:02.240]  We have entered a great time of change. The social engineers who serve Satan who are in
[2:19:02.240 --> 2:19:08.320]  control of this planet believe that if they can organize enough crises that they can control,
[2:19:08.320 --> 2:19:13.680]  they can terrorize the planet into accepting a tyrannical corporate world government known
[2:19:13.680 --> 2:19:18.840]  as a technocracy in their own words that will manage and control and manipulate every facet
[2:19:18.840 --> 2:19:24.680]  of our lives. At first, they give you just a few basic things to do. Don't support Trump.
[2:19:24.680 --> 2:19:28.640]  Don't promote Alex Jones. And once you've submitted to that, well, don't say mother and
[2:19:28.640 --> 2:19:34.040]  father and, well, let us sterilize your children. Take these forced inoculations and here, take
[2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:40.440]  this Prozac pill and here, smoke this weaponized marijuana. Oh, don't be a Christian. This
[2:19:40.440 --> 2:19:44.800]  is truly the market to be system and we're on air right now covering it and you're awake.
[2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:48.440]  You're involved. You're engaged. You're an ambassador of truth. So I'm begging you for
[2:19:48.440 --> 2:19:52.800]  yourself and myself and my family and your family. Spread the word about infowars.com
[2:19:52.800 --> 2:20:18.560]  live shows right now. You're listening to the Alex Jones show resistance to tyrants is
[2:20:18.560 --> 2:20:28.960]  so idiots to God. It's Alex Jones. These things that we're building are not going to
[2:20:28.960 --> 2:20:33.440]  be people. They might be really smart. They might be really good at all sorts of different
[2:20:33.440 --> 2:20:37.600]  things, but they're not going to be like us. They're going to be aliens and they're going
[2:20:37.600 --> 2:20:42.720]  to be, I'm sorry to say, way smarter than every single person in this room in ways that
[2:20:42.720 --> 2:20:48.520]  we can't even comprehend. So this, of course, triggers a lot of alarm. One of the guys who
[2:20:48.520 --> 2:20:58.800]  talks about this is Elon, who says things like this, like when you do this, beware because
[2:20:58.800 --> 2:21:03.400]  you think just like the guy in the stories that when you do this, you're going to put
[2:21:03.400 --> 2:21:10.240]  that little guy in a pentagram and you're going to have your holy water out and you're
[2:21:10.240 --> 2:21:14.400]  going to wave it at the thing and by God it's going to do exactly what you say and not one
[2:21:14.400 --> 2:21:21.880]  thing more, but it never works out that way. So this is an attitude that some are having,
[2:21:21.880 --> 2:21:28.480]  this emerging alarmism about the way this is going to go, but these words, demons, doesn't
[2:21:28.480 --> 2:21:34.800]  capture the essence of what's happening here. I don't know if any of you are turn of the
[2:21:34.800 --> 2:21:39.200]  century weird fiction fans, but there's this guy named HP Lovecraft who's a very famous
[2:21:39.200 --> 2:21:46.760]  American weird fiction author and he exposed a view which is called Cosmosism and the essence
[2:21:46.760 --> 2:21:53.200]  of Cosmosism is cosmic indifference. So what he was saying is basically, yes, there are
[2:21:53.200 --> 2:21:58.320]  these massively intelligent entities out there, but they're not good, they're not evil, they
[2:21:58.320 --> 2:22:03.360]  just don't give a shit about you even in the slightest. The same way you don't care about
[2:22:03.360 --> 2:22:08.920]  an aunt is the same way they're not going to care about you and these things that were
[2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:15.040]  summoning into the world now are not demons, they're not evil, but they're more like the
[2:22:15.040 --> 2:22:22.480]  Lovecraftian great old ones. There are entities that are not necessarily going to be aligned
[2:22:22.480 --> 2:22:29.920]  with what we want. So this transition is really, really massively important for our entire
[2:22:29.920 --> 2:22:35.920]  species to navigate and going back to that thing that Sam Harris was saying, nobody is
[2:22:35.920 --> 2:22:41.560]  paying attention. This thing is happening in the background while people bicker about
[2:22:41.560 --> 2:22:47.960]  politics. Jordy Ross has joined a chorus of AI experts and globalists and billionaires
[2:22:47.960 --> 2:22:53.480]  warning us that AI is going to be millions of times smarter than us and just crushes
[2:22:53.480 --> 2:22:59.200]  like ants or a house plant and that the end of humanity is here and why are we doing this?
[2:22:59.200 --> 2:23:02.560]  Why are we allowing it? Because there's two camps, there's those that say don't do it,
[2:23:02.560 --> 2:23:06.880]  it's crazy, but we're going to be subhuman slaves and then others say oh it's wonderful
[2:23:06.880 --> 2:23:12.880]  humans or trash, we're about to transcend it post-human world. But when you read this,
[2:23:12.880 --> 2:23:15.960]  it shows you how these people have no respect for themselves or human potential that we
[2:23:15.960 --> 2:23:20.760]  built all this and that we're amazing. The truth is the globalists want you just to give
[2:23:20.760 --> 2:23:25.000]  up on life and believe that you're subhuman, that you are a reject, that you don't have
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:30.200]  any power, that you don't exist and that you should just sign over your own destiny. The
[2:23:30.200 --> 2:23:35.240]  establishment who's charting the future for you and explaining how it's all lost and it's
[2:23:35.240 --> 2:23:39.640]  all over, so just lay down and just give up and let them run the world. Let them control
[2:23:39.640 --> 2:23:45.640]  the future. AI experts says we are summoning robot entities who will treat us like ants.
[2:23:45.640 --> 2:23:50.120]  And of course now all the major churches of the world, for the Buddhists, for the Catholics,
[2:23:50.120 --> 2:23:55.240]  for the Protestants are putting robot preachers and priestings, it's so cool. That's just
[2:23:55.240 --> 2:24:00.840]  some junk spouting or courting out at us. All these machines do is mimic what we say,
[2:24:00.840 --> 2:24:05.800]  mimic what we do, mimic our facial expressions, mimic our voice prints. To convince us like
[2:24:05.800 --> 2:24:10.680]  a carnival marker that we're really seeing something magic, but really it's not true
[2:24:10.680 --> 2:24:19.160]  magic, it's the magic of a scam, the magic of the magician who is doing sleight of hand
[2:24:19.160 --> 2:24:22.880]  and manipulating. Like all these big companies that came out and said they can diagnostic
[2:24:22.880 --> 2:24:27.760]  cancer before you have it, and then this machine can test all your blood and diagnostics and
[2:24:27.760 --> 2:24:31.560]  billions of the machines were sold by just one company alone, there's like 20 companies
[2:24:31.560 --> 2:24:35.640]  I know of, and it turns out it's all fraud. Like the new one, oh we have a blood tester,
[2:24:35.640 --> 2:24:39.640]  see if you have PTSD, we have to take your guns, we found a chemical in you to show that
[2:24:39.640 --> 2:24:44.920]  you have PTSD. It's just some stress hormone. It's all quack garbage. You know how many
[2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:49.640]  people want to death row off fake lie detectors? That's just a way to scam you if you are lying
[2:24:49.640 --> 2:24:53.880]  to go ahead and admit your lying. It's all bluffing. It's all scams. Things are much
[2:24:53.880 --> 2:24:58.240]  more complex than you're told or they say. The truth is all this AI computerized is
[2:24:58.240 --> 2:25:02.720]  automation and it's programmed by humans to control you. So what he's really saying is
[2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:07.840]  global psychopaths that see you as ants and you want to post human world are programming
[2:25:07.840 --> 2:25:12.600]  a technocracy is what it is. Where it's all automated and runs your life and tracks and
[2:25:12.600 --> 2:25:17.640]  traces you and then punishes you when you're not a good little slave. This is an imperial
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:21.560]  probe droid of the globalists. Made by slaves in China. Every part of it's evil. It listens
[2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:25.160]  to me. It has my heartbeat. It's on when it's supposedly off. It's tracking everything.
[2:25:25.160 --> 2:25:29.320]  And now they admit all that. Apple's always listening. Google's always listening because
[2:25:29.320 --> 2:25:34.080]  they're all in a race to get AI dominance and the post human world. They've decided
[2:25:34.080 --> 2:25:39.680]  it's a foregone conclusion. Well I'm here to tell them it's not a foregone conclusion.
[2:25:39.680 --> 2:25:45.440]  But let's go further here, ladies and gentlemen. There's another big story up on info wars.com
[2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:50.600]  that ties right into this and of course it's on mosquitoes. Let me just pull that up for
[2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:57.000]  you right now as we cover what's really going on and what's really unfolding in this nation.
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:02.800]  Genetically modified mosquito apocalypse plan backfires spectacularly in Brazil. Oh, turns
[2:26:02.800 --> 2:26:09.480]  out a big globalist company funded by always the same people. Oh, you bet. Mr. Eugenics,
[2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:15.400]  Mr. Deepopulation is involved. One of his foundations, Bill Gates, a British biotech company,
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:20.400]  conducted a 27 month long experiment in 2013 in Brazil aimed at reducing the local mosquito
[2:26:20.400 --> 2:26:25.280]  population by 90% while preserving the genetic integrity of the local insect population.
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:30.960]  Instead it failed and created a new mutant super mosquito that are spreading diseases
[2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:38.480]  even faster. The full article by RT is up on info wars.com and my point is we're learning
[2:26:38.480 --> 2:26:42.640]  six and a half years later about another one of these failed experiments but then it really
[2:26:42.640 --> 2:26:47.400]  failed. We're always told that, oh, it's an experiment to make less humans die. But Bill
[2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:52.480]  Gates says he's working with mosquitoes to learn how to deliver pathogens to reduce population.
[2:26:52.480 --> 2:26:57.720]  He said it during a TED talk. People laugh like it was a joke. It's not a joke. And he's
[2:26:57.720 --> 2:27:03.560]  released mosquitoes in Florida and released mosquitoes in Africa. Again, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:27:03.560 --> 2:27:08.440]  HIV was a race specific bio weapon targeting Africans. Look it up. That's not a conspiracy
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:12.680]  theory. Just like fluoride lowers IQ. Just like fluoride gives you cancer. That's in
[2:27:12.680 --> 2:27:19.560]  major studies. But viruses mutate toward their less harmful or non harmful. That's why the
[2:27:19.560 --> 2:27:23.960]  epidemic of HIV has gone away because the virus mutated out. But they've got to keep
[2:27:23.960 --> 2:27:29.080]  giving vaccines with the original strain to give you HIV again. But Africans everywhere
[2:27:29.080 --> 2:27:36.400]  refuse vaccines. They know it's HIV inside of it. And so it's gone down 90 plus percent.
[2:27:36.400 --> 2:27:39.480]  See how this works? And then Hollywood elites found out as well that they have cures for
[2:27:39.480 --> 2:27:44.640]  all of this. This is very serious. Northern Europeans do not have the receptor sites on
[2:27:44.640 --> 2:27:50.280]  their T lymphocytes. They're generals. They're white blood cell training cells. They go out
[2:27:50.280 --> 2:27:54.680]  and train the other white blood cells. And this targets T lymphocytes so that whatever
[2:27:54.680 --> 2:27:58.960]  else in your environment kills you. Well, they found ways to block that. And again, the
[2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:05.920]  virus also mutates until a less harmful form. I was told this in the 80s. Okay. I was told
[2:28:05.920 --> 2:28:10.440]  this in the 80s. And it turned out to all be true. And that's just the facts, ladies
[2:28:10.440 --> 2:28:14.640]  and gentlemen. It's been in the medical literature all along. And any of you that take a vaccine
[2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:19.040]  are insane. It's not that vaccine science couldn't help you. It's that they're taining
[2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:23.120]  it. They're jacking it. They're trojan horsing it just like they do everything else from
[2:28:23.120 --> 2:28:28.240]  your cell phones to the water supply to everything. It's a very small technical elite that's doing
[2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:32.400]  this carrying out experimentation on the population because they believe they're saving the earth
[2:28:32.400 --> 2:28:36.520]  from overpopulation. But really, they just want to control people. And it's totally sick.
[2:28:36.520 --> 2:28:42.520]  So AI is run by globalists. That's why it's dangerous because they're building it. So
[2:28:42.520 --> 2:28:47.520]  there's a post human world. Now back to the live transmission with Owen shroyer. I'm Alex

[2:29:04.040 --> 2:29:10.360]  too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life. I realized I needed help to
[2:29:10.360 --> 2:29:15.640]  fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and
[2:29:15.640 --> 2:29:21.040]  drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the national treatment

[2:30:05.600 --> 2:30:08.960]  done the research to understand the global spattle plan. And we know how to take them
[2:30:08.960 --> 2:30:13.800]  down. That's why they're so upset. Think how far we've come together. You know, even if
[2:30:13.800 --> 2:30:18.200]  we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because it's the right thing to do against
[2:30:18.200 --> 2:30:23.760]  the truly satanic forces of the new world order who've really taken the mask off the
[2:30:23.760 --> 2:30:28.640]  lines in the sand for everybody now. But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and
[2:30:28.640 --> 2:30:32.760]  to stand with God and to stand with the unborn. So I just want to take time out again to salute
[2:30:32.760 --> 2:30:38.280]  the audience because you are truly activist in the arena. And without you and your prayers

[2:31:51.120 --> 2:31:54.920]  so as we're taping this September 10th.
[2:31:54.920 --> 2:32:01.440]  We have never been closer to a new world war with the crisis in the Middle East with the
[2:32:01.440 --> 2:32:11.000]  Saudi oil fields destroyed half of their capacity, 5% of world capacity. Whoever's behind it
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:16.000]  will know this. There are powerful forces that want a global configuration and now is
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:20.680]  the time to be more aware of that than ever and understand how precarious our position
[2:32:20.680 --> 2:32:27.280]  is here on this planet and that we are just mortal flawed human beings that need to seek
[2:32:27.280 --> 2:32:33.920]  God's countenance, God's discernment and to pray for peace and to pray for transparency
[2:32:33.920 --> 2:32:39.120]  and to pray that the very twisted evil forces on this planet trying to start a world war
[2:32:39.120 --> 2:32:44.200]  will be exposed to their attempts at creating even bigger global crisis will be stopped.
[2:32:44.200 --> 2:32:49.240]  Now we'll probably avert a new world war hopefully but it's already tilting towards
[2:32:49.240 --> 2:32:53.800]  a global depression because of energy crisis. We're covering it all live on the radio at
[2:32:53.800 --> 2:32:58.600]  infowars.com.
[2:32:58.600 --> 2:33:14.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now the tip of the spear leading the fight
[2:33:14.160 --> 2:33:22.000]  to take back the nation. It's Olin Troyer. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:29.240]  You know sometimes you just have to sit back and recognize the clown world for what it
[2:33:29.240 --> 2:33:36.880]  is because that's what it is. When you have Democrats calling for the impeachment of Kavanaugh,
[2:33:36.880 --> 2:33:42.120]  the impeachment of Trump, bringing up, they've got Corey Lewandowski right now in front
[2:33:42.120 --> 2:33:47.440]  of Congress testifying. We're going to go to that here in just a moment for the remainder
[2:33:47.440 --> 2:33:52.080]  of the broadcast but don't worry you know after the Corey Lewandowski testimony is over
[2:33:52.080 --> 2:33:56.320]  the Democrats are going to call the Hamburglar to ask what he knows about Trump stealing
[2:33:56.320 --> 2:34:02.680]  pancakes after that maybe Ronald McDonald and so really important eyewitnesses and fact
[2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:06.880]  witnesses coming up to destroy Trump that the Democrats are going to bring up. Maybe
[2:34:06.880 --> 2:34:14.120]  another blazy Ford I don't know anything or anybody but Kavanaugh definitely raped
[2:34:14.120 --> 2:34:20.720]  me and 10 other women I know that I don't know how I know but probably that's the Democrats
[2:34:20.720 --> 2:34:28.560]  ladies and gentlemen and so they'll call up anybody they'll call up Aunt Jemima if that's
[2:34:28.560 --> 2:34:33.920]  the type of syrup Trump use on the pancakes he stole this is the pathetic state of our
[2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:42.240]  government and it should drive you insane drives me insane that this is what we're
[2:34:42.240 --> 2:34:48.680]  paying for meanwhile the Pentagon just shut down the border wall that's right ladies and
[2:34:48.680 --> 2:34:53.920]  gentlemen the Pentagon just shut down the border wall project why they said they don't
[2:34:53.920 --> 2:34:59.640]  have enough money and if you believe that you're the dumbest ass I've ever met in my
[2:34:59.640 --> 2:35:07.680]  life they'll spend money on anything fact that's one of the crew is pointing out here
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:11.800]  probably cut a deal saying look you go to war Trump will build your wall no war no wall
[2:35:11.800 --> 2:35:16.080]  so the Pentagon shut it down said they didn't have the funds that's a blatant lie but hey
[2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:21.680]  we got plenty of money to get Ronald McDonald in front of Congress for a testimony let's
[2:35:21.680 --> 2:35:25.400]  go to the Corey Lewandowski testimony where the Democrats will do anything to try to destroy
[2:35:25.400 --> 2:35:32.880]  this country good morning Mr. Lewandowski I'm giving I'm questioning you right now thank
[2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:42.720]  you oh I'm right now I'm also breathing right now and drinking water right now to deliver
[2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:45.680]  that message to you Jackson Lee the president picked up the phone himself at any time and
[2:35:45.680 --> 2:35:50.880]  called the attorney general the president also had a full staff of executive employees
[2:35:50.880 --> 2:35:56.240]  right down the hall so this made me wonder if the president thought what he was doing
[2:35:56.240 --> 2:36:02.400]  was legal why didn't he just pick up the phone and call the attorney general sessions or
[2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:08.360]  why not ask any member of his staff who worked right down the hall to deliver a message it
[2:36:08.360 --> 2:36:14.240]  is clear to me that the reason he went to you Mr. Lewandowski is because everyone said
[2:36:14.240 --> 2:36:20.640]  no so I want to ask you about that two days before meeting you the president we're going
[2:36:20.640 --> 2:36:24.880]  to pause this real quick because I just want to give a little context here for the audience
[2:36:24.880 --> 2:36:32.480]  this is an impeachment hearing that the Democrats a House Democrats in a committee launched this
[2:36:32.480 --> 2:36:38.600]  impeachment process to try to remove Trump so in their impeachment guess what's not named
[2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:43.680]  Russia so it's not even about Russia anymore so Russian collusion is gone that came and
[2:36:43.680 --> 2:36:49.760]  went that big bombshell of nothing so now they bring Corey Lewandowski up there on obstruction
[2:36:49.760 --> 2:36:59.200]  of justice obstruction of what Russian collusion which you now admit doesn't exist I'm sorry
[2:36:59.200 --> 2:37:02.000]  you know what I'm just going to shut up because I'm just going to start screaming because this
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:06.840]  is just just go to the thing this is a joke I'm just done I'm just done with this crap
[2:37:06.840 --> 2:37:11.400]  just go to the crap just go to the crap go to the crap show called White House Council
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:17.960]  McGann at home on a Saturday to fire the Pesto Council saying and you can see that on the
[2:37:17.960 --> 2:37:26.040]  screen muller has to go call me back when you do it plain and simple but McGann refused
[2:37:26.040 --> 2:37:31.480]  when the president asked you to deliver that message did he the president tell you that
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:38.080]  two days before your meeting his White House Council had refused to fire the special counsel
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:46.040]  volume 1186 is where you find that language volume two volume two when the president
[2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:50.040]  asked you to hear the question I'm sorry could you repeat the question
[2:37:50.040 --> 2:37:54.440]  ask you to deliver that message did he the president tell you that two days before your
[2:37:54.440 --> 2:37:59.560]  meeting his White House Council had refused to fire the special counsel the White House
[2:37:59.560 --> 2:38:03.480]  has directed me to that I'd not disclose the substance of any conversations with the president
[2:38:03.480 --> 2:38:08.400]  not allowed to answer whether the president told you he called his counsel at home on
[2:38:08.400 --> 2:38:14.880]  Saturday to remove on a Saturday remove the special counsel his counsel said no the president
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:20.600]  had also personally called sessions at home and asked him to unrecuse himself and oversee
[2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:25.920]  the special counsel's investigation and session said no when the president asked you to deliver
[2:38:25.920 --> 2:38:31.360]  his message to sessions did the president tell you that sessions had already said no volume
[2:38:31.360 --> 2:38:36.960]  two one page 107 again Congresswoman I recognize that the privilege is not mine but I've been
[2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:41.360]  asked by the White House to be happy to answer your question or you can just have a conversation
[2:38:41.360 --> 2:38:44.880]  by yourself but if you'd like to ask me a question I'll be happy to answer I'm going to continue
[2:38:44.880 --> 2:38:48.200]  the reason is well then don't ask me a question if you want to hear my answer this is a house
[2:38:48.200 --> 2:38:52.320]  judiciary not a house party so he asked me a question give me the opportunity to answer
[2:38:52.320 --> 2:38:55.920]  your question the very campaign the special counsel was investigating I'd like my time
[2:38:55.920 --> 2:39:04.920]  restored please of his interruption the general lady controls the time so he was a witness
[2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:09.960]  to the special counsel's investigation for that reason session said publicly that federal
[2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:14.600]  law prohibited his involvement in the special counsel's investigation here's a quote from
[2:39:14.600 --> 2:39:20.400]  the report from volume two pages 49 to 50 which is on the screen you can read that yes or
[2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:25.120]  no did the president tell you that the attorney general was legally not allowed to take any
[2:39:25.120 --> 2:39:30.280]  part in the special counsel's investigation when he asked you to deliver him a note about
[2:39:30.280 --> 2:39:36.120]  that very investigation did the president tell you that what you've just read on the screen
[2:39:36.120 --> 2:39:47.760]  congressman you need to look at the screen yes or no read the screen you're welcome
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:52.280]  to read it congressman you're welcome to be stalling and I'm not going to stall you either
[2:39:52.280 --> 2:39:55.800]  answer the question yes or no congressman I'll take the same privileges that you've
[2:39:55.800 --> 2:39:59.800]  asked other members tell you that nobody at the White House was supposed to even contact
[2:39:59.800 --> 2:40:05.120]  the attorney general about the investigation that you can answer yes or no I will not disclose
[2:40:05.120 --> 2:40:10.400]  any conversations I've had with the president again you are obviously here to block any
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:14.840]  reasonable inquiry into the truth or not of this administration the White House counsel
[2:40:14.840 --> 2:40:19.760]  quote shortly after sessions announced his recusal directed that sessions should not
[2:40:19.760 --> 2:40:25.680]  be contacted about the special counsel investigation in fact the White House counsel's internal
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:32.880]  note state no contact with sessions and no communication serious about instruction can
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:38.000]  you read that I just said it can you read that did you hear me yes is there a question
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:43.700]  yes did the president tell you his White House counsel told him no contact with sessions because
[2:40:43.700 --> 2:40:49.120]  of serious concerns of obstruction when he asked you to deliver a message to sessions
[2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:53.800]  I am respecting the executive branch privilege of confidentiality and I recognize that this
[2:40:53.800 --> 2:40:59.520]  time let me just say that you knew did you know the president was putting you at risk
[2:40:59.520 --> 2:41:03.360]  when he asked you to deliver a message to the attorney general I want to be very clear
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:07.960]  the president knew what he was doing was wrong because everyone else had already said no
[2:41:07.960 --> 2:41:12.920]  he called his White House counsel to fire the special counsel McGahn said no he called
[2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:17.640]  the attorney general to ask him to unrecuse himself from the special counsel's investigation
[2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:23.160]  session said no his White House counsel said there should be no contact with session because
[2:41:23.160 --> 2:41:28.280]  of his recusal so what does the president do he calls you in to do what everyone else
[2:41:28.280 --> 2:41:34.040]  wouldn't do he called you in to do his dirty work in secret because he knew it was wrong
[2:41:34.040 --> 2:41:39.520]  well we will expose the truth the president can hide behind you any longer if you should
[2:41:39.520 --> 2:41:46.400]  be here to be telling the truth the truth will set you free and the American people
[2:41:46.400 --> 2:41:51.200]  I yield back the time of the gentle lady has expired the witness may answer the question
[2:41:51.200 --> 2:41:55.040]  I don't believe there was a question Congressman very well yes there was could you repeat the
[2:41:55.040 --> 2:41:58.320]  question and hear it I'll be happy to repeat this is a rant and repeat the question I'll
[2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:06.840]  be hard to be gentle ladies time has expired the gentleman from the gentleman from Ohio
[2:42:06.840 --> 2:42:12.520]  he literally didn't ask a question she just screamed and shouted thank you for what a lunatic
[2:42:12.520 --> 2:42:18.280]  this afternoon to testify before this committee I understand that you've spent many hours
[2:42:18.280 --> 2:42:24.920]  testifying voluntarily before Congress over the last few years isn't that correct it is
[2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:30.520]  and if you had to hire and retain all right we're gonna bring this back live when we get
[2:42:30.520 --> 2:42:35.640]  back from this break just the Democrat clown show continues I honestly folks I'm just at
[2:42:35.640 --> 2:42:40.240]  a breaking point and it's just like I I'm just telling it's like if I'm at this point

[2:42:46.920 --> 2:42:55.440]  different texts from President Trump's team to donate I'm done man this is a joke we have
[2:42:55.440 --> 2:43:03.360]  entered a great time of change social engineers who serve Satan were in control of this planet
[2:43:03.360 --> 2:43:09.720]  believe that if they can organize enough crises that they control they can terrorize the planet
[2:43:09.720 --> 2:43:14.040]  into accepting a tyrannical corporate world government known as a technocracy in their
[2:43:14.040 --> 2:43:19.720]  own words that will manage and control and manipulate every facet of our lives at first
[2:43:19.720 --> 2:43:25.560]  they give you just a few basic things to do don't support Trump don't go on Alex Jones
[2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:29.840]  and once you've submitted to that well don't say mother and father and well let us sterilize

[2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:19.320]  just so I'm going to shut up and turn my mic off but just know as we're listening to this
[2:48:19.320 --> 2:48:26.120]  fake hearing another fake impeachment hearing they say oh Trump was obstructing justice obstructing
[2:48:26.120 --> 2:48:30.920]  justice over what your Russian collusion investigation which came out was totally fake contrived by
[2:48:30.920 --> 2:48:34.960]  the Obama administration total treason so I have to sit here and allow total treason
[2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:40.040]  to happen and just get my ass whooped every day huh oh no we're winning though let's go
[2:48:40.040 --> 2:48:45.920]  back to winning at a fake impeachment hearing isn't that correct it is and if you had to
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:51.760]  hire and retain counsel to represent you for all the investigations that you've had to
[2:48:51.760 --> 2:49:00.120]  endure simply because you served as the president's campaign manager yes sir that's unfortunate
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:08.680]  because you didn't solicit or receive assistance from the Russians did you no sir are you an
[2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:15.800]  agent working on behalf of the Russian government no sir as a close friend and advisor of the
[2:49:15.800 --> 2:49:20.680]  president do you realize how low I keep this right now is working on this is an insult
[2:49:20.680 --> 2:49:25.400]  to anyone with an intelligence level at all above that of a Don Lamont knowledge there
[2:49:25.400 --> 2:49:31.080]  is no effort on the part of the president to intentionally obstruct justice is there
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:38.200]  no sir there's no crime thank you yet again coming here to tell this committee what we
[2:49:38.200 --> 2:49:44.360]  special counsel molar and the American public already know the president trump did not collude
[2:49:44.360 --> 2:49:51.320]  with the Russians nor did he obstruct justice that's not to say that the Russians weren't
[2:49:51.320 --> 2:49:57.800]  trying to interfere and influence our 2016 presidential elections it's clear that they
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:50:05.680]  were by sending fake texts and operating fake facebook pages and holding fake rallies all
[2:50:05.680 --> 2:50:11.120]  in an effort to try to influence the outcome of the election democrats want to ignore
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:17.760]  all of the real evidence of Russian interference and hold this fake impeachment because it
[2:50:17.760 --> 2:50:23.320]  happened under a different president's watch this all happened under president obama's
[2:50:23.320 --> 2:50:29.560]  watch isn't that correct yes sir and it was the obama administration that failed to protect
[2:50:29.560 --> 2:50:36.160]  us from the Russian interference and influence in our election isn't that also true yes president
[2:50:36.160 --> 2:50:41.240]  trump wasn't president he wasn't the one that failed to protect the country if anybody failed
[2:50:41.240 --> 2:50:46.800]  it was the obama administration is that right yes it is I've said it before and I'll say
[2:50:46.800 --> 2:50:53.720]  it again we're wasting valuable committee time engaging in this impeachment investigation
[2:50:53.720 --> 2:50:59.080]  the fact of the matter is one thing this committee could be doing is to question inspector general
[2:50:59.080 --> 2:51:06.040]  Horowitz concerning the bias against the president at the origins of the Russian investigation
[2:51:06.040 --> 2:51:12.360]  we could be questioning Horowitz about his recent report how then fbi director comey
[2:51:12.360 --> 2:51:18.880]  mishandled department memos this committee has such a rich history has jurisdiction over
[2:51:18.880 --> 2:51:25.960]  a whole lot of very significant things we're spending our time on this fake impeachment
[2:51:25.960 --> 2:51:31.960]  but we could be focused on something that really matters like immigration asylum we have hundreds
[2:51:31.960 --> 2:51:37.640]  of thousands of people that have entered our southern border generally they're brought
[2:51:37.640 --> 2:51:44.880]  up either individually or in groups caravans usually oftentimes connected with cartels cartels
[2:51:44.880 --> 2:51:49.400]  make a lot of money when they come up here they're told the magic words come across the
[2:51:49.400 --> 2:51:55.720]  border they say that they're in fear and come right into our country and we put them on a
[2:51:55.720 --> 2:51:59.840]  on a bus or on a plane and they're sent to communities all across the country all run
[2:51:59.840 --> 2:52:04.880]  by the democrats all run by the democrats and manner to do something about total treason
[2:52:04.880 --> 2:52:11.640]  total sedition by u.s. code punishable by death last year that's something in the jurisdiction
[2:52:11.640 --> 2:52:16.920]  of this committee yet we do virtually nothing about in this committee balance budget amendment
[2:52:16.920 --> 2:52:20.760]  it's something I've introduced in this congress we got a twenty two three a dollar death hanging
[2:52:20.760 --> 2:52:26.160]  over our head yet we do nothing in this committee about attempting to actually pass something
[2:52:26.160 --> 2:52:32.600]  that would make us balance the budget every year like all our states have to do so finally
[2:52:32.600 --> 2:52:38.520]  I I just want to thank you again mr. Lewandowski for appearing at today's hearing perhaps your
[2:52:38.520 --> 2:52:44.120]  testimony today will finally convince democrats that there are much more important things
[2:52:44.120 --> 2:52:50.320]  that this committee could be spending our time on rather than continuing to pursue this fake
[2:52:50.320 --> 2:52:56.000]  impeachment a faux impeachment the bottom line is they don't have the votes in the house
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:53:02.880]  to move forward to have a house to vote for this committee to open up an impeachment inquiry
[2:53:02.880 --> 2:53:07.360]  they don't have the votes some of the democrats want to vote for it some of the democrats
[2:53:07.360 --> 2:53:11.680]  would vote against it but they don't have the votes so what they do is they spend valuable
[2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:19.080]  committee time that we could be spending on other important things on this fake faux impeachment
[2:53:19.080 --> 2:53:24.320]  and it's a shame because this committee could be doing so much more on behalf of the american
[2:53:24.320 --> 2:53:31.240]  people with that I yield back mr. chairman point of parliamentary inquiry who who states
[2:53:31.240 --> 2:53:35.360]  the point of parliament gentleman will state his point of parliamentary inquiry mr. chairman
[2:53:35.360 --> 2:53:40.360]  the witness just answered a long line of questions from the gentleman from Ohio about whether
[2:53:40.360 --> 2:53:44.200]  Donald Trump had colluded with the Russians and about the origins of the Mueller investigation
[2:53:44.200 --> 2:53:49.320]  and so on but he never testified as to any of those things before special counsel Mueller
[2:53:49.320 --> 2:53:55.280]  can he now continue to invoke this White House rationale that he's confined to the four corners
[2:53:55.280 --> 2:53:59.960]  of the Mueller report when he's gone way beyond it in his responses to the questioning from
[2:53:59.960 --> 2:54:08.360]  the gentleman from Ohio the regardless of whether he went beyond the four corners of
[2:54:08.360 --> 2:54:14.440]  the Mueller report and he answers that he gave to the last to the last questioner regardless
[2:54:14.440 --> 2:54:18.840]  of that and I'm glad to hear is the he favors the patriots even though that's not the Mueller
[2:54:18.840 --> 2:54:24.360]  report but regardless of the long series of answers that he gave irrelevant that weren't
[2:54:24.360 --> 2:54:30.160]  in the Mueller report the claim of privilege made by the witness is improper for the reasons
[2:54:30.160 --> 2:54:35.800]  said forth in our letter today to the White House and to the witnesses counsel that said
[2:54:35.800 --> 2:54:41.720]  I will take the claim of privilege under advisement mr. chairman parliamentary inquiry the gentleman
[2:54:41.720 --> 2:54:44.920]  will state his parliamentary you actually answer his parliamentary inquiry because it was a
[2:54:44.920 --> 2:54:48.280]  statement not a parliamentary inquiry you just sort of skipped on the executive privilege
[2:54:48.280 --> 2:54:55.240]  here at least that knowledge it was not appropriate parliamentary inquiry the gentleman saved the
[2:54:55.240 --> 2:55:02.840]  parliamentary inquiry he did not have a statement I answered his parliamentary inquiry the general
[2:55:02.840 --> 2:55:07.240]  the gentleman from Tennessee is recognized thank you mr. chair mr. Leondowski it's been
[2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:12.320]  made clear here you were not an employee and you met it at the White House you had no w2
[2:55:12.320 --> 2:55:17.200]  you had no card you had nothing you were not an employee and you weren't a policeman at
[2:55:17.200 --> 2:55:21.840]  one time so you know something about the law and about following the law didn't you think
[2:55:21.840 --> 2:55:25.000]  it was a little strange that the president would sit down with you one-on-one and ask
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:31.560]  you to do something that you knew was against the law did that strike you a strange I disagree
[2:55:31.560 --> 2:55:35.920]  with the premise of your question congressman you weren't a policeman I didn't I didn't think
[2:55:35.920 --> 2:55:39.600]  the president asked me do anything illegal you didn't think it would have been illegal
[2:55:39.600 --> 2:55:45.640]  for you to ask mr. sessions to drop the investigation and to just go on to future presidents and
[2:55:45.640 --> 2:55:49.480]  omit everything with this president go ollie ollie in free we're going to start with the
[2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:56.360]  next one about colluding with Russia you didn't think that was illegal to obstruct justice
[2:55:56.360 --> 2:56:01.360]  congressman the president asked me anything illegal obviously you've never been a judge
[2:56:01.360 --> 2:56:07.760]  and won't be one you know I wonder what a what a democrat scumbag like Stephen Cohen
[2:56:07.760 --> 2:56:14.720]  you know here's what I want to know why are all these democrats out here being open frauds
[2:56:14.720 --> 2:56:20.000]  open liars like America sees this like we know you're a total liar like we know these
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:25.040]  democrats are total liars what are they hiding seriously are all are all these democrats behind
[2:56:25.040 --> 2:56:31.240]  the scenes raping kids seriously because I'm wondering why they're so committed to such
[2:56:31.240 --> 2:56:37.000]  a lie that the American people can see are all these democrats out raping children is
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:43.480]  that what's going on here because I can't reason how they can be such both face liars
[2:56:43.480 --> 2:56:50.120]  I really can't go back all these people asked you to give you dictation he dictated to you
[2:56:50.120 --> 2:56:54.840]  a message to give sessions had you ever been a secretary for the president before and taken
[2:56:54.840 --> 2:57:00.320]  dictation or shorthand many times oh we got your qualifications now you were a secretary
[2:57:00.320 --> 2:57:05.680]  uh could it could but he asked you outside of white house channels and that's what Mueller
[2:57:05.680 --> 2:57:09.120]  wrote that this was outside of white house channels could it have been he asked you to
[2:57:09.120 --> 2:57:13.680]  get the message you know here's my fear we're gonna come back to this we're gonna air all
[2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:20.840]  of this here's my fear if if if the Trump administration thinks allowing these things
[2:57:20.840 --> 2:57:26.040]  to go on will just anger Americans enough to really have his back I'm just not seeing
[2:57:26.040 --> 2:57:31.680]  it folks I'll be honest with you I'm seeing the Trump base become so comfortable with
[2:57:31.680 --> 2:57:37.480]  all of it and just not really care because they're just having a good old time and that's
[2:57:37.480 --> 2:57:41.520]  not gonna lead to victory but I guess we'll find out more of this coming on the other

[2:59:40.880 --> 3:00:03.400]  or so as I'm taping this September 10th you're listening to the alex jones show we now take
[3:00:03.400 --> 3:00:12.240]  a look at this show and try it all right we're going to go back to this fake impeachment
[3:00:12.240 --> 3:00:19.760]  hearing run by jerry nadler's committee seriously these democrats must have so much hiding in
[3:00:19.760 --> 3:00:26.840]  their closet to to embark on this treasonous journey that they've been embarking on for
[3:00:26.840 --> 3:00:32.440]  three plus years now it's really stunning and you know I have a lot of people ask me
[3:00:32.440 --> 3:00:37.320]  like because sometimes I'm critical of the president obviously right now I'm really
[3:00:37.320 --> 3:00:44.000]  critical of these democrats running this fake impeachment hearing folks I just call it like
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:50.440]  it is that's what we do here at info wars I'm not sitting on trumps you know what so
[3:00:50.440 --> 3:00:54.280]  yeah I'm calling out the fact the democrats have lied about trump new york times have
[3:00:54.280 --> 3:00:57.120]  lied about trump the democrats are committing open treason they've been doing it for three
[3:00:57.120 --> 3:00:59.640]  years they're trying to destroy this country they want to take your guns take our free
[3:00:59.640 --> 3:01:04.880]  speech yeah that's the damn democrats they're the ones destroying america but I elected
[3:01:04.880 --> 3:01:08.840]  trump to build a wall stop illegal immigration and I'd like to see him actually do something
[3:01:08.840 --> 3:01:16.200]  about the censorship people say oh leave trump alone shut up conservative snowflake now let's
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:20.800]  go back to the fake impeachment hearings with Corey Lewandowski who just announced he may
[3:01:20.800 --> 3:01:24.760]  be running for senate after this so let's go back channels could it have been he asked
[3:01:24.760 --> 3:01:29.640]  you to get the message to sessions because he thought you would do whatever he asked even
[3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:34.560]  who was illegal or immoral just like your former boss bob nae illegal or immoral these
[3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:39.520]  guys are literally engaged in treason right now man lying to the public I'll shut up get
[3:01:39.520 --> 3:01:44.120]  you to go back these backgrounds largely as a trump guy not so much as a strategist not
[3:01:44.120 --> 3:01:49.240]  a campaign manager but as a right-hand man a body man and an enforcer and Esquire went
[3:01:49.240 --> 3:01:54.400]  further and said the one-time campaign manager for Donald trumps has the traits of an enforcer
[3:01:54.400 --> 3:02:00.640]  and the conflict resolution skills to match and you have heard you've even described
[3:02:00.640 --> 3:02:06.480]  yourself in your book let trump be trump you said we were fine with whatever role the president
[3:02:06.480 --> 3:02:11.320]  wanted us to play in Donald trumps army there were only loyal soldiers there were no more
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:15.840]  loyal soldiers as these guys are all loyal to obama's treason that's what this is all
[3:02:15.840 --> 3:02:21.520]  about the jack abraham scandal you were fired from americans for prosperity after being
[3:02:21.520 --> 3:02:26.880]  accused of fraud voter fraud you are now involved in this either you were willing to break the
[3:02:26.880 --> 3:02:31.960]  law for politics and mr trump are your some kind of a force gump relating to corruption
[3:02:31.960 --> 3:02:36.400]  so maybe let me ask you this did the president pick you as enforcer he thought you would
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:40.080]  play whatever role he wanted because it was illegal is that possibly why he chose you
[3:02:40.080 --> 3:02:45.400]  to take this message to sessions that'd be a question for the president congressman well
[3:02:45.400 --> 3:02:51.280]  donald trump was right though first the white house council don mcgane refused to fire the
[3:02:51.280 --> 3:02:56.520]  special counsel mr mcgane showed principle and character and refused to do what he knew
[3:02:56.520 --> 3:03:01.680]  would be an illegal act then attorney general sessions who had accused himself was asked
[3:03:01.680 --> 3:03:06.520]  to unrequise himself but attorney general sessions also did the right thing and he said
[3:03:06.520 --> 3:03:11.080]  i'm not going to unrequise myself because i have a conflict because i did was involved
[3:03:11.080 --> 3:03:15.440]  the campaign and knew some things can't do it then the white house account council advised
[3:03:15.440 --> 3:03:21.600]  the president not even to contact sessions but you his loyal soldier would do it you
[3:03:21.600 --> 3:03:26.160]  were different than sessions and again trump could depend on you you did not ask any questions
[3:03:26.160 --> 3:03:30.400]  you were a loyal soldier you just wrote down the message and agreed to deliver it that's
[3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:34.520]  what he thought you took the dictation you gave it the whole picks you ask her to type
[3:03:34.520 --> 3:03:39.200]  it up for you not that you couldn't have done it yourself i'm sure and then ask somebody
[3:03:39.200 --> 3:03:43.680]  else to deliver the message to sessions when you decided not to donald trump talked to
[3:03:43.680 --> 3:03:47.720]  you outside normal channels so there'd be no record of anything that he asked you to
[3:03:47.720 --> 3:03:52.000]  do to obstruct justice nothing to do with that at all the president knew what he was
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:56.440]  doing was wrong mr sessions knew what he was doing was wrong mr mcgane knew what he was
[3:03:56.440 --> 3:04:01.840]  doing was wrong you seem to be the only person didn't think it was wrong but mr trump was
[3:04:01.840 --> 3:04:07.920]  wrong because at the last minute you got cold feet you chickened out the president's trust
[3:04:07.920 --> 3:04:12.040]  was misplaced you decided not to do what you told the president you're going to do and
[3:04:12.040 --> 3:04:17.480]  you handed it off to somebody else did you realize at some point that mr nay your former
[3:04:17.480 --> 3:04:23.040]  boss got involved in criminal problems all right this is a this is a by my view treasonous
[3:04:23.040 --> 3:04:32.320]  bastard steven cohen democrat here look i'm going to try to break this down on the other
[3:04:32.320 --> 3:04:45.160]  side of this but look i'm just at zero tolerance at this point okay and well if nothing changes

[3:06:18.840 --> 3:06:21.760]  even know if i should be on air right now quite frankly because this is all happening
[3:06:21.760 --> 3:06:28.120]  internally but i mean i never thought that they would come like i'm about to have to
[3:06:28.120 --> 3:06:36.200]  start debating trump supporters now because they're in la la land wow i'll just leave
[3:06:36.200 --> 3:06:40.960]  it at that folks we're going to go back to this hearing the fake impeachment hearing
[3:06:40.960 --> 3:06:50.320]  the democrats committing treason against this country and i don't know how much more patients
[3:06:50.320 --> 3:06:55.360]  i have to wait for this deep state to we already know everything that happened that's what bothers
[3:06:55.360 --> 3:06:59.120]  me we already know the treason we know the details we know the names we know the players
[3:06:59.120 --> 3:07:05.840]  we know the process we know all of it and we get no hearings but we have dozens of hearings
[3:07:05.840 --> 3:07:15.280]  over fake news fake investigations fake impeachments fake rape rape accusations all of it fake
[3:07:15.280 --> 3:07:19.720]  fake climate change hoaxes i mean literally we spend all these congressional hours on
[3:07:19.720 --> 3:07:26.960]  fake bs but the known treason committed by obama gets nothing now again i don't know
[3:07:26.960 --> 3:07:32.680]  how much more patients i have left and it's reaching a point now i criticize trump because
[3:07:32.680 --> 3:07:37.800]  i want action i love donald trump donald trump is the best president of my life i will vote
[3:07:37.800 --> 3:07:49.280]  for trump again as of right now but i'm not an idiot i'm not a trump fanboy i'm an american
[3:07:49.280 --> 3:07:55.040]  and man when i just point out basic facts like hey the pentagon just shut down three
[3:07:55.040 --> 3:07:59.800]  wall projects due to lack of funding and i get trump supporters saying no they didn't
[3:07:59.800 --> 3:08:08.720]  trump's built the wall already i'm just like what so man this is just a weird polar vortex
[3:08:08.720 --> 3:08:12.920]  magnetic shift i'm having and i know i'm not the only one folks i know i'm not the only
[3:08:12.920 --> 3:08:18.840]  one and so i'm trying to get a date on when the inspector general report from michael
[3:08:18.840 --> 3:08:25.320]  whore which is about to come out because i think that's my personal demarcation line
[3:08:25.320 --> 3:08:30.360]  that if we really can't start to move against these people when the inspector general report
[3:08:30.360 --> 3:08:34.680]  comes out i believe it's supposed to come out yeah we keep they keep pushing it back
[3:08:34.680 --> 3:08:40.120]  it was supposed to be in no september yeah you know boy the more i think about this the
[3:08:40.120 --> 3:08:44.000]  more ticked off i get by the way the president has just landed in california he's having
[3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:54.800]  a secret meeting out there at an undisclosed location i i i'm just i'm just so bewildered
[3:08:54.800 --> 3:09:01.840]  right now i really shouldn't even be on air probably so um so yeah we got another report

[3:10:27.360 --> 3:10:32.840]  mr. londowski you ran president trump's campaign between january 2015 and june 2016 is that
[3:10:32.840 --> 3:10:39.280]  right yes you're at the helm of the campaign when president trump secured the republican
[3:10:39.280 --> 3:10:47.000]  nomination yes pretty good campaign you ran thank you i mean you beat what 1718 different
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:54.080]  opponents senators governor some good senators of course you had a pretty good candidate
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:10:57.760]  the best pretty good candidate i think it's done a great job as president of the united
[3:10:57.760 --> 3:11:01.720]  states after you left the campaign i think you left in june of 2016 after you left the
[3:11:01.720 --> 3:11:06.040]  head of the campaign were you still involved with the campaign throughout the rest of the
[3:11:06.040 --> 3:11:11.160]  election all the way up to november 8th 2016 yes in that entire time so you were part of
[3:11:11.160 --> 3:11:17.640]  the campaign operation at some level or another from january 2015 to november 8th 2016 during
[3:11:17.640 --> 3:11:23.480]  that entire time jordan speaking at the fake impeachment uh with corelon londowski there
[3:11:23.480 --> 3:11:27.840]  alex jones on the line with breaking news let's go to alex now i'm gonna i'm gonna break
[3:11:27.840 --> 3:11:31.000]  this breaking news down i want to explain something you're going to the same thing i
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:34.880]  go through when i broadcast six to seven hours stay you read hundreds of articles you watch
[3:11:34.880 --> 3:11:38.720]  hundreds of clips and you get immersed in it and you spend all your dopamine up in your
[3:11:38.720 --> 3:11:43.720]  brain focused on it and then it seems overwhelming to you a lot of people are still awake i don't
[3:11:43.720 --> 3:11:47.880]  think they realize how serious the fight is uh but but this happens to you it happens
[3:11:47.880 --> 3:11:51.880]  to david happens to me especially by the third or fourth hour we tend to just get freaked
[3:11:51.880 --> 3:11:57.000]  out by basically battle fatigue psychologically focusing on this because we do the opposite
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:01.080]  of the general public we totally focus on this let me give you the huge news ladies and gentlemen
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:05.040]  we are winning and the worm is turning and and and and the leader of the republicans
[3:12:05.040 --> 3:12:09.280]  in the house says the indictments are coming bob barnes is right that's the procedure that
[3:12:09.280 --> 3:12:14.600]  there is an indictment on the cave and they said no we're not overturning the indictment
[3:12:14.600 --> 3:12:18.720]  last week so this is all happening they're in total panic mode all these ridiculous
[3:12:18.720 --> 3:12:22.040]  hearings where you hear about russia gate now you're russia nature thousand times it's
[3:12:22.040 --> 3:12:26.720]  meant to divert you distract you have a debated and fight with them all day that is the distraction
[3:12:26.720 --> 3:12:33.120]  process but here is the mega bomb so i'm about to cover for everyone right now that is so
[3:12:33.120 --> 3:12:40.200]  incredibly important get ready for this original cabin off user witness set to lie i was told
[3:12:40.200 --> 3:12:47.120]  behind the scenes certain things could be spread about me if i didn't apply he said uh lealan
[3:12:47.120 --> 3:12:54.120]  tether the christ uh dina balazi ford said that the witness was told basically lie about
[3:12:54.120 --> 3:12:58.560]  kavanaugh that story is all up there she didn't remember it none of that happened it was all
[3:12:58.560 --> 3:13:03.400]  made up to these lawyers and globalist cia operatives like board but threatened women
[3:13:03.400 --> 3:13:09.240]  who they saw were listed inside the college in high school roles and threatened to destroy
[3:13:09.240 --> 3:13:13.400]  them in the news if they didn't agree that they remember kavanaugh assaulting them even
[3:13:13.400 --> 3:13:17.720]  though they don't remember kavanaugh never knew kavanaugh never did it this new woman
[3:13:17.720 --> 3:13:22.720]  supposedly from college she never got contacted by the news never met kavanaugh never remembered
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:27.800]  it never saw it that was clinton lawyers doing it as well this is total complete fiction
[3:13:27.800 --> 3:13:32.600]  and instead of getting mad about it i get mad too it's an honor that mpr lied instead
[3:13:32.600 --> 3:13:37.080]  i was a horrible criminal and basically a rapist it is an honor when these hardcore criminals
[3:13:37.080 --> 3:13:40.600]  lie about you and we're winning the country's coming back they're trying to sort of war with
[3:13:40.600 --> 3:13:46.080]  iran uh the the obamas and people are advising iran behind the scenes the embarrassed complex

[3:13:56.000 --> 3:14:00.240]  to get super excited and aggressive because now we've got of course these stories out
[3:14:00.240 --> 3:14:04.440]  that not one not two not three but all these women are coming out not the ones that lied
[3:14:04.440 --> 3:14:07.480]  to congress not the ones that said they knew women that were assaulted but they should
[3:14:07.480 --> 3:14:11.440]  put the cut out real women that they went and intimidated and threatened to keep their
[3:14:11.440 --> 3:14:15.760]  mouths shut in some cases the women were never even contacted they just put their names in
[3:14:15.760 --> 3:14:20.320]  books and then on the news believing the women would play along because of peer pressure
[3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:25.440]  the whole house of cards is coming down they published this new book the education of cabinon
[3:14:25.440 --> 3:14:29.400]  believe they would reboot all these ridiculous lies but instead of blowing their face a thousand
[3:14:29.400 --> 3:14:33.720]  times we are watching victory right now we've got to stay vigilant we've got to realize the
[3:14:33.720 --> 3:14:37.040]  globalists are going to launch something else right now they're going to stage something
[3:14:37.040 --> 3:14:42.480]  big another mass shooting another oklahoma city another big war so yes we are in a critical
[3:14:42.480 --> 3:14:47.120]  position but we're fighting back it's an amazing time to be alive the headline this is the
[3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:59.200]  whole wars dot com with this threatened to lie about me if I didn't comply as Leland
[3:14:59.200 --> 3:15:04.880]  Kaiser who Christina blazey Ford said was a witness when Brett Tabinoff sexually assaulted
[3:15:04.880 --> 3:15:09.120]  her in the 1980s now doubt that it ever happened he was going to say I never remember it never
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:12.880]  happened but they threatened me to say I'm a drug addict and a criminal if I didn't they

[3:22:19.040 --> 3:22:24.160]  should be a protest group of thousands of people in front of the new york times right now for the
[3:22:24.160 --> 3:22:30.240]  sedition that they're engaging in there should be a thousand people with this article from info
[3:22:30.240 --> 3:22:35.280]  wars dot com outside of the new york times headquarters right now saying you guys engaged
[3:22:35.280 --> 3:22:44.000]  in treason your fake news you're trying to destroy this country that's on you though here's the story
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:50.880]  on info wars dot com headline from kit daniels original accusers witness was threatened to lie
[3:22:50.880 --> 3:22:55.520]  about kavanaugh story i was told behind the scenes that certain things could spread about me if i
[3:22:55.520 --> 3:23:02.960]  did not comply leland keiser who christine blazey ford said was a witness to win brett
[3:23:02.960 --> 3:23:08.720]  kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in the 1980s now doubts that ever happened during kavanaugh's
[3:23:08.720 --> 3:23:12.720]  bloody confirmation in which ford accused him of sexual assault keiser said through her lawyer
[3:23:12.720 --> 3:23:19.040]  that while she didn't refute dr ford's account she did doctor she was also unable to cooperate
[3:23:19.040 --> 3:23:25.280]  it because she has no recollection of the incident in question yeah totally made up folks the new
[3:23:25.280 --> 3:23:31.360]  york times literally made it up but now keiser and she challenges ford's accusation entirely
[3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:36.960]  according to the new book the education of brett kavanaugh an investigation a book of which ironically
[3:23:36.960 --> 3:23:41.600]  enough was apparently intended to keep the accusations against kavanaugh alive i don't have
[3:23:41.600 --> 3:23:48.160]  any confidence in the story liland told the new york times reporters who wrote the book
[3:23:48.160 --> 3:23:53.840]  interestingly keiser said that in a group of texts a group text of ford allies she was threatened
[3:23:53.840 --> 3:24:00.560]  with being smeared if as an addict if she didn't help ford as reported by the federalist an unnamed
[3:24:00.560 --> 3:24:06.640]  man on the text suggested they defame her as an addict keiser has been in recovery for some time
[3:24:06.640 --> 3:24:16.320]  as her friends know and as has previously been reported another answered liland is a major
[3:24:16.320 --> 3:24:22.880]  stumbling block while asserting she didn't want her to make anything up out of whole cloth she
[3:24:22.880 --> 3:24:28.240]  offered ideas for things that could sound supportive afford story such as that she'd been in similar
[3:24:28.240 --> 3:24:32.800]  situations with blaze ford that summer i was told behind the scenes that certain things could be
[3:24:32.800 --> 3:24:37.360]  spread about me if i didn't comply keiser told the reporters a stunning admission of the pressure
[3:24:37.360 --> 3:24:44.000]  to which she was subjected to by blaze ford allies the democrat party as previously reported in
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:49.760]  justice on trial keiser continues to think about the story in which she was supposed to have played
[3:24:49.760 --> 3:24:55.440]  apart she has both logistical and character driven problems with it focusing on one of the angles
[3:24:55.440 --> 3:24:59.360]  that many women had trouble believing she says it would be impossible for me to be the only girl
[3:24:59.360 --> 3:25:04.560]  at a get together with three guys have her leave and then not figure out how she's going to get
[3:25:04.560 --> 3:25:09.200]  home ironically this is the book's major bombshell even though that's not what the author's intended
[3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:15.360]  bary at the end of the new book the education of brett cavin on investigation reporters robin
[3:25:15.360 --> 3:25:21.600]  poach brinn and kate kelly quietly admit that blaze ford's lifelong friend lilan keiser did
[3:25:21.600 --> 3:25:26.960]  not believe her friend's tale of a sexual assault at a party they both supposedly attended wrote the
[3:25:26.960 --> 3:25:32.000]  federalist molly hemmingway keiser was named by ford as a witness one of four who denied any
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:36.720]  knowledge of the event in question the book offers no evidence in support of the allegations made by
[3:25:36.720 --> 3:25:42.720]  blaze ford but they write their gut reaction was at her allegations rang true both reporters have
[3:25:42.720 --> 3:25:48.160]  been under intense fire recently after pending a new york times article claiming that a new accuser
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:52.800]  witnessed cavin on engaging in sexual misconduct but left out that the alleged victim
[3:25:52.800 --> 3:26:01.280]  denied any memory of it also denied to be a part of this when the committee requested her to be
[3:26:01.280 --> 3:26:06.240]  back in the original confirmation process so this was multiple denials by this lady the new
[3:26:06.240 --> 3:26:11.040]  york times still went with it an earlier version of this article which was adapted from a forthcoming
[3:26:11.040 --> 3:26:15.360]  book did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a yell classmate
[3:26:15.360 --> 3:26:20.000]  that friends of brett cavin on pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:24.560]  dorm party reads an editor's note attached to the article the book reports that the female
[3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:28.880]  student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident that
[3:26:28.880 --> 3:26:36.880]  information has been added to the article so this is what the democrats are doing right now
[3:26:36.880 --> 3:26:42.560]  ladies and gentlemen and i'll tell you what brett cavin all has ruled with the democrats on two
[3:26:42.560 --> 3:26:49.840]  of his decisions two supreme court decisions from brett cavin all have been on the liberal side of
[3:26:49.840 --> 3:26:56.640]  things now if it's his belief that giving them an inch maybe they'll leave him alone hopefully
[3:26:56.640 --> 3:27:02.880]  he's learned that's not the case because of course it's not these people are out for blood
[3:27:04.480 --> 3:27:10.960]  literally the democrat party is out for blood and ladies and gentlemen
[3:27:12.800 --> 3:27:17.840]  i'm not gonna sit here and act like i have all the answers as to why the democrats are behaving
[3:27:17.840 --> 3:27:26.720]  like this but let's allow you to reach some logistical conclusions of your own the democrat party
[3:27:26.720 --> 3:27:32.880]  engaged in open treason a coup attempted to keep trump out of office the democrat party
[3:27:34.240 --> 3:27:41.280]  this is all on record folks with bob kramer started riots in chicago to make trump look
[3:27:41.280 --> 3:27:49.360]  bad the democrat party at the very top that met with jesse smallette now jesse smallette
[3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:55.200]  goes out and engages in a fake hate crime that gets reported nationwide and all the democrat press
[3:27:55.200 --> 3:28:03.680]  totally made up the democrat party brings forward christine blazy forward to make up a story and then
[3:28:03.680 --> 3:28:09.360]  they all run with it and their counterparts in the media to keep cavin all off the supreme court
[3:28:09.360 --> 3:28:15.280]  literally all made up how about the covington catholic boys where they sent in an operative
[3:28:15.280 --> 3:28:20.400]  nathan philips who lied about being a veteran stolen valor and then gotten some boys face
[3:28:20.400 --> 3:28:27.040]  like a rude jerk and then what the media do said he was the victim this is just small scale stuff
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:32.080]  ladies and gentlemen the democrat party is a domestic terror group the democrat party is engaged
[3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:39.760]  in open treason and sedition against this country the democrat party is a path of scum and liars why

[3:33:28.960 --> 3:33:33.280]  violent robberies were optomatically this summer in down tibetan apples until police connected
[3:33:33.280 --> 3:33:38.400]  the dots now with more than a dozen suspects captured in surveillance videos the victims who
[3:33:38.400 --> 3:33:42.720]  were seriously injured in those assaults also appear to have been targeted in these coordinated
[3:33:42.720 --> 3:33:48.720]  attacks fifth and hennepin three weeks ago tonight a man is staring at his smartphone on a corner
[3:33:48.720 --> 3:33:55.360]  still bustling at four a.m. another man strikes up a conversation and within seconds he is surrounded
[3:33:55.360 --> 3:34:02.880]  by six others and brutally beaten it goes on for a couple minutes no one steps in who would
[3:34:03.440 --> 3:34:09.840]  the victim is left unconscious on the sidewalk all of this for a cell phone a few days earlier
[3:34:09.840 --> 3:34:15.920]  and a few blocks away a dice game at target field plaza ends when a cell phone is swiped
[3:34:15.920 --> 3:34:22.880]  and a brutal beatdown begins the victim is stripped punched and kicked in the head he's
[3:34:22.880 --> 3:34:29.600]  defenseless as the suspects jump on them throw potted plants on him and ride over him on a bike
[3:34:29.600 --> 3:34:35.040]  the videos to virtually everybody that saw it were very disturbing the numbers are disturbing too
[3:34:35.040 --> 3:34:41.440]  year to date robberies have 46 percent in downtown minneapolis and in a three-week period in august
[3:34:41.440 --> 3:34:48.800]  47 robberies and the prize each time was a smartphone bill peterson is the new inspector
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:55.760]  downtown the vast majority of these incidents involve groups of males sometimes a female will
[3:34:55.760 --> 3:35:03.920]  be involved and they are targeting specific victims if you will drunk victims exactly sometimes
[3:35:03.920 --> 3:35:08.880]  they'll ask for a cigarette or to use a phone or in the case of this man walking through the light
[3:35:08.880 --> 3:35:15.520]  rail station they'll block his path harass him while someone picks his pocket and there's a name
[3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:21.040]  for this coordinated mugging the groups that we've talked to uh call it finessing they're finessing
[3:35:21.040 --> 3:35:26.480]  the victim they're trying to figure out uh sort of the victim's uh stability their status their
[3:35:26.480 --> 3:35:31.120]  intoxication level so they're sizing them up and deciding how they're going to take them down
[3:35:31.120 --> 3:35:39.200]  that's what finessing is pack hunters like wolves beating up and mugging people in minneapolis
[3:35:39.200 --> 3:35:45.760]  st paul and it's happening in detroit it's happening in dc it's happening in austin texas it's happening
[3:35:45.760 --> 3:35:51.360]  in la it's happening in seattle it's happening everywhere i see these reports in local news
[3:35:51.360 --> 3:35:58.720]  that people send us every day i see it in europe but what do they never point out in these reports
[3:35:58.720 --> 3:36:06.640]  that it's pack hunters groups of black youth and young black males hunting predominantly
[3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:11.600]  white people occasionally they also attack and rob a black person uh there's a report out today
[3:36:11.600 --> 3:36:15.920]  where they threw a black on the railroad tracks almost got him killed had to fight for his life
[3:36:15.920 --> 3:36:22.000]  broke his knee they robbed him because he sometimes there's not a white person around to rob members
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:26.720]  just a few weeks ago in south africa we saw all these blacks burned to death because they're migrants
[3:36:26.720 --> 3:36:32.000]  coming into south africa not by white people no not by the devils but by other blacks in south
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:38.400]  africa but the black south african said hey don't kill your brothers kill the white people
[3:36:39.200 --> 3:36:47.440]  xenophobia must stop if you want to do xenophobia okay right start to kill white people start to
[3:36:47.440 --> 3:36:57.600]  kill chinese people start to kill ancient people don't kill your brother and then even trevor
[3:36:57.600 --> 3:37:04.400]  knowa who's from south africa he came out and blamed the white people he said that white people
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:09.200]  are killing black people and there's record numbers because he didn't show you any of the videos like
[3:37:09.200 --> 3:37:15.840]  we're showing you right now but this is the reality of what's really going on it's so sick
[3:37:15.840 --> 3:37:21.840]  you look at the fbi's own numbers that you have for every white person that attacks a black person
[3:37:22.400 --> 3:37:29.600]  you have 10 white people attacked and that's also true for black on black the truth is there is a
[3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:35.840]  minority of black males who are a minority of the blacks who commit a disproportionately
[3:37:35.840 --> 3:37:41.360]  large amount of the crime in fact it's right at about 45 nationwide violent crime because it's
[3:37:41.360 --> 3:37:46.000]  glorified by the whole gangster culture and by hollywood in the medium those numbers weren't
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:51.680]  like that until the 90s and they went way up when mtv funded gangster rap and made it all cool
[3:37:51.680 --> 3:37:56.000]  so we all know the truth when people like ti and stuff want to talk about how america was never
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:38:00.160]  really great and all this and how the whites are out hurting the black people ladies and gentlemen
[3:38:00.160 --> 3:38:04.800]  it's just not the truth and black folks have been told that their identity is that they're
[3:38:04.800 --> 3:38:10.480]  downtrodden and abused and so that if anyone says that that's not really the case these days as much
[3:38:10.480 --> 3:38:15.760]  you're lessening what happened in the past no i'm telling folks don't live in the past let me tell
[3:38:15.760 --> 3:38:19.920]  you something right now i played football i played a lot of sports i had a lot of black friends growing
[3:38:19.920 --> 3:38:25.120]  up and they were like man you really are colorblind you really are a nice guy because i also got
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:30.320]  attacked by black people who were three four five years older than me growing up in dallas and my
[3:38:30.320 --> 3:38:35.120]  parents just said get tough well you know i did get tough but the truth is that i was racially
[3:38:35.120 --> 3:38:42.560]  attacked let's not exaggerate probably 50 times just in junior high and then into high school but
[3:38:42.560 --> 3:38:46.640]  i wouldn't call it really attacked after that because i i hurt people real bad i started just
[3:38:46.640 --> 3:38:49.760]  you know plus people on the throat grabbing them ramming their heads to the ground and you know
[3:38:49.760 --> 3:38:53.360]  then the rednecks wanted to fight me because they're like who's this 170 pound guy sticking
[3:38:53.360 --> 3:38:59.120]  everybody's ass but the truth is i owe those black folks those racial attacks thank you you made me
[3:38:59.120 --> 3:39:06.320]  who i am i think you every day for it's so good you see i'm not a victim i love it so good you
[3:39:06.320 --> 3:39:09.920]  see how that works and i didn't know join the kkk or something some other gang that hates black
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:14.800]  people because i'm not a tribalist idiot but i will call out packs of racist black guys acting
[3:39:14.800 --> 3:39:19.360]  like wolves attacking white people all day and then bitching and complaining world star hip hop
[3:39:19.360 --> 3:39:24.160]  all knows about the knockout gang kill those old white people knock them down set their heads
[3:39:24.160 --> 3:39:27.920]  bleed all over the ground and then you sit there and go put on down trodden while africans fight
[3:39:27.920 --> 3:39:32.720]  to get into this country to escape slavery still going on in four african countries
[3:39:32.720 --> 3:39:37.680]  run by the islamicists that's right the karen says black people aren't human and can be enslaved
[3:39:37.680 --> 3:39:42.720]  so remember go join your mosque right now the truth is i know history i know facts and that's
[3:39:42.720 --> 3:39:48.480]  the reality so you just got it all laid out here ladies and gentlemen packs of men hunting down
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:54.480]  white devils what a joke what a scam what a lie the system once is all divided and conquered
[3:39:54.480 --> 3:39:58.480]  so we can all be played off against each other and they want to invoke the edit that white males
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:02.560]  are inherently evil even though everybody's fighting to get into nations and systems they're
[3:40:02.560 --> 3:40:06.400]  based on the christian renaissance which the globalists are threatened by so right now they're
[3:40:06.400 --> 3:40:11.200]  removing it and destroying it that's the reality ladies and gentlemen now we're going back to
[3:40:11.200 --> 3:40:15.440]  own stroyer and alive coverage and the incredible impeachment hearings going on right now that
[3:40:15.440 --> 3:40:20.640]  had amazing fireworks but i want everybody and i'm like martin Luther king i believe in what he
[3:40:20.640 --> 3:40:24.880]  talked about judge people by the content of their character and their deeds you judge a
[3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:30.240]  tree by its fruits he didn't invent that jesus said that that's common sense and so most black
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:33.600]  folks are great most white folks are great we all want the same thing freedom and justice in the
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:39.360]  future for everybody but they have invoked a lot of young black people to be racist against whites
[3:40:39.360 --> 3:40:43.760]  and to believe it's okay to attack them the young you know black folks in houston listen to the
[3:40:44.320 --> 3:40:48.400]  new black panther party leader i thought him on the show who says don't mug and hurt your own people
[3:40:48.400 --> 3:40:54.000]  go mug the white people so this is the reality and then as all this racism against whites explodes
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:59.280]  other whites than grovel like socombe syndrome and try to capitulate to it and try to kiss ass and
[3:40:59.280 --> 3:41:04.480]  then sign on the leftist globalist policies that the fortune 100 like apple are funding
[3:41:04.480 --> 3:41:09.680]  when apple runs giant slave factories in china with the greatest level of slavery the world's
[3:41:09.680 --> 3:41:13.760]  ever seen but because it's asians and slaving asians it's not trendy and cool to talk about it
[3:41:13.760 --> 3:41:18.560]  when your bozo the clown capper nick bitching about how america sucks all day because his
[3:41:18.560 --> 3:41:23.520]  white parents adopted him that's the reality ladies and gentlemen so no i don't have any guilt
[3:41:23.520 --> 3:41:27.600]  i guarantee you there aren't any black people in this country they got attacked 50 more times
[3:41:28.160 --> 3:41:33.280]  by white folks it ain't going on everybody knows though it's kosher and good to attack white people
[3:41:33.280 --> 3:41:37.040]  and so here's what i say whether you're black or white whoever you are whoever's attacking you
[3:41:37.040 --> 3:41:40.640]  whites attacking blacks blacks taking whites that's what we have a second amendment to defend
[3:41:40.640 --> 3:41:44.880]  ourselves so i'm an older guy these days whether it's group of white guys or black guys try to
[3:41:44.880 --> 3:41:48.640]  kill me or attack me i'm gonna defend myself with a second amendment that's why we have it
[3:41:48.640 --> 3:41:54.160]  now back to the live transmission you just got some major truth laid on your ass you know folks
[3:41:54.160 --> 3:42:01.840]  it's information overload here at info wars and watching that report i'm just remembering yesterday

[3:42:26.240 --> 3:42:30.400]  right there and a gang of black kids that are obviously older than them bigger than them it
[3:42:30.400 --> 3:42:35.120]  looks like some grade school kids maybe some young high school kids and then some college aged men
[3:42:35.120 --> 3:42:39.360]  black men just start beating the crap out of these white guys telling them to get off their pier

[3:45:13.760 --> 3:45:19.120]  because the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the new world order who've really
[3:45:19.120 --> 3:45:24.480]  taken the mask off the lines in the sand for everybody now but you'd already chosen to fight
[3:45:25.120 --> 3:45:29.840]  the corruption and to stand with god and to stand with the unborn i just want to take time out again

[3:46:05.040 --> 3:46:11.040]  world capacity whoever's behind it know this there are powerful forces that want a global
[3:46:11.040 --> 3:46:17.760]  conflagration and now is the time to be more aware of that than ever and understand how precarious
[3:46:17.760 --> 3:46:24.080]  our position is here on this planet and that we are just mortal flawed human beings that need to
[3:46:24.080 --> 3:46:31.520]  seek gods countenance gods discernment and to pray for peace and to pray for transparency
[3:46:31.520 --> 3:46:37.120]  and to pray that the very twisted evil forces on this planet trying to start a world war will be
[3:46:37.120 --> 3:46:42.240]  exposed and their attempts at creating even bigger global crisis will be stopped now we'll
[3:46:42.240 --> 3:46:48.320]  probably avert a new world war hopefully but it's already tilting towards a global depression

[3:49:10.880 --> 3:49:17.760]  tailor from a different dimension to get pants around his fupa let's go back to the fake impeachment
[3:49:17.760 --> 3:49:23.920]  hearings that same question sitting at that same table he gave the same answer falsely accused the
[3:49:23.920 --> 3:49:28.800]  president is falsely accused of colluding with a foreign state to impact the election jim comey
[3:49:28.800 --> 3:49:34.640]  when we deposed him at that very table said after 10 months of investigation we didn't have a thing
[3:49:35.520 --> 3:49:40.240]  bob muller gets named special counsel he was 30 million dollars a taxpayer money 22 month
[3:49:40.240 --> 3:49:45.680]  investigation he said to that table just a few weeks ago and gives the same darn answer
[3:49:46.480 --> 3:49:50.800]  but these guys over here they don't care they don't care they don't want to get to what mr
[3:49:50.800 --> 3:49:54.560]  shabbat said they don't want to figure out how the false accusation happened they just want to
[3:49:54.560 --> 3:49:58.800]  drag people in front of this committee and keep trying to find some way they can go after the
[3:49:58.800 --> 3:50:05.440]  president let's go back to the process that the ranking member raised um did you testify in front
[3:50:05.440 --> 3:50:10.960]  of the senate intel committee in 2017 yes did you testify in front of the house intelligence
[3:50:10.960 --> 3:50:18.560]  committee in 2017 yes and you went before the special counsel and answered his questions in 2018
[3:50:18.560 --> 3:50:25.360]  is that right it is and you did that all voluntarily yes no subpoena no sir said i'm
[3:50:25.360 --> 3:50:30.080]  willing to comply give answers answer all the questions you got yes i think in your opening
[3:50:30.080 --> 3:50:34.240]  statement you said 20 something how many hours did you sit in front of those various committees
[3:50:34.240 --> 3:50:40.400]  more than 20 more than 20 hours and for this committee did you get a letter from this committee
[3:50:40.400 --> 3:50:45.920]  back in march asking you to comply with certain document request that chairman eddler wanted
[3:50:45.920 --> 3:50:51.120]  to have i believe so yes and you and your legal team complied with that yes sir and then on june
[3:50:51.120 --> 3:50:56.480]  24th you got another letter is that right yes june 24th this year you got another letter asking
[3:50:56.480 --> 3:51:04.480]  you to do an interview a transcribed interview in front of the committee and your lawyer contacted
[3:51:04.480 --> 3:51:10.160]  chairman eddler instead we'd be happy to do that is that right yes say give us some dates we'll come
[3:51:10.160 --> 3:51:16.640]  in we'll be happy to sit for an interview that's right what happened next uh next about five weeks
[3:51:16.640 --> 3:51:21.840]  ago the committee issued subpoena for my appearance so you're willing to come voluntarily just like
[3:51:21.840 --> 3:51:25.920]  you did with senator intel house intel just like you did for bob moeller for the special counsel
[3:51:25.920 --> 3:51:29.440]  20 some hours you're willing to do that all you complied with when they asked you for certain
[3:51:29.440 --> 3:51:33.440]  documents and then when they want you to come in for an interview you said all right sure we'll do it
[3:51:33.440 --> 3:51:39.200]  they hit with a subpoena correct and then they start calling your names saying close up that book
[3:51:39.200 --> 3:51:43.840]  answer the question start treating you this way kind of interesting they're the ones who started
[3:51:43.840 --> 3:51:46.560]  it they're the ones who slapped you with the subpoena when you were willing to come here
[3:51:46.560 --> 3:51:51.520]  voluntarily i was and then they then they then they question what the demeanor you bring here today
[3:51:51.520 --> 3:52:00.240]  i mean first they changed the rules last week in the middle of the congress changed the rules
[3:52:00.240 --> 3:52:03.440]  of the committee in the middle of the game and then today they're not even going to follow the rules
[3:52:04.320 --> 3:52:08.160]  because the rules they changed last week talk about staff asking questions at the end after
[3:52:08.160 --> 3:52:15.040]  members are done we got this whole issue with consultants so this maybe we would be better
[3:52:15.040 --> 3:52:21.120]  served if we did exactly what mr shabbat said maybe we would be better served as the house
[3:52:21.120 --> 3:52:26.560]  judiciary committee if we actually focused on how this whole false accusations started in the first
[3:52:26.560 --> 3:52:31.440]  place what do you think mr londowski i think it'd be a great idea great idea maybe maybe the american
[3:52:31.440 --> 3:52:35.760]  people would be better served than spending more time investigating something that's already had
[3:52:35.760 --> 3:52:41.440]  32 months of investigation from both jim comey in the fbi and bob moeller in the special council
[3:52:41.440 --> 3:52:46.400]  maybe we would do that you know great place to start great place to start mr chairman
[3:52:46.400 --> 3:52:51.440]  i ask you about this one we could go today great place to start would be the inspector
[3:52:51.440 --> 3:52:58.160]  generals report that was issued just three weeks ago the scathing report about jim comey that'd be
[3:52:58.160 --> 3:53:02.480]  a nice place to start but when i asked the chairman when we might have an opportunity to question mr
[3:53:02.480 --> 3:53:08.720]  horowitz he said i don't know i haven't thought about that of course you haven't thought about that
[3:53:08.720 --> 3:53:13.600]  too busy trying to impeach the president too busy slapping subpoenas on corey londowski
[3:53:13.600 --> 3:53:17.440]  of course you haven't thought about that's what the committee should be focused on i yield back
[3:53:19.600 --> 3:53:25.120]  gentlemen yields back the gentlemen from georgia thank you mr chairman mr londowski you
[3:53:25.120 --> 3:53:32.960]  are about like a fish being cleaned with a spoon it's very hard to get an answer out of you
[3:53:33.600 --> 3:53:41.200]  but let me ask you this sir based on the president's past statements everybody knows that uh this is
[3:53:41.200 --> 3:53:46.160]  hank johnson who thinks islands float who opens up his question and says mr londowski you're like
[3:53:46.160 --> 3:53:51.600]  trying to clean a fish with a spoon it's hard to get anything out of you this sort of intellectual
[3:53:51.600 --> 3:53:56.560]  genius is well beyond my pay grade folks go back to the genius everybody knows that the president
[3:53:56.560 --> 3:54:03.440]  does not like for anybody to take notes when he's talking in fact he asked lawyers not to
[3:54:03.440 --> 3:54:10.320]  take official notes and you're aware of that correct i'm aware of the public account sir
[3:54:10.320 --> 3:54:16.240]  all right fair enough and but when the president met with you in the oval office one on one on
[3:54:16.240 --> 3:54:25.280]  june 19th 2017 to dictate a message to attorney general jeff sessions he told you to quote write
[3:54:25.280 --> 3:54:33.520]  this down isn't that correct that's accurate and it was just you and the president in that meeting
[3:54:33.520 --> 3:54:41.680]  correct it was and you knew that you needed to write down as fast as possible what the president
[3:54:41.680 --> 3:54:46.320]  was telling you so that you could make sure to capture the content of what he was telling you
[3:54:46.320 --> 3:54:52.400]  correctly correct i don't know the speed of writing was a criteria but i tried to capture it to the
[3:54:52.400 --> 3:54:59.360]  best of my ability congressman thank you sir and he dictated to you exactly what he wanted you to
[3:54:59.360 --> 3:55:08.080]  put into the mouth of attorney general jeff sessions correct i believe he asked me to
[3:55:08.080 --> 3:55:14.080]  deliver a message this is how many times has this guy been reelected can you guys find that
[3:55:14.080 --> 3:55:20.160]  out from the message that he intended for jeff meaning jeff sessions to deliver out loud and
[3:55:20.160 --> 3:55:26.240]  publicly he wanted the public to know what he was saying but he wanted jeff to say it correct
[3:55:27.600 --> 3:55:31.520]  i mean i believe like it would be quite a challenge to find someone with a lower iq than
[3:55:31.520 --> 3:55:41.520]  don lemon but hey johnson the president dictated to you that he wanted you to deliver to you
[3:55:41.520 --> 3:55:45.360]  he's been reelected what is that four times screen and i'd like for you to read the first
[3:55:45.360 --> 3:55:52.160]  this guy's been elected at least four times would entertain that and he came out of synthia
[3:55:52.160 --> 3:55:57.920]  mckinney's district who's actually a patriot called out the foreign wars wow that's a major
[3:55:57.920 --> 3:56:04.720]  change would you prefer for me to read it instead of you please okay it says i know that i recused
[3:56:04.720 --> 3:56:11.200]  myself from certain things having to do with specific areas but our potas is being treated
[3:56:11.200 --> 3:56:16.320]  very unfairly that's what he told you to write down and that's what you wrote down and i'll
[3:56:16.320 --> 3:56:22.160]  continue he said he shouldn't have a special prosecutor counsel because he hasn't done anything
[3:56:22.160 --> 3:56:30.880]  wrong now that's what he wanted you to deliver to attorney general jeff sessions correct i believe
[3:56:30.880 --> 3:56:35.760]  that's an accurate representation and he wanted you to deliver it to jeff so that jeff could
[3:56:35.760 --> 3:56:40.080]  say it to the you notice how he didn't include the part where the president talks about how
[3:56:40.080 --> 3:56:46.720]  they're subverting the constitution you are trying to be right now being scaled you felt
[3:56:46.720 --> 3:56:52.240]  eight times hey johnson is one reelection wow what a stud this guy no sir this guy is just an
[3:56:52.240 --> 3:56:57.760]  intellectual mountain why did it take you so long and you'd never even deliver the mountains float
[3:56:57.760 --> 3:57:03.040]  by the way correct i never delivered a message yeah you chickened out i went on vacation you went
[3:57:03.040 --> 3:57:11.280]  on vacation all right ladies and gentlemen you put the message in your safe in your home wow just
[3:57:11.280 --> 3:57:21.280]  what just just i'm speechless folks i'm speechless erison smith takes over for the war room for me
[3:57:21.280 --> 3:57:27.840]  today this is done uh i'm gonna do it for the alex joneshow be sure to share the kit daniel's story
[3:57:27.840 --> 3:57:35.840]  about how the new york times knowingly lied knowingly lied about ret cavanaugh's accusers
[3:57:35.840 --> 3:57:40.640]  this is the democrat party ladies and gentlemen committing open treason you better get woke
