[00:00.000 --> 00:19.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is May 19th, 2021.
[00:19.160 --> 00:23.240]  This is the kickoff of this historic edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:23.240 --> 00:25.080]  First off, I want you to understand something.
[00:25.080 --> 00:29.880]  We've broken a lot of huge news together as the enforced family with our guests, our researchers
[00:29.880 --> 00:34.960]  and callers putting us on the very important leads that have been critical to getting a
[00:34.960 --> 00:37.120]  clear picture of what's happening.
[00:37.120 --> 00:42.560]  But now, 16 months after this globalist assault that was the COVID-19 fear weapon, all the
[00:42.560 --> 00:45.480]  dots are being connected, the planets are aligning, and we're figuring out exactly what
[00:45.480 --> 00:46.480]  happened.
[00:46.480 --> 00:52.680]  We're going to air, next segment, a report from internal documents in the state of Connecticut
[00:52.680 --> 00:58.960]  confirming for the world with documents out of Michigan, Connecticut, and internationally
[00:58.960 --> 01:03.600]  that the government of Connecticut knows that a chemical being put in the Moderna vaccine
[01:03.600 --> 01:11.400]  as one of the lipids to carry the RNA into the cell is actually extremely deadly and
[01:11.400 --> 01:17.160]  causes cancer, even causes death and is linked directly to infertility in women and men.
[01:17.160 --> 01:21.960]  That bombshell of bombshell information with all the documents is going to be premiering
[01:21.960 --> 01:22.960]  next segment.
[01:22.960 --> 01:27.880]  The full article and video is already on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[01:27.880 --> 01:28.880]  Get it?
[01:28.880 --> 01:29.880]  Share it now.
[01:29.880 --> 01:34.320]  We also have a top communist academic that advises the equivalent of their Pentagon,
[01:34.320 --> 01:40.360]  their army in Naval and Air Force War College, saying China has won the 21st century war
[01:40.360 --> 01:44.600]  with a bio attack and that working with their influencers and change agents in our media
[01:44.600 --> 01:48.320]  in Hollywood, they kept us locked down and will keep us locked down in the future when
[01:48.320 --> 01:50.240]  they were only locked down for a couple months.
[01:50.240 --> 01:53.280]  And of course, Bill Gates pointed that out that China won the war and China's going to
[01:53.280 --> 01:54.280]  be more bad.
[01:54.280 --> 01:58.560]  And he helped run that with the UN and the head of the WHO.
[01:58.560 --> 02:01.960]  So COVID's a real weapon, but it's only killed the old people that don't have vitamins and
[02:01.960 --> 02:02.960]  minerals.
[02:02.960 --> 02:05.760]  But the fear of it is the real weapon to shut down society.
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.640]  Then the triple hit or the third blow is in the vaccine, is in the vaccine, and it causes
[02:10.640 --> 02:15.800]  all sorts of autoimmune responses and other serious illnesses, heart attacks, the lungs
[02:15.800 --> 02:16.800]  get eaten.
[02:16.800 --> 02:21.600]  Then they say that you are testing positive for COVID, putting in the hospital, you die
[02:21.600 --> 02:23.040]  and they say COVID did it.
[02:23.040 --> 02:24.040]  This is incredible.
[02:24.040 --> 02:29.640]  This is 21st century bio warfare, hidden as a so-called virus that came from a wet market
[02:29.640 --> 02:34.440]  when it came out of the Fauci Gates funded, UN funded lab working with the Communist Chinese
[02:34.440 --> 02:35.440]  military.
[02:35.440 --> 02:38.480]  So they had us at first, but now the world's waiting for this.
[02:38.480 --> 02:39.760]  It's so huge.
[02:39.760 --> 02:44.640]  All those articles about the Chinese academic bragging, all the articles and videos about
[02:44.640 --> 02:50.200]  this deadly chemical that they knowingly put in the vaccine, let's see, legal to do so,
[02:50.200 --> 02:57.880]  is on infowars.com and newswars.com, and then Owen Shroyer after this first big segment
[02:57.880 --> 03:01.680]  that's coming up, segment two, will take over for the rest of the hour and the rest of the
[03:01.680 --> 03:06.120]  show that I'm begging you for myself, my family, your family, everybody together.
[03:06.120 --> 03:07.120]  It's a team effort.
[03:07.120 --> 03:11.880]  I run to so many listeners on the ground, but I'm on a work occasion in Florida who
[03:11.880 --> 03:12.880]  are listeners.
[03:12.880 --> 03:15.920]  I mean, we're talking, I'll be on the beach, everybody coming by as a listener, black,
[03:15.920 --> 03:19.680]  white, old, young, you name it, and they're like, Alex, you know, we barely find you anymore.
[03:19.680 --> 03:20.680]  Are you still on air?
[03:20.680 --> 03:24.240]  And I'm like, yes, infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video, and they're like, yeah, we see
[03:24.240 --> 03:25.240]  clips here and there.
[03:25.240 --> 03:29.440]  And I just tell them, listen, don't thank me, I'm asking you to take action, share those
[03:29.440 --> 03:30.440]  every time you get them.
[03:30.440 --> 03:32.800]  And they say, I do most of the time, but I'll redouble my efforts.
[03:32.800 --> 03:36.120]  So great job, folks, you're just as important as I am.
[03:36.120 --> 03:41.120]  Get this information out, share the video about Connecticut admitting this deadly chemicals
[03:41.120 --> 03:45.760]  in the vaccine and the Bill Gates fund, the Moderna vaccine, that is on band.video.
[03:45.760 --> 03:48.520]  And again, just tell everybody, you know, tune in right now, take the live links from
[03:48.520 --> 03:53.240]  band.video and infowars.com, share them and tell folks about those local A&M FM stations,
[03:53.240 --> 03:56.640]  and then tell them, once they wake up to tell others, that's the chain reaction.
[03:56.640 --> 04:00.600]  All right, here is Owen Schroeder taking over for a moment, and then I'll be back in the
[04:00.600 --> 04:08.520]  next segment with this key report, stay with us.
[04:08.520 --> 04:09.520]  It's incredible.
[04:09.520 --> 04:33.760]  You know, with the deadly vaccines and the fake pandemic and everything that's happened
[04:33.760 --> 04:40.640]  there, and then you have the distraction of all of this by what's happening in Israel,
[04:40.640 --> 04:44.200]  that nobody's even paying attention to some of the other news, like our elections caught
[04:44.200 --> 04:49.880]  the theft of that alien technology, the government's admitting there's alien technology stalking
[04:49.880 --> 04:55.040]  military bases, and then the behavior of the president doesn't get noticed what he did
[04:55.040 --> 05:01.320]  yesterday at a Ford electric car plant.
[05:01.320 --> 05:07.480]  Your voice counts when you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes
[05:07.480 --> 05:08.480]  the world.
[05:08.480 --> 05:10.920]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[05:10.920 --> 05:12.440]  They know you're angry.
[05:12.440 --> 05:16.760]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[05:16.760 --> 05:17.760]  we've got.
[05:17.760 --> 05:21.960]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can
[05:21.960 --> 05:26.200]  then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and
[05:26.200 --> 05:28.660]  special reports, and share them with everyone you know.
[05:28.660 --> 05:38.960]  Take action now by texting the word news, N-E-W-S, to 833-470-0438, that's 833-470-0438

[05:45.680 --> 05:47.960]  live show notifications.
[05:47.960 --> 05:52.440]  Take action now, create the chain reaction, and tell others to share those texts.
[05:52.440 --> 06:17.600]  Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[06:17.600 --> 06:20.960]  We've been working on this story for over a week.
[06:20.960 --> 06:26.420]  We were set to break it tomorrow, but we were very excited and pleased to see that Mike
[06:26.420 --> 06:30.500]  Adams, the health ranger, broke it because his scientific background and research seemed
[06:30.500 --> 06:31.500]  better than ours.
[06:31.500 --> 06:34.380]  He did a great job laying it all out.
[06:34.380 --> 06:39.300]  The headline is bombshell, Connecticut government secretly tells health care workers, coming
[06:39.300 --> 06:44.420]  vaccines are deadly, but withholds the same information from the public.
[06:44.420 --> 06:47.900]  The first half of the article is about that, and it's very important.
[06:47.900 --> 06:53.380]  The part that we were working on is the second part of the article, and quite frankly I think
[06:53.380 --> 07:02.820]  is the most important part, and that is COVID-19 vaccine ingredients include SM-102, a toxic
[07:02.820 --> 07:06.780]  substance known to be harmful to humans and animals.
[07:06.780 --> 07:12.460]  Now, it's not just the main ingredient in antifreeze.
[07:12.460 --> 07:20.620]  He did research on this, SM-102 is a catchphrase for an entire class of toxic oils, and in
[07:20.620 --> 07:25.340]  their own internal document that is from the health department, two health department
[07:25.340 --> 07:30.660]  workers, this isn't given to the public, and Connecticut confirms this is a real document,
[07:30.660 --> 07:37.020]  they have the data safety sheet on this that I'm about to read to you now.
[07:37.020 --> 07:44.500]  The article we just mentioned is at naturalnews.com, we'll also post it here on Wednesday underneath
[07:44.500 --> 07:49.780]  the live show feed, so that you can actually go see this for yourself as well and then
[07:49.780 --> 07:55.700]  hopefully share it, but whatever you do, go research this for yourself, look this up for
[07:55.700 --> 07:56.900]  yourself.
[07:56.900 --> 08:03.740]  Let me go ahead and show you on screen some close shots of this again for yourself.
[08:03.740 --> 08:08.260]  This document is on the Connecticut website, but it was not widely distributed, they may
[08:08.260 --> 08:12.740]  try to take it down, so for those purposes we have mirrored it on infowars.com, it's
[08:12.740 --> 08:16.460]  also mirrored on naturalnews.com.
[08:16.460 --> 08:20.740]  So it goes into telling you that it's safe and it's fine and that it's something you
[08:20.740 --> 08:27.860]  really need to do, but then they have the safety data sheet that is connected to it.
[08:27.860 --> 08:31.660]  This is what the health department there in Connecticut, you better believe your health
[08:31.660 --> 08:36.300]  department is also aware of, this is another reason roughly half the healthcare workers,
[08:36.300 --> 08:42.260]  the scientists, the researchers at the NIH and CDC, thousands testified in Congress
[08:42.260 --> 08:45.500]  last week have not taken the vaccine, even though they were the first to have it available
[08:45.500 --> 08:49.260]  to them, because they know it's experimental, it's not really a vaccine.
[08:49.260 --> 08:55.980]  Trade name SM 102, and again it has a very, very long complex name that we've got on screen
[08:55.980 --> 08:56.980]  for you.
[08:56.980 --> 09:03.140]  It has multiple numbers, so you can look it up yourself, it's 3347433474.
[09:03.140 --> 09:10.100]  Let's start at the very top of the safety data sheet, where it says it is for research
[09:10.100 --> 09:17.860]  purposes only, and not to be used on humans, right out of the gates, right there in the
[09:17.860 --> 09:18.860]  document.
[09:18.860 --> 09:24.300]  Now let's go ahead and read over what this thing does, suspected of causing cancer, suspected
[09:24.300 --> 09:30.260]  of damaging fertility, and the unborn child, causes damage to the central nervous system,
[09:30.260 --> 09:35.140]  the kidneys deliver, and the respiratory system through prolonged or repeated exposure.
[09:35.140 --> 09:39.940]  They want you to take two shots of this, and then recurring booster shots, mixed in with
[09:39.940 --> 09:44.820]  other things the body is creating an immunity to, which a lot of scientists say, well then
[09:44.820 --> 09:49.940]  create an autoimmune response to this chemical, so very, very serious.
[09:49.940 --> 09:55.900]  Very determining components of labeling, and then it goes on to say that it's highly toxic,
[09:55.900 --> 10:02.420]  fatal in contact with skin, causes skin irritation, causes serious eye irritation, suspected of
[10:02.420 --> 10:06.420]  damaging fertility of the unborn child, causes damage to the central nervous system, the
[10:06.420 --> 10:11.220]  kidneys deliver, respiratory system through prolonged or repeated exposure.
[10:11.220 --> 10:16.900]  Harmful to aquatic life, very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects, obtained special
[10:16.900 --> 10:21.580]  instructions before use, do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and
[10:21.580 --> 10:22.580]  understood.
[10:22.580 --> 10:26.340]  They don't tell you this when you go get to Walgreens or when you go to Wal-Mart or you
[10:26.340 --> 10:28.300]  go to CVS.
[10:28.300 --> 10:32.900]  Keep container tightly closed, and it just goes on from there.
[10:32.900 --> 10:34.780]  Do not breathe.
[10:34.780 --> 10:37.900]  Do not get it in your eyes or skin or clothing.
[10:37.900 --> 10:39.820]  Wash thoroughly after handling.
[10:39.820 --> 10:44.060]  Do not eat, drink, or smoke when using this product.
[10:44.060 --> 10:47.340]  Lead releasing into the environment, much less into people.
[10:47.340 --> 10:50.460]  Wear a protective gloves, protective clothing, eye protection.
[10:50.460 --> 10:55.860]  When you do use it, if swallowed, call a poison, center doctor if you feel unwell.
[10:55.860 --> 10:59.300]  So folks are getting sick, collapsing, having heart attacks, the rest of it, this is just
[10:59.300 --> 11:00.300]  one reason.
[11:00.300 --> 11:05.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's just the first page, okay?
[11:05.420 --> 11:10.180]  So again, that's page one, it's the first page, actually getting into it all.
[11:10.180 --> 11:15.140]  I've got page three, and I've got page four.
[11:15.140 --> 11:25.500]  There's 11 pages of this, and I've only scratched the tip of the iceberg for you on this, and
[11:25.500 --> 11:29.060]  I'm just continually absolutely stunned.
[11:29.060 --> 11:36.140]  And by the way, they list the other things that are in this vaccine, and two of the others
[11:36.140 --> 11:42.540]  are also dangerous industrial oils that they say even small amounts are extremely toxic.
[11:42.540 --> 11:48.660]  And that's how they deliver the nanotech-sized RNA into your cells to reprogram them with
[11:48.660 --> 11:56.260]  a spike protein, which your body also has an autoimmune response to.
[11:56.260 --> 11:57.260]  They're going for broke.
[11:57.260 --> 11:58.740]  This is totally insane.
[11:58.740 --> 12:00.020]  It doesn't protect you from COVID.
[12:00.020 --> 12:06.060]  Most people in the hospital dying from COVID now, they admit are there from COVID vaccines.
[12:06.060 --> 12:09.940]  Everyone has to get this report and sit it out to your friends or family or neighbors
[12:09.940 --> 12:20.140]  and then send them a link to this industrial, extremely dangerous chemical, SCM-102 from
[12:20.140 --> 12:22.540]  the safety data sheet.
[12:22.540 --> 12:26.340]  There are thousands of copies of the safety data sheet online.
[12:26.340 --> 12:32.460]  The one that we pulled up in our link to the article is safety data sheet from OSHA HCS,
[12:32.460 --> 12:37.900]  and this is out of the Cayman Islands, where this particular chemical is being manufactured,
[12:37.900 --> 12:42.100]  but it's manufactured at other places as well.
[12:42.100 --> 12:48.180]  Again, I'm a father, I'm a human, I have parents, I'm watching people all around me get sick
[12:48.180 --> 12:52.420]  and die from the so-called vaccines.
[12:52.420 --> 12:53.980]  You ask, how are they going to get away with this?
[12:53.980 --> 12:56.020]  Well, the answer is they're not.
[12:56.020 --> 13:00.620]  But they did get away with tens of millions of people being autistic from vaccines.
[13:00.620 --> 13:01.820]  And now that was all coming out.
[13:01.820 --> 13:06.220]  So this was supposed to be an even bigger event, so we forget the old event, and then
[13:06.220 --> 13:09.460]  there'll be an even bigger event coming in the future, Bill Gates said, we're, quote,
[13:09.460 --> 13:16.460]  terrorist, release a bio weapon, and we've also got Bill Gates saying that we depopulate
[13:16.460 --> 13:17.660]  the earth at the same time.
[13:17.660 --> 13:21.540]  So when you've got somebody saying they want to depopulate you, but they really want to
[13:21.540 --> 13:24.020]  put something in your body, you should put two and two together.
[13:24.020 --> 13:28.660]  Paul Joseph Watson did a big story about Claude Schwab that has an economic forum at Davos.
[13:28.660 --> 13:34.340]  Henry Kissinger's frontman, and Paul Watson said, why is he so concerned about having
[13:34.340 --> 13:39.860]  more gay characters on TV, because only 10% of characters on TV are gay, when only roughly
[13:39.860 --> 13:44.260]  5% of the world population, quote, identifies as gay, up from 1% a few years ago.
[13:44.260 --> 13:45.980]  And it's because of depopulation.
[13:45.980 --> 13:49.780]  I don't hate somebody because of their, quote, sexual preference.
[13:49.780 --> 13:54.380]  But when they're organized by media and government for depopulation, there's a war on the family,
[13:54.380 --> 13:57.620]  and a war on the nuclear family, and Black Lives Matter says we want to get rid of the
[13:57.620 --> 14:02.380]  nuclear family, and want to sterilize Black men, and trans men, Black men are the most
[14:02.380 --> 14:03.380]  important thing.
[14:03.380 --> 14:09.300]  It's not even two plus two equals, Karen, it's just on its face, they're doing this.
[14:09.300 --> 14:14.620]  It's not even a calculation to know they're doing it, they're telling us it's about depopulation.
[14:14.620 --> 14:16.780]  And that's why it attacks their fertility.
[14:16.780 --> 14:18.220]  That's why it attacks the rest of the body.
[14:18.220 --> 14:24.420]  And that's why it causes us horrible autoimmune disorders, as this lipid, this oil is delivering
[14:24.420 --> 14:27.020]  this through your cell membrane.
[14:27.020 --> 14:31.060]  So again, we're going to post this to Band-Aid video, remember Big Tech is censoring and
[14:31.060 --> 14:35.460]  blocking all this, they are committing war crimes against humanity, they are violating
[14:35.460 --> 14:39.380]  the Nuremberg Code, right along with Big Pharma, in their attempts to suppress the medical
[14:39.380 --> 14:42.620]  workers and scientists and others that have been out exposing this.
[14:42.620 --> 14:47.620]  I know Owen has a very special medical doctor joining him today, who's also been persecuted
[14:47.620 --> 14:52.500]  and attacked for telling the truth, in those famous press conferences in front of the
[14:52.500 --> 14:53.500]  US Capitol.
[14:53.500 --> 14:57.140]  And so I'll leave that to Owen to tell you who's coming up, it's going to be extremely
[14:57.140 --> 15:01.140]  informative and extremely powerful, but I wanted to kick the main broadcast off the
[15:01.140 --> 15:02.740]  day with this information.
[15:02.740 --> 15:06.660]  I also just talked to Mike Adams, and he's going to be able to pop on the broadcast as
[15:06.660 --> 15:07.660]  well.
[15:07.660 --> 15:13.580]  And again, he owns a biochemical research laboratory, and really is at another level
[15:13.580 --> 15:17.180]  when it comes to understanding all this than even I am, I'm just going off the main line
[15:17.180 --> 15:20.260]  of research and what other medical doctors and scientists are saying.
[15:20.260 --> 15:23.980]  So I will destroy your text over right now, please take the live feeds at infowars.com,
[15:23.980 --> 15:27.700]  the band.video, share it with everyone you know, and please tell folks about those local
[15:27.700 --> 15:33.460]  AM and FM stations and TV stations, that's how the show is involved in a chain reaction.
[15:33.460 --> 15:37.860]  Everywhere I go, I run into listeners and viewers, even when I'm on a vacation, who
[15:37.860 --> 15:39.980]  are aware of what's happening and tell me to keep fighting.
[15:39.980 --> 15:43.780]  Well, I'm going to keep fighting, but I'm asking them to keep fighting by simply spreading
[15:43.780 --> 15:48.780]  the word about the broadcasting, telling folks the truth lives at infowars.com.
[15:48.780 --> 15:57.020]  Tomorrow's news today.
[15:57.020 --> 16:01.340]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point, it's very bittersweet.
[16:01.340 --> 16:04.140]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[16:04.140 --> 16:06.940]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that, I care about beating
[16:06.940 --> 16:07.940]  the new world border.
[16:07.940 --> 16:13.060]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[16:13.060 --> 16:16.260]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us, for a lot of reasons
[16:16.260 --> 16:19.940]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[16:19.940 --> 16:23.540]  the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[16:23.540 --> 16:28.340]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at infowars.com, they're great products, plus
[16:28.340 --> 16:29.740]  they fund the operation.
[16:29.740 --> 16:32.580]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[16:32.580 --> 16:33.740]  Do they fund freedom?
[16:33.740 --> 16:34.940]  No, a lot of them don't.
[16:34.940 --> 16:39.620]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[16:39.620 --> 16:41.420]  up and looking for truth.
[16:41.420 --> 16:43.060]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[16:43.060 --> 16:46.500]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[16:46.500 --> 16:49.980]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[16:49.980 --> 16:53.420]  Download everything we've done, you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're
[16:53.420 --> 16:57.980]  going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[16:57.980 --> 17:04.020]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia with no evidence for the shutdown
[17:04.020 --> 17:09.140]  of the East Coast gasoline pipeline that goes from Houston right up through New York City
[17:09.140 --> 17:12.460]  and supplies more than half of the gasoline of the East Coast.
[17:12.460 --> 17:17.740]  Who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline from Canada to the Midwest to Houston
[17:17.740 --> 17:22.020]  to refine the oil that's then turned into gas and sent to the East Coast?
[17:22.020 --> 17:23.020]  That's right.
[17:23.020 --> 17:27.340]  Joe Biden shut down the Keystone pipeline right after it was completed.
[17:27.340 --> 17:29.500]  Joe Biden did that to America.
[17:29.500 --> 17:30.580]  He has the history.
[17:30.580 --> 17:31.580]  He has the background.
[17:31.580 --> 17:35.020]  He's the one that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels.
[17:35.020 --> 17:39.100]  He's the one that's trying to extend the lockdowns of the country.
[17:39.100 --> 17:43.340]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world
[17:43.340 --> 17:48.020]  and they want the United States, Europe and Australia crippled so Communist China can
[17:48.020 --> 17:49.020]  be dominant.
[17:49.020 --> 17:50.540]  It's not Russia that's the enemy.
[17:50.540 --> 17:55.260]  It's Communist China and their millions like Joe Biden in control of the White House.
[17:55.260 --> 17:56.260]  That's the facts.
[17:56.260 --> 18:00.780]  That's the information.
[18:00.780 --> 18:14.460]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:14.460 --> 18:32.980]  The
[18:32.980 --> 18:43.380]  debate that was had a long time ago that you were not told about, that overall we
[18:43.380 --> 18:52.740]  the people of planet Earth were not told about, was are there too many humans?
[18:52.740 --> 18:55.980]  Are we going to kill the planet?
[18:55.980 --> 19:02.980]  And do we need to run an operation to depopulate and keep the human population of Earth down
[19:02.980 --> 19:06.820]  to a minimum?
[19:06.820 --> 19:17.300]  And at a more deep level than that is the debate of what is it about humans?
[19:17.300 --> 19:19.980]  Why are we different?
[19:19.980 --> 19:25.820]  And so the elite that want to keep the human population at a low, they know about divine
[19:25.820 --> 19:26.820]  intervention.
[19:26.820 --> 19:28.820]  They know there's something special about humanity.
[19:28.820 --> 19:30.700]  That's an obvious one.
[19:30.700 --> 19:32.300]  But they don't want you to know that.
[19:32.300 --> 19:34.100]  They don't want you to know you're special.
[19:34.100 --> 19:37.060]  They don't want you to know that God has a plan for you.
[19:37.060 --> 19:38.380]  There is a grand design.
[19:38.380 --> 19:40.060]  There is a creator.
[19:40.060 --> 19:41.700]  This is an incredible consciousness.
[19:41.700 --> 19:43.620]  This is a gift from God.
[19:43.620 --> 19:45.020]  This is a human experience.
[19:45.020 --> 19:48.220]  This is divine.
[19:48.220 --> 19:50.860]  So first they realize that they know it.
[19:50.860 --> 19:54.660]  Anybody who wants to be realistic doesn't mean you believe in one religion or the other.
[19:54.660 --> 19:55.820]  You're just realistic.
[19:55.820 --> 19:58.140]  This is we are created.
[19:58.140 --> 19:59.780]  There was divine intervention.
[19:59.780 --> 20:06.220]  Nature separates human from every other form of life and consciousness that we know of.
[20:06.220 --> 20:10.780]  So once that conclusion was reached by the Illuminati, the elite, you can either share
[20:10.780 --> 20:13.300]  that with the rest of the world or you can try to keep the world in the dark.
[20:13.300 --> 20:18.380]  But that's the next level or the level behind the level we're at now, which is there was
[20:18.380 --> 20:23.260]  a debate had, do we have to keep Earth's population at a minimum?
[20:23.260 --> 20:30.780]  And then you see public documents about this and you have statues like the Georgia Guidestones
[20:30.780 --> 20:33.580]  about this.
[20:33.580 --> 20:37.300]  And now you're living it.
[20:37.300 --> 20:43.820]  But the debate is not just do we have to maintain the human population below a certain level
[20:43.820 --> 20:44.820]  if you follow the Georgia Guidestones.
[20:44.820 --> 20:51.540]  I think it's 500 million on Earth is the maximum level.
[20:51.540 --> 20:59.500]  How do you justify running such an operation?
[20:59.500 --> 21:04.460]  And there's a bunch of different justifications you could use and there's all kinds of different
[21:04.460 --> 21:14.220]  levels of humanity or empathy or morals that you could go through to guide you.
[21:14.220 --> 21:23.140]  But ultimately it's the classic form of karma or the metaphysical universe where, as is
[21:23.140 --> 21:33.580]  tradition in Satanism, when applied to a group of people, as long as you tell somebody what
[21:33.580 --> 21:39.220]  you're going to do to them and then they accept it, which is even a form of common law, then
[21:39.220 --> 21:41.260]  you're not liable.
[21:41.260 --> 21:42.740]  You're not guilty.
[21:42.740 --> 21:45.820]  You shouldn't feel bad.
[21:45.820 --> 21:52.660]  So the conversation that happened was if, whether it's the Chinese Communist or the
[21:52.660 --> 21:58.540]  United States government or something above board of that or the medical industry, big
[21:58.540 --> 22:08.780]  pharma institutions, if they're all part of a population control agenda, but they have
[22:08.780 --> 22:13.940]  a vaccine that's going to be the keystone, that's going to be the cornerstone or just
[22:13.940 --> 22:20.700]  vaccines in general or whatever the medical industry, medical tyranny is pushing, right
[22:20.700 --> 22:25.700]  now it's the vaccines, maybe it's microchips later or whatever, right now it's the vaccines
[22:25.700 --> 22:33.500]  and they figure, well look, if we put out a vaccine and we've done no human testing,
[22:33.500 --> 22:39.140]  we've done animal testing, it kills all the animals, we put adjuvants and ingredients
[22:39.140 --> 22:45.140]  in the vaccine that we know are deadly, we put the ingredients out, so it's like, hey,
[22:45.140 --> 22:50.020]  if I come up to you with a gun and a bullet in the chamber and say, this is loaded, can
[22:50.020 --> 22:51.020]  I blow your brains out?
[22:51.020 --> 22:54.580]  And they say, yeah, blow my brains out and then boom, you blow them out.
[22:54.580 --> 22:55.580]  Do you feel guilty?
[22:55.580 --> 22:57.300]  No, the globalists don't think so.
[22:57.300 --> 22:58.500]  The world elite don't think so.
[22:58.500 --> 23:00.460]  They think that that's justified.
[23:00.460 --> 23:07.540]  So hundreds of millions of Americans, billions of people line up to get the vaccine, I got
[23:07.540 --> 23:11.820]  a free donut, I got a free beer.
[23:11.820 --> 23:17.140]  The way Bill Gates, for example, probably looks at that, it says, if you're that dumb
[23:17.140 --> 23:23.340]  that I can lure you into a death trap, lure you into a possible deadly scenario with a
[23:23.340 --> 23:30.380]  free donut or a free cheeseburger or a free basket of fries, then you deserve to die.
[23:30.380 --> 23:35.500]  You're the devil of the fittest.
[23:35.500 --> 23:43.060]  And once you can boil down to that key understanding of planet Earth in the year 2021, and then
[23:43.060 --> 23:50.820]  you can exponentially apply that to everything else you're seeing, it starts to make sense.
[23:50.820 --> 23:58.540]  You become a master builder, as they say in the popular Lego movie, or in the They Live
[23:58.540 --> 24:02.820]  scenario, that's when you put the glasses on, or in the Matrix scenario, that's when
[24:02.820 --> 24:05.700]  you take the red pill.
[24:05.700 --> 24:07.260]  And then everything starts to make sense.
[24:07.260 --> 24:10.860]  And then you can start to apply that.
[24:10.860 --> 24:16.900]  But until you've accepted that that's the reality, until you understand that's the planet you
[24:16.900 --> 24:23.620]  live on, until you start to put two and two together and realize, yeah, there's all this
[24:23.620 --> 24:27.540]  corruption on planet Earth, none of this seems to make sense.
[24:27.540 --> 24:33.860]  But then you can trace it back to that core operating system running the planet.
[24:33.860 --> 24:37.860]  Then you can start to make sense of it.
[24:37.860 --> 24:43.540]  But maybe, maybe we've been taking the wrong approach here.
[24:43.540 --> 24:47.740]  Maybe we should be having the debate that was already had, instead of saying, hey, these
[24:47.740 --> 24:51.620]  vaccines are deadly, hey, look at all the people that are dying.
[24:51.620 --> 25:00.820]  I mean, look, we can go back intellectually, which is not even ancient history, but I mean,
[25:00.820 --> 25:07.460]  it's still like the last level that we didn't even win, which is, hey, look, you know how
[25:07.460 --> 25:10.980]  much money has been blown up in the middle of the air above Israel?
[25:10.980 --> 25:15.300]  Yeah, tens of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars actually, yeah, just
[25:15.300 --> 25:17.340]  blown up over the sky.
[25:17.340 --> 25:19.780]  People getting paid millions of dollars for that, that's war.
[25:19.780 --> 25:24.900]  That's that old thing called war, war is a racket, Smedley Butler, 1942, yeah, that old
[25:24.900 --> 25:28.260]  population control war, yeah, that's an old one.
[25:28.260 --> 25:33.100]  Again, we didn't figure that out, we're still fighting wars, okay, fine.
[25:33.100 --> 25:36.260]  And the elites are still making hundreds of millions of dollars blowing up rockets over
[25:36.260 --> 25:42.580]  Israel and distracting us with that ancient tribalism that happens there, which by the
[25:42.580 --> 25:48.740]  way, we've got a big announcement about that, I'll come, I'll announce coming up in the
[25:48.740 --> 25:55.740]  next segment, but maybe we should just have the debate, should we be purging the planet
[25:55.740 --> 25:59.380]  of billions of people?
[25:59.380 --> 26:02.660]  I know people that have gotten the vaccine, I have friends that have gotten the vaccine,
[26:02.660 --> 26:06.340]  I wish they would have listened to me, some of them say, hey, I feel sick now, wish I
[26:06.340 --> 26:10.260]  would have listened to you, okay, I mean, what do you want?
[26:10.260 --> 26:16.020]  You listen to Bill Gates, the guy that said he wants to depopulate the planet, pure choice,
[26:16.020 --> 26:17.140]  but that still breaks my heart.
[26:17.140 --> 26:20.700]  But maybe, but maybe that's the thing, maybe we need to change our tactic, not saying,
[26:20.700 --> 26:27.300]  look the vaccines are deadly, or look war's a racket, you know, that didn't catch on.
[26:27.300 --> 26:31.660]  So maybe it's, let's just have the debate, maybe we should just have the debate that
[26:31.660 --> 26:35.980]  the secret government, shadow government, world elites had years ago, hey, should we
[26:35.980 --> 26:40.820]  be culling the population or they're too much humans, should we kill billions of people?
[26:40.820 --> 26:46.860]  Because some people have already made that decision for you.
[26:46.860 --> 26:50.780]  And I'm gonna make a big announcement when we come back on the other side of this segment,
[26:50.780 --> 26:54.540]  and we're gonna open the phone lines for the topic that we discussed yesterday, don't go
[26:54.540 --> 26:56.660]  anywhere to the Alex Jones show.
[26:56.660 --> 27:04.620]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden, and now that all the
[27:04.620 --> 27:08.820]  lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[27:08.820 --> 27:16.180]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing, they will do whatever they are told, as if
[27:16.180 --> 27:23.900]  obedience is a virtue, it is the patriot of the world versus everybody else.
[27:23.900 --> 27:30.620]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
[27:30.620 --> 27:36.500]  against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance
[27:36.500 --> 27:43.260]  to the same, that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation for purpose
[27:43.260 --> 27:50.140]  of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can, so help
[27:50.140 --> 27:51.140]  me God.

[28:55.420 --> 29:00.220]  Warning, warning, warning.
[29:00.220 --> 29:05.100]  The globalists have launched a massive counter offensive against populist forces worldwide.
[29:05.100 --> 29:09.620]  They are censoring, they are attacking, they are arresting patriots all over the world.
[29:09.620 --> 29:14.420]  In Europe, Australia, the U.K. and Canada, and even California and New York are being
[29:14.420 --> 29:18.340]  swat-teamed and closed because they are non-essential.
[29:18.340 --> 29:23.420]  The tyranny is incredible, but in areas like Texas and South Dakota and Florida where we
[29:23.420 --> 29:27.940]  have a history of more liberty, all the lockdowns are over, ladies and gentlemen.
[29:27.940 --> 29:33.340]  This is martial law, this has all been a massive martial law drill, and now it is more important
[29:33.340 --> 29:37.100]  than ever to spread the word about Infowars and to support Infowars.
[29:37.100 --> 29:40.700]  We have three of our best-selling products selling out, but despite that, they're all
[29:40.700 --> 29:42.060]  massively discounted.

[29:50.380 --> 29:51.380]  as well.
[29:51.380 --> 29:57.220]  Best deal ever, take advantage of it at InfowarsStore.com and fund the Infowar.
[29:57.220 --> 30:03.660]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[30:03.660 --> 30:08.460]  On the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[30:08.460 --> 30:10.780]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[30:10.780 --> 30:14.300]  Could their objective be world domination?
[30:14.300 --> 30:17.580]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[30:17.580 --> 30:22.620]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[30:22.620 --> 30:25.740]  80% of humanity is in hand.
[30:25.740 --> 30:29.820]  The globalist fear this film made 14 years ago, it is the blueprint for their plan to
[30:29.820 --> 30:30.820]  figure the world.
[30:30.820 --> 30:31.820]  It is the blueprint for the great reset.
[30:31.820 --> 30:32.820]  It is in-game.
[30:32.820 --> 30:37.260]  The blueprint for global enslavement, available right now at InfowarsStore.com with a zero
[30:37.260 --> 30:40.260]  country code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[30:40.260 --> 30:44.460]  I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at InfowarsStore.com.
[30:44.460 --> 30:48.740]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it, and if you take that action, I demand
[30:48.740 --> 30:52.260]  you tell others you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well.
[30:52.260 --> 31:00.340]  That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[31:00.340 --> 31:07.340]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:07.340 --> 31:28.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, hosting the Alex Jones show on this Wednesday
[31:28.340 --> 31:34.180]  May 19th.
[31:34.180 --> 31:39.940]  It's hard to even stay focused on the news, just with everything going on and the epicness,
[31:39.940 --> 31:45.900]  but frankly, of the Infowars platform right now, and I'm just like, I don't know, like
[31:45.900 --> 31:48.100]  a deer in the headlights.
[31:48.100 --> 31:51.980]  But here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to give you a program note of what's coming
[31:51.980 --> 31:55.460]  up on the show for the rest of the day here.
[31:55.460 --> 32:01.740]  So we've got Dr. Stella Emanuel joining me in the third hour, that's the one o'clock
[32:01.740 --> 32:08.940]  hour, and then we're going to have some special reports in the final hour today from Alex
[32:08.940 --> 32:13.620]  Jones and an unseen, unerred interview of Darren McGreen and Larry Pinkney, one of the founders
[32:13.620 --> 32:14.620]  of the Black Panthers.
[32:14.620 --> 32:22.300]  That's going to be in the fourth hour after Stella Emanuel joins us, the great doctor.
[32:22.300 --> 32:26.460]  I'll also be hosting the War Room again today, and we've got great guests coming on the War
[32:26.460 --> 32:32.860]  Room like Dan Lyman, and is it, was it Mike Adams on the second hour, guys?
[32:32.860 --> 32:40.100]  I think it's Mike Adams, and he's got breaking news at naturalnews.com, so it's just loaded
[32:40.100 --> 32:44.180]  coming up today at Infowars.
[32:44.180 --> 32:49.220]  Now I've got an announcement to make, and I'm also going to open up the phone lines,
[32:49.220 --> 32:54.500]  and we're going to take nothing but calls on a specific subject that we told you about
[32:54.500 --> 32:58.380]  yesterday in the second hour.
[32:58.380 --> 33:01.380]  But before I do that, let me just take care of a couple things.
[33:01.380 --> 33:08.500]  First of all, well, let me do this first, and announce, just let me just make the big
[33:08.500 --> 33:10.620]  announcement here.
[33:10.620 --> 33:15.820]  So we're about to do something that should be the norm.
[33:15.820 --> 33:21.820]  It should be happening every night, other news stations, other media outlets, other broadcast
[33:21.820 --> 33:25.740]  transmission hubs, should be doing the exact same thing that we're about to be doing next
[33:25.740 --> 33:26.900]  week every night.
[33:26.900 --> 33:32.980]  It shouldn't just be Infowars having to take all these burdens with our crew here on our
[33:32.980 --> 33:39.780]  battered mothership, but just like the Millennium Falcon, we just keep going into every battle.
[33:39.780 --> 33:46.380]  So next Tuesday, we are launching the first, this could become a series, the first, the
[33:46.380 --> 33:51.060]  great debate, Middle East in crisis.
[33:51.060 --> 33:56.260]  And right now the plan is for myself and Alex Jones and Harrison Smith to be the moderators,
[33:56.260 --> 33:59.940]  like they have moderators, multiple moderators for presidential debates, and it will be Nick
[33:59.940 --> 34:03.700]  Fuentes and Robert Barnes.
[34:03.700 --> 34:05.300]  So the first may be a series.
[34:05.300 --> 34:06.500]  We may make a series out of this.
[34:06.500 --> 34:07.500]  I think it would be great.
[34:07.500 --> 34:10.860]  We'll be filling a void that nobody else seems to want to fill, even though our crew already
[34:10.860 --> 34:15.100]  works like 15 hours a day, but you know, that's fine, seven days a week.
[34:15.100 --> 34:20.980]  The great debate Middle East in crisis next Tuesday evening, May 25th, 6 p.m., so that's
[34:20.980 --> 34:26.580]  directly following the war room, Nick Fuentes versus Bob Barnes.
[34:26.580 --> 34:30.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, we should be having debates like this every night.
[34:30.100 --> 34:35.100]  Now Nick Fuentes and Bob Barnes probably agree on most things, but they disagree on what's
[34:35.100 --> 34:36.580]  happening right now in Israel.
[34:36.580 --> 34:38.500]  I think it's going to be a great debate.
[34:38.500 --> 34:41.820]  And they both have respect for one another, so it's going to be cordial, but it's going
[34:41.820 --> 34:42.820]  to be passionate.
[34:42.820 --> 34:47.060]  And I'm looking forward to that, and I'm looking forward to moderating it, and the exclusive
[34:47.060 --> 34:48.780]  link is greatdebate.news.
[34:48.780 --> 34:53.700]  Now, this could become a series we end up doing here, but you notice how you don't have political
[34:53.700 --> 34:54.700]  debates anymore.
[34:54.700 --> 34:59.860]  They canceled the presidential debates, Democrats and Republicans never have debates.
[34:59.860 --> 35:04.420]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, AOC, agreed to debate her and then bailed out of that.
[35:04.420 --> 35:07.180]  So I mean, nobody wants to have these debates.
[35:07.180 --> 35:12.340]  So again, if Infowars has to fill that void again and push that ball again, we'll do it.
[35:12.340 --> 35:16.340]  So we've launched greatdebate.news, and this will be the first and potentially a series.
[35:16.340 --> 35:21.780]  We'll see the great debate, Middle Eastern crisis, Nick Fuentes and Bob Barnes next Tuesday
[35:21.780 --> 35:26.620]  evening, 6 p.m. central following the Infowars war room.
[35:26.620 --> 35:27.740]  I wish we'd have more debate.
[35:27.740 --> 35:29.460]  I wish the left and the right would debate.
[35:29.460 --> 35:30.700]  We need to have more discussion.
[35:30.700 --> 35:31.700]  We need to debate these issues.
[35:31.700 --> 35:35.100]  Of course, we know why liberals won't debate because they are clueless on the issues and
[35:35.100 --> 35:37.060]  they know they would lose the debate.
[35:37.060 --> 35:44.700]  But the irony of this is that the whole reason why we reached this point with Fuentes and
[35:44.700 --> 35:50.340]  Barnes coming up is because Dave Rubin blocked Nick Fuentes on Twitter when he asked him
[35:50.340 --> 35:53.700]  to have a debate with them on the Middle Eastern crisis.
[35:53.700 --> 35:57.620]  So now you have censors on the right, just like you do on the left, and you have people
[35:57.620 --> 36:01.340]  that are afraid of free speech on the right, just like you have them on the left.
[36:01.340 --> 36:04.700]  So that's not a very good sign at all.
[36:04.700 --> 36:05.700]  But there you go.
[36:05.700 --> 36:14.340]  Now, this is only possible for us to do stuff like this with your financial support at InfowarsStore.com,
[36:14.340 --> 36:16.620]  period.
[36:16.620 --> 36:22.180]  And we're already at full capacity here as far as the operating capacity, the staff capacity.
[36:22.180 --> 36:26.500]  I mean, quite frankly, we need more, but we're at budget capacity as well.
[36:26.500 --> 36:32.260]  Now, Alex is out of town, and so I don't have to explain to you how funds go down when Alex
[36:32.260 --> 36:33.260]  takes a vacation.
[36:33.260 --> 36:35.060]  That's why Negover takes a vacation.
[36:35.060 --> 36:36.900]  I know I'm not Alex Jones.
[36:36.900 --> 36:42.620]  Most people tune out when they hear my voice, and most people just aren't familiar with
[36:42.620 --> 36:44.380]  me like they are Alex.
[36:44.380 --> 36:47.380]  So when we talk about InfowarsStore.com, it doesn't have near the effect.
[36:47.380 --> 36:49.700]  But folks, go to InfowarsStore.com.
[36:49.700 --> 36:51.780]  Do Alex a vacation favor?
[36:51.780 --> 36:56.060]  Make him feel more comfortable about going on vacation and having me in the chair here
[36:56.060 --> 36:58.060]  running things.
[36:58.060 --> 37:03.140]  Buy something at InfowarsStore.com, spend $50, spend $100, spend $200.
[37:03.140 --> 37:06.940]  Let Alex come back from his vacation and see that the coffers were filled while he was
[37:06.940 --> 37:07.940]  gone.
[37:07.940 --> 37:10.740]  Give him some peace of mind, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:10.740 --> 37:13.500]  Get the new fizzy magnesium formula.
[37:13.500 --> 37:16.700]  Get the new ultimate fish oil, 50% off.
[37:16.700 --> 37:21.740]  Get Winter Sun Plus, which we still have in stock, 50% off.
[37:21.740 --> 37:25.500]  There's so many great supplements at InfowarsStore.com.
[37:25.500 --> 37:27.420]  I start every day with vitamin mineral fusion.
[37:27.420 --> 37:28.580]  It's one of my favorite.
[37:28.580 --> 37:33.340]  I take not all the Infowars supplements, but all the ones that I feel that I need for my
[37:33.340 --> 37:36.180]  health from InfowarsStore.com, I'm taking as well.
[37:36.180 --> 37:44.740]  So your financial support, your word of mouth, and your prayers are what keep us on air.
[37:44.740 --> 37:47.660]  And so, look, again, nobody else wants to have these debates.
[37:47.660 --> 37:50.980]  I mean, we're not cable news here.
[37:50.980 --> 37:54.060]  We don't have unlimited funding.
[37:54.060 --> 37:59.540]  We're not, you know, we're not embraced and promoted by the mainstream establishment,
[37:59.540 --> 38:03.940]  but you notice you don't see political debate happening anywhere.
[38:03.940 --> 38:04.940]  You notice that.
[38:04.940 --> 38:06.980]  I mean, political debate should be like number one.
[38:06.980 --> 38:09.680]  It'd be the number one rated thing on TV.
[38:09.680 --> 38:12.700]  It's the number one thing our country needs, and you don't get it.
[38:12.700 --> 38:17.140]  So Infowars will deliver on that again next Tuesday night.
[38:17.140 --> 38:20.900]  Nick Fuentes, Bob Barnes, the great debate in Middle East in crisis, moderated by Alex
[38:20.900 --> 38:23.980]  Jones, myself, and Harrison Smith.
[38:23.980 --> 38:30.580]  Now, in the next segment, I'm going to try to cover all of this news I have on my desk.
[38:30.580 --> 38:33.860]  It probably won't even be possible.
[38:33.860 --> 38:37.860]  But I'm going to give out the phone number, and in the second hour today, the entirety
[38:37.860 --> 38:42.980]  of the second hour, so starting with the 12.06 noon central segment all the way through
[38:42.980 --> 38:49.940]  to 1.06 when Dr. Stella Emmanuel is going to be joining me, I want to take your calls
[38:49.940 --> 38:52.500]  specifically on this issue.
[38:52.500 --> 38:54.380]  So we're going to really screen the phone calls.
[38:54.380 --> 38:57.460]  We only want people to call in on this issue.
[38:57.460 --> 39:03.420]  Is your place of employment forcing you to take the COVID vaccine?
[39:03.420 --> 39:07.860]  Is your place of employment forcing you to take the COVID vaccine?
[39:07.860 --> 39:12.500]  Now this could be small business, big business, major corporation, whatever.
[39:12.500 --> 39:16.940]  Is your place of employment forcing you to take a vaccine?
[39:16.940 --> 39:21.380]  Or do you own a business and you're deciding not to force your employees, or you're saying
[39:21.380 --> 39:25.860]  your employees can't take the vaccine, actually, no, people like that?
[39:25.860 --> 39:27.780]  Or are you telling people to take the vaccine and why?
[39:27.780 --> 39:31.380]  So for the entire second hour, that's going to be the subject of discussion.
[39:31.380 --> 39:41.460]  The number is 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[39:41.460 --> 39:45.380]  Is your employer forcing you to take a COVID vaccine?
[39:45.380 --> 39:50.660]  Or if you own and run a business, are you forcing your employees to take the vaccine?
[39:50.660 --> 39:56.100]  And then for the employees that are being forced to take a vaccine, what are you going
[39:56.100 --> 39:59.020]  to do?
[39:59.020 --> 40:00.540]  Are you going to take legal action?
[40:00.540 --> 40:03.420]  Are you going to fight back and just say, no, are you going to try to explain to them
[40:03.420 --> 40:04.420]  why?
[40:04.420 --> 40:05.420]  Are you going to quit?
[40:05.420 --> 40:06.820]  What are you going to do about that?
[40:06.820 --> 40:12.900]  So the phone lines are now open, 877-789-2539.
[40:12.900 --> 40:16.260]  Is your employer forcing you to take a vaccine and what are you going to do?
[40:16.260 --> 40:23.180]  Now I'm not going to start taking calls until six after the noon hour, because when we come
[40:23.180 --> 40:26.420]  back in the next segment, I've got to cover this news.
[40:26.420 --> 40:28.340]  And I won't even get to all of it.
[40:28.340 --> 40:32.820]  And quite frankly, I should, but we really want to open up the phones on this issue and
[40:32.820 --> 40:37.780]  hear from you, because like I said, just one of those things that we have to do that nobody
[40:37.780 --> 40:39.660]  else will.
[40:39.660 --> 40:44.180]  So nobody else wants to host and promote political debates, we will.
[40:44.180 --> 40:47.700]  Nobody else wants to go to the public to figure out what's going on with the vaccines being
[40:47.700 --> 40:50.220]  forced on employees.
[40:50.220 --> 40:52.380]  We do and we will.
[40:52.380 --> 40:55.460]  But after this short break, I'm going to get to all the breaking news stories.
[40:55.460 --> 41:00.740]  One of the most common questions I get on air, but also off air when I'm just out and
[41:00.740 --> 41:05.820]  about is, Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines?
[41:05.820 --> 41:06.980]  How do I warn them?
[41:06.980 --> 41:11.020]  Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it, so many facts.
[41:11.020 --> 41:14.700]  The history of contaminated vaccines, the fact that they have liability protection in
[41:14.700 --> 41:19.900]  the U.S. and Europe, the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses
[41:19.900 --> 41:24.660]  and other things to vaccines, and the whole history of secret experimentation on at-risk
[41:24.660 --> 41:27.700]  groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans.
[41:27.700 --> 41:28.700]  The list goes on and on.
[41:28.700 --> 41:34.580]  But what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress and so did the head of the CDC
[41:34.580 --> 41:41.940]  in late May of 2021 that around half of the NIH CDC staff, medical doctors, neurologist
[41:41.940 --> 41:44.740]  scientists have refused to take the vaccine and don't take it safe?
[41:44.740 --> 41:48.940]  Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it, that's the same thing in
[41:48.940 --> 41:51.740]  the private practice, is out there somewhere numbers, that that's not something I'm going
[41:51.740 --> 41:52.740]  to be taking.
[41:52.740 --> 41:54.180]  That's very, very simple.
[41:54.180 --> 41:55.820]  There's your answer.
[41:55.820 --> 42:04.300]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at
[42:04.300 --> 42:07.500]  surviving in this crazy environment when you have high-quality fish oil, and we've got
[42:07.500 --> 42:08.620]  the best out there.
[42:08.620 --> 42:14.060]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available, and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[42:14.060 --> 42:17.060]  Everybody already knows what high-quality fish oil does, and it costs us even more to
[42:17.060 --> 42:21.140]  put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it, so this is also clean
[42:21.140 --> 42:22.140]  fish oil.
[42:22.140 --> 42:25.060]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock, 50% off.
[42:25.060 --> 42:28.140]  Grille oil is sent to sell out, it's amazing as well.
[42:28.140 --> 42:34.140]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.
[42:34.140 --> 42:38.880]  Get your fish oil now back in stock at infowarstore.com, and when I forget to take it, I really
[42:38.880 --> 42:39.880]  feel it.
[42:39.880 --> 42:42.780]  When I take a couple of them before I go to sleep at night, it makes my dreams even more
[42:42.780 --> 42:43.780]  amazing.
[42:43.780 --> 42:44.940]  Well, I just thought I was joking.
[42:44.940 --> 42:47.260]  You've tried it out, and most of you have been blown away.

[45:21.560 --> 45:25.880]  going to be taking your calls is your employer facing you to take a vaccine
[45:25.880 --> 45:30.160]  we've got some breaking news even on that subject real quick Buffalo Bill's GM
[45:30.160 --> 45:35.240]  says team might cut players who refuse COVID vaccine yikes by the way NHL
[45:35.240 --> 45:39.000]  players who got the COVID vaccine are testing positive for COVID and sitting
[45:39.000 --> 45:46.280]  the playoffs out a hockey player they play with like lacerated spleens but
[45:46.280 --> 45:49.800]  oh they get a little fever they have to sit out for COVID after the vaccine
[45:49.800 --> 45:54.880]  Florida employers can require COVID-19 vaccine but can't ask for proof oh you
[45:54.880 --> 46:02.520]  love that and so the left is going to be demanding vaccine IDs now what is the
[46:02.520 --> 46:06.560]  biggest pack of news I don't even know so let me just pick one and go through
[46:06.560 --> 46:11.680]  it now what Joe Biden does is almost completely irrelevant and quite frankly
[46:11.680 --> 46:18.640]  he does nothing anyway but he went to a Ford electric car power power plant
[46:18.640 --> 46:22.920]  yesterday and it barely even made the news and there's a lot of interesting
[46:22.920 --> 46:28.000]  things about this and so it just shows you how they're really pushing electric
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.160]  vehicles I don't know why the only the only conclusion I can reach is that
[46:32.160 --> 46:36.240]  they know down the road and this is why you see with the gas and they're gonna
[46:36.240 --> 46:42.560]  use the gas pipeline outages as an alley-oop for this but that's why you're
[46:42.560 --> 46:46.000]  saying oh don't you wish you had an electric car well what what what powers
[46:46.000 --> 46:50.480]  the electric cars natural gas from the power grid natural coal burning from the
[46:50.480 --> 46:54.600]  power grid so I mean it's all big it's all a big joke and the lithium mines are
[46:54.600 --> 46:57.560]  much worse than the coal mines I mean they make these movies and everything
[46:57.560 --> 47:00.040]  like the coal mines are the worst thing oh yeah really have you seen a lithium
[47:00.040 --> 47:06.960]  mine so Biden goes up there to say to talk about how electric cars are the
[47:06.960 --> 47:10.400]  future you know what the gas pipeline outages everybody wishes they had
[47:10.400 --> 47:18.360]  electric and it's all BS and by the way so but here's the headlines oh I love
[47:18.360 --> 47:25.000]  this one Biden got to test drive Ford's electric f-150 as the Israel Gaza fight
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.760]  is going on but wouldn't spoil his ride and then the media asked him about that
[47:28.760 --> 47:35.480]  and he says I'll run you over literally Biden jokes about mowing down
[47:35.480 --> 47:38.520]  journalists with truck when asked about Israel well here's the thing they
[47:38.520 --> 47:42.200]  wouldn't have to ask you as you're going for a joy ride in a Ford f-150 if you
[47:42.200 --> 47:46.280]  actually did press conferences if you ever addressed the thing publicly but
[47:46.280 --> 47:50.200]  you never have so yeah they have to interrupt you during a nice joy ride in
[47:50.200 --> 47:55.720]  a truck because you haven't addressed the issue to the public because you suck so
[47:55.720 --> 47:58.880]  that's nice threatening a journalist to run them over it's a good thing for
[47:58.880 --> 48:04.240]  Biden there but there's some other interesting things Biden also praised
[48:04.240 --> 48:09.200]  China I'm not kidding you he praised China he said China's doing such a good
[48:09.200 --> 48:13.080]  job with this China's doing such a good job with electric which is a lie at
[48:13.080 --> 48:18.280]  multiple fronts Breitbart has this story Biden in Michigan ignores record
[48:18.280 --> 48:22.280]  allowing China to buy up American electric vehicle industry so yeah
[48:22.280 --> 48:25.080]  China's doing a good job buying up our electric vehicle industry but that's
[48:25.080 --> 48:30.720]  not even it Biden first of all praising China again because I guess he's
[48:30.720 --> 48:35.200]  he's the the hype man for China now as the US president he's the hype man for
[48:35.200 --> 48:48.400]  China but he also not just is praising China but he's saying how we need to be
[48:48.400 --> 48:58.600]  mimicking China oh we need to be mimicking China says Biden yesterday even
[48:58.600 --> 49:03.360]  though China puts out more carbon emission more greenhouse gas emission
[49:03.360 --> 49:08.200]  than every other industrialized country on earth combined so Biden doesn't
[49:08.200 --> 49:11.400]  mention that China's buying up our electric vehicle industry and Biden
[49:11.400 --> 49:14.200]  doesn't mention that China puts out more carbon emissions than every other
[49:14.200 --> 49:18.600]  country on earth combined but he praises China and says they're doing great with
[49:18.600 --> 49:27.080]  electric and we need to mimic China disgusting as Biden is shutting down
[49:27.080 --> 49:33.320]  US pipelines he gives the okay for Putin to open another pipeline going into
[49:33.320 --> 49:38.320]  Germany which to me I think he's just trying to keep Putin quiet Putin could
[49:38.320 --> 49:41.240]  eviscerate Joe Biden tomorrow but Putin's more interested in keeping Russia
[49:41.240 --> 49:46.640]  strong than destroying Joe Biden so Biden figures he could pay him off I guess
[49:46.640 --> 49:53.800]  was starting that pipeline back up but then there's an interesting little
[49:53.800 --> 49:58.360]  ripple here and you can see it in the video and I don't know what this is but
[49:58.360 --> 50:02.040]  other news outlets are reporting on it including the Gateway Punnett Biden caught
[50:02.040 --> 50:06.880]  fake driving someone else is steering vehicle it was all a stunt and you can
[50:06.880 --> 50:12.040]  see in the video and in pictures that the person in the passenger seat with Joe
[50:12.040 --> 50:18.400]  is is clearly grabbing something now I'm not totally convinced this is steering
[50:18.400 --> 50:21.320]  wheel I mean this sounds crazy I mean is Joe Biden that out of it that he can't
[50:21.320 --> 50:26.400]  even drive a car maybe maybe but I mean that that's that's an awful lot of
[50:26.400 --> 50:31.840]  lengths to have like a fake steering wheel like like a driving test or a
[50:31.840 --> 50:34.760]  driving coach vehicle where they have the steering wheel on the right side but
[50:34.760 --> 50:38.600]  it does appear that the person in the vehicle with him as yes we're rolling
[50:38.600 --> 50:44.880]  the slow-motion film here is is steering the vehicle with a second
[50:44.880 --> 50:51.920]  steering wheel as you can see right there and it I mean it looks like a
[50:51.920 --> 50:58.200]  steering wheel what what could my my other notion is that the individual who
[50:58.200 --> 51:03.120]  was in the car with Biden was show was so scared out of his mind that he's in
[51:03.120 --> 51:08.360]  the car with a dementia patient driving at high speeds and now he's next to
[51:08.360 --> 51:12.640]  humans he was probably grabbing on holding on for his life if you were in a
[51:12.640 --> 51:16.720]  car with Biden you'd probably be doing the same thing but hey Biden's cool he's
[51:16.720 --> 51:20.520]  got the aviator sunglasses on you know that's his look right before he sniffs
[51:20.520 --> 51:26.040]  your baby but see it all comes down to this energy companies must immediately
[51:26.040 --> 51:31.200]  halt all new projects for world to meet Paris climate accord target except China
[51:31.200 --> 51:39.680]  except China except China so our coal get shut off our natural gas gets shut
[51:39.680 --> 51:45.440]  off and and we no longer get cheap energy and we can no longer drive cars and
[51:45.440 --> 51:49.080]  so what they're gonna do is it's all gonna be a bait and switch oh drive
[51:49.080 --> 51:53.600]  electric drive electric and it'll probably never happen but they want to
[51:53.600 --> 51:56.440]  get everybody driving electric and then once they can reach a certain
[51:56.440 --> 52:01.320]  threshold of electric vehicles on the road that's when they'll really shut
[52:01.320 --> 52:05.720]  off the gas and coal and then make it impossible to even drive they'll price
[52:05.720 --> 52:11.760]  everybody out of driving is what they'll do and so only the most elite rich
[52:11.760 --> 52:15.400]  people will be able to drive and that's really what they want because driving is
[52:15.400 --> 52:21.480]  one of the great bastions of human freedom that we've ever had so that's
[52:21.480 --> 52:32.440]  why they want to cancel that okay where to go next how about some of the COVID
[52:32.440 --> 52:40.660]  madness here Thomas Massey thought America might like to know this few
[52:40.660 --> 52:43.840]  congressmen or staff or guards are wearing masks in the hallways or
[52:43.840 --> 52:47.600]  offices only on the floor for TV it's all theatrics folks Thomas Massey a
[52:47.600 --> 52:51.680]  great American he again says we've had enough we are refusing to wear our masks
[52:51.680 --> 52:55.680]  on the floor during this vote in spite of Pelosi's threats to take 500 from us
[52:55.680 --> 53:08.160]  every day what a cunning woman she is Nancy Pelosi is a cunning bi itch isn't
[53:08.160 --> 53:17.040]  she mm-hmm and now she's fined she has fined Brian mast representative from
[53:17.040 --> 53:24.920]  Florida has been fined $500 by Nancy Pelosi the cunning woman from San
[53:24.920 --> 53:37.080]  Francisco unbelievable and then this is even more pathetic Marjorie Taylor Greene
[53:37.080 --> 53:42.440]  shares this story proud to join these patriots for a peaceful protest on the
[53:42.440 --> 53:49.360]  house floor against mask mandates and there's one two three four five six seven
[53:49.360 --> 53:57.360]  eight Republicans eight you only have eight people willing to protest against
[53:57.360 --> 54:01.720]  masks you only have eight Republicans willing to stand with Marjorie Taylor
[54:01.720 --> 54:10.440]  Greene the Republican Party is pathetic what a joke so hat tip to Madison
[54:10.440 --> 54:14.600]  Cawthorne and Brian mast and Thomas Massey and Marjorie Taylor Greene and
[54:14.600 --> 54:18.600]  Lauren Bobert and I can't recognize the other three right now at the top of my
[54:18.600 --> 54:24.320]  head but salute to them sorry the rest of your party is a pathetic cowardly
[54:24.320 --> 54:35.760]  joke disgusting I will say I think Mitch McConnell made a good move today I
[54:35.760 --> 54:39.160]  forget what it was either I think he I think he made it wants to ban vaccine
[54:39.160 --> 54:44.320]  passports or something I don't remember Mitch McConnell did do something nice
[54:44.320 --> 54:47.360]  day but Mitch McConnell is not there protesting against the face muzzle
[54:47.360 --> 54:50.520]  nope only eight Republicans we can only get eight to do that only eight could
[54:50.520 --> 54:56.480]  kill up not a single Democrat they're too busy trying to kill all the Jews yeah
[54:56.480 --> 55:05.280]  that's a nice one Democrats are too busy trying to kill all the Jews oh that's
[55:05.280 --> 55:10.240]  what it was Mitch McConnell opposes commission to investigate January 6th
[55:10.240 --> 55:15.320]  he'll you know what I'm praising him too early he'll buckle on that mark my
[55:15.320 --> 55:22.760]  word he'll buckle on that like he buckles on everything else story is at the
[55:22.760 --> 55:26.320]  Gateway Punnett cowards new board new board epic Scottsdale Unified School
[55:26.320 --> 55:29.360]  District Board shouted out of the building over COVID restrictions so
[55:29.360 --> 55:32.520]  this is like the fourth or fifth time that we've seen this I'm sure it's
[55:32.520 --> 55:36.640]  happening other places so America is rising up which is really angering the
[55:36.640 --> 55:40.560]  globalist because then see now you realize that you're under attack and you
[55:40.560 --> 55:43.680]  have a will to survive that pisses them off that that that hurts their
[55:43.680 --> 55:48.600]  exterminate all the humans agenda I'm not gonna say this five times in a row
[55:48.600 --> 55:51.960]  to be obnoxious I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these
[55:51.960 --> 55:58.920]  criminals last week the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the
[55:58.920 --> 56:04.360]  CDC's top brass and workers medical doctors scientists nurses you name it
[56:04.360 --> 56:08.560]  have taken the so-called COVID-19 Frankenstein I'm gonna say the second
[56:08.560 --> 56:15.520]  time around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the
[56:15.520 --> 56:21.080]  franken shots they don't trust it you shouldn't trust it the vaccines have
[56:21.080 --> 56:25.000]  been banned in most countries around the world this is an attack on the American
[56:25.000 --> 56:30.400]  people the people the world this is an absolute red flag smoking gun again
[56:30.400 --> 56:35.240]  let me say it two more times around half the individuals that work at the NIH
[56:35.240 --> 56:39.320]  and CDC the medical staff refused to take the vaccines that's right the doctors
[56:39.320 --> 56:43.640]  nurses do not trust a so-called vaccine and you you shouldn't either
[56:43.640 --> 56:49.000]  they're sure everyone you know about the truth cognitive dissonance is a major
[56:49.000 --> 56:54.280]  issue amongst the left it can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse
[56:54.280 --> 56:58.960]  to accept if you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental
[56:58.960 --> 57:03.800]  condition buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com
[57:03.800 --> 57:08.520]  studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can
[57:08.520 --> 57:13.520]  slightly lower blood pressure decrease triglyceride levels decrease the growth
[57:13.520 --> 57:18.560]  rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses and
[57:18.560 --> 57:24.320]  joints and the digestive system recent studies have suggested that high EPA and
[57:24.320 --> 57:29.800]  DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[57:29.800 --> 57:35.200]  and activity of immune cells it worked for my family and now I can have a
[57:35.200 --> 57:41.040]  logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality get

[57:45.520 --> 57:48.520]  store.com
[57:48.520 --> 58:02.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show all right we're gonna be taking your
[58:02.760 --> 58:06.200]  phone calls after the short segment let me just get some of this other news
[58:06.200 --> 58:12.720]  though before we do yeah we saw this dynamic coming it was pretty obvious
[58:12.720 --> 58:19.120]  black lives matter declares solidarity with Hamas in Israel conflict and of
[58:19.120 --> 58:26.760]  course we saw that and so really this is this is the dichotomy of it just like
[58:26.760 --> 58:32.440]  black lives matter or black people in America Hamas or Palestinians whatever
[58:32.440 --> 58:36.120]  you want to say it's all just a political football that right now the left
[58:36.120 --> 58:42.680]  uses to try to win it when you over with emotion or sympathy points playing the
[58:42.680 --> 58:47.240]  victims so it's the same thing Palestinians will always play the
[58:47.240 --> 58:50.960]  victims Hamas will always play the victims mainstream media literally in
[58:50.960 --> 58:57.320]  camped with the Hamas terrorists playing the victims I mean you can't deny
[58:57.320 --> 59:00.960]  their thuggish behavior going into people's homes throwing rocks at people
[59:00.960 --> 59:05.120]  that have a that have rifles not I mean not a good idea I'm just saying maybe
[59:05.120 --> 59:07.760]  you're in the right maybe or not but you're throwing rocks at guys that have
[59:07.760 --> 59:11.960]  rifles and they're not even firing back kind of like what again so but that's
[59:11.960 --> 59:16.680]  the dichotomy of the cops and black lives matter in the US so Hamas terrorists
[59:16.680 --> 59:21.360]  and Palestinians attack Israel to force people and and and Israel defense
[59:21.360 --> 59:25.080]  people and throw rocks at them and they have guns and they never fire back they
[59:25.080 --> 59:27.920]  just sit there and take it and then the same thing happens in the US police get
[59:27.920 --> 59:31.280]  attacked all day long they have guns but they just sit there and take it so this
[59:31.280 --> 59:38.760]  this this this dynamic was surely inevitable and and but now there's
[59:38.760 --> 59:41.760]  really a fracture inside the Democrat Party and you had Rashida to leave
[59:41.760 --> 59:46.480]  excoriating Joe Biden for being a terrorist I suppose is what she's saying
[59:46.480 --> 59:52.720]  for helping Israel bomb the Gaza Strip and bomb that building by the way it's
[59:52.720 --> 59:56.680]  hundreds of millions of dollars spent or hundreds of millions of dollars blown
[59:56.680 --> 59:59.800]  up in the air over Israel and the Gaza Strip so somebody's making out like a
[59:59.800 --> 1:00:03.440]  bandit that's always nice war's a racket house Democrats just blocked
[1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:07.920]  bipartisan sanctions against those who provide financial support to Hamas the
[1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:11.960]  terrorist group in Israel which it's pretty much an international conclusion
[1:00:11.960 --> 1:00:16.800]  Hamas is a terrorist group so the Democrats want to fund a terrorist group
[1:00:16.800 --> 1:00:22.600]  again the Democrats at least at least some the radical left Democrats are now
[1:00:22.600 --> 1:00:28.200]  on the side of history of kill all Jews so this is like why you had one of the
[1:00:28.200 --> 1:00:32.480]  CNN contributors praising Hitler I don't know why Ilhan Omar and Rashida to
[1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:36.760]  leave an AOC just don't come out as Nazis because I mean you're told the
[1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:40.160]  number one thing about Nazis was kill all the Jews well that's the side of
[1:00:40.160 --> 1:00:45.000]  history there on so just they should come out as Nazis of course the irony is
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:50.280]  not or is lost on them it's not lost on us as they point and call everybody
[1:00:50.280 --> 1:00:54.040]  Hitler and a Nazi they're literally on the side of history of kill all Jews
[1:00:54.040 --> 1:00:59.400]  yet there is a is that a stone toss comic I think a stone cost a stone toss
[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:03.360]  comic of you know the radical left calling people an anti-Semite but now
[1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:09.600]  they realize they're on the side of death all Jews but really it just shows
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:13.440]  how dumb these people are and how they don't really stand for anything and so
[1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:18.080]  they can be manipulated into anything and everything shock pull Democrats blame
[1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:22.800]  Israel not Hamas terrorists for violence in the Middle East so again but hey
[1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:28.640]  Biden okay all the bombings Biden said Israel has the right to defend itself and
[1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:34.800]  and AOC and the Goon Squad are pro kill all the Jews so they're on the same
[1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:41.560]  side of history as Adolf Hitler and the Nazis but don't worry they're not
[1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:45.480]  gonna stop pointing fingers everywhere and saying Nazi Nazi Nazi as they're
[1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:53.000]  literally on the side of kill all the Jews I mean incredible so wow but you
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.920]  know I will just say this here's here's where I stand on this I don't want to be
[1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:01.960]  involved I think that most people in the audience don't want to be involved here's
[1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:07.760]  the problem with the pro-Israel crowd in the United States right now see Israel
[1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:13.040]  or Jews should be thanking the United States of America kissing our boots
[1:02:13.040 --> 1:02:17.720]  every day and and asking us for the support and help but no what do you get
[1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:22.960]  from pro-Israel from the pro-Israel lobby in the United States and all of
[1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:28.960]  their little minions support Israel you have to you must and they demand you
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:35.320]  support Israel no you don't do that you know no no no no no you should be
[1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:38.840]  thanking us every day you should be thanking the United States of America
[1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:43.400]  and Russia quite frankly every day that you haven't been wiped off the map which
[1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:51.120]  is a good thing but it's it's real cringe and it's a real turnoff when Jews and
[1:02:51.120 --> 1:02:54.560]  pro-Israel people demand America support them that's not how this works
[1:02:54.560 --> 1:02:59.560]  listen up Patriots I'm running a sale that's the biggest I've ever run on three

[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:51.680]  the debates that nobody else will because I guess they're too afraid or I
[1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:57.800]  don't know what it is but we're not now as I promised we have the phone lines
[1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:04.320]  loaded the question is your employer forcing you to take a vaccine and what
[1:05:04.320 --> 1:05:07.480]  actions are you going to take in response to that or what are you
[1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:13.240]  considering the lines are lit up from a wide spectrum of industries of people
[1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:15.680]  calling on this so I'm looking forward to this we're going to do this for the
[1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:20.360]  rest of the hour along with some other breaking news that I still have here on
[1:05:20.360 --> 1:05:25.920]  my desk. Let's start with Taylor Taylor calling in from New Mexico
[1:05:25.920 --> 1:05:30.680]  maintenance worker turned down work for not being vaccinated Taylor tell us your
[1:05:30.680 --> 1:05:37.360]  story. Hey Owen man I'm glad to be on the show I just want to say I got some
[1:05:37.360 --> 1:05:42.360]  info wars t-shirt and I'll tell you what I've never been complimented on t-shirt
[1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:48.040]  before but I've always been more complimented on the t-shirt from info
[1:05:48.040 --> 1:05:51.880]  wars man people love them. You know that's such a great story and I understand
[1:05:51.880 --> 1:05:56.000]  you put the info wars on your chest on your back you know there's a
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:00.400]  risk factor that some radical leftist will harass you but the odds are actually
[1:06:00.400 --> 1:06:03.160]  more likely that you're gonna get a handshake you're gonna get a pat on the
[1:06:03.160 --> 1:06:09.120]  back and you're gonna get a smile and a wink and a nod. Yep exactly so yeah I
[1:06:09.120 --> 1:06:13.880]  just want to touch base on the vaccination thing I do maintenance work
[1:06:13.880 --> 1:06:19.360]  I'm self-employed but here lately I've been having people like homeowners and
[1:06:19.360 --> 1:06:23.720]  people that are hiring me they're asking me if I'm vaccinated before showing up
[1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:29.120]  on the job and at first I told them no and immediately you know they'll hang
[1:06:29.120 --> 1:06:34.040]  up and then the second time I said well you know the HIPAA law you know it's
[1:06:34.040 --> 1:06:42.320]  confidentiality and then they'll hang up too so I've lost work over it and it's
[1:06:42.320 --> 1:06:47.040]  it's pretty you know it's starting to you know I'm starting to see the effects
[1:06:47.040 --> 1:06:55.840]  now you know firsthand and it's pretty scary and also you know in my church it
[1:06:55.840 --> 1:07:00.000]  you know we're pretty conservative you know I would say about 95% are you
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  know Republicans and conservatives but they're still getting the vaccine and
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:08.600]  it's scary you know because you look at these people that I've looked up to all
[1:07:08.600 --> 1:07:12.960]  these years you know strong Christians you know a faith and just real wise
[1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:17.320]  people you know getting the vaccine shots and I just I don't get it you know
[1:07:17.320 --> 1:07:22.320]  so I don't understand it at all. Well and this is really gonna be I think the
[1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:26.040]  only test is to say you know what's happening with vaccine shedding but it
[1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:30.720]  will be interesting to see I mean if the entire crew is is vaccinated but like
[1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:34.040]  I don't think anybody at Info Wars is gonna get the vaccine so we're not
[1:07:34.040 --> 1:07:38.080]  around vaccinated people if I go out to you know a grocery store the gym or a
[1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:41.000]  bar or something I don't know who's vaccinated and who's not but in your
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.280]  place of employment you can kind of know hey I'm the only unvaccinated one oh
[1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:48.720]  I'm having different side effects so I think it'll be interesting to see but so
[1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:52.200]  this is the new segregation though this is the new discrimination brought to you
[1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:57.720]  by big pharmaceutical medical tyranny that owns the media and so now you can't
[1:07:57.720 --> 1:08:01.640]  get a job freelancing and maintenance from a lot of people because you're
[1:08:01.640 --> 1:08:05.400]  vaccinated so thanks to the media thanks to the medical tyranny for putting
[1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:10.880]  you in this position Taylor huh? Just real quick on the whole Israel thing you
[1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:15.800]  know you know I support America but I don't support the people that are in
[1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:19.000]  power right now I think they're very corrupt and you know I support Israel
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:22.480]  but I don't support the people that are in power right now I think they're very
[1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:28.240]  corrupt so I'm really happy that y'all having this debate you know coming up
[1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:33.320]  next Tuesday because people do need to have this debate and you know killing
[1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:38.240]  innocent people isn't you know you shouldn't be supportive any of that so
[1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:42.960]  it's pretty scary to see a lot of even even Christians you know they kind of
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:46.560]  they're playing on the Christian part you know like oh we're supposed to support
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:50.760]  Israel which we are but this is anything yeah I mean that's like saying
[1:08:50.760 --> 1:08:54.800]  worse but it's like yeah that's ridiculous like we might as well be
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:59.960]  Israel it might as well be USA yeah and I have I have people in my church that
[1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:03.680]  are supporting this this bombing thing and you know because of you know
[1:09:03.680 --> 1:09:09.520]  biblical biblical there always will be terrorist and and war in the Middle East
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:14.280]  it says it you know they'll always be that right but people are supporting it
[1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:18.720]  in my church and I'm like yeah I don't get it you know I don't have a good
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:22.800]  feeling about well it's a big it's a big topic it has been for for decades if not
[1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:26.120]  thousands of years and we thank you for your call Taylor but I want to get back
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:29.760]  on to the subject at hand but thank you for your call and for shopping at
[1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:34.760]  infowarstore.com we appreciate that let's go to let's see here Rick in
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:39.800]  Tennessee got fired for not wearing a mask new job requiring a vaccine Rick
[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:44.720]  what's your story yes sir well it's a it's a little bit wrong on the
[1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:47.120]  description now I'm sorry maybe I misunderstood when I've talked to you
[1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:50.120]  that's okay you know I normally don't read off of the colorboard like that
[1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:53.720]  because that tends to happen the screening process so I'll probably quit
[1:09:53.720 --> 1:09:57.440]  doing that but yeah go ahead that's okay it's real close I've worked in I've
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:09:59.680]  worked in pigeon forge I was a maintenance supervisor for one of the
[1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:04.080]  resorts here I was on the job for well over two weeks been laid off for the
[1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:07.520]  first round of COVID forever and I finally got this job and on the job for two
[1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:10.360]  weeks nobody's wearing their masks everybody's just happened to have it
[1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:13.400]  to half on its half off its hanging off they're not even wearing it all of a
[1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:16.200]  sudden my boss just says you've got to wear your mask I said I can't do it I
[1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:19.240]  have medical reasons they didn't want to hear that they basically said just
[1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:23.480]  clock out and leave well that's what I did I'm consulting legal counsel and I've
[1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:29.880]  contacted the Tennessee you know EOC and things but the point is now is I have a
[1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:32.920]  couple people I know that still work there and they have got ahold of me and
[1:10:32.920 --> 1:10:36.840]  said hey now they sent out a memo saying that you have to have a vaccine or you
[1:10:36.840 --> 1:10:40.320]  have to wear a mask and if you take the vaccine you have to have you have to
[1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:43.680]  wear a bracelet all the time showing that you wore that you had the vaccine
[1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:50.040]  wow yeah and the good thing is up here is about half the people up here have
[1:10:50.040 --> 1:10:53.360]  just had it you know they've had it now in pigeon forge there's a few companies
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:56.760]  that run everything there so they're gonna do what they do but most of the
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:10:59.720]  people up here in the businesses are saying you know what no mask no nothing
[1:10:59.720 --> 1:11:02.400]  they don't say anything about it I've went to several job interviews since then
[1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:06.680]  and it's tough trying to find a place that doesn't require you to wear a
[1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:09.160]  mask but it's getting easier so a lot of these people are getting fed up with it
[1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:13.920]  so you think this would be such an easier battle to win not wearing a face
[1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:18.040]  muzzle not breathing in your own carbon dioxide being free it's amazing that we
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:22.400]  even have to like fight this battle well here I'm standing outside right by my
[1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:26.000]  chickens here and I got chicken wire around my my fence and what I want to do
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:29.920]  is just put a thing on TV goes okay this this fence represents your mask and
[1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:32.920]  this little bitty tiny pebble that I can throw right through there is the
[1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:37.360]  coronavirus oh yeah they did new videos and stuff out where they show like
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:42.280]  sheet rock and sheet rock as I think like 0.25 microns or whatever and they
[1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:45.880]  put the the medical mask that they tell you to wear for COVID over it and then
[1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:49.120]  they show people's face after busting up sheet rock and the whole face is covered
[1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:52.800]  in sheet rock meaning that the sheet rock dust gets through the mask and the
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:58.000]  COVID particles are 0.001 microns or whatever compared to the 0.25 of sheet
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:01.880]  rock so I mean it's just a complete joke Rick thank you so much for the call
[1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:07.720]  let's go to Philip in Indiana Philip is your employer requiring you to take a
[1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:13.800]  vaccine you know it isn't the thing of a employer they're requiring me to take a
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:20.680]  vaccine that yesterday the state of Indiana and where I was living did a
[1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:29.840]  silver alert for free vaccine they put it over the EAS system came across as though
[1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:37.760]  it was a little kid the law or elderly person law so they're they're putting
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:46.280]  out emergency notifications for free vaccines right and are they requiring it
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:51.560]  I mean what's so so so okay I mean it's the thing of that it's that tactic of
[1:12:51.560 --> 1:12:55.800]  using something that is supposed to alert us to some danger or some serious
[1:12:55.800 --> 1:13:02.160]  incident but but so yeah yeah so taking the emergency alert system and turning
[1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:08.120]  it into a big pharmaceutical marketing firm
[1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:16.400]  anything else Philip well I can give you a joke let's have a joke we got 30
[1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:23.320]  seconds left go ahead all right you had ill on Omar and GZ ping and they had a
[1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:32.760]  running bet and the running bet was is ten million dollars that GZ ping bet
[1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:38.240]  ill on Omar that he could get 60% of the American male population the whale
[1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:46.840]  burka fortunately he won the bet so Ilhan had a call of the slave labor over
[1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:50.720]  there and yeah they're getting now they're getting women to put on the
[1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:54.800]  burka full-time they love it so next they'll be pushing gaze off buildings
[1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:59.600]  bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water soil and
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:03.000]  subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:06.800]  conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:11.000]  pollutants for the first time the bio pros are bringing to the public market a
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:15.440]  suite of bio remediation products to the everyday consumer their first product
[1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:19.840]  they are launching is called bio septic pro a product specifically designed to
[1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:24.200]  establish a healthy septic system bio septic pro contains live microorganisms

[1:15:56.640 --> 1:16:06.440]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:16:06.440 --> 1:16:31.320]  yes ladies and gentlemen the great debate on the Middle Eastern crisis with
[1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:36.640]  Bob Barnes and Nick Quintess Nick Quintess challenged Dave Rubin to a
[1:16:36.640 --> 1:16:40.680]  debate on the issue Dave Rubin blocked him that's how that's how confident he
[1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:46.880]  is on his stance I'm sure so Bob Barnes is going to have that debate and we're
[1:16:46.880 --> 1:16:52.480]  going to host it at great debate that news next Tuesday 6 p.m. central following
[1:16:52.480 --> 1:16:57.920]  the war room we moderated by Alex Jones myself and Harrison Smith so once again
[1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:03.000]  the intrepid info wars going where no other news team no other broadcast
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:07.360]  transmission station will go and it's only possible with your supported
[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:11.440]  info wars store.com we'd like this to happen all the time but most people are
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:16.440]  too scared to either speak their mind too scared to debate with anybody or too
[1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:22.520]  scared to go on info wars so that's the trifecta of fear of cowardice that we
[1:17:22.520 --> 1:17:26.520]  witness here in the media we're going back to the phone lines now we're
[1:17:26.520 --> 1:17:31.640]  asking people is your employer forcing you to take a vaccine we've had a couple
[1:17:31.640 --> 1:17:39.420]  examples so far we go back to the phone lines now and we've got Eric in New
[1:17:39.420 --> 1:17:44.720]  Hampshire you are on the Alex Jones show Eric go ahead hey I wanted to talk to
[1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:50.840]  you brother thanks for calling so my story is my son who's 21 years old
[1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:57.800]  works in a warehouse facility they got a memo that came out that said that they
[1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:03.560]  were going to require every employee to be vaccinated my son is one of two
[1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:08.120]  employees that work there that are not taking the vaccination and they're both
[1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:15.800]  young and their 20s early 20s healthy days so what happened was the rest of the
[1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:22.360]  employees there even the ones that are vaccinated put up a big fuss to HR and
[1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:25.800]  said that it wasn't right what they were doing these guys shouldn't be forced to
[1:18:25.800 --> 1:18:32.560]  take a vaccination to secure their job and within a couple of days the human
[1:18:32.560 --> 1:18:36.440]  resources put out another memo saying that they were no longer going to
[1:18:36.440 --> 1:18:42.440]  require vaccinations so I just think it's important for people to know that
[1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:46.400]  everybody has a voice whether you're vaccinated you're for the vaccination
[1:18:46.400 --> 1:18:52.800]  against it you should do what's right and do what's right and stand up
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:58.680]  everybody even the people you don't necessarily agree with and stand up for
[1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:03.640]  yourself you know don't be bullied don't be in fear don't don't think that you
[1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:08.360]  have to be bullied by these vaccine pro-vaccine new world order huge bullies
[1:19:08.360 --> 1:19:13.320]  stand up for yourself and and there's an example of victory for your sons right
[1:19:13.320 --> 1:19:20.600]  there Eric thank you so much for the call let's go to Bob in New York Bob
[1:19:20.600 --> 1:19:26.960]  what's your story oh and listen to me I love you but listen I am a personal
[1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:34.200]  trainer in New York and so you can guess how my business has gone to 2020 with a
[1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:40.920]  shutdown yeah really cool man you know I like to actually I've been blessed but
[1:19:40.920 --> 1:19:47.040]  I had COVID was good for me personally but it killed I mean I came to talk
[1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:51.720]  about how many businesses but the fitness industry of course went down the
[1:19:51.720 --> 1:19:56.920]  the crap hole so people took it upon themselves go out whatever but I have
[1:19:56.920 --> 1:20:01.680]  luckily I have a good stable of people that love me I love them like they I
[1:20:01.680 --> 1:20:04.760]  can't be replaced so they took me into their homes after a certain period of
[1:20:04.760 --> 1:20:11.640]  time but they're old okay so there are some buildings where because you know
[1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:15.080]  moments in the single family home there's all apartment buildings we're
[1:20:15.080 --> 1:20:19.880]  talking about so I have to go and deal with the co-op to use the gym in the
[1:20:19.880 --> 1:20:23.360]  basement let's say you know these gyms are not anything to write home about
[1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:29.760]  little tiny up formal closet but it did its job for years and years and now that
[1:20:29.760 --> 1:20:33.960]  we're getting to the point where I'm for instance one one client I'm with his
[1:20:33.960 --> 1:20:39.200]  wife is Rachel Maddow 100% and he's kind of cool you know he got the Vax but he
[1:20:39.200 --> 1:20:44.800]  lets me you know I handle him I'm literally we're in close range obviously
[1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:48.880]  right I'm stretching touching his feet touching his shoulders everything so
[1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:52.600]  yeah of course my business went went right down but the co-ops are gonna
[1:20:52.600 --> 1:20:56.280]  probably force me to take a Vax to get back into their buildings and that's
[1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:59.960]  where I step off I'm already off I already left this train you know I'm
[1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:04.000]  just sort of working with who I can but they're gonna try to force me I've
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:08.560]  already lost it well is that gonna become a story just to live I mean I don't
[1:21:08.560 --> 1:21:11.200]  know what the percentage of people that live in New York City that live in
[1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:16.560]  apartments are but I would imagine it's the large majority I mean are they
[1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:20.920]  gonna force you if you're in an apartment building to get a vaccine I mean
[1:21:20.920 --> 1:21:24.040]  can they even do that that would have to be that's that's illegal if they try
[1:21:24.040 --> 1:21:29.000]  that well no kidding I you know I if I have to sit before the board and
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:32.480]  actually put a YouTube video out with the meeting and see how ridiculous they
[1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:35.840]  are I'll do that but pretty much I'm just gonna walk and it's just not worth
[1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:40.480]  it but then to ask anybody to do something like that they're brazen
[1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:43.640]  enough that they yes they will yes they're gonna in turns if you want to
[1:21:43.640 --> 1:21:46.880]  work blah blah blah well yeah guess what I work for myself so I don't work
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:49.640]  do you have to say goodbye to my client you know here's what's gonna have to
[1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:52.200]  happen not only are people gonna have to stand up for themselves but you're gonna
[1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:56.680]  have to make measured responses to this and I mean look and you can handle it
[1:21:56.680 --> 1:22:01.920]  you know one approach is hey have you been vaccinated no oh you need to take
[1:22:01.920 --> 1:22:05.800]  the vaccine to come in say okay tell me what's in that vaccine can you tell me
[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:08.160]  the ingredients can you tell me the side effects and of course they'll have a
[1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:11.560]  blank look on their face and they won't be able to say and he says oh so you want
[1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:14.840]  to force me to put something in my body you're asking me you're requesting
[1:22:14.840 --> 1:22:17.840]  you're demanding I put something in my body and you don't even know what's in
[1:22:17.840 --> 1:22:22.760]  it huh boy that doesn't seem right does it and so you know maybe you can have a
[1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:26.840]  little intellectual victory right then and there with with logic and freedom as
[1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:30.680]  your backdrop but Bob thank you so much for the call let's go to John in
[1:22:30.680 --> 1:22:37.360]  California you're on the Alex Jones show John go ahead hi Owen get to talk to
[1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:46.240]  you this first-time caller at colon basically about my mom are you there
[1:22:46.240 --> 1:22:51.760]  can you me yep you're on air okay all right cool just calling about I'm not in
[1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:58.160]  California you know my mom was out here she was finally made it out of
[1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:03.840]  California to a state that's not requiring that right now and she's working
[1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:12.800]  for a big big box chain store I guess they start with a C and they're
[1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:20.240]  requiring a vaccine and in order for her to not wear a mask she has to show proof
[1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:27.760]  that she has the vaccine and her and others don't want to wear up with her
[1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:33.680]  wear them I'm tired of forcing employees to wear up and everything there's like
[1:23:33.680 --> 1:23:38.840]  a little bit of like division in the company and let's let's let's be
[1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:43.960]  perfectly clear about this this is all I mean I mean it's hard to say it's all
[1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:47.320]  but I mean for the most part this is all Democrats folks this is all liberal
[1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:51.200]  Democrats forcing you to do this that's why states like California and New York
[1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:54.360]  and Democrat governors are saying nope even though the CDC says it's okay to
[1:23:54.360 --> 1:23:58.200]  take the mask off we're gonna continue to mandate masks and Republican states
[1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:02.080]  are lifting the masks so these are liberal progressive Democrats forcing
[1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:07.520]  you into this medical tyranny and it's just incredible I mean but see this just
[1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:11.080]  shows you how they trapped us folks this really shows you how they trapped us
[1:24:11.080 --> 1:24:18.320]  and I mean part of it is just there's nothing you can do but people need money
[1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:22.440]  most people live paycheck to paycheck they can't afford to take time off work
[1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:28.160]  or reevaluate their financial situation so they're they're enslaved it's like
[1:24:28.160 --> 1:24:33.280]  indentured servitude through fiat and they can't take time off work so it's
[1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:38.080]  like now you I mean I just can't believe I this is the reality of the
[1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:45.800]  situation and so this is like this is what it feels like to be a slave forced
[1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:49.040]  to wear the mask forced to take the vaccine feeling like you have no out
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:53.000]  feeling like you have no choice this is how they've trapped us ladies and
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:58.960]  gentlemen I'm a very humble person but I'm also a bold person and so as bad as
[1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:02.400]  things are with the globalist attack humanity all the terrible things are
[1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:06.840]  unfolding I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well

[1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:21.480]  folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry people are really really
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:25.600]  away from the establishment they don't want to go on with the globalist but

[1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:30.440]  Willis tell people to say it when she was flandering around with him
[1:29:30.440 --> 1:29:34.840]  except before after she was in the office scrubbing the floors with her
[1:29:34.840 --> 1:29:42.840]  knees of Mayor Willie Brown anyway she's promoting the not FDA approved
[1:29:42.840 --> 1:29:48.680]  experimental COVID vaccine on Twitter and you know I love seeing the comments
[1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:52.800]  from people who are logically just like hey you know please don't say this I
[1:29:52.800 --> 1:29:56.240]  support you but please don't say it like this is insensitive and I don't want to
[1:29:56.240 --> 1:29:59.000]  take the vaccine or I have this reason not take the vaccine and then they just
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:02.400]  get attacked and it's always the radical left like you're gonna die if you don't
[1:30:02.400 --> 1:30:05.960]  get the vaccine and you deserve it you're gonna kill my grandma she doesn't
[1:30:05.960 --> 1:30:09.760]  deserve it though and it's just like all of this craziness like the vaccine works
[1:30:09.760 --> 1:30:13.480]  it's been proven to work there are no and there are no side effects and you're
[1:30:13.480 --> 1:30:20.200]  just watching all of this happen and it's just and so the look I've got an
[1:30:20.200 --> 1:30:25.000]  entire folder here this is just that was put together this morning by one of the
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:28.480]  crew members I don't know if you can see how thick that is I mean I can give you
[1:30:28.480 --> 1:30:33.360]  a little your radio listener here I'll drop it on the desk all right and so
[1:30:33.360 --> 1:30:38.360]  that that's that's a file a manila folder here that I can't even close and so he
[1:30:38.360 --> 1:30:41.160]  could have kept going and researching I said just get just print me as many
[1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:44.600]  articles that you can find on vaccine side effects and deaths until you can't
[1:30:44.600 --> 1:30:47.560]  close the folder anymore and so he did that and that's that's where it is so I
[1:30:47.560 --> 1:30:53.920]  mean here's here's the book of COVID deaths and side effects here's the book
[1:30:53.920 --> 1:30:57.560]  that was printed out for me before the show it's not even the entire book either
[1:30:57.560 --> 1:31:03.920]  but you know pretty big isn't that pretty heavy yeah and you'll have these
[1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:08.480]  people saying there are no side effects nobody's dying from the vaccine safe and
[1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:12.880]  effective and now and now and now we even know that one of the ingredients in the
[1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:19.960]  vaccine is known to be deadly known to be deadly and so I'm sitting there
[1:31:19.960 --> 1:31:23.280]  thinking it's almost like a visit a magician with a magic trick except it's
[1:31:23.280 --> 1:31:30.400]  not actually a magic trick like just doing a backflip or something and I mean
[1:31:30.400 --> 1:31:36.800]  part of me feels bad because it's like you're going to be you're going to look
[1:31:36.800 --> 1:31:45.240]  like an idiot it's like we're going to be proven right on this again but but then
[1:31:45.240 --> 1:31:48.600]  I realize we've already been proven right on it I don't even have to sit here and
[1:31:48.600 --> 1:31:55.320]  wait we've already been proven right and these people are like in the cave in
[1:31:55.320 --> 1:32:01.120]  Plato's cave chained forced to stare one direction at the wall and all they can
[1:32:01.120 --> 1:32:06.080]  see is the shadows being cast on the wall that's all they can see so the
[1:32:06.080 --> 1:32:10.440]  COVID debt the COVID vaccine deaths are already here the COVID side effects are
[1:32:10.440 --> 1:32:14.840]  already here it's in mass we've already been totally proven right it's not even
[1:32:14.840 --> 1:32:18.800]  that it we need to wait a year we're already completely right on this but
[1:32:18.800 --> 1:32:22.840]  but but these brainwashed and sadly I mean it's just true I'm not politically
[1:32:22.840 --> 1:32:26.920]  divisive really I'm a centrist I'm a realist but the truth is the political
[1:32:26.920 --> 1:32:30.800]  left in this country is mentally retarded and they're sitting here staring
[1:32:30.800 --> 1:32:34.640]  at the wall on Plato's cave saying there's no death from the COVID shots
[1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:38.760]  there's no side effects from the COVID shots everybody has to take the shot to
[1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:43.480]  be a part of their cult and it's sick it's disgusting and I know we're going to
[1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:47.720]  be proven right on this again but they'll never learn they'll never admit
[1:32:47.720 --> 1:32:51.320]  they've been duped they'll never admit they've been forced to stare at the wall
[1:32:51.320 --> 1:33:00.160]  in the cave and and see the shadows being cast upon it for them to see so
[1:33:00.160 --> 1:33:03.840]  yeah the COVID vaccine deaths are already here the side effects are already
[1:33:03.840 --> 1:33:07.400]  here they'll never see it they're chained up and they're only staring at the wall
[1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:12.600]  so the mainstream media won't tell them any of this and one part of me is heart
[1:33:12.600 --> 1:33:16.160]  broken because of it the other part of me says you're gonna get what you
[1:33:16.160 --> 1:33:21.160]  deserve but but that's like but see that it's dirty to feel that way because
[1:33:21.160 --> 1:33:27.720]  that's the Bill Gates mentality that's the elite globalist Illuminati mentality
[1:33:27.720 --> 1:33:36.320]  you're too stupid you deserve to die I'm not the one that feels that way but just
[1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:40.120]  know that that's what's going on here so we go back to the phone lines we're
[1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:43.960]  asking people is your employer forcing you to take the vaccine we've heard
[1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:48.760]  stories this is definitely happening happening this is the new trend we're
[1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:52.440]  gonna have to see what happens I think in the upcoming months about how we're
[1:33:52.440 --> 1:33:56.000]  gonna deal with this are there gonna be new economies that emerge because of
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:00.240]  this just totally unvaccinated economies because the establishment wants only
[1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:05.160]  vaccinated economies that's the whole point is you can't operate in the world
[1:34:05.160 --> 1:34:09.880]  anywhere except in their infrastructure which they own everything and you'll be
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:14.680]  forced to take a vaccine incredible so yeah they shut down all the small
[1:34:14.680 --> 1:34:19.960]  businesses they in the COVID shutdowns in the fake pandemic businesses
[1:34:19.960 --> 1:34:24.680]  economics shut down they shut out all the small businesses so now only the
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:29.640]  major corporations that own everything are still alive and now they're all
[1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:33.280]  gonna force you to take a vaccine and all the small mom and pop shops that
[1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:36.280]  were independently owned and small businesses that were independently
[1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:39.720]  owned that aren't part of the big corporate globalist board that wouldn't
[1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:43.360]  have made you take a vaccine and wear a mask now they're all gone and all you
[1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:48.160]  have left is the corporate board cult globalists who will force you to take a
[1:34:48.160 --> 1:34:54.360]  vaccine and wear a mask and then and then the left the liberal anti-fascist
[1:34:54.360 --> 1:35:00.160]  left can't even can't even look in the mirror and and realize what they've done
[1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:03.600]  they can't even put two and two together and realize what they've done
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:08.320]  because their vision and their mind and their soul and their heart is so
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:13.680]  clouded and filled with hate filled with hate injected into them by the
[1:35:13.680 --> 1:35:18.240]  mainstream media injected into them by Barack Obama injected into them by our
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:27.880]  politicians oh boy it is really sad it is really evil isn't it so we go back
[1:35:27.880 --> 1:35:33.240]  out to the phone lines on this now Greg called in from Ohio you're on the
[1:35:33.240 --> 1:35:40.000]  Alex Jones show Greg go ahead hey Owen Alex and Ron Paul woke me up in 2006 I
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:43.560]  just want to thank you guys for everything that you guys do I'm a
[1:35:43.560 --> 1:35:48.240]  touring entertainment technician and a week ago my employer called me to go
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:53.440]  work on a AAA concert tour after I accepted they told me that I needed to
[1:35:53.440 --> 1:35:56.960]  send proof of vaccination and I told them I'm not willing to take the gene
[1:35:56.960 --> 1:36:01.920]  therapy and they took the offer off the table the company itself does not
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:05.920]  require vaccination but I received another phone call about five minutes
[1:36:05.920 --> 1:36:11.600]  later from the owner and tour suppliers are requiring vaccination for all
[1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:17.200]  contracts and all employees of a tour they're employing COVID officers and
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:25.160]  requiring multiple COVID tests per day and they have that extra personnel to
[1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:29.560]  fill in for people that are sent home from positive tests and you know here's
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:33.760]  what here's what's probably gonna have to happen in the next year or two is and
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:37.800]  I get it folks look I love ballgames and I love concerts and all of this stuff
[1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:44.440]  but any any any institution that is forcing people to take vaccines or
[1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:48.160]  employers to take vaccines we're gonna have to just completely boycott and so
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:52.800]  this is gonna be a struggle but but it's gonna pale in comparison to if we if
[1:36:52.800 --> 1:36:58.120]  we accept this forced medical tyranny injection and so yeah you'll have to
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:02.440]  start going to local concerts and you know doing small events or stuff like
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:05.520]  that or you know just go into your kids ballgame instead of the big one because
[1:37:05.520 --> 1:37:09.320]  that's the that's the seems like a big sacrifice no that's the small
[1:37:09.320 --> 1:37:13.040]  sacrifice we're gonna have to make I think in the interim here while they're
[1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:17.760]  trying to force this vaccine to avoid going under complete medical tyranny
[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:22.560]  exactly the point I wanted to make as well so thank you guys again all right
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:26.840]  thank you for the call let's go to DC calling in from North Carolina you're
[1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:34.680]  on the Alex Jones show go ahead hey over here howdy hey buddy okay got some
[1:37:34.680 --> 1:37:45.560]  things to inform you on so my wife boss is now bribing the employee with $200 to
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:52.480]  go get the vaccine you know that's I mean is this a big business I mean you
[1:37:52.480 --> 1:37:55.160]  don't have to give too much information but that's a lot of money to be offering
[1:37:55.160 --> 1:38:02.080]  people as a vaccine incentive but you know what we've come with a counter
[1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:09.720]  offer of $20,000 for him to sign for any injury from the vaccine damages or the
[1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:14.520]  doctor bills yeah that's a good that's a good bait and switch has hey keep your
[1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:19.640]  $200 just sign this liability form yeah how many of them will back out
[1:38:19.640 --> 1:38:26.920]  immediately exactly yeah yeah so we've got we you know it's the simple rule
[1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:31.200]  everyone in the office unless you're unless you haven't been back seeing you
[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:37.760]  have to wear a mask so that's the simple rule on that so but with no no other
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:42.720]  outrageous rules or anything but well that to me to me though that's that's
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:46.640]  the one though right there it the first line of pushback is okay you want to
[1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:50.080]  force me to take a vaccine just please sign a waiver if anything bad happens to
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:53.120]  me you'll be held liable and I can take you to court and by the way OSHA says
[1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:57.920]  that's okay one of the most common questions I get on air but also off
[1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:03.280]  air when I'm just out and about is Alex what do I say to my family about the
[1:39:03.280 --> 1:39:08.280]  vaccines how do I warn them well the problem is there's so many problems with
[1:39:08.280 --> 1:39:11.840]  it's so many facts it's the history of contaminated vaccines the fact that they
[1:39:11.840 --> 1:39:15.920]  have liability protection in the US and Europe the fact that they've been caught
[1:39:15.920 --> 1:39:20.000]  adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines and the whole
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:24.560]  history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks poor whites
[1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:29.240]  Native Americans the list goes on and on but what about the fact that Fauci
[1:39:29.240 --> 1:39:35.240]  testified to Congress and so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021 that
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:40.920]  around half of the NIH CDC staff medical doctors or all just scientists have
[1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:44.360]  refused to take the vaccine until they can say yeah I think what half of the
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:48.040]  doctors are scared to take it that's the same thing in the private practices
[1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:50.800]  out there somewhere numbers that that's not something I'm gonna be taking that's
[1:39:50.800 --> 1:39:55.560]  very very simple there's your answer when listeners call to the show and thank
[1:39:55.560 --> 1:40:00.720]  me for all I've done I always stop and I say thank you for what you've done thank
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:04.200]  you for keeping info wars on the air thank you for praying for us and thank

[1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:23.120]  my family and it will protect where you go and what you do not because you've
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:27.080]  done something wrong but because the big telecoms big tech and the globalist are
[1:40:27.080 --> 1:40:30.320]  predatory and are evil and in the surveillance state we need to more and
[1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:34.280]  more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're
[1:40:34.280 --> 1:40:38.000]  involved in these are the highest quality highest ratings they're available
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:42.840]  in info or store.com in four different colors and they are only 1995 the exact
[1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:47.120]  same pocket is sold for 2495 or even 2995 everywhere they're available right

[1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:59.280]  privacy and from the info or warning warning warning the globalists have
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:03.520]  launched a massive counter offensive against populist forces worldwide they
[1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:07.280]  are censoring they are attacking they are arresting patriots all over the world
[1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:12.520]  churches in Europe Australia the UK and Canada and even California New York are
[1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:17.440]  being swat teamed and closed because they're not essential the tyranny is
[1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:21.960]  incredible but in areas like Texas and South Dakota and Florida where we have a
[1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:26.640]  history of more liberty all the lockdowns are over ladies and gentlemen this is
[1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:31.320]  martial law this has all been a massive martial law drill and now it's more
[1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:35.040]  important than ever to spread the word about info wars and to support info wars
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:38.160]  we have three of our best selling products selling out but despite that
[1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:44.400]  they're all massively discounted turbo force it's 40% off we've got open fish

[1:41:49.320 --> 1:41:55.520]  deal ever take advantage of it and info or store.com and fund the info war 14
[1:41:55.520 --> 1:41:59.360]  months ago I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world
[1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:04.080]  collapses the third world dies we have such a complex civilization with so many
[1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:08.560]  billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world it causes a
[1:42:08.560 --> 1:42:12.680]  chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:16.600]  world well now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States
[1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:20.520]  that's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely
[1:42:20.520 --> 1:42:24.520]  get the job done before delivering gas had been shut down plus the keystone
[1:42:24.520 --> 1:42:28.320]  pipelines been shut down along with other pipelines the left is now blowing up
[1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:33.160]  dams across the US we're being shut down our coal power plants are off as well
[1:42:33.160 --> 1:42:37.720]  ladies and gentlemen prepare to be a total slave the third world is imploding
[1:42:37.720 --> 1:42:40.960]  as well the borders have been removed until you wake up this is a globalist
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:45.040]  chai-com takeover Gregory said you have no hope they're announcing that there
[1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:49.920]  will be less than two-thirds the gas needed this summer so they told you
[1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:53.040]  that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your
[1:42:53.040 --> 1:42:55.440]  family
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:03.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:23.400]  ladies and gentlemen quickly the Biden Department of Justice is throwing out
[1:43:23.400 --> 1:43:31.240]  all cases most recently the Carter page illegal FISA warrant spy case the
[1:43:31.240 --> 1:43:34.040]  Department of Justice is the Biden Department of Justice is throwing all
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:37.800]  these cases out which just have Barack Obama and his administration with James
[1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:41.560]  Comey and Clapper and Brennan dead to rights for illegally spying ficing
[1:43:41.560 --> 1:43:48.360]  illegal of illegal FISA warrant requests using known bad intelligence to do it I
[1:43:48.360 --> 1:43:51.080]  mean they're all caught dead to rights with everything and the Biden
[1:43:51.080 --> 1:43:53.600]  Department of Justice is throwing all these cases out right now the Carter
[1:43:53.600 --> 1:43:57.440]  page one is the latest so they're covering up their crimes what they do
[1:43:57.440 --> 1:44:01.600]  best over there at the Department of Justice and we can thank Bob Barr for
[1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:04.240]  allowing that to happen as well thanks a lot thanks for stabbing us in the back
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:10.480]  bar we are still taking phone calls before we're gonna be joined by Stella
[1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:15.960]  Emmanuel coming up here at 106 central time the great doctor will be joining us
[1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:19.680]  here on the alex jones show but for now we go back out to the phone lines we're
[1:44:19.680 --> 1:44:25.200]  asking people if your employee is forcing you to take the COVID vaccine we go
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:29.840]  to clown car it's an interesting name to call in with from Brooklyn New York
[1:44:29.840 --> 1:44:39.480]  clown car go ahead well yeah I have an issue in New York City here a bunch of
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:44.240]  the different local unions are getting together and with the OSHA requirements
[1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:50.920]  they're asking that if you're vaccinated that you get picked for certain jobs and
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:56.760]  by the way the the new OSHA statement is that if your business forces you to take
[1:44:56.760 --> 1:45:01.600]  a vaccine and you have a negative side effect they're held liable so if you
[1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:05.080]  want to stand up against this forced vaccine at your place of employment take
[1:45:05.080 --> 1:45:09.480]  that claim with you and say hey I want you to know if anything happens to me
[1:45:09.480 --> 1:45:12.800]  you're forcing me to do this you're gonna be held liable I mean that's huge
[1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:17.080]  hey no one another thing the other day I was at the one that we'll call me out
[1:45:17.080 --> 1:45:20.480]  and they have a blood drive right so I said you know all right I'll give some
[1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:24.080]  blood to the action if I was vaccinated so I said yeah I was vaccinated why she
[1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:28.040]  was oh we can't take it but I said why not they said we don't know we just can't
[1:45:28.040 --> 1:45:38.480]  thank God thank God did you know that though no but you know I was I've been
[1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:42.000]  talking to some nurses just just behind the scenes and some other people and I've
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:45.960]  talked about it on air how one of our big concerns was what if they're what if
[1:45:45.960 --> 1:45:48.960]  people are donating blood that have been vaccinated and then whatever's
[1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:52.680]  happening if that blood ends up being tainted and then you get unvaccinated
[1:45:52.680 --> 1:45:56.120]  people getting hit with the vaccinated blood and then it just spreads forever
[1:45:56.120 --> 1:46:01.440]  it's exponential so I'm glad that blood drives I hope that that's universal that
[1:46:01.440 --> 1:46:05.560]  they're not taking blood from vaccinated people from COVID-19 which which which
[1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:09.080]  the shocking news that you're bringing up here is the fact that they know that
[1:46:09.080 --> 1:46:13.280]  that there could be serious side effects they know not to take this blood just
[1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:16.760]  like they know not to take someone's blood that has you know AIDS they know
[1:46:16.760 --> 1:46:19.800]  not to take someone's blood that's taking the COVID vaccine I mean that's
[1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:25.000]  huge Ryan white effect I guess right I'm sorry what
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  with Ryan white he's the young boy died of AIDS from a blood transfusion right
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:32.480]  right exactly and so they don't want to have that happen to them with the
[1:46:32.480 --> 1:46:37.240]  COVID vaccine blood transfusions exactly oh and I got to tell you past couple
[1:46:37.240 --> 1:46:41.400]  years now since I guess everybody else been experiencing the COVID thing for
[1:46:41.400 --> 1:46:46.120]  year and a half I've been enlightened probably two years prior so I've had a
[1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:50.560]  bit of an issue but then that video has definitely saved a lot of our sanity our
[1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:55.000]  lives probably kept us in the loop with things and really from the bottom of my
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:58.920]  heart I just want to thank you guys also real quick the other day I spoke to
[1:46:58.920 --> 1:47:05.560]  Alex about alright so I'm gonna do this without crying this time so my son got
[1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:08.880]  vaccinated two and a half months old he got a three-in-one he wasn't supposed to
[1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:12.520]  get the three-in-one vaccination so that's why I'm highly against the
[1:47:12.520 --> 1:47:17.760]  vaccination of this not knowing that it's raw I said that I said look a two and
[1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:21.040]  a half month old child died from a three-in-one vaccination I know because
[1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:27.440]  it's my son so and Alex said well they said that it was because of the SIDS right
[1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:31.560]  and I said yeah that's because there's an article now that states that that's the
[1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:34.960]  lie that they give you when they poison and kill your children because what the
[1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:40.160]  answer to SIDS is well God just came and took your child back to heaven and I'm
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:43.800]  standing there like who the fuck am I punching in the face for this one like
[1:47:43.800 --> 1:47:47.640]  who's telling me this dumb shit brother tried to sign us I'm sorry hey man we
[1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:51.760]  got to dump that you curse twice and so now we've we've run out of the dump and
[1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:56.160]  so apologize I apologize we have to cut you off though I mean that's just
[1:47:56.160 --> 1:48:01.600]  heart-wrenching I understand you you kind of lose control talking about that so
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:05.320]  so I don't blame you but we just have to dump you because we for terrestrial
[1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:09.280]  radio we can't say those words and you only have so much time to dump it so
[1:48:09.280 --> 1:48:18.800]  thank you so much for the call but yeah this is you know this is the sick part
[1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:24.880]  about it and this is why when I see these people commenting on the the promotion
[1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:28.240]  of vaccine posts on social media like from Kamala Harris or whatever and it's
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:31.640]  always the left it's just I'm just being honest about it I don't like to divide
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:34.920]  and conquer thing but I just I call it like it is folks it's always the
[1:48:34.920 --> 1:48:39.040]  libtards loving the vaccine promoting the vaccine and you know it's just like
[1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:41.800]  everything else that they want to talk about and act like they're an expert on
[1:48:41.800 --> 1:48:46.680]  they don't know jack crap and they're so insensitive to the realities of the
[1:48:46.680 --> 1:48:50.840]  world and they're so out of touch to the realities of the world and until it
[1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:55.200]  until it smacks them in the face in an embarrassing moment of shame which is
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:49:02.240]  which which is what they all need to experience they'll never get it you know
[1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:05.840]  you'll have all of these people take the vaccine safe and effective and they'll
[1:49:05.840 --> 1:49:08.680]  get angry and they'll get in your face you know why don't you why don't you
[1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:12.480]  listen to one of these people that lost a kid from taking the vaccine and tell
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:15.840]  me that I have to take it and tell me that I have to give it to my kids well
[1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:19.920]  why don't you go ahead and try that one on for size with with with parents
[1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:24.000]  bawling their eyes out because they took a healthy baby to the doctor got him a
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:28.560]  vaccine and they died the next day yeah yeah I'd love to hear you virtue signal
[1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:33.400]  about how great vaccines are to those people you sickos trying to in your
[1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:39.240]  death cult excuse me let's let's go on to the next caller here she's a boy I'll
[1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:46.880]  tell you man I'll tell you it's it's it's six stuff Andy in Washington calling

[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:57.880]  on the show in game I've watched info wars I've been Alex Jones fan for well
[1:49:57.880 --> 1:50:03.760]  over 20 years so thank you for having me on there what'll upset about that
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:09.040]  gentleman I just heard that is child died and that goes into it my cousin works
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:15.080]  for the college local community college first time I went out to lunch with her
[1:50:15.080 --> 1:50:19.920]  very conservative woman her and I were having the backs talks she wouldn't tell
[1:50:19.920 --> 1:50:26.920]  me then she told me that she told her students that if they come to work with
[1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:32.480]  or come to school with COVID they fail go get your vaccine and this is what's
[1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:36.000]  happening in all the schools with the major push with the kids they're going
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:40.560]  to kill people and we need to stand up and try to get this all together now
[1:50:40.560 --> 1:50:44.920]  that's it exactly not have this implemented into our schools into our
[1:50:44.920 --> 1:50:49.640]  workforce if we don't band together human society is done and guess what
[1:50:49.640 --> 1:50:55.240]  we're all organs to those elitists and exactly and that's how they look at it
[1:50:55.240 --> 1:51:00.480]  and they figure hey if you're so stupid that you'll line up like a sleep sheep
[1:51:00.480 --> 1:51:04.560]  for slaughter and volunteer for your own slaughter then they'll mop you up and
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:07.920]  they'll say that they're justified in doing so and so that's that's how the
[1:51:07.920 --> 1:51:11.120]  globalist work that's how the elite work that's how the the new satanic
[1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:16.520]  Illuminati works your you volunteered to be sacrificed to this so we're gonna
[1:51:16.520 --> 1:51:20.760]  we're gonna kill you now and you believe it's for your own good so you
[1:51:20.760 --> 1:51:26.800]  volunteered to be killed in a satanic human sacrifice by this satanic new
[1:51:26.800 --> 1:51:31.760]  world order and you're absolutely right when you talk about this this is a death
[1:51:31.760 --> 1:51:36.680]  cult with the teachers forcing this and of course what's the irony oh don't come
[1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:40.880]  to my classroom with COVID except if you come into their classroom with the
[1:51:40.880 --> 1:51:43.560]  COVID vaccine you're going into the classroom with COVID I mean it's just
[1:51:43.560 --> 1:51:50.400]  unbelievable and how are these people I don't understand we look at the Bible we
[1:51:50.400 --> 1:51:55.080]  look through history and here they are implementing it to the kids we see the
[1:51:55.080 --> 1:51:59.400]  trafficking you guys have been down there on the border you're seeing the human
[1:51:59.400 --> 1:52:03.880]  trafficking you're seeing the kids being taken what are they doing with these
[1:52:03.880 --> 1:52:07.320]  kids are shooting them they're experimenting with our kids what's
[1:52:07.320 --> 1:52:12.240]  going to happen after babies are born with the vaccines two parents with a
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:18.240]  vaccine my mom had a rare disease called far disease it takes one person one in
[1:52:18.240 --> 1:52:22.680]  one million and then on the other half you have to have one in one million to
[1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:27.400]  get this gene to get this disease what happens when the two parents decide to
[1:52:27.400 --> 1:52:32.000]  have intercourse and they purchase this biogenetic child what is that going to
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:37.400]  do to everybody what's going to happen how are we gonna save these people they
[1:52:37.400 --> 1:52:41.640]  are so blind and dumb and they justify it my cousin that I'm talking about her
[1:52:41.640 --> 1:52:47.520]  son my other cousin he's in the Marine Corps conservative he got the Vax he
[1:52:47.520 --> 1:52:52.040]  said that the way the world's going he was going to get it he doesn't care she
[1:52:52.040 --> 1:52:57.080]  said that the most important thing for her is to see her son so she'd get the
[1:52:57.080 --> 1:53:02.600]  Vax to get that passport and she wants to do things and she told me this is my
[1:53:02.600 --> 1:53:06.320]  cousin conservative well if you don't get the Vax I guess you don't want to do
[1:53:06.320 --> 1:53:11.760]  things and I don't see how you could live like that I want to live you want to
[1:53:11.760 --> 1:53:18.280]  live Owen Alex wants to live my son my 13-year-old is anti-vaxxed we want to
[1:53:18.280 --> 1:53:22.640]  we got to put this in together we got a band together but imagine how sick they
[1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:25.880]  are when when that's the thing is oh you don't want to go to these things you
[1:53:25.880 --> 1:53:29.480]  don't want to live what no I want to live free I don't want to live as a
[1:53:29.480 --> 1:53:34.480]  slave you know what I'm saying so I mean that's the thing that they miss is oh
[1:53:34.480 --> 1:53:37.240]  we just want to live that's why we have the vaccines no you want to live as a
[1:53:37.240 --> 1:53:41.640]  slave I want to live as a free man one more segment of your calls and then
[1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:47.120]  dr. Stella Emmanuel joins us I'm not gonna say this five times in a row to be
[1:53:47.120 --> 1:53:51.800]  obnoxious I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals last
[1:53:51.800 --> 1:53:58.840]  week the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass
[1:53:58.840 --> 1:54:04.160]  and workers medical doctors scientists nurses you name it have taken the so
[1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:09.200]  called COVID-19 franken shot I must say the second time around half of the
[1:54:09.200 --> 1:54:16.760]  doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the franken shots they don't trust
[1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:20.520]  it you shouldn't trust it the vaccines have been banned in most countries
[1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:24.000]  around the world this is an attack on the American people the people of the
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:29.440]  world this is an absolute red flag smoking gun again let me say it two more
[1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:34.840]  times around half the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC the medical
[1:54:34.840 --> 1:54:39.400]  staff refused to take the vaccines that's right the doctors nurses do not
[1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:43.040]  trust a so-called vaccine and you shouldn't either they're doing everyone
[1:54:43.040 --> 1:54:50.280]  you know about the truth your brain your heart your bones your liver your eyes
[1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:56.000]  everything has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when

[1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:13.560]  we've got Dr. Phil Omanuel coming up in five minutes we've also got the latest
[1:56:13.560 --> 1:56:18.200]  propaganda from Joe Biden the stories at infowarstore.com with the video Joe Biden
[1:56:18.200 --> 1:56:24.600]  quotes Mao Zedong in speech calling for more women in workforce you know that's
[1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:28.600]  an interesting one isn't it they claim they are all about women's empowerment
[1:56:28.600 --> 1:56:34.720]  but yet they want to disenfranchise them and work them for their entire life so
[1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:39.000]  that's that's that's an irony there but but I digress on that we go back to the
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:46.520]  phone calls let's go to Keith in Oregon we're talking about employers mandating
[1:56:46.520 --> 1:56:52.200]  the COVID vaccine for their employees Keith and Oregon go ahead great show
[1:56:52.200 --> 1:56:58.920]  Owen thanks for taking my call pretty much very real quick last summer they I
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:03.400]  was working in a skilled nursing facility here in Oregon I'm a licensed
[1:57:03.400 --> 1:57:10.120]  nurse and they said hey you know come Monday we're gonna be man mandatory
[1:57:10.120 --> 1:57:14.800]  testing everybody we need you to sign this this papers and that you're gonna
[1:57:14.800 --> 1:57:19.160]  go along with it I'm a bit of a knucklehead and I said no I'm not doing
[1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:23.320]  that and they said why not I said because you're not gonna push me around
[1:57:23.320 --> 1:57:25.720]  you're not gonna tell me what to do you're not gonna look inside my body
[1:57:25.720 --> 1:57:33.680]  and you know you know I have I have the Constitution behind so they didn't like
[1:57:33.680 --> 1:57:37.240]  that very much so I know because they do themselves as more important than the
[1:57:37.240 --> 1:57:43.680]  Constitution now well I think my administrators and the managers were
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:47.080]  receiving a lot of pressure from the state it really wasn't the people that
[1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:51.040]  were I was working for it's more of the state putting a lot sure and I was
[1:57:51.040 --> 1:57:56.960]  speaking in generalities let me be more specific the medical complex the medical
[1:57:56.960 --> 1:58:00.880]  industry views itself as God and so therefore it's more important than the
[1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:05.160]  US Constitution it's more important than your freedom that appears to be the
[1:58:05.160 --> 1:58:11.320]  case yes so but you know it's up it's up to us to resist that so anyways like I
[1:58:11.320 --> 1:58:16.080]  say I said no and then they said why and then I just wrote down I said I'm not
[1:58:16.080 --> 1:58:20.440]  gonna tell you why but when I wrote down on the on the paper I said I declined
[1:58:20.440 --> 1:58:27.720]  and I wrote down title seven 1964 I'd love to run this past Barnes and see what
[1:58:27.720 --> 1:58:36.160]  he has to say about it but title seven year 1964 is the Civil Rights Act right
[1:58:36.160 --> 1:58:42.800]  which is a huge umbrella of protection and so basically what it says is that
[1:58:42.800 --> 1:58:49.400]  I'm I'm declining this on religious grounds and they can't even ask me what
[1:58:49.400 --> 1:58:56.800]  my religion is see so anyhow they didn't like that very much and the only
[1:58:56.800 --> 1:59:02.120]  choice they had at that point was to lay me off which I was prepared to take the
[1:59:02.120 --> 1:59:05.240]  rest of the summer off take care of a family member anyways it worked out
[1:59:05.240 --> 1:59:10.920]  fine for me however I could have sued their butts off if I wanted to well and
[1:59:10.920 --> 1:59:14.520]  there's gonna have to be mass lawsuits to stop this unfortunately and nobody
[1:59:14.520 --> 1:59:18.400]  likes getting involved in litigation like that but but that's just gonna have
[1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:21.240]  to be the case but I mean think about how crazy it is not only do they not
[1:59:21.240 --> 1:59:25.920]  even value or respect the Constitution I mean there should be a common-sense
[1:59:25.920 --> 1:59:30.720]  approach to this when it's like hey specifically the US government has been
[1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:36.200]  caught testing on the population with vaccines before it's the Tuskegee
[1:59:36.200 --> 1:59:40.000]  experiment why would we be trusting the US government to now implement and
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:43.600]  force us to take this vaccine knowing their history why would we be forced to
[1:59:43.600 --> 1:59:47.440]  take a Pfizer vaccine knowing their history settling the biggest healthcare
[1:59:47.440 --> 1:59:52.040]  fraud payouts in history why would we be taking these vaccines were forced to
[1:59:52.040 --> 1:59:55.640]  take with us when they have a secret court it's paid out billions of dollars
[1:59:55.640 --> 2:00:00.960]  in vaccine damages see but no the the medical industry is in charge of you now
[2:00:00.960 --> 2:00:04.680]  they hate that Constitution that makes you be free and make up your own mind
[2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:07.920]  and your own decisions they hate that they should be in charge of you they
[2:00:07.920 --> 2:00:10.960]  should make your decisions for you that's what they want people to think
[2:00:10.960 --> 2:00:13.600]  that's why they're trying to get rid of the Constitution that's why Bill of
[2:00:13.600 --> 2:00:17.480]  Rights says Joe Biden says the Bill of Rights is not a document it can be
[2:00:17.480 --> 2:00:20.560]  changed it doesn't even exist you don't have any rights and now they're quoting
[2:00:20.560 --> 2:00:25.280]  China praising China praising Mao Zedong unbelievable thank you so much for
[2:00:25.280 --> 2:00:31.160]  the call all right we just did an hour of calls talking about people who are
[2:00:31.160 --> 2:00:38.160]  being forced to take the experimental jab to stay employed I'm not sure if we're

[2:02:23.400 --> 2:02:30.880]  ladies and gentlemen Dr. Stella Emanuel is with us she has been such a fearless
[2:02:30.880 --> 2:02:35.480]  leader a trailblazer at the beginning of this pandemic calling out the lies of
[2:02:35.480 --> 2:02:45.080]  the mainstream media calling out the intentional sabotage of known drugs and
[2:02:45.080 --> 2:02:50.240]  therapeutics that could stop people from dying from COVID she was attacked for
[2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:55.120]  that we had other doctors get attacked for that we saw corrupt governors ban the
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:03:00.320]  use of hydroxychloroquine that saved lives well that's where we were now
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:04.320]  we're at a new level of these vaccines coming out I'm interested to hear Dr.
[2:03:04.320 --> 2:03:08.480]  Stella Emanuel's take on that but but you know first as I as I bring the good
[2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:14.760]  doctor in here Dr. Emanuel just talk about in general the journey for
[2:03:14.760 --> 2:03:19.640]  yourself in the last year you probably never expected to be in a leadership role
[2:03:19.640 --> 2:03:24.040]  like you were in now but yet here you are one of the one of the few and proud
[2:03:24.040 --> 2:03:29.600]  and strong truth tellers about the COVID pandemic the the therapeutics that
[2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:32.920]  were that were told we couldn't use that could have saved lives and now of
[2:03:32.920 --> 2:03:35.680]  course the vaccine coming out so just talk about your journey the beginning of
[2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:40.880]  COVID what you were thinking what led you to that famous speech at the US
[2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:44.720]  Capitol on the steps how shocked when you were you when you found out that
[2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:47.720]  governments were banning the use of hydroxychloroquine something we knew
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:52.760]  worked just talk about your story for the last year or so Dr. Stella Emanuel
[2:03:52.760 --> 2:03:57.440]  thank you for joining us I'm really honored and excited to be here I mean I
[2:03:57.440 --> 2:04:02.480]  love I love Alex and I've always loved his show listen it's really been a I
[2:04:02.480 --> 2:04:06.720]  would say it's been a crazy year and it's just been something that I do believe
[2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:10.960]  that God actually prepared me for this you know I was in Houston running an
[2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:14.400]  urgent care clinic I'm actually a trained pediatrician I did general medicine
[2:04:14.400 --> 2:04:19.160]  back home came here and did pediatrics then started working in the merchants
[2:04:19.160 --> 2:04:22.880]  room so I kind of kept working in the merchants room and also on a pediatric
[2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:27.880]  clinic in Louisiana a few years ago I moved to Houston and opened up this
[2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:34.040]  urgent care clinic urgent care clinic and so this is where we were when COVID
[2:04:34.040 --> 2:04:39.080]  hit and it was really scary because about 15 to 20% of my patients is from
[2:04:39.080 --> 2:04:44.360]  Asia Middle East and stuff like that so we just initially just jumped into the
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:49.640]  PPE and we got all masked up and everything and it was just way scared you
[2:04:49.640 --> 2:04:54.320]  know and then a pharmacy friend of mine told me that that they're getting news
[2:04:54.320 --> 2:04:59.240]  out of Europe and out of China that hydroxychlorine works I trained in West
[2:04:59.240 --> 2:05:03.560]  Africa I trained in Nigeria I'm from Cameroon originally but I train in West
[2:05:03.560 --> 2:05:08.600]  Africa Nigeria so I'm used to using hydroxychlorine, camoqueen, meflopene, all
[2:05:08.600 --> 2:05:13.520]  the all the queens and these are really cheap therapeutics that are known to be
[2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:18.560]  effective and so that's why they were used so much in West Africa. Yes in fact
[2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:24.120]  we took it weekly for prevention of malaria and it's given to children to
[2:05:24.120 --> 2:05:28.160]  old people to pregnant women in fact they call it Sunday Sunday medicine back
[2:05:28.160 --> 2:05:32.800]  in Nigeria where I trained you know so I was very excited when I heard about it
[2:05:32.800 --> 2:05:36.080]  because I'm used to the medications I know they are safety effective so I
[2:05:36.080 --> 2:05:41.000]  immediately just started using it for patients and it was awesome I mean people
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:44.840]  were doing very well initially I just used the malaria dose because that's what
[2:05:44.840 --> 2:05:51.000]  I was used to and then we started getting information from Dr. Didi Rahul from France
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:55.680]  and Dr. Zelenko and all the other trailblazers so we modified it and I
[2:05:55.680 --> 2:05:59.600]  started using the doses that they were recommending and adding Zitromax and zinc
[2:05:59.600 --> 2:06:04.080]  tremendous results people were getting better if people got sick in like two
[2:06:04.080 --> 2:06:08.600]  days people got better like immediately some 24 hours some 48 hours if they have
[2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:13.320]  been sick a little longer it took them a little longer to get better so I was so
[2:06:13.320 --> 2:06:18.080]  excited so I went online on all the doctor groups that I was part of all
[2:06:18.080 --> 2:06:22.440]  these big doctor groups I have about 30,000 doctors I was like yes I'm using
[2:06:22.440 --> 2:06:26.680]  hydroxychloropoeia it's working this is awesome we have a treatment I got
[2:06:26.680 --> 2:06:33.440]  attacked these doctors attacked me they told me no we have to we need a double
[2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:37.760]  blinded randomized control study I said no we don't the medicine is working
[2:06:37.760 --> 2:06:43.720]  then I went and dug in and I found an article that was written under the INH
[2:06:43.720 --> 2:06:50.880]  actually under Anthony Fauci in 2005 that said chloropene was a potent
[2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:56.800]  inhibitor of SARS-CoV-1 SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 they are all coronavirus they
[2:06:56.800 --> 2:07:01.720]  are very similar so this was under Anthony Fauci so I was really shocked when I
[2:07:01.720 --> 2:07:05.320]  saw him online saying that it doesn't work and everything so it was it was just
[2:07:05.320 --> 2:07:09.800]  shocking to me so we started using it people were getting treated we were
[2:07:09.800 --> 2:07:14.760]  fighting online and that is how we got together all the doctors I met Dr. Osso
[2:07:14.760 --> 2:07:19.080]  Dr. Bryant I mean we just met just people that were taking care of patients and
[2:07:19.080 --> 2:07:24.080]  fighting online and on YouTube and no on Facebook and on Twitter we just took the
[2:07:24.080 --> 2:07:27.680]  fight online because the people around us you know want to hear it so we started
[2:07:27.680 --> 2:07:33.400]  finding people that had like mind so this is this is April March April and
[2:07:33.400 --> 2:07:36.960]  we're talking we're fighting we're bringing literature we're bringing
[2:07:36.960 --> 2:07:43.600]  literature as done in other places we're bringing testimonies from other doctors
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:46.480]  and I've seen patients were even bringing live testimony of patients I
[2:07:46.480 --> 2:07:50.040]  got better like remember there was a lawmaker asking in Michigan that got
[2:07:50.040 --> 2:07:53.720]  treated and got better so we're bringing all this thing and giving to these
[2:07:53.720 --> 2:07:57.720]  doctors and they were just like no it doesn't work we wanted randomized
[2:07:57.720 --> 2:08:00.920]  controlled studies doesn't work at some point I was like what are you guys
[2:08:00.920 --> 2:08:06.120]  computers randomized double-blinded double-blinded what's wrong with you so by
[2:08:06.120 --> 2:08:12.960]  like May I knew that it was not it was really not a science battle because what
[2:08:12.960 --> 2:08:18.640]  they were saying had no science to it it was not even it had nothing to do with I
[2:08:18.640 --> 2:08:21.760]  just thought that this had nothing to do with coronavirus because there was
[2:08:21.760 --> 2:08:25.480]  something going on that was more sinister at that time so I started
[2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:29.800]  realizing that it was there was a serious propaganda battle going on you
[2:08:29.800 --> 2:08:34.080]  know when getting a little bit of you know censorship on Facebook and Twitter
[2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:38.000]  but not that much yet well and you're at you're kind of asking you're answering
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:40.920]  the question I was gonna ask so let me just ask the question so that the
[2:08:40.920 --> 2:08:42.880]  audience can even have a better understanding of what you're saying
[2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:46.600]  here so so what were the thoughts going through your head and I know you're
[2:08:46.600 --> 2:08:49.640]  just kind of explaining it but I really want to encapsulate here what are the
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:53.200]  thoughts going through your head at this time when for all intensive purposes
[2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:58.360]  you found a cure for COVID for coronavirus which has already been used
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:03.400]  to treat malaria and other diseases and it's just known hydroxychloroquine to
[2:09:03.400 --> 2:09:08.000]  just preventing other other infections as well and so you find this cure you
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:11.440]  share it with doctors you get attacked you learn that Fauci is known about this
[2:09:11.440 --> 2:09:14.560]  but he's not promoting it so but again what's going through your head at this
[2:09:14.560 --> 2:09:19.720]  period of time it was mind-boggling not just for me for all of us at this time
[2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:24.280]  doctor Armstrong the state board had come after him for treating patients in
[2:09:24.280 --> 2:09:28.560]  the nursing home doctor also the state board had come after him so it was really
[2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:33.600]  mind-boggling we can't be like what is going on we're telling you this is
[2:09:33.600 --> 2:09:37.480]  working patients are getting better instead of everybody like okay good we
[2:09:37.480 --> 2:09:39.280]  need to see what you're doing and do it
[2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:43.960]  Zelenko was being attacked Dr. Rahul in France was being attacked so it was mind
[2:09:43.960 --> 2:09:48.320]  boggling for all of us so we decided that you know what this was just by May I
[2:09:48.320 --> 2:09:53.880]  decided this was not a science battle this was a propaganda battle and because
[2:09:53.880 --> 2:09:57.440]  of some of the things I'm also a pastor I'm a minister of the gospel because of
[2:09:57.440 --> 2:10:00.320]  the things some of the things I've got I've been showing me I realized it was a
[2:10:00.320 --> 2:10:06.120]  spiritual battle so by May I was done playing this nice guy when I go online
[2:10:06.120 --> 2:10:10.000]  and if somebody attacks me I went after them with everything I threw everything
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:13.800]  the kitchen sink at them so I said it like coming after them the same way that
[2:10:13.800 --> 2:10:18.640]  they were coming after me they were back us I was like no you can't do this oh no
[2:10:18.640 --> 2:10:25.960]  you're not showing that yes so I was I was just done I told you my colleagues I
[2:10:25.960 --> 2:10:30.560]  said you cannot keep coming to a street fight with a coach so by the time we got
[2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:38.200]  to DC I was done I was like I cannot keep I was done I was ready I was ready to
[2:10:38.200 --> 2:10:42.480]  be the attack dog the doctor is still trying to be nice miss doctor I was like
[2:10:42.480 --> 2:10:47.080]  no I'm not doing nice anymore but you notice that it was it was it was your
[2:10:47.080 --> 2:10:51.840]  speech that day that got the most attention and was the most viral
[2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:56.800]  powerful speech and video from that day was your speech yes the thing is this
[2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:00.480]  right we have also really been praying for the nation and praying for what's
[2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:04.720]  going on I'm a prayer warrior so we have been praying and I do believe that on
[2:11:04.720 --> 2:11:11.560]  that day it was God the whole world was caged in fear the whole world the
[2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:16.640]  globe was caged in this prison of fear and we're all gonna die and we're all
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:19.720]  gonna die it was just it was just fear you could it was part people there were
[2:11:19.720 --> 2:11:23.080]  people that have been locked up in their homes for three months I have not come
[2:11:23.080 --> 2:11:27.960]  out of your home so that day when I got there it was just God that just hit it
[2:11:27.960 --> 2:11:32.680]  and said you know what if I knew that God was gonna amplify my voice because it
[2:11:32.680 --> 2:11:37.040]  was just God that decide you know what let me break fear over the world so when
[2:11:37.040 --> 2:11:40.960]  I spoke that there's something broke in the spirit all of a sudden people are
[2:11:40.960 --> 2:11:44.440]  like oh my god we're not all gonna die there's hope it is possible there

[2:12:56.840 --> 2:13:02.680]  Russia with no evidence for the shutdown of the east coast gasoline pipeline that
[2:13:02.680 --> 2:13:06.480]  goes from Houston right up through New York City it supplies more than half of
[2:13:06.480 --> 2:13:10.320]  the gasoline at the east coast but who is it that actually shut down the main
[2:13:10.320 --> 2:13:15.360]  pipeline from Canada to the Midwest to Houston to refine the oil that's then
[2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:20.160]  turned into gas and simply use coast that's right Joe Biden shut down the
[2:13:20.160 --> 2:13:25.080]  keystone pipeline right after it was completed Joe Biden did that to America
[2:13:25.080 --> 2:13:29.080]  he has the history he has the background he's the one that promised a quote get us
[2:13:29.080 --> 2:13:33.760]  off of fossil fuels he's the one that's trying to extend the lockdowns of the
[2:13:33.760 --> 2:13:37.920]  country remember ladies and gentlemen but the new world order wants a post
[2:13:37.920 --> 2:13:42.120]  industrial world and they want the United States Europe and Australia crippled
[2:13:42.120 --> 2:13:46.480]  so communist China can't be dominant it's not Russia that's the enemy it's
[2:13:46.480 --> 2:13:50.600]  communist China and their millions like Joe Biden in control of the White House
[2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:54.480]  that's the facts that's the information
[2:13:54.480 --> 2:14:18.400]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:25.080]  we are hearing the incredible story of her COVID testimony really of dealing
[2:14:25.080 --> 2:14:31.360]  with it dr. Stella Emanuel what led to that epic speech on the nation's
[2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:36.680]  capital and and here's the analogy for for the story that she told the last
[2:14:36.680 --> 2:14:40.600]  segment imagine you're a doctor you go into some village somewhere where
[2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:44.560]  they're having a big outbreak of some disease and you come into the village
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:47.800]  and you have a treatment and it's working and all of these people that were
[2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:50.480]  dying all the sudden are getting healthy and they're up and walking and
[2:14:50.480 --> 2:14:52.960]  enjoying their lives again and you're feeling good about it you're saving
[2:14:52.960 --> 2:14:56.560]  lives you're helping people and then out of nowhere a bunch of guys show up in
[2:14:56.560 --> 2:15:01.960]  black suits steal all of the medication you're using and throw it into a van and
[2:15:01.960 --> 2:15:05.400]  drive away and you're like hey what's happening what are you doing this was
[2:15:05.400 --> 2:15:09.040]  working and then they come back and they take you and throw you in the same van
[2:15:09.040 --> 2:15:12.640]  that they just put all the ingredients for the medicines that you were using in
[2:15:12.640 --> 2:15:16.160]  that was helping people and then they drive away and the disease continues to
[2:15:16.160 --> 2:15:20.600]  spread in that village that's basically the analogy I would use but you know
[2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:24.880]  going back for just a moment here Dr. Stella Emanuel with us on the Alex
[2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:28.680]  Jones show and then and then we'll continue your testimony and get into
[2:15:28.680 --> 2:15:32.240]  where we're at now with the vaccines but I mean what did you think I found it
[2:15:32.240 --> 2:15:37.640]  amazing that you have these doctors that were demanding more studies more
[2:15:37.640 --> 2:15:41.160]  randomized studies about hydroxychloroquine something that's been used
[2:15:41.160 --> 2:15:45.800]  successfully for decades prescribed to presidents when they travel the world to
[2:15:45.800 --> 2:15:50.280]  Nigeria and other places for malaria as you were discussing but yet they
[2:15:50.280 --> 2:15:56.000]  don't have those same demands over this vaccine over the COVID vaccine that
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:59.720]  isn't even really by definition a vaccine has not been FDA approved has not
[2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:04.000]  been tested on humans I mean to me that how do you even react to that I mean how
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:08.720]  can doctors how can doctors be going along with this or saying oh no we need
[2:16:08.720 --> 2:16:11.280]  all these tests for hydroxychloroquine but then they don't have that same
[2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:17.440]  approach to the vaccine that that stuns me Dr. Emanuel. I think like I said this
[2:16:17.440 --> 2:16:22.240]  is a special battle well we I think as we discuss further I'm gonna some stuff
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:26.000]  that I just discovered recently to realize just how much they are
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:31.400]  programming people with the whole human 2.0 thing is crazy but you know at that
[2:16:31.400 --> 2:16:35.480]  time we're just trying to take care of patients we're just trying to take care
[2:16:35.480 --> 2:16:39.240]  of patients and it was really mind-boggling I'm talking with each
[2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:42.920]  other and I remember the first day I made Dr. Richard also we talked and we
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:46.800]  discussed he's in Houston we're like oh my god I felt like finally there was
[2:16:46.800 --> 2:16:51.400]  somebody around here I was not alone the next day he called me and he couldn't
[2:16:51.400 --> 2:16:54.840]  reach me I was in clinic and he thought something bad had happened to me that is
[2:16:54.840 --> 2:16:59.280]  the kind of terror we're living under at that time so when we again of course
[2:16:59.280 --> 2:17:05.640]  Simone put together this this conference in Washington DC and I was
[2:17:05.640 --> 2:17:10.800]  invited so when I got there I told the doctors I said you all play nice I'm
[2:17:10.800 --> 2:17:16.240]  done I am seriously done I am ready to just beat up whatever needs to be done
[2:17:16.240 --> 2:17:22.120]  today when I left home I told my family I said if I'm going to DC I don't care
[2:17:22.120 --> 2:17:25.960]  what happens to me I'm not gonna continue to let people die if I perish I
[2:17:25.960 --> 2:17:29.880]  perish they were like oh no don't say that I said you know if you don't live
[2:17:29.880 --> 2:17:33.360]  for if you if you are not willing to die for something then you're gonna fall for
[2:17:33.360 --> 2:17:36.720]  anything so I was like if I said I don't care if they kill me they kill me I'm
[2:17:36.720 --> 2:17:40.080]  just gonna have to take everything so that is where I was when I stood in
[2:17:40.080 --> 2:17:43.320]  front of the Supreme Court that day and I said you know what if this is the heel
[2:17:43.320 --> 2:17:47.280]  I get nailed on this is the heel I get nailed on Antony Fauci is lying
[2:17:47.280 --> 2:17:51.120]  Sanjay Gupta doesn't know what he's talking about and I just went off they
[2:17:51.120 --> 2:17:56.360]  should bring Antony Fauci's Uranus test it I was done and I was ready to like I
[2:17:56.360 --> 2:18:00.800]  don't care what any of you say and I'm glad because you know whenever you get to
[2:18:00.800 --> 2:18:05.640]  that place of if I perish I perish you never perish so that day it was it was
[2:18:05.640 --> 2:18:09.400]  wild I went back to my hotel room and people called me hey Stella guess what
[2:18:09.400 --> 2:18:14.160]  four million views I say what he said eight million views I say what he said
[2:18:14.160 --> 2:18:18.560]  oh my god listen don't you know just retreat and you I say what they said
[2:18:18.560 --> 2:18:23.680]  you press there which I say whoa and boom they started they started to fight
[2:18:23.680 --> 2:18:28.840]  they tried to they blocked me they banned me they cut me out they when I'm
[2:18:28.840 --> 2:18:34.960]  pulled up my ministry and they turned me into trumps demons from doctor and
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:38.760]  they just who they try to destroy me they did everything it's like they wanted
[2:18:38.760 --> 2:18:44.200]  to class like what you don't even know I'm a warrior but that's why what you
[2:18:44.200 --> 2:18:47.920]  said before is so important what once you've accepted your fate once you've
[2:18:47.920 --> 2:18:51.760]  accepted you know you that you're perished already none of these attacks
[2:18:51.760 --> 2:18:56.720]  phase you yeah I was I was like you don't even know me I'm a warrior so when
[2:18:56.720 --> 2:19:01.880]  CNN came after me and they were talking I say you know this CNN people I just one
[2:19:01.880 --> 2:19:06.240]  hour in the room with one of them and I was cast them demons out of them they'll
[2:19:06.240 --> 2:19:10.480]  be sitting on the floor like snakes I was like I was just I went off after them
[2:19:10.480 --> 2:19:14.200]  and then they kind of backed up but of course Twitter Facebook and everything
[2:19:14.200 --> 2:19:18.880]  started all doing all kinds of any time we said anything they will ban it any
[2:19:18.880 --> 2:19:23.000]  time when I'm coming on a show they're banning you know there's a very
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:26.680]  interesting story there was a story about let me just say this because I'm
[2:19:26.680 --> 2:19:30.600]  in you know Alex has been through this a lot there's a story about a farmer I
[2:19:30.600 --> 2:19:35.720]  don't know what I guess the farmer that bought a rat trap so the a mouse trap so
[2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:39.760]  the mouse came and he's telling the chickens and the pigs and the cows that
[2:19:39.760 --> 2:19:42.880]  oh my god the farmer bought a mouse trap they say oh no no no no no don't worry
[2:19:42.880 --> 2:19:46.760]  about it it's not our problem of course the first day they put the trap it
[2:19:46.760 --> 2:19:50.920]  caught a snake when the farmer's work went to touch the snake the snake beat the
[2:19:50.920 --> 2:19:54.200]  farmer's wife as the snake beat the farmer's wife the doctor came and said
[2:19:54.200 --> 2:19:58.520]  they need a chicken soup so they killed the chicken to make the soup and people
[2:19:58.520 --> 2:20:02.320]  start coming to visit them they killed the pig to entertain the people the
[2:20:02.320 --> 2:20:06.320]  farmer's wife died and then they killed the cow for the whole village that came
[2:20:06.320 --> 2:20:12.000]  to eat the mouse was still alive that's like that's what happens to Alex Jones
[2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:17.920]  when they block Alex everybody was like oh he bad he bad but now all the cows the
[2:20:17.920 --> 2:20:21.520]  chickens the goats everything is being killed that is where we are right now
[2:20:21.520 --> 2:20:25.680]  and it's just sad yeah that's incredible that is a that is a great story of
[2:20:25.680 --> 2:20:29.120]  parable if you will that you said because yeah like all the other animals
[2:20:29.120 --> 2:20:32.920]  that's all the trap laid for Alex Jones for the censorship they said oh we're
[2:20:32.920 --> 2:20:36.920]  not Alex Jones we don't care oh we're not the mouse we don't care well now you
[2:20:36.920 --> 2:20:39.400]  know we're still here we're still getting the big interviews we still have
[2:20:39.400 --> 2:20:44.920]  our own platform yes and just an example you know Stephen Crowder he's
[2:20:44.920 --> 2:20:49.320]  having to sue YouTube now he's moved all of his content to rumble so you know
[2:20:49.320 --> 2:20:52.320]  and he's been supportive of us as well but I mean it's just this is what's
[2:20:52.320 --> 2:20:55.800]  happening either we all stand together against censorship or we all end up
[2:20:55.800 --> 2:21:00.560]  getting censored actually this thing is serious I think it's way deeper than
[2:21:00.560 --> 2:21:07.120]  censorship is way deeper than even how she is way deeper than even gates you
[2:21:07.120 --> 2:21:12.680]  know we know I mean we know what they want to do to us so deep I have been
[2:21:12.680 --> 2:21:17.240]  praying and you know from like almost maybe 2011 the loss of the showing me
[2:21:17.240 --> 2:21:21.440]  that they had genetically modified people in the land and when I said if
[2:21:21.440 --> 2:21:24.320]  people thought I was crazy they thought well they thought I had gone down a
[2:21:24.320 --> 2:21:29.440]  rabbit hole or something but this is what was seen so recently I started you
[2:21:29.440 --> 2:21:32.480]  know sometimes when you've prayed and prayed and pray God will just open this
[2:21:32.480 --> 2:21:36.720]  place and you will see the secret behind what they are doing we found these
[2:21:36.720 --> 2:21:39.640]  videos it's on my rumble channel real dr. Stella I went and found all these
[2:21:39.640 --> 2:21:45.720]  videos that these people they want to human 2.0 they are really serious I mean
[2:21:45.720 --> 2:21:52.160]  the vaccine this vaccine the COVID vaccine was actually manufactured or
[2:21:52.160 --> 2:21:57.120]  created or whatever would actually would dapper when you see the sea of
[2:21:57.120 --> 2:22:02.640]  Moderna ties up saying that they are hacking human software it was actually
[2:22:02.640 --> 2:22:06.640]  done between dapper and it was paid for by Bada the biomedical research
[2:22:06.640 --> 2:22:10.360]  institute these are governmental agencies do you know something and if you go
[2:22:10.360 --> 2:22:13.480]  on our rumble channel you will see there's a certain doctor there that used to
[2:22:13.480 --> 2:22:17.920]  dr. Cruz I used to work for dapper that is now working for the platypus
[2:22:17.920 --> 2:22:23.720]  Institute and the whole thing is about upgrading human brain upgrading human

[2:26:18.080 --> 2:26:21.280]  ago we tracked and documented the Boulderburg Groups activities and their
[2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:25.480]  plan for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus the film now is more
[2:26:25.480 --> 2:26:28.440]  important than ever when it's shot to number one on Amazon last year they
[2:26:28.440 --> 2:26:32.760]  banned it we have it back in print available now at infowarstore.com

[2:26:51.400 --> 2:27:00.120]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:27:00.120 --> 2:27:23.920]  ladies and gentlemen we are back here on the Alex Jones show our guest Dr.
[2:27:23.920 --> 2:27:28.120]  Stella Emmanuel with us in the last segment she was talking about the
[2:27:28.120 --> 2:27:34.360]  rabbit hole of human 2.0 GMO genetically modified humans and you know
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:39.120]  there is a going down the rabbit hole aspect of this which is the hidden
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:44.840]  history of humans the ancient hieroglyphs the megaliths there's
[2:27:44.840 --> 2:27:47.880]  obviously a part of human history that we don't understand yet or that we're
[2:27:47.880 --> 2:27:52.120]  being lied to about it but for me it's not even necessarily having that
[2:27:52.120 --> 2:27:57.560]  background of going down the rabbit hole to me it's if you're living in this
[2:27:57.560 --> 2:28:01.320]  moment and you're being intellectually honest with yourself and observant you
[2:28:01.320 --> 2:28:07.880]  have to realize wow if they're forcing us if they're forcing humans to take this
[2:28:07.880 --> 2:28:14.320]  experimental gene modifying DNA modifying what they're calling a vaccine
[2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:20.080]  has it been tested on humans has it been FDA approved they've sold hundreds
[2:28:20.080 --> 2:28:24.240]  of millions of these they want billions of these administered throughout the
[2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:28.840]  planet and we don't know what the sort term or long-term side effects are and
[2:28:28.840 --> 2:28:32.040]  so you just you see you have to sit there and be intellectually honest with
[2:28:32.040 --> 2:28:36.440]  yourself and ask is this the first time this has been done to humans how many
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:41.480]  times have humans been experienced experience human experiments throughout
[2:28:41.480 --> 2:28:46.640]  human history by the world elite like what we're seeing now and so so I guess
[2:28:46.640 --> 2:28:53.480]  by lead into this would be what do you think or how does this apply to when you
[2:28:53.480 --> 2:28:58.320]  see the videos and the images of people that have been vaccinated they're
[2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:02.680]  magnetic on their arm I don't know if you've seen this yet dr. manual maybe
[2:29:02.680 --> 2:29:06.440]  you haven't we can show you some of the videos but so I mean talk about what you
[2:29:06.440 --> 2:29:10.520]  what you mean when you talk about human 2.0 genetically modified humans and that
[2:29:10.520 --> 2:29:15.320]  rabbit hole okay listen it's not even a rabbit hole let me just say that I did
[2:29:15.320 --> 2:29:19.320]  have video recently and it's called the whole of the COVID pandemic the whole
[2:29:19.320 --> 2:29:23.280]  the whole truth everything behind it is on my rumbo channel and if everybody can
[2:29:23.280 --> 2:29:28.160]  go watch it because I actually okay this these people actually work for DARPA
[2:29:28.160 --> 2:29:32.960]  and they are scientists we had a talk by dr. Charles Morgan talking about how
[2:29:32.960 --> 2:29:37.160]  they want to actually be able to change people's memory while people they sleep
[2:29:37.160 --> 2:29:41.240]  they change their memory dr. Amy Cruz talking about how they actually want
[2:29:41.240 --> 2:29:47.560]  human 2.0 and just and this guy from Modena saying they are hacking human
[2:29:47.560 --> 2:29:51.520]  software I have all these videos on my rumbo channel I did a whole video
[2:29:51.520 --> 2:29:56.600]  exposing the whole pandemic and what is behind it because you see dr. Charles
[2:29:56.600 --> 2:30:00.080]  Morgan was saying that there is technology right now where you can
[2:30:00.080 --> 2:30:05.200]  influence people's mind tell them what to say what they think but that
[2:30:05.200 --> 2:30:08.920]  technology you needed to be able to actually put a cap on somebody said yes
[2:30:08.920 --> 2:30:13.120]  that is it COVID-19 the full picture the grade reset human 2.0 the mark of the
[2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:18.440]  beast I mean these people are actually sitting down bringing all this demonic
[2:30:18.440 --> 2:30:22.640]  diabolic stuff and making it sound like science so it's no longer a rabbit hole
[2:30:22.640 --> 2:30:26.760]  it's no longer what they it's no longer what they call a conspiracy theory it's
[2:30:26.760 --> 2:30:32.440]  actually what they are saying so if you take that backdrop and Charles Morgan
[2:30:32.440 --> 2:30:37.120]  saying that that they cannot actually put electrodes in the heads of people like
[2:30:37.120 --> 2:30:42.560]  you'll put electrodes in the heads of rats but they can program a cell to go to
[2:30:42.560 --> 2:30:47.520]  your brain to go to your to your to your hippocampus so they can so I do believe
[2:30:47.520 --> 2:30:53.800]  that this vaccine especially since they coated this vaccine in a lipid when you
[2:30:53.800 --> 2:30:57.680]  caught something in lipid you wanted to cross the blood-brain barrier which is
[2:30:57.680 --> 2:31:00.080]  probably the reason why a lot of people are taking this vaccine are getting
[2:31:00.080 --> 2:31:05.240]  neurological symptoms this whole thing is the delivery system that they want to
[2:31:05.240 --> 2:31:09.320]  go into your brain so when they are good and ready they can control all of you
[2:31:09.320 --> 2:31:12.560]  let me just let me just pause right there to put a little anecdote in here
[2:31:12.560 --> 2:31:17.680]  because this is so key this is the case with all vaccines and the reason why and
[2:31:17.680 --> 2:31:24.320]  we have this data the reason why with babies specifically boys that get
[2:31:24.320 --> 2:31:29.480]  vaccinated compared to girls the reason why you see more autism or vaccine
[2:31:29.480 --> 2:31:33.080]  side effects and boys is because their blood-brain barrier is nowhere near as
[2:31:33.080 --> 2:31:36.880]  thick as girls and so that's why you see autism and all the side effects from
[2:31:36.880 --> 2:31:41.320]  vaccines and more boys getting autism than girls it's not even close because
[2:31:41.320 --> 2:31:45.520]  the blood-brain barrier is thinner so that vaccine can penetrate and get in and
[2:31:45.520 --> 2:31:49.120]  do the brain damage neurological damage to boys easier than it can girls but
[2:31:49.120 --> 2:31:51.960]  now it looks like they're going after the girls reproductive system when this
[2:31:51.960 --> 2:31:57.880]  new one but I digress yes so it's good so this is what this this whole thing
[2:31:57.880 --> 2:32:01.560]  copied was limited some copied always had a treatment copied is completely
[2:32:01.560 --> 2:32:05.520]  treatable copied is completely preventable in fact let me digress a
[2:32:05.520 --> 2:32:08.760]  little bit and say this hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin works and
[2:32:08.760 --> 2:32:14.480]  everybody listening to me while we resist while we're standing and fighting
[2:32:14.480 --> 2:32:19.800]  please get prevention get hydroxychloroquine get ivermectin take it
[2:32:19.800 --> 2:32:24.400]  weekly Sunday Sunday medicine because people go on all these tours and they
[2:32:24.400 --> 2:32:28.120]  go on all these protests and then they come back and they get sick and then they
[2:32:28.120 --> 2:32:32.120]  can't breathe this is an invisible enemy I do believe that this thing was
[2:32:32.120 --> 2:32:36.920]  tick was I mean recently the Congress they are actually going up to the Senate
[2:32:36.920 --> 2:32:42.040]  going up to Anthony Fauci for gain of function studies on this virus how come
[2:32:42.040 --> 2:32:46.520]  nobody's upset with China because actually it's our military that took this
[2:32:46.520 --> 2:32:51.040]  thing to China to that lab to give it gain of function so that they can
[2:32:51.040 --> 2:32:55.920]  release it all over the world scare people to death and then allow people to
[2:32:55.920 --> 2:33:00.920]  die and then they can have a chance for the great reset think about it the great
[2:33:00.920 --> 2:33:04.560]  reset they said we will own nothing and we'll be happy what's gonna happen
[2:33:04.560 --> 2:33:08.240]  somebody's gonna programming in my head that I'm happy to do I own nothing well
[2:33:08.240 --> 2:33:13.160]  and just imagine the madness of this to dr. Emanuel where it was it was under
[2:33:13.160 --> 2:33:17.560]  the Obama administration they worked they the controversial research and to
[2:33:17.560 --> 2:33:21.320]  gain a function was too controversial so it had to be shut down in the North
[2:33:21.320 --> 2:33:24.920]  Carolina lab and so they just said oh well we'll just move it to China I mean
[2:33:24.920 --> 2:33:30.200]  imagine let's say you had the Manhattan experiment building nuclear weapons
[2:33:30.200 --> 2:33:34.280]  or atom bombs and they say oh this is this is not good we don't want to build
[2:33:34.280 --> 2:33:39.040]  atom bombs and they said okay let's give that research to China what that's what
[2:33:39.040 --> 2:33:44.200]  they did with COVID yes yes yes and that is why you don't see anybody really
[2:33:44.200 --> 2:33:47.520]  upset with China because they can't they can't be upset with China because they
[2:33:47.520 --> 2:33:51.680]  know that they took that technology to China and China has that leverage over
[2:33:51.680 --> 2:33:57.360]  us to say actually this came from you yes China study that the military brought
[2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:02.720]  it over there you know so now imagine DARPA that is making our vaccines is the
[2:34:02.720 --> 2:34:07.000]  same DARPA where all these professors that are working that are talking about
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:11.760]  this human 2.0 and talking about changing our mind talking about you know I
[2:34:11.760 --> 2:34:15.800]  mean professor Cruz worked in DARPA for five years he was a program developer
[2:34:15.800 --> 2:34:18.560]  then when she went from a program developer right now she's at the
[2:34:18.560 --> 2:34:24.080]  Platypus Institute everybody go and Google the Platypus Institute listen to
[2:34:24.080 --> 2:34:30.680]  the owner listen to the founder sounds like a computer like a 2.0 and the way
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:35.200]  he said he came about it actually came about it he went from rabbit holes this
[2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:40.040]  is the thing that I'm trying to get our culture human human beings all this stuff
[2:34:40.040 --> 2:34:43.280]  that they are making it sound like science it's actually just demonic
[2:34:43.280 --> 2:34:46.600]  technology it's just the devil it's just that they are making it sound as if it's
[2:34:46.600 --> 2:34:50.400]  science and like I talked about all these human beings like bugates them or
[2:34:50.400 --> 2:34:53.960]  faulty them that are gonna go network with the devil thinking that he's gonna
[2:34:53.960 --> 2:34:57.640]  give them eternal life the devil can't give them something he doesn't have they
[2:34:57.640 --> 2:35:02.080]  are just useful idiots all of them bugates all these globalists if you're
[2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:05.440]  human and you're going to think that they're gonna make you wireless the
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:10.560]  internet of things and you're gonna live forever you're just a useful idiot the
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:14.400]  devil cannot give you life it doesn't have it it's gonna take you within to
[2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:19.440]  the lake of fire this battle is already won everybody read revelation the
[2:35:19.440 --> 2:35:23.360]  battle is won already so no matter what they are saying we know the end of the
[2:35:23.360 --> 2:35:27.720]  battle already so they can try all the one the devil tried this in the days of
[2:35:27.720 --> 2:35:32.080]  Nimrod trying to bring everybody together to have one mind and decide that
[2:35:32.080 --> 2:35:35.440]  all they're gonna reach heaven by themselves at the end of the day in the
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:39.160]  days of New York God came and destroyed it and this time around God is gonna come
[2:35:39.160 --> 2:35:44.400]  down and step up all of this the end of the story is already written you have
[2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:48.200]  something so it's just really stupid you know all these bugates them and all
[2:35:48.200 --> 2:35:53.200]  these globalists they're just useful idiots how can you allow the enemy of
[2:35:53.200 --> 2:35:57.840]  your soul to deceive you know I hear that there are people that have died while
[2:35:57.840 --> 2:36:01.600]  they were dying they said in bomb my body so that when this technology comes out
[2:36:01.600 --> 2:36:06.280]  we're gonna race you again not gonna race you you're gonna be dead DE AD dead
[2:36:06.280 --> 2:36:10.320]  I'm very your body's gonna be here they might race you but you'll be a demon
[2:36:10.320 --> 2:36:14.080]  that's gonna be operating in your body you'll be gone they even have what I
[2:36:14.080 --> 2:36:16.920]  don't know what I you know they even have an institute that actually clones
[2:36:16.920 --> 2:36:21.640]  people doing something this is a great time to take a break we got to take a
[2:36:21.640 --> 2:36:27.360]  break but absolutely and and to just give a little more framework to this we
[2:36:27.360 --> 2:36:33.880]  know that Jeffrey Epstein was running a clone facility in New Mexico now we're
[2:36:33.880 --> 2:36:36.960]  learning more about the relationship between Bill Gates and Epstein looks
[2:36:36.960 --> 2:36:40.160]  like they were really tight Bill Gates was hoping Jeffrey Epstein would help
[2:36:40.160 --> 2:36:44.040]  him win a Nobel Peace Prize is that because he was helping Epstein with the
[2:36:44.040 --> 2:36:48.040]  cloning research in New Mexico did they think they were about to come out with a
[2:36:48.040 --> 2:36:52.960]  Nobel Peace Prize winning technology we'll be right back one of the most
[2:36:52.960 --> 2:36:58.280]  common questions I get on air but also off air when I'm just out about is Alex
[2:36:58.280 --> 2:37:03.840]  what do I say to my family about the vaccines how do I warn them well the
[2:37:03.840 --> 2:37:07.480]  problem is there's so many problems with it so many facets the history of
[2:37:07.480 --> 2:37:11.280]  contaminated vaccines the fact that they have liability protection in the US and
[2:37:11.280 --> 2:37:15.840]  Europe the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses
[2:37:15.840 --> 2:37:19.480]  and other things the vaccines and the whole history of secret experimentation
[2:37:19.480 --> 2:37:24.000]  on at-risk groups of poor blacks poor whites Native Americans the list goes
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:28.400]  on and on but what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress and so did
[2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:36.200]  the head of the CDC in late May of 2021 that around half of the NIH CDC staff
[2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:39.880]  medical doctors virologist scientists have refused to take the vaccine until
[2:37:39.880 --> 2:37:44.320]  they could say yeah I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it that's
[2:37:44.320 --> 2:37:47.120]  the same thing in the private practices out there somewhere numbers that that's
[2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:50.760]  not something I'm gonna be taking that's very very simple there's your answer
[2:37:50.760 --> 2:37:55.120]  when listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done I always stop
[2:37:55.120 --> 2:37:59.640]  them I say thank you for what you've done thank you for keeping info wars on

[2:40:54.200 --> 2:41:13.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show this has been an incredible interview
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:16.880]  with dr. Stella Emmanuel remember this entire thing is going to be posted at
[2:41:16.880 --> 2:41:22.840]  banned video and this dot TV and it's free to air folks you can download it
[2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:26.760]  right there at the source you can edit it free upload it cut it up however you
[2:41:26.760 --> 2:41:30.120]  want share it with friends and family the entire interview going to be at
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:35.320]  banned dot video and remember to check out dr. Stella Emmanuel's rumble channel
[2:41:35.320 --> 2:41:41.520]  as well and so we're in the final segment here and I want to wrap it up but
[2:41:41.520 --> 2:41:45.560]  you know it's incredible listening to you and having some of the dots connected
[2:41:45.560 --> 2:41:50.560]  in my head to I think this is a story that is ahead of its time but we'll break
[2:41:50.560 --> 2:41:53.480]  it right now like we always do and I think people will probably catch on to
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:58.480]  this maybe in a month or a year but basically what what has happened here
[2:41:58.480 --> 2:42:04.880]  either winningly or unwittingly is that Anthony Fauci and Barack Obama moved a
[2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:11.240]  bio weapon and gave it to China which has ultimately been used against us so
[2:42:11.240 --> 2:42:18.280]  I mean folks imagine if they sold the Manhattan Project research to Japan and
[2:42:18.280 --> 2:42:22.080]  then Japan nuked us I mean that's basically the equivalent of what they've
[2:42:22.080 --> 2:42:25.920]  done and and this is this story is probably a little ahead of its time
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:29.160]  right now but I have a feeling this is going to be caught on eventually but
[2:42:29.160 --> 2:42:33.400]  but my question for dr. Stella Emmanuel now as we're in the final segment with
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:38.840]  her I'm not sure if you're aware we showed some of the videos there but what
[2:42:38.840 --> 2:42:44.080]  do you make of let's get into the vaccine now what do you make of the fact
[2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:47.840]  it's being forced the fact that people get the vaccine still don't feel safe
[2:42:47.840 --> 2:42:52.080]  the fact the media is saying safe and effective even though they're admitting
[2:42:52.080 --> 2:42:55.320]  it's not effective because they still have to wear the mask they still are in
[2:42:55.320 --> 2:42:58.400]  fear and they guess I guess they're admitting it's not safe because we know
[2:42:58.400 --> 2:43:03.160]  about all the side effects that the the the are being reported even in the
[2:43:03.160 --> 2:43:07.760]  mainstream media now but what about this crazy phenomenon of people who have
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:13.280]  been vaccinated having their arm magnetized you've seen this now what
[2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:17.840]  are your thoughts on that I actually believe that it's actually part of the
[2:43:17.840 --> 2:43:22.360]  technology that we put in people you see one of the things I've been talking to
[2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:26.760]  doctors and all of us that are fighting this battle this is virtual battle and a
[2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:30.040]  lot of people are just fighting it in its physical a lot of these globalist
[2:43:30.040 --> 2:43:34.280]  delusifarians all they want to this control human beings everybody has their
[2:43:34.280 --> 2:43:37.960]  own agenda people like view gates want to kill a whole bunch of people but at the
[2:43:37.960 --> 2:43:43.040]  end of the the thing it is actually the devil that wants to corrupt humanity like
[2:43:43.040 --> 2:43:48.480]  they did in the days of Genesis so if they want seven billion people vaccinated
[2:43:48.480 --> 2:43:51.480]  because to me it doesn't make sense why they are vaccinating children when they
[2:43:51.480 --> 2:43:55.880]  don't get COVID so it doesn't matter what is going on the propaganda everything
[2:43:55.880 --> 2:43:59.880]  that is going on they want seven billion people vaccinated this whole COVID did
[2:43:59.880 --> 2:44:03.600]  not have to happen COVID was made for the vaccine COVID was made so that we
[2:44:03.600 --> 2:44:07.680]  can bring the vaccine put this nanotechnology in our brain so that
[2:44:07.680 --> 2:44:11.440]  they can be able to connect every one of us to the Internet of Things watch
[2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:16.400]  Dr. Cruz's video watch Charles Morgan's video everything will come together so
[2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:20.480]  yes there's some technology in there but this is a thing it is not human
[2:44:20.480 --> 2:44:24.120]  technology it's Luciferian technology have you heard about CRISPR where they
[2:44:24.120 --> 2:44:28.680]  can splice genes this thing happened in 2008 all these technologies so fast they
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:33.760]  can cut your gene splice it attachment they can edit a child in this womb they
[2:44:33.760 --> 2:44:39.160]  can edit people you know something this stuff is demonic the devil wants us to
[2:44:39.160 --> 2:44:42.600]  be human 2.0 so that we're not going to be human anymore if you read in
[2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:46.280]  Revelation when they talk about the mark of the beast when you're not human
[2:44:46.280 --> 2:44:50.920]  anymore you cannot be saved so that is what this whole thing is about Lucifer
[2:44:50.920 --> 2:44:54.600]  and the bottom line of it is Lucifer even the human being that are working with
[2:44:54.600 --> 2:45:00.200]  him they are stupid but here is the thing if they get everybody that's then
[2:45:00.200 --> 2:45:04.040]  they have this technology in all of our heads they can control us on the
[2:45:04.040 --> 2:45:07.120]  computer when you watch Charles Morgan we will tell you how it's like a
[2:45:07.120 --> 2:45:12.200]  possession experiment they I'm telling you this whole this whole pandemic was
[2:45:12.200 --> 2:45:17.480]  just a fake it was all about getting everybody vaccinated people like well
[2:45:17.480 --> 2:45:21.320]  can they use it with the flu people don't take the flu shot adults don't take
[2:45:21.320 --> 2:45:24.760]  vaccines they have to bring a pandemic scare everybody then get everybody
[2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:29.200]  vaccinated so this is the issue if you've been vaccinated in fact the
[2:45:29.200 --> 2:45:34.840]  Moderna vaccine was made with a lipid probe the lipid nanoparticle use in the
[2:45:34.840 --> 2:45:39.440]  Moderna vaccine is Luciferous if you go and follow it up they actually if they
[2:45:39.440 --> 2:45:43.800]  put you take the lipid nanoparticle I think they take it and just google if
[2:45:43.800 --> 2:45:49.400]  you find out the lipid nanoparticle is Luciferous Luciferous is Lucifer the bearer
[2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:53.360]  of light so at the end of the day it's all about corrupting humanity changing
[2:45:53.360 --> 2:45:57.760]  us to cyborgs or centaurs if you listen to Dr. Cruz everybody needs to become a
[2:45:57.760 --> 2:46:02.000]  centaur everybody needs to then to upgrade our brains who told them that I
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:05.600]  want my brain upgraded I'm a human being I'm sure you guys have computer but keep
[2:46:05.600 --> 2:46:10.040]  your computers I want to be a human being so this is what is going on that is a
[2:46:10.040 --> 2:46:14.440]  whole thing about this vaccine and this globalist they're actually thinking that
[2:46:14.440 --> 2:46:19.320]  they're gonna be upgraded their minds are gonna stay in the in the internet of
[2:46:19.320 --> 2:46:23.640]  things and they will live forever they want us to connect all our minds so you
[2:46:23.640 --> 2:46:27.920]  have to listen to these videos listen to these people to really understand the
[2:46:27.920 --> 2:46:32.520]  big picture of it but here is what I want to say for everybody that has taken
[2:46:32.520 --> 2:46:37.120]  this vaccine some of people your life might be in danger I will expect every
[2:46:37.120 --> 2:46:40.640]  one of if you've taken a vaccine get on hydroxychloroquine it is anti-inflammatory
[2:46:40.640 --> 2:46:44.360]  get on ivermectin because we've had people take the vaccine they get sick
[2:46:44.360 --> 2:46:48.200]  they come back to us we treat them and they still get well hydroxychloroquine
[2:46:48.200 --> 2:46:52.840]  and ivermectin works in all the different strains it works so if you go to
[2:46:52.840 --> 2:46:57.440]  dr.sevamd.com you can get prophylaxis for hydroxychloroquine you can get prophylaxis
[2:46:57.440 --> 2:47:02.240]  ivermectin if you've taken the vaccine get on prophylaxis keep your vitamin D up
[2:47:02.240 --> 2:47:07.680]  but this is what God has been showing me in the book of in the book of Psalms
[2:47:07.680 --> 2:47:13.040]  chapter 18 verse 40 to 43 it says strangers would submit and they'll be
[2:47:13.040 --> 2:47:18.080]  afraid out of their clothes places as long as this is a Luciferian technology
[2:47:18.080 --> 2:47:22.840]  it's a demonic spirit it can be cast out the same way any other demon is cast
[2:47:22.840 --> 2:47:27.400]  it out and guess what were demon busters we prayed for a lady that to be vaccine
[2:47:27.400 --> 2:47:31.760]  the place started vibrating it was vibrating as we continue to pray she
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:36.800]  saw an L shape chip leave her body so if you've been vaccinated all is not lost
[2:47:36.800 --> 2:47:42.200]  number one repent ask God to forgive you ask for the blood of Jesus to redeem
[2:47:42.200 --> 2:47:46.880]  you just the same way that he redeemed us from the Adamic nature ask for the
[2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:51.160]  blood to redeem you and then pray and command those strangers to come out of
[2:47:51.160 --> 2:47:54.920]  your body we do prayer every day will be we do prayer every day and we're about
[2:47:54.920 --> 2:47:59.160]  to open the ranch where it's gonna be a place of prayer if you need deliverance

[2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:14.120]  devil is a liar he cannot succeed he will not succeed so because it's
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:18.680]  demonic because it's Luciferian the blood of Jesus the name of Jesus will cast it
[2:48:18.680 --> 2:48:23.720]  out do you understand saying so there is hope just repent as for deliverance as
[2:48:23.720 --> 2:48:28.440]  for God to do it and Christians pastors pray for people cast this thing out of
[2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:32.400]  their bodies they have not put this is not the mark yet they just want to
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:36.640]  program your mind so that if they say if in the days of the mark they will just
[2:48:36.640 --> 2:48:40.400]  program into your head that the devil is God and you believe it but it will not
[2:48:40.400 --> 2:48:45.320]  happen we already know the end of the story Jesus wins and I would like to

[2:51:39.240 --> 2:51:44.480]  this great doctor warning the world I'm not gonna say this five times in a row
[2:51:44.480 --> 2:51:47.880]  to be a noxious I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these
[2:51:47.880 --> 2:51:54.840]  criminals last week the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the
[2:51:54.840 --> 2:52:00.280]  CDC's top brass and workers medical doctors scientists nurses you name it
[2:52:00.280 --> 2:52:04.640]  have taken the so-called COVID-19 Franken shot I must say the second time
[2:52:04.640 --> 2:52:12.360]  around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the Franken
[2:52:12.360 --> 2:52:17.440]  shots they don't trust it you shouldn't trust it the vaccines have been banned in
[2:52:17.440 --> 2:52:21.240]  most countries around the world this is an attack on the American people the
[2:52:21.240 --> 2:52:26.680]  people the world this is an absolute red flag smoking gun again let me say it
[2:52:26.680 --> 2:52:31.320]  two more times around half the individuals that work at the NIH and
[2:52:31.320 --> 2:52:35.160]  CDC the medical staff refused to take the vaccines that's right the doctors
[2:52:35.160 --> 2:52:39.400]  nurses and scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine and you you shouldn't
[2:52:39.400 --> 2:52:44.680]  either you should warn everyone you know about the truth your brain your heart
[2:52:44.680 --> 2:52:52.240]  your bones your liver your eyes everything has a better shot at surviving
[2:52:52.240 --> 2:52:55.160]  in this crazy environment when you have high-quality fish oil we've got the best
[2:52:55.160 --> 2:52:59.400]  out there we have the highest grade of fish oil available and what it does for
[2:52:59.400 --> 2:53:02.600]  your body is simply amazing everybody already knows what high-quality fish
[2:53:02.600 --> 2:53:06.120]  oil does and it costs us even more to put it through a process to remove any

[2:57:10.400 --> 2:57:14.840]  deal folks and he had an event today guys will you see if there's any updates on
[2:57:14.840 --> 2:57:19.240]  his event today at Liberty Plaza in Atlanta Vernon Jones schedules press
[2:57:19.240 --> 2:57:23.120]  conference for today that this is a story was from yesterday last night for
[2:57:23.120 --> 2:57:27.080]  today in Atlanta to call for a full forensic audit of Georgia's 2020 election
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:34.960]  results bingo yeah see yeah let's get the audits going let's continue because
[2:57:34.960 --> 2:57:41.240]  what we're finding is mass voter fraud but more so mass criminal cover-up of
[2:57:41.240 --> 2:57:47.560]  these investigations of these audits by the Democrats for example information
[2:57:47.560 --> 2:57:51.560]  deleted from Maricopa County election machine has been recovered member they
[2:57:51.560 --> 2:57:54.840]  tried to delete that data so that the audit couldn't find the how the election
[2:57:54.840 --> 2:57:58.120]  was stolen in Maricopa County oops looks like they found the data
[2:57:58.120 --> 2:58:05.160]  oh fake president Joe Biden driving around or faking like he's pretending to
[2:58:05.160 --> 2:58:08.240]  drive around in an electric car that someone else was driving for him not
[2:58:08.240 --> 2:58:13.560]  even kidding how big of a joke this all is now but he's wearing aviator sunglasses
[2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:18.160]  and and groping babies so he's cool and then this is this I'm telling you man
[2:58:18.160 --> 2:58:23.600]  this Bill Gates Epstein thing this has the potential to blow a lot of things
[2:58:23.600 --> 2:58:27.840]  wide open Bill Gates reportedly hoped Jeffrey Epstein would help him win a
[2:58:27.840 --> 2:58:32.160]  Nobel Peace Prize is that for the work that Gates was doing with Epstein in
[2:58:32.160 --> 2:58:36.920]  New Mexico cloning people I mean it's funny how we just ignore that story isn't
[2:58:36.920 --> 2:58:44.520]  certainly is all right I sign off Darren McBreen Larry Pinkney Alex Jones take
[2:58:44.520 --> 2:58:49.200]  us the rest of the way I'll be back hosting the war room in an hour
[2:58:51.200 --> 2:58:57.000]  warning warning warning the globalists have launched a massive counter offensive
[2:58:57.000 --> 2:59:01.120]  against populist forces worldwide they are censoring they are attacking they
[2:59:01.120 --> 2:59:06.040]  are arresting patriots all over the world churches in Europe Australia the UK and
[2:59:06.040 --> 2:59:10.680]  Canada and even California New York are being SWAT team and closed because
[2:59:10.680 --> 2:59:16.120]  they're non-essential the tyranny is incredible but in areas like Texas and
[2:59:16.120 --> 2:59:19.560]  South Dakota and Florida where we have a history of more liberty all the
[2:59:19.560 --> 2:59:24.480]  lockdowns are over ladies and gentlemen this is martial law this has all been a
[2:59:24.480 --> 2:59:28.400]  massive martial law drill and now it's more important than ever to spread the
[2:59:28.400 --> 2:59:32.200]  word about info wars and a support info wars we have three of our best selling
[2:59:32.200 --> 2:59:36.160]  products selling out but despite that they're all massively discounted

[2:59:42.880 --> 2:59:47.360]  immune system it's 50% off as well best deal ever take advantage of it and info
[2:59:47.360 --> 2:59:51.840]  wars store calm and fund the info war
[2:59:51.840 --> 3:00:02.000]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's
[3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:06.280]  gonna happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got
[3:00:06.280 --> 3:00:25.840]  one from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[3:00:25.840 --> 3:00:29.880]  anytime you throw your weight behind the political party that controls two
[3:00:29.880 --> 3:00:33.640]  thirds of the government and that party can't keep the promise that it made to
[3:00:33.640 --> 3:00:37.680]  you during election time and you're dumb enough to walk around continuing to
[3:00:37.680 --> 3:00:42.080]  identify yourself with that party you're not only a chump but you're a traitor to
[3:00:42.080 --> 3:00:44.520]  your race
[3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:51.920]  Dixie Grant is nothing but a Democrat who ever runs the Democrats is also the
[3:00:51.920 --> 3:00:55.720]  father of the Dixie Crats and the father of all of them is sitting in the White
[3:00:55.720 --> 3:01:03.600]  House and those were powerful words of wisdom from Malcolm X he called the
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:08.400]  Democrats Dixie Crats Larry Pinkney joins us now and Larry I wanted to get
[3:01:08.400 --> 3:01:14.160]  your take on that we suppose Malcolm met by Dixie Crats well Malcolm was
[3:01:14.160 --> 3:01:20.400]  referring specifically to the fact that the Democrat Party is not only
[3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:27.400]  hypocritical but was the and still is but the most fundamentally racist party
[3:01:27.400 --> 3:01:34.840]  people don't realize that the Democrats built their party on racism okay and
[3:01:34.840 --> 3:01:39.240]  people think that all mine the Democrats have oh they're they're so
[3:01:39.240 --> 3:01:43.480]  wonderful the reality is that the Democrats are probably the biggest
[3:01:43.480 --> 3:01:49.680]  devils of the two parties it's no doubt that the Democrats have shown
[3:01:49.680 --> 3:01:55.600]  repeatedly that they cannot be trusted okay and I'm talking about primarily
[3:01:55.600 --> 3:01:59.920]  their leadership so when Malcolm brother Malcolm referred to them as Dixie
[3:01:59.920 --> 3:02:06.080]  Crats he was talking about their fundamental racism and they are still
[3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:11.960]  no matter what their symbolism is they are still fundamentally racist I think
[3:02:11.960 --> 3:02:16.960]  my favorite quote from Malcolm X was was something he said about the mainstream
[3:02:16.960 --> 3:02:21.760]  news media and I mean he nailed it when he said that the media is the most
[3:02:21.760 --> 3:02:26.720]  powerful entity on earth they have the power to make the innocent guilty and
[3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:34.080]  the guilty innocent and he also said if if you are not careful the newspapers
[3:02:34.080 --> 3:02:39.120]  will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people
[3:02:39.120 --> 3:02:45.440]  who are doing the oppressing and that brings me to today's progressive liberal
[3:02:45.440 --> 3:02:51.560]  Democrats what do you think Malcolm X would say about Black Lives Matter well
[3:02:51.560 --> 3:02:59.680]  oh my god you know Malcolm and I when I met Malcolm and spoke with him one thing
[3:02:59.680 --> 3:03:05.160]  that was crystal clear to me was that brother Malcolm was a strong believer in
[3:03:05.160 --> 3:03:11.520]  family values traditional family okay what we call the nuclear family Black
[3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:20.680]  Lives Matter is I'm sure Malcolm would see the hypocrisy of Black Lives Matter
[3:03:20.680 --> 3:03:27.920]  I'm sure that Malcolm would know that Black Lives Matter their so-called
[3:03:27.920 --> 3:03:35.840]  leadership okay opposes the traditional family values they oppose okay the
[3:03:35.840 --> 3:03:40.640]  nuclear family and by the way you know they made it clear themselves in their
[3:03:40.640 --> 3:03:45.880]  original manifesto it says it it says it in their mission statement their
[3:03:45.880 --> 3:03:49.920]  mission statement on their website it's still up there they want to break up the
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:55.320]  nuclear family exactly so when you break up the nuclear family in essence what
[3:03:55.320 --> 3:04:01.640]  you're doing is you are destroying first of all the family but you destroyed the
[3:04:01.640 --> 3:04:06.080]  family you destroyed the nation yep that's let's be clear about that and they
[3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:11.840]  know that they're not stupid they know what they're doing so you know this this
[3:04:11.840 --> 3:04:17.560]  is I wish people so many people I think they have good when I say they I'm not
[3:04:17.560 --> 3:04:21.520]  talking about the leadership there are people who caught up with Black Lives
[3:04:21.520 --> 3:04:27.520]  Matter who have no clue as to who and what they really are they have their
[3:04:27.520 --> 3:04:32.920]  treacherous their treacherous and I'm sure brother Malcolm would would have
[3:04:32.920 --> 3:04:38.040]  seen that I have no doubt about that all right I want to play you another clip and
[3:04:38.040 --> 3:04:43.720]  I think you'll recognize this guy this is another warning from the past on what
[3:04:43.720 --> 3:04:51.520]  fascism will look like in America roll it you know someone very profoundly once
[3:04:51.520 --> 3:04:55.240]  said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America it'll come in the
[3:04:55.240 --> 3:05:00.280]  name of liberalism it's it's kind of eerie isn't it I mean the fact is is
[3:05:00.280 --> 3:05:10.360]  that I refer to the Democrats primarily I call them neo-liberal fascists why
[3:05:10.360 --> 3:05:16.680]  because they neo-new liberal they call themselves fascists they definitely are
[3:05:16.680 --> 3:05:23.680]  okay in particular their leadership so Reagan was correct I have to say he was
[3:05:23.680 --> 3:05:29.520]  correct this is how they're trying to bring fascism in and they called
[3:05:29.520 --> 3:05:36.560]  everybody else what they themselves are okay so they are the fascists they are
[3:05:36.560 --> 3:05:42.360]  the racist they are the ones who are facilitating and perpetrating and
[3:05:42.360 --> 3:05:49.240]  perpetuating this the situation so you know what Reagan was correct it's like
[3:05:49.240 --> 3:05:56.000]  he somehow saw the future because that's exactly what these neo-liberal
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:02.720]  Democrats fascists okay neo-liberal fascist Democrats I hope people remember
[3:06:02.720 --> 3:06:06.760]  that expression and I'm talking about their so-called leadership which I
[3:06:06.760 --> 3:06:10.480]  call misleadership but that's what I'm talking about their so-called
[3:06:10.480 --> 3:06:15.680]  leadership sorry I got on a ramp now I love it and we don't want to let the
[3:06:15.680 --> 3:06:21.560]  establishment Republicans off the hook either because I mean really that they're
[3:06:21.560 --> 3:06:26.720]  the same evil corrupt part of the same evil corrupt system the two-party
[3:06:26.720 --> 3:06:31.440]  system is a lie you know let's let's face it we have a one-party system it's
[3:06:31.440 --> 3:06:35.760]  the government party or now we could even call it the one-world government
[3:06:35.760 --> 3:06:41.400]  party we've been taken over by my opinion by China the UN we no longer
[3:06:41.400 --> 3:06:48.280]  have fair elections we don't have free speech the media is state-run
[3:06:48.280 --> 3:06:53.760]  propaganda and there's there's no freedom of the press and our justice
[3:06:53.760 --> 3:07:00.760]  system is completely corrupt along with all of our intelligence agencies they've
[3:07:00.760 --> 3:07:07.400]  all been compromised and now the FBI is actively out there arresting and
[3:07:07.400 --> 3:07:15.360]  imprisoning political dissidents Larry do you think America is a failed state
[3:07:15.360 --> 3:07:22.760]  well I think that it's a failed state to the extent that the quote-unquote deep
[3:07:22.760 --> 3:07:28.600]  state the the neoliberal fascist Democrats and the Rhino Republicans to
[3:07:28.600 --> 3:07:35.800]  the extent that they are pushing to make this nation this Republic a failed
[3:07:35.800 --> 3:07:41.240]  state we've got to turn that around we have to expose it for what it really is
[3:07:41.240 --> 3:07:47.720]  but at this at this point in time I have to say yes it is a failed state well I
[3:07:47.720 --> 3:07:51.080]  think it's safe to say that some people watching this broadcast for the first
[3:07:51.080 --> 3:07:56.160]  time tonight we literally made their heads explode because first we played a
[3:07:56.160 --> 3:08:01.800]  clip from Malcolm X followed by a clip from Ronald Reagan both of them on the
[3:08:01.800 --> 3:08:08.320]  same side both of them unified in their warning about the impending liberal
[3:08:08.320 --> 3:08:14.400]  fascist takeover of America that's why we call this an information war that's
[3:08:14.400 --> 3:08:20.680]  why we are going against the mainstream controlled narrative and telling it like
[3:08:20.680 --> 3:08:25.560]  it is and as my good friend Larry Pinkney says it is what it is Larry you
[3:08:25.560 --> 3:08:30.080]  have the last word tell us what you really think what I really think is we
[3:08:30.080 --> 3:08:37.080]  better do something about this now we better inform one another I'm glad that
[3:08:37.080 --> 3:08:42.600]  people are looking at us and and I hope they're critically thinking about what
[3:08:42.600 --> 3:08:49.920]  we are saying we're we are at a turning point in our history are we going to be
[3:08:49.920 --> 3:08:55.480]  or are we not going to be with said expression to be or not to be that is
[3:08:55.480 --> 3:09:02.600]  the question I say we must be a republic we must stop being brainwashed and
[3:09:02.600 --> 3:09:09.080]  controlled by a propaganda machine that people have the unmitigated gall to
[3:09:09.080 --> 3:09:14.600]  call a news media it's not a news media it's a propaganda machine so that's
[3:09:14.600 --> 3:09:19.280]  what I want to say much love to all of you brothers and sisters black white
[3:09:19.280 --> 3:09:24.400]  brown red yellow US citizens of this republic let's keep on keeping on
[3:09:24.400 --> 3:09:30.560]  let's fight let's struggle let's get our republic back that's right and the
[3:09:30.560 --> 3:09:34.840]  struggle continues thank you my friend we'll see you again next week thank you
[3:09:34.840 --> 3:09:38.560]  brother love you men see you
[3:09:51.160 --> 3:09:55.280]  one of the most popular memes on the internet the last decade has been
[3:09:55.280 --> 3:10:01.080]  Alec Jones was right but it now routinely trends number one on platforms
[3:10:01.080 --> 3:10:05.320]  like Twitter and Facebook making the globalists pull their hair out in
[3:10:05.320 --> 3:10:08.720]  anger but let me tell you we are tomorrow's news today and thanks for

[3:11:52.440 --> 3:11:58.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:21.160]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones all right I got
[3:12:21.160 --> 3:12:24.760]  through Mason on the show because he was happy to come down to Austin Texas
[3:12:24.760 --> 3:12:30.160]  and be on air with us because he's a great respected trusted gold company
[3:12:30.160 --> 3:12:36.000]  gold and silver but now that he's here and I'm glad he wants to get into this
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:41.360]  he really wants to get into how this is a spiritual war and so that's what we're
[3:12:41.360 --> 3:12:43.840]  gonna be covering the next three segments and the globalists want to make
[3:12:43.840 --> 3:12:46.440]  fun of Christians they want to make fun of people have a relationship with God
[3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:50.840]  not because they're really atheists but because they understand the power of
[3:12:50.840 --> 3:12:56.040]  Christ and the power of God and they're trying to block us from that so they
[3:12:56.040 --> 3:12:59.560]  can control us and dominate us so a lot of people tell me about the health
[3:12:59.560 --> 3:13:02.520]  effects of fasting I've never really done it that much but I've really been
[3:13:02.520 --> 3:13:05.440]  thinking about doing it lately and especially intermittent fasting or
[3:13:05.440 --> 3:13:09.360]  doing three-day fast on just red water and then I'm looking around for a great
[3:13:09.360 --> 3:13:13.480]  gold sponsor already know this guy is seeing one Fox News even Forbes and he
[3:13:13.480 --> 3:13:16.720]  starts going okay we'll talk about selling gold silver later let's talk
[3:13:16.720 --> 3:13:20.160]  about what the Bible says about fighting evil so the left makes fun of this
[3:13:20.160 --> 3:13:23.240]  because they hate it they it's like Obama won't give a speech somewhere
[3:13:23.240 --> 3:13:27.040]  we're across is these people are really evil so he's Drew Mason he's the
[3:13:27.040 --> 3:13:31.440]  principal at st. Joseph partners calm in fours gold calm it's the same site you
[3:13:31.440 --> 3:13:34.200]  just go there and we get a commission when you purchase gold and silver and
[3:13:34.200 --> 3:13:37.720]  other precious metals they also buy gold and silver and other precious metals and
[3:13:37.720 --> 3:13:41.000]  jewelry you name it they're a one-stop shop they're great people very highly
[3:13:41.000 --> 3:13:44.400]  rated that's why we have them as a sponsor but he's not here about that in
[3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:47.760]  these segments this is a shorter segment two longer segments coming up you were
[3:13:47.760 --> 3:13:52.520]  really excited the other day people liked the interview getting into Bible
[3:13:52.520 --> 3:13:56.880]  passages in Christ said pray and fast they've taken that out strangely in
[3:13:56.880 --> 3:14:00.320]  modern Catholic and Protestant Bibles because there's power in that you're
[3:14:00.320 --> 3:14:03.560]  saying well I believe what Jesus said and there is power in what Christ said so
[3:14:03.560 --> 3:14:09.360]  tell us about that thank you so I would say this is a big statement if info
[3:14:09.360 --> 3:14:16.400]  wars are about the battle between good and evil the ultimate info war could be
[3:14:16.400 --> 3:14:21.920]  about fasting and I say that because remember st. Paul told us don't wonder
[3:14:21.920 --> 3:14:26.240]  why things happen in the world everything happens because of the battle of
[3:14:26.240 --> 3:14:32.720]  principalities around us so if you start from that perspective and then you begin
[3:14:32.720 --> 3:14:37.160]  drilling into scripture and the passage that we spoke about earlier mark 929 and
[3:14:37.160 --> 3:14:44.360]  the parallel and Matthew for literally millennia Christ's words were specific
[3:14:44.360 --> 3:14:49.840]  telling us when evil is that it's most powerful most intense Christians can
[3:14:49.840 --> 3:14:55.520]  pray all day long and they're gonna lose every time we saw it in scripture with
[3:14:55.520 --> 3:14:59.800]  the guys at Christ hand-picked hand trained himself they lost and they
[3:14:59.800 --> 3:15:03.400]  said them why Lord and because he said this is a special case requires prayer
[3:15:03.400 --> 3:15:08.200]  and fasting so think about this from a war mentality a military perspective if
[3:15:08.200 --> 3:15:13.000]  you were evil what would be the best thing you could do it would be to
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:20.400]  destroy an awareness of how to defeat evil and that is exactly what
[3:15:20.400 --> 3:15:25.600]  transpired with the rewritings of these scriptures Christ's teaching there
[3:15:25.600 --> 3:15:30.360]  should have been titled how to defeat evil by removing it we've now had an
[3:15:30.360 --> 3:15:34.240]  entire generation that's lost consciousness of how to do that I think
[3:15:34.240 --> 3:15:37.640]  they may be putting up on the screens you can see how these translations have
[3:15:37.640 --> 3:15:42.400]  changed in the 1960s now let me go right to a question that some people are going
[3:15:42.400 --> 3:15:47.920]  to hear they're gonna say well the reason we took that word fasting out of
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:53.600]  the Bible is because in the 1960s we found this manuscript and it didn't
[3:15:53.600 --> 3:15:58.880]  include the word fasting and it was the oldest manuscript here's why could
[3:15:58.880 --> 3:16:03.360]  recognize evil is never going to back down it's never gonna say okay you were
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:10.120]  right you caught me I'm gonna I was lying it only is going to cede to power so
[3:16:10.120 --> 3:16:16.320]  that statement that it was inaccurate to have fasting is a misrepresentation we
[3:16:16.320 --> 3:16:22.480]  have thousands of manuscripts the only two that don't include fasting were in
[3:16:22.480 --> 3:16:27.040]  pristine condition because believers in that day knew there was many things
[3:16:27.040 --> 3:16:31.160]  wrong with them they never used them the manuscripts that the early Christians
[3:16:31.160 --> 3:16:35.040]  were working with all said fasting but the but older who does it's full of
[3:16:35.040 --> 3:16:39.400]  fasting and you have Jesus fasting for 40 days before you know Satan's gonna
[3:16:39.400 --> 3:16:43.360]  confront it so that's there too you're absolutely right there are so many yes
[3:16:43.360 --> 3:16:49.360]  and that is a stinging defeat that Satan has never forgotten that Christ fasted
[3:16:49.360 --> 3:16:52.840]  and it crushed him when we see the Apostles later fasting they have
[3:16:52.840 --> 3:16:58.200]  incredible victories when we see again Esther fasting we saw the miraculous
[3:16:58.200 --> 3:17:03.080]  salvation of the Jews who are slated for extermination we see families that are
[3:17:03.080 --> 3:17:06.800]  traveling through war zones with Ezra and they know they're just sitting ducks
[3:17:06.800 --> 3:17:12.120]  and so before they do they fast and they are miraculously protected Derek
[3:17:12.120 --> 3:17:18.080]  Prince the great Protestant evangelist said once it's almost impossible to
[3:17:18.080 --> 3:17:24.880]  exaggerate the power of prayer with fasting and for Catholic listeners they
[3:17:24.880 --> 3:17:29.400]  may be interested to know and one of her most famous alleged apparitions the
[3:17:29.400 --> 3:17:34.800]  mother of Jesus said you have forgotten that through prayer and fasting wars can
[3:17:34.800 --> 3:17:40.680]  be averted natural holocaust can be reverted so that's why we fast is to
[3:17:40.680 --> 3:17:45.120]  bring about this incredible power that when God made the rules the universe he
[3:17:45.120 --> 3:17:50.800]  said will only be fully unleashed if believers make the small sacrifice of
[3:17:50.800 --> 3:17:55.240]  fasting so that's why when do we fast we fast again in the model of first
[3:17:55.240 --> 3:18:01.440]  century Christians who said believers are obligated to fast every Wednesday and
[3:18:01.440 --> 3:18:06.280]  Friday now I concede that is not in Scripture but it's in a book I believe
[3:18:06.280 --> 3:18:12.480]  proper pronunciation is a didache which is a very short book and these people
[3:18:12.480 --> 3:18:16.080]  who had observed Christ gave us that granularity they also gave us the
[3:18:16.080 --> 3:18:21.960]  granularity is not in Scripture they said abortion is sin so although it's not
[3:18:21.960 --> 3:18:26.440]  in Scripture that is a worthwhile document to consider now let me build a
[3:18:26.440 --> 3:18:30.800]  little further on that with what we know in Scripture it would support the idea
[3:18:30.800 --> 3:18:37.960]  of fasting twice a week we see the parable that Jesus gives when the rabbi
[3:18:37.960 --> 3:18:45.080]  and the sinner are at the temple and the rabbi is saying oh Lord I tithe and I
[3:18:45.080 --> 3:18:52.640]  fast twice a week and the Lord says his prayer is not meritorious it wasn't from
[3:18:52.640 --> 3:18:57.400]  the heart why was he tithing because that was the obligation they had to give
[3:18:57.400 --> 3:19:00.680]  a minimum of 10% if he had any generosity he would have been giving 20
[3:19:00.680 --> 3:19:04.120]  percent or something like that and why was he fasting twice a week because they
[3:19:04.120 --> 3:19:08.080]  were obligated they knew they were obligated to fast twice a week remember
[3:19:08.080 --> 3:19:13.680]  Jesus said don't do as the Pharisees do but listen to what they say because they
[3:19:13.680 --> 3:19:19.280]  know the rules we then see John the Baptist disciples come to Jesus and
[3:19:19.280 --> 3:19:24.240]  they say Lord what is going on here your disciples aren't fasting we fast like
[3:19:24.240 --> 3:19:32.320]  the Pharisees fast we fast twice a week so there is this precedent that is not
[3:19:32.320 --> 3:19:38.480]  a smoking gun but I would make the case supports this frequency of twice a week
[3:19:38.480 --> 3:19:44.560]  we also see St. Paul explicitly saying that regular fasting is expected
[3:19:44.560 --> 3:19:49.240]  especially of ministers and then well the health benefits I mean the fasting
[3:19:49.240 --> 3:19:52.440]  aren't debated and of course I'm very pleasantly plump doesn't mean I've ever
[3:19:52.440 --> 3:19:56.640]  followed all the recommendations of being healthy but I mean it just I mean it
[3:19:56.640 --> 3:20:02.680]  makes sense to be disciplined and in this decadent world I mean too fast it's
[3:20:02.680 --> 3:20:05.720]  also a mental thing to also make you remember there are people that don't
[3:20:05.720 --> 3:20:09.680]  have food very true very true and you're right the health benefits are
[3:20:09.680 --> 3:20:14.600]  extraordinary many people don't realize that a Nobel Prize was given not too
[3:20:14.600 --> 3:20:20.280]  long ago specifically on the research benefits and uncovered of fasting hold
[3:20:20.280 --> 3:20:23.640]  on to remation I want to come back and talk about that again he's our new great
[3:20:23.640 --> 3:20:28.960]  gold sponsor but he wants to talk about his experience how to overcome evil with
[3:20:28.960 --> 3:20:33.400]  prayer and fasting as Jesus told us to do we'll come back he's st. joseph

[3:21:56.120 --> 3:22:00.440]  thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to
[3:22:00.440 --> 3:22:03.520]  warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year okay I'm a
[3:22:03.520 --> 3:22:09.080]  double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go
[3:22:09.080 --> 3:22:14.600]  away living defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics for two years that
[3:22:14.600 --> 3:22:19.440]  almost killed me living defense brought me back I wanted to just quote from the
[3:22:19.440 --> 3:22:25.120]  Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is Matthew 24 verse 9
[3:22:25.120 --> 3:22:30.880]  then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you
[3:22:30.880 --> 3:22:36.040]  shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be
[3:22:36.040 --> 3:22:40.800]  offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another right where
[3:22:40.800 --> 3:22:44.560]  we're at brother and that's because God's name is on the founding of this
[3:22:44.560 --> 3:22:47.800]  country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because
[3:22:47.800 --> 3:22:57.200]  God created this country. Your voice counts when you share information be it

[3:25:30.760 --> 3:25:34.080]  because I sat through a lot of Sunday school about fasting I remember my parents
[3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:38.000]  when I was a child but faster three days a couple times a year and I knew that was
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:43.160]  always certainly interesting and so here we are now with Drew Mason he is the
[3:25:43.160 --> 3:25:48.160]  principal at st joseph partners dot com and I he was happy to come down here he
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:51.960]  sees our gold sponsor and we're really excited about him and he's got a great
[3:25:51.960 --> 3:25:56.480]  name and great credit and great reviews online I've seen him on Fox News and
[3:25:56.480 --> 3:26:01.040]  read about him in Forbes but he just has this message about the power you've had
[3:26:01.040 --> 3:26:05.680]  in fasting so we've got this segment the next but personally tell me before you
[3:26:05.680 --> 3:26:10.240]  back into it how did you get into fasting and what has it done for you so
[3:26:10.240 --> 3:26:15.360]  what really led me back into it was an experience I had when I did a mission
[3:26:15.360 --> 3:26:20.520]  trip behind the iron curtain in the 1980s and it was to a town that's called
[3:26:20.520 --> 3:26:25.120]  Medjugorje where although the Catholic bishops have really suppressed it there's
[3:26:25.120 --> 3:26:29.760]  an incredible revival breaking out and that was where the message came you have
[3:26:29.760 --> 3:26:34.600]  forgotten that through the power of prayer and fasting can avert wars and it
[3:26:34.600 --> 3:26:38.840]  was the reminder that we are obligated to fast on Wednesdays and Fridays as is
[3:26:38.840 --> 3:26:44.800]  supported by the day decay and other documents my experience is that first
[3:26:44.800 --> 3:26:47.280]  of all to do with the way the first century Christians did it on bread and
[3:26:47.280 --> 3:26:53.680]  water is shockingly easy I think one of the great victories evil has had is it
[3:26:53.680 --> 3:26:59.080]  has created it the misbelief misperception that if you're going to
[3:26:59.080 --> 3:27:05.000]  make a fast worthy of God you have to be in such pain and so weak that you're
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:09.200]  going to be unable to function the way the first century Christians fast on a
[3:27:09.200 --> 3:27:14.000]  bread and water you're going to conclude is shockingly easy and the idea is that
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:18.800]  it's all about the heart it's all about the heart and when we start a fast we
[3:27:18.800 --> 3:27:25.440]  say Lord you know what you did for us is so big this is so little yes I love
[3:27:25.440 --> 3:27:30.600]  cheesesteaks we love seafood we love salads but we love you more so we make
[3:27:30.600 --> 3:27:35.880]  this tiny little sacrifice with joy Lord and restrict our intake to just bread
[3:27:35.880 --> 3:27:40.880]  and just water on this day so that your spirit will come America will be renewed
[3:27:40.880 --> 3:27:44.880]  again praying for the protection of our military our police our firefighters and
[3:27:44.880 --> 3:27:49.240]  we believe we are literally helping to preserve them the other thing I've seen
[3:27:49.240 --> 3:27:53.400]  from it I see the health benefits that we were alluding to a moment ago the
[3:27:53.400 --> 3:27:59.520]  improved focus you know a lot of Asians who are not spiritual fast because of
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:04.360]  the improved clarity you have the improved energy level it cleans out the
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:08.360]  toxins in your body we talked about the Nobel Prize but there's just literally
[3:28:08.360 --> 3:28:15.400]  been hundreds of research reports written on topics from dementia alzheimer's
[3:28:15.400 --> 3:28:18.720]  well rats and mice that they make fast live like three times longer it's
[3:28:18.720 --> 3:28:23.120]  crazy it's amazing it isn't and it's studies with worms to the worms live a
[3:28:23.120 --> 3:28:26.040]  lot longer when they make them fast and it makes sense doesn't it if God is
[3:28:26.040 --> 3:28:29.320]  telling us to do this that there is of course the primary spiritual benefit
[3:28:29.320 --> 3:28:32.440]  and then there's all these ancillary benefits including including the
[3:28:32.440 --> 3:28:37.240]  physical and another you asked me about what I have seen personally too and
[3:28:37.240 --> 3:28:42.400]  another benefit I would say and I can't recommend this highly enough to parents
[3:28:42.400 --> 3:28:47.480]  in this world where you hear of so many difficulties out there is the
[3:28:47.480 --> 3:28:55.120]  protection it affords from evil and we quoted earlier the 5th century evangelist
[3:28:55.120 --> 3:29:01.760]  who had a vision of something or a word and said the angels protect the
[3:29:01.760 --> 3:29:07.080]  families that fast so that is just in itself a wonderful wonderful blessing
[3:29:07.080 --> 3:29:11.160]  that seems to be supported as we see again through scripture whether it's
[3:29:11.160 --> 3:29:15.640]  Ezra or in different different parts of scripture so let me since we're talking
[3:29:15.640 --> 3:29:21.400]  about health benefits so allow me I'd like to mention one other brilliant
[3:29:21.400 --> 3:29:28.400]  victory evil has had in with regards to fasting modern-day consciousness so as
[3:29:28.400 --> 3:29:32.680]  you know when they came out the word communism the idea was it was community
[3:29:32.680 --> 3:29:37.320]  and people bought into it so now that we know communism communism how evil
[3:29:37.320 --> 3:29:40.800]  it is what it's done to civilizations you're never going to see a modern
[3:29:40.800 --> 3:29:45.120]  American politician say he's a communist so they have the same principles but
[3:29:45.120 --> 3:29:50.360]  they'll call it something else new packaging new packaging well if you're
[3:29:50.360 --> 3:29:54.320]  evil think about how brilliant it would be if you could get people to think they
[3:29:54.320 --> 3:29:57.600]  were fasting but they weren't they were actually the people were actually going
[3:29:57.600 --> 3:30:01.640]  through all of the the difficulty but they weren't getting the benefits and I
[3:30:01.640 --> 3:30:03.800]  was are you gonna say intermittent fasting is just like what they do in
[3:30:03.800 --> 3:30:07.400]  Ramadan where you where you don't eat during the day you only eat at night well
[3:30:07.400 --> 3:30:10.880]  what I want to say what I do want to say about intermittent fasting is that I
[3:30:10.880 --> 3:30:16.640]  believe it really is only intermittent dieting but the word fasting is used and
[3:30:16.640 --> 3:30:19.880]  it deceives people into thinking they're fasting here's the difference between
[3:30:19.880 --> 3:30:25.000]  dieting and fasting if you're doing it for yourself for your own health it's
[3:30:25.000 --> 3:30:30.400]  dieting if you're doing it for the purpose of our Lord repenting coming
[3:30:30.400 --> 3:30:36.120]  closer to him that is fasting so it's really a very soft difference so if you
[3:30:36.120 --> 3:30:42.400]  believe in and I see the signs I totally get and I also do myself practice the
[3:30:42.400 --> 3:30:46.920]  idea of you don't eat for at least 12 hours a day all the benefits that
[3:30:46.920 --> 3:30:52.920]  releases however what I would say to you is you want to ask the Lord to help you
[3:30:52.920 --> 3:30:59.520]  do this for the reason of him for fasting here's what I have found is the
[3:30:59.520 --> 3:31:04.040]  ultimate divider where people saying no way or okay the way the first century
[3:31:04.040 --> 3:31:08.240]  Christians fasted is on bread and water and if you're an intermittent fasting
[3:31:08.240 --> 3:31:11.000]  you're probably thinking I don't want to have bread I'm gonna have broccoli
[3:31:11.000 --> 3:31:16.000]  salad whatever the worst thing I can have is carbs there's a reason why heaven
[3:31:16.000 --> 3:31:20.160]  has told us bread and water is the best way there is the fast and just think for
[3:31:20.160 --> 3:31:26.760]  a moment about the war on bread and what has happened I know you think science
[3:31:26.760 --> 3:31:32.080]  has convinced you bread is bad God fed his people with manna bread in the desert
[3:31:32.080 --> 3:31:36.080]  for 40 years it wasn't a coincidence Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem
[3:31:36.080 --> 3:31:40.600]  which means house of bread it wasn't a coincidence Jesus fed the 5,000 with
[3:31:40.600 --> 3:31:45.520]  bread it wasn't a coincidence he said he was the bread of life and in his greatest
[3:31:45.520 --> 3:31:49.720]  miracle of all the Last Supper he said this is my body in the form of bread
[3:31:49.720 --> 3:31:53.560]  there is more to it than just a modern science theory telling you that bread is
[3:31:53.560 --> 3:31:58.720]  bad first century bread had no preservatives so a hundred percent
[3:31:58.720 --> 3:32:01.680]  whole grain is that the thing is they've also genetically engineered it where
[3:32:01.680 --> 3:32:05.680]  where it's a lot smaller it's a different type of grain you're you're
[3:32:05.680 --> 3:32:11.720]  right you're right the the breads that you get that are change for elongated
[3:32:11.720 --> 3:32:16.680]  shelf life are not any good you they're not any good if you get 100% whole grain
[3:32:16.680 --> 3:32:20.840]  bread the University of Oakland concluded this is the missing piece in the
[3:32:20.840 --> 3:32:25.080]  puzzle for American health the vitamins all that it brings to you so I would say
[3:32:25.080 --> 3:32:31.680]  to you that fasting is so good for you physically I pursue bread and water
[3:32:31.680 --> 3:32:35.280]  fasting because of heaven's guidance that this is the best fast it's the way
[3:32:35.280 --> 3:32:39.440]  the first century Christians fast and we do it we do it twice a week we talked
[3:32:39.440 --> 3:32:44.080]  a little bit about the results I want to share a couple of stories with you the
[3:32:44.080 --> 3:32:50.240]  organization C12 came up with some fascinating insights and they said they
[3:32:50.240 --> 3:32:55.280]  found out in London during World War two the Nazis were bombing it to death it
[3:32:55.280 --> 3:33:02.680]  was on its last last gasps and some of the Brits got together and they said we
[3:33:02.680 --> 3:33:08.920]  have to start fasting for a heavenly rescue and they did now we can't prove
[3:33:08.920 --> 3:33:13.000]  that this is what happened by any means but something very at least
[3:33:13.000 --> 3:33:17.800]  coincidental happened that is striking Hitler who had built this superstar
[3:33:17.800 --> 3:33:24.800]  panel to advise him and who had deferred to them on their guidance rejected their
[3:33:24.800 --> 3:33:30.960]  advice and went into Russia full bore pulling back from England England was
[3:33:30.960 --> 3:33:35.480]  spared after just this small group started fasting it's the incredible story
[3:33:35.480 --> 3:33:39.640]  that we see again and again through scriptures and so I come to you and I
[3:33:39.640 --> 3:33:43.840]  would say to I know so many of you are patriots who love this country and you're
[3:33:43.840 --> 3:33:47.680]  sitting there wondering what can I do for this country you may feel like you
[3:33:47.680 --> 3:33:51.760]  don't have any financial resources to contribute you don't have time you may
[3:33:51.760 --> 3:33:57.280]  be unemployed if you feel like you have been such a disappointment to whoever
[3:33:57.280 --> 3:34:05.000]  yourself your family if you're humble like that you are the warrior that evil
[3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:10.520]  fears the most if you will fast you will change history and you will have
[3:34:10.520 --> 3:34:16.480]  bragging rights for eternity that you will be so glad you've made this little
[3:34:16.480 --> 3:34:22.520]  effort and I truly believe that what we are seeing happening is this renaissance
[3:34:22.520 --> 3:34:26.280]  in America that's beginning to roll alright you're Mason is definitely a man
[3:34:26.280 --> 3:34:29.440]  on a mission and we know fasting is good for you so I'm and I know it's in the
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:32.280]  Bible I believe in it I don't know I'm gonna be able to do it but we're gonna
[3:34:32.280 --> 3:34:36.920]  try but but when we come back though let's talk about the fact that all this
[3:34:36.920 --> 3:34:40.320]  evil that's taking place is waking people up and there's that positive effect
[3:34:40.320 --> 3:34:43.440]  on the other side and I agree people shouldn't get depressed and down because
[3:34:43.440 --> 3:34:47.520]  scripture is all being fulfilled I mean this is all governments out in the open
[3:34:47.520 --> 3:34:53.040]  now they're right back the ultimate fluoride free charcoal mouthwash is now

[3:37:49.840 --> 3:37:54.640]  14 months ago I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world
[3:37:54.640 --> 3:37:59.360]  collapses the third world dies. We have such a complex civilization with so many
[3:37:59.360 --> 3:38:03.840]  billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world it causes a
[3:38:03.840 --> 3:38:07.960]  chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first
[3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:11.880]  world. Well now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States.
[3:38:11.880 --> 3:38:15.760]  That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely
[3:38:15.760 --> 3:38:19.840]  get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down. Plus the Keystone
[3:38:19.840 --> 3:38:23.600]  Pipeline's been shut down along with other pipelines. The left is now blowing up
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:28.440]  dams across the US. We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well.
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:32.640]  Ladies and gentlemen prepare to be a total slave. The third world is
[3:38:32.640 --> 3:38:35.800]  imploding as well. The borders have been removed. Until you wake up this is a
[3:38:35.800 --> 3:38:40.160]  globalist tricom takeover. Great reset. You have no hope. They're announcing that
[3:38:40.160 --> 3:38:45.200]  there will be less than two-thirds the gas needed this summer. So they told you
[3:38:45.200 --> 3:38:48.320]  that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your
[3:38:48.320 --> 3:38:50.640]  family.
[3:38:50.640 --> 3:39:14.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show resistance to tyrants is obedience to
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:39.920]  God. It's Alex Jones.
[3:39:39.920 --> 3:39:42.760]  Yeah a lot of people waking up. A lot of people were in Hollywood are waking up.
[3:39:42.760 --> 3:39:46.920]  All right. Drew Mason is our guest here with us a final segment. He was in
[3:39:46.920 --> 3:39:51.760]  studio with us. Well today but then we ran out of time live. So we're taping this
[3:39:51.760 --> 3:39:56.320]  to air later here on the broadcast. So thanks for watching. Thanks for listening
[3:39:56.320 --> 3:39:59.200]  and I really want to talk more about positive stuff. My job has been
[3:39:59.200 --> 3:40:01.560]  exposing the new world order and the fact that it exists and world
[3:40:01.560 --> 3:40:05.240]  government and they're bad guys. Now most people know that's true. Now we
[3:40:05.240 --> 3:40:07.840]  talk about the positive what we're fighting for and ways to fight back.
[3:40:07.840 --> 3:40:11.280]  So we're getting into fasting but I was begging you get into the gold and
[3:40:11.280 --> 3:40:14.760]  silver sometimes you're our sponsor and I want people to buy a lot of silver
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:17.400]  and gold. I think they should get it. I think it's going to go up and value
[3:40:17.400 --> 3:40:22.120]  certainly it's a hedge against inflation but finishing up on fasting. So you were
[3:40:22.120 --> 3:40:26.480]  saying too that there's so much of discourages people. There is so much good
[3:40:26.480 --> 3:40:29.920]  news happening out there and I want to encourage you to think about scripture.
[3:40:29.920 --> 3:40:35.240]  There's a reason why Jesus said fear not. We have nothing to fear but God. No
[3:40:35.240 --> 3:40:42.840]  disease. No political group. Nothing to fear but God. And coming on here I had
[3:40:42.840 --> 3:40:48.840]  the thought while I was praying of Elijah the great Jewish prophet and we won't
[3:40:48.840 --> 3:40:53.160]  get into the details here but he just had extraordinary miracles pouring
[3:40:53.160 --> 3:40:59.320]  through him and then one day the king's wife said some bad things about him so
[3:40:59.320 --> 3:41:05.200]  we were going to come after him and Elijah retreated and it turns out plays
[3:41:05.200 --> 3:41:12.560]  out he's in a cave hiding and the Lord says to him what are you doing here? What
[3:41:12.560 --> 3:41:16.680]  are you doing here? You've seen all that I do. You saw the miracles of fire I
[3:41:16.680 --> 3:41:21.200]  brought down as you prayed. What are you doing here? And I think that is really a
[3:41:21.200 --> 3:41:25.160]  message for us in America today too. What are we doing here? Why are we scared?
[3:41:25.160 --> 3:41:29.640]  Why are we intimidated by these Satanists? Because we've got the power. We've got
[3:41:29.640 --> 3:41:33.320]  Christ. We have the power. We have the victory and we're looking in the wrong
[3:41:33.320 --> 3:41:40.280]  places for leadership. So I fully believe as we pray and as we fast local
[3:41:40.280 --> 3:41:43.280]  leaders are going to begin the scales are going to fall from their eyes. It's
[3:41:43.280 --> 3:41:47.960]  going to come clear and clear what we need to do on in terms of our strategy
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:52.880]  and it will give you confidence and peace and stepping forward and having
[3:41:52.880 --> 3:41:59.080]  courage. One of the great messages from Medjugorje said if you will preach the
[3:41:59.080 --> 3:42:06.520]  gospel without fear the truth will miraculously win. The truth will
[3:42:06.520 --> 3:42:10.640]  miraculously win. And that's why I began my comments with the words praise be
[3:42:10.640 --> 3:42:15.560]  Jesus. Three words. It's preaching the gospel and I'm writing on her coattails
[3:42:15.560 --> 3:42:21.400]  and believing and I'm seeing how the truth is miraculously winning. So there
[3:42:21.400 --> 3:42:26.560]  is so much cause for optimism and hope. There's so much good that's coming on. I
[3:42:26.560 --> 3:42:31.400]  do want to encourage you. Don't feel like your participation isn't important.
[3:42:31.400 --> 3:42:36.840]  Satan tells you you can't have any impact on the world. You're not
[3:42:36.840 --> 3:42:40.920]  powerful. God is telling you if you had any idea how powerful just your
[3:42:40.920 --> 3:42:46.680]  response alone is you would be brought to tears. The more people as it says
[3:42:46.680 --> 3:42:50.000]  what two people agree upon earth God makes it so and heaven the more of us
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:54.280]  together believing that brings God in. That is so true. That's a great point in
[3:42:54.280 --> 3:42:59.480]  Leviticus. It says there's an exponential power that comes to the
[3:42:59.480 --> 3:43:03.960]  world when believers join together. So we don't need a hundred million people
[3:43:03.960 --> 3:43:06.960]  to join us and that's why all over the world they're trying to shut churches
[3:43:06.960 --> 3:43:11.400]  down but also conservative you know Orthodox Jewish centers everything
[3:43:11.400 --> 3:43:15.360]  Protestant Catholic Jewish they're shutting them all down. Amen. And it is
[3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:20.120]  it's wonderful to see this awakening that is happening the scales falling from
[3:43:20.120 --> 3:43:24.480]  people's eyes. So I really want to encourage you it's so easy to fast on
[3:43:24.480 --> 3:43:27.240]  bread and water. If you're hungry during the day have as much bread as you want
[3:43:27.240 --> 3:43:31.040]  can go for 100% whole grains. If you want to put some butter on it some olive
[3:43:31.040 --> 3:43:35.160]  oil you know if you're diabetic talk to your doctor but put almond butter on
[3:43:35.160 --> 3:43:40.200]  there things like that. It's not it's not that this is a great burden. Again this
[3:43:40.200 --> 3:43:43.880]  is whole grain but tons of protein tons of B vitamins. It's just a little
[3:43:43.880 --> 3:43:48.240]  sacrifice. That's all God's looking for. If you think about it we had paradise
[3:43:48.240 --> 3:43:53.440]  right and all God asked us to do was the tiniest little fast. Just don't eat that
[3:43:53.440 --> 3:43:57.800]  sugar on the apple tree. And Satan being the great salesman that he is. They are
[3:43:57.800 --> 3:44:03.120]  masters with words. Didn't talk about I'm evil and you're gonna be destroyed.
[3:44:03.120 --> 3:44:08.160]  Talked about you becoming Godlike and that the sea and that's what paradise.
[3:44:08.160 --> 3:44:12.080]  That's what big tech says now is we're gonna merge and become God with
[3:44:12.080 --> 3:44:15.600]  machines. It's the same story again but you got to get rid of the Christians.
[3:44:15.600 --> 3:44:21.640]  Now briefly let's talk about gold in the Bible. So the history of gold is
[3:44:21.640 --> 3:44:28.880]  incredible. It literally goes back to the Genesis before Adam and Eve were
[3:44:28.880 --> 3:44:31.720]  thrown out of the Garden of Eden which is amazing. You wouldn't think there'd be
[3:44:31.720 --> 3:44:35.080]  any reason for gold any reason for stores of value back then but it literally
[3:44:35.080 --> 3:44:39.520]  goes back that far. And whether you go to the Chinese ancient Chinese
[3:44:39.520 --> 3:44:43.440]  civilizations pick your civilization it has preserved wealth. What else is it
[3:44:43.440 --> 3:44:48.320]  saying in the Bible? I believe and this is something that Wall Street will laugh
[3:44:48.320 --> 3:44:54.440]  at. Finance is supposed to be just about the track record. Gold's track record is
[3:44:54.440 --> 3:44:58.800]  spectacular. Seven percent a year since it's begun trading freely for an asset
[3:44:58.800 --> 3:45:02.920]  that is as risk-free as there is in the world. Eight percent a year this century.
[3:45:02.920 --> 3:45:08.240]  That's incredibly credible for an asset that has no counterparty risk, that has
[3:45:08.240 --> 3:45:12.080]  no liabilities and it's always worked. Why is it? It's very personal, it's very
[3:45:12.080 --> 3:45:19.520]  intimate. It is. It is. And so why could it be that Wall Street and financial
[3:45:19.520 --> 3:45:23.440]  advisors hate this so much? Well part of the reason clearly is that it's a less
[3:45:23.440 --> 3:45:31.160]  profitable product line than derivatives. Part of the reason surely even if
[3:45:31.160 --> 3:45:36.120]  unintentionally is that gold is again so simple that it removes the need for some
[3:45:36.120 --> 3:45:40.480]  intermediary or advisor. Well that's it. You can't add a bunch of cost on to it
[3:45:40.480 --> 3:45:45.240]  and a bunch of fees. It is very transparent. It is completely
[3:45:45.240 --> 3:45:50.640]  transparent and a third reason I would give you is I believe it is biblical. And
[3:45:50.640 --> 3:45:57.320]  in the Jewish scriptures God actually makes the statement the gold and the
[3:45:57.320 --> 3:46:05.680]  silver are mine. So if you're evil and if there's value in good to gold as he was
[3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:09.640]  counseling us because in the New Testament it's the only asset that I see
[3:46:09.640 --> 3:46:14.160]  reading scriptures where God specifically counsels us to buy gold so that
[3:46:14.160 --> 3:46:19.960]  we may grow wealthy in Revelation. Now I understand completely that the primary
[3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:24.800]  intent of that statement to buy gold refined in the fire so you may grow
[3:46:24.800 --> 3:46:29.160]  wealthy wasn't literal, it was spiritual, but God could have chosen any other
[3:46:29.160 --> 3:46:33.280]  asset. He could have said go and buy farmland, go and buy oceanfront real
[3:46:33.280 --> 3:46:37.240]  estate where you can catch the treasures of the sea. There's a reason why he said
[3:46:37.240 --> 3:46:42.440]  gold and if you look at the track record it has indeed preserved wealth. So those
[3:46:42.440 --> 3:46:48.520]  are some of the things I see biblically Alex that support from a spiritual
[3:46:48.520 --> 3:46:51.960]  perspective what I think is so clear from a historical perspective and from a
[3:46:51.960 --> 3:46:55.440]  financial perspective. Absolutely and again you're selling as much gold as
[3:46:55.440 --> 3:46:58.840]  you can get your hands on right now but you're actually ready to deliver it to
[3:46:58.840 --> 3:47:02.960]  people within three weeks. If you want to sell gold we'll buy any kind of
[3:47:02.960 --> 3:47:07.760]  gold you have broken jewelry whatever it may be your old dental fillings if you
[3:47:07.760 --> 3:47:12.080]  have a form of gold that isn't very liquid an odd shape bar we'll buy it and
[3:47:12.080 --> 3:47:16.000]  help you swap into much more liquid gold like we're talking about earlier that's
[3:47:16.000 --> 3:47:20.040]  minted by a sovereign. This is a hot market you guys are great folks good
[3:47:20.040 --> 3:47:23.120]  service and you're not ripping people off and again people if you want to
[3:47:23.120 --> 3:47:26.640]  support them there are sponsoring you go to infowarsgold.com that's
[3:47:26.640 --> 3:47:30.920]  infowarsgold.com that's just a link that goes we get some support from your
[3:47:30.920 --> 3:47:35.720]  purchases to stjosephpartners.com but that's infowarsgold.com and that will
[3:47:35.720 --> 3:47:38.440]  help fund our operation to expose the new world order and I'm just glad to have a
[3:47:38.440 --> 3:47:42.640]  good reputable gold company like you with us and on top of it you're
[3:47:42.640 --> 3:47:46.080]  definitely going to be able to focus on Christ the spiritual nature of this
[3:47:46.080 --> 3:47:50.160]  because that's everything and you know from so many perspectives just fasting
[3:47:50.160 --> 3:47:52.720]  it's gonna make you think about God the whole time you're doing it and why
[3:47:52.720 --> 3:47:55.440]  you're doing it so it's not like a negative thing to make it about a
[3:47:55.440 --> 3:47:58.600]  sacrifice for God not just for your health I mean it's a good thing to make
[3:47:58.600 --> 3:48:02.520]  it about that while you do it it is a blessing to be here and to share and
[3:48:02.520 --> 3:48:09.600]  one group I didn't specify Alex has a very admirable bunch of young adults and
[3:48:09.600 --> 3:48:15.040]  even students who are in his audience I want to just reach out to you and say I
[3:48:15.040 --> 3:48:19.120]  think your future is so bright I know you read all these headlines and you
[3:48:19.120 --> 3:48:22.320]  think it's so negative I think your future is so bright and I meet young
[3:48:22.320 --> 3:48:28.480]  people again and again and again you are so talented you are so talented don't
[3:48:28.480 --> 3:48:32.840]  let anybody discourage you we are blessed to have you and you have a very
[3:48:32.840 --> 3:48:36.240]  bright future well you're right I need to focus more on the positive I want
[3:48:36.240 --> 3:48:39.720]  people also know how bad the globalist are they're gonna really hurt us bad so
[3:48:39.720 --> 3:48:43.360]  we reject them but there's also so much good in the universe it's just that we
[3:48:43.360 --> 3:48:47.320]  have to really expo because sometimes it seems mean to really expose Bill Gates
[3:48:47.320 --> 3:48:51.600]  the new world order and Klaus Schwab and GZ ping but they're really bad people
[3:48:51.600 --> 3:48:54.160]  and I think they've been exposed but that's the positive point that we're
[3:48:54.160 --> 3:48:57.800]  still on there to be exposing them amen and there is so much good so many good
[3:48:57.800 --> 3:49:01.520]  people out there I'm sure you see all the time to Alex as you travel America is
[3:49:01.520 --> 3:49:05.960]  just filled with wonderful people and we have a bright future
[3:49:05.960 --> 3:49:09.400]  Drew Mason thank you so much great having you here and you did a great job on
[3:49:09.400 --> 3:49:12.840]  my show when we were live again this is a tape to air so it'll be airing here in

[3:49:20.760 --> 3:49:23.960]  videos up they'll share with everybody you know and send it to leftist you know
[3:49:23.960 --> 3:49:26.880]  because the leftists now admit they're not atheist they're almost all now
[3:49:26.880 --> 3:49:29.800]  admitting their Satanist they have national documentaries out admitting
[3:49:29.800 --> 3:49:33.760]  the Democratic Party's new mascots the devil and Joe Biden just canceled the
[3:49:33.760 --> 3:49:37.360]  National Day of Prayer all right folks that's it for this transmission stay
[3:49:37.360 --> 3:49:58.080]  with us we'll be right back
