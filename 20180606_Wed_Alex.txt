[00:00.000 --> 00:28.140]  It is Wednesday, June 6, 2018.
[00:28.140 --> 00:29.980]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[00:29.980 --> 00:35.920]  Coming in for Alex, I am Owen Troyer and I've got stacks and stacks, and stacks, and stacks,
[00:35.920 --> 00:36.920]  and stacks of news.
[00:36.920 --> 00:39.640]  Let's get a doc game of all this news here.
[00:39.640 --> 00:48.040]  I also have an announcement that I'm going to make in the next segment for an event coming
[00:48.040 --> 00:54.840]  right here to Austin, Texas that we will be hosting, well, let's say a counter event
[00:54.840 --> 00:58.600]  that we will be hosting that we're going to announce in the next segment in case you haven't
[00:58.600 --> 01:01.320]  heard about that.
[01:01.320 --> 01:08.400]  But before I get to all that in the next segment with all the news, with my guest, Jeff Gonzalez,
[01:08.400 --> 01:17.400]  Navy Seal, who is now the president of Trident Concepts, he's going to be joining me in studio.
[01:17.400 --> 01:27.240]  And when he's with me, I'm going to open up the phone lines specifically to liberals
[01:27.240 --> 01:29.260]  with a question for them.
[01:29.260 --> 01:34.000]  So we're going to see how that goes if they have the courage and spine to call in.
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.040]  So again, like I said, stacks of news, liberals ruin everything news, apocalypse news, Trump
[01:40.040 --> 01:46.600]  news, primary election results last night news, Obama corruption, deep state corruption
[01:46.600 --> 01:47.800]  news.
[01:47.800 --> 01:52.600]  The Democrats may have an actual hopeful for 2020 news, all that and more.
[01:52.600 --> 01:56.360]  But I want to start with this that I didn't get to it yesterday and it's very important.
[01:56.360 --> 01:58.960]  This is body cam footage.
[01:58.960 --> 02:07.600]  A young man, I believe 19, went into forest high school and shot a sawed off shotgun.
[02:07.600 --> 02:13.960]  He was had tactical gear on body armor, a backpack full of other weaponry.
[02:13.960 --> 02:18.120]  And he went in shot through a door, hit a kid and then decided to give himself up.
[02:18.120 --> 02:19.440]  Police have the body cam footage.
[02:19.440 --> 02:20.840]  They just released it.
[02:20.840 --> 02:24.560]  But there's a couple moments from this exchange.
[02:24.560 --> 02:26.840]  And these are just a couple moments that we picked out.
[02:26.840 --> 02:27.960]  There's other similar moments.
[02:27.960 --> 02:35.120]  But I just want to focus on these that raise the issue, the real issues when it comes to
[02:35.120 --> 02:36.120]  school shooting.
[02:36.120 --> 02:38.000]  So let's go to this body cam footage.
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.080]  This is a attempted mass shooter who essentially just gave himself up, I guess, after shooting
[02:44.080 --> 02:51.360]  through the door cops were on him immediately, unlike in Broward, excuse me, Broward County.
[02:51.360 --> 02:55.560]  According to what the young man says when he is speaking to the police officer.
[02:55.560 --> 02:58.840]  The kid you shot, was he a random kid or shot through the door?
[02:58.840 --> 03:04.160]  I didn't know he'd even work, that's why I was scared to keep an eye on him, I didn't
[03:04.160 --> 03:05.160]  even notice.
[03:05.160 --> 03:09.160]  You know that doesn't make any sense, right?
[03:09.160 --> 03:14.040]  What sense does that make to you?
[03:14.040 --> 03:19.560]  Sorry to understand, you haven't gone through mental illness, you've gone up in piles.
[03:19.560 --> 03:23.440]  Haven't gone through mental illness, you've gone up in piles, you haven't gone through
[03:23.440 --> 03:24.440]  mental illness, he says.
[03:24.440 --> 03:28.440]  Everyone in my family is either bipolar or schizophrenic, okay, are you bipolar or schizophrenic?
[03:28.440 --> 03:37.000]  I've been to a mental hospital once and they told me I was fine, they just took medication.
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.560]  Anxiety meds, that was it, they said I was fine, they gave me pills and let me go, I
[03:41.560 --> 03:42.560]  was said I was fine.
[03:42.560 --> 03:46.560]  So you feel like you're messed up, aside from today's events?
[03:46.560 --> 03:51.560]  Sometimes, you know, I just don't feel anything, it's just hard to describe, just don't
[03:51.560 --> 03:52.560]  believe me.
[03:52.560 --> 03:54.560]  People kind of think you got your money.
[03:54.560 --> 03:57.560]  Now listen to this like I was saying.
[03:57.560 --> 04:02.560]  You're right here, rewind it five seconds till it's full counter, he comes up and he
[04:02.560 --> 04:06.440]  says, so you've been planning this, this is the officer speaking to the shooter here,
[04:06.440 --> 04:12.560]  he says, so you've been planning this since 2013, go ahead and roll it.
[04:12.560 --> 04:32.000]  Okay, so what are the two key takeaways from this?
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.480]  The guy says he had mental problems, he was on medication, anxiety pills, again, big pharmaceutical,
[04:39.480 --> 04:40.480]  what we talk about.
[04:40.480 --> 04:44.960]  Then the police officer says 2013 you've been planning this, so he's been planning it.
[04:44.960 --> 04:45.960]  How did they know that?
[04:45.960 --> 04:47.560]  Was it social media activity?
[04:47.560 --> 04:51.080]  But you notice how we don't talk about any of this after the shooting, we always just
[04:51.080 --> 04:52.800]  blame the guns.
[04:52.800 --> 04:56.880]  That's not the debate that comes first, that's the debate that comes after 10 debates before
[04:56.880 --> 05:26.840]  that.
[05:26.840 --> 05:52.840]  And that's it for today's video, I hope you enjoyed it, I'll see you in the next one.
[05:52.840 --> 06:21.680]  Have a great day, have a great day, and I'll see you in the next video.
[06:21.680 --> 06:27.840]  Quick times to be alive here on this Wednesday, June 6th, 2018.
[06:27.840 --> 06:36.240]  Now I have all of this news that I am going to get to today, I mean literally I think
[06:36.240 --> 06:43.320]  I have 12 stacks of news in front of me, all is important for a different reason, whether
[06:43.320 --> 06:51.160]  it be the deep state and Obama being exposed, McCabe looking to reach a deal, whether it
[06:51.160 --> 06:58.960]  be climate change failing for a policy issue anymore, whether it be liberals ruining Hollywood,
[06:58.960 --> 07:02.960]  whether it be signs of the apocalypse, whether it be what the Democrats are going to do in
[07:02.960 --> 07:10.120]  the 2020 election, whether it be the latest news on Trump, the North Korea summit, how
[07:10.120 --> 07:15.600]  about the primary election results last night that I've got stacks of news on?
[07:15.600 --> 07:28.360]  It's all ahead today, including Jeff Gonzalez, US Navy SEAL, President of Trident Concepts,
[07:28.360 --> 07:31.720]  and the Director of Training here at the range in Austin, a great gun range, he's going to
[07:31.720 --> 07:37.200]  be joining me in studio in the second hour, at which point I will be opening up the phone
[07:37.200 --> 07:40.920]  lines for liberals to call in.
[07:40.920 --> 07:51.320]  My challenge to you is this, tell me Barack Hussein Obama's accomplishments as President
[07:51.320 --> 07:54.320]  of the United States.
[07:54.320 --> 08:00.320]  So I will be opening up the phone line, specifically I want liberals to call in, Obama supporters
[08:00.320 --> 08:04.840]  to call in and give me all of Obama's accomplishments.
[08:04.840 --> 08:09.200]  We've been touting Trump's accomplishments, we'll tout a few more here today on the air,
[08:09.200 --> 08:13.000]  but I'd like to hear the case for Obama's accomplishments, what did he accomplish?
[08:13.000 --> 08:19.280]  So we'll be opening up the phone lines, hopefully hearing from liberals on that subject.
[08:19.280 --> 08:26.800]  Now in the opening segment, I played a body cam video from a police officer that, well
[08:26.800 --> 08:33.200]  they stopped a potential mass school shooting, a kid shoots a shotgun through a door, hits
[08:33.200 --> 08:37.880]  a kid, fortunately that was all of the damage that was done.
[08:37.880 --> 08:44.920]  But in that video that I played in the last segment, he talks about being on pharmaceutical
[08:44.920 --> 08:49.040]  drugs, he talks about having mental health issues, and the police officers say that he's
[08:49.040 --> 08:53.640]  been planning that since 2013 and he says, yeah, I know you know that.
[08:53.640 --> 09:03.080]  So look at this, now you have a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the Florida School Shooting
[09:03.080 --> 09:07.960]  Security Guard, talks about all the signs they had of crews, right, we already knew
[09:07.960 --> 09:14.320]  all that, but it's even worse than we originally thought, swastikas on his bags, 666 symbols
[09:14.320 --> 09:24.320]  on my bags, on his bags, he has, the school has to host meetings to literally talk about
[09:24.320 --> 09:36.080]  him being a threat to have a school shooting, and still they did everything they could to
[09:36.080 --> 09:41.480]  keep him from having a criminal record along with the Democrat legislation, what was it
[09:41.480 --> 09:46.200]  called, the PROMIS Act I think or something, does anybody remember the name of that?
[09:46.200 --> 09:53.480]  Back there, let me know if you remember, so then he's able to get a firearm.
[09:53.480 --> 09:57.360]  And then you hear this most recent video, he talks about the pharmaceutical pills, he
[09:57.360 --> 10:04.720]  talks about the mental health issues, so we've got all of these issues when it comes to these
[10:04.720 --> 10:10.360]  school shootings, there is the list of psych meds and school shootings, just add another
[10:10.360 --> 10:17.160]  one to it, they're all on there, and yet why do we always go to guns?
[10:17.160 --> 10:24.960]  Well we know why, because it's an agenda to take the firearms, you cannot have a free
[10:24.960 --> 10:32.640]  sovereign country when the citizens are armed, period, that's all it comes to.
[10:32.640 --> 10:42.000]  And so I'm sure that Jeff Gonzalez, Navy SEAL president of Trident Concepts, will be more
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.960]  than happy to talk about that issue with me when he joins me in studio.
[10:45.960 --> 10:52.640]  So that's everything you have to look forward to today, and it's really just incredible
[10:52.640 --> 11:04.520]  actually this, what we're seeing right now in the media, where first last week it was
[11:04.520 --> 11:09.080]  they admit that they spied on President Trump, FBI admits it, clapper admits it, we have
[11:09.080 --> 11:15.440]  all the documents, they were spying on Trump, now we know as early as at least confirmed
[11:15.440 --> 11:19.880]  July 2015, but then what does the media say?
[11:19.880 --> 11:24.960]  There was no spying, why are you reporting fake news that Obama was spying on Trump,
[11:24.960 --> 11:29.840]  there was no spying, and it's like we know that they spied, we have the declassified
[11:29.840 --> 11:33.520]  documents, we have the FBI admitting it, we have clapper admitting it, we have the New
[11:33.520 --> 11:39.600]  York Times actually was the first to report it, and they say there was no spying, Democrat
[11:39.600 --> 11:43.040]  officials, Democrat representatives like Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, who by the
[11:43.040 --> 11:48.160]  way look like they're gonna get reelected based on the primary results last night, shocking
[11:48.160 --> 11:53.160]  that a couple morons like that can keep winning, I'll delve into those numbers as well, a lot
[11:53.160 --> 11:59.720]  of weird anomalies there, but they said no, there was no spying on Trump, what are you
[11:59.720 --> 12:00.720]  talking about?
[12:00.720 --> 12:04.720]  And then it's just like, well we know that they were spying on Trump, so why are you
[12:04.720 --> 12:05.720]  saying it?
[12:05.720 --> 12:13.000]  So now this week the new thing is they come out and they say, where is Melania Trump?
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.200]  What is going on with Melania?
[12:14.200 --> 12:15.200]  Is she hiding?
[12:15.200 --> 12:18.080]  Is Trump abusing her?
[12:18.080 --> 12:19.080]  Is she alive?
[12:19.080 --> 12:20.080]  Does she have health concerns?
[12:20.080 --> 12:21.080]  Where is Melania?
[12:21.080 --> 12:26.600]  And they all cover it, and the CNN has a whole segment with the whole calendar, where is
[12:26.600 --> 12:27.600]  Melania?
[12:27.600 --> 12:32.320]  A panel discussion, multiple segments, guests, experts.
[12:32.320 --> 12:38.360]  And then Melania comes out, gives a speech, sends out a tweet and says I'm fine, nothing
[12:38.360 --> 12:42.920]  to see here, Trump says I'm fine, she's fine, nothing to see here, desperate media trying
[12:42.920 --> 12:44.160]  to report on something.
[12:44.160 --> 12:48.720]  And then Brian Stelter, guys pull this up, I tweeted it out from the war room, Brian
[12:48.720 --> 12:56.040]  Stelter goes on Twitter and says, how dare the President Trump say that media outlets
[12:56.040 --> 13:01.440]  are talking and theorizing about Melania's health, how dare he?
[13:01.440 --> 13:10.040]  And you're like, Brian, your own network had multiple entire segments contemplating
[13:10.040 --> 13:18.640]  Melania Trump's health and location, and you're just like, how did we get to this point?
[13:18.640 --> 13:30.640]  Mass insanity, mass stupidity, but I'll tell you what, we have a solution to this.
[13:30.640 --> 13:32.360]  We have a solution to this.
[13:32.360 --> 13:37.080]  When these people come to your town, you have to bullhorn them.
[13:37.080 --> 13:43.760]  And so that's what we're going to do this Sunday to Bill Clinton, whose book tour is
[13:43.760 --> 13:49.960]  coming to Bass Concert Hall here in Austin, Texas this Sunday at 7.30.
[13:49.960 --> 13:54.760]  Now we are live on the Alex Jones show from four to six, I'll be live here in studio from
[13:54.760 --> 13:58.440]  Austin, Texas, the Info Wars World Headquarters.
[13:58.440 --> 14:03.560]  When that concludes, I'll be going to Bass Concert Hall, where we'll already have a stream
[14:03.560 --> 14:11.120]  set up, ready to go for our hashtag me to protest of Bill Clinton, his speaking event
[14:11.120 --> 14:18.160]  at Austin, Texas this Sunday, June 10th at 6 p.m. central in at Bass Concert Hall here
[14:18.160 --> 14:19.400]  in Austin, Texas.
[14:19.400 --> 14:23.080]  So the left gets to have all their me to marches.
[14:23.080 --> 14:29.960]  The left gets to do all of their virtue signaling for victims of toxic masculinity.
[14:29.960 --> 14:32.840]  So do we get to have ours against Bill Clinton?
[14:32.840 --> 14:41.120]  Yes, yes we do, and yes we will this Sunday, June 10th at 6 p.m. central outside Bass Concert
[14:41.120 --> 14:44.800]  Hall here in Austin, Texas.
[14:44.800 --> 14:53.000]  Now the last time I went out to go, I went to the ACLU protest of Trump this weekend,
[14:53.000 --> 15:00.680]  you saw the footage in the Alex Jones channel on YouTube and it got a little tense for me.
[15:00.680 --> 15:05.800]  And it was the first time ever where I lost my patience with somebody.
[15:05.800 --> 15:11.560]  Now granted that somebody was shoving up against our female reporter, and this was after we'd
[15:11.560 --> 15:16.280]  already been spat at and cursed at and everything, and I'd been in the sun already at two protests.
[15:16.280 --> 15:20.840]  But the point is, I'm like, I don't even know if I can go to these things anymore, it's
[15:20.840 --> 15:25.880]  starting to reach ahead, but I'll be out there this Sunday, June 10th at 6 p.m. central,
[15:25.880 --> 15:30.120]  the hashtag me to protest of Bill Clinton's book tour in Austin, Texas outside Bass Concert
[15:30.120 --> 15:33.400]  Hall, and we'll see what happens, I mean I don't know how much support Bill Clinton
[15:33.400 --> 15:36.200]  really has anymore, so I don't really know if you'll have any Bill Clinton supporters
[15:36.200 --> 15:39.760]  there, but we'll be protesting him, we're not going to let the me to movement leave
[15:39.760 --> 15:44.640]  Bill Clinton out, and we're not going to let the left take responsibility for that either.
[15:44.640 --> 15:49.440]  We called out Bill Clinton, we printed the Bill Clinton rape shirts, we had the Bill
[15:49.440 --> 15:55.120]  Clinton rape whistles, that was us, that wasn't CBS News that gives him one hard interview
[15:55.120 --> 15:59.160]  in 20 years, give me a break.
[15:59.160 --> 16:02.480]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[16:02.480 --> 16:07.560]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best, get a sunny bay heating pad.
[16:07.560 --> 16:12.560]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[16:12.560 --> 16:15.840]  And the best relief for that pain is a sunny bay heating pad.
[16:15.840 --> 16:19.680]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways
[16:19.680 --> 16:22.240]  to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[16:22.240 --> 16:27.040]  Sunny bay heating pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work,
[16:27.040 --> 16:31.680]  and have a lifetime 100% positive rating on both Amazon and Etsy.
[16:31.680 --> 16:33.200]  Why take another pill?
[16:33.200 --> 16:37.440]  Many people use our sunny bay heating pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[16:37.440 --> 16:42.120]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.
[16:42.120 --> 16:46.120]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us, that's why we design
[16:46.120 --> 16:50.520]  and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce them to the public.
[16:50.520 --> 16:55.600]  You can easily find sunny bay heating pads on Amazon, just go to Amazon.com and search
[16:55.600 --> 16:59.920]  for sunny bay heating pads.
[16:59.920 --> 17:03.480]  It's a very confusing time in the financial markets, and nobody knows that better than
[17:03.480 --> 17:05.640]  financial markets analyst Doug Casey.
[17:05.640 --> 17:09.720]  Casey Research wants to send you a free copy of Doug's controversial new book about the
[17:09.720 --> 17:12.880]  stock market, our economy, and American politics.
[17:12.880 --> 17:15.720]  Warning, this book is not politically correct.
[17:15.720 --> 17:18.600]  Casey is known for his outspoken and brutally honest views.
[17:18.600 --> 17:21.240]  He once called global warming a political scam.
[17:21.240 --> 17:25.480]  He's made millions betting on investments seen as too controversial by the mainstream.
[17:25.480 --> 17:29.760]  In this new book, Casey reveals shocking predictions about hot issues like immigration,
[17:29.760 --> 17:31.760]  Russia, and the next stock super boom.

[18:30.920 --> 18:35.360]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,

[18:57.280 --> 19:00.280]  Check it out right now at infoorstore.com.
[19:00.280 --> 19:05.520]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[19:05.520 --> 19:10.840]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[19:10.840 --> 19:17.560]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[19:17.560 --> 19:23.400]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[19:23.400 --> 19:26.720]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[19:26.720 --> 19:31.360]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[19:31.360 --> 19:36.720]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[19:36.720 --> 19:37.720]  symptoms.
[19:37.720 --> 19:41.520]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[19:41.520 --> 19:46.280]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[19:46.280 --> 19:52.080]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[19:52.080 --> 19:54.760]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[19:54.760 --> 20:03.960]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[20:03.960 --> 20:21.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:21.400 --> 20:28.880]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[20:28.880 --> 20:35.640]  I'm calling on all info warriors from Houston, from Dallas, from San Antonio, and beyond
[20:35.640 --> 20:40.600]  to come out to the Me Too protest of Bill Clinton this Sunday, Sunday, Sunday outside
[20:40.600 --> 20:46.320]  of Bass Concert Hall in Austin, Texas at 6 p.m. Central.
[20:46.320 --> 20:54.360]  You had the Me Too movement get sparked by the political left in America and the Hollywood
[20:54.360 --> 21:01.400]  left in America, where sexual assault and abuse is apparently the most rampant with
[21:01.400 --> 21:08.680]  the Harvey Weinstein's and the Bill Clinton's, the Roman Polanski's, oh yes, the Anthony
[21:08.680 --> 21:12.760]  Weiner's, oh sure.
[21:12.760 --> 21:17.120]  I guess if you're just into artwork, you could consider the Podesta's there.
[21:17.120 --> 21:21.120]  Just their artwork, though, that they're into.
[21:21.120 --> 21:24.400]  So this Sunday, we're protesting Bill Clinton's book tour.
[21:24.400 --> 21:27.080]  How can these people even sell books anymore?
[21:27.080 --> 21:33.160]  You know, Bill Clinton was at some sort of promo event pushing a kid on a swing and I'm
[21:33.160 --> 21:39.480]  watching this footage and I'm like, I wouldn't let my kid anywhere near that scumbag.
[21:39.480 --> 21:41.880]  I know where those hands have been.
[21:41.880 --> 21:54.880]  It's like, just weird that a guy like Bill Clinton can just go around like he's a normal
[21:54.880 --> 21:57.440]  everyday Joe, president of the United States.
[21:57.440 --> 22:06.600]  No, the guy was an outright criminal and you know, lest we forget, I mean, let's actually
[22:06.600 --> 22:12.320]  remind ourselves what happened when Bill Clinton was president to Hillary Clinton.
[22:12.320 --> 22:20.240]  Hillary Clinton is the most abused woman in the history of American politics.
[22:20.240 --> 22:24.840]  Bill Clinton cheats on her all day long and everyone knows it.
[22:24.840 --> 22:26.320]  It's a joke.
[22:26.320 --> 22:33.040]  But they say, look Hillary, don't talk about the abuse.
[22:33.040 --> 22:35.960]  Don't talk about the rape.
[22:35.960 --> 22:38.400]  See the accusers.
[22:38.400 --> 22:40.920]  Let's maintain the status quo here.
[22:40.920 --> 22:45.040]  When it's all said and done, you'll get your turn in office.
[22:45.040 --> 22:48.520]  We'll give you the presidency.
[22:48.520 --> 22:50.480]  And so it all comes to fruition.
[22:50.480 --> 22:51.640]  It's Hillary's time.
[22:51.640 --> 22:53.120]  They're going to give it to Hillary.
[22:53.120 --> 22:56.080]  They trot out a corpse.
[22:56.080 --> 23:07.920]  They trot out an animate husk of a human being, Hillary Clinton.
[23:07.920 --> 23:15.280]  And that's how rigged and pathetic American politics had become.
[23:15.280 --> 23:22.960]  Such a sideshow, such a circus act, such a rigged deal that the powers that be would
[23:22.960 --> 23:30.280]  give it to Hillary Clinton, who at this point can't even walk around without a bat brace
[23:30.280 --> 23:38.000]  because she's so spineless.
[23:38.000 --> 23:44.400]  And that's how bad it almost was.
[23:44.400 --> 23:47.440]  So Bill Clinton comes to Austin, Texas this Sunday for his book tour.
[23:47.440 --> 23:49.080]  We're protesting it.
[23:49.080 --> 23:50.480]  But it's the Me Too protest.
[23:50.480 --> 23:53.080]  So I'm sure we'll get a bunch of Soros money.
[23:53.080 --> 23:58.080]  Oh, the Soros money is going to start raining from the sky because it's a Me Too protest,
[23:58.080 --> 23:59.080]  right?
[23:59.080 --> 24:03.280]  Oh, it's calling out Bill Clinton, so it doesn't count.
[24:03.280 --> 24:04.280]  It doesn't count.
[24:04.280 --> 24:05.760]  Well, it counts to us.
[24:05.760 --> 24:11.020]  So I hope you can join us this Sunday, 6 p.m. central outside Bass Concert Hall.
[24:11.020 --> 24:14.880]  We need to show these people where they really stand.
[24:14.880 --> 24:15.880]  You know what?
[24:15.880 --> 24:18.240]  And so that is going to take me to this.
[24:18.240 --> 24:23.480]  I've got the election results here.
[24:23.480 --> 24:24.480]  All of it.
[24:24.480 --> 24:26.680]  I mean, there's so many.
[24:26.680 --> 24:28.640]  It's honestly overwhelming.
[24:28.640 --> 24:32.800]  But there's some stuff in here that is quite shocking to me, quite revealing to me.
[24:32.800 --> 24:39.400]  Now, in the overall aggregate, if you take a look, and guys, I'm citing the L.A. Times
[24:39.400 --> 24:40.400]  live results page here.
[24:40.400 --> 24:43.160]  So if you're trying to catch up with me, that's where I'm at.
[24:43.160 --> 24:50.920]  If you look at the overall map of California and the results from last night, you notice
[24:50.920 --> 24:51.920]  a trend.
[24:51.920 --> 24:53.560]  Ah, yes, there's the screen right there.
[24:53.560 --> 24:59.240]  Now, notice how most of the state of California now is actually red.
[24:59.240 --> 25:06.120]  Now, this is a phenomenon that occurs every election cycle in Illinois, in Missouri, in
[25:06.120 --> 25:17.680]  Pennsylvania, in Ohio, in Texas, too, where almost the entire state is red, except the
[25:17.680 --> 25:26.400]  main cities, the main big cities in that area.
[25:26.400 --> 25:31.920]  And so you look at some of the numbers, and I do expect Gavin Newsom to be the next governor,
[25:31.920 --> 25:36.000]  but I do think John Cox will give him a run for his money, at least more than people expected.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.640]  But notice how even the state of California now is mostly red.
[25:41.640 --> 25:43.520]  So this is how the Democrats stay in power.
[25:43.520 --> 25:49.000]  They have voter blocks in the inner cities that rely on welfare or even came here illegally.
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.520]  And then you have this strange story that has no answer where hundreds of thousands
[25:54.520 --> 25:58.440]  of people aren't on the voter rolls or something, and they can't vote.
[25:58.440 --> 26:02.800]  The whole story is very ambiguous, and I'm just scratching my head, and I'm thinking,
[26:02.800 --> 26:05.720]  is this what they're doing to get illegals to vote?
[26:05.720 --> 26:09.200]  They're just saying, oh, major malfunction, we're going to register you right here at
[26:09.200 --> 26:11.400]  the scene.
[26:11.400 --> 26:17.000]  Certainly what it feels like, regardless, though, if these are the results you get in
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.680]  California, a blue wave, you have not.
[26:20.680 --> 26:24.960]  But there is some interesting stuff in here as far as the results are concerned.
[26:24.960 --> 26:29.840]  So just bear with me as I flip through all these results and get to my points of interest
[26:29.840 --> 26:35.800]  again, I already gave you the number one, which was the state of California is now going
[26:35.800 --> 26:42.640]  red, and you're seeing the Democrat voter block phenomenon of the big cities start to
[26:42.640 --> 26:46.400]  play out now in California.
[26:46.400 --> 26:54.440]  Nancy Pelosi has a strong victory with 69% of the vote.
[26:54.440 --> 26:57.960]  Nancy Pelosi, folks.
[26:57.960 --> 27:06.320]  A dingbat, so dumb, so corrupt, so disgusting.
[27:06.320 --> 27:10.200]  How in the hell does a woman like that win election after election after election?
[27:10.200 --> 27:13.440]  I mean, let's be real.
[27:13.440 --> 27:19.080]  Slightly less offensive, Eric Swalwell looks to be remaining strong in District 15.
[27:19.080 --> 27:27.000]  That total nitwit, it's like depressing to just remind yourself that these people are
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.000]  still in government.
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.480]  Eric Swalwell, apparently more popular than Devin Nunes, who's like an American patriot
[27:34.480 --> 27:35.480]  hero.
[27:35.480 --> 27:38.720]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[27:38.720 --> 27:41.520]  But Nunes should be safe.
[27:41.520 --> 27:45.000]  Adam Schiff, strong.
[27:45.000 --> 27:52.640]  Adam Schiff, little, little Adam Schiff with a D. Unbelievable that a guy like that's popular.
[27:52.640 --> 27:59.120]  I mean, it's, I'm telling you, it's depressing to know that somebody that stupid, that ignorant,
[27:59.120 --> 28:03.240]  could actually continue to win elections.
[28:03.240 --> 28:06.880]  Aja Smith, she had, she actually, she just automatically won.
[28:06.880 --> 28:07.880]  There wasn't enough people.
[28:07.880 --> 28:08.880]  Oh, here you go.
[28:08.880 --> 28:11.440]  That's a good one, by the way.
[28:11.440 --> 28:16.840]  Maxine Waters, Maxine Waters.
[28:16.840 --> 28:24.640]  How does Maxine Waters get 10 people to show up at an event in Hawthorne, California, right
[28:24.640 --> 28:30.360]  there in District 43, 10 people to show up for a widely publicized and promoted event?
[28:30.360 --> 28:37.080]  She gets 10 people to show up, somehow magically gets 42,000 to show up to vote.
[28:37.080 --> 28:38.080]  I'm sorry.
[28:38.080 --> 28:39.080]  I'm not buying it.
[28:39.080 --> 28:42.120]  There's some, this ain't right, man.
[28:42.120 --> 28:49.000]  Maxine Waters gets 10 people, half of which aren't even voting age, to show up in an event.
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.480]  10 people and she gets 42,000 to vote.
[28:52.480 --> 28:55.880]  What kind of backwards country am I living in here?
[28:55.880 --> 28:59.520]  She should be Maxine Waters.
[28:59.520 --> 29:03.280]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[29:03.280 --> 29:08.040]  What if I told you for just 54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally

[29:29.240 --> 29:31.400]  You have been lied to.
[29:31.400 --> 29:33.000]  My name is Kevin Ship.
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.880]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[29:35.880 --> 29:39.920]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow
[29:39.920 --> 29:40.920]  government ever.
[29:40.920 --> 29:46.440]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[29:46.440 --> 29:49.680]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people
[29:49.680 --> 29:50.680]  are.
[29:50.680 --> 29:53.680]  This is critical to get, to read, to give them a library, to give them a church, to get

[33:03.600 --> 33:18.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:18.840 --> 33:28.400]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[33:28.400 --> 33:35.520]  We stand to honor our military and to honor our country and to remember the fallen heroes
[33:35.520 --> 33:38.240]  who never made it back home.
[33:38.240 --> 33:46.080]  We stand to show our love for our fellow citizens and our magnificent Constitution.
[33:46.080 --> 33:52.720]  We stand to pay tribute to the incredible Americans who came before us and the heroic
[33:52.720 --> 33:56.640]  sacrifices they made.
[33:56.640 --> 34:03.280]  America is a great nation, a community, a family, and America is our home, and we love
[34:03.280 --> 34:04.720]  our home.
[34:04.720 --> 34:10.880]  So that was President Trump yesterday holding a salute to America, pro-America event, lot
[34:10.880 --> 34:18.600]  of veterans there, Navy there, etc., families, instead of what the Eagles turned into a political
[34:18.600 --> 34:23.960]  stunt and a protest of President Trump by only sending 10 of potentially, I think it's
[34:23.960 --> 34:28.520]  like 80, 90, 100 people that would have gone normally.
[34:28.520 --> 34:34.640]  I believe the last time a Super Bowl champion visited the White House, they took 88 people,
[34:34.640 --> 34:37.200]  the Eagles were going to take 10.
[34:37.200 --> 34:42.640]  So President Trump says, well, I'm not going to waste my time with 10 of you, sorry to
[34:42.640 --> 34:47.440]  the players and staff that wanted to go, blaming the team for that, not me, instead I'm going
[34:47.440 --> 34:53.520]  to hold an event for dozens and dozens of veterans and active duty in military.
[34:53.520 --> 34:58.200]  They respect this country, I'd rather spend my time with them than a bunch of crybaby
[34:58.200 --> 35:02.840]  athletes that don't understand the tradition and significance of the White House visit.
[35:02.840 --> 35:06.920]  But that's fine, they don't have to go, it's perfectly within their rights, just like it's
[35:06.920 --> 35:10.760]  perfectly within Trump's rights to say, okay, fine then, I'll just hold a different event,
[35:10.760 --> 35:14.960]  I don't need your event, we'll do a better event.
[35:14.960 --> 35:20.760]  And of course, they twist it and blame Trump, oh, it's Trump's fault, well, let's be fair
[35:20.760 --> 35:23.280]  about this.
[35:23.280 --> 35:29.000]  While even myself, I think maybe, I won't say Trump went too far, but you can certainly
[35:29.000 --> 35:34.440]  see some reason for some of the backlash, but can you blame him?
[35:34.440 --> 35:45.360]  How many times did teams skip the presidential White House visit tradition when Obama was
[35:45.360 --> 35:47.360]  president?
[35:47.360 --> 35:52.360]  None, and Obama was trash.
[35:52.360 --> 35:58.000]  It comes out today, new details of the Iran deal, the Senate does an investigation, files
[35:58.000 --> 36:04.320]  the report, Obama officials gave Iran access to the U.S. financial system, oh, but they're
[36:04.320 --> 36:08.000]  gonna say, oh, it was just brief, we just did it part of the deal, it's just a one-time
[36:08.000 --> 36:13.840]  thing, oh, just a one-time thing, can I have your password to your ATM card, it's just
[36:13.840 --> 36:17.920]  a one-time thing, can I get your bank account information, it's just a brief thing, just
[36:17.920 --> 36:23.360]  a one-time thing, don't worry about it, baby, just a one-time thing.
[36:23.360 --> 36:29.360]  So Obama total trash, no one boycotts him, he's saluted as a hero, teams boycott the
[36:29.360 --> 36:33.960]  Trump White House visit, he's the bad guy for holding an event for veterans and active
[36:33.960 --> 36:37.440]  duty.
[36:37.440 --> 36:44.720]  Then you have, LeBron James gets asked a question, some liberal sports media reporter says, after
[36:44.720 --> 36:49.600]  the last basketball game says, LeBron, what do you think about Trump's comments about
[36:49.600 --> 36:52.760]  the Eagles not visiting the White House?
[36:52.760 --> 36:58.280]  And like a good brainwash Democrat, LeBron says, oh, well, you know, I don't expect anything
[36:58.280 --> 37:04.120]  different from a guy like that, and then, well, would you go to the White House?
[37:04.120 --> 37:08.280]  Won't matter because LeBron's not going to win, but he says, oh, well, it wouldn't matter,
[37:08.280 --> 37:10.520]  we wouldn't be going to the White House, I wouldn't be going to the White House, and
[37:10.520 --> 37:16.960]  I know that the Warriors wouldn't be going to the White House either, okay, now let's
[37:16.960 --> 37:19.640]  just understand something here.
[37:19.640 --> 37:38.560]  The NBA and the NFL is comprised of 90% African-American athletes, probably 90%, conservatively 80%.
[37:38.560 --> 37:44.680]  So they try to have this assumed narrative in the media, Trump racist, Trump bigot, Trump
[37:44.680 --> 37:50.360]  against black people, and so then it makes sense, there's the main black athlete saying,
[37:50.360 --> 37:55.360]  of course, I don't like Trump, I'm a good Democrat, Trump's a racist, we wouldn't visit
[37:55.360 --> 38:04.600]  that racist in the White House, but wait a second, look at the unemployment numbers
[38:04.600 --> 38:11.120]  for African-Americans, now, if you pull up a graph from the last 10 years, something
[38:11.120 --> 38:18.200]  stands out pretty much immediately, guys, can you pull up the graph I tweeted out last
[38:18.200 --> 38:24.600]  night from the war room show on Twitter, please, it's the African-American unemployment numbers.
[38:24.600 --> 38:31.720]  When Obama got in office, the African-American unemployment percentage was around 6%, within
[38:31.720 --> 38:39.120]  two years, it doubled, skyrocketed to 12%, where it then hovered for the next about two
[38:39.120 --> 38:44.600]  to three years, around 10% and 8% for the rest of the Obama administration.
[38:44.600 --> 38:46.600]  Trump gets in office, what happens?
[38:46.600 --> 38:57.920]  It goes down immediately, there it is right there, now, this is a different graph than
[38:57.920 --> 39:04.760]  the one I tweeted out from the war room on Twitter last night, but it's the same thing,
[39:04.760 --> 39:12.920]  and so you have to ask, why don't the Eagles want to have the traditional White House visit
[39:12.920 --> 39:14.720]  for the champions?
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.240]  Why wouldn't the NBA champion, either Cavaliers or Warriors, want to go to the White House
[39:20.240 --> 39:22.360]  to visit President Trump?
[39:22.360 --> 39:27.000]  Do they not want black people to attend their sporting events?
[39:27.000 --> 39:32.360]  Do they not like black people having jobs and making money like they are?
[39:32.360 --> 39:35.520]  Do they get to make millions and millions of dollars living the American dream?
[39:35.520 --> 39:39.880]  Do they not want other black Americans to have that same opportunity?
[39:39.880 --> 39:46.360]  I'm just confused as to why they're not going to the White House.
[39:46.360 --> 39:53.480]  Well, you know, I don't like the fact that he's, yeah, I know, they say that the graph
[39:53.480 --> 39:58.560]  is sensitive on Twitter, if you can believe that, from the labor force statistics official
[39:58.560 --> 40:01.760]  website, there it is, right there.
[40:01.760 --> 40:08.920]  So under Obama, it doubled, doubled in the first two years, where it remained for about
[40:08.920 --> 40:14.440]  two to three more, and then slowly kind of trickled back down and then took a nosedive
[40:14.440 --> 40:18.680]  as soon as Trump was elected.
[40:18.680 --> 40:24.360]  So those are just the facts.
[40:24.360 --> 40:27.600]  Why would they protest the White House visit?
[40:27.600 --> 40:30.000]  Well, Trump's a racist, obviously.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.280]  He likes the national anthem, didn't you hear?
[40:32.280 --> 40:34.800]  And so then you have, guys, let's go to this clip right now.
[40:34.800 --> 40:41.760]  Let's go to clip seven, CNN commentator Angela Rye, this woman, well, I don't know if I'll
[40:41.760 --> 40:42.880]  be able to make it through this.
[40:42.880 --> 40:45.400]  This woman really aggravates me.
[40:45.400 --> 40:48.240]  Listen to what she says about the national anthem.
[40:48.240 --> 40:50.160]  You know, it's just this honest, right?
[40:50.160 --> 40:53.920]  This isn't about people who disagree with the partisan leanings of the president.
[40:53.920 --> 40:55.720]  There are Republicans who are my friends.
[40:55.720 --> 41:00.960]  This is about someone who has trafficked in bigotry, xenophobia, and racism from the
[41:00.960 --> 41:03.600]  beginning of his campaign.
[41:03.600 --> 41:07.200]  Everybody has a right to say, you know what, I disagree with you, and I especially disagree
[41:07.200 --> 41:09.320]  with how you carry yourself as a leader.
[41:09.320 --> 41:12.160]  I have yet to see you demonstrate real leadership.
[41:12.160 --> 41:14.520]  This is not about the national anthem.
[41:14.520 --> 41:15.520]  That's the side issue.
[41:15.520 --> 41:19.160]  The real issue is Donald Trump's issue with crowd size.
[41:19.160 --> 41:24.240]  This crowd would be the same size as his inauguration, and that's what he's really frustrated about.
[41:24.240 --> 41:26.240]  Let's be really, really honest here.
[41:26.240 --> 41:28.440]  You haven't been honest since you opened your mouth.
[41:28.440 --> 41:32.600]  Instead of having people around him that are not yes men and yes women and yes people,
[41:32.600 --> 41:35.400]  he has people that continue to lie on his behalf.
[41:35.400 --> 41:37.280]  The Eagles didn't volunteer not to go.
[41:37.280 --> 41:39.160]  They uninvited the Eagles.
[41:39.160 --> 41:40.160]  That's the issue.
[41:40.160 --> 41:41.160]  This is all about the Eagles.
[41:41.160 --> 41:42.160]  What do you mean?
[41:42.160 --> 41:43.160]  Turn it down.
[41:43.160 --> 41:47.000]  See this is what I'm talking about.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.960]  I could break down everything she says in that little minute and a half clip, literally
[41:50.960 --> 41:56.840]  break down everything she says, and it's totally a lie.
[41:56.840 --> 42:00.960]  Literally, I could take each little thing that she says and break it down, and it's
[42:00.960 --> 42:03.440]  a total lie.
[42:03.440 --> 42:05.720]  But this is what they do.
[42:05.720 --> 42:10.320]  Jennifer Rubin from the Washington Post, Sarah Sanders lies because this is what the White
[42:10.320 --> 42:11.320]  House does.
[42:11.320 --> 42:15.720]  Jennifer Rubin, you are fake news.
[42:15.720 --> 42:19.200]  Angela Rye, you are fake news.
[42:19.200 --> 42:21.440]  These people lie all day long.
[42:21.440 --> 42:24.120]  Did you hear what she says?
[42:24.120 --> 42:26.560]  Trump traffics and racism and bigotry?
[42:26.560 --> 42:28.360]  What the hell does that even mean?
[42:28.360 --> 42:33.440]  Hey, I'll trade you a little racism for a little bigotry over here.
[42:33.440 --> 42:34.440]  Oh, yeah, I like that.
[42:34.440 --> 42:37.960]  Let me get a little bit of that homophobia in there, too.
[42:37.960 --> 42:38.960]  Oh, yeah, you like that.
[42:38.960 --> 42:40.800]  I got a little Islamophobia there for you, too.
[42:40.800 --> 42:41.800]  You want a little bit of that?
[42:41.800 --> 42:42.800]  What about a little misogyny?
[42:42.800 --> 42:46.600]  Oh, oh, put a little misogyny on that with that bigotry, too.
[42:46.600 --> 42:49.040]  Are you ready to make a deal?
[42:49.040 --> 42:56.040]  Living in bigotry and racism, says Angela Rye, a nitwit, a zero, a 5-watt light bulb
[42:56.040 --> 42:59.600]  that couldn't light a refrigerator on CNN.
[42:59.600 --> 43:03.440]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[43:03.440 --> 43:07.960]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[43:07.960 --> 43:13.400]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[43:13.400 --> 43:18.760]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[43:18.760 --> 43:20.300]  to unhealthy levels.
[43:20.300 --> 43:26.800]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[43:26.800 --> 43:30.800]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[43:30.800 --> 43:32.200]  in the rainwater.
[43:32.200 --> 43:37.520]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexapure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[43:37.520 --> 43:43.600]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[43:43.600 --> 43:49.240]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexapure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[43:49.240 --> 43:54.560]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[43:54.560 --> 43:59.600]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[43:59.600 --> 44:04.480]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[44:04.480 --> 44:08.920]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all
[44:08.920 --> 44:14.000]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[44:14.000 --> 44:19.200]  That's why Infowars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula, the new platinum

[45:05.080 --> 45:06.080]  You're on the air worldwide.
[45:06.080 --> 45:07.080]  Thanks for holding.
[45:07.080 --> 45:08.080]  Hey, Alex, mate.
[45:08.080 --> 45:11.400]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[45:11.400 --> 45:16.640]  I remember back when Infowars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and
[45:16.640 --> 45:20.880]  I had to load down the page on my dial-up into there, and I thought it was pretty cool,
[45:20.880 --> 45:25.040]  and read all the books, and seen all the DVDs, and followed all your guests, and I've been
[45:25.040 --> 45:29.440]  using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield, and since then, I'm on
[45:29.440 --> 45:35.040]  the X2, the SuperMail Vitality Decay Man, the Real Red Pill, MycoZX, Bioshock, and
[45:35.040 --> 45:36.040]  it's all amazing.
[45:36.040 --> 45:37.040]  Thank you, brother.
[45:37.040 --> 45:42.000]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.400]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit, and it's just the more
[45:46.400 --> 45:51.560]  you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God, and I wanted to say that
[45:51.560 --> 45:56.600]  it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776
[45:56.600 --> 45:57.600]  worldwide.
[45:57.600 --> 46:06.280]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is sending
[46:06.280 --> 46:08.400]  down over the U.K.
[46:08.400 --> 46:14.080]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get
[46:14.080 --> 46:16.240]  six months in prison.
[46:16.240 --> 46:20.640]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the U.K. CNN and many
[46:20.640 --> 46:24.800]  others are calling for info wars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[46:24.800 --> 46:30.400]  One magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash young people
[46:30.400 --> 46:35.320]  against info wars, psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear
[46:35.320 --> 46:36.640]  what we have to say.
[46:36.640 --> 46:39.480]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalist.
[46:39.480 --> 46:45.000]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter, and sign up for
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.280]  the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you, and so the censors can bully their
[46:49.280 --> 46:55.880]  way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society that is critical
[46:55.880 --> 46:56.880]  to this fight.
[46:56.880 --> 47:03.520]  We will prevail if you take action, and I know you will.
[47:03.520 --> 47:21.280]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.280 --> 47:38.400]  All right, President Trump is speaking right now.
[47:38.400 --> 47:44.240]  The VA Mission Act, which has been in the works for a while with Chris Nywem, who's
[47:44.240 --> 47:45.880]  going to be joining us on Friday.
[47:45.880 --> 47:48.920]  He's been working to get this deal done with Trump for a long time.
[47:48.920 --> 47:53.840]  He's going to be joining us Friday, but Trump is speaking live right now addressing this,
[47:53.840 --> 47:59.120]  so let's go live to President Trump from Washington, D.C.
[47:59.120 --> 48:00.400]  They are our great people.
[48:00.400 --> 48:05.920]  Four years ago, our entire nation was shocked and outraged by stories of the VA system plagued
[48:05.920 --> 48:12.440]  by neglect, abuse, fraud, and mistreatment of our veterans, and there was nothing they
[48:12.440 --> 48:13.440]  could do about it.
[48:13.440 --> 48:15.440]  They couldn't do anything about it.
[48:15.440 --> 48:20.560]  Some people that worked there, they couldn't take care of the bad people, meaning you're
[48:20.560 --> 48:23.400]  fired, get the hell out of here.
[48:23.400 --> 48:30.120]  With us today are many brave veterans who endured that grave injustice, including Steve Cooper
[48:30.120 --> 48:32.300]  and Laura Vella.
[48:32.300 --> 48:36.560]  They served their country with honor only to be denied the medical treatment they desperately
[48:36.560 --> 48:38.040]  needed.
[48:38.040 --> 48:41.600]  To Steve and Laura, no one should suffer what you suffered.
[48:41.600 --> 48:43.280]  They suffered gravely.
[48:43.280 --> 48:48.360]  No one who defends our country in uniform should have to fight for their lives when they come
[48:48.360 --> 48:51.240]  back, when they come to their home.
[48:51.240 --> 48:56.520]  We commend your strength and courage in the face of hardship, and we pledge to act in
[48:56.520 --> 49:03.280]  your name and in the name of every other veteran who has been so badly wronged, neglected,
[49:03.280 --> 49:04.280]  and mistreated.
[49:04.280 --> 49:12.000]  To those who serve our nation, who risk life and limb for country, we must never be denied
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.920]  care, access, or treatment that they need.
[49:16.920 --> 49:23.720]  That is why we are here today, and that is why we are signing this most important bill.
[49:23.720 --> 49:24.720]  Made so much sense.
[49:24.720 --> 49:30.520]  It's been so long, they've been working on it for years and years and years, and it
[49:30.520 --> 49:32.640]  wouldn't happen.
[49:32.640 --> 49:35.160]  And accountability is the other one.
[49:35.160 --> 49:40.920]  As a candidate for president, and I promise to make reforming the VA one of my absolute
[49:40.920 --> 49:43.280]  highest priorities.
[49:43.280 --> 49:49.080]  And from the first day of my administration, that is exactly what we've done.
[49:49.080 --> 50:00.160]  Last year I signed the historic VA accountability legislation, meaning you now can immediately
[50:00.160 --> 50:06.880]  get rid of people that don't treat our veterans right, that rob us or cheat us or aren't good
[50:06.880 --> 50:08.520]  to our great vets.
[50:08.520 --> 50:09.520]  You can get them out.
[50:09.520 --> 50:10.680]  You couldn't do it.
[50:10.680 --> 50:15.800]  For 40 years they've been trying to pass this, Phil, you know that, 40 years.
[50:15.800 --> 50:16.800]  And they couldn't.
[50:16.800 --> 50:18.560]  Made so much sense.
[50:18.560 --> 50:19.840]  But it was hard.
[50:19.840 --> 50:26.360]  You have civil service, you have unions, of course they'd never do anything to stop anything,
[50:26.360 --> 50:29.040]  but they had a very great deal of power.
[50:29.040 --> 50:32.280]  And in the end they came along, everybody came along, because they knew it was right.
[50:32.280 --> 50:39.120]  So we passed something that hasn't been that recognized, and yet I would put it almost
[50:39.120 --> 50:43.400]  in the class with choice, almost in the class with choice.
[50:43.400 --> 50:48.800]  VA accountability passed, and now if people don't do a great job they can't work with
[50:48.800 --> 50:49.800]  our vets anymore.
[50:49.800 --> 50:56.000]  They're gone.
[50:56.000 --> 50:59.200]  So we're very proud of accountability.
[50:59.200 --> 51:03.600]  In the campaign I also promised that we would fight for veterans' choice.
[51:03.600 --> 51:08.560]  And before I knew that much about it, it just seemed to be common sense.
[51:08.560 --> 51:13.920]  It seemed like if they're waiting on line for nine days and they can't see a doctor,
[51:13.920 --> 51:19.080]  why aren't they going outside to see a doctor and take care of themselves, and we pay the
[51:19.080 --> 51:20.560]  bill?
[51:20.560 --> 51:27.800]  It's less expensive for us, it works out much better, and it's immediate care.
[51:27.800 --> 51:29.120]  And that's what we're doing.
[51:29.120 --> 51:35.400]  So we're allowing our veterans to get access to the best medical care available, whether
[51:35.400 --> 51:39.040]  it's at the VA or at a private provider.
[51:39.040 --> 51:43.840]  In a few moments I will keep that promise that I've been making ever since the first
[51:43.840 --> 51:49.000]  day of my campaign, which seems like a long time ago.
[51:49.000 --> 51:53.480]  And I'm going to sign legislation that will make veterans' choice permanent.
[51:53.480 --> 52:00.000]  And I just can't stress the people here, the people in the audience, Senators, Congress.
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.160]  Okay, so there's President Trump again from Washington, DC, addressing the VA Mission
[52:04.160 --> 52:06.320]  Act, which he signed today.
[52:06.320 --> 52:09.840]  A lot of work was done by Christopher Niewem on that.
[52:09.840 --> 52:14.440]  He's going to be joining us Friday morning here on the Alex Jones Show to discuss all
[52:14.440 --> 52:15.440]  that.
[52:15.440 --> 52:17.080]  Now, I want to hit some news headlines.
[52:17.080 --> 52:22.240]  Before we roll into the next hour, and Jeff Gonzalez joins me, he is the President of
[52:22.240 --> 52:27.720]  Trident Concepts and also the Director of Training for the Range at Austin, a great
[52:27.720 --> 52:29.400]  gun range here in Austin, Texas.
[52:29.400 --> 52:33.480]  But let me get through some of this news here before we get into the next hour.
[52:33.480 --> 52:38.480]  Now, everybody knows about Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong-un.
[52:38.480 --> 52:44.520]  Now it's been announced that Dennis Rodman will be in Singapore for the Trump-Kim summit.
[52:44.520 --> 52:48.760]  So it's kind of like a half joke, half real thing with Dennis Rodman being involved in
[52:48.760 --> 52:52.400]  this negotiation.
[52:52.400 --> 52:55.560]  But here's the funny thing about this to me.
[52:55.560 --> 53:01.400]  Dennis Rodman and Pamela Anderson, yes, that Pamela Anderson, Dennis Rodman and Pamela
[53:01.400 --> 53:07.680]  Anderson are more effective foreign diplomats and negotiators than anyone from Obama's
[53:07.680 --> 53:10.160]  administration.
[53:10.160 --> 53:11.920]  Think about that.
[53:11.920 --> 53:16.320]  And I guess you could perhaps say from Trump's administration, because they're not technically
[53:16.320 --> 53:21.520]  in Trump's administration, but they are getting these negotiations through to the next level
[53:21.520 --> 53:22.720]  under President Trump.
[53:22.720 --> 53:29.840]  But Pam Anderson, good with foreign affairs when it comes to Julian Assange, Dennis Rodman,
[53:29.840 --> 53:35.440]  good with foreign affairs when it comes to Kim Jong-un, better than anyone from the government.
[53:35.440 --> 53:37.600]  So I just found that to be ironic.
[53:37.600 --> 53:42.800]  US trade deficit falls to a seven month low.
[53:42.800 --> 53:48.200]  So this has been something Trump's been addressing since he got into office, the trade deficit.
[53:48.200 --> 53:55.000]  This is the result of manufacturing being shipped out, jobs being shipped out, other
[53:55.000 --> 54:02.120]  countries manipulating their currency, and that's good news with Trump renegotiating
[54:02.120 --> 54:03.760]  trade deals.
[54:03.760 --> 54:10.880]  But on the other side of these affairs, $119 billion merchandise trade deficit with China
[54:10.880 --> 54:12.800]  hits a record high.
[54:12.800 --> 54:17.320]  So on one end, while the financial end of the trade deficit is going the right way for
[54:17.320 --> 54:24.240]  America, the merchandise trade deficit is going the wrong way, with now more goods being
[54:24.240 --> 54:31.080]  purchased from China compared to the United States than ever.
[54:31.080 --> 54:42.520]  3.8 times as many goods are purchased from China by the United States as are by the United
[54:42.520 --> 54:46.600]  States from, or excuse me, by China from the United States.
[54:46.600 --> 54:50.280]  So that's a whole nother issue, but that'll start coming back with manufacturing.
[54:50.280 --> 54:53.680]  When it comes to 2020, the Democrats have not been sure what they're going to do.
[54:53.680 --> 54:58.440]  But now, Howard Schultz from Starbucks seems to be coming into the frame here.
[54:58.440 --> 55:05.040]  Well yesterday, he was wrong when he said that it's Trump's fault for polarizing politics.
[55:05.040 --> 55:08.520]  No, that's the Democrats, but not even really Democrats, really just the fake news more than
[55:08.520 --> 55:11.320]  anything that lies about Trump, like Angela Rye.
[55:11.320 --> 55:15.560]  She's the one polarizing politics lying about President Trump on CNN.
[55:15.560 --> 55:17.560]  But then he says the right thing.
[55:17.560 --> 55:18.560]  I give him credit.
[55:18.560 --> 55:22.120]  Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz rips Democrats for veering too far to the left.
[55:22.120 --> 55:23.560]  How are we going to pay for these things?
[55:23.560 --> 55:28.480]  Uh-oh, the Democrat Party might have a chance.
[55:28.480 --> 55:32.520]  They might have a reasonable guy that says stuff like that now, who could be running
[55:32.520 --> 55:35.480]  in 2020, wouldn't have a chance against Trump.
[55:35.480 --> 55:38.800]  But a businessman that actually understands stuff, Howard Schultz, coming in telling the
[55:38.800 --> 55:41.040]  Democrats, yeah, how are you going to pay for these things?
[55:41.040 --> 55:43.080]  We can't afford it.
[55:43.080 --> 55:47.080]  They just had something today where they had to dip into the reserves for social security.
[55:47.080 --> 55:51.960]  We can't afford that, but we're going to make more entitlement programs, say the Democrats.
[55:51.960 --> 55:58.440]  I didn't mention this, but earlier when I was covering the primary election results,
[55:58.440 --> 56:01.040]  some of the names that you've seen here at InfoWars did well.
[56:01.040 --> 56:06.360]  Antonio Sabato, Dr. Kenneth Wright, Asha Smith, Omar Navarro will all be advancing to the
[56:06.360 --> 56:10.200]  next rounds of elections.
[56:10.200 --> 56:15.560]  But it will be an uphill battle for them while people like Adam Schiff, Maxine Waters, Diane
[56:15.560 --> 56:21.880]  Feinstein, Nancy Pelosi, and Eric Swalwell all are barrel rolling to another victory.
[56:21.880 --> 56:29.880]  Somehow crooks and clowns like that continue to get elected at an astronomical rate.
[56:29.880 --> 56:35.360]  Brad Parskill said some yesterday on Twitter that I want to respond to, but we'll go ahead
[56:35.360 --> 56:37.520]  and wait to do that in the next hour.
[56:37.520 --> 56:44.000]  In the meantime, folks, the specials at InfowarsStore.com are still rolling right now from Memorial
[56:44.000 --> 56:45.000]  Day.
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.960]  Now we're calling them the early summer specials, but it's really the same Memorial Day Patriot
[56:48.960 --> 56:50.640]  specials just extended.
[56:50.640 --> 56:56.320]  It's the same 50% off Brainforce Plus, 50% off Supermail Vitality, 50% off Immune Wall,
[56:56.320 --> 57:02.560]  50% off the Real Red Pill, 50% off Alpha Power, 25% off Survival Shield X2.
[57:02.560 --> 57:04.120]  The list goes on and on.
[57:04.120 --> 57:10.280]  But perhaps the biggest savings you can take advantage of would be with free shipping store-wide.
[57:10.280 --> 57:14.960]  Free shipping store-wide, if you're interested in an air filter, alexa pure air filter,
[57:14.960 --> 57:20.000]  the alexa pure water filter, kind of the bigger, heavier items that are expensive to ship.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.360]  Free shipping store-wide, take advantage of that.
[57:22.360 --> 57:27.120]  Or the emergency food supplies, also expensive to ship, that is included.
[57:27.120 --> 57:30.560]  Free shipping store-wide at InfowarsStore.com.
[57:30.560 --> 57:35.880]  Don't forget to get your Bill Clinton Rape shirt before this Sunday, where we're protesting

[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:41.160]  All right, Jeff Gonzalez from TridentConcepts.com is set to join me in the next segment where
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:45.600]  I will open up the phone lines for any liberals to call in or Obama supporters to call in
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:50.720]  or Democrats, whoever to call in and tell us Obama's accomplishments.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.720]  I'm serious.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:52.720]  I'm not trying to troll you.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.440]  I'm opening up the phone lines to you.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.440]  I want to hear from you.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.240]  What do you think Obama's accomplishments were?

[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.640]  I'm going to open it up in the next hour and we'll take your calls.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.320]  In the meantime, though, listen to Bill Clinton on NBC.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:10.400]  This, of course, after CBS actually gave him a tough interview where he kind of blew up.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.120]  Now he's getting the softball interview and trying to correct the errors he made in the
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.120]  last one.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:44.720]  Bill Clinton on NBC.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:51.760]  This is strange for Bill because this stuff has already passed.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.600]  All of this garbage with all the women and the hookers and the nose like a vacuum cleaner
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.560]  and the cigars and the, you know what, this has all passed and he didn't have to answer
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.760]  to a damn one of it.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.160]  So now here he is like 20 years later, like, man, we already beat that crap.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.400]  He's like, we already had the media fixed.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.240]  Why are we bringing this up now?
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.840]  Don't you know we rigged the system so I didn't have to talk about this?
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:19.440]  Now you can see the anger where he's like, he's like, we already, yeah, like, why does
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.800]  the world have to know about me?
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.840]  Just watch his face during this stuff.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.320]  The lens of me too now.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.760]  Do you, do you think differently or feel more responsibility?
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.520]  No, I felt terrible then.
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.320]  Oh, you felt so bad you lied about it.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.320]  Did you ever apologize?
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.320]  No, yes.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.320]  And nobody will know.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.320]  No, yes.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.840]  That I got out of that for free.
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.280]  How about the White House $16 million in debt?
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.280]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:46.280]  Yeah.
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.520]  Oh, this is actually hilarious.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.280]  Yeah, yeah, remember, pause it, pause it, pause it.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.080]  Oh, remember Hillary sobbing?
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:56.640]  Oh, we were so poor when we left the White House.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.720]  Oh my gosh, life is so hard for the Clintons.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:03.040]  We make billions and billions of dollars at the Clinton administration.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.120]  We steal money from Haiti and Laura Sillsby gets caught with kids at the border.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:11.280]  Oh my gosh, it's so hard, the Clintons.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.320]  Wait a second though.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.120]  Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton both claim they were broke when they came out of the
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.400]  White House.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:27.200]  Maybe that explains why they stole silverware, thieves, I mean, not like, you know, not just
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:32.440]  major crime and money laundering like what we believe goes on at the Clinton Foundation.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:37.960]  We're talking about petty theft of silverware from the White House.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.200]  You don't believe me.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.200]  Look it up.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:45.640]  The Clintons stole silverware from the White House.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:49.400]  That is how claseless these people are.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.800]  They stole silverware.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:04:00.040]  They stole sofa, a sofa, furniture, kitchen tables, chairs, ceiling, tens of thousands
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.800]  of dollars worth of furniture and silverware from the White House.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.840]  I guess maybe they were broke.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:11.880]  Yeah, please, these people are wanton criminals that know no bounds.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:16.640]  And that's why Bill Clinton getting asked real questions on television pisses him off
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:21.160]  because he already pissed on you 20 years ago.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.120]  He thought you already drowned in all the extra that he fed you with his Democrat news sources
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:31.920]  at NBC and ABC and CNN for decades.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.640]  But maybe they were broke.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.320]  Maybe the Clintons were broke when they left the White House.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.920]  And that's why those petty thefts.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:44.280]  That's why those criminals stole silverware and furniture from the White House when they
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.280]  were leaving.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:49.280]  Jeff Gonzalez from Trident Concepts joins me on the other side and we open up the phone
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:54.360]  line to liberals to call in and tell us what are Obama's greatest accomplishments?
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:58.600]  Will the lines be dead?
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.440]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have it
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.120]  in Fuller's life.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.120]  It takes hours.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.440]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.600]  It's stronger.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.160]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.440]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.520]  It's back in stock.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:17.720]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.120]  It's got the preglonone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.520]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids, so you can upload it.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:30.040]  And our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:35.560]  4 to 5 toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle that's a spray you do.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.960]  You can also swallow it.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:42.200]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.640]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:49.400]  So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.840]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.840]  the word.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:06:00.840]  So thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:29.320]  It's a platform called InfoWars and in the decade since, it's grown into a truly remarkable
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:34.640]  institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:41.680]  monthly and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:46.720]  InfoWars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country dedicated to delivering
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:52.320]  breaking news, live coverage of special events and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.320]  else.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:58.360]  While the old guard media struggles to maintain supremacy in a landscape brought by innovation
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:04.160]  and technology, InfoWars has been at the forefront of the Information Revolution.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:09.760]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:15.800]  of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:21.520]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis, for high-profile interviews and
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:30.840]  bombshell revelations, accept no substitutes, demand truth, demand InfoWars.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:36.720]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:43.840]  We are drugged out, we are following other people's opinions, we are controlled by the
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:50.760]  media, today it all changes, this reality has been forced upon us, it is a choice, just
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.600]  like when I said slavery is a choice.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.440]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.160]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f**k you, f**k you, how are we going to get
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:07.000]  a different result out of hate, why don't we just try love, why don't we just try love,
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.960]  we have the resources for a peaceful world.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.720]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy mother f**kers to change something, Steve Jobs is
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:20.360]  crazy, now we all know Steve Jobs falls, they say Trump's crazy, they say I'm crazy, but
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:27.360]  I'm here to show love, it's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.360]  me.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:33.800]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:39.800]  I'm filling in for Alex Jones, I am Owen Schreuer, my guest in studio is Jeff Gonzalez
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:45.720]  from TridentConcepts.com, of course the range here at Austin is where he directs courses,
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:49.880]  which is a great range here, I do enjoy going there, I purchased his firearms from there
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:58.120]  myself and we're going to talk about second amendment issues and the whole misunderstanding
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:05.480]  of the second amendment and then the misappropriation of what it really is for by the left and how
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:10.440]  they twist it and then try to demonize it whenever there's a mass shooting.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:14.120]  But also what we're going to do is we're going to have a little fun here, myself and
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:19.360]  Jeff from TridentConcepts.com, we're going to open up the phone lines specifically to
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:26.800]  liberals and democrats, Obama supporters, to hear about Obama's accomplishments.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:31.560]  So we heard about Trump's accomplishments in the first 500 days, so I'm genuinely wanting
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:42.800]  to hear from Obama supporters today, 1-877-789-ALIX, 1-877-789-2539, call in if you're an Obama
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.680]  supporter and just tell us Obama's accomplishments.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:51.240]  I'm genuinely open here, want to hear what you think Obama's accomplishments are, so
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:55.480]  we're going to give you a chance today, you can call in, the lines are open, screeners,
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:59.120]  make sure people that are calling in are calling in on that subject issue, otherwise we'll
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:06.240]  just stick to news here, 1-877-789-2539.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:12.400]  There's a little meme that Turning Point USA put out, eight years, three accomplishments,
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:16.880]  and three accomplishments are, school lunches, inedible, health insurance, unaffordable,
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.600]  police lives, unimportant.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:25.760]  So Jeff, Jeff Gunn's Austin from TridentConcepts.com, a lot to cover here, but I think that let's
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.120]  start with the misunderstanding of the second amendment.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:33.160]  Now, my philosophy on the second amendment is that it's not, they didn't write it in
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:37.840]  there so that me and you can just have a gun at each other's head all day long, like, well,
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.360]  I have a right to this gun, I have a right to this gun, I have a right to this gun.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.880]  Also, but it's so that you and I could have a gun in case the government wanted to have
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.400]  that same gun and then try to oppress us.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.720]  That was always my philosophy.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.960]  I, and I agree 100% with that.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.480]  The biggest thing that I've always taken away from the second amendment is that it defends
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.280]  all the other amendments.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:58.760]  It is the one that stands firm against everything else.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:03.000]  So without that one, there is no freedom of speech, there is no, there's no fourth amendment,
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.560]  there's none of that, because then again, the oppressiveness of anybody who has the
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.600]  guns can just pretty much do what they want.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.160]  And they will take that and run with it and say, well, you don't need weapons that the
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.640]  military uses, right?
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:20.720]  You don't need to have these weapons of war to which I say, well, what if the weapons
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.120]  of war come to my front door?
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:23.800]  Well, then what am I going to want to have?
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:30.120]  The idea, first of all, we don't have those weapons for those are very strictly regulated
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.120]  firearms.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.120]  Yeah, I can't go get a bazooka or rocket launcher.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:39.720]  I mean, or even just as benign as the M4, which is the fully automatic version of the
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.240]  AR-15, which is the commercial civilian model.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:48.120]  So whenever they go down that road, I'm really, it perks me with the way they use the language
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.120]  there, weapons of war.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:53.240]  It's not, but they use it because it incites fear and misunderstanding.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.040]  And that's their whole point.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:59.040]  That's what they like to try to do is confuse and make people afraid.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.040]  Well, fear is the big one.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.520]  They want people to be afraid.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.360]  And of course, I mean, look, it's a gun.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.360]  It can kill you.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.520]  There is a reason that you're afraid of a gun.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:12.720]  So is a thief, so is a robber, so is a potential rapist.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:18.440]  So there's a reason why it's a tool used in self-defense, but it's really aggravating.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:22.080]  And I'm sure that you've actually seen this at the range and doing your courses and your
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.600]  training and everything, where you'll have an individual that comes in and they have
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:31.160]  this fear of a firearm or this hesitation to even touch it or shoot it.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:34.600]  But then by the time they're out of there, the training, the experience, they feel totally
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.100]  differently.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:39.640]  There is a natural fear, partly because there's the fear of the unknown, right?
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.720]  They don't know what to expect.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.960]  So what our job is, is our job is to educate, to get them comfortable so that they can learn
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:52.120]  that it is like any other industrial tool, that with proper training, education and respect,
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:56.880]  then it becomes just like anything else that they might find in their garage.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:01.200]  One of the things that bothers me again about kind of like the liberal slant or the anti-gun
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:08.920]  slant is how those that really do need a firearm are the ones that they're targeting with fear,
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:14.720]  to prevent them from actually becoming self-sufficient or at least being able to protect themselves.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:20.560]  And I looked at a situation where there's a, we'll go with the CNN term, adult film
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:28.560]  star here in Austin, Texas that did this publicity stunt where she gives away her firearm to
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.400]  the police officer in this buyback program that they have.
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.880]  And she puts it on social media and I'm sitting here scratching my head like, okay, not only
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:40.620]  did you just give away your right to protection, you just gave the public a notice, you just
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:45.320]  gave any potential stalkers a notice, hey, look, I'm not armed, come on in.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:51.120]  Well, I think that's one of those nearsightedness, they don't really think it through, they don't
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.120]  really understand.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:57.240]  Okay, not only have you everything that you just said, but it's grandstanding.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.880]  It's trying to make a name for themselves.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.880]  That's a lot of that.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.880]  Yeah.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:01.880]  Oh, totally.
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.880]  I mean, it's not genuine.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.760]  There's nothing genuine about that because if there was, they would have done it in a
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:11.280]  more less attention-getting manner, which is what bothers me the most because that's
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.280]  all that was.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.040]  And they try to slant it towards, oh, look at what this responsible individual is doing.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.600]  And if it was genuine, you wouldn't have all of these double standards that you could find
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.600]  in a heartbeat.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.600]  Yeah.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.800]  Oh, we want to protect the children, you know, every time there's school, everybody wants
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.800]  to protect the children.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.840]  So I'll see you at the Planned Parenthood protest, right?
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.000]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we got a fun Planned Parenthood, don't you see?
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  Big difference there.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  So that's how it goes.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.880]  So Jeff Gonzalez is going to be in studio here with me in the second hour, perhaps beyond.
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:42.900]  Roger Stone will take over in the fourth hour.
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.200]  This is what you can expect.

[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.800]  We talk about Trump's accomplishments all day long.

[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.160]  And let's see if you can call in and tell me all of Obama's accomplishments.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.720]  And I'm not talking about the inedible launches.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:07.880]  You know, I'm not talking about being the greatest spy, you know, illegal spy in American
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:08.880]  history.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.360]  What do you think the accomplishments are?
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.600]  So the phone line is open.

[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:37.320]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.320]  government ever.
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:43.920]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:47.080]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.080]  are.

[01:17:53.680 --> 01:18:07.400]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.400]  yeast.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:11.960]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew

[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.000]  Good, but that's the truth here.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.840]  Jeff Gonzalez in studio with me, TridentConcepts.com, trainer here at the range in Austin.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:33.880]  We've got phone lines calling in right now.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:34.880]  The phone lines are lit up.
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.680]  We've got some people that want to call in and talk about Obama's accomplishments, so
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:38.840]  we will take your phone calls.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:45.280]  But we're just sitting here going back and forth in the break about how it was the Florida
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:52.040]  shooting and then the response to it in the media that made me go out and get an AR-15
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.520]  because I was like, wow, they really are going to try to take this.
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.120]  They're going to write the legislation.
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.200]  Maybe it's not this year.
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:58.200]  Maybe it's not next year.
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.200]  But eventually they're going to get it.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:02.520]  So I need to make sure I have one before they make it illegal.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:05.640]  And we're saying, you know, we don't like reporting on it.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:06.640]  It's just a fact.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:10.140]  Whenever there's a shooting like this, more people go to the range in Austin.
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:12.040]  More people want firearms training from you.
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.040]  More people want guns.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.520]  I mean, it goes hand in hand.
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:21.040]  I mean, I hate to say it because you don't want to see a surge in sales as a result of
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.200]  a tragedy.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:28.320]  But the media does such a good job, again, of creating that fear that it's an impulse
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.320]  buy for most.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:32.720]  I would say we see so many people, first time gun owners come in after a major shooting.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.720]  That's how it was for me.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.720]  I get impulse.
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:37.840]  It was just like, boom, I need to do this because you said it yourself.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:40.840]  I'm worried that they're going to shut this down like really.
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:44.760]  And the media, what I've learned about the media is they will report what they feel good
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.360]  about reporting, not necessarily the truth.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:51.440]  And that, unfortunately, confuses people because then there are these impulse buys that people
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:54.720]  were like, oh my God, I need to get this because I may never get a chance again.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:22:02.080]  Well, and I would say, I mean, it's half humor, but reality, the best salesman ever for guns
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.960]  in the history of this country was Barack Obama.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.960]  Now David Hogg.
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:09.400]  Yeah, probably, or I would say David is responsible for more NRA memberships.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:11.600]  Well, by the numbers, for sure.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:12.600]  They definitely helped us.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:13.600]  There's another one.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:14.600]  There's another one.
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:18.040]  But my family had been in the NRA and I was like part of it with my family.
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.400]  Once you hit an age, you know, whatever it is.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.760]  So I went out for the first time finally, they've been sending me the stuff like, hey,
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.760]  join now.
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.520]  And then finally after that, I'm joined the NRA.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.520]  It was the same thing.
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.760]  I mean, you know, I don't understand how they can't figure that out yet.
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:36.960]  But you know, eight years of record sales for firearms purchases and within six months,
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.440]  you know, I mean, of the, you know, and within the firearms industry, you see this like after
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:45.640]  Trump was elected, they're kind of like, there was this down search.
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:48.960]  And I think, you know, it was because we weren't sure what was going to happen.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.080]  But now people are comfortable.
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:54.160]  And now the opposite effect of what's happening, which is now people are going out and actually
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:58.640]  enjoying the art or the sport of shooting, they're getting involved in self-defences.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:02.400]  You know, like now that everything's kind of planed out and settled out, everything's
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.400]  kind of back to normal.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.460]  Well, and I think that there's this other thing that media does.
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:13.040]  And I guess, you know, street liberals do the protesters is they want to put gun owners
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:19.240]  or second amendment activists in a box where I am a huge second amendment activist.
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:24.480]  I've got guns, but I really only just love going out and shooting skeet at the range
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.480]  with my shotgun.
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:26.480]  I don't go hunting.
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:27.480]  I don't have a bunch of rifles.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.480]  Now there are people that do that.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.480]  And that's perfectly within their right.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.480]  And they enjoy that.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.480]  And that's fine.
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:35.280]  But they try to put everybody into a box and then say, point the finger, you do this,
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.280]  you do this.
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.960]  No, no, no, no, we just love the second amendment for a bunch of different reasons.
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:44.760]  And it's all the core issue is for the right to self-protection universal.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:45.760]  It should never be.
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:46.760]  It should never come in a question.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:51.080]  I'm always upset and disappointed when the media attacks it that way.
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:56.120]  Or, you know, like, well, you don't need anything other than a shotgun for your defense
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:57.120]  of needs.
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.680]  And it's like, well, you know, you don't get to dictate what I actually need.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:03.240]  There was a there was an armed robber in a man's house.
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:04.440]  I forget where this was.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.800]  He comes home to armed robbers in his house.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:10.720]  He grabs his AK-47 out of his closet, shoots him dead, comes out alive.
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.560]  I'll, I'll trump that one.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.800]  No pun intended with a, you know, there's the argument, well, why do you need an AR-15
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.800]  for home defense?
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:22.320]  So there was a video that was released just yesterday, I believe, of some home invaders
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.320]  all masked up, all both of them carrying AR-15s broke down the door.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:30.920]  Luckily, the family was on vacation, but they had that nice security system on their front
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.920]  porch and through their house.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:35.920]  It was all recorded and of course they were, you know, they were eventually apprehended.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:41.480]  But yeah, how are you to dictate what I do and don't need for my needs?
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:45.000]  You know, like, I'm not saying that everybody has to have one, but in a setting like that,
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.360]  it would be kind of nice to have something that's, I mean, there's a reason why we like
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:51.800]  those types of weapon systems is that they, they increase my survivability.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:57.640]  Well, and I think it's an issue of, like you're saying, it's just your right to decide.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.880]  You can, we can have a debate.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.200]  Oh, no, the best home defense weapon is a shotgun.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:02.200]  Oh, no.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.200]  The best is the handgun.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.200]  Oh, no.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:07.680]  The best is this, but it's about your right to decide.
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.880]  And if you're in a situation like you said, I would, I would make the argument that the
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.760]  best home defense weapon is a shotgun.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:17.440]  However, if two people come into my house with AR-15s, I'm going to change my mind real
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:18.440]  quick.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:19.440]  I think, I think that's normal.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.880]  You know, I think that's actually, you know, that's just again, but that's, but that's
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:27.560]  the type of, that's the type of criminal activity that people don't want to acknowledge.
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:28.560]  Wait a second.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.440]  You're telling me that criminals don't follow the law right now?
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.440]  I know, right?
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:32.440]  Yeah.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.000]  It's kind of silly to see how the, you know, a felon could actually obtain a firearm.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.120]  I'm still trying to figure out how that happens, how that works.
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.120]  I don't understand.
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:43.240]  It's like, well, how come whenever there's a mass shooting situation, why doesn't somebody
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:47.040]  just stand up and say, excuse me, shooter, that gun is illegal here?
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.600]  Excuse me, shooter, you're not allowed to kill people.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.320]  I think you think they would listen.
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:55.800]  I've gone back to that first and fundamental, you know, that the taking of another life has
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.520]  been unlawful for the ages.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.040]  You know, it's nothing new, but yet all of a sudden, you know, we have to create more
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:10.160]  unnecessary and quite frankly, just nothing, the new laws, it aren't going to work.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.640]  They're not going to do anything to change it.
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:15.080]  All they're going to do is continue to repress us, repress us, repress us, which I, which
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.040]  I believe is an ultimate goal, just to create so much.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:23.400]  I mean, in some states, the laws are so confusing that even the law enforcement doesn't know
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:24.960]  how to interpret them.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:29.920]  And how is the average citizen of that state supposed to be able to, you know, how can
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:33.640]  you expect them to be reasonably educated on that law if the law enforcement can't even
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:34.640]  interpret it?
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.400]  And what are you going to do whenever you pass these different gun legislation or gun
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:44.040]  acts with the background checks and then the background check fails because there's not
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.040]  a real stop gap?
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.240]  I mean, how does Nicholas Cruz get the weapon?
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.720]  Well, you have the promise program set up by Democrats that allows him to stay off the,
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:57.760]  you know, a list, and then you have, and you would probably know more about this, where
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:01.200]  I mean, you know, whenever you buy an AR, you go through the background check and ask
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.680]  you domestic abuse, you know, drug abuse, this and everything, you just say no.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:10.000]  And unless the FBI is actually doing their job on the back end, you can get through that
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.200]  really easily.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.200]  That is unfortunate.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.200]  Yes.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:18.360]  And me, but it's, it's there for a reason, you know, the, you know, and that's not something
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.360]  that gun activists and second amendment activists complain about.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.360]  Yeah.
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.640]  No, I mean, it's because why would we?
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:27.960]  That's just, you know, I mean, that's no different than any other security form.
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.720]  What they call common sense, right?
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:30.720]  Yeah.
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:31.720]  Yeah.
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:32.720]  That's what they do.
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:33.720]  Not so much.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:34.720]  Not so much.
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:35.720]  All right.
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:36.720]  So here's the deal.
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:37.720]  So, so we're going to be going back and forth with Jeff Gonzalez from TridentConcepts.com.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:42.760]  And if, if you're here in Austin or in Texas, and you've never been to the range at Austin,
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.000]  I suggest you check it out.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.960]  Not only do they have a huge selection of firearms to go check out and purchase, but
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:52.320]  also great ranges and instructors there as well.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.040]  So he's going to be hanging out with me and we're going to be taking your phone calls.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.360]  We're going to go out to the phone lines here in the next segment.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.000]  And I'm genuinely asking, I'm not trying to troll.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.600]  I'm not trying to set you up for something.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:07.840]  I'm just genuinely asking, we've been celebrating Trump's accomplishments in his first 500 days.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:08.840]  I could go off here.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:09.840]  I don't need to tell a prompter.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.840]  Don't need the list.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.340]  I could go off and tell you all Trump's accomplishments.
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:16.480]  So we're going to open up the phone lines for Obama supporters, Democrats.
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:20.720]  Now I want to hear what you think Obama's biggest accomplishments were.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:25.820]  We, Jeff and I have already discovered one of them and that was the, one of the greatest
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.160]  gun salesmen in US history.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:29.160]  Now that's a troll.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.880]  I don't expect anyone to say that, but we will go to the phone lines.
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:35.560]  We're going to hear what liberals, Democrats and Obama supporters have to say.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:39.080]  What were Obama's biggest accomplishments in office?
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.080]  Hey, look at that.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:43.920]  Even CNN says Obama is the best gun salesman in America.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:46.360]  Hey, even a blind squirrel finds it.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.360]  Not every once at all.
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:48.600]  CNN has it right for once.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:49.600]  All right.
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.880]  We'll be right back with Jeff Gonzalez, TridentConcepts.com.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:52.880]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.880]  Don't go anywhere.

[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.200]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:31.760]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.560]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.800]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:40.600]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:41.600]  case.
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:45.480]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[01:29:49.280 --> 01:30:17.600]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, that's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, DanPilla.com.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:42.680]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter and sign up for the
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:47.780]  free newsletter so we can be in contact with you so the censors can't bully their way in
[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:52.840]  and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society.
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:54.320]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:57.920]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:03.680]  I want to plow into all of this, that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:09.680]  encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:17.880]  or books or videos or other material from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:22.800]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:23.800]  at infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:27.480]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:32.640]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine and you cannot beat that for
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:33.640]  children and adults.
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:37.840]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:39.320]  and iodine as well.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:45.800]  Call warzlife.com or triple-A-253-3139 and your purchase of the products stands with
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:49.720]  us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:53.520]  pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are and they're
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:57.960]  coming back against us so we need your support.
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:02.320]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:07.040]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:08.560]  to detoxify the body.
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:13.440]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:18.640]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:21.720]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.960]  It is a classical 360-win.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:28.440]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:33.120]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.120]  get.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:37.360]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:42.400]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:47.600]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:50.320]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:53.640]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:33:01.920]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShieldInfoWarsLive.com.
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:16.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:21.280]  Broadcasting live from the U.N. Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:35.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.360]  Okay we've got the phone lines lit up here.
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.360]  People calling in.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:40.360]  I'm being genuine.
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.360]  I'm not trying to troll.
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.120]  We're going to take calls from Democrats here and we're going to find out what they
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.200]  say, what were Obama's big accomplishments.
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:53.560]  So I've got Jeff Gonzalez in studio with me from tridentconcepts.com.
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:57.640]  He is also an instructor at the range here in Austin.
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:01.120]  But we're taking your calls here from Democrats, Obama supporters.
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:06.880]  We had Trump's massive accomplishments from his first 500 days, big stories, huge accomplishments,
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.320]  they keep coming.
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.240]  So we're going to hear from the Obama supporters.
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.640]  Let's see what Obama's big accomplishments were.
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:15.880]  Let's start with Josh calling in from Florida.
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:16.880]  Go ahead Josh.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:20.080]  Hey Ellen, yes, I got nothing.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:23.880]  Really, I keep trying to think about this, off the top of my head, the only thing I come
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:28.480]  up with is not running into Syria based on misinformation from the Lee coups or the
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:29.480]  Wahhabis.
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:31.480]  Other than that, I got nothing.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:32.480]  That's a fair point.
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:34.680]  But I'm not really sure if that's an Obama accomplishment.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:39.400]  I think that's more of a media alternative media accomplishment for getting the truth
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:43.360]  out about it to the point where the military said we're not going to be ISIS's air force.
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.640]  What do you think about that?
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.640]  I agree.
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:46.640]  Yeah.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:54.840]  That was kind of, again, the media doing an excellent job of poor reporting.
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:35:00.680]  Just reporting on whatever false flag they can go for.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:07.360]  It's really strange that you can have an event where they say Assad gassed his own people
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:10.000]  and they just give you no reason.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:16.880]  Yeah, I mean, it would be nice to have somebody actually reporting on the, like you said,
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:22.120]  on the reasons and the depth and giving content, like giving some, what's going on there that
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:25.880]  would even get to that point where all of a sudden something as atrocious as Assad and
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:27.440]  his own people is occurring.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.800]  Why aren't we covering any of that?
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:30.800]  Yeah.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.320]  All right, well Josh gave it a go and said he, at the end of the day, he couldn't figure
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:35.320]  it out.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:38.160]  So let's go to Steve now calling in from my hometown of St. Louis.
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:40.160]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:41.760]  Hey, Owen, can you hear me?
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.760]  Yep, go ahead.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:43.760]  Hey, man.
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:44.760]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.640]  Well, it's kind of an inadvertent accomplishment, but if you think about it, even going back
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:53.600]  to Jimmy Carter, I can't think of one president who brought more attention to police brutality.
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:57.920]  It may have been virtue signaling and it may have been inadvertent, but he's, you know,
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:01.960]  as far as body cams go, there's just some actual reforms that are happening.
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:09.240]  This is an interesting point and I think that, I mean, let's be fair, Steve phrases it to
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:12.240]  say that Obama did the most to call out police brutality.
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:15.240]  I think that's actually a fair statement to make.
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:21.160]  I think that somebody may phrase it differently and say that he was trying to divide based
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:25.360]  on racism or, you know, police brutality, but that's a fair point and he did get the
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:28.880]  body cams across to which I will actually respond.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.560]  I've got the story in front of me some here in my stack of news.
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:38.600]  I got to find it, but the police officers from New Jersey, here it is, Wildwood cops
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:41.680]  won't face criminal charges and violent beach arrest.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:46.680]  So you had that 20 year old girl who wasn't drunk, passed a breathalyzer twice.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:51.640]  The police tried to arrest her anyway, then threw her to the ground and assaulted her.
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:54.240]  She comes out of that deal with three different charges.
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:59.000]  The police have none and we saw the whole thing because of the body camera and yet still
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.920]  no justice for that little girl.
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:03.720]  But the issue to me has always been the same.
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:06.320]  20 year old drinking at the beach.
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.000]  Oh my gosh, I'm shocked.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  Wow.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  Wow.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.440]  20 year olds like to drink alcohol.
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:12.440]  Who knew?
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:13.920]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:14.920]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:15.920]  It's like the same thing.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:19.920]  Do we really need a bunch of police officers running around looking for a bag of marijuana?
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:24.600]  Do we really need three police officers running around trying to take down a girl for maybe
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.720]  underage drinking at the beach when she wasn't?
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:30.840]  I mean, to me, that's the issue here, Jeff, is that there's too many reasons for police
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.680]  to get involved in our lives.
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:38.640]  Well, I think that there's a bigger issue in the sense that when you talk with veteran
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:44.320]  officers, they have the experience to kind of make a better decision about, while yes,
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:49.240]  maybe that is illegal, does it constitute being arrested?
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:50.240]  And the judgment-
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.880]  Yeah, are we a land of law or justice?
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:52.880]  Right.
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:57.480]  I mean, capturing in judgment, which I believe is important in a situation like that, like,
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:04.180]  hey, being able to bring it in without going to the extreme of an arrest and creating basically
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:08.160]  a national incident where now it's broadcast all over the media.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:14.400]  So for me, I like listening to the veteran officers that talk about an experienced level
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:20.300]  that is necessary for young officers to kind of observe, but most of that experience moves
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:22.320]  up in the ranks and they're kind of on the street.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:26.520]  So there's a vacuum of some sorts.
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:31.640]  Like nowadays, I do think that it's warranted to consider, is this an offense that really
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:35.840]  does justify an arrest, even though it may have broken the law in this case underage
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:36.840]  drinking?
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:37.840]  Does it really justify it?
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:41.120]  And to go back to what you're saying about the experienced officers, I was listening
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:44.520]  to a bunch of talk radio on this subject, and experienced officers would call in and
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:47.440]  they'd say, here's how it should have been dealt with.
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:50.400]  If you wanted to do something about this, if you really wanted to make a case out of
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:54.280]  this, you take, she had a wine spritzer, you take the wine spritzer and you pour it out
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:55.280]  and it's game over.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.280]  Yeah.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.280]  And she would have done that.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:00.520]  She would have gladly done that and said her face shoved into the ground and in my
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:04.720]  estimation assaulted, but the police get away with that must be their white privilege or
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:05.720]  her white privilege.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:06.720]  I don't know.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:07.720]  Anything else, Steve?
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:12.920]  As far as that goes, that girl, that situation she was in, I've been in plenty of situations
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:15.200]  with police, just like you said, they make you pour it out.
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.520]  But I think her attitude and the, you know, she helped escalate the situation just as
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.640]  much and you saw her sit in a cop's face.
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:21.640]  I mean, hold on.
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:22.640]  Let's be fair.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:23.640]  Let's be fair.
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:24.640]  Yeah.
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:25.640]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:26.640]  Hold on though.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:29.320]  The police officers are asking for her personal information for no reason.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.760]  They had no reason to do that.
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:31.760]  She didn't do anything illegal.
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:32.760]  She wasn't being arrested.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.000]  She wasn't being detained.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.640]  At this point, doesn't a woman have the right to stop a police officer from stalking her?
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:41.600]  Well, I don't know that she wasn't drinking at all.
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.680]  I mean, there's, she passed a breathalyzer twice.
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:44.680]  No, no, no.
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:45.680]  She passed a breathalyzer twice.
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:46.680]  She passed it.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:47.680]  I didn't hear that.
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:48.680]  She passed it twice.
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:49.680]  Twice.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:50.680]  Twice.
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:51.680]  They made her blow twice.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:52.680]  She passed twice.
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:53.680]  That does change my opinion on it a little bit.
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:54.680]  It does.
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:59.720]  But I mean, and the issue of her spitting, I mean, she has her face shoved into the ground.
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.680]  She's probably got a bunch of sand in her mouth, you know.
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:03.680]  Yeah.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:05.400]  And this is just one incident.
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:06.400]  The only, see, here's my thing.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:09.960]  When I cover the police brutality things, I really only like to focus on ones where
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:14.240]  we have the full picture with the body cam, otherwise ambiguousness and you never know
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.480]  what you could report on.
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:16.480]  We see this whole scene.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.360]  I mean, look at the guy punching her in the head.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:25.920]  I mean, again, I'm, I back police officers, but this is just out of control in my opinion.
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:26.920]  Anything else, Steve?
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:27.920]  That's the worst of worlds.
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:28.920]  Yeah.
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:29.920]  All right, Steve, thank you for the call.
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:30.920]  Hey, fair point.
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:33.080]  You want to tout the police body cams to Obama.
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:37.160]  I'm not sure if it's totally Obama's fault, but I'd say he had a factor that I'll give
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.160]  Steve that.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:43.920]  Well, I mean, I think the body, I kind of feel like while initially the body cams were designed
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.200]  to kind of help illustrate police brutality, I think what they've also done is they've
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:54.000]  illustrated the lack of morals with a lot of, a lot of the citizens where they make,
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  you know, false claims.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.560]  This is a great point.
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:02.920]  And so in the sense that while the body cams were maybe designed around, you know, protecting
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.920]  the citizen, exactly.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:04.920]  Police brutality.
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:09.080]  Now what we're learning with all of these body cam videos being released for incidences
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:15.160]  of false claims, and now we're starting to realize, wow, maybe this is actually turned
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:16.520]  in the favor of law enforcement.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:20.960]  Now I think what's going to happen is now people are probably going to think twice about
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:25.720]  false claims and maybe exaggerating on their claims because now they know that the police
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:26.760]  are going to be wearing a body cam.
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:31.280]  So I think it's now the pendulum is swinging more in favor of law enforcement now, having
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:35.520]  a little bit better rapport with the public knowing that, hey, you know, this is probably
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:36.840]  going to end up on the media.
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:37.920]  Everybody can see this.
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:40.760]  If you lie or if you don't tell the truth, it's probably going to come back to bite
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:41.760]  you in the butt.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:46.440]  And it was kind of a situation with the rollout where both sides were kind of debating, is
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:47.440]  it good?
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:48.440]  Is it bad?
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.440]  Well, it's rolled out.
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:52.640]  Now the results are kind of in, I think, not just, you know, to say that, oh, it helps
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.000]  police here or it helps citizens here.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.880]  I think it just helps justice and truth really at the end of the day because you had the
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:05.040]  two incidents where you had the woman, the media kind of spun it, Sean King, the one fake
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:08.320]  black guy says that this woman was raped by the officer.
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.000]  Body cam footage comes out totally respectful exchange.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:16.400]  You had the NAACP president say that he was victimized by racism and police brutality.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.320]  Body cam comes out nothing.
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:21.200]  But then you get other body cams like the one from the beach and other incidents where
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:23.280]  you're like, okay, maybe the police was out of control there.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:25.600]  So really to me, it doesn't really favor either side.
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.720]  It just favors reality and truth and fairness.
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:31.960]  Well, I haven't seen the body cam from the New Jersey or the beach scene.
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:33.840]  I haven't seen the body cam stuff from that.
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:39.080]  But we saw what we were looking at it looked like it was like handheld videos of some sort.
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:44.760]  But my point is that I think before now you're right, it's kind of like now there's balance.
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:47.280]  Now it's, hey, just be truthful.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:51.800]  Don't try to, I mean, if you get caught doing something, you know that those body cams are
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:52.800]  now going to come out.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.000]  All right, we're going to take more calls on Obama's accomplishments on the other side.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:04.120]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by info wars life, our organic formula is

[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:02.040]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:06.560]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani estates, but a lot of us on the big island
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:12.000]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.400]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:18.920]  to unhealthy levels.
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:25.440]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:29.400]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:30.800]  in the rainwater.
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:36.120]  Next, we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:42.200]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:47.840]  As it turns out, the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:53.160]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:58.120]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:02.680]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home, but sometimes
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:04.800]  supplements don't work fast enough.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:09.640]  That's why info wars life has created a powerful new addition to the super blue line, super

[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:30.840]  All right, Jeff Gonzalez is in studio with me, tridentconcepts.com, he's also an instructor
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:36.640]  here at the range at Austin and we're taking phone calls from Obama supporters here hearing
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:38.240]  about Obama's accomplishments.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:42.920]  We heard about Trump's accomplishments in the first 500 days, so I'm giving a chance
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:45.560]  for Obama supporters to do the same thing.
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:50.760]  And we've actually got some fair calls, Josh and Steve, well Josh said, I'm sorry I couldn't
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:51.760]  come up with anything.
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:55.360]  He was honest, he thought he had one, he said, ah, no.
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:01.200]  Then Steve mentioned the body cameras on the police officers, which did Obama have an involvement
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:05.120]  in that, I think yes, you'd have to say so, is he fully to blame, maybe not, but that
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:06.120]  was one thing.
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:07.920]  So I think that's fair.
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:14.920]  So we'll continue down this experiment here and let's hear from Matthew now in South Carolina.
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:17.800]  What are Obama's greatest accomplishments, Matthew?
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:23.800]  Yes, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2013.
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:27.480]  Now are you a supporter of that?
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:32.320]  Well it's an accomplishment that pushed through everything after that.
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:39.400]  Now and of course, now I'm assuming, I'm sorry I didn't hear that, but I'm assuming that
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:44.120]  you are not an Obama fan and that you're saying this because that act was so authoritarian
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:48.120]  or am I misreading you?
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:58.680]  Well for example, I know two lesbians, they've been together 28 years and they couldn't get
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:01.720]  married and have the same social security benefits.
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:10.040]  Now non-violently what that allowed through domestic propaganda was to basically like
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:15.560]  educate housewives and millennials.
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:18.640]  I'm not really sure I understand the connection here.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:24.120]  The propaganda of Smith's Modernization Act, which was in that.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:26.560]  How many people actually have heard of that though?
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:32.160]  Well it doesn't matter if you heard of it, it's the propaganda, the fake news.
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:35.640]  It is what allows that media to say that.
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:41.720]  So you're saying Obama helped get more young people to push for-
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:46.320]  Everybody, no, everybody, no, the domestic propaganda works on everybody.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:52.440]  You're still saying Obama's supporters, he's past, that's in the past.
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:57.240]  The domestic propaganda of that is still going on.
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:02.120]  I see what you're saying, but why specifically did you mention the homosexual gay wedding
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:03.240]  thing?
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:09.840]  After that, everything culturally, that was the medium he used.
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:16.520]  So let me ask you this then, would you say then that part of the response if you will
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:21.000]  or the reaction to that would be like all the drag queen shows or all the drag queen
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.640]  reading to children at the libraries?
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:26.360]  Is that what you're kind of saying is flowing down from this?
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:28.640]  That's a good question.
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:34.840]  It's like Trump, if I shoot for the moon, but I only get up to 80,000 feet and I only
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:39.760]  needed 40, I reach my goal.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:40.760]  So that's an interesting-
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:48.240]  So I understand it looks bad from my optic point of view, but when you realize it's still
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:50.720]  in the books.
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:55.960]  You know, it's like the gorilla we're not talking about, but it is an accomplishment.
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:51:03.560]  It has driven through all the gay rights, even if I might add, scarily, like you say.
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:07.440]  And we might as well just take it one step further, because Matthew does bring up a fair
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:08.560]  point here.
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:13.000]  You could also tie that into everything we're seeing in the military now and the Navy and
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.520]  the testing, how they're changing it, how they're saying, okay, maybe we will have transgenders,
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:18.800]  now Trump's in, maybe we won't.
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:23.880]  But I think that, would you say you can kind of tie all that together, Matthew, with this?
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:29.920]  The Smith-Mont modernization act does tie that together.
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:37.120]  That is the medium, because it's state department, actually the way it's worded is does not prohibit
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:41.320]  the state department from propaganda on the American public.
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:46.520]  So there it is, the crew has the guys pull that back up, what our caller Matthew is bringing
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:53.040]  up here, how Obama signed it into legislation for it to be legal to spread propaganda.
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:56.960]  Oh my gosh, and now I'm just putting it together, too.
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:03.000]  Remember we just had the Obama, oh, oh, what was his name, who came out and said, I was
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.680]  basically the head of Obama's propaganda department.
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:10.760]  So Obama signs the act, hey great call Matthew in South Carolina, real good stuff here.
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:15.520]  We're getting, see this, I wasn't trying to troll, I mean, these are good callers.
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:17.840]  Obama's, oh my gosh, I can't think of his name.
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:21.960]  He comes out and he says, I was the head of Obama's propaganda team.
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:22.960]  And I remember that.
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:26.280]  Obama signs the NDAA making the propaganda legal.
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:27.280]  So what do you think?
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:31.960]  I mean, I think that's another fair point by the caller, yeah, Obama wanted to get propaganda
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:38.080]  out there to get different agendas through whether it be more legalization of homosexual
[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:43.600]  marriage, whether it be more easier tests to get into the military if you want to be
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:44.600]  a woman or whatever.
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:47.760]  But I think that's a fair point to make if that's what he wanted to do, and to use the
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:52.600]  propaganda to do it, which he signed as legal in the NDAA.
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:53.600]  Yeah.
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:53:00.160]  Well, the interesting thing for me was, like again, what really did that accomplish other
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:02.720]  than expand human rights?
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:04.640]  Like I guess, was that his goal?
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:07.560]  I'm trying to understand what he was trying to accomplish with that.
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:11.520]  And what do we see now currently, like how, how is that affected?
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:14.160]  Is it just the advancement of human rights across the board?
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:16.000]  Well, I think he was trying to accomplish.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.600]  I think if you asked someone that, that was a believer in Obama, that's what they would
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.600]  say.
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:25.120]  They'd say, yes, this was an accomplishment for human rights, or, or, but, but that's
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:26.720]  not even what Matthew was saying.
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:30.320]  He was saying that he signed it over that he could put propaganda out there, whatever
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:31.320]  it may be for.
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:35.240]  Well, that was what concerned me too, because again, propaganda, when you start using that
[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:40.920]  term, it's, it's, it's initiative driven propaganda is always going to be driven towards
[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:41.920]  a goal.
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:42.920]  Right.
[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:45.720]  So that's where we come in to the question is, is the goal for human rights?
[01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:49.240]  Or was the goal for, for human destruction?
[01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:53.400]  And that's where people will actually have the debate of what was the true matter of
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:54.400]  the economy.
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:56.920]  It's like this, the, you know, you kind of keep chasing your tail on that one, which,
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:57.920]  which one is it?
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:58.920]  Yeah.
[01:53:58.920 --> 01:53:59.920]  No, that's fair.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:00.920]  But I thought that was a great caller.
[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:03.520]  This is good intellectual conversation here.
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:04.520]  What is the guy's name?
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:05.640]  Crew, have you been, this is going to haunt me.
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:11.560]  I can't even, what was the guy's name who said I was the head of Obama's propaganda
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:12.560]  wing?
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:13.560]  It wasn't Ben Rhodes.
[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:14.560]  Oh my gosh.
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:15.560]  This is going to haunt me.
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:17.560]  It was like, it wasn't, it wasn't recently.
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:18.560]  It was very recent.
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:19.560]  Yeah.
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:20.560]  Because I remember I blew it off because I'm like, what?
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:21.560]  Yeah.
[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:22.560]  Oh my gosh.
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:27.800]  I can't remember the guy's name, but it's like you had, um, um, the, uh, Gruber, Jonathan
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:32.040]  Gruber saying we took advantage of the Americans ignorance by passing Obamacare.
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:34.600]  You know, they didn't realize how badly they got screwed.
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:36.680]  It's the same deal with this other guy.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:37.920]  We're going to find that the crew will find that.
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:38.920]  Let's take another call though.
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:41.680]  Let's go to Jordan calling in from Vermont.
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:42.680]  Go ahead, Jordan.
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:45.680]  This is Obama's biggest accomplishment.
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:48.600]  Uh, his biggest accomplishment, I think, was bringing out more voters.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:54.920]  Obama got a lot of people in that had never really voted before, uh, me being alone.
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:55:01.800]  I'm a registered Democrat and, uh, you know, he really, I think, brought out a lot of new
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:03.400]  people that have never voted before.
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:09.120]  Now, how many times did you vote for Obama just once in 2008 or twice in, uh, 2012 as
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:10.120]  well?
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:11.760]  No, just in 2012.
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:12.760]  Okay.
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:15.600]  And was that the first time you ever voted?
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:16.680]  Yep.
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:17.680]  Are you glad?
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:18.680]  Are you proud of that vote?
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:20.280]  I'm actually not.
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:21.880]  It actually turned out to be a flop.
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:28.440]  I think, you know, it, it started out with a lot of hype and then it was just like nothing,
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:29.440]  you know?
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:36.560]  I'm, I'm curious what, so you say that you were prompted to vote on the second, you know,
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:42.520]  in the, um, the second term and what prompted you to kind of take the initiative to vote
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:43.520]  on the second term?
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:45.400]  Was it just, you were saying there was a lot of hype.
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:46.800]  What hype were you, are you referencing?
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:47.800]  I'm just curious.
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:52.480]  Well, like the whole hope and change thing, I guess I kind of bought into it, you know,
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:57.000]  like, I just wanted to like, you know, see something different happen.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  You know what I mean?
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:02.120]  No, I think that actually Jordan's point is fair where I think a lot of people were like
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:08.000]  Jordan and they said, you know, we do want something different and during Obama's campaign,
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.800]  you got to admit the guy posed as the different.
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:14.600]  I mean, the guy posed as the outside, the guy posed as the guy that wanted to reign in
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:18.000]  the government, of course, did the exact opposite.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.160]  So I think that Jordan makes a fair point here where Obama did drive new voters to the
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:25.160]  polls because they wanted to see a change in government.
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:28.800]  And even though he didn't deliver, I think they went back to the polls and voted for
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:29.800]  Trump.
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:32.000]  Did you go back to the, to the booth and vote for Trump, Jordan?
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  I did.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.800]  I was actually, that was going to be my question, too.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:36.360]  I think a lot of people did that same thing.
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:38.120]  Hey, Jordan, thank you so much for the call.
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:41.120]  I think, did he have something else to say?
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:42.120]  He had two points.
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:43.120]  Go ahead, one more.
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.120]  Go ahead.
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:45.120]  But we got a 60 second, Jordan.
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:48.120]  He also made me believe in magic.
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:49.120]  The magic wand.
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:50.120]  The magic wand.
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:51.120]  Hold on.
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:54.240]  Oh, ollie ollie, option free.
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:55.720]  And then the economy returns.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:58.680]  So, I mean, that's just, I mean, he makes a good point.
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:02.920]  But like you were saying, I think a lot of people had the same faith in Obama say, here's
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:03.920]  a difference maker.
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:05.720]  Here's a guy from the outside who wants to get in.
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:09.480]  He didn't deliver, but they believe Trump was the same guy Trump's actually delivering.
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:10.480]  Well, yeah.
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:16.160]  And here's the thing for me was like, I can't help but like, when you're looking at somebody,
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:21.160]  like a presidential candidate, how, what was it that prompted you to believe that he was
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:22.160]  going to make all these changes?
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:25.000]  Like, yeah, very little, very little experience.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  Pretty unknown overall.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  Yeah.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  Very much unknown.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.800]  And blown away by the, like, like Jordan was saying, all the people that went to the
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:34.640]  voter box, to me, you know, again, gift to gab.
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:35.640]  He was really good at that.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:38.040]  He was really good at telling people what they wanted to hear.
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:40.720]  And he got the, I mean, Jordan was right.
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:42.680]  He got the new voter energized.
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:48.320]  I mean, he did get new voters energized to the polls.
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:53.080]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself

[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:53.600]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is sending
[01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:55.720]  down over the UK.
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:59:01.400]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:03.560]  six months in prison.
[01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:07.360]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:12.120]  CNN and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:17.000]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash young
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:22.640]  people against info wars, psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:23.960]  what we have to say.
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:26.840]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalist.
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:32.440]  It is so critical that you go to info wars.com, forward slash newsletter and sign up for the
[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:36.760]  free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can bully their way
[01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:43.160]  in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society that is critical
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:44.160]  to this fight.
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:51.320]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:59:51.320 --> 02:00:05.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.000]  You found it.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000]  The tip of the spear.
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:13.480]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:19.280]  All right, I've got a video from Paul Joseph Watson, we're going to air here and I just
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:25.720]  want to kind of just cover a quick spat of news before I pitch to that because whenever
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:30.960]  liberals put their fingerprints on something, whether it be the NFL or whether it be Miss
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:35.080]  America pageant, they always have to ruin it and spoil it for the rest of us.
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:39.840]  But real quick, Jared Leto is getting his own Joker movie.
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:43.720]  I'm sorry, Heath Ledger, no pun intended, killed the Joker, quit trying to bring it
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:44.720]  back.
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:51.560]  Han Solo, the Disney movie will lose 50 million plus in the first defeat for Disney Star Wars.
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:55.880]  If Disney's smart, they're going to stop making Star Wars movies except for episode
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:59.920]  nine and then put Star Wars on the shelf for 10 years, but they won't.
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:04.840]  They'll milk this cow for all its worth, which is actually negative $50 million when it comes
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:09.160]  to the solo movie, which had the ever popular Childish Gambino in it.
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:13.680]  And then you had this story from Yahoo going overboard Hollywood's glut of gender swap
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:14.680]  remakes.
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:18.520]  So now every time they do these gender swap remakes, whether it be the Ghostbusters, whether
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:23.440]  it be Oceans 11 with Oceans 8 coming out, they always flop, they always fail.
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:26.800]  And then they cry, oh, it proves America's sexist, they won't watch this.
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:31.760]  But here's Paul Joseph Watson's video on now the Miss America pageant ruined by liberals.
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:35.360]  Just when you thought the world couldn't get any dumber, this happened.
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:39.600]  Now the Miss America organization says it is dedicated to shifting the focus from the
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:42.240]  contestants' bodies to their brains.
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:46.760]  We will no longer judge our candidates on their outward physical appearance.
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:51.720]  Because it's unthinkable that contestants in a beauty pageant should be judged on their
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:53.920]  beauty, God forbid.
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:57.480]  It's going to be what comes out of their mouth that we're interested in when they talk about
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:59.120]  their social impact initiative.
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:02.240]  What comes out of their mouth, really?
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:11.440]  I personally believe that US Americans are unable to do so because some people out there
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:14.400]  in our nation don't have that.
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:22.080]  And I believe that our education, like South Africa and Iraq, everywhere, like, such as.
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:27.520]  People only care what comes out of their mouth when they say something stupid like that.
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:30.960]  We've heard from a lot of young women who say we'd love to be a part of your program,
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:33.640]  but we don't want to be out there in high heels in a swimsuit.
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:34.640]  So guess what?
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:35.760]  You don't have to do that anymore.
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:39.120]  Miss America to no longer be decided on physical appearance.
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:43.800]  What's next, the Super Bowl, to no longer be decided on who scores the most points?
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:49.120]  The women's 100 meters to no longer be decided on who can run 100 meters the quickest, but
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:52.600]  on who can recite feminist slam poetry the quickest?
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:56.680]  How about instead of giving the gold medal to the best Olympic swimmer, we simply give
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:01.080]  it to the best virtue signaler and forget the long jump being decided on.
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:02.440]  Who can jump the longest?
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:07.640]  Just give it to the contestant who can spout the longest list of sanctimonious woke cliches
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:09.360]  about female empowerment.
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:13.720]  And wait, Miss America, isn't that transphobic?
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:17.320]  Isn't that discriminating against fat hairy men who might want to enter?
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:21.920]  Also Miss America sounds pretty xenophobic to me.
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:24.800]  Surely illegal aliens should be allowed to compete too.
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:29.480]  The official Miss America account tweeted an image of a bikini going up in smoke alongside
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:33.760]  the hashtag, bye bye bikini, yeah, more like bye bye your viewers.
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:39.440]  New splash idiots, no one wants to watch frumpy miserable bitches droning on about their patriarchy
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:41.480]  at a beauty pageant.
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:46.400]  Americans are sick to the back teeth of this obsession with inserting social justice into
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:47.560]  everything.
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:51.960]  The NFL did it, their ratings collapsed, the awards ceremonies did it, their ratings collapsed.
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:53.600]  And yours will too.
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:58.320]  People have had it with your puritanical, joyless g-hat against fun.
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:01.640]  We're moving it forward and we're evolving in this cultural revolution.
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:06.200]  Yeah, using the term cultural revolution, which for now meant purging society of its
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:10.480]  traditional elements might not have been the best choice of phrase Gretchen.
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:14.920]  If these women had wanted to be brain surgeons, they'd have done STEM degrees.
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:15.920]  They don't.
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:20.280]  They want to be appreciated for how they look, and that's okay.
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:25.280]  Again, this is Miss America, not my 600 pound life.
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:30.080]  What kind of message does it send to say that being out of shape is some kind of accomplishment?
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:31.080]  It isn't.
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:32.080]  It isn't.
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:33.080]  That's not female empowerment.
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:34.080]  That's harmful.
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:36.080]  But we need better role models for young women.
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:40.360]  Yeah, you know it is possible to live in a world where academic and intellectual role
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:45.640]  models for young women can exist at the same time as hot beauty pageant contestants.
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:50.880]  Oh, but if we allowed that, an army of resentful faties couldn't deprive thousands of attractive
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:55.080]  young women of life opportunities while calling themselves feminists.
[02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:56.080]  Good.
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:05:01.680]  Fueling your body is hard work. That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:04.480]  Digestive Pack to help you fuel it right.

[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:20.120]  Alright, Jeff Gonzalez in studio with me, TridentConcepts.com, a trainer at the range
[02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:27.160]  at Austin, of course, U.S. Navy SEAL as well, so he is in studio with me and we are taking
[02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:32.440]  your calls, well we have been taking your calls on Obama's accomplishments, and I thought
[02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:35.680]  we've actually had fair callers, fair points, it's been a good intellectual debate.
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:40.480]  I wasn't just putting out there for trolling, you'll see that in in due time, I'll just
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:46.080]  leave it at that, but we'll still take your calls here as we move on.
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:49.600]  The crew is doing a little bit of research for me right now when it comes to the ratings
[02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:51.040]  for the Miss America pageant.
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:54.840]  I would imagine, though, now that they're not having a beauty competition for the beauty
[02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:58.920]  competition that the ratings are probably going to sink.
[02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:00.360]  That's kind of common sense, I guess.
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:02.240]  Kind of like the football ratings that sink.
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:06.320]  Yeah, I would say they probably are going hand in hand there.
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:10.040]  It's really strange, you know, hey, whatever, that's how you want to play it, that's how
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:11.800]  you want to play it.
[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:13.320]  Let's see what we've got here.
[02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:18.480]  As Miss America says goodbye to Bikinis, how will ratings and revenue fare?
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:20.600]  Well, here's what's going to happen.
[02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:26.120]  Miss America pageant is either going to be gone within five years, or within two years
[02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:29.600]  they're going to go back to having the Bikini contest.
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:30.680]  And my guess is the latter.
[02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:32.320]  I kind of hope the latter.
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:33.320]  It's an institution.
[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:37.440]  I mean, for what it is, I really think it does good for young ladies, and I would hate
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:38.440]  to see it go away.
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:42.920]  I had friends growing up, Miss Teen, Missouri that competed in beauty, they never complained
[02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:47.840]  about the swimsuit portion or the nightgown portion, and that's the thing with this.
[02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:53.080]  You didn't have the models that are actually walking in the Bikinis complaining.
[02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:55.200]  They weren't the ones that raised an issue to this.
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:08:00.040]  I mean, I don't know many of them, I only know a handful, but they never complained about
[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:01.040]  that at all.
[02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:02.040]  Yeah.
[02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:03.040]  So that's just what you get.
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:05.800]  In the meantime, though, we've still got some callers on the line.
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:11.000]  So let's actually go to Charles in Long Island, who wanted to call in with a second amendment
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.000]  issue.
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.560]  So we'll step aside from the Obama accomplishments for a minute while we're aggregating more
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:16.560]  calls there.
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:20.560]  So let's go to Charles in New York with a second amendment call.
[02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:21.560]  Go ahead.
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:22.560]  Hey, Owen.
[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:23.560]  How are you doing today?
[02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:24.560]  Doing good.
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:30.200]  My question is basically on the overarching conversation of gun control.
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:37.120]  It's often put out there that it's about self-defense, and my point is that it's more about a balance
[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:38.120]  of power.
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:44.320]  It's a check and balance that our forefathers understood was important to instill in the
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:48.840]  citizenry so that we can defend ourselves from the government.
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:54.720]  Well, I think it's both, but you think that's more what they had in mind when they wrote
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:55.720]  the second amendment?
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:56.720]  Is what you're saying?
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:08:57.720]  Yeah.
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:59.480]  I mean, I don't think it's about guns.
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:05.280]  And I think we often get in our debates with liberals, we get dragged down in talking about
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:10.560]  guns and how they're useful for self-defense, and you need a shotgun, or this is better
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:11.560]  or that's better.
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:12.560]  It's not about guns.
[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:18.480]  It's about balancing the power between the civilian population and the government.
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:19.480]  And that's why-
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:23.640]  Well, I think here's the problem we have with this topic that you're bringing up, Charles,
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:28.720]  is because the average person will say, oh, what?
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:30.640]  You think the government's going to come to your house?
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:32.560]  You think the government's going to come to your front door?
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:33.920]  You think the government's the biggest threat?
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:37.120]  And it's like, well, maybe I believe that, maybe I don't.
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:42.360]  But if you look at history, it has happened before, and we want to avoid that happening.
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:43.360]  Why is that so crazy?
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:47.720]  I think the other part about that is the fact that we have it ensures that we don't have
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:49.120]  to worry about it.
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:50.120]  Bingo.
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:55.280]  The argument is kind of like null and void because we're not going to worry about it
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:57.880]  because that exists for that reason.
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:00.560]  We don't have to worry about it.
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:05.160]  The phrase was when the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:09.480]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:10.600]  That's how the saying goes.
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:11.600]  Anything else, Charles?
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:18.200]  I know during World War II, the gun behind every blade of grass was meant that that had
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:21.480]  to do with the power of the citizens.
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:27.040]  Well, and again, I never even thought about it like that, where the reason why we don't
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:31.320]  have a government that will go door to door and do gun confiscation or whatever is because
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:32.800]  they know we're all armed.
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:33.800]  And it's like the same thing.
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:34.800]  And people say, you're crazy.
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:38.960]  Well, maybe one of the reasons why we haven't had a land invasion is because people know
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:40.480]  we're all armed.
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:47.400]  And I mean, I agree with 100%, there is definitely, we were talking during the break about the
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:54.440]  different mindsets throughout the world, but that is a fundamental issue that many people
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:11:00.080]  realize that there is a large volume of firearm ownership in the United States.
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:03.560]  And as a result, they don't know that's the game changer.
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:05.400]  That's the ace up our sleeve.
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:10.000]  That's probably going to ensure land invasion is really never part of our history.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.960]  And I think it would ensure that even if the government were to call for some sort of door
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:21.360]  to door confiscation or any oppression using weapons, that the average service member is
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:24.840]  going to lay down their arms and be a citizen again, because they know I ain't going to
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:25.840]  this death trap.
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:28.920]  I know there's going to be some of these citizens as soon as I come to their door with a gun,
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:31.720]  I'm probably going to get shot if it should come to that.
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:35.520]  Which I don't think, I mean, there's threats to that and we've seen clues and signs.
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:39.240]  The NDAA, which one of the callers said earlier was one of the threats to that, but I think
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:42.480]  where we're standing right now, there seems to be a better relationship there as far as
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:44.760]  it's concerned.
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:48.800]  But I think that that's a fair point to bring up and to discuss when discussing the second
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:51.400]  amendment that we just don't have that conversation enough.
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:52.960]  All right, so here's what we're going to do.
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:54.480]  Thank you for the call, Charles.
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:12:00.000]  I've got three callers right now that are going to call in about Obama accomplishments,
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.280]  but we're going to take those calls in the next segment.
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:07.720]  So stay tuned and we'll get to those calls in the next segment.
[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:11.320]  Real quick though, I just want to hit these two stories.
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:16.360]  We've got McCabe seeks immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony and congressional
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:17.360]  hearing.
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:18.360]  Now, this is bombshell.
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:23.760]  To me, this says Andrew McCabe willing to sing, willing to expose all the crimes of
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:28.800]  the Obama administration as long as he doesn't go to jail.
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:30.480]  That's what that headline means to me.
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:31.480]  What do you think, Jeff?
[02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:37.520]  Wow, man, that could be, I mean, that could be like the little thread that starts to unravel
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:38.520]  that whole mess.
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:45.360]  I mean, I got to say, I'm almost, I'm curious as to what he would be willing to say if he
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:47.360]  was granted immunity.
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:49.480]  I would say it's almost worth it.
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:56.200]  Well, I think the big thing would be that Obama knew Obama was behind it and then maybe
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:13:01.880]  you find out who knows what McCabe knows as far as all of the timing between the FISA
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:06.240]  court and the fake dossier and the exchange of information there.
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:13.040]  But it can all be tied together by Glenn Simpson, who has also agreed to testify in exchange
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:14.040]  for immunity.
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:19.560]  So now you've got two main factors with Glenn Simpson from Fusion GPS, which got paid by
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:21.680]  Hillary Clinton for the fake dossier.
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:26.880]  Then you have Andrew McCabe, who was in the FBI working with the Obama administration
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:29.960]  in response to that fake dossier to spy on the Trump campaign.
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:32.520]  So those two elements could bring the whole thing down.
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:41.600]  Well, not just that, but if they are granted immunity, who's to say that a whole just fleet
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:43.160]  of individuals come forward?
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:44.920]  Oh, you're willing to grant immunity, huh?
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:46.680]  Yeah, well, I'll be willing to spill the beans.
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:51.880]  So that's why I'm kind of curious to see what McCabe has to say, and if we'd be willing
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:56.560]  to give him that immunity, because I really do feel like that would be a domino, just
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:13:58.040]  one after the other.
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:02.920]  Meanwhile, more dominoes are falling out from the Iran deal.
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:07.480]  Senate report says Obama officials gave Iran access to U.S. financial system.
[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:09.720]  Oh, but it was just brief.
[02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:15.120]  So just give me the code to your ATM card, just briefly, just one time, just give me
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:16.120]  your code to your ATM card.
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:17.120]  It'll be brief.
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:20.000]  Just give me all your bank, your bank routing number, your account number.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:23.560]  I'm just going to make one transaction, just a brief one single, nothing big.
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:28.320]  So I'm sure there's nothing to see here about Obama giving Iran access to the U.S. financial
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:29.320]  system.
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:33.200]  You know, the billions of dollars that he promised to give them, the cash that he flew
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:36.840]  out there on pallets, you know, it's all fine and dandy.
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:39.000]  I'm sure there's nothing to see here.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.320]  So who knows, maybe more dominoes start to fall, but this is the scandal-free Obama.
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:46.280]  In the next segment, though, we're going to take more callers talking about Obama's
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:47.280]  accomplishments.
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:48.280]  If you can believe that.
[02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:51.680]  Actually, we've had some good callers on that.
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:53.040]  We've got a video coming.
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:58.520]  We've got some reporters out today that'll be more of the type of response you're expecting
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:00.400]  when you ask people from Obama's accomplishments.
[02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:01.400]  So we're working on that.

[02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:43.360]  What were Obama's accomplishments?
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:45.880]  So far, they don't even stack up.
[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:48.040]  You couldn't even see them next to Trump's accomplishments.
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:49.040]  Trump's accomplishments are up here.
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:50.040]  You're like, where are Obama's?

[02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:22.280]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:30.080]  Now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:33.200]  Okay, so we now, I can now tell you, I'll tease it.
[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:37.600]  I'm not sure if it'll be ready for the Jones Show, but it'll definitely be on the War Room,
[02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:41.720]  which starts at three with Roger Stone and Rob Dew, normally where I am from three to
[02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:46.160]  six, but with Alex Jones on vacation, I am doing fill-in duties here to the best of my
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:47.400]  abilities.
[02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:54.600]  We sent a reporter out to ask people in Austin, Texas, what are Obama's accomplishments?
[02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:58.720]  Savannah Hernandez went out and asked people in Austin, Texas about that.
[02:20:58.720 --> 02:21:02.760]  The responses that we got were the type of responses you would expect.
[02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:05.960]  That video is being edited and it will be out soon.
[02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:08.180]  If we have it ready for the Jones Show, we'll debut it here.
[02:21:08.180 --> 02:21:12.760]  If not, definitely look for it at the Alex Jones channel on YouTube and on the War Room
[02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:15.880]  live from three to six p.m.
[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:19.640]  But what we've been doing here on air, I think, has been good taking these callers.
[02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:22.040]  You've had some fair points about Obama's accomplishments.
[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:27.760]  You've had kind of some tongue-in-cheek, maybe accomplishments mentioned here, but we're
[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:30.200]  going to get more into this as we go on here.
[02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:32.360]  So let's go back out to the phone lines.
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:35.280]  Let's go to Ed in California.
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:36.760]  Go ahead, Ed.
[02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:37.760]  Hello?
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:38.760]  Hey.
[02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:39.760]  Hello?
[02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:44.760]  Ed, what are Obama's accomplishments?
[02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:49.000]  No, drop him.
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.000]  We can't do this, bud.
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.240]  There's a live program.
[02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:53.160]  I can't wait for you.
[02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:55.600]  Let's go to Travis in Florida.
[02:21:55.600 --> 02:21:58.320]  Travis, what were Obama's accomplishments?
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:00.800]  Hello, Owen.
[02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:02.160]  How are you doing today?
[02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:03.160]  Just fine.
[02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:10.840]  I first want to say I own an AK-47, a 9-millimeter Beretta, a 40-caliber Beretta, a 44-magnum
[02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:17.960]  Ruger, so I'm not really that liberal, but I would say that don't you think that ordering
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:22.600]  the capture and killing of Osama bin Laden was pretty good?
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:26.760]  I would say that'd be a great accomplishment if it were true.
[02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:28.240]  Oh, OK.
[02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:29.440]  So he didn't?
[02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:30.440]  No.
[02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:34.840]  Osama bin Laden was dead before that, and the whole thing of him being tossed over the
[02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:37.200]  boat was a stage.
[02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:39.520]  Obama staged that in order to-
[02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:43.800]  It was all false flag, so we don't- OK, so, all right, so we don't believe that.
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:45.160]  I personally don't believe that.
[02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:46.560]  I personally don't believe that.
[02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:50.880]  You're saying you believe that Obama was the genius behind capturing and killing bin
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:54.320]  Laden?
[02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:58.960]  I can't believe you're saying it was a false flag, and it's totally fake, so it's a complete
[02:22:58.960 --> 02:22:59.960]  conspiracy.
[02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:01.240]  No, no, no, no.
[02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:05.960]  It was staged for Obama to win political points.
[02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:06.960]  Did you-
[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:09.920]  I'm just saying that Obama, so he didn't kill Osama.
[02:23:09.920 --> 02:23:10.920]  I mean-
[02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:12.840]  OK, well, let's be perfectly clear.
[02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:14.800]  Obama did not kill Osama bin Laden.
[02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:19.040]  If anybody killed Osama bin Laden, it was probably Navy SEALs or Marines or Special
[02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:21.680]  Officers or something, so let's just be clear about that.
[02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:23.080]  OK, of course.
[02:23:23.080 --> 02:23:24.680]  Yes, OK, yeah.
[02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:32.400]  But yes, I believe that the killing of Osama bin Laden was a staged event to gain political
[02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:37.960]  points for Barack Hussein Obama, and if you look at the details of that day and what they
[02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:41.000]  did with the body, I mean, did you ever see bin Laden's body?
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:44.160]  Did you ever see proof of the capture?
[02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:45.720]  I saw pictures of his body.
[02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:50.440]  Yeah, I did, online, that body.
[02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:56.320]  And do they normally just toss bodies overboard on a boat into the sea for terrorists like
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:57.320]  that?
[02:23:57.320 --> 02:24:00.400]  Yeah, because they didn't want to have a place for-
[02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:05.760]  They didn't want to plant him somewhere where it'd be a giant spiritual place for people
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:06.760]  to come to.
[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:07.760]  I, you know-
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:09.480]  What, you mean like Libya with Gaddafi?
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:12.960]  I'm sorry, man, it's a complete conspiracy.
[02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:18.320]  So really, Obama, I mean, so who killed bin Laden?
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:24.400]  Like I said, if anybody killed bin Laden in the U.S. operation, it would be Marines, SEALs,
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:27.360]  Special Operations, but who knows who killed bin Laden?
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:32.560]  Bin Laden was a U.S. operative originally before he was the terrorist that we labeled
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:35.720]  responsible for the 9-11 attacks, which I also believe was a lie.
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:36.720]  But you know what?
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:37.720]  You can hold right there, Travis.
[02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:40.960]  Let's get, let's get Jess take on this, who's actually a U.S. Navy SEAL.
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:41.960]  What do you think?
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:42.960]  Am I crazy on this?
[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:47.080]  Do you believe that it was Osama bin Laden he died during Obama years, or Obama ordered
[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:48.080]  that?
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:49.800]  Well, yes, I do.
[02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:59.760]  I do believe that the U.S. military acted in concert to bring to justice a known terrorist.
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:04.840]  I do agree that he was part of our, you know, he was on our payroll at a certain point.
[02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:09.520]  I do understand that he also was responsible for several other incidences, but as far as
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:11.080]  my belief, I do.
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:15.600]  Okay, so do you think it's fair then for Travis to tout the killing of Osama bin Laden
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:19.000]  as an accomplishment for the Obama administration?
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:26.480]  I wouldn't necessarily agree with that completely because, unfortunately, there was a lot of
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:29.880]  work that went into that, and it's difficult to label that.
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:33.880]  It's difficult to pin that on one individual, and in particular, the president is like his
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:34.880]  greatest accomplishment.
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:36.000]  I would not necessarily say that.
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:39.680]  I think the accomplishment should be shared by the Department of Defense, the Department
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:44.960]  of State, all the individuals that were out there that made it their life's mission to
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:49.080]  find and, in a sense, bring justice back to the United States.
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:54.320]  Now I'm going to get real down the rabbit hole now, since we're already on this conversation.
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:56.200]  Let's bring Travis back in.
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:26:00.680]  Now why would killing Osama bin Laden be such a great accomplishment?
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:04.880]  Well, we're told he's the mastermind behind September 11, 2001.
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:09.640]  So Travis, do you believe that Osama bin Laden was the mastermind behind September 11 attacks?
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:14.440]  Yeah, I believe pretty much the official story, but it was mostly Saudis.
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:18.520]  So where did Trump go, the first overseas trip?
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:22.160]  Okay, well, that's Saudi Arabia, but now you're going down, and hold on.
[02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:24.960]  Let's bring it back home, bring it back home.
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:30.120]  You mentioned the Saudi Arabians, okay, so magically, you have the Twin Towers collapse
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:32.400]  and Building 7 for no apparent reason.
[02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:38.920]  You have an stack of rubble with liquid lava that remained there for two years, the longest
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:44.360]  you've ever had a pool of lava, and somehow, magically, you have eight Saudi Arabian passports
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:46.080]  on top of this stack of rubble.
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:47.080]  I guess that's magic.
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:52.920]  I mean, we did have a caller say he believes in magic, but I'm curious, again, look, everyone's
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:53.920]  opinion is welcome here.
[02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:55.520]  Me and Jeff don't have to agree on everything.
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:27:00.400]  Do you think Osama bin Laden was responsible for masterminding the September 11 attacks?
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:06.120]  The information that I have seen, the reports that I did review, I do believe that he had
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:07.520]  an integral part in it all.
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:09.520]  I don't believe that he pulled it off on his own.
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:14.840]  I do believe that there were other forces in play, but I do believe that he was the
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:22.280]  major player within that entire, I mean, that was not a simple, that was not a simple
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:23.640]  event to pull off.
[02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:27.000]  There was a lot of players in that, as far as I'm concerned.
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:32.200]  Okay, Travis, I'll give you 30 seconds to get a final word in here before we move on.
[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:35.400]  That's great that you, that we agree 100%.
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:41.120]  But you always talk about building, I mean, World Trade Center 1, 2, and 7.
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:44.040]  What about 3, 4, 5, and 6?
[02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:47.000]  Do you realize all of those buildings were destroyed?
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.200]  A destroyed, what do you mean exactly?
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:52.200]  They were all destroyed.
[02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:54.080]  They had to tear them all down.
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:55.080]  They were destroyed.
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:28:00.440]  Yeah, but they didn't collapse that day like a planned demolition like Building 7 did.
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:03.960]  Yeah, but the argument is always two planes.
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:08.080]  How could two planes take out three buildings?
[02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:10.840]  Two planes took out seven buildings.
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:12.640]  Well, first of all, hold on a second.
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:13.640]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:18.040]  Two planes took out two buildings and then the rubble from a building destroyed buildings
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:19.040]  around it.
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:21.000]  But, but, but that's not what we're saying.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:25.080]  Building 7, did you, have you seen the footage of Building 7 falling?
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:28.520]  Yeah, building, come on man.
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:30.760]  That's been over and done with.
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:33.200]  That's a planned demolition, bro.
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:36.560]  Now you can say, if you want to make the point that they did that because they thought it
[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:39.080]  was going to come down anyway, that's fair enough.
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:43.280]  But don't tell me that's not a planned demolition and how do you get the right parts in for
[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:47.280]  the planned demolition like that in the matter of hours during a terror attack?
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:48.280]  But maybe I'm crazy.
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:49.280]  Hey, I'm just one opinion.
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:50.280]  Everyone's opinions welcome here.
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:55.600]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:56.600]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:28:58.160]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:28:59.720]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:02.520]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:04.760]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:08.560]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:09.560]  case.

[02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:32.480]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine
[02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:36.120]  disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[02:29:36.120 --> 02:29:38.080]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:03.200]  Thanks for holding.
[02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:06.920]  Hey, I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:12.040]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen
[02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:16.600]  and it had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and
[02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:21.000]  read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using

[02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:33.840]  Thank you, brother.
[02:30:33.840 --> 02:30:37.600]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:42.000]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more
[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:47.120]  you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God and I wanted to say that

[02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:18.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:32.440]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones show, Owen Schroyer here filling in while
[02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:34.120]  Alex is on vacation.
[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:40.240]  In studio with me, Jeff Gonzalez, US Navy SEAL, tridentconcepts.com, an instructor at
[02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:42.880]  the range at Austin here in Austin, Texas.
[02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:46.080]  We're having a lot of good conversations and you know, it's funny because people, it's
[02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:49.360]  like if you don't agree with everything your guest says, you're fighting, it's like, no,
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:52.960]  we're just having conversations here, we get callers, call in different ideas, we have
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:53.960]  debates.
[02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:57.360]  It's all fair, it's all fun, and we're all Americans at the end of the day, but Rob
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:34:01.640]  Dew wanted to come in and comment on a very controversial subject that we were talking
[02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:07.240]  about last, last segment about the killing of Osama bin Laden, and then he may want to
[02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:11.320]  comment on the 9-11 thing too, but he specifically wanted to come on with Osama bin Laden.
[02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:16.760]  There were a lot of anomalies to the official story, Rob Dew, you were pointing out one
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:18.280]  that really stuck out to you.
[02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:23.080]  Well, I remember doing a lot of research and collecting the articles as they were coming
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:27.320]  in and there were numerous Navy SEALs that were disagreeing with the official story that
[02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:28.320]  was going out there.
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:30.040]  They said, no, that's not what happened, this happened.
[02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:33.240]  And then another guy came out and said, here's a new book I've written, that's not what happened,
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:34.240]  this happened.
[02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:35.240]  Yeah, wasn't that Mark Owen?
[02:34:35.240 --> 02:34:36.240]  No easy day.
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:37.240]  That was the first one.
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:41.440]  And then there were two more books that had different stories.
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:44.440]  And then one was written by Navy SEAL Rob, who claims to be the guy who fired the kill
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:45.440]  shot.
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:46.440]  And isn't he dead now?
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:51.440]  No, I don't think Rob, I don't remember Rob's last name, but that Navy SEAL is still alive
[02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:52.440]  as far as I know.
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:58.800]  Well, wasn't there a helicopter accident that had 27 SEALs on it that were involved in the
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:01.000]  actual raid of bin Laden's compound?
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:02.360]  There was a helicopter crash.
[02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:06.060]  We don't, with that kind of got covered up, like what was that, how did they get those
[02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:07.060]  guys out?
[02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:08.520]  That was a drill.
[02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:10.760]  There's a lot of things going on there that don't make sense.
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:13.760]  And then after they said they buried him at sea, then they said, no, we actually didn't
[02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:15.640]  bury him at sea.
[02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:22.280]  And you have Madeleine Albright coming out, I think in the early 2000s, like 2004, 2005,
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:25.240]  and saying we had him on ice and we're waiting to bring him out.
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:26.960]  That was a statement she made.
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:28.400]  These guys could probably find that.
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:35.920]  And then there, you go back to July, 2001, CIA agents met with Osama bin Laden in a hospital
[02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:39.080]  in Dubai where he was undergoing dialysis.
[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:44.120]  So you're telling me he's trucking around a dialysis machine through Torobora for months
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:47.120]  on end.
[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:49.880]  I think Doug Sando calls him the Big Foot of Terrorist.
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:50.880]  Everybody sees him.
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:53.160]  He does all this stuff, but nobody can find him.
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:56.360]  And then they magically find him in 2011.
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:35:58.880]  It's BS.
[02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:01.640]  He had a lot of health problems.
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:03.680]  And the Bushes traveled with the bin Laden's.
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:05.480]  They worked with the bin Laden's.
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:08.120]  They knew this was, you know, that I'm sorry.
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:09.120]  And there it is.
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:10.120]  There's a 2011 article.
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:13.440]  Inside sources bin Laden's corpse has been on ice for nearly a decade.
[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:18.600]  And then they let's not forget that it was a, what was the guy's name, a lockie or someone
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:22.520]  that met with the Bush administration the day before 9 11.
[02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:28.120]  I think he dined after on war a lockie who then, then Obama droned him and his son.
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:33.080]  So here's the, and so let's just look at another story that we haven't got the full
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:34.080]  thing.
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:36.200]  There was a massacre that happened in Vegas.
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:39.720]  Well now it comes, turns out that there were three women in the hotel with the guy.
[02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:40.720]  Never heard that.
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:44.360]  So once we start finding a little hole in the story, it's like, how can we trust anything
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:45.360]  you're saying?
[02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:47.240]  And I'm not disrespecting the soldiers.
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:50.000]  Hey, maybe they thought they were going into kill Osama bin Laden.
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  Maybe that's what they were told.
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:52.000]  I don't know.
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:56.920]  And according to the accounts that I've read, you know, they're going into this compound.
[02:36:56.920 --> 02:36:58.240]  It's not well lit.
[02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:01.680]  You know, they're kind of going into these rooms, getting shot at some, some of them
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:02.680]  are women.
[02:37:02.680 --> 02:37:04.080]  They don't really know what they're dealing with.
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:07.800]  So they're just kind of in, in action mode, you know, extracting whatever they have to
[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:10.480]  extract in, in the fight or flight mode.
[02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:11.480]  Exactly.
[02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:15.520]  And they were also, they were worried about people coming in and attacking them from
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:16.520]  the outside.
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:18.280]  So there was a lot of stuff going on in that operation.
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:20.040]  I believe an operation took place.
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:21.040]  I'm not doubting that.
[02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:22.040]  There was a crash helicopter.
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:24.440]  You can see pieces of it in the photos.
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:25.920]  I'm not doubting any of that stuff.
[02:37:25.920 --> 02:37:29.760]  I'm not doubting that maybe Osama bin Laden's family members were living there, but I don't
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:33.280]  know if that's, if the guy, I don't believe the guy that they killed or that they claimed
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:34.280]  they killed was Osama bin Laden.
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:37.720]  Well, and let me, let's just, let's just zoom out again real quick before we get Jeff's
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:38.720]  take on this.
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:39.720]  Again, he's a Navy SEAL.
[02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:45.280]  So, so he, he can speak to some of this as well, obviously, JFK's assassination.
[02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:50.840]  You get the official story for 50 years for 50 years and you're called a conspiracy theorist.
[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:55.120]  If you don't believe it, Trump gets an office, declassifies hundreds and hundreds of these
[02:37:55.120 --> 02:37:58.080]  files from the JFK assassination reports.
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:02.680]  You find out the CIA has operatives in the media running Operation Mockingbird to lie
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:03.840]  about what happened.
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:08.080]  You find out the CIA and the FBI reported on multiple shooters at the time.
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:14.040]  And so, so it's all about just not believing the original story, knowing the history that
[02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:17.720]  the government lies about it for whatever reason, for whatever reason you want to say.
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:19.760]  But that's just the truth of the matter.
[02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:22.760]  But Jeff, you know, what, what, what is your take on this conversation?
[02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:29.880]  Well, as far as all of the, the, the conflict as far as what the actual account is, I don't
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:32.080]  know if we're ever going to know what the actual account is.
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:37.560]  I mean, there's methods and procedures that are not going to be released as a result of,
[02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:39.560]  of the, of that event.
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:45.080]  There was a lot of technology that was put in place to ensure we had the highest chance
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:46.080]  of success.
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:47.080]  I mean, you saw it with the helicopters and their,
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:50.720]  So would you say, and I want you to go on with this, like some of the movies where they,
[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:53.680]  they make these movies and act like they're showing you everything, you're saying you're
[02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:55.480]  really not getting the full picture?
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:39:00.600]  Well, that's another thing that I have a big beef about is how, I think her name was Bigelow
[02:39:00.600 --> 02:39:07.800]  Catherine Bigelow, that was the director for third block 30, she was granted almost unprecedented
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:12.800]  access to material that should never have seen the light of day by the Obama administration.
[02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:15.120]  So I have, I have a beef with that.
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:19.640]  But it was, yeah, I do believe that there's, there's material that's out there that is
[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:25.440]  probably not going to come to the surface for a while that may create the confusion about
[02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:26.440]  what really happened.
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:31.240]  I do believe that the operation went down as flawlessly as it could have gone.
[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:35.920]  I do believe that they had, I mean, for what they accomplished, it was a huge success both
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:37.920]  for our US military and the country as a whole.
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:42.200]  And they did take out a bunch of hard drives and stuff from that raid too.
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:46.480]  Still that we are benefiting from that material is going to benefit.
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:51.760]  I mean, again, it just gave us access to the inner workings of a web that for, for, you
[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:54.840]  know, for a very long time we couldn't penetrate.
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:40:01.920]  The bottom line to me is that it brought home closure to a big gash that we had when 9-11
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:02.920]  occurred.
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:07.120]  And again, you know, there's all kinds of different angles and points to talk about
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:08.460]  with this.
[02:40:08.460 --> 02:40:12.160]  But my biggest thing is, you know, call me a conspiracy theorist.
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:13.160]  I'm sorry.
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:14.160]  I don't trust the government.
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:17.240]  You know, it's nothing personal against people inside the government.
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:18.800]  It's just a fact that they've been lying to us.
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:22.120]  They lied to us about the Gulf of Tonkin that led to the war in Vietnam.
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:24.360]  So it's like, they'll lie about anything then.
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:27.320]  If they'll lie about something like that to get us to war, they'll lie about anything.
[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:29.960]  Rob, do with us for two minutes for the remainder of this segment.
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:30.960]  Anything else, Rob?
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:34.280]  Well, I agree with your sentiments.
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:38.120]  Once you start finding holes in these stories, you have to go, well, what else are they hiding?
[02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:39.760]  What else are they keeping from us?
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:42.840]  Maybe they're claiming it's for national security.
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:47.480]  That's fine, but don't come out and trot these stories out and then claim them as gospel.
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:50.200]  Like the guy called, who called in and said he saw photos.
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:51.280]  Those were doctored photos.
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:55.480]  That was a dead terrorist that they mixed on half of Osamban Lan's face.
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:57.920]  That's, that's well known that that came out.
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:02.840]  So, but that stays in the, in the mindset of, in fact, we haven't pulled up right here.
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:06.560]  You could see where they took different faces and composite and I'm watching one of the
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:12.000]  guys pull it up and so, but that goes out there and then that becomes the meme.
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:13.320]  That becomes, oh, we have him.
[02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:14.320]  Here he is.
[02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:15.320]  He's dead.
[02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:16.320]  We got him.
[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:17.840]  So, yeah, I totally agree.
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:19.440]  You can't, I don't think they got him on that day.
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:20.920]  I think they got some body double.
[02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:24.240]  The guy also, the pictures that they showed, the guy was left-handed and I think of Osamban
[02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:28.200]  Lan's right-handed, right-handed or something that he was holding the remote control.
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:33.200]  That old, that old guy that they claim was, I guess watching a week in a Bernie's DVDs
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:34.200]  or something.
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:40.360]  So, again, I like having the debate, honestly.
[02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:41.360]  I do too.
[02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:45.360]  I'd rather, I'd rather have a debate and then, then just sit here and take whatever
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:47.880]  the media or the government tells me as gospel.
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:52.120]  I think that's the healthiest thing when it comes to this, but, you know, when it comes
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:55.920]  to, you know, dealing with other seals and special operations that actually have to live
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:42:00.840]  through this, Jeff, I mean, I would imagine most of them really would probably rather
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:01.840]  not talk about it.
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:05.320]  I mean, maybe you write a book for whatever reason, but I mean, what is your sentiment
[02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:09.320]  just upon, you know, talking about these operations and these things?
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:14.120]  Well, I personally and professionally am against it.
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:20.760]  I, you know, I grew up in that era that we were referenced as the silent professionals.
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:24.520]  You know, we went in, did our job, nobody really knew what we were doing.
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:28.960]  If the public found out what we were doing, then we had, we had failed in some way.
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:35.040]  So, I do support my teammates that are trying to move in a different direction.
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:37.040]  I don't agree with their methods.
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:40.640]  I don't like seeing our community thrown out into the public eye.
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:46.640]  I feel it's much better for us to do what we do, which people were really concerned about
[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:51.200]  with Hillary Clinton's classified email and national security information being out there.
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:55.240]  How many assets got outed because of that compromise?
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:43:00.520]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:06.040]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:12.520]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:18.400]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:21.720]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:26.640]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:33.000]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:36.560]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:41.320]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[02:43:41.320 --> 02:43:47.120]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:49.800]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:55.360]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:47.080]  can be in contact with you, so the sensors can bully their way in and block us being

[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:01.200]  in FoWarsLife.
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:02.720]  It'd take hours.
[02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:08.000]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price, it's stronger, it's the other equation in probiotics,
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.360]  it knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida, it's back in stock.
[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:15.560]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:19.000]  It's got the preglonone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body,
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:23.400]  then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids, so you can upload it.
[02:46:23.400 --> 02:46:28.600]  Our latest product that goes great with the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine 4-5

[02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:35.240]  it.
[02:46:35.240 --> 02:46:40.240]  It's a supplement with Iodine, a super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:45.520]  Without you, we couldn't do it, so thank you all for remembering InfoWars.com and remembering
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:49.640]  that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and
[02:46:49.640 --> 02:46:51.200]  it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:59.920]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:16.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:30.240]  All right, it's been great fun here with Jeff Gonzales in studio, Navy Seal TridentConcepts.com
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:35.560]  and an instructor here at the range at Austin, if you want to get some firearm instructions
[02:47:35.560 --> 02:47:38.760]  with him, that's where you would go check that out.
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:41.600]  Real quick, I want to plug through some of these news stories we haven't got to and then
[02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:46.760]  we're going to take Dr. Kelly in California and Michael in Kansas on their Obama accomplishments
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:51.800]  but let me just plug through this again, this is huge news, GOP Senate report says Obama
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:57.400]  officials gave Iran access to U.S. financial system, why was Obama basically working for
[02:47:57.400 --> 02:47:58.400]  Iran?
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:01.120]  Obama did more for Iran almost than the United States.
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:05.800]  I mean, it's almost you could call in and say Obama's greatest accomplishment was working
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:08.400]  for Iran and maybe you like that, okay?
[02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:12.800]  It is ironic, nobody pouts Obamacare as an Obama accomplishment.
[02:48:12.800 --> 02:48:16.680]  It's funny how that works, how Obamacare, the thing he put his name on, nobody even
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:18.760]  touts that as an accomplishment.
[02:48:18.760 --> 02:48:23.600]  Here's bombshell, McCabe seeks immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony and
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:28.760]  congressional hearings, some of the rats are starting to leave the sinking ship and they're
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:33.400]  going to name names to keep themselves out of prison probably.
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:38.120]  Facebook gave data access to Chinese firm flagged by U.S. intelligence as a national
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:39.120]  security threat.
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:44.240]  It's time for Zuckerberg to testify again, this time under oath, he lied and got away
[02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:48.920]  with it last time but that's because he was not under oath and he knew it.
[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:57.000]  Here's some news from the apocalypse, massive cloud of flying midges descends on Cleveland,
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:04.240]  so massive it shows up on weather radar, okay, again just news of the apocalypse here, run,
[02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:10.040]  it's coming, let's go, dramatic moment, truck swallowed by an ash cloud as villagers flee,
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:15.800]  1300 Fahrenheit, pyroclastic flows from Guatemala's volcano of fire, which has killed at least
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:17.960]  69, it's probably more than that.
[02:49:17.960 --> 02:49:20.720]  You look at, guys, you should pull up the store at Daily Mail and look at some of these
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:28.600]  images, wow, I mean, seriously, like, wow, these images from that volcano in Guatemala,
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:32.840]  just not, really not too far south of America, folks.
[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:36.400]  Why does Yellowstone Steamboat Geyser keep erupting?
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:41.720]  The Yellowstone Steamboat Geyser usually doesn't erupt at this rate, now it is just, it's
[02:49:41.720 --> 02:49:48.360]  erupting more now than it did in its 15 years prior, scientists don't have an option, yeah,
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:53.200]  they're going through some of these images right now from the volcano in Guatemala, of
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:57.360]  course you got the earthquakes in Mexico, earthquakes in Hawaii, it's crazy, and then
[02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:01.560]  maybe not a sign of the apocalypse but maybe a sign Grand Theft Auto, come to life.
[02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:06.680]  Geyser leads cops on chase after stealing armored vehicle, if you haven't seen this
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:12.400]  one, this guy, he leads the police on a 65 mile chase, he's in this fully armored tank-like
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:15.720]  vehicle, it's not, it doesn't have the, you know, the guns and the cannons sticking out
[02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:22.040]  of it but it flies over 45 miles per hour, just crazy stuff there.
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:25.840]  This is a story that needed, should have been addressed years ago, now finally the Wall
[02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:31.800]  Street Journal and others are covering an upgrade, America's 19th century electric grid, it is
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:36.400]  vulnerable to terrorism, blackouts and solar flares, I remember George Nore and Alex Jones
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:42.320]  making a big deal of this in 2014, now other media outlets picking it up, Brad Parscale
[02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:47.840]  who we all love when he attacks the tech left, tweets this out yesterday, it is time for
[02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:52.800]  America to have a single 5G network for all carriers, the days have dropped calls, slow
[02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:57.000]  speeds and no service need to end, it is time for the U.S. to have the world's best sell
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:01.600]  service, well I'd rather not have the world's best sell service if that means the 5G is
[02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:06.480]  going to zap us all to death, so let's actually have a debate on the health implications of
[02:51:06.480 --> 02:51:12.760]  5G before we just decide to roll it out and you have the Wall Street Journal admitting
[02:51:12.760 --> 02:51:18.480]  that the climate change political issue has run its course, it doesn't work for the left
[02:51:18.480 --> 02:51:23.480]  anymore, and now maybe they're going to start addressing the plastic calamity, they're saying
[02:51:23.480 --> 02:51:26.920]  the planet is on the edge of a plastic calamity, hey at least with that you can go out to
[02:51:26.920 --> 02:51:30.080]  the ocean and prove it, you can go out to the ocean and see all the trash in the ocean,
[02:51:30.080 --> 02:51:34.640]  so at least that's something visible you can look at, alright, myself, Jeff Gonzalez,
[02:51:34.640 --> 02:51:38.920]  we're going to take your calls here, let's go to Dr. Kelly in California, go ahead Dr.
[02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:39.920]  Kelly.
[02:51:39.920 --> 02:51:45.320]  Right on, thank you so much Owen, you're like the decathlete of investigative reporting
[02:51:45.320 --> 02:51:51.920]  and journalism and you're on fire and I want to plug four info wars store, either buy a
[02:51:51.920 --> 02:51:57.320]  filter or be a filter, there's nothing like getting a full night of beauty sleep inside
[02:51:57.320 --> 02:52:03.000]  filtered air and if you can take it and you need it, get some knockout.
[02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:08.600]  You guys are the manna that God has sent down from heaven, you're the marines, the air force,
[02:52:08.600 --> 02:52:14.440]  the navy and the army and I'm really stoked to be on the call with you guys today, your
[02:52:14.440 --> 02:52:20.320]  questions are so provocative and so inspiring that while I was on hold, I made a laundry
[02:52:20.320 --> 02:52:23.200]  list of 20 things that I could touch on.
[02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:26.280]  Well, unfortunately you're going to have to do it quickly because we're running out of
[02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:27.280]  time here.
[02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:31.520]  I know you always give me like 20 seconds, so the greatest accomplishments of Obama
[02:52:31.520 --> 02:52:36.880]  is why we should never have a bar attorney occupying an office of the public trust, he
[02:52:36.880 --> 02:52:42.320]  devoured widow's houses, he divided the land for gain, he shed innocent blood, he rolled
[02:52:42.320 --> 02:52:48.280]  out the smart meters, the wireless, the stingray deployment and he was great for firearms and
[02:52:48.280 --> 02:52:55.720]  ammunition and training, you know, sales and lessons and all that stuff and he vicariously
[02:52:55.720 --> 02:53:01.440]  taught a whole nation how to usurp the office of the public trust, how to breach your oath,
[02:53:01.440 --> 02:53:06.440]  how to abrogate and deprive and violate rights under color of law, 42 United States Code
[02:53:06.440 --> 02:53:16.040]  Section 1983 and a tip to Rob do, look into lithium, the element and kidney failure and
[02:53:16.040 --> 02:53:22.440]  damage on with a low sodium diet as far as the Osama thing goes and I want to thank you
[02:53:22.440 --> 02:53:27.840]  bros for inspiring the people and setting us on fire as well.
[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:33.440]  I've started a little teeny radio show called the grand jury reawakening Saturday mornings
[02:53:33.440 --> 02:53:39.400]  10am on the republic broadcasting dot org and I hope to wake up everything north and
[02:53:39.400 --> 02:53:47.160]  west of Texas on the function and structure of a well working grand jury and thank you
[02:53:47.160 --> 02:53:48.160]  much.
[02:53:48.160 --> 02:53:52.280]  Well you are the amplification of our message, you're doing what needs to be done, you're
[02:53:52.280 --> 02:53:56.640]  putting the message out there, you're starting your own platform so I salute you, Dr. Kelly
[02:53:56.640 --> 02:53:59.800]  thank you so much for calling in in California which by the way is actually moving in the
[02:53:59.800 --> 02:54:03.200]  right direction, you still have the voter blocks in San Francisco and LA unfortunately
[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:08.000]  that will always go blue and destroy your state but overall the state is now red and
[02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:12.680]  there may be some hope in the future, she mentions the kidney failure, I'm not sure
[02:54:12.680 --> 02:54:17.280]  about that, we'll have to look more into that but Jeff just your response to the caller.
[02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:22.640]  Well I mean good to see that there is others that are pushing there in their own little
[02:54:22.640 --> 02:54:26.400]  enclave of individuals that they have access to, it's good to see that, I mean that obviously
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:31.080]  bodes well for the message that we're trying to get across that people need to move outside
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:35.440]  of the normal channels of media and try to seek out other areas that they can get that
[02:54:35.440 --> 02:54:42.160]  information so I'm happy to hear that and again praising the world's best gun salesman,
[02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:43.920]  can't really complain about that one either.
[02:54:43.920 --> 02:54:48.800]  Now I would imagine when you're in active duty, I don't know what years you were in
[02:54:48.800 --> 02:54:52.560]  the Navy but I would imagine that when you're in the Navy most of the time or when you're
[02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:55.960]  in any active duty, when you're watching television news most of the time you're seeing it you're
[02:54:55.960 --> 02:54:59.480]  kind of like yeah sure that's how it happened, like you know better.
[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:03.480]  I would imagine that people in the service actually prior more looking for alternative
[02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:07.560]  news because they already see the stuff on TV and either know it or know it's not true.
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:13.200]  I mean yeah you know I'll be honest, I didn't watch a lot of TV, it was very busy and when
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:20.320]  I wasn't doing anything, I typically just liked to relax and hang out but I do think
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:25.760]  that there's a lot of other options nowadays that weren't available when I was on active
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:32.040]  duty with the just the explosion of the internet and social media device and I'm sorry smartphone
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:37.360]  devices that allow you to literally have the world in your hand, you know while that was
[02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:41.000]  coming towards the end of my enlistment, you know I didn't have that during my enlistment
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:46.840]  and during my deployment so I relied on the bread and butter of news, you know the three
[02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:50.600]  networks that was where we got most of our news and it was funny because looking back
[02:55:50.600 --> 02:55:56.600]  at that, yeah you're like yeah I really don't, yeah that's not interesting, that's not entertaining,
[02:55:56.600 --> 02:55:59.760]  that's not what I think, that's not what I believe, that's not what we're seeing kind
[02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:03.760]  of thing so even back then, excuse me, even back then you can kind of see the writing
[02:56:03.760 --> 02:56:04.760]  on the wall.
[02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:08.400]  Yeah that's interesting you know the element of alternative media and the access of active
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:12.360]  duty overseas to watch that as opposed to the television news which you know probably
[02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:14.320]  is all you had access to you know decades ago.
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:17.880]  Alright let's take one more call here, Michael in Kansas sorry to cut you short but you've
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:21.920]  only got 60 seconds, go ahead.
[02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:28.760]  Thank you for my call but I want to say Obama's accomplishments, it's easy, he's an American
[02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:34.960]  president, his greatest accomplishments that I can think of that he released almost all
[02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:41.960]  the terrorists at a Guantanamo Bay, he released hundreds of convicted felons out of prison
[02:56:41.960 --> 02:56:50.640]  to vote for Hillary Clinton who were off and now well with Obama that it's where which
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:56.320]  my buddy's kid experienced that kids of color can viciously attack white teachers and white
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:00.400]  students and walk and even black teachers and walk.
[02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:05.120]  You know and that's an overarching issue that that we could get into but I think it's just
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:11.600]  a more general thing, were race relations worse or better off before and after Obama
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:15.920]  and even people admit even Obama's sports have to admit they were worse after Obama
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:18.080]  I mean that's not even a question to me.
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:26.360]  Yeah I completely agree I mean obviously we are a very broad culture and there's a lot
[02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:32.760]  of individuals within our culture but I feel like we were worse off for sure.
[02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:37.000]  And now even mainstream liberal news outlets are reporting that alright we've got five
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:40.960]  more minutes on the other side then excuse me Roger Stone takes over don't go anywhere
[02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:45.280]  we'll be right back.
[02:57:45.280 --> 02:57:50.720]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping between debt crisis, natural
[02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:57.000]  disasters or even simple power outages having a supply of storable meals is crucial.

[02:58:45.960 --> 02:58:52.280]  I want to plow into all of this but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[02:58:52.280 --> 02:58:58.680]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[02:58:58.680 --> 02:59:05.920]  or videos or other material from InfoWarsStore.com you are funding the revolution.
[02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:10.880]  I mean I cannot say it any clearer and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[02:59:10.880 --> 02:59:11.880]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:11.880 --> 02:59:15.560]  I don't want to thank everybody that has but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste
[02:59:15.560 --> 02:59:20.720]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine and you cannot beat that for
[02:59:20.720 --> 02:59:21.720]  children and adults.
[02:59:21.720 --> 02:59:25.920]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, the colloidal silver
[02:59:25.920 --> 02:59:33.760]  and iodine as well, InfoWarsLife.com or AAA2533139 and your purchase of the products stands
[02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:37.320]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[02:59:37.320 --> 02:59:41.560]  satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are and
[02:59:41.560 --> 02:59:49.440]  they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[02:59:49.440 --> 03:00:14.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:20.320]  The last caller says one of Obama's greatest accomplishments was spreading racism in America.
[03:00:20.320 --> 03:00:21.320]  I completely agree.
[03:00:21.320 --> 03:00:24.840]  Jeff and I were talking about that off air here which we'll discuss just in a second
[03:00:24.840 --> 03:00:33.000]  but the caller said specifically he made it okay to be racist against white people.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:34.760]  That was like the big thing.
[03:00:34.760 --> 03:00:35.760]  I guess you could say that.
[03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:38.360]  I mean now you have colleges having no whites allowed events.
[03:00:38.360 --> 03:00:41.640]  You've got the Black Lives Matter stuff, white people that are worse in the world but how
[03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:43.520]  many fake news stories have we seen?
[03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:48.160]  For example the NAACP president who says the officer was racist and rude to him, body cam
[03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:52.920]  released, fake news, Sean King says that a black woman was raped and abused by a police
[03:00:52.920 --> 03:00:58.000]  officer, body cam footage released, not the case, totally polite exchange.
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:03.680]  Now you've got this teen that claimed to be kidnapped by white supremacists, made it up
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:04.680]  the whole time.
[03:01:04.680 --> 03:01:08.520]  Let's roll clip eight, a story of a fake news.
[03:01:08.520 --> 03:01:13.160]  Eric police told me this afternoon that that abduction and alleged assault never happens
[03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:16.840]  and they were adamant about the fact that there are no white supremacists kidnapping
[03:01:16.840 --> 03:01:20.400]  children in northeast Houston.
[03:01:20.400 --> 03:01:24.760]  The story was horrible, a young teenage boy claiming he stepped off of a school bus and
[03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:25.760]  was abducted.
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:31.800]  An adult and four young men grabbed him, robbed him, beat him, all because of his race.
[03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:37.080]  This was his mother and the hours after Xavier on Parker said he managed to escape the gun-wielding
[03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:38.080]  kidnappers.
[03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:42.680]  The reason why they got him because they said he was black, you deserve to die.
[03:01:42.680 --> 03:01:51.240]  Did she know that it's fake news, did she know?
[03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:57.640]  But after a thorough investigation, HPV now says the events as described did not occur.
[03:01:57.640 --> 03:02:03.920]  That the property Parker described as having been taken to had nothing to do with any crime.
[03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:07.280]  Investigators have met with both the child's mother and community activists.
[03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:09.360]  They told them their findings.
[03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:13.880]  When we reached the mother on the phone today, she did not want to comment.
[03:02:13.880 --> 03:02:14.880]  Shocking.
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:17.280]  Alright, you know what, you can pull that down.
[03:02:17.280 --> 03:02:21.000]  Now you saw that kid, that is a young child.
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.440]  That child did not come up with that on his own.
[03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:29.560]  I mean, you know, I may be stepping out on a ledge here, but to me, I would guess that
[03:02:29.560 --> 03:02:31.600]  somebody implanted that in his head.
[03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:35.560]  Why would a young kid like that make up a story unless someone implanted that idea in
[03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:36.560]  his head?
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:37.560]  I'm not saying it was Obama.
[03:02:37.560 --> 03:02:38.560]  Maybe it was.
[03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:43.240]  But to me, a young child does not make up that story, does not have that racist mindset
[03:02:43.240 --> 03:02:46.600]  at that age.
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:53.040]  I'm trying to understand, like you were saying, hatred is not a quality, innate quality that
[03:02:53.040 --> 03:02:54.040]  you're born with.
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:57.600]  It is something that you learn or observe or a part of.
[03:02:57.600 --> 03:02:59.240]  So did he learn it?
[03:02:59.240 --> 03:03:00.240]  Did he observe it?
[03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:01.680]  Was he a part of it?
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:04.880]  That to me are the questions that I would like to know because something like that really
[03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:07.080]  is a division within our nation.
[03:03:07.080 --> 03:03:12.240]  And there needs to be, we can't just let it go like, okay, what, why, why did he make
[03:03:12.240 --> 03:03:13.240]  this claim?
[03:03:13.240 --> 03:03:14.240]  Why?
[03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:15.240]  What was the reason?
[03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:18.480]  But we have a, at least there should be some sort of closure that lets us know why did
[03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:19.480]  this happen?
[03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:22.760]  Was he bullied at school and this was an outlet for him in which case, okay, great, let's pay
[03:03:22.760 --> 03:03:24.280]  attention to the bullying.
[03:03:24.280 --> 03:03:29.080]  Was it something to do with, you know, this, you know, like a prank that everybody's trying
[03:03:29.080 --> 03:03:30.600]  to do nowadays to gain attention?
[03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:34.760]  Did he want attention for himself, for his plight, for whatever the issue might be?
[03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:37.560]  I think that's what we want to be focusing on, the why.
[03:03:37.560 --> 03:03:43.120]  And I think we sit here, you know, again, to the why, how is it that we elect the first
[03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:44.280]  black president?
[03:03:44.280 --> 03:03:49.680]  And I think anybody would say race relations got worse after that.
[03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:51.000]  So how do you add this up?
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:55.680]  Okay, America made the leap, historic event, elected the first black president, right?
[03:03:55.680 --> 03:03:58.360]  Okay, well then how is it race relations are worse all of a sudden?
[03:03:58.360 --> 03:04:04.360]  Where I was talking in the break, I go to University of Missouri in 2008, no racial strife,
[03:04:04.360 --> 03:04:07.960]  no problems, black people, white people, Hispanic people, all people, women, everybody
[03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:08.960]  gets along.
[03:04:08.960 --> 03:04:14.080]  Like, it's not even in the thought process of racism on campus or anything like that.
[03:04:14.080 --> 03:04:20.920]  By the time I'm gone, and it's the year 2014, now you've got protest of racism all around
[03:04:20.920 --> 03:04:21.920]  campus.
[03:04:21.920 --> 03:04:24.960]  You've got professors saying you don't have the right to free speech and it's just like,
[03:04:24.960 --> 03:04:26.440]  what the hell happened?
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:31.800]  Race relations didn't get worse organically, so something had to be the conduit for that.
[03:04:31.800 --> 03:04:37.280]  I completely agree, and the catalyst for it was, in my opinion, the catalyst for that
[03:04:37.280 --> 03:04:43.120]  was driving of wedge in our nation, division.
[03:04:43.120 --> 03:04:44.120]  And that's what it is.
[03:04:44.120 --> 03:04:45.120]  Now, how do you beat that?
[03:04:45.120 --> 03:04:46.640]  That's the question, how do we beat it?
[03:04:46.640 --> 03:04:49.200]  Because it's like, it gets all the hype.
[03:04:49.200 --> 03:04:50.520]  It's not even really there.
[03:04:50.520 --> 03:04:54.400]  It's a tiny thing, but they magnify it.
[03:04:54.400 --> 03:04:58.200]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:04:58.200 --> 03:05:02.760]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[03:05:02.760 --> 03:05:08.200]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:13.560]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[03:05:13.560 --> 03:05:15.120]  to unhealthy levels.
[03:05:15.120 --> 03:05:21.640]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:05:21.640 --> 03:05:25.600]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:27.000]  in the rainwater.
[03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:32.360]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[03:05:32.360 --> 03:05:38.440]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:05:38.440 --> 03:05:44.080]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[03:05:44.080 --> 03:05:49.400]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:05:49.400 --> 03:05:59.400]  And more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:05:59.400 --> 03:06:05.800]  Wait a second, Jeff.
[03:06:05.800 --> 03:06:10.720]  You're telling me, when you're having a conversation with a fellow human being, the first thing
[03:06:10.720 --> 03:06:12.520]  that doesn't come to your head is racism?
[03:06:12.520 --> 03:06:13.520]  No.
[03:06:13.520 --> 03:06:14.520]  What is wrong with you?
[03:06:14.520 --> 03:06:19.640]  No, I know, I must have been too close to some explosions in my time.
[03:06:19.640 --> 03:06:22.320]  Wait, you're telling me that a grenade isn't racist?
[03:06:22.320 --> 03:06:24.520]  A grenade doesn't pick who and what it hurts?
[03:06:24.520 --> 03:06:25.520]  No, that's very true.
[03:06:25.520 --> 03:06:26.520]  It does not.
[03:06:26.520 --> 03:06:27.920]  It is very blind in that sense.
[03:06:27.920 --> 03:06:31.880]  All right, so to provide some context here, as we're waiting to get connected with Roger
[03:06:31.880 --> 03:06:36.280]  Stone in the break, I'm talking to Jeff, and I'm asking him if he has somewhere to be,
[03:06:36.280 --> 03:06:39.520]  if he needs to go, he can sit around, we'll take some more phone calls.
[03:06:39.520 --> 03:06:43.040]  And he's like, well, you know, maybe we could do just kind of a goodbye segment here.
[03:06:43.040 --> 03:06:46.640]  And I'm like, oh, OK, you don't want to do the Irish goodbye.
[03:06:46.640 --> 03:06:49.240]  And the Irish goodbye is when you just don't even say bye.
[03:06:49.240 --> 03:06:50.240]  You just leave.
[03:06:50.240 --> 03:06:52.240]  Like, if you're out in an event and then all of a sudden you're gone, they call out the
[03:06:52.240 --> 03:06:53.560]  Irish goodbye.
[03:06:53.560 --> 03:06:55.800]  And so I'm like, oh, did you just want to do an Irish goodbye?
[03:06:55.800 --> 03:06:56.800]  And he's like, what?
[03:06:56.800 --> 03:06:58.720]  And I'm like, oh, sorry, I didn't mean to be racist.
[03:06:58.720 --> 03:07:00.520]  And then, of course, you know, what was your response?
[03:07:00.520 --> 03:07:01.520]  I said the Irish goodbye.
[03:07:01.520 --> 03:07:02.520]  What did you say?
[03:07:02.520 --> 03:07:08.720]  I said, it never even occurred to me that that was racist until you actually started to apologize
[03:07:08.720 --> 03:07:09.720]  for it.
[03:07:09.720 --> 03:07:13.760]  I was joking, I wasn't actually sorry, OK?
[03:07:13.760 --> 03:07:16.880]  I didn't even realize that I was just like, I was more curious about that.
[03:07:16.880 --> 03:07:17.880]  I'm like, what is an Irish goodbye?
[03:07:17.880 --> 03:07:18.880]  I've never heard of that before.
[03:07:18.880 --> 03:07:20.600]  I was genuinely curious about it.
[03:07:20.600 --> 03:07:23.600]  So my first thought was not racism.
[03:07:23.600 --> 03:07:30.400]  And that, though, to me is the mental illness that some people have where they can't even
[03:07:30.400 --> 03:07:35.960]  have a normal conversation because there's this veil of racism over it where, you know,
[03:07:35.960 --> 03:07:40.080]  it's like, I don't know if it's like the PC thing overall or if it's they're so afraid
[03:07:40.080 --> 03:07:41.640]  to be labeled racist.
[03:07:41.640 --> 03:07:42.640]  I'm not sure what it is.
[03:07:42.640 --> 03:07:43.640]  But that's what it is like.
[03:07:43.640 --> 03:07:44.640]  Yeah.
[03:07:44.640 --> 03:07:45.960]  The average normal people don't think like that.
[03:07:45.960 --> 03:07:46.960]  You make a joke.
[03:07:46.960 --> 03:07:48.640]  You say something like, oh, Irish goodbye.
[03:07:48.640 --> 03:07:49.640]  You're not like that.
[03:07:49.640 --> 03:07:50.640]  Oh, wow.
[03:07:50.640 --> 03:07:51.640]  Racist.
[03:07:51.640 --> 03:07:52.640]  No, you're like, oh, what's Irish goodbye?
[03:07:52.640 --> 03:07:54.800]  But that's what there's this mindset now that people have.
[03:07:54.800 --> 03:07:57.440]  It's like, oh, oh, how dare you say Irish goodbye?
[03:07:57.440 --> 03:07:59.920]  Oh, how dare you wear a Chinese dress to prom?
[03:07:59.920 --> 03:08:03.800]  Like who looks at a prom dress and says, oh my gosh, racist.
[03:08:03.800 --> 03:08:05.640]  I am floored by that.
[03:08:05.640 --> 03:08:11.480]  Again, it's like, I think we're really digging into the weeds, not weed, but I think certain
[03:08:11.480 --> 03:08:17.560]  people are digging into the weeds for attention, number one, and division number two.
[03:08:17.560 --> 03:08:22.600]  And when you add those two things together, what gets attention and what do you use to
[03:08:22.600 --> 03:08:24.440]  try to act like you're high and mighty?
[03:08:24.440 --> 03:08:25.640]  Oh, race card.
[03:08:25.640 --> 03:08:26.640]  So true.
[03:08:26.640 --> 03:08:29.320]  And so that's how it goes.
[03:08:29.320 --> 03:08:31.880]  Is Roger Stone ready to go here, guys?
[03:08:31.880 --> 03:08:33.680]  All right.
[03:08:33.680 --> 03:08:36.080]  So let's bring Roger in real quick.
[03:08:36.080 --> 03:08:38.640]  Before we move on, Roger, we've got some callers lined up for you.
[03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:42.240]  If you want to take calls, obviously we've talked about the news.
[03:08:42.240 --> 03:08:47.720]  But one thing, Roger, first of all, the Bill Clinton rape t-shirt is about to make a huge
[03:08:47.720 --> 03:08:48.720]  comeback.
[03:08:48.720 --> 03:08:49.720]  Now we're sold out.
[03:08:49.720 --> 03:08:50.720]  We don't have any left.
[03:08:50.720 --> 03:08:57.040]  But the Me Too protest of Bill Clinton here in Austin, Texas, Sunday, this Sunday, 6 p.m.
[03:08:57.040 --> 03:09:00.840]  Central, we're inviting all info warriors to come out where their Bill Clinton rape
[03:09:00.840 --> 03:09:01.840]  t-shirt.
[03:09:01.840 --> 03:09:07.480]  Roger, you have to admit it took, you know, 20 years, but the media is finally holding
[03:09:07.480 --> 03:09:11.560]  Clinton's feet to the fire from all the sexual abuse over the years.
[03:09:11.560 --> 03:09:18.760]  Well, Owen, I think it's important to note that I think the iconic Clinton rape t-shirt
[03:09:18.760 --> 03:09:23.040]  is still available at Stone Cold Truth.com at the store there.
[03:09:23.040 --> 03:09:24.160]  You might check on that.
[03:09:24.160 --> 03:09:31.000]  But beyond that, this was essentially a meme that Alex Jones and I used to break through
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:38.040]  the mainstream media blockade, the blackout, on the facts regarding Hillary Clinton and
[03:09:38.040 --> 03:09:39.600]  her husband.
[03:09:39.600 --> 03:09:47.000]  They wanted to define Bill Clinton's actions as infidelities or indiscretions, personal
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:48.200]  matters.
[03:09:48.200 --> 03:09:52.200]  But in fact, the issue was far more serious.
[03:09:52.200 --> 03:09:55.000]  It was violence against women.
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:56.280]  It was rape.
[03:09:56.280 --> 03:09:58.720]  It was sexual assault.
[03:09:58.720 --> 03:09:59.880]  It wasn't one woman.
[03:09:59.880 --> 03:10:00.880]  It wasn't two.
[03:10:00.880 --> 03:10:02.120]  It wasn't three.
[03:10:02.120 --> 03:10:03.760]  It was dozens.
[03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:10.260]  You can go to the Clinton's War on Women, and it is documented.
[03:10:10.260 --> 03:10:18.360]  Even in the historic Juanita Broderick interviews, NBC held onto them for a long time while there
[03:10:18.360 --> 03:10:22.520]  was an internal debate over even running them.
[03:10:22.520 --> 03:10:28.600]  And in the taping, Juanita Broderick has told Breitbart, when she attempted to discuss the
[03:10:28.600 --> 03:10:35.360]  role of Hillary in threatening her to her face, a producer jumped up and yelled, caught,
[03:10:35.360 --> 03:10:38.160]  we're not interested in that.
[03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:43.000]  So this story is still very germane.
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:48.520]  The idea that Hillary Clinton was an advocate for women, when she's in fact a tormentor
[03:10:48.520 --> 03:10:54.040]  of women and a abuser of women, it's Hillary Clinton who hires the heavy-handed private
[03:10:54.040 --> 03:11:01.040]  detectives and the nasty lawyers to threaten the Kathleen Willys, the Juanita Brodericks,
[03:11:01.040 --> 03:11:06.120]  the Paula Joneses, and so many others.
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:07.880]  And Jennifer Flowers is another one.
[03:11:07.880 --> 03:11:11.480]  Jennifer Flowers is now actually going even more public with her story, where she wasn't
[03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:12.480]  telling some of the details.
[03:11:12.480 --> 03:11:14.480]  Now she's going even more public.
[03:11:14.480 --> 03:11:16.840]  There is a distinction, though.
[03:11:16.840 --> 03:11:22.160]  Jennifer Flowers enters into a consensual relationship with Bill Clinton that goes wrong
[03:11:22.160 --> 03:11:24.080]  and he becomes abusive.
[03:11:24.080 --> 03:11:27.600]  These other women didn't ask for his advances.
[03:11:27.600 --> 03:11:30.440]  These were not consensual relationships.
[03:11:30.440 --> 03:11:32.480]  There is that important distinction.
[03:11:32.480 --> 03:11:35.040]  And let's just point out another part of the media blockade.
[03:11:35.040 --> 03:11:37.720]  You may now recognize the name Michael Izakov.
[03:11:37.720 --> 03:11:42.560]  This is the guy who wrote the article that was used to spy on President Trump about the
[03:11:42.560 --> 03:11:44.280]  Russian dossier, knowing it was fake.
[03:11:44.280 --> 03:11:50.920]  That same Michael Izakov, Izakov had the Monica Lewinsky story and spiked it and made
[03:11:50.920 --> 03:11:52.440]  sure nobody reported on it.
[03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:54.680]  So again, another example of them blocking this.
[03:11:54.680 --> 03:11:56.440]  But we're holding the Me Too protest.
[03:11:56.440 --> 03:12:01.880]  We're asking all info warriors to come to Austin this Sunday, June 10th outside Bass
[03:12:01.880 --> 03:12:04.960]  Concert Hall here in Austin, Texas at 6 p.m.
[03:12:04.960 --> 03:12:09.200]  We'll be doing live streams following the Alex Jones show from 4 to 6 p.m. central.
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:13.160]  As soon as that concludes, I'll be leaving here in the studio going to the Bill Clinton
[03:12:13.160 --> 03:12:15.960]  Me Too protest outside Bass Concert Hall.
[03:12:15.960 --> 03:12:20.640]  And of course, this is all possible with your support at infowarstore.com.
[03:12:20.640 --> 03:12:24.400]  The Memorial Day Patriot specials are still running.

[03:12:38.480 --> 03:12:43.960]  Well, Jeff Gonzalez, it's been a real pleasure having you in studio from tridentconcepts.com.
[03:12:43.960 --> 03:12:50.080]  And also, if you want to get some of his training, the range at Austin is where to get that.
[03:12:50.080 --> 03:12:51.720]  So great stuff from Jeff today.
[03:12:51.720 --> 03:12:53.800]  There is his website right there.
[03:12:53.800 --> 03:12:58.120]  And without further ado, Roger, I hand it over to you with this question.
[03:12:58.120 --> 03:13:04.960]  Do you think Andrew McCabe is willing and ready to sing like a canary and sell out the
[03:13:04.960 --> 03:13:09.800]  Obama administration with the recent reports that he's willing to exchange his testimony
[03:13:09.800 --> 03:13:10.800]  for immunity?
[03:13:10.800 --> 03:13:11.800]  Roger Stone.
[03:13:11.800 --> 03:13:17.400]  Well, I think we need to see the inspector general's report before we can get an accurate
[03:13:17.400 --> 03:13:19.680]  answer to that question.
[03:13:19.680 --> 03:13:23.600]  I'm somewhat perplexed by the president in all honesty.
[03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:28.080]  He's absolutely right about the awesome legal power of the pardon.
[03:13:28.080 --> 03:13:33.000]  He used it justly in the case of Dinesh D'Souza and Jack Johnson.
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:39.240]  I wrote him over a year ago urging him to issue a posthumous pardon for Marcus Garvey,
[03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:45.400]  the famous black nationalist who the FBI hounded and improperly convicted.
[03:13:45.400 --> 03:13:52.400]  And it is a legitimate check on a biased or a politicized prosecution.
[03:13:52.400 --> 03:13:58.000]  I think a perfect example is the case of Dinesh D'Souza, where the law was being inequitably
[03:13:58.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  applied.
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:04.080]  Rosie O'Donnell pays no penalty, poor Dinesh goes up the river.
[03:14:04.080 --> 03:14:09.920]  Why, however, the president would say that he has the power to pardon himself when it's
[03:14:09.920 --> 03:14:16.240]  irrelevant since to our knowledge, he is convicted, he has committed no crime, requiring a pardon.
[03:14:16.240 --> 03:14:19.040]  I must understand I found his comments perplexed.
[03:14:19.040 --> 03:14:25.760]  But don't you think that's a Clinton operative George Steffanopoulos who forces that question
[03:14:25.760 --> 03:14:29.440]  into the media by boring home on Giuliani?
[03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:30.440]  What about the pardon power?
[03:14:30.440 --> 03:14:31.440]  What about the pardon power?
[03:14:31.440 --> 03:14:35.360]  He wouldn't give it up and then Giuliani responds, it becomes a national news story.
[03:14:35.360 --> 03:14:38.960]  Well, it's a theoretical legal question.
[03:14:38.960 --> 03:14:43.680]  The president doesn't require a pardon, but that doesn't mean he couldn't pardon General
[03:14:43.680 --> 03:14:50.640]  Mike Flynn if his indictment proves to be as flawed and politicized as we think it is.
[03:14:50.640 --> 03:14:58.040]  It doesn't mean that he could pardon others, whether they are of a political strata or
[03:14:58.040 --> 03:14:59.400]  not.
[03:14:59.400 --> 03:15:03.520]  I am perplexed by his decision to pardon Scooter Libby.
[03:15:03.520 --> 03:15:08.480]  Scooter Libby helped lie us into a war that the president opposed.
[03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:13.800]  But on the whole, I was very pleased by the Jack Johnson thing because there's important
[03:15:13.800 --> 03:15:19.560]  symbolism in the power, in the pardon, as well as the legal authority.
[03:15:19.560 --> 03:15:21.080]  So there it is from Roger Stone.
[03:15:21.080 --> 03:15:24.440]  He takes over on the other side of this break.
[03:15:24.440 --> 03:15:28.160]  We've got some phone calls still, Roger may take your phone calls or he'll get into the
[03:15:28.160 --> 03:15:32.440]  details of all the White House intrigue and all the deep state news that he's aware of.
[03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:36.240]  So for Jeff Gonzalez, I'm Owen Troyer, filling in for Alex Jones this week.
[03:15:36.240 --> 03:15:40.280]  Hope to see you at the Me Too protest this Sunday at 6 p.m. central.
[03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:41.280]  I'm signing off.
[03:15:41.280 --> 03:15:42.280]  Roger Stone takes over.
[03:15:42.280 --> 03:15:53.280]  You stay classy, Info Warriors.

[03:18:59.360 --> 03:19:00.360]  Thanks for holding.
[03:19:00.360 --> 03:19:05.000]  Hey, I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:10.240]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and
[03:19:10.240 --> 03:19:14.640]  I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and
[03:19:14.640 --> 03:19:19.080]  read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using
[03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:23.280]  your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the
[03:19:23.280 --> 03:19:29.320]  X2, the SuperMail Vitality Decay Man, the Real Red Pill, MycoZX Body.
[03:19:29.320 --> 03:19:30.320]  It's all amazing.
[03:19:30.320 --> 03:19:31.320]  Thank you, brother.
[03:19:31.320 --> 03:19:35.760]  I just wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the
[03:19:35.760 --> 03:19:40.560]  mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more you know
[03:19:40.560 --> 03:19:45.680]  God, the more you fear God, the more you chase God and I wanted to say that it's an honor
[03:19:45.680 --> 03:19:53.720]  to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[03:19:53.720 --> 03:20:07.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:07.200 --> 03:20:18.440]  News, Analysis, Reports.
[03:20:18.440 --> 03:20:21.080]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:21.080 --> 03:20:27.880]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:20:27.880 --> 03:20:28.880]  Welcome back.
[03:20:28.880 --> 03:20:33.960]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:20:33.960 --> 03:20:38.520]  Important primary results from around the country yesterday.
[03:20:38.520 --> 03:20:44.080]  Let's see if we can pull up the final on the California governor's race.
[03:20:44.080 --> 03:20:52.280]  Now, as some of you may remember, California uses this very strange jungle primary system
[03:20:52.280 --> 03:21:00.000]  in which all candidates, regardless of their party, run in one single primary.
[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:06.640]  The two top vote getters, if no one gets 50% of the vote, even if they are two Republicans
[03:21:06.640 --> 03:21:10.880]  and two Democrats, still face off.
[03:21:10.880 --> 03:21:18.400]  It appears at the most recent count that the candidates will be Lieutenant Governor Gavin
[03:21:18.400 --> 03:21:27.520]  Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco and Republican challenger John Cox.
[03:21:27.520 --> 03:21:33.520]  I haven't seen the most recent numbers, but I would certainly like to.
[03:21:33.520 --> 03:21:35.720]  There's the headline.
[03:21:35.720 --> 03:21:41.560]  This is an extraordinary comeback for the Republican Party because many believed that
[03:21:41.560 --> 03:21:50.280]  former Los Angeles mayor, Anthony Villa-Ragosa, would have run second in a state this dominated
[03:21:50.280 --> 03:21:52.320]  by Democrats.
[03:21:52.320 --> 03:22:00.080]  Cox ran an unconventional campaign, although he is a bit more of a moderate Republican.
[03:22:00.080 --> 03:22:07.400]  He embraced Trump and the Trump presidency, and I think it is a major factor beyond the
[03:22:07.400 --> 03:22:13.680]  substantial use of his own wealth that he has made this runoff.
[03:22:13.680 --> 03:22:20.200]  Travis Allen, who we interviewed here on the Infowars the other day, ran a terrific
[03:22:20.200 --> 03:22:28.400]  grassroots campaign, but in the final analysis, unfortunately, did not have the mega-media
[03:22:28.400 --> 03:22:39.040]  bucks that it costs to communicate effectively on broadcast TV in a state the size and expense
[03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:40.760]  of California.
[03:22:40.760 --> 03:22:49.480]  A bit of bad news, unfortunately, in the overwhelmingly district of poverty pimp Maxine Waters, Waters
[03:22:49.480 --> 03:22:59.240]  received 71 percent, therefore avoiding a runoff, Omar Navarro, a Republican, a friend
[03:22:59.240 --> 03:23:05.280]  of the show, received 8,000 votes or 14 percent.
[03:23:05.280 --> 03:23:14.320]  The same problem, Omar ran a terrific grassroots and net-based oriented campaign, but without
[03:23:14.320 --> 03:23:23.160]  the big dollars for broadcast television and the money to pay for a machine, as Maxine
[03:23:23.160 --> 03:23:28.160]  Waters does, it was always an uphill fight.
[03:23:28.160 --> 03:23:36.920]  Frank DiMartini, a third candidate in that race, a Republican, a very good man, in the
[03:23:36.920 --> 03:23:47.560]  end probably served with Edwin Duarte to further fraction what was already a minority Republican
[03:23:47.560 --> 03:23:48.560]  vote.
[03:23:48.560 --> 03:23:58.240]  DiMartini and Omar Navarro both will be heard from again in American elective politics.
[03:23:58.240 --> 03:24:04.040]  We are also intrigued by the results out of Alabama.
[03:24:04.040 --> 03:24:09.680]  This is yet another race that we had highlighted for you.
[03:24:09.680 --> 03:24:20.120]  It appears that Rhino Attorney General Matthews has narrowly squeezed into first place, but
[03:24:20.120 --> 03:24:27.840]  right behind him, former Republican Attorney General and hard-charging conservative Troy
[03:24:27.840 --> 03:24:32.520]  King, this now heads to a runoff.
[03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:40.520]  So the establishment threw everything they had at King and did everything possible to
[03:24:40.520 --> 03:24:49.320]  help Marshall, a party switcher and former Democrat, a foe Trump supporter, held him
[03:24:49.320 --> 03:24:57.880]  under the 50, and they now bruised to what will be a classic, classic runoff.
[03:24:57.880 --> 03:25:06.480]  Alice Martin, the third candidate in that race, garnered a respectable 126,000 votes,
[03:25:06.480 --> 03:25:10.280]  but sadly did so on the basis of a lie.
[03:25:10.280 --> 03:25:16.640]  She claimed she had never chosen the appointment to the vacancy in the Attorney General's
[03:25:16.640 --> 03:25:26.640]  office from outgoing corrupt jailbird president Bentley, but unfortunately as we reported
[03:25:26.640 --> 03:25:36.040]  here on Infowars, a letter surfaced showing that was a lie, most likely undermining her
[03:25:36.040 --> 03:25:39.520]  candidacy for Attorney General.
[03:25:39.520 --> 03:25:47.960]  There you have an easy winner in the Democratic primary for Governor of Alabama.
[03:25:47.960 --> 03:25:55.160]  This was also among the more exciting races in the country.
[03:25:55.160 --> 03:26:01.440]  We're going to be talking about a race that is of great interest to me.
[03:26:01.440 --> 03:26:06.800]  Coming up, we're going to interview a man named Dennis Hoff.
[03:26:06.800 --> 03:26:15.400]  Dennis Hoff is a libertarian, a Trump supporter, a solid Republican, but he also owns the largest
[03:26:15.400 --> 03:26:20.280]  chain of legal brothels in the state of Nevada.
[03:26:20.280 --> 03:26:28.480]  Nevada has a long frontier tradition of legalized prostitution as approved by the voters in
[03:26:28.480 --> 03:26:30.760]  certain counties.
[03:26:30.760 --> 03:26:39.200]  So therefore, Mr. Hoff is engaged in a perfectly legal and very well run business.
[03:26:39.200 --> 03:26:48.240]  He pays his taxes, he employs many people, he has conspicuously clean health department
[03:26:48.240 --> 03:26:52.760]  approved facilities, and he allows no drugs.
[03:26:52.760 --> 03:27:00.040]  There have been numerous attacks on him because of his business success, which has made him
[03:27:00.040 --> 03:27:01.720]  a billionaire.
[03:27:01.720 --> 03:27:07.760]  You may have seen him on the HBO TV special Cat House.
[03:27:07.760 --> 03:27:15.720]  He was first brought to my attention by Tucker Carlson, who pointed out that Dennis Hoff
[03:27:15.720 --> 03:27:22.600]  is an articulate advocate for working people and a true libertarian.
[03:27:22.600 --> 03:27:29.240]  In the state of Nevada, where corruption is an enormous issue, I have the feeling that
[03:27:29.240 --> 03:27:36.720]  Dennis Hoff, there you see him, is unbought and unbossed, a true man of the people.
[03:27:36.720 --> 03:27:46.880]  I ventured to Parump, Nevada, because we call him the Trump of Parump for a rally this weekend,
[03:27:46.880 --> 03:27:53.720]  and he's going to join us shortly to talk about taxes, water rights, and dirty political
[03:27:53.720 --> 03:27:58.600]  tricks being attempted against him by his opponents.
[03:27:58.600 --> 03:28:05.880]  I'm Roger Stone, we'll be right back.
[03:28:05.880 --> 03:28:09.760]  We are okay.
[03:28:09.760 --> 03:28:18.000]  If I may, let me take this extra time to urge you to go to the Infowars.com store, which
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:26.440]  allows us to bring you this extraordinarily unconventional and offbeat coverage.

[03:29:23.080 --> 03:29:27.040]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S. What
[03:29:27.040 --> 03:29:31.960]  if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[03:29:31.960 --> 03:29:36.240]  At heart and body extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier

[03:29:54.440 --> 03:29:59.000]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home, but sometimes
[03:29:59.000 --> 03:30:03.680]  supplements don't work fast enough, that's why InfoWarsLife has created a powerful new

[03:30:27.920 --> 03:30:31.160]  stay clean when you feel surrounded by toxins.
[03:30:31.160 --> 03:30:36.080]  With powerful yet simple ingredients, immune gargle features Silver Soul Nano Silver for

[03:30:51.600 --> 03:30:58.400]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[03:30:58.400 --> 03:31:03.120]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[03:31:03.120 --> 03:31:04.640]  to detoxify the body.
[03:31:04.640 --> 03:31:09.520]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:31:09.520 --> 03:31:11.040]  It's made in the USA.
[03:31:11.040 --> 03:31:15.960]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[03:31:15.960 --> 03:31:17.800]  the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[03:31:17.800 --> 03:31:20.040]  It is a classical 360 wins.
[03:31:20.040 --> 03:31:24.560]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[03:31:24.560 --> 03:31:29.360]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[03:31:29.360 --> 03:31:30.360]  get.
[03:31:30.360 --> 03:31:33.440]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[03:31:33.440 --> 03:31:38.480]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you

[03:31:43.720 --> 03:31:46.400]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[03:32:14.840 --> 03:32:20.000]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which

[03:32:37.920 --> 03:32:44.800]  organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon
[03:32:44.800 --> 03:32:47.440]  for maximum prebiotic effect.

[03:32:57.440 --> 03:33:16.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:16.120 --> 03:33:19.640]  Resistance to Tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:33:19.640 --> 03:33:20.640]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:20.640 --> 03:33:30.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:30.800 --> 03:33:36.400]  I'm your pinch-heading host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:36.400 --> 03:33:43.600]  And yes, as you can see, it's after Memorial Day, so I'm sporting the seersucker.
[03:33:43.600 --> 03:33:51.080]  In hot weather, there is nothing more comfortable for the well-attired gentleman.
[03:33:51.080 --> 03:33:56.960]  Joining us now is a man who's literally a legend in the West.
[03:33:56.960 --> 03:34:07.080]  Entrepreneur, businessman, showman, libertarian, Republican and outspoken Trump supporter, Dennis
[03:34:07.080 --> 03:34:09.320]  Hoff joins us now.
[03:34:09.320 --> 03:34:10.320]  Hi, Roger.
[03:34:10.320 --> 03:34:11.320]  How are you?
[03:34:11.320 --> 03:34:14.120]  How many seersucker suits you've got?
[03:34:14.120 --> 03:34:21.560]  Well, I have several, but as I pointed out, if you buy quality at the beginning and you
[03:34:21.560 --> 03:34:26.800]  take good care of your garments, they will last you a lifetime.
[03:34:26.800 --> 03:34:27.800]  Good.
[03:34:27.800 --> 03:34:29.160]  I'll remember that.
[03:34:29.160 --> 03:34:38.480]  Dennis, you are running for the Nevada Assembly in a district in rural Nye County.
[03:34:38.480 --> 03:34:44.000]  You're running against a fellow by the name of James Oscarsson.
[03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:51.160]  Now older viewers will remember that Will Rogers once said he never met a man he didn't
[03:34:51.160 --> 03:34:52.160]  like.
[03:34:52.160 --> 03:34:56.040]  James Oscarsson in the legislature never met a tax.
[03:34:56.040 --> 03:34:58.440]  He didn't hike.
[03:34:58.440 --> 03:35:08.160]  This guy has got Rhino written all over him, and they have tried to smear you in ways that
[03:35:08.160 --> 03:35:13.480]  even boggle the mind for a political veteran like myself.
[03:35:13.480 --> 03:35:19.920]  For example, accusing you, God forbid, of supporting Hillary Clinton.
[03:35:19.920 --> 03:35:26.040]  A lie saying that you didn't support President Donald Trump.
[03:35:26.040 --> 03:35:28.680]  A lie.
[03:35:28.680 --> 03:35:36.640]  This kind of below the belt smear tactics, I don't think will sit well with Nevadans,
[03:35:36.640 --> 03:35:43.680]  and it was amazing to me that Michael McDonald, the chairman of the Republican State Committee,
[03:35:43.680 --> 03:35:49.760]  who is not taking sides in the primary, who has not endorsed anybody, was forced to come
[03:35:49.760 --> 03:35:58.760]  out publicly and correct this incredible litany of lies being thrown your way.
[03:35:58.760 --> 03:36:03.320]  Before I let you answer, let me say why I think this is happening.
[03:36:03.320 --> 03:36:11.000]  Dennis, you scare the daylights out of the career politicians in Carson City.
[03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:15.880]  You scare the daylights out of the establishment status quo.
[03:36:15.880 --> 03:36:22.200]  Let's get reelected and keep our mouth shut politicians in the state capital.
[03:36:22.200 --> 03:36:27.440]  Because of your independent wealth, which you've worked very hard to earn every penny
[03:36:27.440 --> 03:36:36.760]  up, and your feisty frontier attitude, and your basic integrity, they know you can't
[03:36:36.760 --> 03:36:40.080]  be bought.
[03:36:40.080 --> 03:36:42.320]  Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
[03:36:42.320 --> 03:36:46.360]  It sounds like Donald Trump, you know, we're both best selling offers.
[03:36:46.360 --> 03:36:49.360]  We both have reality TV shows.
[03:36:49.360 --> 03:36:51.320]  We both produced shows.
[03:36:51.320 --> 03:36:56.240]  We both made, been successful, made a lot of money, him a lot more money than me.
[03:36:56.240 --> 03:36:59.160]  And I appreciate it when you call me the Trump of Trump.
[03:36:59.160 --> 03:37:01.120]  I wear that handle proudly.
[03:37:01.120 --> 03:37:05.880]  Well, and there are issues in this race.
[03:37:05.880 --> 03:37:14.040]  Water rights, second amendment rights, tax rights, and tax increases.
[03:37:14.040 --> 03:37:21.360]  Who comes up on the conservative, reliable Ronald Reagan side of the agenda?
[03:37:21.360 --> 03:37:24.000]  That would be Dennis Hoff.
[03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:33.000]  And his opponent is part of the go along to get along crowd, financed by the special interests,
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:39.960]  accused himself of in the me to movement, and running what has to be considered one
[03:37:39.960 --> 03:37:45.320]  of the sleaziest smear campaigns I have ever seen.
[03:37:45.320 --> 03:37:50.960]  I've been called many, many things that I would find insulting, but being called a Hillary
[03:37:50.960 --> 03:37:55.000]  Clinton supporter, that's the bottom of the barrel.
[03:37:55.000 --> 03:37:57.320]  Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[03:37:57.320 --> 03:37:58.760]  It's a very dirty race.
[03:37:58.760 --> 03:38:05.880]  And I've been accused of causing everything bad in America, maybe even sinking the Titanic.
[03:38:05.880 --> 03:38:07.720]  It's just one thing after another.
[03:38:07.720 --> 03:38:12.360]  I had no idea, you know, Tucker Carlson told me how dirty the establishment was, Grover
[03:38:12.360 --> 03:38:15.000]  Norquist, I did sign the tax pledge.
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:16.720]  He came out to support me.
[03:38:16.720 --> 03:38:20.480]  You all told me, and I just didn't want to believe it was as dirty as it is.
[03:38:20.480 --> 03:38:27.040]  But now it just makes me dig my heels in more and write more checks to fight this.
[03:38:27.040 --> 03:38:33.120]  And when I get to Carson City, who better to run all these political hookers than me?
[03:38:33.120 --> 03:38:35.240]  Well, it's exactly right.
[03:38:35.240 --> 03:38:41.680]  If anybody can spot a whore of the political type, it would be you.
[03:38:41.680 --> 03:38:48.920]  Now it's interesting to me that tomorrow's primary is viewed as very close.
[03:38:48.920 --> 03:38:59.600]  And I know that there will be an extraordinary effort to get out every single vote.
[03:38:59.600 --> 03:39:03.480]  I didn't mean tomorrow, I'm sorry, it's the 12th, is that correct?
[03:39:03.480 --> 03:39:04.480]  Correct.
[03:39:04.480 --> 03:39:08.160]  Right, a few short days from now.
[03:39:08.160 --> 03:39:14.960]  Organized labor, who has many members in this district, many of whom are registered Republicans,
[03:39:14.960 --> 03:39:18.400]  I think can be pivotal in this race.
[03:39:18.400 --> 03:39:22.320]  People know that you are a friend of the working man.
[03:39:22.320 --> 03:39:26.000]  People know that you stand up for people's rights.
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:33.080]  People know of your vast charitable activities, that this isn't all about Dennis Hoff.
[03:39:33.080 --> 03:39:40.240]  So many people say that if you win this race for the assembly, you're heading for the governor's
[03:39:40.240 --> 03:39:41.680]  mansion.
[03:39:41.680 --> 03:39:43.920]  People like straight talk.
[03:39:43.920 --> 03:39:51.920]  They like people who don't try to be SM, but above all, I think they like your feisty,
[03:39:51.920 --> 03:39:55.200]  Trump-like independence.
[03:39:55.200 --> 03:39:57.640]  Here's what I learned.
[03:39:57.640 --> 03:40:03.480]  Dennis Hoff will tell you exactly what he thinks, and he'll give it to you unvarnished.
[03:40:03.480 --> 03:40:08.600]  He's not trying to be politically correct, he is what he is.
[03:40:08.600 --> 03:40:15.960]  An honest businessman, a solid conservative, a lifelong foe of Hillary Clinton, and up
[03:40:15.960 --> 03:40:22.840]  against one of the nastiest, most corrupt, political machines in the entire state of
[03:40:22.840 --> 03:40:23.840]  Nevada.
[03:40:23.840 --> 03:40:24.840]  Absolutely.
[03:40:24.840 --> 03:40:28.200]  There's not any question about it.
[03:40:28.200 --> 03:40:29.640]  They're doing everything they can.
[03:40:29.640 --> 03:40:31.040]  They're terrified.
[03:40:31.040 --> 03:40:37.880]  Oskarsson is owned by the casinos, he's owned by the developers, he's owned by Big Pharma.
[03:40:37.880 --> 03:40:42.160]  That's who he goes to when he needs advice on how to vote, and I'm not going to do that.
[03:40:42.160 --> 03:40:46.480]  I'll listen to him, but I'm going to vote the way the voters want me to vote.
[03:40:46.480 --> 03:40:50.640]  That's how I'm going to vote, and I did sign that attached pledge of Grover Norquist, and
[03:40:50.640 --> 03:40:52.480]  I'm proud of it.
[03:40:52.480 --> 03:40:56.240]  I think that's a very, very key factor in the race.
[03:40:56.240 --> 03:41:04.040]  Grover Norquist, a good man, is organization for tax reform, one of the major leading voices
[03:41:04.040 --> 03:41:07.840]  in the country for fiscal sanity.
[03:41:07.840 --> 03:41:15.440]  I want to remind everybody, therefore, in Nye County, all of my friends that I met this
[03:41:15.440 --> 03:41:21.320]  past weekend, that every single vote counts.
[03:41:21.320 --> 03:41:26.440]  You don't want to be home on election night and find out that Dennis lost by two votes
[03:41:26.440 --> 03:41:30.680]  and that two of your cousins who were supposed to vote forgot.
[03:41:30.680 --> 03:41:37.640]  That's the worst of all worlds, so scour every nook and cranny of this district.
[03:41:37.640 --> 03:41:44.600]  And every voter who's interested in liberty and fairness and a quality of life that Dennis
[03:41:44.600 --> 03:41:52.640]  Hoff will fight for, a fighter for water rights, a fighter for the Second Amendment, a fighter
[03:41:52.640 --> 03:41:55.120]  against a commuter tax.
[03:41:55.120 --> 03:41:56.800]  I've read your literature.
[03:41:56.800 --> 03:42:02.680]  I love the fact that you're using your high school graduation picture in your billboards,
[03:42:02.680 --> 03:42:08.120]  and I have every confidence that you're going to win this race.
[03:42:08.120 --> 03:42:11.000]  Forty-five seconds to go.
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:14.640]  What are your final exhortations for the voters, Dennis?
[03:42:14.640 --> 03:42:18.200]  Well, I want to thank you for coming to Trump.
[03:42:18.200 --> 03:42:19.840]  You made a big splash with everybody.
[03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:24.600]  I know you wore yourself out signing Stone's rules, but it's an incredible book, and I just
[03:42:24.600 --> 03:42:27.520]  hope everybody supports you because that's important.
[03:42:27.520 --> 03:42:30.840]  You go to Roger Stone's Legal Defense Fund and send some money.
[03:42:30.840 --> 03:42:35.800]  I did, I know a lot of my friends did, and we're worried about you, Roger, because you
[03:42:35.800 --> 03:42:37.600]  are a true American hero.
[03:42:37.600 --> 03:42:39.520]  Well, that's very kind.
[03:42:39.520 --> 03:42:43.040]  I'm a fighter, and you can go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:42:43.040 --> 03:42:49.160]  I'm very grateful for your contribution, Dennis, and your many friends in Las Vegas.
[03:42:49.160 --> 03:42:53.320]  There you have it, a wrap-up on one of the most exciting races in the country in Nevada.
[03:42:53.320 --> 03:42:57.280]  Living in Volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:42:57.280 --> 03:43:00.600]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:43:00.600 --> 03:43:05.920]  A lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid
[03:43:05.920 --> 03:43:06.920]  rain.
[03:43:06.920 --> 03:43:12.640]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[03:43:12.640 --> 03:43:14.160]  to unhealthy levels.
[03:43:14.160 --> 03:43:20.680]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:43:20.680 --> 03:43:24.680]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[03:43:24.680 --> 03:43:25.960]  in the rainwater.
[03:43:25.960 --> 03:43:31.360]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[03:43:31.360 --> 03:43:37.440]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:43:37.440 --> 03:43:43.080]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[03:43:43.080 --> 03:43:48.400]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:43:48.400 --> 03:43:53.480]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:43:53.480 --> 03:43:58.360]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[03:43:58.360 --> 03:44:02.800]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all
[03:44:02.800 --> 03:44:07.320]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.

[03:46:56.880 --> 03:47:12.920]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:12.920 --> 03:47:19.480]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:47:19.480 --> 03:47:25.360]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:47:25.360 --> 03:47:32.480]  Come back, you're on the Alex Jones show and I'm your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:32.480 --> 03:47:39.160]  That was a terrific segment with the Libertarian businessman and I think soon to be assembly
[03:47:39.160 --> 03:47:43.360]  member in the state of Nevada, Dennis Hoff.
[03:47:43.360 --> 03:47:49.160]  Joining us now is the crusading publisher of the Central Florida Post.
[03:47:49.160 --> 03:47:54.200]  Jacob Engels is no stranger to the Infowars audience.
[03:47:54.200 --> 03:48:02.080]  He has broken story after story after story, leaving the Miami Herald and the Fort Lauderdale
[03:48:02.080 --> 03:48:10.920]  Sun Sentinel, the Orlando Sentinel and others in the dust when it comes to getting incisive,
[03:48:10.920 --> 03:48:15.120]  hard hitting and accurate investigative reporting.
[03:48:15.120 --> 03:48:22.680]  He's going to tell us today about an incredible story regarding a Democratic member of Congress
[03:48:22.680 --> 03:48:30.760]  who it turns out was gorging herself on shrimp cocktails, lobster tails, and filet mignon
[03:48:30.760 --> 03:48:38.240]  while the people in her district were sweltering in the aftermath of Hermocaine Irma.
[03:48:38.240 --> 03:48:42.320]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show, Jacob Engels.
[03:48:42.320 --> 03:48:44.720]  Thank you for having me.
[03:48:44.720 --> 03:48:51.280]  Yes, Stephanie Murphy is the Democratic Congresswoman in Central Florida and we actually reported
[03:48:51.280 --> 03:48:57.680]  on an ad that you know for opponents, Republican opponents released last week where they found
[03:48:57.680 --> 03:49:04.720]  FEC filings and reports that showed she was holding a fundraiser on 9.13 and that's after
[03:49:04.720 --> 03:49:06.800]  her came Hermo ravaged the state.
[03:49:06.800 --> 03:49:12.560]  We were without power, water shortages, food shortages, streets flooded.
[03:49:12.560 --> 03:49:18.240]  It was very scary for about six or seven days and this lady, this Congresswoman who professes
[03:49:18.240 --> 03:49:23.440]  to be a woman of the people who builds herself as for the poor, for the middle class, Stephanie
[03:49:23.440 --> 03:49:28.640]  Murphy, Steakhouse Stephanie, as people are calling her, was holding a fundraiser and Charlie
[03:49:28.640 --> 03:49:34.720]  Palmer Steakhouse cost $3,200 so it was fine wine, fine steak, she was schmoozing with
[03:49:34.720 --> 03:49:39.200]  special interest donors, that's her right there and it really is sad.
[03:49:39.200 --> 03:49:44.320]  Now when the campaign released the ad and when we subsequently reported on the ad, Miss
[03:49:44.320 --> 03:49:50.560]  Murphy refused questions, wouldn't answer any questions and then eventually said, oh
[03:49:50.560 --> 03:49:55.800]  well, I really held the event on the 7th, which was during the state of emergency for
[03:49:55.800 --> 03:50:00.160]  the hurricane and I paid the bill on the 13th.
[03:50:00.160 --> 03:50:04.640]  Now if we are to believe that line from Murphy, what kind of average American could walk out
[03:50:04.640 --> 03:50:08.160]  on a $3,200 bill at a Steakhouse for a week?
[03:50:08.160 --> 03:50:14.400]  I think she's been caught in a line of lying and I confronted her at her office in a campaign
[03:50:14.400 --> 03:50:17.560]  office opening and she refused to answer.
[03:50:17.560 --> 03:50:22.640]  What's disturbing though, the real story here is not just the outrageous largesse of
[03:50:22.640 --> 03:50:29.640]  Steakhouse Stephanie, but the fact that the YouTube video of your incredible interview
[03:50:29.640 --> 03:50:36.200]  with her has been censored from the media, has been censored by YouTube.
[03:50:36.200 --> 03:50:42.800]  This is the same exact kind of censorship that Alex Jones and the entire force and crew
[03:50:42.800 --> 03:50:47.520]  at Infowars are being subjected to every day.
[03:50:47.520 --> 03:50:53.240]  These are the same people who reject any ad that I place on Facebook to try to sell copies
[03:50:53.240 --> 03:50:56.800]  of my stunning new book, Stones Rules.
[03:50:56.800 --> 03:51:04.200]  These are the same people who if I use Google Shortener for the Infowars Buy link, tells
[03:51:04.200 --> 03:51:07.040]  me that it's spam.
[03:51:07.040 --> 03:51:12.920]  This is a classic example of people trying to snuff out the First Amendment rights of
[03:51:12.920 --> 03:51:18.560]  the Central Florida Post and a crusading independent publisher.
[03:51:18.560 --> 03:51:26.080]  It is disgraceful, but it's valuable because as I travel around the country and I speak
[03:51:26.080 --> 03:51:34.000]  to conservative and Tea Party and liberty-oriented groups, they ask me, well, aren't you and
[03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:36.360]  Alex Jones exaggerating?
[03:51:36.360 --> 03:51:40.240]  I mean, are they really trying to shut you down?
[03:51:40.240 --> 03:51:43.840]  Make no mistake about it, folks.
[03:51:43.840 --> 03:51:49.560]  What's happening to Jacob Engels at the Central Florida Post is exactly what's happening here
[03:51:49.560 --> 03:51:51.080]  at Infowars.
[03:51:51.080 --> 03:51:58.040]  It's what happens when we try to put Owen Schreuer's great videos on from the War Room.
[03:51:58.040 --> 03:52:00.280]  It's a war of censorship.
[03:52:00.280 --> 03:52:06.240]  They want to take away our voices and then take away our firearms.
[03:52:06.240 --> 03:52:09.880]  It's a two-pronged strategy.
[03:52:09.880 --> 03:52:17.680]  The reason I thought this story was important was not just the fact that Steakhouse Stephanie
[03:52:17.680 --> 03:52:24.440]  was gorging herself at an extraordinarily expensive and posh watering hole in Washington
[03:52:24.440 --> 03:52:31.320]  while the people in their districts were sweating their off, but the fact that the truth about
[03:52:31.320 --> 03:52:38.480]  this is being concealed from the American people through censorship, and therein lies
[03:52:38.480 --> 03:52:39.480]  the issue.
[03:52:39.480 --> 03:52:40.480]  Absolutely, Roger.
[03:52:40.480 --> 03:52:50.040]  I mean, one has to ask themselves if Facebook, who removed the live video and other platforms,
[03:52:50.040 --> 03:52:54.520]  who can't find it anymore, Facebook removed the live video, and there's nothing wrong
[03:52:54.520 --> 03:52:55.520]  with the video.
[03:52:55.520 --> 03:52:56.520]  I came to her campaign office.
[03:52:56.520 --> 03:53:01.880]  This is a publicly advertised event, and I asked a simple question, Congresswoman, would
[03:53:01.880 --> 03:53:09.280]  you agree that natural disasters cannot be postponed, but political fundraisers can?
[03:53:09.280 --> 03:53:14.480]  She refused to answer the questions, and she actually scooped up her young child and kept
[03:53:14.480 --> 03:53:19.000]  shielding and putting the child in my face and into the camera space to get out of the
[03:53:19.000 --> 03:53:23.600]  question, and then wants to act like a victim afterwards and says that Child Protective
[03:53:23.600 --> 03:53:26.240]  Services should have been called on me, that I was threatening children.
[03:53:26.240 --> 03:53:29.920]  Well, no, Stephanie Murphy, you want to tell us the truth about what you were doing at
[03:53:29.920 --> 03:53:34.360]  Charlie Palmer Steakhouse, and now you've colluded with Facebook, who has removed a
[03:53:34.360 --> 03:53:37.360]  live video that paints you in a negative light.
[03:53:37.360 --> 03:53:38.640]  That's a campaign contribution.
[03:53:38.640 --> 03:53:42.360]  Is Facebook going to be getting campaign contributions through Republicans, to conservatives, or
[03:53:42.360 --> 03:53:47.080]  just a plusy puppet in deep state barbies like Stephanie Murphy?
[03:53:47.080 --> 03:53:53.640]  I was very sad that some Republican colleagues of hers who shall remain nameless rushed to
[03:53:53.640 --> 03:53:55.280]  her defense.
[03:53:55.280 --> 03:53:58.800]  I think her actions are indefensible.
[03:53:58.800 --> 03:54:01.040]  It's about timing.
[03:54:01.040 --> 03:54:03.160]  She should apologize.
[03:54:03.160 --> 03:54:04.840]  I've made mistakes in my life.
[03:54:04.840 --> 03:54:12.840]  I've had bad timing in my political commentary, but she'd do so much better to apologize to
[03:54:12.840 --> 03:54:21.840]  the constituency in her district and refund the money she collected at the five-star Washington
[03:54:21.840 --> 03:54:30.320]  restaurant while the poor people in her district were in the dark without clean water sweating.
[03:54:30.320 --> 03:54:33.520]  That I think is the bottom line.
[03:54:33.520 --> 03:54:40.040]  Tell me, since I've got you, what is your assessment of the governor's race there on
[03:54:40.040 --> 03:54:43.120]  both the Republican and Democrat side?
[03:54:43.120 --> 03:54:47.120]  Give me a quick central Florida post handicap.
[03:54:47.120 --> 03:54:48.120]  Absolutely.
[03:54:48.120 --> 03:54:50.680]  We'll start with the Democrat primary.
[03:54:50.680 --> 03:54:57.240]  You actually had South Florida billionaire, Jeff Green, who had a quixotic Senate bid
[03:54:57.240 --> 03:55:00.600]  in 2010, jumping the race.
[03:55:00.600 --> 03:55:06.480]  He's going to spend, I'm hearing, up to $80 million to get through the primary, and he's
[03:55:06.480 --> 03:55:10.040]  going to spend another $60 million, $80 million in general election.
[03:55:10.040 --> 03:55:15.760]  We have a Black Lives Matter, George Soros funded, Tallahassee, Mayor, Andrew Gillum,
[03:55:15.760 --> 03:55:20.360]  who is actually under investigation by the FBI for a lot of stuff going on up there
[03:55:20.360 --> 03:55:21.360]  in Tallahassee.
[03:55:21.360 --> 03:55:25.760]  You have Gwen Graham, daughter of former governor Bob Graham.
[03:55:25.760 --> 03:55:29.480]  She's playing the more moderate line with the Democrats, and then you have a few other
[03:55:29.480 --> 03:55:34.520]  businessman, Philip Levine, Chris King.
[03:55:34.520 --> 03:55:37.320]  I think this is probably Gwen Graham's to lose.
[03:55:37.320 --> 03:55:41.440]  She'll have a tough fight with Andrew Gillum as an African American, it's a large voting
[03:55:41.440 --> 03:55:44.480]  base for Democrats, and we'll see who comes out of there.
[03:55:44.480 --> 03:55:49.840]  On the Republican side, you have Adam Putnam, who's the commissioner of agriculture, and
[03:55:49.840 --> 03:55:52.320]  he's actually done a very good job as commissioner of agriculture.
[03:55:52.320 --> 03:55:57.280]  I don't agree with everything that he stands for in terms of what he stood for in Congress
[03:55:57.280 --> 03:56:02.160]  before he was commissioner of agriculture, but he's running against a man, Ron DeSantis,
[03:56:02.160 --> 03:56:06.360]  who a lot of viewers probably think is on President Trump's side, and he's not.
[03:56:06.360 --> 03:56:09.560]  This is a man who refused to defend the president's mental health.
[03:56:09.560 --> 03:56:12.640]  This is a man who voted for food stamps for illegal immigrants.
[03:56:12.640 --> 03:56:17.480]  This is a man who, when we exposed that on Central Reporter Post, went to a Soros-funded
[03:56:17.480 --> 03:56:21.760]  fact-checking website that crapped all over Donald Trump in support of Hillary Clinton
[03:56:21.760 --> 03:56:30.680]  in 2016 to label me as a mainstream news reporter and claim that I am somehow part of the establishment.
[03:56:30.680 --> 03:56:37.840]  Ron DeSantis has a real issue here, he talks a big game, but he really doesn't support
[03:56:37.840 --> 03:56:38.840]  our president.
[03:56:38.840 --> 03:56:41.560]  There are some very interesting items that we're going to expose in the next couple
[03:56:41.560 --> 03:56:47.080]  of weeks, in addition to the fact that he claims he cannot be in the district, he claims
[03:56:47.080 --> 03:56:51.720]  he cannot be in the state campaigning because he's so busy defending President Trump in
[03:56:51.720 --> 03:56:53.680]  Congress and on Fox News.
[03:56:53.680 --> 03:56:58.320]  Well, we've gotten to the bottom of it, we've conducted some research, and let's just say
[03:56:58.320 --> 03:57:03.600]  he's not as active in Congress as people would like to believe, and he would love you to
[03:57:03.600 --> 03:57:04.600]  believe.
[03:57:04.600 --> 03:57:10.160]  He's got some issues with attendance, let's say, and Mr. DeSantis will have a tough primary.
[03:57:10.160 --> 03:57:14.600]  He's at $10 million cash on hand, I believe, out of Hutton and up close to the $23 million
[03:57:14.600 --> 03:57:17.520]  policy out of Chase.
[03:57:17.520 --> 03:57:24.040]  Did I not read that he took $200,000 from a million-dollar Clinton fundraiser who is
[03:57:24.040 --> 03:57:27.280]  financing the campaign of Adam Schiff?
[03:57:27.280 --> 03:57:30.440]  That alone would disturb me greatly.
[03:57:30.440 --> 03:57:36.360]  We're going to be watching this hard-fought Republican primary between Adam Putnam, the
[03:57:36.360 --> 03:57:40.960]  Secretary of Agriculture, and hard-charging Congressman Ron DeSantis.
[03:57:40.960 --> 03:57:47.400]  Thank you so much, Jacob, for joining us here on The Alex Jones Show.
